The room they entered looked pretty cosy and only consisted of two couches and a fireplace. Draco and Hermione sat each in one couch and stared at each other in silence, not knowing what to say. After a good minute, she sighed and removed the disillusionment charm again.
Hermione sighed. "Stop, Draco. Sit down and explain stuff correctly."
The five students frowned, waiting for him to pursue.
"It’s alright, we’ll spend the night together." He guided him to the bed. "Here, lay down." But when he tried to walk away, a firm grasp caught his wrist.
"I would like you to stop being so reckless, Mr. Mal- Black, told me about your training. Please avoid doing such dangerous experiments while unsupervised. I’m sure Pr.  Dupree would be glad to assist you."
"You’ll need to train your magic and be able to hold a disillusionment charm on all the time."
"Harry?"
"Harry," Draco panted, "sto- stop panicking, your flow is, is disturb-" He winced again.
"Alright." Harry thought, taking a deep breath. "I’ll just wake him up gently…" Trembling, he climbed on the bed and softly started shaking Draco, in vain. He was wincing and groaning, sweating from the pain and stirring in the bed in hope for relief. He decided to give it all out and, cupping his face, pressed their lips together. He tried to put as much magic and love as he could and when he finally moved away, he met cold grey eyes and rosy cheeks.
Harry pat his head. "What a lovely smile. Let’s go get dinner."
"I’m not going." He crossed his arms.
"Harry, stop. You didn’t attack me and you will never do so. I was just uncomfortable because I’m still wet. My tails are super heavy and I don’t want to smell like a wet dog."
I hope I didn’t wake you up!
"Why not. I still haven’t finished my essay though."
"I’ll take good care of you, Honey, if you want me to." Harry smiled. "Do you want me to?"
"He didn’t really have a choice there did he? He only did that to protect his mom and she still…" He sighed. "It must have been hard."
"My tongue got stuck to my palate."
He blushed. "You look amazing."
"I can’t believe he’s gone."
Hermione nodded. "You should send one to Sirius too, I bet he’d be proud to see you’ve finally decided to 'follow his good taste'" She teased, imitating his voice.
"It’s okay, I eat."
Now both Harry and Draco were blushing, and Pansy let out a victory cry. "So you two finally had that talk!"
"Well." Draco sighed. "Seems like this his how the pact is concluded."
"Finally." He sighed, getting up. "I need your help, Ginny."
They stayed silent for a moment, until he stretched and told her goodnight, leaving for his dorm. Headmistress McGonagall had organised a small common room for the five returning eight years, they each had a little dorm and an individual bathroom. He sat on his bed. It was weird to sleep alone at Hogwarts. After having used a locking and silencing - one can never be to cautious - charm, he allowed himself to uncover his tail, ears and… Claws? He looked at his hands again, sighing in displeasure, and then in the mirror. He looked ridiculous. He headed to his bathroom where he spent thirty good minutes getting ready for bed. His silk pyjamas on, he slid under the covers and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
He smiled and bowed slightly for Harry to access the top of his head, which he started to pat, gently caressing the fluffy ears emerging from his hair.
"If this isn’t my dear first cousin once removed." Said a sarcastic voice.
Draco squinted his eyes and slowly nodded. "Thank- Thank you, Granger."
The mood darkened as she asked: "You’re- You’re not going to die like that girl, right?"
"They are called kaiken. They were your father’s. Your aunt kept them hidden for Narcissa. Your parents… They probably wanted them to go to you." Harry explained.
"Of course I am, you’re my- My…"
"Shit." She then said. "You could die."
Today was a rainy Saturday, they had spent the whole day studying in their common room, helping each other with the tremendous amount of homework they were stuck with. Of course, now that Autumn was finally there, the sun had decided to hide behind grey clouds which would not stop crying. Even the wind was howling, making the dull day utterly gloomy.
"It’s not your fault his mo-"
And just like that, they left. Hermione, Ron and Pansy shared a worried look.
"Yes. 'Ongaku Kitsune are of the sound and music. They can be of all melody, fierce or calm, steady or wild, and while they are the most creative kind, they also are the weakest. Their power has soothing and healing properties that some find extremely powerful, but as they have no offensive capacities, they are often looked over by their pairs. They can be easily recognised by their high yellow eyes and fair fur.’"
I guess you slept together tonight, there was nothing you could really do to avoid it. Wish him a good morning from me too!
"What the actual h-"
"Where were you?" Hermione snapped as soon as they arrived.
The sound of the dripping water helped him calm down a little. The water’s warmth was comforting. Today was the day he would be bonded to Draco. In a way, he was excited. His affection for Draco had been reciprocated and this was a promise they would be together for a moment, if not forever. However, another part of him felt extremely guilty. Would Ginny really be okay with this? If not, what would he have done? Harry tried thinking about it, and the answer came to him quicker than he expected. He would bond with Draco. Even if she was against it. Because if he did not, then maybe Draco would die. And Harry did not want that. He did not want that at all. Yes, this situation had rushed things a little bit. Yes, Harry would have preferred to be able to take his time. But Sirius was right. They would have all the time later.
"Of course he really did it." Harry grinned.
I’m glad to hear that everything went well. Don’t worry too much about the bond restrictions and the pain Draco could feel at some times, it will stop soon - depending on your strengths. Let’s call it an adaptation phase.
Draco let himself fall on Harry, having so strength left to support his own body. How could his absence be so painful?
Behind the closed door, Draco Malfoy was shaking, trying to hold back tears. What had he just heard? Why was Potter talking… Alone? A feeling of guilt shot at him like a kick in the stomach and he felt like he was going to be sick. Tottering, he slowly headed back to the eight year’s common room.
"May I touch them?"
"Yeah," he smirked, "Draco Black."
Draco nodded. "Even if it’s mostly a beige or a grey, white is a light colour too so we could never know."
"Yeah, can I come in?"
"Pansy told me he thinks I hate him, because he was a Death Eater. But I don’t. He didn’t even have a choice. If I hated him I wouldn’t have testified for him."
Harry frowned. "I asked you to make me yours many time already, and despite figuring out we aren’t 'just friends' you still won’t figure out what I want?"
Draco nodded and stretched. It was time to get out of bed. As he was waiting, Harry started getting dressed. Draco winced at the sight of the worn out and distasteful clothes.
"I hope you’ll be able to find in time."
Draco breathed one last time in Harry’s neck and got up, determined again. As they were headed to their friends, he gasped in realisation.
"You’re no fun," Harry sighed, "I’ll be right back."
"Demand made by: Sirius Orion Black, heir of the House Black.
"What happened for you to be in such a good mood?"
"What did it say."
"Am I mad?" He whined, taking his head in his hands.
"Seems like Potter’s in a bad mood." Whispered Pansy in his ear.
"Your ears. May I?"
Harry too, had fallen asleep. On the ground of the Reminiscence Hall, exhausted from crying. Ginny’s ghost could not call anyone to get him to his dorm. Because Ginny’s ghost only existed in his head.
She nodded and started neatly writing the thirteen names. "Here."
"Alright, but you need to get up for that."
"What?"
Unable to resist, Harry let their lips meet once again, gladly welcoming Draco’s little bites. Slowly, he started pushing Harry back, towards a tree. And when his goal was met and his boyfriend was pinned against it, he left his lips to let burning kisses on his jaw, then in his neck. Once he reached Harry’s collarbone, he gently bit it, causing him to moan softly. Draco moved away with a smirk and, after a soft peck on Harry’s lips, started walking away.
"It’s not as if she’d kill me for being late." Harry scoffed.
"Oh, okay er… Sirius, then?"
"I’m sorry for laughing at you for not having a…" He hesitated. "A family. I see how much it hurts now."
"Alright." Draco’s lips turned into a light smile.
"You were happy there was no mating but I feel like it would’ve been easier for you if you had a mate somewhere…"
"So, is it a yes?"
He started prepping the ingredients, giving instructions to Harry in the meantime. They were able to progress efficiently and soon enough, their Essence of Insanity was done.
"I don’t know, you tell me."
A minute later, Harry joined him under the covers. It seemed like Draco had troubles breathing.
Before Draco could say anything, he had already moved away and sat next to him - in front of Hermione.
"Why don’t you hate me?"
"I was waiting for you to ask."
The day went on like an usual Friday would, but Hermione, Ron and Pansy could feel the tension in the air. Tomorrow, many things would have changed. Slytherins and Gryffindor did not have common lessons today and the small group was only able to gather during meals. At dinner, the air was so heavy no one dared to speak.
"I’m not an idiot!" Cried Draco.
"Oh, Honey, I know I am. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of you as soon as we’re freed from here."
He stayed curled up in his room’s armchair until the clock indicated 7:30AM and he headed for breakfast. As he was walking down the stairs of their dorms, he heard footsteps behind him and turned back.
She lowered her gaze. "I had figured it out, yes… But I didn’t know how to tell you."
"Ginny?"
"It’s Black now." Draco growled.
Harry slowly nodded and Sirius looked at Draco, who also nodded.
"Well, I’ve had itchinesses around the, er… End of the spine, and on my scalp, where these ears are now since my birthday. I also grew almost a head taller, and my hair is lighter. But I noticed the features this morning, and tomorrow it’ll be three months since my eighteenth birthday."
Harry, Ron and Hermione had spent the afternoon with Hagrid after having worked on a DADA homework during the morning and were headed to the Great Hall for dinner. Hermione had decided not to tell anything to Harry - yet - about the small meeting she and Draco had agreed on. He would have been too anxious and Ron would have figured out something was planned, something he did not know about, and could have ended up feeling left out.
"Well…" Draco blushed even more. "I’d like to, yes, but we have to get closer first, don’t we?"
"Oops." He whispered as he moved Harry’s head back up.
Without hesitation, Harry headed to the condemned window and started tearing off the planks. Before Draco could even join, all the rotten wood was on the floor and a French window was uncovered. Harry opened it and got out on the balcony, taking a deep breath of the fresh air.
"Stop teasing me and get to work already."
"Harry?"
Her heart ached. He was right, Blaise too, was gone. Not knowing what to say, they just stayed like that, on the ground, watching the duel that would define their future. They stayed there, loosing track of time, until the Dark Lord’s body finally hit the floor. Death Eaters flew in dark smoke and, as Harry fell on the ground from exhaustion, Draco stood up and started running towards his mother’s corpse.
They were both in pyjamas, walking in the unused corridors trying not to be seen. After fifteen good minutes, they finally entered their common room where a focused Hermione was holding her wand, magic radiating all around her. When she noticed Draco, she let herself relax and the charm covering his features disappeared as nine fluffy tails made their apparition. He almost fell when Pansy jumped on him.
If the mother is a vampire, the offspring will inherit both powers and become a voracious creature that will probably end up being haunted down, considered too dangerous to live once they reach three tails. If they bred, the offspring would only inherit the vampire powers.
"Stop with that already."
She hummed, shaking her head. "More than my boyfriend, you were my best friend, Harry. And I always knew, your love for me would never be genuine. It was only what everyone wanted, right? The great Harry Potter had to settle with a nice girl. You were afraid no one would accept your sexuality. But I’ve known, ever since sixth year when you asked me to be your girlfriend despite looking for him all the time, that you were only with me to try to normalise yourself. Because that’s what people were waiting for you do to. You have done enough for people, Harry. Now is time you start thinking about you. Be selfish. Snatch what you want and make it yours. No one will be able to stop you, not after you saved our world."
They climbed the stairs in silence, paying attention to the many holes in the rotten wood. Harry stopped before a shabby door.
"They’re so soft." He laughed.
He nodded and left to wait at his own desk. After giving Ron some instructions about his essay, she joined him.
"Will you go to the ball with me?"
Concerned people: Draco Lucius Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black.
"What the fuck is he doing here?" He thought, kneeling down, looking more closely at Harry’s face. White strands were crossing his cheeks. Draco’s eyes widened. Right, he was crying yesterday night. But how dehydrated could one be for their tears to turn into salt? He looked at Harry again, he seemed different somehow, without the frown and clenched jaw. He took a deep breath and, shaking him softly, tried waking him up.
"We can forget about this one too." Draco interrupted.
"Cross this one too." Draco cut.
"I… Yeah, I did." He stuttered, sitting up.
"Draco? Draco! Are you alright?"
They spent the evening celebrating, planning their Halloween costumes, drinking and laughing. When the clock showed 10PM, they decided to go to bed. Draco and Harry parted ways, each going to take a shower, and as Draco headed out of the shower with a towel around his hips only, he did not realise someone had slipped in his room until two warm hands caught him by the waist and a soft mouth started planting kisses in his neck.
Draco opened his arms and he squeezed himself in, keeping they foreheads pressed together.  After some time, Draco’s breathing evened out and he fell asleep. Relieved, Harry turned his back on him and snuggled in. "Ahh, how good it is to be the little spoon for once." He happily thought. A couple of seconds later, he also drifted to sleep.
Draco sets down his wineglass on the counter. The sound of marble clinking against glass. Then he tugs Harry’s glass away from him, and sets it down as well. Clink.
“Yep. Two more.”
in the well?”
On their second night of drinks, Blaise lowers his eyes shamelessly and stares at Harry’s lips for a good ten seconds, then allows his gaze to wander back up. And smiles. Smugly.
“Why do you have a scythe,” Draco says, very quickly, the words frantically evacuating from a burning building.
“There are plenty of people who prefer me dead, Potter. Among them, evidently, is you.”
At the end of the night, Harry shoves Ron firmly into the Floo, dictating his address for him. Hermione, as someone actually capable of taking hints, had left several hours before. Malfoy is significantly less plastered than Ron, managing to walk to the fireplace on his own.
He looks furious at this.
Despite the massive toll Euston Road took on him, Harry makes a speedy recovery, and Malfoy is soon approaching bankruptcy. He surveys the board with dismay.
Well, it’s not as if Blaise
” Harry practically sings. Luna sends him a confused look, then a knowing one, which in turn confuses Harry.
“Mhm.”
“What are you, some YouTuber who’s fallen from public grace?” she scoffs.
Of course, why does it matter that Harry literally can no longer experience emotion, not in any human sense of the word? Or that they’re both dead? Draco’s ability to annoy Harry is clearly just a universal constant.
“You finally did it,” Potter, Harry says, smiling hugely.
“Hey, hey, uh, Harry, you’re not,” Ron’s words slur, “not still mad at Malfoy? For being a piece of shit?” Ron falls half off the couch.
“I said, it’s alright.”
Beater?” “Well, yes, Gurt isn’t the best they’ve ever had, but they actually used an actual Quidditch strategy last game! There’s hope!”) until Luna manages to sidetrack all three of them into a discussion about the relative merits of dragon blood and oven cleaner.
The irritated customer pulls a large handkerchief out of his pocket and spits out a remarkably sized piece of chewed gum into it. Well, then.
“Watch your head.” A golem sends an

“Sleeping. Reading, sometimes.”
Draco is smiling at him, silvery hair caught by the breeze, his suit jacket fluttering, Harry’s robes captured in the same wind, and Harry answers his own question.
They run through the flask routine again, which has turned out to be the only thing that consistently works. Which Harry also sees as a mistake, because it gives Harry ample time to stare at Malfoy’s clothes. Which fit him impossibly well.
“I’ll show you! I have a portkey to the London library.”
In response, Draco smiles radiantly, like someone who’s been happy for a long, long time, a lifetime. And the kaleidoscope turns again, revealing the light that shines through it. And what’s so wrong with complexity, when it feels like
An owl swoops in through the still open window and drops a red envelope, edges already blackening, onto the kitchen countertop, then swoops back out.
“Do you just like small spaces, then?”
“I still have the scars from that.”
Harry startles at the use of his first name, but then settles, realizing he has been thinking of Malfoy as Draco for some time now, anyways. Draco’s hair shines silvery, almost gold, in the warm light of Grimmauld’s fireplace. He looks perfectly refined, even when he’s sprawled out in Harry’s armchair, legs crossed at the ankles. Harry wonders what kind of ungodly things Draco did to get his hair to look like that, and sips his brandy.
Draco examines the stem of his wine glass.
“Neither. Don’t.”
He wonders about Harry’s pause for a second. But as Harry's words themselves register, hope flares up within Draco, bright and unkind. It leaves him feeling nastily exposed.
“Oh.”
Draco’s spirit stands up, spots Harry, and immediately starts talking, but his body remains prone on the floor.
Harry grins with barely concealed satisfaction.
“Maybe I’ll steal yours, then.”
“God. Potter. You’re a fucking sap.”
Draco smiles like a person who hasn’t been happy for a long time. Well, Harry wished for messy, and he got it, didn’t he?
as Harry kisses him back, with much less of the chasteness. Harry ends up hoisted onto the countertop, the whole of Draco’s body pressed against him, Draco’s legs wrapped around his waist, and doesn’t know whether to close his eyes or never blink again. The rain and wind sing on through the open windows, droplets and gusts whiling through the lights, wetting Harry’s hair, Draco’s clothes, their lips. Harry is struck by a sudden thought, and pulls away gently.
“See you in a week, Potter.”
“Honestly, I knew this would happen if
It feels as though Draco has finally been pitched back into the real world, where Harry Potter should have better things to do than Draco Malfoy (heh), the real world where Draco needs to send apology letters and find a Wizarding job and- and visit his mother. God, he hasn’t seen her in so long. Narcissa.
“What? In the last
“Ah.” Harry tactfully leaves it at that.
Harry Apparates them to a small forest clearing, encircled by tall spruces and cedars.
“Malfoy! Look! It’s your wand! They listened to me! I can show you wandless magic now, if you still want to learn!” There’s the sound of rustling paper. “Wait- all parole requirements have been removed? Trace removed? Travel ban lifted? Draco!”
The eyes widen comically. “How did you know?”
Harry takes his arm and drags him through the trees, until both of them are running, stumbling over each other’s feet and panting, laughing. They break out into a wide, limitless field of long grass, swaying gently in a quiet summer breeze, and Draco goes on running, pulling Harry along until the treeline is a distant shadow. His wand’s in his other hand, but he doesn’t cast anything. It’s enough to feel it, the potential stored within it, so many more possibilities than a dirty house or the inside of a tree. He leans his head against Potter’s shoulder, and there are possibilities there too, aren’t there? He’s just been too stupid and stubborn and self-deceptive to know it, just like with everything else. He looks up at the vast dusky sky, the stars just beginning to show themselves. He can feel Harry’s gaze on him.
And strangely, once again, Potter's features are swamped with relief, as if he’s been holding his breath, waiting all this time for Draco to angrily demand to be taught wandless magic.
“I’ll drink to that,” and Draco does, taking a long sip. He licks his lips afterwards, flicking his gaze over to Harry. Harry does his best not to swallow. “So. I win. I am better at taking over your life than you.”
When he gets home, he leaves the letter on the dirty kitchen countertop, and heads up the stairs to the dusty mattress on the second floor.
Harry drops his cards on the grass trying to play Opt, but it’s worth it to hear the sounds of Draco laughing at him, warm and soft.
” Malfoy nods earnestly, and continues talking.
“Obviously I do. You would not be able to comprehend the number of things I was tutored in between the ages of six and ten. Pureblood upbringing. Hey, Teddy’s really quite smart for his age, isn’t he?”
things to my son!”
“Was honest with her. Told her I needed to seduce your godfather.”'
“Mr. Potter. Are you looking for the party? I believe it should be confined to the front of the house, unless it truly has gotten out of hand.”
“Potter, you idiot,” Malfoy says, Apparating next to him. “Our whole advantage was long-distance offense.” He Transfigures his wand into a scimitar and slashes the first one at the waist, narrowly dodging a
He thinks about wandless magic. “I sort of just pretend my arm itself is the wand,” Potter had said.
“I’m going to lose to you, and then die,” Draco says.
Draco laughs. “Maybe,” he allows, and casts
Malfoy ignores him, then says, quite sporadically, “You know, Potter, me being an Auror isn’t just all some political act I’m putting on.”
“The hell is Malfoy doing here?” Harry demands.
Draco leans further over the lip of the well. “What?”
“O-oh.” And suddenly, Potter refuses to meet his eyes. Well, alright then.
“That does seem to be a bit of an impediment, then.”
But he shakes Harry’s hand anyways.
“I hope you’re sure about that.”
stop laughing.”
“For what?”
on Harry’s bucket list.
Potter?”
But Draco doesn’t speak. And because everything is backwards, when Harry walks softly towards him, Draco doesn’t turn away or draw his wand. When Harry says “Show me your arm,” Draco rolls up his sleeve obligingly. There’s poetry in Harry now, in the way he moves and speaks and exists. Harry, so rough and practical, is now a sonnet to Draco. And Draco isn’t much at all. Potter, Potter, Harry.
“As I was
to see the look on his face when he realizes both of us betrayed him to you.
“Oh, really? What’s so special about the wood?”
Draco sighs, with an amount of exasperation that Harry feels is rather unnecessary. “Which, of the dozens of things I could feel guilt about, are you referring to?”
“It should work now,” Draco says, and walks away. The man calls an aggressive “Thank you!” after him, and thanks Sarah as well, before stuffing the gum back into his mouth and checking out.
“Well, that’s a horribly depressing worldview.”
“I regret not having met him and Andromeda before now.”
“No, I don’t think that’s the plan.”
Actually, the fact that he’s good at being an Auror is far from the worst thing. The
“Why do you think it’d be lonely, though?”
“Thank you, Narcissa. Actually, uh, I was hoping to talk to you. I realized I never actually thanked you for saving my life. Even if it was only for Draco’s sake. So, thank you.”
smiles at Harry, then. Harry stares at his mouth, curled upwards in the ferocious joy of victory, of trying to exist, live, improve. Harry’s forgotten what that was like. He thinks about a tiny potions spoon, diligently ferrying aconite into a cauldron, about Draco, washing his hands clean, about “yes, Potter, things that are played earlier sometimes execute later, what’s so hard to understand about that.” He thinks about former Death Eaters playing Magic: The Gathering and about a handshake, offered to him when he was eleven.
Happy. He Apparates to Malfoy Manor, and sees his mother again, the way he's wanted to for the past four years. He laughs and cries, and everything else in between, and tries not to tell her everything he’s been through, but he does anyways.
“Probably not wise words to say to an ex-Death Eater holding your wand in a small enclosed space. Who knows, I might go rogue and follow through.”
The first night they meet up, Blaise is taciturn. He just stares amusedly at Harry for an uncomfortable length of time, and doesn’t seem inclined to speak to him at all.
“I want you,” Harry had said, constantly, whenever he thought Draco wasn’t sure, or even just for the sake of saying it. He had been like that, the thoughts spilling from his tongue and teeth, thoughts that were repetitive whenever they were about his love for Draco.
Harry balks. “Scars?”
“Uh...”
When the boy nears him, Draco lowers himself, taking a knee, instead of walking on unseeingly as he usually does. The child stops, surprised.
“Malfoy, that’s not an actual challenge.”
He jumps an impressive distance upwards, and strings together a rather interesting set of words, which include
“He’s a friend?” Ron looks pensive, then nods firmly. “A friend.”
Draco luxuriates in the darkness of the well, not responding, listening to the sounds of Harry's voice but not to the words.
When Malfoy returns, Harry tells him “Yeah, I know you’re not just being an Auror for cred,” which astonishes Harry himself, and clearly surprises Malfoy too. “So why? Honestly, I thought it was for the power.”
Harry chokes on his drink.
The sounds of the party grow louder. Just outside the intricately-carved front doors, Draco pauses and smirks. And then shoves them open.
a third time, and maybe it’s how dark the well is, but the charm seems brighter than it has ever been before. “Let’s go somewhere with more space.”
Draco adds the minced aconite to the potion a tiny spoonful at a time, and seems to be holding his breath. When he adds the last spoon and the potion begins to emit blue smoke, he exhales with relief. He mumbles a Stasis charm, then pours the contents of the cauldron into fourteen separate vials, bundles the vials into two small cardboard boxes, and scribbles shipping addresses onto the boxes. Two minutes left. He washes his hands in a nearby sink, and wanders into the next room. Harry follows him, in the spectre world. One more minute. Draco reaches for an untouched piece of cake on the mantelpiece, takes a bite, and is dead within sixty seconds. He was twenty-five years old.
Tom looks momentarily impressed. Then, he removes a lollipop from his mouth and begins monologuing.
if Malfoy could bugger off, stop stealing Harry’s friends, and stop reminding Harry of killing curses and screaming in a bathroom.
“Okay, I don’t want to do this anymore,” Harry says.
"I won't. I'll want you tomorrow, too."
“Have you played before?” Draco inquires.
“Potter, no, please, don’t-”

“No.”
“Oh hell no, I’m not dealing with another questioning guy. As if Theo wasn’t bad enough.”
Pansy’s eyebrows shoot up, and somehow she does not appear disappointed at the absence of Draco’s outraged tirade, which she had clearly been looking forward to. She merely detaches herself from Harry, smiles, and walks back to the Manor, casting a backwards glance at them.

for Slytherins?
They link arms and begin to walk up the driveway, stones crunching under Pansy’s heels and Harry’s shoes. As they approach Draco, who is now leaning cross-armed against one of the trees that line the gravel, Harry watches his expression change. He starts out staring daggers at both him and Pansy, but mostly Pansy. And then his gaze flicks back to Harry, and he visibly starts. When they finally walk up to him, Pansy smirking as much as anything, all Draco says is “You look good, Potter.”
“What the

It’s funny how the shame of punishment resolves you from guilt, and when the punishment is lifted, you remember that the guilt has been there all along, hovering over your head like an old friend who’s out of town.

“It’s small. Comfortable.”
Harry chances a glance at him. Malfoy quickly looks up, and adopts his familiar pureblood sneer.

“Harry.”
“Ah.”

“What? But I gave it back to you-”
“Oh, good grief.” Draco collapses into an armchair. “Well, whatever you want, Harry.”
“Say Harry.”
“I don’t

have.”
“Potter?”
“You did start this whole thing.”
And for a second, he felt safe. Nobody to spit at him, hiss
Draco stretches his legs out, leans back against the wall, and listens to the sounds of his former nemesis’ voice as he tries to explain how he accesses his magical core without a wand, and once again, feels something suspiciously like contentment.
“You must have taken him down hard.”
What use is simplicity, when it feels like
So Harry takes Draco’s left hand and brings it to his lips.
“Thank you very much,” Malfoy says, and smiles irresistibly sweet at Harry. Harry smiles back, but quickly realizes what he’s doing, and wipes it off his face. Draco stares at him.
Seducing the Savior of the Wizarding World. This is probably just the sort of nefarious deed that people like Tom’s parents were always suspecting him of. Draco smirks at the thought, and takes another step forward, the toes of his shoes almost lining up against Harry’s, the grass stalks bending gently under his weight.
Not for the first time, Harry wonders who Draco Malfoy really is.
They’re standing a few feet apart, now, facing each other. Draco leans forward, almost imperceptibly, but Harry’s eyes follow the movement.
Harry stops outside a door. And of
“Oh, for the love of Merlin, tell me they didn’t also put an ankle monitor on you.”
“It’s on my property. That’s my house,” and Potter jerks his shoulder, indicating the cottage.
Draco grins at him again, a toothy thing, and this time, Harry smiles back without restraint.
“You know, I’ve been in love with you since third year,” Draco says.
now a connoisseur of Muggle culture.
How can you like a person, when they act so differently depending on who they’re with?

“Do you
“If you don’t tell me, I’ll just try both.”
Malfoy. Going for the exes, huh? Harry can do that, too. What was Blaise’s Owl address, again?
“Aalwekfjoipoiajewf,” the man exclaims, while seeming to chew at something inside his mouth. Well, that was the first time Draco had heard someone manage to articulate a true verbal keyboard smash. Draco nods seriously at the man.
“Ugh!” Harry scrapes together the sum in one-pound notes, and smacks them into Malfoy’s outstretched hand.
“Uh, I was just-” Harry almost laughs at the look on his face.
“Thank you for waiting, then.”
“Is that a yes?”
“Harry.”
“Aurors are also technically required to have a clean record.” It takes Draco a second to realize he’s referring to criminality.
“Would inviting you in be sufficient proof?” he asks, jerking his head towards his cottage. “We could cast a spell again.”
Potter just looks at him irritatedly, then shoves his wand without ceremony into Draco’s hand.
“Oh, she’s doing beautifully.” Luna’s voice becomes dreamy, and Harry sends her a teasing glance. Luna smiles at him, and changes the topic. Luna and him had always gotten along well. Harry wonders why he had never bothered to make friends with her before now.
“But our lot crawls between dry ribs,” Draco proclaims seriously a few minutes later.
challenge Death?” he asks instead of answering.
--oOo--
“Yes, what?” Harry asks, just a little too harshly for his casual tones.
Harry discovers that Blaise is actually much easier than Pansy, especially once he realizes the man is trying to get Harry to sleep with him.
“Hi, Luna, thank you for having me! Hey, Malfoy.” Harry allows himself another smirk. Malfoy looks ready to explode.
On June 5th, Harry goes downstairs to Grimmauld’s wine cellar, and picks out a bottle. It’s easy to choose. Draco had gravitated to the same wine both times he’d been drinking in Harry’s house. It’s some sort of rosé, Harry doesn’t bother trying to memorize the name.
Well, leave it to Potter to make Draco everything he hates about himself again.
“I’d do anything for you,” Harry had said, one day, as they sprawled across the docks of the lake, both of them covered by the Invisibility Cloak. Better to not be seen.
Draco’s practically ethereal, now. Isolated in the warm loneliness that is affection.
The man nods back at Draco, and steps back so that Draco can reset the machine.
“Best of three for Monopoly, Magic: The Gathering and, uh, Jenga,” replies Draco instantly.
“How would you know? You’ve been dead for years, and before that you were practically a hermit.”
“Yes.”
“Malfoy, yes, I died five years ago. Consider what it means that you can see me right now.”
“Yep.”
“What else was I supposed to do?”
“It’s nothing. If you really like sitting at the bottom of my well so much, feel free to keep doing it, I suppose.” As the light fades, so does the atmosphere.
He had thought Draco was using even his clothes in his, well, clearly successful attempts to get people to like him. Was that true? Or was it just coincidence that Draco targeted Ginny while in uniform, who was famous for her passion about work? Or that he was wearing Muggle clothing to talk to the blood traitor Ron Weasley? And wearing Slytherin green for Andromeda? Or was Harry reading far too much into it? He probably was.
Death turned a piercing gaze towards Harry, which was impressive for an anthropomorphic personification with no eyes.
“Don’t worry about it. Wanna hear a secret?”
“Luna, are you coming to the Manor with us?”
“I’m so sorry, Draco. The portkey only works for two people at a time, because of space disturbance concerns.”
Harry shuts his mouth, reviews what he just said, looks at Draco’s shocked expression, and Apparates away.
“Well, it’s nice to hear your voice, Draco.” she says.
Draco murmurs again, and feels the power flow through him, something so small he wouldn’t even have noticed before, but now it feels like a torrent, like everything he shouldn’t be and yet still is, like a distant circle of light above him rushing towards him. Like freedom, open air, clinging to a broom and mocking the boy across from him. He opens his eyes, and sees Harry Potter, and for a second he sees him as a second-year in Gryffindor Seeker robes, sneering back at him. But Harry is not Potter, and Draco is not Malfoy.
Malfoy moves his top hat, gliding it along the squares of the board.
The point is, it would be perfectly fine if Harry never wanted anything again, never wanted for anything, and if nothing of event ever happened again. He'd be perfectly happy, existing in greyness.
But then Ginny also sees him, and waves him over.
Draco also finds an stone well near somebody’s cottage, the weeds growing up around its circumference. He drops a rock into it and hears a dry thud seconds after. So of course, he comes back the next day with a length of rope, wraps one end around his waist and over his shoulders in a sort of harness, and ties the other end tightly around a tree, and walks his way down the well, his hands and feet pressing harshly against the stone. He makes it to the floor in less than a minute, and curls up happily like a cat in the sandy bottom of the well, the rock he had thrown into it the day before digging into his side. It’s the perfect size, about the width of a doorframe in diameter, the real world a distant circle of light above him. When he climbs back out an hour later, he takes the rock out with him, and looks back at the inviting cool mouth of the well.
“Have you heard? About what Draco said to Peasegood?” she demands.
“Alright, Malfoy. But I’m not sure how much you’ll get out of it, if you can’t try it out yourself.”
Ron? Wh- Draco?” The light spills out into the night from the open doorway, Harry standing just inside.
“It’s just people like that awful family in Diagon Alley who care, because they probably see you as a symbol, the same way they see me as a symbol. But I wonder what they’re trying to prove, and who to. Anyways, that’s about all. I hope your wand works the same. Bye, Malfoy. Let yourself be happy for once, will you?” The Howler stops.
The ghost of a smile traces its way onto Malfoy’s face, and somehow he looks happier than he had when he was doubled over in laughter with Ginny.
Yes, he’s been hurting Potter. Insulting him, distracting him, using what’s left of his affection for Draco to catch him off-balance. If exploiting the remains of a schoolyard romance will keep his mother safer, he’ll do it! He’s not a monster. Schoolyard, monster, romance, his mind recites.
“You concede?”
On his fourth visit, he finds Harry Potter standing there grimly against the well, arms crossed. Draco doesn’t even blink, but instead just stares at him warily. Potter’s wearing a Weird Sisters T-shirt and Muggle jeans.
He ends up going there every day he doesn’t have work or parole appointments, curled up in the safety of stone and far-away sunlight. Sometimes he reads in the dim light, sometimes he sleeps, sometimes he just sits cross-legged and stares up at the mouth of the well. Sometimes, looking up at that circle of light in the darkness, he feels something that might be called contentment. It's the feeling that the world in his head has finally been reflected by the world outside. So he goes back, again and again, to the dark dry well behind somebody’s cottage.
“One more thing. Remember, you aren’t, and will never be your father, Draco.”
at their hiding place, and casts a reinforcing spell on the wall.
“Cover me for a second?” Malfoy says, pulling out another flask.
“Malfoy,” he says. Draco does not reply.
Death turns away, his own scythe over his shoulder.
“I mean, it worked, didn’t it?” Malfoy replies, and starts laughing himself.
“Didn’t you say you were straight?”
him, and he doesn’t want to laugh, but he does, like a child. The magic pulses in him as the wand shines through the darkness, illuminating Harry’s grin. He’s
“You’re missing seven pounds.”
“You too, Narcissa,” he returns, as he is subtly but forcefully escorted away by Draco’s hand on his back. He tries his best not to lean back into the touch. They return to the party, which has reduced to a subdued hum. But when Draco re-enters, conversation picks back up.
Draco sets his glass down and eyes the darkening window.
“Hermione lowered the wards for me.”
And finally, Draco talks to Harry. Well, not really, more like stands around in Harry’s general vicinity, and focuses intently on incorporating large quantities of vodka into the punch.
“Potter.”
“You can spare a few friends, Potter.”
“That
” Malfoy asks.
Tom’s father speedwalks towards him and grabs Draco by the lapels of his robes. “What are you doing with my son, you little-”
At that, Malfoy regains his haughty composure. He waves his fingers dismissively at Harry. “Do what you want. You may have,” he sniffs self-righteously, “managed Luna, but you’ll never get either of
“Malfoy, did you not get reprimanded for that?” Harry asks, still a bit disbelieving.
“Well, heard you, more like. I didn’t know you sang.”
“You-” Potter stops, rubbing at his eyes, “okay, you still haven’t answered my question.” He looks up at Draco, grim ‘there shall be no nefarious deeds done on my watch’ face back again. “What were you
“This- this
Harry looks at the two of them, bent over their meals shaking in solidarity, Ginny grabbing at her own ribs and Malfoy poking at her, telling her to “stop laughing, stop laughing, I can’t stop, oh god,” and feels an intense pang of jealousy.

Potter.”
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE MY SERVICE AT THAT POINT, IT WOULD, Death struggled uncharacteristically for a moment, ALSO BE ALRIGHT.
“Which one, Malfoy?”
To Harry’s surprise, Draco's eyes fill with sudden fury.
“So… you played that while my card was on the ‘stack’?”
Draco considers this. “Sure,” he says. Potter climbs out of the well, Draco extending a hand and pulling him up the last few feet.
“He also told me a secret,” Tom continues.
“Yes, and I literally cut your chest open.”
Harry turns too, and sees Draco once again leaning against a tree, an ash tree, the irises and roses around him swaying in the wind.
Harry strolls off before Draco can physically prevent him from leaving, and begins searching through the rooms of the Manor. He’s in one of the back rooms, one with floor-to-ceiling windows, when he spots Narcissa Malfoy in the gardens, tending to a particularly gorgeous collection of deep purple roses. She’s kneeling on a cloth laid over the edge of the bed, spooning fertilizer around the roots of the plants.
“Draco.”
mine?” Harry practically hisses.
Harry decides that he was wrong. It’s not any one reflection he was drawn to, but the components within, that are rearranged time after time, forming images that are at once the same and different. He likes Draco when he’s with Blaise, Ginny, Ron, Sirius, Narcissa, he likes Draco with anyone and everyone.
When he wakes up at six in the afternoon, he walks back to the abandoned well. Why, he’s not sure. Like the corner under the staircase, and his other spots, he doubts it will be the same as it was before.
Harry walks to the doorway, standing next to Andromeda. It’s Malfoy. It’s Malfoy, wearing Slytherin green robes and singing Teddy to sleep. But Harry has no right to be annoyed by this. Draco is Teddy's cousin, isn’t he? Just like how Harry is Teddy’s godfather. And Andromeda, still watching them, looks so serene.
The next day at three, Harry Floos into the Lovegood parlour. It’s messy, but cosy, filled with strange trinkets and devices, and various comfortable-looking, sagging pieces of furniture. A dragon clock ticks away in the corner, setting itself on fire every ten minutes.
“Don’t- don’t talk to me for a second.”
There’s a pause. “That’s good to hear. Well, if you really feel the need to say sorry to me… I accept your apology.”
“What deck is this?”
so much!”
“I can show you. It’s nice.” God, oh no, why did he offer
It’s the mirrors that Harry loves, just as much as the beads and pretty, colourful things inside. Why did Harry ever want greyness?
Minutes after, or maybe days, time is always confusing in these places, He showed up and stood next to Harry, watching the skeletal fish swimming in the pond.
“He really is.” They share the kind of smile that can only be brought about by a mutual affection.
, teach me the theory at least, I need to
Harry blinks quickly and his lips part, but his expression remains the exact same, a picture of fervent relief. Only now it’s underlined with something else. His eyes darken.
“Malfoy. Please,
He begins to make himself a late supper, chopping up potatoes and dropping them into boiling water. He’ll pan fry them after in olive oil. The boil of the water and the rhythm of the knife reassure him. His wand never leaves his hand, even though he never uses it. He reaches for the dried rosemary in the cabinet, which is the only seasoning he has other than salt and pepper.
“-and the fact that you’re so fucking stubborn, and pedantic, and the fact that you’re
“Oh. That does sound awfully lonely.”
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand, you who are used to the comforts of magical life,” Draco says, grinning.
“Oh. Should’ve realized. I’m not used to feeling magic anymore.”
“Wanted to get the Trace off of you, so that I can actually teach you wandless magic.”
SHODDY WORKMANSHIP, Death thinks critically. NOT NEARLY ENOUGH CRYING CHILDREN.
accompanied by Ron pretending to be a marmoset, counts as having it in hand, Harry thinks to himself.
Harry spends the rest of the night politely shutting down anyone who tries to start up a conversation with him, and instead watches the fairy lights dancing over Draco’s hair, landing on his suit jacket, and listens to the sound of Draco laughing. Because the nameless feeling that has overtaken Harry is awfully lonely. And horribly simple.
Until one day, Death calls him, and he sees Malfoy’s soul standing there, outlined in a passageway of light, and he bows deeply to his former master, cuts through his own lifeline with his scythe, and goes gladly.
You’re weird, Malfoy,” Potter suddenly declares, and walks away. A few minutes later, Draco smells chamomile. Potter returns, balancing two cups of tea in one hand, and places one by Draco’s feet.
“Oh. What does depressing mean?” The boy continues licking at his lollipop.
So he Apparates to the Ministry of Magic, busy even at four in the morning, people bustling through its wide marble hallways. He arrives under the high vaulted ceilings of the Atrium, meets the glares of anyone who chooses to look at him, and feels perfectly at ease. He walks to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, heels clicking loudly, and pushes the door open. It swings into a modest foyer, containing several potted plants, a front desk, and a night shift Auror. Draco walks in slowly, then pointedly clears his throat until the sandy-haired Auror at the desk looks up. The man looks exhausted, dark circles under his eyes and a tired smile. Draco can sympathize.
“You’re just going to stay there?”
Then the golem absorbs the magic, and reflects it right back at Malfoy. He screams shortly, trying to dodge, but the golem maintains a steady stream of fire directly at him.
“Thank you,” Draco whispers.
Harry knows) and keeps shaking hard enough to almost fall into her thermos. Malfoy says something to her again, his eyes smiling, and she only cackles harder.
They don't fuck that night, they only kiss once, against the doorframe, and Draco doesn't play push-and-pull like he did last time. Harry wraps his arms around Draco and pulls him to the bedroom, and they drift off in each other's arms, Harry demonstrating his wandless
So it would be
“Not the time. Let’s get you to St. Mungo’s.”
“Kill me. Actually kill me.”
“What?” Harry asks again.
Today, he’d failed a Potions test. His best subject. Slughorn had given him an Acceptable anyway, but the Draught of Angel’s Trumpet had been unpleasantly thick within his cauldron. He knows he should have failed. Last week, he received a letter from his father, inquiring about the progress on his mission. A task that Draco is the worst candidate for. Draco had replied immediately and truthfully, informing his father that the operation was going smoothly. He’d successfully snuck the cursed necklace into Hogwarts. Two weeks before that, last month, his mother’s roses wilted. Narcissa Malfoy was brilliant at Herbology, and it was probably the first time a plant died in her care. Voldemort and Nagini had arrived in Malfoy Manor.
“Well, yes, ever-cutting spells are bound to leave damage.”
Malfoy doesn’t reply for a long time, instead counting his money to see if he can buy anything.
“No. Just doing my job. I don’t care,” and the three-word lie slips out easily from between Harry's lips.
“It’s also funny that the deck you happened to summon, knowing almost nothing about the game, is extremely good against mine.”
“Then do it, coward.”
“Thank you,” Harry says, startled.
“No, I’m just-” And Harry gives him that grin, full of relief and reassurance. "Happy. Proud."
“Is that what you do? Smile at people to get them to like you, so that you can get what you want?” Harry asks. He regrets the words as soon as he says them, but he’s unable to stop himself. It’s better than the other thing he wants to do.
“Draco. You’re becoming an
“I don’t know, he seems like someone important to you.”
“Draco, I don’t know why you’re apologizing
Like right now. Malfoy touches the end of his cigarette to a small flask of something, then turns around and hurls the flask at the golem’s feet. Gears within the golem clank for a second, turning its head to examine the object at its feet. Then, the flask explodes, blowing off the golem’s legs. Malfoy produces a small victorious smile.
Draco watches him, his grey eyes catching the light of the fire.
Tom scampers self-importantly back to his parents, who are now wearing identical expressions of panicked fury.
A small silver-and-crystal hourglass, engraved with the words
“I’m sorry I left. I didn’t realize what I was doing.”
Harry had thought that Draco was like a mirror, reflecting back the characteristics of the people he’s with, but he’s not. More like the three mirrors of a kaleidoscope, reflecting Draco’s own traits back in infinitely different patterns. He wasn’t quiet with Luna, raucous with Ron, uptight with Pansy, loose with Blaise. He was quiet, raucous, uptight, loose, ridiculous with all of them. And Harry wants. Wants it all, with the desperation Harry hadn’t known he was still capable of. One windy day, is that all that it takes?
“Harry? How is he? I haven’t seen him in so long.”
Potter follows him down, almost slipping a few times, and seems surprised when he hits the ground hard. He eventually rights himself, leaning against the wall opposite from Draco, the combined heat of their bodies making the well warmer than usual.

“There you are, Mr. Malfoy. Best of luck.”
“What a waste. I hate to admit it, but you were
into the stone just above them.
Go on.”
Potter looks completely blindsided by this.
“Yes, Potter.”
“Nice try, but saying that will not magic away the fact that you clearly have a complex, Draco.”
“Call me Harry, please.”
“Harry!” she calls, so Harry shrugs and goes.
How can he hope to rebuild anything at all, with no magic and a parole officer, and with barely the ability to maintain a minimum-wage Muggle job? He also finds it amusing that the Ministry found it necessary to both snap his wand and put a trace on his magic. It's not like he's some sort of master of wandless magic.  He’s also forbidden from leaving the country, associating with anyone who had even the slightest connection to Voldemort, including his own mother, or entering any establishment on a long, long list.
“Oh, what, I have to look through this whole stack of cards for

--oOo--
“Oh, what?” It's strange how friendly his own voice sounds.
“No problem,” Harry replies, “I’ll see you soon.” And he overturns the hourglass.
a few times before sleepiness overtakes him. He says things like "you'll do so well" and "they'd
“Don’t ask stupid questions, you’ll get stupid answers.”
“How’d you get in?”
Draco leans in sideways towards Harry, trapping him against the peeling white paint of the doorframe. Harry leans back, gazes easily back at Draco, and stops breathing again.
“Yes.”
“Maybe you’d feel a lot of tension, since you have such an important job to do?”
Seven minutes. He wonders how Draco will be spending these last few moments of his life. In the distance, he can see the figure of Narcissa Malfoy kneeling, tending to her flowers gracefully. Well, he might as well go and find out what Malfoy’s up to. It’s almost time anyways. He stamps his foot against the ground, hard, and the world fades into grayscale. He walks through the walls, drifts upwards through a ceiling, then a corridor, until he finds Malfoy sitting against a desk, brewing some sort of potion. He’s currently crushing aconite flowers. Wolfsbane?
Harry just wants things to be simple. Simple friendships, simple relationships, simple work. It would be nice if Malfoy could refrain from complicating two out of the three, but of course the fucker has to become an Auror and steal Harry’s friends. It’s as if he’s more suited to Harry’s life than
Draco suddenly sits up, almost knocking his forehead against Harry’s.
. He extends a hand to Draco, who gives it a blank stare.
“Oh, thank Merlin, Harry Potter,” the man holding Draco up says, evidently relieved.
“Is no one making conservation efforts?” he yells.
“Malfoy.”
Malfoys don’t get what they want.
“Pretty fucked, honestly.”
He has stolen one last dance from the stars, but the time for waltzing is over. No more threes, because war drums beat in four. Deformed, sad, spineless, lame. Draco can finally be happy in a winter of discontent.
“What, are you just going to invite Molly and Arthur to tea?” Harry asks.
“Malfoy!” he repeats, more urgently.
“Excuse me. I was wondering if you could let me know how I might apply to be an Auror?”
“Potter! I, uh-”
“Gay, Potter. Homosexual. Not into girls.”
“I have my own, Potter,” Malfoy says, yawning.
“You can use my wand. Cast something, if you want. I don’t know if you miss it.”
Malfoy gives him a mocking little wave as he declares “Malfoy Manor” to the fireplace flames and steps primly away.
Harry takes Draco’s bare wrist in his hand, and traces over the dark lines that now occupy his skin there. There’s no accusation in his face, or shock, or pain, even though there’s no way he could have known for sure.
Harry though, is that everyone who works with Malfoy seems perfectly content with this state of affairs. As if it’s just fine for Malfoys to waltz in and take up command, just like they always have.
“Alright.”
There’s a long pause, during which Draco smiles a little at Harry’s incoherent rambling and burns his potatoes. He remembers when he suffered through much of the same sort of thought process, and spent long nights frantically owling Pansy. The Howler resumes.
Draco can pinpoint the exact moment the Auror realizes who Draco is. He looks like he’s about to argue for a second, but he simply replies with “Basic qualifications include five NEWTs of at least Exceeds Expectations, preferably including Defence, Potions, Transfigurations, Charms, and Potions.”
Draco turns back, waiting.
The next day, Friday, some awful man is kicking up a huge fuss near the self-checkout area. Sarah, the high school student, is futilely attempting to resolve the situation. Draco can’t understand any of the words coming out of the man’s mouth, except for the swears. The conversation sounds something like this, to Draco’s ears.
“‘G'bye, Potter, thank you for having me,” the slur of alcohol mixing strangely with his pureblood accent.
Malfoy smiles at him again. God, Harry doesn’t want him to stop doing that. But this time, he checks himself and makes sure that he doesn’t smile back, instead accepting Draco’s rent payment with good grace.
The Auror drums his fingers against the desk, apparently deliberating. Suddenly, he shrugs, grins at Draco, and plucks a form from a pale blue folder. He slides it towards Draco across the desk.

“It would be an honour.”
read it.
“Okay. Let’s play the next game here, then.”
“Golem at 1 o’clock. I’ll cover you again.”
“Please what?” Draco walks a pace forward, the steps of the dance coming back to him as easily as the magic had. Harry stops breathing for a second, then exhales sharply.
. Harry stares. “Uh, sorry,” he says, abruptly turning away.
I certainly don’t have that, either!”
“Yep.” Draco looks up, and sees Potter’s green eyes gazing at him through his glasses. Potter sitting cross-legged across from him, leaning against nothing at all. Suddenly, he feels the exact same way as he did in the well, looking up in darkness at a circle of brilliance. Reflected, seen, understood.
Complicated. Draco’s so complicated.
Harry hands the wine to him, who accepts it with a “Oh, thank you. I love this one.” Then Draco offers his own arm in replacement of Pansy’s, and they walk together down the winding driveway to the Manor, Draco’s boots and Harry’s shoes crunching on the gravel.
Never has he heard his name said so casually, without the years of horrible decisions weighing upon it. It’s not a bad feeling. He hides a smile.
“Just cast, you arse,” he mutters.
“Oh, for
Potter seems to take a breath. “What the hell are you doing every day in my well?”
“Let go of him,” he says evenly.
“Indeed.” The Auror eyes him. “You would also have to undergo a series of character and aptitude tests.”
He wonders what Harry has been doing. Does he have a job? Any kind of work? Why does he seem to always be there whenever Draco wants or needs him?
“So they aren’t drunk enough to start the poetry readings, yet?”
OR PERHAPS, THEY WERE ALREADY CLOSE DURING SCHOOL, Death muses. He picks up Harry’s scythe, abandoned on the floor.
He talks to Ron, grinning when Ron presses another glass of something into his hand, and agrees to… recite T. S. Eliot poetry with him?
don't deserve Harry Potter swallowing hard as he looks at you. What you deserve is a well.
“Really?”

“Of course, I’m aware that my actions-”
“No, I think Draco has it completely in hand.” If a full dramatic recitation of
“Not for long. Excuse me, Malfoy, I’m gonna go acquire your mother.” And it’s all Harry can do to not follow his words with a hug, beg Draco to stay, ask him if he’s free later.
And Harry’s about to apologize profusely for losing track of time and leave immediately, but something in Draco’s quiet tone reassures him. Draco passes him a wine glass of something. It’s the rosé. Draco sips at his own glass of the same. They stand drinking, leaning against the counter side by side. The wine is tangy sweet, tastes like citrus and honeydew even to Harry’s unpracticed senses. Despite being room-temperature, the glass feels lovely and cool against Harry’s fingers. Draco’s legs are crossed at the ankles.
“Well, I no longer have hair. Or robes, apparently,” Draco remarks dully, holding up a rapidly disintegrating sleeve. “So fortunately for you, you won’t need to endure distraction any longer, Saint Potter.” Draco blinks dazedly up at him. “I like you too, you fucking idiot.”
Draco shrugs. “I had a conversation with the Muggle girl I work with yesterday.”
"That's because you're thinking with something other than your brain, Potter."
He shrugs. “A lot of people would really prefer if I never opened my mouth again.”
But Harry’s edge is short-lived: Draco has been making his own moves.
Draco drinking in ripped jeans and a navy blue t-shirt with Ron, Draco talking quietly in pale dress robes with Luna. Laughing in Auror uniform with Ginny. Singing about rain and trees, wearing emerald green on a visit to a former Slytherin. Draco everywhere. Had he been calculating his outfit choices based on who he was trying to get?
like that, all grace and deference and deftness? And then Malfoy opens the door of the study containing Sirius’ portrait. He steps through, closes the door, dusts off invisible lint off of his robes, exhales. Then looks up, and jumps half out of his skin.
“You too, Blaise? Oh. You shagged him, didn’t you? Ugh. Useless. You’re
“I don’t.”
“Sorry.”
“I’m out of flasks.”
“Hmmm. I’m really not sure.”
Draco nods, and abruptly climbs back out, almost kicking Potter in the head a few times. Potter remains standing at the bottom, cleaning his glasses and looking amused.
“Okay, Draco.” His eyes linger for a second on Malfoy’s, and then Harry stalks away to eat his lunch somewhere else. It’s only after he leaves that he realizes he said the wrong name.
“You too, Luna.” He imitates her, waving farewell to the ceiling, then heads back home.
do a better job of coding golems) and worst of all,
“Just making sure our Savior hasn’t gotten too lost,” he replies.
someone sang in a child’s nursery, a lifetime ago. A turn ago, a fractal ago.
“I don’t-”
Draco begins to feel more comfortable at work, returning greetings to the cheerful high school student who works the Tuesday night shift with him. Probably because he has finally had an actual interaction with someone who doesn’t a) hate him for what he’s done (everyone magical, basically) or b) hate him for what he hadn’t done (angry Muggle customers, complaining about bruised produce.) Strange that Potter straddles those two worlds, and yet is the first person to be willing to talk to him.
The first casualty on Harry’s side is Ron. It happens one dark rainy Friday night, the usual time for Ron, Hermione and Harry’s weekly gathering at 12 Grimmauld Place. Harry had cheerfully walked down to the door, which was being hammered on incessantly, and opened it to find Ron, his arm slung around a shivering and drenched Malfoy, both of them grinning.
Draco Apparates away.
I had a perfectly good life.  ...thank you for that.”
Harry has a life that has been more than long and varied enough, filled with all kinds of desperate wanting. Can Voldemort not kill me this year? Can I please survive this tournament? Will Ron ever notice me the way I want him to? What- ignore that last one.
So at the end of the night, Harry doesn’t notice that Draco has politely seen his guests to the door, kissing Pansy’s hand in goodbye, reaching up to ruffle Blaise’s hair, waving to Ginny leaving on a broom, promising Luna he’d sign her petition. He exchanges one last “The worlds revolve like ancient women, gathering fuel in vacant lots” with Ron (“You forgot to say ‘Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh’! That’s the best line!”), and bids an uncharacteristically stiff farewell to Hermione. Harry doesn’t notice that he’s the last one left, because he’s occupied by how Draco’s hair looks, whipped into a feathery mess by the wind through the open door. Occupied by complexities, loving the interactions that live within a kaleidoscope, turns and change and familiar strangeness.
“Cool.” Malfoy smiles at him.
In the beginning, Harry had told him all the little things. The little things you say, not realizing they’re all lies until years after. Draco remembers three of them.
Draco leans forward to take another sip of wine, then wipes his mouth, cat-like, with the inside of his right wrist.
“Hi, uh, Draco. Sorry that this is a Howler, but I just honestly didn’t think you would read anything from me otherwise." Draco snorts. Well, he's not wrong. "Look, I know I should have communicated better before I started, uh, flirting with you, but you were right. I
“Oh, god no. Let’s keep your dad off the table.”
“Like you keep saying, not the time for that.” He pivots around to face the second golem, and casts an
Anyways... that’s Blaise taken care of, who leaves with a much more amicable “see you around, Harry, and thank you!” at the end of the night
“You play stupid counterspells to stop me from doing what I want. Come to think of it, that’s very fitting. You’ve been doing that your whole life.”
“Yes,” he mumbles into his sleeves.
“Already did.”
the issue, isn’t it,
Every month, he walks into Gringotts, endures the whispered insults with long-jaded apathy, and waits patiently as others cut in line in front of him. Then he exchanges his meager Muggle salary for enough Galleons to pay the rent. He hates Gringotts. High vaulted ceilings and no places to hide. But he holds his head high, because he's a Malfoy, as little pride as there is in the name now.
A voice drifts out from the nursery, singing a mostly wordless melody that tugs at Harry’s mind, pulling him back to the warmth of loving arms and the quiet of rainy childhood nights. The song rises and falls soothingly, and Harry hears the sound of Teddy’s sleepy laughter.
Harry takes out his scythe.
“Yes, of course.” Pansy smiles at her, and slips an arm around Luna’s shoulders, Luna melting like butter into the touch. Harry begins to feel very much like an intruder.
“Draco. That night you came in with Ron? Did you... want this then?” Harry asks, breathlessly. He wraps an arm around Draco and pulls both of them onto their sides, lying horizontally across the countertop, drawing him close. Draco closes his eyes.
“It’s quite alright, Malfoy.”
He works, sweeping floors under the fluorescent lights of a Muggle grocery store. He makes sure that while he's there, he's always smiling and ready to help, even though he wants nothing more than to crawl into one of the empty cardboard boxes that were abundant in the back rooms and stay there for the rest of his shift.
“Of course. I will.”
“Three’s a good time to drop in. Thank you very much for listening to me. It was wonderful to see you again, Harry.” She smiles shyly at him, then glances upwards. “Goodbye, rafters.”
He rolls his eyes. “What I was trying to
He slides one of the windows open, steps through it awkwardly, and shuts it again. Narcissa looks up, and spots him. She stands up - but standing up isn’t the right term, not when there is so much elegance attached to the movement. She rises.
Draco remembers when Harry used to touch his wrists just as tenderly, in hidden corridors and dusty classrooms, in second and third and fourth year. Harry touched all of him, then, when Draco was his. Ankles, calves, stomach, back, hair, eyes, hands. But now, all Draco gets is Harry’s fingertips on the short lines of the Dark Mark. For a horrible second, Draco wants the lines to be a little longer, the scars a little deeper, so that he could have that much more time with Harry’s fingers tracing along them.
“When did you collect that set? I swear I had one of those.”
“Ah- No, they are. They definitely are.” Narcissa and Harry share an amused look.
Draco
Harry stares into his own glass. “He was.”
Harry grins back at her. “That sounds great. How’d you know about Blaise?”
“Don’t be stupid, I talk to lots of people. How else would the world inform me how worthless I am as a person?”
Draco sighs dramatically, and then picks a Basic Island for Harry, his fingers brushing against Harry’s. Harry swallows.
“Goodbye, sir.”
“What- how I
It soars through the air and smacks into his palm. Wandless magic.
“Yeah, sure.” Harry ducks out from behind the wall and runs into a flower bed, waving until the golem is focused on him. From the corner of his eye, he sees Malfoy chucking the flask. The golem explodes, again. Harry runs back to the wall. There’s probably about five or six more out there.
, Malfoy. Do you have any more flasks?”
“To keep! Our metaphysics! Warm!” Ron finishes, punching the air.
Harry tosses the dice from hand to hand, hesitates, then rolls. Double sixes.
Narcissa smiles, a real one that lights up her face, and turns the same smile to Harry.
He hears a pop - someone has Apparated right beside him. He whirls around and tries to dampen his instant flight-or-fight response, a simple thing, sharpened to a horrible sensitivity through years of curse dodging and Voldemort killing.
“Thank you all the same.”
“Fuck. Should we try to
“Yes.”
Harry, feeling rather intimidated, stands up and shakes her hand. And to his complete and utter shock, Luna and Pansy
And with sudden knowledge, he realizes that he walked all the way here to hear Harry say his name. His first name, free of hatred and pain, the way Sarah says it, the way Harry had said it that day in Diagon Alley, and the time before that, in the cottage.
Draco must respond, but Harry doesn’t hear it, too busy noticing how his hair is rain-wet and wind-dried, how his eyes become supplicating, how his mouth tastes like citrus and honeydew and lonely summers.
“Hiya, Harry! My oldest friend! How are you doing, sweetheart?” Her voice carries far, enough to reach the figure of one disgruntled Draco Malfoy over Pansy’s shoulder, who is currently advancing rapidly towards them.
into his ears, no small children trying to climb up him, pulling on his robes and reaching for his hair, as their parents smiled vindictively nearby, knowing he didn’t have magic, and that he wouldn’t dare step a hair out of line. Those things simply would not be able to fit, in that tiny space under the tiny staircase. And so there Draco stayed, for hours.
Anyways, it explains a lot. Kind of embarrassing that you had to tell me before I figured it out. You weren't right about the Cedric thing, though, thank God. I told Ron and Hermione a week ago, it was positively nerve wracking- wait, you don’t care about that. Sorry for ranting, but I’ve been losing sleep over this for two weeks and it’s your fault.”
He loves the house. He doesn’t change a thing about it, not the grime, nor the tiny windows, nor the tattered greyish curtains. He doesn’t even buy a bed, instead sleeping curled up in the space under the stairs, long limbs aching and cold when he wakes up.
“You fine?”
“Why not, get your own friends, instead of
us. You clearly haven’t changed all the ways you said you would, because you still show it in a really weird fucking way.”
Somewhere, a window slams open. It creates a rush of wind that extinguishes the candles and multiplies the floating fairy lights. It runs through Draco’s hair, through Harry’s, and carries Draco’s next words flying through the air.
Ginny was acceptable, but this-
like someone who would do that?” And this anger, anger at Potter, is so familiar to Draco that it slips out between his lips without any real effort on his part. Abruptly, Draco realizes he is inches away from Potter, in a well that’s only a few feet wide in the first place. He scrambles back quickly.
A few moments later, a cat stalks by, licks half-heartedly at the canned fish, and continues on. As all things eventually do, one way or another.
Draco grins at him, his hair falling all over his face.
He’s crying too, now. He pulls the vial of his misbrewed Angel’s Trumpet Draught out of his pocket. It is said that potions gone wrong have the opposite effect. He downs the whole thing in four swallows. There is work to be done. Work, work, work,
A few minutes later, Draco seems to be enjoying his metaphorical chess game with Death. “No, Potter, that’s a
“What do you
“The hell is going on here?” Potter asks.
Harry casts a quick Body-Bind on the remainder of the golem. It’s his only option, because almost all offensive magic backfires on the golems. They store it and send it back at the caster. Because Malfoy had specifically designed them that way.
Blaise!”
Harry Apparates to Andromeda’s cottage the next day, as he had promised her a week before. He hasn’t seen Teddy in far too long. He walks straight to the nursery, and is startled to see Andromeda leaning against the doorframe, instead of in the kitchen as she usually is. She turns to Harry, and smiles softly, but doesn’t move aside so that he can enter.
“Thanks, Malfoy.”
“I hope so too. Say, how’s Pansy doing?”
“Well, yes. The wards go off, you know.”
“Potter, you idiot. You would give your only weapon to a former Death Eater? Do you remember who I am? Draco Malfoy, ring a bell? Did you knock your head on the way down, perhaps? Are you suffering from amnesia?”
property? Aren’t you dead? It was all over the Prophet.
Harry breaks out of his trance. “What? Er- yes, I did
"I think I love you."
“Some things just can’t be helped, Draco dear.” Blaise flicks him in the ear. They smile at each other. Harry feels a strange tug at his mind, watching them, and walks away to the drinks counter. Draco casts a glance after him, as if he wants to follow. But he’s quickly pulled away into a conversation with Luna, who gestures wildly. Harry hears the words “ash forests” and “extinction” and knows Draco won’t be getting out of that conversation for some time. Draco nods back at her, talking loudly, making his own wild gestures and looking genuinely interested.
“Malfoy. Can I talk to you for a second?”
“What?” says Tom’s father, evidently surprised that Potter hadn’t immediately pulled out his wand and hexed Draco into little pieces. Draco gently pries his robes out of the man’s hands.
Draco waves the application in Harry’s face, and on a sudden impulse, the kind that stems from human agency and self-indulgence, hugs Harry, almost dropping the papers.
This does not seem to impress Tom’s father.
that same voice sang once.
Luna looks up at the sound of the fireplace, breaking off mid-sentence.
‘Oh, it’s quite alright, Luna,” he replies... fondly? Wow.
“Yes, sweet Salazar, you scared the living shit out of me.”
“You won’t do anything about it?”
Draco does not respond.
“Look, Malfoy, you had your time,” Harry holds out the empty lifetimer helpfully, “now it’s time to go.”
He finds an abandoned beaver lodge in a quiet pond, the branched knotted mass looming in the water like a dying beast. He swims up into it on days when the sun has warmed the water, poking his head into the inside while his feet remain on the silty lakebed, marveling at the industry of creatures long gone or dead.
“Good grief Potter, we’re dead now, stop feeding your own Savior complex and let me thank you for something!”
“Seems so. Must have been something extremely fast-acting in the cake. Now, if you’ll excuse me-” Harry raises his scythe.
“You certainly have.”
“So, is it time to compare notes? Did you get any more of my people?” Draco asks, after drinking his entire glass in one go, and Harry wonders when this game turned from something born from irritation and spite into something almost friendly.
“Yeah, Draco was assigned to be on that dragon trafficking mission with him, because, you know, department-wide fame for potion brewing skills-” Harry sighs. He has heard more than enough about Malfoy’s multitudinous talents. Harry listens as Ginny explains about the incredibly rude and rather creative insults Malfoy had thrown, after Peasegood had forbidden him, basically, from contributing to the mission at all.
“Are you going to come out?”
“Fuck. Killing curses? I definitely didn’t program
Pansy, on the other hand, is more difficult than anticipated, sitting posture stiff in her drawing room and staring thorny at Harry, holding hands with Luna. But Harry really wants her, because he suspects that him befriending Pansy would really piss Draco off.
“I promise,” announces the boy seriously.
sake, Draco.” Harry dodges into the flames and Apparates Draco back to the wall.
“He’s doing well, as far as I can tell.”
“But you’re not even an Auror yet, and he’s a- he’s a- Hit Wizard-” Ginny dissolves into laughter again.
but there you are. Not hard to come to a conclusion.” Harry fights down a flush, but Pansy’s no longer watching him anyways.
“Oh. I meant to say Malfoy, but I suddenly felt so much hatred for you that I slipped up and said your first name instead. Sorry about that.”
They walk through the overgrown weeds and grasses, along a cobblestone path, to Potter’s house. Like the well, it's made of stone brick, a one-story building with a smoking chimney and a sky blue front door. Potter opens said door for him, and bows mockingly.
“I’d like to see you try. It’s a miracle you have any friends at all, the way you carry on.”
and a whispered
“No, I do. Even if nothing I did affected you, all of it affected your godson.”
“Get. Your. Own.”
“Here,” Potter says, and he puts his hands over Draco’s, guiding the wand. The tips of his fingers brush against Draco’s wrists, his right index almost touching the Dark Mark. “
” Harry practically demands. Draco doesn’t do it, won’t do it, won’t go back to this world. He’s found safer, better worlds, like a Muggle grocery store, a hollow tree, a beaver dam, and a house shaped like a fungal growth. Like this well. Like Harry, and his stupid glasses and stupid eyes. He doesn’t want this wand, which has cast Crucio on eleven-year-olds. But then Harry puts his hands over Draco’s, and says
“Like your father?”
“Do you think the rafters are happy?”
“Did you get what you wanted?” he asks Draco.
He finds a broad, dead oak tree in the Wiltshire woods, the branches still reaching optimistically to the sunlight, a few naive young leaves still growing. But there’s a small gap in the bark, which is just big enough to allow Draco to squeeze through into the hollow, dark interior of the tree. He spends a lot of time reading by the glow of a Muggle penlight, in that cramped, quiet space.
And as if on cue, a second owl swoops in and drops a letter on Draco. He scans through it, while listening to Harry’s voice. It’s from Granger, thanking him for the apology but asking ‘haven’t you already apologized? You must have, because I forgave you a long time ago.’
“Yes, you told me. By accusing me of being homophobic.”
They stay like that for a long time, the bits of paper flowing back and forth between them, backdropped by oblivion.
ex-girlfriend, I think it’s only fair.”
Draco shrugs.
“I do have chairs, you know,” he says.
There are fairy lights all around them now, attracted to heat and emotion. They light up Draco’s hair, making it almost a silvery halo drifting around his head. His jacket fits perfectly against his body, his slacks are rolled up halfway up his calves and reveal his ankles. Draco smiles.
“Lost a bet when I died. Now I have to assist Death for, oh, the next millennium,” Harry says cheerfully. It’s always amusing when he runs into someone he knows. “Okay, I really need to cut your lifeline now.
and Draco doesn’t want to cry, but he does, like a child. Despite everything, the thrill of the magic overtakes him once again, even as it fades away, and he finds his hands will not let go of the wand.
“...yes.”
Oh- oh no. Is he developing a
“Oh, Harry, that reminds me. I’ve been wanting to show you this research on the rafters. Did you know they’re all made of magical ash trees from a particular forest? Each tree can only produce one plank, because of their irregularly shaped trunks, but the wood is highly prized. They’ve almost been logged to extinction.”
It all starts with the house. It's ridiculously thin, like a pancake, about two metres wide and ten metres in length. It's two stories. Because of its thinness, it has a staircase at the back end, with steps so narrow they were more like ledges, on which you can barely get any purchase. At the other end, there's a cramped kitchenette, which leads into a cramped foyer, which leads to the door. Draco isn’t sure how it passed building regulations, but it was all that he could afford, after the post-war restitutions on the Malfoy fortune, and the impossibility of finding work.
“Thank you,” Draco says again.
“Sure, what?” Malfoy seems to abruptly sober up.
“What?” Malfoy asks, somewhat quietly, scraping the mud off of his wand.
“It’s a secret. Dad says you can’t go around telling secrets,” Tom says, and pops his candy back into his mouth. Draco is reminded of himself, aged eleven, also parroting his father’s words. But Tom is so much better than he was.
“Were you looking for something, Mr. Potter?” Narcissa says, turning back to her supply of fertilizer.
“Understandable.”
“I’m not a bad person,” Draco says, and the lie sounds false even to his ears, but Tom’s eyes widen, and he gasps.
Harry watches him. He’s still looking down at the board. His hair must be getting in his eyes, Harry thinks. It shines silvery in the dim lighting of nowhere.
Ron and Hermione were confused. Harry had been there at night, he had went to bed, and now he was nowhere to be found. Ron had borrowed Harry’s invisibility cloak, and none of them had seen him leave. They were both extremely worried. Hermione grimaced. Ron sent her a questioning look. “We’re going to have to go to the Slytherin dorms.” On the way there, they coerced a Slytherin into giving them the password. They marched in, then stopped. The Slytherins stared at them with matching disgusted expressions. “You have to leave now,” one of the older Slytherins said, looking down his nose at them. “But-“ “Only one Gryffindor is allowed here, and that’s Potter. The rest of you can’t come in.” “But Harry- he could be in danger-“ Hermione said before putting a hand over her mouth. She supported Harry, and she knew Draco looked like he was in love with Harry, but she had her doubts. Draco had never given her reason to trust him, and she didn’t. But maybe that wasn’t a wise decision to say to a group of Slytherins. “What did you just say?” Zabini said sikily, with an undertone of a threat. “Are you insinuating that the Slytherin Prince would hurt Potter in any way?” Hermione looked down, ashamed. “I- I just don’t know, and I’m worried for him- what if he has bad intentions? I have no reason to trust him-“ “And you won’t take Harry’s word for it. My, how very trusting of you.” Hermione turned red. “How do you know that he won’t hurt Harry?” Ron said heatedly. “How do we know that Potter won’t hurt him?” “Because- because we know he wouldn’t-“ “And we know that Draco wouldn’t do anything of the sort.” Hermione let out a long breath. “At least show us what they are doing in there.” Zabini smirked. “I bet you’d like to know.” Hermione flushed an even brighter red than before when she got his meaning. Ron had gone deathly pale. “A- are they?” Zabini shrugged. “I actually don’t know. What Draco gets up to with Potter is none of my concern, and, quite frankly, it’s none of yours.” Ron shifted from foot to foot as Hermione sighed. “We’re worried about him! Could you at least use some sort of spell to see what they’re doing, and if it’s anything...” Here she paused and looked pointedly at everything but Ron. “Bad, then we’ll leave them alone. But if he’s hurting Harry, we have permission to break the door down. “What’s in it for us?” Zabini questioned, raising an eyebrow. “If he’s doing anything bad, then you can have dirt on him.” Hermione decided she didn’t quite like the malicious glint that shone in Zabini’s eyes. “Deal.” Hermione and Ron waited with baited breath. “Wait!” Hermione said quickly. “Can you... leave the room when you do it?” Zabini sent her a look. “This is our common room, Granger.” “Well, yes,” Hermione began, “But of Harry’s in a... compromising position, as his friends we don’t want you to see that.” Zabini rolled his eyes, but ushered the Slytherins into their dormitories, with a cough that sounded oddly like “Prudish Gryffindors.” With a quick explanation of how to do the spell, he left as well. Ron looked like he was being choked, and his skin was a pale shade of green. “I think I’m going to... leave as well.” He quickly left the common room and started on his way back up to Gryffindor tower. Hermione rolled up her sleeves, and cast the charm. In front of her was a circle with a blurry image in it, but the longer she looked, the sharper the image became. Hermione looked in shock to see an image of Harry and Draco Malfoy, wrapped in each other’s arms. As she watched, Draco stirred and lifted a hand up to tenderly brush away a jet-black hair away from Harry’s face. Harry smiled, and let his hand curl around Draco once more. During this, Hermione’s heart nearly burst watching this exchange between Harry and Draco,  and she quickly extinguished the spell to leave them to their own privacy. She quickly set up a protective spell, and called for Zabini to come back in. His face was full of evil eagerness. “What did you see?” Hermione pretended to look disappointed. “They cast a protective spell that wards against it.” Zabini’s eyes hardened. “Then get out of my common room, and don’t bother coming here again, Mudblood.”
*The next day*
*A few weeks later*
*The next day*
Harry was living in his parent’s house. It had been reinstated to its previous state, and although it reminded of painful memories, he couldn’t imagine living anywhere else. Harry scooped up his baby daughter, Chloe. Her wide pale grey eyes stared into his with a look of curiosity surprisingly intelligent for her age. She didn’t have much hair, but it was clear that she had inherited Draco’s silver-blond hair. The only thing resembling Harry were the shape of her eyes. They were the exact almond shape of Lily Potter’s eyes. Harry threw an exasperated look at Draco. “She looks like a copy of you!” Draco smirked. “Better that than look like you!” Harry threw a pillow at him. “Why couldn’t we have had another kid that looks like me? I’ve always wanted more kids!” “We are not having another kid, Harry! I draw the line at one!” “Ron and Hermione are coming over, so you better get your act together.” “My act is always together!” Harry turned, momentarily distracted by the doorbell. When Harry flung open the door, one arm cradling Chloe, Ron and Hermione entered, Hermione beaming, and Ron looking annoyed. “Why is there a Slytherin banner on your gate?” Harry groaned inwardly and shot an irritated look at Draco, though it was more fond than annoyed. “He keeps spelling it to that, no matter how many times I change it back.” Draco looked offended. “I’m showing pride for my house, Harry!” “We left Hogwarts 19 years ago, you twat!” “It really has been that long,” Hermione mused. “I can still remember sneaking around under the invisibility cloaks with you and Ron.” Ron gave a halfhearted smile. “And when Harry was obsessed with Malfoy in 6th year.” “I wasn’t-“ “Mate, you were checking the map to keep tabs on him at all hours of the night.” Draco looked highly affronted. “How has this not come up before?” Harry looked at Ron sternly. “And you’re still calling him Malfoy, even after all these years.” Ron huffed. “He’s still the same old Malfoy.” Hermione interjected, cutting him off. “Harry, how are things going with Teddy? I heard that you gave him Grimmauld place!” Harry smiled. “I wasn’t using it anymore, and I figured Andromeda and Teddy needed it more. Draco and I visit often, to see Teddy and to look through family heirlooms that Mundunger couldn’t manage to snatch,” Here Harry smiled ruefully. “Seeing how Draco’s the last heir to the Black name and all.” Hermione looked extremely happy. “We’ve been in touch with Neville and Luna, and they want to organize a get together soon with everybody’s family’s, at a Hogwarts reunion. It’ll be so amazing to see what everyone has been doing, all these years later. I know Rose and Hugo will be excited to come! And Harry, you could talk to Dumbledore again. Didn’t you and Draco visit the Portraits a while back?” Draco cut in. “We did. I spoke to Professor Snape, and apologized to Dumbledore-“ his eyes trailed off, seemingly staring back in time. “Harry talked to Dumbledore about a stone? I’m not really sure what they meant, but they had a meaningful conversation. Will my mother be invited to this reunion? Even after all this time people still resent her.” Hermione smiled warmly at Draco. “Of course!” As Draco and Hermione talked about Draco’s new potions career, Harry looked out of the window, to the snow gently falling on the road. Even after he dropped the stone on the ground, he could still feel his parent’s presence, surrounding him, enveloping him with warmth. Chloe moved in his arms, drawing his attention to her, and he could almost feel his parents smiling down at her. “She’s named after you, you know,” Harry whispered quietly. “Chloe Lily Malfoy.” Harry absently rubbed his scar. His scar had not pained him for 20 years. All was well.
“Stop,” said Draco. “I was about to cast Crucio, you know- you had every right to do that-” Harry traced the scars with his fingertips, a horrified look on his face. “I did tha-” Draco kissed him, Harry’s hands resting on Draco’s cold chest. When they pulled away, Draco was glaring at him. “It doesn’t matter.” Despite himself, Harry smiled at Draco and rested his head on his shoulder, which Draco promptly shoved off.
Harry stood in front of the gates of Malfoy Manor, the iron gates looming above him intimidatingly. Draco took his hand, not looking at him, and swept across the lawn to the front door, knocking on it once in an elegant manner. A house elf opened the door. She looked slightly miffed that Draco was there, having arrived without notice, but she welcomed him. They were led into the parlor, where Narcissa was sitting on an armchair. Narcissa raised an eyebrow at Harry’s presence but said nothing. “Draco,” she said curtly. “Why have you come here?” Draco looked away swiftly. “I’mdatingHarryPotter.” Narcissa’s eyebrows disappeared into her hairline. She looked over at Harry, finally acknowledging the fact he was there. Under the intense stare from piercing grey eyes, all Harry could think about was how much Draco resembled his mother. In her eyes, her glare, her surprised expression. “I love him,” Harry said awkwardly, not knowing what else to say. Narcissa looked over at Draco with an expression that was similar to pride. Harry didn’t know to be happy that Narcissa accepted him or offended he was being treated as a trophy that Draco had won. “So. Potter.” Harry’s head jerked up when Narcissa addressed him. “I heard you can speak parseltongue.” Harry was thrown by the question, but he nodded. Harry thought he saw Draco’s eyes darken imperceptibly. “Yes. Even when I was killed and the Horcrux destroyed, I still remember the language.” Draco’s eyes widened in shock. Harry knew what he was thinking. “Killed?” “I came back,” Harry said, making a shooing gesture with his hand. “Could you... demonstrate? Forgive me if I’m crossing a line,” Narcissa said to Harry in a politely bored voice, but Harry could tell by spending time with Draco that Narcissa was masking barely concealed excitement. A house elf entered the room, carrying a large cage with a great white snake inside. The elf put the cage down with trembling arms, bowed, and scurried out of the room. Narcissa advanced towards the cage and opened it. The snake reared it’s head, and started slithering towards Draco at a startling speed. “STOP!” Harry said loudly, a part of his brain registering the hissing and spitting noises he was making. Draco turned towards Harry, his face a mix of fear, wonder, and a dark possessiveness. The snake turned towards him in surprise. “Youuu speeeeakkk ttthheee tonguuueee?” “Yes,” Harry said in an annoyed voice. “Stop attacking my boyfriend.” The snake adopted an apologetic expression that looked more like baring its teeth. “I ammm sorrryyy massterrr. I wasss nottt awareeee youuuu spokeeeee theeee languaggggeee offf oldddd. I ammm honnoreeed tooo be serrrvingg youuu.” Harry looked up at Narcissa, who was staring in fascination. She was proud of Draco, for finally managing to live up to the family’s expectations. “Um,” Harry said, breaking the silence. “I think I got a new pet snake.” The snake hissed up at him. “Myyy nammme isss Salazarrrr.” “You named it Salazar?” Draco held up his hands quickly. “I’m going to be sleeping at night with a snake watching me?” “Salazar,” Harry corrected. The snake hissed in approval. “I’m going to be sleeping at the mercy of a giant snake named Salazar!” Narcissa shot her son a disapproving look. “You... sleep with Harry?” Harry turned beet red and Draco’s ears turned an embarrassing shade of pink. “I’m fine with Salazar,” Draco said quickly to avoid the question. Harry laughed and stroked Salazar’s scaly head.
"When you’re perked up, we’ll start a training for you to be able to control your powers."
Draco smiled softly and got up to dry himself. Fifteen minutes later, he was all clean and with just a boxer on, slid under the covers. Harry got rid of his sweatpants and t-shirt and joined him, giving him his back as he sighed happily. "Being the little spoon really is the best." He told himself, smiling dreamily. A cold hand brushed against his ribs, thin fingers gently caressing his waist and stomach. He felt arousal heat up his lower stomach as he let himself enjoy the fresh touch. He let out a soft moan when warm lips started playing in his neck, kissing his skin softly. As a tongue and teeth joined the dance and the cold fingers started rubbing against his groin, he started stirring, trying to get closer to the warm body behind his. He let out a gasp when he felt something harden against his butt.
Sitting down, she shot a glare at the Slytherin table. Draco and Pansy were missing. She frowned. Now that she was thinking about it, she did not see them in the Great Hall every often. She reminded herself to ask Draco about it: he needed to be strong for the upcoming kōki shinka. Harry and Ron were cheerfully talking about some Quidditch match she did not want to know about. She looked at them fondly and smiled. Harry’s brightness was starting to come back little by little. All because of Draco. She hoped things would keep thriving but with his condition… Nothing was sure.
Harry did not know what else he could say. He was so embarrassed. Why had Ginny let him fall asleep here? She could have woke him up or called someone. He sighed and got up, smoothing his clothes, before heading out of the Hall without a word.
"Draco."
"I can’t believe he really did it." His voice was hoarse from the emotion. "He even made a change in my middle name."
Flushing, Draco got up and readjusted his pants discreetly. "Might as well tell Madam Pomfrey that you’re awake then."
"Try to find information about bond. I’m pretty sure that the more powerful, the better the support. It might depend on that."
"Come back."
He handed his notes to her and she run trough them quickly.
"No mating!" He whispered in joy. "There are no mates with this species! No heat, nothing. I’m safe!"
"Don’t be. Now that my illusions won’t be there to keep me company, maybe you could." His eyes widened. "No, forget about it. I can’t get close to Draco."
"Alright, alright." She started leafing trough the volume and stopped once in the middle of it. "Here we go. I’ll read out loud. 'There are thirteen different kinds of Kitsune: Tengoku, Kukan, Kaze, Seishin, Kasai, Chikyu, Kawa, Umi, Yama, Mori, Sanda, Jikan and Ongaku. Tengoku Kitsune are heavenly and extremely rare, they can be recognised by their gold like fur and great power and can only be of pure bloo-' Pansy, can you get out a parchment and a quill and write down all the types please."
“I accept,” Harry growls reluctantly, and the line relaxes. Malfoy smiles happily at him, and Harry is suddenly struck by how wonderful it is to have someone, still somewhat human, smiling at him. Even if it has to be former Death-Eater Draco Malfoy, who is
Draco! Make some noise when you walk!” Potter glares up at him, but it’s not particularly convincing.
It’s been a bad day. Bad week. Bad month, really. Day, week, month. Draco listens to his own mind as it chants the three syllables again. Day, week, month. He’s tempted to laugh.
land. Blue, Potter!”
“My parents say you are a bad man, who did terrible terrible things, but I don’t need to worry, because if you do more terrible things, they’ll send you back to Azkaban. They say because you’re bad, it’s okay to be bad back at you,” he proclaims.
A Howler. He grabs a kitchen knife and slits the damn thing open before it explodes.
“Please, Potter, consider my situation, and then tell me why I would help you.”
Harry waits a moment for the revelation, then realizes there is no revelation, and gasps melodramatically. “
“As if it has anything to do with personal morality. It was a mere mistake. Clearly, Asimov’s rules are not sufficient.”
"What time is it?"
As they were headed back to the castle, Harry and Draco walked behind the group, willing to talk but not knowing what to say.
"That’s what I thought. I can’t wait that long, and I don’t think I’ll live nine hundred years."
"I’d need to prove I’m not my father’s son, and I don’t really want to show the world I’m a fucking beast."
"What?"
He nodded. "It’s a bit rushed though."
Pansy nodded and Hermione pursued. "'Kawa Kitsune are of the river, calm, they are granted of a steady and smooth power. Their fur will always be light grey.' We can cross this one too. 'Umi Kitsunes are of the sea and ocean, even though they resemble Kaze Kitsune quite a lot. Distinguishing them can be heard as they are both living oxymoron. The fur of a Umi Kitsune will also be of a light tint, the only thing telling the two creatures apart being the nature of their power (wind or water). Umi Kitsunes are also very sensitive to the Moon, and can easily be influenced by its cycles, just like the sea. Yama Kitsune resemble Chikyu Kitsune by the colour of their fur, they are howev-"
Draco Malfoy."
If the mother is a transformed Kitsune, the offspring won’t be able to inherit anything from their father, making them weak and impure Kitsunes - squibs if the father is a Wizard - who could live as humans if sealed properly. They would however not be able to breed, their half-blood making them sterile.
Realisation hit them all and Harry hurried to his dorm to get parchment and a self-inking quill.
"What happened?"
Curious, Draco took the black box. It was quite heavy, to his surprise. Holding his breath, he opened it. Two silver daggers were lying inside, on a black cushion. Their hilt was made of opal and beautifully reflected the light coming from the window.
"Yes, if Mieko’s tails were supposed to appear every four years and she died at twelve trying to grow three… What if I have to grow five when I turn twenty?"
"You’re only saying that because I want to hear it! You have no depth, nothing."
"I mean, it’s not that I don’t care but… Your life is more important than anyone’s opinion. Had she been against it, my decision would have stayed the same."
The bond did its thing and Harry’s legs were glued to the ground. He felt like a statue.
"You look great mate," Ron grinned, "I’m sure my mom would faint, let me take a pic."
"Hey Pansy! How did it go with that seventh year?" Teased Draco.
I have many things to tell you, and people to present you. Would you be able to join us at the Hog’s Head tomorrow?
"The seventh one is done Honey, only two to go." Harry reassured. "You’re doing great, you’re amazing. We’re going to make it, you’ll see. We’re going to be alright."
"Don’t worry, he only talked to me. And I won’t share it with anyone." She paused, hesitating. "Do you want to talk about it?"
"Lovely, lovely! As the Black Lord, I was planning on disinheriting Bellatrix and officially reintegrating Andromeda to the family… I think I could try to 'clean my late’s cousin honour' by getting her maiden name back and insist that you take that name too, cause I don’t want any Black blood to be related to criminals."
"Nope," Draco smirked, "it’s just my natural charms."
"Nope," Draco smirked, "they’re perfect. Look at yourself!"
Draco abruptly sat up, ignoring the pain piercing his skull. He was in a bed, in the Hospital Wing, and the clock before him indicated 11AM. He checked himself, happy to realise that his ears and tails were perfectly disillusioned. "Probably Hermione’s doing." He sighed of relief at the thought before a suffocating fear took over him.
Harry’s stomach tightened. Remus too had lost his life during the Battle of Hogwarts a few months ago.
"Good morning Harry!
"St- Stop…" Harry breathed. "I want you now, please…"
Draco was walking on his tiptoes in the eight year’s dorms corridor, trying not to wake up the four other occupants. He finally arrived before his room and, as he was turning the doorknob, he noticed a weird noise. He lent an ear, trying to figure out where it came form. The room next to his. Potter’s room. He broke the distance between their doors and, sticking his ear on the door, tried to hear more. Draco frowned. Was Harry panting? No, it was stronger than that. He was hyperventilating.
He was not able to finish the sentence. Draco took his clenched fist and opened it, intertwining their fingers and slowly rubbing his thumb on the back of his hand, hoping to help him relax a little.
"Of course."
"Well, he was poor and a werewolf, but what bothered my parents the most wasn’t his background. It was his gender. Homosexuality was a big taboo at the time."
"Oh."
At 10, Draco decided to head to bed, announcing he felt a bit weak, and Harry followed him, wishing everyone a good night. Even though they were able to spend the night apart, they enjoyed sleeping together and as such had decided that they would do so in the weekend. It did not take long for them to get in bed. Even though Draco had not used his disillusionment charm today since he did not leave the common room, he was exhausted. Once in his pyjamas, he tumbled across the room and threw himself on the bed before snuggling under the covers. Harry laughed softly and got changed before joining him. As they were facing each other, he took Draco’s hands and started blowing on them as to warm him up, and Draco’s fluffy ears twitched.
"I think I’m not."
"Please." Harry smiled and he left the curtained bed.
"Thanks."
Pansy obliged as Hermione got back to the book, trying not to lose her temper. "'Sanda Kitsune are of the thunder, wild and impulsive. Their fur can be of a pure white, a light yellow or a light blue. They are extremely powerful creatures, able not only to control the thunders but also lightning. Jikan Kitsune are time controllers, they can travel in it, stop it, accelerate it, slow it down. They are the most powerful ones after the Tengoku Kitsune, but their power is very rare and so prized that they had to go into hiding. Their fur will mostly be of a light colour, often a beige or a grey.' Do we keep this one?"
He was heavily blushing.
"Sorry."
Harry blushed. "Honestly… Why not."
"A transitioning Kitsune must be awaken to be able to fuel his and his bonded’s magic and power. Be cautious, awaking them abruptly might cause a confusion and be dangerous."
"A sting? I felt like I was being electrocuted."
"What the…" He abruptly straightened up. "Malfoy." He paled. "What the fuck are you doing he-" He looked around. "Wait. Where the fuck are we?"
"Really?" Draco did not managed to hide his enthusiasm.
"Hey." Harry murmured, sitting next to Draco.
"Diagon Alley." Draco innocently responded.
"What do you mean?" He frowned, looking at Harry eye to eye.
Harry, Ron and Hermione obliged.
"Alright, alright. I promise I won’t laugh."
"I do, it’s my fault. Everyone. Blaise, Ginny, Mrs. Malfoy… They all died because of me."
"I don’t think so… The book said we wouldn’t be able to leave each other’s side at first." Draco hesitated. "So don’t leave."
"Is he?" Harry blurted.
"He’s going to win. We’re going to be alright, Drake." Pansy said softly. "It’s going to be alright."
There was nothing to do, even if his status as a Kitsune made him the dominant one, deep down… "He’s quite submissive." Harry realised.
"Don’t give up, Honey." Harry murmured. "Have you forgotten about what you asked me to wait for?"
Hello, I'm back with another Drarry! I was inspired by the anime Kamisama Hajimemashita and the fanfiction Custody by @Author_Friend! (on Wattpad)
He pointed at Draco. "You."
"Yeah, why not."
"Hello guys! Glad to see everyone’s on time today." She smiled. "We’re going to be making an Essence of Insanity. Take out your books page 34 and go gather your ingredients please. You’ll be working in pairs."
"They used too much magic, they were training all night." Hermione half-lied.
"Are you sure?"
Draco’s face darkened. "But I’m a criminal too."
Harry sighed and joined their arms before they disappeared in an unpleasant and rather sickening twirl. They landed right before the shop, and Draco could not help but be amazed.
Harry shyly nodded and straightened up before leaning towards Draco’s member, arching his back. He started slowly caressing it with his hand before adding his lips, encircling the erection, then his tongue. He started playing around with it and moving back and forth. Draco was stroking his hair and soon enough was pulling on it as he was panting. The view of Harry sucking him with his back arched like that was too much to take. He growled and pulled himself out of his mouth before roughly making him turn around. He firmly grasped his waist with his left hand while his right hand was rubbing his member against Harry’s butthole.
"With a little bit of chance, I’m not a Malfoy." Draco finally murmured, relaxing his shoulders. His eyes were reflecting an unexpected hope.
Both Ron and Pansy gasped.
"I mean, I testified at his trial and he stopped acting like an asshole so I guess so. But it has nothing to do with our old grudges, Ginny… I, I killed his mom."
"Why weren’t you there at dinner?"
"But if the frequency is around two years… I’ll have to grow the eight fucking tails I’m missing. I’ll fucking die."
"So that’s why Goyle was wearing glasses. And that’s why you ran out of the common room for no reason… Well." He laughed. "I wasn’t the heir though."
"Oh Harry…" Hermione murmured. "You’re not crazy."
He blushed. "Well, it’s different, I’m sure it’s the bond…"
"Why do you need my help? Couldn’t you ask someone else?"
"I had to, we’re family after all." He softly answered. "I was surprised to see you with another member of the family though. I thought you two hated each other’s guts."
"My name’s Ro- Hmrgh."
"Can you tell me more about how this exactly happened? These kinds of things usually happen around birthdays… But yours was in June, am I right?" Draco nodded and she murmured to herself. "Why did this happen now…We’re in September."
"By the way, Ginny… Yesterday, why didn’t you wake me up or call someone? My back hurts from sleeping on the ground."
"Brilliant." Harry frowned. "Since when?"
"Really hard. In the end, even we relied on you. You were our only hope. That’s why we can’t hate your or hold you accountable. You never stopped fighting."
As Draco nodded again, he dropped on his knees and untied the white towel, letting in drop on the floor and uncovering Draco’s hard member. His panting intensified as Harry locked his green eyes in his and took him in his mouth. It did not take long for the pants to turn into moans and groans as Harry sped up the pace, licking and sucking avidly while Draco was pulling his hair. As he let out a loud moan, Harry pulled away with a devilish grin and started kissing his lower stomach, slowly rising, letting a trail of love bites on his whole torso until he reached his neck which he started nibbling and licking while stroking his erection. Draco’s dominant side took over as, unable to bear more of the sweet torture, he savagely pinned Harry against the wall, holding his wrists over his head. He licked his lips and grinned lazily then started with his revenge, sucking, licking and biting Harry’s entire body safe for his erected member.
Her praise was unanswered.
Ron, who was sitting next to him, wrapped his arms around him in a bear hug. "It’s alright mate, you can miss her. We all do." His voice was hoarse too.
His hands in his pockets and looking at the ground, he headed towards the Great Hall. Thankfully, no one was in the small common room and he could walk in silence to his breakfast. He had not talked to Ron and Hermione since the day before at dinner and was not excited to do so. He sat alone at the end of the table without bothering to check where they were. He was too tired for it. Massaging his temples, he looked around trying to figure out what he wanted to eat. The knot in his stomach decided that not eating would be better, and Harry only poured some tea in his cup. As he was drinking, he looked around the Great Hall, the routine comforting his heart.
Affectionately,
"Isn’t biologically related to me. If not both." He paled. "What the fuck."
They were not alright. After one minute spent in a separate room, Draco felt like his head was going to explode. He wondered if Harry was feeling the same, before remembering a line he had read in the book. "The price to pay for the bonded’s power, submission and honesty will be that the pain from being apart will be much greater for the Kitsune." So Harry was probably not in pain. "Yet." He remembered. His heart ached at the thought. What if Harry went to sleep feeling great but woke up in the middle of the night in extreme pain. "That’s not even the point, if you stay here you’ll faint from the pain yourself." He realised. Panting, he got out go his room and headed next-door. He did not think of knocking and opened the door on a shirtless Harry.
When he finally arrived in the Library corridor, breathless. He swore in a growl, hoping he was finally at the right place. He walked towards the library, trying to get a hold on his breathing. Once there, he politely - and silently - greeted Madam Pince, and headed towards the desks, which were unfortunately free of the student he was looking for. He sighed again, losing hope, and started walking around the different sections. It was only when he was entering the before last one that he spotted the bushy brown hair he was so eagerly looking for. He let out a sigh of relief and walked in the student’s direction.
"No." He then whispered. "Everything’s not alright."
Soon enough, a battle had started. And the eighteen years old were five again as they were throwing cushions at each other.
"Yeah?"
"Alright, Ferret." Ron smirked.
"Why would I?"
"Oh… Where’s my boo-"
"But… But you’re the real Ginny, aren’t you?"
Harry blushed at his mistake and sat up, looking at the ground in embarrassment. "I’m such an ass." He thought.
At lunch time, Pansy and Harry parted ways as he headed to the Gryffindor table, trying to figure out how to explain his situation to his best friends.
"It said she knew about it since sixth year and that I should snatch what I want and make it mine. She told me to be selfish."
"Maybe you should focus on the shapeshifting now that you know what your powers are?" Ron suggested.
They spent their lunchtime talking about the adventures of the 'Golden Trio'.
"Well, the room was pretty sad with these stone walls and worn-out couches." She smiled. "Now please sit down so we can’t start this curious meeting! Draco still hasn’t told me what it’s about."
"Alright, last one then. 'Ongaku Ki-"
"I don’t care anymore."
"Shhhh, Honey. Not here." He smiled slyly, putting a finger on his blushing	boyfriend’s mouth.
"What is it?"
"I sent them a Patronus already, focus on our magics and stop worrying."
Concerned people: Narcissa Malfoy (née Black), Lucius Malfoy II.
"It clarifies that she’s your mother, isn’t that good?"
Smiling, Harry intertwined their fingers together. "Of course."
"Interesting." Draco smirked.
"And you can’t bond with someone unless both parts are in love."
"Draco, what’s-"
"See," Sprout smiled, "peace is slowly rebuilding herself."
"Wow… Well Harry, you’re lucky you won’t have to go trough this." Ron blurted, without thinking.
Draco hummed as an answer and Harry opened the door. He was curled up in his bed and his tail was poking out of the covers.
A knot formed in Harry’s throat and he slowly nodded. He prayed all the gods he knew this was not his last moment with Draco, he prayed all the gods he knew he would not lose him tonight, and in his prayers, he fell asleep.
"Harry." Draco murmured. "Harry… It hurts so much."
Draco could not help but chuckle quietly. It seemed like the Potter he knew was not gone forever. He wiped the black hair strands out of his face and shook him again.
He leafed a few more pages, trying to find information about mixed offspring.
"Hm?"
"It’s pretty funny actually," started Ron, "cause they’re in-"
Maybe it’s time you call me by my first name too?
"Harry." Cut Ron. "Maybe it’s time you accept it."
"It’s, al- alright… Will you, teach me the, the patronus charm?" He breathed out, squeezing Harry’s hand.
"Pansy."
"Are you…" Draco tried. "Are you okay with this?"
Harry’s lips were glued together again and he sighed before nodding. He would prove his love soon enough. They started heading to the castle but something did not feel right. Draco stopped he was still holding him by the wrist when he asked:
"Anything but Malfoy would do."
"I’m only in your head Harry. I can’t interact with you if you’re unconscious, and I can’t interact with anyone. They wouldn’t see me."
"Well," Ron yawned, "maybe we should all go to sleep. It’s almost 2."
"Nice too meet you long lady, I’m Sirius."
She nodded and finished studying the page.
"It’s alright, let’s stay close until you get used to it."
"So you would like to be bounded to me forever?"
"Good." She got up and stretched. "Now I believe Draco will spend the whole day in the library like yesterday, would you keep me company."
Harry laughed softly before starting to read the instructions. It did not seem to complicated too him, but a potion taught in seventh - and eight - year was obviously not simple. Just in case, he reread it a few times.
He started kissing his neck, descending towards his collarbones he softly bit, then licking and biting his whole torso until he was knelt in front of him, kissing his lower stomach gently.
"When I realised that she was only in my head, she disappeared. It triggered a panic attack, stronger than usual. I couldn’t breathe at all. That’s when… That’s when Dra- Malfoy arrived. He helped me calmed down and held me until I fell asleep."
"Just do it."
"Padfoot!" Said Harry with a big smile. "I’m so glad you came."
"'Kaze Kitsunes are wind controllers, they can be rough and gentle, loud and quiet. They are powerful creatures and always posses light fur, from pure white to light grey, including yellows and blues. Their eyes are typically grey, even though sometimes white eyed creatures may appear. They are known to be extremely powerful when paired with Sanda and Umi Kitsunes and have good affinities with flying creatures. They are able to control not only the wind and its intensities but also to have an impact on the weather. Kaze Kitsunes can be excellent fighters if correctly trained and have the strong mental needed.’" Draco recited. "Well, promises to be interesting."
He lowered his gaze. His normally filed round nails were now long, sharp and grey. He winced at the sight.
"Ouhhh notes? Fancy."
"I’m pleasantly surprised." He admitted. "I thought I was in way deeper shit. This means I won’t be forced to bound with anyone, and won’t have to stay with the same person forever… If there’s a way to undo the blood bond."
Hermione opened her mouth but nothing came out. What was she supposed to say?
"Hm?"
Draco paled, his hands still covering his hair.
"You’re alright?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Your?"
"Haven’t your parents said something?"
He grinned, lifting his head. "You’re right, it’s pretty ugly."
Tears were rolling down Draco’s cheeks as panic started taking over him. "I’m not going to make it." He thought in horror. But a warm stream of magic filled his veins, and hope got back to him.
Deciding to go on with the lie he had not been told about, Harry nodded. "I’m very sorry Madam Pomfrey, I’ll ask him next time, even though I don’t think there will be any. This was just too tiring for me."
"You little-" Draco growled, pursuing him around the common room with a cushion.
Draco sighed but obliged, wrapping Harry in his arms and laying his chin on his head. Harry softly rubbed his back and moved away.
He tried to relax as they headed towards their common room, reminding himself that he would understand the situation in no time. When they stepped in the common room, the three of them gasped. A big bookshelf, desks and a carpet had been added to the room, as well as a couple of oil lamps. The old couches and armchairs now looked brand new - and beige again, thanks to a deep clean. Pansy and Draco were sitting in the middle one, with big grins.
"When we’ll be done will you, will you…" He winced from the pain.
"Scourgify."
Ron and Hermione were hugging Harry too, finally able to relax. After some time, everyone moved away.
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine."I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, honestly. We haven’t even found what my powers are. I wish my father was still alive… I wish there was someone who could help."
"Even if he was a Death Eater?"
"Draco…" Harry sighed, softly hugging him. "We’ll find a way. Hermione still hasn’t checked the whole book."
Hermione could never forget how Harry’s aura had changed at that moment, and how everything started shaking around him when his magic had awaken from rage.
"Why would I laugh?"
"What the fuck happened to you." She whispered.
Harry nodded and, gaining back his composure, Sirius changed subjects.
"Here we go." Sighed Harry. "Brings back memories. If I recall, there’s a balcony in the second floor’s room."
"Exactly."
"And you could die we don’t know when from extreme pain, if you don’t bond soon."
"Demand made by: Sirius Orion Black, heir of the House Black.
"Three months…" She mumbled to herself. "Are there antecedents in your family?"
"What are we?"
"NO!" Screamed Draco.
She pat his hand, not knowing what to say, and he sighed.
His friends looked at each other uncomfortably. What were they supposed to tell him? Harry kneeled behind him and started massaging his neck and shoulders. Hermione got back to the old book, followed by Ron and Pansy, willing to let the couple alone.
He started shaking. He brought his knees closer to him, burying his head in them as he hugged himself.
Harry shook his head. "No, I’m alright. Now go get dressed please, I’ll join you when you’re covered up." He chuckled nervously. "You wouldn’t want me to attack you again." His heart broke as he let out these few words. "That’s right." He realised. "I attacked him."
Draco cleared his voice and took out his notes. "It might be better that I take care of it."
"Yeah… Yeah, everything’s alright."
"Good morning." He mumbled with a sleepy voice.
"Here! Malfoy, read that!"
"Yeah," Ron pursued, "something along the lines of 'I want my nephew to take his mother’s maiden name because keeping the Malfoy name would be bad for business'"
She slowly nodded, still examining him. "I think this is all related to yōkai. Ever heard of that?"
"I don’t have brown fur, there’s no need to read more."
"There isn’t much to say. I just realised I’m fucking crazy." He blurted with a distorted smile.
They stayed silent for a moment, and he started reading again. This time, it was his turn to let out a victory cry.
"I lost Blaise during the war, you know. We were trying not to fight but there was a big explosion and he tried to protect me… A rock hit the back of his head really hard." Tears started rolling down here cheeks and in a sob, she concluded. "And he died on me. Flitwick found me there, under his body, when they were gathering the wounded."
"I wasn’t planning on getting dressed, no." Draco smirked.
"Harry…"
She angrily got up and headed in their direction, under Ron and Pansy’s amused eyes. Harry hurriedly retreated. He did not want to mess with an upset Hermione. She started lecturing Draco but he could not stop smiling at her and she gave up.
Draco started laughing.
"I’ll get in the bathroom and close the door."
She inspected him with a frown before slowly nodding. "Before that I must ask you, what training were you doing for you two to end up like that? You were okay, I think you just fainted from exhaustion but, Mr. Potter… Was in a very rough state."
While Ron nodded, Hermione silently thanked him. He was tapping his fingers on the table and his leg was shaking. He was probably the most stressed. "What’s happening?" He could not help thinking. "Is it about Draco and I? Only Draco? Death Eaters? A stupid event? What the fuck’s happening."
"Harry?"
Harry looked at the ground. "Does he really thinks I hate him?"
"The Shrieking Shack?" Draco and Pansy said in unison.
"You’re awake." He breathed, tears rising.
"The offspring should be born with Kitsune features such as ears, fur, claws or fangs additional to their tail. If the tail and features appear after birth (months or years), the Kitsune’s body will have to evolve hurriedly. This hurried evolution called kōki shinka could become extremely painful and dangerous depending on the number of tails the body has to make appear. The only thing that could calm the pain would be the support of one or more bounded lovers.
As he was snuggling under the covers, he heard a growl. He turned around and met grey eyes staring at him.
Carefully, Draco opened the second document. It was an official certificate of name change.
"Ronald." Cut Hermione.
Harry pressed his hands against his mouth and smiled sadly. "I’m the one who should apologise, not you. I went too far, I know it. I shouldn’t have teased you so much. I’m so sorry Honey."
"You won’t be a able to do anything! Stop it already." Cried Pansy.
Pansy gasped. "I’ll have dark circle under eyes tomorrow."
"Granger." He whispered. "I looked for you everywhere. I need your help, I beg you."
"Great. Explain it to me."
Draco got up and - taking off the charm hiding his fox-like features - waited for the laugh to come.  But it never came. He looked down, meeting Harry’s sparkling eyes. He looked amazed.
"You can love differently, Zee."
When the sixth tail had grown, the seventh started forming immediately and Draco gasped from the ache. Harry kept murmuring in his ear, trying his best to ease his discomfort. The seventh tail took even longer than the second one to grow, and Harry had great hopes it would be the last one. How deceived and horrified he was when he noticed than an eight tail had started growing as the seventh one was not fully finished.
"An eight years reunion?" He asked. "But we’re only five. It’s only us, Malfoy and Parkinson."
"Alright." Harry smiled. "Make me some space."
Draco laughed softly. "We’ll ask him tomorrow I guess… Until then, please don’t call me Malfoy anymore."
"It’s tiring to keep."
"Thank you." He mumbled shyly.
Harry let out a soft gasp. "What are you going to do to me?"
"I know you hate me, I know I was an asshole but I beg you, I need your help. I promise this is not some kind of trap." Draco answered with a shaking voice.
Her voice was shaking and Draco’s heart break. He had never liked Blaise, but he was good to Pansy. He always treated her like a princess. Trying to comfort her, he gently patted her head, stroking her dark hair.
"Yeah," Draco’s lips turned into a small grin, "it will."
She moved away a little, intimidated. "This is probably the last time we meet each other, Harry. Now that you know I’m not real, I’m going to be a part of your conscious. Your unconscious won’t be able to create and summon me anymore."
"I can’t believe you even made me change my glasses." Harry chuckled.
"Shhhh! You’re too loud." Hermione sighed. "But you’re right. For this to happen, one of your parents must’ve been a Kitsune under the appearance of a human… And therefore couldn’t do magic, at least not the same as ours. This means one of your parents…"
"Yeah, that."
"Well, as a fox, his fur was like white gold… So as a human, he was even paler than you. He radiated purity. His eyes were a pale yellow too. He was truly a beautiful man, both inside and out. He was very calm. He loved nature, specially autumn. Your mother taught him to read when she realised he didn’t know our alphabet, but he always preferred reading Japanese poetry, haiku’s. Sometimes, he would even write her some. But in the end, what he liked the most was music. He could play any instrument, but the most beautiful sounds he produced where the ones he made with the wind."
"Hm."
"Harry?"
"I made it."
Harry frowned. "Why would she do that?" He thought. The best thing to do if he wanted an answer was to ask.
"Harry…" His eyes were full of tears.
"Oh… And is there someone you like?" As both him and Draco turned red, Sirius started laughing. "I see, I see. Are you two going to bond?"
"We will." Draco shortly nodded as Harry was getting out of his covers.
"Harry?" Asked a sleepy voice.
"Yellow eyes… We can cross this one too." Draco concluded with a broken voice. In a way, he wished he had the same ability as his late father.
She nodded in confirmation. "Since you told us you’re bisexual."
They let each other’s hand go and Draco felt a shock in his heart. Craving Harry’s touch, he abruptly grabbed his wrist and pulled him close, wrapping an arm around his waist and running the other one in his hair.
"So," she then said, "pure Kitsunes get a new tail every hundred years… And they can shape shift in human form only when they have nine. This gives us some information about one of your parents. But since you’re half-wizard, it’ll be different for you."
"He thinks you hate him and you thinks he hates you but in fact you’re both in love with each other. That would make a nice romantic movie." Teased Ron. But when Harry’s cheeks reddened, his snicker turned to a gasp. "You love him?" He whispered.
"Would you listen?"
"She helped me with the transfiguration essay."
And just like that, they got back to it. Training and searching and reading and focussing. After a couple of hours, they gave up and headed to the Great Hall for supper. They would keep up the day after, and the weekends after that if needed.
I don’t think Harry had the time to tell you yet but I’ve told him about my… Condition. We also confessed our love for each other - we’re not going to bond just now, don’t panic - but I’m starting to feel guilty about Pansy not knowing anything about my situation and thought I should tell her. However, we are five eight years and I think that leaving Weasley out of this would be quite difficult for you and Harry. Should the five of us have a 'reunion' in the common room tonight? I know Pansy’s going to be supportive and all but I need you to reassure me about Weasley’s future reaction. I don’t want everyone to know that I’m a fucking hybrid.
He took the small case out of his pocket and gave Harry a kaiken, keeping the other for himself. After a look of confirmation, they both cut trough their left palm. As Draco winced at the pain, Harry took his hand. Joining their wounds under the moonlight, he nodded at him and together, they started reciting.
He sighed.
Hermione could not help but let out a small chuckle. "I think that something might please you even more." She then added, pointing the next sentence.
He acquiesced. "Let’s keep searching, if you’re okay with it."
"I’m sure that’s why Ginny would’ve said too." Concluded Ron. "She loved you unconditionally, your happiness meant the world to her."
"Yeah. Yeah, I am. Are you?"
"I know, I just can’t help it. Don’t you miss her? Your mom, I mean."
Argument (by Sirius Orion Black): "Lucius Malfoy is a known Death Eater and criminal. I don’t want his name to cause struggle to my first cousin once removed and to bring more shame to our family. As Narcissa had gotten back her maiden name, I think it is legitimate to ask for her son to get the Black name too."
"I never said that!"
He stopped before the big wooden doors he was eavesdropping trough last night and took a deep breath. He had wanted to spend some time with his mother’s portrait the day before, but Potter had been there. Hopefully, the room would be empty this time as it was early in the morning. Draco carefully pushed the big doors, trying not to attract Filch or Mrs. Norris’ attention, and entered. The sun was at dawn already but the room was pitch dark. Draco frowned. "Potter probably closed the curtains yesterday night not to be seen but… Why didn’t he open them back?" He flicked his wand, lighting it up wordlessly, and headed towards the windows. Half way there, he noticed something on the ground and lowered his wand.
"Well, it doesn’t hurt but it’s still… Unpleasant. As soon as you’re out of my sight, I can’t help but miss you." He sighed again.
"It’s alright Ron, we’ll know soon enough." Shrugged Harry.
"I want you." Draco answered in a growl, ignoring the finger pressed against his lips.
"Is it?"
Harry pressed their foreheads together. "You’re burning."
"Yeah, the bond kind of forced me to shut up. Seems like the submissive thing you read about is stronger than expected."
"How many times have you read it?"
Harry hummed before burying his head in Draco’s neck. His warmth felt so good. Draco closed his arms around him.
"Pansy wants us to make Polyjuice potion next to piss of a seventh year." Draco answered.
"Never."
"Hm…" Draco wanted to add something but decided otherwise. "Let’s get you some outfits Sirius will be proud of."
"Here we go again, stop with this nonsense already. Why couldn’t you? Didn’t you guys forgive each other?"
