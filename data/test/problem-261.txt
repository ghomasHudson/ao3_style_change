"See you in four hours, Pomfrey." The mediwitch nodded, not at all put off by the last name, and disappeared through that precious exit door. Draco closed his eyes, willing himself to sleep until his next round of potions was due, but his mind swirled around images of Miss Le'Galle and he imagined his trio of legal harassers moving onto Harry next. The idea of her being in the same room as his lion made his stomach churn.
"Try again, Mr. Malfoy." Prew, in all his mouth breathing glory, looked as tired and bored of this as Draco felt. Four over three hours, now, they'd sat here questioning him. His supposed 'guardian' hadn't said a word in his defense or stopped any of the questions, which only showed that he'd been handpicked for the job by the wrong side, and Draco had grudgingly acted as his own defense.
It was later that day, in their hidden hospital room, that Blaise and Pansy came to see him. Harry was still there, refusing to leave his side, and Draco squeezed his hand as they approached to get him to be nice. Both looked disgusted that Harry was even touching him at all. But as they got closer, they grew emotionless.
"What's that?" Draco appeared behind him, holding their respective morning drinks. Harry's was a vanilla and caramel latte, always carried dutifully in the Statue of Liberty mug they'd gotten on their first trip to the US. Draco's was black coffee with a spoonful of brown sugar—not white—in Harry's old Gryffindor mug. He took the drink, as well as the kiss on the cheek, but didn't try to hide the paper.
“This doesn’t have to be…” He didn’t finish that thought, but he didn’t need to. Draco’s expression relaxed into a small smile and he clicked his tongue in response.
"Right, because you wouldn't know anything about that." Her face bloomed into a smile when she realized what he was getting at, and she was clearly shocked that Harry had told him but she merely smiled at the page.
"Hey, breathe. It's okay, babe, I get it." And Draco did get it, at least as much as anyone else could understand something he didn't understand himself. Harry, of all people, knew that. He'd been the one to stand beside Draco as they watched his father's execution and he'd been the one to hold the blond's hand as Lucius was buried. Draco had cried with
“It’s true,” Luna continued. “A lot of people think you went insane. They’ve been calling you Mad, Mad Malfoy but personally I don’t think that’s very creative. Last names and alliteration can only go so far, you know?”
” He felt Harry jump at the Parseltongue, but it didn’t seem like Draco had surprised him. Rather, he seemed surprised by the language itself.
"Oh come on, Harry, don't be daft. You know exactly what it's got to do with this. The Ministry would be insane to try to go after you, especially for the murder of a Death Eater, and they know it. Already, people are praising your name for ridding the Wizarding World of such a tyrant. But Draco, he's…"
The priest said a few words that Harry didn’t listen to. He knew that the Malfoys weren’t religious—that most of the Wizarding World wasn’t religious, actually—and that the priest was probably included or just conveniently around at the right time. His attention, instead, went to Draco.
"Mr. Malfoy," The voice—hard, and male, and much too loud in such a small space—forced him to look up. "So glad you're with us once again. Gave us all a bit of a scare there, for a while. My name is Pierre Sinnett and I'm here as a representative of our Ministry's legal team to stand in the place of your guardian during questioning." The man looked like a shrub that someone had tried to trim in all the wrong places. Draco merely stared at him. His face was flat, his limbs were disproportionate, and his clothes did not make him look like he lived on a lawyer's salary.
“Come home with me.” It wasn’t a question, but he still waited for a response. He prayed that calling their flat
“Of course I’ll be there, Drake.” Just for a second, that nickname seemed to put a little bit of warmth into those grey eyes but then it was gone. Draco frowned, and Apparated without another word.
God, he wanted to run over there and hug the life out of the blond. He wanted to kiss him and run his fingers through that unfairly soft hair until the tears subsided and both of them could breathe a little easier. But Draco had already taken a big leap by asking him to be there, and Harry wasn’t going to push it. As much as he wanted to comfort and coddle, he wanted to stay on the blond’s good side even more so—and hope that maybe, just maybe, Draco might reach out to him again if he needed to. That was what mattered.
"Mr. Malfoy, I'll remind you again that you are under oath." Draco snorted, drawing the attention of absolutely no one, because the oath meant nothing. It was a plea of honesty and allegiance to the ways of the Ministry—one that he had recited with mindless grace since the age of four—and it was as legally binding as a pinky promise. They kept pushing it, though.
“You have the sweats? The red ones?” Harry nodded. He definitely shouldn’t have mentioned that, especially because he’d told Draco during one of their more hostile post-breakup encounters that he’d burned them, but it was too late now.
“Good morning, Draco.” Nothing could have prepared him for the light, drifting voice that floated across the room. What the actual—
“He really fucked you up, didn’t he?” Draco didn’t have to nod, he didn’t think he could given their current situation, because it wasn’t really a question. Harry squeezed his hand again.
"Any chance you need help with Potions homework?" Hermione granted him a little smile, but let him change the subject and pulled out a roll of parchment from her bag. Draco doubted that there was any Potions homework or, if there was, that it was due anytime soon. But, it was something they had in common and it was something he was good at, so it was easy to fall back on, especially when he didn't have Harry. He didn't want to say it, but without his lion he was slightly scared of her.
“I was going to say beautiful, actually. And before you go getting a big head on me, I meant your soul—not your looks. You know you're attractive and you don't need me to tell you that. But you have a beautiful soul, Draco. Absolutely beautiful.” Draco was crying, tears streaming down his face faster than they had in years. Harry just looked at him, though, and continued to soothe. He could not for the life of him believe that Harry had just said that and a large part of him said it was too good to be true. This was some trick, some hoax that would only crush him in the end. But Harry was there, sitting with those bright green eyes, holding his hand and reassuring him. That he was safe, that they were hidden, that he’d meant it. Draco felt like he couldn’t breathe but, for the first time in his entire life, it wasn’t for a bad reason.
"We only just got up, lazy." It was true, though Harry knew he could push a little harder this time. The letter had granted him a bit of sympathy, if nothing else, and he could use that now to pressure Draco back into their bed.
With that, he excused himself into the nearby kitchen where he found the Auror base that had been set up. Crosby was sitting at the small table meant for preparing ingredients and, since it was sized for a house elf, looked quite ridiculous. Even that wasn't enough to lift Harry's mood, though.
“Why would it have been you? Who saw the signs, I mean.” Harry gave him a wistful little smile and squeezed his hand again. Surprisingly, though, it didn’t make him anxious or make him feel like he was trapped, it actually felt secure. Like a tether grounding him amidst his emotions.
In a less official capacity, private investigators operated in what should have been a very public way. They had to advertise, meet with clients, and they had to stamp their names on every tiny success to build credibility. Draco Malfoy did none of these things. Instead, Malfoy seemed to operate solely by word of mouth and to very selectively take on clients. He had no room to be picky—Harry could gather that from his financial records, which the Ministry was incredibly meticulous about—and yet a case solved by Malfoy Inquiries made the papers once a year at best.
Harry sat silently in the backseat of his uncle's car as they drove. He was crammed in with all his luggage and Hedwig, in her cage, because the front passenger seat held a small box with a present for Dudley.
Narcissa, still crying, wiped her eyes and nodded to him before going to speak with Pansy. The women embraced, but Harry only saw the byproduct of their actions: Draco was now standing alone and vulnerable in front of the grave. He heard the clicking of camera shutters, but the blond didn’t even react.
"Yeah, I think you are," His entire body just collapsed. "You're weirdly good at Quidditch, at least, and you somehow made it through school despite never paying attention or doing any of the work. You managed to be the only person in history who is a murderer, and
"Shame none of them can actually understand Parseltongue, isn't it?" Harsh, angry blue eyes flared at him. The man looked so annoyed, as if having to deal with a temperamental toddler and not a perfectly rational teenager. Well, this would certainly be fun, at least.
It was a nice thought, but Pomfrey was already on edge with so many people disrupting her hospital wing and she'd done so much for them that Draco felt bad aggravating her any further. Even if he was moody and wanted to hit something, he wouldn't take it out on her.
Would his father really have done something like that? On one hand, it seemed far too showy and surface level but, on the other hand, it would have gotten attention off of them long enough for him to drag Draco out of there. Provided he obeyed, of course, which he hadn't. Could a person even duplicate a boggart, though? He had no idea and had never even considered it, honestly, but it gave him hope that someone like Hermione was looking into it.
"Of course I would. I'll hex them for you, if you like." Harry chuckled, ignoring the way Draco's right hand twitched unconsciously against his hip, as if trying to reach for a wand. He knew it was only partially a joke. Draco had been hesitant to get very attached to him in the beginning, and Harry had spent months convincing him that they were in this together no matter what. The second the blond had realized that, he'd become fiercely protective. Harry didn't mind it, but he also wasn't totally sure that Draco's temperament would mix well with the Dursleys and their snide remarks.
He woke up in a hospital bed, the sheets strewn around him and drenched with sweat. He thrashed, already trying to fight the fear that bubbled in his chest and trembled out into his hands from the nightmare, but a hand stopped him. It was warm, he realized, and gentle.
to our family's celebration of life! A stranger who dares to insult me on a day when we've already lost so much… You should be ashamed of yourself, Harry." That was it. He could have handled the insults and he could have politely ignored her hidden insults but that was the last straw.
"I'm glad. The Imperius curse can be quite draining, I've heard…" Draco just shrugged. "You trusted him enough to let him use it on you? That's impressive." He stayed quiet, refused to either confirm or deny anything because she could have been a spy for the Ministry, but it didn't seem to matter. Hermione was looking at him now, and smiling under her breath—if that was even possible to do. For a moment, it almost felt like Hermione was studying him with some newfound kind of respect, but it was quickly gone.
"I'm sorry to hear that." His voice was completely neutral, which Harry really couldn't blame him for. He didn't talk about the Dursleys very often and, when he did, it was usually just an offhand connection to a story he was telling about himself. Draco wasn't sure how he was supposed to react to this news, so he was waiting for some kind of clue before letting anything slip. That was one of Draco's old habits that Harry could never decide if he hated.
Draco steeled himself when he heard Hermione’s telltale voice coming towards them in the hallway, but she merely fell into step with a smile.
. God, he was a freak wasn't he? If it wasn't because of the wizard thing, or the gay thing, then it was the savior of the fucking world thing. He couldn't just be normal. Was 'freak' somehow in his DNA?
There were petunias everywhere. That was the first thought that registered in Harry's morning haze, and it seemed to be the dominant observation in Draco's mind as well. White ones, red ones, purple ones… It was like the whole service was a tribute to Aunt Petunia's suffering rather than to Uncle Vernon's death. Harry couldn't really say he was surprised, though.
good together. You're good for him, I think, and he opens up to you in ways he just doesn't with us."
“No, I like Aurors better when their feet aren’t on the floor.” The guard’s brow furrowed, but he evidently decided not to ask and merely pulled the door closed behind her.
At first, everyone had been itching for any information that could be found about Malfoy's new business. Harry had fallen prey to that same curiosity—purely because he was surrounded by it day in and day out, not because he had any interest in it himself—and had taken some morally grey avenues to learn what he could.
“You want me to go with you?” Draco took a deep breath. By now, Harry recognized the gesture for what it was—the blond, trying to stop an anxiety attack before it happened—but he didn’t let himself reach out. Even if his whole body ached to comfort the man in front of him, he knew Draco wouldn’t allow it.
Harry stood calmly in black dress robes that Draco had helped him pick out for Fred’s funeral. The cemetery was practically empty, aside from the priest and two employees who were just waiting to lower the casket. Draco stood, completely stoic, beside his mother. Narcissa was crying softly, but neither Malfoy reached to comfort the other and Harry knew that they wouldn’t until the press stopped taking pictures. Pansy was there, surprisingly enough, but she kept to herself and didn’t make eye contact with any of them. Rita Skeeter, along with three or four other reporters, mingled throughout their awkwardly spaced little group asking questions and demanding statements.
"You're a cop? Well, I have to say I didn't see you that way but I suppose I can't fault you for it. Though why they would allow you to enforce rules when all you ever do is break them, I couldn't say. I'm also not completely certain what your friends occupation has to do with my question, or with your income status. Jacob, was it?" Beside him, the blond flashed her a sickly sweet smile. It reminded him so much of Narcissa that Harry almost did a double take, but then those beautiful pale lips were moving.
"Language, Mr. Potter." Grumbling, Harry scowled across the room at the mediwitch and turned back to Hermione, determined to swear quieter. She beat him to it, though.
“I hate you…” There was no anger behind those words, though, and Harry had heard them enough times during their relationship to know what they really meant. Draco hated being emotional, and he hated breaking down in front of other people. He hated that Harry kept pushing him, and he hated that he couldn’t just shut down the way he did with everyone else—but he didn’t hate Harry.
“I mean I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner, I’m sorry I didn’t do anything. If anyone was going to see the signs, it would have been me, but even if I saw them I just couldn’t put two and two together. But I ignored them because, well, I hated you. And you pulled it off so well… I’m sorry, Draco.” He definitely was hallucinating, now, he thought, because no way in hell was Harry Potter sitting in front of him apologizing. No way, right?
Harry's whisper carried across the large, open hospital wing. He couldn't see Draco, but he kept hissing. The curtains had been drawn around another bed, as far away as possible from his own, and every now and then a quiet hiss of
"Pretty please?" He turned, snuggling his face into Draco's T-shirt as if he were about to cry. Maybe it wasn't completely true, but Harry couldn't deny that he felt unsettled and, besides, he was not going to pass up an opportunity for cuddles.
"Yeah, actually, four feet for an essay on Polyjuice Potion." Draco had to snort, even if he covered it with a cough, but Hermione had clearly noticed.
"Of course not. We welcome all forms of collaboration in the Auror department because, after all, whatever gets to the truth faster is best, isn't it?" Both Mrs. Magnolis and Malfoy smiled at that, as if social constraints mandated that they agree with him, but Mrs. Magnolis clicked her tongue.
. You're also the only person I know who can put up with my bullshit, which is a pretty freaky phenomenon if I do say so myself. But, hey, at least you're not a Death Eater."
"Bed?" Draco laughed, the sound barely audible and the vibrations echoing into Harry's body. That kind of laugh was his favorite, because it always felt like a secret. Like Draco was trying to hold it in, or be quiet, so no one else would know he was amused—even if they were alone—but he always let Harry feel it through some form of contact.
“No, not since we broke up.” Harry had managed to stun the blond speechless, and he couldn’t decide if he was proud or concerned by that. Everything about this felt far too fragile for statements like that. But, Draco had always valued honesty.
“M’cold.” Harry didn’t have to know that Draco didn’t mean literally. He didn’t have to know about his father’s cold touch or the ice Draco slammed into his own chest every chance he got. He just needed to know that he was cold, and that Harry was warm. He tugged again, until Harry got the hint and smiled.
It was Harry's turn to bite his tongue. He wanted to go off on her about how stupid it was to involve an outsider like Malfoy, let alone to do it without consulting the Aurors on her case. This was his job, though, not a bar fight so he merely forced a smile.
“And your father, too,” Harry butted in, reminding him. If they were going down they were both going down together, it seemed. McGonagall’s face didn’t change and Draco wasn’t surprised that she didn’t care, but he let Harry add in the detail anyways. Slowly, the professor spoke.
"I underestimated you, Draco." He shrugged. Honestly, he was shocked that they were talking like friends at all. He definitely didn't expect anything close to an apology from her, not after everything they'd been through, but he appreciated the friendship. It felt reminiscent of Molly, actually. An acknowledgment that they had history, but a deeper appreciation and warped sort of respect for him because of what he meant to Harry. That thought was still foreign to him, but he wasn't going to refuse the olive branch. Now, of all times, he needed the company.
"Well, Prew, I'd shake your hand but as you can see I'm a little preoccupied at the moment." He tried not to sound bitter—honestly—as he clanked the metal on his cuffs because neither Prew nor his associate had said what their jobs were and he had no idea if they were to blame for the restraints. But, Pierre at least seemed to be on his side, in theory, and he had to blame someone so his words came out harsher than necessary.
Thank you so, so much to everyone who's reviewed/commented!! It really does mean the world to me <3 As usual, I don't own HP or any of the characters, just this story/plot!
That night, at exactly twelve twenty six, Harry slid out of bed and wrapped himself in the invisibility cloak. He knew, by now, exactly how long it took him to get to the Prefects’ bathroom and he’d used the map to find every shortcut possible within their first week. Now, he had them memorized. His feet moved of their own accord and he let them direct his movement, trusting their sense of direction. They always took him to Draco, if he let them, even when they weren’t supposed to.
The Auror was frowning at him over his clipboard and the lawyer beside him was meticulously taking notes. What the notes were on, Harry could only guess.
"He seems to breathe a little easier whenever you're around," she finally offered. "I never would have thought that you'd be good together and, when he first told me, I was sure that your relationship had to be toxic as hell. But you
"He's okay—detained, but at least getting medical attention as far as I know. It isn't good though. I talked to him before you woke up and got some information for McGonagall but she had to pull some strings to sneak me in so we're both banned now. We have a couple theories I can't tell you about yet, but…"
“Because you look like home.” Draco paled, letting his hand shake as he fingered the material of the sweats that neither of them would claim ownership of, but he didn’t run. That was progress, right? He took a step closer, testing the limits, but Draco shook his head almost instantly. It was the blond who moved closer, who closed the distance between them, and who eased his robes off of his shoulders. He would have gladly left them on the floor, but Draco spelled them over neatly into the closet.
"Of course, whatever you feel is best. Although, I must tell you that if Mr. Malfoy interferes with the investigation we are conducting, I am afraid that will likely result in criminal charges for obstruction of justice. I'm sure Mr. Malfoy is already well aware of that, though, isn't he?" Malfoy merely blinked, regarding him impassively, but Harry had already gathered his briefcase and was halfway out the door. "Oh, and it's Auror Potter, Mrs. Magnolis. I'll send someone in shortly to take your statement."
He didn’t knock on the door—he’d never knocked, and he wasn’t about to start now—but Draco still nearly jumped out of his skin at the intrusion. His face was red and splotchy. Tears were carving their paths down his cheeks like canyons and his hair was ruffled in every direction. Already, he’d completely changed from the man who had just stood beside his father’s casket.
Harry wanted to march over there and put himself between Draco and everyone else. He wanted to shield the blond from the scrutiny that he was so accustomed to, and he wanted to scream at the reporters that grief wasn’t something they should be splashing all over their front page. Especially after the war…
Instantly, all three men turned towards the door. The woman who entered was tall and regal in a way that her Ministry uniform did not do justice. Harry couldn’t have explained why but the second he looked at the witch he envisioned her a very different environment—shrouded in dark robes, long hair crowned with thorns, and hands scarred by dark magic. He shook his head, noting that her palms were clearly unscathed, and tried to focus. Still, the aura of darkness followed her.
“No, he condoned and initiated it but it’s his cousin who does it.” Even if Draco was normally the submissive one in their relationship, he found himself tangling his hand in Harry’s hair and soothing him the way his lion always did when he had panic attacks. It helped, thankfully, even though Harry wasn’t panicking. McGonagall watched them with her lips pressed into a very thin, very angry line.
“One of us has to be, and it wasn’t going to be you.” Draco eased his hands from Harry’s waist up under his shirt, lingering over scars and muscles the way Harry had on the couch less than an hour earlier. Harry stayed still, afraid to break whatever was happening between them. He let Draco take off his tie, his button up, his undershirt, and his belt before he stopped him. Draco’s hands were steady, though, even as he held them.
“There’s this thing I have to go to…” It wasn’t a question, but they’d been together too long for Harry to pretend he didn’t understand.
“Thank you, Professor.” If it had been any other situation, Draco would have laughed at the way Harry maintained his professionalism with the woman no matter what. Even he did, which said something about the amount of respect the students had for her. But, when he called her professor, McGonagall’s face hesitated and then broke into a sad little smile that looked almost motherly. She reached for the boys, but seemed to think better of it. Instead, she just gave them both that little smile, letting her eyes linger on the way Draco’s fingers were winding through the brunet’s hair.
As always, I do not own HP or any of the characters! Please be kind and thank you to everyone who has commented!!
“Indeed, I have.” He stood, moving towards the gap in the curtains drawn around Draco’s temporary prison bed. “Draco, darling, may I offer you some advice?”
"Many students and professors attest to hearing you giving commands to Mr. Malfoy and using the Imperius Curse in Parseltongue. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
Now that he’d survived and made it into his third year at Hogwarts, Harry enjoyed speaking Parseltongue. He'd been scared of it at first because of the way everyone had reacted but, when Draco came back for their third year and hissed at him, Harry was delighted. It became a secret, sort of, and he and Draco spoke solely in it. At first it had been insults—the same ones Draco said in English, usually—but when none of the goons or bystanders understood Draco quickly stopped. If he wanted to insult him, he would do it in English. But, slowly, that stopped too. Until, one day, he'd been sitting in History of Magic and faint little hissing sound had tickled his ear.
” But that didn’t answer his question and Harry’s avoidance only made Draco more anxious. Had something gone wrong? Surely they weren’t trying to confront his father somehow, right?
Thanks so much for reading!! Any feedback/comments are greatly appreciated and I hope to update soon!
"Should I go?" His voice was unsteady, but neither of them commented on it. The hand on his chest continued to smooth and massage because Draco
"That's not a feeling, Mr. Potter." He ignored Pomfrey and her tutting, though, instead choosing to focus his energy on Hermione who had taken a seat beside his bed. She didn't look happy, but she at least hadn't been crying so nothing could have gone too horribly wrong, right?
Draco got them out and to an Apparition point, somehow, but all Harry could seem to comprehend was that word. He hadn't been called that since… fourth year, probably.
After a few words from Narcissa, Draco kissed her on the cheek and Apparated. Hundreds of cameras seemed to catch that moment, but Narcissa ignored it and merely repeated her earlier request for decency. For a moment, Harry thought she might not have noticed her son’s disappearance. She had, though, and made that very clear when her eyes caught his through the chaos. A single nod was all it took.
“I understand,” Luna replied quietly, sounding as if she somehow actually did. “You don’t know who she is anymore.”
Harry Apparated without a second thought, leaving the reporter questioning him mid-sentence to gawk at the spot where he’d once stood. There were pictures to document his presence, of course, but he didn’t care. They would twist everything he’d said and everything he hadn’t said until it fit whatever story they were trying to push, but he didn’t really give a shit in that moment. He knew, already, where Draco had gone.
wouldn’t spook the blond, but Draco just sniffled and nodded. In less than a second, Harry had Apparated them. They collapsed back onto the couch, and Harry drew the blond between his legs to snuggle against his chest the way they’d done a thousand times before. This was them.
Of course, none of this really mattered. Malfoy could do what he liked and Harry was content to let him be a little blond git however he wanted because, after all, it was of no consequence to him. The former Death Eater understandably kept far away from any Aurors, so it was unlikely that he would ever even run across the blond in person again.
No one other than Pomfrey came, though. The stillness and the cold quiet of his room were familiar in all the wrong ways. It felt like the Manor when his father’s ‘guests’ came to stay or the oppressive silence of the halls when even the house elfs ran for cover. It would have been a relief to be allowed to run, now.
"A letter from my aunt, sort of." Immediately, Draco perked up in his direction. If they hadn't been living together for so long, Harry might not have noticed it tucked between the blond's casual recline or delicate sips of coffee. Those gorgeous eyes were settled on him, though, and focused.
"Don't be. He wasn't my favorite person." Behind him, he heard Draco shift on the couch and then there were hands on his waist—gentle, and warm from holding the coffee.
"Yes," he mumbled, forcing the syllable through gritted teeth. There was no need to go into the war, or eighth year, or even anything about Hogwarts. Petunia didn't care, and he would only hurt himself by trying—and he knew that, really, he did—but that didn't stop the urge. She would only throw it back in his face if she knew, though.
And Draco knew his. As the tears slowed, Harry felt two hands skim up his chest and settle on either side of his neck. Draco dug his fingers in, palming and massaging the muscles that Harry always tensed whenever he was anxious. Immediately, Harry relaxed. He let his hands roam mindlessly, reacquainting himself with the body of the man he’d loved for so many years. This wasn’t sexual—and it didn’t need to be—but he still found himself tracing scars as if they might have changed and counting moles the way most people counted sheep.
“I’m listening. I’ve told you the same story at least a hundred times by now and if the Ministry can put this much effort into a death investigation for known Death Eater, I don’t understand why nothing is being done about the accusations of child abuse, neglect, and torture.”
It sounded so intense and so sincere, but Hermione was looking directly at him now. She looked slightly nervous, or a little uncertain, but she was confident in her words like always and Draco could appreciate that. He nodded to her, trying to remember the words so he could process them later when he wasn't so out of it.
“Of course. Turns out we’re not so different after all, huh Malfoy?” Draco stiffened at the last name—that was his father’s name, not his because he wasn’t his father and—
feel him—and he wanted oxygen to be the only thing that made them break apart. It was insane, especially after so long, but this still felt so natural…
"I can't answer that." She didn't have to, though, because he'd known her for years and he could read her like a book. So someone had tried to poison him after all… He'd been hearing rumors of anaphylactic agents being added in as well, which made sense given that his usual reaction to raspberries was breaking out in hives, not losing the ability to breathe. Who would even have access to that kind of ingredient, though?
"That's ridiculous and you know it!" Pomfrey coughed in their direction, and Harry reluctantly lowered his voice. "If Snape's upset, it's because he lost Lucius's power, not the man himself. He is Draco's godfather but a lot of good that's done anyone. Hell, he's probably saying I staged the whole thing to get us moved back up here to the hospital wing or something." Harry expected Hermione to berate him, or at least give him a disapproving look for talking about a professor that way, but she just grimaced.
"Of course, babe, anything." The best—or possibly worst—part was that Draco meant it completely. He would do anything to help, including let Harry ignore and avoid the problem all morning instead of just making a decision, but in that moment Harry didn't really care.
“You sure? I hear I’m pretty irresistible.” They were teasing, and Harry might have even called it friendly banter or flirting. With Draco’s palms on his chest, though, he didn’t care what they called it as long as they didn’t stop because this felt so horribly familiar…
“Okay.” Harry undressed quickly and took his boxers off, as Draco had requested, before lying face down on his side of the bed. He heard a soft huff of discontent from the blond, who maneuvered them to the center of the bed and straddled his upper thighs, but there was no ultimate rebuke so he stayed still.
"Okay, um… He sleeps on his stomach? He's really protective physically, like putting himself between me and other people. He's funny, I think, and really sarcastic. He swears all the fucking time but does it in Parseltongue so everyone thinks he's an angel. Um… He isn't ticklish. He likes to cook, but he doesn't do it very often. " She nodded, soaking that answer in, and Draco tried to focus on how neutral her body language was. Maybe it was intentional, or maybe Harry had coached her before all of this had happened, but he appreciated it immensely.
"No, of course not, everyone knows that that title is mine," Harry chuckled, even if his eyes never left the letter. "But he was still your uncle." He nodded, letting Draco settle against his back and tuck his chin over Harry's shoulder. Of all the people in Harry's life who had lost family, Draco was one of the only ones who had even the slightest chance of understanding the situation. Harry severely disliked Uncle Vernon. He had since he was a child, and he'd never went as far as to call that feeling hatred but it was certainly negative. Still, he felt the loss.
“Harry.” He turned leisurely, not at all on guard or suspicious of the blond even though he probably should have been. They’d been broken up for almost a year now, but he still couldn’t make himself distrust the one person who knew him better than anyone else in the world. The microwave dinged, but he left it for now.
“Of course I’ll go. What’s the event?” As much as he wished it would be some Ministry gala or some promotional ceremony, he knew Draco wouldn’t have come for something so tame. No, if Draco was here and asking for help, it had to be something bad. Something that the blond didn’t trust himself to face on his own.
"No, not tonight." Secretly, Harry wondered sometimes if Draco said no because he feared a relapse, or if he felt like he had to babysit Harry. It was just so unpredictable… He knew Draco wouldn't tell him if it got bad, and that alone made him question every motive the blond had.
” Harry had gone quiet and slightly pale, though, and Draco squeezed his hand because now he was worried. Why wouldn’t Harry tell? If McGonagall got that protective over Draco, someone she didn’t even care about, then clearly Harry had to know she would spare no expense to protect him. Besides, if one secret was out and they were already facing the consequences… Might as well get it over with, right?
Instinctively, Harry turned away just as Draco pulled off his undershirt. The blond laughed. God, Harry had missed that sound so much… It was light, and happy, and one of the purest things he’d ever heard. For years, he’d
I have returned from the dead! Turns out moving to a new country during covid is an ordeal in and of itself but things are hopefully calming down now and I truly hope to be able to post and update more frequently/regularly now. Enjoy!
"Why just him?" Hermione gave him a look. "I mean, why are they just going after him? Why not both of us?"
“I'm so proud of you, Draco.’ Draco's heart stopped. He’d heard wrong, right? He had to have heard the boy wrong because there was no way he’d said
"Malfoy?" A head shot up, and those piercing grey eyes Harry had spent a year and a half of his life obsessing over met his own. His throat closed, and he couldn't remember how to form words. He should say something—he knew he should, if only to show the blond that his presence didn't bother him in the least, even though it did—but thankfully Mrs. Magnolis beat him to it.
Slowly, he took stock of the room he was in. It resembled what he imagined a cell in Azkaban might look like and was very effective at isolating him. He hadn’t spoken to Harry in what felt like years and the absence festered in him like a wound. Minnie hadn’t been allowed near him since the last incident and clever Hermione, after being found out for gathering information from him, had been banned as well. Hell, at this point he would have even taken a visit from Weasley.
"I didn't cast an Unforgivable Curse." Even Minnie gawked at that, stuttering and stumbling over the words as if Draco didn't know what he was saying. He did know, though, and even as the Minister shushed Minnie and asked him to repeat himself, Draco knew exactly what he was saying.
“Is an almighty Slytherin asking me for cuddles?” Draco flushed bright red at the word and the jeer in Harry’s voice but the smile was still there, and not at all malicious. He was teasing him, Draco realized, but it was almost playful. No anger, no hatred. That alone made Draco whine and pull the other’s arm again but Harry just laughed.
“I'm proud of you.” He couldn't believe his ears. There was no way. There was no fucking way that Harry Potter—savior of the entire wizarding world—was sitting here in his hospital bed saying he was proud of him. No one had ever said those words to him. There was no way they were coming from anyone, let alone Harry Potter.
"Mr. Malfoy, you're denying using the only curse known to cause instantaneous death while showing no outward symptoms?" Even the scribe who was dutifully writing every word they said looked doubtful, but Draco took a deep breath. Remember the plan.
Hermione was studying him now. It reminded him vaguely of the way a mindhealer might look at him from their stuffy leather chair but he didn't squirm under her gaze. Her face was neutral—completely blank—and he hated that he couldn't get a read on what she was thinking. But it didn't take long, thank Merlin, for her to speak.
"Slow down." Harry didn't question it, and immediately put the bottle back in the center of the table. Draco was calmly eating his mac and cheese, watching him with mild interest, but Harry knew better by now. He knew that the blond was very carefully monitoring his every move. Between the two of them, Draco was the expert on alcohol so Harry never argued whenever Draco told him to slow down, or even to stop. His goal wasn't to keep Harry sober, after all, it was just to keep him alive.
“Yes, and especially when their eyes aren’t all crossed and blurry like Nymblum eggs. They’re so stressed… I wonder why.” But her tone did not sound like wonder at all. It was high and airy in a way that suggested she cared as much about the guards’ emotional wellbeing as she did about the Daily Prophet’s editorial page.
Of course it couldn’t be that easy, though. The creamy envelope appeared out of nowhere, materializing on the counter in front of him, but he still didn’t see it right away. When he did finally notice it, he had to smile a bit. Draco had always known his routine, and the timing was no coincidence. If the deep green wax seal with an intricate M carved into it hadn’t given the sender away, the loopy handwriting on the front of the envelope would have.
“Boys,” McGonagall’s voice was surprisingly calm and full of warmth, but Draco still managed to flinch. “Everything is going to be okay. I’m so proud of you both for telling us, which I’m sure was very hard to do. Things are going to get very complicated very fast, especially with your father’s influence, Draco, but I want you to know that everything is going to be okay. We’re going to go to a safe location, soon. If it’s alright with you both, I would like to accompany you and bring Madame Pomfrey so she can assess and treat your wounds. Normally, I would suggest that you two be separated and quarantined for questioning in order to preserve evidence but it looks like that won’t be an option?” It was a question, but Harry still clutched Draco so hard that it nearly suffocated him. “That’s settled, then. We’ll be leaving soon.”
Okay I'm sorry in advance that this is so short... Enjoy though! I don't own HP or any of the characters.
Draco had no idea who the hell John and Mary were but was beyond the point of caring. No aspect of how Luna got her information, processed it, or expressed it made any sense to him but it evidently did to her. He shrugged and glanced over to the wall where a window should have been. They’d sealed it with stone, though.
I don't own HP or any of the characters! Longer (ish) chapter and warnings for PTSD flashback/panic attack.
Harry was late getting home, like always, and he wanted nothing more than to walk in the door and collapse right then and there but he knew he couldn’t. He had to at least eat something, or he wouldn’t be able to sleep for long. Grudgingly, he threw a freezer meal into the microwave. Two minutes to cook, thirty seconds to eat, and then he could go to bed—burnt mouth and all.
"Hey Draco, can I ask you something?" Fuck. Draco knew, of course, that the questions were coming but that didn't make it any easier to face. What if she asked about his father? Or, worse yet, the killing curse? He just shrugged, though, and put all of his energy into his keeping his face impassive. Hermione was a friend—sort of—but right now it was him and his lion against the world, regardless of anyone else. Apparently, he'd been silent long enough to be seen as an agreement.
“No, don’t stop.” It didn’t hit him how uncharacteristic that was of him to say until he saw Harry’s surprised expression but he didn’t let himself shrink in on himself. Not this time. Not when Harry had been so supportive and protective and comforting. Harry relaxed a little at the squeeze and a hint of his smile returned. Good, Draco couldn’t help thinking. He liked the smile.
"Good, I'd be disappointed if you did. Besides, baby," Again that 'baby' that said Draco's light, playful tone did not mean that he wasn't taking it seriously. "You've known me for over a decade. Have you ever once seen me with someone 'normal'?" He shook his head, burying his face back into Draco's chest in lieu of answering out loud. Of course it helped—Draco always helped. He wasn't cured, and he was by no means steady or secure in himself, but he was better.
"Of course they were! I heard Bella's voice and—" Quickly, the Gryffindor lay a hand on his arm. His voice had risen in volume and he realized suddenly that she probably wasn't supposed to be with him, let alone feeding him information. He closed his mouth with a sharp
“I’m pretty disciplined,” Draco murmured, trailing his lips over Harry’s collarbone. “You, of all people, would know that.” That was true—just a calm, average fact—but the way Draco said it sent shivers down Harry’s spine. He did know that Draco had excellent control of himself and his emotions in nearly every situation, but he also knew exactly how to break that control. And Draco knew he knew.
“And they smell like you. What’s your point?” Draco just stared at the material in his hands, his eyes wet yet again. Sometimes Harry wished that they shared some kind of mental bond so he would be able to tell what Draco was feeling without having to play this guessing game, but then again maybe the guessing game was just part of their dynamic. He was usually pretty good at it, at least. Wordlessly, Draco unfolded the sweats and traced each letter: P O T T E R.
"Harry, so glad you found time in your busy schedule to come show your support. And you brought a guest, I see." Harry stiffened, half waiting for the pinch of Uncle Vernon's grip on his arm or to be hauled off to his cupboard. Neither came, though, and he felt a subtle, direct warming charm hit his side. Draco's way of comforting him without touching him.
"Actually, Aunt Petunia, since you asked, neither Draco nor I need to work. We would be bored, though, so I work for our government's law enforcement and Draco brews rare, specialty potions." Petunia frowned, her face creasing in the corners the way it used to whenever Harry set the table the wrong way. The room was filled with people, Harry noticed, but they all seemed too far away to reach, as if they were avoiding Petunia too. Figured.
“I wouldn’t have come here if I didn’t trust your intentions.” Wait, what? Harry reeled, but those grey eyes were just resting calmly, staring back into his own without an ounce of hesitation or fear. Was that… permission? He tried to test the waters a bit by bringing one hand up to cup Draco’s cheek. Instantly, those gorgeous eyes fluttered closed and Draco leaned into his palm. God, that surrender… It was so much like old times and Harry really just wanted to kiss the life out of him but he didn’t want to scare Draco away.
The blond was completely stoic. To anyone else, Draco might have looked bored or even angry that he had to attend the funeral, but Harry knew better. Draco wasn’t emotionless, he was just complicated. Harry, though, saw the tremors in those soft hands, and he noted every hard swallow that constricted that pale throat. He caught the wetness in those beautiful grey eyes and he watched attentively as Draco blinked it away.
"Mr. Malfoy," The mouth breather finally began, stepping into view. "My name is Mr. Prew, and this is my associate Miss Le'Galle. It's a pleasure to meet you." Draco narrowed his eyes a bit, sizing up every detail he could find from the cat hair on the man's suit to his peculiarly small feet.
I really am not the best at humaning so while i love the sweet author's notes idk what to say so um - thank you for reading and things should pick up after this. Again if you have any ideas I'll totally look into them! Right now I'm trying to figure out how to fix a huge plot hole rn and I truly do want to punch past me. Anyways see you next week and please do your best to stay safe and healthy!
At first it was the shouting. The screams of how he was a disappointment and a disgusting blemish on the Malfoy family tree rung throughout the manor halls on a daily basis. Lucius would yell about his son's infraction for what seemed to be every moment he was home only stopping to curse out his wife who's inability to produce a second heir matched with the cultural disdain amongst pure-bloods for second marriages cause his massive anger towards the woman. The sound of his voice when aided by the amplifying charm spell Sonorus was deafening and yet anyone at the Malfoy's doorstep was none the wiser due to a simple Muffliato spell surrounding the manor. Soon however Lucius seemed to deem the shouting ineffective or maybe he found it wasn't traumatizing for his taste so he began a new faze - dancing. At the mere thought of the act Draco drew his hands into fist and dug his own nails into the palm of his hands in an attempt to save face even while swimming in his own memories of the spell's doings. Much to his disdain for a while it seemed to Draco that his father found pointing his wand at a mere child who's eyes had not even finished shifting from a baby blue to sterling silver and casting Tarantallegra. A few times his father went as far as to have Draco 'dance' under the curse for house guests during his father's meeting with other former Death Eaters. Still to that day Malfoy Sr. would use the spell on his son occasionally and laugh as his legs spasmed uncontrollably but before it had been a near daily occasion. That is until one Narcissa Malfoy stepped in and Malfoy Sr.'s victim count doubled.
"So, I'm sure I'll be swore to secrecy soon and a lot of the details haven't come out yet but I wanted to let you know what I could before I have to take an oath. Your father is dead. They tried to revive him, of course, but with the curse that you
. They’d spent at least a hundred nights like this, after Harry had had a particularly hard day or if Draco had been particularly needy, and Draco had long ago memorized his anatomy. He knew every muscle, including which ones Harry overworked, and he knew exactly how to relax them. The blond worked slowly, leisurely, drawing it out as if they had all the time in the world. In that moment, they did.
That single step was all it took to completely shatter the resolve that either of them had. Harry met him halfway, and Draco buried himself in the black robes that he’d helped pick out as if he could disappear into the material. The tears came readily, but Harry just tangled a hand in his hair and held him. This was them. This was the routine that they’d developed and followed for three years of funerals and sentencings and heartache. Three years…
“Wormwood root. Boiled into a tea. Newest treatment for aftershocks of crucio. Supply is already en route, be sure to get it to the high risks first.” Blaise nodded his understanding.
Draco looked good, relatively speaking, but then again he’d always been pristine and beautiful, even when his own life was falling apart. His eyes were bright, still, but a little more tired than they should have been. They’d both had trouble sleeping after the war and the trials… He was dressed in slightly informal dress robes—the kind he wore every day at the Manor, and the kind that Harry would have ripped off of him the second he got the chance when they were together.
so you're lucky that he's even here. Secondly, maybe I was raised in a stuffy, overly polite household but isn't it common practice to be
It struck Draco with a disturbing amount of clarity just how true that statement was. He had never known his mother outside of Lucius’ reign. They’d had moments throughout his childhood where he thought he’d glimpsed the real Narcissa or when they’d been alone and he could see her discontent, but so much of her being revolved around Lucius. Everything she’d ever done had been calculated to fit around Lucius’ desires.
"I'm well aware of that, Howard, which is why I find your complete disregard for legal procedures and investigational integrity appalling. I've answered your questions, and asking them each twenty times will not get you twenty different answers, even if you don't like what I've said. You've got your information, and I've got healing potions to take. However, I'm the one strapped to a hospital bed and you're the one in the chair so, as much as I would love to stand up and walk out that door, I'm afraid the ball is in your court."
"I think we should go." Harry watched, waiting for that statement to have some sort of impact, but Draco just nodded.
Part of him wished that the blond felt safe enough to just Apparate into their flat—because it was still
time. Monday through Thursday, Harry belonged to the Ministry at all hours of the day and night while Draco slaved over cauldrons and potion ingredients. On Saturdays and Sundays, they did chores and hung out with friends and were generally lazy but they were also usually social.
"Ah, again you are mistaken, Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy will not be working with you, he will be looking into things privately. Without Ministry interference. I trust you can stay out of his way?" Harry wanted to hex her. He gave them both a sickly sweet smile and decided he had had quite enough of this snobby bullshit for the time beings.
“Stupid.” Draco finished, sneering and not even noticing the nickname. “If anything I put those kids through hell. I taught them to survive beatings and curses and how to refuse the dark mark but all I ever really did was prolong their suffering or doom them to hell on earth. Two fourth years didn’t come back from winter break this year, did you know that? I told them to refuse no matter what, that I would have their backs if they just sent a letter, and their father killed them. I'm so fucking stupid I just made it all worse.” But Harry was still beside him, running his hand up and down his arm comfortingly until he stopped speaking.
"Thank you. Did they at least get any of the Death Eaters into custody? Were any students hurt?" Hermione frowned and picked at her cuticles.
Fridays, though, both of them went in late. They spent the morning completely and utterly alone together, doing whatever the hell they felt like, and it was honestly the best part of Harry's week. Trust the Dursleys to ruin that.
“Sensitive…” Draco whispered. “You act like no one’s touched you in months.” Harry knew he should leave it, and he knew he should let those words dissipate into the air like all the others had, but he couldn’t. He wanted Draco to know, even if it pissed him off.
Immediately, the blond straightened and stepped closer, wrapping an arm protectively around his waist while those steely grey eyes settled on Petunia. Up close, he towered over the woman and Harry couldn't believe he hadn't noticed that before. The arm around his waist squeezed in a half hug, which he greatly appreciated. They were drawing the attention of almost everyone there.
Luna smiled. She seemed to think that that was a good answer and Draco felt a rush of relief. It didn’t matter if it was his father or a Ravenclaw a year younger than him, he still got that flood of fear whenever he thought he’d angered someone.
“Harry?” Just like before, Harry hummed to show he was listening but didn’t take his focus off of Draco’s hand. “I… Thank you.” Harry just nodded, still smiling.
The funeral ended, and the coffin was lowered into the ground. Workers began filling in the dirt like they had timecards to punch and didn’t care that the grieving family was still standing right there. It was the family of a Death Eater, though, and Harry knew that that was what let them be so blatant about it.
again, Bartholomew, that I've answered this question multiple times and don't plan to change my answer anytime soon. I didn't poison anyone, and I didn't orchestrate any kind of plot to poison anyone through a third party either. I was incarcerated, same as Harry, and spoke to no one but the guards. You should ask them about it. I've heard witnesses can really be key in this sort of thing, you know?"
“Dirty, dirty mind. I was merely going to get you into your pajamas.” Harry chuckled, still hesitant but glad that Draco was okay enough to joke with him like that. They both knew that Harry slept naked. It had driven Draco crazy during the first few months of their relationship because Harry was a natural blanket hog and he’d used Draco being dressed as an excuse. Now, though, it was normal. Or, at least it used to be.
She was a widow, aged 57, and she was as close to pureblood as one could get without actually being one of the sacred twenty eight. Though the list and many of its prejudices had been thrown out after the war, the wealth remained within the older families that hadn't been wrought by reparation fines. It was understandable that she would be drawn to someone like Malfoy.
Lucius had been cruel from the start. Though they'd seemed nothing but close when Harry had first met them, there was more than enough truth in the way Draco just shattered after his death. Slowly, as if he didn't really trust it, and then all at once. It had hurt to watch because, as much as there was hurt and grief in those grey eyes, there had been much more relief. A guilty sense of security, knowing that both the protector and the threat were lying dead in the same coffin. Harry knew that guilt better than most.
Draco couldn’t remember much of what happened after Harry said that name. There had been a lot of confusion, and a lot of chaos. A lot of panic on his part, too. He remembered McGonagall yelling—a lot of yelling, now that he thought about it, which was unusual for the calm, collected head of Gryffindor—and he remembered her physically slapping someone, but he couldn’t remember who. Draco was shocked, honestly, by how protective the woman suddenly seemed. It was likely because she loved Harry, and Draco was apparently part of a package deal so he got included haphazardly. But he’d never seen the woman so angry.
“Draco, I cannot stress enough how it important it is that we be completely clear on what you’re saying. You’re telling me that Vernon Dursley has sexually assaulted Harry?” His lion stiffened, but Draco was more than prepared to take the questioning as he was sure Harry had done for him because they leaned on each other. It was what they did.
“I came to check up on my godson,” he answered smoothly, as if that were obvious. “In spite of your recent actions, I am still your godfather.” Draco forced himself to breathe. He was well aware that Snape’s memory of this conversation could be used by the Ministry and he dug his nails into his palm to avoid reaching for his wand. It wasn’t there, of course, but he still ached to have some kind of defense. Even just being able to curl in on himself would have been better than lying there exposed.
“Sorry, I won’t call you anything but Draco from now on. Is that okay?” He nodded, and tugged on Harry’s hand. “What? Is something wrong? Are you in pain? I can call Madame Pomfrey if you—”
Already, people were asking why he was there. He’d come prepared with a story, explaining that, even though he and Lucius had never been friends, he’d still known the man and was saddened by his death. When asked if his Azkaban sentence or if his receiving the Kiss changed Harry’s opinion of him, Harry had merely glared. Did how he died make him any less dead?
"No, I'm not allowed to talk to anyone about the case and he's still completely enraged from the scene in the Great Hall. He's grieving. People are saying that Lucius was his best friend and since he's Draco's godfather, that maybe he's next…"
“Of course I love you, idiot.” They both smiled a bit. The warmth Harry had fought off earlier came rushing back but he let it this time, convinced that he deserved to feel it. Because Draco still loved him. He’d known that on some level, of course, but it still felt unbelievably good to hear it.
“Mr. Malfoy, what do you mean?” Now or never, right? He could feel Harry moving closer, acting like he was going to stop him or intervene somehow, so Draco just blurted the first thing that came to his mind.
Harry had always hated how formal his lover was, but he learned to see the value in it. Draco used it as a defense mechanism and, the more he’d began to open up, the more Harry appreciated everything that it hid. The blond was many things, but well adjusted was not one of them.
Wordlessly, Harry handed over the sweats. They were a deep burgundy color with the Gryffindor crest on the right thigh and the word
Draco stopped, not sure where he was going with that sentence. Did he think she would blame him? Surely she had no love lost for the man who had made their lives hell since before he could remember. Was it her disapproval of Harry that he feared? She would be displeased, naturally, but anyone could make exceptions for the chosen one, couldn’t they?
He took Draco's hand, trying to ignore the way his own was trembling and hoping that the blond wouldn't notice. They made it to the door before the screaming started, and then it was Draco against the masses as a massive game of tug-o-war raged between them two sides. Draco won with a well timed, softly mumbled 'depulso'. That was the wrong move though, apparently, because then the screaming narrowed into one word, and it was all Harry could hear.
"Oi, what's got you up in arms, Potter?" Harry grumbled and took one of the bagels that someone had brought for the team. It was stale, and only pissed him off more.
One step, two steps, three steps… Harry could have run to him—and he wanted to, more than anything—but Draco’s head snapped up and he froze. Slowly, Draco’s expression relaxed a little and he bit his lip. Was that permission? Before Harry could even start to take another step, though, the blond gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head and looked back to the grave.
Sitting in the hospital wing, Draco was left alone. He hadn't expected any visitors—both because security was tight, and because none of his friends would be caught dead speaking to him anymore—but the silence still stung. The whispering stopped as the Aurors went to question Harry for a second time—which was completely unnecessary, in his opinion, but whatever. Regardless, Draco was left just waiting there. He was content to hear Harry's muffled voice, even if it wasn't Parseltongue, as a sort of soothing background noise.
SO been really busy stressed and SCARED lately (I'm jewish & black and i live in a major city in America so uh yea) but ALSO please please please help me find a beta if you can!

Stay safe and stay healthy!
This horrific thing started with a small, thin, sickly nine year old boy simply wrapped up in a thick blanket attempting to ride out what seemed to be a nasty cold. Draco curled in on himself in the ancient arm chair beside the fireplace in his family Manor's oversize library and shook. The hot and cold flashes had started a bit over a week ago and had only progressed in severity since. From any other child the repetetive quick tempeture drops would have been enough for a one way trip to Mugo's healing center but Lucius Malfoy insisted otherwise. His father had stopped bringing his son to the hospital for such things a few years prior claiming it would only further progress the othering of his son in the future. Even at eight years old however Draco realized he was different from the other children due to how often he got sick and the severity of his suffering but this felt different somehow.
Maybe Malfoy threatened his clients into secrecy? But that didn't make any sense. Malfoy would want the publicity because past testimonials were the only form of currency when it came to reeling in new clients. It was more likely that the clients themselves demanded confidentiality and Malfoy merely obliged them. Just from the few that Harry had heard of he could gather that Malfoy worked in some very high-profile circles.
“I’m sure you have a weakness.” Pale eyebrows rose in his direction, but Harry didn’t back down. Draco had come to him, Draco had started this conversation, Draco had put them in this position, and Harry was not going to stop it. The blond smirked, but eased himself back a bit.
They’d done this so many times… This was how they’d used to lay when they made up after a fight and Harry’s entire body begged for the part that should have come next. He wanted to feel Draco—
"No, I'm afraid you're mistaken," Mrs. Magnolis said politely, but with an undercurrent of irritation. "The Malfoy family and I have been acquainted for years, yes, but I've asked Mr. Malfoy here in a professional capacity. He will be conducting his own investigation separately from the Ministry. I do hope that isn't a problem, Auror?"
He would have liked to have said that her anger did nothing to him, that he just shrugged it off because she wasn’t his head of house and she couldn’t do much to him, but it hit him hard. All anger did, the more he realized it, and when she yelled it turned his blood to ice. Draco shuddered and shrank into Harry’s side, but the Gryffindor just put his arm around Draco’s shoulders and held him close. Thank Merlin, Draco couldn’t help thinking.
“Oh, no definitely not. They’re lumpy and the blue clashes horribly with the orange of the stems. They smell like rotten mushrooms—did you know mushrooms can rot? But they’re rare and difficult to find, which is it’s own kind of beautiful.”
Despite many attempts, Harry had never understood that particular quirk. Nevertheless, he watched the timer on the microwave and waited for the soft
Harry couldn't really say he was surprised when he got the letter in the mail announcing Vernon Dursley's death. Since before he could even remember, his uncle had been the walking epitome of health issues and, between his horrid obesity and his staunch refusal to so much as go for a checkup, Harry wasn't shocked to read the frilly, romanticized cause of death.
Draco couldn't talk much, still. After everything that had happened, Harry was shocked that the blond had managed to speak at all, let alone to be questioned. He could hear them, though, vaguely talking behind a few muffling charms as they questioned his little dragon. Minnie was with him, thank Merlin, and he could hear her voice cut in every now and then even if he couldn't make out what they were saying, but that meant he was left alone to face his own inquisitor.
Death Eater." Draco shrugged, but he wasn't fishing for pity or compliments. They were past that by now, anyways, and instead Harry tried to hear the honesty. It was difficult.
Draco knew his body. He alternated between massaging different muscle groups and teasing Harry’s stronger erogenous zones. Harry was hard, and about thirty seconds from humping the mattress, when Draco ground against him again. This time, though, he was much more direct. The blond knew his body, for better or for worse, and managed to grind the entirety of his erection into Harry’s prostate through the sweats. Harry spasmed on the bed, earning a low chuckle.
“The yelling, the insults, the beatings… the rape.” His own stomach lurched and Draco almost keeled over right there because he’d never let himself use that word before. It was always assault or use or even violate… Calling it rape made it seem so much more real. But he couldn’t let himself get caught up in that because he could hear Harry sobbing now, almost as strong as he could feel it, and he’d said his peace so he returned to his lion where he was kneeling on the floor and joined him. He fully expected Harry to push him away, to hate him forever for what he just did, but the Gryffindor welcomed him. They fell into their usual position, Draco sliding into  place in Harry’s lap to nestle against his chest, but for once it seemed like Harry needed to hold onto him more than Draco needed to be held.
Harry tried not to feel slighted. He knew why Draco wanted him to keep his distance and he didn’t blame the blond, but his chest still ached at the rejection. It wasn’t about the reporters—or at least not completely—and he told himself that again and again as if that might make the situation sting a little less. Draco didn’t want to be emotional in public. They both knew that the second Harry tried to comfort him, he would just break. Already, tears were threatening to fight their way out of his eyes if he let them. Harry just moved back to where he’d been.
“I don’t want to overstep or make this sexual, but can I please kiss you?” Draco hesitated. He pulled back enough that Harry could see the battle waging in his eyes between yes and no. They both knew it wasn’t a good idea. It wasn’t safe, it wasn’t detached, and it wasn’t what they’d agreed to when they’d broken up. But, then again, neither was the funeral.
They stepped into the reception hall, and immediately a hush fell over the room. He couldn't tell if it was because people somehow recognized him, or because Draco always drew that kind of reaction in Muggle crowds. Either way, the attention was clearly on them and it wasn't long before Aunt Petunia found them.
"Absolutely not, and I don't know how Snape expects any of us to, honestly. You'll help?" He smiled, but it wasn't a question really. It wasn't asking for help on a Potions assignment, and it wasn't even admitting a lack of knowledge to the enemy. It was Hermione, establishing their friendship without Harry. It was Hermione, reaching out and offering an platonic sort of peace, not for Harry's sake, but for his.
“Because we broke up for a reason, Harry, because it hurts and because I miss you and because you talk about me like I’m the love of your life when we haven’t spoken in months. You can’t fucking—” Harry twisted and caught Draco’s wrists before he could start beating Harry’s chest. He held, even as Draco struggled, but then the blond collapsed onto his chest and smeared tears across his skin as if they might soak in and heal their hearts. Draco was shaking terribly again, but Harry just hugged him.
“I never thought I’d see the day…” he mused, but he pushed Draco over so he could fit on the bed too. “The one and only Draco taking me into his bed. Unheard of.” Draco laughed, even if it was choked with tears, and Harry seemed to like that so he didn’t stop. Normally, he would have stifled or crammed it full of contempt. But Harry actually seemed to like the fact that he was amused?
saved them. You took this shitty situation and the hell that you were living in and you used it to help people. You're so…”
"Yeah, we'll see. Is it okay if I think about it and let you know tonight? I don't want to waste any more of our morning on this." Draco sighed and, for a second Harry thought he might argue. But he just nodded and stepped back.
"Yes, the bagel, Crosby, don't you know you should always insult your food before eating it? No, I mean Malfoy!" He was being an ass and he knew it, but he also didn't particularly care. Crosby was good-humored and wouldn't take it personally. Harry would take him out for drinks later to apologize.
"Are you going to testify if they ask you to?" That wasn't the question he'd meant to ask, but the words slipped out nevertheless. Hermione didn't even stiffen.
"Alright, alright, don't make that face at me I'm coming." Harry thought he heard Draco mutter something like
"Well, I would congratulate you but you always did thrive on doing the bare minimum, didn't you? Our dear Duddy graduated from Millbrooks this last year and already has a job lined up. He got his Masters, such a hard worker, and his starting salary is already six figures. What is your compensation like?" Harry could feel the waves of anger coming off of Draco, and he was starting to regret coming at all. He'd underestimated the sheer hostility that his aunt would have towards him and he could only imagine seeing his cousin now.
Draco grabbed her hand a bit tighter than he had intended and quickly removed them from his collar before turning away from the girl. Anyone else would've seen such things as an obvious dismissal and left the boy alone but Pansy refused to be brushed off that simply. Ever since her parents had told her she was betrothed to Draco and would become the next Mrs. Malfoy after graduation she had not let up once in her attempts to get closer to her future husband. In all fairness she actually had done quite well for herself as no one else other than his own mother could say they were able to touch him without him flinching and turning on them to either verbally or physically act out. From time to time he would still flinch under her touch or freeze as if a blush of her fingertips had the same effect as the Petrificus Totalus spell but most times unless she caused him pain he didn't have any outward negative reactions. With this in mind she had no qualms wrapping her arms around him from behind, closing her eyes and resting her chin on his shoulder in an awkward, one-sided, backwards hug. Surprisingly however he stilled under her touch causing her to open her eyes to find one look at his collar from this angle to make the cause clear. There just below his collar was a sickly swirl of deep blues, purples and yellows in the shape of fat fingers that she was sure were connected to a larger print of a fully adult hand.
She sat back and leaned on her elbows trying to steady her heart beat. Mentally the Malfoy went over every last name she knew starting with a P that could belong to a child around Draco's age. 'Maybe Parkinson?' she thought before stilling and looking down at her boy in pure fear. 'What if it's… no. It can't be even an option' she shivered  and made up her mind.
"Draco… Draco you're doing it again." Pansy whispered while waving a hand in front of his eyes, snapping him out of his daze only for him to find that the girl had moved in front of him and was holding his tightly clenched fists.
He shook his head at the silly idea and shoved his blanket to the floor suddenly too warm for the deep green fleece. He frowned slightly when the heat didn't subsided but instead continued to steadily grow. Draco uncurled himself in the chair and placed his feet on the floor only to realize when he looked down he was badly shaking. His breaths began to grow quicker and shallower as the heat began to rise higher in his chest and began burning at the tips of his ears, nose and fingers. His breathing temp reached the point of hyperventilation when the heat began to burn at his chest like a fire. This had never happened before. Draco didn't know what to do.
Many things happen at once after this. Draco slumped helplessly in his mother's arms and all but passed out. Narssica Malfoy on the other hand jumped into action by grabbing her son's wrists to check them. All Veelas got a temporary mark after their first wave of their mate's initials. It would be on their wrists most commonly or in unusual cases it would be located somewhere around their neck. The mark would last as long as it would take for their mate's soul to accept the Veela's meaning it was a toss up on time. Most times it took at least a good half hour but already her son had gone against all expectations so she acted as quickly as she could. The older Malfoy near rolled her eyes when she came to the conclusion that the mark had appeared on his neck making one more thing that was unusual about it all.
Draco pursed his lips and sighed before addressing the girl in a strained voice, "Hello Pansy. I'll join you in just a moment. I just need a bit of time."
Narcissa leaned down, placed a kiss on his forehead and spoke against his eerily cool skin, "Come My Love. We must go get your supplies while your father is way on business for the weekend. You'll leave this place for Hogwarts soon enough. You'll be safe there."
n the two years since Draco Malfoy's first many things changed and in his completely blunt, honest opinion none of them were even remotely good.
"I'm quite sorry Pansy Darling but Draco and I must be going to Hogsmeade now. Your parents are waiting for you by the floo dear." Narcissa declared clearly as she stormed the room only pausing to tip her large sunglasses down to the tip of her sharp nose to examine the conflicted look on the young girl's face, "Do you have something to say Pansy Darling?"
She nodded looking down at her sweet boy sadly knowing the chance that he would never get to be with his mate was higher than she would like to admit in the moment. He smiled slightly at the prospect of having someone love him like Pruet loved Marionette before his face once again curled into a terrifying silent screaming horror. She pulled him closer into her chest partially to comfort him but also to hide the terror of a look her son wore.Her little Veela had come into his first wave earlier than she had ever heard of before and it had already lasted much longer than usual which were all signs of how strong he and his mate would be. It was amazing to see and would be for the best in the long run but his body was already weaker than most to begin with. She hadn't even had a chance to warn him. The older Malfoy shook her head and refocused her attention on studying the boy's gestures only to realize he was beginning to clutch at his chest.
Immediately as Narssica Malfoy stepped out of the floo she felt that something was terribly wrong. Before she could even step out of the large fireplace to investigate however she heard a loud sob from within the Mansion and froze in fear. The second scream however caused her to fly into action. She walked quickly out of the floo, her dress robes billowing behind her and her discarded bags hitting the floor loudly. Her walk slowly became a jog and then a run before becoming a full on sprint as she searched for her baby boy with in the large Manor. Her husband had placed sound scattering spells on the Manor years prior to confuse an intruder in case of attack but it had completely backfired in this moment. The woman grabbed the arm of a nearby house elf as it tried to run past her and pulled it to face her roughly before leaning down to it's level.
Draco sneered at the stricken girl as if daring her to say anything. The small hard faced girl darted her eyes back and forth between the two very intimidating pure-bloods before her and nearly began to shake from the pressure before she simply tore her eyes away from the two just to look at the ground timidly and shook her head quickly before mumbling a quiet 'No Misses Malfoy.' Narcissa hummed quietly before gesturing towards the door as a clear dismissal for the young girl. The two Malfoys watched as the Parkinson girl scuttled out of the room only shooting one quick sympathetic look over her shoulder towards Draco before she disappeared around the corner. The older Malfoy looked down at her son, walked closer until she stood right in front of him and stroked his hair lightly, grimacing when he flinched slightly before relaxing. They truly did need to leave but even she knew she had acted rudely towards the girl although it was for good reason. When she came in the look of horror, sympathy and sadness had given Narcissa more than sneaking suspicion that the topic of her son's injuries was at hand. While she knew it would be healthy for Draco to confide in someone other than the house elves at the end of the day they had a reputation to uphold not to mention the wrath Lucius would unleash if he heard of Draco telling others about their private matters.
Like hell he was! From what he'd been told and what he could gather from snippets of outside conversations, the raspberry had been a targeted hit. The elfs that worked in the Kitchens were probably all being detained and questioned, but why? As far as Harry was concerned, he knew exactly who had orchestrated the attempt on his life. If anyone was going to be collateral damage, it was that slimey excuse for a godfather and anyone else who dared stand between him and his little dragon.
Instantly, Draco stopped. Harry's hand tingled where he'd touched the blond's arm, but Draco gently closed his mouth and calmly turned to him as if nothing was happening. It was kind of unnerving, honestly, but now wasn't the time. Instead, Harry just squeezed a bit and nodded that he could take over. He could, right?
. Out of all the people in the world he’d expected to turn on him, Ron and Hermione had been his dauntless supporters. They’d always had each other’s backs, but now? Apparently asking them to accept Draco—who was a bloody
Bracing himself, Draco looked up. He was expecting Prew, but hoping for Pierre or Pomfrey. Even Miss Le’Galle, with all her dark intelligence and malicious sneer, would have been a more familiar and tolerable sight.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” He blushed unconsciously, but refused to be embarrassed by this.
“Hey, how are you?” Harry wasn’t sure why he even bothered, because he knew the blond wouldn’t return the pleasantries. Since the breakup, he had tried to contact his beautiful ex at least a hundred times—only about half of which had been while drunk—and Draco had been firmly against even writing to each other. The blond wouldn’t have come without a reason, and a good one at that. Still, Harry found himself inspecting the man in his kitchen.
“Hey, it’s okay, don’t panic or anything. Five minutes won’t make a difference, right?” Draco nodded, anxious for answers. “Pomfrey gave you a sleeping draught so you would rest. Dumbledore wanted to know what happened so I told him and McGonagall what I could and Snape nearly went for Lucius’ throat right then and there. Dumbledore stopped him, though. Whisked your father off to a cell somewhere to face the aurors when he’s revived and made sure we got to the hospital wing. I tried to tell him about your friends and everything but they didn’t care. McGonagall listened, though. She got everyone we could think of into hiding and they’re safe, I promise you. We’re in hiding, too, actually. But we’re safe and so are they, hear me Draco? We’re safe.” He nodded, but didn’t totally comprehend the words until Harry caught a tear on his cheek. Why was he crying? There was no reason to be afraid—not more than usual, at least—and there was no imminent threat so why was he crying suddenly? Harry smiled, though, and it hit him. Relief.
"Aunt Petunia, this is Draco Malfoy." Immediately, his aunt turned up her nose at what must have sounded like a Wizarding name—which it was. Draco's shoulders tensed, but he said nothing.
—he needed to know that Harry was okay. If Harry was okay… The logical side of his brain stepped in, though, and reminded him sharply of where he was and how much of his sanity was riding on seeing his lion at the end of this. He shook his head, and Luna merely blinked at him.
"Hey, hey, it's okay. Look at me, baby, we're okay. We're home now. Do you want to sit up and get some tea?" As good as that sounded, Harry shook his head. Tea wouldn't help with this. He wasn't sure that anything would, honestly, but he buried his face into the pillow and tugged at Draco's hand. They'd been together long enough, and it wasn't a complicated signal, so Harry soon found himself joined under the covers by a fully clothed blond. He curled wordlessly into Draco's chest, not caring if he smeared tears all over the white dress shirt.
"You want tea? Or some food, maybe?" Harry smiled a bit, even if he kept it hidden, because feeding him was Draco's way of being a mother hen. He shook his head, though, and found one pale hand with his own.
"Hey, mind if I join you?" Draco jolted, more than shocked to see bushy hair and Gryffindor-red robes standing in the break in the curtain. Why was Hermione here? Part of him couldn't help wondering if she'd been sent by the Ministry or one of the Aurors to play good-interrogator. But, it was Hermione reaching out so he nodded, taking the risk. She sat beside his bed with a little sympathetic smile.
“Life wasn’t always picture perfect with my aunt and uncle. Broke a lot of bones over the years. Missed a lot of meals. But that doesn’t matter now and, regardless, just know that I see that fear in your eyes and I get it. I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner.” Where had this Harry been for the last six years of their education? Draco felt like he was dreaming, even though he knew he’d just woken up from a nightmare, but Harry just smiled. Had he ever seen the boy who lived smile so much? It felt like Harry was trying to blind him with it.
It was no secret between them how particular Draco was about physical contact. The friends he’d had in school who had been allowed to touch him were either dead or had drifted apart  with time. Growing up with his father, Draco had always shied away from physical contact unless it came from his mother. They’d worked hard, for months, to get to a place where Draco was comfortable touching him, even in the most innocent ways, and Harry had loved it. He had no doubt that Draco was just as desperate for human touch as Harry was to keep him there.
” Harry gave him a disbelieving look that said Draco had missed something again, some normal human thing that he would have expected if he wasn’t so fucked up. He shrugged it off though and resolved to let Harry explain it later. Regardless, McGonagall was upset and it wasn’t because Harry had told her about the Dursleys—
"Aunt Petunia," he tried again, trying to make his voice sound as if he were speaking to a delinquent first year. "And Dudley, as I presume you're somewhere nearby listening. All three of you were horrible to me as a child and I don't want to speak ill of the dead but I was hoping that things had changed. You are still my blood relatives, even if you are rude and unwelcoming. I came here to mourn the loss of my uncle, not to be insulted by the woman who raised me. Thank you for the invitation, but Draco and I are clearly not welcome here so we'll be leaving now."
“You would know, wouldn’t you?” His mouth was dry and his lips throbbed with his every heartbeat but he wouldn’t push any farther. This was more than he could have ever hoped for, and he was terrified that even an inch further would shatter it before his very eyes. Draco watched his expression, eyes flicking from feature to feature, but ultimately backed off. He was still smiling a bit, though.
“You’re staring, Harry.” He was, but he didn’t care. It was like they’d stepped into a time machine and gone back a year. Everything in the bedroom was exactly the same because Harry hadn’t dared to get rid of Draco’s things or even move them out of place, but Draco was the finishing touch. His shy little smile made Harry want to tackle him right then and there. This was the Draco that only he got to see.
"He's what, 'Mione?" She just looked to the floor because they both knew what she was going to say. He was a junior Death Eater, he was the son who'd killed his father, he was the Slytherin who'd tormented Harry in the public eye for years, and he was widely hated because of his father's reputation. No one would bat an eye if he was convicted or, God forbid, executed.
“Harry? What are you doing here?” But Harry smiled, obviously pleased by his first name, and the hand he had on his arm moved to intertwine their fingers on his chest. Why was Harry touching him, though? Didn’t he know? He’d seen the curse and Draco had assumed it was pity that made him comfort the snivelling blonde but he was still there? Still touching him, even when he knew how pathetic Draco was?
” Wait a minute. Draco stopped completely and turned to face Harry, forcing him to meet his eyes. McGonagall was this upset because Draco had been hurt? But why did she care?
"Where's Harry?" Hermione had said he was okay, and Draco desperately tried to trust that, but he couldn't help asking. The question just slipped out like some kind of confession.
"It's because I get it. He isn't hiding it from you, necessarily, and he isn't keeping things out of spite. It's just one of those things… You can only really understand if it's happened to you and I get it. That doesn't mean he doesn't trust you, though, and that doesn't mean you aren't still his best friend." Draco was not good with emotions, usually, but he was very good at reading people and he saw the thoughts written in the Gryffindor's face. She gave him a pained little smile.
"I think that was their hope." Draco didn't respond, but Harry felt his disapproval in the air. Ever the aristocrat, Draco was a stickler for punctuality and polite formalities—like sending invitations with ample time to make schedule adjustments, or signing letters personally. The blond glared at the piece of paper, no doubt noticing the typed print and the lack of any handwriting or personalization.
"It's time for your potions, Mr. Malfoy." He nodded and didn't even make a face when they tasted like vomit. His presence was already a burden, given that Pomfrey had to personally tend to him and Harry and couldn't let anyone else pick up the slack—as a precaution given the raspberry incident. She hadn't seemed bitter, but Draco could guess that she wasn't thrilled about the change.
Finally, Draco sighed. Harry was sure that he’d decided against it and was about to launch into a long speech about making this into something it wasn’t. He braced himself, even as Draco sighed again.
but he couldn't be sure. For now, he didn't mind it, though. He let all thoughts of the funeral or his relatives leave his mind as he dragged his boyfriend back into their bedroom and snuggled into their bed. Finally, just the quiet morning he'd been hoping for.
Draco breathed deeply—in and out, trying to expand his lungs as much as he could. A healer had taught him to do that after he’d taken a particularly nasty dueling curse as a child and he’d never forgotten it.
Draco doubted that highly. Minnie was probably worried—their vow weighed on the woman, which Draco tried not to think about for very long—and Harry was probably sick with fear. No one else would care.
"Actually…" No. There was no possible way, right? Was he actually spreading lies like that to the rest of the school, to the
. He’d laughed at the formality of it the first few times, until he’d realized that the full name was part of a charm so that only he could read it.
are worth it to me.” Draco was crying steadily, now, but Harry didn’t care. He tangled a hand in those blond strands and merely held him, having said his peace.
“Hey, you’re okay. Just breathe.” He obeyed without even realizing. Who was touching him, though? Pomfrey hadn’t touched him, at least not when it wasn’t absolutely necessary, since the incident in third year where he’d had a panic attack and none of the professors would dare lay a hand on him. Would they?
“Of course, anything.” Draco winced, and only then did Harry realize what he’d said. That had always been his response to anything Draco had ever asked of him, because he knew how much it took for the blond to ask for help and he was never going to refuse something that important. He shouldn’t have said that now, because they weren’t close and he didn’t know Draco that well anymore, but he didn’t take it back.
“Drake…” This was familiar in all the wrong ways and Harry wanted to throw up. He ached to reach out, now more than ever, and the only thing stopping him was the knowledge that Draco would instantly push him away. The blond was unsteady at best, and Harry knew he had to wait for Draco to come to him.
“I knew you weren’t okay.” Draco forced a deep breath, but Harry could already see that it wasn’t working. He knew better than to rush the blond, but he couldn’t just stand there and watch him suffer so he wordlessly held his arms open. For a second, Draco just stared at him. Then, he took a step closer.
“Draco, you’re telling us that Dudley Dursley has sexually assaulted Harry?” He nodded. “And that your father, Lucius Malfoy, has sexually assaulted you?” That one took Draco longer to respond. Old fear boiled up and screamed at him to lie, to make excuses, to do anything to save the story he’d spent so many years spinning, but Harry squeezed his hand. Draco nodded.
“Because I get it. Our situations weren’t the same, obviously, but I get it. I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner.” Draco wasn’t completely sure he could believe what he was hearing. Potter was sorry?
to work because there was only one other person in the world who could speak Parseltongue and they were never going to get Voldemort in front of the Wizengamot. They could pull memories all they wanted, but they only had Draco or Harry to translate them. And they could test their wands a thousand times, but the only thing they would be able to see was the shield charm he'd cast using both wands after the duel. This had to work, didn't it?
Narcissa returned quickly, aware that her son was being baited and pressured, but Harry couldn’t help the urge to go over there himself. He stayed where he was, though. The elder Malfoy, trained in social niceties as she was, asked the press to show respect and decency by leaving them alone. They didn’t, of course, but it at least made a nice quote.
Harry just cried and held him tight, occasionally shaking his head, but it was enough. Even if Harry never forgave him now Draco could at least die knowing he would be protected, that he would be safe. He risked a glance at McGonagall and Pomfrey, where they hadn’t moved. The head of Gryffindor house looked like she was seconds from passing out, and Draco watched her chest stutter over each breath as if she was struggling to comprehend anything at all, least of all what he’d said. Pomfrey was red in the face and shaking.
“I have a favor to ask of you.” Instantly, Harry’s full attention was on Draco. He, of all people, knew how much the blond hated reaching out or relying on others—let alone asking for help from his ex.
AN I don't own HP or any of the characters! Thank you so much to everyone who's commented/reviewed!!! Please no flames!
Harry was very, very stupid. Evidently, Draco knew this because there was homemade mac and cheese steaming on the table and an offering of hard vodka beside it. Predictably, he'd let work overtake his life for the twelve hours that he was on the clock, and he was only just now pausing to remember the decision he was supposed to have made. Dammit.
to one another during hard times? Like, oh I don't know, a funeral? Call me unobservant, but you don't seem very supportive." The room was silent now, listening to the blond because he'd put on his Malfoy voice and it was impossible not to give him your full attention. Harry knew from experience. But, Draco was far from done.
The question was sudden and left him reeling just like everything else Luna had said so far. His favorite flower? Was this some kind of association test? Would his answer say something about his guilt to the Ministry?
"What's that got to do with anything?" Harry couldn't really fault the woman for being so dedicated to her job and he admired it, in a weird sort of way, but that didn't ease the sting of this conversation right now.
"Mr. Potter, how are you feeling?" He hadn't even opened his eyes or stopped to process the killer headache that was pounding inside his skull but he knew that voice.
"Where's Minnie?" Pierre scrunched his face into a sympathetic smile, as if he were addressing a child who hadn't gotten their way, and mumbled something about legal integrity. Though he didn't seem like a particularly helpful man, he didn't seem all that bad so Draco let his attention shift to the other two people in the room. They stood behind his hospital bed, just out of his line of sight, and he had no doubt that that was intentional. He could feel their presence, though. One breathed far too loudly, and the other felt… familiar?
"They really didn't give you any time to think about it. What if you'd had plans?" Harry snorted. He could guess that one of the reasons his invitation was so late was because of the difficulty getting Muggle post into the Wizarding parts of Britain, but he knew that wasn't the only reason.
Tears welled in his eyes and Harry cursed them, not even sure why he was suddenly so emotional. He tried to wipe them away before they could fall. A pale hand reached around and grabbed his mug before he could spill it, setting it gently on the table and smoothing up Harry's chest. It was stupid. Why did he even give a shit that Vernon was dead? They weren't close, they definitely didn't have any kind of familial bond, but his chest was still tight. Slowly, Draco palmed his chest, just over his heart.
"Yes my Dragon. You are a Veela. Just like Marionette from your favorite story, remember? She had a first wave just like you. You're going to get a mate just like her my Dragon" she stroked his cheek softly thinking to herself bitterly about how sweeter and less painful the waves were meant to be in the books he loved to read.
"Dragon, my Dragon you have to listen very closely okay?" She turned his face to look at her and stroked his hair, "In a little bit there is going to be a really hard pull on your chest. You have to let go okay? You have to promise me to let go or it will only hurt worse okay?"
The small blond huffed as he felt a small tickle at the back of his cold nose and rubbed roughly. He hated being sick with all his might. No matter how much he begged and pleaded when he was sick he was forbidden from any activity other than reading and sleeping. With a tiny sniff he twisted in the chair to open his book again and began reading once more, allowing himself to be sucked into their world. When he was young his mother read it to him before bed countless times as she curled around him in his childhood bed and stroked his hair. This book had also been the first he had ever read all by himself as a child and continued to read it every time he got sick. It was the story about a Veela princess Marionette and her private knight Pruet who turned out to be her faithful mate. Sometimes when his father was too loud and the visitors his father brought by the house were too cruel he wished to switch places with her
"Okay." He said nothing about Muggles, or about scheduling. There were no offhand remarks about Dudley, or pointed questions about the scars that Harry had yet to explain. They both had their limits, and this was Harry's.
But Petra fucking Magnolis had just had to have someone she considered 'competent' work on the case. She was a grieving mother, which Harry constantly had to remind himself, and she was entitled to her concerns but she didn't have to go on about how stupid they all were and how the entire Ministry was colluding to sweep her son's death under the rug. She definitely didn't have to scream it at them while they were just trying to conduct an investigation.
He knew this had to be killing Petunia, because she couldn't decide if Draco's obvious wealth meant that she should try to impress him, or if his Wizarding name meant she should spit on him. Draco, he could guess, didn't much care which she chose and was instead mulling over every snippet of information Harry had ever given him on the Dursleys. His boyfriend was slow to anger, generally, but could decimate an entire room full of people if given the motivation. Ideally, he wanted to avoid that.
“What are you doing here?” It was choked and the words were heavy with tears but Harry heard them nevertheless. He’d gotten good at understanding Draco when he was like this.
Harry couldn't say for sure, but he was fairly certain that Malfoy still had the same snobby, aristocratic grace that he had when they were children. The blond had always bled good etiquette and carried himself like a prince. Nothing could change Malfoy's arrogance—Harry was sure of that.
” Draco pulled back, though, and glared. He was not going to be coaxed out of this one because this was important—to him, and to Harry—and this was necessary. His father was going to kill him, sooner or later, or at the very least take him away from Harry. Which would mean Harry would be alone. Completely alone. They wouldn’t be able to lean on each other, Harry would just suffer completely by himself with no one who understood what was happening or why. He would become Draco pre-Hogwarts.
"Welcome home." Draco, clearly, was not even a little bit surprised that he'd put it off until now. He gave Harry a passing once over, to make sure all the limbs were still in their correct places and that the dirt wouldn't get everywhere, before beginning to dish up their plates. Harry was tired, but he still caught it when Draco gave him twice the serving of mac and cheese that he gave himself. No doubt preparing for Harry to drink himself into oblivion.
"Was there a question in there, Sir?" He kept his voice polite, but disinterested, and hissed another
It was an Apparition request. He shook his head at the paper with it’s neat script and professional language, but scribbled a yes anyways. Draco had always done this, even when they were together, and Harry had never understood. The blond could have easily Apparated into the hallway and merely knocked on the front door of the flat, like anyone else would have, but he refused. Instead, he sent an Apparition request like this one, and, if granted, would Apparate straight into the kitchen with Harry.
