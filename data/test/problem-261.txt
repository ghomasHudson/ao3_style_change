“How nice,” Duessa Borgia said, smiling icily.
. He’d no fucking clue. In truth the spell had been the product of utter desperation as he sought any method he could to stop his Aunt from… to stop her period. He could not risk any form of offensive magic against Bellatrix, his uncle, or the other members of the Dark Lord’s inner circle—this was not a group that respected defiance. He was ashamed to admit to the younger students the terror and agony that had driven him to become so adept with protection spells—spells that by necessity were most often performed wandless or wordless or both.
“Harry,” he gasped.
“You really are so…so…good,” Harry said, nuzzling the back of Draco’s neck in a way that made his entire body vibrate.  “Can I get you ready?”
So it was official: Draco Lucius Malfoy was an abject fool.
But even setting aside such moral niceties, pragmatically if Slytherin retaliated they’d only be injuring themselves, delaying any chance of restoring their reputations, for themselves and likely their families as well. No one in the Wizarding world was inclined to give Slytherins the benefit of the doubt.
“I think the point was for her to
get to decide,” Draco said firmly. “I don’t want you to be forced or manipulated into things you don’t choose, which is what is going to happen if you don’t start learning how our world works. I don’t mind helping you navigate it: it’s what I was raised to do. We both know I’ll never be trusted to hold real power.”

Wank.  Phony wanking sucker.
“There was nothing in what we did,” Draco said carefully. “But I can only do this with someone I trust.”
instead, but…I’ve never been able to cast one.”
—could in any universe be comparable to Harry’s own. But Draco supposed compared to Potter’s other friends it might. Voldemort was this bogey man to his own friends—a figure of terror, certainly, but barely more than a myth.
. If I know the attack is coming I can rebound it. But even if I don’t…” He turned his back on the group. “Fudge, you try this time.”
, Draco.”
“I’d think it would be obvious; I’m the club vice president.”
“Well, it shows he’s susceptible to it—and confirms that he fancies men as well as women. So here’s your opportunity.”
“I have to go,” he said, moving at just under a run towards the exit.
Though in the normal course of things, Draco would condemn as an abject fool anyone who gave an open promise, he also knew he couldn’t bear to offer anything else to this particular girl. “Of course, Luna. I’ll do you a favor—you just have to ask.”
Draco looked at him, curious if Harry had begun to inhabit reality and actually confront how his big news was going to go over with his own circle. Draco really wished he could push Harry to bring in Granger: beyond her effectiveness in handling a crisis, she was the lynchpin. If they could win over Granger, she’d deal with Weasley and the rest. But Draco’s injuries to her were such that he could not ask anything of her.
would be hitting the stands any moment now. They were looking at an explosion of attention and scrutiny. They could either control the story or be the victims of it.
Finally a girl asked, “Did it hurt?” Her name he did know: Persephone Fudge, granddaughter to the disgraced former Minister of Magic.
“I know. It doesn’t have to be today. Just when I ask for something different, that I want, I want to trust that you’ll be willing to explore that too.”
“What is this about?” Harry demanded as soon as she turned to face them.
“We’re almost at the Great Hall, so unless you want to be seen walking in with a Death Eater, I suggest you let go.”
Draco laughed at the idea that he or anyone would make a “pet” of Persephone. “She’s the best of the year—probably the best in the House. We owe the alliance with Hufflepuff to her efforts.”
“How did you do that?” Rutherford demanded. “You have an amulet?”
If they could marshal public opinion, they might head off disaster, but the chances of that were sadly nonexistent. Potter’s method of dealing with the press and public was to lurch incoherently between brazening it out, making inconsiderate comments that were easily twisted against him, and flat denial of reality. When it hadn’t affected his own life, Draco been content to merely laugh incredulously at the sheer incompetence of it. Draco knew well how easy it was to manipulate the press—he’d been doing so since he was fourteen. But his skills in that arena wouldn’t help him while he remained one of the most despised people in England.
“Is this some spell?” Potter moved closer—quite far into his personal space. Draco found his wrist grabbed.  “Are you trying to do something to Luna?”
She looked downright delighted. “That’s so sweet, thank you.”
Those first few minutes that Draco watched the Slytherins’ expressions as they took in the nature of the club he’d blackmailed them into joining were some of the most purely enjoyable he’d had in years. They were utterly shocked and confounded, at times appearing almost petrified of the Hufflepuffs, who welcomed them warmly as fellow devotees of Fury Moonrider. Even when they found that some of their guests were in fact totally unfamiliar with the music or the man, they only became more enthusiastic. After all, to know Fury Moonrider was to love him, and they relished the task of initiating new friends to share their happiness.
A squeal from Lucy drew his attention. Antonio: he’d almost forgotten. The fifth year was not carrying a single image as Draco had suggested, but an entire portfolio.
The blue glow started flickering as the Veela power got loose. Potter grunted something that sounded like approval, but now that he’d started for real, he didn’t stop, sucking hard and working his tongue. Pinned as he was, Draco couldn’t thrust, and his body started shaking, its own form of erotic torture.
“It’s okay. I did it because I need a favor.”
Apparently his future would have to depend on his N.E.W.T.s—fabulous.  8
Of course, Professor Slughorn seemed intent on putting as much distance between himself and his House and immediately blamed the Slytherin students, despite it being obvious that they’d been the victims of a malicious prank. Without even investigating he’d sentenced the entire year to a month’s detentions and docked all the remaining points from the House, enraging the Quidditch team, who’d miraculously won their first game against Hufflepuff, and leading to an hour-long dressing down from the Prefects.
“Ugh—
“Calm down, Malfoy. I’m allowed to be impressed, even if it’s with a Slytherin.” Draco nodded cautiously. “She and Persephone work well together.”
“Necessity: Have you heard of Bellatrix Lestrange? She was my aunt, my mother’s sister—she lived in my home for two years, and if you think blood made her loyal to me, think again. I lost count of how many times she hit me with the
not engage in innuendo.
“You will indeed. Did you think you could hide something like this from me? You’ve accessed your Veela heritage—don’t even consider trying to lie to me.”
For centuries, Slytherins had measured success exclusively according to the Byzantine criteria that had ruled the House since the founding. For all their cleverness, it never seemed to occur to Slytherins that they might try to cultivate students from the other houses.  It was a weakness, Draco now recognized.  During their fifth year, Potter had caused Dolores Umbridge to fly into daily apoplexies through the simple act of amassing and training a group of random nobodies, every last one of whom was thoroughly unimpressive (minus Granger, he conceded), not a one with any talent for strategy or leadership.
“How many marks did he leave?”
Blaise was suddenly serious. “Draco, you need to think about this very carefully. I know you’ve lusted after him, but is this what you really want? If you don’t, you need to walk away, now. Wolves mark to claim.” When Blaise saw his face, he just whistled. “Darling, I’m afraid I’m having a few doubts about the soundness of this strategy of yours. You activate the Veela power knowing that puts Potter off limits, live celibately for weeks instead of shagging anyone you could have, myself included, and then decide after all that Potter is worth risking Azkaban for. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you’ve suddenly become a Gryffindor—
“Is this… what we’re….” he whispered shakily. “Is it real?”
“Madame,” Draco said, “is there something we can help you with?”
year all over again—Potter staring at him like Draco was about to start throwing unforgivable curses at his fellow diners. Even Blaise noticed. “What’s got into the chosen one?”
“Good boy.” His clothes disappeared in a blink, though Potter’s hands were still on him, so he’d done that tricky spell wandfree.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Well, do let me know if he’d be up for a threesome before you head off to Azkaban, because that seems to be where the wind is blowing.”
“Lucy!” she called out.  “I’m here. Have you met my friend, Draco?”
Though they had power to transform the Three Broomsticks into a fairy-tale garden for their daughter’s friends, the Borgias could not transform themselves so easily. In contrast to most Hogwarts parents including his own, the Borgias apparently travelled with an entourage of assistants and bodyguards, who lurked menacingly in the background.
And beyond a slight tightening of his trousers, he didn’t feel the same rush of pure lust he’d experienced when he’d tried it alone this summer. It helped that both girls let out an appalling squealy sound.
The world went white—the power, the glow burst out of him, almost blinding. All of those parts of him that had been churning with desire seemed to release at the same second.
Potter’s reaction was instant. He stopped walking and pushed Draco against the wall: “Who’s hexing you?” he demanded.
curse; she thought it was a hilarious joke. Then there was Fenrir Greyback, another family friend.” Draco controlled his wince, wishing he’d not brought him up. Greyback was the reason he’d mastered an unbreakable locking spell for his bedroom. “Let’s just leave it that their company was highly motivating.”
Harry had finally convinced the Room of Requirement to provide a bed, and they were lying together, having caught their breath after a magnificent shag.
By habit his eyes wandered over to the Gryffindor table. Potter was sitting with Thomas and Finnigan, congratulating some bedazzled new tyke who’d been sorted to the house. But Draco had years of familiarity with Potter’s every expression and knew instinctively that he was faking his enthusiasm.
. The Borgias had managed to stay out of the “late unpleasantness” as Draco’s mother now called it. But Draco rather suspected that ‘staying out’ in the Borgia’s case meant rampant profiteering and exploitation of both sides while staying safely behind the ancient wards that hid their kingdom.
“You’re going to let me fuck you now, aren’t you, Draco? Because I have been lying over there thinking about exactly what I want to do to you.”
Draco laughed bleakly. He really had been trying to be better. He’d joined Moonriders for Luna, he’d put himself to actual inconvenience to help some underclassmen he owed nothing to, tried to help Harry weather a long-overdue mental breakdown. In the scheme of things it was mere crumbs compared to the damage he’d caused, so he couldn’t even rail against the injustice of it.
“So now
Before Draco could respond, Pansy was in Marcus’ face. “Oy maggot!”
Opening his, Draco found an invitation printed in gold ink on actual enchanted vellum to take tea at the Three Broomsticks with
“Yes, Draco, we’re almost there, you’ve been sooooo good for me.”
And if she thought he was EVER going to compromise on the FUCKING BATTLE OF THE BANDS, she could go jump in the Great Lake.
Of course a glance at Potter was all she needed to know exactly where to hit. Her movements turned sultry and she sidled up to Draco, taking his cheeks in her hands. “I can think of a few ways,” she murmured into his ear.
And while he’d have preferred rather less in the way of giggling and squealing, he found he could tolerate it since no one was laughing at him. Indeed, the Hufflepuff Moonrider fans somehow managed to spend entire hours together without anyone uttering a single cutting remark or bit of nasty gossip. Two years ago he would have written them off as phony or manipulative; now the idea seemed laughable. They were exactly who they appeared—only a fool (or a Slytherin) could doubt it.
. Knowing Luna, she wouldn’t have even thought it.  It didn’t matter: Draco thought it for her.
Antonio swallowed but nodded. Draco respected that there was enormous pressure here, but he knew the commission was well within Antonio’s abilities. To the rest he said, “You are Slytherins. You will all dress and behave impeccably. You will politely greet the Borgias and then spend the remainder of the occasion mixing sociably with the other club members. Slytherins will commit no faux pas themselves, but will take no notice of those committed by members of the other houses. Your behavior will be quietly attentive and friendly; the goal is to be unobtrusive, but should anyone be scrutinizing us, the most they will be able to say is that every member of Slytherin did their best to make the event a success.”
“It means don’t shit on other people’s fun—especially when it’s nothing to you. So how about you stop being a fucking twat, and dial back the contempt. And if not, get the fuck out of here.”
a fan of this Fury Moonsomething.”
He winced. “Please, never say that to me, or any Slytherin—I beg you.”
“See the Veela power—she’s only seen Fury in photos.”
It was in no way Pansy’s fault that the House wasn’t trusted, but her action that day was just too conspicuous and memorable—she made an easy scapegoat.
This was not a conversation they could have in public. Meetings were impossible, and Potter had taken to turning up at the end of club hours to… meet Luna? escort her? protect her from Draco’s evil Veela power, perhaps?
As the train pulled into Hogsmeade, Draco quietly extended his personal
Blaise drawled, “Charmed, I’m sure,” while Pansy just gave her an insincere smile.
At least like Luna, Harry could not be mistaken for a gold-digger or toady. Potter had opted for his usual weekend wear: a hoodie, tatty jeans and trainers. Draco would have suspected him of dressing to insult the hosts, but he didn’t think Potter was capable of putting that much intention into his dress. He mumbled, “Er, pleased to meet you,” not sounding remotely pleased. Draco wasn’t sure if it was that Duessa Borgia was exactly the kind of pure-blood, society person Harry loathed, or whether he was still sulking that this tea was cutting into his shagging hours.
“I’m sorry—you mean to help us with this?” Draco said slowly.
“Why are you so difficult!” he yelled.
Before she could answer, an accusing voice called out, “Luna, you left dinner.” Just wonderful: Potter was stalking her now.
“Luna asked me a favor, to teach some students to cast a
Draco felt like he acquitted himself acceptably, especially in dissuading his fellow writers from a dreadfully cliched and out-of-character development for Mercury, but privately he was close to panic. Bringing Antonio was absolutely brilliant and a real coup for Slytherin, but the obvious success only increased the pressure that he fully deliver on his side of the bargain.
“So that’s the problem? that I’m stealing your idea? Anyway, this can’t be
. But Draco recognized this wasn’t another of Potter’s rescues. He remembered what Luna had said about fearing she’d never cast the
Both Melody and Duessa’s eyes lit up. “Even better—she’ll be perfect.” Melody and Giovanni rushed off to their various assignments. Draco was feeling rather dizzy at Duessa Borgia’s speed and sheer bloody brilliance in attacking their problem.
. Keeping his eyes on Potter’s, Draco undid his trousers and released his cock, which was rapidly hardening. In a single, graceful movement, Draco swallowed him down. Harry’s eyes darkened. There was no way he could think this was Draco’s first time. In fact, Potter looked like he wanted yank him off and throw him over the back of the sofa. Next time. Draco smiled around Harry’s cock, and did a little flicker with his tongue that Blaise had taught him.
“Of course, your highness,” Melody said, taking out parchment and a quick-quill.
“You weren’t in the dining hall.” He looked up to see Luna, smiling dreamily as always.
Draco would have supposed his presence there would put a chill on the proceedings, but no. They all seemed thrilled to have him there, commenting favorably on his resemblance to their idol, though no one mentioned the Veela power which he attributed to Luna’s tact. Draco was mostly a spectator on the activities, but when pressed by Lucy Borgia, exerted himself to offer a suggestion on how Fury might escape the clutches of the evil Mercury, a vengeful former bandmate, who’d kidnapped their hero and imprisoned him in his Dungeon in the Muscovy Steppes.  He was then subjected to a full minute of nerve-shredding shrieks of approval.
Blaise and Draco shared a long-suffering look as Marcus went down in a double-body-bind and landed on the floor with Pansy on top of him, her wand jammed in his throat. “Any more questions?” she demanded of the group.
But those problems dwarfed the real one, that he discovered the moment he opened his mouth to explain how to cast the
Draco couldn’t stop his mind from wandering back to Blaise’s warning that Potter would be possessive: how exactly would that fit with the kindly, harmless savior image he cultivated for the adoring public?
Once Draco was confident that his housemates would not wound his fellow Moonriders with any show of disdain for their idol, he was able to apply himself fully to the brainstorming session taking place on the scene where Mercury drives the heroes apart by revealing Fury’s Veela heritage to Bez.
And yet he’d somehow molded that group of losers into a force capable of contending with the Carrows, who rivaled his aunt for psychotic sadism.  And that last part they’d done without the help of the golden trio (and let’s be real, golden
“Are you one of those people?”
The Slytherins were doing nothing wrong: so what if their motives were not as noble and selfless as suited Gryffindor morality. They were behaving—more than that, contributing. Antonio’s arrival had brought something of real value to their fellow Moonriders. They were building something here, something that he’d never seen before at Hogwarts, that most would have said was impossible.
He prayed heaven for patience. Princess Lucy was whispering something else to Luna, who whispered back, causing excited… hopping.
“Only if she and I are on speaking terms,” Draco said pointedly.
Potter looked like he might try to intervene, but
This really was a joy to write. So many thanks to those who have left encouraging comments--they mean the world to me.  I am working on a sequel from Harry's perspective which I hope I'll finish in the next few weeks, so keep an eye out.
He tried not to stare at Potter too obviously. His “Er, so I’m Harry,” was met by three pairs of raised eyebrows. “Right, you know that. So, uh, the key to casting a

a flattering style.  And were those freckles or spots?  All those millions of galleons and she couldn’t buy some skin potion? He quickly congratulated himself on seeing through her disguise. Obviously this was a form of camouflage and advanced mental warfare—deceiving rivals and enemies into underestimating her, the better to smite them and leave them wishing they were never born.
“Her name is Lucy Borgia. I don’t have to explain myself to you. The better question is why you’re here, if you’ve no interest in the band
Of course, that was when he found himself slammed against the wall, and there was a familiar fluid-like shimmer of the scene in front of him as Potter slipped off his invisibility cloak.

and you will make an enemy of Harry. Make sure everyone understands.”
“Part Veela are we?” Pansy drawled. “Someone’s been keeping secrets.” Her glance at Blaise and Draco promised swift, painful retribution. It was harder to gage Potter’s reaction: he was staring intently at Draco, not angry precisely, but definitely threatening something. Draco shuddered and forced his attention to his new arrival. “Luna, I’m not sure if you know Pansy and Blaise.”
“I suspected something like that, but they liked it, didn’t they?—they came back.”
It seemed a good time to return to the “Tea.” Lucy ran up to them immediately: “Mama’s going to help you, right?”
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco moaned, only to feel a sharp slap on his ass.
Draco was speechless, but nodded dazedly, which seemed to amuse Potter. Keeping Draco’s hands pinned he slid down to the floor and ripped open his trousers and yanked down his shorts. Pinning his thighs with his other arm, Potter leaned down and gave a light, cruel lick along the full length of his straining cock. When Draco struggled Potter readjusted his weight to keep him securely pinned. “Stay still,” he ordered, as he made another too-light lick.
“What’s going on here?”
“I already told you, it won’t work.” Suddenly Draco couldn’t bear to stay there.  Blaise was a good friend, but every word felt like a stinging hex right now. He practically rolled off the other side of the bed and then grabbed his bag.
“Uh, Antonio Maldonado.”
“Lucy wants to see it,” Luna said.
“Did you—that first time? When I let you shag me?”
“This year is going to be horrible,” Pansy moaned.  “Why did my parents force this: it’s absurd.”
“What have I been thinking?” Potter said, voice velvet. “I have been thinking about vanishing your clothes, and then having you bend over and hold yourself open for me.”
She smirked. “We do a feature story on the Moonrider club—Slytherins and Hufflepuffs, the new generation, building bridges, healing wounds or what-have-you of the war. Mr. Potter, I believe you’ve been training the young Slytherins?”
“Of course, Draco. Anything.”
Not that the Borgias appeared in need of protection: Nero Borgia was a massive bear of a man who looked strong enough to rip apart his enemies with his own hands. He gave off an air bonhomie that Draco didn’t trust for a second. He’d show that same warm smile the second before slitting his enemy’s throat.
“Sofa,” Potter ordered to the room. The red and gold sofa obediently appeared. Potter knee-walked them over to the edge. “
“Not necessarily, but she’s gifted. She takes initiative. She identified a promising younger student in Moira and instead of treating her like a threat, worked to push her forward and help her develop her talents. She was the one who saw the real potential in Moonriders and pushed her classmates to work together to turn it to their benefit.”
In his younger, more entitled days, Draco would have considered this his due, and taken it without hesitation. It was a measure of what the last two years had done to him that accepting something he desperately wanted when it was freely offered felt unthinkable.
Duessa Borgia whispered something to one of her entourage and then gestured to Harry and Draco to enter the main room of the Three Broomsticks. Draco had no idea what this could be about, but wouldn’t be surprised if they were about to face a dozen Aurors. He quietly extended his
The carriage went quiet as all three of them began to digest the implications of a new Slytherin with her bloodline and endowments.  And Lucia Borgia was not an eleven-year-old first year, but a seventh year no doubt at the height of her powers.
“Fury Moonrider, lead singer of
“That was generous,” Draco said as soon as she was gone, but Blaise had slapped down his magazine and sat forward.
“Of course I know that.” At least… he did now.  But that would mean… “So you--both—prefer… women?  But what about… Fury Moonrider?” He shuddered privately at hearing that idiotic name come from his lips.
Draco wanted to shout
“Permanent?”
Draco tried hinting that their relationship was going to cause problems, but in vintage Gryffindor style, Harry just brushed it off. He’d lived through attacks by the press, some planted by Draco himself, and had an all-purpose impatience for anything he considered pointless or stupid.
“Then why put us together?” Harry said sharply.
“I very much doubt it, unless you can miraculously convince Lucy to take advice on her wardrobe choices. No, I’m here to discuss your situation and see if there is something to be done.”
“Which of your parents?” Blaise asked.
After a few minutes, Harry asked, “Was there something… you got upset for a minute there….”
Draco nodded his approval at Persephone, who practically glowed with her triumph. Antonio—the rule at Moonriders was first names only—looked a bit panicked as he was swamped with commission requests, but Persephone took charge of organizing the workflow, announcing that Luna would get first pick as club co-founder—clever girl knew that would most please Lucy. Luna ceded to Lucy of course, who requested the scene of last week’s rescue from the dungeon.
Draco was too busy to do more than nod at him, since apparently Lucy had not given up about the
an excruciating phrase—but it wasn’t quite enough to eradicate the (slight!) shudder he felt at the concept of a ‘possessive Potter,’ whatever that meant.
But it was a safe wager that the students responsible for the bullying had lost loved ones in the war. The past two years had given Draco a bit too much insight into the temptation to blindly attack someone who couldn’t retaliate when you had no chance of hurting the person who’d actually injured you.
“Give it a rest, Malfoy. Luna snagged me in a promise to help you lot, so we’re both in this together.” Draco laughed outright, vowing to himself to stop fucking underestimating Luna. “And don’t think I haven’t noticed that you’ve a whole new set of protection spells.”
Draco couldn’t remember when he’d felt this angry. Unfortunately, that was when he realized that there was a blue glow bathing the entire corner of the room. Fuck—he’d activated his power without even realizing. Potter’s nostrils flared and he moved even closer. “What are you doing to me?” he growled.
“You have got to be joking!” Harry burst out.
He sank down to the floor and cried as hard as he did the night Dumbledore died.
“Boys, I’d like a word.” He looked up to see Duessa Borgia, who was gesturing towards the entrance to the pub. Nero Borgia was shaking Antonio’s hand, and then whispered something to Lucy, who shouted, “Papa says there’s cake!” Long tables appeared at the far end of the garden, groaning with layered pink and violet cakes covered with sparkling blossoms.
“And you’ve really taken no steps at all?”

Draco just rolled his eyes—as if he’d need to use his power on Blaise, who’d been shagging him on and off since 5

. Your choice. I would be happy to meet with anyone if it would be helpful, but I will require a letter.”
“Within the hour,” Melody said.
“Have you gone mad? I am not afraid of you, Luna.” He prayed Merlin for patience.  “You know, if you were in Slytherin House, I would chalk this entire conversation up to an especially clever and spiteful act of vengeance.”
As soon as she was gone, Blaise slapped the side of Draco’s head. “You let him mark you up!”
“Something about my daughter amuses you?” Duessa Borgia said, voice deadly.
year, but nowhere as dramatically as Slytherin, where only half the students had returned.
“And I meant what I said: I’m happy to keep exploring this with you for the time being, so long as you understand that this is not the only thing I like.”
Fudge might not be a right prick like Rutherford, but neither did she require reassurances about hexing an upperclassman. A second later he felt the spark as something hit him—jelly-legs if he had to guess.
“You said it to me, Draco,” she laughed.
“But…”
“I’m good,” he said.
, but I didn’t learn it in class--or even from a teacher—more through trial and error.” He could feel his face burning. “And mostly I had to cast it silently. I’m finding it very hard to teach. I thought I might offer to teach them a
It gave him a clarity he rarely had these days. His Housemates were members, Moonriders, and it was on Draco to defend them.
More surprising was the arrival of a rather bewildered Slytherin fifth year, Antonio Maldonado. With a firm nod from Persephone, he took a seat at the drawing table while she shoved photos of Fury and Bez in front of him. He took out his wand and spelled the paper and then began drawing.
“Do you really need me to say it?”
Draco laughed bleakly at the recognition that in many ways his own lot was easier. It felt at moments like they were mirror images of each other. The Parkinsons had barely been involved with the Dark Lord. Pansy had done nothing worse than detest Harry Potter for six years, exactly like every other member of the House.  Meanwhile, Draco had gone further in allegiance to the Death Eaters than any other student at Hogwarts. It was Draco who’d thrown unforgivable curses, whose family had harbored the Dark Lord in their home; Draco who had willingly taken the mark.
“Well then I can’t show it to you. Merlin, when I told the Slytherins the same thing, they didn’t hesitate—you’ve been dying to hex me for years.”
His time living with his beloved Aunt Bellatrix had given Draco new levels of self-control, and having literally zero sexual desire for either Luna or the Hufflepuff princess, he realized it was probably best that he practice accessing the power now, when he wasn’t at risk of making a fool of himself.
“I think she’s thirteen!” Duessa and Draco couldn’t help sharing a look. “Wait a minute,” Harry demanded. “Have you been pushing her towards me?”
Draco swallowed. He’d never seen Potter like this: confident, he’d almost have said flirtatious. He wished there were some notebooks or supplies he could put away, something to distract. He tried to move away, like he might check the room for non-existent debris, but Potter just grabbed his hand and pulled him back to face him.
“No. I thought we were past that!”
“Come on, Draco,” Luna begged.  “Please.” But then her face fell. “That is, if you don’t mind. I don’t want you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.”
was heavily redacted.
Draco really did sympathize, but he couldn’t in good conscience allow this to continue. Harry’s respite was coming to an end. The
He wasn’t lying, that much Draco could tell.
Potter dispensed with, Draco rushed towards the Saga section before disaster struck. “Lucy, we’ve been over this! Bez can’t find out at the Battle of the Bands. Otherwise the whole Muscovy plotline makes no sense!”
“I wanted to,” she said simply. “I wanted to tell them about the chocolate.” Right because in a moment of weakness he’d slipped her a fucking chocolate frog, after his aunt brought a Dementor down to interrogate her.
To be fair, his classes were tolerable: it was clear the teachers feared him—perhaps understandable since he’d attempted to assassinate one member of the faculty, and been present for the brutal murder of another. He couldn’t give a toss how they felt about him so long as they graded his work fairly, and judging from a string of Os they were.  His classmates loathed him, but it wasn’t like he was yearning to be chums with a bunch of Ravenclaw or Gryffindor prats.
“Lucy likes it,” she said. “Until Hogwarts, she was homeschooled and she always dreamed about starting a club.”
Just fucking great. Of all the times to get hard. Potter could be stunningly oblivious, but Blaise and Pansy were

Draco pointed at the list of rules posted beneath the names of the club officers. “First names only,
It had been years since Draco had felt anything but the barest curiosity about the sorting ceremony, so it felt almost nostalgic to once again give a shit.  He showed no vulgar excitement, unlike many of his fellow Slytherins, several of whom were rather pathetically obvious. He could practically taste the calculations going on in everyone’s heads—weighing the advantages of such a wealthy and illustrious connection against her parents’ well-established reputation for gruesomely murdering anyone who crossed them.
“Because I was a bloody fool!”
At least the sex that followed surpassed the already very high standard that had been set. But now the number in on the secret counted twelve Slytherin Moonriders, Blaise, Pansy, and of course Luna, who’d they’d already established was plenty observant, which meant Lucy must be added to the tally. It was a ludicrously high number. The only surprise was that it hadn’t made the cover of the

” he glared in warning at Potter. “Make sure to tell him your theory of what Fury was going through when he wrote ‘Demon Eyes.’”
“How on Earth would I know?”
“It’s my business because Luna is my friend.” Of course Potter had no hesitation claiming her. “I care about her, and I won’t see her hurt again.”
He noticed that the new housemate was standing awfully close—was he planning to sit in Potter’s lap, perhaps?  Why did Potter put up with this nonsense?—he was the fucking chosen one.  Gryffindors were so bloody infuriating.
“Yes, I was bloody well listening.”
Draco slammed the Arithmancy Study Guide shut and shoved his books in his bag. If he rushed, he could make it back to his dorm room while everyone was still at dinner.
“I’ll stop getting annoyed when you stop being a fucking prat. I’m sure they were grateful to you for teaching them, but the last thing anyone from Slytherin wants to hear is that the great Harry Potter was impressed that they are actually capable of casting a spell every member of Dumbledore’s Army learned to cast three years ago.”
For once in his life, Draco willingly conceded Potter’s superiority to him in an activity—as if a Malfoy would ever aspire to a profession as wretched as teaching. But strict fairness forced him to admit that he did not have the best temperament for the work, even of students less fucking annoying. On his best day, he was neither patient nor even-tempered. School work mostly came easily to him and he knew from the few times he’d tried to help poor Crabbe that he had no idea how to explain something he found intuitive to someone who found the material impenetrable.
Of course, Draco should have paid a bit more attention to Luna’s precise words, “I promise I’ll do my best to teach the
“I don’t give a flying fuck what you believe. This is a club for
. This side of Potter was emphatically not for public consumption.
“I beg your pardon!”
. Club rules.”
“The first time I saw her, I thought her appearance was a form of camouflage—mental warfare designed to disarm her enemies. Apparently, I didn’t understand the half of it.”
“A letter of introduction—I can help with that,” Draco said quickly. “Perhaps with Granger?”
But shagging Draco Malfoy was not the same as shagging Ginevra Weasley.  Draco could just imagine the outraged headlines. It made him appreciate in a new way just how fucking impossible it must be for Potter. The truth was Harry wasn’t always the noble Gryffindor. He wasn’t always fucking safe, marrying where he was supposed to, staying within the lines that had been drawn for him. Draco had a line of livid scars down his chest that proved it.
“I was bringing Draco a sandwich.”
He assumed that the Room of Requirement had included some protections against errant—or deliberate—spells, especially in its incarnation as a space for Slytherins to train.
“Yes, please.”
“There’s something else,” Draco forced himself to continue. “I’ll not deny that I enjoy the domination games. But Harry, it’s not the only thing I like.”
He walked blindly until he reached the Slytherin dungeons.  It was still club hours and his dorm room was empty. He ripped back the curtains to his bed, just in time to pull out his cock and bring himself to a quick and filthy climax.  How on earth was this is life?
“Apparently he thinks I’m up to no good.”
Draco believed him. Harry was ready. The war was over. Time to start the peace.
It was a sign that the Dark Lord’s side was always weaker than it appeared, likely due to the fact that the organization, such as it was, was run by a pack of ravening psychotics, which prevented them from taking full advantage of their adversaries’ vulnerabilities. But Pansy had no such difficulty: even by Slytherin standards she had a talent for discerning sore spots.
It was as appalling as his worst imagining. Apparently
Draco stared at him, checking to see if there was anything mocking in that, but when he couldn’t find anything he conceded, “Clearly the same could be said of Slytherin House.”
“Of course. That’s why we’re here. Lucy owled us that you two are,” she read from a piece of pink parchment, “‘totally adorable and in love and their enemies are going to try to keep them apart.’” She looked up, smirking. “She demanded her father and I do something. I’m sorry to confess, Lucy is a bit spoiled. Her father has never been able to say no to her, but I was sure this was some Moonrider nonsense that she’d cooked up—throwing two rivals together, like you were characters in one of her stories. But apparently she was correct, Salazar only knows why.” She gave a another unimpressed look at Harry.
“What on earth…” he started to protest.
Though, actually Potter looked seriously displeased. He stared at Draco intently and then silently waved his wand back and forth in what appeared to be a complex of diagnostic spells. “Activate the shield again.” Draco felt his instinct to rebel evaporate under Potter’s hard stare. He took a breath and then flared the shield like he’d just been jinxed. After a moment Potter said, “It’s tied to your magical core. Like your magic itself has become a protection spell.”
“Luna asked you to join the Fury Moonrider Fan Club?” ‘
“Of course,” Harry said.
Finally it all just exploded. “Do you even know it was the Gryffindor third years?” he shouted, after the idiot bloke who cast the
“Potter is helping me with something,” he said pretending to tuck in. He felt the side of his head slapped.
conversations—the kind girls engage in. “He is beautiful, isn’t he, “ Luna said, laughing merrily, which caused the Borgia Princess to make a high pitched sound reminiscent of an indigestive gnome. She whispered something else to Luna. “I see what you mean—there is a resemblance,” Luna answered. “But then, Fury Moonrider is part Veela as well.”
“Oh honestly: haven’t you noticed him chatting up bloody Dean Thomas?  They’re on the best of terms—real chums--his girlfriend’s ex-lover. Doesn’t exactly reek of territoriality if you ask me,” Draco said scathingly.
“I was getting hoodwinked into joining the Fury Moonrider Fan Club, obviously,” Draco muttered.
“Harry!” Luna said more sharply than he’d ever heard her. She pushed between him and Potter. “This is my friend—my girlfriend, Lucy—she’s wanted to meet you.”
“Yes, and I’m very grateful for how accepting you and the other club members have been to them. Not everyone would have been.”
“I was worried you’d be hungry so I brought you a sandwich.”
“Moira, you and Persephone can go with Potter.” Persephone looked up at him in silent question, which he answered by mouthing,
Potter made a small smile, like he was relieved that he’d somehow navigated the treacherous shoal of Slytherin pride and touchiness. Which made it all the more outrageous that his next words were, “So you’re part Veela?—can’t say I’m surprised by that.”
. But if Luna were willing….
“Of course it is,” he muttered.
Blaise reared at this, letting his power off the chain, making Draco gulp. “Apologize, Parkinson, or I won’t share my gossip with you.”
Potter practically growled, but shot off a wandless jelly-legs. Draco sent it back at him, but Potter had his wand out to block it faster than Draco could even see.
“She testified for you—I did. Because I thought you’d somehow changed, but I was wrong, wasn’t I. You’re still a manipulative prat, who doesn’t care who he hurts so long as you get what you want.”
Except--the mere act of challenging that side of himself made the Veela surge up, like it was suddenly the strongest force in the universe. A bizarre sound was forced from him, something between a groan and a whinny.  Just letting the sound out seemed to make the power grow stronger, like it was rushing to escape. He clenched his teeth, and redoubled his efforts to control this side of himself, but then it seemed to turn on him, like the power that was meant to seduce other people was now going to torment him. Lust flooded through him, seeming to permeate every square inch of his body.
So he was being protective of Luna—of course.
“We want you to join our club—it’s meeting at 3:30 tomorrow in the Room of Requirement.”
He realized Harry was murmuring to him. “So good, so beautiful. I’ve wanted you for so long, you have no idea.”
That left the end of club hours, when the senior officers often lingered a few minutes to chat or replace items that had been left out. Today, luck was with him, since all of Lucy and Persephone’s attention was on Antonio. The three walked out of the Moonhouse deep in negotiations about the different genres of art he could produce. Draco drifted over to help Luna gather up the new sketches to be added to the scrapbooks at next meeting.
“I would say the same of myself,” Potter said, in what sounded like a massive understatement.
“Even still,” Potter said thoughtfully. “It’s a gift, right? That power. Seems like he should be supportive.”
The largest drawing, which formed a centerpiece of the collection, showed the Saga group and featured a longer loop than usual: Lucy and Draco engaged in an impassioned dispute, Lucy getting up on her knees and pointing at him in triumph, while Draco covered his face with his hands, only to repeat in one of Antonio’s marvelously smooth transitions. Draco remembered the argument perfectly, their hundredth over the Battle of the Bands, but what he’d not noticed at the time was that Harry had been there, lying on the floor, head propped his elbow. Draco’s eyes burned to see Harry’s expression—he was looking at him with such depths of affection.
Draco was on the brink of panic, when the Room of Requirement actually lived up to its name, saving him from humiliation by producing a long table with cauldrons for each student. Pivoting smoothly, he introduced them to a raft of advanced charms to protect belongings or repel malicious magic.
“Thinking of reneging?” Pansy taunted.
This time when Draco pulled away, Potter let him go. Potter’s look was all challenge. The meaning was unmistakable: it was Draco’s turn to make a move.
Draco shuddered at how very much he wanted this—craved it. It took less than a minute for Potter to shoot all over him. Blaise hadn’t been kidding: the instinct that drove this was blatantly, aggressively territorial.
But it seemed orgasm did not leave Potter similarly mellow. That would take getting used to should they ever repeat this. But as Draco watched him, he realized this went beyond not being mellow. Potter was still seething with energy—energy and intent. Was he going to explode with rage now? With regrets? Draco found the idea more annoying than upsetting: after all this was Potter. He’d not be surprised if all sorts of nonsensical Gryffindor tripe was filling his head. But then Potter turned on him and said, “Go ahead and cast it.”
He came—he must have—but what Draco really felt was how Harry gathered him into his arms, and up onto the sofa just to hold him.  He leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, wondering how this had moved so fast, how it could feel so set, so permanent.  Draco thought again of the word belonging.
He suspected it would take a single floo call from the Borgias to have half the Auror department here in minutes. He prayed that Persephone kept her head and kept the Slytherins from doing anything foolish. There was no point in praying Harry do anything helpful: Potter would act as he always did, without strategy, ignoring advice, on whatever impulse was spurring him that particular second. And no one would be able to stop him.
—if you can’t even get the name right!” Harry just folded his arms impatiently. “At the time I wanted something sufficiently unpleasant and humiliating; otherwise they wouldn’t value the lessons.” Harry scoffed in disgust. “For the fiftieth time, they’re not fucking Gryffindors.”
Blaise took in Draco’s expression and burst out laughing. “Apparently not! That good, is he? Well, well, our boy wonder has some hidden talents.”
Having suffered such an ignominious defeat, Slytherins whatever their age had never been so utterly out of power. Now would be an awfully good time for members of the House to possess some skill for manipulating--or just comprehending--non-Slytherins. Not that it was easy. Draco had spent his summer being confounded on a daily basis by how the Gryffindor crew conducted themselves in the face of overwhelming victory—for example, by testifying, often with tears in their eyes, to save anyone, no matter how guilty or pathetic, who’d performed the slightest act of decency during the war—him and his mother included. It looked so much like weakness and gullibility, it was almost painful for Draco to interpret it any other way. But he was sick of underestimating his rivals.
Draco could practically
He’d needed to rest, to nurse his wounds. He should have been given more time, but Draco knew it would be enough. It had to be. Harry was the strongest person he’d ever known—strong enough to heal, strong enough to assert his right to love Draco, to choose something just for himself.
“Don’t be mental,” he snapped out. “That only child comes with two Borgia parents, and I doubt Princess Hufflepuff there is up to manipulating them into accepting a galleon-digging suitor.  I like my entrails where they are, thank you very much.”
“It’s blue now, because you’re a Veela, right?—they have lovely auras.”
The strain in Potter’s friendly act was becoming more blatant by the day, as were the circles under his eyes.  He barely paid attention in class, and seemed trapped in his own thoughts, which Draco guessed were brutal.
“You’re up to something with her, and I’m going to find out what it is, and then you’ll be sorry.”
He finished in less than the allotted time, sure he’d gotten all the questions right, but dutifully checked them against the answer key. All correct, which bizarrely left him disappointed. This was going to be a bloody endless year if he’d nothing to do but cram for a not-especially difficult test.
“How did you do that?”
“So sweet,” he murmured and then called out firmly, “Lube!” apparently to the room. A moment later, Potter’s slippery fingers were deep in his ass, quickly but thoroughly getting him stretched and ready. There was absolutely no way this was his first time at this either.
“What are you talking about?”
Judging from the constant pings of attempted hexes against his personal shields the problem went well beyond a few bad apples.  It was open season on Slytherins; those who could protect themselves did so and left the rest to rot.
Draco hated how much the words stung. He tried to shove Potter away, but Blaise was right—Potter had filled out during his year fighting the Dark Lord and easily kept his grip.
“That’s when you became friends with Granger and Weasley.”
. You think I don’t know why that happened…!”
“I know he will,” Pansy said.
“Shut it, Blaise,” Pansy snarled.
Pansy seemed too depressed to act but given her rock-bottom social status, it wouldn’t have helped—though it would have been nice if she’d at least tried. Blaise was never one to go out on a limb on his own, but again, he’d largely ceded any influence he might have by staying friends with Draco and Pansy.
If the reports were true, Potter had been offered a high-level position in the Ministry, invited to start Auror training even without his N.E.W.T.s, and been offered the seeker position on the Hollyhead Harpies alongside his erstwhile girlfriend, Ginevra Weasley, who was joining the team as Chaser.
“You realize you’re going to have to start calling her Hermione,” Harry said.
“He lived in your house!” he nearly screamed. Draco got close enough to put his hand on Harry’s arm. “He was just in my head, but he was in your
Luna just smiled. “It’s okay, Draco. You’re vice president. You're free to invite your friends.”
He suspected that without Lucy’s influence, Luna would not have occupied her free hours in contemplation of the many virtues of Fury Moonrider and the music of
“Dare I ask?” Draco said warily.
Several of them looked a bit cowed by that, but a more brazen youngster cast a
Potter barely took his eyes off Draco as he absently responded to Lucy’s enthusiastic welcome. Draco felt a momentary panic that the news would finally spread that he was Vice President of the Fury Moonrider fan club. But then he took in the expressions of the Slytherins. They tried to hide it with defiance, but it was easy for him to tell that every last one of them—even fucking Marcus—was crushed. They all took for granted that Potter’s arrival meant they were about to be ejected—returned to the state where no one at school would speak to them, where they were at the mercy of a vindictive mob.
“I promise.”
Most of all Draco recognized that he was long past feeling wretched over the destiny of a Hufflepuff princess. Living constantly under that reign of horror and abomination—there had been days he was sure the despair and terror would outright kill him or at least drive him as mad as dear Aunt Bellatrix. He still had nightmares and hated being reminded of those months, but they offered one advantage: being despised by a bunch of teenagers, whatever their house, felt trivial.
“You know,” Potter said, as if challenging him to run. “If I had to guess, I’d say you expected me to react like Bez.” Draco started back, but Potter wouldn’t let him pull away. “Moira might have explained a few plot points to me. He sounds like a prejudiced ass, if you ask me. Should probably be more accepting, especially of something a bloke is born with.”
Draco hadn’t meant his words to hurt—far from it—but he wasn’t really surprised that Harry pressed his head against Draco’s shoulder. A half-minute later, he could feel the warm moisture soak through his shirt. Harry shook silently, trying not to make a sound but not totally able to hide his gasps. “Shhhh,” Draco murmured, rubbing Harry’s back.
“What about the
“Charming—back to your old habits I see.”
So it appeared Harry Potter was now a member of Moonriders. Draco had rather thought he’d drop now that the MYSTERY was solved, but Potter slunk in about ten minutes after Club Hours started, even though Draco noticed that Harry had not bothered to show up to classes.
. They did a feature on Fury Moonrider three months ago—
Potter laughed ruefully. “Not real? Well, then he’s just being daft—Bez, and possibly Fury too. It’s funny; I’m actually quite good friends with a half-Veela, Fleur, Bill Weasley’s wife. In fact I shared quite the cramped cottage with both of them for several weeks. She’s a lovely girl, Fleur, but I can’t say I felt any attraction there. Seems like this Bez should get his head out of his ass and be honest about who he likes.”
Blaise didn’t even know the half of it. Harry Potter beginning a “homosexual relationship” with Draco Malfoy would cause an uproar no matter what, but add in Draco’s new Veela power and they were looking at a national crisis.
“I always carried it,” he snapped. “Whenever there were Dementors at the manor—it wasn’t like I went to some trouble.”
“You ready to tell me what that is?” Potter growled.
Lucy whispered something to Luna because this was one of
“Are there things I should be careful of—things...things you don’t like?”
Now that the intolerable MYSTERY of the Moonriders club was solved, Draco assumed Potter would fuck off the moment club hours ended, especially since it was almost time for dinner. But no, after the senior members gathered to set the room to rights after everyone else left, Potter lurked to the side, no doubt waiting for Luna so he could protect her from any evil plots Draco might get up during the walk to the Great Hall.
Pansy smiled demonically. “Well, good job, Blaise. Perhaps this year will not be a complete waste of time after all.” She jumped up from her seat and moved towards the door of their car.
Draco wished he could just ignore Potter, and he managed for about ten seconds to not look, but some habits were simply too hard to break. He regretted it immediately. Apparently the Veela power instead of enticing his nemesis sent him into a towering rage. Draco could practically taste it from thirty feet away.
There was no hope keeping it secret. Potter retained his Gryffindor habit of making sure he exposed every emotion and vulnerability to anyone who cared to pay attention. Draco was sure that by the second time Potter showed up at Moonriders, the older Slytherins guessed why. But in case they harbored any doubts, at the next meeting of the training session, Potter made sure even the youngest knew that the Chosen One was utterly gone for Draco Malfoy. Admittedly Potter had plenty of help from Pansy and Blaise, who flirted shamelessly with Draco, sending Potter into a fucking frenzy.
“A Gryffindor ended up in the hospital—so I think that makes it our problem too.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
. Instead of throwing Potter against the opposite wall as it once had Fenrir Greyback, the spell only forced Potter back an inch or so, but it was enough to let Draco slip out of his grasp.
“I’m not one of your rescues, Potter.”
“NO! No buts.” Draco took a deep breath—he needed them to understand. He owed it to the universe to say now what he wished someone had said to him, someone he would actually have listened to. “They weren’t powerful or noble or brave—not a single one of them. They were deranged lunatics who got their pleasure from torturing and murdering people who couldn’t fight back.”
“Don’t what?—Draco!” Potter said sharply, right into his ear. “You need to tell me—what are you feeling?”
“Please just stop or I really will vomit. And a moment’s consideration would tell you how useless that would be, even if I did want to pursue him.  Can you imagine what they would do to me if it got out that I had activated my Veela blood in order to corrupt the Savior of Wizardom?  I might as well book a room in Azkaban next to my father’s.” In fact it had taken Draco a bit more than
,” Luna answered. “It’s Lucy’s favorite.”
Lucy and Luna were whispering frantically with the rest of the Saga group, sure sign that they believed they’d arrived at a major breakthrough. “Now you’ve done it,” he snapped at Potter. “Cece,” he called to one of the younger Hufflepuffs. “Harry here has never heard Fury’s solo acoustic. Maybe you and Poppy could introduce him to it—I’m sure he’d be
Draco was doomed. There was no other word for it. He’d had plenty of fantasies about Potter manhandling him, sucking him off, shagging him. But somehow he’d never imagined Harry like this—so confident—so demanding.
Well, at least the lethargy and abstraction was gone. Potter seemed as tense and suspicious as he’d been through 6
Pansy let out a disgusted groan and got up. “I am not listening to this.”
“That makes no sense: the power alone….”
“Protection spells. I have one that’s quite good, a permanent
“Feel free to save my life again, should it be threatened. But we are not going to have a relationship based on your need to save me.”
Draco decided that all this vexation over teaching some third-years a
Harry sounded genuinely shocked that anyone could think otherwise of Lucy Borgia. Draco felt rather sheepish that he’d not quite noticed something that in retrospect appeared rather obvious. Duessa Borgia was blinking, the only sign that she was utterly flummoxed by this characterization of her daughter.
“But you don’t think it was them.”
The injustice of it made him angry—watching not just Pansy’s present but her future be dominated by a single mistake. In the normal course of things, Pansy had nerves of iron, and he’d trust her to fight doggedly by his side even in a hopeless battle—which made her sound like a bloody Gryffindor. She’d suffered a short-lived, highly understandable lapse in courage that day—a day he himself had spent practically paralyzed with terror--as
“How is that possible? You’re carrying some kind of protective amulet?”
“We’ve lost much of our influence,” Draco said diplomatically. “Now is not an easy time to be in the House.”
“I haven’t noticed,” Blaise smirked. “Since I have better things to do with my time than stare at the Boy Wonder, day in and day out.  But just because he wasn’t possessive of the Weasley girl, doesn’t mean he won’t be when he meets that special someone.”
“Well, I’ll have to keep an eye on her,” Duessa Borgia said.
“Why are you even here, Malfoy--Draco? Hermione said Luna’s girlfriend is some heiress or something—that’s why the Slytherins were suddenly…I don’t know.”
“And Persephone Fudge is that future?”
“I beg your pardon,” Draco sputtered.
“Moon
Duessa Borgia looked at Harry much as Draco’s own mother might (and perhaps one day would) as if to ask how on earth a nice Slytherin boy could end up with this clod—but then seemed to wave it off. “We’ll need a strategy to deal with the press. I asked my assistant to firecall our London publicist. I’ve no doubt she’ll be here in a few minutes.”
He was glad to see Pansy animated again, though he did wonder that both of them were so focused on regaining their ground in Slytherin. There were four houses at Hogwarts after all. But more than the other three, Slytherins kept to themselves—even setting aside the ‘late unpleasantness.’ Draco had always believed it came down to the Slytherin preoccupation with blood purity, but now that he’d been violently disillusioned from that cult, he could see how fixation on magical blood could serve as a convenient excuse for failing to solve the problem of actually dealing with the other houses.
Blaise just scoffed. “Ludicrous or not: A word of warning on that one. Mother told me in case I got ideas myself of solving some of our problems that way. She knew his father, James, and the Potters have wolf blood somewhere in the family tree. They tend to be possessive.”
Harry looked like he might object, but Draco put his hand out firmly to quiet him “We’d be grateful for your help, Your Highness--Duessa.”
“Father. It seems that influence he so painstakingly cultivated over the years came mostly through the bedrooms of ministers or their spouses, rather than in the halls of the Ministry itself.”
consideration to arrive at that unsettling conclusion, but he was grateful it had occurred to him weeks ago, while he was still researching the ritual.
?” Draco said quietly, moving cautiously towards Harry.
“Marcus Rutherford.”
“She actually thought you two would be a one-time event!”
Predictably, the third-years were now out for revenge, and Draco rolled his eyes as he listened to a long succession of unworkable or ridiculously excessive ideas for how to get it.
Pansy scowled and tossed him a galleon.
“She’s against it, but she’s not in a position to object, is she?  Having failed to stop my father from throwing in with the wrong side so very thoroughly.  She helped me research the ritual to activate my heritage.” Blaise nodded approvingly so Draco opted to edit out the part about how she’d refused to speak to him for two solid weeks, which counted as a screaming match for the Malfoy family, and only broke down when he made it clear he would pursue the ritual without her help.
Before Harry could explode, Draco said, “Your highness, perhaps you could explain why we need a strategy.”
“I absolutely was. I don’t blame you for how you reacted. But it’s hard not to wonder what would have happened if you’d taken my hand that day—just like I wonder what might have been different if there had been Slytherins in Dumbledore’s Army. Neither of us can change that past, but we can want something different for the future.”
is popular with their readership. They will be well- disposed towards a group of young Hogwarts students coming together over love of music—innocent fun—after all the pain and ugliness of war.”
“Accusations?” Potter laughed knowingly. “Is that what you were expecting?”
“No, I’m not.”
second album, where the Veela power lay in wait, as it were.
Standing in front of those pinched faces, it occurred to him that the House really was chock full of obnoxious little gits. And not just Marcus Rutherford. They were all excessively skeptical of everything, questioning him in that sneering, derisive tone that he’d heard from his own mouth countless times.
“I have no idea!” Draco snapped, pushing him back. “I can feel the pings against the shield all day.”
In answer Harry rolled on top of him and started kissing him deeply, thrusting his hard cock against Draco’s. Draco kissed him back, groaning as Harry reached his hand down and rubbed his cock. A minute later, Harry was inside of him, thrusting savagely as if he knew something was ending.
“You look sad, Draco. What’s wrong?”
“Your deal was with Luna,” Draco said calmly. “You’ll have to take it up with her.”
If Draco ever succeeded in restoring the Malfoy family’s influence, he would expend all of it trying to get Persephone elected Minister of Magic. The girl had more political talent in her big toe than her grandfather Cornelius had in his entire cabinet.
“Is that alright, Draco? Is that what you want?”
“You can. Will you be alright if I go in hard?”
“Draco, wait,” Luna called after him.  “Draco…”
Draco was possibly the only person Harry could show this less perfect, less acceptable side. Draco didn’t give a fuck about whether he was the Chosen One, or whatever other rot had been forced on him since the day he got that scar.
If Pansy could regain her standing with a humorless frump like Astoria, they’d be well on their way to retaking their rightful positions at the top of the House hierarchy.
“I’m amused by the two of you,” Harry scoffed. “Your daughter lacks political sense? We are talking about the same Lucy Borgia who got Draco Malfoy to be Vice President of the Fury Moonrider Fan Club? She’s got the entire third-year class of Slytherin racking their brains for new ways to praise the music of
Aggressive—predatory even.
“What? No!”
“I realize, but Luna, surely you understand that
“Yes, along with my father—and with your vaults and home confiscated by the ministry, your family reduced to penury—sound worth it, does it?”
Draco gasped, trying to order Potter to get on with it, but all he managed was more desperate groans. After what felt like an hour of agonizing teasing licks, Potter raised his head with an evil smile. “I reckon you’ve had enough of that, hm. I like this look on you: absolutely fucking wrecked.” Draco absently realized that there was no way this was Potter’s first time sucking cock, which perversely turned him on even more.
“Ma’am, if I might suggest
“I didn’t understand what you were doing with Luna.”
“Giovanni, you might as well start getting some shots of the group now, enjoying their Hogsmeade weekend. How soon can the people from
“Then what?”
“Well, they’re not my friends, precisely; I was trying to help them with something, and in return I asked them to come to the club.” Draco wasn’t sure why he felt obliged to have that out in the open, but he did.
“Did that look like I’m bothering her? Why are you spying on me? How on earth is this your business?”
Just as well the Slytherin underclassmen started filing in. When they took in who their instructors were, there was a general murmur of protest, and Marcus of course snapped out, “What’s he doing here? The deal was for you to teach us, not Boy Wonder.”
.’ “Ah, here we are. Melody, my publicist; Giovanni, our photographer. Melody, we’ll need a rapid response to prepare the public to accept a relationship between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. I’d estimate at least 17 people know, so there’s not a moment to lose. If I might suggest a strategy?”
negotiations.
was right here, thank you.  Draco prayed he looked mildly gratified as would be polite, rather than horrified.
“Tell me about the Fudge girl. Lucy said you’d made quite the pet of her.”
“What the fuck, Potter!”
She was staring at him now, as she took in the truth that he wasn’t saying. He had to fight not to cower under that gentle compassion. “I thought I would never cast another
By the end of the first club meeting, Lucy and especially Luna gazed at him with such gratitude he realized he was doomed. For reasons he chose not to examine, he could not bring himself to spurn that winning smile, or even make polite excuses when Luna entreated him to come to the next meeting.
Harry wasn’t helping matters by acting like a besotted sex addict. The next day he skived off class again—apparently they were done with all pretense that Potter had come back to Hogwarts to pass his N.E.W.T.s. However, he did show up for Club Hours, which should definitely help the prosecution’s case at Draco’s trial for illicit ensorcelment of the Savior, and possibly Harry’s hearing for involuntary commitment to St. Mungo’s.
“Where are you going?” Draco demanded.  It was an understatement to say that emotions towards Pansy and Draco especially were unfavorable at the moment, and while he knew Pansy could take care of herself, the last thing they needed was for her to hurt someone foolish enough to try to hex her.
“It got her out of this bloody carriage,” he snapped, all traces of boredom evaporated. “Now spill!”
“I was hoping to have one based on my shagging you senseless.”
“In between all the unforgivables,” he sneered.
Surely there were virtues that Slytherins were unable to discern, and thanks to that blindness incapable of profiting off of.  Though when he contemplated it, Ravenclaws could be tolerable, barely, but could he seriously endure being friends with a Hufflepuff? Merlin save him.
, perhaps he could offer to teach them to cast a
Hogwarts would give him a year of breathing room.
“Oh, aren’t you the naughty boy,” Blaise drawled. “But careful—you never know who might be watching.”
“You didn’t want to teach them that yourself?”
“Of course, Luna,” he said, murmuring “I’m glad you’re my friend,” as she skipped off hand in hand with Lucy.
“Are you mad?” Blaise said. “Study what?”
Next Draco felt a stinging, sucking pull as Potter sucked a bruise onto this shoulder, followed by another on his neck, and then another and another, up and down his torso. “There. In case anyone is wondering who you belong to—and that includes you. Do you want to continue? We can stop if you want.” Just the way he asked made Draco feel better—Harry really would stop. Draco knew that, but it felt better to hear it.
But her lapse had been so very public, and even worse, it had implicated the entire House, which had been locked up as potential traitors. Not one Slytherin student had the chance to redeem themselves by fighting the Dark Lord during the Battle of Hogwarts, but surely there were a few by that point who understood what Draco had known for more than a year: that you’d be better off dying in the fight against you-know-who then have to live under his rule.
Draco murmured into his ear, “I am with you in this. You won’t have to do it alone. You’ve saved my life more times than I could probably even count. Now let me protect you the way I know how. I love you.”
Draco reeled around to see a nightmare come to life. Potter.
Potter’s growing alarm at the obsequious hero worship so he smirked when Potter’s gaze met his—some things never changed.  Without really intending it, he let the Veela power off the leash—just a tiny bit, hardly noticeable--and Draco was thrilled to see that Potter’s eyes widened to huge green saucers.
,” she said finally. “After the Dementor. That I’d lost…myself and that perhaps it was… just gone. When you gave me the chocolate, I realized I could get it back… if I lost that part of myself, I could find it again. After, it wasn’t that bad—for me. I promise I’ll do my best to teach them the
stag. Draco moved down the line quickly. They did not need a repeat of his out-of-control glowing.
Draco turned to see the young lady herself, the Hufflepuff Princess. “Miss Borgia,” he said bowing over her hand formally, which of course caused both girls to burst out
Draco took out his wand and placed it on the table. “Go ahead, Rutherford, shoot a hex at me.”
“What?”
“Yes.”
memories. Pansy was terrorizing her group with threats of what she’d do if they showed her up in front of a fucking Gryffindor.
“You should come back to the Great Hall,” Potter said, all iron, practically grabbing her by the elbow.
“Just the whole Persephone business.”
“What do you want in return?” the Fudge girl asked.
“Don’t be daft! I shagged you because I wanted to, I’ve wanted to for months. But now’s a good time, when you’re in a good mood.”
over Harry, who snapped his head over at him.
Draco’s head swayed with dizziness, but he reached around to hold his ass open, which was when he really took in that he was completely naked, with Potter still dressed behind him. He felt a sudden panic. He could feel how easily he was slipping into this mode with Potter—these domination games—but if this wasn’t real, he didn’t think he could bear it. “Don’t…” he whimpered, but stopped himself when he realized what he was going to say.
“Princess Lucia Borgia, sole heiress to about a billion galleons?” Pansy said.
, but he really meant
, a voice that sounded like Blaise’s drawled in his head. Apparently, that was no exaggeration.
Draco tried to squelch any jealousy as Persephone, followed quickly by Moira were the first to succeed. Any negative emotions were soothed by Potter’s obvious amazement at the sight of Moira’s lightning-fast falcon diving and soaring alongside Persephone’s prowling jaguar. Of the rest, only Antonio managed a fully corporeal Patronus the first day, a watchful chameleon that when it moved, darted with breathtaking speed about Blaise’s graceful sandpiper and Pansy’s ferocious badger.
Private tantrum over, Draco took a deep breath, regained his aristocratic sang-froid, and turned to Persephone and said, “Common room, everyone.” There was less than twenty minutes before classes started but this couldn’t wait.
“Are you calling me a coward, Malfoy?”
Everyone there was used to being judged by the rest of Hogwarts: behavior and attitudes that to a Slytherin were self-evident and the barest common sense, were treated by the other houses as sneaky, manipulative and ignoble. No one embodied that moralistic, judgmental attitude more thoroughly than Potter.
“Don’t be daft: Of course it wasn’t them. The spell was much too advanced, and anyway, they’re Slytherins. They would never do a prank that ruined their own belongings.”
As the class wrapped up, Draco did not attempt an uplifting pep talk or words of insincere praise: this wasn’t fucking Gryffindor. He simply gave the date and time of the next lesson. Unfortunately, Blaise and Pansy were annoyingly obvious ushering everyone out, leaving him and Potter.
Draco was left blinking as he observed Salazar Slytherin’s grand-niece
He nodded in gratitude, though explaining the next part was hard: There was nothing deceptive or fake about Luna, but her dreaminess could mislead, tempt one to underestimate her formidable observational skills. Luna was the sole person at Hogwarts, the sole person who wasn’t a Death Eater, with any knowledge of what he’d endured at the Manor, and she would have no trouble drawing the correct inferences about any information he shared. But there was no help for it: he owed her the truth.
They’d gathered in the Room of Requirement that Saturday morning; all signs of the Moonhouse were gone, and he suspected it looked much as it did for Dumbledore’s army, though now with Slytherin colors and snake emblems on every possible surface.
It would be absurd for Draco to apologize to the Slytherins for a starting a relationship with the person he’d been obsessed with for almost half his life. He tried to console himself with the hope that Moonriders itself might offer some insulation. There were a few encouraging signs that it was helping with the bullying, independent of the new protection spells he was teaching them. Inevitably, relationships built in the club spilled out into the rest of school hours. A Slytherin chatting with a Hufflepuff Moonrider on the way to class was far less likely to be hexed.
Hexes and counter-spells and even a few curses started flying between the three of them. Draco realized this was probably the most efficient way to clear the air. What he didn’t count on was getting a close-up look at how bloody good Potter had gotten in his year wandering the wilds. Pansy and Blaise had always been top of their class, but Potter had no trouble holding his own. All those years the Boy Wonder had seemed to trip and fall into totally improbable victories—clearly that was all in the past now. His wand work was confident and flawless and blazingly fast.
A glance at Blaise and Pansy showed that matters were progressing exactly as he’d known they would. Blaise was laughing flirtatiously with his group, coaxing them with winks to think of their most
“You’ve been so perfect and obedient for me, Draco,” Potter said softly. “But I want one more thing. I want you to hold the Veela power back until I tell you to let it go. Do you think you can do that for me?”
Back in the Slytherin common-room, a group of third years were huddled together, obviously engaged in some pathetic little plot. They all glared at him, which put him into an even fouler mood. In revenge, he sneered and took a seat on the sofa mere feet away from them, wandlessly summoning a book from his room.
His and Lucy’s argument lasted a good 20 minutes, when Luna finally forced them to switch over to working on the new chapter, a flashback of the night things fell apart between Fury and Mercury, during the infamous Night on Bald Mountain Witches Sabbath concert. Draco was the acknowledged expert on all things Mercury, but everyone agreed Luna was the only one who could write good concert scenes, so the two of them put their heads together and managed to get the main scene sketched out, while Lucy worked out the illustrations they wanted with Antonio.
“Don’t be preposterous!  Potter showed up—and he seemed to think I was doing something to her. He was rather… aggressive.”
“I’m not trying to rescue you. I just want to see you cast a fucking
“Luna.”
“Insult me again and my offer is withdrawn.”
Draco could practically feel Harry trying to wish away certain hard facts, to change the impossible, turn back time two years or five years or eighteen years. Harry knew better than anyone how hopeless that was.
Which of course made it all the more incongruous that she and Nero Borgia had somehow raised this particular child. Lucy was at her most exuberant, talking non-stop during the walk to Hogsmeade. She and Luna had opted for coordinated outfits—appalling frilly, satin things, Luna’s in pink, Lucy’s in violet, that bore the hallmarks of Luna’s
Harry’s brows definitely went up at that. “Show me the
“Thank you. I promise….”
Draco had no idea what to make of that and finally admitted, “I suppose that’s why I was having trouble teaching it.”
“What about Potter?” Marcus of course.
Lucy looked like she might explode. “Oh my god, it’s perfect. I knew it: this is it. Bez finds out at the Battle of the Bands.”
Slytherin House was already notorious for its bewildering complex of hierarchies and alliances. Thanks to the war, all three of them were effectively personae non gratae, the first time in generations that a Malfoy and a Parkinson were not acknowledged leaders of the House. But a Borgia princess would serve as a wild card unlike any the House had seen in
“I don’t mind,” he said quickly. “Of course—if, if it will please, uh, you both, it would be… my pleasure.”
It made him blisteringly furious.
Duessa just blinked at him and then turned back to Draco, who said, “She’s the best Slytherin prospect for Minister of Magic from this generation.”
“You really have no idea, do you? Yes, it’s real.”
again--why the chocolate had meant so much to her. It was about believing—with genuine, bone-deep conviction—that you could get back to some state of happiness, recover a sense of yourself after your enemies did their level best to obliterate your last shred of hope.
“Er, yes, her highness has been very helpful,” Draco said, glancing at Duessa Borgia, who was examining her daughter like she was seeing her for the first time.
“Club rules: first names only—try again.”
“Right—so there’s not too obvious a focus on Draco and Harry. Oh, and the Slytherin protegee… “ She looked at Draco again.
The Borgias were visibly more curious here, as well they should be, because unlike Lucy, they did not consider Harry’s resemblance to Bez to be an adequate explanation for his membership in a club where his supposed arch-enemy was Vice President.
Harry stalked off, pulling up his trousers like he was going to bolt. His entire body was coiled with tension. Something was going on here. Draco held his place. “Don’t fucking run away from me,” he bit out. “Tell me why you need this.”
“Not at all, but you can’t expect to hide that from the son of an erosmancer.”
“Who the fuck are you?” Marcus snapped.
Everyone sorted, Draco had nothing to do but stroll about trying to look judicious, like he’d properly be in charge of a corps of faculty teaching
So I kind of imagined Persephone Fudge as a young Fiona Hill, who testified in the impeachment inquiry on November 21. 2019.
“Why do you look different? What happened to you?” Potter demanded of Draco, with none of his usual inept stumbling. Indeed, he moved towards Draco in a decidedly… looming way.
Definitely not the safe and acceptable hero of Gryffindor—this should be interesting.
“Are you talking about the boy band?” Draco asked, scandalized.
“Of course. I need to teach some spells to this lot, but I’m having trouble and I wanted to know if you’d help me.”
That required rather extensive negotiations, but it was clear Persephone had the situation well in hand, so Draco felt comfortable turning back to the Saga, and a tense debate over whether Bez should fall into a vortex of dissipation or pretend to date someone else to get back at Fury for hiding his Veela heritage.
Potter manhandled her towards the door, turning to send Draco a magnificent glare over his shoulder, causing a wholly inappropriate shudder to go through him.
3:30 the next afternoon found him in the Room of Requirement sitting in a circle—on the floor!--with Luna, Lucy and five Hufflepuff girls, aged 14 or so, for the inaugural meeting of the Fury Moonrider Fan Club.
“Draco, you can’t hide from me that you’ve lusted after him for years. Now you can have him.”
“Sod off.”
And as seemed to be the pattern of his life, the only solution he could come up with was Luna. Draco hadn’t forgotten that she’d been one of the members of Dumbledore’s Army who’d faced Bellatrix and his father at the Department of Mysteries. If he couldn’t teach the
“Thank you, Draco,” Luna whispered. “I’m glad you’re my friend.”
Which was when disaster struck.
“For my N.E.W.T.s.”
“She asked me to do her favor, and I said in return that I wanted to come—I wanted to know what you’re up to.”
Against his will, he got caught up in the story they were working on, and found himself arguing that they develop Mercury into a more intriguing villain, with a full backstory and complicated love/hate for Fury, and deliciously spiteful and clever instead of the usual blustering brute out for world domination.
Wasn’t it just typical: Slytherins were reviled by adults and students alike as cruel, selfish bullies. But right now it was Saint Potter who was running roughshod over the feelings of some 14-year-old Hufflepuff girls who’d never hurt anyone—not to mention what he was doing to the Slytherins.
He walked back to the common-room and started his review. “Too formal, Tabitha; Caradoc, too casual; Persephone, good; Moira, that will do; Vikram, excellent choice.” He moved quickly through the rest of the club members, sending three more back, but allowing a few outliers, including Marcus’ otherwise too casual choice of a hand-knit Shetland. It wouldn’t do to give the impression of excessive planning or coordination. “Antonio, I believe a drawing of Lucy enjoying herself among the Moonriders would make an appropriate gift—the composition should be relaxed and unstudied. If it can reveal some notable characteristic in Lucy that her parents would value that would be ideal of course. Above all, the quality must be such that it could be framed and hung in any private family room in any of their residences, otherwise we shouldn’t bother: can you do that?”
, Welcome to the Moonriders. Obey the rules or fuck off.” Draco waved his hand to release the barrier and stepped out of the corner, to find the entire club in a tumult. Instead of engaging in their various activities, everyone was standing around the drawing table where several were squealing over pieces of parchment.
Draco snapped his gaze over: did Potter think the Slytherins were after Harry Fucking Potter’s approval?
Draco had perhaps underestimated the power of gobs of money to turn any location, even the Three Broomsticks, into a formal venue. The Borgias had reserved the whole establishment for their “tea.” The entire rear wall had been somehow removed to open into an enchanted Italian garden, weather a perfect May afternoon, every corner overflowing with out-of-season blooms, amidst  illusioned butterflies and dragonflies and real life pixies fluttering about.
. “Why is this so important to you?” Draco said struggling to sound calm.
“Excuse me?” Duessa said.
By the end of the following day, Draco marveled that he thought the challenging part of this would be integrating the third-years into Moonriders. How was it he’d never realized how impossible it was to teach Slytherins?
He was able to fake his way through the next lesson by teaching the newcomers the protection charms and added a better silencing spell, but he was no closer to figuring out how to teach the
Draco was his mother’s son, so he did a series of lightning-fast calculations weighing the venue, time, occasion, guest-list, and arrived at his answer: cashmere top over wool slacks. He decided on the blue turtleneck--both parents were alumni of Slytherin, but Lucy was a Hufflepuff, so better not to wear green, which would awkwardly call attention to it. Blue was his best color anyway, and that meant the grey slacks, which were superbly tailored—at least he’d have the consolation of driving Potter crazy.
“Duessa, please. For going public with your relationship, of course. You’ve truly not a moment to spare if you’re going to control this narrative.”
Draco couldn’t fully follow Potter’s twisted, needy logic, but he grasped that Harry actually thought Draco’s experience with the Dark Lord—with
I've been playing around with different theories of who Harry shagged during the summer after the Battle of Hogwarts: the simpler is Charlie Weasley, and the more complicated is Bill Weasley who has an open relationship with his wife, Fleur.
As they returned the scrapbooks to their shelf, he said awkwardly, “I appreciate how you’ve welcomed the Slytherins. I realize I probably should have asked beforehand.”
, which featured a photo of his mother on the cover. Apparently, her solution to their problems was to go to a place called “Holy Wood,” in the Americas, where she was restoring the Zabini fortunes through what muggles bizarrely referred to as ‘Moving pictures,” though they were not photos at all. Though Draco had no doubt she’d make plenty of muggle ‘bucks,’ it had caused an outright scandal among what was left of pureblood society.
“Not here.” Draco grabbed Potter by the sleeve and pulled him over to the listening corner. He shoved Harry past the barrier and made a quick wandless gesture to activate the sound-proofing. “Why are you here?”
“Please stop talking.”
And Draco desperately wanted this Potter, the one who wasn’t pure sanctimonious Gryffindor.
Draco was so shocked he activated his protection spell without realizing. Potter landed on the floor. Draco scrambled off the sofa to put some distance between, not sure he’d ever felt so outraged. “So you shagged me--what, so I’d have some happy memory to cast a
“Well, I’m doubly glad to take part then. The truth is Luna, I need to ask a favor.”
How was he doing it? Just his voice seemed to goad the desire, the desperation, higher.  Draco’s cock was straining, his balls were tight, everything felt like it should be on the verge of coming, only it was frozen, like it couldn’t advance without some spark.  For a second he felt close to panicked that he might stay this way forever, churning with desires and emotions and longings that couldn’t be released. But behind him, Potter’s thrusts were getting sharper, faster.  “Hold on for me for one more second. When you feel it, let go.”
“Luna asked me.”
, and what if I am?”
Potter was staring at him thoughtfully and then shook his head. “So it’s just a few protection spells?”
with other Hufflepuffs making a sound he was forced to characterize as squealing. Everything in him revolted.
He was pleased to see the young Slytherins would never be stupid enough to enter a deal blindly as Draco had with Luna—no matter how desperate they were. Draco smiled cruelly. “Something suitably humiliating—it’s the only way you’ll properly respect the trouble I’m going to. I want you to attend the meeting of a club. Every hour that you attend, and conduct yourselves properly and courteously to your fellow members, is an hour I will spend teaching you protection spells. If anyone says a word to distress one of the members, a single disdainful or hurtful remark, you are out, and you and I are enemies.”
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” Draco snapped.
“I’ll try—I’m not sure if I can.”
“Persephone?—uh, she was the first to cast a corporeal
“Er, yes, uh ma’am--helping.”
Lucy’s eyes went demonic. “Brilliant. Now you owe me a massive favor, and I’m collecting it right now! Bez finds out about Fury at the Battle of the Bands. You can figure something else out that Mercury blabs about for your precious Muscovy plot. Do not ever argue about it with me again!”
“So not your father’s son.”
“I am the person who wants to make sure
Duessa clapped her hands together, the first gesture Draco had seen that actually reminded him of Lucy. “Perfect! Brilliant—remind me to give you a raise.”
All things considered, that day’s meeting wasn’t a disaster. Cece and Poppy were positively beaming, and Draco had for once managed to win a major argument with Lucy about a critical plot point.
“And who do you plan to target with these newfound abilities of yours?”
But Draco had learned a few skills himself and wordlessly directed all of his power into his
“Potter is my problem—whatever he does won’t reflect on you if you don’t let it. The Borgias are Slytherins—your sole job on Saturday is to show them the best of our House. Persephone stay, the rest of you off to class.”
The prospect that it would get out that he was a member of the Fury Moonrider Fan Club was too frightful to contemplate, and he was sure his friends must see through his pathetic attempts to act unconcerned. For once Pansy was too preoccupied with her own woes to sniff out a friend’s embarrassing secret, which he supposed he should feel grateful for, though it was a sign of how miserable she was. If Blaise suspected anything he kept quiet, disturbing in its way, but at least Draco was able to postpone his humiliation.
There was something miserable in the idea.
cushion!” A cushion flew over and Potter put it on the floor and nudged Draco to kneel on it and then guided him to lean over the seat. “Go on. Hold yourself open for me.”
Draco Malfoy had no such luxury. “Mama, Papa, here is Draco. He’s Vice President of Moonriders.”
the world made sense again. Of course Draco was engaged in some plot to seduce her or cultivate her for his own benefit.
instead of coping with his own struggle to figure out how to live in the world now that Voldemort was dead, now that it was actually
Draco had no doubt they all would regret it. Harry going to war with the Ministry over Draco was hardly a more attractive prospect than Draco being locked up in Azkaban. Literally everyone would lose: Draco and his mother, followed by the Slytherins; Harry’s friends and the Weasley family, not that Draco cared particularly about that. But to have that kind of split in the aftermath of such a brutal and destructive war, would be catastrophic for their whole society.
“Right—you didn’t even cast that,” Potter accused him.
“You look just like him,” Lucy murmured, sounding awestruck.
“I’d be happy to open negotiations on that point.” Harry turned his head to look at him, and Draco just raised an eyebrow. “In fact,” Draco continued, “I think it’s my turn to get my mouth on your cock.”
The move seemed to snap Potter out of whatever—mood—had gripped him. He blinked, shifting back to his usual awkward self. “Er, hi, nice to meet you.” It gave Draco the chance to stamp out the Veela power, though doing so felt about as pleasant as diving into the Great Lake in February.
Draco went deep, sucking hard, and then stretched his tongue to rub improbably far along his sac. Judging from the nearly hysterical response, that area should be bookmarked for further exploration. In fact…
But it worried Draco that Potter didn’t seem to be treating this year as a lark; he seemed lost, disconnected. For once in their long, sorry career together, Draco felt like he had an advantage, though it seemed scandalous to even think it. Because in contrast to Potter, Draco had never had a clearer, more urgent purpose, one that was entirely his own, not forced on him by family: to build some semblance of a life for himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well it’s not like I knew, did I? But I only figured that out after I promised to teach them protection spells. I needed to give them something to fulfill my side of the bargain, so I asked Luna if she’d teach them to cast a
“Come again?”
“Do you see an amulet?” Draco sneered. “It’s a spell, one I devised myself, a permanent
“Well it’s good to hear your mother wasn’t one to make a fuss: I knew I liked her, but a husband fucking his way to power and prestige is one thing. A son is another.”
“Why are you bothering Luna? Haven’t you done enough?”
“You are actually trying to lie to me about something like that? Were you even listening on the train when I said he had wolf blood?”
He was actually in a half-decent mood as he left the Moonhouse as they’d taken to calling their Club headquarters. Luna was so delighted she kissed him, which was exceedingly awkward—for him. Lucy seemed to think it adorable and feel no threat whatsoever.
It must feel like unbearable pressure to someone who had never sought power, who would be content with a very different life if given the choice. But the one overriding fact of Harry Potter’s existence was that in its most important aspects he’d been allowed no choice at all. Born into a life-and-death battle, his existence, the survival of his dearest friends as well as his entire society, dependent on his enlisting and then fighting and ultimately winning
. It was a safe bet that Potter would have an outsized influence on ministry appointments and elections, whether he wanted it or not. They might as well start building that relationship now if Draco was serious about Persephone becoming Minister of Magic. Moira whispered something to Persephone, which led the older girl to ask with another silent glance if she could add someone else. Smart girl to start building her circle early. He shrugged yes, and she glanced towards one of the second years. “Vikram, you join them.”
“Fucking prat.” Draco shoved him off his lap, and Potter had to fumble to avoid landing on the floor. As Potter sat up on the sofa, Draco slid down onto his knees in front of him.
You sound like a Hufflepuff first year. Do you want me to vomit?” Draco hoped he wore a tolerably horrified expression—“special someone”
He let out an unholy howl as the orgasm forced its way through him, leaving him feeling shattered. Potter pulled off and climbed back on top of him and pulled out his own cock and began jacking himself, quick and ruthless. When Draco tried to reach for him, Potter stopped so he could force Draco’s arms against his sides and then pinned them under his knees. It was only then that he started again, gaze taunting, as if daring Draco to say he didn’t want this.
