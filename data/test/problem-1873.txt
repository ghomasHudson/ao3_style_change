Alright, I'm not confident about writing smut, so I have decided not to publish the scene between Harry and Draco at the end. I feel like my writing of smut (at least for now) is bad, but I hope you liked this chapter. It's a shorter one, but I'm posting two charters today, so I hope that's okay. :)
“I do, but that’s exactly when I realized it. I love flying on a broom and being up in the air. As for the sport, it hasn’t really been my cup of tea, but I convinced myself that I loved it, since everyone else did.”
Harry and Tom walked into Gringotts disguised as random wizards. “I’d like to speak to my account manager and to have a full blood test.” Harry said, slipping a piece of paper with more details over to the teller.
Yes. There have been no recorded instances of it, but if someone did so without alerting the authorities, I think they’d recommend seven.
“Taken? Why yes it is. By you.” Hadrian said, smirking at his double meaning. Draco plopped down into his lap throwing his legs up and around to under the Gryffindor table. Bellatrix smirked as she saw her son and nephew together. She totally approved of their coupling and thought they complemented each other beautifully.
Hadrian slipped into his mum’s DADA classroom. It was still so weird thinking of Bellatrix as his mum. He figured he’d get used to it with time though. “Hey.” Hadrian said, with a smile.
When Harry - no Hadrian and Tom finished reading the results, they looked at eachother and felt like they were going to be sick. Dumbledore had really signed his death warrant this time. “Hadrian” Tom whispered. “We want all of these spells, compulsions, blocks, potions, everything removed and out and then Hadrian can claim his inheritance.” Tom said to the goblin.
Severus felt sick. He couldn’t warn Dumbledore or the order about Harry or even hint about it, and his beloved Lily’s son was turning into a monster. What would she say to Severus if she could see her son now? He couldn’t believe what he’d just witnessed. He would pass on as much information as he could to the Order. This was insane.
“Professor Dumbledore would be so disappointed in you.” she protested, when he briefly released her.
“Ginevera Weasley,” his mother boomed, “Did you ask Mr. Potter if he wanted a girl in his lap before sitting in it?” she asked menacingly.
Hadrian ignored the two of them. He had to think of the perfect objects. They should be something of significance of course. Hadrian could do his invisibility cloak for one of them. There’s his Firebolt - that’s two. Hadrian could also seek down Lyra’s alethiometer and Will’s subtle knife, and of course the amber spyglass. They were legends of course and the subtle knife had shattered, but the goblins would likely fix it as they were experts. The shattered remains should all still be in the same box. Not that they could figure out how to use the two items. They wouldn’t work anymore and they’d be left as two priceless magical artifacts, remnant from a time in which they did work. He could worry about those later. He didn’t have to make all his horcruxes in such close timing to each other. That was five total. For his last two, he’d figure out those later. He only wanted to create one for now and that’d be his firebolt. He’d worry about the invisibility cloak and the others much later.
“We’re both marked,” Hadrian said giggling after checking to make sure that no portraits or people were around.
“Sorry, Oliver, but I can and I will. I wish to put more effort into my studies. I’ll get my firebolt from the locker this afternoon.” Harry said calmly.

“Normally, I’d say no, but to you, of course,” his father replied. Hadrian grinned. He apparated straight to Hogwarts - after claiming his inheritance, he could do that - and met up with Draco informing him of what he learned. Draco was furious with Dumbledore and thrilled to hear of his new title as Lord Black-Riddle. Of course Riddle was a new house and only Dumbledore knew just who founded the Riddle house, but others would think Dumbledore mad should he proclaim said knowledge. And besides, they weren’t about to go telling Dumbledore that he was Lord Black-Riddle unless he had the audacity to call Hadrian, my boy, too many times.
“Awww! Thank you! Though don’t say I didn’t warn you if your house has a fit and a half at this new development in their golden boy”
“That’ll be a detention with me supervised by Professor Tallivex and another 50 points from Gryffindor for disrespect to a superior, insinuating false rumors, and causing a public disruption while others are trying to work. Your detention will be served in this room next weekend from 7:00pm until 9:00pm. Don’t be late.” Hadrian replied.
“Sexuality doesn’t. If I was straight, then you could make the claim that in ten years I might change my mind and like loud, hyper, sex-loving little sister-like figues even if I don’t now” Hadrian started, ignoring Ginny’s glare, “But if I was straight I wouldn’t like a guy no matter how many years go by. I fear this is a case of the opposite, so I expect that this slight misunderstanding has been cleared up and should it happen again, it must have escalated to a more serious matter.” Hadrian said, cutting in, “And should you refuse to correct her behavior should it happen again, I will be informing the Board of Directors for them to deal with the situation.” Hadrian added.
“Hey ‘Arry!” Hagrid shouted. “Over ‘ere.” Hadrian pulled himself and Hagrid inside of his shack, and apparated them to Knockturn Alley. He stunned Hagrid, and started chanting.
Harry was walking to Potions, when Draco passed him a note in the hall. He opened it and read the message.
“Like I had much of a choice?” Harry snorted at that, “I thought I was going to be expelled. I hated the Dursleys and I got offered a place on the Quidditch team. In my mind, that was far better than being expelled.”
“Same,” Draco whispered, their throats slightly raw and tasting like the other. “Wanna have lunch together today?” Draco asked, feeling bold in the afterglow of multiple orgasms.
“Ahh, well I’m sure it is just a slight misunderstanding.” Dumbledore replied, eyes twinkling furiously.
“Awesome! So now that that’s out of the way, let’s begin. We were working on wandless magic and dueling stances, so let's get to it.” She wrote up on the board three words: ‘Purpose’, ‘Intent’, ‘Willpower’.
Vault 1,321 - Slytherin Possession Vault - Salazar Slytherin’s Portrait, Salazar Slytherin’s Diary, Salazar Slytherin's Potion Notebook, and Salazar Slytherin’s Spell Book
“Yeah. So I was wondering if I could borrow your Firebolt for the game. You’re a really good seeker and probably don’t need it to beat Malfoy, so I thought it would give Gryffindor an advantage if I used it for the game.” Ron started. Ah, hell no. Hadrian thought. Ron would be lucky for Hadrian to say yes before his firebolt became a horcrux. Now, there was no way in hell unless Ron pried it out of his cold dead fingers, in which case his lovely Firebolt would have a few choice words for Ron seeing as it was his horcrux. That was one thing he hated about Ron. He always asked Hadrian for things in a statement format. The whole I was wondering if... crap wasn’t going to cut it for the new Hadrian who didn’t have a zillion loyalty potions keyed to Ron.
He arrived at Tom’s side, along with the rest of the dark lord’s death eaters. Elite, Inner Circle, Outer Circle, and regular DEs were all there. Today was a raid, so they would be given their assignments. Draco and Harry would be leading Bellatrix, Lucius, Nott, and 20 outer circle members in a raid against the DoM. Neville and Luna would be leading Snape, Narcissa, Greengrass, and 50 DEs members in a raid against Amelia Bones and eliminate her before they seized the Ministry and eventually Hogwarts. Fred and George would be leading Parkinson, Zambini and 50 DEs in a raid against Hogsmeade.
“On yea-” she started, but Hadrian cut her off. He went and closed, and locked the door and erected a few privacy wards.
“That is a very noble goal. I think that would be just what the wizarding world needs!” Harry said with a smile. Draco was glad that Harry agreed with him. They were silent for a while before Harry spoke up again.
Severus had long accepted that he’d been young and foolish when he joined the dark. To protect Lily’s son and spy on the dark for Dumbledore had been ideal and rewarding. Now he had a problem though. That very Harry Potter was now the Dark Lord’s equal. Working right by his side. And he seemed perfectly content to torture those who he viewed as the opposition. He hoped that by pairing him with Ron, he could lead Harry back to the light.
Harry put on his mask and cloak along with the others and apparated out of Riddle Manor to the DoM. He and Draco sent AK’s at the Unspeakables that got in his way and they split up to search for the prophecy. “Found it!” Draco shouted. Harry made his way to Draco and looked at the prophecy. They needed to get out of there quickly, so they apparated back to Riddle Manor. Harry showed the dark lord the prophecy, and they put their hands on it together. They watched in horror as the prophecy unfolded:
Harry sighed with relief and smiled brightly. “Well, I’m Harry”, he started, “I know many people view me as the savior of the wizarding world, but I really just want to be a normal kid. I love defense against the dark arts, but I found that I really love dragons also in fourth year due to the Triwizard Tournament. I think I want to be a dragon handler in one of the reserves? Did you know that dragons speak parseltongue?”.
“True, so it’d have to be strong, but I don’t think their bad for making Snape let me out of class.” Neville countered.
Neville was going to be the hard part. His parents were in Saint Mungos in cause to a certain Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black. Harry truly hoped he could convince Neville, because he’d been a good friend. He approached Neville cautiously, and asked him if he wanted to take a skiving snack box from DADA to avoid Snape on the first day back. Neville agreed --- wanting to get away from Snape, so they did so. They went to the Great Lake, and Harry set up a privacy ward. “Nev, I think you’re a really great friend.” Harry started.
He knew enough to begin the process now. But who to kill? It did require a sacrifice and it’d probably be too suspicious if Ron or Hermione died. What about Vernon Dursley though. Oooh! Now that was a good idea. Though, he wanted to savor the Dursleys deaths with drawn out torture. He didn’t want to hurry it along to create a horcrux. Someone else then. Maybe Arabella Figg? She’d spied on him for years. Or Hagrid? Hagrid had directly caused Hadrian to go to Gryffindor via asking the Sorting Hat. Even if he’d been told to come to pick up Hadrian, that didn’t mean he had to talk about how all Slytherins were evil. And surely he must have noticed the abuse! He all but saw it, yet did or said nothing. Yes. Hagrid. Besides, Hagrid would be in Azkaban had Dumbledore not pulled a serious amount of strings. Yes, that’d do. Nobody would miss the half-giant really anyway except maybe Dumbledore, Ron, and Hermione, but then again, he didn’t care about them anymore either.
“How do you know about the punctorum system?” Severus asked with a sneer. “Did Dumbledore tell you what I told him?
“Dumbledore has no choice in the matter. It’s in the Hogwarts charter and there are several witnesses here that can clearly testify that you were disrespectful, which is an offense that can warrant a loss of house points.” Hadrian stated calmly. This seemed to infuriate Hermione more.
On Saturday, Draco was waiting in the Room of Requirements for Harry. Saturday morning, Draco would help Harry with Potions and Saturday afternoon, Harry would teach Draco to understand Parseltongue. Sunday morning, Draco would help Harry with the Dark Lord, pureblood culture, the dark, and other wizarding customs. Sunday afternoon, they’d chat and catch up on homework.
Harry pulled Draco in for another big kiss and massaged Draco’s hair, as Draco did the same. They vanished their clothes and *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
“This is so unfair!” Hermione whined as they left class. “Don’t you agree Harry?” she asked, turning to Hadrian. Hadrian gave a neutral shrug, and walked off
“Well, every year you have to re-tryout if there’s competition. So I won’t. If Oliver asks, I’ll simply tell him that I’m quitting. He can’t make me play.”
“Oh! Hello Granger!” Hadrian said happily. “We were just discussing what you should do for your detention.” he said with a vicious smirk.
“Hey.” Draco replied. Harry’s heart did swoops and he couldn’t help himself. He pulled in and kissed Draco. Hard. On the lips and stayed there for five seconds. He pulled away. “Sorry,” Harry said blushing.
Alright! A longer one and I'm sure the chapter you've all been anticipating! Waa support fun to write, so I hope you like it!
“Besides,” Hermione huffed, “who died and put you in charge?” she said, loud enough for a couple Hufflepuffs to look up from their work at the distraction.
She looked up at Hadrian in pure horror. “You monster!” she protested, after catching her breath in the pain. “Professor Tallivex, I know we don’t see eye to eye, and this is Harry’s detention he’s running, but that was a bloody torture curse. Tell Harry he can’t do that and that it’s wrong.”, she whined, “Professor, are you even listening to me?”, she whined after a moment of silence.
“In that case, welcome aboard, my twin terrors.” They grinned at each other. “Oh, and preferably don’t tell your mum.” They snorted in laughter.
“And… time!” He said maliciously. Hadrian skimmed through the essay, and set it aside. “Now, that we got that out of the way, Kivaro.” Hadrian cast, grinning. Hadrian threw his head back and laughed as she screamed. He’d cast the privacy wards, so no one (read Dumbledore) could get suspicious of Hermione’s screams. Of course, he preferred the Cruciatus due to the nature of the twitches, but the Kivarius would do in a pinch under scrutiny like Dumbledore’s. He laughed and laughed, before releasing her after three minutes. He knew if he did it too long, she’d lose her mind like Frank and Alice Longbottom and that was not going to be fun to explain to Dumbledore and the Board of Governors why a member of the golden trio was in a similar state to the Longbottoms in Saint Mungos.
“It still sucks you had to go through that. Anyway, the fourth principle of the dark is respect. Specifically for all magical creatures. Werewolves, veela, goblins, vampires, the list goes on from there, all are discriminated against. The dark seeks for all magical creatures to be treated with respect - especially those like the goblins who some wizards view as smart enough to manage wizarding money, but not worthy of respect. The dark calls B.S. on that philosophy and believes that all magical creatures are treasured.”
“Students,” Dumbledore boomed in the Great Hall at dinner, “I am pleased to introduce you all to your new Professor Amy Tallivex.” Whispers broke out amongst the hall. Bella had kept her black hair, aristocratic jaw line, and pale skin, but her dark eyes were now a light, pale green and she was now 5’1 - significantly shorter. She was thinner and her eye shape was slightly rounder. Her hair also was now wavy-straight rather than curly, and up in a semi-messy bun. It was not obvious who she really was - which was the whole point.
He wasn’t as confident in Neville, but Neville seemed to not be as stuck as Ron and Hermione in his ways and if he could forgive the dark, surely so could Neville. He made a plan to talk to each of them to see if he should push further or back off.
“Now. You have yet to successfully disarm Hadrian. I suggest you get to it or you’ll have to attend my after hours for Additional Support.” Bella said, with a pointed look. Hermione looked furious and about to burst. She pointed her wand at Hadrian, and with a flick of her wand, nothing happened. Her right eye twitched slightly.
“Of course he did,” Hadrian cut in, before Draco could say something to respond or Ron could continue his tirade, “That’s why he asked first and then when I said yes, he sat down. Now what are you doing making the table want to vomit. You may be my best friend Ron, but merlin you have no manners.” Hadrian replied, only meaning the last part of his comment to Ron. “I can see your food I the back of your throat as you swallow, and I know garbage disposals that have better table manners than you. You are seriously going to offend someone who won’t be as forgiving as me if you don’t pull your eating act together. There is dignity and grace to eating. There are forks, spoons, and knives to use rather than dirtying your fingers, and napkins are, not picking up good from other people's plates and shoveling it into your mouth.” Hadrian lectured, pretending to do it as a friend, but was was pretty sarcastic about it, so that didn't work as well as he had hoped. Hadrian had been eating with Ron for years now and it was a wonder that anyone in Gryffindor had managed to eat at ask with Ron in such close proximity. Ron fumed and turned deep red, and then reached a purple level that Vernon would be proud of when Draco plopped a spoonful of yogurt in Hadrian’s mouth.
He prepared his Firebolt and himself for the ritual, and memorized the lines he needed to chant in Latin in order to make it work. He wrote a quick note:
“Nope and hell no. For one, I’m gay. For two, even if I was straight, I wouldn’t date Ginevera, much less reproduce with her, if she was the last woman on Earth. I will never ever ever like Ginevera Weasley in that way unless I am under the influence of compulsions, potions, or some other manipulation of my will, so mote be it.” Hadrian replied, his wand lighting up.
“Yes,” Harry said, moaning, pulling them into the RoR and closing the door. There was a lavish bed and a bathroom with a sink and mirror. Potions had been their last class, but they hadn’t gone to dinner yet.
“I was surprised when I could understand the dragons too, but it definitely made sense.” Harry said lightly.
“Hello, and thank you for that warm welcome Professor Dumbledore,” Bellatrix said with a smile. “I look forward to teaching you all defense and I can’t wait to get to know you all more.” She continued. “I know you’ve had inconsistencies with defense professors in the past and I’m hoping to change that. I’ll be teaching you everything you need to more including tons of practice. Thank you and I’ll see you all in class.” She said, stepping down from the mic. Hadrian suppressed a smirk.
Harry port-keyed back to school with a grin on his face. It was November, and Yule Break was right around the corner. Harry couldn’t wait for his mark. He was warned that he’d have to wear long sleeves at all times though. He’d get a mask that Voldemort had fitted just for him in addition to his robes, also fitted just for him. They’d both have very protective wards around them, because he was Voldemort’s horcrux after all. He would be allowed to go on raids, but only because of the additional runes that had been invisibly sewn onto the robes and invisibly painted onto the mask. Soon to be his robes and his mask. Tom had removed the trace from his want as well, so he wouldn’t have to worry about Ministry interference. He’d eagerly told Draco everything --- with Tom’s permission of course, and sworn him to secrecy. Draco had been thrilled for his friend. Due to their close nature, Draco would also be marked early --- over Yule with Harry --- and become Inner Circle.
“Slytherin of course! You’re on the team still, so I’ll cheer for you, if Slytherin is playing, and if not, I’ll be in the library. Lot’s of Ravenclaws end up in the library during Quidditch games if Ravenclaw isn’t playing anyway.”
“Of course. The slytherins agree that Snape’s teaching methods suck. We only tolerate him because he is biased in our favor. I’ve had tutors since my dad is, well, my dad. I’m pretty good at potions so I’ll be glad to help you out!”
“Hey Harry!” Draco said greeting him in the Great Hall, “I wrote a letter to father. He was pissed when he heard what you had to go through with your, umm, living arrangements. Anyway, he’s quite powerful and told me that he could gain custody if you wanted it. Do you want me to write back and tell him to do so?” Draco asked.
Harry and Draco were at it all night. They finally fell asleep at 6am the next morning and woke at 7:30am. They groggily looked over at the clock. Damn. Breakfast was at eight on Saturdays, so they had thirty minutes to get down to the great hall. They took a shower (don’t want to be too obvious) and rushed to put on their robes. They stumbled out of the room and could barely walk straight. They REALLY hoped people wouldn’t be able to tell, but they struggled to hide their groggy grins and stumbling legs.
“Hey Hermione,” Hadrian said with a smile the next day as the trio made their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning. He imagined that the mudblood was feeling particularly murderous that morning. He laughed internally at the thought.
Vault 1,327 - Gryffindor Possession Vault - Godric Gryffindor’s Portrait, Godric Gryffindor's Diary, Godric Gryffindor’s Potion Notebook, and Godric Gryffindor’s Spell Book
“Great! I’ll teach you then. Hey, do you mind helping tutor me in potions also? I’m terrible in potions because Snape hates me and never really teaches me. Can you help?”
“I never said such a repulsing thing. Do you sit in Ron’s lap at breakfast? Because I view you as a little sister who I don’t even know well or talk to much. Get off of my lap right now.”
The next morning, Harry woke up excited as ever. He was getting marked. Today was going to be awesome! He hopped out of bed and slid into the robes Friva had left for him on his dresser. He headed down stairs and had breakfast with Draco and Tom. He ate eggs with bacon and a chocolate pastry. Draco had the same thing.
“Hey Hadrian!” Bellatrix greeted. “You’re just in time!” Bella turned back to the rest of the class. A grumpy Hermione sat in the front row, along with Ginny Weasley, Ron Weasley, Seamus Finnegan, Terry Boot, Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass, and several others he didn’t recognize.
Harry read the letter, burned it --- don’t want people to accidentally read it and get suspicious, and headed to Herbology with Neville and a few other Gryffindors. Draco had History of Magic first with the other Slytherins and Hufflepuffs, so he’d gone in the opposite direction of where Harry was headed. Harry arrived in Herbology, and remembering his Lord’s advice, he paid close attention. He had Double Potions with Slytherin after, so he would investigate Severus’s loyalties then. He paired up with Neville for Herbology, and they worked until the bell rang and then headed off to Potions.
“Potter, Detention for sabotaging another student’s potion. I expect you to be here tonight at 7:00pm sharp.”
“I’m not playing devil’s advocate, I’m defending and supporting him. If you don’t wish to betray me OR the light, then you can be a neutral I suppose.” Harry said.
“That’s too bad.” Draco said, “To think we could’ve gotten along sooner and been dorm-mates or something”.
Professor Amy Tallivex - also known as Bellatrix Lestrange by enemies and Bellatrix Riddle by allies - wrote her name on the board and told the students her history - well her cover history anyway. She talked about how class would work, and the majority of the students look intrigued by their new defense professor. If only they knew just how well educated and proficient she was in the Dark Arts, Hadrian thought, suppressing a smirk.
“Our lord.” they said with a knowing smile to each other with grins wider than the span of Riddle Manor.
“No way! I mean, I guess it makes sense for them to speak parseltongue, but I never thought of it! That’s really cool!”, Draco exclaimed.
Draco gave Harry a look as if to ask if it was from who he thought it was. Harry smiled and nodded at Draco, and quickly scribbled a reply on a piece of parchment.
“Well then, Harry Salazar Potter. And in case any of you have the audacity to betray me, there has been a geas put up over this room preventing you from telling or hinting to anyone about this without my explicit permission.” Voldemort finished. “You are dismissed.” Harry said, with a smirk, testing the death eaters to see if they’d listen to one of his orders. Unsurprisingly, only Bellatrix --- who was impressed with the new Harry --- said “Yes, my newest lord.” And left. No-one else moved.
“Yeah. Your father said it was alright for you to lead a raid as long as you stick your mask to your face with a parsel spell as a safety percussion. Wouldn’t do for the boy who lived to be discovered.” Harry cackled at her last comment. “Dumbledore would have to get a new savior. Who’s he going to ask? Neville?” Hadrian broke down in hysterics. Neville had been less than pleased to learn that his real parents were Barty Crouch Jr. and Regulus Black.
Hadrian mounted his broom, and kicked off into the air once he’d left the locker room. His Firebolt felt even more amazing now that it held a part of his soul. He smirked. Madam Hooch’s whistle blew, and he started flying around the court, searching for the snitch.
“It might be. I’m not sure, but I don’t think that it would matter to the light, considering the result, even if it is dark magic.”
“On your knees.” He ordered. Stunned, she dropped to her knees. “Perfect. Now you like to write, so we are going to have you write a paragraph on a topic I assigned, then, will switch to another one, and then another, and then another.” He said maliciously. “But don’t even try and finish a topic once your paragraph is up.” Hadrian smirked at her face. He pulled up a stool and set a paper and quill on it, with an ink pad for her as well. “And don’t move.” he warned, “You’re going to do it right there. On your knees.” He smirked at her horrified face. “First topic: How not to be an insufferable know it all. Go.” He ordered. She hesitantly picked up the pen and started writing.
Neville’s grandmother wouldn’t be happy with him, but she wouldn’t notice, because she didn’t notice a thing about Neville. Luna’s dad was the same way, so she’d have an easier time also.
“Hello! Greetings class!” Bellatrix cooed. “I’m glad all twenty of you showed up just like I asked. Hadrian, Luna, Neville, I’m very pleased to have you here to help me today with.” she added. “You guys will be my mini-teachers. I’ll instruct, you’ll aid. I’m also invoking an old rule in the school charter. It’s called the aid-assist-lead rule. It states that a teacher who has students helping that teacher in helping other students, is acting as a Hogwarts staff member for the time being that they are in that specific teacher’s classroom. They are called tstaff. They get staff privileges while that is going on, including taking house points, giving house points, and giving detentions. For the detentions, they must give those under the supervision under a teacher of their choice, however. Hadrian, Luna, Neville; I, professor of DADA at Hogwarts, accept Hadrian, Luna, and Neville as tstaff, so mote be it.” his mother said, and her wand lit up.
“Per tradition, our newest recruits will have the opportunity to show their plethora of darker, more frowned upon, spells on a random mudblood from the dungeons.” Voldemort said with a slight smirk that indicated he was interested in what would become of Harry and Draco’s mudblood when they were finished.
Harry smirked at their reactions. “Thank you, though I’d prefer a different middle name that was reminiscent of the awful blood traitor. I think Salazar should work for a more suitable middle name.”
“Well what are you doing? Is only Bellatrix capable of following orders?” Voldemort snarled at the shell-shocked followers. “Sorry my lords” echoed throughout the room as they left the room and left the manor to disapparate away.
“Alright, no big deal. You have me now. Magic is all about intent. You have to mean it.” She said, giving Hadrian a smirk. Hadrian knew she was thinking back to her lesson in torture curses at the ministry after Hadrian’s disastrous attempt at a Crucio on her after she sent Sirius stumbling into the veil. Hadrian smirked back at her, but only for a brief second, before he schooled his features again. “If it helps, imagine the spell happening as you think it. Wordless casting doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t think the words, but imagine the curse happening as you think the incantation. For example,” she pointed her wand at Hadrian and his eyes went wide. For a second, he thought she was going to Crucio him, but then she did the tell-tale wand motions and his wand flew into her hands. She raised an eyebrow at him as if to say ‘I know what you thought, but I wouldn’t Crucio my own son, much less in a school filled with staunch light and Dumbledore supporters.’, which had a pretty good point. He gave a slight dip of his head, to nod in reply.
“Yeah, I know you didn’t come to tryouts. You must have been busy or something. I had a boatload of stuff on my plate this summer too. Don’t worry. I saved your spot, so you are still on the team. Now where were you this morning?” Oliver said, interrupting Harry.
“Well then why don’t you go sit with Mr. Malfoy at the Slytherin table? I’m sure that they would be more accepting if Mr. Weasley and the Gryffindors are not.” Bella said. Hadrian was impressed that she managed to call them all by their formal school names. He was surprised he hadn’t broken down and called her mother so far.
“So you can’t even deliver on your own detentions? You have to make a different teacher enforce them?” She asked with a glare. “How pathetic.” she muttered under her breath. Unfortunately, Bellatrix heard them. All of his father’s death eaters had excellent hearing, as if a prisoner muttered something under their breath in their sleep, they had to be able to know what it was as prisoners having bad dreams had been known to accidentally leak information unaware.
“It’s HERMIONE GRANGER!” she exploded. “Her-my-oh-nee Grain-ger.” she enunciated extremely slowly as though she was talking to a slow person. Bad idea, Hadrian thought, suppressing a snicker.
“True that, true that! I always thought it was kinda cool you could talk to snakes. Do you think you can teach me?”
“Ugh! Please get that bitch’s sensation off of my lap.” Hadrian murmured into Draco’s shoulder as they left the hall.
Then, the one and only Ginevera Weasley plopped into Hadrian’s lap. Merlin, she was lucky that they were at Hogwarts. Draco looked pissed; his mother appeared horrified; Neville, Fred, and George looked sympathetic; and his father would not be pleased with the bitch. Wanna be Mrs. Harry Potter wasn’t going to live long now that she expected the love potions to do their trick. She’d made her choice, and she’d live to regret it.
“Potter! 50 points from Gryffindor for disrespect to a professor.” Snaps snapped with a vicious, smug sneer.
“So, the dark. The dark’s principles are pretty simple. I’ll start by defining terms that the light often misinterprets. The first one you need to know is muggle. The light got this right and uses this one too. Muggle is anyone non-magical. The second one, is mudblood. This one is severely misinterpreted by the light. A mudblood is any magical person with four muggle grandparents and two muggle parents. They could come from a line of squibs potentially, but not in recent generations. They accept magic and use it, but reject magical culture, opting for Christmas and Halloween over Yule and Samhain. Additionally, they impose a muggle sense of morality onto wizards. An example is your friend Hermione. Hermione is from a muggle family and has no known wizard relatives. She uses S.P.E.W. to try and force house-elves to accept freedom in addition to better rights. Most house-elves do not want this, and they also need their master’s magic to control their own. A halfblood is anyone with one, two, or three magical grandparents. They have viewpoints similar to mudbloods. A pureblood is anyone with four magical grandparents. A first generation witch/wizard (also called first gens), is the first person with magic in their family (like a mudblood) but takes the time to learn and immerse themselves in wizarding culture and upholds the statue of secrecy when they are around their family. A second generation witch/wizard (also called second gens), is the half blood form of a first gen. A blood-traitor is a pureblood, who sympathizes with mudbloods, but not first gens, and tries to promote mudblood mindsets. They also reject traditions, often causing chaos in pure-blood society, especially if their parents are not blood-traitors as well. The mud in mudblood is not representative of their muggle relatives, rather representing the fact that they are taking their wizarding blood and smearing it with muddy ideas. We need new lines, and everyone, including the Dark Lord, agrees with this. We don’t need muggles interacting with us though, and we need to preserve our traditions. Make sense so far?”
“Of course, but only I. If you accept my offer, you’d have to refer to him as the Dark Lord or my Lord.” Harry said with an even bigger smirk.
“Can you teach me what the Dark Lord actually stands for? Somehow I have a hard time believing that he literally believes just the light’s propaganda.”
“If Pansy Parkinson plopped into my lap without warning what would the punishment be?” Hadrian asked. “Because your answer should be the same no matter the house.” Hadrian concluded.
“Yeah. Okay, back to the four principles of the dark. Blood, freedom, next is children. The dark believes children are sacred. Children should never be abused and even in the case of the Dark Lord coming after you, Potter, he only would have used Avada Kedavra on you. It failed, but had it succeeded, it would have been instant and painless.”
“Thi- This complicates things. Honestly, I only supported the light because I supported you. In that case, I’m with you.”
“Hadrian. You try.” His mother said. Hadrian was still warping his head around the fact Bellatrix was his mum and Voldemort - Marvolo - was his dad. It was mind-boggling at times. Hadrian stood up, and Hermione’s wand went flying into his outstretched hand, with a silent flick of his wand. Hermione huffed at his display. It was clear she did not like being outshone. Jealous prat.
“I’m not sure I want to continue playing Quidditch this year,” Harry said after he finished a bite of pancakes.
They walked to the throne room where they would be officially initiated and marked. Due to the nature of their eliteness, only the inner circle would be there. Everyone was there when they arrived. They took their marks and there was a whoop of applause. Harry noticed Severus amongst the inner circle. Severus seemed surprised at their initiation. Of course a geas went over the room to ensure that none of them could speak of this occasion. Severus hadn’t recognized Harry, but that was likely because his hood was over his head. He seemed more shocked that Draco had made inner circle so quickly.
“That’s master, mudblood” Hadrian corrected. “Kivaro!” he said, relishing in her screams. “Know your betters.”
“Then he better get used to it. He should’ve thought about that before stealing my money and sending me to live with the Dursleys with binds on some of my magic. All of which are gone by the way. Not like you’ll be able to tell him of course. All of this you will know, and won’t be able to warn anyone.” Hadrian laughed as her face dawned in horror in comprehension. “Not even your facial features, veritaserum, or legilimency could pry this from your mind. You can thank Salazar’s portrait for our spell, that is if we ever have the fortune to have you in the Riddle Manor. But you probably wouldn’t get the chance as Salazar stays away from the prisoners.” he smirked at her expression.
“So what are you going to do about it now? Like how will you let them know you quit? I hear Oliver Wood is more fanatical about Quidditch than Flint, and he’s obsessed with the sport.”
“Sure thanks! It sucks having no prisoners to crucio here. Of course the kivarous isn’t the same, but it’ll definitely do in tight situations.” his mother replied.
“Oh, and Harry,” Voldemort added. “Yes?” “You’ll be getting a special mark of mine. Your mark will have your and my name inscribed into it, meaning you are my equal. I have the mark as well, with Tom Marvolo Riddle printed under it. Yours will say Harry James Potter. You’ll be the only one aside from me to have it as of now.”
Draco was working with Longbottom. Severus seemed to find this hilarious, but what he didn’t know was that Draco actually liked Neville ever since he joined the dark. He wondered what Snape would think if he knew that Neville had an identical tattoo to Snape’s on his left arm. He smirked at the thought. Neville had actually been pretty competent ever since the Dark Lord started tutoring. Funny how that is. Snape’s teaching terrified Neville while the bloody Dark Lord’s teaching helped Neville gain confidence actually. After working with him, Nev wasn’t quite so scared of Snape either. When had he taken to calling Longbottom, Nev. It didn’t matter. They were friends now. Harry, on the other hand, Draco glanced over at him. Those avada kedavra eyes were intense with passion and seemed to make Draco’s heart do funny things every time he locked eyes with him. That messy black hair that covered the majority of his scar made Draco’s mind forget about going straight to hell and take a few turns along the way. Shoot! He was getting distracted. It didn’t matter as much though. Neville was actually quite good at Potions after learning from the Dark Lord. Truly funny how that was.
“Alright. So the dark believes in four main components. The first was blood. The relations of magical/muggle blood I just covered. The second is freedom. Specifically, the freedom of magic. The dark rejects things that classify magic and restrict it. The light believes that dark magic is evil and light magic is good. The dark believes all magic is magic and it is the intention that is evil and good. Examples. A traditionally light spell, wingardium leviosa, will levitate something or someone. It can be used for good intent, such as levitating an injured person. However, it can be used for evil intent if you levitate a person off a cliff and then release your hold on them. A traditionally dark spell, imperio, will allow someone to control someone else. It can be used for evil intent, such as forcing someone to harm a friend or family member. But it can also be used for good intent if you temporarily imperius someone who is going to commit suicide to prevent them from doing so and making them go and get help. Even the cruciatus curse can be used to shock someone who has lost feeling, into feeling something. It is, afterall, a stimulus to a person’s nerve cells.”
In the morning, they met at the entrance to the great hall. It was a Monday, so they were going to sit at the Slytherin table for breakfast. Harry piled pancakes with whipped cream, strawberries, and maple syrup onto his plate, while Draco opted for some waffles and sausage with bacon on the side.
“Then show me?” Neville said, exasperatedly. Harry cast another few wards around, including one that would prevent anyone from seeing. Then, he rolled up his left sleeve. Neville gasped.
“The Dark Lord tried to kill me painlessly. Dumbledore left me at the Dursleys and made me go back for the first part of every summer. He claimed it was for a blood ward from my mother’s sacrifice which allegedly is what saved me, but it didn’t protect me from what I really needed protecting from: the Dursleys themselves.”
“Yes. Harmony Grenjar.” Bellatrix said, purposefully butchering Hermione’s name, “You try.” She finished with a delicious smirk.
Harry had been improving drastically. His spell repertoire increased as he was no longer bound by the constraints of light magic and he’d been better understanding manners and heirships. He’d be going to Gringotts over the spring break to claim those heirships and find out any parts of his family history he didn’t already know. He was in potions and Severus seemed displeased as ever. Harry was suspicious of Severus, but had no evidence against him yet, so he did not take action just yet. He would keep an eye on him though. Over Yule break, he’d been tutored in several subjects. The dark lord had composed a schedule for him:
“No problem. I’m going to have so much fun this winter break when I’ll get to avada muggle prisoners as a stress relief again.” he replied.
“Alright. I’ll see you in Additional Support, Ms. Granger. I’ll add you to the list I have. My Additional Support is on Saturday from 7:00am - 10:00am. It is three hours long. Anyone who feels they need help can come. If I add you to my list; however, you have to come. If I add you to my required attendee list, it basically means you have suffered under more lenient teachers than I, and until I deem you ready, Additional Support will be how you spend your Saturday mornings. I will make this clear only once. IF, you decide to not show up AND you are on my list, you will lose two points for your house for every minute you don’t show. I will not waste my time hunting down students. If you are excelling and you want to, you are allowed to come and help me instruct those that need help. Additionally, you will EARN two points for your house for every minute you are there. I will NOT be repeating this again. If you forget my rules, you can find yourself asking another student.” Bellatrix said. “I’ll call out the names of all those who’ll need to start attending at the end of each lecture.” his mother finished. Hadrian suppressed a smirk.
“Yeah, but Snape’s pretty smart and suspicious too. He’d be likely to not buy the story with any old dark spell.” Harry prompted.
The five minutes passed quickly, and they went to an unoccupied bathroom to portkey to Hogsmeade. They couldn’t apparate in or out of Hogwarts, but they could disapparate from Hogsmeade. They made a portkey so no-one would be suspicious if they traced the portkey, and then apparated from Hogsmeade to Riddle Manor. Severus, it seemed, was also there by the time they arrived. Potions was his last class, so they didn’t worry about their absences being noticed. It was a Hogsmeade weekend anyway, so it shouldn’t matter if they weren’t strictly noticed over the weekend. Harry was excited and thrilled to see what their lord, Tom, needed.
“Granger!” Hadrian snapped. “You aren’t successful because you don’t have a strong enough willpower. You clearly have the intent if your scrunched up face is any clue and you seem quite confident, so that only leaves your mental stamina.” Hadrian said, lecturing the bushy haired girl he used to call a friend. “You want to silently disarm Weasley?” he asked her rhetorically.
They walked into the Great Hall. Hadrian sat down at his usual spot. Draco followed him, and making a point to not get called out on what Ginny did this morning, he promptly asked, “Is this seat taken?”.
“Hello class, I am Professor Amy Tallivex. You can call me Professor Tallivex. I will be teaching you everything you need to know and more.” Bella started. “Today, we are going to continue learning silent casting. This will give you the benefit of surprise on your side. I hear you weren’t successful with Professor Snape?” A murmur of assent went through the classroom.
Before Ron could say anything though, his mother had made her way over to the Gryffindor table. “Is there a problem here, Mr. Potter?” she asked kindly.
Vault 1,325 - Hufflepuff Possession Vault - Helga Hufflepuff’s Portrait, Helga Hufflepuff’s Diary, Helga Hufflepuff’s Potion Notebook, and Helga Hufflepuff’s Spell Book
Hadrian woke up the next morning. “Hadrian, when I was your age, this book helped me in achieving immortality. I hope that you’ll find the same.” his father said, handing him a book titled: The Secrets of the Darkest Arts. “Thank you, dad.” Hadrian said, “Can I call you that?” he asked.
Vault 530 - Potter Possession Vault - James Potter’s Portrait, Lily Potter’s Portrait, and Lily Potter’s Potion Journal
“Maybe?” Hadrian asked, cockily with a goofy grin one only sees after someone has been particularly naughty.
“Yeah, look. Short answer is no. The long answer is because. And the after I thought about it for a while answer is still no.” Hadrian said in a short tone.
“Mr. Potter, are you dating Miss. Weasley and do you want her in your lap right now?” she asked knowing full well her son’s answer.
“That’s good. It sucked that it happened, but I suppose it’d be a bit suspicious if he let that go.” Ron said, oblivious to the anger Hermione was feeling as she spoke those lies. “But I’m still never gonna get detention again. I realized it wasn’t worth it as I was writing those lines.” she said. Oooh. That was all her. He didn’t force that as a part of the geas, only the nature of such. Seems like the punishment got through to her. Fear could do marvelous things.
P.S. Please don’t invite Ron or Hermione. They have been grating on my nerves and I’d rather they not come. They don’t know I’m irritated with them, which makes it more frustrating. I’ll tell you all about it on Saturday though.
“My herbology textbook. And you of all people Hermione, should know it’s rude to interrupt people who are reading.” Hadrian snipped. Hermione was always reading. She should understand the need for privacy while reading and studying. She is a classic mudblood, but still. Merlin it got annoying at times.
When everything was over, Hadrian and Tom apparated back to Riddle Manor. Bellatrix had been livid when she’d been informed what Dumbledore had done to her Hadrian and had to have seven calming draughts before she could fully calm down.
The prophecy then ends there. Harry and Tom look at eachother. Apparently, there was a high probability of having many compulsions, spells, and blocks based on the prophecy alone. They were dual dark lords. Harry needed to get to Gringotts right away for a full blood test.
“Toxic environment,” Harry snorted, “Toxic is an understatement. My aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were muggles. Petunia knew of magic because of Lily and Vernon because of Petunia through Lily, but that didn’t mean they liked it. They HATED magic with a passion. I was left on their doorstep in the middle of the night in November with a note, and Petunia and Vernon had the marvelous idea to stamp the magic out of me. My accidental magic was called freakishness and was severely punished. Naturally, I had a lot of it. Oftentimes, I’d be locked in my cupboard without food or water for days, weeks on end. I was also beaten by my uncle Vernon before being sent to my cupboard. I had an insane amount of chores as well. I had to work harder than your old house elf Dobby worked probably. I had to cook three meals a day, vacuum and mop the whole house, weed and trim aunt Petunia’s rose bushes (which were quite thorny), paint the fence when it got worn out, make all the beds, clean the bathrooms, clean and fold the laundry, clean the windows, and dust the whole house ever since I could remember. The chores probably started when I was four or something. Even when I wasn’t in trouble, I had to sleep in my cupboard because Dudley’s second room stored all his old toys. To make matters worse, I had no friends because Dudley scared anyone who tried to talk to me away and I could never do better than Dudley in school or I would be punished by my aunt and uncle. I rarely got food and when I did, it was scraps. Dudley also set up a game called Harry Hunting with his gang, where they’d chase me. If they caught up to me, they’d beat me up. My aunt and uncle were convinced that Dudley could do no wrong, and any other adults would only tell my aunt and uncle. They got me the cheapest glasses they could find and never checked my prescription after that, and that was only when the school called and told them I couldn’t see the board. I never got vaccinations or saw a doctor of any sort other than when I was severely sick and my aunt thought I might die. Magic was considered the m-word and was forbidden. I never got any presents on my birthday or even acknowledgement that it was my birthday every year. I got Dudley’s old clothes and Dudley was huge, so they never fit me.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right.” Draco smiled, “Well I always wanted to be a representative for goblins. After Professor Binns started teaching, I thought that since history is written by the victors, History of Magic was probably not very accurate. I want to interview goblins at Gringotts in addition to figuring out what actually happened in the past. If wizards trust goblins to handle their money, then goblins are much more capable than we give them credit for. I want to spread the truth about goblins and raise cooperation between goblins and wizards.”
“Yes, yes, yes.” Dumbledore said, placating the growing whispers. “Professor Tallivex will be taking over Defense Against the Dark Arts.” Several more whispers broke out at this. “Professor Snape will still teach Potions, but due to his busy schedule, Amy, here, will be taking over Defense.” Dumbledore said, quieting the chatter. Amy smirked ever so slightly.
“Are you playing devil’s advocate for you know who? Because I’ll tell you, I support you through and through. I wouldn’t betray you or the light.”
Brilliant! He thought. And seven was smart. It was a powerful number. What would he want to use for his objects? While he was pondering this question, Hermione and Ron approached him. “Hey mate, we haven’t talked much lately. We’ve missed you. What’s up.” Ron said, interrupting Hadrian’s line of thought. “Yeah. Hey what are you reading there?” Hermione asked, peeking over his shoulder.
“Alright. Let’s eat at the Gryffindor table though so that we can piss off Ginny while we are at it.”
Finally, they arrived at school. Draco and Harry got off the train and headed up to the castle. Harry knew that Ron would likely not be happy, but frankly, Harry did not care. Draco had the potential to be a great friend. They entered the great hall and only then, did they separate and go to their respective tables. They were allowed to sit wherever they wanted to at meals, even at other tables, but at feasts - like the sorting feast - they were required to sit with their houses. People tended to sit with their house even at regular meals. Harry actually couldn’t think of an exception to that rule that he’d seen so far. Well, that’d have to change this year.
“QUIT?!?! YOU CAN’T QUIT! YOU’RE HARRY BLOODY POTTER AND THE BEST SEEKER GRYFFINDOR HAS EVER HAD! WITHOUT YOU, SLYTHERIN WILL BE SURE TO WIN THE CUP AND BESIDES, YOU CAN’T NOT PLAY QUIDDITCH. IT’S YOUR THING!” Oliver exploded.
“Grenjar! That’s 100 points from Gryffindor for disrespecting a professor and detention with Professor Snape this evening. I shall inform him of the details of your detention.” Bella snapped. Damn. There went respecting authority for Granger. More like respecting authority when she felt like it. He smothered a giggle as Granger started talking again.
Alright! Sorry for the long wait,I have been extraordinarily busy. I'm going to try to be more consistent from now on (I promise). Oh I feel like I should add a warning for this chapter. Uhhh, a beloved character dies. I'm not going to say who, that's for you to read and find out. That happens this chapter. Thanks for reading. I think you'll like this chapter. :)
Tom had excelled in all subjects, though some of his Inner Circle taught Harry some of the courses so he could learn from a variety of people. Neville, Fred/George, Luna, and Draco had all been on the same schedule. They now excelled and were more than pleased. They also had learned and mastered Legilimency and Occlumency on the weekends. Harry was sitting in potions, reflecting on this, when he felt his mark burn. He glanced at his friends, and noticed their left arms were feeling similar to Harry’s. He glanced up at Snape, and could tell that Snape felt it too. Class was over in five minutes, so they’d apparate away then. That was another thing. They’d been taught how to apparate over Yule so that they didn’t have to rely on Portkeys and Floo every time they were called. They were quite skilled and would no doubt shock everyone when they officially passed their apparition tests and got their licenses so quickly. He smirked at that thought.
Harry showed up only five minutes after Draco arrived. They got to work right away. Surprisingly enough, with just a little guidance from Draco, Harry found that he was a natural at potions, similar to DADA, and enjoyed the subject. They had lunch at the Gryffindor table, with some of the second years to avoid a confrontation, and then headed back to the room.
“None of that. Now, you are a true equal. You will rule by my side with me, as you are me.” “Then what should I call you?”
“Good job!” She said with a grin. “You, what did you say your name was?” Bella asked, pointing at Hermione. Bellatrix knew Hermione’s name of course, but why use it if ‘forgetting’ it would just rile the girl up?
Harry started with the Weasley twins. “Hey Fred! Hey George!” He called to them. He greeted them at the Burrow --- he hadn’t gone back to school just yet and was staying at the Burrow before they’d go to Platform 9 ¾. They came over and gave him a hug. Harry motioned them up to his room. “I want to hear all about your shop. Tell me about it in your room?” Harry asked.
Fred and George loved the fact that they were a part of the Dark Order. Fred, George, Luna, and Neville had been initiated into their lords’ inner circle last week, and had been trained in a variety of new and exciting spells. They were honored. The only downside that Fred and George could see, would be that it would be hard to hide the reason they’d be wearing a lot more long sleeved shirts. For now, it’d be fine, because it was Winter, but in the Summer, it’d be difficult to explain that to their somewhat crazed mum. Molly Weasley was very observant at times and when it came to anything slightly unusual about Fred and George, she’d assume it was rebellion against her (which in a sense this was) and attempt to stamp it out. Long sleeves in the summer most definitely would count as rebellion.
“I lied when I said that I wanted to talk to you about the business. I have some questions I want to ask you without prying ears trying to listen in.”
“What?” Bella asked, looking up at the pained expression, “Oh. That. Hads, already?” she asked much to Hermione’s horror and dismay. “Yup. Now’s as good a time as ever. Ay? You wanna go?” Hadrian replied.
“Our parents chose this as their fight. They knew what they were getting into. They could’ve stayed neutral, instead they took a side. They knew that by fighting, they could die. They chose it as a worthy cause. They sent Death Eaters to Azkaban after stunning them and dementors can be worse than death. Some of those Death Eaters had families too. What is your opinion on the Dark?” Harry asked.
Hadrian hated that he’d signed off with his muggle-sounding name, but knew that Hagrid couldn’t be suspicious. To mask his involvement with the death, nobody would know about their meeting. He’d wipe his magical signature and as Heir of all four founders and therefore Hogwarts, he’d apparate them out of the castle and to knockturn alley to do the job. A mystery, sure, but nothing that could be solved even if the Aurors tried.
Harry walked into the room right on time, and sat down in the front row. He purposefully mirrored their Lord’s posture. Their Lord didn’t mind if his Inner Circle did so to intimate other Death Eaters, as long as they didn’t abuse the privilege. Harry certainly counted as Inner Circle --- he’d been told by the Dark Lord himself --- even though he hadn’t been officially marked yet. Severus flinched slightly, but masked his discomfort quickly and yelled at him to start gutting flobberworms. Ugh. He hated that. No thanks.
“Yup. Ronald here doesn’t approve of my boyfriend.” Hadrian said somewhat loudly out of spite to Ginny. Hadrian imagined that Bellatrix was beaming inside, but she managed to maintain a neutral outward appearance.
“Umm… Draco,” Harry started hesitantly, “I wanted to apologize for being a jerk to you. It wasn’t fair of me to judge you based on your house. You don’t have to believe me or forgive me, but I’ll try and put aside my initial feelings towards Slytherin in the future and won’t bother you and your friends anymore. I’m sorry.” Harry looked up at Draco who was staring at his feet.
Harry felt bad for being unkind to Draco. He’d been thinking about their rivalry, and suspected that Draco was actually a decent person underneath his Slytherin mask. It had been rude for him to reject Draco’s hand when he introduced himself, and there had been no way for Draco to have known how he grew up. He should give Draco another chance. The least he could do was apologize.
“Are you sure about that? How about 50 punctorum from Severus for disrespect to an equal.” Harry said with a smirk. The Dark Lord had created the punctorum system off of the Hogwarts point system, for ranking his Death Eaters, but it was on an individual basis, and he kept it tallied in a self-updating notebook for that sole purpose. Severus looked visibly shaken at these words.
“We aren’t. You will know, but we placed a geas on you add soon as you entered this room. You will be unable to say, wrote, hint, or use an magical or muggle means to inform anyone anything other than ‘I wrote lines in detention’ in regards to this detention. You can’t give us away either. And don’t worry. No one will suspect: hence why you weren’t crucioed.” Hadrian said, giggling.
Draco went first. His was a thirteen year old girl who’d told her parents everything that went on in the wizarding world every summer. She’d attended Hogwarts before she was captured. Draco started with a classic crucio, before sending a blood boiling curse for a minute before canceling it. Then he sent an entourage of other creative spells, before he finally sent the killing curse at her. The death eaters laughed and clapped when she slumped over dead. “Draco Malfoy, I welcome you to my Inner Circle.” Voldemort announced, as Draco pulled back his hood and received his mask and robes. Then, it was Harry’s turn. Harry was excited. He had been thrilled ever since his wand had had the trace removed from it, and had been waiting for this moment ever since.
Next, Harry decided to talk to Luna and Neville. On the ride back, Luna came into his compartment, and told him “The answer is yes, by the way.” When he asked what she meant, she simply told him that the wrackspurts had told her that Harry was going to invite her to join the Dark Army and that she was interested. This surprised Harry. It sounded like she could sense magic --- not a seer --- but something similar. He’d have to look into it later.
Vault 531 - Marauders Vault - Copy of the Marauders Map, Prongs, Padfoot, Moony, and Wormtail’s pranking notebook, pranking supplies, and a large supply of wolfsbane.
Hadrian was in the Library reading Secrets of the Darkest Arts glamored as their Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook. It talked about Horcruxes - a part of one’s soul stored in an object. That soul fragment could bring the person back to life even after their initial body died. So that must be how his dad had been able to come back even after thirteen years of supposedly having been vanquished. Horcruxes seemed practical. In order to create a horcrux, one had to perform a bunch of rituals and kill someone. That seemed easy enough and like a small price to pay for immortality. Could he create multiple horcruxes though? He’d have to ask his father. He wrote out a note:
“I can take my firebolt back because it’s MY firebolt. It was given to me and I never gave it to the school. Also, McGonagall can’t force me to play either, so don’t try to pull that bullshit on me.” After having said that, Oliver stomped off - probably to try and go get McGonagall.
“I beg your pardon, but I don’t see how Ginevera could have mistook me as her boyfriend when I have never shown so much as a slight bit interested her in that way.” Hadrian replied coolly, “Magic has already accepted my words that I will never like her in that way unless under compulsions or potions.” Hadrian added.
“Kivaro!” Bellatrix and Hadrian said, cursing her in unison with a ton of force. The mother-son team threw their heads back in laughter as her delicious screams filled the room. They held her under the curse for fifteen minutes this time. “Who are you?” she moaned.
He headed to the locker room and changed into his regular robes. “Good game, Draco,” Hadrian said, shaking Draco’s hand. “You too, Hads,” Draco replied. Hadrian smiled back at him. His father had told him Severus was feeling overworked, but Dumbledore didn’t have any good alternatives. His father was going to have an Amy Tallivex - an American half-blood - offer to teach. She’d have full credentials and was the daughter of Logan Tallivex and Cressa Tallivex - two light wizards who were killed in a gory fashion by “prejudicial” pure-bloods two years ago. She’d moved to England to teach DADA at Hogwarts.
In a week, he’d be boarding the Hogwarts Express at Platform 9 ¾, so he could apologize on the train. What was the worst thing that could happen? He could get laughed at, but it seemed like it was worth the risk. In the meantime, he could think about what he could say.
“Sure!” the twins replied in unison. Up in the room, Harry locked the door behind him and cast a series of silencing spells and privacy wards.
Harry came back to school. For this half of the year, he would be working on recruiting less traditional dark students to the dark order. He created a list of potential members:
Harry was working with Ron in Potions. Severus seemed to find this incredibly funny, and Harry heard muffled giggles whenever Severus was peeking at them out of the corner of his eye. Apparently, the man would adapt with Harry’s new found loyalty towards the dark. Harry was peeking at Draco out of the corner of his eye though. Draco’s luscious blond hair and those piercing grey eyes and that sharp aristocratic jaw line, and shit! He was getting distracted. Since when did Draco Malfoy become so hot? Hmmm. He’d have to ask him next time he saw him. Harry imagined kissing those soft lips, shit! Distracted again! If he keeps getting distracted Ron was going to mess up his potion. Okay. That took all thoughts of attraction out of Harry’s mind. Ron. Ugh! Talk about hideous.
Later that day, Harry handed the letter to Draco to deliver. Hermione was stressing about studying and Ron was complaining about studying, while Harry was just plain studying in the common room that evening.
Potions was as it usually was, the only difference being his increase in competence for the subject. He needed time to question Severus, so he had to get detention with Snape. That shouldn’t be hard given how much the man hated him. He tossed a wink at Draco and tossed a random ingredient in. His potion turned a dark yellow and stopped bubbling. It actually wasn’t random --- he’d made sure it wouldn’t hurt anyone --- but Snape would give him a detention for it either way, so it didn’t need to be dangerous.
“Ugh! Remember when I found out that I was the next dark lord because I could speak to snakes? When will my house EVER let me not be anyone but their alleged savior.”
Harry snuck onto the Hogwarts train with Draco, and avoided contact with Dumbledore. They got off, and immediately side-along apparated to Riddle Manor with an Tom Marvolo Riddle who looked like a middle aged version of Diary-Tom. Tom showed Harry his new bedroom and Draco his guest room for the holidays. Additionally, a personal house-elf was assigned to both of them. Draco’s was called Haddie and Harry’s was called Friva. They settled in and had a relaxing rest of the day. Dinner was brought up to them and they eventually fell asleep.
