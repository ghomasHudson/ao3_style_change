‘Now- your second mistake is that you said ‘we’. There is no we. You are mine, for my use and pleasure only. You are nothing.’ I almost said that last part. Almost. But I saw the look in his eyes, I saw how he had responded when I stroked his hair. I felt the knots getting more tangled in the pits of my stomach. I couldn’t do it. He was so submissive and desperate, and although I mock him, even though I hate him, I could NOT do it.
I fell in love with my hair. ohh… it was a long time ago. I will give you the permission to touch it only if you are a dom. my dom. my aggressive and sexy dom, that will actually choke me if i’ll try to resist.
After finishing, I came out, and decided to... tease him a bit more. I decided to play with this whiny bottom, ‘cause the stifled voices he made when he heard me- was something that I wanted to hear (and see) more of. I thought it would be hilarious.
Haaaa I'm so happy now.
I pulled out my cock, which was nearly fully erect at this point. “Suck,” I ordered, immediately pushing my cock past Draco's petite lips. He nearly choked but gathered his bearings quick enough and started sucking. "Ahhh... Just like a bitch in heat." He tried saying something, but I acted fast, grabbing onto his hair and pulling him forward, causing him to nearly gag on my cock. “I didn't ask for your opinion slut… just do your job.” I tightened my fingers in Draco's hair as I continued to speak, “You like it, don't you? Of course you do, like the bitch that you are.” Draco looked up at me with his big, gray eyes that were filled with lust … fuck. Amazing. “You love this, and I have you all to myself,” I moaned as I started to fuck his mouth. He whimpered prettily around my cock, sounding exactly like a little girl- so sexy. “I can't hold on anymore.” I told him, mere seconds before pulling out my cock and coming all over his face. “Ahhh…” I moaned. “That was brilliant, you are such a good sucker.” I slapped him in the face and gathered some of the come on his cheeks, coating my fingers with them and bringing them to his lips. “Lick it, you little whore.” He opened his mouth and obediently licked every last drop off my fingers. I gazed at him in awe as he crossed every challenge I threw at him- he is so beautiful like that. Achingly so.
I dug my fingers into his skin at his hips, pulling his body closer. I saw the marks that were being left, like my own personal brand on his skin. After thrusting once, twice, thrice, I buried myself deep in his hole as I came with a shout.
“Have you prepared yourself?” I asked him… calmly this time. Way more calmly. He silently nodded. “Such a little whore,” I laughed as he turned beet red. “Take off your clothes,” I added, which he managed to do at a remarkable speed- in 5 seconds flat, there he was, standing naked before my very eyes. “You’re my horny bitch, aren't you? And you just LOVE it.” His cock was hard, and so was mine. “On your knees pet. NOW!'' My command got him so excited, causing him to almost fall over as he scrambled to get down on his knees.
I didn’t bother wrapping a towel around myself. He could, and actually saw, my whole amazing body, and reacted by making an unintelligible noise at the back of his throat. This little whore actually had the audacity to whimper at the sight of me. Well bitch, enjoy it while you can. When I end up fucking you, you will scream and cry until your throat becomes hoarse.
So I take care of my hair, and do manicure, and want to be a Disney princess, but that does NOT mean that I - that I am like that. And of course i DON'T love the filthy potter. Now shut up annoying voices in my head and let me write.
That was when his locker caught my eye. His big, shining, spotless locker. Oooohhh… that would be a good idea to capture his attention. At first, I tried breaking it open. What could be more humiliating, and yet so conspicuous for him if not all his expensive materials, spread out to form a degrading, truthful sentence? Unfortunately, this idiot used too many locking spells to seal his locker. Of course. Why didn't I listen when he was talking about the new charms that his father had taught him over the summer?
Oh, that’s right, because I have a life.
I thought maybe- maybe I could taunt him by saying something, or... no. It had to be captivating. He had to see just how much of a little bitch he really is.
He starts throwing clothes on, but for some reason, it seems to be happening in slow-motion!! I could have sworn that it was the longest foreplay in the world, the tease, but it’s freaking not! This is the most I’ll ever get to see of him! *cue dramatic gay noises*
Instead, I had to improvise and use what I had- a lot of wax, the kind that I used to polish my broom, and shaving cream. I don't think he even uses any of those products… Why would he? He would never let his precious, delicate hands get dirty, let alone have the courage to be an actual man…
And Potter? Potter is the most disgusting person I've ever known. First, his hair is terrible. like it's not enough, he is also proud of this. do you understand?? Be proud of such a bad thing?! He enjoyed messing it up, making it look like he had just come off the broom. “Like his father,” Papa says, trying to make me shut up. But I just- I can't! so arrogant! It's killing me.
I'll try to aploed more often... but what do you think? shold I spleat the chapters and publish the moment I have kind of enogh words, or make long chapters?
yes, I stoppes befor the smut.
-we are leaving. we just now leaving!
So he strips the rest of the clothes off his body and carefully places his glasses aside before entering the shower on the left of me (right next to mine aaa) and proceeds to turn on the water.
Before leaving, I pause to see what he could have possibly wanted to do with my locker. I gasp horrifically when I spot it. There, in big, bold, block letters, written across my locker, with what seems to be… melted wax (from his broomstick polishing kit, no doubt), and- and shaving cream… glaring back at me is this exact sentence: “Malfoy is a horny bottom.”
I'm Draco Lucius Malfoy, and I'm a well-groomed heterosexual who takes care of his hair and loves Nutella. And yes, also writing a diary. That's pretty nice actually, unless you have stupid friends who push their noses everywhere---- never mind. I will cast better spells and it won't happen again.
He opened his mouth to say something but I beat him to it.
I’ll explain.
I have to stop. I sound like a gay in love. Which I most certainly am not. Hmpf…
(See the end of the chapter for
I write a diary, ‘cause I am so, sooo! tangled and arrogant soul. my soul is tortured, you see? Got stuck with all these inferior people… It's exhausting.
HARRY FRICKING POTTER. The one who stars in all my fantasies -when I kill him! Or mercilessly mock him! Or.. or- I hate this cursed diary. Always putting words in my mouth------- so he comes out. WITHOUT A BLOODY TOWEL! And his half hard dick is huge and amazingly still erect after doing Merlin knows what in the showers! And his divine arse is mouthwatering in the craziest possible way, and... why do you keep putting words in my mouth? I am a very staunch straight, who hates Gryffindors like him. Or boys. Of any kind. I hate boys. And his ridiculous, messy hair? Come on. How can anybody like such a wildly unkempt yet such an effortless- enoughhhhh!
I snuck up behind him and whispered in a lower, sexier voice- “So you actually came.” He froze, and I almost started laughing. “I hope you understand what we’ll be doing now,” I stated boldly, and he just nodded minutely. “Such a good boy…” I purred, and I swear the moment he heard that he started trembling. What a little whore.
I inserted a finger into his mouth and ordered him to suck it. After awhile, I pulled it out and pushed it into his arsehole, feeling his narrow rectum. He threw his head back and groaned at the feeling. “P-Please sir…” he whispered.
Malfoy looks at him with a ferocious, but appreciative smile. His eyes rake over Harry’s body, drinking him in. Harry flushes even darker. He’s never felt this wanted in his life.
The Counts loud laugh reverberates inside Harry. ‘Oh, Precious. Be careful what you wish for. I might offer it.’
Smut suggestions are more than welcome!
‘Saviour?’ The Count asks, ‘Stop thinking. What happens at the ball, stays at the ball.’ Harry gasps into his mouth as the Count pushes him closer, his hands returning to his arse. His tongue laps Harry’s mouth, and then he slithers down to his neck. Harry tilts it to give the Count better access. He suckles on his pressure points. Harry moans. The Count presses his crotch against Harry’s. He feels the outline of the Count’s hardening cock against his own erection. Harry moans again. The Count’s fingers slide up to Harry’s blouse. He looks inquiringly at Harry. ‘May I open these?’
‘Yes, I’m fine. Don’t worry. I think all the partying has left it’s ma-oh...’ a very arousing suck cuts off his speech. ‘Left it’s mark.. I’m sorry aurors. My head is killing me.’ To emphasize his words, he grabs his head and frowns deeply. Harry keeps on stroking him in an even rhythm under the table, sucking softly at his tip. Draco keeps his hands above the table, to prevent the young aurors from jumping to conclusions.
Harry has three fingers in his arse now and starts to scissor them a bit. His eyes roll back in pleasure. I see his cock filling even more, standing proud.
‘Don’t worry. You may sleep here, should you want.’ The Count looks questioningly, his eyes vulnerable, as if he’s trying to find out if he’s crossing a line.
‘Just relax. Let your throat adjust, feel the rhythm. Breath through your nose. If you can’t breathe, just let my prick slide out a bit.’ Harry’s fingertips circle Draco’s scalp, massaging him. Draco suppresses a moan.
‘You will obey me.’
‘Someone new? Ginny wouldn’t want you hiding away, you know. Wasting your life. The purpose of our life is to at least try and be happy.’
Lost a couple of pieces when
I close my eyes and I press my forehead against his. We’re standing in silence. Neither of us moving. I feel Harry’s breathing evening out. He isn’t making those small sounds that follow after crying ones eyes out anymore. Believe me, I know how they sound. I wailed after Harry left me, the sheer volume of it could’ve drowned out a howler. I flung all my china through the room and then broke down until I was reduced to a sore, raw bundle of sad despair.
‘It’s a bit over the top? Like an uptown brothel?’ Fuck. He’s insulting he Count. Stupid.
‘Malfoy, this won’t do at all. A bit of frotting isn’t enough to get you food. Stop wasting time and take out your own cock.’
Bellatrix. After the duel with Molly, they left her for dead. But when the aurors went to fetch the bodies, she was nowhere to be found. Until this day no one knows what happened to her. Thinking Draco might be somewhere near her, makes his stomach twist uncomfortably. ‘What happened?’
A pesky ray of sunlight is forcing itself obtrusively in Draco’s eyes. Draco finds himself waking from it, in the middle of the day. Disoriented for a minute, he looks around and sees Harry in his bed. Wait, not his bed. Harry’s. Harry is looking at him like he’s the most gorgeous thing he’s ever seen.
‘What would you like him to do now, hun? Do you want him to lick me until I scream?’
After he retracts his cock, he falls down, onto my chest. I stroke his hair.
‘Tell him. Mrs. Plymouth called again about her neighbors habits.’ Draco suppresses a moan as Harry lips circle his crown, sucking gently.
‘Mrs. Potter. We are looking for an extremely rare version of an invigoration draught.’
Harry gets on his knees and slicks his cock. ‘There now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?’ He takes Draco’s leg and puts it over his shoulder, while Draco wraps his other leg around Harry’s waist. He rubs his cock against Draco’s entrance. Slowly, Harry pushes in. ‘Fuuuuck.’ Draco’s posh voice swearing profanities does strange things to Harry’s prick. Harry keeps on pushing, until he’s fully buried inside. He takes a moment to enjoy the warm, tight confines of Draco’s perfect arse.
‘No, you REALLY like watching. The sort of watching that borders fetishism.’ Ginny strokes her hands over my body, before pushing me onto the chair.
Harry looks at him intensely. ‘You know I’m a senior auror and I can heal your ankle quite expertly? So we can finish our game? I can do it here, but I’m no healer. The spot will remain a sore one. A very sore one. It will hurt when pressured.’ His eyes are almost black, a tiny slither of green still visible.
‘I won’t last long.’ The roughness in Malfoy’s posh voice sends a shiver down Harry’s spine.
We eat in silence. My margret de canarde is heavenly. I ordered for the both of us, as Harry almost ordered langue de boeuf. When I asked him if he always likes to eat beef tongue or if he’s feeling particularly adventurous tonight, he paled a bit. That’s why he’s eating a steaming bowl of Ratatouille now.
‘Harry?’ He doesn’t reply. ‘Har? You can talk to me, luv. What’s up? Did you find the stories a tad bit arousing? It’s nothing to be ashamed of. A lot of DrarryShipper1981’s readers  seem to think so.’ He gets up and starts pacing the room.
A short chapter. I’m working on a lengthier  one, hopefully today it will be finished.
I smile. He turns me around to spoon me and fondles with my hair.
‘Yeah, someone might’ve. But I didn’t expect a prissy werewolf princess with blonde locks.’ Harry manages his voice to only shake a little bit, as he hopes the insult will have the desired effect.
(See the end of the chapter for
Suddenly he doesn’t know what to say anymore.
‘I will do that.’ Narcissa nods.
‘Harry! I’m so glad to see you.’ Hermione’s exhausted face beams at him happily, while she is trying to shush the crying baby on her hip.
‘No, I don’t want to leave.’
‘No, please. My husband. It will end his career.’
I take him deeper in my mouth, hollowing my cheeks and sucking him off. My mouth produces sinful sloppy sounds as I lick, suck and swallow his prick. I love giving oral sex. And I know Harry loves receiving it. His hands are on my hair, he guides me. I pull back a bit. ‘Fuck my mouth?’ I ask him. He looks at me with pupils so dilated, I can barely see the beautiful emerald color. Not that I’m complaining. Everyone should have someone who looks at you that feral as he does at me now.
I push the buttons. The doors close and the lift starts to make a thrumming noise, before it’s starting to move. Draco looks like he’s on the verge of a full fledged panic attack. I grab his arse and pull him close.
Boy Toy starts groaning and comes in long, hot spurts over Draco’s hair and back, making him filthy and sticky. Sexy Arse stills. The thickening of his cock is a telltale sign for Draco. Sexy Arse tries to take his cock out, but Draco grabs his shaft and sucks out his orgasm. Sexy Arse screams his name as he comes. Draco feels his semen coating his throat as he swallows it down to the last drop.
Well, enough reminiscing. The here and now needs my attention, as Thé Bitch is here, bringing Harry a drink. She is pushing her boobs up while delivering it, enlarging her cleavage and making Harry look flustered. And not the ‘I’m-gay-so-I-don’t-know-what-to-do-with-a-pair-of-boobs-oh-my-God-this-is-awkward’ kind of flustered. No, it’s a ‘you-look-fucking-hot-and-if-my-boyfriend-wasn’t-here-I’d-shag-you-right-now’ blush.
He has no idea how long they’ve been at it.
” Draco exclaims, his brow furrowed. He was now leaning closer towards Harry and putting a hand on his arm across the small bar table between them. Oh god. He was so close. Harry wanted to speak quietly so that Draco might have to do that again.
He’s lost.
“Two Galleons and fifteen Knuts, please.”
The bar Draco chose was a muggle one. It was loud and happy, with historical memorabilia lining the walls. Harry was too nervous in the first couple of minutes of being there to notice that it was a 1920’s-themed bar, and that Draco Malfoy was a goddamn
. Draco is wearing a necklace. How he wants to touch it.
Draco laughs. It’s a magnificent sound. And it makes Harry lift his head again.
“Are you kissing me because you’re– because we’re drunk?”
Draco nods sympathetically.
“No?”
“Yes, Teddy?” Andromeda says evenly. She’s used to Teddy’s dramatics. Harry catches Draco’s startled expression at the commotion as it changes into an amused and fond look he gives the panting little boy. Harry couldn’t determine which of them was cuter.
A few hours later, the three of them step out of Borgin and Burke’s, their last stop for the day. Harry loses focus once more, looking at Draco and Teddy holding hands and talking animatedly with each other about something or other a little further along the street.
“What, sorry?”
A few months ago Andromeda had insisted that they start calling each other by their first names. She had said they sounded like schoolboys and Harry secretly agreed. Recently, Harry began feeling things...
Draco raises an eyebrow as he downs the shot.
Harry always felt so welcome in Andromeda and Teddy’s home. And he could not imagine his life without the presence of an excitable, talkative Teddy.
Draco brings their lips together achingly slowly.
As they all sat down with their mugs of tea, Andromeda asks, “Draco, dear, how is your research going?”
“No worries, Malfoy.”
“Like what?”
Harry is rooted to the spot, watching the pair of them. He can hear Teddy talking animatedly about Andromeda and her chocolate eating habits. Draco has a small smile on his face but looks slightly uncomfortable.
Andromeda looks at him seriously and puts a hand on his shoulder. “Teddy, sweetheart. It’s going to be alright, let’s go look over the things Harry bought you for school, alright?” She gets up and follows a nervous Teddy into the hallway to his bedroom. She glances back at her guests and gives them an apologetic smile. Harry smiles back and looks after them fondly.
Draco releases a breath and eyes the ceiling, looking as if a physical weight has been lifted from his shoulders.
“Yes, the muggle drug was quite helpful. The anxiety potions currently being given in magical hospitals do not do a good job because they sedate more than anything else.” Draco looks over at him again with a searching gaze, probably knowing Harry would understand. “They’re not very useful in small doses, and even then, it has a sedation effect that is undesirable for long-term treatment, to put it lightly.”
“Yes! I saw her doing it!”
It is three drinks and a shot later when Harry decides it would be an absolutely fantastic moment to ask Draco something he had wanted to know for a while now. He wants to know
TWELVE HOURS
As if hearing his thoughts, Draco dips a finger into his shot-glass and sucks his finger while maintaining eye contact with Harry.
. Now Harry was imagining Draco in his pyjamas.
It seems like the bastard is not nearly as drunk as he should be after the drinks they’ve had. Fucking hot arsehole. He feels like a right knob next to him.
“Well, I do have some time, actually,” Draco retracts, jumping slightly at Teddy’s sudden cry of delight. “I can go buy my potion ingredients later on."
Harry sees Andromeda looking between the two of them with an amused expression. She can probably see Harry’s feelings all over his face. He just hopes Draco doesn’t.
They were now a few shots more drunk. Harry honestly can’t remember how many. They’ve been talking for hours.
“Old habits, I guess?” Harry smiles.
Harry laughs loudly. “Yes, I guess we have been…”
“I know, right?”
“Oh, well… mostly things I was feeling after the war and was still feeling when I was going to the academy. I had difficulties breathing sometimes, and more rarely– flashbacks that came back so strongly I couldn’t do anything for days.” Draco looks down at his hands and shakes his head shortly. “That professor, she… completely changed my view on those things.”
“What is it? Did I do something wrong?” Draco steps back and removes his arms from Harry's waist, looking concerned.
Harry suspects that Draco and him had kept inadvertently challenging each other with how much they could drink. Harry is finding out quite quickly that he cannot hold his liquor nearly as good as Draco can.
“Yes, exactly.” He looks over at Harry, his brow furrowed. “Now I have to figure out how to incorporate it into my potion. The aim is to make a potion that can eliminate the overwhelming fear without making the patient sleepy and unfocused as it does with muggle drugs or sedated like the potions we use now. So it’s a bit of…” Draco looks over at Andromeda for a moment before returning his glance to Harry. “…taking the best elements of both worlds and making something new with more benefits and little to no drawbacks.”
“Of course, Mr. Potter, sir! That’s okay.”
After a few moments Harry feels his thoughts running. Anxiety bubbles up again so he takes Draco’s face into his hands once more.
“It seems we must level the playing field.” Draco smirks. “I think you owe me a drink, Potter.”
Draco finally looks around him and eyes Harry, cheeks flushing. Harry quickly regains his composure and walks up to the table to put a hand on Teddy’s shoulder.
Draco lets out a breath as if he’s been holding it. Puts both hands on either side of Harry’s head against the wall and inches closer so slowly that Harry thinks he might’ve gone cross-eyed.
Harry gives him a small smile and Draco returns it, flushing ever so slightly.
“What?!” Harry asks in mock-surprise.
When the three of them had reached an agreement that they purchased everything Teddy needed, they floo’d back to Andromeda’s from the Leaky Cauldron. Draco came along, no questions asked.
Draco sighs. “Convincing the Ministry is not going as well as I had hoped. The ministry is so narrow-minded, telling me I shouldn’t even be looking at any kind of muggle chemistry. Rather ignorant, really. But I must continue, regardless of what happens with the Ministry. They will eventually accept my work, if I can provide enough evidence that the potion is perfectly safe and a significant improvement to any current alternatives.”
, as he’s come to find out.
He is wearing a set of burgundy robes, looking stylish and elegant – something Harry had never been able to master. His hair is long enough to slightly fall into his eyes. It looks so soft.
“They might have even tried to force Dumbledore to change the hat’s decision. I was…
Harry reaches into his jeans pocket, surprised to find it empty. He checks his other pockets. Nothing. Oh no. Not again. He always forgets to leave the house with money, no matter how much he tries to remind himself.
“I like it better when you don’t say Potter and… Malfee.” Teddy says. He looks between them with big eyes, before returning to his task of eating his ice cream with renewed fervor.
,” Draco almost whispers, and Harry thinks he would not have been able to hear it at all if he hadn’t been staring at Draco’s mouth.
“Spying, were we?” Harry says, as they turned the corner. Teddy made the wise choice of staying silent.
“I was put in Slytherin because I…because my whole family has always been in Slytherin. It’s what was expected of me, it’s what I expected of myself…and it is just what happened. Had I been sorted into another house; my parents would have thought there was something wrong with me.”
“Oh, I don’t think so,” Draco drawls, something new surfacing beneath the surface of his tone.
“Harry?”
“Why’s that, Potter?”
“Because I want to know. Because I care about your life.” He blushes profusely. He can’t believe he just said that.
Draco and Andromeda give him understanding smiles and Harry can suddenly see the striking familial resemblance in their faces.
“Yeah,” Harry exclaimed. “A while back I had to administer this potion to a child who was having tantrums so strong that she was a danger to her family. Things were thrown around the room and such. But giving her that potion was the most horrible part of it all. It was like taking her fear away, but also her ability to talk to us properly. So it was nearly impossible to get to the root of her problem. Anyway, it was
“What about that Ministry representative you told me about?” Andromeda asks.
“I thought this evening was just beginning, Malfoy.”
“A five-year-old patient is nearly done with her treatment for a rare blood condition, and it looks like she’s going to make a full recovery. It has been exhausting for everyone involved, though,” he chuckles.
long!!” he adds, his mouth full of ice cream that was beginning to dribble onto his chin.
how to emulate the traits that come with being sorted in Slytherin. It was imperative that I did. I didn’t have a choice. I think the hat knew that.”
“Like what?” Harry repeats close to his ear, suddenly serious.
Draco raises an eyebrow, a smile playing on his face. “Can’t argue with that.”
Draco looks in his eyes as if searching for something and takes a deep breath. “It only made me want to kiss you more than usual,” he manages, looking at the ground. Harry’s heart begins racing again. This was probably more than he had intended to admit. It was too dark for Harry to see if Draco was blushing, although he didn’t need proof to know that he was.
“Shall we…get going? Didn’t you say we had to bring him back in time for dinner?” Draco says, raising that damn eyebrow at him, embarrassing him for having drifted off into daydreams about his stupid, dreamy self. Harry’s a mess.
Draco stops in his tracks and whips around violently. “We’ve been calling each other Potter and Malfee all evening, haven’t we?”
“Right, Harry?” Teddy asks, skipping over to Harry.
“Does there ever come a point in... which you aren’t so fucking….elegant?” He puts his face in his hands.
.” Harry hated remembering this; it always made him feel so guilty.
“Thanks, I’ll be back! I’m sorry!” He calls as he hurries out the door, wanting to get outside so he doesn’t leave Teddy outside by himself for too long. After his day out with Teddy, he’ll come back here and pay. And make sure this never happens again.
“Yeah, I see that… Hi, Draco.” He smiles, feeling heat rising up in his cheeks again.
“Really?” Harry whispers and tilts Draco’s face up to him gently.
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco murmurs, eyeing the empty glass in front of him. “What is it with all this deep talk tonight?” He looks back up and smirks at Harry, eyes twinkling.
“I mean...I
“Can you stay for ice cream with me and Harry?! I missed you.”
“I want to kiss you right now. So badly …”
Draco wants him too.
It’s well after two in the morning when they attempt to shuffle their way out of the bar. Draco walks into someone’s chair on their way out and has to lean on Harry for balance. Being quite tipsy himself, Harry struggled to hold onto him and shot an arm out to Draco’s waist to keep him upright, feeling a strip of bare skin where his t-shirt had ridden up. Draco regained his bearings after a few moments- too quickly for Harry's liking.
Harry freezes, instantly embarrassed. As much as he hated dealing with money, he feels even worse at the prospect of owing people money. But Draco smiles widely at him and Harry knows he isn’t angry. A flash of playful challenge flashes in Draco’s eyes. Oh no.
Harry holds his hand out for Teddy to take. “Of course, Teddy. They’re all good Houses, and it doesn’t make a difference to me which one you’ll be in. The hat will put you in the House that suits you best. I can’t be against that, can I, Teddy bear?”
about Draco, really. But this would do for now.
“Yes?”
The soft lips pressing against his are the only thing he can feel. Kissing is the only thing he can do. He never wants to stop. Any thoughts remaining in his head turn to mush with every soft moan, every time their tongues intertwine, every time Draco rakes his fingers into Harry’s much-too-long hair.
“Sorry, Teddy, but I should be on my way.”
Draco looks at Harry with a relieved expression. “Yes, actually. It made me want to know more about myself, if anything. There was a lot of shit under my gorgeous outer shell, just so you know.”
“Draco, I...”
“Good luck, dear. I believe you’ll do well, as I always do,” Andromeda supplies kindly, reaching over to gently pat Draco’s hand. He gives her a small, shy smile in return. “And you, Harry? How’s work been treating you?”
“Oh.” Andromeda looks surprised.
“No,” Harry replies quietly, opting to maintain eye contact despite how uncomfortable he now was. “But you’re making me feel as if I ought to have.”
“GRANDMAAAA!!!!” Teddy yells while running into the sitting room, looking frantic.
Draco straightens up slightly. “Quite well, actually. You remember I told you about that anti-anxiety potion I was working on?” he inquires. At Andromeda’s nod, he continues: “Well, I managed to isolate a chemical I wanted from a muggle SSRI, an antidepressant.”
Harry takes a slow, deep breath and tries to steady himself despite feeling as if his whole world is shaking.
“Why do you ask?”
Draco, of course, arrives a few minutes late looking absolutely gorgeous. He is wearing black tight-fitting jeans and a simple white t-shirt underneath a lightweight black jacket which he rolled up to his elbows, showing off his strong pale arms. He wears a long silver necklace that Harry had never seen before.
Harry laughs. Giggles, really. Because he is utterly
*****
Fortescue’s was finally within view. Harry watches Teddy. He loves seeing his eyes light up at the sight of his favourite ice cream place. Harry is not disappointed- Teddy starts jittering excitedly and lets go of Harry’s hand to run into the store. His godson’s excitement about sugary treats has never failed to amuse Harry.
Draco glances at Harry, unsure and a little bit frightened. Harry nods behind the little boy’s head and smiles.
“She didn’t even look at the card, just took the frog and threw away the rest!”
Yours,
‘Let it go, love. Let me feel that tight, warm hole clench around my cock. You’re so good at this.’ Harry’s praise does it, and Draco comes and comes, his sperm creating long, hot spurts on the tablecloth. He feels Harry moaning with delight, before he passes out. When he recovers, he’s seated again, fully clothed. The desserts are in the middle of the table. No evidence left of their hot fuck.
‘Such a good bitch.’ Malfoy tells him, his eyes still darkened and shining. With a sudden plop, he feels Malfoy dislodging. Gently, he retracts his cock. Harry whines a bit from the loss of it. He feels empty. Malfoy pulls him closer on his lap and kisses him. Without hesitation Harry opens his mouth, allowing Malfoy to claim it. The kiss is sloppy and slow. As Malfoy breaks the kiss, he looks thoughtful.
Harry looks at him. ‘I... I-‘
‘Don’t you dare come, Draco.’ Harry whispers in his ear. He moans.
Hesitantly, Draco steps out from behind the curtain. His long dress rustles as he goes. Harry lets out a surprised gasp. A rush of want seeps through him. Draco looks stunning is his apricot dress.
‘Potter, always the Saviour of fluffy kittens and reformed hitwizards.’ Harry rolls his eyes. ‘You’re not asking. I’m offering.’
‘You will always be the most beautiful woman to me, saggy tits and grey hair or not.’
He flings open his eyes, to see not one, but two Harries on the carpet as a third one enters through the door, wearing nothing but a lopsided grin. Harry has plunged them into a foursome. Draco grins. He knows he can safe word out any time he wants to.
‘Mate!’ Ron runs over to them, a worried look plastered on his face as he sees Draco carry Harry.
‘You start.’
I hum contentedly as he’s stroking my hair.
‘Jesus, Potter. I’ll just split you open. See if I care. What the fuck is wrong with you? You don’t want to feel that fucking pain, trust me.’
It gets him off the hook.
‘Do I tell you enough how much I love you?’ His fingertips are brushing my back, caressing me. I get goose bumps all over. He tenderly kisses my neck as I hum. Every doubt I had about this has disappeared like a puff of smoke. Everything will be fine. This man? He has enough love for a whole bloody army. He can handle another lover beside me. I sigh content.
Draco enjoys the fullness. He feels Harry’s cock stretching him further, and Sexy Arse’s prick filling up his mouth. He has never felt this fulfilled, used and wanted in his whole life and he’s glad Harry’s plunged him into a foursome.
Harry moans. ‘I’m gonna come. So good. You’re so good. So... ah... good... ah...’ Harry’s semen spurts deep into my throat as I come. I swallow it, seeing stars as I gently keep stroking my clit to prolong my orgasm. Harry takes out his cock and lies next to me. ‘I love it when you do that’ He tells me, looking at me like I’m the filthiest, sexiest thing alive. It makes me feel wanted.
In which Harry invites Draco and Ginny helps him with a little problem.
‘I’m not going to repeat myself, ma’am. Spread your legs. Now.’
‘Or I’ll leave, if you rather want that.’
‘Don’t worry, Har. He will be there and you will have a great fuck.’ Harry chokes on his tea and coughs, turning beet red. Luna just smiles her heavenly smile.
Right now she looks nervous.
‘Avada Kedavra.’ Harry’s voice is clear as the green light hits Malfoy. His ability for wandless magic has always been a life saver. He knows he could’ve used any other spell to disarm him, but Malfoy would’ve gotten the kiss in the end. He tells himself he wouldn’t have wanted that.
‘Always.’ Harry grins and gives him a wink. ‘Get over here and eat, before I decide to call the office and call you in ill.’
Harry sits on his ridiculously soft, comfy couch. He has put on boxers and a plain white shirt, that is clearly in love with his abs, as it clings possessively around them. Harry pats the couch next to him. ‘Sit.’
‘Hello gorgeous.’ A sultry bariton whispers in his ears. Harry looks beside him, to see a beautiful wizard bowing slightly. His silk shirt is open to the waist, showing his toned abs. His trousers are sinfully tight. He winks at Harry through his blue mask.
In which Draco and Harry eat and talk, and Draco is pestered by his feelings.
I nod.
‘They had not right, love. No right to put you through this without a way out.’
I hear someone sobbing, hoarse from effort. It takes some time to realize it’s me. Somehow, the tears won’t stop flowing. Images of Draco and Ginny keep clouding my vision, war memories fusing with them. Sometimes my bloody cupboard seeps through too. I can’t control myself.
Draco tears of a piece of the fresh loaf of bread and slides it through the greenest mojo verde he has ever laid eyes on. His hand shakes, he spills some mojo on his hand. Wanting to wipe them clean on his napkin, Harry grabs his wrist in midair and guides his fingers to his mouth. He starts licking his fingers clean, one by one, sucking and blowing as he goes back and forth. Finally he releases Draco’s last finger with a mischievous pop. Draco has to adjust his pants, as his erection is getting uncomfortable to sit in. All of a sudden he’s very aware of his surroundings.
I smile. Ginny clasps her hand over his. ‘I feel the same, hun. We must make certain a fucked up feeling doesn’t last too long. But that’ll be alright. We all are verbally strong people, we can voice what we like and dislike.’
‘Green?’
‘Red.’
‘Mr. Potter, it has come to my ears that you’ve double crossed me. Doing business with another auror too.’
‘But I don’t know you.’
Her brown eyes are blazing. This is one woman to keep on your side and into your sight. I wonder why she is really here. Did he cheat on her? Does she want to get back at him? I consider my answer for a while.
I’m pacing through the room nervously, checking my robes for the umpteenth time. Ginny is barking mad. No, I’m barking mad, for letting her convince me this is a good idea. Maybe I should leave. Yeah, that would be the sensible thing to do. Leave and lie to Malfoy about one of the children being ill. Sounds like a plan.
‘I... I-‘ Draco stutters. Fuck. He hates this. He wants to tell Harry everything, but he lacks the courage. He is afraid Harry will think less of him. He feels tears welling up as he averts his head.
‘I... I should leave now. I don’t want to impose on your hospitality. Thanks again.’
‘When you’re done ogling my arse, Harry, would you mind telling me what I can do for you?’ Dean gives him a small wink. Flirtatious bastard, Harry thinks as his blush deepens.
‘Thank you for last night, Count.’ Harry feels his cheeks redden.
‘Turn around. NOW.’
He nods as I sit up. ‘You know how I started that online writing course?’ He nods again. ‘The stories I have been writing were received rather okay. But they didn’t get a lot of feedback. So I switched to fan fiction.’ Harry looks questioningly.
The golden toast tastes delicious. The tea is absolute blissful perfection in a cup. Sated, he gets up to the shower and has a long, delicious wash. He feels the hot water stream over his sore muscles, making aches slide down the drain together with the water. He wishes he could feel as confident as Harry. Harry, who seems to think he’s wonderful. But really, he isn’t. He’s bony, snarky and damaged. He’s gotten scars all over to prove it. He tries to push these not helping thoughts aside. Washing his hair, that usually helps him get his mind of things. He searches the shower for soap.
"For fuck's sake-" Harry rolled his eyes. "You do want a place in this- my child's life, don't you?" He almost instantly regretted saying 'my' instead of 'our' when a faint look of hurt flashed behind Malfoy's eyes, before shying away back behind his figurative mask.
," There was no venom in his tone, but there was also a certain lack of any emotion at all. Almost as if he was suppressing it.
Malfoy looked to be seriously debating accepting the offer. He hadn't talked for about thirty seconds, and his eyes were focused on the table. "You aren't going to stop asking me until I agree, are you?" He sounded tired, likely tired of Harry's shit.
Back at Draco's apartment, the blond was reluctantly packing away some of his few belongings. Might as well start early, he thought. Hunched over a box, there was another screech of an owl, making Draco jump. He'd been expecting it, but loud noises like that usually made him jump anyway. The blond walked over, wrenched open the rusty window and let Hedwig hop onto the desk for the second time that day. He eagerly took the letter from her.
"Harry?" Draco said quietly, sounding surprised. "What are you doing up so early?"
Harry noticed he didn't sound sincere. He shifted in the water, "You sure?" He asked, concern flooding into his emerald eyes.
Squinting a bit from behind circular frames, Harry watched as Malfoy took a seat across from him. He looked uncomfortable as fuck, constantly fiddling with his hands and shifting in his seat, but soon slid behind a mask, so to speak. It hid all of his insecurities to anyone who didn't know him well; couldn't see behind the mask into his vulnerable innards. The blond git would have looked almost perfect, Harry thought, if it wasn't for the bags under his eyes and the extreme paleness of his skin that Harry wasn't quite sure anyone else would notice. He ordered some tea and waited for the other to say something, as he was admittedly too anxious to do so.
Fifteen minutes later, a short and kind-looking Healer with red hair walked up to them. Draco could've sworn she could be a Weasley if he didn't know better.
"Yes, Mr. Malfoy," Healer Vexmoor said. "His womb. His magic began developing it in the early stages of pregnancy, and it will continue to develop to suit the baby's needs."
Harry was going to tell Hermione first, of course, since they were now flatmates (Ron lived with Neville, whom Harry was sure the Weasley was dating). She was waiting for him in the living room, anyways.
Harry sniffled, wiping his eyes. "Two weeks." He sighed.
"Then we better grow up and be at least civil with each other." Harry said firmly, jutting his finger forward to make a point. What point, however, he didn't know. "And as for how we're going to do this..." He pondered for a moment, then decided, out of impulse, to spit out his idea as soon as it popped into his head. "Come live with me and Hermione, or something." At the look of stubbornness on Malfoy's face, Harry narrowed his eyes. "I'm not about to risk my or- our child's life because of your stupid reputation, or pride, some stupid shit like that. I know that your Manor was taken by the ministry not long after the war. We could work it out." He stared at Malfoy intensely, as if challenging him to say no.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Healer's face soured a bit, but she made an attempt to hide it. "Ah, yes, nice to meet you two as well. I assume you are the other father?" She looked at Draco, and when he awkwardly nodded, she pursued her lips a bit and gestured for them to follow her.
Harry unintentionally thought back to a few weeks ago when he and none other than Draco Malfoy had a one night stand. They were both a bit drunk, Draco more so than Harry, and were not quite thinking straight. And on top of that, the two were still grieving heavily only a year after the war. He figured it didn't mean anything, but couldn't stop thinking about the way Draco had fucked him roughly from behind, driving into him so deeply that he could've sworn he'd pass out. His rhythmic thrusts had rendered Harry a quivering, whining, sweaty mess. But, with a pang of disappointment, he remembered it didn't mean anything. He quickly shook his head, as if to clear the thoughts from his mind, or at least push them to the very back.
Spluttering, Harry narrowed his eyes. "Charity case?" He repeated astoundedly. "Really? Our flat has an extra room. I'm just offering up the extra space." He said the words with forced calmness, punctuating each with nearly undetectable anger. He was trying his best to be civil, but his patience was waning.
"Yes. Pregnant. You want to know how? Okay. Sure." Harry cut him off, looking down at the cup of tea in his hands. Malfoy glared at him and Harry glared right back. "Apparently it's very rare. Only happens when one or both parents are strong and share a type of…" His breath caught in his throat at the next word he would have said. "Nevermind that last." There was a pause as Harry decided what to say next. "The Healers advised me to be exposed to your magic for my pregnancy to remain strong, especially in the later months. As much as I hate to say it, they're probably right." He lifted his gaze, their eyes meeting for only a moment before Malfoy glanced behind him, likely just to break eye contact.
When the blond reached the bathroom, he found Harry slumped against the toilet, one hand holding his dark hair back out of his face and the other steadying him. Sharp green eyes soon found Draco's. "See what you've done?" Harry grumbled, but it sounded more playful than anything.
Harry flinched at the tone of his voice. He leaned back slightly. "Okay. Don't talk about it, then." He said, a hint of annoyance evident in his tone.
Harry once again took a deep breath, trying to tell himself that it would be okay. That Hermione would not be angry with him. But, irrational thoughts crept their way into his mind, corrupting any positive outcome that could happen. Harry is stubborn, however, and he shook his head to clear them from his head, taking another few deep breaths. Hermione was staring at him with concern written on her face.
Harry sighed; none of his memories seemed to be happy anymore, not even those with Ginny. They had split up not long after the Battle of Hogwarts, due to the fact that neither of them seemed to have much chemistry with each other anymore.
"It's Malfoy." He declared with as much confidence as he could manage, which wasn't much. "Draco Malfoy."
When he finally did, his face looked quite confused and almost joyful, Harry thought. Perhaps that meant nothing was out of order.
"Um," said Harry. He looked at Draco for a split second, then seemed to have made a decision. "I would like to wait." He gulped, nodding and wiping his hands on his thighs.
Seeing that it was Monday, Draco noted that he had around four and a half days to get everything packed and work out any other details of leaving this horrid complex. He sent Hedwig back with nothing, not thinking there was a point in wasting parchment just to reply 'Okay.'
"It means you're still in love with me, you idiot." Draco rolled his eyes. "And…" There it was again, the swarm of bees. "Maybe I am too." He finally choked out, covering his face as if it'd save him from the rejection he expected.
Harry took the Floo home and prepared for the disaster that would be telling his friends and family.
Harry entered the pristine room of the Prefect's bathroom. He gazed at the swimming pool sized depression in the floor for a moment. It would make a perfect place to let himself think once filled up, and that was exactly what Harry planned to do. The ebony haired male turned on the water, and in response the many taps began expelling water and different colors of soap. He smiled at this familiar view; it reminded him of his fourth year, in which he used this same bath to solve one of the challenges in the Triwizard Tournament. He then quickly tried to clear his mind of that memory. The last tournament had turned sour; The other Hogwarts Triwizard Champion, Cedric Diggory, was murdered by Peter Pettigrew that year.
Malfoy outwardly didn't look the least bit intimidated, but the widening of his eyes and tightening of his hands on the table said otherwise. If he gripped the table any tighter, Harry was sure his knuckles would pop loose. "Potter, I-" He cut off, seemingly having a debate inwardly with himself for a bit. "I'm not going to be your next charity case," He spat venomously. The blond looked like he was debating leaving.
Upon walking inside, Draco sneered a little at the baby blue walls with owls carrying babies in cloths painted on. He'd heard that owls delivering human babies was a play on the fact that muggles sometimes told children that storks delivered babies, but it was just so ridiculous that anyone could believe that.
Malfoy looked as if he would explode from the sheer amount of information he was being told. "There is no way the child is mine." He seemed to be trying to make himself believe that it wasn't. "I'm not- I'm not a strong wizard! Hell, I don't even have a wand right now!" He now had both hands in his hair, running them harshly through the neat, soft platinum blond strands.
Harry gasped when he put the pieces together and realized; that's his child. It didn't look like much more than a small blob, but the fact that it was a living human being growing inside him made him choke up. Impulsively, he reached out to clasp whatever was closest to his right hand, and that happened to be Draco's hand. Harry held on for a few seconds, although it felt like hours, before he realized what he was grasping, made a strangled sound and let go.
"Oh...I, erm…" Here it comes, Draco thought. "It isn't wrong." He said in the smallest voice Draco had ever heard, so meek and quiet that he could barely hear it.
"I want to be with you again." Draco said bluntly, although his voice was laced with emotion. "I'm...I'm not complete without you. You're like my other half. I don't know how I lasted two years without you." His voice was slowly trailing off, slowly becoming more unstable and more crackly. "I did some horrible things in the war, I know I did, and I hope you can forgive me. I couldn't have changed my side. He would have killed my family."
"They expanded it not long ago, you know. There's a lot more permanent patients after the war." She frowned, her tone souring a bit.
Scoffing at his now dissipating panic, Draco dropped the letter once he'd read it over around three times. He searched around for a piece of parchment and a quill (he hadn't written a letter in quite some time), but was interrupted by an impatient hoot from Hedwig. He stared at the white owl for a moment before realizing she wanted a treat. "Can you not wait one second, you silly owl? Let me find some parchment to send a letter back and then I'll find something to give you."
Something about living in the same place as two thirds of the Golden Trio felt wrong to Draco, even though he'd been living with them for two weeks now. Maybe it's something in the way they make an effort to invite him to have breakfast with them before he heads off to work, or something with how they try to include him in whatever things they do as friends. It feels wrong to him. Malfoys don't make friends for the sole purpose of companionship. And anyway, he hadn't had a friend in ages. Not since Hogwarts. Not since the Fiendfire.
Harry and Draco meet at a cafe.
"This one dampens the nausea, this one eases muscle pain and cramps," Healer Denbright held out each of the different colored potions as he named them. "This one deals with mood swings, and lastly, this one suppresses any odd food cravings. The last one isn't mandatory of course."
And there it was; Harry bowed his head and promptly vomited on the floor. This was way too much to take in, especially only one year after the War. Healer Denbright spelled away the vomit once Harry was done and patted him on the shoulder. "Ehm, there is a bundle of potions often used in pregnancies. Helps with cramps, pain, nausea, and other pregnancy symptoms. I assume you'd like some?" When Harry nodded vigorously, Healer Denbright left the room and returned five minutes later with four potions in his arms.
Harry laughed a bit and nodded, "I will. It'll be fine. He's not evil enough to hurt a pregnant person." He frowned a bit, wondering if that was entirely accurate. But, after a moment, he cleared his head. Malfoy wasn't like his father, not entirely at least.
"Well, at least he said yes," Hermione sighed. "I'll go clean up the guest room. You go ahead and figure out a time we can both meet with him." She told him, sounding motherly, almost like Molly. Harry smiled amusedly and nodded.
"Good thing I'm not too far along," Harry said, and it sounded as if the phrase felt very foriegn and did to him. "Muggles might question it."
i did a lot of pregnancy research for this and now that's what my history is full of
"Thanks, 'Mione. You're the best!" He called as she exited the room.
There was a loud rapping at the window, followed by a screech of an owl. Draco grumbled, sitting up in his creaky bed to stare at the small window in his apartment. With a jolt of pure panic, he recognized the snowy owl as Hedwig. Had something happened to Potter? He didn't know, but immediately got to his feet and rushed over to wrench open the window. Hedwig hopped on to the small desk that sat beside the window with a quiet hoot. She held out her leg, which a letter was tied to. Draco gently untied it and began to read, almost so fast that he skimmed over the whole letter, even though it was very short.
Harry gritted his teeth out of anxiety, staring anywhere but Draco. He could tell that his ex-lover had more to say, so he nodded in an invitation to continue.
About an hour and a half later, a knock sounded at Draco's bedroom door. He set down his book. "Yes?"
Malfoy raised an almost invisible eyebrow, seemingly intrigued. He cleared his throat. "And what might that be?" Contrary to Harry, his voice was smooth and almost silky, like a decadent mousse. Harry could see right through it, in the way that his hands were a bit shaky and his cloudy gray-blue eyes unfocused; darting around the room as if searching for an escape, anywhere to leave his current situation.
Taking a deep, shaky breath, Harry hugged her back. He hesitated a moment, debating on whether he actually wanted to tell Hermione. "'Mione...there's a lot to explain." She raised her eyebrow at that. "Sit down, I guess. B-But, promise me you won't be angry."
Five minutes later, all three were just about ready to leave. Hermione and Harry stood by the door idly chatting, while Draco slipped on his shoes, quite distant from the others. He finished, and then they stepped outside.
After a long moment of staring in disbelief, Malfoy opened his mouth and closed it a few times. Harry thought he looked like a fish, suppressing the giggle that threatened to escape his throat at that thought. "Pregnant." He finally repeated harshly, spitting the word like it was a curse, although unintentionally. "You're pregnant. How in the bloody fuck-"
Draco rolled his silver-blue eyes. He hesitated at the first button of his shirt, but quickly undressed as to not make Harry uncomfortable. The Slytherin stepped into the water carefully, sitting across the bath from Harry. He sheltered himself with bubbles, pulling them in to cover what he didn't want to be seen.
Harry sat in the waiting room at St. Mungo's. He'd been feeling nauseous and having cramps for the past few weeks, and in true Hermione fashion, the dark-skinned girl forced him to visit the clinic. He didn't suspect it'd be anything serious; just a simple stomach bug or something of the sort.
"I know, Draco, I know." Harry said into Draco's neck, his voice just as emotional as the other's. "You didn't want to. It's okay; it was war, we all did things we regret." His voice had a soothing effect on Draco. He hesitantly pressed a chaste kiss to Draco's lips; a very soft, feathery kiss. Harry cupped the blond's cheek and forced them to be face to face. "I didn't break up with you because I didn't love you anymore." He whispered. "I was scared. Terrified. I didn't want you to get hurt because of me."
Harry hesitated, and then nodded. Healer Vexmoor leaned over his slightly protruding stomach, and began whispering a few unfamiliar spells with her wand pointed at his abdomen. When she was done with that, she spelled off the lights, and a projection appeared on the wall in front of them. It took both Draco and Harry a few moments to register what it was, while Hermione was staring at the wall with both hands clasped over her mouth.
Harry nodded uncomfortably, still fiddling with his hands. "No, I think I'm alright." He said, sounding subdued. "Hermione will probably research for me if I have any." He chuckled a bit.
Harry is told something that will change his life.
"What?!" He exclaimed, brows narrowing. "They took everything? I only...I only thought they took the Manor. Oh, Merlin, that's awful." Harry looked as if he was considering doing something about it, an action he could tell Hermione highly disproved of. He shook his head inwardly; there was no way he could get all riled up and pissed, being two months pregnant. It wasn't good to do so, as Harry was told by the Healers. Would offset his magic if he got too angry. "I was busy cleaning up after the war." He murmured.
Harry and Draco exchange letters over the course of a day.
Draco crossed his arms tighter. This was too tense for him. He didn't like it one bit.  Silence took its place between the two for a moment, and only that. "...You and Ginny still together?" He asked, the corners of his lips pointing downward.
"Now that you are three months along, your baby is about the size of a passion fruit," She smiled at Harry. "We can also hear their heartbeat," She murmured yet another unfamiliar spell, and then a soft thumping sound filled the room that made Harry's own heart race. "Your baby's digestive tract is beginning to be functional and is, quite literally, stretching it's muscles. The bone marrow is also busy making white blood cells. As you near the end of your first trimester, your womb is about the size of a large grapefruit and will begin shifting from the bottom of your pelvis to a 'front-and-center' position in your abdomen. This will likely bring an end to the constant need to urinate, as your womb is no longer pressing against your bladder." Harry flushed at her last sentence, bringing one hand to rest on his stomach.
Now at St. Mungo's, Draco stared out of the window as they pulled in. Something about the hospital looked different from the last time he came, and he couldn't put his finger on what. But, not to worry, as Hermione decided to point it out.
"Potter," Greeted Malfoy neutrally, neither rude nor kind.
Malfoy stared at Harry for a solid thirty seconds, taking in what he'd said, then his lips curled into a less-than amused sneer. "Very funny, Potter." He almost growled, gripping his tea tighter. Typical Malfoy, Harry thought.
Later that night, Draco lied with his head on his flat pillow, unmoving and yet not sleeping. There were too many thoughts running about in his head, mainly about his parents. What would they think when Draco revealed he'd agreed to live with Potter, and worse, gotten him pregnant? There was no way to predict it, so Draco would just have to wait. Panic rose like bile in his throat at the situations that could occur that his mind created, most irrational. He knew that, at the worst, he could be disowned, simply singed off the family tree like Sirius Black or Nymphadora Tonks. Only time would tell.
"So," Harry broke the silence, "Ehm, how've you been?"
For the first time in a long time, the pair was sure they would be alright. With a bit of time and work, they could resolve any remaining issues left between them. All was well, for the time being.
"This is not a joke, Malfoy!" Harry hissed angrily, slamming his hand on the table. "You are not this stupid."
Draco and Hermione both nodded, and then took a seat in the chairs next to the examination chair where Harry began to lie down, Draco closest to it.
"I promise I won't be angry. It would just be nice to know, y'know?" She gave him a small smile, kissing him on the cheek to reassure him.
Suddenly, a creak sounded from across the room. Harry's emerald green eyes traveled up from the water to see Draco standing at the entrance to the room. The gazing eyes of Harry filled with remorse.
"Alright," Healer Denbright said, holding his hand out for a shake which Harry responded to. "I wish you well, Mister Potter. The other Healers and I will set you up with a specialist in male pregnancies who will conduct your regular appointments in the eight months to come." He handed Harry a bag with all of the potions in it. "Have a lovely day."
"I kept it." When Harry looked at him, confused, he plowed on to explain. "The watch. The one that records how long it's been since we fell in love." The blond felt tears welling in his eyes and stubbornly wiped them away. It felt as if a whole swarm of bees were buzzing about in his stomach and chest, stinging his internal organs and causing this near pain.
"I assure you it's nothing life-threatening, no need to worry," Denbright said with a small smile. "You seem to be pregnant." He said, as if it was the most normal thing for a bloke to be pregnant.
By 9 o'clock, Harry was surprisingly just about dressed and ready to go. He still looked tired and messy, of course, but somewhat presentable. He slipped on some comfortable shoes and glanced over at Hermione, who was reading a book, and gave a nervous smile even though she wasn't looking at him. "I'm heading out, 'Mione."
"Oh- Erm, this is Hermione, a great friend of mine, and…" He cut off, looking uncomfortable about introducing Draco, so the blond decided to do it himself.
Healer Denbright sent Harry a small smile. "There are several different ways to go about birth, but you're merely two weeks in, I doubt you need to worry about this so soon." He said. "Other than that, your organs have been shifting to make room for a temporary womb, which will be connected with the anal canal. It is not natural for a man to grow a womb, of course, and as such pain can be expected." The healer explained knowingly. "Which explains the cramps you have been experiencing over the past few weeks. Another important detail is that you are highly recommended to be exposed to the other father's magic quite often. I do not know who he is, and I will not pry, but I do suggest letting him know. Oh! Almost forgot, but it is not recommended to separate during your pregnancy, especially in the later months."
Taking a deep breath, Harry opened his mouth to speak. "What can I do if I'm feeling dizzy to relieve it? I'd rather not faint." He asked.
After a moment of thought, Harry crossed his arms stubbornly. His emerald eyes were dark. "No, probably not. I'd advise at least considering it." Said Harry, in an even tone, one Malfoy couldn't argue with.
They had lasted only two years together, but Harry thought of those two years as the best he'd had in Hogwarts, perhaps even in his life. He couldn't deny he still had feelings for Draco, but he didn't know how to deal with them. They had left off on decent terms when their break-up happened; Harry didn't want Draco to get in trouble for being so close with him. He didn't want to be the reason that Draco possibly lost his family members. Harry now realized that ending the relationship was a mistake, but he couldn't simply go back in time two years to change it and not mess anything up.
Draco hugged his knees close to his chest. "Yes." He replied rather snappishly. This had annoyed him.
Harry gently kissed Draco's head. "I love you," He said in a barely audible whisper, but they were so close that Draco could hear it. "I never stopped."
Hermione gasped and immediately embraced Harry, squeezing him tightly. She let out what Harry could only describe as a strangled sigh. "How come these things always happen to you?" It would have sounded like a joke if it weren't for her tone of voice. "What are...How far along are you?"
Harry pushed himself back to sit on the floor. He stared at Draco for a second, then took a deep breath. "I- We have an appointment today," Harry stared at Draco, as if daring the blond to protest. "You're coming with, whether you like it or not."
Hermione smiled at him, nodding. "Yes, it is. Although there's likely something you can use to hide it later on when you go out."
Harry let out a quiet sigh and nodded. He sat up on the examination table with his hands in his lap, fingers locked together. "That makes sense…" He trailed off for a moment. "What will happen if I don't seek out the other father?" The young man bit his lip, running a hand through his hair.
Healer Vexmoor continued. "Like I said, you are nearing the end of your first trimester and some early pregnancy symptoms will begin to diminish. Such as, nausea, fatigue, tender nipples," Once again, Harry flushed in embarrassment and put an arm over his eyes. "And food aversions. But, unfortunately, some new ones will begin to develop. You may experience dizziness, which is the result of blood flow to the baby increasing and blood flow to yourself decreasing, causing low blood pressure. Another symptom you may experience is low blood sugar levels, so I highly do not recommend that you perform physical activity if you have not eaten."
"Nope." Harry sighed. "Guess her and I weren't meant for eachother. We split up around a week after the Battle. It's not that big of a deal."
