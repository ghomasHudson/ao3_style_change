“Hmm.” It didn’t look quite like Firewhisky either. “Maybe this isn’t mine, then.”
“The bond is made of the elements its bearers bring to it. You have studied the texts for months. Those words are not to be easily dismissed. Ginevra Weasley brings strength, loyalty, devotion, all powerful assets. Draco Malfoy brings all of that, as well as a measure of unpredictability. A steadfast determination and an obsessive drive I have only seen elsewhere in you.” The wizard leaned forward in his chair; his eyes held an age Harry couldn’t guess at. “Ms Weasley will guarantee stability. But it is in instability that I place my hopes, and in the indisputable fact that Voldemort will not see it coming.
Whether Luna confirmed it for them or not, no one offered an argument. Neville went to Morag, who held her arm up for his perusal. “What
All at once, a figure turned the corner. Blaise stopped, his heart slamming up into his throat, but it was too late. The person froze, robes swishing around him. Blaise saw the wand in the man’s right hand, the voluminous black of velvet, and features he knew all too well.
This time Draco rolled his eyes. Harry could still feel the hand on his bicep and wondered if Draco had perhaps forgotten it was there. “Seemed like a good idea at the time, Potter.”
Nothing in Luna’s voice changed; her song still haunted the castle, crystal clear and beautiful. But Draco’s body felt lighter. Just a little.
“Well, I haven’t.” The words clipped sharply across his tongue. He clenched the jar in his hand, then set it back on the shelf with a thunk and made for the door, no longer caring what it looked like. He should have stayed in his room. Should have—
“Petrificus Totalus!”
was all he could think.
He took a deep breath and sat back down in the chair, feeling his heart begin to race.
Harry’d had enough. “You’ll what, Bell? Kill him?”
Harry felt himself redden. Every inch of his newly fledged bond seemed aware of her, the what-might’ve-beens and the chilly, obvious reality. Everything he’d promised her and then snatched away. It didn’t help that he knew it was necessary, the right path. “Ginny—”
One of these rooms, however, did have things in it: folded blankets, chests and tattered furniture lying under the weight of years, potions bottles and cauldrons that had seen much more recent use. He’d been in once the day before, and had let his mind take him back to Snape’s storeroom in Hogwarts’ dungeons. It had the same cramped feel, almost homey with the scent of dried herbs. He wondered who brewed the potions for the inhabitants of this castle, at least the ones Pomfrey did not require for healing. If they even used potions for anything else. In such a protected place, there might not be a need.
That was it: for the first time since she’d met Harry Potter, she didn’t know how it would turn out.
All she could do was nod. The sheer expanse of power Luna must have been wielding hit her like a wall. After only a few seconds, she had to close her eyes and force herself not to think about it.
Blaise stared up at her, unable to breathe, unable to think. Going to kill him she was going to kill him she was going to—
The stack of useless material was growing larger, but the stack of possibilities was still sizable by the time Harry shut the door behind him. He dragged himself to bed feeling more hopeful than he had in a long time.
“Maybe I’m the dam that broke,” Harry said.
“I’m sorry,” Madam Pomfrey said. She had crouched down beside them as well and had Katie’s face in her hands, studying her unseeing eyes. “A Dementor’s Kiss is irreversible. There’s nothing I can do but make her comfortable.”
That damned music wouldn’t stop. It just kept hammering against every surface. He didn’t know he was pleading aloud until Draco shushed him with fingers dragged over his mouth, curling in until the taste of him lapped onto Harry’s tongue. Harry licked at what he couldn’t get his hands on, and Draco gave a pained moan and flattened himself upon Harry.
“Harry—” She took a breath and tried to speak calmly. “Harry will be thankful, too, Malfoy. This spell.” She caught his eye. “It’s difficult. Everything you’ve done, bringing me, risking your life… He’ll be grateful.”
“He fears instability, Harry. He is now made up of instability, and he seeks a path away from it just as obsessively as he seeks a path toward you. You have now deprived him of every other avenue toward his salvation, and he must look to you, the mistake he made so many years ago. You are his last weakness, and he seeks to drive such weakness out of existence. I am giving you his very own weapon to defeat him.”
And Madam Marchbanks. The old woman caught Harry’s eye and gave the slightest of nods. Harry chose one of her questions. “You will provide us with the names of the Death Eaters your age.”
Harry’s horrible, sublime, fantastic bond, already at work in his friend.
*		*		*
The fact that he had nowhere to go wasn’t a deterrent. Harry strode as fast as he could, hearing the echo of his steps under the notes of Luna’s harp. He couldn’t go to her, and he couldn’t go to Hermione or Ginny or the twins, and he most certainly couldn’t go to Draco. He would probably sick up on the floor or something if he had to see the wounds in Draco’s eyes, and he knew they would be there, even if Draco wasn’t blaming him. Harry already blamed himself.
Her expression bent from irritation to something much softer. “Are you all right?”
Remus stopped him with a touch. So Harry explained the bond, the one between Blaise and Seamus at least. It was too disconcerting to think about his own impending experience. He could see the connections forming in Remus’ mind anyway, and hoped he wouldn’t be forced to sort through it all over again.
For the next few minutes, Pomfrey worked, muttering over her wand. She pulled her bag open, removed several small vials, and began mixing different amounts from the contents of each into a larger flask. She had just capped the third vial and was reaching for the fourth when she paused. Her head came up.
“No, we have to get them
It was waking to find the world full of new colours. The grass was still green, the sky patchy and blue, but it was a different green, an unfamiliar shade of blue. Ginny could make little sense of it; even the air seemed to bite, full of impossibility and sheer, ridiculous circumstance.
“I don’t want you to leave this time,” Harry muttered. “Just let me say what it is that—”
Two solid, isolated notes.
As expected, everyone then turned to stare at him. Harry kept his eyes on Hermione, and she cleared her throat, tapping the yellow jar again.
The entrance hall was immaculately clean. There were no blood stains on the stones or cobwebs in the corners. There were no traces of snake skins or bones. There were no tortured screams, no angry voices, no scent of decay. There were no signs of every evil, terrible thing that Draco
"Do it, I

Potter was going to be the end of him. "Not yet," Draco whispered feverishly, breaking eye contact only once to glance briefly at Harry's frantic movement beneath the sheet.
Had the pillow not been thick enough? Had it not muffled his voice enough? If Potter had heard any word of what he had just said, he was fairly certain he was going to die. DIE. As his panic began to build into fear, Potter scrunched his nose, shook his head, and cleared his throat. “Er…sorry Malfoy, what was that?”
Potter said something about future Dark Lords needing to be brought to justice and young people having the ability to defend themselves or something equally predictable. Draco’s mind drifted to the time he spent in Snape’s Potions class and how much he missed his godfather.
Classes must have ended, since students began scurrying all over the place. How young and optimistic they all were. How completely unaware of what they would soon have to face. How many of these industrious students would never have the opportunity to graduate? How many would be dead within five years?
“What? For what?”
Albus opened it again. Draco flicked water from his hands and reached for a towel. Draco craned his head out of the room, looking into the hallway of the Slytherin male dormitories. His heart warmed a little at the sight. How he missed it.
Harry watched her, an odd expression on his face. She heard Moody clunk up behind.
“No, get her out, treat her in Hogsmeade.” Ron reached for Blaise’s arm.
But she could see.
Hermione smiled at him gratefully before turning back to Harry. “If you have any idea where Zabini is, then maybe—”
“I…” Harry felt his face heating again, and it wasn’t just from embarrassment. Far too many things in his head—He gripped the back of the chair behind him and fought not to sink down into it again. Already bonding? And with Draco, no less. It didn’t surprise him as much as it should have, and yet it completely flummoxed him with its sheer existence. The fact that he hadn’t physically noticed such a thread being forged was frightening. He could very well have bumbled headlong into it as Seamus and Blaise had done.
Well, why not? He’d already facilitated the death of the only girl left in his life after Hogwarts. He might as well help Ginny Weasley along, too, in his bitter, well-meaning fashion.
Potions—incendiary, explosive, blinding—in bottles made of such thin glass that they cast rainbows on the earth, lifted with a fusion of summoning and levitation. The wand was whirled overhead, so fast the bottle became a mere blur. Just when the speed was greatest, the spells were released and the projectile flew.
“Alright.” He gestured, clenching his teeth to keep back the heat.
him,” Pomfrey snapped. “He should not be so unstable.”
“Explain for me, Hermione,” Harry grated out. His head began to ache.
He hadn’t given himself the time while they were running, but now the fear would not be driven away. The girl, the Death Eater… Had Ginny been a lucky guess on her part? Or had she known beyond a doubt that he was guiding Ginny Weasley and not one of the others? A spy in their ranks was unlikely. There just weren’t enough people who knew, and the ones who did were out of reach or beyond a shadow of a doubt. And Draco was not going to start second-guessing the only people he had left, not until there was something more concrete to go on than a lucky guess by a child Death Eater.
The screams began anew.
“Then we have to hope she arrives soon,” Pomfrey said curtly, leaning back and scowling at the table. “Meanwhile, I’ll do what I can for them. It’s very possible that as Seamus strengthens, Blaise will as well.”
The Dales. She’d made it to the Dales after all, and that… that was Bolton Castle. Wasn’t it? Hermione squinted. The silhouette was unmistakable. Whatever windows might have beamed light were dark and abandoned. Perhaps boarded up. Bolton held magical signature, but it was unrefined, and there might not be anyone left in these valleys to seek sanctuary within its walls anyway.
This time, she recognised the flicker of disdain when he looked at her. It must be bred in a Malfoy from birth; their faces probably just twisted like that without their control, as natural as smiling.
Ginny flinched. It wasn’t him. She’d seen the real him for an instant and then he’d
“And how will you know when we’re there?” she asked, aimless annoyance making her words tart.
Hermione bit her tongue and forced herself to stop moving, and all the while the gentle flow drifted through her like a liquid. She set her jaw and looked at Harry again. “You said we’re calling them all in. Everyone who can make it. We can’t leave Seamus out there.”
“What, Ronald?” She tried a smirk at the baleful look on his face but only managed what she was sure was a silly grin. She shoved him in the arm and promptly fell over him. “Ronald. Ronald, Ronald, Ronald.”
“No,” Draco muttered, too quickly. Harry’s eyes narrowed. Ginny knew the cut on Draco’s head was very visible.
“Can you feel him, or something similar? See him?”
She nodded and perused his face carefully. “And how are you feeling?”
For a moment it did feel like the Headmaster’s office in Hogwarts, cramped with comfort, cluttered with the odds and knobs of indeterminate age and wisdom. It had been Dumbledore’s office, more so than McGonagall’s, and more than any of the headmasters and mistresses before him, Harry was willing to wager. Something in the stones of Hogwarts itself, something not present here, spoke of Dumbledore’s name, of his essence breathed into the life force of the school. Hogwarts
“Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun,
A trickle of warmth broke through her melancholy. Harry appeared in her mind, not as a face, but as a voice. A scent. The cologne he’d used in his sixth year… deep, intoxicating laughter that made her shiver even now. It had been much too long since she’d last seen him; the circumstances had not been that good—were they ever?—and she’d left the encounter happy, but deprived of something she couldn’t put her finger on. Now she realised that, no matter how many resolutions she’d made for a friendship between them, she would never be able to keep them. She already wanted more. What they’d had, or as close to it as they could get. He was miles away and she could already feel him tingling in her blood. She tightened her grip on her cloak. When had she become so focussed on this? She had no idea, and yet it was there all the same.
Ginny lurched up from the rock, barely subduing the scowl that threatened, and yanked her pack over her shoulder. Draco had stilled. She could feel him watching her. But she couldn’t look back. She was afraid of what she might see.
He could also hear Ginny breathing beside him. She had gone pale; her lips were beginning to tremble. Draco sought inside himself, hoping that maybe… but the emptiness was still there. Lovegood had not filled it; she’d merely cloaked it, and there in the dim front hall, Draco had to deal with the pain of its presence once again.
Ron nodded, squeezed her hand, and headed back up the stairs at a lope. Hermione went blindly through the Common Room to the girls’ stairwell. God, where was Harry? Were they all downstairs already, fighting? Had—had everyone been caught by surprise or had there been some sort of warning? She had no idea what she was doing, what was happening or how she was going to get fifteen or more children down through the castle and out. She didn’t even know where the fighting was concentrated, which routes might be safe.
Draco thought, and then felt sick. He’d never, ever thought Theodore pathetic. But he knew he himself was.
Hermione’s finest. Double the strength.
“Work,” Hermione sighed. She hadn’t lifted her head.
“I don’t
There had been no possible way to explain in the moldering study in Lupin’s now-abandoned home a year and a half ago. They’d all been there. Draco Malfoy had watched with eyes shadowed equally by lingering illness and anxiety as Harry, Marchbanks, and McGonagall sized up his three closest friends. First together, then separately, and then with Veritaserum. Pansy Parkinson had carried herself calmly that night, chin lifted, and told them nightmarish details of her family, hunted into poverty and terror by the Dark Lord. Blaise Zabini’s hatred for Voldemort had been solid enough to see. The betrayal and torture of his parents as blood traitors had reminded Harry forcibly of Neville.
as if he were a mere centimeter from being inside Draco’s mind instead.
be his relationship. “What in Salazar’s name is going on?”
There were so many. Surely he hadn’t been that careless, not to sense them approaching. How long had they been shadowing the two of them? Days? Hours? The thought of them watching through the trees as he and Weasley slept, ate, argued—just
“As the swans in the evening moved over the lake…”
them, pricking with their magic. A steady burn under his Mark. Close. How close, he had no way of knowing short of using his own wand, and that would be suicide. But the vibration was getting stronger.
“But you just said—”
“Are you…” There was no good way to say it. “Are you tied together completely?”
Ginny’s eyes widened, but this time Harry was first to the draw. “He’s taken a bad turn,” he said weakly.
When it was done and only then, it felt like the last thing left between him and oblivion.
“Not a fucking charity case,” Draco muttered, shoving Harry back fully. The loss of contact was prevalent in every breath. He felt dirty, still needing, wanting the wrong person instead of accepting what he’d been given, wanting it so much that he was willing to throw aside his own dignity just to get one more touch, one more kiss, fuck, thought,
his mind attempted. But Draco couldn’t summon the anger. Only pungent relief. He pushed aside a low-hanging branch, wincing at the snapping as twigs broke and rained down onto the forest floor. He eased past, then held it out of the way for Ginny.
“Hiding from… from Voldemort.”
“Malfoy.” Surprise there, but a weary sort, as though Harry couldn’t be bothered to be surprised anymore. Draco heard his own name as if he weren’t the one being addressed. It took several seconds to unfreeze his tongue, his limbs.
In the shadows on the upper tier, Ron shifted fitfully. Harry made a decision. “Malfoy.”
“It’s on your head, then, Potter.” Moody’s eye rolled back as if trying to locate something inside his own skull. “We could always send Wood out after him.”
“If anyone can find him, it’ll be Seamus,” Ginny said stiffly. Hermione looked sharply at her friend, as sharply as her aching head would allow. Beside her, Madam Pomfrey clucked warningly.
“He wasn’t expecting us.” Krum looked satisfied, and proud. “He thought he’d done all that was necessary to subdue my country.”
Do you understand me? I’m not in love with her, and I won’t allow her to be the one to take this on.”
Draco lifted his chin hesitantly and tried to speak, his voice cracking with the strain. Ginny was yards away, moving as silently as moth’s wings. Now he could see what she carried: a solid, twisted tree branch as long as her arm and twice as thick. He fixed his eyes on the Death Eater, but could still see Ginny’s piercing blue in his mind.
He’d lost them all by trying to save them when he was not fit to save anyone. Pansy and his mother, his father, Theodore... All the rest.
And there were other things to catch her attention. It made her morose, really, studying people through the halo-haze of alcohol. Harry’s laughter over by the fireplace was not enough to pull her out of it, though he did sound happier than he had in some time, and she took satisfaction from the idea that he’d obviously had much more to drink than she.
“And if not Abbott?”
“Ron, what time is it?” she whispered. He took an unsteady step away from the bed, shaking his head once. His fingers brushed over the nightstand and retrieved his wand.
The sky had lightened again to a smoky indigo by the time she and Malfoy reached another sizable outcropping of rock. This one was not natural, though: scorches laced the ashy granite, and the earth had been heaved about the base. The lunging stones seemed to topple over each other, casting shadows across the open ground, and it was in one of these shadows that Malfoy halted.
Potter’s hands were already at his collar, working the clasp of his cloak free and shoving it off his shoulders. Potter eased Draco’s shirt from his waist band, then hissed. Draco looked down and saw dark red soaking through the filthy fabric. Potter rolled the shirt up and away, then fumbled for his wand and cast a series of clotting spells over the area. Pain bit afresh and Draco let a grunt slip past his lips. Potter frowned. Flicked his wand again. A tendril of numbness slithered down Draco’s side like cool water and began to expand.
Luna shivered. Harry stood and stepped closer. Luna’s face was suddenly a wan echo of what it had been under the spell’s influence. The shadows beneath her eyes had swept over her at last, and she looked gaunt in the rose light. She smiled weakly up at him. But her irises were clouding, Harry could see it already.
Everyone was looking at her. Hermione felt her face heat and focussed on Harry. Yes, Harry, he would… “You should have seen him, Harry. He was completely terrified. Something was wrong, he said, with Blaise, and he—He was leaping right out of his skin.”
“The diary was destroyed during Second Year. Dumbledore took care of the ring, and Blaise… killed Nagini. Flitwick died destroying the cup.”
The look she turned on him was almost bitter. He could see she was holding back words, probably worth hearing at any other time, but today he didn’t care. Weasley slid to the ground, hesitated for one weighted moment, and then decisively turned her back on him, tucking her knees up. Draco watched until her breathing evened, but it took many more minutes before he was sure she was asleep.
She was so long. She could easily have stretched halfway to him, nose to tail. Her middle was thick and powerful, clenching muscles, squeezing muscles. Blaise swallowed and tightened his grip on his wand.
“What?” he snapped. “What else? You mean, was it like with Seamus, don’t you?”
Harry’s throat closed up. Seamus’ eyes darted, glistening. He looked so frightened. “He is my bloody life, Harry!”
Harry looked away, a knee-jerk reaction, and felt ashamed. He couldn’t even face Seamus, he had no right to be out here, no right to be asking after Blaise when he damn well knew what had conspired to put them all in this position—
Oliver’s eyes closed. “Yes. I know.”
He gave a nod and turned for the door, looking wearier than ever. Harry lunged forward and grabbed his left arm. Malfoy hissed and froze. Pain spasmed over his face. He jerked away.

It sliced a swath across his back, spinning him round and slamming him into the church wall. Draco cried out, scrabbling behind him. He could already feel the wetness seeping through his shirt. His blood began a slow, ominous thud in his ears, but through it he could hear footsteps. Several people approaching from farther off, but one person coming down the rubbly road toward him. Draco crawled around the corner of the church. A rumbling
Oh. Of all people, Harry Potter in the middle of the hallway blocking his path. Draco wanted nothing but sleep, deep and blank, where there was no room for regrets. Frustration eddied: it seemed even that would be denied him tonight.
He handed her the canteen.
He found her forearm before he even registered what he’d seen. The flicker of dark cloth… maybe. “Close.”
“Have you ever been in league with any Death Eaters?”
“Can we do anything?” Ginny broke in. “Or Luna, perhaps she can—”
Draco straightened to his full height. “Tell me.”
It invaded. It soldered iron links around them. Blaise cursed it in a shaking voice and denied it in the same.
“Then maybe they did know,” Ginny murmured. Her blue eyes were troubled. They darted across the room, fixing briefly on the person standing there. Hermione looked too and saw Draco Malfoy shift his weight fitfully. She glanced at Harry and noticed a resigned twist to his lips.
Draco turned his eyes to the patch of light coming through the entrance. Outside, it began to rain.
Malfoy managed a sneer. “I’ve no reason to distrust her, Weasley.” He spread his hands. Ginny was vaguely surprised to see calluses on his palms. “Why in Merlin’s name would she let me stay outside and rot? I’ll have brought you to them, won’t I?”
And—a last nail pounding in—there were things Harry felt for Draco that he did not feel for Ginny. There were things he—he
When he felt he could stand to be still again, he looked in on Luna’s room. The air was close and stuffy, the bed lit in gold by the fire on the hearth. Luna’s features were as still as death, her breathing as steady as a clock. She lay as though she’d dropped straight into the mattress and sunk there, grasped tight by the blankets.
He sounded so sure. Hermione’s heart jagged in her chest and, for a moment she couldn’t do anything about the emotion welling up inside. She reached, took his hand in hers, squeezed and let it drop.
He stretched out on his back in the grass. To his right, broken stone monoliths rose against the hills like voids, the ghost of a great castle where weeds already grew and magic still trickled. Even the wreck felt familiar. He’d expected it to be painful, treading the paths he’d walked before, when the stones were still whole under his feet and cheerful voices echoed down cavernous hallways.
Harry looked down, resigning himself to the years he would see in Malfoy’s eyes.
The boy seemed oblivious to the noise around him. Liquid brown irises stared at Draco. Draco shuddered violently. Innocence was being wrenched from this boy, right before his eyes.
“Blaise, get out of here.”
“We can’t tell anyone,” Hermione said dully. “They can’t know we’re counting on your death.”
She nodded, barely feeling the ache in her temples anymore. “Fine. It’s fine.”
Draco stirred. “He’s dead.”
“Yes, I know what I just said.
Now people were dashing out of buildings, throwing open windows and calling down to those below, questions which went unnswered. The tide of screams rose in Draco’s ears. Another building toppled, but a well-cast charm tossed the falling masonry safely aside. Draco saw Shacklebolt, wand upraised, horrified dismay across his features. He gestured frantically at the Muggles, but the whine of another incoming spell drowned out whatever he shouted.
Ginny scowled, angry all over again. The world had changed, hardened. There was no room for sympathy for Draco Malfoy, and even if she wanted there to be, logic overwhelmed everything. So what if she had loved Harry for years, seen him return her affections eagerly, and gotten to know him better than Malfoy? It all paled in the face of physicality: she, Ginny Weasley, was a girl, and Malfoy was a boy.
“Come on.” Harry laid his hands back on Draco’s skin. “Come on, you have to let it pass through before it’ll feel better.”
Fifth through seventh years. Their numbers seemed so small. Hermione pulled herself together. “Right. The castle is under attack.”
And here he’d been, expecting it to mean something to Draco. Salazar take him, he
And now here he was on the ground floor, trying to break through solid oak with nothing but his hands and listening to the sickeningly sweet music of the very person who was keeping him from his goal.
Millicent Bulstrode’s eyes went wide. Her wand dropped an inch. “Blaise?” she whispered.
He didn’t want to cry again; it hurt, it fucking burned holes through him and he was afraid he didn’t have enough solid body left to hold together anymore.
Only Harry Potter knew where he was. And Pansy. But Pansy was dead. Blaise hadn’t even been there to see it. His friend had been inside the walls of the fortress below him, underground in the dank and mould, passing through corridors that seeped the waters of the Ness, and finding her way back to the light again and again to tell them all what she knew. It was thanks to Pansy’s efforts that Blaise had the layout of the fortress memorised, a cold and empty tableau in his mind.
He couldn’t think for a long moment. “What are you saying? What do you mean?”
The offering was full of pain, and that was what made it so hard to hear. Remus wasn’t used to it; he was saying that nobody could ever be used to it. The spark of Harry’s ire exploded.
Draco knelt on the bed, one knee after the other. He cupped the back of Harry’s neck. Tightened his fingers and pulled him forward, touched his lips to the corner of Harry’s mouth. It welled up so suddenly that Harry was reduced to gasping, tears clouding his eyes. He couldn’t
Harry smiled. “She enjoys the company.”
Or maybe it was to know that he, Harry, was not alone.
“Expelliarmus!”
He leaned on her suddenly and she fell on her back with the heat of his body pressed against her chest. With a flurry of grunting and cursing, Ron got his shirt half off, then gave up and gathered her to him. Hermione sank down with his mouth over hers, drifting into a haze of plush pillows and freckles. One of his hands stroked her face and throat; the other slid down her leg and up it again, climbing under the loose skirt. His palm was wide on her thigh and it felt so much like it belonged there. He paused at the juncture of her hip and leg and squeezed the sensitive skin there. She pressed up against him, shivering, finding his tongue with hers and just… kissing him.
Harry caught Remus’ eye and got a comforting smile for his trouble. “Remus, what are the actual armaments looking like?”
Draco swallowed hard. Harry had gone pale just behind his old roommate, and the man whose shoulder Draco now clutched stared back at him wordlessly, his blue eyes wide in surprise. His body shuddered visibly with each breath.
It had no place in this war and he was past wishing for the world to revolve around him and his needs.
“—know, Luna, I can feel it. Can you contain it?”
Gabrielle sobbed. Or laughed. Harry wasn’t sure at all. He watched, still stunned by the flurry of movement, as Fleur rocked her sister in her arms and laughed and cried.
“Here it is.” Harry extricated the flute from his pocket and held it up for Luna to see. Her eyes widened. She leaned forward, strumming, and her hair cascaded over her lap.
“Why would I repeat something so obvious?” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
Draco exhaled. “Gone. For hours.”
“We felt them coming,” she said stubbornly. “You always do, but this time they were so, so quick—We ran, right into the Death Eaters, and Alain shoved us back, and so we ran again, and—”
There was no buffer left. Harry knew it was foolish, to think that something as transitory as grief would stand in the way of war and the people on the other side of the line. But he couldn’t help it. Blaise’s sickness, his suffering and the interminable search to cure him, keep him alive—It had all felt like some kind of wall, and now it was down. Now there was nothing in between Harry and his approaching death.
“Harry.”
She pointed upward with one finger and turned to him with another vague smile.
Anyone know how to reach lillithium? ^_^
Blaise opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again. “Are they?”
She leveled the wand at the church.
“I didn’t love Theodore enough.”
so heedlessly, without thought to the after-effects, as though he were still a child.
“Good morning, Harry.” The wizard’s eyes twinkled. “I see you have not thought to take advantage of the early hours, and have instead come to likewise roust me from my morning doze.”
Harry slammed his hand flat on the glass cabinet just outside the doorway.
Lucius Malfoy’s cell stood in the middle of a long passageway, its bars rusted and heavy with moss. Dean had asked no questions, only slithered forward on the floor and shot a stunning spell through the bars to encompass anything lying within. It was the work of a moment to break the steel and slip inside. Lucius lay face up on the ground, covered in the remnants of gold-embossed velvet. He stared dully at the ceiling, but it wasn’t until Harry came forward and snatched up his wrist that he knew.
What if… Ginny stumbled slightly. What if she was wrong in thinking that those three years had been the same blank slate for Harry as they’d been for her? The war had swung up and grabbed hold too tightly for Ginny to even consider another emotional entanglement. But there had been opportunities, that she could not deny. Only the thought that Harry might be waiting for her had kept her out of Dean’s bed a year ago, and she’d heard through the walls and tent canvas the trysts that would never be repeated, but were necessary for comfort’s sake. People came together, people split apart again. The relief of stress was so very important to avoid insanity. She’d simply found other ways to go about it.
“Has Dumbledore been in to see you?”
It felt so good to be held by her brother again. She clung to him wordlessly, letting all the aches and pains drip out of her. He’d changed: his shoulders were thin and much tenser than she remembered, and she could feel his ribs as she hugged him.

When Friday night arrived, Draco could hardly wait to begin. He was a little nervous, but mostly filled with excitement. Experimenting on himself was reckless and certainly not ideal, but it meant that he would know the effects of all potions within a couple of months. Rats could easily take years.
? He was faced with two members of the Ministry--one of whom even remembered his father--and there was no talk of Dark Lords or Death Eaters or Dark Marks or past mistakes. There was no judgment, no suspicious glares. Had enough time finally passed? Had he finally rebuilt the Malfoy name? He must have, because he was being praised for his merits and research, rather than being judged for his past. He was being
“Words are a good start.”
And this? He and Harry had never been
“Then I suppose I should get dressed,” Draco yawned and stretched his arms high above his head.
Draco wanted to stay and observe this Death Eater's actions, but he didn't want to arouse more suspicion. He would come back to stop this Death Eater, but he couldn't do it
but Draco still wanted to find
Draco couldn’t respond.
“Mr. Potter!” Draco called, pushing his way between the Death Eaters and walking up to James. “It would seem I finally get to watch you die.”
Harry rolled off of Draco and onto his side, propping his head up on his elbow. He made no attempt to untangle their legs or scoot away as he reached for his glasses and pushed them back onto his nose. Conveniently, he maneuvered his scarlet robe over Draco’s very obvious erection in his very tight, now black breeches. They both smiled at the approaching crowd, making their best attempts to appear as heroic and innocent as anyone could possibly look while flushed and tangled up with another person.
Weasley was looking very confused and still far more naked than Draco ever wanted to see any Weasley

and I didn't even..." Draco huffed. "Well what about last night, mm? You were pretty pervy yourself.”
.” Oh no. He was Professor Malfoy again. “When I asked you to find a volunteer, I most certainly did not mean a house elf. You need a fellow faculty member--not a house elf or even a student--you need someone who is competent enough to deal with the unexpected and has at least some basic knowledge of potions or healing spells.”
Where was Potter?
“I heard your last potion went...er...
The only person who should be in Harry’s embrace was
That left the Death Eaters he had supposedly sent after the Minister, and the two still in the ballroom--one of whom was theoretically already incapacitated from his ancient paralyzing spell.
He looked at the clock. It was already half past ten. Clearly the house elf was not coming back. He stood and walked toward his wardrobe to change out of his clothes and into pyjamas. And then the strangest thing happened. When he opened the door to his wardrobe, he was blinking not into his wardrobe but into Harry Potter’s bedroom. Where Harry Potter stood not ten feet in front of him, wearing starched black trousers. Wearing only his trousers.
“Devouring us,” he forced out between the incredible waves of sorrow. “All of us.” He wanted to throw himself from the window, pull the catch free and topple out onto the roof, slide off the edge and plummet as far and as fast as he could. He’d never get to the earth swiftly enough to end this incredible
out after Granger here, and look what’s happened. You want to send Potter?”
Draco shrugged him off, suddenly furious again, and pushed past him toward the door. “For fuck’s sake, Potter—”
Perhaps Draco knew already. Perhaps he’d gathered the things he wanted and crept out through the door when the wards shifted.
Ginny forced herself to release George’s hand, thankful for the solitude of the Infirmary and the fact that Fred was asleep. There had been no salvaging of her mood after the meeting on the stairs; she’d only been able to think of coming here, of being with her blood again, her family. What she had left of it.
“The only way I can see it working is if we craft the protection spell so that it tailors itself to Draco’s magic. Uniquely.” And she stopped. Stared at them.

“Harry! Harry, get him into a bed. And for Merlin’s sake, find out what’s wrong with him.”
He frowned suddenly and straightened. It had been stronger than usual. He’d not paid attention at the time; George had been thrashing, and hotter than fire. His body was not moderating itself at all anymore and his temperature spiked and fell without warning. Harry hadn’t been able to think about anything else. Now he rose and looked toward the closed Infirmary door, wondering.
Harry stared at him still, body vibrating. Torn, by whatever Lovegood had just… said? Draco hadn’t heard a thing, but obviously Harry had. Draco rubbed his forehead with both hands and the sick feeling grew. He couldn’t look at Harry.
Dumbledore looked at him peculiarly. “I am not entirely certain, Harry. One’s attention is taken up by so many other things.”

He got three steps back toward the door when Luna spoke.
Draco shook his head without lifting it.
In the corner chair, Draco hadn’t moved at all. His face was stone, but his eyes glimmered. He stared at nothing, and for all the lack of expression, grief sang from his skin. His hands tightened once on the armrests, tiny spasms.
“Yes, but… Harry, I can protect you. I can give you this spell and I can strengthen it, using your joined magic—” she motioned between the two of them, “—and it’ll repel just about anything. But that’s just the problem. You have to…” Hermione’s mouth pursed as though she were in pain. “You have to be
it. The sensation shot straight into the centre of him and his mind went a little wild with the sensation.
“Shhh.” It stuttered out of Draco. He followed Harry down to the floor, kneeling with his knees bracketing Harry’s, and all Harry could do was get closer, get—he didn’t even know, he just needed…
The name meant nothing to Seamus. He couldn’t think through the pain, the sickening, ever-present razing in his innards. But Pomfrey’s face paled. She held out her hand and Harry passed the new bezoar over. The Healer pried Blaise’s clenched teeth open a second time. She fished the first stone out—it dropped hollowly onto the dirtied bed-sheets, a sickly green where it had once been black—and replaced it with the new one. She then proceeded to ignore everyone. Her wand darted, flickered, cast small green showers in some places and sparked redly in others. At one point she concentrated heavily on Blaise’s chest. Seamus lolled against the bedside.
She moistened her lips. “Harry, are you sure—”
this. If he did, he would crash right into it and there was nowhere private enough to hide what would come pouring out of him. Best to shut it down and see if the light of morning couldn’t sober it out of him.
Harry dropped his eyes to his feet. Bare, but not cold, not even on this stone. “What about him?”
“There are a lot of things I don’t want,” Harry managed. Draco’s hands climbed over his shoulders and clutched there, fingers tightening as he spoke. “This…” He almost shied away from speaking it aloud. “…isn’t one of them.”
“Draco,” was all he could say, a hushed whisper. Draco’s lips parted, Harry kissed him, and his climax flooded over him, pulled him up, down, into brief darkness. He shook, all quaking muscles and unfamiliar limbs, unfamiliar skin. Draco’s body was warm against him, alive. All of it. All of him. Shivering and vulnerable, and
There was no point in arguing; Harry knew his motivations better than anyone. Guilt beat weakly in his chest. And still Dumbledore went on in a fatherly voice, as though explaining a charm to a First Year.
Malfoy’s features twisted into a grimace as he yanked at the knapsack straps. “I’m sorry, too,” he bit out.
She wondered if Malfoy’s features
He could not explain to Pomfrey all that he was feeling. But he tried. Blaise, just on the other side of a wall… A sense of slowly permeating calm… A trickle of warmth in his belly and chest whenever he awoke. Seamus didn’t think she could possibly string it all together. But she touched his hand and nodded in such a way that he thought she understood. The look on her face at such times was beyond relief and yet not quite there, as if she couldn’t bear to feel it yet but couldn’t keep it down completely.
Ron rubbed a hand up her arm.
She couldn’t be sure; it might have been a shadow.
“You didn’t,” Harry mumbled, confused, but Draco just dropped his head so his fringe obscured his face. Harry batted at his lover’s arm, finally getting his fingers to catch hold. “You didn’t hurt me.”
Her thoughts swung back to Blaise, other names and faces she’d tried to put to rest long ago. Yes, Hermione was out there wielding her wand somewhere, drawing Death Eaters toward her like a trail of blood through an ocean full of sharks. As was Hannah. Seamus, though without her wand. Countless other names.
Just for an instant, her face did not change, and Harry wondered how many times he had left to play the trust card.
It was a ways off. They’d have to manage several stretches of corridor and two vast halls full of portraits. The Death Eaters must have got in by the main doors, somehow. No one had thought they’d be brash enough to—
It was useless to say that he didn’t want that either. He was suddenly so tired.
With a straining groan, the oaken doors swung inward under Luna’s will, admitting the cloaked figure of Oliver Wood. Oliver stepped through, pushing back his hood and letting out a loud sigh. He slung a worn pack on the floor and stretched his arms toward the soaring ceiling. “Thank the Founders, it’s about bloody time.”
The idea of not knowing, of spending another hour without any word and only the damnably huge, sullen castle to witness his agony, was impossible. He’d go insane.
Why had she—But there was no time for it. Draco grabbed his pack from the ground, yanking it over his shoulder. Blood was running into his eyes; he swiped it away, felt pain as he glanced over the cut at his temple. Looked for Ginny again and found her staring back, wide-eyed.
And saw a glint of fiery hair beneath the cloak’s cowl.
“The month,” Harry pressed in as flat a tone as he could manage. “What was the month?”
“Remus.” The name burst from Harry in a soft exclamation. Remus Lupin straightened in his chair and gave Harry a tired, warm smile.
Harry blushed. “Luna—”
It was the truth, whatever the consequences of such imprecision might be. Perhaps the Death Eaters knew, through no fault of Malfoy’s. Voldemort’s spies were turning up in the strangest places. Or perhaps they knew and it was Malfoy’s doing after all, albeit unwittingly. Harry straightened. “How did you get close to this house?”
“Hallucinatory spell or no,” he continued, his tone edgier, “is he in trouble?”
“You love him?” she muttered at last. Her voice was dull.
“Draco,” Harry murmured, and Draco shot such utter loathing into him that it was all he could do not to sick up. His insides had dried out. He didn’t think he’d fully understood what was staring him in the face until this moment.
Weasley crossed the room and met Potter in the wide space between the loo and the bar. “Nice shirt, mate,” Weasley said, extending his arm straight as a board and slapping Harry twice on the top of the shoulder.
? Of course,
“Hogsmeade.”
Once inside, a furious young Harry slammed the door behind him, cried out with a loud sob and kicked his bedpost. So kicking bedposts was an old habit, then.
?--and the way Potter’s chest was rising and falling against his own.
“That’s not my point!" Harry threw up his hands, clearly growing exasperated. "Merlin, I don’t know if we should even be
Pale blue light shivered from the end of his wand and slithered into the air like a river. And then it was growing. Widening. Gaining legs. Gaining wings. Draco watched as a small Hebridean Black dragon, roughly five feet high, gracefully flew toward the dementor. The dementor hissed in protest, screaming in shrill whispers. There was a flash of light, and it was gone. The dragon landed on all fours, its wings upright and outstretched, its long neck and even longer tail snaking gracefully behind it. Draco smiled, suddenly wanting to cry as he held out his hand to it. The dragon pressed its nose forward and through his fingers, then turned its head. It brought its face to Harry’s chest, nudged, and then faded away.
It had been fifteen long years since Draco had last seen it. Yet there it was, just the same as he remembered and coming into view: the dark silhouette of Hogwarts, its castle towers stabbing into a red sky. It was a most appropriate colour, seeing as it had been slick with death the last time he had seen it.
“In fact, I think--”

“On whether or not I can find the soap.”
best good-morning kiss of Draco's life. Draco moaned and pressed his growing erection into Harry’s hip as Harry broke the kiss to glance at the clock. “Do you think we have time to…?”
Draco looked up with a start, suddenly aware of how utterly mischievous he probably looked. Harry Potter was leaning casually against the wall behind him next to a torch, looking as pleased with himself as a fucking peacock. His arms were folded across his chest and he had one ankle crossed over the other that held his weight. He was still a disheveled mess. Of course. Of
At first, nothing happened. Then he started to feel very strange, like he was floating. And then the strange shifted into terrible, like he was floating and then falling while being pulled in a million different directions. He dizzily reached toward his desk table to support himself, and Potion 3 wobbled off the corner of his desk and shattered on the floor.
“I’ve never--” Harry murmured as he licked his way toward Draco's other nipple. “Could you--” Harry stammered again and Draco smiled. Finally he
“But what did you
“Exactly. Now you’re hideous and rarely ever smug.” Draco smiled, nipping at Harry’s ear. Harry moaned, and the vibration of it traveled through his back and into Draco’s chest. “You’ve no idea how much I wanted you,” Draco chuckled softly into Harry’s ear. “If only my younger self could see me now.”
How could one person endure so much loss and still remain standing? Still feel
They cast the Patronus simultaneously, and two streams of light shivered from the end of the wand. Harry’s Patronus and Draco’s. ...Except the light wasn’t its usual blue blur; it was gold, and bright, and vivid. Draco felt full and strong, despite the fact that a dark and gruesome hell had opened above their heads. There was magic visibly swirling around their hands, and it should have been impossible. Everything about the two of them should have been impossible, but somehow they had defied the odds.
It wasn’t a very long walk down the hall to Dumbledore’s old office. Snape’s old office. McGonagall’s old office. Granger’s office now. Draco smoothed his robes against his chest one more time before climbing the spiral staircase. Headmasters of the ages watched him guardedly as he climbed the stairs. Several threw insults at him, but he remained silent and on his guard. As he neared the top, he could see the walls decorated with red and gold. He could see a room filled with books and trophies and trinkets. He reached the top of the stairs, where a mewling cat announced his presence. The room was filled with a warm, homelike energy.
“I can take my galleons elsewhere,” Draco snapped.
“Fine,” Draco said grumpily, yanking a pillow off the bed and pulling a spare blanket from a shelf. He threw both on the floor between the bed and the wall, parallel to the bed, and turned out the light.  Draco buried his head in his pillow and huffed.

Draco wanted to smack the boy aside the head for his brainless bravado. Like father, like son.

Harry hummed with pleasure, mindlessly lifting a hand to Draco’s left wrist. His thumb dragged against Draco’s black leather gauntlet. “This must be terribly uncomfortable,” he murmured. Harry tapped it, and water splashed beneath his fingers. “You’ll ruin it.”

He didn't need to wait long.
Granger was only free to help Draco with his potions once per month, but Draco was happy to have any assistance at all. In January they discovered the Fountain of Sleuth (that was Potion Five, which greatly heightened the mystery-solving senses of the consumer). In some ways, the potion was similar to Felix Felicis. It turned out to be quite helpful in discovering a small lead as to why there were dementors on school grounds. Under the potion's effects, Draco felt a sudden need to travel to the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where they had first seen the Dark Mark in the sky. There, hidden under some leaves in the snow, was a small, round object no bigger than a marble. After doing additional research, he and Granger discovered that it was a very rare magical artifact that functioned as a magical holding cell for dementors. Draco could only surmise that it had been dropped by whomever had cast the Dark Mark in the first place. Perhaps they had intended to unleash dementors that same night, and something had gone wrong. Or perhaps dropping the artifact had been an accident. They may have found one answer, but it created a multitude of new, unanswerable questions.
Quickly.
And ran.
“Dad, I don’t want you to--”

again, wasn’t he? Standing so miserably close with his stupid miserable face. Potter’s biceps clenched through his pyjamas beneath Draco’s hands, and Draco tried very hard not to squeeze.
Draco began running his fingers in small circles across Harry’s chest, enjoying his explorations there, the feeling of chest hair, the golden tingling that followed his movements.
“To...waltz?” Draco looked at Potter who, once again, was staring down at his shoes. A strand of dark hair fell over his eyes and Draco was tempted to push it away.
Draco wasn't sure if he'd been in a situation quite like this since the war. Yes, there had been no shortage of threats when exploring ancient magical tombs, but they were always different. They were manageable. They had clear solutions. They were never...
Draco walked into Hogsmeade, not quite sure why he had agreed to this. Oh. To get Harry Potter out of his bedroom last night. Because he wasn’t thinking properly. That’s why. He walked up to the Hog’s Head, still the seediest pub of all time, and stared at the blood oozing from the hog into the surrounding cloth. Of course! Let’s go here. It will be a grand old time. Draco looked down at his outfit. He was wearing a lavender button-up shirt with a pair of tan trousers and his dark green basilisk-skin shoes. His hair was pulled into a knot at the back of his head, although a few wild strands of shorter hair always managed to escape. His old research colleagues had often asked him to join them at a local pub every now and then, but this was the first time Potter had asked him anywhere. It almost felt like a date, and he wanted to look decent.
“Come on,” Weasley said, patting them on the back. “They’re bound to fade out eventually. Hermione’s just taken the kids back to the hotel.”
When Harry stepped into his children's hotel suite, he was quickly bombarded by James, Albus, and Lily. "Dad!" they called.
“I believe we’ve established that I don’t have many friends, Potter. I need
Finally, Harry stepped wearily into the room and shut the door behind him, sighing as he pressed his back to it. He lifted his eyes to Draco. They stared at each other, just breathing. And then they were each closing the gap between them, meeting somewhere in the middle with mouths and teeth, arms coiling around each other's bodies. Harry groaned as Draco turned and slammed him against the wall near the door, sliding his tongue along Harry’s lower lip before pressing it into Harry’s mouth. Harry’s tongue met his, pushing, swirling, as fast and elegant as their waltz had been.
Harry: the Harry who dragged his thumbs across his skin, the Harry who breathed ragged against his mouth, the Harry who stammered like a fool, the Harry who looked at him with concern and affection. The Harry who filled him with golden light.
“Where are you going to sleep? This sofa isn’t fit for man or beast.” Draco leaned forward on the sofa and shrugged out of his suit coat.

“Hey Uncle Ron!” Potter called down to the green. “Can you throw the snitch for us please?”
And he couldn’t exactly say no, because that opened a Pandora’s box of other questions that had the potential to get him sacked immediately. Luckily Potter’s eagerness to hear the sound of his own voice saved the day.
It was just one night.
Draco was still standing by the window, eyebrows furrowed as he watched Harry.
“And remember that whomever you choose as your partner for your first dance is of vital importance. It is a matter of social distinction, and will bring the highest honor to your partner. Someone who catches your fancy in the ministry would be a safe match. Ms. Randhawa would be acceptable, if you’re drawing a complete blank.”

When Draco felt another rush of air, his eyes shot open. The portkey station's waiting room shimmered like the surface of a lake and, even though Draco felt a little out of sorts, he was

Draco tried to keep to himself on the train back to London, but eventually Lily sauntered into his compartment. She sat next to him without saying a word, leaned her head on his arm, and fell asleep. Draco blinked at the wall, quite dumbfounded. Even after all of his attempts to keep them at a distance, Potter's children had wrapped themselves around his heart

? If he could have just—what?”
Similar to the time Draco had extended a hand in Hagrid's old holding pen, Harry just stared at it. Instead of taking Draco's hand, Harry leaned forward and brushed his lips against Draco’s mouth. It was soft, brief, and just as delightfully unexpected as their first kiss had been; in fact, it was even better because this time Draco knew there were no potions were involved. “Take care of yourself, Malfoy.” When he reached the door, Harry audibly opened his mouth as if to say something else, but then stepped into the hall and quietly latched the door behind him.
The internal laugh gave way to a twinge of guilt. Of course he knew that Hogwarts pillows were made of goose down. And of course he knew that there would be a very volatile reaction. But it would take at least

That was a close call. He had
Harry's eyes were wide open, staring down at Draco's stroking hand. When Harry's eyes flicked to Draco's face, there was no longer any denying what they were doing. Merlin, they were staring right at each other. This had gone way too far, but there was hardly any stopping it now. It felt almost surreal. They were both horny and half-asleep and fucking

Fine. If Potter was going to ignore it, then so was he. Draco began to walk to his potions desk, but Potter got there first.
Harry smiled against Draco's mouth and pulled him back onto the bed, deepening the kiss as he slid his tongue lazily into Draco's mouth.
“Yes, of course.”
“I don’t know what you’re doing, but it feels fantastic,” Potter murmured sleepily.
"Potter," Draco said as Weasley leaned forward to investigate his options for another pint.

He closed his eyes, waiting.
Something dark, possessive, and dangerous coiled inside of Draco then, growing rapidly until it was a ball of hellish rage. He wove that fury into himself until he felt its powerful magic pooling in his veins. If rage was magic, this Death Eater would already be dead.
!” Draco clawed Harry’s shoulders as he slid his mouth up and down. Draco could hear himself moaning wantonly, but there was no controlling it; the sound was almost distant, as if he were submerged in water and hearing the voice of someone else. Draco’s hands slid from Harry’s shoulders up to the back of his neck and then dug forcefully into the back of Harry’s head. He was just barely restraining himself from thrusting forward and forcing himself down Harry’s throat. As if reading his mind, Harry wrapped a fist around the base of Draco’s cock and then slid his other hand along the tile floor until he was grasping the flesh of Draco’s buttocks, pulling him up into his mouth. Draco stopped trying to restrain himself. He clasped the back of that dark-haired head and thrust violently into Harry’s wet and eager mouth. Again. And again. And again.
Potter’s discomfort at the simple praise.
Weasley was waiting for them in the courtyard, leaning against a stone statue with his arms crossed. “Oh good! Just the men I wanted to see,” he pulled away from the statue and moved toward Harry and Draco. “Can one of you explain to me,” he looked pointedly between the two of them, “why a stag and a dragon are attempting to shag in the middle of the ballroom? Any ideas? There are

It was mid-March before Granger was able to help him with another potions experiment. As usual, she handed him the dropper and sat down at his desk, journal open and quill in hand. They were testing one of the potions that had no label whatsoever, which made them both a little nervous. Like all of the other potions, however, he had discovered in his preliminary tests that the potion contained no traditional ingredients that were used in poisons.
allowed himself to do what he had been dreaming of doing since that first night in the Great Hall. “Prudish?!” Draco ran his finger along the skin he found there, pushing his finger beneath the fabric to pull at Harry’s bare thigh. He pulled his fingers out again and placed a hand on either of Harry’s legs, scraping along Harry's thighs over his trousers. At the same time, Draco traced his tongue over the top of Harry’s shoulder, smiling when Harry’s trousers tightened at the crotch. Harry’s breath was already ragged by the time Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's hips and began unbuttoning his trousers. “Prudish, am I?”
Draco was silent for a long while, studying Potter as he walked in the cool night air below. He supposed he could offer another sarcastic remark, but Draco decided to go with honesty this time. “To protect him, I suppose. Your father has a knack for getting into trouble.” There hadn’t been any other sign of a Dark Mark in the sky, but Draco still wanted to be on guard. Knowing Potter, he’d probably run off alone without even informing anyone else what he was doing.
was seeing Potter’s pyjamas. But that didn’t even make any sense. Potter was married. Maybe Weaslette just didn’t comment on the terrible state of Potter’s pyjamas, because she had equally terrible taste. Or maybe--did married people stop counting their partner as an actual person? No matter. Whoever was failing to mock Potter’s pyjamas was failing at life. Draco would make up for it. “Look at it. That’s an actual tear.”

They crossed the classroom and Hermione opened the Potions office door with a wave of her wand. She cast light into the dark office, revealing a large room with a wide wooden desk and walls covered by bookshelves. Most of the bookshelves were empty, but there were at least 25 Potions books and some dried herbs scattered throughout the office. As Draco's eyes scanned the green and gold armchair in the corner, the one where he'd sat when he wanted to discuss a Potions question or needed some additional tutoring, he could almost see Severus Snape sitting behind his desk. Everywhere Draco looked was a memory. He hadn’t expected this. He had expected this part to be easier, somehow. He hadn’t expected to feel so
No. No. He was imagining all of it. Twisting the events.
been smiling at each other an awful lot lately. It was downright strange.
“No!” Draco yelled, slapping a hand toward his chest and wrapping it around the fabric at Potter’s wrist. Oh Merlin. He was going to say it. He was going to say something terrible. He wasn’t sure what he was going to say yet, exactly, but he knew he wouldn’t like it, and he certainly didn’t want Potter to hear it. Because some awful part of him
“Yes.”
“…at me, Mr Finnigan, it’s very important!”
It calmed him in ways he hadn’t experienced since his fifth year. It felt so naïve, to have once carelessly tossed ingredients into a pot, gaining satisfaction from a sinister curl of colour through bubbling liquid. So simplistic. Had he ever had so few cares?
her now, in love with someone who didn’t feel the same. Fuck it all, the bond would be the same broken shell, even if he did want it with all his heart.
He’d lost himself somewhere. Forgotten that his first duty was to himself, because even if he wanted to be altruistic, Salazar forbid, there was nothing he could do for anyone else if he himself were not whole. And he was breaking, doing it alone this time because there was only one person left in this world who he could call family. The rest were dead or vanished, and he’d fooled himself into thinking that he could cut a different niche for himself.
Draco wrenched his hand away. “You can’t tell me what to do.” But there was no force in it, and Harry’s hand encircled his with a gentle grip. He turned Draco around at last. Draco saw his face slacken in surprise and knew that he’d noticed the tears welling. Hated Harry for seeing it, for causing it, but he could only stare back miserably. Harry’s hold on him tightened and Draco felt the touch of Harry’s other hand on his arm, running up and down in cautious sweeps.
The second time he’d used Harry’s first name. Ginny straightened in surprise. No, it wasn’t the second time, but she’d dismissed it so quickly before, certain that he was being his usual snide self. Passed right by it several days ago.
He opened the door and found Draco collapsed on the floor, his face a deadly shade of white. Every single curse from every one of the one hundred and seventeen spelled tomes had been removed. And it was Hermione’s startled gasp that clenched it for him; McGonagall’s incredulous

Harry glared back. “As I said: I explained it to him.”
alright.”
“Some of them—We couldn’t get to them in time.” Blaise shut his eyes and when he opened them again, the vulnerable light had vanished. “Draco has most of them, but this girl… There’s no time, the Infirmary will have—”
It was the one thing she had the power to give to Harry, and she was nothing in the face of her self-pity. She’d actually thought she would be able to do it. But then, she’d never really believed she’d have to, had she?
A drunken nod. Malfoy’s face was like a stone tablet, blank on first glance, but when Harry peered closer, he could see it was etched deeply with lines of strangled emotion. He studied his old rival and saw the end in Malfoy’s eyes. Something tightened in Harry’s chest, and he swallowed against it.

“Merlin, where are you?” As if calling them would bring Seamus and Blaise to her like some wild Accio. They’d always been proof that she was headed for something greater. She couldn’t get it out of her mind that if they were with her again, here, she could have that fabled love for herself once more. The chance of it, at least.
Well. He didn’t feel entirely safe around her either. It was a fair trade. And if she’d matured somewhere in the hubbub of killing and massacring and magical destruction, who was he to judge? He still hadn’t matured enough to handle his role in this conflict, his purpose here in these woods. He covered it with lies about wanting to do the right thing.
He forced himself to meet Dumbledore’s eyes. “For not paying attention. For letting—” Godric almighty, was he, the supposed saviour, going to unknowingly condemn every one of his friends to death? “For letting it happen with him. It wasn’t supposed to be him.”
It was being spoken to him, somehow. Not sung. It felt as though it had always been a part of him, and yet Harry had never been aware of it before. His eyes flew to Luna’s and she met his gaze. Faces passed unbidden before him, and voices. Ginny’s. But there were others. He concentrated on Ginny’s voice, and Luna’s eyes flickered.
The bed by the far wall was neatly made. Undisturbed. Seemingly innocuous books were piled in droves about the room, in corners, at the foot of the large wing-backed chair in the centre. They were old tomes, cracked with age but well-cared for: Malfoy’s library. So Kingsley and Bill had been successful. Harry tore his eyes from the ancient texts and fixed them on the figure sitting in the chair instead.
Alas! - why would he do this?
“Oh.” Had she been hoping for it so fervently? Perhaps she needed her friends to distract her from what was coming. She made to sit down, but Harry stepped toward her.
“He came in here brandishing his wand, did he? Just walked right up and spelled the door—that door—open?”
The door clanged again and it hit him like a slap to the face. Warding spell. Blaise struggled to his feet, clutching his numb arm to his chest in an effort to prove it was actually there. The ward was still up, but fading; he didn’t need to feel the magic to tell him that. And it wasn’t keeping them from moving on foot, only Apparating.
happening right in front of their eyes.

Harry swallowed. “Badly.” It was terser than he liked, but it was all he could manage.
“Hermione, please. Please trust me. It’s Blaise, and… I have to go.”
“If I remember correctly, Ms Weasley was always quite skilled at getting herself out of trouble. Very like the rest of her family in that respect.”
“You’re the reason he’s here!” Finnigan shouted at Draco, his face red, his expression torn.
Katie jabbed her wand into his throat. “Say that again and I’ll—”
“We’ve enchanted the wode,” Su said, pointing at the markings swathing Morag’s arm from fingertip to elbow, so densely it looked like she wore one long sleeve. Harry peered closer and saw that the ink was actually a series of complicated knots, twining around each other in darker and darker layers. “We’ve gone a bit overboard, but it’s really just so we can do this.”
He’d come across several snare hexes as he’d approached, but to his trained eye, they were easy to see. Half of them were the invention of the Glenfallons, an ancient Wizarding family who had come to an ugly end centuries ago during the plague years, and standard classroom fodder for any sixth year Defence student. Severus Snape had been careful with his Slytherins; they knew the Glenfallon bewitchments like they knew their own heritage, and how to dismantle them.
Luna didn’t answer immediately, and then Minerva cleared her throat. “Ms Lovegood has proposed—to me—leaving the castle when the time comes.”
“So, what? Send someone else out?” Harry resisted the urge to pace. “Just ten minutes ago you were entirely against the idea.”
Malfoy was watching him, looking wounded in the flickering light. But Harry cast one spell, then another, checking for magical traces. He took his time, sorting through the conflicting auras—faint, but not unfamiliar. Malfoy. Old magic. Something darker. He’d felt it from Death Eaters before, a frail wisp of a putrid and black thing, not completely cleaned away. The object of his attention did nothing to stop him, nor did he attempt to speak. He simply sat, staring straight ahead, dirty fingers curling around each armrest. There was a weak blush on his cheeks and Harry paused, wondering about shame.
The students filed out of Gryffindor silently, staying well back from the middle of the corridor. Ron took the corners carefully, motioning everyone down, ducking low and peering around them before proceeding. But the sounds were still muted: Hermione didn’t think the fighting had come up here. They quickened to a jog, the children shuffling along in slippers and socks, some of the young ones wiping noses on sleeves as they went. Hermione ushered them along at an awkward sidestep, keeping one eye on the passageway behind them.
