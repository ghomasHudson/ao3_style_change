Their hair fell loose in front of their face in small waves which framed their face perfectly. Their lips had been carefully painted with a sheer gloss and there was a light pink dusted subtly across their eyelids. Their eyes were captured perfectly by sharp, black eyeliner and their lashed were long and thick. Their cheekbones shimmered with a bright white colour when their face hit the sun right. Draco came to a stop in front of Harry and smiled as they waited for him to say something.
Draco picked up his phone and rang Hermione. After what seemed like years, Hermione finally picked up.
When Draco was with Harry, it was like all feelings of sadness and anger were muted. When Draco was with Harry, he could only feel happiness, love and light. It was like Harry was the sun, wiping away every cloud and radiating light and happiness wherever he went.
"Well, I don't want our extremely playful kitten to play with the tree and make a mess of our living room!"
Harry took Draco to Hotel Chocolat and Draco picked out an advent calendar. Whilst Draco was choosing a calendar, Harry chose a 6 pack of little chocolates labelled 'Raspberry Smoothie'. They were little chocolate cylinders with a raspberry filling. They were the best things ever to grace the earth in Harry's opinion. Harry went and paid for the calendar and the little chocolates. On the way to the Lindt store, Harry and Draco shared the chocolates. At the Lindt store, Harry picked out a calendar.
"Hey, uh, if you don't mind me asking, what did that guy say to you that made you freeze up?" Harry asked. "Of course you don't have to tell me if you don't feel comfortable."
A flash in the mirror distracted Draco and he immediately whipped around to see what was there. His eyes met emerald green ones that hid behind circular glasses. Draco could see that Potter's mouth was open slightly and he immediately felt a rush of embarrassment. Draco grabbed up his things before rushing out of the changing rooms but he didn't get very far as a hand grabbing onto his wrist stopped him.
Draco groaned in pain, barely registering the strained noises coming from Harry. Draco turned their head to the side and saw Harry trying his hardest to stifle his laughter.
The pair stumbled over to the bed, their lips not breaking once. Draco's arms were wrapped around Harry's neck and Harry's hands lay on Draco's hips. They fell onto the bed, their lip breaking contact for just a second, but even in that second, Harry was desperate to feel that closeness to Draco again. They immediately came together again, kissing with even more desperation than before. Draco's hand began to slip under Harry's shirt, his hand running up and down Harry's torso. Harry shivered, every touch felt electric, like something Harry had never felt before.
"I'm sorry." Draco whispered. Just through that short explanation, he could hear the pain and fear in Hermione's voice.
Harry put in his coat, hat and shoes on as quietly as possible. He crept down the stairs, avoiding the ones that creaked. Harry had been on way to many midnight snack raids by now to know which steps creaked and where about they creaked. He tip toed to the door and slowly opened it without creating any noise. He lifted his foot to step outside.
"Stop giving me puppy eyes." Harry chuckled as he plopped back down on the sofa and began sorting through the takeout bag. "Give me a second, okay?"
"Harry James Potter, you are the love of my life. No, you're more than that, you are my life and I couldn't survive without you. You have no idea how much you mean to me and the though if coming home everyday to you makes me so happy. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to spend forever with you. I never want to be without you. So, Harry, will you marry me?"
Harry's mind kept flicking back to when Draco froze up. The look of fear, discomfort and disgust that lay on Draco's face just didn't sit right with Harry. Draco had always been strong-willed and barely let any words get to them so Harry knew that whatever that person had said must've been bad if it made them react the way they did.
Harry and Draco said their goodbyes to everyone before driving home. The two jammed out to some Christmas songs on the way home as this was technically the last day they could listen to them before it was 'illegal'.
The three began to climb the stairs up to Hermione's apartment and headed towards her door to find someone already standing outside. Harry and Draco recognised who it was instantly but it took Ron a few seconds to catch on.
Draco wiped a tear away from his face before falling asleep. Draco pulled the cover up and over his face in case his mother came in. The one thing Draco didn't want was his mother seeing him upset.
Harry gave Draco one of the most genuine smiles they had ever seen and leant over and pressed a kiss to their nose. "Thank you."
"What do you mean? I am a great cook and a great teacher, I think you'll find." Draco gasped in mock offence.
"But we don't do that." Harry chuckled as he walked away from the tree. "Are you glad we got a real tree now?"
"You're perfect Draco. For finding him and bringing home, this is honestly the best Christmas present ever. Thank you so much." Harry leant forward and gave Draco a kiss, being careful that he didn't squash Bud.
Draco ran over to the ambulance, he needed to get there as quickly as possible. Draco still didn't know the full extent of the injuries that Harry had but he knew they were serious. Draco couldn't help but panic because what if there was something seriously wrong with Harry.
Draco couldn't count the amount of times him and Harry had fallen asleep, holding each other, both of them crying. Even though it was so painful for the both of them, they were both so happy they finally had each other again and Draco swore that he would never let anything happen to his Harry again.
Every time Draco found himself alone, he put his eyeliner on, each time the eyeliner becoming more perfect, each side becoming more even and each line becoming sharper. Every time the black was painted around his eyes, Draco couldn't help but admire himself. He thought he looked pretty, really pretty.
Harry glanced down at their hands, which were loosely intertwined, almost like a constant reassurance that the neither of them wanted to let go and escape one another. Harry saw a burst of colour on Draco's arm as they rolled up the sleeves of their shirt. Harry raised Draco's arm and looked at Draco for confirmation that it was okay before running his fingers over it.
Hermione nodded her head sympathetically. "That meeting must've been really difficult to sit through."
Harry searched around in a few drawers before finding the cookie cutters. He took the biggest circular on and handed it to Draco. Draco went to cut a circle out right in the middle of the pastry.
"That's nice, I suppose." Hermione said, sounding not entirely sure like she knew what to say in response to Harry's statement.
Hermione just nodded and put her arm around Draco's shoulder and walked him to the ambulance. The paramedics were already rushing over to meet Draco and they were putting masks and other equipment on Harry. Draco reluctantly passed Harry over to a paramedic. It annoyed Draco that they couldn't go to St. Mungo's but Harry was too weak to apparate and there were muggles around.
Draco sighed and concentrated on his surroundings. It wasn't very interesting but anything to take him away from his thoughts. He was following his friends to a cafe. Everyone agreed that they should all sit down together and just talk about things and catch up. Draco wasn't sure if a talk with his friends would make him feel better but he could always count on a coffee to make him feel slightly better.
Draco looked up at Harry through their heavy eyes and saw that Harry was in the same state as themselves, eyelids low and somewhere in between being awake and asleep. Cute, Draco thought. If this was the view Draco would have every night before they fell asleep then they would die a very happy person. A quick glance to the clock confirmed that it was getting quite late and a brief thought that they should maybe move to the bed crossed Draco's mind but he couldn't bring themselves to move from this position.
"Harry. I am a little bit annoyed at you. I told you to wear more layers but you didn't and now I have to put up with an ill you, which is not fun for me." Draco ranted.
"Not the point." Draco sniffled before looking down at the floor and then looking back up at Harry with eyes so full of love it almost made Harry want to run away and hide because how did he ever get this lucky? "I love you. So much."
"I love you." Draco whispered into the phone before ending the call and turning to face Hermione and Ron.
"Oh yeah. Forgot to mention that me and Harry have been going out for three months." Draco smirked as he grabbed Harry's hand and they walked away, leaving Pansy and Hermione with their mouths hanging open.
Draco ran up to the Gryffindor common room as fast as he could and said the password the the Fat Lady. Draco and Harry had been dating for around a year now so Harry kept Draco updated on the Gryffindor password and Draco kept Harry updated on the Slytherin password. Draco climbed through the hole and bumped into Hermione.
Harry felt his feet make contact with the ground and he for a fleeting moment he felt relief before his knees buckled, unable to support his weight. Harry shut his eyes as he prepared to make contact with the ground but opened them in surprise as someone stopped him from falling. Harry immediately regretted opening his eyes as the world spun violently around him. He gripped onto the arm holding him up to stabilise himself.
Harry waited as Draco went over to ask a worker whether they had any Colorado Blue Spruces. When Draco came back, he told Harry that the worker said that there was only one left and it was in the fourth aisle, middle right. Draco and Harry walked to where the worker said the tree was and the found it. It was laying in its side so Draco pulled it up.
Draco had never been to Godric's Hollow before. He knew it was inhabited largely by the magical community but some muggles lived there. Draco had always wondered what Godric's Hollow looked like, whether it was a lively place or more quiet. Draco wondered if Harry's home was still there, if it had been rebuilt, knocked down or just left how it was. He also wondered what Lily, James, Sirius and Remus's graves looked like. He wondered if they were the most decorated graves, if there was always flowers next to where they lay.
The receptionist looked up and saw the state of Draco and Hermione. "Well, he's just come out of a meeting so if you're quick, he should have about ten minutes to talk."
Draco let out a soft exhale and ran their hands through their hair. This night had been somewhat of a rollercoaster but Harry had been there to get them off in the end. If Draco thought about it, most things ended up leading back to Harry. Draco laughed softly to themselves, it was always going to be Harry. It had to be, no one else could light up Draco's emotions the way Harry could. No one else would be able to storm into their life and bring everything that Harry had managed to.
"Yeah, I do. I do know." Harry murmured, not releasing his tight grip on Draco until he was sure they had stopped crying.
And the smile that broke out onto Draco's face, that- Harry knew - that is what he wanted to see for the rest of his life.
"You're so in love it makes me feel so single." Ron said, chucking the cushion back at Harry who caught it expertly. Ron's face fell slightly before Harry put all of his force into throwing the cushion at Ron.
"The fuck do you want Pansy?" Draco grumbled. "I'm trying to sleep on my boyfriends thighs, which were obviously gifted to him by a god or something because there's no way they'd be this big otherwise." Draco knew their brain to mouth filter didn't work very well when they were tired or sleepy but they couldn't bring themselves to care, it was the truth after all.
Draco didn't show his love for Christmas in public. He never wore a Christmas jumper, or anything Christmassy for that matter. Harry had tried time and time again to get Draco to wear anything Christmassy but Draco point blank refused every single time. One time, Harry had snuck some Christmas socks into Draco's sock drawer but later, he found the socks in their bed with a note next to them saying
"Goodnight." Hermione yawned. She gave everyone a hug before walking to hers and Ron's bedroom. It was a mini tradition between the six of them to give a hug to everyone before they went to bed.
Harry and Draco spent about 30 minutes building the perfect snowman. It was made up of 3 balls of snow, gradually getting smaller as they went up. They were perfectly round and were placed on top of each other just right. Draco sent Harry to look for stones and sticks to act is the snowman eyes and arms while he finished off the head. Draco was nearly finished with everything when he felt something very cold collide with his head.
"Jealousy." Ron stated bluntly. Draco and Hermione looked at him, waiting for him to elaborate. Ron sighed before carrying on. "What if they're jealous of Harry's success and they think having Harry out of the picture would push them further to the top? Or what if they're jealous of his relationship? What if they wanted you for themselves and they're just getting Harry out of the way to get closer to you? Or what if they wanted Harry for themselves? It's a perfectly plausible suggestion with the amount of crazed, obsessed fans out there." Ron coughed which sounded suspiciously like 'and friends'.
Paranoia was running at full sprint around Draco's body. Panic really started to seep into Draco. Because of Harry's depression, anxiety and PTSD, he only slept at his and Draco's flat and Hermione and Ron's flat. Harry refused to stay the night anywhere else unless he was with Draco, Ron or Hermione but even then, he was still hesitant. The Dursley's, Voldemort and the war had taken a great toll on Harry's mental health and he struggled with flashbacks, nightmares and panic attacks.
It had only been a few seconds but it felt like years and Harry was ready to leave the hall. God, this was becoming more uncomfortable by the second. Just when Harry was ready to pull himself and Draco out of the hall and out of the started of the other students and staff, he heard someone begin to clap.
No, no, no. Draco wouldn't do that to him. Harry recalled something Draco had told him once, that he liked to be fashionably late so he could make an entrance. That was it, Draco was going to show up, he was just being fashionably late. All Harry needed to do was just wait a little bit long-
Draco moved more quickly through the flat and the worry that was sitting in his chest had now become paranoia running through his veins. After checking every room in the flat, Draco went back into the living room.
"Oh, I don't know Ron, maybe it was because I wanted to keep it a secret but I mean, it's anyone's guess really." Harry replied.
The days blurred past. Days merged into nights and nights merged into days. Not sleeping was Draco's new normal. Fuck, he wasn't even sure how long it had been since Harry had gone missing, he'd lost count of the days. It had been long. Too long.
"Because they knew Harry would never be able to recover from that. If you got kidnapped, Draco, Harry would never be the same again which is why I think it's more likely they've taken Harry because they want him for themselves because it's the same with you Draco. You'll never be the same person again if we don't find Harry." Ron said.
It had been five days since Seamus had officially been ruled as the prime suspect and no one could find him anywhere. No one knew where Seamus would take him or where Harry could possibly be. Seamus clearly knew what he was doing because he left no traces and no clues. It was suspected that Seamus was still inside the country as no one under the name of Seamus Finnegan or Harry Potter had left the country, but then again, Seamus could've smuggled Harry out.
"How could you forget about that? We almost burned down the school." Draco didn't look so fondly upon that memory.
Harry and Draco walked down the aisle, everyone clapping for them. They walked into the room where the food would be served, everyone following behind them. The food was delicious, Molly had made it all. After a few speeches had been made by Ron, Arthur, Hermione, Pansy, Harry and Draco, the newly weds stepped out of the tent while everything was cleared away in room for a dance floor.
"Fair enough." Ron walked over to Harry and patted his shoulder. "I'll go out and get some ice cream."
Draco pulled open the box and saw a face he would recognise anywhere. Draco immediately went to hug the man in front of him, inhaling the familiar scent, finally getting the touch he had been craving.
"Yeah, yeah. I just... wasn't expecting that, I suppose." Draco gave Harry a small smile. "Thank you. I really appreciate it."
Harry huddled up into his jacket as the cold of the evening air hit him, though the beginning of excitement thrumming through his veins warmed him up. It wasn't the type of excitement where he was jumping around and ecstatic, it was the type of excitement that subconsciously brought a smile to Harry's face and he couldn't bite it back, no matter how hard he tried.
Draco took Harry's hand in his and relished in the familiar feeling. The roughness of his hands, the warmth and the way their hands fit perfectly together, like a jigsaw. Draco began to rub small circles with his thumb on Harry's hand, he always did this to calm Harry.
Draco walked down the hall and looked past the door that led to the kitchen. Harry wasn't there. The silence became oddly intimidating to Draco. If Harry was here, he would be able to hear the TV, he would be able to hear Harry cooking, he would be able to hear the shower running.
The afternoon faded into early evening with everyone not ready to leave quite yet, wanting to extend this moment and preserve it like a special treasure forever. That's what this was, Harry supposed, a piece of treasure. It wasn't often that he felt so light and so free.
"Uh, um, we need to um..." Draco struggled to put a sentence together as he tried to comprehend what was happening. "We need to check parks, fields and anywhere around Ginny's house he could've gone."
Draco sighed before looking at everyone. He met everyone's eyes as he sat up. Was he alright? Draco wasn't sure if he could lie anymore. It was obvious from his appearance that he was anything but alright. His eyes were bloodshot and his under eyes were so dark. His hair was always messy and Draco was sure he'd lost quite a bit of weight.
Draco could hear and feel this photo. He could hear Harry's laugh so clearly as it flew away with the perfect noise of everything else. He could feel the wind as it whipped past his body but most importantly, he could feel Harry's gaze. He could feel the warm, fuzzy sensation he got whenever Harry looked at him like that, his eyes full of love and happiness. It was so obvious to anyone who saw this photo that Harry was filled entirely with love and happiness. The way the photo captured the glint in his eyes and the dimples in his cheek was just perfect.
The two walked in silence, their hands entwined, both admiring the pure beauty that lay before them. They came upon a clearing in the path an hour into their walk that opened up into a circular field that led down to the lake. The two stood by the edge of the lake, both staring at the castle in the distance. That castle was their home. That castle was their childhood. That castle changed everything.
"The beds comfier so I think I'll stay here. Thanks for the offer though." Harry said as he slipped under the covers and looked at Draco with a smirk.
It felt wrong to involve the muggle police in this. Draco was used to working with wizards and only wizards and wizards could do so much more then the muggle police. But, as much as Draco hated to admit it, Hermione was right. There would be a higher chance of finding him.
Ron and Hermione owned a two bedroom cottage by the coast of Devon which they stayed in when they went on holiday. It was really beautiful and quaint, Draco knew as he had been down with Harry, Ron and Hermione before. Draco knew Ron and Hermione wouldn't take Harry but there was a chance someone could've taken him there.
Draco crossed the town square where he saw a few other people walking around and walked through the iron gates into the graveyard. Draco walked methodically through the graveyard, trying to locate the graves. Harry had told Draco that their graves were next to each other, it made sense, they were all best friends.
When the two had finished their food, Draco slumped down to stretch out over the length of the sofa and ended up with their head in Harry's lap. Draco gave a satisfied him and snuggled closer into Harry. Harry threw a blanket over Draco and smiled down fondly at them. Harry began to gently run his fingers through Draco's hair.
"Honestly. We can't bake for shit." Harry chuckled lightly. "I'm actually really craving a mince pie right now though."
Draco placed his hands on the edges of the sink and looked down. He could feel the tears threatening to spill. That's when he became aware of the bracelet sitting on his wrist. He had always knew it was there but recently he had just forgotten about it. He slid it off his wrist and held it in his hands.
Ron, Hermione, Draco and Molly sat and had a cup of tea and talked everything over before Draco and Hermione left for the police station. Draco was still hesitant in letting the muggle police get involved but he knew it was best.
"Are they bothering you?" Harry asked Draco, his eyes flicking up the person that stood in front of them.
Malfoy just smirked as he slowly dragged the lipstick across his lips. Malfoy pressed his lips together and released them with a small 'pop' sound and he looked at Harry, pouting slightly.
Draco lightly bumped their head against Harry's chest, their way of saying goodnight when they were too tired to talk. Draco didn't want to be anywhere else in that moment, they wanted to stay here forever listening to Harry's slow breaths and being wrapped up and held by someone they... loved? Yeah, someone they loved.
Everyone linked arms and Harry watched as Hermione flicked her wrist, causing them to apparate. It was just as unpleasant as Harry remembered. it felt like he was being pressed very hard from all directions, his lungs were growing smaller as air refused to enter them and it felt like there we're iron bands tightening around his chest. He was spinning in every direction, like he was stuck on some sort of twisted merry-go-round.
Draco wasn't sure if any of his friends knew about today, they probably didn't seeing as they most definitely would have mentioned it if they did. Draco knew he needed to be around people he trusted to keep himself grounded. The bracelet on Draco's wrist made him feel ever so slightly better as it was like he had a tiny part of Harry with him today.
"Draco, are you okay? You've been acting a little strangely over these past few day." Narcissa asked, gently.
"I haven't, it has to have been well over a week since I last spoke to him. Let me ask Ron." Hermione said. Draco waited a few moments. "No, he hasn't heard from him either. Why?"
Draco stepped into the apartment. The once comforting place now felt cold and unfamiliar. It felt like all the light had been sucked out. Nothing felt right anymore, everything felt like too much. There was too much room in the apartment, there was too many things.
"This is- this is-," Ron's face broke out into a huge smile. "This is awesome! You two look so good together!" Ron walked towards Hermione and hugged her. "I'm happy for you 'Mione."
Draco raised his eyebrows and shook his head before returning to his search for the baking brush. By the time he had found it, Harry had managed to clean up all the milk and successfully get it into the cup without spilling any. Draco gently brushed milk over the top of each mince pie whilst Harry sprinkled sugar over them. When they had finished, Draco put the mince pies in the oven.
Draco gave Harry his card back before making a start on the Christmas pudding. It didn't take too long to put together, it was the cooking that took forever. Draco had to steam it for eight hours today and then for one hour tomorrow. When Draco was making it, he dropped a tiny teddy bear trinket that he had bought in the mixture. It was a tradition when Draco was younger, he just had to make sure he remembered to tell people about it.
The wedding was to be held in the garden of the burrow, like Bill and Fleur's, in a white tent, charmed to be a lot bigger on the inside. There would be two rooms inside the tent, one where the vows would take place and the other where the dancing and the eating would be. Draco had planned everything out to the tiniest detail with the help of Hermione. Harry had been there for the major decisions of course but it was a mutual decision between the two boys that Draco should take control.
"Glad we're on the same page." Ron smiled before he turned to Harry and Draco and pointed at the angrily. "I cannot believe you two didn't tell me. Best friend my ass."
"Laugh. I fucking dare you." Draco threatened before sighing and resting their head back on the floor and holding their arms out. "Take me to bed."
"We've done everything we can in this bloody room. We've played every game, we've read every book, we've tidied it up three bloody times. What are we supposed to do?" Harry asked, frustrated.
"Don't thank me. I just did what every friend should." Hermione squeezed Draco one last time before she let go and ran over to the others to update them.
Draco sat on top of a rock, shut his eyes and listened to the gentle trickle of the stream. When it was hot, sometimes Harry and Draco dipped their feet in the clear water that ran through the forest floor. It was peaceful and beautiful here, no matter the season. In the summer, the rays of the sun broke through the trees, illuminating parts of the forest and there was so much wildlife. In the winter, everything frosted over, giving the sense that you were in some sort of winter wonderland. It was just perfect here.
"Uhh... no." Harry was now sitting on top of Draco. He made sure that he was sitting on Draco's crotch to tease him.
Harry turned his head and looked at Ron, who was stood behind him in a similar suit. Ron shot him a reassuring smile and Harry could feel the pounding of his heart slow down a little, though the thrum of excitement under his skin only seemed to pick up.
He remembered how all his demons seemed to leave during that trip, and so did Harry's. Draco had never seen Harry look so at peace during that trip. It was Ron and Neville's idea and Draco couldn't be more thankful that they came up with it.
Draco nodded, running their hands over the material. It felt so nice and soft. Draco tilted their head to the side slightly, looking in the mirror. They felt really happy.
Harry clutched his hand over his chest, his heart thundering so hard in his chest that he felt dizzy. Harry fell onto his bed, he was so utterly fucked but he didn't care at all.
Harry pressed play on the compilation and watched up to the 2012 advert. During the 2011 advert, a smile had made its way onto Draco's face.
They pulled away, staring at each other, breaths slightly heavier than normal before Harry rested his hand below Draco's ear and pulled them in once again. Harry felt Draco's hand on his waist, pulling him closer until there was no space left between them and Harry could feel the beating of Draco's heart against his chest. Harry never wanted to escape from the closeness he felt to Draco in that moment.
Harry coughed and spluttered as Ron repeatedly thumped him on the back. It wasn't until Harry had stopped choking that he looked up and even though his vision was blurry with tears from his previous coughing fit, he swore he saw Malfoy smirking.
It took a while for Draco to build up the courage to wear the clothes out in public. They took it in small steps: first they wore nail polish out in public, then they wore makeup and finally they wore the clothes they felt most comfortable in. Their mother and father didn't know about anything and frankly, Draco was glad they didn't because Merlin knows how they would react.
"Yeah, of course I'll come. I need some new highlighter anyway. Why do you need to go to the makeup shop though?" Pansy asked, her brows furrowed in confusion.
Draco recognised the voice immediately and felt frustration rise up within them before the promptly fell back onto Harry's lap to go back to sleep.
It was two days before the ball and neither Harry or Draco had been themselves. They both knew exactly what was up but refused to give in to their friends relentless curiosity. Both Harry and Draco were becoming quite irritated now but they both knew Pansy, Blaise and Ron and Hermione only had their best interests at heart.
Harry woke up the next morning and rolled over to snuggle into Draco. Instead of rolling into the familiar body, Harry rolled onto his face. Harry sat up in confusion, also why was it a little bit cold in here and why did he have a jumper on?
For the rest of the holidays, Draco was always out of bed before Harry and Harry didn't have to deal with the normal grumpy Draco in the morning, which Harry was very thankful for.
"I know you've been wanting it for ages and I thought you could wear it for the Hogwarts reunion coming up." Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
Harry knew he hadn't developed feeling feelings for Draco just like that. He didn't develop crushes quickly, his crushes often involved a lot of angsty pining before Harry realised he liked them and by that point, it was often too late. Harry had always felt something towards the blonde, being the most oblivious person, Harry thought for the first six years he knew Draco that what he felt towards them was hatred. Until Harry realised that maybe hatred wasn't the reason behind him constantly thinking about Draco or often following their name on the marauders map.
He didn't know where he was running to. He needed to escape this feeling, this feeling of nothing and everything at the same time. He was so overwhelmed. Draco couldn't understand how those people managed to go about their lives like they were innocent.
Harry gave himself a quick once over in the mirror, making sure he looked okay. He was wearing a white t-shirt tucked into a pair of blue jeans with a short sleeved, pink shirt over the top. Draco had insisted that they matched in some way so had bought Harry the pink shirt, Harry had no complaint though, he would do anything to make Draco happy.
Draco smiled as he slid the silver band onto Harry's finger. He stood up before bringing Harry into a hug. Draco pressed his forehead against Harry's and stared into his emerald eyes. Draco wondered how he managed to get so lucky. Right now, in this moment, everything was perfect.
Draco just nodded before leaving the office. He was still holding Hermione's hand, he was scared to let go. Hermione's hand was acting as an anchor to reality.
It all made sense now. Seamus had loved Harry since they were kids and going that long without Harry ever showing signs of reciprocating those feelings or giving him attention would be enough to drive him crazy. Everything fit together perfectly. Seamus had a high position in the ministry and therefore would have easy access to the mislocator, the signs that his warehouse had recently been used, the fact that no one had seen him in ages. It all made sense.
Draco wanted feverishly for Saturday to come, he was so excited that it seemed like time had slowed down just to mess with him. He decided he wasn't going to tell Harry that he was getting new makeup, he wanted it to be a surprise. He wanted to see Harry's reaction when he saw him with more makeup on. Draco loved how flustered Harry got when he wore makeup and how pink his cheeks and the tops of his ears got. Even though Harry had seen him with makeup on plenty of times, it was still like he was seeing it for the first time.
This was very true. It was clear to basically everyone that Astoria had a giant crush on Draco and it was also clear to everyone that Draco hated Astoria with every fibre of his being but somehow, Astoria didn't manage to pick up on that. She was so annoying and always seeked for Draco's approval on everything and it drove Draco around the bloody bend.
Harry really wanted to go to Starbucks as they had just brought back the red cups and the drinks were amazing but Draco was being extra clingy and wouldn't let Harry leave their room. Harry was about to lose his temper, he wasn't a morning person but he found it nearly impossible to get mad at Draco.
"Mr.Malfoy, Miss.Granger, good to-," Kingsley stopped in his tracks when he saw Draco and Hermione. "Goodness, what happened to you two? Please sit down."
"I'm Draco, Harry's boyfriend." Draco whispered. He cleared his throat before speaking again. "I don't know if you know this but Harry's missing, he's been kidnapped and he's been gone for while now. Every moment without him just becomes more painful. I love Harry, Merlin, I love him so much it hurts sometimes and now that's he's not here with me, I just feel lost. I feel lost and scared and broken. And, I'm trying to stay hopeful and optimistic, you know, but it's hard." Draco's voice broke and he found himself struggling to carry on. "It's hard because with every day that passes and he still hasn't been found, all I hear from police officers is that it's less and less likely that he'll be found alive or that he'll even be found at all. And, I don't know what to do with those words. I don't know how to process that fact that he may never come back to me and I may never see him again." Draco wiped away the tears falling down his cheeks. "I haven't spoken to any of you before but I can't help but think it would be easier if even just one of you was still here. Anyway, I came here to tell you that I will find Harry. I will never stop looking until I find him, I'll find him if it's the last thing I do. If I find Harry and he's dead," Draco had to pause and try to swallow the lump in his throat that was preventing him from speaking. "If I find him and he's dead, I will bury him next to you. This is where he'd be happiest, next to is parents and godparents. But, that won't happen because I promise to find Harry alive. I promise to find Harry."
"Calm the fuck down." Ron said. "Harry, I'm not going to lie but I am at about my wits end with you. All your doing is freaking out and saying you look horrible, when in fact, you look great. Did you forget about the hairspray that Hermione gave you?" Ron picked up the bottle and started to fix Harry's hair. "Look, all fixed. I don't want to hear another complaint come out of your mouth because you, Harry James Potter, look fabulous. All I'm saying is that if I was gay, I would."
He quickly ran a hand through his hair and decided that it looked good enough. He had long since given up on trying to tame his curls and it had taken four hours, a pair of straighteners and a whole bottle of hairspray for Draco to give up too. Harry quickly rifled through his bag, making sure he had everything he needed before swinging it over his shoulder and walking out of his room.
Harry could think of many ways and words to describe Draco, but none of them seemed to do them justice. There was one word that could capture Draco as a whole: perfect. They were perfect from the depth of their eyes to the gentle expressions of his voice. They were perfect from their generous opinions to the touch of their hand upon Harry's own. Harry adored the way Draco's voice quickened when they sparkled with a new idea, or was so enjoying one of Harry's that they looked like they lost themselves for a moment and forgot about everything wrong with the world. Harry wanted to give Draco his everything.
"I'm not going to give you money because you still don't fully understand it but I'll give you my card. When you go to pay, just place the card in front of the card reader, okay?" Harry held his card out to Draco.
"16 years of practice pays off I suppose." Draco chuckled. "Right, so let's focus on the right hand melody first and then we'll focus on adding in the left hand."
Draco jumped when he heard people enter the common room, he immediately wiped off the eyeliner and hid the tube deep in his bedside drawer. He couldn't let anyone see him wearing makeup, his father would not be happy of he found out Draco was wearing makeup. Also, the other students would probably make fun of him, whether he looked stunning or not didn't matter, the fact that he was wearing makeup, annoyingly stereotyped as a 'girl thing', would be enough to make the other students ridicule him for the rest of his time at Hogwarts. At least that's what Draco thought.
"First things first, have you seen yourself?" Harry then turned Draco's body so the pair were facing each other. "Draco, you're... god, I don't even know how to put it into words. It's like my entire body fills with warmth whenever I'm around you or think of you. I could say all the cliché things as they're true but it's so much more than that. Yes, you make me laugh and smile but you fill me with a sense of belonging. I want to see you at your best and I want to be with you through your worst. I want to wake up next to you and cook you breakfast on a Sunday morning. I look at you and I think 'yeah, I can imagine spending the rest of my life with you'." Harry smiled softly. "Honestly Draco, I think I might be falling in love with you."
Harry spent a few more moments just looking at Draco and appreciating the person he had in front of him. Harry couldn't imagine a life where he wasn't completely and utterly in love with them. Harry's smile only grew wider as he turned and nodded to Neville.
Harry searched up YouTube on his laptop and got up a compilation of all the John Lewis Christmas ads since 2007.
It was only a second before Draco landed in Godric's Hollow. He lifted his head and took in the street before him. It was quaint, a slightly wonky road lined with cottages. The village seemed small and quiet, Draco couldn't see anyone else. He supposed more people would be in the town square and at the church. Draco could see the church's spiel above the cottages roofs. Draco began to make his way towards the church, walking slowly down the narrow street.
Harry and Draco had been invited to Pansy's Christmas party that she was holding as a little reunion for all the 8th years that came back to Hogwarts. There was only around 30 who came back and everyone became quite close. It had been a year since they had all graduated, Harry was now an auror and Draco was still in training to become a healer, and Pansy had decided it was time for everyone to meet back up again. On the invitation, there was a dress code. Harry sighed when he saw the words 'dress code', he knew that probably meant he would have to wear a suit and he really didn't want to do that. But to Harry's surprise, the dress code just read 'Festive'. It was the day of the party and Draco and Harry were having a... discussion about whether Draco should wear a christmas jumper.
Everyone came along to visit Harry. They had gifts for Harry and Draco but Draco didn't want to open his without Harry. It was mid afternoon when everyone apart from Ron and Hermione left. They stayed for another half an hour to check up on Draco. See how he was holding up. Draco was barely holding on but he held in how he was truly feeling. He didn't want to ruin Ron and Hermione's Christmas with his tears or with his pain. Draco eventually told them to go, go and enjoy the rest of their Christmas and that he would be alright. Draco stayed until 7pm before he decided to leave. Harry didn't wake up, but Draco didn't expect anything else.
The Hall was beautifully decorated. The ceiling was bewitched to make it seem as if snow was falling from the sky which was lit up by thousands of stars and lanterns. Icicles hung from the ceiling, around the walls and three Christmas trees stood proudly at the end of the Hall. The floor was a beautiful white colour, with an effect to make it look like ice. A raised stage stood in the corner where a band was playing a slow song. Everything about it was stunning.
Harry looked up and saw a blush make its way onto Draco's face. God, Draco just looked so beautiful right now. Everything combined together, the smile on his face, the blush on his cheeks, the twinkle in his eyes, just made Draco look like a piece of art gifted to the world by angels.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead. Little did Harry know that Draco wouldn't be sleeping that night. As soon as Harry had fallen asleep, Draco carefully got out of their bed and got to work.
Everyone ordered (Draco just getting a black coffee) and thanked Dean. Everyone got their drinks and quietly sipped. A silence fell across the table, no one knew what to say. It was strange because everyone had so much to say but didn't know where to start.
The first six months after everything had been horrible. Draco had never seen Harry like he was then and it scared him. Harry had nightmares nearly every night that left him sobbing and shaking and Draco struggled to console him. Along with his nightmares, Harry's flashbacks and panic attacks became worse and were more frequent. Draco tried his best to comfort Harry and try to make him feel safe but sometimes Harry pushed him away, he was too scared to let Draco close to him.
The husbands danced and laughed throughout the night. They caught up with their old school mates, ate food and had the best time of their lives. At ten minutes to midnight, Harry and Draco said their goodbyes to everyone before heading up the hill that lay just outside the burrow. The men would be going on their honeymoon tomorrow afternoon, after they had spent Christmas morning with the Weasleys and Hermione.
Finally, Draco moved onto the last thing he was looking for. Highlighter. Draco knew he wanted a colder toned highlighter, like silver or white. One that would blind you when you looked at it and Draco knew he had found it when his eyes landed on a white highlighter. This was it, this would complete his look. Draco smiled, imagining what it would be like when he saw all of it on at the same time.
Draco and Harry had stopped throwing petty insults at each other and instead just pretended to ignore each other. Pansy actually congratulated Draco on growing up when she realised he and Harry had stopped fighting. Draco rolled his eyes when she said that but it was true, he couldn't deny it. He much preferred the secret glances, smirks and winks during class.
The days passed annoyingly slowly but finally, it was Saturday and to say Draco was excited was an understatement. Draco walked into the Great Hall with a huge smile on his face but quickly wiped it off after basically the whole school turned and gaped at the sight of Draco Malfoy smiling.
Harry didn't develop crushes quickly, it was just something that didn't happen. His crushes involved a lot of angsty pining before Harry realised he liked them and by that point, it was often too late. He couldn't have just developed feelings for Malfoy like that and the more Harry thought about, the more he realised he didn't develop feelings for Malfoy just like that. Harry had always thought Malfoy was good looking and he always had admired his stubbornness and unwillingness to back down from anything he set his mind to. Harry did often find himself thinking about Malfoy and what he was doing, staring at Malfoy in class and following Malfoy's name on the marauders map.
"Thank you." Harry leant forward and gave Draco a quick kiss on the cheek. The two found it impossible to stay mad at each other.
"Do you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, take Harry James Potter to be your lawfully wedded husband, promising to love and cherish, through joy and sorrow, sickness and health, and whatever challenges you may face, until death do you part?" The vicar asked.
Harry slowly got up and made his way over to Draco who was swaying softly to the music with Luna, laughing about something with her. Harry walked up behind Draco and slid his hands around their waist and pressed a gentle kiss to their cheek. Draco turned their face to meet Harry's and pressed a kiss to Harry's lips, smiling into it.
"How can you be so sure?" Draco mumbled, their hands gripping onto Harry's top as a silent plea for him to never leave.
"Harry, stop." Ron ordered. Harry stopped and looked at Ron. "You need to calm the fuck down, okay. I know you want to impress your date tonight but this-." Ron motioned to Harry. "-isn't going to impress them."
Draco, Hermione and Ron's voices overlapped each other as they informed everyone that Harry was missing. Draco hung up the phone and placed his head in his hands. God, he was going to have to go to the ministry and say it again. Draco couldn't even imagine himself saying those words again.
"I need to go to that makeup shop in Hogsmeade you mentioned so I was wondering if you wanted to come with me?"
"I've never dealt well with apparating." Harry explained, going to pull his hand out of Draco's because he didn't want to get their hand sweaty.
Draco woke with a gasp, his had subconsciously resting over his heart. He had woken up like this for the past couple of days - a small pain running through his chest and his skin lightly covered with sweat. It's almost like he can feel Harry's pain and desperation.
Harry shuffled forwards, teasing Draco even more and poked his chest. "You think I'm uncultured? Tell me, where does the phrase 'Yoo hoo! Big summer blowout!' come from?"
"I don't see the problem with tinsel. It itches, it's tacky meahmeahmeah. I should just sneak out and get some. Wait, that's actually a good idea. Yes, Harry!" Harry said to himself.
Draco knew Hermione and Ron were at the party, which means Harry is probably with them. Draco felt the paranoia slow down a little. It wouldn't completely go away until he knew his Harry was safe.
And honestly, Harry didn't blame younger self because Draco looked stunning to say the least. Harry watched as a person approached Draco and strike up a conversation with them. Being an auror, Harry was extremely good at reading people's body language and right off the bat he could tell Draco was uncomfortable. They stood tight and upright with their hands were folded in front of them. Their movements were stiff and their expression mirrored one of discomfort.
"It's basically liquid chocolate. Starbucks do this really nice one at Christmas, salted caramel brownie hit chocolate." Harry explained.
"Pansy did it for me when she was practicing to become a licensed tattoo artist." Draco ran their hands through their hair. "She knew I hated the mark so she did what she could to take attention away from it. I forget the mark is even there sometimes because the flowers are so beautiful."
Draco almost wanted to take a picture of it and frame it because Draco wanted to claim it as theirs. They knew they had no right to want to claim anything of Harry's as their own but everyone needed to be a little bit greedy now and again. Draco could hear their heart beating considerably faster than it normally did as they noticed Harry's soft smile as he observed what Draco was holding.
Draco had no idea how he ended up at number 4 Privet Drive with the police standing behind him. The exterior of the house was identical to every other house on the street, it looked so stereotypically normal and you'd expect the interior to be the same. But the interior of the house, the interior of the house held three sick people. The walls stained with their crimes against an innocent child.
The image of Malfoy flooded back through Harry's mind. Had his hair always had golden strands scattered throughout? Had his skin always looked so smooth? Harry tried to remember what they looked like before, had they always been such a stunning shade of silver with bright blue flecks? Had his lashes always been so long and thick? Had Malfoy always looked this pretty?
"We're both going mad in here. There is nothing to do, we can't go outside or anything." Harry said.
"Everything, I suppose. Rescuing me back there, accepting me, still being as hot as you were five years ago." Draco smirked.
. It was played so gently, so beautifully. Harry found the room that the piano was located and gently pushed open the door. Harry crept into the room so he didn't disturb the player. He looked up and to his surprise, sat at the piano in the middle of the room was Draco Malfoy. The boy he had been secretly dating for the last couple of months.
With that, Harry took his face out of the fire and saw Draco trying to drag a smallish box across the floor.
"We could go for a walk around the lake. We haven't been outside for like three days now." Draco said.
Draco opened the box to reveal Boo. "Aw, Draco that's adorable. Just remember, find me if you need me."
Draco was taken aback by this. He knew this conversation would happen but not so soon. Though, as he though about it, he was surprised this conversation hadn't happened sooner, he was a healer himself, the head healer, and he knew nothing was helping Harry.
Harry gave Draco a fond look before turning his head towards the television. Despite what most people think, Draco wasn't a huge fan of extravagant and big dates. They much preferred dates like this, curled up on the sofa with greasy take out food and watching a movie that was simultaneously awful yet brilliant.
Draco didn't even know how long it had been until the screams had stopped. He wanted to scream but he couldn't, he couldn't physically produce the breath to scream anymore. Draco was silent but the tears still streamed down his face and his body still shook with every silent sob that ripped through Draco's body.
"Well, I was just walking around town and I saw you and uh, wanted to say hi?" The last part sounding more like a question.
Draco could only smirk as Potter ran out of the changing room, he had Harry exactly where he wanted him.
Draco ran his fingers gently along the counters as he walked down the aisles, in awe of the sheer amount of makeup there was. He did a full lap of the shop before going around again to pick up the stuff he wanted.
Because he didn't feel like socialising, that's it. Harry had asked him to go several times but Draco had said no and made up some lame excuse that he had to work in the morning.
Draco looked at Harry to look for signs that he was joking and upon realising that Harry was completely serious, burst out into laughter. Harry struggled not to laugh with Draco because their laughter was so infectious.
Harry looked into the beautiful storm grey eyes and slowly leaned in. Everything about the kiss was perfect, it was full of love.
Photos. There were so many photos everywhere, on the floor, on the walls, on the furniture. Pictures of peoples faces and different locations were scattered everywhere but the one that stood out most to Draco was the photo that was stuck in the centre of the wall. It was the one that Draco couldn't stand to look at, he had to cover it with a piece of paper most days. Harry's face.
"Because Harry, it's winter and we're in Scotland. It's like minus ten degrees outside." Draco replied, as if it was obvious which it was to be fair.
"Yes. Yes I will because Draco Lucius Malfoy, I've also grown attached and I never want to leave you because I also love you like a lot a lot."
True, the meeting was difficult to sit through but it wasn't why Draco was on the verge of breaking down. The meeting was a small inconvenience that weighed him down slightly compared to the real reason why Draco really wanted today to be over with.
Draco poured his coffee into the mug and retreated to the bedroom. He sat down on the end of the bed and just looked at everything. There was so much. Countless hours of work lay in front of Draco, almost mocking him because he still hadn't been able to find Harry.
Harry shot him a confused look and mouthed the words 'why are you so happy'. Draco just smirked and winked at him before sitting down to eat breakfast. Draco kept one hand in his pocket, holding the tubes of eyeliner and lipstick in his hand. He couldn't wait until he could stash more makeup in his pockets.
Draco and Harry were both ill. Very ill. They had contacted a bug that at first made them vomit their guts out, then have extreme pain in their stomachs, then pounding headaches, then more vomit, now a really bad cold. They were both coughing, sneezing and unable to breath out of their noses. Madame Pomfery had them in quarantine for for the most of it but it seemed like they were getting better so she let them into the 8th years common room. She had put a charm on it so everyone else could leave but them. All the students stayed away from them anyway so there wasn't much point in going back to the common room.
Draco tried to see what Seamus was pointing at but all he could see was empty fields and a slight smudge of grey. He also tried to remember what Seamus was shouting, but he just couldn't. It could've been anything, it could've been about a tree for all Draco knew.
The boys met up with Hermione and Hannah Abbott. Harry watched as Hermione blushed as Ron took her arm and as Neville pressed a small kiss on Hannah's cheek. He smiled when he saw Dean and Seamus look at each other shyly before taking each other's hand. Harry couldn't help but feel happy for all of his friends as he saw lovesick grins spread across all of their faces.
Lights were strung around the room and spiralled around a beautifully decorated tree in the corner of the room. Baubles were hung around the room and the ceiling was bewitched to look like it was snowing. There was a fire crackling to warm the room up with full stockings hanging over it and Draco stood by the table with a mug of hot chocolate.
Hermione wrapped her arms around Draco. "It's going to be okay." She whispers in his ear. "It's going to be okay."
Everyone else lifted up their head to look at Harry. He thumped his hand against that table before grabbing his neck. He was starting to turn blue.
He looked back up at the mirror again and came to a sudden realisation in the middle of his freak out. Draco wouldn't care what he looked like. Well, maybe slightly, but not enough to pick apart Harry's outfit. Harry cocked his head slightly, he looked... actually kind of good. He was wearing a white t-shirt that was tucked into some black jeans and he was wearing a red and black flannel over the top. There was really no reason for him to be freaking out.
Next he moved onto mascara. Draco couldn't help but imagine how much prettier his eyes would be framed by long, thick lashes. He scanned over the display, taking in all the different brushes and words used to describe the mascaras. Draco didn't know how so many words could be used to describe to mascara. His attention was caught by a silver tube. He picked it up and examined it, it was waterproof and extended your lashes apparently. Draco wasn't really sure how that worked but it sounded amazing. It also had a spiky brush, which Draco loved so he put it in his basket.
"Hey Draco, come with me a moment. I want you to see if out new bathroom tiles match our colour scheme." Hermione grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him upstairs into an empty room. "Are you okay?"
Draco grinned before he captured Harry's lips in his own. He would never get tired of this, the way Harry's lips fit perfectly with his, the way he still felt the fire at the bottom of his stomach and the way he still saw fireworks when the kissed. This was something Draco wouldn't trade for the world, because after all, he already had his world standing in front of him.
"I- um, just, wow." Harry breathed. He was taken aback at how gorgeous Malfoy looked, Harry began to wonder how he had never noticed this before. "You look really pretty."
After saying goodbye to Draco, Harry ran back to his apartment as fast as he could. He wasn't really sure what had just happened because the whole time, it had felt like he had ascended to heaven. He wasn't really sure why he was running away either, he enjoyed what just happened but also slightly scared because Harry made a mess of a lot of things in life but this was one thing that he could
Draco had so much to say yet nothing at all and it was confusing him. Draco had no idea what he was feeling right now, he just felt empty. He felt no emotion, no sadness or anger, he just felt lost within himself. Draco never knew it was possible to venture so far into your mind that you don't know if you're going to come out again.
Draco smiled at Harry before continuing to take him in the direction of the fitting rooms. They hadn't expected anything else from Harry but Draco always felt anxious when telling someone that they were non-binary or Belle was transgender. Belle had given Draco permission to tell people that she was transgender and she didn't really care about people's opinions which Draco respected massively as Draco always found themselves worrying about what other people thought.
"You locked him in a tiny cupboard for sixteen years. You beat him every single day. You cut him, you punched him, you kicked him, you knocked him unconscious, you scarred him. You raped and sexually abused him for no reason except for your own sadistic ways. You constantly told him he wasn't good enough, that no one would ever love him. You even convinced him that it was his own fault that his parents died. You caused his depression, his anxiety, his PTSD. You caused him to self-harm, you caused him to almost commit suicide because he was terrified to return to this house. He was scared he wasn't good enough, he was scared he was going to mess up, he was scared that every summer would be worse than the last. You caused him to have anorexia at one point. He couldn't eat in fear that you were going to make him throw it up again and tell him that he's not good enough to eat. You caused him to be terrified anytime he dropped something or messed up a spell or potion. Did you know he lived on the streets the summer he ran away because he was too scared that someone would take advantage of him or he'd be refused help? Harry still suffers today, he has nightmares, panic attacks, flashbacks. He still can't eat sometimes and he still self-harms sometimes. You physically and emotionally destroyed an innocent child and you're telling me that he deserves punishment? That he deserves to be kidnapped?" Draco yelled.
Harry's phone lit up with a notification as he was getting ready, revealing his lock screen - a picture of Draco smiling the warmest smile. Harry was captivated, whenever he saw their smile, he swore he saw colours from every end of the spectrum running around them. There was just something about the way Draco's lips curled upwards, the way butterflies seemed to escape from the pit of their stomach and the way the sun had somehow toppled down from the sky and made a home right there in their heart. A person smiles with more than their mouth, and Harry heard it in Draco's voice, in the choice of their words and the way their eyes screamed home.
The men didn't say anything, they just stood staring at each other, smiling. Both of them wondering how they managed to become so lucky. They stepped back into the tent when they heard their song playing; Ho Hey by The Lumineers. This was their song, both men knew all the words and had done for years.
Every time Draco cut out a circle, he passed it to Harry who placed it onto one of the holes in a cupcake tin. When all the spaces had been filled with pastry, Draco grabbed a small star cutter and cut out 12 stars to place on top of the mince pies. Harry and Draco filled the mince pies with the mincemeat and then placed the little stars on top.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him up off the stool. He threw the invisibility cloak over them both and they slowly walked back to the Gryffindor common room. They stopped outside a window on the way to admire how beautiful the Black Lake looked in the moonlight. The light of the moon reflected in the water, beautifully distorted.  They crept silently back to Harry's dorm and into bed.
When Harry had finished, he finally felt like his and Draco's house was perfect. Everything was perfect. Harry knew that this was going to be one of the best Christmases ever.
"Hm, just try to concentrate on the potion a bit more. Clean your cauldron and start again. I trust you won't make a mistake again." Slughorn said.
"I'll see what I can do." The receptionist looked on her computer at the moment. "You've come at the perfect time. There is around 20 minutes before the next appointment is due. If you walk through the door, you should find the vet."
"You, uh, you started scratching your chest and said you couldn't take it anymore and you wanted it to stop." Hermione explained, her voice shaking.
Draco sat up and slid the bracelet back onto his wrist. He stumbled to the door and opened it to reveal a very worried looking Hermione.
Harry pushed both the sleeves of his flannel up, revealing a tattoo on each of the inside of his wrists. One of the was a magical tattoo of the moon, changing depending on what phase it was on, and the other held the Canis Major constellation, the Sirius star being the largest.
Harry and Draco were next to go to their room, they each hugged Pansy and Blaise before walking to their bedroom, Draco's arm over Harry's shoulder. Harry jumped into the bed and curled up in the covers. The bed sank a little as Draco got in and Harry waited for the familiar warmth of Draco's body next to his.
Draco smiled when they saw a sign in the shop window saying that a new collection had come in. Draco quickly walked into the shop, desperate to see the new clothes. And buy all of it too. They quickly glanced around the men's section to see if anything piqued their interest, but as usual, nothing did so they headed over to the female section.
"I'm gonna go aswell." Ron gave everyone a quick hug. "Don't be surprised of I wake you in the morning."
The box contained a necklace with two charms. One was a beautifully crafted Narcissus flower with a yellow diamond and the other was a rectangle with soft corner, it was engraved with
"I'm joking. You always look beautiful, love." Harry murmured right next to Draco's ear, causing the tips of their ears to go pink.
Harry usually didn't enjoy wearing suits, nor the events that called upon wearing a suit. He found the whole affair to be uncomfortable if he was being perfectly honest. He didn't like the stiff, starchy shirts that made him stand up right for the entirety of the time wearing it. He didn't like the slacks that were always either too big or too tight on him. He didn't like the hot heaviness of the blazer and he didn't like the feeling of a tie or bow tie around his neck.
Draco clicked the call button and lifted the phone to his ear. He couldn't help but raise his hopes at each dial, hoping maybe this would be that last one and he'd hear a voice. Draco felt his heart sink when the prerecorded message came one.
Harry stared at Draco, impressed at how much they had changed. They seemed so much more relaxed and confident now. Draco had always been reserved and quiet when the two went to school together and it was nice seeing Draco out of their shell, flourishing in clothing that was stereotypically seen as women's clothing.
Seamus owned this warehouse in Manchester that he mainly used for storage. Draco wasn't sure if he'd inherited it or bought it but it was the perfect place to hide someone.
Well, Draco let them catch up to him. He knew that he needed his friends right now, he didn't trust himself to be alone with his thoughts. Especially not today. He had managed to push away the importance of today, only knowing it would make him so upset but now it's all he could think about.
"Let's just go before I change my mind." Draco walked out of the room, leaving Harry to catch up. Draco was definitely not a morning person.
"I'm sorry." Harry whispered. He leant up and kissed Draco gently. Harry was about to pull away but Draco pulled him closer.
"I knew that, I was just uh... testing you?" Harry said, the last part sounding more like a question.
Harry lay on Draco's bed, he was bored but he knew the wait would be worth it. It had been about fifteen minutes before Harry heard Draco speak up.
"No, Draco it isn't. I've asked Ron and 'Mione and they're wearing Christmas jumpers. I'm wearing a Christmas jumper."
"You know how I was gonna do the thing tonight, I'm not sure anymore." Draco pulled out the box and started fiddling with it.
He would do it for them. Draco would do it for them. For Lily, James, Sirius and Remus. He needed to promise them that he would find Harry but in order to do that, he would need to go to Godric's Hollow. Draco couldn't help but feel hesitant about going, it felt wrong to go there for the first time without Harry. It felt like he was going to see a part of Harry's life that Harry maybe wasn't ready to reveal yet. But, then again, Draco felt like he needed to go, like it was the right time to go.
"I have no idea..." Draco trailed off when he saw what had caused Harry to choke lying on the floor.
The silent thought that occurred every day inside Draco's mind. Draco wouldn't help but feel as if it was a somewhat empty promise, they'd checked three places on Draco's list and they still hadn't found Harry and did it even class as a promise if he didn't actually say it out loud? And who was he promising it to? Himself, yes, but other than that there was no-one.
"Mr.Shacklebolt, it's Harry, he's..." Draco couldn't bring himself to say it again. He knew he would break down.
Draco honestly preferred the silence, he liked it when people didn't talk sometimes. This was a situation where everyone walked on eggshells, scared that they were going to say something wrong or something insensitive. No one wanted to be the person who said the wrong thing, especially at a time like this. In the end, it was Neville who broke the silence.
"Ready." Draco stepped out of the bathroom wearing about 10 layers of clothes, his hat, scarf and two pairs of gloves.
Harry didn't say anything as he got out his wand and flicked it. Soft music began to fill up the air and Harry held out his hand.
Harry laughed to himself as he set down his phone and turned back to the show he and Ron were watching. Ron glanced at him from the side and fake gagged.
Harry got up and headed to the library. He knew Draco would be there, he was always there. At the start of their 8th year, Harry and Draco started dating. After years of hiding their feelings and forcing themselves to be enemies, they finally revealed how they felt towards each other. They had been practically inseparable ever since.
"We won't stop searching and the case will be open until we find him but the searches are going to be less frequent. The reason for this is that no new leads have come up and we don't know exactly where to search next. Harry could easily be in a different country but we can't start searching abroad until we have evidence that he is in another country or he has been taken out of this country." Kingsley said. He wasn't meeting anyone's eyes, as if he was scared to see betrayal in their eyes.
"One more question." Harry took a deep breath. His heart was pounding, Harry didn't think he'd ever been more nervous in his life. "Would you like to go as my boyfriend?"
They hadn't had a dream like that for months. Draco had forgotten just how terrifying and damaging they could be. Spirals of doubt began to form in Draco's mind as they shakily filled a glass with water.
Harry remembered exactly how it felt when it happened. It felt like he had literally ascended to heaven. What Harry would give for that to happen all over again, but this time, he would turn his head so Malfoy presses his red lips to Harry's lips.
They stepped into the fitting room, taking another glance at Harry before shutting the curtain and placing their head in their hands. Draco resisted the urge to squeal and they looked up at the mirror. They were smiling like an idiot and a gentle pink colour was dusted across their cheeks.
"A couple of nights ago, Harry Potter went missing. We believe he's been kidnapped but yet have the evidence to prove so. I know this may be hard to take in but do any of you have any ideas where he might be or who might have taken him?" A police officer asked.
Harry watched as Draco lightly ran his fingers across the flowers, tracing a few. Their eyes softened as their fingers traced a large narcissus flowers that stood slightly brighter against Draco's skin than the rest of the flowers.
Their eyes... don't even get Harry started on Draco's eyes. Harry had held the belief that Draco's eyes were simply grey or silver for a long time but any traces of that belief were wiped out when Harry had taken a true look into Draco's eyes. Spirals of metallic grey collided with ocean blue droplets and faded out into the lightest blue at the edge of their irises. Their eyes weren't grey, that had simply been Harry's terrible judgment. Their eyes were breath-taking.
Slytherin has a christmas tradition. And that tradition started when Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson came to Hogwarts. Only the Slytherins knew about their tradition and Draco and Pansy made all the Slytherins swear secrecy and they make all the new first years swear secrecy. If word got out about what went on in the Slytherin dorms on the day the christmas holidays started every year, Draco wouldn't know what to do. Pansy probably wouldn't care but Draco would, Draco would care massively.
Draco detached themselves from Harry and took a cookie. "At least you didn't burn the kitchen down."
Draco chuckled lightly as Harry's awkwardness and Harry shot them a cheesy grin back in response. Draco's heart fluttered and almost hurt at the sight. It was so adorable. Draco never thought that they would use that word to describe Harry but that was completely demolished when Draco saw the slight crinkles as Harry's eyes and small dimples in his cheeks.
Harry had been in this coma for three months. He was on a mission, a very dangerous one. Probably the most dangerous since Voldemort. He was so close, Draco and been told, so close to finishing it. So close to coming home. But he didn't quite make it, he got hit with an unknown curse. That unknown curse sent him into a coma. A coma that he was very unlikely to wake up from. The healers had tried everything, they were trying new techniques, they were using everything they had but nothing, fucking nothing was working. Harry was being held on life support, each day he was getting weaker, slipping further away from life. And Draco could do nothing about it. Fucking nothing. It was killing him.
It also calmed himself when he did this. It reminded Draco that he had the love of his life next to him and he was always at home when he was with Harry.
Harry heard Ron say something about waiting around the corner for them but he didn't pay attention as he was too caught up in the way a light pink colour was settling over Draco's cheeks. Harry took a step closer to Draco and lifted his hand and placed it against the side of the face, gently running his thumb down the side if their face. Draco leaned into the touch and a small, content sigh escaped their lips. It was a small gesture but it said everything that needed to be said in that moment.
"Draco, look at me." Hermione said. "You can do this. I'm going to be with you throughout the whole process, okay."
It was also so incredibly frustrating because Draco knew what they wanted, they just didn't know how to get it. All they wanted was to be seen as a person, not a boy and not a girl. Draco had briefly wondered if they were transgender but they were happy in the body that they were in, they just really hated being called a boy.
"Ron, that's a little bit of a stupid suggestion. Our friends wouldn't kidnap Harry." Hermione said.
Draco and Hermione looked at each other. Yes, Harry did have relatives. An aunt, an uncle and a cousin who abused him his whole childhood.
"Fine. Yes I'm wearing Christmas socks, but only because I didn't have any other socks to wear." Draco admitted.
"Don't speak to me." Harry walked off to the kitchen and made himself a cup of coffee. After he had taken a sip, Draco attempted to talk to him again.
Malfoy hadn't said anything all day, only shooting Harry smirks and winks. It was almost worse than the little insults thrown around because at least Harry remembered to be a functional human being when insults were being thrown at him. Harry needed to do something because he couldn't focus on anything without Malfoy invading his mind like the plague.
Draco made his way over to Pansy who was desperately motioning him to come over. He was still unsure about how they felt about everything, the makeup, him coming with Harry...
"Don't worry, I don't ever plan on hurting her. If I do, you have full permission to take me down." Pansy pressed a kiss to the top of Hermione's forehead, causing a light pink to rise up to Hermione's cheeks.
The tree looked stunning in their grey and white themed living room. Draco put the tree in a stand whilst Harry went upstairs to get the decorations. There was no tinsel, Draco hated tinsel. There was loads of white, silver and blue decorations and a few red and green decorations. They had an elegant silver star that would sit on top of the red and white lights to be wrapped around.
But it was going to be okay because Harry was here and Draco knew that Harry would protect them from anything. Draco heard steps walking towards them and they lifted their head, their vision slightly blurry from the tears.
Harry stumbled over his feet and felt a heat rise to his cheeks. He wasn't expecting that. When Draco complimented him, Harry was convinced his heart wanted to be a professional gymnast because there was no other explanation for why it was flipping so violently in his chest. Harry wasn't complaining though, the warmth that spread through him felt like it came from the light of a hundred suns. It was almost like Draco was his own personal sun, shining bright for everyone but shining particularly bright for Harry.
"No, Dray. It's so beautiful. I love spending time with you and going on walks by the beach. I just miss Christmas."
Draco placed his head in his hands, trying to hide the tears that were falling. Draco knew that Harry would be back in the mindset he had when they were teenagers and Draco just wanted to scream. The progress Harry had made would all be gone and he'd become a hollow, broken shell of a human being again. Draco knew Harry's PTSD and anxiety would be so much worse and he knew that he'd see Harry in pain every day.
Harry held his hand out and helped Draco up onto the slightly raised platform. Harry couldn't even describe what they looked like in that moment. Maybe like an angel but even an angel didn't stand a chance next to Draco's pure beauty and radiance.
Harry woke the next morning, to the sun shining through the window. He got up immediately and threw back the curtains. There, across the hills was a thick, blanket. Harry checked the time, it was 8. He decided that Draco had had enough of his beauty sleep and could be woke up now. Harry quickly got changed and threw on as many layers as he could find. He wrapped his Gryffindor scarf around his neck and shoved his hat and gloves into his pocket. He sprinted all the way down to the Slytherin dorms. He said the password and ran up to Draco's room. Draco being Draco, of course had his own room. Harry unlocked the door and went into the room.
Harry pulled Draco in for a hug. They stayed like that for a while, enjoying each other's presence. Harry broke away slightly and looked at Draco. Harry flicked his wand and mistletoe started to grow above them. Draco smiled at Harry before slowly leaning in. Their first kiss. It was full of love and Harry fell more in love with Draco.
Draco sometimes wondered how such a damaged person could light up a room so easily, but then he remembered it was Harry. Harry who could do anything and everything. It was sometimes scary to remember what Harry had been through, Draco couldn't even begin to imagine the pain Harry felt. Harry's anxiety and PTSD were still severe and he suffered with nightmares, flashbacks and panic attacks, but he was getting better. Harry had made so much progress over the last few years and Draco was so proud of him. But this, this would just take back every bit of progress Harry had made and this made Draco's heart break. Knowing Harry might be back where he was when they first started dating killed Draco. Harry deserved nothing but happiness.
"Right, so you are gonna start like this and then move your arm across your body whilst straightening and bending your knee." Draco demonstrated the start of the dance.
Draco smirked as he noticed how flushed Potter was. There was a pink dusting over his cheeks and he couldn't seem to get a sentence out for the life of him. A different flush ran through Draco's body as he realised exactly what was happening.
Draco drove to the supermarket and he and Harry grabbed some pre-made pastry and two jars of mincemeat. Harry paid for everything and they drove back home. Harry grabbed a tin and switched on the oven. He got some milk out of the fridge and some sugar out if a cupboard. He placed them down next to where Draco was rolling out the pastry.
"Not another word, Potter." Draco glared at Harry but there was no harshness behind it. "What about you? Do you have any?"
"It's so fucking frustrating because you would've though by now that something would've come up. Just something but we've got nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing." Draco ran his hands through his hair.
Then there was eyeshadow. Draco wasn't too sure about eyeshadow, he wasn't sure if he needed it on top of eyeliner and mascara and it all seemed a bit too colourful anyway. Every palette had some sort of colour on it and Draco didn't see the point in buying it if he wasn't going to use the colour. He was about to move on until he saw a palette in the corner of the display consisting only of whites, greys and blacks. Draco pictured himself using the palette to create a smoky eye look and immediately put the palette in the basket.
"It's got a nice blue hue, rarely sheds needles, stiff branches which are good for holding ornaments and they are a perfect pyramid shape. Also, the needle are quite sharp which should keep Belle away."
Harry was dressed in a traditional tuxedo. Jet black with a crisp white shirt. The blazer and trousers tailored to fit perfectly. A single white lily was gently sitting in the breast pocket of Harry's blazer. Harry wanted lilys as the flowers for the wedding and Draco agreed. Hermione and Ginny had been trying for the last half an hour to get Harry's hair to do something but they were failing. Miserably. His messy curls refused to be flattened or styled in any way. Eventually, the two girls gave up. The did some finishing touches and stepped back to admire Harry.
It felt free being able to stand there amongst the mass of warm bodies. After years of denial, self-hatred and attempts to make himself 'normal', it finally felt comfortable to stand between the men and women that were all here for the same reasons as he was. It felt right.
make a mess of. Harry ran all the way to the door of his apartment where he immediately shut the door and sunk into the floor.
Harry had a day off from work. He was an auror and had just come out of a pretty major case that required him to be away from home for three days. He was lounging around on the sofa, whilst Draco was getting ready to go to work. Draco was the head healer at St. Mungo's and didn't usually have days off from work. Harry was just about to get up to say goodbye to Draco when he noticed something. Harry looked a little closer and sure enough, Harry's suspicions were confirmed.
It was going to be hard, but they were going to get through this. Draco knew it would take time but he was going to make sure that Harry felt safe and happy and he was going to make sure that Harry knew he was loved so much. He was going to help and support Harry through this.
"I'm going to try this on and you're going to be-," Draco cut themselves off when they saw a nice pair of shoes to match the outfit. "Ooh, shoes." Draco picked up a pair in their size and carried on towards the fitting rooms. "And you're going to be my judge."
All of these things were toxic but perhaps the most toxic thing was when Draco was left with his own thoughts. Often, he would just sit and think. He would think about the memories he had with Harry. He would think about the what ifs. What if Harry never came back? What if Draco had to hold a funeral? He also thought about the party. If he just went to that goddamn party, maybe Harry wouldn't be missing. He didn't go to the party so it was his fault, right? At least that's what Draco managed to convince himself. That it was all his fault Harry was missing. He also just thought about Harry. Just Harry. His messy hair that Draco secretly adored, his torso that was defined by muscle from doing endless hours of quidditch, his emerald eyes that Draco got lost in so often, his scars that he hated but Draco loved because they made Harry Harry, his glasses that were more modern but still had the circular shape, his everything. God, what Draco would give to have Harry back home, back in his arms.
The grin that broke out across his face was something Harry couldn't contain as he grabbed Draco's hand and walked around the corner, finding Ron leant up against the wall scrolling through his phone. Ron glanced up at the pair and said a quick hello to Draco before the three set off to Hermione's apartment.
One of Harry's favourite coffee shops was Starbucks. Yes, it was overpriced, yes, it was always busy, yes, it was so basic but he loved it. Harry had taken Draco into a Starbucks once but it didn't go very well. It was discovered that day that Draco hated coffee. And when I say hated, I mean hated.
The other day, Draco had become so frustrated that he threw a plate and the scary thing about it was that he didn't even realise what he'd done until the plate was in pieces on the kitchen floor. He'd tried to clean in up but ended up cutting his hand and he had to call Hermione to help him. Hermione had managed to calm him down but soon after she left, the frustration and confusion were back.
He knew talking to someone would help but he couldn't bring himself to call or text anyone. He'd cut off all contact with everyone, including Ron and Hermione, a few days ago. He could hear his phone buzzing all the time but remained away from it. Cutting everyone off probably wasn't the best decision, his contact with others was what kept him sane and what prevented him from having showers and eating cereal at three in the morning.
His dress robes were black like Harry's but whenever the light hit Draco, you could see a silver sheen. But, even behind all of this, you could see Draco's true beauty because it wasn't his makeup or his clothes Harry was drawn to, it was his eyes. Harry had always labeled them 'grey' and if he was feeling particularly poetic, he called them 'silver' but neither word did them justice. They were so solid, so bright, the exact lustrous color of a polished shard of metal. If you looked closer, like he was just now, you'd see the swirls of glittering ocean blue and tinges of light blue at the edges. They weren't monochrome with a slight bit of blue, that had simply been Harry's terrible judgement. They were beautiful.
It had been a long road to get where he was today. Harry had always supported and accepted the LGBTQ+ community and most of his friends were a part of it but accepting himself was much harder than he expected. It was only when he finally sat down with all of his friends and talked about his confusion and doubt and fear did he really accept the fact that he was bisexual, leaning towards men.
Harry burst into a fresh set of laughter. Draco sat watching him for 5 minutes with a very unamused look on his face before he got up and decided to leave. He would just have to perform a solo, it wouldn't be the same but at least it'd be something. He was just about to open the door before a voice stopped him.
It was the night of the ball and to say Harry was freaking out was an understatement. He hadn't been able to eat breakfast or dinner because with all the butterflies in his stomach and his head buzzing, there was no way on Earth he'd swallow a bite, yet alone a whole plate.
As Draco got ready, they couldn't help but make themselves look extra nice on the off chance they would run into Harry. They made sure their clothes had no creases and that their eyeliner was even. Draco gave themselves a once over in the mirror and felt satisfied with how they looked, the blue flares made their ass look good and the soft lavender hoodie made them look cute and approachable. Perfect.
Harry nodded and looked down at the floor. Draco swore they saw the tips of Harry's ears to pink. Draco's mouth twisted up into its famous smirk as an idea hit them. They grabbed Harry's hand, ignoring the way their stomach jumped as the pairs hands slotted together, and dragged him towards the fitting rooms.
Harry and Draco had agreed to keep both their relationship and the fact they were going to the ball together a secret. Both Harry and Draco felt they needed a little more time to themselves so they could become more comfortable in their relationship without anyone butting in.
Also, the more Harry thought about it, the more he realised how different Malfoy made him feel from his other crushes. Harry had felt butterflies in his stomach and he got nervous to talk to them with his previous crushes. But Malfoy, Malfoy was a whole other story. Harry was convinced there was an army of butterflies in his stomach performing circus tricks and he became so flustered that he could barely speak english. Harry also really wanted to kiss Malfoy, and he wanted Malfoy to kiss him. He wanted Malfoy to leave his mark on his lips and neck and chest and thighs...
"Okay, this won't take long. Before I say this, I just want you to know that I'm not trying to be inconsiderate because I know what you're going through must be really hard and I haven't made this decision lightly but I can give you three weeks before I need you to return to work."
Draco hung up the phone before Hermione could say anything else. Draco knew she was going to say "Everything's going to be okay" but she didn't know that so Draco didn't want to hear it. Draco ran back to the bedroom and threw on some clothes as quickly as possible. He ran out of the flat and hailed at taxi.
"They have special cups for Christmas, it's kinda their thing." Harry whispered back. "Do you wanna sit in or takeaway?"
"An advent calendar is basically a calendar that either goes on for 12, 24 or 25 days. The ones that go on for 12 days are shit. It has doors that you open from the first of December to either the twelfth, 24th or 25th. Behind each door, you get a different gift. You can get different advent calendars that have different things, so some have lego, some have chocolate, some have make-up and beauty things, some have pictures and there's a lot more." Harry explained.
Draco pressed a gentle kiss to Harry's lips. Harry and Draco got ready to go out and get a tree. Draco drove to the shop and the two went outside to find a tree. There was all kinds of tree but Draco seemed to know his stuff.
Harry's cheeks flushed red and he hummed absentmindedly, pretending to not have heard Ron. Harry could almost feel the look of suspicion Ron was giving him right now. Harry looked everywhere around the room except at Ron.
"No, Miss Weasley, I'm not saying that. We will never lose hope but what you need to understand is that it's very difficult to continue with this investigation with no leads."
As the words swirled into the air, a shooting star flew across the sky. Draco could feel a lump begin to form in his throat as he silently wished for the same thing over and over again.
"Well, in that case. It would be best to make an appointment for a few weeks time so we can give him all the necessary vaccines and have him neutered and micro-chipped if you wish." The vet went over to her computer. "I have an appointment for the 6th of January at 6pm if that's okay for you."
"Draco, it still could've happened. You wouldn't have been with him all night. Look at me." Draco flicked his eyes over to Hermione. "None of this is your fault, okay. None of this is your fault."
Narcissa stood up and walked to the drawing room with Draco following closely behind. When Draco stepped into the drawing room, he saw a box that was nearly as tall as him, wrapped in a christmas tree wrapping paper. There was a hole on the right side of the box, which Draco assumed was to open it.
Draco almost squealed in excitement. He couldn't wait to use the lipstick, he couldn't wait to see what he'd look like with both eyeliner and lipstick on. Draco stood up, not able to wait any longer. He placed the package next to the tube of eyeliner in his pocket. He always carried around his eyeliner now, deciding it was too risky to leave it in his bedside drawer.
"You alright mate, you look a bit pale." The taxi driver said as Draco entered the car. Jesus Christ, now was not the time for a conversation.
Draco felt an all too familiar lump rise in his throat. He didn't even try to push it away because he knew that it wouldn't. Draco sunk lower in his seat, hoping no one would notice his blurry eyes or the shaking of his hands. Draco shut his eyes, trying to calm himself down. He didn't want everyone to see him breaking.
"Do you have them with you?" Harry asked. The question was so vague yet Harry was sure Malfoy knew exactly what he meant.
"I want to get there before it gets too busy. I don't want other people's sweaty bodies pressed against me." Draco said. What he said was true, he just didn't mention the fact that he was also in a rush because he was desperate to try out some new makeup.
Everything came hurtling at him at full speed as a wave of realisation washed over him. They had been friends since they were eleven and Seamus had always, without fail, been by Harry's side.
"I love you too. More than you could ever imagine." Harry whispered, taking Draco's hands and pressing a kiss against their knuckles before lowering them down to their waists.
They still hadn't found Harry. They had checked all the places on Draco's list and more but there was still no sign of him and that terrified Draco. Draco really didn't want to go to this meeting, he really didn't have to want to face reality. Everything about this was Draco not wanting to face reality but it coming and punching Draco in the stomach anyway.
Harry had been asking for a dog since forever. Draco had always refused as he didn't want a dog to ruin their house but Harry kept asking and Draco was starting to cave. He still refused when Harry asked, but he was finding it harder now. Maybe a dog wouldn't be so bad. It could keep them company. Not to mention, dogs were super cute.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked, looking at Draco as if they were the entire world. Just looking at him almost made Draco break.
"Right." Kingsley scanned over the room again, double checking everyone else was here before carrying on. "This is a meeting I didn't want to have to hold and before I carry on, I just want you to know that we're not giving up and there is still hope."
The coat was old and worn but Harry loved it, he wore it almost everywhere (because he looked great in it). Draco usually wouldn't be caught dead wearing a coat like this but right now, he felt more affection towards the coat than he had ever before. It was warm and snug, almost like a hug from Harry.
"No, sir. Harry suffers from severe anxiety, depression and PTSD and he's not one to just walk off, even when drunk. He only ever sleep at our flat or Hermione's flat." Draco said.
Draco knew enough time had passed for someone to be able to take Harry to Scotland where Hogwarts was. There was so many places in and around Hogwarts Harry could be. The shrieking shack, the forbidden forest, the room of requirement.
tw: strong language, physical abuse, rape. this chapter is very dark, so please don't read it if you don't feel safe doing so.
That's what it felt like. Inside the club it was like dancing on the Northern Lights; beneath the dry-ice smoke swirled an array of ocean blues, acid greens, hot pinks and blinding gold. The alternative music played over the dance floor as if had fused with the bodies, controlling the movements, giving everyone what they so desperately craved, the feeling of elation, to feel the bond that was denied in the coldness of the streets outside. Bottles, glasses, pills, money. Every surface was covered in something but it felt right. The cool, light atmosphere of the club gave a new source of life. It felt free.
"Look, Harry. I just want to say that I'm so proud and happy for you. Merlin, I think I admire you more than I already did after that because that must've taken some real courage. There's no way I would've announced my relationship with Dean that way. I'll always be here to support you, you know that and I'll always be here if you need someone to talk to about anything." Seamus said, smiling up at Harry.
Harry opened the box carefully and gasped when he saw what was inside. He gently took Bud out of the box and cradled him. "You got a puppy?" Harry asked, almost crying.
"Oh, I see." Harry said. "That must've taken her a lot of courage. Uh, next time you see her, can you tell her that I'm happy that she can live her life as she wants to?"
"Shut up." Draco scowled. "I was just making sure I was getting the best makeup for mother and is it a crime to be happy because last time I checked, it wasn't."
Harry laughed quietly to himself before resting his head against his hand and staring up at Draco. Harry looked at Draco as if they were something else. He looked at Draco as if they were the sun, the centre of the solar system that everything else revolved around because they are so important and special. His eyes were the same too. There is a kind of green that comes only around springtime with fresh blades of grass and new flower buds, Harry's eyes were that bright colour, fresh and comforting.
"Thank you guys. It means a lot that you support me." Harry pulled them into a group hug. "Now, if you don't mind, I shall be going to find my beautiful date."
"Yes." Harry said. What he said didn't make much sense but Harry was sure Draco knew exactly what he was saying.
Draco decided that instead of wallowing in self-pity and embarrassment, they would go out shopping. They had been meaning to pick up some new clothes and they had nothing better to do with their time so Draco got up and mentally slapped himself before getting ready.
"The slimy git didn't tell me anything. I cannot believe you two have the audacity to stand in my presence and not tell me who 'Mione is seeing." Ron said dramatically as he folded his arms.
Harry landed one final kiss on Draco's lips before walking over to where Seamus, Dean, Ginny and Luna were sat and laid out his own blanket. Everyone gathered round and sat in a big circle and helped themselves to all the food that was piled in the middle.
"How big of a problem are we talking? Did you kill someone?" Ron glanced at Harry. "Oh bloody hell, you killed someone, didn't you? It's okay, it'll be fine. We'll hide the body, we'll get 'Mione to help, no one has to know."
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine and crossed his arms to try and stay warm. It wouldn't work, of course, it was like three degrees outside but Draco just didn't want to go back inside. He didn't want to look at the flat because everything just reminded him of Harry. Draco had slept at Ron and Hermione's a couple of times because it was just too painful to be inside his own home.
Draco followed Harry into their bedroom and got Harry's pyjamas and a fluffy sweater out of their wardrobe and chucked them to Harry.
Draco already had a basic idea of what he wanted. He wanted a highlighter, mascara, another lipstick (he wasn't sure what colour yet) and possibly some eyeshadow. He didn't want any foundation or concealer because he didn't fancy having a thick layer of liquid covering his skin and they probably didn't make a shade pale enough for him.
Draco sighed before stepping into the fireplace and flooing to the ministry. He had to go to this meeting whether he wanted to or not. Draco stepped out and walked down the busy corridors of the ministry, the crowd naturally parting to let him through. Despite his past, Draco was well respected within the magical community, managing to build a new reputation after becoming one of the best healers in the world.
The taxi driver nodded and drove off. Draco couldn't help but think of the worst. As much as he tried to push those thoughts to the back of his mind, he couldn't. What was he supposed to do in this situation? Draco's head was spinning, he couldn't seem to rationalise anything. Draco was tapping his fingers against the door of the car, trying to distract himself.
"Perfect, let's go over it again one last time." Hermione said. "So, I'm we are going to set up the mistletoe just before the lesson and make sure no one goes under it. Once we leave, I'll be walking with Harry and you'll be walking with Draco. Then we'll both push them under the mistletoe and they can't leave until they kiss."
"You're part of the family now, mate. We can see how much you love Harry and that you two are gonna be together forever. Also, you became my brother and everyone's brother over the summer. We all love you." Ron said softly.
"You will actually be the reason I go insane." Ron muttered as he got up and stood behind Harry. "Please enlighten me, dearest Harry, on what is not perfect because I sure as shit can't see anything."
"It's so simple Harry! I literally cannot understand how you are not getting this, you just need to step to the side! Pansy would have this whole dance nailed down in five bloody minutes but I've been here with you for 3 hours trying to teach you how to to a step-ball-change! I do not understand how you can't do it! Merlin, this is the most frustrating thing I have ever had to do!" Draco ranted. He placed his middle and pointer finger in both hands onto his temples.
"Aw, look she's scared of the tree." Harry looked towards Belle who was hiding behind a pile of Harry's shoes. Draco's shoes were neatly lined up, of course.
Draco loved all of his friends and they had all been really supportive and helpful through this entire hellish nightmare. Well, he says all but he hasn't heard from Seamus in quite a while. Actually, he wasn't sure if anyone had. He was always coming up with some excuse as to why he couldn't come to any meetings or hang out with anyone.
Draco placed a kiss on Harry's cheek. The two spent the rest of the bus journey talking about how Harry really wanted a kitten. After about 20 minutes, they reached their stop and got off the bus. Thankfully, the bus stop was right outside a big shopping centre. Harry and Draco walked in and were greeted by a blast of warm air, which both men were thankful for.
Draco pulled Harry into a hug. Draco gently flicked his wand and some beautiful classical music began to play softly through the air.
"For the millionth time, yes, you look fine." Ron said, his voice holding an exasperated tone. "Better than fine actually, great. You look great."
They both got out of their clothes and jumped into bed in just their underwear. Their foreheads were touching and they were gazing into each other's eyes, wondering how they each managed to become so lucky. They both fell asleep entwined in each other's arms. Harry woke up a few hours later to the winter sun streaming through the window. He remembered how amazing last night was, he had finally found the mystery piano player, lucky for him, it was his boyfriend so he could hear it anytime he wanted. Draco woke up a few minutes later, revealing those beautiful storm, grey eyes.
Not real, not real, not real, not real, Draco repeated in their head over and over as they waited for the tightness in their chest to loosen. Their heart was still hammering in their chest as they reminded themselves that they were safe, they weren't back at Malfoy Manor, Lucius was in Azkaban and they weren't drowning
Draco walked through the gates into a park. He almost instantly heard the joyous laughter of children. Draco smiled lightly at the sound. It was surprise to most people when they found out Draco liked kids, he loved the way they were so happy and care-free and how they were so innocent and naïve to the world around them. Draco remembered the time he and Harry had talked about having kids, they weren't too sure about names but they definitely wanted at least one boy and one girl.
Draco awoke with a sharp inhale, sitting up immediately and desperately sucking in oxygen, trying to calm themselves down. Sharp, vicious coughs wracked their frame and they curled over themselves, head between their knees and hand pressed against their mouth to try and muffle the coughs, not wanting to wake Harry.
"Oh my fucking god Pansy! How many fucking times do I have to tell you that I'm not fucking going with anyone to the goddamn fucking ball?" Draco yelled at Pansy.
Draco got into the ambulance and let out an involuntary gasp when he saw Harry. He was lying down in the bed with his shirt taken off. Over half of his torso was covered with bruises and his ribs were painfully obvious. Several cuts also littered his torso and all Draco wanted to do was kiss Harry and reassure him it was alright.
So Draco found himself in his dorm room, a mirror in front of him, attempting to put eyeliner on. His first attempt was dismal, both sides were uneven and the lines were very bumpy. He knew what it was supposed to look like, every line sharp and smooth, he'd seen Pansy apply and wear it enough times to know and Draco was determined to get it right. Malfoy's didn't settle for less than perfection. Draco sat there for hours applying and reapplying, perfecting the art of eyeliner. After what seemed like the hundredth attempt, Draco sat back and admired his reflection. Both sides of eyeliner were even, every line was straight and smooth, wings so sharp they could kill a man. The black liquid framed his eyes perfectly, the grey seeming more like a sliver and the blue flecks, normally very faint, now popped brightly, making his eyes even more stunning than they already were.
"Yes! Of course you should know about it. I can't believe you don't know about it. I thought wizards had them but apparently not."
He was glad a human wasn't the cause. Draco couldn't help but feel he had been around his friends to much recently, he felt like they were overcrowding him. Ever since they found out that he was going to propose, they had been checking up on him constantly and it was beginning to overwhelm Draco. He just needed some time to be alone, to collect his thoughts and to just take a moment to sit in his emotions and try to figure them out.
Draco's eyes widened and they sat bolt upright. They kissed Harry on he cheek. Holy shit, they had kissed Harry Potter on the cheek. And they didn't even get his number. Draco felt their cheeks go bright red and they groaned as they fell face first into the sofa.
Draco chuckled lightly. He watched as the rest of the room fill up. Everyone from their friendship group was here, except one and the Weasleys were also here. Draco looked around the room, trying to figure out who was missing before his attention was diverted by Kingsley Shacklebolt walking into the room.
"Do not let him outside or take him on walks when you take him home because he's not old enough yet and we don't want to expose him to anything nasty. Make sure you buy puppy food for him and when you go to sleep tonight, do not give in to his cry's because this is the only way for him to get used to time periods without you."
"Get you dressing gown and slippers on and come downstairs. I've made you your favourite breakfast."
Harry opened his mouth to protest but closed it promptly when he realised that Ron was right. He really did need to work on his social skills. Harry silently stood up and began to make his way towards his room.
Draco stopped in his tracks as he turned the corner, a small gasp escaping his mouth. Stood in front of him was the ruins of the Potter's house. Half of the house was still standing whilst the other half wasn't there at all. Draco couldn't help but feel overwhelmed at the sight, it was somewhat scary standing there.
Draco laughed gently before explaining. "They are made of ice crystals and water droplets. They usually mean continuous rain or snow and seeing as it's like minus five degrees outside, it's probably going to snow."
Harry rolled out of bed and put on his slippers and wrapped a blanket around himself. Draco got out of bed, surprisingly without any complaints, and put his slippers and dressing gown on. Draco grabbed Harry's hand as they walked out of the room and downstairs.
"This is the best way to get them to reveal their feeling for each other." Pansy gave Hermione a high five.
"I mean... probably." Harry said seriously. Draco was halfway to lowering the cookie when a playful smile broke out on Harry's face. "Kidding."
The day was finally here. Christmas Eve, oh and it was also Harry and Draco's wedding. Ever since they first got together, Harry and Draco had dreamt of having their wedding on Christmas Eve. They had been planning since they first got engaged. Everything had to be perfect, the newspapers were calling it the wedding of the century. Harry and Draco hardly thought it was 'the wedding of the century', they just saw it as two people vowing their eternal love for each other.
"It's okay. Just don't do it again." Draco returned Harry's hug. "To make sure you don't do it again, let's go out and buy some bloody tinsel."
Draco made sure the guy was gone before he leant against Seamus's door. He was so confused, where the fuck was Seamus?
Silence was the reply Draco got, so he got out of bed and headed out of their bedroom. Harry was probably making breakfast or watching TV. Draco could feel the worry build up in his chest, he tried to shake it away but it seemed to be lodged there.
Harry was starting to give up at this point. He didn't understand why Draco didn't want to embrace the festivity.
The atmosphere inside the police station was serious. Too serious. Everyone was quiet apart from protest coming from those who had been arrested. Draco looked around, his eyes landing on the board that held several missing people posters. Harry's face would be up there soon. Harry's face would be in newspapers soon. Harry's face would on the news soon. All reminding Draco that his world had disappeared.
But, despite having all of this, Draco couldn't help but feel like there was something he hadn't done, like there was something absent from his photo covered walls and his paper covered floor. It just seemed like he hadn't done enough.
"I'm not weird, am I?" Draco asked, their voice trembling. "For wearing feminine clothing, wearing makeup, painting my nails, and using they/them?"
There was no way he could ask his mother, she would never in a million years get lipstick for Draco but what if his mother would get it for someone else? And that's when it hit Draco, he would ask his mother to get lipstick for Pansy. Both of their parents thought they were dating but they weren't. Both Pansy and Draco were about as straight as a circle and it was just easier to pretend that they were going out than going out with someone they had no interest in whatsoever. It kept their parents happy and that's all they cared about.
Draco had taken Harry on holiday to Cancun for Christmas. It was always a dream of Draco's to spend Christmas in a hot country and Cancun was pretty hot in the winter. Harry had been a little off throughout the whole holiday. They had been to the beach together, gone shopping, romantic walks and meals but Draco knew something wasn't quite right. On Christmas Eve, Draco decided to ask Harry.
Draco ran into the kitchen and looked in the oven. "HARRY! HARRY! THEY'RE ON FIRE! HARRY! MERLIN! THEY'RE ON FIRE!"
"I still don't get why you don't trust me with the key." Ron complained as the two made their way out of the apartment building.
Draco stood there awkwardly, not really knowing what to do. Pansy was currently caressing his face. Normally, he would've shoved her hand away and told her to 'get the fuck off him' or something like that but right now, he was too confused to do anything.
Harry obeyed and continued playing the adverts. By the end of the 2015 advert, The Man on the Moon, Draco was practically sobbing.
Draco was sat on the sofa and he could feel the frustration slowly begin to build up as he kept going over things in his head, trying to spot just something that would help them but he couldn't find anything. Draco sighed before sitting up and counting to ten, this calmed him down as he focused on counting rather than everything else swimming around in his head. He finished counting and headed towards their bedroom, he just needed to sleep.
Even though Draco was tearing up at seeing Harry's face and seeing how happy he looked, every photo managed to make Draco smile. Draco could almost hear the photos and laughed to himself as he remembered the stories behind some of the pictures.
A few weeks after Seamus had been caught, Harry had come to Draco and told him he wanted to report the Dursley's for what they did to him. He told Draco that the only way he could make a full recovery is if the Dursley's were punished for what they did. Harry and Draco reported them together and they were all sent to prison, Vernon for child abuse, sexual assault and rape, Petunia and Dudley for child abuse.
Draco never wanted to end up on the doorstep of this house. He felt sick looking at the door, he couldn't look at it for more than a few seconds without having to tear his gaze away with pure disgust. Draco hadn't told the police why he refused to go to the house or why the Dursley's wouldn't care. The police hadn't managed to get Draco to tell why he refused to go and he never would, Draco had made a promise with Harry that he wouldn't tell the police about it. However, the police had somehow managed to get Draco to go and now he was there, he'd rather be anywhere else.
"Jesus fucking Christ! Fine! I'm going with someone but I'm not telling you who! Is that good enough for you? Are you happy now? Or am I going to have to endure more of your bitching and whining because if I do, please tell me so I can fucking avarda kedavra myself!" Draco exclaimed, placing his wand to his head to prove a point.
He looked towards Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle and they were all just nodding their heads in approval. Draco nodded his head before turning back to Pansy. Draco was confused as to why she hadn't questioned why he had gone with Harry.
"Bud." Harry repeated. Harry looked down at the tiny puppy snuggled up in his arms. "Bud. That's his name."
Pansy moved to stand next to Hermione. "Hermione and I decided that you two should share a kiss under the mistletoe. You know, Christmas spirit and all."
Everyone else at the club was meadow grass compared to this person. They were like a rouge poppy, seeming brighter and standing out among everyone else. Harry looked closer at the person and realised they were also wearing makeup. Black eyeliner that was so sharp it could kill someone framed their eyes and highlighter was delicately dusted on their cheekbones, making them glow. Almost angelic, Harry thought. A clear gloss coated their plump lips. Harry was transfixed.
Draco slipped the gold band onto Harry's finger. The words 'Until the very end' were engraved on the inside.
Draco looked up at Harry and searched for and sign of a lie or a joke but their stomach sunk as they didn't see one. "You're not serious."
"Ah, I suppose you wouldn't know." Draco cringed because they knew they would have to use Belle's deadname when explaining and they really hated doing that, knowing how uncomfortable it made Belle feel whenever her deadname was mentioned. "Uh, well Belle is transgender. Her dead name is Blaise."
Harry turned and faced Draco, confused. "Sure." Harry turned to Ron and Hermione. "I'll catch up with you guys."
Draco grabbed a present for Hermione, some wrapping paper, scissors and sellotape. Harry, of course, wrapped the present perfectly and was a lot happier from then on. He didn't complain once. Harry was still quite ill on Christmas Day but despite this, he and Draco went to visit his parents graves and laid lilies down. Before they went out, Draco wrapped Harry in about 20 layers of different clothes and bought his wand with him so he could cast a warming charm if need be.
Draco blushed before carefully hanging the dress up and walking over to Harry. They pressed their lips to Harry's and hugged him tightly.
Harry felt quite proud, he had made it through half of dinner and he hadn't looked up from his plate and he was beginning to relax more. Harry realised that he'd messed up when Hermione asked him a question and he looked up and immediately made eye contact with Malfoy. Holy shit, his eyes were pretty, Harry struggled to look away.
"What the fuck?" Draco spun around and was greeted with a snowball to the face. And another to his chest. And another to his stomach. "HARRY JAMES POTTER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!"
"Look, if you're going to take the piss out of me, do it but please don't tell anyone else." Draco begged. Draco almost never begged for anything and he hoped that showed Potter how desperate he was.
"Please go on a date with me." Harry said, seemingly subconsciously. Draco felt their heartbeat rise rapidly and they laughed as they watched Harry stumble over his words for a few moments. "I didn't mean- well, I did mean it but what I meant to say is that you look really good."
Hermione and Pansy had the perfect plan. After 6 months of planning, this was it. It was going to be amazing. They had planned everything out to the minute detail.
"Do you like me in makeup?" Draco asked, rolling his lips into a pout. "Or is it that you just like me, regardless of whether I'm wearing makeup?" Draco narrowed the gap between the two.
Draco leant forwards, carefully running the lipstick across their top and bottom lips. It felt soft and velvety against their lips, gliding over them with ease. Draco pressed their lips together and let them go, with a small 'pop' sound. The red looked stunning with the outfit, striking in its own way. Draco's cheeks flushed as they realised just how pretty they looked. They plumped and pouted their lips absentmindedly and played with their hair so it fell to one side. Draco smirked at themselves, before smiling softly, appreciating how much they loved the outfit.
It started when Draco found some eyeliner under a sofa in the slytherin common room. He knew it belonged to Pansy, she had been whining about losing it all week, saying 'it's the best eyeliner I've ever owned'. Draco rolled the small, black tube between his fingers, he was almost fascinated by it. He could and should give it back to Pansy but she had already ordered a new one so it wouldn't matter and also, Draco was curious. He was curious as to what it would look like on him, the stark contrast of the jet black liquid against his own pale skin.
Draco spent the rest of his Christmas happy, he had everything he needed with him, and that would never change.
Usually, Draco's arm would hit the chest of his boyfriend. Harry and Draco had been together for four years now, they had gotten together in their eighth year and since finishing Hogwarts, they lived together in a flat in London. Draco and Harry loved living together because they loved each other. Harry was Draco's universe, he was the reason Draco got up in the morning, he was Draco's happiness.
"I'm going to personally lead this investigation and I promise we won't stop until we find him." Kingsley said.
Draco took the drink from Harry's outstretched hand and saw that it was, in fact, their favourite drink. They had mentioned the drink and how it was their favourite about three weeks ago in a passing comment. "That was like three weeks ago."
It was a small beaded, black bracelet. Harry had given it to him when they first moved in together. Harry had a matching white one. Draco can remember the words so clearly when Harry held out his hand revealing the two bracelets.
Draco couldn't help but grin as he pushed open the door and stepped inside the shop. Draco gasped slightly as he took in the shop. Everything was so organised and beautiful. It was perfect. Draco decided that Hell better have a makeup shop or he didn't want to go there when he died.
Phone calls. He was getting so many phone calls. Everyone asked questions that Draco simply couldn't give them the answers to. He couldn't go five minutes without his phone buzzing, which is why he abandoned his phone. He hadn't looked at it or been on it for a few days.
At around 11 o'clock, Draco and Harry got changed and started to prepare for their guests. Draco started to steam the pudding for its final hour whilst Harry put everything else that could fit into the oven. It wasn't long until their fried s started to arrive. They all exchanged gifts with each other. Harry received a grey Weasley jumper with a blue H in the middle. He put it on to match Ron, who was wearing his.
Draco headed towards the lift and mentally prayed that he didn't bump into anyone because right now, human interaction was the last thing he wanted to take part in. Draco was just about to stop in front of the lift when he decided to carry on and take the stairs instead, there was less chance of running into someone and having to endure the awkward elevator silence.
As soon as the taxi stopped, Draco shoved the money into the mans hand and jumped out of the car and ran into the small block of flats.
"Yeah, everything's fine and thank you." Draco said as he began to walk towards the stairs. As soon as Hermione had disappeared out of sight, Draco started to run up the stairs.
"We will, sir. We are so sorry that you are in this situation." An officer said. The officers stood up and got ready to leave. "Mr Malfoy, are you coming?"
"Yeah, just like Hermione's preference was to go on a date with that girl instead of hanging out with you tonight." Harry retaliated, fumbling in his pockets for his keys before Ron chucked them at him.
"Hey Hermione." Harry gave her a hug back. "Ron." Harry shook his hand before bringing him into a hug.
Draco held his hand out and a snowflake fell gracefully onto his hand. Draco smiled at it before lifting his hand up and blowing it to the ground.
Only the six of them stayed over the christmas holidays, everyone else went home. The six loved it, they could basically do whatever they wanted. One night, they all got really drunk, even Hermione and they had a game of truth or dare. Let's just say it got very sexual.
Harry returned the middle fingers, laughing, as he backed into his room to get ready. He sighed contently to himself as he shut his bedroom door and smiled absentmindedly as he got out the clothes he was going to wear. Harry was happy, he was truly happy. The early stages of his life were horrible but at the moment, he had a good life and Harry was so thankful for that.
Harry noticed a gentle Christmas playing quietly in the background as he walked into the library. He walked over to where Draco normally sat and found his favourite person. Harry went to give Draco a hug from behind.
This new information was overwhelming Draco. He didn't know what to feel. Knowing that a mislocator was involved made it so much harder to actually find Harry because magical tacking won't do a thing but if they find out who stole the mislocator, then they find who stole Harry. Was he supposed to feel happy and excited or even worse than he already felt which he wasn't sure was possible?
They pulled the top over their head and did the same with the dress. Draco fiddled with the straps for a moment before stepping back and looking in the mirror. The black denim fell a couple of centimetres above their knee and was cinched in at the waist, showing off their figure. The black was a stark contrast to their pale skin, dark and bold. The top fit perfectly, snug and comfortable against Draco's arms and torso.
"Oh well." Harry said as he lightly patted Draco's ass earning an indignant squawk from them. "We're here now anyway."
Harry played The Bear and The Hare. A tear rolled down Harry's face as he watched it, this was definitely one of his personal favourites. Harry looked over a Draco and saw him smiling contently whilst tears rolled down his face.
"I'll be in in a minute. You two go and enjoy yourselves before I come and third wheel." Draco smirked.
The two stayed hugging for a little while longer before Ron broke away and turned to face Pansy. "You better- nice outfit by the way -you better treat her right or I will find you and I will take you down."
"Do you have anymore?" Harry asked, his eyes flicking to his own wrist where one of his own tattoos sat. "Tattoos, I mean."
Draco didn't know what to say. Their mouth was open slightly and they could feel tears filling up their eyes. Is that really how Harry felt? Draco didn't even try to stop the tears as they fell down their cheeks, they wouldn't have been able to even if they tried. It was in that moment that Draco realised that Harry meant home.
Draco did buy all his presents for Harry, though. He got everything and wrapped it and placed them in the corner of their living room, where the tree would normally be. Every time Draco looked at that pile of presents, tears fell silently down his face. Would Harry ever be back to open them?
They both sat in the living room opening gifts from each other, family and friends. Lots of wrapping paper later, Draco handed his mother one last present. It was a small box shape covered with a silver, snowflake wrapping paper. Narcissa gently took the wrapping paper off to reveal a green velvet box. She gently opened it and gasped at its contents.
The two finished eating their dinner before retiring to the living room. The two shared a dance in front of the fire before going up to their own rooms. Draco got changed into his pyjamas and slid into bed.
Draco cradled Harry closer to his chest as he stood up and ran out of the hut. All he cared about right now was getting Harry to the hospital and out of this hell hole. Draco was going to fucking kill Seamus.
But accepting himself was one thing, supporting himself was a much harder obstacle to overcome. Harry was terrified of himself, he was scared of his feelings, he didn't know what to do with them. But with love and support constantly being thrown towards him by his friends, he was finally able to love who he was. And he was happy. So, so happy.
And interviews. So many fucking interviews. The ministry wanted interviews. The Daily Prophet wanted an interview. The muggle police wanted interviews. Every muggle newspaper and news station imaginable wanted an interview. It was so incredibly frustrating to Draco because the same questions were asked over and over again.
"Now." Draco flicked his wand and a christmas song started playing. Harry recognised the song, Mistletoe by Justin Beiber. Pretty much everyone in Hogwarts was obsessed with this song.
Next, Draco found himself staring at the lipsticks. The red one he had currently was nowhere near finished, so he didn't need a new red one but he wanted another one and Draco knew exactly what colour he was looking for. He scanned the display, all the colours were so pretty and Draco wanted to buy all of them but he knew he couldn't. Not if he wanted to keep his makeup a secret. Draco's eyes immediately lit up when he saw it. A tube of black lipstick. Draco smirked to himself as he added black lipstick the the mental image of himself. He knew he would look stunning with black lipstick on and he couldn't wait to see Harry's reaction.
Draco watched with an unimpressed stare as Harry gently placed them down and began stripping his clothes in order to get ready for bed.
Light conversation filled the air as Harry led Draco to their date spot. Harry was still trying to comprehend that he was actually on a date with Draco. He was also slightly worried that Draco wouldn't like the place he had picked to have their date. Harry knew he was taking a risk when he decided on this place, knowing that it wasn't exactly everyone's cup of tea but Harry though it was a risk worth taking because this had the potential of being a really great date.
"I found him actually." Bud yawned and then did a really adorable thing with his nose making both Harry and Draco 'aw'. "What are you going to name him?"
Draco gave Harry a gentle push as he checked the time. "It's 7:29 Ron! I am this close to coming out there and hexing you're if you don't stop!"
Hermione and Ginny were both bridesmaids, along with Luna and Pansy. Draco and Harry had picked out some beautiful, soft grey dressed. The fabric went down to the floor. The dressed had a soft sweetheart neckline and the straps were designed to loosely hang off the shoulders. Each dress was tightened around the waist with a grey ribbon. Each girl had a bouquet of lilys that they would be carrying. Ron was Harry's best man and Blaise was Draco's. Ron wore a black tux, with a tie to match Harry and Blaise wore a white tux, with a tie to match Draco.
Harry was everything Draco could ask for and more. He was kind and sweet, he constantly made Draco feel like they were on top of the world and better than everyone else and he accepted them, which Draco was more than thankful for. Right from the beginning, Draco had never face any judgment from Harry. Not when they told him they were non-binary, not when they had made Harry look at an outfit in a shop, not when other people gave them strange looks, not when Draco had asked Harry to paint their nails.
Harry ran out of the changing rooms as fast as he could. He wasn't really sure what had just happened but one thing he knew for certain was that he liked it. He wasn't really sure why he was running away either, he enjoyed what just happened but also slightly scared. Harry ran all the way to his dorm where he immediately shut the door and sunk into the floor.
Draco sighed and let their head drop so it was hanging off the edge of their bed. It had been years since they had come out and started breaking gender norms but currently, they felt better then ever. Draco pretended not to know why this was but they knew that it was because of the fact that they ran into Harry Potter last night.
The two drove to the nearest supermarket and went inside. They passed several bits of tinsel that made Draco want to throw up. They were so tacky, like how were they even legal? Eventually they found some plain silver tinsel. Harry first grabbed an armful but Draco told him to put most of it back. Harry protested at first but gave in as he knew he wasn't going to get anywhere. On their way to the checkout, Draco picked up a tin of Roses for him and Harry to share. Draco knew to leave all the strawberry dreams for Harry and Harry knew to leave all the signature truffles for Draco. The two paid for the tinsel and the chocolates and drove home.
Harry walked over to Hermione before Ron could say anything else. Harry was confused as to why Hermione hadn't stepped in or at least said something.
Draco walked into the bathroom and opened the bathroom cabinet. He grabbed some paracetamol, ibuprofen and vaporub. Before going back into the bedroom, Draco made himself and Harry a cup of tea with two sugars. They both liked their tea the same way. Draco walked back into their bedroom and placed the mugs of tea down on Harry's bedside table, which was a mess. No surprise there. Draco took out two pills from the paracetamol box and left the ibuprofen on the side. He passed them to Harry who swallowed them with a gulp of tea.
"That's me." Harry chuckled before his eyes lit up and he broke away from Draco. "Wait here for a moment."
Harry sat bolt upright and started at Draco is disbelief and shock. "You don't know what an advent calendar is?"
"Evidently." Harry raises his eyebrows. "You know, I really don't understand why they attach knives to shoes."
Draco pulled Harry around the ice a couple of times before letting go of Harry's hands and letting him glide by himself.
Draco no longer thought they were falling in love Harry because they knew they were already in love with him.
Harry waited for Draco to get ready. Harry got a bit impatient as Draco took bloody hours to do his hair. Like, it didn't even matter, he was going to put a hat over it anyway.
"Mr. Malfoy. Before you leave, I need to have a word with you." Healer Rhodes said. He was the head healer of the hospital while Draco and his time off.
Draco worked as a healer but had been allowed time off work. He couldn't think. He couldn't focus. He couldn't do anything. He never imagined that he would have to treat Harry for something as bad as this. There had always been a possibility, Draco knew that, but never in a million years did he expect it to happen.
Draco hung his head and let the tears fall freely down his face. He didn't notice Harry's hand moving and his eyes slowly flickering open.
Draco and Harry slowly leant forward, smirks on both their faces. They heard several people gasp as their lips crashed together. Harry thought he heard Hermione scream a little. Harry placed his hands in Draco's hair as Draco explored the his mouth. The kiss lasted for about fifteen seconds before thy both broke away breathless.
Draco walked into the living room, the bracelet still in his hand. He looked at it before screaming and throwing it into to the floor. A single tear slipped down his cheek whilst he stared at the bracelet on the floor. This was the first time that the bracelet hadn't been on Draco's wrist, since the moment he had put it on for the first time, he had never taken it off. Draco often looked down at it and smiled, it just reminded him that Harry was his. A lot of people's favourite people are family members or celebrities but Harry was Draco's favourite person and the bracelet reminded him that his favourite person was his. Now it was just a reminder that his favourite person was gone.
Ron looked at Harry, his eyes full of judgement. "No offence mate, but you literally look like you just killed someone and that's on top of collapsing as soon as you walked through the door and the continuous muttering of 'what the fuck'."
"Hey, man." A voice called out. Draco turned around and saw a guy with blonde hair and glasses. "You're looking for Seamus, right? Seamus Finnegan?"
"Look, I know I may not be the smartest sometimes but I've actually spent a lot of time thinking about this." Ron said, after a minute of silence.
Pansy had been there since the beginning. Draco was so thankful to have her in their life. Even just having one person who accepts you makes all the difference, and Draco knew this. Without Pansy, Draco wasn't sure if they would even be alive today. She had helped them through their darkest times, never wavering and always standing by Draco. She was Draco's ride or die.
Draco crawled around to the door next to where Harry was standing. He looked up to see Harry cautiously looking around for Draco, two snowballs in either hand. Draco quietly stepped out and grabbed two handfuls of snow. He crept up to Harry before shoving both handfuls of snow down Harry's back.
Him standing there and Draco walking towards him dressed in a beautiful white dress that flowed down their frame perfectly was so right that it made Harry want to laugh and smile, scream, shout and cry.
If Draco could take away all of Harry's pain, even if it were just for a moment, he would because no one in the world deserved it more than Harry. What Draco would give to see Harry without his pain and trauma.
Harry walked up to his dorm, shut the door, flopped onto his bed and screamed into his pillow. People were really goddamn annoying sometimes. Harry groaned and rolled over, he knew everyone was going to be asking who he was going to the ball with and he honestly would rather throw himself off of a cliff than endure the questioning. Harry hoped Draco wasn't going through the same thing because Draco was not a people person.
"And you think I care?" Harry gave Ron a pointed stare as he slipped his shoes on. "Right, ready to go?"
"It's fucking freezing. Why did you drag me out of bed? I kind of hate you right now. Are you even listening to me?"
"Of course it's an aesthetic. Black is its own aesthetic. You're just too uncultured to realise that." Draco smirked.
"Oh my god, why were you embarrassed? Draco, currently, you are the literal definition of perfect. I mean, holy shit, you look stunning."
"Hang on." Ron said before his eyes went wide and he pointed at Draco. "You know who 'Mione's girlfriend is too? Wait... oh my god, you were his inside source!"
Draco usually tried to avoid sleep as he would wake up expecting to see Harry by his side only to be slapped in the face by reality but right now, he just needed to sleep and let his mind take a break. He didn't even bother getting changed, he just got into bed and pulled the covers up, desperate for dreams of his Harry to temporarily take over reality.
"I've got a stomachache so I'm just gonna go back to the common room." Harry said, not waiting for a reply before he walked out of the Great Hall.
It was the Christmas holidays in Hogwarts and everything was perfect, except for one thing. It hadn't snowed yet. This was a big problem for Harry, he absolutely loved the snow. Playing in it, making snowmen, having snowball fights. It was the 23rd of December and Harry was starting to lose hope.
He was scared of a lot of things now. He wanted Harry home so the only things he was scared about was burning his tongue on his morning coffee that was made by Harry and someone spotting a hickey on his neck so he didn't have to endure the awkwardness when someone asked him what's on his neck.
As the sun began to set, the sky was painted in brilliant hues of red blended with oranges, purples and crimsons and someone began to play some music. Harry watched with fondness as Draco got up and began dancing with everyone. Harry would pay millions to see the wide smile and dimples that currently adorned Draco's face forever. Even though Draco was dancing with many people, they still stood out. Draco was so bright and special and Harry didn't want to go back to his life before Draco fell into it like a drop of sun.
"Hello Mr Dursley. I'm Draco Malfoy, your nephews boyfriend and these, as you have probably guessed, are the police." Draco said, gesturing to the two officers behind him.
Draco jumped up from the sofa and ran out of the room. He had been waiting to do this tomorrow, when it was their anniversary but Draco thought that now seemed like the perfect time to do it. He rifled through his sock drawer, smiling when he found what he was looking for and immediately ran back downstairs.
Harry's eyes widened as he traced the design. The dark mark sat at the centre of their arm but that wasn't what caught Harry's attention. What caught his attention was the field of flowers that covered the inside of their arm. Blues, yellows, pinks, greens, all entwined with each other to create an image that was so beautiful that it took away all focus from the dark mark.
Lights were carefully hung all around the room, giving it a magical glow. Tinsel ran up the banister of the stairs and across the desks. Little Christmas figures were placed around the room and it seemed like there was a slight shimmer to everything. Big stars hung from the lights below and Draco had spent over an hour charming the ceiling to make it look like it was snowing. But the thing that stood out the most was the tree. The tree was beautiful, it was perfect. Lights had been delicately wrapped around the branches and silver tinsel was placed where the magical glow of the lights wasn't as strong. All the decorations had been placed with care and in just the right place. Silver, white and light blue baubles hung gently off the branches, candy canes and chocolates were scattered within the tree and other small decorations were placed here and there, but what really finished off the tree was the star sat at the top. The star shimmered gently in the light, it was a beautiful silver covered with glitter. It was so simplistic, yet so elegant.
"That boy was never right in the head. You know, I wouldn't be surprised if he killed himself. I mean it's about time." Petunia said.
"Okay, so we're still nowhere on who took him so what about why, why would someone take him?" Draco asked.
Draco nodded and smiled at the man. The rest of the ride down was held in a comfortable silence. The doors opened and the two parted ways.
Draco dropped the photo as his eyes widened with realisation. He brought a hand to his mouth as he felt his heart rate speed up slightly. That was it. This was it. Draco scrambled around, trying to find his phone. He knew, Draco knew.
Harry linked his and Draco's hand together while Draco placed his other hand on Harry's waist. Harry slowly began to sway to the music. Draco joined in and slowly took a couple of steps around the room. Harry span Draco round, making Draco smile. Harry closed the gap between them and looked up into Draco's eyes.
Draco couldn't be happier that all of Harry's abusers, the people who made his life hell, were all in prison. He saw a change in Harry too, he seemed less on edge and more at ease. He was so proud of the progress Harry had made. Sometimes, he just watched Harry go about his day because he couldn't help but admire him. Harry was so much stronger than Draco could ever put into words. Harry was so much more than he ever could be, he was so much more than anyone could ever be.
Then there was the 'Are you okay?'. Every time he walked into someone he knew, that bloody question was asked. If Draco had a pound for every time someone asked him that, he'd be a fucking millionaire. Draco was sick of that question, actually, no, he was sick of answering that question, sick of lying. He just wanted to scream 'No, of course I'm not okay! Why the fuck would I be okay?' but instead he lied, whether it was a simple 'I'm fine' or 'I'm holding up as best as I can', it was always a lie. Draco was falling apart, little pieces kept falling away but he never took the time to come to terms with that. He never took a moment for himself, he didn't let himself cry, he didn't allow himself to breathe.
Draco stared at the spot Pansy was just standing, their brain taking a few moments to register what she had just said.
"We need to brush milk over the top of them and then put sugar on them." Harry said. Draco went to find the baking brush. "Shit!"
A smile couldn't help but make its way into Harry's face as he turned onto the field and saw all of his old friends. The feeling of belonging immediately ran through his veins and in this moment, with Draco holding his hand, nothing felt more right. Harry sometimes forgot just how much love he held for all of these people.
Pansy and Ginny burst out into laughter. Five seconds later, so was Harry. And then so was everyone else.
Draco went to the bathroom to get Harry some cough medicine. They seemed to have run out of the black currant flavour which meant Harry would have to have the lemon one. Harry hated lemon. Draco walked back to their room with the lemon medicine and a spoon in hand. Draco knew a disagreement was going to occur.
It was a Saturday morning when Draco's owl dropped a small package in front of him. Draco felt his heart skip as he picked up the letter and ripped it open. Immediately he recognised his mother's penmanship and a smile made its way onto Draco's face. He quickly banished it though, Draco was notoriously grumpy in the mornings and he didn't need people questioning why he was so happy that particular day.
"Also fuck gender stereotypes, like whoever invented them, literally nobody asked. You are the best partner I could ever ask for." Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's nose.
Harry opened and closed his mouth a few times, unsure as to what to say. He had never expected Ron to fix his hair and then say that. Dean, Seamus and Neville all seemed equally as confused as Harry.
Draco stopped and flicked their eyes over Harry's outfit, trying hard not to linger their eyes on Harry's thighs because
Snow began to gently twirl down from the sky as the two men reached the top of the hill. They sat on the grass, holding each other's hands. Harry rested his head on Draco's shoulder and sighed contently.
Draco stepped out into the ministry and waited for Hermione. Everyone seemed to do a double take when they saw Draco, they were so used to seeing him dressed up. Usually, there was not a crinkle in his clothes, his hair was styled to perfection and he stood tall with his shoulders back. But today, he had a sweater and some black jeans on, his clothes wrinkled and dirty. His hair was messily pushed back and his eyes were slightly bloodshot. Draco's shoulders were slumped forwards, making him seem a lot smaller than he actually was.
Draco found himself searching the small forest in the bigger of the parks for the third time. He had to be here somewhere, he just had to be. Maybe Harry was playing a game, maybe Draco would go back of their flat and find Harry on the sofa with that smirk on his face and he'd say "Got you". Draco almost laughed at the absurdity of that thought. What was he thinking? Harry would never do that to him, Harry would never do something like that.
