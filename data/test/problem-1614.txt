Malfoy slouches in his plush chair, unmoving and unblinking as he stares at the painting on the wall: unaware that what he's looking at is his mother's love made manifest, or a window into his past life, or anything at all.
The light nestled in the vee of Harry's partly-zipped jacket makes no response. Harry keeps moving.
"I honestly didn't expect that to work," he comments, as Draco carefully extricates Teddy's pinned arm and rearranges it to drape loosely around Harry's neck.

The room on the other side is pitch-black. Tendrils of frigid mist roll out into the hallway, clawing at Harry's ankles like the fog at the edge of a lake, years ago, when the Dementors had come to Hogwarts. He remembers banishing them with his own patronus; he remembers how amazed he'd been to discover that light in himself, so brilliant and forceful he'd assumed it must be his father's instead of his own.
him, dragging a wave of despair along with it, as if Harry's mind is just a scared teenage boy being dragged to a chair in the center of a room, screaming—
"Right," Harry says in a dry voice. Setting his mug down on the hardwood floor, he leans back and sinks into the sofa, stretching his arms overhead until they touch the wall behind him. A faint current of air brushes against the hairs where his jumper's ridden up below his bellybutton: Draco's eyes drop to the exposed strip of skin, and then his tongue wets his lips, like he's fucking
"It's for you," Harry says, realizing dimly that his throat is thick with the urge to cry: not from exhaustion or relief, but from
Draco stops in front of the sofa. Leaning backwards with one forearm still supporting Teddy's bottom, he lifts his other hand from Teddy's back and mutters along to a complicated gesture that looks like it should be familiar but isn't, and then Harry is hit with the
Turning toward the cells, he lifts the pendant and holds it against one door and then the one next to it, and another—
But he was
"I don't know if you can hear me," he says softly, "but I promise I'll fix this. I'll make it right."
"You can't just fucking swear in front of a baby,
A pleased smirk crosses Draco's face. "Potter, I would
. The grimoire had stated it would be unmistakable.
Harry tells himself he can't accept what he doesn't face. And that's all this is: facing it, night after night.
There's a narrow walkway with a heavy railing that rings the walls along each floor of cells. Gripping his wand, he climbs the steps to the first level.
. This is what he wants.
Harry's head shoots up in time to see the Dementor turn the corner on the stairs, advancing up the steps with deathly quiet.
Draco Malfoy."
he wants it.
Who'd sheltered him, encouraged him, protected him.
"Why don't I take over before you hurt yourself," he says. The words come out even better than he'd intended, low and warm, bringing a flush to Draco's fair cheeks.
, and Harry nearly chokes on a laugh. He stretches one last time — mostly out of spite — and stands, ambling the few steps over to Draco.
“Don't call her that!” Draco said through gritted teeth. “Is that why you did it? Because you don't want me being friends with Hermione?”
The boy went bright red, but walked closer. “Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor, although I wanted to be in Slytherin like you, but the hat wouldn't let me.”
Seconds later, the door opened and Draco stepped through. Harry stared at him. “Are you real?”
Neville smiled sympathetically. “Her name's Ginny.”
The two red-robed men bound Mr Malfoy's hands together. The taller one took his cane, and they marched him from the room.
Between the two of them, Harry and Snape related the events to their audience. When they finished,  Draco was pale and gripping the arm of Harry's chair tightly, McGonagall and Dumbledore looked grave, and Fudge and his companions tense.
“Now, now, Mr Malfoy, language!” Lockhart scolded, as Colin jumped.
Suddenly the knocker came to life. “I am the beginning of the end, and the end of time and space. I am essential to creation, and I surround every place. What am I?”
Harry shook his head quickly. “Sorry, no, it's not that I don't want to. I just don't know if I
“You don't even know it was her!”
“How'd you find that out?” Theo wanted to know.
Harry forced down the potion and winced at the foul taste before Pomfrey took back the beaker and retreated to her office.
With that the elf ran out of the room and down the stairs. Harry swore and took off after him as quietly as he could. He found Dobby crouching on top of a kitchen cabinet with Aunt Petunia's pudding floating in front of him.
Draco looked at him and switched the earphone to the ear further away from Harry. “They're... They're good. Although it is entirely unnatural to have the music playing inside my ear.”
HIS SKELETON WILL LIE IN THE CHAMBER FOREVER.
Theo grinned. “I think it's time we got a little revenge, don't you?”
Draco grimaced. “They still don't know what happened, by the way. Wood denies touching the Bludger, and you know Gryffindors, they're more likely to just knock you off your broom than do something sneaky like this.”
Hagrid waved back. “Alright there, Harry?” A small boy next to him whipped his head around and stared at Harry.
Harry stared at her. “After seeing that? No thanks. You'd beat me in four moves! Besides, I know how much Draco has missed this. And I have a stack of mail to go through.”
Dobby eyed the water jug before nodding jerkily.
Harry rolled his eyes and slipped the diary into his pocket.
“It could be both of them,” the blonde girl offered. “They're always together, maybe one of them is the Heir, and has convinced the other to help him?”
“What do you need them for?” Draco continued.
He walked out to the common room and found Tracey studying with Theo.
Draco gave a nervous chuckle. “They do like yelling at each other, don't they?”
The pot of daffodils in Malfoy's room are blooming on the bedside table. A fine layer of dust covering the blossoms suggests they've been under stasis this whole time. Still decaying, but slower.
It flares, once, through the fabric—
As Draco gets closer, it becomes obvious that his shoulders have started to round inwards. He must be growing tired; Teddy might be small for his age, but he's still over two years old and getting heavier all the time, and Harry wonders how long Draco has been carrying him.
A thousand doors, a thousand options. Only one of them had drifted into that dingy little room where Malfoy had been cuffed to a chair. Only one of them is why Harry's here tonight.
Harry stares through the open door, fingers curled tight around his wand, and weighs one kind of darkness against another before stepping inside.
“Hermione, don't make us sneak into your dorm,” Draco warned.
********
Harry blinked at the cracks disappeared from his vision. “Thanks.”
Harry frowned at his photocopy in frustration. This had all seemed so simple in the library. He was discovering that looking at
“Shut up and look at this,” Millicent said, pointing at the notice board.
“Maybe he'll buy you one if you get on the team,” Harry suggested.
Harry grinned. “Sure.”
Draco jumped to his feet. “You're not coming to King's Cross with us?”
“Yes, that's the exact impression I got when you ignored us for two hours,” Draco said sarcastically.
For the second time that day Harry was left gaping at one of his best friends. “What?”
“Yes. If I hadn't found him...” McGonagall trailed off as they all stared down at the unmoving body.
“The first one's always a bit of shock, but you'll be okay.”
“Teachers are only to be set on fire, apparently,” muttered Draco, making Harry snort. Luckily Daphne was too busy glaring at Pansy to hear.
Harry snapped the diary shut as the last of Tom's reply sank into the paper. He emerged from his bed, grabbed his Slytherin scarf and met Draco's expectant gaze.
Draco shrugged. “No, she acts the same when I'm talking about Hermione as when I'm talking about one of our Slytherin friends. And she was quite impressed by her solving Snape's potion puzzle last year. It just depends on which one of them will be taking us to Diagon Alley this year.”
“Thank you, Mrs Malfoy,” he said.
Theo pushed up the hair hanging over his ear, revealing a small bald patch. “That was two drops.”
Draco pulled Hermione along the platform. “It's time you met my mother.”
” Snape roared.
“That's nothing new,” muttered Harry, grinning.
“You sound like your mum.”
“Yeah,” Harry said as he put on his cloak and scarf. “Come on.”
” A pixie froze in mid-air next to Draco, before crashing to the floor.
,” Draco replied.
“I mean romantically,” Hermione said.
After a quick trip to the kitchens they were soon settled in an empty classroom with their lunch.
Harry looked up when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Snape had a slight smirk on his face. “
Draco handed the drawing he was still holding over to his mother, then looked over. “I didn't want him going up to some venomous snake and getting bitten.”
Draco looked at Dobby in confusion before he turned pink and shot to his feet. “What did you do, Father?”
,” Draco said nervously.
“Yes, please,” Harry said fervently.
********
********
” Harry asked quietly.
Harry looked around the Chamber, half expecting the basilisk to emerge from behind a pillar. He'd never heard of them before, but he gathered it was some kind of snake.
“An excellent suggestion, Hermione.”
Harry thought of some of the Gryffindors in his year and laughed. “I'll do my best.”
“One moment, Minerva,” Snape replied. He guided Harry and Draco to the empty chairs in front of McGonagall's desk and gave Harry a glass of water off McGonagall's desk. “Drink it all, slowly,” he said, then turned back to the assembled adults. “It was actually Mr Malfoy here who figured it all out and came to me.”
“Sure. It's not like we got homework last lesson.”
“Unforeseen hold up,” Lockhart muttered. “Now then! Mr Malfoy, Miss Bulstrode, you can start scrubbing the scorch marks off the walls over there. As for you, Mr Potter, you can help me address my fan mail.”
“I think so, yes.”
“Yes, Mother. Come on!” Draco grabbed Harry's hand and they took off up the gravel driveway.
“Ignore the last few. People started adding their friends to the list. And obviously the last two entries are completely impossible,” Miles said.
“Enough, Macmillan!” McGonagall said sternly.
********
Harry entered a little cautiously. He'd never been in a girl's bedroom before, and he wasn't sure what he was expecting. To his surprise, he found the room to be pretty much the same as the boys' dorm, except with only four beds. And a little better smelling, if he was honest.
“If you say so,” Harry mumbled, then started gathering up the pages.
“Got it.”
Mrs Malfoy swept down the stairs a few minutes later, and clicked her tongue irritably when she saw Harry alone. “Tilly.”
Fudge gasped, and the red-robed men gripped their wands more tightly.
“Excuse me, but I believe
“Are you two done?” Hermione glared at them. “As I was trying to say, I haven't had any luck finding mention of the Chamber of Secrets in the library, and
Pansy ignored them and smiled at Harry. “Excellent, you'll be with me and Daphne!”
When he didn't finish, Harry looked up. “In fact what, Draco?”
“Face your partners and bow to each other!” Lockhart called out over the din.
“Er, are you lost?” Harry asked him.
“Mr Potter, did you disarm Mr Malfoy on your first attempt?”
He found Draco sitting up in bed, surrounded by piles of letters and parcels. There were two breakfast trays next to him.
“Forgot about that.”
Pansy shrugged. “Him or you - I haven't made up my mind. Perhaps I'll poison both of you, and then myself for good measure.”
“Oi, you! Harry Potter!” he bellowed.
Harry stared at him.
“Harry Potter will have them if he promises not to go back to Hogwarts.”
“Sorry, sir. I understand you don't like talking about her,” Harry said quickly.
“Yes sir,” Dobby said sadly.
“So who do you think will be teaching it?” Blaise asked.
His laughter drowned out Harry's groan of despair.
********
Draco looked around the room. “We're going to figure out who's doing this. And they're going to pay.”
Hermione was busy telling Draco and Neville about her family's holiday to France. Harry was only half paying attention to her, as he was watching the busy corridor outside their compartment. He'd watched Daphne pounce on Stephen and drag him off somewhere, and Theo and Blaise had just walked out of Flint's compartment clutching a large bag of gold. They'd won the betting pool and were laughing as they discussed their plans for the money. Harry gave them an amused smile before he caught sight of a flash of red.
Harry blinked. “Why would you care who she has a crush on?”
The wall slid open again. Harry stepped through, frowning. So the wall opened to Parseltongue. Well, that was good to know. No more worrying if he couldn't remember the password. He ignored the few students sitting in the common room, and made his way to the notice board to check the password.
“Cornish pixies? That's it?”
“The match has been cancelled. All students are to immediately return to their house common rooms, and remain there until their Heads of Houses arrive to address them all. As quickly as you can, please.”
A few first years hastily decided to bet on other teachers, but most of the sixth and seventh years bet on McGonagall just to annoy Gemma. She was still grumbling about it at the end of the feast when Harry got up to go talk to Snape. He approached the staff table a little nervously.
“Hogwarts is not safe for Harry Potter,” Dobby said earnestly.
Harry stared at her. “I don't understand how you're even in that house, they all sound like idiots. I'm so glad the hat decided to put me in Slytherin.”
The elf popped up at once. “What can Tilly do, sir?”
have blocked you if I'd wanted, as you telegraphed your move rather obviously, but for demonstrative purposes...”
Snape gave Ollie a small smile. “Give him my thanks and come along.”
Daphne rolled her eyes. “You know you look good. But now Harry does too, and I wanted to give him some positive reinforcement.”
Hermione sighed again; the noise was starting to irritate Harry. “Exactly. He's not used to being told 'no'. If he wasn't sure about how you feel, I doubt he'd say anything.”
“Yeah. I've already waited a day to let Hermione know I'm free from the Dursleys. I don't want to know what she'd say if I left it much longer.”
Narcissa smiled down at Dobby. “Yes, Draco. After you sent Dobby home to inform me of your father's actions, I presented him with clothes. It doesn't quite make up for the way your father treated him, but it was what he asked for.”
They all looked after him. “That was dramatic,” Tracey commented.
Harry watched in amazement as the ashes wriggled. Soon enough, an ugly chick was sitting there. Dumbledore picked him up and put him back on the perch.
The three of them trudged after Snape, a chorus of commiseration following them out. Snape led them to his office, where he sat behind the desk and gestured to three wooden chairs in front of him. Once they were sitting down, he folded his hands together and stared at them all.
Harry swayed a little as he read the words and Draco grabbed his waist to steady him. “Holy shit,” Harry said quietly.
“Apology accepted,” Draco said, and stuck out his hand. Harry ignored it and pulled Draco into a hug. Draco was stiff at first, but soon returned the hug.
He walked back to the Hufflepuff table as Draco reappeared.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked in surprise.
“Come now, I expected a better show from you than this!” Lockhart called from behind his desk. He raised his wand and shook his sleeves back with a flourish. “
Lockhart beamed down at everyone. “Good evening! Can everyone see me? Yes? Can everyone hear me? Good. Now, the Headmaster has graciously allowed me to start up a duelling club, so that you're all well prepared if ever you should need to defend yourselves – as I have on  many occasions – but then you all know that, having read my books!”
Harry and Draco quickly went and grabbed the last book on their lists and paid, before making their way back to Mr Malfoy. Hagrid and the Weasleys had all disappeared by the time they returned. They followed Mr Malfoy in silence as he led the way out of the shop. When they got outside he looked at Draco. “Have you anything left to buy?”
Lockhart must have finally noticed Snape's expression as he quickly changed tacks. “Well! Enough from us! Professor Snape, if you'd like to assist, let's get them into pairs so they can have a go!”
“Obnoxiously red and full of Weasleys?” Draco asked.
speak English?” Hermione snapped.
,” Harry said, feeling oddly guilty.
Hope you all enjoyed second year! Thank you to everyone who took the time to read, especially to those who commented, or left kudos. Your feedback always makes me smile.
Draco smirked. “She is rather fierce when she's cross, isn't she? You should have seen her when my father said he wanted to send me abroad for school, instead of Hogwarts.”
The class leaned forward with sincere interest for the first time that lesson. Satisfied he had their undivided attention, Lockhart took hold of the cover and whipped it off the cage. There was a beat of silence and then Theo snorted.
,” Harry repeated. “Right, got it. Thanks, sir.”
Harry laughed. “So, nothing like Daphne, then. Wait, does this mean we can't sneak into the Gryffindor common room anymore?”
Harry looked at Draco, who frowned back in confusion. “Er, about what?”
“Can we have your autograph?”
“Nonsense! From what I saw the other afternoon you're obviously keen to get into the fame game, and this is a fine place to start!”
Snape finally looked at him again. “If you're staying at Hogwarts over the Christmas break, I will be amenable to a visit on Boxing Day.”
“I don't think we'll have to,” Harry murmured. “Look at Snape.”
“Er, Ollie says that he used to see you hide from some Gryffindors in a classroom further down this corridor,” Harry said nervously.
“Good. I'm sorry for putting you in danger,” Draco looked uncomfortable. “I want you to go to Mother and tell her everything you know about the diary, and what happened tonight. Can you do that?”
“Good,” Harry said with relief. “Er, I mean, not that the stuff I had to drink was that bad, sir. It did fix my arm.” He gave it a little shake.
” Harry asked.
What he had been expecting to be a small back room was instead a large, well-lit store. It was easily as big as the Great Hall at Hogwarts, and filled with neatly ordered clothing. Jeans and t-shirts took up as much floor space as the full wizard robes did, and mannequins were displaying a mixture of both styles of clothing. Shoes of all sorts covered one wall, and there were accessories and pyjamas as well.
“I told the snake not to attack him!” Harry protested.
,” Harry said with a grin.
“Is this true?” Hermione looked worried.
Harry had to read it a few times before it sunk in. He quickly wrote a reply.
“Thanks. And, er, why don't you get outside to cheer up? It's snowy and some people have been making snowmen,” Harry said.
Narcissa continued, “I merely wished to inform you that it might be prudent for you to not bother Harry over the summer. He nearly killed some other students this year, you see. I'm sure you understand that he might need some time alone to recover from that.”
“Not that one!” Draco snatched his hand back.
“Because it's my fault she was Petrified in the first place!” Harry cried.
The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk as Dumbledore placed the rigid cat down on it. He and McGonagall leaned close as they inspected the cat. Harry shuffled closer to Draco as they stood nervously, with Snape standing close behind them and Filch sobbing in a chair. Lockhart was bragging about how he could have saved the cat if he'd been there in time. Harry tuned him out and watched as Dumbledore and McGonagall completed their inspection.
Draco nodded jerkily. “He says that a student was killed last time, that Hagrid was blamed for the attacks, and there were no further attacks after he was expelled. He's also told me not to be alone with him.”
“No, this is great. Thank you.”
“I still can't believe we got covered with vinegar,” Draco grumbled.
One evening in January, Harry and Draco were standing under the Invisibility Cloak outside the Ravenclaw entrance. After the debacle getting into the Hufflepuff basement, Draco had insisted they research Ravenclaw before attempting to get in. They'd followed Morag and Padma after dinner, and the two girls were currently standing before a door with no handle. There was a bronze knocker shaped like an eagle in the centre of the door.
Mrs Malfoy smiled fondly at her son, then snapped her fingers. A house-elf popped into the room with a tea tray, poured for all of them, and disappeared again. The conversation was light as Harry sipped his tea and watched as Mrs Malfoy quickly manoeuvred Draco into checkmate. Draco grumbled and reached for his tea as Mrs Malfoy cast a Repairing Charm on the shattered pieces and set the board up again.
“Do not allow your resentment over the way some students are treating you to drive you to act foolishly,” Snape said sharply.
Dumbledore merely smiled. “Finally. I've been telling him to hurry up, he's looked awful for a week now.” When Harry frowned at him in confusion, Dumbledore chuckled. “Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. When they get old, they burst into flames to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes. If you watch him now, you'll see what I mean.”
“Good afternoon Mr and Mrs Dursley,” Narcissa said coldly.
“I'd rather be a useless seer than a lunatic,” Harry muttered.
“Thanks.” Harry turned to Hedwig, gave her the last piece of meat, and attached the letters to her leg. “Can you make sure everyone gets their letters?”
“Aragog wouldn't hurt no one,” Hagrid said.
“You look like shit,” Draco said flatly.
Harry laughed. “Fine. Accept my thanks for your completely selfish act.”
” Harry shouted, grinning as Ron got knocked over. He got to his feet as Seamus handed him back his wand.
“Oh! I'll take you, if you let me watch,” she said, getting up. “I'll be back later, Theo.”
Harry stuck the pin in again and did as she said. “Aha!”
Hagrid had sent him a package of rock cakes. “Er, you don't have any dogs, do you?”
“You know why you're here.”
“I never said that, sir,” Harry said.
“I'm going to make my father buy me one,” Draco said as they eased out of the crowd.
from Harry?” Draco looked down his nose at the boy.
“I wouldn't say favourite, darling. It's just the closest that caters to witches,” she corrected.
“What?” Harry choked out. His favourite professor had followed the madman who murdered his parents?
“Well you did look rather pathetic when you begged us all to write to you.”
“Right, okay, Ginny,” Harry nodded. “Draco's pissed at me because of her, or something. I don't know.”
“Huh?” Harry pulled away from what was obviously Draco.
At that, Ron launched himself at Draco, sending both of them crashing to the floor. A few students shrieked, and Vince started chanting “Fight!”
Halfway through the tape, Harry could hear some shouting. He considered simply turning up the volume, but he was acutely aware that he didn't have many batteries in his room. With a sigh, he decided to save his supply. He turned off the Walkman and put it back under the floorboard. The shouting might entertain him, he reasoned. It might even be the police, come to see why the Dursleys had locked up their nephew, though he didn't think that was very likely. He crept over to his door and pressed his ear against it. He could hear Uncle Vernon swearing at the top of his lungs, and then footsteps rushing up the stairs.
“Let him continue, Cornelius. There will be time for questions when he's finished his tale,” Dumbledore said mildly.
“Exactly.”
“Dumbledore's coming back!” shouted a few people.
“False alarm,” he said to their concerned looks. He shoved something into Harry's pocket under the table. Harry stuck his hand into his pocket and felt the slippery folds of his Cloak. He shot a questioning look at Draco and got an innocent smile in return.
. He glanced away to where Draco looked like he couldn't decide whether to scowl or laugh.
Harry nodded again, then settled down to watch them play chess, idly flipping through his book. Finally, Mrs Malfoy looked up at the clock.
“Very well then. I'll escort you back to the common room.”
“I'm so going to regret this.”
“Does it work?” Pansy asked.
The candles were nearly burnt out when Harry was jolted out of his bored stupor. Over Lockhart's prattling and the scrubbing of Draco and Millicent, was a cold, hateful voice.
“Do you think you're funny, offering to take a ghost to the hospital?” she asked tearfully.
so much as we might not need to as often. Still, we should go up sometime this week to find out what their next password will be; no point losing that knowledge. But perhaps it's time we tried sneaking into one of the other Houses.”
They entered the Great Hall to find most of the school there already. The house tables had been removed, leaving a long stage that ran the length of the hall. Greg and Vince cleared a path through the crowd so that they were standing next to one side of the stage. Harry waved at Hermione and Neville on the other side, and was relieved when they both waved back.
“You wouldn't hurt him!” Daphne gasped.
Snape stood there with a stack of schedules, which he started handing out. “Mr Potter. Managing to keep out of the paper today, I see.”
“My mother died when I was a baby, too. From having me, actually,” Theo said. “My father doesn't like to talk about her much.”
Harry's eyes widened. So that was why he'd been so out of it. He hadn't had the flu, he'd had Tom leeching off him.
“What the hell are you doing?” he shouted at Harry, before running out of the hall.
“Okay,” Harry agreed.
“Your aunt never told you?”
“Everyone's going to think we did it,” Harry said as he pulled a cup of tea towards him.
Hermione glared at his back before turning to Harry in mute appeal. He raised his eyebrows unhelpfully and followed Draco.
They followed the confused crowd back to the castle. They'd just reached the top of the stairs when Snape came stalking across the Entrance Hall. “Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy, come with me,” he said with an odd twist to his mouth.
“My father's been fired as a school governor, and he's going on trial next week,” he said abruptly.
“Hardly your fault,” Draco replied.
Beside her, Pansy rolled her eyes. “He's come to ravish you, obviously.”
“Harry?” Draco called.
“Lucius,” Mr Weasley nodded.
Harry gave a breathless, relieved laugh. “Good. Er, what do we do about that? I kind of promised to free it if it killed Tom.”
“You are not even,” Snape said after a pause.
Harry shook his head. “No, I'd like to see her. Actually, could you get some meat from the kitchen first? Maybe some of what we had for dinner tonight, if there's anything left over?”
“That's it,” Harry said angrily. “Pansy, you know everything about everyone.”
“– but there was no one else,” George finished.

She led the way to the Dursleys with Dobby bobbing along beside her.

“Because terrible things are happening at Hogwarts this year.”
, he thought. Not only did he like the green and white stripes, but they actually fit. That would take some time to get used to.
Hagrid shook his head. “Aragog escaped into the forest, and the attacks stopped, so that was that. I was lucky I got off with just being expelled and not sent to Azkaban, so I didn't wanna make too much of a fuss. And Aragog was happier in the Forbidden Forest than the castle.”
Pansy's eyes lit up. “Start talking.”
Five minutes later they had the heavy cage sitting on the desk in the office. Harry looked around the office with distaste. The walls were covered with portraits of Lockhart, all of whom were watching the three students with interest.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Tilly!”
“Just some batteries.”
It was only when the bewitched ceiling was showing the grey light of dawn that Dumbledore called an end to the feast. As the sleepy but cheerful crowds made their way to the dormitories, Harry tugged on Draco's sleeve.
Colin gave an excited whimper and wasted no time snapping a few pictures.
Miles consulted his notes. “Your friends, actually. Nott and Zabini bet on the Dark Lord, and Crabbe and Goyle on his mum.”
,” Draco said.
“It's wee Parselmouth Potter! Hiss hiss hiss, give a snake a kiss!” Peeves cackled, before he caught sight of the figures lying frozen. He came to an exaggerated stop in mid-air. “ATTACK! ATTACK! POTTER'S ON THE RAMPAGE! NO ONE IS SAFE, NOT EVEN A GHOST! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!”
Harry paused in the corridor to look up at the wall. Under the original message about the Chamber was another, written in a different hand.
“I can help you, Mr Potter, now just relax!” Lockhart said, showing all his teeth in a smile.
“As if you didn't love that, Potter,” came a voice from behind him.
Draco had stiffened a bit when Harry leaned on him, but relaxed slowly. “That's good.”
Ollie slithered a bit closer to them. “
“So I tied him up and hid him in the bathroom before I entered the Chamber,” Snape said blandly.
She straightened up and regarded him. “Hmm. Black looks good on you. With your colouring, I think you should also stick to dark greens, blues, greys, and perhaps some strong reds. Yellow is most definitely out, however,” she nudged the offending garment with her foot.
Tilly looked at him curiously. “Tilly can take sir's mail to his owl herself, sir.”
Narcissa nodded, ignoring Draco's glower. “Your relatives are over there, I'll walk you over.”
“Of course,” Harry said, startled.
As Harry took out his wand and tapped the wall that lead to Diagon Alley, Draco elbowed him. “She likes you.”
“Good, you're awake. I began to fear that I had drained you too quickly,” came a quiet voice.
“Go yell at Vince and Greg. At least our bet has some chance of being true,” Blaise said dismissively.
“Yeah, me too,” Harry agreed.
Blaise looked at Draco for a few seconds before answering. “Nothing, Harry. Nothing at all,” he said in a tone that implied Harry was being extremely thick.
Harry shrugged and walked over to Draco's bed, which had the curtains drawn. “Draco?”
Harry ignored the look Madam Pince gave him as he entered the library and focused on the students sitting in groups at the study tables. There was a group of Hufflepuffs sitting at one in the back, and Harry was heading towards them when he caught part of their conversation. He ducked into the row of books next to him and listened in.
“Try pressing it down more firmly,” Tracey suggested.
Snape looked down at him with a small crease in his forehead. “Draco, you cannot blame yourself.”
“Yes. If you stop trying to prevent me from going to Hogwarts, I won't tell Mr Malfoy what you've been up to.”
“Let's find out, then,” Harry replied.
Draco shrugged. “Well, the school's full of morons then. Have you heard of this Chamber before, Hermione?”
Justin Finch-Fletchley lay Petrified on the ground, his frozen face staring sightlessly upwards. Lying next to him was one of the oddest things Harry had seen. A ghost was lying next to him, floating a few centimetres off the ground. His head was hanging half off his neck, and Harry recognised him as the Gryffindor ghost, Nearly Headless Nick. He was no longer silvery and transparent, but looked like he was made of black smoke.
Harry rearranged himself on the pillows so he was facing Draco. “What did he say?”
“You think he managed to take a picture of his attacker?” McGonagall asked.
He carefully folded up his photocopy and put it in an old biscuit tin along with the pins, then stashed the whole lot under the loose floorboard he'd prised up. He flopped onto his bed and pouted at his ceiling. All his plans for the week were ruined.
Harry groaned. “We've been over this already. Even if Hogwarts is unsafe, it's still more fun, and more of a home, than the Dursleys' ever will be. So why are you trying to get me gone?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You have no idea. Draco's mad at me now, and I don't know why. Something to do with the Weasley girl, I think.”
. I think you'll enjoy that.”
Snape's eyebrows lifted in surprise. “A formal complaint? How... Unexpected.”
“Why do you need to pick locks anyway? What's wrong with
Draco sighed. “Yes, but I wanted to apologise to her. She started to come over to us during the fight and I had to make her stay away.”
“Nearly,” Harry said, hugging him back. “What were you doing in here?”
“Yes, Mother.”
They made their way to the gates so that Mrs Malfoy could Apparate them again, as the Manor was warded against it. This time, Harry knew what to expect, but he still didn't find it at all enjoyable. Flying was definitely his favourite mode of transport.
“An unlocked cage which also contained Lockhart's wand,” Snape replied.
They had time for a quick stop at a stationary store, where Harry picked up more drawing supplies, before they had to meet Mr Malfoy at Flourish and Blotts. They found this store just as crowded as Quality Quidditch Supplies had been, but this crowd was made up of middle aged witches. A banner in the front window proclaimed that Gilderoy Lockhart would be signing copies of his autobiography.
The next present was from Hermione. “New Quidditch gloves!”
“I'm so sorry,” Theo said immediately.
A few minutes later they were sheltered behind a rock overlooking the lake. Draco was busy pulling a picnic large enough for ten people out of a sack from the kitchen. Harry looked at Hermione expectantly.
. With the exception of Lockhart, every one of them looked worried. And furious.
“So get your book then,” Harry said.
“Teaching him Parseltongue?” Snape asked.
Hermione sighed. “I was meaning to come to talk to you both, after class.”
Theo nodded. “And Snape's deputy. It could be much worse, at least we've got two competent teachers in charge.”
“I guess it would be.”
He'd been feeling off for a few days now. He'd only smiled weakly when Dumbledore had  announced one breakfast that Lockhart would be indisposed for the rest of the week. He'd nearly fallen asleep during Defence, despite the fact that Snape had taken the class. Struggling to stay awake, he hadn't realised that Snape's lecture had systematically destroyed
The Beaters looked at each other. “Harry...”
“The problem is that I really don't want her meeting my father,” Draco said quietly.
He traded grins with her as the lock fell open.
Harry tried to flatten his hair over his scar as he shuffled even closer to Draco.
Draco sat still for a second. “I think I'm going to be sick,” he announced, and hurried out of the hall.
Draco nodded. “This was before the Statute of Secrecy, of course. Mother told me all about it; my father doesn't like to mention him.”
Mrs Malfoy patted the seat next to her. “Join us, Harry. Who's Ollie?”
“What's going on?” Harry asked Neville as they fetched their ingredients.
“Should we get his wand back?” Harry whispered. Two pixies still in a body-bind were clutching the wand between them.
Harry smiled. “Thanks. Let's go.”
Harry couldn't help the smirk that spread across his face.
“They were discovered in the vicinity of the library,” Snape said. “This was found at their feet; have you any idea of its significance?”
“Any language can be taught, Potter,” Draco scoffed. “In fact...”
“What just happened?” Harry asked as they set off for the Quidditch match.
“Yes! And then when we woke up we realised we were missing the feast, so we went to see if we could still make it,” Harry said.
Back in his room, Harry stared at his trunk in dismay. True, he loved his new clothes, but he hadn't thought of how he was going to fit them all in his trunk. And the Lockhart books took up more room than the rest of his books combined. Sighing, he started gathering all his things and putting them on his bed in neat piles.
“What's the problem?”
“Yes, sir. When I told Hermione that you'd told me a bit about my mum, she borrowed every book that mentioned both me and Voldemort. It was little creepy, to be honest.”
“Could you two
be the heir of Slytherin. And I've really enjoyed that so far,” Draco pouted.
Harry walked over and picked it up. It showed the three of them sitting by the lake laughing at something. As he watched, he saw himself throw a bread roll at Draco, who then tackled him to the ground as Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry watched the full loop a couple of times before putting the frame back down.
His breath puffs white through the air, forming a film of half-frozen condensation on his glasses. Remembering the wand in his hand, he casts a warming spell, easing the ache in his stiff fingers and keeping his glasses clear.
Harry tells his friends he's going away to "find himself"—a line he'd picked up from the cover of a travel magazine in Tesco—and leaves England for Egypt to apprentice under a cursebreaker friend of Bill's. In truth he isn't interested in finding anything about himself; he wants information, and he wants to live in a part of the world where no one will draw any conclusions about
Or maybe everyone else in the Wizarding World has it right, and he'll cease to exist after the Ministry's former pets rip out his soul.
He goes back inside.
Malfoy's grey, blinking eyes make a quick circuit of the room. They take in the small neat bed, the window-painting of the Manor's grounds, the privacy curtains, Harry. Harry, who kneels by the chair at Malfoy's feet, a hand still hovering between their bodies. Harry, whose face feels like it must be about to break from smiling.
familiar sensation of being dropped in a sound-proofing bubble.
His stag is nowhere in sight.
But the light keeps the Dementors away. Harry doesn't need them distant; he needs them dead.
The pendant
Harry pulls the handle.
Harry jams the knife into the Dementor's side, throwing his weight behind it, and nearly falls into its body as the blade pierces through the filthy black cloak and wedges deep inside.
Harry finds himself halfway down the steps before it registers he'd started moving at all, feet pounding against the stone, blood pumping heavy in his ears. He slips on a patch of ice on the next level down, rights himself, keeps going.
Kneeling at the end of a dim grey corridor, Harry unravels the final wards on a thick steel door. The magic disperses harmlessly through the silent hallway and he sighs, brushing a bead of sweat off his forehead with his shoulder.
Harry grinned. “And he was happy to see you replace Professor Slughorn as Head of Slytherin.”
“Bloody Ravenclaws,” Draco muttered.
Harry glared up at Lockhart before ripping the poster down. “You guys are all keeping yours up, aren't you.”
“Great, so it'll just be me then,” said Harry, ripping apart a bread roll.
“Nothing! I, ah, I wanted to keep it, actually,” Draco said, going pink.
Dobby looked at him suspiciously. “Harry Potter wants to make a deal with Dobby, sir?”
“I don't know... Snape, maybe? I mean, you can't possibly want to go back there next summer.”
“How much of this belongs to your family?” Harry asked.
“Given how much he wants the Defence position, he probably wouldn't take much convincing, either,” Harry mused.
Draco looked a little happier at that. “Good. I tried to find you a Parseltongue dictionary, but apparently they don't exist. The clerk I spoke to said there isn't a written language, which is just stupid. How can you teach anyone a language if you can't write it down?”
Draco spent all of Herbology ignoring Harry, despite the fact that they were working at the same workbench, and would only talk to Daphne or Tracey. As soon as the lunch bell rang, Harry took off for the castle, and was able to snag Hermione as she and Neville were making their way to the Great Hall.
“Huh, I didn't think about that,” Draco said, and scuffed his foot on the stone floor.
“He's not corporeal enough!” Snape shouted as Tom laughed silently.
Harry opened his mouth to further argue the point, but something about Draco's expression stopped him. “Whatever. Come on, let's get this over with.”
“It wasn't him, Headmaster! I was with him just before the attack, he had no time to do it!” Hagrid yelled. Dumbledore raised his hand, but Hagrid continued ranting over him. “And he
Draco snorted. “Trust me, she'll love that.”
“What do you mean, you can't be? Slytherin lived a millennium ago, you very well could be,” Hermione pointed out.
“Dobby?”
When Draco just stared at his mother, she sighed. “I'll explain it all when we get home.”
“You couldn't. We do change our passwords, you know, and boys aren't allowed in the girls' dorms,” she said at once.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine, a Galleon on Draco.” He handed his coin to Flint, and received a hand-written receipt. Draco grumbled before betting on Harry, and then they returned to their dorm.
“Infirmary,” Harry managed.
“What about it?” Hagrid's voice had gone chilly.
Draco shrugged. “Ask if I can take the credit? I like the idea of the school being afraid of us. Think how easy Quidditch will be if our opponents are too scared to come near us!”
********
“History of Magic. She used to fall asleep in class, I believe, and dropped the subject as soon as she was able.”
When they reached the stairs to Gryffindor tower they found Hermione sitting at the base of them with her head in a book.
“So, can you say something in Parseltongue?” Blaise asked as they made their way to breakfast.
********
“Oh, and Mr Potter. You can come to my office if something is troubling you. That is one of the purposes of a Head of House.”
“There we are now, Mr Potter. If you'll just try on this for starters. Keep anything that takes your fancy, and discard anything that doesn't in that basket over there.”
Draco wandered over to one of the bedside tables and sifted through the drawings on it as Harry watched Tilly pack his trunk. In just a few minutes, she had his books stacked neatly on one side of the trunk, with his tightly folded clothes on the other, cushioning his more delicate potions equipment.
Harry shrugged. “Doesn't matter.”
While the other three walls were painted a pale grey, this one had a large mural on it. It showed a lush green mountain with a forest in the distance. In the foreground was a large pale green dragon. As Harry watched, it lifted its head and stared at him.
Harry bumped him with his shoulder. “Git. Just admit you did something sweet.”
“Draco's right, that really is fun,” Pansy giggled.
Harry shrugged. “I'm a Parselmouth, sir.”
“You do realise that we could all practise on the pitch at the same time, yes? But feel free to continue your little pissing contest. Except for you, Theo. You've got big shoes to fill, and I won't be paired with a dud of a Beater. Grab a Bludger and come with me.”
Millicent shrugged. “I didn't. I just really want to see those two fight. It'd be amazing.”
“Indeed.” Snape's lips twitched as he held the door open for them.
Mrs Malfoy shook her head. “It slipped his mind, I daresay. No matter. That is a useful gift you have there, Harry. Now, am I right in assuming that these snakes will not harm us?”
“Anything at all? Something bothering you? Someone, perhaps?”
Harry jerked his head up. “You mean apart from most of the school thinking I'm evil?”
Hermione started climbing the stairs. “Weasley. He's a Prefect, and has already passed me twice. I could see him trying to think of something he could tell me off for.”
“Right.”
“Love you too, Mother,” Draco replied. His face was red when she eventually released him, but he looked pleased all the same.
When they got to the pitch they found the Gryffindor team already in the air.
“Who are you?” Tom demanded.
“Her?” Fred said.
Breakfast the next day was a subdued affair as the entire school discussed the latest attacks. Up at the staff table the teachers were all clustered in twos and threes over copies of the
“Good, 'cause this really hurts. Though it's still better than being locked in my room,” Harry mused.
When they walked in to the lounge, they found Mrs Malfoy staring into the fire, the chess board set up before her, and Mr Malfoy flipping through Harry's snake encyclopaedia. Draco took his seat across the board from his mother, leaving Harry to sit awkwardly next to Mr Malfoy.
“I dunno. Just... Something seems off about all of this. I don't understand how someone could have done all of this, you know? And if he's so good at fighting Dark creatures, why is he coming to teach at Hogwarts?”
“Please, between her and Creevey, it was hard to tell who's more in love with Harry. I wouldn't be surprised if she'd attacked Creevey to get rid of the competition.”
“Oh, that,” Draco grinned. “I tracked down Peeves and convinced him to come good on the favour he owed me.”
“I'm going to go get some more Pepperup. I'll meet you there?”
“Hermione,” Draco replied.
Harry stared at the birds as they skirted around the pond. He'd never seen albino anything before, not in person, and found the birds beautiful in an eerie sort of way.
“Can we not talk about this right now? It's the first day of holidays, and we've arrived with good music and sweets to save you from a tower full of Weasleys,” Harry said firmly.
“Er, yes, sir,” Harry said, still staring at the bird. It looked like a bald cygnet, and he couldn't imagine it ever looking magnificent. His train of thought was broken when Hagrid burst through the door, waving the dead rooster around so that feathers rained down in the office.
Obviously, the Valentine is from the books. I take no blame for that!
“Thought you might like some company,” Draco explained. “May I?”
Flint scanned it quickly. “Great. Training tomorrow straight after breakfast, tell Malfoy and Nott.”
“What the fuck?”
After Blaise had led Vince and Greg out of the room, Draco came over.
“Blood traitors?”
“I've told you what I think of you associating with that Mudblood,” Mr Malfoy spat.
No one does. Wandlessly, Harry places a discreet disillusionment charm on the curtains of Malfoy's partition before pulling them shut; then he casts
The light enters the pendant. Harry stares at it, his breathing harsh; then he sits heavily on the steps and folds over his knees with the light clutched to his chest, sheltering its warm glow from the darkness around them, and sobs.
Ron and Hermione would say it doesn't have to be his path, either; after all, Malfoy had been a spoiled, vicious bully, and Harry had spent years hating him. But Malfoy had felt remorse. True, bitter remorse that grew into pinched lines around his young mouth, that turned his grey eyes into a graveyard.
People at the Ministry
Draco hisses.
Or he might end up another breathing corpse in Janus Thickey, shoved in a bed near Malfoy's and forgotten. Shoved inside the same Dementor as Malfoy, too, going increasingly insane until the creature sucks out everything but nightmares and finally starves.
Instead of watching the Kiss through his own eyes, he had felt the familiar, sick, roiling sensation of watching through Voldemort's. Even knowing Voldemort was gone, that he'd died, the feeling only grew stronger and stronger until Malfoy's desperate last moments had come to an end.
Harry takes his time, pausing by each door in case the crystal needs time to react, but the dim blue light from the pendant holds steady as he makes one complete loop and starts up the sharp stairs to the second level. The burning-cold rime of frost coating the rails makes Harry's clammy palms stick when he rests his hand in one place for too long.
“Yes, but unfortunately for you, Hogwarts is not in the habit of giving detentions to idiotic professors,” Snape replied. “You will report to Lockhart's office at eight o'clock tomorrow night.”
They were in the kitchen corridor before Hermione caught up to them.
“Yes, she was rather better at adhering to rules than you are.”
“I wanted to explain about last night. Have you seen him?”
“Things?” Snape arched an eyebrow. “She became a Prefect in her fifth year.”
“Yes. They're something of a family tradition, though my father has improved the breeding program, I think. He no longer gets coloured peacocks, in any case.”
“Naturally,” McGonagall nodded.
A flash cut through the rain, and Harry looked up to see Colin Creevey emerging from behind his camera. Draco noticed him as well.
“I was rather enjoying having the school think it was me! No one's going to think that anymore if my own friends don't bet on me!”
Harry explained about his portrait friend, with Draco butting in with the snake's full name.
“Once Mr Malfoy was secured and hidden, I entered the Chamber. I found Mr Potter sitting on the ground, clearly weakened, as Tom Riddle stood over him.”
way.”
“Where's Lockhart?” Draco suddenly asked. Harry followed his gaze. Sure enough, there was an empty space up at the staff table.
“Yes sir.” Dobby smiled back and disappeared.
Every eye in the room turned to Harry.
“And I'm hideous, is that it?” Draco cut in.
“Good one, Crabbe,” Blaise said quietly. “Let's get to breakfast.”
Pansy grimaced. “Too bad guys.”
“Good. Managed to score a goal, actually, before the Gryffindor Beaters realised that both of ours were hovering around you,” Draco replied.
“Not yet. Are they any good?” Draco picked up the closest one.
“What would you know about it?” Harry asked bitterly.
Draco kissed his mother goodnight, then he and Harry did a final check in the room for any forgotten possessions. Harry picked up his book, but Mrs Malfoy hesitated before handing over the drawing to Draco and sighing.
Harry had to grab hold of Dobby to stop him hitting himself in the head with Harry's water jug.
Sure enough, Draco had perked up by the time they finished their sundaes. “I want to look at Quality Quidditch Supplies. Supposedly, they've got the new Nimbus 2001 in.”
All he'd needed to do was to get some instructions from the library. Then he could free Hedwig and send a letter to Draco, asking him when he and his mother were going to arrive to collect him. As he waited for a reply, he could've unlocked the cupboard under the stairs and taken his school things up to his room to do his homework. Instead, he'd spent his time reading Dudley's discarded books and drawing. He usually enjoyed that, but there were only so many portraits of Hedwig he could manage when she was glaring at him the entire time. Plus his pencils were starting to get depressingly short, and Dudley hadn't any others he could steal.
“Mother, it's this one.”
“Draco, I'll explain it all when we get home,” Narcissa repeated. “Harry, I am sorry. But I need to spend some time with Draco.”
“It was close,” Hermione interjected.
“Sir, your bird just... I couldn't do anything, it was too quick!”
They nodded.
“Thank you.”
Draco sighed. “I'll wait for you in the Entrance Hall. Just be quick.”
“Who better to ask about the Chamber of Secrets than the girl who's practically memorised
“Oh, sorry, I was miles away,” Draco replied, and sped up slightly.
“Sure.”
“Quiet, Draco,” Mr Malfoy snapped.
“Of course, Mr Nott! How else will you learn how to fight them? Now then, let's see what you can do with them!” With that he unlocked the cage and stepped back quickly.
The Slytherin common room was noisy when they eventually arrived, and Harry quickly walked into their dorm room and stopped.
He was therefore very relieved when he saw a grass snake poking its head out from the flowerbed. “
Dobby nodded his head, setting his ears flapping. “Dobby serves the Malfoy family, Harry Potter.”
“After I wrote back to my father,” Draco spat the word, “telling him Hagrid was innocent, it seems he was displeased. He's pressured the Minister for Magic into arresting Hagrid. He's taken him to Azkaban.”
“Me too,” Hermione smiled.
********
“That's just because he made you get your picture taken,” Draco smirked.
“But Potter's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear,” the redhead said. “How can he be bad if he did that? Plus he isn't a pure-blood.”
“Grab your new brooms and let's go.”
“A free elf?” Draco repeated.
“How many house-elves do you own?” Harry asked curiously.
“Not about that. He was just happy to get out o' the castle, to tell the truth. 'Sides, he couldn't have. The way that girl died, he couldn't've done it. An Acromantula kills someone, well, there isn't much of a body left to be found.”
“Nothing, sir! Dobby is not doing anything with Harry Potter's owl, sir!”
Draco smirked. “Ah.”
“Draco tells me you're becoming quite a formidable player,” Mrs Malfoy said as she seated herself opposite Harry.
“Well then, how about I play him, and you can watch him get thoroughly trumped?” she asked conspiratorially.
“Caught in the act!” he shouted as he pointed at Harry.
When Harry opened the door to his vault, Draco's eyes widened. “You're rich!”
“Let's see... Oh, Kettleburn – he's the one with one arm – and Burbage. You want one of them?”
Harry shrugged. “It wasn't exactly safe for me last year, either, but it's still more fun than here. I have friends there.”
“Huh. Hadn't thought of that. How do I do that?”
A look of distaste flashed across Tom's face. “You cannot imagine how dull it was listening to her. So dramatic and over-wrought, and yet she had nothing of substance to say. Until, that is, she began to write of her infatuation with the famous Harry Potter. She certainly piqued my interest with that.”
He opened his eyes and glared blearily at it before grudgingly opening it to see the note inside.
“And the mirror?”
Harry cut him off by jumping on him and giving him a fierce hug that half-buried him in the pile of pillows. He pulled back to look at the snake book as Draco sat up spluttering. Harry glanced at him before returning to the book. “Sorry, didn't mean to crush you like that. It's just, this is really thoughtful. I love it.”
The Great Hall was mostly empty when they arrived, so when they saw Hermione reading at the Gryffindor table, they joined her. She looked up, startled.
“Betting on who's getting drunk this year?” Harry asked with a grin.
Draco laughed. “Relax, Daphne, we've burnt all his old clothes. He'll just have to get used to the attention.”
sign it for you!”
“Yes. If you're unable to serve us without gawking at him we shall take our business elsewhere,” Mrs Malfoy said disdainfully.
Hagrid never did tell me why he was expelled... Harry banished the traitorous thought with a shake of his head. “No, he's wrong. Hagrid wouldn't do anything like that.”
Harry lifted his arm and considered it. “Sort of like really bad pins and needles at the moment. Pomfrey says it'll get worse, but hopefully I'll be asleep by that point.”
“He was attacked on the stairs,” Dumbledore said.
,” Harry said apologetically.
“Oh, good,” Draco said and relaxed back against the pillows.
“Indeed. But the point I wished to make was that Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth; that's why the emblem of Slytherin House is a serpent.”
“Hear what, Harry?” Draco asked.
Soon they had all the pixies rounded up in the cage. Some were immobilised from the boys' spells, while some were simply knocked out by Millicent's book.
Harry stared at him dumbly as Draco gasped. “What?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “I really need to do something about that. That's so Ravenclaw.”
Draco let out a frustrated sigh. “I'm trying to write down the Parseltongue I know, since it's hard to just remember it all. I've been writing it down phonetically, I guess you could say, but I think I need to make up some new letters, because some of the sounds don't really fit any of ours.”
Hermione darted a look at Neville and sighed. “He's jealous, Harry.”
Harry tried not to let it show as he felt his heart sink. He'd been looking forward to going back to Malfoy Manor for part of the holidays.
“I believe this conversation is entirely theoretical at this point,” Snape interrupted.
Draco rolled his eyes as they stepped through the entranceway. “So you're never using the actual password again?”
********
“Come along, Mr Potter,” Snape said. Harry swallowed a sigh and followed in silence as Snape led him through the deserted hallways to his office. He sat down behind his desk and waited as Harry sat nervously before him. “What was that?”
to say anything, Minister,” Draco snapped, and Harry realised that the man in the suit was the Minister for Magic, and wondered what he was doing here. Fudge turned red at Draco's answer, but Dumbledore held up a hand.
,” Draco muttered.
Harry led the way downstairs, and stopped outside the cupboard. The shouting in the lounge had quieted to a heated discussion.
There was movement at the far end of the Chamber. Squinting through the darkness, Harry could make out the tail of a very large, bright green snake. It whipped around a column as the basilisk chased after Snape, who was ducking behind a different pillar. He waved his wand behind himself without looking, causing more rocks to fall on the basilisk, but it just slid through them as it gained on Snape.
“What?” Harry looked him.
He watched through barely open eyes as the basilisk looked down at the floor. Tom stopped laughing and made an abortive lunge towards the diary, but it was too late. One of the basilisk's fangs pierced the diary as the giant snake's head slammed into the ground. Two of its fangs broke off with the force of it, one of them lodged in the diary. The book began emitting a high, unearthly scream as torrents of ink poured out of it. Tom writhed in silent agony, clearly screaming as he jerked around, before he disappeared.
“I've tried telling both of you that you've nothing to feel guilty about,” Hermione began.
A pop announced Tilly's return. “Here is your broomstick, sir.”
“Fascinating,” Draco said. “Let's go.”
She smiled down at them before clearing her throat. “Better get a move on if you want a good compartment.”
Harry looked away from the mirror. There were large puddles over most of the floor, and a pile of soggy towels in the corner. “I, er, I'm not very good at swimming, and I made a mess, so I tried to clean it up but then I ran out of towels.”
“But Mother...”
Harry looked at him. “What for?”
“How'd you get in?” Blaise asked at the same time.
“Er, well, it is my favourite subject, sir,” Harry said, slightly embarrassed.
When he was a couple of metres off the ground the Snitch levelled out, and Harry forced his broom after it, grimacing through the pain. He pulled his left hand reluctantly off his now slippery broom handle and reached for the Snitch. As his hand closed over its fluttering wings, he over-balanced and he went tumbling forward. There was a fresh, bright stab of pain through his arm as he hit the ground, and then he passed out.
“I am saying nothing, Mr Potter, except that you need to add those starfish to the potion.”
Draco picked up a large box of sweets from his mother. “I am now.”
Draco put his arm around him.
He didn't think he could have imagined a place that they were less likely to shop at. The clothes inside were outdated and crushed messily onto the shelves and hangers, with no organisational system he could figure out. There was also a pervading smell of mothballs. He frowned and moved closer to Draco as Mrs Malfoy stood in front of the dingy counter.
Harry led her back to the compartment. Ginny paused when she saw the look Draco was giving her, but then Neville waved and she smiled back.
“Yeah, okay. But still, I changed my mind about him pretty quickly. This guy just seems like a massive wanker.”
“Because I have taken him into my paid employ, and expect him to dress appropriately,” Narcissa said.
“Excellent. Harry, how about you? Draco's told me the two of you have some sort of shopping pact?”
was a Muggle-born! And one of my best friends is, too! You have Herbology with Hermione, right? You really think that Hermione would hang around people who hate her? Unless, of course, you think she's as dumb as you all seem to be. So why don't you all just shut up about things you have no idea about!”
