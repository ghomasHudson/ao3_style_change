It was the second time, the second! in that week he was called by the Headmaster. Didn’t it pass through that feeble-minded fool’s head that he had work to do? And as if that weren't enough, now he had to make a potion for the Dark Lord that took 15 long days to prepare, all because Potter wanted “daddy” to see him play Quidditch.
– Thank you. Yes, I'll leave before it gets dark, but I'll be back in a couple of days – Harry looked at him with insecurity for a couple of seconds and then scooted over to make room for Draco to lay down. Draco looked at him surprised and rapidly turned towards the door – Don’t worry about him. Come on. – he said extending his hand for a couple of seconds before he took it.
They laughed happily but Harry noticed a couple of more insistent looks than the others. He looked up just in time to see the twins watching him seriously while the others were distracted, but when they were discovered they smiled faintly. Harry knew there was something else, but he had no idea how to find out, so he did the only thing he could: pretend nothing was wrong.
"I'm not sure my Lord, but that won't stop me from trying to win his heart," he replied with assuredness.
"You don't disgust me, Potter, I just wanted to annoy you. But I don’t think this is the time. Besides, I must clarify that I don't hate you, I doubt that I’d ever really hated you. Don’t worry about the memories, they are none of my business. And just so you know, I won't leave! Not till you have calmed down and sleep, the rest can wait.”
"Don't want to play with fire Potter, or you can burn – he whispers in a low voice but still followed.
– Nothing Harry, you'd better go to sleep, it's late. Get some rest. - The two said, and they left the room.
An hour later he was bored so he asked Kreacher for help in fixing and cleaning the Mansion for when Remus arrived. At the time he was finishing up the living room but he was so sweaty and dirty that he preferred to take a shower so he could wait for the blond and they could eat together.
– Don't even joke that I'll leave this degenerate in the same room as my godson. If he wants to stay in the Mansion, he'll sleep in the living room," he said with authority.
He came slowly and crouched down, took Harry's face, and raised it. He felt his heart break when he saw all the pain on Harry's face. He cleaned his cheeks, looked at his sad eyes, and without being able or wanting to avoid it he gently rested his lips on Harry's and then lifted him into his arms. He felt Harry cling to his chest and weep. He sat on the couch and settled the brunette on his legs while still hugging him and stroking his hair.
"Calm down Sirius or I'll get you out of here," Remus said as he approached the bed, "Kreacher was too upset and only babbling something about that he shouldn't disobey you but we had to come and see you," he said, worried, stroking Harry's head, who was still lying on the blonde.
Harry was lying down with his bag ready in bed, thinking about the way to tell his friends and family the truth. He feared their reaction and possible rejection, he did not want to be seen as a monster or as the son of a monster; he loved them like the family he never had and if they turned him down, he didn't know what he would do. On the other hand, there was Draco, he knew he was leaving for a couple of days, but he couldn't help thinking that he wouldn't see him and that he was going to miss him. It was foolish, he knew it because they had only been friends for a few days, but he was by his side when he discovered his origin and recovered the one he believed to be his only living relative; besides that, Draco had accepted him even being the son of who he was and he had promised that he would help him bring his parents back, or rather his dad and Lily. If he was honest with himself, he had already grown accustomed to his presence and he would need it those days.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. LOL
When he finally finished his torture, Harry avoided his father's gaze; He didn't want to see his disappointment at him being so weak.
Draco was nervous, he hoped he hadn't gone that far. He was about to retract when he saw Harry smile sweetly and nod before he spoke.
"Harry, we really thank you for everything you've done for our family," they said together, "for worrying about Ron in freshman year, for saving Ginny in the second, for saving Dad a few months ago and forever being there for us but...
"What the Headmaster wants is for none of us to oppose the decision he made to end the war, convincing us that it was better for all because they were no guarantee you would survive the war. – Fred said.
Harry felt like they were already stepping on dangerous ground and knew there had to be a change of conversation before something happened, except Ron got ahead of him.
Harry watched them for a few seconds weighing the veracity of his words, but since he found nothing he had to give up. He turned around and went up the stairs to his room.
He was going to approach Remus to see what was happening to him when a gentle purr was heard next to him. He turned to the couch and was shocked. After several minutes that seemed to him to react, but all he could do was squeal a couple of times before shutting his mouth again when he saw
"But we don't want you to stay," they said together, "the best thing for you is to start distancing yourself from everyone. We don't want to see you suffer any more than you already have Harry, you don't deserve it after everything you've had to live. We couldn't do anything for Sirius but now we won't leave you alone, you can trust us for anything you need.
He heard screams and laughter, but he remained unbothered, all he wanted was to get to the Quidditch pitch and look for Draco.
His pain was so great that he was unaware of his magic pouring itself free until he felt himself being violently shaken by the shoulders, but he didn’t react until he heard his name being shouted in despair.
Tom narrowed his eyes watching the boy for a few seconds. He should have calmed down a little bit, after all, he didn't want to hurt him, he was just hugging him.
When he walked into the room, Malfoy stared at him. He knew he hadn't put on fancy clothes, but he wasn't in a mess either.
Harry who was astonished at the way Draco, a Malfoy, was humiliating himself, kneeling in front of a wizard, frowned with annoyance listening to his last words, and interrupted him scandalized.
Tom looked at them one by one, smiling with contentment seeing that they were willing to defend his son, but when his gaze fell on Sirius he winced in disgust.
Voldemort entered the library and walked proudly to the desk to take a seat. He looked at the Malfoy boy standing halfway, who looked at him with respect but also with determination. He kept watching him for several minutes and was pleased to see the boy's mettle. Analyzing it, he realized that he was very good-looking, with class, education, wealth, his family belonged to the highest social circles, and in addition to everything, he was powerful, very powerful. He had not overlooked the fact that he had broken his spell, something no one had ever done, not even his father. He had a faint idea of the whys of his magical potential but had to consult it with Lucius. Now that he thought about it, he didn't seem so bad for his heir, but the boy didn’t have to know that; he wouldn’t make things easy for him. Beforehand he would have to prove he was worthy of his son.
– Very well Mr. Malfoy. Tell Potter I want to see him in three days. Contact Severus when I give him the time and place – he turned to Severus – I want you here early tomorrow Severus. Now out, both of you.
"Severus Snape," his aunt said with contempt as he felt Draco become tense, "I just told him that you'd gone to the house you’d inherited since yesterday morning," she ended up nervously.
Sensing no danger, he decided to transfigure the chair into a comfortable armchair, and settling down with his book on his lap, ready to spend a few good hours reading.
– Thank you Dobby. Then I'll see you tomorrow. When I'm ready, I'll call you back." Harry was very happy. Everything was going well for him.
– Si-Sirius – he gasps as he threw his head back exposing his neck more – stop... we-we need to talk about Harry.
After meeting his Death Eaters and planning an attack near Hogsmeade and a couple of other places Tom was left alone with Nagini.
"I know, but it's going to have to be at Hogwarts, it's almost time to go.” He looked at the blonde's lips “and now kiss me again because if all goes well, we'll see each other only after supper” - that said, he attacked the blonde's mouth with passion.
Voldemort was impatient, it was almost twelve o'clock and there was no sign of Severus, he was about to call Nagini to find out what was taking so long when he saw her slide through the door.
Draco felt harry settle behind his back and his heart was filled with relief and joy at the same time, feared being rejected a second time. He turned quickly and caught the brunette in his arms, squeezing him tightly as he stroked his back comforting him.
He felt his eyes watered, but he wouldn’t give them the satisfaction to see him devastated and alone. Before anything, he would find out what he could about Dumbledore’s visit, and then he would have to choose.
After Severus researched his mind and found strong barriers and false memories, he feared that everything the letter said was true. So, he asked Severus to destroy the barriers and eliminate false memories, but he hadn't felt or remembered anything different so Severus used
Harry not knowing what to do just proceeded to follow her. What they didn't know was that there were two people listening to everything.
Severus got up fast and looked at the man kneeling on the floor crying, he didn't know what he could do, he had never seen the Dark Lord cry. That man who looked so pathetic and weak on the ground didn't fit with the Lord he knew. That behavior was typical of Hufflepuff boys or even Gryffindor, in fact, Potter would be so pathetic to cry like that, but not...
Draco nodded slowly but said nothing. He wasn't worried about Severus or the owl, he was worried that Harry would leave in a few hours and he would not see him for two days. He didn't want to be without Harry, but he needed to go out and see his friends, start preparing the ground for when he decides to tell them the truth. Although he didn’t know how to feel about that since he imagined that when they learned the truth they wouldn’t leave him alone, they would protect him all the time and where would that leave him? Harry would probably notice he doesn’t need him and would abandon him to be with his friends.
He turned a corner and saw another wretched soul coming at a bad time, but what could he do if they were putting themselves in front of him, rather than taking advantage of it and removing some frustration.
"Well, I didn’t; They both penetrated the defenses of my lair and I still don't know how it was possible," he said with annoyance.
– I don't know what you're laughing at. Do you like being watched from behind? Because let me tell you, my creep of a cousin didn’t miss the opportunity," Harry said, annoyed by the blonde's attitude.
– Well, I think you'd be safer here than in that place and if what's stopping you is the lack of company, well... I could stay with you for the days you have left before you go with the Weasleys. If you want to of course. Besides, don't worry about me, without my mother and father in the mansion, I don't feel like being alone either.
When he arrived, he violently opened the door with a wand movement and they entered a gloomy corridor, following the murmurs coming from further into the house.
–Thank you! –  Malfoy smiled and embraced him causing a slight shudder in both. -I have to go now.- Harry returned the hug automatically and when he reacted, he cleared his throat and walked away.
Harry fell asleep at about the same time his head touched Draco's comfortable legs. He watched him sleep, stroking his cheeks and playing with his hair, even though he also felt tired he couldn't help but start thinking about the turn that things would take from now on. He was nervous, he felt that his chance with Harry would fade if they didn't accept him because they were more important to the brunette than he was and worst of all he couldn't blame him if he decided to put him aside.
Does anybody else want to punch Ron's face? NO? just me? Alright then. And can Fred and George be any more amazing! I love them.
"Don't think that about him," he smiled kindly, " You still don’t know Harry enough, but I can assure you he won’t leave you when he is with Hermione and Ron again. – he saw the surprised boy in front of him and hurried to finish before he scurried off – Before you say anything, remember that I am a werewolf and my senses are sharper – he winked at him.
Harry continued to assimilate the information he had just received and from what he had heard from Hermione and Ron it was very likely that they were telling the truth, but still...
Harry was surprised but closed his eyes when he felt Draco kiss him and enjoyed the caress. When he heard the disappearance, he lay down on the couch while waiting for Draco to return.
He turned and nodded in the direction of another elf, seconds later a goblin appeared in front of him who asked him the letter for verification to which harry handed over immediately.
"I'm sorry, that's what happens when you spend the whole summer locked in a room," he said with a half-smile, "but when I get back on my game you will end up worse than me – he added with sufficiency.
The first one to wake up was Harry, something had woken him up, though he didn't know what. When he opened his eyes, he forgot the noise he had heard because with great shame he realized that he was clinging to Draco’s shoulders while he felts the warmth of the other around his waist. His face was so close to Draco’s neck that he could feel the warmth that emanated from his skin and his mouth watered just imagining what it would taste like, it looked so soft he had an urge to touch it. He raised his gaze for a few seconds and saw that Draco slept profoundly, that’s why he believed that if he touched him, he wouldn’t wake up, and it would be just a small graze.
He looked at the twins, who looked at him with a serious expression, and then looked at each of the family members sadly before returning their eyes to Fred and George who looked at him with pity but still shook their head. Harry understood what they were trying to tell him, he lowered his gaze and put a wall around his heart and raised his barriers.
Draco watched him while he served himself and he realized that if he didn’t take out the conversation Potter wouldn’t say anything.
"Harry you must understand that things are not easy for the family at the moment and that everyone makes the decision they think is right  – they came up to him and put a hand on each shoulder and looked at him fondly – but we too have made a decision we think is right.
Remus, Sirius, and Severus only swore quickly and turned around to avoid looking at a naked Harry Potter from head to toe, but some blonde was unable to react like the others and only kept devouring Harry's body with his eyes; his eyes were fully opened and he was opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water.
– Both are obvious Potter. I've felt the black magic since I walked into this hallway, they're all books that contain black magic. I can remove the spells, but the question here is not that, but... would you be able to read it? – he asks with curiosity.
"Come on” Draco rose with a sigh and held out his hand. “Let's go down to eat” They came out of the brunette's bedroom, but before they went out through the portrait he turned and looked at those beautiful green eyes. “By the way, now we're officially boyfriends, at least inside Slytherin” He winced and went into the common room. “But that does not mean I will not hex anyone who gets inappropriately close to you, so warn your little friends”. Having said this he kissed him in front of the whole common room to let it be clear that Harry was his and anyone who wished to harm him would suffer a slow and painful death.
– What I don't know how to explain to him is what really happened with his parents. I have no idea how he'll take it or if he'll understand – He let a sigh slip away.
Harry gave a frightened yelp and with sheer reflexes turned around and pointed his wand, to the twins who promptly raised their hands.
Tom knew part of that was his fault, so he didn’t have any other choice than to relax and hug the boy in his lap.
– What's wrong Potter, don't you recognize me? –  he asked with a mocking grin, making his eyes shine mischievously.
"It's not necessary–" he was quick to answer when he saw the brunette come down the stairs like a tornado.
"Like you little cousin?" he asked malice – It shows that you are not worried about Harry, you are very preoccupied with that book.
Sirius grumble at hearing the word “cute” in the same sentence that went to “Harry and Malfoy sleeping together” that he couldn’t take it anymore.
– Never mind, I don't keep any feelings to them. It's just that there I experience a lot of sad things... I don't know how I should feel.
"Wow, it looks like we're not in the mood today," he said with a half-smile as he moved his wand, throwing a
Half an hour later Harry had sent two letters, one for Remus and Sirius and the other for his father.
"Well, since we cleared up that part and you've already sent the letters to your father's friends, we should read that book to find out what we're going to face when Professor Lupin looks for you–he saw Harry nod and continued – but what I want to know is if the Muggles you live with won't give you any trouble because you left home.
Harry woke up with the sun bathing his face, he was very hot, so he decided to take the time to take a walk through the grounds. He got up quietly, put on his glasses, and dressed, then went out the back of the house into the garden. He spent about half an hour thinking about what Draco would be doing at the time and whether he'd remember him.
He smiled arrogantly before pulling Harry around the waist and bringing him completely to his chest, looking at the blonde.
Even though Sirius didn't see Harry like that, it didn't mean he didn't care who approached his beloved godson. So, since Moony didn’t let him mess with the Malfoy heir he would at least observe his behavior to know what his intentions were with his little prongs.
Harry was stunned. Was he listening to his parents say they would separate their soul? He didn't quite understand what that meant, but if it was black magic it was a very dangerous thing, but he couldn't help but feel something warm on his chest knowing they'd done it for him.
Remus was going to nag at him for not taking things seriously, but the protest died on his lips when he felt a wet tongue running around his neck, and without thinking, he put his hand on scrambled hair getting closer to him. He heard a shocked giggle for a second before they sucked the side of his collarbone.
his brain was screaming, but he could do nothing but get lost in those silver pits until he felt a slight rub of lips near the corner of his mouth. He let out a little gasp. He saw him come in and smile, he was about to ask what the hell all that had been, when he spoke.
"I'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong, Malfoy, the letters aren’t for them, they don't even know I'm not with the Dursleys. If they knew, they would have told Dumbledore where I am and I'm sure they would have found a way to force me back with them. but what I have to do is very important and dangerous to waste my time, so I will do it alone, after all...– Harry stares at him deciding whether or not to trust Malfoy.
Everyone was silent as the selection went on, Harry didn't look it, but he was dying of nerves. He swallowed saliva when the last student passed, saw the Headmaster get up, and fake surprise when he was interrupted by the selecting hat.
– All right, then give me half an hour. I'll go up for my wand and go to the Mansion for a change of clothes and come back to help you with the enchantments... and to be here in case things get out of hand- he saw that the brunette was going to protest, but shut him up before he spoke- I know you can't say anything about what you are doing, I'll just be around in case something happens. Just for that, so calm down—The blonde explains, raising his hands in a sign of surrender.
– I... well I...– he started nervously – I would like to try to approach my... Tom – seeing his family's faces of wonder he rushed to clarify – I just want to give him...
– Sure, but first let me see how things are. I won't risk taking you to him without knowing if he hasn't changed his mind," he said, swallowing saliva at the prospect of coming back head-on with that being.
He turned around and disappeared down the aisle before everyone reacted. Harry smiled like a fool and said goodbye to everyone to get up to sleep.
He got rid of his hug gently and looked Harry in the eye. He wiped his tears and took him out of the room by the hand.
Exhausted he dropped back into his armchair, though he still had to think what he was going to do with the son James had with that filthy mudblood.
"Sorry Young Malfoy, I just came to see if you needed anything and to offer you tea and cookies – Dobby watched him restlessly.
- "I hope he’s been given many years in Azkaban," he said, knowing that while that was what he wanted, it would upset Draco.
"Apparently there's someone who's finally going to keep you inline since not even Remus, Dumbledore or myself couldn’t – he said happily – from what I see, I think he was the only one who also kept James in line. What I would give to have seen that – he kept laughing.
"Well, don’t let me stop you. I have many things to do, and besides … - but he was interrupted by the adults.
"Of course, my lord," he said with some obeisance, " – and with what pretext would I present myself to the Headmaster?
Harry Potter lay in his room at number 4 Privet Drive, being punished as was common, after the death of his godfather. Although his punishment was recent, he did not feel the difference since he had spent the time since he came back from Hogwarts without leaving his room. Only to do the chores around the house, eat, and go to the bathroom. The only difference was that now he was forbidden to eat for the rest of the holiday, which would last two more weeks; but that was no problem for him because he had the brilliant idea of changing a few
Malfoy watched him closely. He still had a trail of tears on his face, his eyes were slightly swollen and his nose was red.
Frustrated that he had agreed to the voice of his conscience, he sat on a brown sofa. He would try his luck with the letter, maybe his parents would tell him how to open it. He was comfortable, just what he needed to read the letter his parents had left him. He looked at the envelope once more and let out the air he was holding, opened the ochre envelope with trembling fingers, unfolding the scroll.
1. The little joke was brought to you by yours truly with authorization from the original author. Like, come on! you always have to make that joke when you can. XD
He gently lulled him as he murmured words of comfort, after a few minutes Harry's crying diminished and he raised his gaze and look at Draco.
He kept up with those increasingly depressing thoughts until he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up.
“b-but how did you know? " asked Harry, horrified that someone knew his secret—why didn't you tell me at the time?
"Of course not, and Draco knows it, it will just push the other Wesley’s and Granger away.”  He looked at the ground. “I don’t know about the others in Gryffindor but first I want to give them a chance.
"Weasley", he spat furiously “I always knew you had no brains, but at least I thought you had wizard's honor," he said coldly, "there's nothing lower than to attack from behind” he looked with contempt at both boys – “Potter, let's go.” He placed a hand over his shoulder, and they left through the portrait.
– Consider yourself warned, young Malfoy. If you dare to hurt my son, I will make you know hell in life – he saw the boy swallow with difficulty and nod – very well, if that was all you may leave," he said, sitting elegantly behind the desk.
– Whatever the reason, you'll be fine. Don't worry – Harry turned around and pulled an object out of his robe – take this with you. It's a portkey The Order gave me at the end of this course in case I needed it and it will bring you straight towards Grimmauld Place.
Draco groaned when he felt the dark-haired man's lips devouring his mouth, which Harry took advantage of to strain his tongue and start a delicious battle that was logically won by the blonde. He felt in the clouds and the caresses of Harry all over his chest did not help his palpitating heart. They separated agitated but satisfied and when they looked at each other they smiled.
So, Voldemort finally knows that Harry is his son! And their encounter is approaching. Will it go as planned? Although Harry being Harry, I doubt it. And Nagini is certainly my spirit animal. LMAO
Harry felt he was stabbed with every word that came out of his old best friend's mouth, but he refused to show it and kept quiet.
A minute later the room protections fell, Draco quickly sat up and with the book under his arm he left the room and headed towards the kitchen. But when he got to the kitchen, he could only hear Potter telling the elf to let him walk around the house but to take notice of what he did and what he touched while he followed the Black family loving elf to a room. Draco got to see just before they left the hallway an envelope in Harry’s hands. He let out a sigh of frustration and returned to lock himself in the room.
– Yes, Harry. He's your godfather and Professor Lupin – he watched the tears run down the Gryffindor's cheeks and gently cleaned them.
– They don't care what happens to me. I'm sure they think I'm going to stay here in the mansion, and that's why I haven't come back. On the contrary, if I return, they will be disappointed to have me at their home again – ended the brunette with indifference.
– Don't worry about that, Harry, I can handle Severus. Now let's get your stuff and get out of here.
"Of course not my lord– he paused and mentally took a big breath of air – I understand. Potter is young, powerful, and very handsome, it's normal for you to want him without a scratch. The fun wouldn't be the same if he were hurt—he mentally prepared for an hour of merciless torture, but the result would well be worth it or so he hoped.
"Perfect, wait for him at the entrance and tell him I want him in my room as soon as possible and you better not delay more or you'll pay for it – that said he turned around and went back to his room.
– Enough! "Draco had never been embarrassed as he was now. – that's my business; besides Harry is my friend and we have just established good friendship; I won’t lose him because of this – he said with determination.
the brunette could reciprocate his feelings. He broke up with enormous willpower because he knew there was still a lot to talk about.
– I... I am sorry. He was very tired, and I told him to rest while we waited but I didn't hear you come out, I’ve best wake him up," he said nervously.
Draco was upset that he was surprised with his guard down, that was unforgivable for a Malfoy and all because he was thinking about the Gryffindor's delicious body, but he was going to get payback when he returned, well, if after meeting the dark lord he came back alive. But he couldn’t let Severus know with whom he had been these days, so, he hid his emotions like a proud Malfoy before replying to his godfather.
"Of course not, the important thing is that you're okay," he said, getting up with his Harry in his arms, "I'll take you to your room so you can rest.
"I'm sure he'll want to know how my day went and whether I've gotten information from you or the others," he said, going that direction.
"Wow, Harry, I must say it doesn't sound very far-fetched, but my dear boy, I don't know if it will work," he said, leaning back on the chair. “Because for that you'd have to give up your friends, we both know what Mr. Malfoy thinks of Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger. I don't think you'll be able to withstand Mr. Malfoy's humiliations. Without adding that you will be seen as a traitor throughout the school” – he ended up staring at him.
When they came out of their shock, they had the decency to blush and cleared their throat drawing attention to them.
He let out a barely audible sigh and pulled the doorknob. He stilled where he was standing. In front of him was a beautiful image.
"You know Draco, I have a mission for you–he saw the boy tense and smiled – but that shouldn't worry you, is not at all difficult. Although I must admit that my original plans have changed, so for now I'll just ask you to find out if you can access Mansion Black and...– he stood in front of the boy and looked him in the eye – to befriend Harry Potter when you return to Hogwarts.
"Draco what the hell is wrong with you," Blaise said, shaking him, "or you control yourself or I'll kill you before the Dark Lord does," he said annoyedly.
– He regretted his last sentence when he saw a grimace of pain across Malfoy's face but in the next second it was gone; instead, there was an unemotional mask.
After a heavy silence, everyone took a seat at the table, with Harry next to the twins and Ginny. It was only a few minutes before everyone was engaged in different conversations, but he had a lot to think about and decisions to make. It wasn't until he felt a slight touch on his thigh that he realized the twins were talking to him, but when he was about to ask what was going on, Fred discreetly slipped a small scroll in his pocket and whispered: "before you go." He watched them confused, but they went back to their talk, so he disguised the piece of parchment and bit his tongue for his stupidity in reading "we have to talk, it's urgent."
"That, dear, deserves a little toast – she came back with a couple of drinks and gave him one – to us? she said raising the glass.
Draco knew that his godfather was chasing him, but he didn’t think he would go that far to know, that’s why he cursed his own stupidity when he felt the characteristic pull of an apparition.
"Of course, it's me Harry–Sirius whispered hurt by the rejection of his godson– ask me what you want, and you'll see it's me, but please don't reject me. – he ended begging.
That said, he moved the wand slightly and the three men protecting Harry flew out in opposite directions and were immobilized on the wall. Harry was only able to watch their family get rid of, unable to do anything, but his protest died on his lips when he saw that he was not hurting them.
He saw with great satisfaction the horror, surprise, and hope cross the face most feared by all the wizards of the magical world.
Harry fell to his knees to the ground in shock. He didn’t even notice when he was thrown out of the pensieve. He laid on his knees on the hard ground with a perturbed gaze. He didn’t’ know he stood like that until he felt his cheeks moisten and he lowered his gaze watching his tears fall uncontrollably. This had to be a nightmare, he couldn’t be the son of that, t-that… monster.
– I, Draco Lucius Malfoy Black, heir to the noble and ancient Malfoy house, ask your permission to woo your son, Harry James Riddle Potter, heir to the noble and ancestral house Slytherin – he finished bowing his head with respect.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Grammar nazis assemble. XD I'll get to them eventually.
Draco looked at him for a few seconds without being able to believe what he was asking, but then he sighed with frustration knowing that he couldn't deny him anything.
"As helpful as ever, Severus," he said mockingly," let's go now, I have a family of poor little weasels to torture.
– That doesn't matter now. I'm going to change. After, could you accompany me to the library? I’d like you to help me with something if you have nothing else planned of course? - Harry ended up insecure.
He would surely cruciate that snake one of these the point of exhaustion. Voldemort squirted his eyes dangerously causing a shudder in his "guests."
– Harry dear, you had us worried. You're hungry? – she said putting a plate of toast in front of him.
Draco waited for him sitting in front of the fire and waving at the others he went to sit next to the blonde, who wasted no time and drew him to his chest in a hug. Harry huddled and yawned tiredly.
to help me," He saw the perplexity in everyone's face and the bright smile on his son's face. He let out a low growl –" Stop with that silly smile Potter; We will see who’s laughing at the end". He saw his son's smile widen and he look at him ignoring the attention others were giving them, "You'll see how
"If I were for me, I would sleep with you every day," he said with regret, "but we can't, so enjoy the minutes you have me at your side Potter because they are unrepeatable. – he spoke with sufficiency. – Many would kill just to be in my arms as you are now and …
“Eh... I” Draco cleared his throat looking at Harry “Can trust them, but you must be tired, go to sleep” he came up and gently kissed his lips. “Until tomorrow.
When he had everything ready he decided to look for Hermione, maybe he would find her alone in her room and without Ron's presence, maybe he could interrogate her and see how far she was willing to go through with handing him over, hopefully, he could trust her. He went out and on his way to her room but met the twins in the corridor, who beckoned him to come closer.
– Why can't I tell anyone anything? What is the important thing you have to give me? Is it about my godfather's inheritance? – Harry had been so immersed in the situation with Malfoy’s mother he had not realized how anxious he was to get the information he would get today.
"You won't be alone," he said, holding it firmly holding his chin, "you're my only son, and I won't let them hurt you again," he saw the surprise mixed with joy in his eyes, and he couldn't help but feel something warm stay in his chest—As to what you're going to do, well, I think we can formulate a plan, but one thing I’m sure about is that you’ll return to Hogwarts. I won’t permit my heir to be a good for nothing. – he said warning him with his gaze.
– That's too bad, I came to see what I could help you with. I suppose you'll be very worried about Harry and you don't want to know what he's doing at the Burrow," he said, turning around, but I'll leave you alone, I'll see you at dinner.
"I suppose that if he has forgiven me, who not only took away his family, but also destroyed his infancy, don’t have the right to demand to know your reasons, but – he got up a nailed his gaze unto the gray ones of the young man kneeled before him, who had a cautious hopeful glint. – that does not mean that from now on I won’t watch out for his happiness and safety, so – he walked around the blond before stopping in front of him. – Yes, I will allow you to court my son – the gray eyes brightened immensely – But you must know that if you aren’t HIS happiness, you will step aside and allow him to be happy  with someone else. – those gray eyes darkened for a couple of seconds before a determination that he hadn’t seen in a while and that and that made him remember with sadness his dear James.
He took out his wand and kept the last memory in the jar and then store them all in the box along with his letter. He went to the door thinking he had to read that book as soon as possible, Merlin! he had so many things to do. But before all that he had to do what his father asked him to do in his letter: contact his godfather and Remus, although his countenance declined a little because he knew he would not receive an answer from his godfather.
– Stand down now, I need to think. When I need you again, I'll call you and there's no need to say what's going to happen to you if this gets out of here, Severus.
– Of course, he’s okay, you don't have to worry about that. And regarding the fact about them pestering him- he let out a small chuckle – well that’s more than probable. – he saw as he clenched his fits and frowned – But more or less interrogation from Hermione’s part- he turned and walked towards the door and added – just so give you some peace of mind ill tell you that Harry does not like Ginny, at least not in that way, she is like a sister for him.
–Well yes, but Hermione was not the one who confronted Quirrel in the first year, nor the one that killed the basilisk and destroyed the diary in the second, nor the one in the cemetery being tortured, let alone the one that had to fight you alone in the ministry, besides … - but he interrupted himself when he saw the paleness on his father’s face. – Hey, are you ok? – seeing as he didn’t reply he shook the man’s shoulders.
Draco didn't even flinch. If Harry didn't get here soon, he'd go out looking for them at that moment and bring him in chains if necessary. Luckily for both, it was not necessary as at that time Severus came in followed by Harry and his belongings.
An hour later Harry came down to the dining room and met Malfoy for breakfast. He knew sooner or later he would have to deal with the situation, but he preferred later rather than sooner. However, he had no escape, the blonde watched him from the table. He cleared his throat to divert attention from his face because he was beginning to feel the heat rising down his cheeks.
"You know that if I want a mother back, I have to please him. Besides – he looked at Severus and smiled- Maybe I don't mind being friends with Potter, after all, who doesn't want to be friends with the Boy-who-lived.
"Sorry Draco, I didn't think it was so important to you that I gave you my trust. And you're right, the burden they've put on my shoulders is too much and I can't just do it, but I feel like I can't trust anyone, not even Ron and Hermione. I'm afraid that when they know what I've discovered they will hate and repudiate me. I wouldn’t be able to handle that Draco, they are my only friends, the only ones who have shown me affection and I don't want to lose them – Harry was crying when he finished talking.
They were all in the dining room, they had finished eating and now they were fixing the last details of Harry's weekend, who would depart in a couple of hours towards the Burrow.
– My lord, I know you are looking for Snape... I just came to tell you that he sent me an owl a few minutes ago saying that he would be a little late but that he would soon arrive and …
"I think it's best if we continued this another time," and then he added aloud – Guys, Harry doesn’t want to bet that Ron will test our new product. What do you guys think?
has very strong emotions. But this time it was worse because his emotions changed drastically – he ended up thoughtful.
"My lord," he bowed, "I have just returned from Malfoy Mansion, but I fear to tell you that Young Malfoy is not there. The elves have told me that he's been missing since yesterday and that he’s only back for a few minutes to pick up clean clothes and goes back without saying where.
"You're right, Harry, we'd do it for you too," they said, and they both looked at each other before they nodded.
Harry was surprised that the blonde did not take his letter, but even more so by his words. He didn’t think it was that important for the blonde that Harry trusted him.
Harry looked at the gray eyes like molten silver and came even closer. He felt their breaths mixing and a huge desire to try Draco's lips again. He felt the blonde's hands slide down his waist and closed his eyes for a second before feeling Draco's warm lips on his own. The kiss was slow, each trying on each other's lips, a soft kiss that showed their love for each other. When they separated their lips, Harry was blushing.
Draco reacted by hearing his name in the brunette's voice. He looked at him on the floor and he saw his eyes with tears, so without thinking he knelt at the same time Sirius approached Harry worried about the state he was. But seeing Lucius' perverted son hug him and look at him with distrust his fury returned with force and he said with menace.
The next morning almost everyone was ready and in the dining room for breakfast, the only one missing was Harry. They heard footsteps on the stairs and turned their heads, the adults released an exclamation when they saw it, but Draco was breathless. Harry was just irresistible.
Harry left half an hour later with the promise that as soon as he had information, he would immediately bring it to him. Smiling he headed to the common room.
"I think you shouldn't worry, I doubt that Severus will take it out on you and you won't personally deliver the message to Voldemort," he smiled halfway through knowing who would take the punishment.
Greetings everyone. TGIF am I right? all thought with quarantine the days don't matter much anymore. *cries* ANYWAYS! We come to enjoy fanfiction to escape that, NO? so enough about that. Enjoy the chapter.
"It wasn't my fault, go take it out on my uncles! -  He said frowning, giving the stranger a defiant look. He didn’t like people mentioning his size or his body missing a few pounds. -Besides, who are you, and why have you invaded our house in such a manner? – he asked taking a step back.
"He doesn’t know Moony," he handed out the letter with sadness, "but we must return as soon as possible. I knew it would hurt him for me to die in front of his eyes, but my little Harry is devastated, he blames himself for my death, and I don't want him to suffer anymore because of me.
Tom watched him at length, weighing his options. He got up and rounded his desk, stood in front of his son.
Everyone watched the exchange of words in amazement, but their eyes were exorbitant to the sight of Harry clinging to that man.
he kicked furiously at a chair and dropped to the ground crying heartbrokenly. He recomposed himself after a few minutes and set out to fix his things, he needed Draco as soon as possible.
"Yes, there will be many of us," he let go of his father, and he started counting on his fingers—Remus and Lily will be my uncle and aunt, Sirius is my godfather, Dad, you and Draco!" he said happily.
The blonde quickly left the room feeling nervous. He wanted to sleep with Harry but was afraid he wouldn't be able to hold back and end up doing something silly. He decided he would change in the room to avoid temptations.
The whole Great Dining Room was plunged into absolute silence and Harry felt all the looks nailed to him.
"Yes Father, I didn't mean to behave in such a manner" He embraced him tightly, but he knew that if he wanted a hug he had to ask for it. "We're alone, you can hug me please." He asked looking at him with tearful eyes.
Draco watched them leave and soon after felt the protections vibrate. He turned and looked at the adults on the couch, concealed his nervousness, and took a seat in front of them. They were held by the hands, lost in their thoughts; he looked up at the stairs for a second before clearing his throat and looking at the adults who turned his attention to him.
"Actually, very little, almost nothing," he said, "What is a fact is that the boy is too depressed about Black though showing otherwise and from what I've seen things with the Slytherins are going well.”
They came out of the chimney with their bags in their hand. Sirius was so entertaining cleaning the ashes in the robe that he did not notice the scene in front of his eyes, but Remus, being a lycanthrope immediately sensed a scent that even though it was familiar did not belong to Harry. He was stunned to see a couple of young men lying on the couch sleeping peacefully. That wasn't weird, the incredibly weird and almost impossible to believe was who those couple of guys were.
"But if that's true, and you've joined You-Know-Who," Neville said, looking at everyone, "I'm sure you would do it to protect us and not to betray us. That wouldn't be you, you'd never leave us, right guys? – he asked with certainty.
"This time you'll get away with it you insolent brat and you are lucky I don’t crucio you but remember there won’t be a next time. – he said giving him a warning look.
"o-of course, m-my lord– he cleared his throat before continuing – I will apparate as close as the wards let me.
– Okay Harry, we believe you. After all, we don't think Malfoy likes to share," they said in unison and let out some giggles when Harry blushed.
"As soon as I found out about the Black Mansion, I'll let you know, for the moment I'm going to rest – his voice had no inflection making it difficult for godfather to know what his opinion was about what he had to do.
But it was interrupted when Potter came out of the portrait followed by the professor. Severus looked at them all and came out. Harry took a few steps to the place where Severus had come out, he had forgotten to ask if he could send an owl to his father when a spell passed him near his head and soundproofed the room.
"Well Harry, taking advantage of your charity," they said with shame, "we'd like you to take this with you," they extended a couple of shrunken trunks out of their pockets—they're important belongings that we knew they wouldn't miss.
Slowly, he placed the fingertips on his neck by sliding them from his ear following the line of his jaw. Inadvertently he had come closer to him until he touched one side of his neck with the tip of his nose, he smelled so delicious that he couldn’t stand the urge to try it. He pulled out the tip of his tongue and slide it by drawing circles on exposed skin feeling a shudder through his spine. He was so lost tasting the taste of the blonde's skin that he didn't realize draco had turned his head even more exposing his neck until he heard a groan coming out of the blonde's throat. He quickly broke away from his neck feeling the heat rise through his face and he noticed with relief that Draco was still asleep, so as he could, he got out of the blonde’s arms and headed straight towards the bathroom. He needed a cold shower at once.
Remus smiled pleased at the attitude of Lucius' son and after calming Sirius he approached Harry hesitantly.
– Not true. I found something, but you were so focused I didn't mean to bother you. I think I found part of the ritual to put the Horcruxes together with the body. Look, he held out the book and then got up to go get some water to the kitchen.
Tom stopped a growl when he heard the last name, what did blondie have to do with his son? He had barely found out he had a son and that pompous brat was already thinking of taking him. He had to take matters into his own hands as soon as possible.
But he didn’t finish talking because a loud noise rang behind his back. When they arrived at the place where the sound had been heard they only found a small box of carved wood.
"I don't think it's that big of a deal," but he stopped when he felt Draco's fingers caress his cheek.
After a too tense breakfast for their taste, they went out to "have fun". Even though it seemed that they had been in the wrong game, because the one they were playing was "watch Harry" and not a simple Quidditch game.
Tom felt uncomfortable for a moment, but as he looked at him in that state he could only squeeze him against his chest tightly, wishing with that act to melt him with his skin and keep him protected always.
He quickly bought the dinner stuff and come running back to spend some time in the park. He was sitting on a swing, in the same park where a year earlier he had been attacked by dementors, eating a slice of pizza accompanied by a cola soda when he heard for the second time in the day the sound of an apparition, but this time it was closer. He got up fast and pulled out his wand watching around him but saw nothing, the park was lonely, a good time to attack him without anyone noticing. He felt the adrenaline rush through his veins as he waited for the slightest movement. He expected to be attacked at any moment by dementors, Death Eaters or Voldemort himself; but what he did not expect was to see a domestic elf walking directly towards him, dressed in an old rag piece and with huge brown eyes; he wasted no time and raised the wand pointing it at him. The elf stopped when he saw his reaction and cleared his throat, somewhat nervous.
He turned and saw Angelina, Katie, Neville, Dean, and Seamus running towards him. He immediately tensed, fearing their reproach. But he was surprised by a strong hug from Angelina and Katie and received two loud kisses that made him blush.
I was worried about Harry, I wanted to know why he had ended up asleep or passed out or whatever, but he also wanted to think about how to proceed in front of the Lord. When he sent him to the bathtub with ice water he had time to think about what had happened a few hours earlier. He should not have kissed Harry, he overlooked the ancient pure-blooded traditions, and the Lord had been within his right to do what he did and even more. But he would fix it as soon as possible, because, if he was sure of anything it was the fact that he wouldn’t let anybody get between him and Harry.
– If it were up to me, you wouldn't leave this room, brat. But Dudley didn't want to go out on the street, he says he heard a very loud sound in front of the house -. He turned around and left the list on the bedside table and before he left, he added — You have half an hour to return—and slammed the door.
After saying this, he directed his wand to the center and uttered an ancient spell. He watched the haze glow dimly and a second later both the haze and the protections glowed with an intense gold that blinded Severus for a moment. With a lazy wrist twist, Tom broke the guards into a thousand pieces by cementing the foundations of the mansion.
The blonde was surprised by the sudden hug, but when he felt his shirt getting wet with the brunette's tears he could not contain himself from holding him tightly in his arms, sitting him on his lap so that he could vent.
“Well, then I'll see you in a few weeks. Let's go, Severus.”  He got up and to Harry's shock and surprise, he took him by the arms, lifts him up, and hugged him tightly. “You better take care of yourself or all the
– Harry, who is that man? – he looked at him from top to bottom hiding his envy. “and where did you get those clothes? I don't think Dumbledore would like you being accompanied by some stranger and...
"Nothing, obviously," he shrugged, "I'll tell him that we're barely getting to know each other and that I need more time. See you in the common room? – he asked looking at him.
"Excuse me, my lord – he manages to articulate when he got up – it will never happen again – he looked him right in the eye and added, "I hope you will understand me if I tell you that I just wanted to make sure you didn't hurt Potter.
Harry felt as if the air had been taken out of him when he read the last sentence, something heavy settled in his stomach, oh Merlin, his father!
Harry frantically denied before turning aside to allow Draco to lie next to him. Draco laughed; amused by Harry's childish behavior and accommodating Harry towards him, placing him on his chest. Harry purred pleased when he felt Draco's soft fingers glide through his hair, soon after he fell asleep.
– Harry Potter sir, – his huge green eyes shone with emotion – Dobby is very happy to see him again sir, and know that you are well."
“Answer!” – he screamed, out of his mind “What's next? Calling Hermione, a mudblood? Or befriend that coward Malfoy?” – he asked getting closer to Harry.
– Seriously Malfoy? - He said slowly approaching him, - Then why don't you dress me? – He asks as he walked to the library, hips swaying.
Harry felt his stomach churn but showed nothing more than what was expected of him in this situation.
Tom disconnected from Potter's chitchat when the words "killed," "basilisk," "destroy" and "diary" came into his ears.
"I have to acknowledge the fact that Dumbledore protects Potter with everything," Tom said, feeling the magic signatures in the different spells that were weaving around the mansion.
Remus stared at Malfoy and decided to take advantage of the fact that he was finally alone with him.
"Well, I would too –he was closing his eyes and letting himself be carried away to dreamland – because only I must have you like this Malfoy – it was impossible to keep his eyes open – only I can hug you and I won’t let anyone else touch you. Now shut up and sleep.
They entered the chimney together and threw flu powders as he pronounced "Grimmauld Place Number 12".
They were all sitting at the table with faces full of sadness, indecision, and above all guilt. Dumbledore had left half an hour ago and had left behind a confusion, without escape. All were mired in unsettling silence, analyzing every word said by the Headmaster of Hogwarts. No one wanted to make the first move and the silence had already become unbearable.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. LOL
“All right, that's all. As soon as I have the training schedules you will be informed” he said walking with a happy brunette by his side.
Harry listened to Draco's words and was afraid they would be true, so he walked away with terror from the arms that held him and returned to Draco's arms.
"If you tell us he's taking care of you, he's dressed you, fed you, and he cares about you, we can wait," Fred said, sitting next to him.
"Mmm"— Harry knew he wasn't telling him everything, but he assumed it was personal things—I had to pick up my letter and memories on Gringotts,' he said thoughtfully.
“Harry Potter! Explain to me right now what's going on” screamed Hermione outraged and upset.  “You ignore us on the train, you don't make dinner and you don't tell us why and now it turns out you're going to Slytherin!” She said, raising her voice almost yelling at him.
in the Mansion I do not care where or what you have to do,  but get it and bring it to me as soon as possible – he orders with determination.
"I thought you would be throwing a tantrum for having to be Potter's bodyguard, what's going on, Draco? – Snape knew something weird was going on with his godson and wouldn't stop until he found out.
He knew he had to cross a few words with his obligated hosts, but he wanted to see his son sleep for a few more minutes.
"Don’t try to lie to my face Potter, why don’t you take a look at yours” he spat, conjuring a mirror and send it floating towards Harry violently, but stopping softly when it reached him.
Tom was about to come to the door when he heard a person running after him and knowing who he was stopped, but he was surprised when something small hit him and clung to his back.
"Is it about Dumbledore's visit?" seeing the twins' surprised face he rushed to clarify – I heard one of Ron and Hermione’s conversation, but it's clear that no one is going to tell me anything," he said sadly.
"I was not expecting that, but all the more reason we start with those classes young man," he looked at Harry's face of desolation, and added, "I'm not mistaken I assuming Young Malfoy knows Occlumency, maybe in his spare time he could help us show you tricks that will aid you in managing it sooner.
“Draco didn't do anything silly I'm sure Potter isn't looking for trouble. Please put the wand down and let's talk," he said, approaching the blonde.
"For your sake, Mr. Malfoy, I hope you didn't hurt Potter, or I'll have to punish you the way you deserve – he whispered dangerously.
1.The Word used was "CITA" which in Spanish is used for both Date, romantically speaking, or the more formal Appointment medical or business-wise thus the little teasing by Draco.
A throat clearing pulled them out of his fantasy, causing Harry to blush and let go of Draco's hands.
"I assume that you already know the reason for your visit, don't you, Mr. Malfoy? – he spoke slowly.
He said like it was obvious – “Plus that kid's a pervert, don't you remember how he had Harry when we got here by flu?! – He asks looking at Remus in disbelief.
-I know that after everything my father did to you and everything I've done at school to you and your friends, I don't have the right to ask you anything; but I'll still do it because I know you're the only one who can help me. If you want to know how I found you, I'll tell you. I asked my elf to follow you since you left school and that when you were completely alone and out of the protections of that house, she would take me to you-. In his voice there was not a single trace of emotion, it sounded empty, devoid of feelings.
He was trembling with excitement when he poured the last memory. He wanted to know how they had fared in their adventure. Before bowing down to see the last memory he made a mental note of searching the library for that book to read it as soon as possible because the truth is that he didn’t know what a Horcrux was.
"You knew from the beginning how this would end, and now you will have the opportunity to meet new people and forge new friendships and relationships," he said, looking at him.
Before he reached his table, he was intercepted by Fred and George who between laughter and jokes took him to a corner to eat.
"Enough Lads! " exclaimed Minerva “Miss Granger, take Mr. Weasley to the infirmary and when he wakes up tell him that he has detention with me all week ah, and 50 points from Gryffindor" she looked at Malfoy and continued "You are not out the woods Mr. Malfoy, although I thank you for acting on time that was not the way, 15 points less for Slytherin" she turned his worried gaze to Harry "are you well, Mr. Potter? she asks, scrutinizing his face and body.
Harry sighed understanding what the blonde meant. He knew they were right on one hand, but he couldn’t dispute those arguments, he was too tired and all he wanted was to sleep. He hated being tired all the time.
"Enough Black!" Draco screamed, which made both men leap –I know you're worried about Harry, but if he hasn't sent an owl, it's because everything's fine – he looked at Remus and added – Why don’t you both look for something to distract you until its time to sleep.
The sensations during his tale manifested as expected, from pain, sadness, and disappointment to amazement. But the emotion that stood amongst the others was Ire, the rage to those who had dared to hurt Harry, those whom he had considered friends.
– Ah! It's you – but before she continued, she noticed the presence of someone else and turned to observe it.
“Harry... I like you” he saw the brunette's surprised eyes “and a lot, I... I asked the Lord for his consent to court you,” he said waiting for Harry’s reaction.
“No Harry. You can't see what I see, but…” He got closer to the brunette and whispered, “You're beautiful.”
– That's enough! I'm tired of your games! Don't you realize that the Malfoy boy is in love with Harry? And before you answer me, let me tell you that Harry is in love too, but he hasn't figured it out yet, and when he does, I'll support them, and you better not mortify little Prongs with nonsense because you'll know me angry — when he was done he walked towards the door.
And that was all the great Draco Malfoy could bear. He collapsed on his knees on the ground weeping desolately as he begged.
"Be very careful of what you do Draco – he threatened and then let out a sigh of frustration – the Lord wants you to protect Potter and not cause him harm–he ended up in a serious tone.
– Of course not! "He said astonishing everyone and earning a warning look from his father that he ignored completely before arriving in two strides in front of Draco and raising him by the arms – no one will punish you, especially since I can imagine what kind of punishments you use. – he said looking at his father. – and ...
The next thing he felt was the sun's rays falling directly on his face and he knew he hadn't closed the curtains at night.
"Oh, come on, you deserve it too," Harry said, surprising everyone and Severus himself when he felt the brunette hug him.
Three days had passed after the meeting with Lord Voldemort and the four inhabitants of the mansion had already established a routine of eating breakfast, practicing, eating, practicing, having dinner, and sleeping. It should be said that the only ones who shared a room were Remus and Sirius, but Draco took advantage of the few moments he had alone with Harry to talk or just rest.
He came out of his reflections when he heard the door open and saw Draco standing in the frame watching him. He smiled and saw him walk up to him, but instead of dropping some joke like the ones he used to say, he kept quiet, staring at him, and to his surprise, the other began to slowly approach without separating his eyes from his own. Harry felt he was short of breath and his heart was beating fast
"Well Harry, if I didn't know we were talking about Voldemort, I'd think he's just a worried father, but I think this is a hysterical father – he walked to the boys and reached out to them and then smiled halfway through – apparently you just got your father's first scolding.
Draco didn't know how to take his godfather’s advice, but he'd think about it later. He walked to the panel that was hidden in his room and pull out a small box, smiled slightly, and placed it in his robe before leaving.
causing Tom's chest to swell with joy when he heard Harry call him father. Smirking slightly, he loosened his grip on his son’s wrist while he thought, “
Draco could no longer resist, approached him, and held him in his arms. Harry hugged the blonde hard, resting his head on his shoulder.
Harry watched them with surprise. If it wasn't for the fact that he knew Draco and his godfather were family, he would have suspicions about it; They were so similar in some things, they had even reacted the same way! The two were feral, saying how they would gradually torture them until they came to their knees to apologize to Harry, and only then would they be killed as the weasels they were.
– I don't know yet, maybe... Draco is the only one, apart from the twins, whom I can trust," he said, fighting the knot in his throat.
"We'd better get down before your godfather does, or we'll have trouble," he said as he took the brunette by the hand, "Kreacher! –The elf appeared and disappeared with the trunk –“ come on.”
"So, you didn't want him to hurt him?" he heard a  growl from his godfather but ignored him – didn’t you want to find him to kill him?– he knew he wasn't going to be well off this time, but he had to make sure, anyway if the Lord didn't crucio'd him then the good for nothing black will.
He felt everyone's eyes on his back until he couldn't stand it anymore and had to come down pretending tired.
"Yes Remus, thank you," he said incorporating himself. – “My fath.. is Tom still here?" He asked stirring in Draco's arms, who had risen along with Harry and hugged him in the back.
– Who-who are you? Remus, why are you coming with this person? Are you Remus? – Harry was confused and afraid of what was going on. I look into the eyes of Draco supplicant – Draco is it really him?
– Ok we'll do it your way. But I’m telling you right now that I will be very close in case things don’t go well.” his tone left no room for argument.
"Of course.," he said, he had to be careful with Black, "plus potions are very interesting, but you don't know what I'm talking about, so forget it," he ended up with a mockery.
– Harry, I know my word probably has no value being who I am, but I think the Dark Lord is no longer interested in killing you. "He saw the face of disbelief of the adults and added – There is something I did not tell you yesterday, the Lord... he gave me the mission to become your friend and take care of you all the time, from everything and everyone, I don't think it was necessary to tell me that if anything that happened to you I would pay for it – he snorted – as if I was going to let anything happened to you.
He closed the door with a spell and let out his tears. Their betrayal ached in his soul, but more when he saw that he was treated as if he were not being handed over to his executioner in a short time.
"Well if you don't want to tell us no problem, but if you ever have a question or want a consultation, we will be happy to help you," they said, laughing with rascality.
" you don't have to kneel before him either – he continued ignoring his father’s warning in the sign of triumph and gave him a look – if Severus wants to do it that is his problem but nobody here will. – he finished and crossed his arms in front of his chest with determination.
– Well, I still don't know how I'll help you if all I know is that you've been spying on me. What do you intend Malfoy? –  Harry asked impatiently. He needed to know to understand why the Draco Malfoy in front of him was very different from the Malfoy of Hogwarts; Although he was vaguely aware that it had been more than half an hour before he had left the house. - Come on, Malfoy, I don't have all day." Malfoy stared without changing his expression.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. LOL
What the hell does that mean? Harry was in shock, that was impossible. His father was a man, he couldn't carry a child, that was complete madness. Feeling the panic take hold of him he breathed a couple of times to calm down before reading further. Maybe it was all a big joke.
He felt uncomfortable in the same room as the snake and could not help but cast glances at her every few minutes. After about half an hour he thought that if she hadn't attacked him yet maybe she wouldn't, so he risked conjuring up his potion book with a gentle wand movement. The snake merely blinked before she snuggled up again on Harry.
"I see you slept well Potter," he diverted his attention to the toast he ate, "you look a lot better.
While it was true that Harry had learned much, Draco didn’t believe that he was prepared to face an intrusion of the Dark Lord into his mind. That is why he was silent when Harry received a letter from the Wesleys where they invited him to spend the weekend at their house along with the Granger Mudblood, delaying his inevitable encounter with the Lord and giving him more time to prepare him.
"Come in Severus –he observed the man move forward and closed the door – well, I need you to go with the old coot and find out what those ancient hands are scheming. There is something that doesn’t add up and I need to know that he hasn’t placed his wand in anything. * (2)
He felt a knot form in his throat and tears piling up in his eyes and preventing him from seeing the name of his parents clearly. He blinked a couple of times and looked up at the goblin to immediately directed it to the box. He gave a couple of steps but was interrupted by Griphook.
– Are you all right? You were sleeping well and all of a sudden you... I thought it was a nightmare, but then you started...
"You have no idea how delicious you look when you blush," Draco said, stroking both cheeks. “Harry, I think we should talk about this.”
Tom was immersed in his memories, so when he heard Harry call him between dreams, he couldn't suppress a smile. Anyone who saw him wouldn’t believe it; Lord Voldemort smiling like a fool as he hugged his sleeping son! He took the opportunity to observe him for a few seconds, he looked tired and had very pronounced dark circles. He could imagine that the stay in that dump full of weasels had been anything but pleasant. He decided that it was best to let him rest for a while, he had endured a lot of stress and changes in emotions. He got up with Harry in his arms and began to walk to the door. He frowned with annoyance, that brat was too light for his health, he'd have to keep an eye on him, the last thing he needed now was for him to get sick.
Draco couldn't hold out any longer, he had to taste his lips. He leaned slowly while staring at those beautiful green eyes, he could already taste his breath, but just as he was about to lay his lips something was heard at the window making them startle. They separated quickly and turned to the window to see a brown owl.
"All right, remember everything you learned, I want good grades, but above all, I love you safe and happy. Take care, son.”  and taking advantage of the twins not seeing them as they crossed all the people, he hugged him and placed a kiss on his hair.
Harry stared at the scene hoping to see something but could only realize his father's effort to avoid fighting his mother's invasion and expression of concentration.
"Oh come on Severus, don’t tell me you worry know like a surrogate father –he spoke with a sneer– but if you want to know I’ll tell you, I was at a friend's house and I plan to stay with him for a few days, it is too boring here.
He sighed once more, closed the curtains, and sat on the bed. He took the letter in his hands and opened it to reread it as his partner came out of the shower.
Harry knew he would never get his family back, all he had left lost to him forever a few months ago.
"Severus," he said slowly, but with an implicit threat that caused the one named to shudder slightly– you'll take me to the Black mansion right now and I don't care if you can't access it, I'll break all the wards of that old fool if necessary and those Weasley better pray that my son is all right because otherwise nothing and nobody will save them form Lord Voldemort’s fury! “
– Look Malfoy, first, I don't have to listen to you, secondly, I don't know what you're doing here, and I don't know how you found me. So you can go back from where you came from unless you want to have a magical duel in the Muggle world; and with you being the son of a Death Eater, who do you think they will take to
When he arrived at the brunette's room he opened slowly and was shocked for a few minutes before the scene that received him.
I'd have a family and a big one. He leaped crying with happiness to his father's lap and hugged him by the neck, ignoring his opposition.
The blonde listened to Harry’s calm breath and thought he should get up, but Potter's warmth was nice as was the feeling of his body in his arms, so he decided it wouldn't hurt to stay a while longer.
– Been a long time in the Mansion and you still don't learn what privacy is. What do you want? -  he was irritated by the scare.
Heya Guys, This was yesterday's update. I was kind of lazy and did not post. But here it is! Enjoy! XD
– No need, stay with me just... a little longer – he didn’t look up as he spoke feeling embarrassed.
a chance, but if things don't go well and he... he doesn't want to hear from me–he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and he said with regret staring at them—then I will fulfill my mission as the chosen one.
Kreacher watched his master cry silently, he was standing near the kitchen so he wouldn't see him. Gathering his courage, he turned around and headed to the library, but before entering, the door was abruptly opened by Draco.
– What?!! Are you crazy?!! – Draco asked alarmed –Did you not heard him? If you go to the weasel's house he will crucio both of us.
Tom dropped inelegantly into the armchair, totally defeated. He had no point in denying it, he missed his dunderheaded son and wanted to see him as soon as possible. He sighed with resignation, between his son and James he was going crazy.
Harry just nodded and together they left the room quietly and crossed the garden to the limits of the protections.
He didn't even look at them, he went up the stairs and when he opened the door, he placed Harry on the bed and covered him to avoid a cold.
– Mmm– Griphook turned and walked towards the back of the room. He traced with his fingernail a crack barely visible on the wall; took a step back and Harry watched as a small door appeared from which Griphook pulled out an ochre envelope. – Your discretion was an important requirement to be able to give you this—he held the envelope to Harry who automatically walked to the goblin and took the envelope with trembling fingers. - It seems to me that the letter I have just given to you and this box answer your last two questions, Mr. Potter– Griphook placed on the table a beautifully carved black box.
A few minutes later Draco watched Harry stir restlessly in his sleep and thought he was almost awake. He turned his attention to his book, but seconds later he began to hear an accelerated breath and a groan of barely audible pain escaped from the brunette's throat.
Draco was so lost in his thoughts that he didn't realize he had been left alone with the lycanthrope until he heard his voice.
Draco and Harry were each sitting in an armchair reading a book, outside the afternoon, was falling. Having eaten they returned to their reading and at that time was a blond with a nose buried in a book entitled "Ancient Spells of Pure Blood Families" seeking some mention of Horcruxes, while a brunette struggled to keep reading and keep his eyes open at the same time.
– What the hell is wrong with you Draco? That hurt you know- he looked at the blond in front of him and seeing as the other wasn’t paying him attention he got mad and added. – the least you could do is help me up, don’t you think?
Sirius looked him in the eye and when he saw his reaction, – What's the matter, Moony? Are you all right?” he asked him.
He came out of the shower dressed in worn trousers and a grey V-neck shirt, but he didn't see the blonde who ate him with his eyes from the bed because he was drying his hair with the towel. He let out a small sigh, it had been a long time if Draco didn't come back in less than an hour he'd go out and pick him up wherever he was. But a familiar voice took him out of his thoughts.
– I am sorry godfather, but for nothing in the world will I lose Harry, not even if it is the Dark Lord himself who stands in the way. And now that you know that what I said is true, I'm leaving, Harry is waiting for me. Feel free to be at ease here. Goodbye, godfather.
Harry was oblivious to what was happening around him, the only thing he could think of was his father hugging him of his own free will for the first time, so he did what every son does when his father embraces him: he returned the hug.
Tom was sitting in the living room looking thoughtful. He turned his wand distractedly as he held a letter in his left hand. The irony of this situation had not overlooked him. It was the second time he was in this situation, only that they were two different people and two kinds of feelings. He was so self-absorbed that he didn't notice Nagini's entrance.
you’ll be disgusted with me and if you know the truth you will hate me" Harry said in a trembling voice.
"Come on, the train's about to leave," he said goodbye to the adults with a nod and they both crossed the barrier.
They appeared in the fortress where the Death Eaters were and immediately went to the Lord's room. They knocked on the door and seconds later they came in.
–You don't have to do this; I'll be fine you shouldn't worry. The best thing you could do is stay with your family," Harry said, feeling guilty.
Harry felt that the skin where Draco was playing was burning like fire, but he couldn't react. He saw the blonde's hand come down his chest and let out a gasp when those fingers grazed his nipple, turning into little groans as Draco's hand was felt all over his abdomen.
– Dumbledore agreed that we will return on the condition that we monitor you and... well...you see – they stammered blushing slightly. – we wanted to ask you a favor, we don’t know if you’ll accept us at your house while we open our own business. – at Harry’s stunned look they hastened to add – it won’t be for long and of course not right this minute but we most likely won’t be back home for Christmas. – they said with regret.
"it’s alright Herm I am fine– He looked at Ron who had been behind Hermione and asked Merlin and all the Wizards that they didn’t betray him.
He was so focused on planning his movements that he didn't see the person coming closer, he bumped into something soft that immediately embraced him. He looked up bewildered and he saw Draco.
“So urgent that it cannot wait until after the selection? – she asked with concern looking at him with scrutiny looking for wounds.
“But what has happened here? " Professor McGonagall asked entering the classroom – "is that Mr. Weasley?! – she asked horrified.
He cleared his throat to catch the attention of his companion who opened his eyes surprised and straightened himself quickly.
Harry didn't know how much time he had spent looking at the memories, but he didn't get startled when the elf showed up with the pensieve. He was not aware of anything around him, he didn't even remember that Malfoy was still in the Mansion because he only had eyes for the pensieve. He asked Kreacher to deposit it on the table next to the box and gave him precise orders that no one was to bother him. That said, he dismissed the elf immediately.
They turned around, but before advancing a couple of steps Draco saw a hand fall on Harry's shoulder and turn him around violently. Without even thinking, he turned quickly and raised his right hand by pushing with his magic to the ungainly body of the redhead against the back of the classroom leaving him unconscious.
He finished reading just as he heard the shower go out. He kept the letter in the envelope and placed it on the bedside table. He lifted his gaze at the same time as a white, good-looking, tall man with long black hair and beautiful gray eyes came out. He was wrapped only with a towel at his waist exposing his muscular abdomen and tunned legs. He looked up smiling with rascality.
When it was all over, he knew that the hardest part of his entire stay in the Burrow was coming: Hermione's interrogation. He let out a tired sigh when she saw the look of her friend telling him clearly that they had to talk, so he prepared himself mentally.
"Yes Professor, but I need to talk with the Headmaster, it's urgent.” He said with the hope that she wouldn’t ask too many questions.
The worst part was telling them the truth about his real father and explaining to them why he wanted to try to at least be accepted by his father and have a family. That had led them to now as they sat together as they waited for his godfather and Remus to leave the pensieve.
"Well, if you know what's right for you, you'll stay away from my property if...– but it was interrupted by Harry.
Everyone sat there staring at the figure of the man disappearing down the aisle. The moment he disappeared from the hall; they saw the boy with unruly black hair hasten towards the hallway.
Hello Guys. I was supposed to post yesterday but my internet provider decided it was a great day to fix some towers. Lmao. We finally have internet. Now, here is the chapter for you to enjoy. Stay safe and happy reading! XD
"Oh guys, we didn't know you were here, everyone’s already asleep.” They looked seriously at Ginny –“You aren’t doing anything improper, right Ginny?
– I never enjoyed hugging my dad and now that I have you... just a little more, please. Besides, there's no one to see us—he knew he'd won when the body beneath him relaxed. He smiled to himself at how easy it was to achieve what he wanted.
"A few days ago, I got a letter from James. I didn't know who It was, but when I got my memories I got a box of them and that's where I knew you were our son," he said seriously, still boiling with rage for his foolish carelessness.
Remus paid no attention to them; his gaze was nailed to the top of the stairs. He wanted to go up and see his pup, but he had a task and had to comply with it, after all, it was for the sake of his pup.
– Young Malfoy asked Dobby to tell Harry Potter that he was coming soon and that in the meantime Dobby would take care of Harry Potter.
He appeared on the banks of the house and walked slowly towards the woman waiting for him at the entrance. When I got before her he smiled at her.
"Mr-Mr. Harry Potter," he said with a small bow, "My master would like to speak to you but he wants Twynki to assure him that you will not attack him." He ended up shaking and looking back. Harry watched attentively above the elf looking for someone but saw nothing.
A look that did not go unnoticed by Harry, but he decided to overlook it because at that moment Ron, the twins, Ginny, and Hermione entered the room.
"Harry dear," Mrs. Wesley said, looking suspiciously at the brown-haired man, "are you all right? I thought you weren't coming, and I was worried.
His body had changed. He looked slimmer, more muscular yes but slimmer. His skin ceased to be grey and dry to be white and soft, his nose had ceased to be two holes and now it was straight. His blood-red eyes had disappeared and now they were green, his ears ceased to be pointed and now they were smaller; but mostly he recovered his beautiful hair, which now looked a few shades lighter and wavier.
But Malfoy thought the opposite. Harry's trousers highlighted his slender body and his T-shirt left nothing to the imagination, highlighted his arm muscles and perfectly finely detailed his abdominal muscles, but what was wreaking havoc on his sanity were those whimsical drops of water that slipped through his hair following a line along his neck, getting lost in his chest.
"I'd love for you to stay with me for a few days – the beautiful smile he received in gratitude left butterflies fluttering in his stomach. He let out a sigh, that handsome blond would be his undoing – What do you think if we have dinner y then you go for your things at Malfoy manor while I go pick up my trunk at my uncle’s.
When he opened his eyes again, he was standing in the center of the living room or so he believed, his eyes were blurred by all the tears he was shedding. He could see Kreacher wringing his hands, but he was only able to deny in silence and utter a soft "I want to be alone" and without saying another word, he dropped to the floor behind the couch, hugging his legs and burying his head between his knees. He didn't want to accept reality. Just two days ago he had left the mansion, fervently believing that his friends would be with him, and now he doesn't even know if they had ever truly been his friends.
"There's always a price to pay Professor, I'm aware that I'm going to lose my friends but I'm going to make sure I win this war," he decided to end that matter once and for all, and he dropped the phrase that would tip the scales in his favor. “For the Greater Good.”
"All right, then let's save ourselves from idle chit chat and tell me what the hell does it mean that you and Potter are friends and I want to know the truth Draco because this means that you lied to me when you said you were at a “friend’s” house – he observed how his godson blushed and felt as he had been swallowed six feet under. – By Merlin Draco, tell me you and Potter aren’t …
–Well, even if it's not my business, I'll tell you that if I were you, I wouldn't be so sure. You know Harry has always been followed by both girls and boys, don't wait until you see him with someone else to decide because it might be too late," he said earnestly. Though he knew it was true, deep down he had done it to give the two of them a nudge. He had seen in Harry the same look as Malfoy and felt an almost similar smell, but that was something he wouldn't tell him, if he wanted his pup, he would have to earn him.
Draco was jealous, if he thought he'd separate him from Harry, he didn't know him, but one thing was to try to annoy him with that and another very different was to touch his brunette that way. He blinked in surprise when he realized what he had thought since when was Harry HIS? Well, that didn't matter anymore, what he cared about was taking those hands-off Harry's body before he lost control.
Any wizard could perfectly distinguish the sound of an apparition, and he was no exception. He turned quickly scrutinizing through the window and grabbing his wand tightly, ready to attack. But there was no one, after a few seconds he began to believe that perhaps being gone from the magical world for so long was affecting him, so he kept his wand just in time to hear how the padlocks were opened on the other side of his door. He turned as his uncle Vernon entered his room, looking upset and uncomfortable, he went straight to the point."Your aunt wants you to go buy her some things she needs for dinner," he said, staring at him.
- I didn't expect you to be able to without difficulty, but I'm just asking you to please listen to me," he said with regret. Harry fixed his eyes on the grays of Malfoy. His gaze was intense, so he turned his gaze away so he could talk.
"That our little sister is missing a screw and that something is wrong with our future in law – he smirked.
"Come on, Siri, we have to take the potion. “He looked at Harry. “Go get your trunk Pup” and that said he took Sirius's hand, and they went to his room, not without first giving a meaningful look at young Malfoy.
Severus had arrived early to perform the spell that would allow him to recover his body and after performing it and taking the potion he remembered nothing.
He felt the colors come up to his face because of shame and anger. He stepped with his arms outstretched to throw himself into the neck of that perverted blonde when he felt him being held by the arm.
"You may withdraw. – he fixed his red eyes on his spy before he spoke– Severus you and I need to talk.
"We'd better hurry, I don't think the Lord likes to be kept waiting," he said as he chose Harry's clothes, "I'll pick your clothes and leave them on the bed, then I'll go get dressed," he turned around with the outfit in his hands and placed it on the bed.
- It's okay Malfoy, I don't know if I can help you bring back your mother, but I'll try to—his eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope that made Harry's heart leap.
"My-my-my lord?" asked Draco paling which like a ghost and lowering the wand for a few seconds before falling on his right knee with his head down - I ask of you to forgive my behavior, I was not able to recognize you … I accept my punishment for …
Fred and George looked at each other with wide eyes. None of them believed that their little sister would go so far, although they were amused that Harry was so dumb and did not understand what their brainless sister was trying to say.
"Then I'll be with you forever," he said, smiling, "and now make some room. Unless you've changed your mind.
Harry watched the box with great interest for a moment and then turned his attention to the letter he held in his hand. Heart hammering in his ears, he slowly turned the letter, a strangled gasp came out of his throat as his heart beated in an unbridled fashion.
Severus looked calm, but he searched the streets for some sign of Aurors in the area or the Order of the Phoenix. They headed together into space between numbers 11 and 13.
Harry let himself be guided by his father inside the library and watched him take a seat behind the wooden desk. Not knowing very well what to do while being under the scrutiny of his father, he lowered his gaze while he bit his lip with nervousness and twisted his hands.
"Oh come on Siri, they're the same age and about being perverted," he smiled sideways, "I think you should remember what you do to me when we're alone," he said, shrugging his shoulders.
Harry felt Draco's gaze on him and gave him an embarrassed smile. Draco felt he was short of breath; that smile always wreaked havoc on him, but by gathering his self-control he managed to smile at the brunette.
“You know perfectly well that you don't have to do any tests” he whispered gently looking him in the eye “With you as a seeker the house cup will be ours.”
He passed his feet on the top of the bench and took a seat. He ignored everyone’s attention on him and looked at Zabini nodding in his direction to then look at the blonde and nod with the same courtesy knowing that all his movements were being analyzed by the whole school, surely expecting a fight or at least an explosion of rage on the Prince of Slytherin’s part. The blonde gave him a look of complete indifference that, while knowing it was for appearance's sake, still made him uncomfortable.
Voldemort hissed furiously. He didn’t know who had been so stupid to think they could pass through his barriers without being undetected. But, no matter how many enchantments and spells he used he did not find the origin of the spell so he examined the box more closely and felt his heart stop before beating agitatedly at recognizing the shield form the Potter’s.
– You have my word, my lord. But first I'll do my best to be with Harry," he said, looking him right in the eye.
– Oh no, guys! Don't tell me it's because of the money I gave you; If so, Mrs. Weasley will kill me," he said, really worried.
"You don't have to Harry," Dean and Seamus said, "We believe you; you would never do anything to hurt us, and we'd understand if you started thinking more about yourself," Seamus said, "you've always worried about us, and now you deserve to be happy," he ended with a smile.
Kreacher smiled with malice upon hearing the voice of his new master. If He didn’t know, He’d have thought he was quite a Slytherin, he wouldn't stop at anything or anyone else to get what he wanted. He nodded and disappeared with a
– You must calm down! –  Severus said, feeling out of place and surprised by what he had just heard, really surprised.
Harry took them, surprised that they sure of leaving their family. He then rose, followed by the twins, and without warning, he hugged them both trying to convey all the gratitude he felt towards them.
"Certainly, friend, if we knew anything, we would tell you, besides The Order has been very busy. There have been many attacks near Hogsmeade, and they never stay more than a few minutes – and then he added something with some hesitation after looking at Hermione– it even looked like You-Know-Who wants to keep them busy.
"Looks like someone's in a very good mood today," Draco said, smiling as he pulled a lock off his forehead.
. That was undoubtedly an image he would treasure for the rest of his life. But now he had other things to do and the sooner the better.
The streets were buzzing with people shopping, walking in and out of the bank, or walking with their families so that no one had qualms about that handsome boy with brown hair and hazel eyes who looked at the Gringotts Bank that stood imposing before him fascinated.
He glowered at the gargoyle before spitting the absurd password. He knocked and waited for permission to enter, seconds he took advantage of to compose his mask.
– Is something wrong? He just gave me the mission yesterday; he doesn’t expect it done already. And by for your expression Severus, I think something is going on – he said with caution.
Harry had to swallow the acidic response he had for Ron’s idiocy when he heard seven different voices exclaim Ron!, while he received a swat to the back of his head from his mom.
– Harry before you make a decision you should know that they have agreed because he convinced them that it was best for you and the magical world and if we are sincere we also think it would be best for you but... we know that he won’t kill you, but torture you and we won't let anything happen to you without first doing everything we can to save you–they looked at each other and continued—that's why we decided to tell you the truth.
He heard the elf disappear and soon after felt him place the protections around the room. He sighed, opened the book, and began to devour it. He would never accept it but that mudblood and he were alike in some ways.
Having been spying on Harry for almost every vacation, Draco was sure the brunette did not exaggerate.
“What's the matter, Potter? You even deign to answer us now that you're a crawling snake?” – ask Ron with poison in every word.
When they were all done, Remus who had noticed Draco's looks at his pup and decided to give them a few minutes alone, so he got up and approached Sirius.
“Okay Harry, now can you tell us who was that handsome man with you? – George asked raising his brows with insinuation.
"I don't need anyone but you, Draco," Harry said, kissing his lips again, but this time tenderly demonstrating his love for the blonde.
– Oh yes, the weasel and the know-it-all, took you long enough to contact them, Potter. In fact, I don't understand how they're not here with you if you’re inseparable," he said sternly.
"I'm just ... will Harry be ok?" he said awkwardly, "- I mean, maybe they are pestering him and … - he stopped, he didn’t know what else to say.
Harry felt his heart almost explode with joy as he heard Draco's words, but he couldn't stop crying so he just nodded on Draco's back.
– Of course I'm no pervert! But I can't say the same thing about others," he said, staring at the man in front of him, "right, Black?
He turned around and came out of the protections of the Dark Lord's fortress. He looked back a few seconds making sure he was alone, took out the portkey Harry gave him, and disappeared.
All that longing and pain for being himself the executioners, it turned to anger when he remembered how they had been separated. In his room, nothing had been saved from his fury and right then he swore to find and take revenge on those who had dared to separate him from his only love.
“Yes, yes, whatever you say. Now disappear, your presence bothers me," he said, waving his hand in the air without stopping his path.
Hope you enjoy the chapter. The next update will be on the 27th. I could post early but it all depends. Who knows? Maybe as a Xmas present. XD
"Voldemort doesn't seem to like the idea of being a father-in-law," Sirius said, gaining scathing looks from the others.
–We ignore their motives but do not let this bring you down Harry, it's important that you don’t let show what you know, or they will figure out who told you. I know it's hard what we ask of you, but you have to try. – George said and then looked at his brother and they both nodded. – Besides, we have decided to return to Hogwarts to support you and keep you safe while you are under the “care” of the Headmaster.
“Of course not little Prongs! You look great, worthy of a Potter and a Riddle, of course," he said, approaching him. “Let’s go have breakfast or we will be late” He pulled him with and made him sit next to him and in front of Draco, who did not take his eyes off him.
Harry wanted to believe, but he didn't want to get hurt if it turned out not to be true. Draco watched the brunette, saw his indecision and the glow of hope in his green eyes. He was so baffled by what was happening that he had forgotten a simple spell of recognition that his father had taught him years ago. He got closer to the brunets’ body to disguise his wand and pronounce the spell slowly.
He sighed in frustration at seeing the bulge in his pants. When he brought back his Jams, he'd make him pay for letting him in this state, he wouldn’t let that beautiful body for a week.
Lunch passed peacefully, receiving flattery from the purebloods for his excellent table manners, and blushing every time Draco looked at him proudly.
Nagini was furious as she glided out of the room, but before she left, she turned her head and glared at Tom.
"Draco!" he rose from the couch but the pain in his scar was unbearable, he felt as if his head was bursting.
Harry saw her disappear through the door and felt a huge urge to come in and sit with Draco. He fixed the school robe nervously.
Malfoy was so focused on his reading that he gave a little cry not very dignified for a Malfoy when Dobby appeared inside the room with a snap.
Tom nailed his eyes to the boy in front of him.  He smiled to himself seeing the enormous resemblance to his beloved James even though his eyes were green like his. He frowned, he had to correct his sight so that everyone could see that he had the eyes of his real father and not that mudblood Evans.
"Of course not Harry–she hastened to answer – if you don't want to, you don’t have to. What I'm saying is that I'd be more than willing to have a child of yours even if you decide not to marry me, of course, you can see it, I won't take it away from you but...
When he arrived, the twins were already there, sitting on a blanket they placed on the grass, they looked up when they heard his footsteps.
– Thank you Dobby. Just one more thing; it's very likely that later we'll have to appear at number 12 Grimmauld Place with Kreacher, but for anything in the world can you tell anyone where I am, let alone with whom, could you do that for me Dobby? – Harry observed by calculating his reaction.
– Draco Lucius Malfoy Black! Stop! – screamed a mad Sirius – Stop walking around the room! Don’t you see you are about to give me a nervous breakdown? – he said breathing rapidly.
Seconds later they were engaged in a discussion about whether Ron would try a Weasley product kit. The day passed quietly, with jokes from the twins and threats from Mrs. Weasley. After dinner, Harry would prepare to go to sleep but before he reached Ron's room, Ginny left her room and spoke to him.
Harry became nervous when he saw the look of the blonde getting closer and closer to him, until he was alone a few inches away from him. His gaze was gazing straight at him and he followed the moments of the towel as if hypnotized, which in that moment was drying his hair in that moment and took it.
"I'm sorry Professor, but he asked for it," he said in a tone that was anything but regret or apology.
"Stay with me just for tonight and if you want tomorrow you can ask Kreacher to fix you a room – he turned his gaze to the bed – The bed is very big and I promise I won't kick you.
" he screamed, “I thought I had friends, but now I see I was too naive," he ended up looking at them sadly, but he immediately was indifferent. “Well, goodbye Weasley, Granger “he nodded in their direction. “It was a pleasure to meet you … or maybe not," he said in a cold voice.
“Oh perfect! Then don't waste any more time and head to the dining room, the banquet is about to end.”
Ginny pushed Hermione and hugged Harry from the waist which surprised him a lot. He knew Ginny was obsessed with him, but it's never been so obvious. Everyone watched her and he felt very uncomfortable, but the twins came to his rescue.
"Nothing for now. If I need anything, I’ll call you. – he turned around and jumped on the bed willing to spend two hours of study, after all, it wasn’t every day you could access such an old book of potions that would surely make Severus green with envy. He smiled with satisfaction.
– You know well that treachery is paid for by death in my followers. But you've been saved for the simple reason that you know where Potter is, which makes me think that you know why I want to find him and therefore he knows I'm looking for him, doesn’t he?– he saw the boy nod and he continued – all right, now I want you to tell me if Potter would agree to meet me.
"Father, I know you have to go," he said, looking at him, "but first I wanted to talk to all of you about something I thought," he said, looking at them.
– Draco you don't have to pretend, I know you didn't expect this but that's what I am, I'm the son of...
He had decided, he would read the damm letter for the last time and immediately bring Snape to his presence.
But Severus knew him well and knew he had to play dirty if he wanted to know what the hell had happened in there and more when he saw that his godson had taken something out of his pocket, probably a portkey like last time. So he just followed him in his haste to get out of the wards and took his arm at the same time they disappeared towards Malfoy Manor.
"You know what he's trying to do and you won't tell me, but don't worry, I'm clear that Potter is now someone important to the Lord – he tried to get his words out with the most contempt possible- ill be seeing you godfather.
The class passed quietly, half an hour later Weasley and Granger came back, but Harry was not the least bothered, he was enjoying the class. By the end of the class, he had earned 50 points for Slytherin for being the first to transform glass into a beautiful white swan, Draco had been the other student who had made it and they both smiled mockingly at Granger looking at them indignantly and with a red face.
"Padfoot!" he felt his cheeks burning, "Draco is no pervert. He's my friend and although we've been alone and slept together is not what you are thinking, right Draco? – Harry looked at him and was surprised by the icy look he was giving his godfather.
He got out of bed despairing. He was choosing a change of clean clothes from his trunk when he heard the brunette come out of the shower, he turned quickly and smiled at him, but the smile froze on his lips when he saw him. He was totally wet and all he wore was a small towel strapped to his hips, exposing his flat abdomen and long legs. Malfoy gulped heavily watching Harry dry his hair with another towel leaving it messier than before and that just managed to turn him on more. He lost the battle when he watched Harry blush when he realized he was almost naked in front of him. He sent everything to hell and smiling he seductively got closer to the smaller boy with feline steps.
He got up and and left, with a determination he hand't felt in a long time, after all, he needed to start somewhere.
Luckily, the week had passed without incident, perhaps because Weasley was still grounded and Granger dared not do anything alone. But since nothing is eternal, on a Tuesday after potions Professor Severus had asked him to stay. He told him they needed to talk and that he would wait for him the next day in the afternoon.
Harry felt with deep sadness the falsehood in which she had been his best friend and under lower his gaze.
When they walked through the door, he still didn't erase his smile of satisfaction. He looked at Harry sand winked at him while smiling.
"For me, there is no problem, but I will be watching that NO ONE enters his room at night," Draco replied while getting up from the chair with the brunette in his arms, who when he felt the movement only curled up more against the blonde's chest – Good night," he added with annoyance.
Inside the ruined mansion, the Dark Lord walked furiously through the halls looking for Snape. It wasn’t possible that nobody had seen him all day and to worsen his temper Nagini still hadn’t returned from her hunt; they would both pay for making him wait.
When they came down, the adults waited for them with cups of tea in the room. Draco and Harry took their seats in front of the adults.
with all his might to look in the direction of the blond he knew had his eyes nailed to him, like all other students.
Blaise and Theo were in shock, their mouths open and their eyes like plates. They couldn't believe what their eyes saw, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter kissing passionately in front of them. When, for Merlin, had that happened?
Harry appeared with Dobby on the edge of the Burrow's protections. It was starting to get dark, so you could see the lights on, so he decided to hurry.
– Still, I have to read it, I can't wait. It has to be before I return to the Durley’s tonight.  - Harry ended with regret.
Blaise and Theo were baffled, they didn't understand what the hell was going on, but one thing was for sure, they didn't want to have that Draco as an enemy.
He squeezed his wand in anger. If only he had listened to James before all of that. He could have obtained power and prestige over time, but James, Jame's love was something he had at that time and he set it aside to follow his ambitions. He sighed with melancholy. That was the day someone erased their memories, the day he had lost him. But know he knew he was alive, roaming someplace; he would find him and they wouldn't be separated again.
"Of course, my lord, but if I may ask, what will I do when he has trusted me and is my friend?"– although his tone of voice was indifferent inside, he was concerned.
Draco turned around, approaching the brunet and hugging him from behind. Harry was astonished, but immediately turned and clung to the Slytherin's chest as the blond stroked his back. He soon fell asleep soundly.
At Black Mansion, the atmosphere was depressing since Harry had departed. No one did anything, all lost in their thoughts.
he was more sensitive to magic. Well, the best thing was to go out with his wand hidden just to avoid surprises. He took the list and his wand and left the house ready to take a good walk. The day, after all, wasn't so bad, or so he thought.
"You have a second to let go of me Potter or you'll be in detention all year round," he said, causing nervous laughter from everyone present.
"Come On, Draco, let's get dressed," he said, pulling on a smiling blond man's hand, "I have to take a bath and I want you to help me choose which clothes to wear, will you help me? – He asked with shining eyes.
Harry clung to his shirt and buried his head in his neck as more tears came out of his eyes. Tears of anger, frustration, pain, and loneliness. Minutes later he stopped crying and as he felt Draco hold him tighter against him, he leaned completely on his body and placed his head on his shoulders, inhaling his aroma that felt reassuring as the hand in his back.
Suddenly the snake raised its head sniffing the air with its tongue and then turned towards him. Draco was paralyzed for a few seconds before clearing his throat and asking if he could come in. He received a nod from the snake and that made him feel less stupid and less nervous. He approached the bed slowly and before sitting e looked at the snake with indecision before daring to ask.
"You see Professor," he said, moving uncomfortably in his chair, "this holiday I have had time to think about prophecy and... after what happened in the ministry...” he lowered his gaze pretending sadness, although he couldn’t help but feel a prick of pain when he remembered Sirius falling through the veil and had to be forced to remember that his godfather was alive and safe. “I think I should take part more actively in this war.”
He was wearing tight blue denim trousers and a slightly tight moss-green T-shirt, it was nothing strange.
Breakfast was quietly spent with unimportant comments, but Harry knew that as soon as breakfast ended, he was going to be bombarded with questions. Since he had never been a patient person, he left that to Hermione, he decided to start himself.
He wore black trousers and a white shirt with gold details and closing the ensemble, a green Slytherin robe with the same details as the shirt at both cuffs.
"Harry's right, I have to go to sleep too – she walked closer to Harry and kissed him in the cheek – Ron, can we speak for a moment?
– Look, Paddy, Hedwig brought Harry's letters!  – he quickly approached followed by Sirius – I don't think we'll have to wait any longer to meet with little Prongs.
– Mmmm I’m no longer Draco? – he watched Potter blush and added– But Potter, not even the Malfoys are immune to the
As the Headmaster closed with a small speech about second chances and not being guided by prejudice, Harry took the opportunity to hide his hands under the table and the next second Draco's handheld on to his with strength. He sighed imperceptibly and relaxed.
– Well, it looks like Potter's here. Could you ask him if I can get out of the room? – he rolled on his back, he was numb by the position.
– You don't have to carry the load on your own, please trust me, Harry. I don't know what you discovered in that letter or what you saw in that pensive, but if they don't appreciate your friendship, let me be the one to support you and helps you with everything that you want.  Give me a chance Harry, let me be your friend and you'll see that I won't let you down – his tone of voice ended up being pleading, but he couldn't care less if Harry agreed.
Harry wasn't happy with his obligatory activities, but that didn't mean he wouldn't say goodbye to his father, so he came out like an exhalation from the dining room to catch up with his father before he disappeared.
He felt a dagger stab in his heart as he uttered those words, but he knew he couldn’t condemn the Muggle and magical world just because he didn’t want to lose his father.
– I don't know Padfoot. He had been calm, but suddenly he got up from the couch and started walking, he looked very worried.
– I don't know who you are, but I won't let you hurt Harry and less of all play with his feelings trying to make him think you're Sirius Black.
That wasn’t a problem for him so with a flick of his wrist wand in hand he annulled it without them noticing.
"I hadn't thought about that Moony, but I think you're right – and then added in a lower tone – or so I hope.
– Good Harry. I came on leave before Christmas, I only came for a few days then I go back to Romania, there's a lot of work," he said, kindly.
"I'll go with you to the library and then I'll go to the Mansion, I need to take a shower and change my clothes," he added looking at Potter– we'll talk later. You must rest first.
he corrected himself. "I also desire it, you are my only son, mine and the love of my life and that is precisely why I am doing this son" He cleaned with his fingers the tears that fell down his son's cheeks. "I need to know that you will be as prepared as possible to return to school" He gently denied "I will not leave you to your fate, I will make sure you have protection. But you better than anyone should know that problems are hard to avoid and you have to be prepared."
Severus couldn't believe what he had seen; Potter sure had balls to talk to the Dark Lord in such a manner, even being his son, he could have crucio him. But it seems like the brat always gets away with it.
He felt so lost that he wasn't sure how he should proceed. He needed to tell Nagini and he needed her help and her advice. He turned around decisively but it was useless because Nagini was behind him staring at him.
"Thank you, Draco. " Harry placed a kiss on his cheek before he walked to the bathroom. "I'll see you at dinner."
He was devastated to learn that maybe this were the last nights he would spend at Ron's house with his family, but there was no turning back. He did not notice when tears began to fall silently down his cheeks. He let out the pain and minutes later he fell asleep.
– Don't do anything Draco! "He said hastily –They will have the protection of the ministry and the Headmaster. I don't want you to get hurt because of me," he said, worried.
– Hello Harry – Fleur came up and hugged him hard before kissing him on the cheek, her accent noticeable.
The blonde lay in the free space of the bed feeling uncomfortable, so he crossed his arms behind his head without looked at the brunet. The latter watched the blonde lie next to him and after a few seconds of hesitation snuggled up to his right side to feel his warmth, he felt the blonde get uncomfortable with his closeness but didn’t reject him, so Harry didn’t move.
If Dudley also heard that sound, it might mean it wasn't a hallucination; after being attacked by the
Draco stood there watching the bathroom door and when he heard the water running, he rushed out of the room.
–A friend of Blaise of course. You know, having fun," he added with a smile of sufficiency. After all, Severus didn't have to doubt what he was saying because he had done it a few times.
"Of course I can read it, the fact that I don't like to use that kind of magic doesn't mean I'm not able to read a bit," replied the brunette upset, turning his back on him.
When he heard someone banging in the door, he let a "come in" as he got up impatiently from his chair. But he looked with confusion at Severus who had come alone and asked.
Harry walked towards the door and knocked. He took a breath of air and smiled kindly when Mrs. Weasley opened the door for him.
– Who was it? What did you tell him? – Harry was panicking, but he felt Draco's hand squeezing his wrist and taking a deep breath. Although his cousin’s stunned gaze didn’t escape his notice and he frowned.
He approached slowly, quietly, and when he was behind Malfoy, he hugged him from behind and hid his face among his back.
– Sorry Harry, I lost control when you defended him; but you're right we have to put these ideas behind us, only it's Malfoy and that makes me lose my mind –he muttered a little embarrassed.
Remus was staring lost at the flames of the chimney, Sirius was like a caged lion walking back and forth throughout the room, occasionally looking out the window and Draco... well Draco was
Awesome Chapter no? The long-awaited reunion between father and son! stay tuned for the next one shortly. XD
"To hand you over to the dark lord," they said together, staring at him without expression on their faces.
–Shhh, easy there, kiddo. I am here now, and I won’t leave you alone again.” He squished the small body of his godson closer to calm him but smiled in satisfaction at seeing the frown on Lucius’s son. – you don’t have to worry. From now on I won’t permit nobody to harm you and certainly not perverted guys who just want to take advantage of you.” He saw the cold look that the blond sent his way and showing him tongue he placed his hands on Harry’s hip bringing closer to his body.
