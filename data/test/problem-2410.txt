out of him like a goddamn, babbling brook.

I huff out a laugh, turning away.
They both move away at the same time, Potter jerking back neatly in a rather controlled manner, Draco reacting with far less control and nearly falling over backwards. He stumbles and catches himself, gulping hard before looking around to see his useless little silvery wisp dissipate and glancing back to see Potter smiling vaguely at it too.
“Three more mugs of that bootwash you have on tap, please.” Draco grins as Zabini stomps away. “Now, what the fuck is up with you?” He turns to me all businesslike.
“Why else?” Draco snaps, cheeks colouring faintly.
Harry tore back into the living room and there... At least twenty dementors, bleeding into the house like solid black shadows. Albus stood in the centre of the room, looking like he was about to faint.
and my feet can no longer hold me up for more than five minutes at a time.” He gets increasingly louder as he talks and is glowering hatefully at Harry by the end.
“Stop encouraging this behaviour!” Draco shouted, pointing as though the scene wasn’t self-explanatory. Harry turned to him, hands held up in a helpless gesture, his mouth, pursed around his toothbrush, quivering with the grin he was holding back.
“I can’t believe I didn’t notice sooner.” Draco shook his head with a sharp flick. “Why didn’t you show me?”
Malfoy jerks wildly as Harry bites down onto the flimsy skin of his rim and reaches back to shove desperately at his head, yanking at his hair and pushing at his face while simultaneously lifting his arse higher, muffled whimpers of pleasure sounding every now and then.
“Fuck you, you fucking bastard,” Draco snarls and whips his hips even harder, sending the frame of the bed crashing into the wall. Potter emits soft, croaked sounds of pleasure, his head tipped back, the pendant around his neck swinging wildly. Draco reaches up and snags a hand in Potter’s hair, dragging his head further back, and making Potter scream.
“MUM!”
Something flickers across Potter’s face for a brief second and he looks mildly horrified with himself. “We can meet elsewhere,” he says quickly.
“We’re not asking you to sit at home and wait for it to go away,” Ron says calmly now, looking up at him steadily, hands laced over his stomach as he lounges low in his chair. “We’re asking you to go out –
“Potter,” Draco gasps, cradling his head. “Merlin, you’re such a right bastard.”
“You consented to being knocked up?”
already.”
“Shut up.”
But he does anyway, on a deep sigh, shifting closer and hooking a sweaty, quivering leg over him as he sighs next to Draco. “Just you, Potter. Always, just you.”
“A date, Harry.” Draco resignedly picks up the last of my sandwich again. “With Tristan.”
“It’s just—He’s always around, isn’t he?” I scowl down at the bottle in my hand, aggressively peeling off the label with my thumb. “And now when he isn’t we’re still bloody
“Why do you ask me that every single time you come back from a work trip?” I frown and eat another bite of the knafeh.
“I’ll be waiting with bated breath,” Draco drawls, helpless as he returns Potter’s wide grin.
He exhales shakily. “G’night.”
“When I opened the invitation card it started singing and I nearly soiled myself.”
“Can you shut
“Why d’you think she did everything she could to make Malfoy jealous?” Ron is grinning, looking rather proud of his sister. When I just look down at my plate again: “Malfoy’s been soft on you for years, mate.”
a drink, Potter.”
Draco hardly registers the pleasantry. “I want to help you,” he says abruptly, half shouting it into Potter’s face.
The flickering light from the fireplace dances across them, making the light sweat on their skin glow orange, and making Draco’s eyes sparkle with the same something that burns inside Harry’s chest. Their noses brush and their breath mingles, Draco shuddering each time Harry’s belly presses against his hard length between them. They don’t need words in these moments, don’t need to speak out loud, but it is in these moments that they’re most honest with each other.
Harry feels his stomach clench. “Are you telling me that this is somehow my fault? That I ought to have denied the contents of that bloody article that came out almost

Harry blinks. “I don’t feel anything about him. I don’t even
at the moment, his cock practically vibrating with the need for further stimulation. Malfoy is warm and pliant and gorgeous in his arms and Harry feels as though he’s slowly unravelling, mind and body.
!” His feet stomp back onto the ground as Harry willingly complies and begins battering away at his arse, stroking the sweaty nape of his neck for a second before pushing his fingers into the tousled, white blond mess and grasping a handful, yanking his head back roughly. “Potter,” he moans, voice breaking as he slips down a couple of inches, at which point he starts stroking his cock in slippery ruts against the seat again. “
“About?” Draco asks, though he already knows.
, so what can one expect? It had taken me surprisingly no time at all to get used to it, Draco unthinkingly touching me every now and then, when we’d first started spending time together. Ron spent several months flinching wildly and squinting suspiciously every time Draco so much as even casually slapped him on the back, but now he doesn’t even bat an eyelid when Draco invades his personal space –
Draco does not swing by Grimmauld Place after work like he has been for the last couple of weeks; he does not feel as daring as he had the previous month, not after doing what Harry had explicitly forbidden him to do.
“You’re ten seconds away from having cider flung in your face, Potter,” Draco drawls, turning his face slightly to nuzzle Harry’s nose.
Potter’s smile is sweet and strangely vulnerable. “You’d be surprised.”
my filthy mouth, Potter,” he quips, pressing his tongue flat against the smooth softness and licking all the way up to the edge of Potter’s bright green boxers.

I make an exaggerated display of shock. “Problem? I have
Harry keeps his word and leads Malfoy to the Floo after breakfast the next morning to take him to see his parents.
Kicking Potter’s legs apart, Draco slips in one long thigh between Potter’s legs and Potter
His stomach clenched in a mixture of excitement and embarrassment when he realised that not only had he been caught staring but was being thoroughly scrutinised himself. His pace, having had slowed down slightly, immediately went back up and he remembered to keep his chin raised.
Large and spacious with high, old-fashioned rosewood furniture, the room reminds Draco of the Manor. There’s a fire roaring merrily and a rickety old Wireless sits on the mantel, the music soft and unobtrusive. The entire right side wall is taken up by a giant, glass-fronted bookshelf, two round reading tables in front of it with a set of cosy armchairs grouped around both of them. The bright chandelier overhead is electric but there are still several candles lit on the wall-sconces, sputtering only very slightly in the chill breeze blowing in from the open French windows on the left. The soft, pastel drapes look freshly laundered, and billow in a slow dance until Potter saunters over and pulls the sliding glass windows partially shut, so that suddenly the room feels even quieter, more still. The upholstery on the furniture is rich, royal blue velvet and the cushions all stand in place, plump and fluffy, like they’ve not been disturbed at all.

Draco blinks, eyes wide but face otherwise empty. His gaze darts all over my face, his pink mouth slightly open as he makes an obvious effort to puzzle me out.

,” he finally says, his tone one of realisation, his gaze gone even darker than earlier.
Would you even know how to? ‘cause I’m not going to lie, love, I wouldn’t mind it in the least - I’ve sneaked a look at the package and Granger is one lucky bint—”
Heaving for breath, Draco finds himself instantly shoving his arse back into it, not even bothering to spend an extended moment to register the utterly glorious fact that Potter is
“Well, I’d made the mistake of trashing his flat before I left,” Draco shakes his head, rubbing his forehead, “Just about ruined everything he owned. So he went to Gnopf and—well, in retaliation he made up a load of tripe about how I’d been selling rare potions on the side, making a bunch of my own Galleons, and well, Gnopf knew about my...you know,” he gestures to his left arm, “so it wasn’t hard to sell that story and...I was given the boot.”
“Shut up, you’re not on duty right now” he tells me crisply, stowing away his wand. “BLAISE!” he suddenly bellows making me jump.
He wasn’t in his senses when he did, I’m reminded. Oh. Right.
“Did he?”
him to prevent any more such incidents, it’s sort of...nice of you? But don’t you think things would just be easier if you just went up to him and talked to him? Asked to be...something resembling friends?”
Draco can’t for the life of him pinpoint when exactly this had started.
didn’t have to suffer through the process, and Hermione had watched Harry in alarm as if worried that he’d suddenly keel over and pass out because of his jutting boner.
“Fucking hell, Harry, make him shut up!”
Draco moaned – he really couldn’t help it and nor could he be blamed for it – and rutted his sadly bobbing cock into thin air. Harry ate him with the same relentless tenacity with which he worked to put asunder Dark Lords; as if his sole purpose was to reduce Draco to a babbling mess as he was wracked with increasingly violent shudders that made his skin burn red hot and his cock leak a small spurt of pre-come, the skin along his crack reddened from that rough stubble.
His children clinging to him, Harry spun around.
“I am
He’s brushed out his hair and it hangs in loose curls down to his shoulders, and he’s bright eyed and fresh faced. He’s flown here, apparently; he’s in biking gear – black leather jacket with his jeans tucked into heavy, tightly laced up boots – and what looks to be the button-down Draco had bought him on impulse the previous weekend, pale, pistachio green, the first three buttons left undone as was wont with Harry and button-downs.
She tells him they don’t and Malfoy settles for a cup of Darjeeling instead. Harry waits in silence, drinking his coffee and watching Malfoy steadily demolish his breakfast.
Malfoy’s chin fell to his chest. Harry just stood there, bewildered.
mouth, Malfoy,” Potter says quietly, one hand coming to rest on the back of Draco’s head, fingers winding through the fine blond hair. One thick fingered hand wraps around that cock and then Draco’s head is tilting back as he’s fed the entirety of it in one long, slick shove.
“Good, neither do I!”
“Do Malfoys just have weapons of gold lying about?”
What he’d pulled out with a flourish—and a shit-eating grin—was a fucking ferret.
at Draco rather than just admiring him.
“Dad, I’m sorry! Please wake up!”
“Yes, that’s what I’ve been taking,” Malfoy mumbles. “Got myself a few vials at Slug and Jiggers.”
!” he roars and then follows it up with another shove, face maroon with rage, his hair falling out of its knot. Outside there’s a ear-splitting crack of thunder, and a blinding fork of lightning lights up the sky outside the window at the end of the corridor.
He was in Auror training and sometimes wore his trainee robes (cream with two scarlet stripes down the sides) when he came into the bar. Occasionally he’d take them off to reveal his ludicrous ripped jeans and weird Muggle band T-shirts underneath. He looked ridiculous like that. Utterly ridiculous. When had he even grown so tall? And was he getting bigger because of exercise or was he just getting fat? Probably getting fat, yes. Why didn’t he
After a moment, he starts moving again, lifting his arms in the air so his shirttails ride up, twisting around in Harry’s grip to press his back to Harry’s chest, gasping softly as Harry’s erection presses into the crease of his arse through denim and leather.
My brain wakes up some more. I’m perfectly sober as I do this. Draco is not.
His own ears ring with how loudly he shrieks, thrusting wildly into Potter’s mouth as those fingers continue their way into him, pressing forward with aching gentleness, twisting lightly each time they meet a spot of unyielding tightness. Just as Potter manages to sink in the whole length of his middle and forefinger into him, the pads of his fingers dancing over Draco’s prostate, Draco grabs wildly with one hand at Potter’s head, clutching him by one handful of hair and coming with a sharp shout down his throat.
Another few weeks after that, we’d had to call in Curse Breakers after a midnight raid that had turned out to be all kinds of fucked up. Ron had been injured and I stood next to him as one of the emergency Medi-Wizards had checked him. When I’d looked up at one point, my stomach had plummeted to see Draco in the crowd gathered outside the old cursed mansion we’d raided. Draco had been looking at Ron’s supine form on the stretcher but when I looked up at him, he’d met my eye directly. Then his gaze wandered to my singed robes before landing on the pendant he’d gifted me, lying on my chest, the gold threads catching the moonlight. Ron and I had both been hit with curses. Only I’d escaped unscathed.
He couldn’t say that the air between them now felt comfortable and warm, or even friendly – it wasn’t. He was deeply aware that this was still
“Yes,” Harry answers dully; he’s not wearing his glasses and Hermione is a very blurred, bushy-headed shape floating in front of him.

intelligent and that’s...well, she’d never admit out loud to something like that unless it were true. And he’s...” Harry hopes Malfoy can’t see his cheeks pinken in the gloom of the room, “you know, handsome. Really handsome,” Harry adds rather feverishly.
Or maybe it’s the fact that he’s back here, back at Hogwarts; back in the very same place Voldemort’s lifeless body had thumped to the floor, where Potter had cried quietly over the corpses of the friends he’d lost, where Potter had

Both of their loud panting freezes into still silence as they inhale in unison and hold their breath, their gazes fixed on where Harry’s cock is nudging at Draco’s stretched rim. Harry bucks his hips forward, pushing the tip in, and Draco fears that he might just pass out before he can feel that aching, satiating stretch of Harry’s cock pushing into him completely. The sudden ravenous desire that roars its presence within him is an ineludible force that demands to be fulfilled, and Draco pulls at his own hair with a sharp bark of impatience.

“Is that what they’re calling it these days?” Draco asked. Potter’s cheeks pinkened and he shoved Draco playfully.

“Now’s a good time as any,” Hermione says shortly. “Besides, it’s not as if you have much choice. Might as well find all the happiness you can in this situation – at least for the baby’s sake.”
of skin on skin wonderfully lewd in the still, icy air around them.
In the fleeting second of their departure, Malfoy’s gaze met his, and locked.
For an unplanned first kiss, it went on for a remarkably long time, neither of them particularly keen nor in a hurry to part long enough to discuss things. They kissed and kissed and kissed, standing there entwined together, arms coiled around each other, breath huffing across each other’s faces, neither of them cold anymore, despite the biting wind that swirled their cloaks and robes around them.

“Aconite?”
“Yeah, ‘cause that free clinic at
“Fuck!” He has both hands cupped over his nose, his eyes scrunched shut in pain.
“Why do you even have that stuff on?!”
“Harry.”
I don’t have time to wait around. I need to go home, shower, get dressed, break-up with Simon, and go find Draco at Parkinson’s party so I can kiss him some more.
“Draco is not moving back in here.” Harry’s voice sounds loud and deep in the silence that had fallen; there’s a flicker of disbelief in Malfoy’s eyes and Harry suddenly can’t go on any longer without telling literally anybody who would listen about how he feels. “Draco is coming back with me. He’s coming home with me.” He never looks away from Malfoy as he says it. “Why would the man I love stay anywhere else?”
that I need to justify myself to
Draco doesn’t quite know how to answer that because there’s a chaotic screeching that erupts inside his head while his heart takes wildly excited flips down to his belly and back up to his chest. Potter waits, face falling by small increments until Draco blurts out, “Dinner?” like a halfwit.
“Moody,” he panted after trying in vain for a few seconds. “Moody, come out.”
“Drunk,” Harry confirms flatly. “Just drunk enough.”
after months of nothing but subtle flirting and longing stares.
“Did you see this coming?” he asks Harry, handing him a glass. “Blaise and Lovegood?”
“Dad.”
He’s aware of the last remaining dregs of his control leaving him; he’s aware of the fiery rage coursing through his bloodstream and setting every nerve ending aflame, making everything around him blindingly vivid; he’s aware of Malfoy’s garbled babbling as he wrestles him onto the bed, Malfoy plucking one of the gauzy bed-hangings down in his momentary struggle. Harry flips him onto his hands and knees and hikes his robes up, throwing the hem over his back and ripping his boxers down, tearing it off one leg and leaving them tangled around his ankle. It’s not until he smells Malfoy’s arousal, thick and unmistakable, that he realises Malfoy is
so hard that his body flailed with it, his hips bucking wildly into Malfoy’s as he held him down and fucked his orgasm up into him, grunting with the effort and unnerved  from the impossible intensity of it. His insides felt liquefied and his limbs felt heavy and overused.
“You...shouldn’t have gone after Simon,” I say just so that it’s on record that I had objected to Draco’s antics.
“What?” he asks distractedly, standing on one leg, leaning back into the side of the closet, examining his foot while holding his wand angled to throw more light on it. “What’s golden?” he asks again, looking up.
One shoulder is lifted in an elegant shrug as Malfoy lifts his tumbler for another sip. “Everyone’s always asking you to bring somebody, or to find somebody or...” he trails off, rolling his eyes, not noticing Harry's surprised stare, “It doesn’t feel much like a party after a point when they’re all asking you if there’s someone worth mentioning in your life and you’re wondering how to tell them that the bloke you slept with last night not only left while you were still asleep but also stole all your soap.”
Malfoy straightens up, smiling softly at her and taking the hand she reaches out with. “Next month,” he says quietly.
“Thank you,” said Harry, cupping the top of his head and then drawing him closer by the shoulders.
“I-- Creepy?!” Harry’s voice rose in pitch some. “For your information, I’m not...
So the next evening at the library, when Harry dumped his bag into a free chair and flung himself into his usual seat, he was met with the sight of Malfoy sitting there, spine stiff and straight, expression cold and slightly frightening as regarded Harry, lightly tapping his quill onto the table.
And I think a part of me is also terrified that he won’t.
He’s pressing in even before he’s finished pleading with him, and Malfoy
“That’s right,” Harry said.
Draco smirks, pointedly sidling closer to me. “And
“Why haven’t we been blessed with the company of my noble son-in-law?” Lucius asks suddenly, setting his cutlery down and reaching for his port.
“So, Malfoy,” she says, voice rather high, “How are we doing? Any new symptoms you want me to make note of or address? Excessive fatigue? Backache? Muscle cramps? Heartburn? Constipation?”

the degenerate?” He steps up to Draco, walking forward until Draco’s shoulders hit the wall. “So what was it, actually? D’you get off on getting beat up in front of a bunch of people?”
“Well, I’m going to try,” he says firmly. Then he sighs through his nose, gaze flicking away for a moment. “You shouldn’t have done what you did, Draco. I still can’t believe you put yourself at risk like that.”
in the moonlight, the detailed, intricate work carved on the outside seeming to come alive.
“Your mother has threatened me on more than one occasion, you know?” Harry grumbles, jabbing his wand at the butter to soften it with a little too much vigour, causing a chunk of it to melt off completely. “You wouldn’t believe me, but she has!”

dressed first?”
“It’s no problem, really, I—”
She very young, barely just a couple of years older than Potter and he are, and Draco can make out, despite the grainy, faded quality of the photo, that she’s extremely pretty. She’s in a wedding gown, effortlessly elegant, red hair up in a chignon, stray tendrils framing her heart shaped face. She’s holding a simple little bouquet of red and white roses and looks positively euphoric as she smiles at the camera, gaze dipping bashfully.
” Draco’s voice was cracked with nervousness but he covered it up by rudely flipping Weasley the bird when he turned around to scowl at Draco.
“Because you’re not?” Harry waves his wand a little too vigorously and the canister cleans itself with an indignant squeak, sparkling up at Harry as he lets it swing back into place.
to Potter, hanging on for dear life, one leg wrapped around his hip as he’d had rutted and ground his cock into his hand, whining like a bitch in heat, coming within mere seconds as he’d screamed and moaned and bitten expletives into the crook of Potter’s neck.
“Missing me already?”
“Yeah, whatever,” Harry says miserably, burying his face in his arms. “It’s not as if I’m going to go out and do any better myself.”
,” Harry interrupted pointedly, drawing the word out, “I included Ron in that statement too.
The elf nods, the bulbous eyes
“Well—” His voice cracks and he hurriedly clears his throat. “Well, Potter. You...are capable of good taste, I see,” he says loftily. He picks up his flute of champagne and holds it up to me. “To making the right choice at last,” he says and drains the glass.
He could hear faint, indiscernible sounds from the other end now, and after clearing his throat awkwardly, asked, “You okay over there?”
“Well, I don’t know yet when we’re leaving. Or where we’re going.”
“Obviously.” Malfoy’s tone had no bite to it – he sounded slightly breathless and leaned forward a little and Harry felt dizzy from the sudden drastic change in his demeanour.
“I read the article,” I laugh defensively.
“To bone you, probably,” Octavia drawls, flipping through the week’s issue of Witch Weekly.
Harry picks up Malfoy and his luggage, that one single trunk packed with seemingly everything he owns, on Sunday morning. Malfoy’s waiting for him, wearing robes again, this time in a soft cream, which, coupled with his peaches-and-milk skin tone, spun gold hair and heavenly scent, nearly sends Harry keeling over down the stairs when he opens the door.
“Because I was worried you might dislike me and then we might never get a chance to meet.”
Draco, I’ve come to learn, is very quiet when we touch. Any sound that he makes has always seemed involuntary or inadvertent. That one time we’d ground together and come in our pants, he’d pressed his mouth into my shoulder and shuddered in silence as he’d come. When we kiss and I touch him, run my hands over him, he pants quietly against my mouth, against my cheek, but never makes a sound.
But then Malfoy’s gaze dipped and he carefully took Harry’s hand, shaking it with firm formality.
Malfoy’s lip curled. “I didn’t use one.”
“About the way the ferret feels about you. I think he’s right where you are.”
“Great,” I bite out instead, my clenched hands trembling as I stand.
“I don’t give a fuck, to be honest,” Harry says flatly. Narcissa makes a soft sound of disapproval and Harry’s cheeks warm slightly. “Er. Sorry...” Malfoy is now grinning at him, shoulders shaking with mirth and Harry feels the exhilaration bubbling up inside him as well, biting down on inward-turned lips to stem his sudden laughter.
actually thought you’d say no,” he murmurs, brushing his lips down Draco’s cheek and nipping at his earlobe.
Malfoy swung and slashed and the last thing Harry saw was Lily’s body drop – no, float – weightlessly to the ground.
Sliding his groin deeper under his desk, Harry shakes his head vigorously. “No, I’m perfectly fine.”
Weasley sighs. “Why’d you do it, Malfoy?” he asks, the smug bravado from earlier suddenly gone. Now he just looks as weary as Draco feels. “Why would you risk it like that?”
I’m grinning myself as I finally take pity and get up to prise him off Ron, but somewhere inside me there is a fervent prayer being sent up: to whomsoever it may concern – kindly ensure that Draco’s heart
“Still hard?” Ron enquires stupidly.
Draco scowls a little and Potter laughs again. “I’ll...get going, I suppose,” he says, because they’re both just
this time! I will not
“Fuck you, I asked first,” Draco snaps, not even embarrassed at the childish retort. When Harry just snorts and looks away again, Draco takes a step forward and snaps his fingers under Harry’s nose again. “Do. You. Regret. Fucking me, Potter?”

“So...?” Draco draws out the word, tone wary. “Well? Are you going to elaborate?” he asks when Erickson just peers at him over the mask.

“When are you getting out of here, Potter?”
“That’s a shit tagline.”
of those matters.” He quirks another smile at Harry before going on, “I think I’ll reconsider my decision to move in here for the time being. And to answer your earlier question, Mother,” he blushes slightly as he steadily meets his mother’s gaze, “I’m...happy.” He looks back at Harry with bright eyes and Harry’s heart swells to five times its size. “I think we both are.”
When I Floo into Simon’s place I find he’s not home. I’m irritated at this; he was supposed to be here so I could break up with him. Well, technically, he’s supposed to be here because we were to head to Parkinson’s party together but I’d had other plans and his absence is a fucking inconvenience.
Something sharp and hard seems lodged in Draco’s throat and he gulps desperately, trying to blink away the burn behind his eyelids. “You—You haven’t
“Why? Did you do this deliberately?”
Scorpius looked horrified. Malfoy met his gaze calmly.
“Come to the Burrow tomorrow,” Harry tells him softly, “Come spend Christmas there.”
“Do you know where you are, elf?” he asks curiously.
One day in early spring, they’re out in the grounds sitting under a gigantic oak, Harry’s head in Draco’s lap as he pretends to read his Charms textbook, Draco not fooled for a second as he goes through Harry’s Potions essay. It’s lightly breezy and the bright yellow sunshine is comforting, and Draco is deliriously content. That is, until Weasley’s terrier comes zooming at them in a silvery streak, landing on Harry’s chest and speaking in Weasley’s voice:
His head hurt so bad he couldn’t think. His mind was simple white noise. His whole body burned as though he had jumped into an ice bath. His ankle hurt so bad he felt like he might piss himself from the pain.
Harry barely had a moment to look around wildly before he heard the whoosh of something metallic zooming through the air. Some last dregs of all the Quidditch training he’d had in school must have remained in him because he successfully managed to catch one shrunken trunk with both hands and duck out of the way of another. He turned in time to watch Malfoy catch the third.
Malfoy nods and draws Harry closer. “Mungo’s?” he says quietly and Harry, his head swimming, just nods back.
“What,” said Harry, further bewildered.
On Thursday evening, it was past seven-thirty when he finally Flooed home, exhausted, irritable and smelling strongly of the bone-repairing potion he’d been working on all day. When he got home Harry was in the kitchen, mashing potatoes for shepherd’s pie and the lamb and vegetables smelt so good that Draco nearly just settled himself at the table like an excited labrador to await a plateful of dinner. He
much colder.
“Tell me where it is again,” Malfoy blurts, and Harry eagerly steps forward as Hermione laughs softly and carefully points out that tiny mass of grey again.
“Did those foul Muggles you lived with never take you out to beg for chocolate?” Malfoy asks with that same murderous look he gets in his eyes every time they talk of the Dursleys ever since Harry told him about them.
Draco blinks, mouth gaping open wider, his mind already stirring in the way one’s did when they’re struggling to place something they know is familiar.
this.”
Harry slipped out of the bed at once, retrieving the bundle that were his pyjamas and walking around Malfoy’s bed and back to his own. He wondered if he ought to look for a deeper meaning to Malfoy’s words. And then he felt like a prat for trying to pretend like he was in some sort of deeply moving novel or film. Malfoy was referring to his fucking rib. And he felt pretty fucking great apart from that, if he were to be honest.

“Wait, what?”
The sound he makes is clearly a gasp that’s been hurriedly bitten away. His nails are digging into my shoulder blades and with that grip on me he pulls me onto himself completely, so that as I flatten myself over him, I slip deeper.
“Potter,” Draco gasps, lower back arching off the bed as Potter’s fingers slide in, slow and sure, right against his prostate.
Around two in the afternoon, the yellow of daylight darkened to a gloomy grey. Instinctively, Harry’s hand tightened around his wand as he looked up; but it was just heavy, dense grey clouds gathering.
“I bet you can’t get three in a row,” the random bloke from three tables over who’d challenged Draco in the first place pipes up. Draco rolls his eyes.
And so the three of us are eating Chinese takeout seated around their table. Hermione is telling us about one of her current patients, a precocious nine-year-old who, judging by Hermione’s description, sounds a lot like a mini-Hermione. Ron and I exchange a grin across the table before he raises his eyebrows meaningfully, jerking his head towards Hermione and then glaring at me.
“The bloke...died?” Harry gapes at him in shock, “How?”
seems to have read it. Skeeter is ruthless in her slander, gleefully mocking their relationship, having dug up everything from Harry and Draco’s childish rivalry to the time Harry was taken captive and brought to Malfoy Manor during the War.
“Well, of course,” answers Hermione primly. “D’you need more light up there?”
Draco gasps again, eyes going wide as he starts to struggle in earnest, feeling the first stirrings between his legs. He lifts one knee, angling it at Potter’s crotch, but Potter angles his hips away just in time, and then jams his booted foot atop Draco’s, pinning it in place. Draco

“It’s Tristan, isn’t it?” He looks like he’s about to explode with fury. He speaks with calmness that I admire him for dragging together in the state he’s in. “Tell me why you hate Tristan.”
“Then why’d you move out?!” Harry snarls, not waiting for Draco to answer before tossing down his cigarette and crushing it out, roughly shoving past Draco on his way back inside.
The question sprung out of nowhere and slapped Harry across the face.
“I know, I’m sorry I was late getting back,” Harry says. “We missed our Portkey and had to wait for another.”
this way, but fuck, all Draco can do is tighten his arms around his neck and stare desperately at Potter, gaze flicking between his fiery gaze and spit-slicked mouth, and whimper softly as his half-hard cock twitches excitedly within the smeared mess of his come in his pants.

It was Weasley who’d called out to him. “Weasley.” Draco nodded stiffly. The redhead laughed.
“Oh my god,” said Draco and Harry in unison.
“I’ll go get cleaned up then,” he finally says, swinging his arms awkwardly. “Need another shower,” he adds lamely, wiping at the drying tackiness on his stomach and attempting a smile Potter’s way.
, Granger!” Malfoy grits out, shutting his eyes as though to block out her words, his whole body trembling. “I don’t have to tell you
“No,” Harry replies shortly, now pushing in a third finger and kneading at his prostate.
“I told him I need some time to think about it.”
Draco really wants to kiss him again, more thoroughly this time.
“What— no,” Harry sucks at his earlobe, soft and pink, “Can’t leave my bike here—”
I’ll hex your teeth into marshmallows!” Draco threatened, even as arousal spread outwards from the sting that Harry was now lovingly easing away with his tongue, chuckling at Draco’s outburst. “Please,” he added, shivering as hot breath puffed over his crack.
“What about?”

Harry twists in a second finger, sawing them back and forth, scissoring them inside him over and over as he licks at the rim around them with the tip of his tongue, flicking ticklish little licks at the sensitive, pinkened skin.

Harry fidgets for a beat, nervous and trapped in the coolly expectant silence. “You’re um...
—Or maybe I’d just bend you over and fuck you, huh, Malfoy? Shove my cock in you and fuck you hard and fast and—so
“You know...” Erickson waves a hand at his desk, a thin frown creasing his brow, “You know,” he repeats. When Draco stares impassively back at him, he leans forward slightly, “You don’t...know?”
When they came back, Malfoy had a little fire going and was digging around in a trunk of his own. James and Albus stood and stared at the bluish-green fire. Harry expanded and looked through all three trunks to determine what they had, every sensible item he found making his stomach clench with grief and longing.
you mean?”
“Daddy,” she said and Harry’s throat closed up.
Ron is looking for his scarf, distractedly telling Hermione to carry on through the Floo. I edge over – Draco has just headed into the kitchen – and grab Ron by the arm.
“What?” Harry muttered distractedly, shovelling one final forkful of shepherd’s pie into his mouth before picking up his bag and hurrying to his feet. “I just—I have some stuff to do.”
“So fucking sexy when you’re like this,” Potter licks his way up Draco’s throat, pinching little bits of skin between his teeth. “That’s it. Come all over me, Malfoy.”
Then he hauls Draco up by the hair.
“Right, and we’ve been doing it because...” Draco steps closer, arms still crossed, frowning thoughtfully at the ceiling, “...this whole thing will be easier if we’re on at least semi-friendly terms.”
“I’d literally rather eat the dung.”
Draco grimaces another smile at him. “Well, good day.” He grabs the files he’d set beside the sinks and turns to go—
good looking.”
no pleasing qualities.
“Why don’t you sit down, Malfoy?” Hermione offers kindly. “I just have a few questions and then we can move on to the physical examination.”
Malfoy looks genuinely bewildered. “But you’d have to give him something...
As it turns out, several rounds of vigorous sex on a daily basis stands a definite chance of improving the quality of a pregnant wizard’s life.
“Yes, actually,” Harry says irritably, “This building looks like it might crumble in on itself any bloody second. There’s some sort of renovation going on across the hall and it’s incomplete and bound to get even messier soon. You’re too close to Knocturn Alley and I don’t even want to think about the sort of crowds that frequent it and the front door downstairs is
Potter blushes again. “
“Let me rephrase that,” Harry says gruffly. “I’m not likely to share
“Is it because of whatever problem you have with Tristan?”
“What,” Draco says blankly.
“Annoying bastard,” he mutters once he’s successfully pushed me away, looking around furtively before pulling out his wand.
Potter, however, has more to say. “I—The way I behaved--” Potter swallows again, sitting up straighter. “The way I treated you and spoke to you--” Draco’s stomach clenches with exasperation. “It was wrong, Malfoy. I—I shouldn’t have. Especially because I--”

“Draco Malfoy.”
“Where are you headed from here?”
Potter glances at the filled plates. “Breakfast?” he asks, looking confused.
“So...” he says slowly, “cheese and crackers?”
Roughly towelling his hair dry, Harry knocks and pushes into Malfoy’s room without waiting for an answer, padding over to where Malfoy is sitting up in bed with a little bit of a struggle and then leaning back against the headboard.
“I’m sorry about your father, Malfoy,” Potter interrupts softly. “I’d heard. I’m sorry.”
“Harry.” Hermione sounds patient and understanding. “Malfoy loves you too. Yes?”
“Ha! I could smell the dung on you all the way across the room,” Ron greets him. “Bought an extra pint and everything,” he carefully Levitates five pints to the centre of the table, thumping down Draco’s whiskey before him.
in any of it – that sometimes you are just
Harry flings himself beside him, expecting him to grimace and pointedly pull away and claim he reeks, but Malfoy just turns in place to regard him closely, remaining pressed close. “I never thought you’d actually come, though,” Harry says quietly, still smiling at him. “I’ve been inviting you to the Burrow for months now; you never come.”
I stare sullenly at him for several seconds before I realise I’m probably not getting hard again for a while anyway – not if the continued throbbing is any indication. Malfoy laughs as if he’s read my mind.
. Mal—Draco,
“Can’t you just harvest the aconite at moonlight?”
Perhaps it’s Harry’s expression, or his disbelieving tone, or maybe it’s the sympathy that’s unintentionally pouring off Harry in waves, but suddenly Malfoy’s perfect, white teeth are bared at him and he looks terrifyingly angry. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
“Papa’s up, actually,” Draco announces,  with an amused rasp. Harry and Scorpius’ grins are nearly completely identical as they look around at him and Lyra’s squeal is so high pitched that all three of them wince. “Hello,” Draco greets, tousling Scorpius’ hair on his way to pick up Lyra.
you plucked me out of? Because I think there’s something more to it.”
“You could, next time, if you like,” Hermione smiles, “Take care of yourself, Malfoy. Please don’t hesitate to reach out at any given time.”
Whether it was the sheer absurdity of the automated diagnosis or Hermione’s nearly hysterical reaction to said diagnosis, Harry doesn’t know, but suddenly he’s stifling a guffaw born mostly of overwhelmed nervousness, earning a furious glare from an already embarrassed looking Malfoy and a silent, but very emphatic ‘
Malfoy’s first, and expected, reaction is to jump to his feet with a hissed, “I’m to
!” Malfoy suddenly darts towards his desk, snatching up his wand and pointing it at Harry, hand trembling, eyes flashing, “Get out,” he repeats, voice shaking with furious embarrassment.
“Thanks,” Malfoy mumbles, getting up and abruptly looking over at Harry, face clear of any resentment or hostility for the first time since he walked in. “See you around, Potter.”
“Yes.”
“Please don’t tell me you nicked this from the cursed trunk,” I say, examining the exquisitely beautiful pendant, the metal slightly coarse under my fingers. Draco clicks his tongue irritably.
Then Draco parts Potter’s buttocks and sees for himself the dusky little hole there, nestled in a silken patch of soft hairs. Potter shudders and Draco can feel it all the way up to where he’s massaging Potter’s arse.
him. He’s finally got Draco pinned under him, after several minutes of furious grappling, practicing every move they’d been taught in the past four months of hand-to-hand combat training, and Draco can’t
“He’s basically a speck from over here, you’re not going to be able to see much,” Harry deadpans. “And yes, I’m sure. Merlin, Gin.”
“He’ll be alright, Harry,” Hermione says softly and for the enth time. “Malfoy and your baby are going to be okay.”
Potter!” he hisses, colour leaking down his neck and across the little sliver of his collarbones that’s visible beneath the collar of his cream button-down, where his tie has been loosened some. “How drunk
“Merlin!” Draco’s squeak of pleasure is once again lost in the rather feral growl Harry gently bites into his arsehole, his tongue painting broad strokes from Draco balls up to his tailbone, each lick against his rim softening it further.
not looking irritated or disinclined to answer. “After the Third Task. The Triwizard Tournament,” he adds when Draco just gapes.
“Us?”
Malfoy stares at him, bright eyed and straight faced, for several, lengthy beats. And then, to Harry’s utter shock, Malfoy bursts out laughing.
“What, and I don’t get to come along?” Ginny narrows her eyes, “Scared I’ll set off your pet Veela?”
“Thanks,” Harry said, his tone somehow fond. “D’you want to go to Hogsmeade with us this weekend?”
. But wait,” Harry tilts his head, “you already know all this. You
“Yes,” Malfoy whines at once. “Fuck, Potter, so
Draco clicks his tongue irritably, stepping out of the tub and vigorously drying his feet on the bathmat. “Why didn’t you get
Malfoy sat up and gratefully accepted the glass with both his hands, clumsily lifting it to his mouth like a child and gulping quickly. When he held the glass out, Harry poured him some more and Malfoy drank that too.
Malfoy looked slightly irritated. “Why would I save you and then bring you to an unsafe location?”
It ought to have felt like a victory. He’d just physically pushed Potter onto his knees and he had acquiesced beautifully. But now he's looking up at him, gazing up at him, wordlessly urging Draco to do
Malfoy storms into his room and slams the door hard enough to make the framed painting of a haughty looking witch rattle from side to side. She clutches at her pearls and then shoots Harry a glare. Harry gives her a flat stare and then slowly turns to look at where Malfoy disappeared behind that door.
I snort and then burst out laughing, chortling helplessly. “I want him so much it’s a bit disturbing, actually.”
Potter turns back to Weasley after another burning, somewhat searching, look at Draco, and the two of them carry on towards the showers, Draco watching the stiff lines of Potter’s back.
Draco loses himself in the rhythmic, velvety slide over his tongue, heavy and pulsing. Potter’s cock is hot in his mouth, and it
Because the next second, Harry waved his hand in a broad circle over the mess and wandlessly cleaned it up. The newspaper still looked a bit damp but the furniture was spotless and the cream kitchen tiles sparkled.

“Oh, I can take a lot more than two,” Malfoy breathed - and then he gasped, sharp and soft.
babies. Not a lot of wizards possess the fortitude to take up the challenge as efficiently as you did.”
, personally, think it’s been a particularly enjoyable evening, Potter,” he says snidely. “I think we should fuck every full moon.”
I sit up but remain on the floor, turning to lean back against the sofa, folding my legs up to my chest and resting my elbows on my knees. I don’t look at him.
Devoid of the energy to rag him for it, Draco just sighs and looks around Potter’s room. The curtains are drawn haphazardly, and with the sun rising, there are broken shafts of deep vermillion light slanting into the room, dancing with clouds of dust motes. There’s a desk in a corner with several Auror case files strewn around on it, and a large, stuffed armchair by the window. The wardrobe on the other side of the room hangs slightly open and Draco can just about spot the sleeve of the set of black and gold dress robes Potter had worn to Paris on Draco’s birthday. There’s a chest of drawers next to the en suite and atop it are several framed photographs – Draco thinks he recognises a familiar bushy brown head as well as several heads of bright red.
“No.” Potter’s jaw clenches and he releases Draco, stepping back and staring coolly.
“What I’d like,” Potter says seriously, “is to kiss you.”
, and how it’s probably only Harry’s innate kindness that’s preventing him from saying anything to Draco about it.
“Merlin, Harry, point that...thing away from me, would you?”
“I never noticed that smell,” Seamus says thoughtfully.
Instead, Malfoy, his expression a cross between incredulity and scepticism, asked, “Are you even
Stark naked and hungover as all fuck, Draco strides out into the living room, crossing it silently on bare feet and bursting into the kitchen with his wand drawn.
“So say you are.”
Potter blinks, looking taken aback. “What?”
“What do you mean, ‘together’?” I feel my face heat for absolutely no goddamn reason, and I can swear that’s a
Harry leans forward and nuzzles him. “It’s never happened with anyone else,” he confirms and then watches Malfoy’s cheek colour further. “I’m really sorry, Malfoy.”
Cupping his face, Draco kisses him again, slowly, thoroughly, feeling the dark stubble lightly chafe his palms as Harry tilts his face up into the kiss. When Harry cups Draco’s nape, Draco pulls off and pins his hand beside their heads; when Harry strokes Draco’s cheek with his other hand, Draco pins that down too.
“So we’re just going to assume he’s never been in love with any of those others?”
is at his heels, smiling around as if he fucking belongs here.
to realise that some things are beyond your control, love; you have to cut yourself some slack there.”
“Are you talking about one of those...magi-scanners that just checks your magical signature before—” Hermione scans the parchment again, “—before spitting out one of these?”
Harry feels his face and neck heat slowly as he forces himself to talk. “Er... So, you know my boyfriend—?”
“Mostly indoors,” Harry admitted. “Fine. Out here then. I’ll transfigure some clothes.”

“Then why are you still suspicious of me?” Harry demands weakly. “I’m—I’m your...
“Woah!” Harry quickly grabs his elbow and steadies him. “Need a hand in here?” he murmurs, inhaling against Draco’s neck.
“I was thinking,” he finally says slowly. “I was thinking... Would you like to go to brunch with Tristan and me tomorrow? Just us three?”
to be as a teenager. Now he’s just
“No. No, I didn’t,” Draco said, facing Potter properly. The bastard hit him with a full blown grin, mischievous and aggravatingly attractive, and Draco wanted so bad to reciprocate. “Because it really isn’t anybody’s business but my own, is it, Potter?”
Malfoy grimaces. “Two completely different kinds of invitations, Potter,” he says sourly. “I’m not very inclined to come and be poisoned at Weasley’s ancestral dump.”
Malfoy.”
right now, Harry,” he tells me seriously and I click my tongue at him irritably. “Oh, would you grow up and not be a prude for once?!”
Now Harry looked at everything else; he looked at the little mole on Malfoy’s right thigh, he looked at Malfoy’s scars, cutting cruelly across the otherwise utterly flawless expanse of ivory skin; he looked at Malfoy’s nipples, hard and pebbled and mouth-wateringly pink.
” He nearly threw the glass back onto the bedside table, coming close to knocking the little lamp right off as he hurried to turn it on.

Malfoy’s movements are no more than a light gyration against Harry, but at Harry’s words, he goes still, standing there with his elbows on Harry’s shoulders, expression wary and closed off.

he finds himself enjoying all of it, for they still haven’t actually talked about, or in any way addressed, what they are now.
Potter’s face falls again, guilt and a slight hint of resignation creeping in. “I didn’t think it would matter to you beyond the sheer absurdity of it.”
Draco glared at him until he stood stiffly in the tight circle of Harry’s arms. Harry still had the boxers hanging over his shoulder. “The ferret needs to be
?” Draco blurts.
“He’s different now, alright?” he says quietly, resisting the temptation to steal another glance at Malfoy. “It didn’t end for him after the War. He’s been through some shit.”
“Brilliant idea,” drawled Malfoy. “It’s not as if dementors use trees as cover.”
“And what have you mixed into it?”
against Draco’s arse. Gasping loudly, eyes bugging out, Draco actually arches
He waits until the group has gone back into the club before straightening up, grinning at the gritted cusses that immediately float up from where Malfoy’s head is hanging over the side of the bike. “You’re shaking, you can’t even try to convince me that it wasn’t good,” Harry says blandly, massaging Malfoy’s sloppy arsehole with the tips of two fingers.
wanted you too,” he says in a very low voice, licking his lips and looking somewhere next to Harry’s ear.
“He has, unfortunately.” When Harry didn’t press, he went on cautiously, “When the infestation first began to grow, I made sure I kept him educated about what was happening. He enjoys reading – however much a five year old can read – and being read to. There isn’t a lot of children’s literature about dementors, as you’re probably aware.” Malfoy drank some more tea, shifting on his feet. “When...our house was taken over by them, he seemed—seemed prepared. He was shaken, of course;
The challenge in Malfoy’s tone is unmistakable and Harry wonders if this is his last chance to salvage things.
“Hey,” I reply. I don’t know what to say after that when the silence stretches on and this is such an alien experience of awkwardness with Draco that it just exacerbates my stinging unhappiness.
He’s mostly useless after that, leaning heavily against Harry with his clingy trousers around his thighs, while Harry rights his own clothes, then rights

A moment later, Ron’s head pops in, his hair a complete mess and his face drawn. “Harry?” he calls out before he spots Harry hurrying over. “We found them. They’ve been taken in.”
Still reeling and too fucked out to be properly annoyed, Draco scowled, simply shoving Harry off with both hands and limping away inside.
“Maybe you should just release a statement--” starts Hermione hesitantly.
“There
gay.”
“Then
Harry’s arm tightens around Draco. “I know.”
Harry pulls his fingers out to the tip, adds a third and fucks them back in hard enough to make Malfoy lose all sense of himself and scream bloody murder, the alleyway ringing with it. “Romance and sap is for when you’re too old and arthritic to do anything but cuddle and talk about your feelings, Malfoy.” Harry leans over and mouths around his fingers, licking at the skin stretched taut and thin around his knuckles. “Besides, you’ve always ditched the sappy ones you’ve dated in the past – Parkinson talks, you know?”
“Potter, why are you so convinced
He looks a bit dazed from the kiss as he looks around us. “Now we...socialise, I think.”
I lean in suddenly, flattening him against the cushions, and he yelps. Assuming that I just startled him, I don’t stop to investigate as I crash my mouth over his again and kiss him in earnest. He squirms a bit, clutching my shoulder, but doesn’t protest; it’s only a couple of moments later when I feel something wet under my chest that I pull away to find him clutching an empty champagne flute. I’d upended the contents of his glass all over him. There’s a large, wet patch on his grey t-shirt.
Grinning, Harry jumps to his feet. “Excellent,” he says happily and Malfoy looks more startled than anything else. “Thanks, Malfoy!”
Pulling out of reach, Malfoy strides forward, critically eyeing the long sofa upholstered in silver and blue before neatly sitting down, clasping his hands in his lap and studiously ignoring Harry as he pulls out his shrunken trunk and places it out of the way next to the sofa before tapping it with his wand to expand it back to full size.
Draco laughs lightly. “Well, I’m sort of glad I ran into the elf, Potter,” he says quietly. “I owe you and I want to help you. Should I start picking up your doses for you, maybe?” he asks with a little snigger.
. “Go back to whatever cupboard you were holed up in,” he says irritably, turning away and making his quick way upstairs.
“Yeah, Muggles like to pay for this sort of thing.”
“You can’t possibly tell anything about his expression from here!” Harry laughs, looking over to the stands once. “And there’s
“What the hell,” Draco murmurs under his breath, pushing his long ponytail back over his shoulder and hiding his flaming cheeks by sipping more tea. “I want to help you,” he says one more time.
“I am.”
Harry, is a persistent, nearly incapacitating need in Draco now, and when, several seconds later, he realises that Harry is moving, is walking down Draco’s hallway with Draco still wrapped around him, he starts sending out random, slightly hysterical prayers of gratitude. The nervousness that he ought to have felt during this moment, when he just
Harry’s hand is so unsteady suddenly that he has to hurriedly place his pint on the bar lest he drop it. Malfoy is shaking again, eyes scrunched up with mirth, the spinning shafts of lights from overhead once again reflected in his eyes, and glancing off his satiny hair.

Harry nods. “Because we fucked,” he repeats.

wouldn’t, I
Potter’s groin lands solidly on Draco’s and they’re both gasping into each other’s faces.
There's none of the crazed urgency of the night before – Potter’s hands don’t once turn rough or demanding on Draco – but there’s a sort of unfiltered, insatiable hunger in their kiss, in the way they touch each other, and Draco can do no more than just give into Potter’s mouth, slanting his head and winding their tongues together in a slippery tangle, helplessly drowning in the terrifying euphoria filling him.
“I can’t right now, I’ve to go meet with Erickson, apparently,” Draco says, irritably pushing her feet off the desk. “And clean your desk or something. Stop
“Fucking— fuck this.” He impatiently flaps one spidery hand at a burgundy wool coat, half-falling off its hanger between us and I help him shove it behind me with the rest of the clothes I’d carelessly pushed aside before pulling him in here. “Oh, yes,” he sighs when I bury my face into the side of his neck and lick. “Fuck, yes, Potter.”
to but, damn it all, he can’t dream of ever actually doing it.
With a deep breath, Draco slowly makes his way over, still garbed in the bathrobe as he climbs onto the bed, and crawls over to Harry, straddling his thighs with a sigh, letting his arms rest loosely on his shoulders.
He turns, his face automatically twisting into a scowl as his gaze lands on Ronald Weasley, lounging on the sofa with his ridiculously long legs hanging over the armrest. Weasley regards Draco with fascinated interest, like one would a three headed unicorn, and Draco wants to transform only so he can chuck a handful of fire at the idiot.
Okay,
“No,” I answer automatically as I hungrily gaze at him; I’ve never gone so long without seeing him. It’s been almost a fortnight. The urge to touch him is overwhelming.
“Goddammit, Malfoy. How did you find me?”
, Potter,” drawls a posh, terribly familiar voice from the doorway and Harry jerks, looking around with his face heating so quickly that he can feel sweat starting to bead on his brow. Malfoy leans one shoulder on the doorframe, crisp, slim-cut robes in a pale, sky blue cascading down his willowy frame as he lounges there and smirks, grey eyes
Harry can’t think, can’t function properly, when he can Draco are entwined like this, as tightly wound together as they are, Draco’s hands in his hair, his low whispers in his ear, his legs coiled around Harry’s waist in a nearly painfully tight grip. The reality of their relationship, of the fact that they even

“Absolutely nothing,” Malfoy answers smoothly. “I was simply walking by when I heard something about Potter fucking a cat--”

“You’ve got to believe me on this,” he says, silently pleased that he manages to sound rather steady. “Ginny and I are nothing but friends; she’s
Releasing his hair, Harry winds his hand around Malfoy’s neck, splaying his fingers gently across his bobbing throat and holding him in place like that, his balls drawing up against his body, too tight to slap at Malfoy’s arse now. “Draco,” he moans brokenly against his nape, his chest tight suddenly, throat constricting. “Draco.”
Saliva collects under his tongue from the pain and yet, that is not what he’s focusing on at the moment. Because Potter is
And then all Draco can see is Harry’s mouth, right there inches away, pink and slightly chapped, and he really should have been better prepared for this; he’d known Harry would be here, had thought he’s ready, and yet now it feels as though anything he says might accidentally reveal what he truly wants, what his whole being aches for.
“You look really good,” Harry murmurs, turning to face him.
Harry was back to staring at Malfoy now, not even bothering to be discreet about it. He didn’t know if he’d been waiting for someone to
I chew on my lip, not even embarrassed anymore. “He’s... I love him.”
“No.”
“Sure, I’ve seen him read before exams – or try to, at least.”

“Dad? Can we light a fire?”
“Want you so much,” Harry whispers, his cock now properly painful where it’s straining against the front of his boxers, “Going to fuck you so good, Malfoy.”
“I’m fine,” Malfoy grit out, fumbling unsuccessfully with the next button.
“It’s ten thirty-
Draco looks up now, half wanting to just backhand Potter across his stupid, handsome face, to break that expression of calm understanding and unfeigned compassion. Potter opens his mouth to speak and Draco braces himself for Potter’s fucking
“Why can’t we go get her?” he asked. “You said you don’t know if she’s dead for sure. Why can’t we go check?”
“Who is he?”
“Wait,
why I’m shaking—” Harry slaps his arse again, this time on the other cheek, “—fuck,
This time, Harry’s hands fly down onto Draco’s head, feathering briefly over his hair before, with what must’ve been an immense burst of self-control, he draws them back, curling them around the headboard and gurgling wetly as Draco obliges him with a sucking tug to his sac. With damp fingers, Draco pushes and kneads Harry’s taint, thumb pressing along the smooth stretch of his perineum over and over, until Harry is screaming expletives at the ceiling.
“Well, I’ve fought it off,” he says, looking and sounding rather blank.
