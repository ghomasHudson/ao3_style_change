, indeed. Now it finally felt as though Harry had done his part, and it was up to Hermione and Mrs Ackerman to sort it all out with the judge.
At Diagon Alley Harry found a nice interior design shop, not too posh, and selected that tablerunner that he’d thought about. He had never paid much attention to decoration, but now overwhelmed by the beautiful abundance, he couldn’t resist getting some new candles for the living room, and that vase for the flowers he had just bought. The shopkeeper seemed very eager to serve Harry, and gave him some chocolates from a nearby jar with his receipt.
Malfoy snorted humourlessly. “I wasn’t admired, I was feared, not such a pleasant situation when you find your family name’s been dragged through the mud,” he quirked his eyebrows and sat straighter, putting his cup down and brushing crumbs off his lap.
. Had there been something before? All those years ago? Was Narcissa right predicting that Malfoy did not only hate Harry?
“Thanks, Ginny. I don’t think he’s doing a lot right now, though,” Hermione gave out a long sigh and wiped her forehead as if she’d worked up a sweat.
After that, it was quiet for a long time. Harry cautiously keeping an eye on Malfoy, as he slowly approached the table again, and finally took a seat, his body limp. Even after that, he looked out of the window for a few minutes, before saying anything. “I never knew that,” he uttered simply, and didn't look like he was going to continue. His face had gone blank, the fire behind his eyes extinguished. Now he just looked exhausted, and Harry pitied him; he must have carried the matter around a lot more than Harry realized.
“How do you know?” Harry asked, but realized soon that if it was about something Narcissa had been warning Draco for weeks, she probably knew what he was talking about. The problem was, Harry didn’t know what either of them were talking about, and hoped that Narcissa hadn’t been warning Malfoy about not getting too close to Harry. In fact, he hoped it was the opposite of that.

“Lucius,” Harry responded in kind. He was too cold to produce a facial expression, polite or not, so he just settled for sitting there, teeth clanking, wishing he was home.
“I guess so,” Malfoy replied quietly. He was looking at Harry, but there was something soft in his eyes that Harry wanted to get closer to.
“That is correct,” replied Malfoy’s dry voice. This questioning was going to rob Harry of his will to live, he was sure.
“Right,” said Draco, and then he was quiet for some minutes, before continuing, “so why are you here to see me, exactly?” He put the last fork in its place in the kitchen drawer, and Harry almost dropped the kitchen towel he was drying his hands on. Why did Malfoy always have to make everything harder than it was? Harry hadn’t prepared for questions like this, he thought it would have been obvious why he had travelled to another country to see Malfoy. Now he found himself unable to articulate the exact reason.
Harry frowned. “’Course you’re free to leave, you’re here at your own volition,” he remarked, and now it was Malfoy’s time to blush, it was always from the ears, Harry noticed, even though he tried not to. He decided to ignore this detail that made his heart race and be so merciful as to change the subject. “So, how come you’re wearing muggle clothes, then?”
, story. There’s no excuse for acting like a shithead! However, before Harry had the time to express these thoughts, Malfoy continued, “I thought you were off the case though, so what are you doing loitering in my mother’s yard?”
“Cheers, mate,” Harry said and when he heard the door close behind him, he Incendio’d the fireplace. He slouched back on the chair and extended his legs. Harry had really had enough of mysterious initials and hunting down things… for the day, at least. Maybe forever.
They were quiet for a while, just lying there, before Harry decided to bring up something he had been wondering about. “When did you know you were gay?” he asked, and realized how abrupt it sounded. He had been thinking about what it was like to come out in the Malfoy family. As for himself, he didn’t remember ever being not fascinated about guys, too, but had never really thought about it explicitly, what with being with Ginny and all. Maybe he had never met a guy he was that interested in, until now.
For Harry, the next few minutes happened in slow motion: first, Patrick jumped to the doorway and cast Incarcerous, but apparently missed, since he immediately got blasted to the back wall of the room. Next, Harry ran to the front room and cast Expelliarmus on the short man. He was wearing a black cloak and a purple silk scarf around his neck, and his silver hair was flowing from the power of the spells suddenly filling the room. Every Auror in the place flooded the small store and Harry thought that there was no way that the man could escape now. That was, until he cast a strong Confundus on the room, that only Harry managed to block since he was expecting Dargan to hit him with something.
Now Hermione turned around at the sound of Harry entering the office. “Hermione, hi, what are you doing here? Is everything okay?” Harry asked very quickly, closing the door to give them some privacy.
“Good night, Potter,” Malfoy said while approaching the fireplace, his back turned to Harry. The moment seemed too abrupt, a minute ago they had still been sitting on Harry’s bed, talking. Only seconds ago Harry was sure the night would take a different turn entirely.
After flying, exhausted from the heat, Draco and Harry made the mutual decision to stay inside at least until it was a bit cooler to go out again. They cooked together in the apartment that had not yet been warmed up by the scorching summer sun. They sat at the table, talking, for what seemed like hours, sometimes glancing out onto the street from the window, to find that everyone else was also cooped up at home, safe from the extraordinarily hot day. After, they somehow ended up on the couch, sweaty and naked, Harry licking Malfoy’s salty neck. To tell the truth, Harry knew exactly how they wound up there – Draco had cheekily asked if Harry’s bum was still sore from the sunburn, and Harry had invited him to take a closer look. It didn't quite explain how Harry was now eating Draco out, with the man moaning and trembling under him, his hand desperately searching for release by jerking his cock. Harry couldn't help noticing how heavenly Draco’s whimpers sounded, his normally cool composure now completely wrecked by Harry’s tongue. He hoped the moans couldn’t be held by Moretti downstairs. Or rather, he only thought about it later.
Now Malfoy scowled and brushed his hair from his face forcefully. “We all know, Potter, you saw Cedric Diggory die when you were fourteen, you saw the rebirth of Voldemort, if there’s anyone in Britain that’s been through some horrid shit, it’s you,” his voice was biting and merciless.
know that there are only three bones in your arm, of which you regrew two. That’s seven and a half times less than you shattered last week.”
“Right,” Malfoy echoed, “goodbye then, Potter.” And before Harry could answer, Malfoy had already gone in a twirl of his forest green robes. It was like he was never there, and Harry preferred it that way. He turned his gaze upon the parchment notes, in a neat penmanship of the self-writing quill, it said
The man was making a fair point. Every time they started getting close to the real subject, Ridgenorth eluded it by changing the topic or by ridiculing them. “Reminds me of someone else I know…” Harry thought out loud while stroking his chin, and then he had a thought: avoiding the subject, arrogant manner… there was one other thing in that list that could perhaps be his downfall, should Ridgenorth have the same trait. “Hold on, I think I’ve got it, follow me,” Harry motioned for Patrick to accompany him back into the interrogation room.
or something of the like?” Ron managed to pronounce dating like he was holding back from vomiting out a slug, his face doing a thing resembling when one sees someone else vomiting out a slug.
Malfoy, not against him. They were gliding up the mountain, side by side, and only stopping to admire the scenery for a few seconds, before plummeting down again. Harry managed a daring loop in the air, and couldn't hold back a genuine laugh bubbling out of his chest.
Draco sighed deeply. “I’m sorry about that, and I’m sorry about everything else I’ve done, I’m just so fucking sorry about everything, you know,” he said seriously, shaking his head and turning it away from Harry, who suddenly had no answers.
okay? You’ve been acting odd lately…” his voice was very gentle, like someone about to start an intervention with
Harry sent out a feeler to the detainment office of the Ministry, who handled the personal information of people who passed through there. After a while, his memo glided back into his office with the last known address of Rory Birch. White, male, 22 years old, known address with his mother in a wizarding suburb. Harry decided to pay him a visit right away.
“’Course not, how have you been Ginny?” Harry smiled sheepishly and they shared a hug that was stiff but nice. It felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders, he hadn’t fully grasped how nervous he had been to see his ex-girlfriend again. Now that she was here though, Harry realized how much he had actually missed her. Not in the romantic sense, just, she knew him pretty much better than anyone, after all. He knew that she was probably the only person besides Ron that he could share anything with.
“What d’you mean, Dame Fortune?” Dargan caught the bait beautifully, Harry had been right, and now he just had to bring it home. He started pacing in front of the table, not frustrated, but casually.
Now that the topic had been more or less handled, it was time to get to the real reason they were there. “So, what’s the situation with your father, Draco?” Hermione asked, and got out a notepad and a quill from a brown leather briefcase Harry hadn’t noticed before. He realized she was about to go into lawyer mode, and felt more encouraged. Hermione could already do anything, but Lawyer Hermione would do everything and beyond.
“Even before Malfoy bought this place?” Harry asked redundantly, probably more to make discussion, instead of just standing there, browsing the shelves endlessly. He didn’t even know what half of the stuff was used for, he hadn’t been very good at potions. Unlike Malfoy, Snape’s favourite. Harry remembered their first ever potions class, where Snape had taken a liking to Malfoy. Harry had hated it back then, but in hindsight, he thought Snape would have been proud of Malfoy now. Proud of making something of himself.
“Then what is it?” the git insisted, he seemed so determined to find out why Harry had sent the note. Why were they both so adamant to get the other one to reveal something? Perhaps because they were both too cowardly to say something themselves.
heard Malfoy apologise and his eyebrows shot up to his hairline. He was speechless for a while, before realizing that it was his turn to speak. “Er– glad to see some things never change,” he uttered, and saw the corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitch as he was fighting to suppress a smile of some sort. The twit was just standing there in the middle of Harry’s office, and what Harry did next required an inhuman amount of willpower. He moved from behind his desk and strode over to Malfoy, extending his hand in a handshake. He noticed that Malfoy also looked a little bit green, and was pleased that he wasn’t the only one ready to implode. “Thank you for coming,” Harry said when Malfoy shook his hand, it was cold.
Now Harry presented him with a cup full of milky tea, and dared to sit down himself. “Right,” Harry took a sip from his cup, “can I ask you something?” The morning sun had already climbed up high, and was no longer making Harry sweat in his own dining room. The light made the gold streaks in Malfoy’s hair come out, though, which made Harry sweat anyway.
She gave an evaluative look up and down Malfoy’s slim figure, wrapped in black, which seemed to both confuse and amuse Draco. “Pleased to meet you mister Malfoy,” she uttered finally, and Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline, “I’m Rose Granger-Weasley, how do you do,” Rosie extended her right hand quite vigorously, and after some hesitant seconds, Malfoy grabbed to shake it. His hand was enormous compared with her tiny palm, but they seemed to manage.
Just when Harry was about to leave, Kingsley interrupted, “Just one more thing, Harry.” Harry turned back around to look at the man questioningly. “No more jumping through windows, clear?”
“Do you like it?” Harry heard himself ask. He hadn’t meant to bring it up, mainly because job opportunities for someone like Malfoy were probably not abundant, and he didn’t want to push it in case it got revealed that he didn’t like it. One reason for the question, though, might have been the fact that Harry was still thinking that Malfoy should take the job at Hogwarts, he was absolutely meant for it, but if the man had found his passion as a shopkeeper, then there was little to do about the matter.
“That? I was just reading more about the Marigold, but nothing useful yet,” Patrick said and bit the inside of his cheek in thought. Harry couldn’t wait to start interrogating Ridgenorth to find out if he was acting alone, or if in the coming years he would have to battle with a new criminal organization specializing in potions.
This was a meeting Draco wanted to get over with quickly, not only because of the unpleasant environment, but also because he did not find dealing with English wizarding folk overly pleasant in the last ten years. Now the man in front of him opened his beat-up briefcase to pull out pieces of parchment, a quill, and some ink.
, Harry thought, he had somehow managed to get himself sent to St Mungo’s. Robards would simply love that – they were understaffed as it was.
“Malfoy–“ Harry started, his voice so quiet it was practically a whisper. The man looked completely different from what he had back in England, and still so stunning. He was wearing beige slacks and a loose white linen shirt, his skin was sun kissed, only a memory of his pale complexion, and his hair had turned completely golden. His hair was longer, too, ruffled by the salty wind, and he was modelling a short stubble.
“I don’t think another letter would go over well,” Harry tried to hastily explain, and apparently Kingsley agreed, indeed the Malfoys weren’t the easiest family to deal with. The man gave him a nod, although a suspicious one at that.
Wednesday, it was hot again, reaching 30°C, and nearing 40°C in direct sunlight. Malfoy had a brilliant idea to rent a boat, which they could anchor in some small fold in the cove that was in the shade, somewhere more private. So, that’s what they did. They ended up with a small white boat, quite new from the looks of it, that had a simple sofa and a table on the other end, and the steering wheel on the other. Harry couldn’t not admire Malfoy, guiding the boat along the cove, in the yellow swimming trunks he had loaned Harry before, and his espadrilles, his golden hair ruffled in the wind, wearing sunglasses that made him look like a male model in one of the magazines aunt Petunia used to read. Harry didn't even care that he was staring.
Harry thought he wouldn’t mind being forty-five, going flying with his kids on a sunny spring day. He wouldn’t mind that at all. Evergrey probably didn’t realize how lucky he was. For now, Harry would have to settle for saying “Uneventful,” when asked about his plans. He didn’t want to think about Malfoy’s visit, but at the same time he couldn’t get it out of his mind – how he had talked about his father, and Voldemort making him become a Death Eater, and how the poor git had thought that he would actually have to be the one to kill Dumbledore. Moreover, Harry was quite sure he would never see Malfoy again, and now he just had to get over the whole thing. He wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or sorry about Malfoy leaving, although it didn’t matter, because he was feeling both.
“Speaking of school,” Harry started, “I bet you’ll never guess who released Buckbeak in year three.” He very near grinned when Malfoy gave him an incredulous look, maybe resulting from the sudden change of tone, but Harry hoped it was because what they had done was so very absurd.
Harry had chuckled into his delicious mouth and pulled away reluctantly. “I have to go, I’ll see you at the hearing.”
“Harry! Mate! Merry Christmas,” came Ron’s relieved voice as Draco joined the lot in the foyer. They were all wearing various holiday outfits, with puffy coats and knitted wool hats. Ron was handing a bottle of wine to Draco, who accepted it with a polite smile and a ‘thank you’, followed by a ‘Merry Christmas’, which started a wave of everyone saying
Harry tried to think of the last thing he remembered before waking up in this criminally comfortable bed. All of his memories felt terribly faded, like he was trying to remember something from a drunken night: everything was just out of reach and somehow disjointed. He remembered answering an emergency call with Ron, but nothing from the actual mission. Where had they gone? Was it Watford? Or Harrow? Somewhere further away?
A few hours later, what felt like minutes to Harry between falling asleep and waking up again, he woke up to Malfoy squirming on the bed. The man was grabbing onto the sheets and twisting left and right, breathing heavily and muttering something. Before Harry had a chance to reach out to wake him up, Malfoy started repeating
“I guess that’s up to them,” Harry replied simply. He couldn’t think of anything more to say, his head felt completely blank. Malfoy was standing in his hallway, dressed to leave, yet Harry did nothing. He did absolutely nothing, and he already knew he would blame himself for it. But, whatever he had intended to do or say, the moment wasn’t right for it.
Minutes went by, and Harry was pacing around his bedroom again, waiting for a note to fly onto his bed. As seconds passed, he became more convinced that he wouldn’t hear back. What if the note hadn’t gone to the Malfoy residence? What if Harry assumed that the man didn’t care enough about him to reply, but in fact he never got the note? Maybe Narcissa had gotten it? Thrown it away? Or maybe they were asleep, or away from home, or… maybe Harry should write another note that he would clearly address to Malfoy? No, what if he received the first one and then would get the other one straight after? No, no, no.
“On another note, Mr Mulpepper did not have insurance on his shop, and filed for compensation of lost merchandise. I had to have a long chat with Kingsley to calm him down, you know how he is these days,” Harry grimaced, and Patrick settled for rolling his eyes. They didn’t have to say it, but they both thought that catching a dangerous criminal was far more important than a few galleons off the Ministry’s budget.
“You didn’t know how your parents died?” Malfoy asked suddenly, he had now turned his face to Harry, measuring his expression with his eyes. That moment Harry realized how much Draco didn’t know about him, and how much he didn’t know about Draco. He hoped that he could learn more, and he wanted to open up to the man about his life. He didn’t even know where to start. They had already gone through some things, but Harry was still surprised how little Malfoy actually knew about his background. He had pretty much gotten used to the fact that everyone knew him better than he knew himself, and now the man was asking him if he had known about Voldemort.
Molly was the first one to reach Harry and she wrapped him in a huge embrace. “Harry dear, I’m so glad you could make it,” she said and let go of him. She smelled like cinnamon and candles, there was flour in her hair from baking, and her apron was swung around on her back so she wouldn’t smudge people’s clothes as she was hugging them.
Harry felt a flush creeping from head to toe. “Right, sorry, ‘course not, I just wanted… er, I don’t know, more time with you, maybe?” he was mumbling and scratching the back of his head again, swaying on his feet a bit. Fuck, fuck, fuck,
Malfoy placed his hands on both sides of Harry’s waist, and his eager tongue licked from around his balls, the base of his penis, and kissed his thighs. Harry felt Malfoy’s warm breath teasing him, before finally moving his hands to grab his arse cheeks and taking the tip into his mouth. It was hot and very wet, Harry let out a sharp breath. The man started moving his head up and down, saliva dripping down on Harry’s groin and on the sheets. It was so incredibly sexual that Harry reflexively started moving his hips, fucking into Draco’s wet mouth, who took it all obediently. The man let out a moan, the sound vibrating in his throat and making Harry see stars. Draco propped himself on his elbows, and wrapped his one hand around Harry’s balls, while reaching the other to gently rim Harry, which released an uncontrollable groan from Harry’s mouth. He wanted Draco to fuck him, just like he had done before, no matter that his arse was still sore from it. The finger relentlessly slipping in and out of him soon turned into two fingers, finding his prostate and massaging it, all the while Malfoy’s other hand had found its way to stroke Harry’s cock along his mouth. Harry’s mind was filled with images, each dirtier than the last, until he could feel an orgasm, far away like an ocean wave, rolling towards him, inevitable, and finally, washing over him and hard, like his body was carried to the shore by its strength. Harry moaned and came, and came, and it felt like it lasted forever, Malfoy carrying on relentlessly, only stopping once Harry had fallen limp on the bed.
Harry decided to not waste one moment giving a shit about the opinion of Lucius fucking Malfoy, decidedly the worst of the Malfoys. “What ways exactly?” he challenged, narrowing his eyes, “Being loved by someone? Merlin knows he’s never gotten that from you.” Harry crossed his arms where he was sitting, leaning back in his chair, facing Lucius’ stare like it was nothing.
“I won’t miss the weather, that’s for damn sure,” the man scoffed, and seemed irritated that Harry hadn't caught on to his little insinuation.
“It’s getting there, according to Jameson at the Department of Mysteries, it’s ready in approximately three days, we just have to hang in there,” Evergrey sighed and lifted his hands to massage his temples. Three days, Harry could wait three days, at least then he’d have something to distract him and he could direct all of his energy into interrogating that bastard Ridgenorth.
Just when Draco was about to get out of the booth and leave the foul pub behind, there was a loud bang in the middle of the room, and a bunch of Aurors flooded the muggle establishment. Draco instinctively withdrew to the shadows in the corner of the booth and pressed his back against the wall, this was quite literally the last thing he wanted. He had just wanted to come to London in order to help his mother get adjusted and then leave as quickly as he arrived. Now Draco had a feeling it wouldn’t be quite so simple.
Harry could feel a bright red blush creep from his neck to his face. “Er, yes, I was… it didn’t work out in the end,” he tried to chuckle nonchalantly, but the voice got stuck to his throat, so he just ended up letting out an odd coughing sound. Talking about his love life with the git for a second time already made Harry start sweating again.
He had sat up on the bed, and looked around the room. The walls were a pale sandy colour, and in the far wall, the chimney of the downstairs fireplace travelled along the wall and through the ceiling. There was a shelf on the right side of the chimney, next to the bed, with some books and a plant on it. On the left side, near the huge windows, there was a comfortable looking lounge chair. Outside the windows, there was a tiny balcony, just narrow enough for someone to stand on and admire the scenery. To Harry’s left, opposite to the stairs, there were two doors, but he hadn’t known where they led to.
Harry hugged her back. “Do what?” he asked suspiciously. If it wasn’t an emergency, why was Hermione in his office? Maybe she had a case for him from the Department of Magical Law, they sometimes consulted Aurors to back up their evidence, or even requested someone to be detained.
“Well, cheers,” Harry said, suddenly a bit awkward by the unexpected compliment, “you were good on the broom too,” he replied, after realizing that he should probably return the praise. And he wasn’t just saying that, it was true, Malfoy had been flying ever since he was little, something Harry didn’t have the privilege of doing. They were both good, and they both had it in their blood.
Buckthorn’s eyes widened a little when he heard Harry’s question. “Bloody hell, Potter. You really must want this person caught.”
What would Harry have to do for everyone to stop worrying about him so much? Probably avoid getting into exceedingly dangerous situations, for starters. Although as Malfoy had so graciously pointed out, he didn’t even have that many people who cared about him. Maybe he shouldn’t be so resistant to Evergrey’s worry.
There was a pang of pity in Harry's chest, as he took Draco’s hand into his own. It was cold and sweaty. He didn't know what to say, except that he knew what it was like to love your dad who was or was in the brink of being gone forever. “You know,” he started, “I think you deserve good things happening to you without anyone trying to take them away. You’ve worked hard for everything you have, and I know you feel like this is a punishment, but it’s not. It’s an adversity that would have occurred either way. We’ll get through it, I promise.”
Harry was silent for a very long time. Malfoy… liked him? That was undeniably the largest bombshell Harry had received in years. He wanted to deny that he might have felt similar feelings towards seeing the git around, and he did. Although, Malfoy had helped him that day to get to St Mungo’s. So, Malfoy
The feeling in Harry’s chest might have been pathetic self-pity, but he chose to interpret it as excitement and went over to give Hermione and Ron both another hug. “Congratulations!” Harry exclaimed, “I’m really happy for you both, Rosie is so great, and I can’t wait to meet whoever’s next.”
Harry crossed his arms on his chest, all of this was completely unfair. He didn’t have anything to taunt Malfoy with – he had been perfectly adequate as a magical physician. “I don’t know, maybe you were there for… for…” Harry couldn't come up with one explanation why Malfoy would’ve been roaming about in Healer robes and ID unless he was actually… well, a Healer.
Both of them were quiet for a long while. Harry was still fidgeting with his keys, and the bitter damp air started getting inside his coat and freeze his bones. It was half an hour to midnight, and the cold combined with his fatigue made him tremble most slightly. To his horror, Malfoy seemed to notice this, and astonishingly extended his heating charm on Harry with a discreet swish of his wand. A warm wave of dry air filled Harry immediately, and he lowered his arms from where they were, clutched around him to keep the heat inside. That was probably the nicest thing Malfoy had ever done for Harry, except for saving his life that one time, but this was quite remarkable nonetheless. Harry nodded as a thank you, because his jaw was still numb with cold.
Now the git spun around in his chair to face Harry. “It’s the reason I’m giving you,” he stated firmly, “now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to talk about anything else, maybe more of your childhood trauma?” he slouched back into the chair, taking a deep breath and looking away, “Tell me, Potter, what were your aunt and uncle like?” he asked, closing his eyes and facing the sun.
That night he couldn’t sleep, it felt like every time he was drifting off, a stinging pain from one of the damaged bones woke him up, and he had to admit to himself that a little drop of the painkiller he had gotten from the hospital wouldn’t hurt. He took a small gulp of the bitter liquid and within minutes it had taken effect, minutes after that Harry was already asleep in his bed.
“You could tell me why you’re here, for starters,” Harry lifted his eyebrows and noticed that sensation was returning to his face, he wasn’t going to let go of this question as long as Malfoy was there. It was such an obvious question to ask too, he couldn’t believe Malfoy was just blatantly
“Ever planning to return to England for good?” Harry seriously had to stop interviewing Malfoy, but he couldn’t stand the silence between them, it didn’t feel comfortable in the slightest.
Both Harry and Patrick raised their wands at the doorway. A muffled voice in the other room could be heard, but they couldn’t make out what it said. “Fuck, what’s he saying?” Patrick hissed, and started to inch towards the door. Harry grabbed his arm, indicating him to stop, because he had just found something in his pocket that would help them. He pulled out the Extendable Ears, and silently opened the package. He then pulled out his wand, and managed to levitate the first ear close to the crack in the door. He held up the other ear close for him and Patrick to hear.
“Very well, let’s hear it,” Malfoy lifted his chin and fixed his posture as if he was preparing himself to receive some horrid news, which he kind of was.
The last sunrays of the day were making the thick sheath of snow glisten in gold and orange, making the fields and naked trees glitter brightly. It was only approaching 4pm, but the sun was already descending behind the thick forest on the far right. The lake that could usually be clearly seen to the house in the summertime, was now just a steady mirror of ice, and one couldn’t see the marks of ice skates on it even if they squinted very hard.
While the lot were peeling off their layers, Noah ran down the steps, wearing his deep blue Weasley sweater with a large N on the front of it. His hair was already a mess, but Draco decided to let it go, it was Christmas Eve after all. He remembered too many holidays from his childhood that included horribly itchy woollen robes and extra strong hair gel. His son could whatever he wanted, and not worry about his hair, and now he and Hugo were already running back up the steps to play in his room. They were the same age, and would go to Hogwarts at the same time. Sometimes Draco wondered if they’d be in the same house, and which house his son would make it to. He always concluded that it wouldn’t matter to him, as long as he was happy.
you? Well, Harry really only needed to get his matter out, not consult Malfoy per se. Should he write ‘Malfoy, I need to speak to you’, but which Malfoy was he referring to then? ‘Draco’ would be way over the line. Eventually, Harry just ended up leaving the note as is, only adding his initials at the bottom, even though he knew that Malfoy would most probably know who it was from. At least he hoped.
“Malfoy, fancy seeing you here,” Harry grinned at the blond man awkwardly sitting in one of the chairs in the Ministry waiting room on Level Two:
look the same as ten years ago? He wasn’t as skinny anymore, but his black hair was still a mess, he was too lazy to change his glasses, he had had a beard a year ago, but he shaved it off because it made him feel too old.
“I think you’re not going to answer it,” Harry said, truthfully. He knew that the brick wall was looming up ahead, the one that always pushed him on his arse. Malfoy had avoided all questions nearing the subject with care, and Harry was disbelieving that the git would suddenly change his approach.
with Malfoy, of all the sodding people. Luckily, he had forgotten something at his desk, and Harry had quickly bid him good night and slipped away.
Harry felt a red flush crawl from under his hospital gown onto his ears and to his face. If his bone-dry love life was ever going to pick up, he hoped to Godric Gryffindor that the object of his affections would never ever find the chocolates in his possession. He wouldn’t be caught dead having them. Harry cleared his throat and studied the red box, “Laced with some type of love potion, I presume?”
name,” Harry couldn’t help the cynical tone that coloured his voice and he accompanied it by rubbing his chin thoughtfully. He would milk this situation as much as he could.
“Or… you know,” Harry bit his lip again, “you could come straight here?” In any other situation he would have hated to sound so desperate but, right now, he couldn’t have cared less. He wanted Draco, quite fucking badly.
Now Malfoy went serious, and his voice was quiet. “Whatever happened in that maze?” he asked, “You and Diggory were gone for a long time, and when you turned up…” he couldn't even finish his sentence, how did he expect Harry to fare? Harry was wondering if he wanted to share the events of that night with Malfoy, it had probably been one of the most traumatic experiences he’d ever experienced, though maybe Malfoy would understand and realize that they had both been through some horrid things. After all, they had already shared some gruesome things so far in the conversation, what was one more? It could be therapeutic.
“Thank you, er, should I wait here or…?” Harry was unsure what to do, he was shuffling his feet a bit, leaning from one side to the other. Admittedly, he was a bit disappointed that Malfoy hadn’t been at the shop himself, but also acknowledged that he had arrived completely unannounced, to intrude in the man’s life. What if he was with someone? Even more dreadful, what if he was
“Yes!” she announced gleefully, “I… I flew with my bwoom in the backyawd the whooooole day, mum says I fly so much I’m gonna forget how to walk, but it doesn’t bother me because then I can just fly evewywhere!” Rosie accompanied her enthusiastic narration with large hand movements that nearly swept Harry’s glasses off his face a couple times.
Kingsley nodded affirmatively. “Lovely, I’ll get the paperwork started, you can owl Mrs Malfoy tomorrow.”
bed, maybe his hand might have travelled somewhere unsavoury, maybe Harry could have helped him… lifted his shirt and ran his hand on his bare skin, his sides, his chest, down to his trousers… Malfoy catching his breath… Harry’s hand slowly found its way into his own pants, under the duvet. No one would ever know, it was completely private, he was alone in his bed, under the covers, in the dark. When Harry tried to picture the blond man from his gym, the only thing he could see was Malfoy’s face, his bicep, and he couldn't even be sorry. Various images flashed in Harry’s brain, Malfoy under him squirming, Malfoy naked, Malfoy pushing him against a wall, kissing him fiercely.
There was a silence that almost lasted too long for Draco’s comfort, with everyone apparently trying to process the logic behind Draco’s tangent, before Hermione shrugged in agreement. “Draco’s right, and what with your lovely house, it would be a shame to not decorate it. Honestly, I have no clue how you managed to find something so charming.”
“Will do,” Malfoy smirked, “and don’t worry Potter, I won’t be going anywhere for a bit, neither is my mother.” And with that, the tall man was gone, the door slowly closing behind him.
Harry took a deep breath, he could do this. He couldn’t quite feel his legs, but they worked, didn’t they? With one determined shove, Harry pushed himself off the bed, and lunged forwards, except that his feet didn’t exactly step forward so much as just wobbled and gave up, and so, Harry found himself on the floor of his hospital room.
Harry wrapped his cloak around him tighter as they took a right turn at the entrance. “Speaking of… where do you want to go to eat?” He had to admit that he wasn’t very familiar with the dining options in the area. Or any area for that matter, he rarely went out to eat, maybe he should.
“The elections are still four months away, hang in there, Harry,” Evergrey called out when Harry was already making his way to the door.
before shooting up to sit, sweat glistening on his forehead, his shoulders rising and falling from breathing too quickly, fists still squeezing the blanket. He was staring straight forward, not seeing anything.
Malfoy turned to Harry, his hands balled into fists. “You can get my mother released! She’s innocent and you know it! You’re just doing this in order to… to…” Draco was turning dark red, and his voice was getting choked up from whatever bundle of rage he was feeling. Harry didn’t care to know.
“Uh-huh, is that why you were blushing as soon as he said hi?” Ron smiled mischievously and did not break eye contact while having a sip from his pint.
Instead, Harry decided it was better to change the subject, before Malfoy had the chance to dish out any additional petty insults. “Cheers, er, can I get you something? Coffee, tea?”
An enraged expression came over Lucius’ already discontented face as he started hissing at Harry: “How dare you address me by my first–“
Abruptly, Harry pulled away from the kiss to stare into Draco’s silvery eyes, and gave himself permission to sound soppy. Frankly, he didn’t care about his image anymore, “Will I ever see you again?” he asked, trying to find the answer in the man’s face. The horrible pit in his stomach had returned upon realizing that this might well be the only night that they’d ever share.
, of all the unfortunate souls who could have crossed Harry’s path. He had not thought about Malfoy for ten blissful years, after the Wizengamot had shipped his parents off to Azkaban. Harry had tried to get out of serving at their trial, there was just something about deciding the fate of a schoolmate, even if it was Draco sodding Malfoy, but the Wizengamot had been quite adamant about his participation. As much as he had hated Malfoy, Harry still preferred to not reminisce the trial where he had to attest to the atrocities Lucius had committed under Voldemort’s command, the colour escaping Draco’s already pale face. There was not much he could have done to help Narcissa either, except for testifying that when she could have told Voldemort that Harry was still alive in the forest, she didn’t. She was found guilty of aiding the Death Eaters.
“How am I supposed to know what you’re doing half the time? Besides, I told you now, I don’t see a reason for you to get all worked up about it,” Theseus said, and then snapped his mouth shut, probably for forever.
Harry delivered a sharp knock on Narcissa Malfoy’s front door. His heart was beating out of his chest when he was listening out for footsteps inside, that would indicate someone approaching the door to open it. After about thirty seconds, just when Harry was about to raise his hand to give another knock, the door swung open. A tiny silent gasp escaped his lips. On the other side of the threshold stood Malfoy, and he was a sight to see: the man was wearing short sand coloured slacks that were a bit too tight for Harry’s wellbeing, and a white long-sleeved V-neck, his hair lazily brushed to the side; despite his otherwise casual appearance, he was still shaved. Harry had never seen Malfoy wear such light colours outside of the school button down, and seeing him now in this carefree look made Harry gulp desperately. Seeing Malfoy like this certainly made him feel some type of way, but he was not ready to explore it. At the same time, Harry felt like he had intruded the Malfoys’ intimate life, like he was only supposed to see them while they were dressed to impress.
Still, Harry felt uncomfortable, and grabbed the nearest shirt from the back of a chair. It was an old tee from Auror training, an ugly grey colour with yellow seams and a yellow Ministry logo that was peeling off from the corners. The shirt nicely contrasted his blue and white pyjama pants, making him look like he was covered in Gargoyle vomit. How stylish.
Draco’s mouth quirked into a coy smile. “I suppose that would require a second date, then, wouldn’t you say?”
,” there it was, the oh-so-familiar spitting out his name. Malfoy was visibly shaking from rage, his grey eyes gleaming with the usual longing to strangle Harry at the spot.
“Oh, wake up, Harry!” Kingsley huffed irritably, “They’re all murderers, they’ve slaughtered hundreds of magical folk combined, we’re doing everyone a favour here,” the way he said it, like it was clear as day and that Harry was just not able to see it, made Harry feel like he was being treated like a child – too naïve for the company he was in, and that really got under his skin in the worst way. He was just as competent a government official as any; it was Kingsley who had been brainwashed to go through with this horrific plan.
“Hey Harry, how have you been? Any more hospital visits?” he inquired and gave him a mischievous smile. Harry hadn’t seen him so carefree in a decade, his hair was combed and the dark circles from under his eyes had vanished.
“Well, we don’t know how long this is going to take, so better have a contingency plan, don’t you think?”
“Can I see it?” Harry asked, not only because he wanted an excuse to get closer to Malfoy, but also because he was truly curious to see what the tattoo looked like after all of these years.
The blond man shook his head and stuck his hands in his pockets, which made the front of his slacks tighten further – Harry had to quickly look back into Malfoy’s eyes to preserve his peace of mind. “We all disappoint ourselves, Potter. I’m disappointing myself right now,” he added. Why did the bastard have to be so cryptic? Was he disappointing himself for talking to Harry?
The man shook his head, looking at Harry, horrified. “It’s not true,” he whispered, now changing colour from white to green. He looked like he didn't know whether it was safest to not look at Harry directly, or to keep him under surveillance. Neither of the approaches would change the situation as it was.
“What?” came the git’s question, his tone almost annoyed, but there was nothing hostile in his expression. On the contrary, he looked almost relieved, relaxed, lying next to Harry. His hair was spread out over the pillow, wonderfully dishevelled, and it made Harry feel very soft for the man. The way they lied there next to each other, just two people who could be anyone, the rough fabric of the sheets on their naked bodies.
“I know he’s been coming to see you, and even if he’s trying to hide it, I know he’s taken a liking to you.” That was the final nail in Harry’s coffin, how did she know? Harry couldn’t imagine Malfoy being the most talkative type, telling his mother his goings on. Another thing that Harry was utterly confused about, was the fact that Narcissa somehow thought Malfoy
“Ugh, Harry, can’t you see? He’s taken the first step, coming to you over and over again, you have to meet him in the middle here,” Hermione was making hand movements to demonstrate her points and almost knocked over her glass. Harry could hear from her tone that she was getting frustrated with his passivity about the whole matter.
Before Harry could ask Malfoy what on earth he was doing at his place once again, the git already had his explanation at the ready: “Your blasted Ministry is performing a search on my mother’s house and they kicked us out.” He was glaring at Harry, like he himself had suggested such a search. It didn’t make sense though, why would they search Narcissa’s things? Harry felt awkward even thinking about the not-so-gentle reminder Malfoy must have gotten from when the Manor had been searched and sealed.
“Right, cheers.” Harry accepted the vials and slipped them in his pocket. This hadn’t really gone exactly the way he hoped. To tell the truth, he hadn’t really known what he was attempting to do, he had always been better at winging things than planning them. Next time he’d just have to dye his pubes blue or something. “Malfoy, are you okay? You seem a bit… off.” Harry simply couldn’t hold the question inside, he was an Auror for Merlin’s sakes. It was his job to observe and ask questions.
“Suppose that’s fair,” Harry admitted, then decided to return the remark: “like you had any hobbies,” he said. It was still a tad unclear to him what Draco did his entire school career, except bully everybody into being his lackeys. Harry only remembered him being on the Quidditch team on and off. On the other hand, Draco hardly had any idea what Harry had been doing the whole time, either. They would hopefully have much more time to talk about it.
Harry gave a long sigh, and refrained from reaching out to Draco, he was quite sure he wouldn't enjoy the gesture. “You’re always fighting so hard, it’s like everyone is out to get you,” he said quietly. Every time Harry had interacted with Malfoy, he had always been an arrogant git, and Harry had always assumed it was because they hated each other. They didn’t hate each other anymore, not even close, so why was the man still pushing him away?
“Since I was a boy!” the man yelped, “Signore, many years.” He must have known lots about potion-making then, because he looked like he was approaching retirement age twice over.
Malfoy shook his head determinedly. “I don’t want to return to that foul place,” he scoffed. That was fair, there were an abundance of unpleasant memories having to do with Hogwarts in Harry’s mind too, but he always first and foremost associated the school with home. The same couldn’t be said for Malfoy.
,” Malfoy paused for a few seconds, and then looked a little bit uncomfortable as he continued, in a low voice, “to tell you the truth, you looked pretty bad, there was quite a lot of blood and you weren’t responding. I merely helped Patrick bring you here, that’s all.”
Fucking, fucking hell. “Right,” was the only thing he could muster. He wanted to say that it had been mutual but… it really, really hadn’t been.
Now a sharp knock at the door made Draco pull away from his kiss with Harry, and give an annoyed glance at the front door. “It’s them,” Harry said, still looking at Draco’s lips. He planted one last peck on them before smoothing out his own hair, and making a start for the large front doors to welcome Ron and Hermione, with Rosie, Hugo, and Ben in tow.
Draco glanced at Harry to back him up, but the git just shrugged in amused defeat. He really didn’t know how to be the strict parent, that part always fell to Draco, blast it. “Fine,” he huffed, but rolled his eyes affectionately, “why don’t you go change into the sweater Mrs Weasley made you last year? Do you know where it is?” Draco suggested, and Noah nodded his head eagerly, already darting out of the room and up the steps.
Harry could feel himself going red, it was once again creeping up his neck and spreading onto his face and ears. “Well, er, it’s… um–“ he started squirming in his seat, scratching the back of his head. What could he say? He wasn’t sure what they were doing. He wanted to say that they were dating, he wanted to say that very badly, but it had only been a week. A gorgeous week, but a week nonetheless, and though Harry wanted many more of them, no, he couldn’t say they were dating, per se.
“Yes, you’re right. I should probably let her know…” Harry felt uneasy, and it was almost impossible for him to sit still in the chair, he wanted to jump up and Apparate straight into Malfoy’s house. But at the same time, he felt nervous to death at the thought. Be that as it may, he felt was too anxious to be having a normal conversation about work.
“Harry, is it true that Draco Malfoy came by the Ministry yesterday?” She asked, bringing napkins for the three of them.
Draco was asking Harry about his work, and mouth full, he told him about Kingsley’s most recent desperate measures to get re-elected as the Minister.
Harry nodded slowly and reached for his own tea, still steaming gently. He realized he was getting hungry, and picked up a scone from the tray. He was waiting for Malfoy to continue. “Perhaps I’m trying to atone, who knows,” Malfoy took another sip, “after this year I’ll continue to the Potions training.”
Draco sighed again, and seemed to sink deeper into the sofa, clutching the now almost empty tea mug. “No, I suppose not,” he mumbled.
On Saturday morning, Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, finishing his breakfast and reading the
times. “But… the other day, at the pub, it was a coincidence that we were there at the same time,” Harry argued, and hated how weak his assertion sounded.
People were huddling around the vegetable stands and the fresh flowers that had arrived that morning. Harry picked up all sorts of stuff, maybe even too much for just him, and quite honestly wasn’t even sure what the half of it was. What does one do with a fennel anyway? Harry walked past the flower stand many times, until finally he caved in and purchased two blue hydrangeas, for which he would have to conjure a huge vase somehow. The witch selling the flowers smiled at Harry very kindly.
“Thank you for that evaluation,” Ron intercepted flatly, Harry realized that he might not have been so happy about Malfoy meeting his daughter, “should we sit around the table, d’you reckon?” he continued tensely and swooped around the three of them to disappear into the kitchen. Harry wished he could somehow make them all get along, painfully remembering how long it took himself to come around, and Ron wasn’t even falling in love with Malfoy (hopefully).
“Hey! I go to the gym now,” Harry protested weakly, handing Malfoy back the bottle, fully aware that the man wasn’t talking about the now, “but yes,” Harry had to admit, “it used to be my only hobby… aside from trying to figure out what shady business you were always up to,” he smirked. Ah, yes, the two hobbies he had had: flying and stalking Malfoy. To his defence, Draco had always seemed like he was up to something, other times he was merely pestering Harry.
She looked a little bit more comfortable already, and motioned Harry to join her in the living room. There was a sofa and two armchairs, along with a coffee table and one small plant on it. There wasn’t even a rug in the room, let alone decorations of any kind. “Yes, thank you, I’m still getting my things in order, that includes acquiring some more furniture,” she smiled shyly and directed Harry to take a seat in an armchair near the fireplace, “can I get you anything, coffee, tea?” Her voice echoed in the half empty room.
Malfoy’s long fingers wrapped around the shaft of Harry’s dick and started jerking it gently while sucking the tip deeper and deeper. Harry had to squeeze his eyes shut but couldn’t hold back a moan. This seemed to egg Draco on, because he picked up the pace slightly, but not too much. Harry felt all of the blood in his body gather in his crotch as he neared orgasm, still all his limbs felt hot. He grabbed the sheets for emotional support and his breath quickened. A thought popped into his head,
He nodded, looking a bit more peaceful. “I think you might be right,” he said, “and thanks… for, you know, not pissing off and leaving me and mum to deal with this, I know, I know, it’s not who you are but, I suppose I’m not used to kindness.”
“Weasley,” Draco replied factually, seeming bashful. Harry had never heard him say the name without sneer, and it sounded odd in his ears, but clearly, Draco had come here to reconciliate. That’s all Harry could ask of either of them anyway.
, and Harry couldn’t do an Accio on his wand either to dry himself up. He suddenly felt very exhausted and settled for emptying the water glass and setting it on a table within his reach. He just needed to relax, everything would be fine. Except that he couldn’t relax, he needed to know where Ron was, and he needed to know right now.
“Right, in this case brewing and selling illegal memory potions. Has Dubois been interrogated about this? Maybe she knows what the M denotes,” Harry wrapped the ring back into the handkerchief and handed it to Isaac.
He looked inside, it was empty. There was only a table with two chairs on either side, and a small window on the wall, where one could see the dementors hovering by. There was another chill going through Harry, as he stepped into the cold room, his bones feeling like they were turning into ice inside of him. He took a seat in one of the chairs, and stared at the wall, seconds feeling like hours; he thought he couldn’t get out of that place fast enough. He couldn't wait to be back home, warm, feeling somewhat happy again, maybe with Draco.
“Will do,” Patrick nodded, “so, I have to admit my memory is a bit fuzzy about the events of the other day, mind filling me in?”
“I’m good thanks, George. How are you? How’s the shop? Thanks for the… er… presents, you sent me,” Harry gave him an uncomfortable smile remembering the love chocolates that were still lying somewhere in his kitchen.
He walked along the street for a minute before finding 101A, the first apartment in a row of terraced houses. Harry opened the iron gate carefully and took a few steps to cross the paved trail to the front door. The still untended front yard remained to his left, weeds sticking out of the tall grass. The house was quite modern: the smooth white walls were contrasted by black window frames and there were large windows to the garden. Said garden looked like a work in progress still, Harry thought.
Now the bastard raised his chin to emphasize the sneering face he was making at Harry, he arrogantly flung his hair from his face with one flick of his neck. “Is that so? It’s like she was never guilty of your accusations after all…” his voice was mocking and he was looking right at Harry while he crossed his arms and leaned against the doorframe. What a smug cock.
But Malfoy’s answer pulled the rug from under Harry. “Force of habit, I suppose,” he shrugged nonchalantly. Every time Harry thought he had him in a corner he just straight up admitted to being a knob, but bloody hell how Harry hated the
“And, more importantly,” Harry continued, feeling like the words were just gushing out of him at this point, “I want to make
Now Hermione let out a frustrated sigh and gave Harry a very final stare. “Look, even if he doesn’t feel the same way, you’ll feel loads better having explored the option than if you’re left to wonder.” Harry hated when she made good points, because they never let him off the hook.

In the letter were all the things that Evergrey had talked about, and more. The core message was that Kingsley thought Harry’s actions had been reckless and had not only endangered him, but had also made Kingsley look like an unfit chief, but that he hoped Harry was feeling better soon. It also said that Harry would have to take sick leave for seven days, and that upon his return he would be off the case because of his ties to the Malfoy family. Harry read the letter quickly, sighed, and closed it, chucking the parchment aside on the table.
Harry’s hand was working steadily in parallel with his mouth, and for a good five minutes it was silent again. Draco’s breathing was heavy and his hand was tangled in Harry’s hair. Harry was obediently keeping his rhythm, although his hand might have picked up the pace a little. Just when his jaw was starting to ache, Draco suddenly tugged at Harry’s hair, and Harry lifted his head in time to see the glistening white discharge shoot out the tip of Malfoy’s cock. It was spreading onto his stomach and bellybutton.
Draco’s face scrunched up and he pursed his lips while staring at the ceiling. “I think I have,” he said eventually, but didn’t continue.
Malfoy looked up, startled out of his thoughts, and there was a flash of something in his eyes as he took in Harry’s presence: his fitted black jacket and trousers – albeit a tad wrinkled and the topmost button of his jacket open – completed with dragonhide boots, a bit muddy but sturdy. Quickly, whatever emotion had been on Malfoy’s face was extinguished and the corner of his mouth turned into a mocking smile that Harry didn’t much appreciate. “Stylish, I can always count on you looking like you’ve woken up from a ditch somewhere,” Malfoy scoffed and stood up, straightening his trousers.
Harry had to take a break halfway through, he realized that the people sitting around them were still the same. No one had left or arrived, everyone was sipping on their drinks lazily, talking with each other. Harry realized that dining here wasn’t just about eating, it was about socializing, relaxing, and the food and wine only facilitated that. Harry gave a look in Malfoy’s direction, who was also eyeing the restaurant. “I get it now,” he said suddenly.
“Sì, signor, grazie mille,” said the clerk, Moretti, and was nodding eagerly at Malfoy, who was already ascending the staircase, still holding the bags. Harry gave a polite smile at the man behind the counter, and then hurried after Malfoy, closing the door behind them. The staircase was narrow, but bright, and soon Harry found out why. When they reached the first floor, he noticed that there were windows to every direction from the platform. But what was more stunning, were the enormous glass doors in the living room, displaying the breathtaking view of the sea and the bay, with nothing obstructing the view. Harry dropped his very heavy rucksack on the ground and made his way past the sofas to stand in front of the view.
, struggled with his landing, and barely managed to keep his balance on the stone statue. He had a note in his beak, and he was staring at Harry. He already knew what it said, Sir Luckless was Ron and Hermione’s owl. Harry opened the note.
“So, what are you going to do once your mum gets settled? Go back to Italy?” Harry didn’t know why he was asking all of these questions, probably just to fill the silence. It must have been because of that, there was no other reason for it.
“It’s, er, it’s a lot of paperwork, for starters,” he replied, trying to be elusive and casual at the same time. It was a weird situation, seeing Ginny for the first time in some time and not having a moment to themselves. Fortunately, George picked up on that and gave Isabel a meaningful look before they slipped away from the conversation and towards the living room.
The man shot a long look at Harry, an apathetic look, the look of someone who has given up. He measured Harry’s face with his eyes, and slowly turned around. His steps were muffled by the hallway rug, and the only sound heard was the front door’s lock, clicking when opened, too cheerful for the event. Harry’s heart was racing, he took one reflexive step forward, towards the man’s back. His arm was twitching in what was a battle between his heart and his brain to reach out. The hinges of the door squeaked most gently when Malfoy opened the door. The evening sun was shining low, making his shadow long, extending over Harry, who was now fighting his innermost instinct to never put himself at any risk again, physical or emotional. If he had a little more time…
“Brilliant, you’re my last patient of this twenty-hour shift, so if you wouldn’t mind fucking off so I can go home and get some sleep, that’d be great.” Malfoy ran his hand over his dishevelled hair and Harry followed the movement with his eyes. “Anyway, when did you start caring how I am, I thought you hated me, showing up here to torment me, although I fail to see how you’ve been attempting to succeed.”
, like Lucius was some kind of an artefact that would be displayed in a museum. Based on his expression, Draco was thinking along the same lines.
Malfoy gave a detailed description of the witch the man had spoken with, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder whether Malfoy was currently making as many observations about him, too. Did
Now Malfoy suddenly went silent. The git shuffled his feet and looked back at the flowerpot in front of him. Harry was this close to losing it. Again he was in a situation with Malfoy where he knew there was something he wasn’t sharing, and Harry felt like a bloody rookie detective trying to fish out information.
“Oh, not at all. Don’t worry,” Isabel let out another amicable laugh, she was way better at small talk than Harry was, bollocks. He had always disliked it when people knew him from all of the things he’d done because he simply didn’t have a choice in the matter, like surviving Voldemort’s killing curse as a baby, winning the Triwizard Tournament, or killing Voldemort. All of these things more or less just happened to fall on him and then he had to deal with them in order to stay alive. And every time the
“I know,” Harry echoed but didn’t know how to continue, were they on speaking terms now? Had they ever been, or was this new territory? He did know that Malfoy had always been intense about his parents, or perhaps everyone was this way about their own parents. Harry was pretty intense about the people he considered family, so supposedly it made sense. They were quiet for a couple more minutes.
He had been lying in his bed, waiting to fall asleep for hours after Malfoy had gone. His thoughts were out of his control, and tormented him way past midnight. Why was Malfoy acting like this? He had admitted to having feelings for Harry, but when Harry had finally, after too many attempts, made his move, he hadn’t gotten a reaction back, not a thing. He thought that maybe, just maybe, the man would kiss him back with the ferocity Harry knew he had, or, push him away and throw a curse at him, but he did neither. Harry wasn’t sure if he would rather live with knowing that he hadn’t tried anything, but if he had, then maybe Malfoy would have felt the same way. Now he was stuck knowing that he had tried it all, but it still hadn’t been enough.
“I suppose I am,” Malfoy replied, and then it was very quiet again. Harry dared to look at him. His silvery eyes looked gentle, his face not quite as pointy as it usually was, and his hair was in an organized chaos that made him look very stunningly dishevelled. In fact, he looked really quite lovely, quite kissable, in Harry’s opinion. “Er… do you want to come in? I mean, I can make us some tea, if you’d like.” Suddenly Harry’s heart was hammering in his chest, it was like he was in a crossroads of unknown options.
“Hi Harry, everything’s okay,” Hermione shook her head quickly, giving him a reassuring smile, “sorry if I scared you,” she got up from the chair and went over to give Harry a brief hug, “the fact that you immediately think something’s wrong tells me that we do this all too rarely.”
Now he was standing in Kingsley’s office. It was organized as always, and Harry wondered once again how that was possible, while his own office reminded him constantly of the aftermath of an Obscurus. This was not the time to ask for tidying up tips, however, Harry wanted to be reassigned back to the case.
Madam Horntail was both surprised and pleased at the fact that the Head Auror had personally come to investigate the store’s break-in. Harry had to reveal that when he was younger he would visit the store frequently since he was a big fan of Quidditch, and somehow ended up striking a conversation with Aradia about the intricacies of the sport. She had some interesting insights to offer, and even introduced a new book that had just arrived in the store:
Harry gathered himself. “Malfoy,” he announced, and faced the stare of his grey eyes. Harry didn’t fancy asking him where he had been all these years, frankly he just wanted Malfoy out of his office and out of this life as swiftly as possible.
The man was still holding Harry’s face in his hands, only a few centimetres away from his own, water from his hair dripping on Harry’s face. “Listen you dickhead,” Malfoy hissed, but his voice wasn’t scathing, it had… vulnerability Harry had only rarely heard, and staring into his eyes felt almost too personal now, “I don’t know what’s going on either, but I know I couldn’t leave without seeing you, so if I’m making a mistake don’t tell me now,” Malfoy’s voice was low and rough, and as Harry nodded, he kissed him again with such raw feeling that Harry swore he couldn’t be held accountable for anything that was about to happen. He kissed Malfoy back as intensely as he could and wrapped his arms around the man’s neck. Now Draco’s hands were traveling to pull at his waist from under his bathrobe. His hands were cold.
Harry closed his eyes to gather up the last bits of his strength for the conversation – he turned at his heel to face Lucius, who now turned his disgusted face at Harry. Harry lifted his chin, and seized the man’s eyes with his own, before saying, “You’re a grown man, Lucius. It’s a school house. Get over it.”
The next morning Harry found himself looking at Malfoy differently, a little less like a puzzle. The previous night he had learnt something about him, something personal, and Harry felt closer to him for it. He noticed he was giving the man soft looks, and a few extra kisses on his cheek. There was not a chance Malfoy didn't notice the change in his manner, but he didn’t voice a complaint. The morning was cloudy but warm, and they decided to go out to fly again. Harry had almost forgotten about his distress of leaving, but just when he had blissfully sat down to have breakfast with Draco, he looked at him, and realized that their days together were numbered. He wanted to forget about it again, and he hoped flying would do that.
court!?” Harry insisted. He’d much rather just wait at home for the demanding knock on his door, although he realized that soon it wouldn’t be a possibility anymore. It was four days until Malfoy’s departure, which meant that Harry would really have to get his shit together.
Harry heard himself say yes. That day, after brunch, they Apparated onto the other side of the mountain, an uninhabited region due of its dangerous cliffs. Not even mountain climbers were ever encountered there. But it was gorgeous: the green forest right at the base of the rock, turning into endless sunflower and crop fields. The sea could be seen, glistening between the mountain peaks, and the trees growing sparser and sparser the further up you went.
The corner of Draco’s mouth turned upwards. “No, you deserve to be wooed,” he said, and Harry’s jaw dropped from sheer surprise of it all, “early dinner, next week Saturday, dress to impress.” Draco lifted Harry’s hand to his lips and kissed it while looking into his eyes. It was too much, it was all too much. “I bid you good night.” Draco leaned in to kiss Harry on the cheek, before turning and showing himself out. A faint crack of the Disapparition could be heard from the other side of the closed door.
“Oh mate, I know she does this every year, just don’t feel too obligated to show up, y’know? Family dinners can be…” Ron grimaced and shuddered. He had always been a bit annoyed at Molly’s attempts at bringing the whole family together as much as she could, and Harry could understand Ron’s willingness to be on his own for once, but Harry had been on his own for long enough, and was honoured to always be invited to the Weasley family functions. He went as often as he could, it’s not like he had anything else to do. He should really get a hobby, or a significant other, or something.
Harry was embarrassed to answer. “No, er, I stepped on it funny on my way down the stairs a few days ago.”
“Be that as it may, my point stands,” Malfoy straightened his posture and faced Harry’s stare. His face was somewhere in between scowling and daring, the lighting coming from the streetlights not doing his looks much favours.
“Just checking something,” Harry smiled at her quickly as he accepted the box, and carefully opened it. The ring resting on the black velvet pillow was silver, with snakes carved on the sides, and the Malfoy family crest presented in the middle. It was completely different from the gold and green ring that they had found, Harry let out an internal sigh of relief. He handed the box back to Narcissa, “Thank you for showing me this, now I best be on my way.”
“It’s quite alright,” Malfoy said, smiling politely, “she’s rather impressive.” Harry’s stomach didn’t seem to calm itself down, and he found himself wondering once again if Draco would ever want kids himself. They hadn’t talked about it yet, hell, they’d only been together for a week, but Harry couldn’t shake it out of his mind. He thought that Draco would make a good dad, a million times better than Lucius ever was to him.
“Funny enough, I find it more effective than any sunblock spell, better water resistance,” Malfoy shrugged nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t just fundamentally altered his image in Harry’s eyes, “here, let me,” he said and grabbed the bottle back, popping the lid open and squeezing some of the white lotion in his hand. He then proceeded to spread it on Harry’s neck and shoulders, it was cold. Malfoy continued onto his back, his movements gentle and pleasant, Harry wished he’d never stop. The man’s hand very discreetly visited to fondle the upper part of Harry’s ass, before returning to rub the lotion on his sides. “Just making sure I’m getting it everywhere,” he smirked when Harry jerked his head to look at him in surprise, a bit flustered.
“That’s it, I’m going in,” Ron huffed, set down his glass and strode over to wrap his arm around Hermione’s waist. Draco’s smile shifted from genuine to more on the polite side, but eyed the pair of them more solemnly than he probably ever had. But when Draco turned his gaze towards Harry, gentle and open, Harry’s heart skipped several beats. That could be them, in no time at all, living in a house together, domestic like Ron and Hermione were.
“I can’t do that,” he protested, mouth full of chocolate dough. How the fuck was he supposed to address Malfoy with something like this? The git didn’t react well to most things, how would he reply if Harry just blurted out something like this?
Harry dropped his arms to his sides again. Now Malfoy looked at Harry up and down evaluatively, like he was assessing a clown costume – put off and amused at the same time. “To be honest… after our last chat I thought I’d never have to see your annoying mug again,” his voice wasn’t harsh, it was… teasing. Harry didn’t know how to deal with that. Thinking about the night Malfoy had showed up to his door made his heart race again, it was like he had tried to tell Harry something, and now he thought that he never wanted to see him again? There was something Harry was missing, or rather, suppressing.
, just Draco. He was still in the transition stage, and even now, sometimes found himself thinking of Draco as Malfoy, especially when he was being a wanker, which was quite often. But he was
There was only one thing Harry could profess, and now it was gushing out of him: “I wish I’d seen you sooner, I wish I’d loved you sooner, maybe I could’ve made some things better.” Maybe he could’ve saved Malfoy from the Death Eaters, from his family. Even Harry knew how impossible that sounded, but he just wished he could’ve made some things better for Draco.
Now the man snorted. “Well yes, that was pretty obvious when you were sucking my cock just now,” Draco scoffed, but didn’t look at Harry. Instead, he kept his eyes in the doorway, an implication Harry was not enjoying. He was quiet for a while, just measuring Malfoy’s face with his eyes, until the blond man turned to face his stare “What is it, Potter?” he spewed sharply. There was something behind his eyes that Harry couldn't make out.
Draco sighed inscrutably. “I always imagined myself having kids, no reason for that to change. I just always imagined having them with some pure-blood dark-haired hottie.” Harry didn’t know if Draco was telling the truth or taking the piss, but nonetheless he felt a weight lifted from his chest, and he cracked a relieved smile.
Harry was trying to wrack his brain figuring out what Dumbledore would have said in a situation like this, he always managed to be so calm, infuriatingly so. “Ah, of course. How very gracious of you, to look after you mother so… keenly,” Harry knew there was a flash of challenge in his eyes.
Malfoy pursed his lips. “It’s when you landed that thing, hopped off it like it was nothing, I thought, what a bloody arrogant bastard he is, and that’s when I knew,” he shook his head and gave a bashful look in Harry’s direction. Harry found it incredibly absurd, but also very Malfoy, to start fancying someone the second he realized how much he hated them. Harry part wished he had felt the same way back then, maybe they could have found each other sooner, though it wouldn’t have been likely. There was still so much between them now, and it had been even more back then. It would have been impossible for them to ignore all that just to fool around. It was better this way.
“Dunno, I guess it’s just… Rosie’s great y’know? But… It was just so much work when she was born you have no idea, I don’t think either me or Hermione slept more than three hours at a time for the first year. And now there’s going to be another, I just keep thinking, how’s Rose going to adjust to another person in the family? And how are me and Hermione going to do this again, it’s mental innit! I know I’m being stupid, it’s just something that keeps me up at night,” Ron let out a long sigh and took several gulps from his beer.
, Merlin, you’re such an insufferable little twat,” Malfoy spat out, and for a moment, looked like he was going to stand up to leave, his limbs twisting as if he couldn't decide whether to stay or go. Harry hoped he wouldn't go. Eventually, the man relaxed a bit, staying seated. Harry’s stare was drilling into the side of his face.
The late morning sun was shining on the white sheets. Malfoy was lying on his back on the bed, one leg sprawled to the side, and the other on Harry’s shoulder. Harry was sitting up, fingering Malfoy sloppily. Draco had carefully guided him on what to do and Harry was gently following his directions. Now he was steadily rubbing Malfoy’s prostate, the man under him slowly stroking his dark red cock. Despite his fingers starting to ache, Harry didn’t pick up the pace, but kept it painfully steady.
When Harry was sure his delight at the situation couldn’t be heard from his voice, he asked, “So, what’s the problem then?” Surely the twat wasn’t here to tell him off because Harry was nice to his mother. Though again, in Malfoy’s eyes Harry could do no right.
Short of two hours later Evergrey returned with two pieces of parchment. Meanwhile, Harry had just sorted the piles and stowed them in his desk or put them away in the bookcase. A surprisingly large amount of it had just been junk, and Harry was relieved to see his office again from under all the rubbish.
Patrick and Harry had been at it for hours, and Ridgenorth was not cracking. Instead, the bastard had been taunting them with sarcastic quips, and giving them the silent treatment. He was sitting in the hard metal chair, his previously neat garments changed into the jail robes with the Ministry logo on their back. His dark silvery hair was greasy and partially covered his face, but he seemed as cheerful as ever. Perhaps because he knew he was making this unnecessarily hard for the two Aurors.
Harry grinned, but feigned defeat. “Oh, you’ve persuaded me with your cunning ways, hop on,” he said, and turned his back to Rosie, who climbed aboard expertly.
After dinner, they quickly Apparated back to Malfoy’s place, because the man had been resting his hand on Harry’s thigh the way one does when they’re ready to go somewhere private and shag each other’s brains out. So, that’s what they did, Harry on top this time. It was brilliant. Malfoy on his back, so beautiful with his golden hair spread out onto the pillow and his chest red from breathing so rough; his red cock resting on his white tan line, pulsating as Harry kept a steady rhythm with his hips, holding Malfoy’s other leg up with his arm, kissing his shin sloppily. The dark, hot night was filled only with their occasional moans and heavy breathing. Harry never wanted to stop shagging Malfoy, it was different every time, always so fucking fantastic.
“It was mad I know,” Malfoy snorted and nodded, “I guess I wanted your attention, or to show myself that you weren’t special.”
Harry stopped at the top of the stairs, looking at Malfoy, or more accurately, the back of his head. “So you fancy me then?” Harry voiced hesitantly, he couldn’t believe the situation, the words that were coming out of his mouth, he had to squeeze the railing to stop his hand from shaking. Now Malfoy jerked his head up to look back at him, he had stopped in his tracks to stand midway down the stairs, and despite not seeing anything in the dark, Harry could almost hear him scowling.
Later, in the evening, when the sun was slowly setting behind his window, his door suddenly opened and Hermione stepped in with Ron right behind her, hand in hand with Rosie. Harry gave them a wide smile and attempted to sit somewhat more upright in the bed. For a second, he remembered all those times when Ron and Hermione had visited him in the hospital wing in Hogwarts, and felt a little silly that more than ten years later the situation was pretty much unchanged. Except now there was little Rosie, all smiles as always, being lifted on to Harry’s bed. She gave him a shy peck on the cheek, and then sat down, wiggling her legs over the railing. Harry loved her very much.
“America?” Harry blurted out in a surprised voice, “What are you doing with them?” As soon as he said it, he felt that it might have been a stupid question to ask. Obviously the British Ministry of Magic cooperated closely with the American Magical Congress.
Harry took a deep breath, steadying himself, and tried the front door with his free gloved hand. It was locked, nothing that a little Alohomora couldn’t fix. Harry felt stupid being anxious, after all, he had been through a million situations worse than this, he was just grabbing a suspect, he wasn’t even doing it alone for fuck’s sake.
“Are you sure you’re not going to take the teaching job?” he asked Malfoy. Last time they’d talked about it he had seemed pretty adamant that he would never do such a thing. Harry wondered if he’d changed his mind, Harry was almost amused imagining Malfoy and Neville sitting side by side in a teachers’ meeting at Hogwarts, but only almost – he was a little bit too terrified by the situation still to derive much pleasure from the images he was now getting.
“Take Blackburn and Rivers to interview all these muggles. Make sure to Obliviate them afterward, don’t want what happened in Leadenhall to happen again, do we?” Potter crossed the distance of the sticky floor to the Auror who was carelessly lugging the stunned suspect in their arm. “McGallon, Buckthorn, take the names of the possible wizarding folk in this establishment and ask for them to come in tomorrow, I’ll interview them personally. Twigs and Crooker, you grab the suspect and we will return to the Ministry directly.”
have to wear these horrible itchy robes?” Noah crossed his arms in protest and raised his eyebrows in such an infuriating manner that it was only possible he had copied it from Draco himself – the unofficial king of pulling infuriating looks.
Malfoy had an amused look on his face that Harry didn’t care for. “Right,” the corner of his mouth turned upwards, “I guess everything can’t always go the way you want it, not even for the Chosen One.”
Malfoy let out a deep sigh, he looked disappointed to say the least. “You just keep toying with me, aren’t you?” he said like he was talking to a pet, it was far too casual for a sentence clearly carrying heavy implications.
After dinner Harry had flopped down to slouch in an armchair, lazily sipping on some sugary tea, trying to deal with the food coma he was about to slip into. Hermione was sitting in the other armchair propped up next to his, but neither of them had the strength to speak more than a few words at a time.
“Come on, princess!” he hollered after Malfoy, who followed them downstairs, rolling his eyes while doing so.
“Back so soon?” Malfoy lifted his thin eyebrow and eyed Harry from behind his clipboard, clearly holding back laughter. His green robes were as immaculate as they had ever been, and in the hospital light, his eyes had a dash of green in them as well. “I didn’t know my healing skills left such an indelible impression. Or maybe you’re just an idiot for drinking any sodding liquid handed to you… now that I think about it, that must be the case.”
He walked over to the bed, and sat on its side, gently shaking her shoulder to wake her. “Wakey, wakey, Rosie, sweetheart,” Harry mused quietly, “your mum says dinner’s ready.”
“An understatement if I’ve ever heard one,” Harry commented, and first felt amused, but judging by Malfoy’s face he was drifting towards a conversation he really didn’t care to have.
Luckily, Malfoy intercepted whatever gibberish Harry would have started to spout: “It’s still new, I think we’re just working some stuff out.” Harry looked at Draco as he spoke, admiring his cool temper, and how good he looked in a black V-necked tee. When he realized his Malfoy had stopped talking, he nodded, eager to change the subject. Ron looked at them both very sternly, like he was trying to scout a lie somewhere, before nodding slowly and slouching back in his chair, turning his attention back to the pastry, not seeming like he was going to say anything more. Harry let out a quiet sigh of relief.
Now Evergrey grabbed the chair recently abandoned and moved it closer to Harry’s bed. “How are you feeling?” The man sat down, looking a little tired, he was eyeing Harry up and down anxiously. Harry felt horrible for putting Patrick through what had just happened, he was under enough stress as it was.
Now Malfoy’s face turned into a scowl. “She is not. If you’re here to arrest her again, you’ll have to come back later,” his voice dripped with contempt, and Harry was taken aback by his hostility. For some reason, he didn’t want Malfoy to despise him anymore; before he hadn’t cared about what the git thought of him, because he knew for certain that Malfoy loathed him, but now that he wasn’t sure anymore, he really didn’t want Malfoy to hate him. Harry had to jump in quickly to divert Malfoy from cursing him on the spot.
“How is madam Ackerman these days?” Harry inquired as they were strolling down the corridor towards the elevators. Lunch hour at the Ministry was always quiet, and they didn't pass anyone in the hallway.
and quickly stumbled into the guest room. After closing the door behind him, he wanted to bang his head against it. This had happened too many times already. He knew that only when one of them made it painfully clear that something was happening, was it going to happen.
“Come on, it was only from the first floor, it wasn’t that bad,” Harry tried to sound nonchalant and waved his hand in the air to get the message across that he didn’t mind being tossed around once in a while. He wasn’t quite sure why he was trying to impress Malfoy, but he had a feeling that he was under a lot of painkiller potions at the moment.
“If you must,” Malfoy scowled and strode over to Harry, sitting in the garden chair next to his. The man extended his arm to present the faded, smudged symbol to Harry. It contrasted his porcelain skin. The magical ink wasn’t alive anymore, it was more of a memory of what it had once been. Harry wanted to touch it, to feel Malfoy’s pulse, see if it was as fast as his. “Satisfied?” the bloke said coldly and pulled his arm back, breaking Harry’s trance.
Harry was worked up. Too agitated to sleep, too nervous to do anything about it. After him and Malfoy had returned to the house, the awkwardness that had briefly been broken at the fountain had made a grand return. When Malfoy had kissed him, Harry had been sure they’d spend the night together; the desperation of his touch was evident, he had missed Harry, too. But alas, once they were standing in front of the guest room, at the foot of the stairs leading to Malfoy’s bedroom, neither of them had known what to say or do.
Harry rolled his eyes, frustrated, “No, I don’t know– look, I really don’t want to discuss it,” even if he felt like he could tell Ron anything, didn’t mean he wanted to. He and Ron had never really discussed girls all that much, probably because Harry was had been dating Ron’s
Harry frowned. “What do you mean? I still have all my limbs attached, don’t I?” he squeezed the man’s hand reassuringly, and wanted to wrap him in a huge embrace, but thought that the conversation was more important than any urge he was experiencing.
“Oh, honey I thought I heard your voice!” Molly spun Ginny around before letting her back on the ground, “Here, let me take that love,” she took Ginny’s cloak from her hands to put away, “oh and when you two are done chatting could you help me set the table dear,” Molly directed her question at Ginny, who nodded quickly. She had turned a shade of red from her mother’s eager welcome.
Turned out that Hermione had something else planned entirely. “I thought we could go out for lunch together, just you and me, is that okay?” She asked, and looked at Harry very innocently.
“I heard you’re making progress with our case,” Malfoy said and leaned back in his chair. “Personally, I can’t stand thieves. Such a stupid little crime, just goes off to show bad upbringing,” he wrinkled his long nose in distaste.
Draco didn’t respond, but for the first time it seemed to be because he wasn’t able to. His silvery eyes were wide and glistening as he stared back at Harry, his mouth opening and closing, before he apparently decided there was nothing to be said.
and instead tried to come up with a believable excuse. There was really no reason for him to show up at Malfoy’s door, except for the obvious one. Harry scratched his neck awkwardly, “Yes, well, er, I helped catch the main suspect in the case, and in the process Evergrey got sent to St Mungo’s and he’s taking some time off, so I thought I’d… er…”
“Hey mate, how’s it going?” Ron turned to Harry and gave him a slap on the back, almost a little too hard, for Harry had to cover up his surprise by fake coughing.
“Bollocks, look at the time, I have to be on my way,” he said hastily, almost jumping up from his chair, but what seemed to be a poor attempt at slipping away. Harry went along with it, he had lost his appetite for the whole affair.
“It wasn’t easy for the normal people, either,” the wanker said after a pause. He had gone back to sulking and being generally moody, while not looking at Harry anymore. At this point Harry assumed that a scowl was just Malfoy’s resting face.
“You know very well what I mean,” Malfoy huffed, and was now looking at Harry defiantly, like he was ready to duel him over… what? On who would be able to dodge more questions until the other had to come out with it. Harry’s heart started beating faster, he felt the moment approaching, there was something there, in the air between them.
He squeezed his wand firmly and got up from his bed swiftly but quietly. A shiver rose from his back to his neck, and Harry picked up a bathrobe to cover his shirtless body, but didn’t bother to tie it close. He creeped into the hallway and tried to descend the stairs as nimbly as possible. His wand was still casting Lumos. Who on earth could it be? It was four in the morning for Merlin’s sakes. Was it Hermione? Had something happened? No, she would just Floo in. Maybe it was Kingsley with something urgent, but what could be
Harry nodded and headed for the stairs obediently, walking up the steps, Draco stalking up behind him. Harry navigated to the second door on the right side of the corridor; it was ajar, and Harry peered inside. The evening sun was painting the room in tones of gold and orange, and Harry identified Rosie as the lump in her small bed, curly hair fanned over the pillow.
He sent a message for someone in the Ministry to come fetch the brooms and check them for dark magic before returning them to madam Horntail. In the meanwhile, he returned to the clerk, who was just recovering from the Confundus Charm. He asked for the name of the person renting the particular unit, and the still perplexed man drew out a large blue binder from the shelf behind him, handing it to Harry. He raised his wand to flip to the right page, ignoring the clerk’s flabbergasted gaze, and searched for the name of the thief. For that particular time there was no signature, so the most probable scenario was that the person had just Apparated into the warehouse in search for an empty unit to dump the brooms in before selling them onwards. Harry floated the binder back to its place, and when the Ministry official finally arrived to pick up the brooms, Harry had already neatly Obliviated the clerk.
“Or rather… it’s weird, but not in a bad way,” Harry tried again. But it was true – it felt nice, sitting here with Malfoy, having a cup of tea. He didn’t want to run away, and he didn’t want to hex Malfoy into oblivion. To tell the truth, he didn’t want the night to end.
in front of them. Now she returned her attention to Harry and Draco sitting across from her, “it’s not an exchange system, we’re helping because it’s the right thing to do.” Funnily enough, it was exactly what Harry had told Draco she would say. He gave a meaningful look at Malfoy, who returned the gaze knowingly, like saying
Harry tried to shake these thoughts out of his mind as he was shaving in front of his bathroom mirror. As previously mentioned, he was not very handy with household magic: that included personal hygiene spells, like shaving. He had learnt it one way, the muggle way, and didn’t want to try a shaving spell in the fear of accidentally vanishing his nose or something. Now he was trying to shave as closely as possible, and then turned to the disaster that was his hair. Those spells he was familiar with, since his hair had always been such a pain, and now he combed it and styled it back neatly. Maybe he had overdone his grooming a tad, but if Malfoy had the tendency to always cross his way, at least he would have one thing less to be arrogant about. Realistically though, Harry could never avoid Malfoy’s disdain.
“Are you even hearing yourself?” Harry was essentially shouting now, trying to form words so quickly he would be able to shower Kingsley with a lecture of a lifetime, Harry tried to frantically come up with a way to change his mind, “It’s not a ‘win-win’, you’re murdering a bunch of people for political gain, that’s what’s happening here,” he tried to make Kingsley realize the reality of what he was about to do, “I don’t even recognize you anymore.”
The git sucked on his cheek while looking into the garden, but eventually nodded, “Yes, I suppose we can,” he uttered and got up, leaving his untouched teacup behind. Harry mimicked the motion, but rose from his chair a bit too eagerly and hit his thigh on the table. Why was he so worked up? His heart was still beating fast and he fumbled with his words. Harry tried to suppress a swear to stop Malfoy from noticing his little collision, which was definitely going to leave a bruise.
Harry thought about reaching out to Malfoy. How would he react? Would he storm away, or would he push him against the wall fiercely? How Harry hoped for the latter. He wanted to kiss Malfoy. More than ever before. The dark wrapped the two of them in a silent curtain of intimacy, a moment where anything could happen, if one would only gather their courage. And Harry was gathering his courage to follow his new urge. At any moment now, he would take the step needed to reach the man, to gently kiss his tan neck, to feel his warmth, to feel his hot breath in his ear. Harry wanted to let himself go, for the first time in a very long time. He felt that Draco’s severity could bring something alive in him, something raw, something personal. It was just a matter of one move, one touch, to make it all happen.
Harry straightened himself and gave a look at all the people who were there because of him. Evergrey gave him an encouraging nod. “Right,” Harry started, “thank you for being here today, and for agreeing to listen to what I have to say.” He had rehearsed his speech a thousand times in his head, but was still afraid of making a mess of it.
“Oh yes, they had a guest bedroom too, but this was an extra room for Dudley’s toys,” Harry nodded eagerly, he knew he had Malfoy hooked now. For once, Harry enjoyed having the man’s undivided attention, do anything he liked with it, say anything and he would earn his recognition.
Since it was their last evening together, Malfoy had told Harry that he’d take him to a very posh restaurant, and shag his brains out the whole night after. For a second, it seemed that they would skip the restaurant altogether, when Malfoy saw Harry in slacks and a button down for the first time.
Yet, Malfoy did help in getting Harry to the hospital. Though he himself said that it was only because Harry had looked so bad.
Harry’s adversary, his mortal enemy, his opponent. Except lately he hadn’t felt so much a rival as a… what? The target of Harry’s projected longing.
Around 9 am, when Harry had been trying to get some paperwork done while waiting for the results from evidence, Buckthorn entered his office. Harry was just finishing the arrest report for Narcissa, and now signed it quickly before standing up to talk to the man. Isaac Buckthorn was a little younger than Harry. From what he had heard, Isaac had been Head Boy at Hogwarts, and applied to Auror training as soon as he graduated. To Harry he had always been a good colleague, and later, a good team member.
about it… not like I already made up my mind.” Now he made a valiant attempt at freeing his arm from under Harry, only succeeding when Harry lifted himself off the appendage.
In return, and in part to change the subject, Harry inquired about the day-to-day of running a potions shop, and Malfoy told him about his continuing research on what he should stock, reading books about rare potions, making the orders, working with the customers. It wasn’t ‘rocket science’, as uncle Vernon always put it, but Harry could’ve listened Draco talk about different species of magical fungi for hours. Maybe it was just him, but he couldn’t shake the thought that Draco would make an excellent Potions Master. He knew better than to bring it up again, though.
Maybe he should just see himself straight into the Janus Thickey ward, claim an acute mental disturbance.
Kingsley took another deep breath before standing up and walking from behind his desk to talk to Harry. He motioned for him to sit down in one of his maroon armchairs. “Harry, you’re asking for permission to brew Veritaserum, you know that’s been illegal for a decade.” Again Harry reminisced the time thirteen years ago when Snape had threatened to spike his pumpkin juice with the stuff if he went through Snape’s private potions cabinet again, only to later find out that the real culprit was Barty Crouch Jr Polyjuiced as Moody. How times had been more lenient then. Alas, rules were established for a reason.
“Congratulations again on the baby, Hermione,” Ginny said and turned to look at her, “to tell you the truth, I’m a bit jealous that you have a helper in there to digest all of this food right now.”
Now, however, Harry sat on the nearest chair in the hallway, clutching the letter. With shaky hands, he ripped open the envelope and pulled out the piece of parchment folded two times.
Patrick half snorted, half sighed. “Thanks mate, but I dunno… I like being in charge, but it was a hell of a battle getting everyone released from their current cases to do this arrest with me,” Patrick huffed. Harry could imagine the paperwork, the pleading, it’s not that the heads of other cases wouldn’t want to help, but sometimes they were just swamped, and there was nothing to be done about it. It was a feat in itself that Patrick had managed to get so many good Aurors together.
Harry snorted lightly and nodded, “Clear.” Probably not a good idea to clarify that he hadn’t ‘jumped through a window’, at least willingly, and although everyone seemed to think so, Harry was not planning on getting hurled out of a building in the near future. Nasty business, that.
“Yes, to tell you the truth I forgot about it until now,” Harry admitted, and sipped from his cup cordially, only to understand the look on Malfoy’s face when he had tasted Harry’s sorry excuse for tea: the liquid he was now enjoying was creamy and full, the flavours of milk and what he assumed to be very fancy tea mixed together wonderfully. However, Harry had to put the cup down for what he was about to say next, he feared the shaking of his hands would reveal his nervousness. “You said I made him happy,” was the only thing he said. Harry couldn’t bring himself to ask if it was true, or to inquire further, he just needed confirmation that he wasn’t making connections that weren’t there.
Evergrey shrugged and handed Harry the notebook. He thumbed the black leather, and thoroughly browsed it through. He paid special attention to the names of distributors, but there was no Narcissa Malfoy there, nor anyone else with a name starting with M. He didn’t know whether to feel relieved, or to suspect Narcissa to be the mastermind of the whole operation, she certainly had the brains for it, but she didn’t have the motive. When Harry reached the last page, he saw something sticking out of the inner cover. Harry pulled out a piece of parchment, on it there were scribbles that looked like strange symbols, arranged in neat lines. “Did you see this?” He asked and showed Patrick the drawings.
Walking out of the church into the warm night air, and once again heading towards the beach, Malfoy asked, “So, do you like being Head Auror?” His tone managed to be incredibly nonchalant while revealing his curiousness, though he kept walking forwards, not staring at Harry. They walked under an archway along what Harry had become to know was one of the main streets.
Harry just nodded in reply, he didn’t know much about the intricacies of Hermione’s work, so he thought best not to go deeper into it, besides, if she wanted to talk about it more, she would have. “Right,” Harry replied simply, “and how are you?”
She grinned very non-apologetically, clearly aware of the conversation she had now instigated, “can of worms and all, sorry about that.”
The man’s wand flew through the cold air and hit the pavement a few feet away, as Harry and his backup of Aurors emerged from the shadows all simultaneously. Just as Harry cast the Anti-Disapparition Jinx, the man had managed to slip away with a bang, leaving behind a splinched pinky finger with a ring on it. Now the eight Aurors surrounded the other hooded person, who now lifted their hands up in surrender. “You’re surrounded,” Harry voiced blatantly, “reveal yourself, and don’t even consider doing anything rash.”
Ron grinned back, and then pulled a face to annoy Harry. “But not that way, right? Because you know I love you too but I got a good thing going with Hermione here and I–“
“I suppose that’s fair,” Malfoy shrugged, “and I hate to say it but you did grow up to be a brilliant wizard, a fucking excellent flyer too, by Salazar was I pissed at that,” he smiled to himself while giving Harry a look from the corner of his eye. Was he thinking back to when he’d stolen Neville’s Remembrall and Harry’d followed after him, almost knocking him off his broom? Or when he’d kick his arse in Quidditch in their second year?
Harry reached the small platform that folded the stairs in the other direction, and he almost had a heart attack when he saw a dark figure nearly bump into him. Harry gasped silently, he was too agitated to not be startled by anything unexpected. In the scarce light of the night, Harry saw Malfoy’s hair glow a bit in the dark. For a second, Harry was ashamed that he’d gotten caught trying to sneak into Malfoy’s bed, that is, until the man spoke.
“Your boss…” Harry started hesitantly, walking along the wall, looking at the numerous jars, boxes, baskets, and petri dishes filled with the oddest sorts of potion ingredients, “how long have you worked here?” he inquired. Had Malfoy hired him as an employee, or was he just part of the shop?
There was a silence where Malfoy was glaring at Harry, but evidently decided to drop the matter. “I don’t
Harry had vowed to himself to do something romantic for once, before the night was over, and if this wasn’t a sign from Merlin himself to do it and do it now, he didn’t know what it was. So, Harry cast Nox, and took a few steps towards the fountain, stepping into the water, both feet getting soaked immediately. He turned to Malfoy, who was now holding on to the only light that they had, and he was giving Harry an incredulous look. “What on Merlin’s green earth are you doing, Potter?” he said, voice hesitant. There was no way he didn't know exactly what Harry was doing.
“Love potions? How vile,” Malfoy said, shaking his head, just as they arrived to the bottom of some stairs headed upwards, “what on earth for?” As they emerged from behind a large pine tree, the view from the steps was to the sea. There was still a blue shine on the horizon, and the surface of the cove was completely smooth. Harry wondered if one could ever be tired of seeing this view.
Harry offered his standard response, although he was quite sure it wasn’t going to fly with his childhood friend. “Me? Yeah, I’m fine,” he said, trying to sound nonchalant. He didn't want to burden anyone with his problems, Hermione probably had ones of her own.
Hermione saved Harry from blushing too much, saying, “The chicken casserole will be ready in a minute,” she gave Draco a meaningful look, “Harry’s favourite,” she added, and Draco’s eyes shot to look at him again, amused, this time. “Ron, would you please set the table?” Hermione asked, pinching his side and detaching herself from his half-embrace as he flinched away from her finger and thumb. “Would you boys get Rosie? I think she’s still napping in her room.”
at least put out an offer. It was an old rectangular stone building, symmetrical on both sides, with rows of windows on either side of the large entrance doors. The house had two stories, and a sun deck in the back, with four bedrooms, a study, a large kitchen, a living room, a sunny breakfast slash sitting room, a dining room, a large foyer, three bathrooms, the list went on.
“Clearly you mean the lovely weather,” Harry chuckled stiffly, inferring to the rain that had taken over London the past few days, and had been prevalent nearly the whole springtime. He tried to divert his attention, in case he had misunderstood Malfoy’s implication.
“We just got notified that someone has seen Dargan on the eastern outskirts of muggle London,” Evergrey was panting as if he had been running to tell Harry, he appreciated the devotion, “he has been seen entering a building there where he might be staying at.”
When he reached the first floor, he turned to scout the apartment where Ridgenorth was allegedly staying at. There were two doors on the other end of the corridor, the right hand one ominously ajar. A streak of light flooding into the dim corridor from the room showed the infinite number of dust particles floating in the air. To Harry’s headache, he realized that that was the apartment with the window where Dargan had been seen. The man could be lurking anywhere, waiting to jump Harry, and he raised his wand once again, starting to make his way towards the door as carefully as he could. The streak of light partially illuminating the corridor was so bright, that it made everything else in Harry’s line of vision exceptionally dark.
“Me!?” Draco gasped dramatically, and Harry laughed, “I’ll have you know I mostly wasn’t up to anything, it was you three that I always kept eye on,” Malfoy rolled his eyes, “sneaking around you three, every year the same thing.” Harry snickered at Malfoy’s dramatics, he wasn’t wrong in that they were almost always planning one thing or another. Whether it was finding out what was in the hatch a three-headed dog was guarding, brewing Polyjuice Potion to trick Draco into revealing if he knew who the heir of Slytherin was, or to use a Time-Turner to save Buckbeak and release Sirius, the list went on. Harry would have to tell his stories to Malfoy one by one, he thought. It would be too much to explain everything at once.
“For Merlin’s sakes, Potter, what you’re putting me through,” Kingsley sighed and rubbed his temples, while giving mean looks in Harry’s direction, his blue robes moving from the motion, gold embroidery flickering in the creases, “fine, I suppose I can’t stop you if I wanted to, you’re a right menace anyway,” the man huffed and slouched back into the chair. He picked up his quill reluctantly, and signed the parchment. Then he leaned back and crossed his arms on his chest, giving Harry a very final look.
The git looked like his thoughts paralleled Harry’s. “Potter,” he voiced lifting his chin a little, measuring Harry from head to toe. Harry couldn’t help but notice that Malfoy hadn’t spat out his name in the usual manner, maybe the years had made them both grow up. No, not Malfoy. “Head Auror, I see,” Malfoy continued, scanning the room and looking like he was fighting a scowl, “congratulations,” he said through almost gritted teeth, “though, frankly, considering that you always were an insufferable stickler for the rules I expected nothing less.” He then made a face of almost… embarrassment? No, couldn’t be. Harry was almost glad to see that Malfoy was still exactly the same, that is, until– “Sorry, old habits, you know.”
“Not that it’s any of your business, but yes, quite,” Malfoy replied, he still wasn’t looking at Harry, but was rather eyeing the witches and wizards scattered around the pub. Harry noticed that he wasn’t scowling anymore.
“Do you want to go fly today?” Malfoy asked suddenly. Harry didn't know why it took him by surprise, maybe he hadn’t expected there to be a Quidditch pitch somewhere around here. Was it up in the mountains, away from the muggles? Was it
suffering from an acute mental disturbance with hallucinations, because there was clearly no way that Draco Malfoy had just called him good looking, was there?
“Harry, what a pleasant surprise, what can I do you for?” Kingsley lifted his gaze from his papers to look at Harry huffing in front of him. His manner reminded Harry of Dumbledore, too calm. Harry more or less slammed the permission slip on the desk to face the Minister. “I need your signature… please.”
Harry frowned, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Never in a million years would he have relied on
“How is it a bloody conflict of interest!?” Harry’s voice was shrill, he still didn’t understand, why the fuck would Kingsley want him on desk duty?
get to have it all? Wanker probably already lived in a mansion with that redhead Weasley and their ten kids, all the while acting, or probably truly being, a humble servant of the law who “never asked for any of it”. Potter’s endless obliviousness annoyed Draco beyond compare.
“Well, you know,” he scratched the back of his head and put the menu down, “I don’t know, like, beers at a pub or something of the sort.” He was having a hard time concentrating on talking because he was suddenly very aware of how clearly he could make out Malfoy’s bicep through his jumper. Harry had gotten off work at ten past ten, trying to hurry out of the office as fast as he could, not wanting to keep Malfoy waiting. But it had been a bit hard with Ron on his heel, talking his ear off. Normally Harry wouldn’t have minded, but he had been trying to figure out how to explain to Ron that he was going
“Right,” he said, his voice stuck in his throat. Why was Malfoy interviewing him about his personal life? Was this his way of getting to know Harry? Because it wasn’t the best strategy.
Judging on the look that Kingsley now gave to Harry, he saw right through his little act. “Who would’ve known you’d grow up to be such a schemer.” He was shaking his head to himself.
over the noise of the pub and gave Harry a relaxed wave of his hand. Harry went a bit red, but returned the greeting before paying for the drinks and returning to the table.
They cooked quietly, only the sounds of pots and pans clanging together, and the smell of fresh basil and olive oil in the air. Harry could have eaten a horse by the time the food was ready, that’s how hungry he was. They sat down, and Harry had to hold back to preserve his table manners, not sure how Malfoy usually went about his dining. He didn’t seem to be paying much attention to Harry, and Harry took it as a go-ahead, starting to wolf down his pasta. Almost, at least. It was delicious.
Harry sighed heavily and looked at the piece of parchment in his hand. He then returned to the other side of his desk and sat down to fill out the short form. Harry batted away the self-writing quill and opted for a regular one, he dipped it in the black ink and started scribbling on the paper.
Harry didn’t recognize this Malfoy: he was quieter, more restrained. He wasn’t lazily lounging in the chair, and only restricted his insults towards Harry to the one. His now gold and silver hair was longer but his beard was still closely shaved off, he was wearing the Malfoy family ring in his long finger, along with a few others.
The hallway was completely silent, the only sound coming from the very gentle steps Harry was taking. He could hear his quickened breath and tried to stay as quiet as possible while making sure there was no one lurking in the shadows. Casting Lumos would surely make him known. With every step he was nearing the door, the light calling him in. Harry was approaching the door, and took a deep breath before stepping into the room, senses heightened to hear every sound, feel any draft that was out of place. He pushed the creaking door fully open while holding his wand up and ready to attack.
As for the adults, they were sitting around the kitchen island, having some hot mulled wine and enjoying a nice, quiet conversation that didn’t involve talking about Santa’s wish lists, new broom models, or anything else that had been the hot topic with their kids for the past two months.
“Don’t you worry about a thing,” said the nurse and gave Harry a well-rehearsed smile, “rest now, a Healer will be with you in just a few moments.” And before Harry could ask anything more, the lady turned on her heel and tottered out of the room.
“So, I heard you have a new boyfriend,” he stated quite directly, and hoped that Ginny didn’t take it as an interrogation from a jealous ex, because Harry truly wasn’t trying to win her back.
The streetlights and a bright glow from the shop windows illuminated the crowded street, the sun had long gone. Harry peered above the slow-moving crowd to see the entrance to the Jade Toad, a tad fancier pub located on the corner of a very posh building. The building itself was built from sturdy pale bricks, and many engravings, stone ornaments and statues, embellished it. The windows had numerous panes and they were meticulously clean. The building harboured not only the posh pub, but also one of the more respected upscale fashion shops, Madam Mooney’s.
In a few quick steps Harry was standing in front of Malfoy, who was motionless in where he was standing, looking almost petrified, though his eyes followed Harry’s every move. Harry wasn’t sure how to approach the matter, he had only had a general idea. Now he took one last step into Malfoy’s personal space, feeling his body heat on him, wanting to do everything, to kiss his neck, take off his clothes, push him against the wall. But Harry didn’t do any of that, he didn’t have the courage. Instead, he leaned in, and placed the most gentle kiss on Malfoy’s upper lip. It was soft, and warm, and everything and nothing like Harry had imagined it. He lingered in the kiss for a few seconds too long, before taking a careful step back, head buzzing. Malfoy hadn’t moved, and he wasn’t looking at Harry anymore. Harry felt a hot flush rising on his face, but Malfoy did not seem to have a response. Now his mouth moved, but the voice that came out was so quiet that Harry couldn’t make out the words. It might have been
Harry tried to sit up straight in the bed, but every injured bone in his body reminded him to not go through with such foolish actions. “I’m off the case!?” Harry huffed, slouching back onto the bed, “why the fuck would he do that?” Granted, they hadn’t gotten that far yet, but who would be better to run this case than him? He was the head of the bloody department after all!
It wasn’t long until a waiter returned with two large glasses of red wine, the contents of which would most likely fill any regular glass to the brim, and a bottle of sparkling water, and glasses for each. No later than Harry had tasted the wine, its flavour jumping around in his mouth after the sweetness of their previous drinks, did mister Bianchi arrive with two plates he placed before them. Harry had never seen such pizza before, it was full from the edges, and yellow with cheese from the middle, with only red and green spots here and there, resembling tomatoes and basil leaves, very far from the flat pies they called pizza in England. It was nothing like Harry had tasted, either, the base was crispy, and the flavour of the cheese and the basil filled his mouth with such delight, that Harry almost laughed when he tasted it. His face must have conveyed the expression, because Malfoy gave him a knowing look, and clinked his glass on Harry’s. Now the red wine complemented the flavours wonderfully.
“So, listen, I had a case this week, nothing major, it was for Quality Quidditch Supplies,” he started and Ron turned to him now with intrigue in his eyes. Harry had almost forgotten how much his friend loved to hear about Auror work, he didn’t even have to say anything. “Like I said, nothing major, but when I managed to solve it, the owner was so glad that she sent me this,” Harry fished the gift card out of his pocket, “problem is, I’m not flying anymore, so I thought that you could maybe use this on Rosie, if she really picks up flying, you know…”
He started with the kitchen, dusting everything off, reorganizing his cupboards, and polishing surfaces, maybe he would even cook now that it looked like someone actually lived there. Next he moved on to the living room, where he performed the same procedures, getting the dust off of his carpet and pillows, sweeping the ashes from the fireplace, and overall arranging the havoc that was currently taking place. Lastly, he cleaned his bedroom, changed his sheets and aired out his bedspread and pillow, dusted off the surfaces and opened the windows to let in some fresh air. The book contained a ready-to-use spell for a bathroom, and after a few tries, Harry managed that as well. A satisfying feeling came over him once he realised how much nicer it was to live in a clean house. He was even inspired to wash his windows for the first time in forever. Harry was amazed at how good he felt being away from work.
. Evergrey barely managed to slip through the closing doors into the elevator. They stood in silence, the elevator was empty aside from the interdepartmental memos floating above them.
After some moments, and some moments more, they pulled apart, both out of breath. Harry was in a loss for words, as they were still holding onto each other. “Well, if that didn’t earn us some good fortunes…” he said breathlessly, looking at Malfoy’s face that was still very close to him, his eyes getting used to the dark now. He was already letting go of the man, but without saying anything, he pulled Harry into another kiss, slower, somehow more intimate than the first one. Their lips were gliding together, they were embracing very gently now, Harry couldn’t help noticing how soft Malfoy’s face was after just shaving. He was so very soft.
Harry found himself staring. There must have been somebody who knew that Malfoy was aiming to get into the Academy of Magical Healing, and they hadn’t gone to the papers about it. The whole situation was completely bizarre, Harry thought, as he measured Malfoy’s form with his eyes: he was still tall and lanky, as arsey-looking as always, but his hair was longer, it fell past his sharp cheekbones and curled a little at the ends. His silvery eyes contrasted the lime green robes, and Harry didn’t even have the common sense not to gawk. He couldn’t believe he was having a conversation with Malfoy that hadn't yet side-tracked to them insulting each other.
