Since when did Malfoy know how to drive? And since when did she own a truck?
“You don’t have to,” Draco says quietly.
Harry stands alone.
Pansy starts to snip, and Draco watches his hair fall onto the floor. When Pansy finishes, Draco’s hair falls slightly below his ears. Draco’s face looks naked, vulnerable.
The ring isn't there.
Pansy looks up at him, her dark hair spilling out across his pillow. Draco will most likely find her long brown hair for weeks to come.
“I’m gonna take you to my flat if that’s okay,” Potter says. “I have some potions that could help.”
to be an idiot.
“By the way,” Blaise quotes, because apparently he memorized the letter like the worthless friend he is, “I quite liked that dress you wore. I was going to tell you at the time, but I was worried it would come across wrong. Ginny made fun of me when I told her that, though, so I suppose I’ll tell you now. You look good in blue. To be honest, you look good in any color—“
Draco doesn’t have enough time in the day to even start half of the things he needs to do.
"Oh," Luna says softly.
He should have noticed that Draco was struggling. Harry failed Draco, the same way he failed Sirius and Cedric and Dobby and so, so many others.
Harry catches himself laughing during the film, which feels like such a betrayal. It has only been a few weeks. He shouldn't be this happy; he shouldn't be

The fourth time Draco gets a haircut, he has given up any pretense that this is a way to hide from wizarding eyes. Rather, it feels like

Back at the manor, once Scorpius is in bed, Harry asks, “Can we talk?”
“Anyway, it’s not like it matters,” Draco says. “No one will care enough to try.”
“Let’s get you home,” Harry says.
“You, uh,” Potter starts to say, “you okay?”
. This was
Then a week later, Ginny sits across from Harry on the couch, her hands twisting in her lap.
Harry didn’t know that there was a
“You,” she says accusingly, almost dubiously.
Draco stares at the floor next to her feet. He doesn’t know how to explain anything.
At the time, Draco didn’t understand what was happening or
Draco slowly, terrified of looking too eager, takes the wand. Potter offers his hand, and Draco feels like he’s about to walk out of the courtroom once more, everyone’s eyes and cameras trained on him.
Harry snorts and reaches out to grab the box. He slips the ring onto Draco’s finger, and Draco buries his face in Harry’s neck, his shoulders shaking.
“What the hell,” Harry says flatly.
Harry wants to say something petty and mean so much that it burns at the corners of his lips, but something stops him. Malfoy’s eyes are a little too wide to be called calm, and she is clutching the steering wheel so tightly that her knuckles strain white under her skin. And it’s not that Harry feels sorry for her because Malfoy doesn’t need anyone’s sympathy, let alone Harry’s—it’s just that . . .

“I read it in the paper.”
“Ready to go?” Draco asks, a smile curling up his lips.
food, Draco,” Pansy says gently.
Good to know his father would be willing to forgive Draco for not being an anti-Muggle terrorist anymore if he hadn’t come out as trans.
“Is it okay if I send owls?” Potter asks.
“Where to, driver?”
The stores run out of copies, and random people on the street feel the urge to come up and embrace him and tell him about all their shady pasts.
Except he doesn’t know where they are, and he can’t afford to send another owl.
“Harry’s here to see me,” says Draco. “Hermione will bring Rose by later.” He nudges Scorpius gently. “Give Harry a hug?”

like I talk to my father?” Draco demands.
When Draco was younger, he didn’t know.
Ginny rests her head on Harry’s shoulder for a moment, her hair cascading down their chest. Harry swallows, the very action making it difficult to breathe.
“I’m not drunk!” Pansy protests.
“You do the same for me,” Draco says, sitting next to her.
And it was working; it really was. Draco was doing better, better than he ever had, but he’s ruining it, and he can’t

Draco is going to have to talk to people. He’s going to have to pretend to be a decent, functional human being who isn’t a racist, worthless waste of magic.
The night starts out fairly well. Harry and Draco go to a movie, and Draco can feel his shoulders slowly relax. It's odd, the way Draco feels more comfortable around Muggles than wizards now.
“You’re always complaining about being cold,” Draco says in his offhand way.
“Our interactions affect you that much?” Draco asks sweetly. “Potter, I’m
So now Harry sits in Pansy's kitchen, sipping on tea and holding up his facade of being a functioning human with every bit of strength he has left.
“I don’t give her a chance,” Draco whispers back. “Why are we whispering?”
like?”
A few beats pass, and Draco is breathless and achy from laughter.
“Get a room, you fucking weirdos,” Pansy sneers.
Draco stumbles and lurches toward the ground.
Draco shakes his head, his shoulders tense. He has the vague impression that Tessa is annoyed with him, but he doesn’t know what he wants, other than
"--IS WRONG WITH YOU?" Harry shouts.
"Let's do this again sometime," Ginny says.
He snacks throughout the day. He slips down to the kitchen every now and then, so long as he has finished his homework.
“Right.” Potter nods, somewhat jerkily. “I’m, um--I’m going to go now. I’m sorry I bothered you; I just--”
Draco forces himself to eat every bite of food.

Pansy asked to meet Harry for tea. Harry thought about lying and saying that he was too busy, but Pansy would have seen straight through it.

particular. He just refuses to tell Harry the details of said particularities.
As they’re walking out the door, both clutching a handful of bags, Ginny murmurs, “Thanks.”
“Well, you’re about to be stuffed today,” Ron says cheerfully, pulling Harry into a hug. “Come on, then. We’ll get you all set up.”
Harry hugs her briefly, then looks at Ginny and swallows before hugging her tightly.
Malfoy slides into a parking spot at Wafflemeister, then turns to look at Harry, cocking her eyebrow.
He shouldn’t have sold the manor. He knows that he screwed up, but he does not know how to fix anything.
it’s ridiculous--for the most part, witches and wizards just ignore he exists.
“It tastes fine,” Draco says. “I’m just . . . not hungry.”
Rough hands catch him by his elbows, and Draco finds himself half-propped up at an awkward angle.
Touching Harry is like caressing a star, a perfect, burning, bright source of light, alone in a black, empty sky.
“I’m not hungry,” Draco says.
“It’s not--”
Draco should pull away from Potter. He needs to get away before Potter remembers how much he hates Draco.
Ron's voice falters.
“Probably wise,” Potter says once it’s clear Draco isn’t going to answer. “Better for your liver, anyway.”
Once the War ended and he got out of his temporary stint at Azkaban, he started researching what eating disorders even were. Draco doesn’t binge. He doesn’t purge. He doesn’t think that he’s fat. (Pansy and Blaise are right. He’s too skinny, with bones so sharp they might as well be cutting through his skin). Draco doesn’t have the issues that any of the people described in these books do.
“Because if you die in the rain, your Gryffindor friends will have my head,” Malfoy snaps.
Draco knows he deserves this, but he can't bring himself to care. He's so cold, all the time, and nothing he does will ever make him warm. He doesn't want to be here anymore. He is so
it’s twice as ugly as this one, and—“
“I was tired,” Draco says finally. “I didn’t like the person who looked back at me in the mirror.”
“I’m just fantastic,” Draco sneers, wrenching away.
in the papers.
Before Molly can say anything, Harry hears a shout of delight. Scorpius stands proudly, a dark green tie looped around his neck with a messy knot and dragging on the floor.
“Only if you let me pick out the shirts. Your taste is worse than Weasley’s, you know that?”
none of these Muggles know who he is. None of them know what he has done.
It’s fuzzy now that Draco is twenty-three, but Draco can still hear the click of the lock as his father charmed the door shut. He can still feel the oppressive darkness pressing in on him.
Harry glares at the selection of ties in front of him. They are all very nice ties and undoubtedly expensive ones at that, but Harry has the sinking feeling that Draco already owns all of them. That’s the problem with dating one of the richest wizards in England who, unlike Harry, has no reservations about spending said riches. He has already purchased everything.
“Malfoy!”
“What, I have to be drunk to want to touch you?” Potter demands.
Scorpius darts forward and drops a flimsy envelope in Harry’s lap. He steps back shyly, in stark contrast to his loud laughter from mere moments ago. Harry rips open the envelope to find a painstakingly drawn picture of Harry, Draco, and Scorpius holding hands.

“Why?” Malfoy asks. “I mean, granted, she is
Draco’s head jerks up to look at Potter. Potter swallows nervously, his hands fidgeting with his robes.
His eyes sting. Luna places her hand on Harry's cheek, then slowly folds the paper up into neat squares before tucking it into her pocket.
He could make it up tomorrow and just not eat. But this would count as one of the bad things, wouldn’t it? So then would he have to skip for two days? The numbers are beginning to blur together in his mind, and he can’t quite piece what the logical course is together.
Draco stands in the corner of a crowded room, his head aching. He doesn’t know why he comes to any of these things. Luna always turns limpid eyes on him and asks him to join her, then flits away about ten minutes in. Draco doesn’t know how to talk to people when he’s left to flounder on his own.
“You like working here?” Potter asks, after fingering the same vial of sleep potion for the fifth time.
But Draco still finds himself leaning into Potter’s touch against his will.
He doesn’t have an eating disorder. He has a coping mechanism.
Luna plays with Ginny’s hair, humming an odd tune, a small smile playing on her lips.
“It’s not charity,” Draco says. “It’s—“ He shuts his eyes briefly. “You helped me. This is my thanks.”
Harry’s mouth opens and closes. “Oh,” he says, like the idiot they are.
“Okay, that’s enough for now,” Ginny says. “Go try them on and see what you think.”
"We can take a bath later."

“I don’t--I don’t
at him—he just meanders about the store, touching everything that catches his fancy and avoiding Draco’s eyes.
It’s his fault. Draco should know by now that he cannot ever forget to pay attention to his surroundings. He does not have the luxury of thought when he’s in public—all attention has to be devoted to watching everything and everyone.
“I don’t trust you with a razor when you’re drunk,” Draco says dryly.

"The only good thing Lucius Malfoy taught his son was how to lie with a smile on his face," Blaise says.
“You can ask,” Draco says. “I might not reply, though.”
“The key,” Draco says once they’ve been seated, “is to get yourself in the moment. Breathe in your emotions. Feed on them.”
“You haven’t had food all day,” Pansy says.
“I thought you hated me,” Draco says.
It’s not real. It’s some kind of cruel trick of Draco’s delusional mind because now Potter is guiding Draco to his feet. Gently. Draco can’t remember the last time anyone was gentle with him.
“I’m a former Death Eater,” Draco hisses.
So he types
Draco does not have an eating disorder. He just has a healthy understanding of his own accomplishments.
Apparently, Potter has an aversion to mushrooms, feels a growing urge to smash his best friends over the head (they keep setting him up on blind dates), and can’t manage to win a game of Quidditch against his ex-girlfriend. Draco wants to reciprocate in kind because it’s only polite, but his life is just . . . boring. He doubts Potter wants to hear about Draco falling asleep on his desk or spilling tea all over a reporter’s lap and getting kicked out of his own interview.
“You,” Harry says, gently kissing Draco’s lips, “are beautiful.” He punctuates the space between each word with another kiss. “Lovely.” Their hands slip through Draco’s hair, resting at the nape of his neck. “Handsome. Ridiculous.
“Harry’s a nice name,” Hermione says. Ron nods in agreement, his mouth full of ice cream.
if they’re damaged?
All of a sudden, Harry knows what he needs to do.
"He's probably right," Blaise says, pouring himself a glass of wine. "Draco never
“It wasn’t for you,” Draco says loudly.
Draco flinches. “I wasn’t—they didn’t abuse me—“
Draco grasps Potter’s hand for a brief second, then flees from the courtroom.
Scorpius and Rose run into the room, giggling hysterically. Rose clutches a tinsel circlet in her small fist.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder.
There's something inherently broken about Draco.
“You never used to wear dresses,” Harry says. “Back at Hogwarts, I mean—although wizard robes are kind of like dresses. But I mean, even when you
I didn’t know I left that much of an impression.”
In answer, Harry wraps his arms around Draco and rests his cheek against Draco’s chest.

Draco stares down at the hamburger, his stomach twisting painfully. He can’t do this.
with you slamming into things!”
“You should wear heels,” Goyle says helpfully. “I bet Potter likes that you’re so tall. It’s probably a turn on.”
“When did you know?” Potter asks.
“Dude,” Weasley says, “that’s fucked up.”
Harry leans back in his seat and sighs.

Draco is one person, and the echo of his death will have little impact on the world. Harry will grieve for a while, but he will move on.
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny stare at him, unblinking, for a few seconds. Ron recovers first.
Draco does not want to go
He knows Hermione (everyone) is trying to help. But it's like they know a different language than what Harry normally speaks, and Harry doesn't know how to respond.
“In all honesty,” Pansy said, lying flat on their back on the couch, “I feel a little trapped. Like, I don’t feel like a guy, but I don’t feel like a girl, and I would honestly love to just
Harry gently pulls the pins out from Draco’s hair, and it falls around his face.
“Whatever,” he says. “We all know you’re the drama queen.”
“I suppose I could just give him money,” says Harry.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand gently.
Draco points his wand at his hair and whispers a cleaning spell. Now he just looks like a clean homeless person. Draco dons a dressing gown and turns into a homeless person who broke into a rich man’s house.
“I do
Draco sinks to the ground, his back against the wall, his hands gripping his hair tightly. He can’t stand up. He’s so shaky, and his head hurts, and he doesn’t know where to go—
at them.
“Harry.” Harry frowns for a moment, his brow furrowed. “He/they pronouns, I think. For now, anyway. I’m still trying to figure stuff out.”
“Hi, Daddy! Hi, Harry!” he squeaks, blushing. Rose starts to laugh, and Scorpius glares at her.
Draco, who had felt the urge to chop his breasts off ever since they began developing, said dismissively, “Everyone feels that way.”
He remembers Luna Lovegood switching from the boys’ dorms to the girls’ halfway through their third year. He didn’t know Luna, but it caused enough of a stir for everyone to talk about it. He remembers thinking,
Harry stares blankly. Is this how they’re going to die? Is death looming in front of them in the form of Malfoy in a truck?
Potter laughs, this awful huffy snort that isn’t a proper laugh at all. Draco hates it.
“I—I was a Death Eater,” Draco says.
Scorpius flings the tie over his shoulder and swaggers in all his seven-year-old glory before falling on top of Rose in a cloud of giggles.
Rose ignores him and plops the tinsel circlet on Harry’s head.
(The chocolate tasted like air on Draco’s tongue, and swallowing it was like consuming a sticky, tasteless sludge.)
but he also knows that he’s still going to do it.
“I met this prat named Malfoy the other day,” Pansy said. “He was a bit of a wanker, but I have to say he had a good taste in clothes. I think I’ll kill him and steal his wardrobe for my personal use. What do you say, friend?”
The third time Draco cuts his hair, Blaise comes with him.
So Draco enters a Muggle hair salon where no one knows who he is or what he did.
“Shut up,” Draco says, kissing Harry again.
For the first time in a long time, Draco actually feels warm.
Draco can’t tell if Harry is saying that Draco or Harry is too drunk, but for some reason, he can’t stop giggling after Harry says it.
“You have a picture?” Tessa asks.
Stop wiggling your eyebrows!”
“‘M not drunk,” Draco protests.
Back on their familiar ground, then. That’s probably a good thing—it wouldn’t do to become
He doesn’t
Draco nods dumbly because if he’s hallucinating, he might as well convince himself that he’s warm.
Draco laughs.
The wizard is screaming something, and Harry is prying the wizard off of Draco, but Draco can't hear a word they're saying. Draco's hair is caught on the rough brick, and the cold wall is biting through his clothes into his skin.
Malfoy stares at Harry blankly. Harry remembers that while he is currently on T, wearing a binder, and sporting a fresh haircut, he’s not exactly
"Sometimes we don't
“He’s ever so rich, Draco,” says Luna, her pale eyes wide with faux innocence.
The night ends with Percy joining Draco in making fun of Potter’s new shirt, so Draco is inclined to believe Luna and Potter over Percy. After everyone stands to leave, Draco finds Potter sending the oddest look of open warmth his way, which is frankly . . . unnerving. Draco would rather be hexed and bleeding out on the bathroom floor any day.
Potter starts to laugh, even though Draco didn’t say anything funny.
Harry runs his fingers through his hair absentmindedly.
“But still—“ Potter blinks. “Wait, Ginny?”
And just like that, Harry’s single.
Draco hates it when she’s right.
The first time Draco skips a meal to finish an essay, no one notices. So he does it again (and again and again and again).
Weasley opens his mouth, but Harry is already pulling Draco to his feet, his arm looped around Draco’s waist.
Blaise opens his mouth, most likely to bemoan the failing state of Slytherin friendship, but Draco is already following the stylist to his chair. The stylist is a peppy guy named Aaron who talks so fast that every word feels clipped short.
at him, and Draco deflates, dropping into a chair.
“You, um,” Potter starts to say, then hesitates. “Do you need me to go to the store for you? Since you’re sick?”
Ginny says sharply.
Harry’s head darts up. Malfoy sits in a black truck, the window rolled down, giving Harry the most judgmental stare he has received in a long time. And maybe Harry should be more focused on the judgment or the shady Death Eater past, but their brain is a little stuck on Malfoy being in a truck.
Draco looks down at the plate heaped with beef and vegetables and bread, courtesy of Pansy and Blaise’s combined efforts. The smell is giving Draco a headache, and he cannot even bring himself to lift his fork.
“—so you see,” Potter says, “you two have a lot in common!”
that on some days, there were things that he did not deserve.
He has checks and balances. He has a way to motivate himself, which may be slightly unconventional, but he’s different from others. He needs the pressure--he needs the
They stumble into Pansy’s flat as she cackles hysterically.
“Anyway, that explains why I’m eating waffles as I commiserate with my archnemesis. What brings you here?”
Silence falls once more, and Draco looks at his reflection in his full-length mirror. His eyes look far too wide for his face, and his hair is stringy and flat. He looks like a crazy person.
He does not want to think about what would happen if someone intercepted the owl and figured out where she lived.
The shop attendant, a young Korean woman named Tori, nods sympathetically.
“Potter,” Malfoy says impatiently. “Have you forgotten how to speak? What are you
His hand is still burning hours later.
Draco wakes up in the morning, surrounded by fluff and warmth.
of feeling empty, of having no choice. He is like a brittle autumn leaf, bound to crumple and blow away at the softest sigh of a breeze.

“What did you mean,” Potter asks, “that you don’t deserve to be touched?”
Draco swallows thickly. “I don’t understand.”
“I cannot
"I just haven't felt like getting a haircut," Harry says.
“That’s like giving a florist flowers, mate,” he says.
But Draco deserves the bite of pain; he deserves to know the agony Hermione felt as his aunt carved letters into her skin.
Harry digs his nails into his palms. He can't cry. He has to stay calm because if he cries, Ginny and Luna will be concerned, and then
Harry is so
Draco flinches back, and her eyes soften ever so slightly.
"You can't blame yourself--"
“Ah, fuck me,” Pansy mutters.
“For Salazar’s sake,
Draco buries his face in his knees. He’s hallucinating now. He has to be, because there is no way Potter could be standing over him, concern in his voice.
"I have nothing to forgive," Harry whispers. "I love you."
"Breathe, Harry," Ron orders.
Potter has only seen Draco at his worst, at the height of Draco’s cowardice and cruelty, at the height of Draco’s pathetic inability to get back on his feet.
Draco watches as Potter walks away.
“I’m going to go to their Fuck Around and Find Out dinner,” Draco says with great dignity. “And I am going to behave with utmost decorum and become best friends with Percy Weasley, and you’ll be left to scramble for a new best friend.”
Draco swallows thickly.
“Shut
as if each new haircut is another curtain being pulled aside.
The fifth time Potter touches Draco is slightly less humiliating than all the other times.
of themself.
Draco tries to think of something to keep the conversation going, except he always feels so helpless around Potter.
Except it’s been about a year now, and the donations are beginning to trickle away. Everyone wanted to help Squibs get an education and a decent home with a fresh memory of the horrors of the war, but now that they’ve grown fat and complacent in their peace, no one cares.
A week passes, and Draco has almost convinced himself that Potter forgot about the entire incident.
“Stop laughing, Pansy. Ow! Don’t hit me! It could happen, you know—
love you, Harry,” she says, then starts to cry.
Harry apparates to Draco’s house. Immediately, the sound of Scorpius’s slippered feet pattering down the stairs greets Harry’s ears. Scorpius skids to a stop in front of Harry, and Harry instinctively opens his arms for a hug.
Draco also wants to be the one who causes that sound for the rest of Potter’s life.
Draco rolls his eyes and crumples up the letter, tossing it into the fireplace and ignoring Ginny’s indignant squawks.
Aurors. Pansy crying in the corner. A mirror shattered on the floor.
Narcissa does not invite Draco to come again.
Draco looks at Harry, his brow furrowed.

A part of him fears that if he does not do this
Ginny squeezes Harry's hand briefly, and Harry flinches away.
to me, and--"
more attractive than you, but—“
The thing that people don't understand is that it's not always a bad day. Some days are so much better than anything Draco could deserve, and he never quite knows how to explain it to Harry.
“Oh,” Blaise says softly.
Malfoy’s lips quirk up into a tiny smile.
It’s morning. Maybe afternoon. Draco can’t bring himself to care. Through the haze of a blanket, all light looks the same.
“How short are we thinking today?” asks the hair stylist, a girl named Tessa with bright pink hair twisted up in a bun.
about what other people think about him. (He does. Fuck Potter for noticing.) Pansy has taken to chanting, “Gay gay homosexual gay,” whenever Draco receives a letter from Potter. Blaise is prone to cheering, “Homophobia wins!” whenever Draco fails to write a coherent response.
“No,” Draco says stiffly, still unsure over whether Potter is cracking a joke that only he understands. “It’s a program for Muggleborn children in families with a disliking for magic to find a new home, should it become necessary.”
Draco’s mouth feels frozen, as if everything about him is carved from ice.
The Manor is tainted. Every room is stained with the screams and blood of the Dark Lord’s victims, of the shaking terror that pervaded Draco whenever he ran to hide, of Aunt Bella leaning over him with her wand tapping against his collarbone. There is no room free of Draco’s panic or sins.
Despite popular opinion, Draco really doesn’t want to die.
“You are literally sitting in her lap.”
Draco takes a long drink to hide his face.
"Harry, do you even want to be here?"
A gleam of gold flies into Pansy's palm, and they drop it into Harry's hand. Harry collapses, his fingers closing around the ring so tightly that it bites into his skin. He buries his face in Pansy's shoulder.
“I liked your new book.”
“Why?” Draco asks.
Draco looks so offended that Harry just has to kiss him.
Harry tries to think of something snippy to say. He doesn’t like apologies. They make him feel uncomfortable, even when they aren’t coming from the likes of Malfoy. They’re too . . . soft and normal and polite, and Harry has wasted so much time in war being the Hero of the Universe that wasting more time with meaningless niceties is unappealing.
Harry hates Christmas with every fiber of his being.
In a moment of panic, Draco just points at the first person he sees, a man with hair neatly parted in the middle and slicked down.
Draco hates, hates,

Draco stares at his list from the privacy of his home. The problem is, none of these names are because of
“You’re wrong, y’know,” Draco slurs. “Once you figure out how many ish . . . iss . . . isht . . . how messed up I am, you’re gonna be like that star in the song. Twinkle twinkle, bye bye, sky.”
After trying on a pair of dark jeans and a black long-sleeved shirt, Draco stares at his reflection. He looks . . .
He doesn’t have an eating disorder. He has a penance to pay, and he has barely scratched the surface.
“Yes.”
Harry stops, expecting Luna to cut him off and say the same things that everyone else has been telling him. Instead, she waits, her eyes fixed on Harry's face.
"This was fun," Luna says brightly. "The wrackspurts are much less prevalent around you now."
“Consorting with blood traitors is bad enough,” Lucius had spat out the day Draco tried to tell him, the day Draco truly felt like he had lost
“Same to you,” Harry says.
“‘M I fucked up?” Draco asks.

In retrospect, that seems like exactly the kind of story Potter would like to hear.
Draco can’t stop shivering.
“What do you care?”
Harry isn't going to find it.
“I’m not,” Draco says tearfully. “I’m—“
With a muffled scream, Draco hurls his mug at the mirror.
Draco yanks the letter out of her hand.
“Is Weasley right?” he asks.
Then in the morning, he wanted to dig a hole to bury himself in. Merlin, he and Blaise were so
“And you’re in love with them,” Goyle chimes in because Pansy is a terrible influence.
He thinks about asking Blaise or Goyle, but he can’t handle the thought of dragging either of them into his mess.

“Stay for dinner, Draco?” Luna asks. “We’ll make cookies afterward.”
“No, I mean—“ Draco shakes his head, and the clinging thoughts like cobwebs in his mind scatter around him. “I’m not

At this point, his name to meal ratio has lost meaning. Ever since Potter decided to attach himself to Any Worthy Cause that catches his eyes, Draco and Luna’s charity has faced little difficulties. Eventually, Draco just has to scrap the list entirely because Potter is doing all the work for him.
Blaise leans back in his chair, watching Harry with his characteristically disinterested air. It's a relief, in a way, to be under Blaise's bored gaze. So many people treat Harry like a specimen to be dissected, but Blaise has a way of watching people without actually

to shake Potter’s hand. Potter just convinced a jury of witches and wizards—who would like to chop Draco up into little pieces and boil him in wax—to clear him of almost all charges. Draco got off with a light slap to the wrist and a two-year house arrest.
His father came back in the morning, his mouth hard and thin.
Tessa’s eyebrows raise, and she looks at Draco like he is an idiot.

“Let me get this straight,” Potter says with a skeptical cock of his eyebrow. “You want me to believe that you’re running a charity for Squibs and that you want me to donate to keep your students off the streets?”
Harry assumes that the next time he sees Malfoy, she’ll be back to her delightful self (in other words, the bitch who reduced Neville to tears multiple times). Better yet, that he’ll never see her again at all. Because fate is even more of a bitch than Malfoy is, such is not the case.
Of course they did.
Harry takes the ring out of his pocket, then sets it on top of Draco's grave. He rests his forehead against the cold marble gravestone and closes his eyes.
Draco was confused with Potter’s action, He doesn’t know why Potter acting all possessive. Pansy looked at them with her eyebrow raised and amusement on her face. She knew something that he don’t and he was curious to know what is it.
“Sorry, can’t do, you don't even know how to take care of yourself”
The next day later, when he comes down for breakfast, father acts like yesterday incident never happened and Draco acts like it never bothers him, but deep down inside of him, it took a great deal to not make it an issue.
he thought as he scrolled down the notifications. Five notifications from his Mail. Ten plus notifications from Snapchat. Twenty from Twitter, probably Pansy again.
Sniffling in the bathroom alone, cold air hitting her naked form.
She was grumpy a few moments ago, and then she was crying and then she goes back to being grumpy again and now when Harry is gone to buy her tampons, she’s horny.
Draco’s lean body fell on top of Harry’s sculptured tanned body. The cock inside of him keeps them locked together.
When they finally walked in, Draco was stunned to the core. Potter was wearing a green robes which suit him so fucking well. It compliment his green eyes. He doesn’t know what he was feeling right now, probably irritated because he looked better than he was.
Draco’s guns were on the other side of the room, behind his target, and the only way he could get to them was to get past the giant man. Frantically looking around, Draco’s eyes were drawn to a bookcase next to the cursing man. What Mulciber had in size and strength Draco had in speed and agility, and with a burst of adrenaline the blonde man scrambled to his feet and ran to the shelf, pushing the shelf as hard as he could. Mulciber grunted as the shelf hit his shoulder on its fall down, but it didn’t cause as much damage as Draco had hoped. There was fire in his eyes as he looked at Draco in rage, and Draco didn’t stop to think as he lurched past the fallen bookcase towards his duffel bag. Thanking all of the gods that he had pre-loaded his Glock, Draco turns around and fires at the advancing figure. The first shot hits Mulciber in the stomach, slowing him down, but he doesn’t fall until the third. Wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, Draco moves towards the fallen target to finish the job.
“No,” blood spat out of Draco’s mouth as he struggled against the bigger man’s grip, “I could go all day.” Draco used all the strength he could muster to kick Mulciber’s crotch, and with a load groan the man threw Draco back towards the wall of the apartment. Draco landed on a coffee table which instantly collapsed, and from his lying position he could see Mulciber bent over cursing.
“Potter?” The woman sticks out her hand to shake Harry’s, “I’m Hermione Granger from Behavioural Sciences. I gave Weasley some files you requested a few days ago and I just wanted to know if you’ve read through them yet?”
“So why ‘ant ya done it yet?” The man grinned widely, showing a mouth full of crooked teeth, “Tell ya what I think, I think ya ain’t gonna shoot me ‘cause you wanna know why yer daddy didn’t kill me in ‘98.” Draco remained silent and the man nodded proudly, “Thought so. Tell ya what, I’ll make ya a deal.”
“I'l take it.” Draco smiles and the mild tension which had begun to form in Harry’s stomach quells.
After a lunch which Draco practically has to force himself to eat he attempted to organise his thoughts, or rather one singular thought which had been particularly tormenting him. He grabs a pen and paper and scrawls the numbers down, looking at them like they’re a complicated equation he has to solve. After about fifteen minutes of staring at the paper, Draco’s mind is still completely blank and the numbers are starting to transition in and out of focus. Sighing dejectedly he runs his fingers through his white hair before resting his head in his hands and massaging firmly at his temples. Eventually, he decides that the dining room isn’t the best environment for him to think in, although not that any other part of the manor is particularly better for concentration. The air in all of the rooms is dense and thick with dust and the feeling of sadness that was always ever-present within the manor. Because of how heavy the air felt Draco often found it difficult to breathe even though he knew it was all most likely all in his head. When he steps outside even for a few moments, it's like this great weight has been lifted off of his chest allowing his lungs to finally open up and his head to stop spinning.
Draco sits up suddenly in bed, hyperventilating and sticking to his sheets with sweat. A rustle sounds from across the room, and instinctively he grabs the gun from under his pillow, points at the open window, and shoots. A loud bang followed by a small thud sounds out, and Draco blinks slowly while lowering the gun. He walks over to the window and looks down to the body of a bird. It lies completely still on the windowsill, wind ruffling soft white feathers now stained crimson. A deep feeling of guilt rises in Draco’s stomach, and he carefully picks up the dead creature.
“That makes sense,” Harry agrees, “I’m no expert on the organised crime that goes on around here but I can probably pull up some files of high profile individuals who may be involved.”
“Well,” Ron is more hesitant this time, “this is where Granger was more uncertain. There are examples of more extravagant crimes, not the simple killings. They’re… elevated. It's like whoever is committing the bigger kills wants to put on a show, like they’re performing to someone and showing what they’re capable of. It's a mockery, they’re humiliating the victims. Granger said she thinks these ones are different because it's not about killing, it's about power. They want people to know that they exist; they want to be known for what they’re doing. But she doesn’t know what she’s dealing with, whether it's one person or more. Yes all the deaths have a heightened level of violence and cruelty but they’re also all completely different. Plus many of them must have happened at the same time and in different places. Granger used the example of the butcher who was hung up with the pigs he’d slaughtered on one side of London then there was the group of teenagers who were impaled on spikes outside a cemetery on the opposite side. There were more too but you get my point, there are just a lot of coincidences in this whole thing.”
It's been awhile, I'm in lockdown, let's get lost in fantasy to feel better.
“It’s Draco Malfoy, Lucius’ son. Put me through.” He tried to sound demanding but the slight tremble in his voice gave him away.
“Um, there’s a loose end you’ve left. Cymbeline farm, about six miles from Malfoy Manor. Come quick.” With that Draco hung up the phone and tossed it back to the man, “Now tell me how to disable the bomb.”
“Nothing, why?” Ron doesn’t miss the subtle blush which rises on Harry’s cheeks as he goes back to typing on his phone.
Draco glares at his aunt, and is about to retort when there’s a grunt from the floor behind him. Within a second, Bellatrix has pulled a knife from her belt and stabbed Mulciber in the spine. “The Dark Lord sends his regards, Mulciber.” Bellatrix cackles as the man twitches on the ground, blood pooling on the wooden floor.

“No,” Draco replied without hesitation, “My Father had a deal with…your Lord. The Malfoys could continue with our business, and my Father would work on the side for the Lord. Now it might have escaped your notice, what with not visiting at all, but my Father is somewhat incapacitated at the moment. I continue the business, but have no part in the sick ways of your glorified gang.”

“Would you like it to be?”
“Someone like me?” Draco’s eyes didn’t leave the bloody body.
A few hours of reading and sorting through notes about assassinations pass and Draco has learned far too much about certain members of the 1980s government and the exact method of their assassinations, the inclusion of coloured photographs adding only more to his understanding. There was a significant drop in the 1990s, most likely due to his birth, and Draco smirks at the thought that his father must have been extremely annoyed that the birth of his son had hindered the businesses’ killing progress. The majority of the cases were mundane and straightforward (as mundane and straightforward as assassinations could be, anyway) but one in particular catches his attention. Attached to the inside of a document from 3rd June 1998 is a picture of a family of nine smiling happily at the camera, but what Draco’s eyes are drawn to is the small black Labrador with a white mark on its nose sat in the middle of them. Draco stares in confusion for a moment or two, squinting at the picture in confusion. Although it's been around 20 years Draco is almost certain that the dog is Midnight, but the rational side of his brain is telling him that that’s ridiculous. But the date is from 3rd June, only two days before his eighth birthday when he was given an identical dog. Looking inside the file he learns that the father, James Rhodes, had gotten into debt with Voldemort and when he couldn’t pay him back Lucius had been sent to execute the whole family. Usually Voldemort’s lackeys (or the ‘Death Eaters’ as they liked to be called) would be involved in such a large scale job since they were typically a lot more violent, but Lucius had owed Voldemort a favour and so he was sent in to do the dirty work, but had probably decided the dog would be best used for Draco instead. What catches Draco out, after the initial surprise that his dog had belonged to an executed family (it’s an extremely Lucius thing to do), is the fact that Lucius only reported eight executions and there are nine people in the photo. Lucius Malfoy was by no means a good man, but he had been damn good at his job and it's just not the kind of thing that he would intentionally let slide. Unless one of the people wasn’t there for some reason and for some reason Lucius decided they weren’t worth the effort tracking down. Knowing Lucius it was possible that in his arrogance he didn’t think the person who was lucky enough to evade assassination would be competent enough to track them down, and so he probably just lied to Voldemort by saying they were all dead.
“Not really, no.” Ron was squinting at the screen in earnest, trying to understand what Harry was trying to imply.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron senses Harry’s discomfort so hurriedly attempts to change the subject. “Hey don’t fret; I forgot to tell you that Granger came up the other day to give me some extra insight into the cases. Wanna see?” His tone is hopeful and Harry smiles weakly as Ron brings over a thick wad of paper. “Do you want to read through it now?” Ron asks.
The fresh air hitting his face as he steps outside the house is a vast relief; he had no idea how stuffy it was in there until he was out. The walk back to his house was a blur, and as he stumbled up to the room where his parents stayed his mind was completely blank. He only began to think when he walked over to the dresser specified in the instructions, opened it, and curiously cocked his head at the note in the otherwise empty draw. He hesitantly opened it and stared at the paper.
“And hopefully I never earn that.” Draco mutters, keeping his eyes focussed on his aunt instead of the paralysed dying man on the ground.
As Draco aimlessly wandered down the large stone steps at the entrance of the manor he observed the gravel drive and hedge surrounding it. Malfoy Manor must have looked grand hundreds of years ago, and parts of the manor have held up well such as the wrought iron gate and the main house-- but the acres of land surrounding the home had overgrown to the point where they were unrecognisable. Dark green weeds poked through the gravel but there were no colourful weeds like dandelions or daisies to make the drive any less bleak. The darkness was exemplified by the fact that the overgrown hedges tower high over Draco’s head, making it difficult for sunlight to cut through. Towards the end of the drive Draco cuts down through the hedge and emerges onto masses of open land. If you walked further and looked back at Malfoy Manor you once could have seen it clearly over the hedge and trees but now it was completely hidden from view. This spot is without doubt the area in the manor’s realm that gives Draco the most peace. In this space he can pretend to be anyone he wants and isn’t reminded constantly of the life he truly has. Despite it nearing the end of June Draco shivers slightly and puts his hands in his coat pockets for warmth. Ever since he could remember the manor was significantly colder than the areas surrounding it, but Draco had soon learned to love the cold.
“First off I ain’t gonna go running, case ya ‘ant noticed I got a bad leg. And yea I called yer house, took ya long enough to pop by, thought ya were a skilled tracker. Oh wait nah that was yer daddy weren’t it?” Draco cocked the gun and didn’t say anything. The man rolled his eyes and leant back in his chair, “So I guess ya got questions?”
“Getting tired, yet?” Mulciber jibed, grabbing Draco by the collar and lifting him up as though he weighed nothing at all.
Harry sits in silence as he attempts to organise the new information in his mind, but he feels like he’s hitting a brick wall. “The only link between the cases is the sheer amount of coincidences.” Ron snorts under his breath as Harry rolls his eyes, “Can you leave the papers on my desk? I’ll go over them later.”
“It’s not you doing something wrong Draco,” Lucius’ cruel smirk was back, “It’s about being taught an important life lesson. You are too reliant on the things around you at making you feel like you belong. The things you care about aren’t going to stay with you and you need to get used to fending for yourself. You are going to have to get used to not getting attached to things in such a childish way; caring is weakness and I don’t want weakness in my family. Do you think I am weak? Do you think my father was weak? Who are you to tarnish the legacy we have built over something so pathetic as caring. I am teaching you a valuable lesson here, draco, so to begin we’ll start with a simple task,” Lucius pointed towards the gun in Draco’s hands, “Shoot the dog, Draco.”
Hermione stays silent for a moment or so more before speaking again. “Fine,” she sighs, “but if anything happens to me it’s on you. You better find me a decent paid job if I get fired.”
Trigger warning for this chapter for child abuse and Lucius being an evil twat
Imagine being able to go on a date haha FUN :))
“Please,” Draco throws the gun on the ground as he sobs, “Please, Dad please, I don’t- I can’t do this please don’t make me kill him. I-I’ll do better I swear I’ll do what you ask and I won’t question it. I-I’ll be the best son ever but just don’t d-do this I don’t want to hurt anything. Midnight is al-all I’ve got please-” The cries of the boy had been cut short by Lucius dragging him upwards so he was stood straight. Lucius picked up the gun from the ground and had placed it in his son’s shaking hands. He slowly moved behind the shaking child and angled the gun so that it pointed directly between the dog’s eyes.
“How do you know about him?” Draco’s voice is just a murmur as he silently curses Voldemort for bringing Harry into this.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry smiled before sitting down on the wicker chair and awkwardly finding an angle where he didn’t kick Draco by accident, “So...have you ordered anything to drink already” Harry internally cringes at his question when he notices the empty coffee cup in front of Draco. How could he be able to observe the littlest things about someone yet completely miss the glaringly obvious? Thankfully Draco just smiles at Harry and doesn’t comment on his idiocy.
Also I spent ages on that hyperlink Elliot Alderson is shaking, I put it in because I wasn't sure if everyone would get what a 'plastic suit' was and I didn't really know how to describe it.
“Oh lower the gun Draco, where’s your cuddle for Auntie Bella?”
“Password.” The bored voice of a woman sounded over the phone, Draco vaguely recognised it but he couldn’t place her.
Draco had remained silent throughout the man’s story, and the missing information in the file finally made sense. Lucius was terrified of Voldemort, that much Draco knew, and so it wasn’t surprising he attempted to hide his failure. He does genuinely feel bad for the man, no matter what the parents have done the children should never be pulled into this mess of a world. But that doesn’t change the fact that the man is a liability to Draco, and Draco sure as hell wasn’t going to let his father’s mistakes be his downfall.
“Put the dog down, Draco.” Lucius’ tone had been cold and sharp, his words cut into the thick air like a knife. When Draco hesitated, Lucius rolled his eyes and grabbed the back of Midnight’s collar, plucking the confused puppy from his arms and putting him onto the ground where he began to sniff curiously at the grass, utterly oblivious to the situation.
As always please kudos and comment ily all!
“I don’t know,” Harry shrugs and smiles briefly at the waitress placing their drinks on the table, “I guess you and I have a lot in common.”
Harry loses himself in staring at the man, the only sense of time passing being the gradually dissipating coffee. Eventually Draco snaps out of his thoughts and looks back at Harry with a curious gaze.
“But you don’t keep people safe,” Harry grins down at Draco menacingly, “You couldn’t even protect your own parents. You’re not good enough for me, or anyone. You don’t deserve to live a happy life when you’ve torn lives away from so many others.”
“I don’t negotiate,” Draco looked dead into the man’s eyes, “I’m not leaving until you’re dead. But I’ll humour a dead man, what do you propose?”
Suddenly, the loud sound of the house phone rang out, startling Draco and causing his heart to race. The main landline hadn’t sounded for months since most calls went straight to Draco’s mobile, so a feeling of unease settled in his stomach instantly at the sound of the high pitched ring. Who could possibly have his number? In the moment, he decided that it would be best to let the phone continue ringing due to the fact that it was most likely a sales call or a misdial, and he breathed an audible sigh of relief when it eventually fell silent. Draco goes to turn back to the comfort of the instrument when the phone begins again, causing him to hesitate and rethink the current situation. Running quickly through the possible scenarios in his head, he concludes that he should go to the phone and wait to see if it rings again. Third time’s the charm, as everyone says.
“Hello again Harry.” Draco’s voice is just as smooth as it had been that first night but the cockiness is considerably less prominent and his smile is more genuine than the smirk.
"I haven’t been able to find a definite link yet if that’s what you’e asking,” Ron pulled up his chair so it was next to Harry’s, “but I am looking over some old cases which have a lot in common. Look here; about three years ago there was a series of arson attacks on a couple of council estates just outside of London. They were all put down to local gangs but no one was brought in for questioning because no one said anything. You know, the whole ‘snitches get stitches’ mentality. Well, because no one was brought in it was just forgotten about, but the files still ended up in the system. The thing is that they’re not unusual cases; they’re just normal gang arson. But what’s weird are the locations-- hang on I’ll get up the map.” Ron paid close attention as Harry got up a digital map of the outskirts of London up, not quite seeing where Harry was going with this but nevertheless willing to listen.
“Oh!” Her confused expression melted into a smile, “thank you lovey. You know I do worry about a young man like you cooped up in a big ol’ empty house like this, it's just not right my dear. I know you care about your folks, but they’d be just as well looked after in a hospital. You just think about it for next time I’m over, okay? Don’t want you missing out on life to give it up for your parents.” The pair stop at the bottom of the spiral staircase, just in front of the main entrance.
As the following week drags by, Draco becomes increasingly distracted from his work, and this distraction has a name. The distraction also has adorably messy hair and broken glasses and absolutely atrocious fashion sense. Ever since Draco parted ways with a certain Harry Potter on that dark street the man has been on his mind constantly like an itch he can’t get rid of. It's not like Harry is someone he would want to forget about, his smile alone made Draco’s mood higher than it had been in years. Yet in his line of business, you simply can’t afford to get attached to people. The risk of Harry getting hurt increases with each and every thought that Draco spares regarding his presence, and even though Draco barely knows Harry, the thought of him getting dragged into Draco’s destructive web doesn’t bear thinking about. He’d already lost two family members. How could he cope with losing someone that, despite barely knowing him, made him feel normal?
After that, Draco became colder every day, and he didn’t ever think to care about anyone or anything. There are many reasons why Draco resents his father, a key one being how he was denied a ‘normal’ childhood. He never had a birthday party with his friends from school as Lucius didn’t think that they were worthy of entering the Malfoy home, he had never been allowed an actual pet to keep him company, and most of all he resented Lucius for never letting him be anything more than the perfect Malfoy heir who would someday marry a wealthy woman from a family on the same level if not higher than the Malfoys and he would carry on his father’s legacy. Sometimes Draco questions whether his father was like him when he was younger, whether he wanted to rebel against Draco’s grandfather and move to Italy to become a philosopher or something. But that would mean Draco was like Lucius, and Draco was nothing like Lucius. Even as a child he went against what his father wanted to some extent, until the dog incident taught that it was better to just do what Lucius wanted. In a strange way he misses the simplicity of childhood, he was told what to do, where to be, what to wear, what to eat, what to say, who to be. Now there’s no one left to guide him and Draco doesn’t know who he is well enough to guide himself.
“How do you know his name?” Draco asks, “Did Voldemort send you to kill him as well as me?”
“She’s your sister.”
Just as Draco was about to put the file away and call it a night the numbers from the phone call rang out in his head again. “980603,” Draco murmured to himself, looking over the file again, before the realisation hit and he flipped the numbers around, “030698.”
“Harry”, his shoulders relax and he continues piling the papers up, “My name’s Harry. And yes I’ve just had a look through them and Ron gave me a brief rundown of what the two of you discussed. But I’d be more than happy to talk through it with you now-- honestly I feel like I'm running in circles in this whole case.” Hermione nods in agreement and perches on the edge of Ron’s desk.
“I’ll think about it, thank you Jean.” Draco waves her off before closing the door.
“Draco.” Voldemort’s voice snapped Draco out of his thoughts and he reluctantly re-entered the room. The brightness seemed even more overpowering on his tired eyes and he was surprised to see the man still so calm despite having been in the company of someone Draco found even more terrifying than Lucius. Draco looked expectantly at Voldemort, wondering why his presence was needed. Voldemort handed Draco the gun that Draco had left on the kitchen table, and a shiver of déjà vu ran through Draco as he recalled his father handing him the gun to kill Midnight all those years ago.
“The Dark Lord has eyes everywhere,” Bellatrix looks directly into Draco’s eyes, “This is who you are meant to be Draco, it’s what you were raised for.”
“And why the fuck would I do that?” Draco snorted, “I can just shoot you right now and be done with it. I have no intention of getting involved in Voldemort’s little games. Do it yourself.”
Once again thank you @Sevondia for being my favourite human/beta ever <3
“Hello?” Harry’s voice is low and husky, like he’s just been awoken from a deep sleep. Draco feels a sense of guilt wash over him knowing that he’s woken Harry up for such a stupid reason, but he can’t bring himself to hang up the phone.
‘I’ve royally screwed myself over haven’t I?’ Draco thinks with a small smile. Trust him to build up all these walls just to have them come crashing down for a man he barely knows. Plus he’s now using Harry as a coping mechanism for stressful situations. Even Draco knows that such a fixation isn’t particularly healthy, but he can’t bring himself to stop. God, psychiatrists would have a field day poking around inside his head. But the distraction of Harry clearly works because by the time there was a knock on the door he hadn’t had a mental breakdown. He blinked slowly and glanced at the oven clock, raising his eyebrows when he realises he’s fazed out for half an hour. The man coughed to capture Draco’s attention and nodded stiffly. Draco sighed and reluctantly walked through to the door, opening it to reveal the towering figure of Voldemort. Draco had met the man when he was younger and had seen him many times over the years but every time seemed to be more and more unsettling. He looked like the Grim Reaper in the books Draco used to read, a sunken, pale face shrouded in darkness both physically and metaphorically.
He remembers a few weeks before his eighth birthday he’d seen a tiny dog with black fur and wide, bright eyes when he had been out shopping with his mother in the town, and after that day he’d begged and pleaded his father to let him have a dog. For an eight year old he’d put forward as convincing an argument for having a dog as he could (“I promise I’ll look after it all on my own and it’ll make me into a real grown up like you want, Father!”) and eventually Lucius gave in, which Draco was shocked by at the time. On the morning of his eighth birthday Draco had ran down the main staircase to the living room where his abundance of presents were wrapped in silver and green wrapping paper. The eight year old had bypassed all the boxes and ran directly for the black Labrador with a white smudge on its nose in the middle of the room. It was small and excited and had a silver collar around its tiny, fluffy neck-- and when Draco went down to stroke its head it began dashing about his feet in excitement. The eight year old had laughed, and in that moment he had felt the happiest he had ever been. When his parents entered he did something he had never done before: he ran straight into Lucius’ arms and sobbed out of sheer joy, most likely staining his father’s satin shirt in the process. Lucius had remained uncomfortable against Draco, but the boy hadn’t expected him to react any differently. When he pulled away he looked up at his mother to thank her but had been met with sad, empty eyes and a strained smile which was more forced than usual. Draco was confused for a moment but shrugged it off; he hadn’t wanted anything to ruin the greatest birthday he’d ever had.
“You’re lucky I don’t just shoot you now.” Bellatrix’s grin widens at the anger in Draco’s voice, “You’ve not even come to see Mother since the accident, just left me alone to deal with it. So answer my question before things get messy; what are you doing here?”
“Don’t speak of him like that,” Although I do agree, Draco thinks to himself, “I’ve told you my answer and its no. End of conversation. And if anything happens to my friends, there’ll be hell to pay. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a job to finish.” He grabs Bellatrix’s wrist and pushes her away from him. She pouts at him, but doesn’t make any attempt to push back.
Harry places a hand gently over Draco’s.“You’re not alone,” he says softly, “not anymore.”
The man wagged his finger mockingly, “Nah-ah, yer waitin’ ‘ere until he arrives. Still got six hours left on the clock, didn’t know how long we’d be talkin’.” Draco felt his fists clench in anger and he tried to focus on keeping his breathing steady. There was no use in panicking in a time like this. He let his mind wander far away from this current situation and found himself thinking of Harry. The man’s presence was extremely calming so Draco pretended he was here with him, as childish as that may seem. Thoughts about Harry ran through Draco’s mind like wildfire, filling his head with images of the dark haired man. He was still a mystery to Draco and as much as Draco liked being the smartest one in the room he knew damn well that he’d met his match. He knew he would give anything to just glimpse inside the mind of Harry, he wanted to know every inch of his mind, wanted to know what makes him tick, what makes his heart speed up and what makes him break down in tears and not want to get up in the morning. It’s somewhat amusing to Draco to think of various interactions he could have with Harry, but ultimately he knows nothing could ever come of wishful thinking. They may be similar but Draco highly doubts Harry would be willing to have any form of a platonic let alone romantic relationship with an assassin. And even if he did it would simply be too great a risk for the two of them. Take the situation Draco is currently in; he’s somehow gotten his parents hooked up to a bomb and now he’s waiting for the most infamous mob boss in the UK to come and do who the fuck knows to a random man who owed Lucius a whole lot of money. Throw Harry into the mix and Draco just doesn’t think he could handle that. Then again he is a damn good liar and if he was as careful with Harry as he is with everything else then there’s no need for Harry to ever find out about this part of Draco’s life.
After about an hour and a half of walking across the hills and looking at the towns below Draco reached a wire fence cutting the old, crumbling farm house from the fields surrounding it. The walls were holding up as well as they could but it was clear that the house was in dire need of refurbishment if the owner wanted to preserve it. The battered roof had tarpaulin over large patches, and nearly all the windows had cracks in them. Despite its pitiful appearance the house was clearly inhabited as Draco could see by the light shining through the windows. The cover of darkness meant that anyone inside would barely be able to see Draco standing across from the window, but Draco could see the middle aged man bustling around the brightly lit kitchen. Draco didn’t recognise him from the photograph but he presumed the man must have been one of the older children given his age. His hair was going grey and there were bald patches appearing in random places, most likely a sign of stress and not of old age. His clothes were ill fitted and worn, the brown, plaid shirt and denim jeans showing a clear lack of care and maintenance. Draco couldn’t see below the man’s waist as he moved past the windows but he assumed the shoes were in no better condition. He also appeared to have a limp as Draco watched him move at the awkward angle; an added bonus making Draco’s job a hell of a lot easier. It was always annoying when you had to chase a target.
“So,” Harry presses, “What do you do?”
“Do you want to make your family proud, Draco?”
“Are you going to tell me what you do?”Harry counters.
“You have until midnight tomorrow, choose wisely.” With that, she swoops out of the room, and Draco doesn’t dare move until he hears the door quietly shut. Letting out a shaky breath, Draco turns around to stand over the weakly breathing body of Mulciber. The dying man’s eyes open and stare at Draco, as if he were trying to communicate one last ‘fuck you’ before he goes. Without a word, Draco puts a bullet in the man’s forehead, a feeling of unease in his stomach as he watches Mulciber’s eyes go glassy. Quickly, Draco grabs his duffel bag and quickly scans around the apartment. It is messier than those of his usual kills, but the only prints left will be Mulciber’s and Bellatrix’s, so there’s no need to attempt to clean anything.
“Hello? What do you want?” Draco’s voice is much more rushed this time, with a hint of concern. The cry was high pitched, almost like a child, and as bad a person as he was, the sound of this pained child panicked him. The phone falls silent again for a moment before the breathing starts again. This time it's heavier and gets increasingly louder. The knots in Draco’s stomach which had been present when he was walking down the corridor come back with vengeance and his heart-rate speeds up. He angrily slams the phone down and takes three steps back, looking at it like it just transformed into a cat. Draco shakes his head aggressively, blonde strands falling over his eyes, and tells himself to get a grip over what was probably just a stupid prank call. He glances at the large grandfather clock in the far right of the room and sees it's almost ten o’clock at night. As soon as he notices this his body begins to ache with fatigue and he decides that it's probably time to retire for the night. In his youth he’d stay awake well into the early hours of the morning but as he’s grown older his body can’t function on less than five hours of sleep. Wearily, Draco goes towards to stairs leading to the second floor, but stops in his tracks when he hears the phone ring again. Part of him wishes to just ignore the caller and and go pass out on his bed but he knows it’s likely that the caller will just keep on calling. But they’ll probably stop if he shouts at them; after all they’re probably just some bored children. He picks up the phone once more and listens out for the heavy breathing, but he can’t hear anything at all.
“Thought so,” the man nodded, “Got a lot more balls than yer daddy did, kid. And put that fuckin’ gun down, I got bad eyes an’ that’s messin’ me focus up.”
“Sure,”Ron chucks the stack of notes at Harry, “Just don’t stay here too late, alright? I’m finishing now but I’ll send Ginny up at 10 to make sure you’re packing up and going home.”
“So” Ron pushed away from his desk so that his spinning chair travelled up next to Harry, “Whatcha doing?” Harry glances sideways at Ron briefly before smirking.
Ron nodded slowly as he took in the information and attempted to organise his thoughts. “So,” he said as he absentmindedly ran his thumb along his bottom lip, “You’re saying that this wasn’t a gang crime? We’re looking at third party involvement. But what’s the third party? What’s their motive? We can’t just start throwing around accusations without evidence.”
The feeling of relief as he finally reaches the parlour is immense, like a huge weight has been lifted off his chest. He leans against the fading wallpaper and sighs deeply, closing his eyes and scolding himself for being so childish in his unease. The sound of the phone ringing yet again startles him and he hesitates for a moment before picking it up from the receiver.
But now I wanna get in touch with Voldemort, give him a lil bit of payback for what he did. Ya know ma niece were only three year old? God I ain’t ever gone forget what she looked like when I found ‘em. Half her fuckin’ face were missin’ and the flies had made her into their own goddamn playground. That evil son of a bitch is gonna pay for that.”
Getting lost in his thoughts like this was something Draco often found himself doing. At a young age he felt himself being pulled into a world of fantasy in which he didn’t have to think through everything twice before he said it, a world where his parents didn’t care if his collar was slightly crooked, a world where he didn’t have to be him. When he was out of the house with his mother he would often see a family of redheads laughing and constantly smiling. They all wore mismatched socks and ghastly knitted jumpers at Christmas time, and his own mother would look at them like they were sewer rats whilst encouraging Draco to do the same. However, the conditioned sneer he held didn’t reach his eyes, and his mind would be left yearning to join a family like that where they focussed on love and not “representing the family name in public”. But dreams don’t come true, Draco learnt that quickly enough. And yet now here is this man with the ability to make Draco forget about all the shit going on in his life and brought out the reclusive smile which hadn’t been seen in years. His phone buzzes again in his pocket and Draco opens the text from Harry.
The man smirked as he leant against the sink, and a subtle feeling of unease settled in Draco’s stomach. “Ya know ya do spend a lotta time in those woods by yer house. Enough time for someone to walk into that big ol’ mansion and plant a timer in the room where ya keep yer folks. Yer pretty fucked up kid, keepin’ ‘em locked up in that house like prisoners. I’d be doin’ ‘em a favour. So yer gonna do as I say or else I don’t tell ya how to stop the bomb goin’ off an’ its bye bye mummy an’ daddy.” The man handed over a phone to Draco, looking at him expectantly. As much as Draco despised his parents, especially Lucius, he didn’t have the heart to kill them. They were still his parents after all, or at least that’s what he told himself as he dialled the number for the headquarters of Voldemort’s organisation. Someone picked up on the third ring but didn’t say anything.
“Great,” Voldemort clapped, “Now that’s over with, I’ve been meaning to ask you about joining my organisation. We could use someone like you, Draco.”
“Would you do the honours Draco?” Voldemort’s voice was smooth and calm, juxtaposing the manic gleam in his eyes, “After all, you were the one who discovered this mistake of your father’s.” Draco was a lot quicker to take this gun than he had been to take the one to kill Midnight. He turned to the man and looked at him with dead eyes, curiosity rising about why he was so willing to die.
“Freelance work,” Draco replies quickly but with an air of nonchalance, “My father was an attorney and wanted me to work in law but it's not for me.”
“I--,” Draco’s words came out in choked sobs, “I don’t want all of that, Father. I jus--I just want you and Mother to love me.” He practically mumbled the last part, and if it hadn’t been for the complete stillness of the air Draco doubted his father would have heard him. Then the sound of Lucius’ laughter pierced the air and Draco began to feel sick. It wasn’t the laughter of a father who was playing an elaborate and cruel joke on his child, instead it had been the laughter of a man driven to cruelty in the pursuit of creating a legacy.
“That would be wise.” Draco smiles and leans back in his chair. “So,” His voice signifies a change in topic, “Tell me about your family.” Harry’s eyebrows raise in surprise, he hadn’t been expecting that topic so soon. Draco notices his surprise and continues to speak. “When I mentioned not wanting to do what my father told me you nodded in agreement, I’m interested to know why.”
“Well I did learn from the best,” the compliment made Harry’s smile widen. “But seriously have you got anything new? I’m getting bored with the robberies McGonagall has given me to look over. There’s only so many times I can read about lax security in the alcohol section at Tesco, you’ve gotta give me something vaguely interesting.”
“Well,” Bellatrix smiles sweetly and lowers the knife, “That’s not the attitude a future follower of the Dark Lord should have. Why, he sent me personally to advise you to take on your Father’s role.”
“You’re like a chameleon.” Harry blurts out without thinking, but Draco just raises one eyebrow and makes a small hand gesture as if to say ‘continue’. Harry obliges, “You switch how you look to fit in with a new environment. You’re good at it too, anyone else wouldn’t notice the changes.”
“And the others? You said that most of them were average, not all of them.”
“I did work in the field,” Harry replies tentatively, “I worked with a few other analysts on a lot of cases for the first year or so that I was here. I was good in the field, but the higher-ups thought I’d be of more use in this office looking over the notes and writing up reports with an extra level of analysis that no one else could give. I can’t say I disagree with them, I work a lot better in this environment than I do with others.”
When Draco’s cousins eagerly asked him what he had gotten for his birthday later on at a family gathering he’d looked at them with dead eyes and told them that he’d gotten a snakeskin notebook.
Beta once again by @Sevondia :)
“Lone wolf?”
“Here,” He holds his hand out to take her bag, “Let me carry that down. You’ve done enough for me over the past few months anyway.” Jean looked surprised at his actions, especially considering they had barely spoken in all the times she had been visiting beside the impersonal exchanging of names.
“Oh I beg to differ.” Draco’s cold and calculating smirk is back and Harry shifts uncomfortably under the intrusive gaze. Unsurprisingly Draco notices this discomfort, but surprisingly he rectifies the situation by letting his cold eyes fill with warmth and the unsettling smirk melts into a friendly smile.
“I’ll take a chance. You seem like you could do a lot better than just the paperwork side of analysis. I never see you out in the field, but just by listening to your take on my work I can tell you’re wasted in this office. So my question is why do you choose to stay in here?”
“And look how far that got her,” Bellatrix places a hand on Draco’s gun, gently pushing his arm down, “I’m not going to bring Sissy back, and neither are you. It’s a lost cause, Draco.”
The man stood up as soon as Voldemort entered, and Voldemort looked him up and down with an air of boredom and annoyance at being brought out for this.
There was just a single word written on the paper in the same handwriting as the instuctions:
These are the thoughts running through Draco’s head on the Wednesday evening following their encounter. He’d texted the other man a few times after the initial meeting, but he craves having an actual conversation with the dark haired man. Yes, texting is good for thinking carefully about what he can and can’t say, but ultimately Draco struggles to connect with anyone through a screen. He wants to be able to see how Harry’s styled his hair and what this says about his personality. He wants to be able to smell to subtle scent of Harry’s cologne.  He wants to see the way Harry’s green eyes light up when Draco smiles at him. Never before has anyone been able to wheedle their way into Draco’s mind and completely warp his perception of the world in the way that Harry Potter did. Not that Draco would have let anyone in prior to this experience; the old idea of ‘they can’t hurt you if you don’t let them in’ had been indoctrinated into his mind from an early age. And what would Draco’s darling father have to say about Draco considering opening up his heart to another man, especially a man who doesn’t seem to have any noble ties? God forbid the Malfoy name is sullied; Lucius’ poor heart couldn’t stand such a thing. In a strange way, the fact that Draco knows how much his father would disapprove of his desires only makes him want to act on them more, to remind his father that he had failed to make the perfect son he always dreamed of.
“That’s okay, I didn’t see it at first until I went over my notes again.” Harry smiled briefly at Ron before pulling up a list of properties on his computer. “Alright, so even though the areas are all council housing the people living there have the same landlord, well the company anyway. They’re not paying rent to the council-- they’re under a housing association, I don’t know the name and it doesn’t really matter because that’s not the link. It could be if the houses attacked were more random, but the only houses which sustained any major damage were all under a private landlord: this man.”Harry clicked off the list of properties and brought up the file on ‘Dirk Cresswell’; a private landlord owning property in all the areas which had been attacked.
“Coming out tonight, Harry? It’s quiz night at the Three Broomsticks and Neville wants you to come along to get your
“I’m going to stop you right there,” Ron interrupted him abruptly, “You work harder than anyone I’ve ever met, certainly harder than anyone in this department. So don’t you dare start bombing off having a life so you can lose yourself in some killer’s mind, it's not healthy.” Ron gestures wildly at Harry, the compassion clear in his blue eyes. â€œI know you’re not keen on coming out with everyone else here, and I don’t mind that because I know you. Even if you don’t think I do, I do. As long as I’ve known you you’ve avoided getting close to people and I’ve done my best to avoid forcing you into a situation you won’t be comfortable in, but goddamnit Harry I swear to god if you don’t at least try with this guy I will tell Mum you’ve not been looking after yourself.” Most people would assume that Ron was joking but the gaze he held told Harry that Ron was deadly serious. “Now which is worse; having a coffee with this guy who you’re clearly into, or having my Mum not let you leave her sight until you’ve gained at least five pounds and sleep for over eight hours a night? Now I don’t know about you but I’d rather have a date and keep my job. So wha’s it gonna be?” Ron is somewhat surprised at his outburst, but he takes pride in the fact that Harry hadn’t zoned out at any point and seemed to be digesting his words carefully.
“Oh lovey,” Jean gently cups Draco’s cheek, “I know you want to please your old man but he’d much rather you be happy and stress free than to stay looking after him and your Ma in this old place.” Draco barely contains a snort of laughter at how wrong she is.
“Deal,” Harry grins at the dark haired woman before him, “I like you, Hermione.”
A shiver had ran up Draco’s spine as his father’s gaze pierced his skin like a dagger. The eight year old nodded slowly, unsure of where this conversation was going. Lucius smirked slightly at the blonde haired boy before he reached into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a loaded pistol. Draco’s breathing turned to frantic gulps of air as his heart rate sped and he stepped back, patting at his leg in the hope that Midnight would come over to him.
“Aw,” Bellatrix takes Draco’s face in her bloody hand, “Little Draco’s all grown up. But you’re forgetting one tiny thing, boy,” she leans in to whisper in his ear, “The Dark Lord won’t accept ‘no’. So either you do as he commands, or it’s bye-bye to your pretty friend with the glasses that you’ve been talking to so much.” Draco’s entire body stiffens up, a cold feeling spreading through his very bones.
Draco doesn’t know why he reaches for his mobile that’s next to his bed, and he certainly has no idea what compels him to call Harry at this ungodly hour, but what is perhaps the most shocking thing is that Harry actually answers.
As Draco apprehensively walks down the long corridor leading to the parlour he feels a shiver run up his spine. The fine hairs on his neck stand on end and he has the uneasy feeling that the portraits which line the walls are watching his every move. Draco always found the portraits of his ancestors disturbing, ever since he first wandered along this corridor as a child. They’re all painted with dark colours with a greyish tint on the skin which made them all look deathly ill. One time when he was younger Draco stood in front of the skeletal face of his great-great-great grandmother and he felt as though her eyes moved so that they were always watching him. Ever since that day he had avoided eye contact with any of the paintings, walking briskly down the corridor with his eyes facing down at his swiftly moving feet. Yet even then he could still feel their eyes piercing his skull like daggers, picking at his brain to uncover his darkest secrets. There isn’t much in this world that scares Draco, being a contract killer meant you had to confront any of your fears to avoid weakness. But there’s just something about these sinister paintings which makes his stomach churn and his heart race.
“Love won’t get you anything in life, Draco,” Lucius’ laughter died down and his tone dripped of pure maliciousness with the intent to break the eight year old down so Lucius could remould him in whichever ways he wished. “Your loving mother is waiting back at the house to phone for a driver to take you to an orphanage far away from here. You will have no contact with either of us again and would become another nameless child in the system. You’re too old to be appealing to most families and not childish enough for any others. You’d be left to rot inside the four walls of a single bedroom watching other children come and go until you yourself are kicked out and left with nothing. See your mother and I do love you Draco, you are our heir after all, but love isn’t going to save you from being kicked into the dirt.”
“I’m gonna fuck you so good until you faint once we reached home,” promised Harry and he did just what he said once they’re done paying for their items and walked out of the shop to the car, back home.
and send.
‘ Away from the cry-baby’, said Cassie casually, not looking at Theo, who she knows are looking at her right now.
The lessons end and they were walking to the Great Hall when Harry get a notifications from a groupchat. Draco never bring his phone with him. With Harry hand holding his while his other hand took out his phone beside him.
It was his baby, his body finally let him relax, the healer asked Harry if he wanted to cut the cord, with a big fat ugly tear straining his face, Harry nodded his head furiously and cast a spell to cut the cord.
She knew that she could have done something to find a way. She could have not trusted Dumbledore’s word blindly. Hermione told her that the feeling she was having right now is a survivor’s guilt where thoughts of she should be the one who should die instead of them.
Draco, who can sense his father’s emotion, tugged his wavy black hair lightly and giggled. Moony handed Draco back to him, he cradled him to his chest and whispered softly to his ears, although the whispers is only for Draco, Moony can clearly hear it.
He realized that he should be alone in the empty corridor right now, that no one should be with him. He stared at the figure and with wide eyes, he realized it was Peeves.
Draco was entertaining Jamie by playing with him and his toys scattering on the ground when he felt the first sharp pain on his abdomen but he didn’t give a second thought about it because it will usually come and go but when the second contraction came more painful and stronger than the first, he started to freak out.
Celestial was waiting for her outside and when she stepped out of the shop, she was indulging in a hug, a tight hug, so tight that it suffocates her. “Oh my! Thank you thank you thank you so much, Iris! I love my new hair so much that I just want to scream to let everybody know.”
Draco snickered under his breath, trying to not laugh out loud with Cassie beside him, he might get a scold if she knew which she don’t.
“Are you sure? I don’t want to burden you.”
But happiness can never last forever. On a stormy night a month after Draco’s first birthday, Sirius was hit with bad news that Amelia had died in the hand of two Death Eaters seeking information on the Potters. He and Draco were having father and son bonding time while Amelia was out. She was outnumbered and died on the spot. Before she died, they tortured her with the Cruciatus Curse before using the Killing Curse.
If Harry could compare any worst day he had at work, this would probably be the worst. Everything went wrong today because firstly it took him an hour to find a missing file that contained a lot of important stuff about missions and when he did found it, he forgot about a meeting that he had to attend to discuss with the other aurors since he was the Head Auror. The youngest head auror he might add.
He heard a knock on the door and went to open it, it was Harry. He was wearing a white long sleeve shirt where the sleeves was folded and a black jeans. He was beautiful.
“And I love you more than life itself.”
Bending his body forward, bringing Draco with him as he put the remote back down on the table, already choosing a movie. He picked Draco’s favourite movie, a romance movie called “Pride and Prejudice”.
There was an inscription carved around the top :
Harry came up behind him and hugged him tightly, “It was the shittiest day of fucking life, everything went wrong and it was like the universe was trying to punish me or something”, growled Harry.
They accept that it would probably take a while for Lucius to tolerate their relationship but as long as they got Narcissa’s approval, everything will be alright.
Some even have the courage to ask for a photo but Harry deny their request and Draco had to roll their eyes at them.
“Can I have a pet Kneazle?”
The teachers gave him a look of realization because the word that was spilling out of his mouth was a fact. Severus was looking at with something he couldn’t comprehend. The students in the room was all looking at him including Potter and Weasley. Their reaction was different from others. They looked at him as if they have solve a little bit of ongoing mystery.
From there, he could see that Jamie was curled into a ball, trying to make himself as small as possible until he could disappear. “Jamie, oh my baby,” came Draco scuttering over to him, he turned his body around. “I thought you were asleep, isn’t Papa just putting you to bed?”
He patted Dobby softly on the non-injured area when he was done, he crawled in bed with Dobby and lay beside him. As he laid down, he thinks about the house-elf beside him.
Sirius Black is sitting in front of him, talking animatedly with them while the spouse of Black, and their daughter, adopted daughter who is his cousin, first cousins once removed? Or probably twice, chatting with the older Potters.
Iris agrees to go with her but she didn’t even think of having a haircut until now.
When he stepped inside the meeting room, he realized that his shirt was backward and there’s no time to change. He was so embarrassed that he was hoping for the floor to swallow him right there and then.
They apparate him and Cassie back to the manor, Draco rushed to his room, missing the warm feeling of his bed, he quickly jumped and his whole body landed on the soft material of blanket.
“Okay Harry”, said Draco breathlessly. One clothes turned into two and now he was bare naked from the top of his head and down to his toe.
“Be careful okay, Jamie. Babies are fragile,” said Draco as he stretches his arm over his two sons.
“Only for you, Daddy,” whispered Draco, his grey eyes never stray away from his emerald when he said those four dirty words, biting his lips innocently.
The only reason why he couldn’t is because Father wouldn’t allow him, besides he lived in an urban area where there is no hill, only other mansions stood meters away.
“Yeah whatever, it’s not like you never get jealous because of the adoring fans of mine.”, rolled his eyes as he swirled his fork around and feed the spaghetti into his mouth.
Cassie did twisted his ear when she heard he got a detention for sneaking out, luring McGonagall to Potter but sadly failed so he was in detention because he was out of curfew.
The healer approached him, “Well Mr Black, a congratulation should be necessary. Your wife gave birth to a beautiful and healthy boy, weighing around 3.5 kilogram. You could visits your wife but she is asleep from exhaustion.” He held out his hand for the man to shake it.
String of saliva connected to Draco’s hole as he inspected his handiwork. Draco’s hole was reddish red from the intense sucking. His hole was clenching at nothing.
“The girl’s dormitory is on the left and down the stairs and boys aren’t allowed in the girls dormitory,” said the fifth-year prefect who was named Gemma Farley.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Celestial, we Malfoy do not ramble, where are the lessons I taught you? Are you forgetting now?”
He scolds her behind her back, and from the corner of his eyes, he sees that Weasley and Potter were delighted since he has been bragging a lot about Quidditch in front of them.
Harry inches closer to him as they talk until he asks him again about the phone call from just now. He explained that his driver’s car breaks down in the middle of the road and he can’t do anything but wait. He then expressed that he already felt bad for his driver because for all he knows, he was disrupting Logan’s night.
They were now fighting about duelling, whether or not they should be dueling or just get out of the empty classroom. Until Blaise shushed them all and held out his finger to his mouth.
All of the first-year students followed her to the front of the hall. The hall was drowning with voices of students chattering. Draco looked around the hall, the ceiling was bewitched to look like the sky outside. Draco saw a bushy- haired girl explaining to  Potter and Weasley about the ceiling, Weasley's face was as people could describe as ugly, he grimaced.
“Well it could mean nothing. You remember in fifth year where she dated Nott?”
Someone was trying to break them away but Draco haven’t finish with him, he was still pissed off on him on their first encounter with them so Draco tackled him and land him a hard punch.
They walked out of the common room as quietly as they could on their tippy toes. Walking careful hoping that no students were awake at this god forsaken hour except them.
Harry told him that his sister, Dahlia- who is two years younger than Harry, helped him pick the ring. Well, he knows how to catch people’s hearts. Draco hasn't visited the Potter’s for two weeks now, he’d been busy with his university and working part time as a waiter for his Mother’s restaurant.
He turned his body towards Harry, slipping an arm under Harry’s arm, hugging him and burying his face into Harry’s sturdy chest. Harry slips one of his arms under Draco’s head, substituting it as a pillow.
‘Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.’
It was already eight o'clock at night when they arrived home, Jamie was already sleeping soundly in the car and Harry had to pick him up, change his clothes and lay him down on his soft bed.
“Do you want freedom, Dobby?”
He scoffed at the girl’s behaviour, “I mean kissing an older student would be cool but kissing your sister is even better,” Draco nodded his head along to whatever Blaise was was saying but when he heard that Blaise would like to kiss his sister, he had to draw a line over there.
The Parkinson family was invited, same goes to Blaise and his mother, his mother just got married for the fourth time while Blaise was at Hogwarts. He doesn't even know how the woman did it but it was impressive.
When the boy introduces his name, both Cassie and Draco look at each other and have a silent conversation in their brain. Cassie tilted his head towards Harry and nodded at Draco as she remembered about the conversation between them and their father.
Once his feet touched the ground, his ear was being pulled by Pansy. ‘Jeez Pans, relax.’, knocking off Pansy’s hand from his ears.
He even lost his virginity to Harry when he was twenty one years old. It’s like he can’t hold his innocence anymore when he is around Harry. He had a few boyfriends when he was in school but none of them could compared to his amazing Harry.
‘ I don’t care but  what I do care is who in the bloody hell opens their blabbering mouth?’ I swear if I ever found the person, I’ll cast a tongue-tying curse on them’, said Draco while leaning against the stone cold wall, following Potter’s action. Granger was looking guilty.
Black chatted with him while the rest of the family were giving orders. Not going to lie, Black is actually quite an interesting person, he loves to crack jokes with James Potter while they were talking to him, smiling pleasantly at him.
But she ignored Dobby whenever Draco was having a conversation with Dobby when she was around.
Father didn’t noticed Draco’s changed of mood when he picked him and Cassie up from the King Cross Station since he masked it well but he might think that Mother knows there might be something wrong with him but she didn’t voice it out.
Quirrell open his mouth to speak up but Draco was not finish, ‘ But the horror looked on your face mentioning the troll to Professor Dumbledore several minutes ago didn’t quite made the trick because why can a first year could tackle a troll but not a DADA teacher?’
From afar, four footsteps could be heard, approached him, made him pull out of his deep thoughts, He raised his head and stood up greeting the welcoming visitors. “How many hours have you been waiting?” asked the man near him. The man has light brown hair flecked with gray, though he is still quite young.
Severus was nowhere in the staff table as he was waiting for each and every new welcomers to get sorted. He was not shocked when another Weasley (the girl Weasley) was sorted into Gryffindor.
“I want that to Harry, I want to carry your child, but in order to do that, you fucking have to put your cock in me, fuck me until I can’t stand and have to lay in bed”, said Draco, manipulating him. He knows it’s going to be work because this year, they finally decided to try for a child.
When they finally stepped into the dining room, Draco has already laid the plate on the table before Harry arrives home. He cooked Jamie’s favourite food, spaghetti carbonara because he thought that he was being a good kid today but he had been fooled by his two year-old kid, pretending that he was being a good boy but in the end, his mischief had shown.
‘Yeah go tell her and along the way, ask her why she was concerned by Longbottom’s injury!’, Draco shouts as loud as he can. Pansy and Cassie sometimes act like Mother, they could give a run for their money.
He remembered something about what Father said to them something about the Chamber of Secret. He won’t tell him anything more than necessarily The last and only thing he told him about the chamber is that someone died, a muggleborn to be exact.
Why is he trying to bring back the shameful incident in his face? He had throw the memory away at the very back of his brain and forgotten about it for a very long time, never going to recollect the stupid incident that makes him dislike Potter and his friends.
While they were eating, Draco confessed he kind of had a tiny crush on Harry when they were in secondary school just because he was his senior and he was the captain on the school football team. Harry never noticed him anyways so he just forgot about his crush on him.
Talking about Quidditch, it was the first Quidditch match in this year between Slytherin and Gryffindor, the red colour burned his eyes so he had to looked away from the Gryffindor’s stand.
“Maybe that’s why father hated him.”, he thought to himself as he looked out of the window. His hand was holding his old family photo mother gave him two years ago right after his birthday. His eyes contemplating on the photo, he looked over the detail of his parents, both of them were so happy in this, even he was a happy little baby.
Draco quirked his eyebrow as his hand torn the paper slowly apart, it was a book, An Advance Charms book that he could learn how to cast Disillusionment spell, the book that he had been wanted since he started sneaking out to roam around the castle. A Charm for mischievous like him.
“21? So we are five years apart then,” he added
So, he really can’t even give Jamie full of his attention even with the help of Harry with the twins. Since then, Jamie has been giving them the cold shoulder at him and Harry - mostly at Draco. He sometimes doesn’t want to listen to them, he becomes extremely stubborn than usual.
‘Potter, go take the ingredients while I set up the equipments.’ Potter obeys and walked to the cupboard. Draco set up the cauldron and everything until he felt everything was perfect. When he was done, Potter already came back holding a few ingredients that includes ashwinder eggs, rose thorns, refined peppermind oil and moonstone.
I don't know if I can update monthly but I will try.
By the end of their sex activity, Draco was tired and sweaty. His brain was fried from the intense love making. Harry’s sticky cum are leaking out of his hole and he loves it.
“Daddy -,” shouted Draco in pain but pleasure. Hands pulling Harry by his thigh to fall on top of him. He wanted to be close to his Daddy, through everything.
‘ I think I have found a Slytherin Chaser for you, Professor Snape, Mr Malfoy right here shows great potential’, she beamed while resting his hand on his shoulder and squeeze it. Draco was shocked because he just heard her correctly?
Draco moaned into the kiss and called out Harry’s name. Harry dragged his unoccupied hand inside the sweater, feeling Draco’s smooth skin.
“Okay - okay. No, because why would I be dating anyone when I’m with you right now? Besides, I’m in too deep with someone already.”
“Jamie want thiss - please mama please”, begged Jamie with those cute puppy eyes he usually gave him and Harry whenever he wants something from them which he might say that it’s going to work in a few more minutes if Jamie kept on giving him those eyes.
He locked the door with a loud click and carefully laid them on his king size bed, they were whimpering, mouths trying to find something to suck on, he swiftly took off his shirt and threw it to the side of the room, not caring where it went.
‘I DiNd’t MeAn toO’, Draco mimicking him. ‘yeah right’, Draco scoffed as he crossed his arm together.
‘Relax? You told me to relax? What if Madam Hooch caught you? You would be out of the school!’ Pansy let go of his ear, his ear are red and are in pain, he rubbed his ear to ease the pain away.
“It’s okay, Draco. Dobby is fine, he is going back to work now. Thank you”, thanked Dobby as he raises his injured hands, showing Draco his great work at wrapping the bandage, bowing to both of them and popped out of the room.
As he come to bend his body forward, he felt his husband’s rough hand around his shoulders and lips on his temple.
“- Malfoy,” helping him finish his sentence and looking back down on her magazine. What a weird girl he thought.
Although Mother said no, he still wouldn’t give up, “But Mother, please, I would be out of the manor in a month, please Mother, please,” he begged his Mother, although he knows that Malfoy doesn't beg.
‘Potter! Are you out of your mind? I know you are the Chosen One but this is McGonagall!’ said Draco as he was pulling Harry to walk faster with their interlaced hand.
“I’m sorry - I’m sorry,” apologised Celestial insincerely while clutching her stomach. Iris found nothing amusing about the whole situation.
Harry took a fancy to him right away once he laid his eyes on Draco and after he was accepted into the pack, Harry started courting him traditionally.
Potter’s hard penis rubbed continuously on Draco with Potter still in his trouser but he took care of it by taking them off himself, by the look on Potter’s face, he can tell that Potter was impatient to get himself naked for Draco.
‘No, ask someone else or better ask Blaise, he would do it because he loves attention’, he said looking up from Pansy’s phone and turned his attention back to his food.
I don't know if I like this Chapter or not but I hope you enjoy it. At first I want to write until Draco's sorting ceremony and skip the 1/2/3/4 until the end of 5th year where Sirius fell into the veil and continue on 6th year but I decided that I'm gonna write through the year, so this fic might take a while, but let me know what you think about it because your comments brings me comfort, so yeah love you guys and thank you for reading. And one more think, I'm gonna post the 4 chapter in two or three weeks from now because I haven't finish the 5th, sorry for the inconvenience.
“What has Dahlia been up to?” asked Draco about his favourite family member of Harry’s. He and Dahlia get on quite well when Draco and Harry started dating, she's a part time youtuber who would post videos in her free time.
‘Ah Finally, Mr Potter has bless us with his present followed by Mr Malfoy’, informed McGonagall to the class in her sarcastic tone.
He bounced down to the couch, weirdly he looked around, trying to find Jamie, that’s when he realised that it was his bed time, “Did Jamie already go to sleep?”
*********
There was an uproar from all of houses including Slytherin, what a shame. Pansy was shrieking besides him but she turned to Blaise and him to ask.
Before Potter get the chance to speak, Slughorn clapped his hand to mark the end of the lesson. Draco packed his bag quickly as Slughorn’s voice rang through his ears, ‘Before you leave, please write a two rolls of parchment of the Amortentia and hand in before the next lesson. Thank you and you may leave the class now’, said Slughron as he walked to the front of the classroom.
‘Truth’, he answered.
“Draco, Come! I have business elsewhere after this, I do not want to waste more of my time today”, called father. He place his hand back down and walked away from the odd cabinet.
One night, he sneaked inside the Restricted Section in the library since he couldn’t find anywhere about the dog. Peeves had to snooped in while he was looking attentively for a book about mythical creature. He quickly dived down under a table and had to hold his breath until Peeves floated away and since then he had been finding a way for Peeves to be on his side.
When he took his eyes off and looked around the hall, they were looking at him interest. How many minutes have passed? He hopes it’s not too long because he doesn’t want to be in a center of attention.
They were carried along a dark tunnel, until they reached a kind of underground harbour, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. Then they clambered up a passageway.
Crabbe and Goyle both let out a snort. He looked up and saw Weasley face was red with anger. Before Weasley could answer his comment, Professor Flitwick appeared at his elbow.
Jamie was hugging him tightly, not wanting to let him go, hiding his face on his chest. He rubbed his son’s back, waiting for the right moment to ask him.
Hands quickly reach out for her unfinished assignment to pack up. To find her, maybe asking if she - no she can’t. It would seem rude to just ask for her sexuality out of nowhere. She thought of ways of bringing the subject up, she didn’t register that her feet had brought her to the eighth year common room until Ron slapped her in the back, asking if she knew where Hermione was.
When he’s outside, Regulus already transforms into his wolf form. His black fur, identical to Harry, swayed following the direction of the wind. It was sunny, sun perched in the sky, a good time to start the day. Regulus is only a wolf cub in his wolf form and not trying to be biased, Regulus is the most adorable cub ever.
hehehehe do you think Draco going to end up his dad's house or what?
“Yes, love. I’m helping you cross one of your bucket lists.” said Harry as he was checking his pocket with one hand by patting it and holding the picnic basket with another hand.
“Hey - hey - stop. Don’t think badly about it. We might have a problem in the future. Every relationship has their ups and down but I promise you one thing. I won’t ever leave you in the dark. If we have a problem, we solve it as soon as we can or try to.”
Regulus is running and jumping around trying to catch a blue butterfly that was teasing him and when he failed, he grumbled and went back to Draco, nose nudging him to transform into his wolf form.
“You know what I mean prat. Do you have any girl in mind?”, asked Draco again, his eyes still on Potter, right now Potter got the full set of their school books shove at him but he decided to give girl Weasley, he can see that she is blushing while looking at Potter in a certain type of way.
“You mean first official kiss? Because I got a lot of kisses since I was a toddler but I can’t remember,” smirked Blaise. Draco had to roll his eyes at his friend’s cocky behaviour.
And anyways you will enjoy this Draco's behaviour until 3rd year
Weasley was about to protest when Draco raised his hand as if to stop him from speaking and when he heard no word come out from his mouth, he continues.
At last, he finally spoke, “ Remus, I- I- can't be James and Lily's secret keepers, there will be too many trouble, The Death Eater killed my wife for it, I - I- just can't, I'm sorry,” he was stuttering while wiped the tears off his face.
That was one of the reason why he named Regulus James after his late uncle. Eight years after he ran away from the pack, a war between the two powerful packs arises again, it’s been going on even before Harry was even born. Harry avenging his parent’s death and the old Riddle’s pack molded into the Potter’s. History has been made and the Riddle’s pack name is erased from the history.
He jumped at Harry and both of them stumbled down onto the soft ground, Draco might have jumped on him too hard out of excitement but at least Harry was still holding on tightly to the ring box.
He knows that Blaise can be too protective over his friends so he quickly stood up and took his hand, dragged him away before Blaise got the chance to make a scene. That is the last thing he needs for the first day of school.
The eyes that shows he was truly sorry about leaving scar on him. With determination, Potter attacked his lips, deepening the kiss as his tongue was in Draco’s within seconds.
Pansy went to get her phone in thrilled that she started clapping her hand after she was satisfied with the end result. The crowd all clapped their hands for their performances.
He held Draco for the last time and looked down at his angelic face, the baby that was made by love, a love between two merely powerful pureblood family names, his intelligent baby.
‘ STUPEFY’, as he pointed his wand at the troll, He thanked Merlin because it work. Once the spell hit the troll, he fell to the ground with a loud thunk.
“Well that depends.”
Harry opens his mouth to protest but Ron shushes him quickly, “I don’t want you to look like a greasy rat for your hot coffee date.” If it were anyone other than Ron Harry would have been insulted at the comment but he doesn’t deny that his hair is starting to clump together and the bags under his eyes are getting darker every day. One early night couldn’t hurt, plus he doesn’t want Draco to think that he’s anymore of a mess than he already is. He does have some pride after all.
A/N: It’s pretty obvious that I know nothing about guns so just go with it pls… tysm H for being my betaaaa
“That’s understandable,” Harry nods, “So freelance work? Doing what?”
So there was going to be another section to this but it ended up being over 10'000 words so I've split this up into part one and part two :)
After Ron leaves Harry buries himself in the stack of papers and quickly loses himself in the crisp black ink. His green eyes flit from one word to the next, making connections between names, dates, facts and places which even he can’t explain. It’s like a gut instinct and whilst a level of professional cynicism is required in his job, he’s never been wrong before. Yet even with his skilled level of analysis and ability to read between the lines he’s still struggling to think of a major factor which links everything all together. The murders all jump from one extreme to the other and even though there are serial killers Harry has read about in the past who are random and have no clear pattern, nothing is to this extent. The cold and meticulous killers who clean up the scene perfectly and could undoubtedly stage a suicide with their eyes closed are nothing like the ones who thrive in the thrill of being chased and antagonising the law enforcement. Of course it could be two or more individuals but there still has to be a link between them all otherwise the similarities just don’t make sense. Harry sighs quietly as he takes off his glasses to wipe them, as though the clarity of the glasses is the problem and not the fact that he’s completely lost. He’s hit walls in cases before but even then he could see a way around it, yet now he’s like a blind man and the wall is never ending. It's disheartening and Harry can’t help but feel completely useless, something that he never wanted to experience in his adult life. A quick glance at the clock tells him that it's just past 9 and he decides to just pack up and go home early for just once in his life. He’s much more tired than he previously thought, plus it’d save Ginny coming up later; the stairs from Behavioural Sciences to the Analysis department are horrific to climb.
“What are we doing out here, Father?” Draco had become increasingly more afraid of what was going to happen as Lucius looked at him pointedly before he averted his gaze across the fields.
“Wait outside, Draco.” Those were the first words Voldemort had spoken to Draco and Draco was more than happy to oblige. He tried to be subtle in his desperation to leave the room but he still practically ran to the door and let out a sigh of relief when he entered the hallway. He slumped down to the floor next to the doorframe and blocked out the sound of the men talking in the room next to him. In all that had happened in this one day he had almost forgotten about the coffee date (if you could call it a date) he had with Harry the next morning. Or it could be today, Draco had lost track of time after a while. He had just wanted a simple kill; it should have been so easy-- but no, of course his father had to make a mistake which would royally mess Draco around. His eyes were heavy with fatigue and he hoped Voldemort would just hurry up and shoot the man so Draco could go to bed. It was still a long walk back to his house and he was certainly not asking for a lift from the Death Eaters.
“Fine,” Harry rolled his eyes after a moment of deliberation, “I’ll try with him, I said I’d go get a coffee with him tomorrow morning anyway.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve thought about it,” Draco says truthfully, “And I would like to see them in better hands than mine, but Father would not appreciate it and I don’t want to disrespect his wishes.”
“Not particularly,” Draco sneered, “I’d rather just shoot you right now and be done with it.”
“Questions, questions,” Bellatrix tuts at him like he’s a small child again, “This isn’t the loving welcome I expected after all these years.”
His parent’s nurse Jean comes over at around noon to check up on their vitals, and Draco stands awkwardly in the doorframe watching the frail old woman fiddling with the tubes and wires around his parents’ beds. They look so small and fragile in their white hospital gowns that Draco struggles to see them as the people he was once so afraid of. Even though Mother had never been as intimidating as Father, Draco still feared disappointing her as when he did, she would look at him with a look which told him that she didn’t think he was worthy of the Malfoy name. A look that hadn’t been in her eyes for a long time now. Jean finishes sorting out the senior Malfoys and turns to Draco, smiling wearily at him. As she begins to carry her medical bag out of the room, Draco stops her suddenly, the impulsive need to do something selfless taking over his usual thought process.
“I think everyone knows what it’s like to carve their own path in life,” Harry says thoughtfully, My parents died when I was a baby, so I never had them telling me what kind of man I should be. I lived with my aunt, uncle, and cousin until I was seventeen, but we weren’t close so they never really tried to make me like them. Honestly, I think they’re happier pretending I wasn’t around. I believe that family is something you find, and I haven’t found mine yet.” Draco’s eyes remain transfixed on Harry and a flicker of understanding dances across them.
“Alright,” Ron nodded slowly, “I’m starting to get where you’re coming from. So the gangs weren’t targeting each other, they were targeting this Dirk guy? But why? Was he too harsh on the rent or something? Or was he one of the landlords who demands ‘favours’? Maybe the locals got tired of his shit and organised a protest against all his properties?”
“You are an unusual one Potter,” Draco leans forward slightly, “I’d love to know how you think.”
“W-what’s that for, Father?” His voice trembled and he had struggled to see clearly as his eyes welled up with tears. Draco had had an idea of what the gun was for but in the innocent eyes of an eight year old he didn’t think his father would hurt anything. Lucius rolled his eyes in exasperation as he roughly shoved the gun towards Draco. Draco had violently jerked away but one glance at Lucius showed that the older man’s patience had worn thin. Draco held out his small, shaking hand and took the gun. He remembered how heavy it felt in his hand and how he felt shocked but also completely mesmerised by the cold and lethal object in his hands. Yet when he had heard his father cough impatiently the reality of the situation came crashing down and Draco had looked up at his father with wide, fearful eyes.
The emotions going through Draco’s mind had increased beyond anything he had ever felt and he began to hyperventilate. His mind couldn't comprehend what was happening; he had only just gotten Midnight-- why was his father trying to take him away from him? What did Midnight do wrong? Why does he have to shoot his friend? Is this all a trick? Is he dreaming? What would his father do if he said no? As Draco became more and more confused and panicked Lucius huffed in frustration. He dragged the oblivious puppy by its collar and had planted it firmly in front of Draco, telling it to stay. Despite just being a puppy Midnight stayed in the same spot, eagerly looking at Draco as though they were about to play a game.
At Lucius’ words the young boy began to cry vehemently. His knees buckled so that he was bent over and his back shook with each sob and his breathing became choked. The small dog had sensed the boy’s distress and looked up at it’s owner with wide, dark eyes, which just made Draco’s heart hurt even more. When Draco had finally looked up with clouded eyes he could barely see the man he called father through the clouds of his own anguish. “W-Why are you saying this?” the child had barely choked out, “what have I done wrong?”
I weren’t round ‘ere at the time, off in Europe tryna sort out apprenticeships with this big car company. Clearly didn’t make no difference since am still ‘ere in this goddamn house. Thought yer daddy was gone come hunt me down with a pitchfork when I got back an’ found their bodies, but he never did an’ am guessin’ he never told Voldemort since him an’ his Death Eaters ain’t ever come lookin’ for me. One good thing that blonde bastard ever did for ma family.
A week later, The Daily Prophet published news about Sirius Black murdering twelve innocent Muggles with a single curse. He killed Peter Pettigrew and was only left with his right index finger on the street, found by the Auros once Sirius Black got captured as he was laughing like a maniac, surrounded by a bunch of Aurors. Sirius Black was thrown into Azkaban without a trial and he is known to the Wizarding World as a traitor.
“Don’t joke like that, Malfoy!”, shouted Longbottom as Draco watched his face drained. He was going to have so much fun and he did captured everything with the camera. He zoomed his camera onto Longbottom frightening expression.
He has another question about the music, should the music should be melodious or horrible? Well it was not his problem since he knew that the reckless trio are going to do something about it because they loves to stick their nose into somebody else’s business, not him though because he was a Slytherin.
“It proved nothing too! You are too complicated! Why don’t you just go and ask her yourself then. I’m trying to prove my point without you denying it.”
“Goodnight, baby.”
“I think the only supplies left is the Gilderoy Lockhart’s books.”, answered Cassie as she was checking the school lists twice before confirming it to mother. Mother nodded her head and told them to go first, she and father both have some business they need to settle for.
Lucius was sitting there, looking smug that his wife won’t approve of their relationship anytime soon but those expressions soon fell.
Draco murmured his thanks as he scrunched his face in pain, holding his abdomen with his other hand, he flicked his wand and cast the Patronus charm, a dragon came bursting out of his hand, flying as it flapped its big wings around him.
Dobby was independent, he wants to see the world and Draco like that about him.
Father on the other hand, spend most of his time in his study room, he spent his time in the manor a lot longer than before and Draco had a bad feeling that this had to do something with father.
Daphne walked towards the hat and sat on the stool, she acted calming but he can tell that she was nervous because her fingers were twiddling.
“What can I say, he’s obviously my son”, smirked Harry as he wandlessly use a cleaning charm on himself.
They stay for a while until the Mediwitch told them visiting hours are almost done, they bid them goodbyes before they ask Jamie if they want to stay at their house, Jamie shakes his head, declining their offers saying that he want to say with Mama and the babies, Harry told him that the bed won’t be comfortable and Jamie didn’t even care and he was going to throw a tantrum if his papa ask him one more question.
Mya complimented Celestial after inspecting her blonde hair and told her that her hair colour is easier to dye than the one having darker coloured hair. She doesn’t need to bleach her hair since her hair is the whitest of them all.
Draco’s hand are itchy to touch him the longer he look at his husband, sometimes he wonder how he could land himself an attractive husband who loves him as much as he loves Harry. Nothing could stop him anyways so he decided to stroke his Harry’s cheek, Harry melts into it and rubbed himself on Draco’s hand.
‘I guess I can’t use Potter against you now’, she huffed, crossing her arms.
The manor was big enough that it provided a room (a resting room) for them. Draco sneaked inside the room sometimes without the knowledge of Lucius Malfoy, of course to hang out with the house-elves.
They stopped in front of the lift, Harry pressed the lift button and both of them waited. They stood as close as they could and talk as quietly to not disturb anyone in the lobby, with hand still clasp with each other.
“Just go get Hagrid”, said Potter as he screamed louder. He was so against that idea, what if Potter died, will he be the caused?
“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Mr Borgin”, said father. Coldly and Mr Borgin said quickly, “No offence, sir, no offence meant-”
People were looking at him with surprise, he too saw some enviousness in some of the girl’s eyes. When he turned his head to look at his boyfriend, Harry was gawking at him with open mouth, eyes filled with lust.
Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw that most boys are drooling especially his boyfriend.
“Whatever you said Longbottom.” he screamed back as he cupped one hand over his mouth since he was holding his camera.
He didn’t know how he did it but he appreciated it but he still has a mission to whack Harry on the head.
Finally he had solved it, when he realised that the inscription was spelled backward as he read it, he sobbed lightly.
Exam week has taken a toll on him. He spent most of his time in the library memorising law sections and cases. His head has been buried in books researching and making notes. It’s been a week since he last saw his boyfriend who is taking a degree in criminal justice so that he could get a career in law enforcement.
“The feeling’s mutual.” Hermione smiles back and opens her mouth to speak but is cut off by the door opening once again. Harry glances over and sees the youngest Weasley sibling looking at the two of them with an air of suspicion.
“You shouldn’t have given it a name,” Lucius had snarled in Draco’s ear, “It just makes it complicated. Now shoot the fucking dog or I swear on the grave of my father that you’ll live the rest of your life alone with all the other unwanted children.”
“I-I’m not sure,” Harry leant back in his chair and sighed, “ just don’t know how to approach this whole thing? I don’t even know what this is, I don’t do stuff like this. I mean you already know that but yeah, I just don’t know what to do. Plus it’s distracting me from the case and I feel like I should just focus on trying to find a link instead of-“
“Took you long enough.” Draco whirls around and points his gun at a woman he knows all too well.
“Hurry up Draco,” Voldemort began to sound annoyed, “Just shoot him already.”
“I suppose we do.” Draco leans back and becomes wrapped up in his own thoughts. Harry takes the comfortable silence to sip his drink and observe how Draco is sat. His body language is far more open than it had been in the pub, he has his legs spread slightly and is absentmindedly stirring a spoon in his coffee. Yet an element of control remains in his hand movement, the spoon moving in perfect circles and in the same place each time. His grey eyes remain fixed on the cup, but Harry doesn’t feel like Draco is being rude at all. In fact, Harry is truly fascinated by the man before him. Draco is both an open book and a mystery, both cocky yet modest, controlled yet chaotic. He’s a riddle wrapped in an enigma, and Harry can’t wait to break the walls down and see what lies beneath.
“So what do you think? A gang?”
“Of course I know who Voldemort is, I’m not an idiot.” Draco snapped.
“I know,” the man stands up abruptly and Draco instantly lifts the gun, “Woah kiddo am jus’ puttin’ ma bowl in the sink no need to go all ape shit. An’ I respect that yer not gonna let me leave, don’t want yer daddy’s mistake fuckin’ up yer life anymore. So ere’s what yer gonna do. Yer gonna contact Voldemort right now an’ tell him that if he wants to tie up some loose ends he better get his ugly ass down here and sort it out himself.”
“So be it,” She says, “But you’ll regret this when your friend ends up butchered while he sleeps. Mulciber here,” he gestures at the body on the floor with her blood-stained knife, “Was once one of the Dark Lord’s closest followers. And even that didn’t protect him. Just think about that, Draco, and decide if you care more for your pretty boy toy or your own morals.”
“Less than three months,” The man shrugged nonchalantly, “By the time doctors caught it it’d spread too much. Ya called me a dead man before, bet ya didn’t know how right ya were. Code for detonating the bombs on fridge, look its right ‘ere. Yer a good kid, get outta this business while ya can.”
The healer told him that his baby’s head was already out, few more pushes then he can welcome their third child into the world. He gave all he might and pushed out their third child into the world, he sagged in relief when he heard the sound of their third child wailing.
He lifts his head, Harry does the same and they meet in between and give a chaste kiss before Jamie gets to push them apart because he’s a jealous boy who wanted his mama for himself.
“I told you to leave him alone, Draco.”, shouted Cassie from a far, she was still trying to fight her way over to him sadly, the crowd won’t allow. “If I get my hands on you, you will surely die, Draco. Die- I mean in, in the best possible-,” her sentence got cut off, her eyes are wide open, Draco looked at her in confusion while at the same time, Mr Weasley was struggling with the twins Weasley.
He smirked at her, showing off, ‘That’s what you get when you wasting your time in the library’.
One could say that they are confused as fuck.
“Yes I know Rissa, it’s like birthing a demon’s spawn, you’ve been spitting the accusation since we started dating,” he finished her sentence.
“Yeah, I’m alright. Are you alright, Draco?”, asked Harry as he bumped his shoulders with him, he was still thinking what does the centaur mean.
