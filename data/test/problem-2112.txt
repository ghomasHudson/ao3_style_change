Draco's lips twitched as he tried to hold back a grimace of distaste. He was still deciding whether Pansy was complimenting him or not, when he spotted Justin Finch-Fletchley. He wandered the room in a three-piece suit, handsome in black and white, and so obviously Muggle-born, he should have stood out. Except that after the War, after the trials and the reforms, the debutante balls had opened up to anyone who wished to attend and could afford the fees. And Finch-Fletchley, Muggle-born though he may be, came from wealth and good breeding, and much as Draco was loath to admit it, Finch-Fletchley was his greatest competitor.
"Why is it so loud?" he asks, trying his best to move past his second failed attempt at declaring his love to Draco.
When he goes down, Draco's standing by the stove near the window, his back to Harry. This side of the flat has a partial view out to a small park and Harry watches from the doorway as the light hits Draco. It brings out the golden hue to Draco's hair, bright and warm.
Draco shuddered, thinking of his own mother and the list of potential husbands she'd handed to him before escorting him into the ballroom that night. He kept his eyes away from the left side of the ballroom, knowing perfectly well that his mother was there conversing with other mothers. She'd be working him into conversation, trying to gauge his chances with the son of whatever unfortunate woman happened to be in her way. The other mothers would be doing the same for their children, and he could imagine the vicious mob that would form once Potter arrived.
Harry looks at them, at Ron's sympathetic expression and at Hermione, who looks as though she has many things to say and is keeping quiet out of friendly respect. Harry considers how they'd react if he told them about the time in the bedroom, thinks,
When he got to the fountain, he stopped, listening to the cascading water as it hit the marble. He went to it, wanting to feel the spray on his face, to touch the water and perhaps calm the burning in his chest. He didn't understand what was happening, or why he suddenly wanted to run and keep going until he couldn't hear the music from Bulstrode Manor, until he might outrun Gregory and his smiling face. He leaned against the fountain, his right hand coming down hard on the marble. He heard the click of the ring against the stone, the sound loud in the mostly silent night. It echoed in his ears, a reminder of the decision he'd just taken.
Draco let the silence hang, a heavy meaningful weight between them as Harry noticed again how insignificant the distance between them was. Harry was rich and well-connected but he wasn't pureblood. Draco wasn't talking about him, but he watched Harry as though he might mean him. As though Harry should want Draco to mean him.
They'd almost completed a second lap of the lake before Harry broke the silence. "I'm sorry about last night," he said. "I got caught up in things I shouldn't have."
Harry takes a deep breath and waits, eyes on the movie. He watches Mark go through his poster board signs, listens to Draco's quiet breathing. He has to get through this before he can look at Draco because he knows once he does, there's no way Harry's going to finish his speech.
They get to Harry's flat and Draco's already throwing their cloaks onto the living room sofa. He reaches out to take the cake box from Harry and tosses that onto the coffee table.
Pansy was wearing a silver robe from Madame Malkin's over pink, half-finished dress robes. Her hair was pushed away from her face by many tiny silver hairpins. She took one look at Draco and her mask of indifference fell to reveal a flash of anger.
"We didn't really get to enjoy dessert last time," he says. "I thought it might be something you'd enjoy. Especially because you have mentioned that you like romantic gestures every once in a while."
They look good together is what it means, mismatched but complimenting heights, Harry in hues of brown and black, Draco, blond and grey-eyed. Both of them polished and pristine, recognisable for contrasting reasons that they've done their best to leave behind. They help each other, a nice back and forth that's easy and comforting.
He couldn't avoid the Manor itself, not if he wanted his and Draco's courting to be believable and so, after buying a particularly expensive bouquet of flowers, he Apparated to just down the road from Malfoy Manor.
He'd been content, wasting away his time, until Ron's letter arrived. Until Ron asked him to come back. Until Harry listened because, for the first time in five years, he'd been curious. Because by the time Ron asked him to go back, the two truths of his life had already grown roots within him, and he'd known without a doubt that nothing and no one would be able to shake his convictions.
"It was a mille-feuille, Harry," Draco says. "Pansy was appalled and Mother had very strong words with me afterwards."
The sudden green light revealed the small enclosure, a shimmering bubble underneath a canopy of trees. The light from Draco's wand seemed to bend around them, distorting the trees and the path outside, as though Harry was looking through water. Above his head, he could just make out the dark sky with its smattering of stars, the bright points standing out in sharp relief through the distortion. There was only enough space in the bubble for Harry and Draco, and so when Harry finally focused, he realised that Draco was within touching distance.
"A little trick I picked up from my mother," Draco had told Harry the first time they'd gone shopping together.
They finally figure out the Azkaban situation at the beginning of October. Harry does a lot of running around trying to get departments to give up staff and Hermione and Ron do the same. In the end, they manage to scrape together enough people so that there's no need to ever consider the Dementors again. Bartholomew puts up a fight, and Harry has to remind himself that an outright duel with the man would just unnecessarily postpone the third meeting from hell.
Draco looked down at his outfit, the sparkling gold chains that adorned his neck and hung in ringlets down the arms of his dress robes. All the golden fabric was sewn with gold thread and everything on him that could be made from real gold was. It was over the top and loud but he had come to Parkinson Manor with one goal in mind and he didn't see any reason to pretend otherwise.
He types in "how to tell someone you love them" into the search bar and goes through three different websites with advice that ranges from,
Draco cleared his throat. "Potter, you do understand that great-great-grandfather Malfoy himself will rise from his grave long before a Weasley thinks to marry me," he said.
The man was fit, dressed over-the-top but attractive, and as Harry started to point him out to Ron, the man turned and Harry saw that it was none other than Draco Malfoy. The white blond hair registered at once, the obvious display of wealth as Draco basically dripped with gold. He looked a hundred times better than he had at the trials, well-rested and groomed to perfection. Everything from his demeanour to the way he surveyed the room spoke to an ease that Harry envied.
He glanced at Harry, weighing the companionable distance between them and the way he had Harry's undivided attention. It was the most Harry had acknowledged anyone since he'd gotten to Parkinson Manor and everyone around them knew it.
Draco had his suitor. Harry had avoided all but the most persistent and shameless of mothers. It seemed like the right time to step away, especially if Blaise Zabini was throwing his hat into the ring for Draco's hand. But even as he thought that, he couldn't help the pang of disappointment that settled in the centre of his chest.
She curtsied and he bowed, taking her hand as they straightened and placing a kiss on the back of her gloved hand.
"Ask me whatever you want," Harry says, watching as Draco slides open the phone screen over and over. "Today we can look at all the Muggle technology you want and I'll answer all your questions."
He dragged a hand through his hair in exasperation, pulling so hard on the strands, Draco knew it must hurt.
"Nothing," Harry said, too quickly. He spotted the unimpressed look on Draco's face and winced. "I don't mean to sound…"
"I know you don't want to marry," Draco said. "But I do. I was made for the debutante balls, Potter, but here I am, looking as I do and not a suitor in sight."
Draco touched himself without thinking, sliding his hand down his pants until he got a hold of his cock. He imagined Harry whispering in his ear, those same words he'd whispered earlier. He'd talked about fucking, about the warmth of a body below him.
He barely paid attention to the group of mothers huddling under Elise Abbott's favourite tree. All Harry could think of was Draco's gloved hand on his skin, the way the leather would feel against the inside of his arm. He eyed the sleeves of his shirt and in two quick jerks, he'd pulled out the cufflinks at his wrists. He rolled his sleeves up his arms and held his arm back out towards Draco.
They'd made it around to the side where Elise Abbott was standing, her wand out as she transfigured her fan into a picnic blanket. She waved at Draco, her smile mechanical as she complimented Harry on his cloak.
"It must be their most popular bouquet, then," Draco said, motioning to the spot next to him on the couch. "Elegant and expensive."
The slight blush to Gregory's cheek was endearing, as was the way he leaned down to kiss the back of Draco's hand. He entwined their arms and pulled Draco close, confident and sure, as he led the way to the dance floor. Gregory's hands were strong and proper as he led the dance, never straying further than what society had dictated appropriate. He never stepped close enough for Draco to feel his breath, never took his coat off so that the only thing between them was the flimsy material of Draco's gloves. Not once did Gregory look at Draco's mouth as though he wanted nothing more than to consume him.
He was still smiling, looking at ease in Draco's sitting room, his back against the couch, legs crossed as his gaze wandered around the room. Draco watched him as Harry took in the rest of the bouquets, lingering on the slope of Harry's shoulder, the way his red jacket fit perfectly over his dark shirt. He wore sensible shoes, polished and worn but not excessively so. He sat on Draco's couch with his bouquet in honour of Draco's outfit from the night before, an expected gift that Harry had managed to make both intimate and droll. It was flattering and charming, and presented with Harry's smile and his twinkling green eyes, it would have been more than enough to win Draco over. If they were really courting.
"I've always known our world was filled with its fair share of idiots," Draco said. "But I never imagined it was this bad."
How to explain it, Harry thought. What words existed to describe the horror of living with the Dursleys, of the years where he was told he was less than nothing. How could he ever explain what it was like to finally mean something, to be someone, to have value outside of how fast he could cook bacon or how hard he could scrub a toilet. He'd given himself away to the first person who'd been kind to him and he'd still been left all alone in the end. He'd always been what others needed, first with the Dursleys, then with Dumbledore, and finally, with the entire Wizarding World. Becoming a person, becoming a fully-fledged human being outside of what others needed had been one of the most painful things he'd ever had to endure. And after all the pain he'd gone through, after all the nightmares, he was never again going to let anyone tell him who he should be.
Mrs Abbott didn't even acknowledge him and a moment later, Ron was gone, disappearing into the crowd. Harry watched him go with a sinking suspicion that he'd been abandoned with intent. He turned back to Elise Abbott and her daughter, and found that while he'd been distracted, the group around him had gotten bigger. He could see Pansy Parkinson towards the back of the crowd, standing next to a young man who shared the shape of her nose. Among the heads of this new crowd, Harry could pick out a few faces, though the knowledge that he knew some of these people did nothing to take the edge off the dread that was building in his stomach.
"I wrote you a poem," Harry says, knowing that if he stops, he's going to start feeling the nerves and it's important that he gets this right. "Actually, I may have stolen it from Ginny. She wrote me something similar in Second Year. I asked and she said it was all right for me to use it. Oh, I also may have told Ginny...well, that's not important. The point is, I'd like to read you a poem and then tell you something so, just stand there for a bit."
"I don't know," Harry says, packing up his quills and the parchment with his notes. "How do you feel about curry?"
"Sit," Harry says, remembering number ten on the list—doing things for them—and taking Draco's cloak. "Why don't you start reading the Sidekick handbook and I'll order takeout."
There were too many people for Draco to say anything else, too much that he'd never be able to say. There was an agreement between them, a nice buffered distance that meant that Draco had to push down the wild beating of his heart as he turned back to the path.
"Listen," she says, "All of this is much simpler than you're making it out to be. Just go home, find Draco, and tell him."
He inhales, lets himself really feel the way his heart is thumping. He thinks of mornings with Draco, of the way Draco had laughed at The Pheasant, how everyone in any room always has eyes for both of them, for how they fit together. Harry likes knowing that he and Draco make a good match, that they complement each other, because it means that he and Draco fit. And for a long time, Harry hadn't thought that was possible.
Alice took that moment to step forward. She didn't say anything but Draco took the obvious out and asked her to dance. Afterwards, when he'd escorted Alice back to her mother and had made his excuses, he thought back to that afternoon and the necklace currently sitting in his pocket. He'd taken it off because he hadn't wanted Elise Abbott's comments about his obvious favouritism to someone who wasn't Harry.
He stood next to Mrs Weasley, his arms crossed as he looked brazenly back at Draco. He didn't even try to pretend he hadn't been watching Draco and Gregory. He simply refused to back down, his mouth a thin line as he dug his fingers into the muscle of his arms.
And because the Wizarding World expected him to settle down with a nice witch, he'd gone out of his way to bed anyone willing, to ruin his reputation as a good match. It hadn't mattered who it was or what they looked like. If they were Muggle, it was even better. The only thing that had mattered back then was that when he had a warm body beneath him or above him, he wasn't thinking about his duty. He got lost in the pleasure of simply living to live, of fulfilling his needs when they surfaced, uncaring of propriety and expectations.
It involves, among other things, Draco Malfoy, the poshest restaurant in wizarding Britain, a chocolate and raspberry mousse cake, and a declaration of love stencilled over the top in powdered sugar. But, Harry supposes, that might be getting ahead of himself.
Draco paused to gesture at himself and their surroundings. Harry followed his hands, the length of his fingers. He told himself that he was looking only because Draco had allowed it, because it was required in his understanding of the situation. He had to know how the fabric of Draco's dress robes hung on his shoulders, had to understand the shape of Draco's nose and the attractive ruffle of his hair. Looking wasn't hurting anyone after all, and so long as no one caught them in the garden together, there was no harm done.
His suggestive tone of voice caught Draco's attention, and when he glanced back at Harry, he was sitting sideways, one leg folded on the couch, his arm thrown along the back as he leaned in close to Draco. If Draco turned, their legs would touch. If he stretched his own arm across the back of the couch, their fingers might meet. He might feel the knuckles along the back of Harry's hand, the heat of his palm, might feel those fingers along his wrist, sure and strong as Harry took his hand.
"Draco, what are you talking about?" Harry asks, throwing his hands up. "That's not what I'm saying. I just want to make sure you're happy."
In the end, he just shrugs helplessly at Draco. "I just didn't want to assume that you'd want to spend all your time with me," Harry says.
Breakfast was a silent affair after that, Draco doing his best to swallow past the burning in his throat while his mother chatted about Zabini's dinner the following week. Harry showed up as soon as breakfast was over. Draco was tempted to deny him entry, but his mother opened the door and Draco wasn't strong enough to fight his mother when she got an idea into her head. And that was how he ended up at the park near the Manor. Harry had presented Narcissa with a beautifully wrapped parcel. She'd taken one look at all the bright green ribbon and had said yes before Harry had even finished asking for permission to take a walk with Draco.
, before September hit, and Draco had forgotten the name of the best man who declares his love for his best friend's wife.
He'd held on until he didn't know how to do anything else. And when he finally looked at what he'd built, he found nothing. He hadn't known who he was without Ron and Hermione, without the Weasleys. He'd been about to ask Ginny to marry him when he opened his eyes and was unable to recognize the man in the mirror.
He meant to walk away. That's what he told himself after. He meant to take one last look at Harry's face, at his mouth, at his vibrant green eyes that seemed huge in the shadows. But he took a step closer and Harry stopped running away. He watched as Draco closed the distance between them, his hands balled into fists at his sides. It seemed almost as though Harry was shaking with need, but that was impossible because Harry didn't want anything to do with him. Harry had been the one who pushed and pushed until Draco was left shaking with unfulfilled desire, and when Draco had been ready to push back, Harry had simply walked away. So it wasn't fair that he looked like that. It wasn't fair that he asked Draco to stop when Harry had never stopped before. Not when he wanted Draco as much as Draco wanted him.
Draco nods as he helps Harry put his things in his satchel. "Yes, well, we might already have one," he says.
He looked around at the large arrangements of flowers, each bunch more colourful than the last, their curling ribbons and bright green leaves. He inhaled and the thick heady perfume of flowers washed over him. He could start a greenhouse with the number of flowers he'd received both in person and by owl. It was almost enough to get to his head, impossible to push away that satisfaction that settled in his chest as he looked around the room. He'd had one or two suitors that fit his guidelines for a husband, a Greengrass cousin who had his own Manor in France and Yaxley, of course. Though, Draco had heard unpleasant things about Yaxley and he wasn't inclined to let that particular acquaintance go further. Still, that left the Greengrass cousin who said he'd be back tomorrow.
Harry grinned. "A pleasure as always, Malfoy," he said, eyeing Draco up and down more purposefully, his gaze landing on the chain at Draco's neck. "I'd ask where all the gold in Gringotts had gone, but I can see for myself."
He caught himself on the last thought, horrified at the way he was already making arrangements in his head for his move back to London. He thought of Draco again, of the stories that had run daily after the War, about how if anyone had any experience with dealing with the press, it was Draco. Perhaps Harry wasn't introducing him to anything new. Perhaps it was better that it was Draco, who knew what it was like to be branded one way by the press and to be left with no room for change or growth. Perhaps, a voice in the back of Harry's head told him, perhaps it might be possible to marry Draco and be happy.
At first, he'd found the cottage in the countryside and refused to use his magic out of spite. He'd purposefully kept his location a secret and had asked Hermione to help him with the spells to keep owls from finding him. He'd given Ron, and only Ron, the last shard of the two-way mirrors Sirius had once gifted him. Then he'd made Ron and Hermione promise not to tell anyone where they might find him.
It couldn't have been more perfect, Draco thought, as he watched Harry march across the room to stand in front of his mother. She kept looking between Draco and the roses in Harry's hand, as though she couldn't quite work out what the catch was. Draco smiled at her confusion as Harry took her hand and kissed the back of it.
Harry watches him go, fighting back laughter. At the door, Ron turns and waves. Harry shakes his head but waves back until Hermione finally drags Ron away from the door.
He was so focused on keeping his footing that it took a moment for him to notice the figure standing at the far side of the maze. He recognized the slope of the shoulders and the messy black hair before Harry turned. Harry was mostly in shadow, the hedges hiding his expression even as the moonlight revealed his red coat and his shining dragonhide boots.
"You don't suppose Mr Potter's taken ill," Elise Abbott continued conversationally, fanning herself with her hand. "I haven't seen him at all this evening but I'm sure he'd be here if he could. He is courting you after all, is he not?"
Harry buries his head in his hands and sighs. "You don't understand," he says, his words muffled. "I tried that already."
Harry shook his head, smiling despite himself as he looked back out at the room. "You owe me," he said for the fifth time that night.
"Well," Ron says, settling back onto the sofa. "Now that that's done, how's about you show me this poem?"
Draco's smile is blinding between them. "I love you too," he says, leaning forward to press a quick kiss to Harry's lips.
By the time Draco makes it home, Harry's already laid out Hermione's old cellphone and the handbook that came with it. The model is from 2002, a thick rectangular brick with a screen that slides out and upside down. It'll even make phone calls for the rest of the month because Hermione had switched phone companies before her month was up.
Ever since then, the Prophet photos had been much more pleasing to the eye and Harry had stopped feeling like a slob.
The knowledge spread through Harry leaving him feeling warm and satisfied. To have Draco as his was right. It felt like certainty, like an inevitability. They belonged together. Last night had been proof that Draco belonged in Harry's arms, that he was solid and whole and alive under Harry's mouth. He'd done his best to keep himself in check, to hold back, to make sure that his wanting didn't damage Draco. But last night, Draco had come to him even after Gregory had announced his intentions to the whole room. Even with a ring on his finger, Draco had come to Harry. He'd begged so sweetly for Harry to touch him, had given under Harry's hands, and even if Harry could walk away from all of that, he'd never forget the sound of Draco calling his name as he came.
"No more than all the mothers in that room have considered it," he said, adjusting the chain around his wrist.
He breaks off as he gets a good look at Draco, resting against the arm of the sofa. He has his arms tucked behind his head, his face towards the TV, and he's fast asleep.
"Let me guess," Draco said, deciding that he had no time for propriety and turning to face Harry on the couch. "You've been known to go after unsuspecting purebloods looking for suitable matches?"
"I suppose we have no other choice," Harry said, eyeing Draco's glittering jewels. "You need a rich husband and Bill Weasley broke my heart at seventeen when he married Fleur Delacour, so there's nothing left for me at these balls."
Draco stops at the end of the hallway, a small smile playing at the corner of his lips. "Happy," he says as he heads deeper into the flat.
As he turned his head to survey the room, he didn't see a single person who looked like they knew what to do with themselves. They were all trying too hard, curtseying too low to be pretty, bowing too hard, too fast. Nothing about the displays before him was the delicate, elegant dance of courting, which meant no one before him was worth even his most superficial glance. He was made for the more exclusive affairs, for Zabini's concerts, for the charming dances held at the Greengrass estate. Yet there he was, doomed to hug the edges of the Parkinson ballroom as he tried to avoid some of the more foolish suitors, the ones who thought they stood a chance with him simply because his family had stumbled in their position in high society.
Harry leaned forward enough that Draco could smell the citrus in his cologne. He was so close Draco could practically feel the heat from his thigh, his hand just a stretch away from Draco's on the back of the couch. All Draco had to do was shift a tad and he'd be able to brush his nose against Harry's. He couldn't help himself as they looked at each, couldn't stop his eyes from dropping to Harry's mouth, to the edge of his smile, back to his eyes. Harry was watching him intently, his mouth slightly parted, his chest rising and falling as he breathed. He stared and stared until Draco lost track of everything else but the bright green of Harry's eyes. He inhaled and Harry looked down, finally, at Draco's mouth.
"I'm just going to do this looking at the TV, if you don't mind," he says, doesn't wait for Draco to stop him. "I've been trying to tell you all month, it feels like, and now that I know you don't expect a million roses, it's easier to just come out and say it."
Pansy raised one perfectly pencilled brow and held out the cream-coloured card hanging from her wrist. She produced a quill from a tiny purse hanging from the side of her dress robes and handed it to Draco. He took it and signed his name at the bottom of the long list of men who'd already reserved a dance with her.
"Sidekick?" Draco asks, looking at the iPod and the phone with interest. "Is this why you had Bartholomew kick me out early? He wasn't pleased, Harry, and if I'm terribly bullied for the rest of the year, you will be hearing about it."
Well, Harry thinks, watching the way Draco eyes him up and down, when Draco puts it that way, there's really only one choice.
Harry's eyes dropped back to the necklace at Draco's throat, and his words were low and deliberate when he said, "We're courting and you're wearing another man's necklace."
Kingsley had conceded the point as due to those same shortages, Draco had been present for the meeting, acting as the Secretary for the Head of Intoxicating Substances. Harry's still not sure why that particular department had been present for talks about Dementors. But it had meant that just as he was about to lose his mind, he'd looked across the room and Draco had rolled his eyes and thrown his head back in exasperation. Just like that, the meeting from hell had been just a tad more bearable.
"You look really good in the sunlight. I don't know what it is about you and the sun and the way it just makes you look like you're glowing, even though we both know if you spend too long in the sun, you'll burn. As clichéd as it sounds, when Bartholomew from your department drones on and on and you look at me, I don't care anymore. I like that you're annoying about the types of clothes you wear and that you like it when I try. And I promise I try because I like how we look together and how the Prophet can't figure out whether they love us or hate us together. I like who we are and I like you."
It was maddening, especially that day, weeks into their fake courtship, as they walked around the park, the clouds threatening rain above them. They were in plain view of many mothers and their children, so Harry moved a little closer to Draco, knowing that having so many eyes on them would keep them safe. They could do what they wanted in the presence of others because so long as someone was watching them, they had the excuse of propriety on their side. It was always what could happen when no one was watching that could ruin everything, things that Harry couldn't help thinking about in the darkness of his bedroom.
He turns back to Draco and answers as honestly as he can. "I dunno," he says. "I reckon it might be nice to be appreciated."
It was frustrating and charming, and just exactly the kind of thing that flattered Draco to no end. He hated how much fun Harry was having with their fake courtship, how he was doing everything right and it wouldn't matter in the end. On the bright side, Gregory Greengrass had come back once more that week to pay Draco a visit. He'd brought a silver chain decorated with small emeralds as a gift and had gone for a walk in the gardens with Draco and Narcissa.
They keep watching the movie but Harry gets stuck on what Draco said. He tries to pay attention but he can't keep the "it's supposed to be romantic" away from his thoughts. He imagines the various different ways he's planned to tell Draco he loves him. When he'd first thought about how he'd do it, Harry had gone from plans involving fireworks down to simply writing it on Draco's favourite dessert. Though considering how much of a failure that had been, Harry's not sure he can call that plan simple.
For a moment, Draco wished that he could be the focus of that attention, that he might feel the full force of Harry Potter's attentions. But before he could give in and close the distance between them, he heard the clicking of his mother's shoes along the wooden floors. Harry heard it too, because he stood quickly, running his hands over his jacket to make it lie straight.
"See something you like?" Draco asked, encouraged by the look Harry was giving him. "Or perhaps you've lost something?"
He wondered whether Harry's mouth would be warm, whether he'd stop before Draco came or if he'd keep going. He wondered just how much practice Harry had because he couldn't conceive of Harry being inexperienced with the way he'd talked about fucking. He imagined Harry laying back against the headboard, self-assured, that smirk playing on his lips. He'd tell Draco what to do, how to suck him off. Maybe he'd put his hands in Draco's hair and guide him, press him down until Draco gagged.
Draco stops midway to hanging up his cloak  and doesn't move. Harry watches him, trying to figure out what's happening. He senses something went wrong and when Draco turns to him with a carefully cool expression, he knows something's up.
It was all Draco could hear as he lay in bed that night, the way Harry's voice had gone low and deep, how he'd exhaled just a little rougher as he told Draco all the things he'd ever done. Harry had said it was better when it was someone else's hand, when there was a warm mouth sucking him off.
Harry watched him and even though they shouldn't, Harry didn't stop Draco from putting a hand on his arm. He was wearing gloves but the intention was to comfort him and Harry was going to take any bit of comfort he could get at that moment. He could feel the air getting stuck in his throat as he tried to gather his thoughts. He'd stopped trying to speak these things aloud. It had been hard enough explaining to Ron and Hermione why he'd had to leave. Explaining to Draco was another thing entirely, an important thing that he had to get right.
"Then don't talk to anyone. And if you see mothers coming your way, make a break for it. I'll hold them back."
They'd stayed an hour after the workday had ended. And Kingsley still hadn't gotten the votes he needed to permanently remove Dementors from the Ministry's List of Acceptable Recruitable Creatures. Training the new Auror recruits for guarding Azkaban was still pending, and no one had come to any agreement over who'd get to keep rotating staff like Draco. There are a couple of people Hermione's going to talk to, some people Harry needs to make nice with, and if they're all lucky, things will be resolved a month from now. Though Harry knows that's being optimistic. He gives it closer to six months with the back and forth between Departments and the constant push and pull of who gets what staff and why.
He groaned low in his throat, as he reached out to drag Harry closer, whispering between kisses, a rough, "Please, just like that. Don't stop."
Harry let the silence stretch. He'd been gone for years and yet the war had never felt so close as it did then, with the sounds of violins and laughter in the air. Everyone was battle-scarred in their own way, all of them trying to live in a world that had fallen apart and been rebuilt so many times, Harry almost didn't recognize it. Perhaps, it was best that the only thing they had to worry about now was whether or not Draco would find a good match, whether or not Mrs Weasley would get her hands on Justin Finch-Fletchley.
He's beautiful, shivering underneath Harry, his eyes bright and unfocused. The sounds he's making, small choked off groans as Harry moves in him, against him. Their breaths, loud in the otherwise silent room. Harry loves him, every bit of him, from the way Draco bites his lip to keep quiet as though he's afraid that someone's going to hear them in the empty flat. To the way Draco's hands feel against Harry's hair, how he pulls him down so that they're kissing.
They'd talked about their respective families and had spent a rather pleasant afternoon, nothing exciting but nothing dull either. Then Blaise had dropped by to invite Draco to his family's concert that weekend and the ball the following week. Draco hadn't thought he merited a personal invitation, but Blaise had simply raised an eyebrow and said, "I assume Potter will be attending if you do." And Draco had laughed and taken the invitation without answering Blaise's questions.
"And stop taking poetry advice from Ginny," Hermione says, looking up from the little piece of parchment she'd taken from Ron earlier. "Also, you really should stop doing what people on the Internet tell you to do. You know better than that."
Draco turns to the screen almost lazily, his eyes trailing over Hugh Grant in his Prime Minister's office. Draco tilts his head and makes a pensive sound.
But any news was good news and Harry certainly hoped that the newly concentrated attention would work in Draco's benefit, as it had been working rather well for Harry so far. He hadn't been stopped by a single person that morning, even though no one made a secret about the fact that they were watching him shop in Diagon Alley. Elise Abbott had even sent him an owl right before he left his home, apologizing for her behaviour at the Parkinson Ball. She'd given him some suggestions about what places would be best suited for a walk with one's intended and what time was most romantic. Harry had seen right through her, making a note to avoid the public park by Malfoy Manor that day.
"You know exactly what you're doing, don't you?" Draco asked, even as he looped his arm with Harry's again.
He called out Harry's name when he came into his hand, shivering with the aftershocks. And he knew, deep down in his bones, that it was too late. He was already in too deep with a man who had no intention of marrying him.
"Hey," Harry says again. "I'm going to do something and I need you to promise not to turn around or say anything until I'm done."
Draco watched him expectantly, the silence dragging between them until, finally, with a shake of his head, Draco said, "If you won't marry me, then you'll have to duel me and either way, we will put an end to this."
"I wanted to give you something," Gregory said, pulling a small box from the folds of his clothes. "It's not an engagement ring. It hardly seems proper to propose now in front of all these people. But I wanted you to know that I am serious in my intentions, and if you'll have me, I will provide for you and your mother for the rest of your lives."
They're looking at each other, the moment heavy. There's something about the closeness and the absence of the usual city noise that makes everything hotter and more intimate. Draco shifts as Harry moves and they both freeze as Draco shakes and Harry tries not to come.
"Don't think this a selfless act," Draco says, walking towards the door. "I do intend to use this to my advantage for as long as I'm able to get away with it. I'm going to demand very thorough forms of payment, in a variety of positions."
He felt their repressed emotions like a ball in his chest, something hard to swallow, as he surveyed the room. Everyone was so at home, safe in the knowledge of the unspoken rules of courting. Even the sharp-eyed mothers and the blank-faced chaperones moved as though they belonged among the masses. Harry could tell right away that he wouldn't fit in, and he couldn't imagine Ginny or Ron feeling at home in the overly decorated Parkinson ballroom or among the people dripping in jewels.
He could see the men around the room pretending as though they weren't listening intently. Huxley, who had been talking to Draco before Harry came in, looked as though he was getting ready to make his move as soon as Harry committed the first hint of a social faux-pas. But Draco knew better. He could tell from the amused lift to the corner of Harry's mouth that Harry was rather pleased with himself for what he was going to do next.
Naturally, the front page of the paper had been about Harry and Draco. Harry still wasn't sure how Lady Red had managed to get so many details about his supposed courtship. He hadn't told anyone but the Weasleys that he intended to court Draco, and though everyone had seen them together at the Parkinson Ball, Harry had yet to make his intentions towards Draco clear. Although, it figured that there was already speculation about his and Draco's fake relationship, even though nothing was official. It was just the way of their world that rumours seemed to travel faster than actual news.
"So, Mr Potter," Elise Abbott said, a slow smile spreading across her face. "Now that it's just us, I'd like to pick your brain on a most interesting matter."
"How did you get Hermione to lend you that?" Harry asks, momentarily forgetting the last few minutes.
He can feel the heat crawling up the back of his neck and he doesn't know why it's so hard to just say what he feels. Harry trusts Ron and Hermione, knows they won't laugh. If there's anywhere he should be able to speak openly, it's there with them.
Sometimes he thought Draco might feel it too. In the moments just after a dance finished and they were pressed close, Harry thought he saw Draco's eyes drop to his mouth. He could swear Draco pressed a little closer when they made their turns around the lake, could swear Draco was trying to hide a smile as he leaned his head closer to Harry.
The date is to recognise that, after a day of Harry sitting through meetings with Kingsley, wanting to scream himself hoarse as everyone went back and forth on how to handle the Dementors. He, Hermione, and Ron had voted with Kinglsey to reject the reintroduction of Dementors in Azkaban. Though the influx of prisoners and the loss of staff after the war made it hard, the three of them had agreed that it'd be better to keep guards and press forward with the new Auror recruits. Logically, their plan made sense but they'd gotten push back from more conservative members of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement. The reason being that there was not enough staff to spare for guard duty in Azkaban.
Every morning there would be a new article from Lady Red, speculation about a love match and how enamoured Harry seemed. The more the days passed by, the harder it was to watch Draco from across the room, or across the street, and do nothing. Harry couldn't stop himself from going to say hello when they met by chance along a crowded boulevard. He visited often, sent gift after gift, pretended as though it wasn't great fun courting Draco. He pretended he wasn't taken with Draco's quick wit and his barely appropriate flirtations. He pretended he wasn't obsessed with the way Draco held onto Harry's arm just a moment too long on their walks, how he didn't move away when Harry stepped a tad too close.
It wasn't that Cormac was a bad match. Quite the opposite. He came from a family of well-connected Ministry heads, and his Muggle mother had brought a sizable fortune to the family when she'd married his father. He had a full head of bright blond curls, brown eyes, a straight nose, and he was a good head taller than Harry, though Cormac was built bulkier than Harry was. He would have been fun to spend time with, if he didn't carry around an air of superiority that made everyone within hearing distance want to punch him right in his attractive face.
Besides, well-dressed or not, the Weasleys were an attractive group of people, hypnotic and charmingly humorous. They more than made up for their less-than-perfect behaviour at these events simply by being themselves. It really was a shame that most of them were either married or uninterested in forming a match with Draco's family.
"I just don't understand why this man thinks declaring his love to his best friend's wife was a good idea," Harry says, halfway through the movie.
"I won't bring children into this world," Harry said, at last, because that was easier to say than the rest of it. "They've always wanted everything from me but I can't give them that. I won't."
He tried to say something but Harry didn't let him. He made sure he had Draco's undivided attention as he lowered his voice.
Draco snapped his attention back to Gregory in front of him, to those wide blue eyes and that soft smile. There would be no hardship in letting Gregory Greengrass love him, in one day, perhaps, loving him in return.
Harry has to fix this but as he stares at Draco's increasingly suspicious expression, he can't think of anything except the truth. Then, Harry tries to wrap his head around explaining the days that he's spent failing to tell Draco that he loves him and it seems foolish. There's no reason for Draco to know yet. Not when Harry can't even figure out something as simple as, "I love you."
He wished he could do what Draco was doing, wished that it were that easy to exist in that particular room, with that particular group of people. He wished the world wanted different things from him, that he couldn't hear the way the mothers were talking about him, weighing his name and fortune against the fact that he hadn't held an actual job in the past five years. He sighed as the group closest to him finally made up their minds and started towards him.
Harry buried his face in Draco's neck and kept going, moving with Draco until they were both panting, until the pleasure built between them and drowned out everything but their muffled groans.
On top of that, Cormac never had a good word for anyone, and he didn't like the Weasleys, which was why Harry said, "Draco doesn't take kindly to unearned intimacies."
He couldn't explain all of this to Draco yet, so instead, he shrugged and said, "Just because people are spreading rumours that I'll bed anything with a pulse, doesn't make it true."
Two weeks ago, on the 6th of September, Harry and Draco had been twenty-six and bickering over the best way to drink tea. The afternoon sun had been setting behind Harry's flat in London, faint slivers of orange light slipping through the buildings and into the room. They'd been standing by the kitchen counter, the windows at Draco's back so that he'd seemed dipped in sunlight.
Elise Abbott hadn't been the only one to work that out. As Draco watched, a small crowd formed around Harry, effectively sealing off his means of escape. He looked stunned as he finally noticed just how many people were around him. Draco was watching him closely because Harry was present and, therefore, Harry was a potential match, a most ludicrous and fanciful one, but a match nonetheless. As Draco looked, he saw Harry tense, a minute shift in his stance that Draco recognized as defensive. Before he knew what he was doing, he was walking across the room, his stride purposeful as he made his way to the front.
He'd never imagined that asking to spend time with Draco's parents would lead to this particular conversation, but the more he thinks about it, the more it makes sense. If Draco had suddenly decided that he wanted to start doing chores without magic, Harry would have been immediately suspicious. There are things neither of them will do unless they absolutely have to and, for Harry, that's willingly spending time with Lucius Malfoy.
He straightened, reaching up to smooth the fabric of his dark black and gold dress robes when he spotted Pansy making her way across the room towards him. She was dressed in soft pink dress robes adorned with lace, hundreds of small glittering diamonds lining the edges. She walked with purpose, her steps far too long to be perfectly graceful, her head tilted just a little too far past arrogant. She was a vision, severe beauty coiled tight and ready to strike, everything about her deliberate and defiant.
Draco stood there, paces from Harry, just waiting. It took a few tries but, finally, Harry focused on him and not the scowling mothers at Draco's back. When he was sure that he had Harry's undivided attention, Draco smiled disarmingly and said, "What disaster have you gotten yourself into now, Potter?"
Harry noted the unearned familiarity and raised an eyebrow. He knew for a fact that Draco had exchanged exactly one conversation with Cormac the night before and that he'd declined the offer to dance. Harry had never found out what excuse Draco had given, but he'd seen the flash of anger on Cormac's face before he'd turned his attention to Alice Abbott. That hadn't turned out in his favour either, according to Ron. At breakfast, he'd laughed about the way Elise Abbott had practically dragged her daughter away.
He was expecting Harry and it wasn't a surprise to see him walk into the room close to midday. What was a surprise was the large bouquet of enchanted Damask roses he carried. They were gold, black, and white, fresh and alive but shimmering in the sunlight as though infused with coloured ink. The bouquet was wrapped in what looked like a thin sheet of gold and holding it all together was a string of pearls. It was immediately out of place with all of the other bouquets in the room, exaggerated and almost gaudy, calling attention to itself.
When Harry was eleven years old, he found out he was a Wizard, but more than that, he realised that there was an escape from the suffocating walls of Private Drive. Hogwarts had been a revelation. Before he met Ron and Hermione, Harry hadn't known that it was possible to surround himself with people who cared about him. Truly. Unselfishly.
Hermione and Ron are the last to leave and Harry can tell right away that Ron's up to something. He watches as Hermione shakes her head, but Ron turns to Harry, winks and says, "Hey Malfoy, have I ever told you how your hair kind of reminds me of chickpeas?"
Harry moved aside to let him through and couldn't help but throw a wary look at the people on the streets. Most of them were Muggles, and the occasional witch and wizard that walked by didn't seem to be paying him much attention. He made sure to lock his door anyway and tossed out an extra spell to keep visitors away. When he was done, he turned to Draco.
Harry knew what came next. The right thing to do would be to buy a ring, to propose to Draco and ask his mother to forgive Harry's lapse in judgment. He and Draco would sneak away for a quick wedding. They'd have to proclaim their love to the world upon their return, saying that the rush was because they couldn't stand to be apart from each other a moment longer. Harry would buy a ring and Draco would wear it and…and Draco would be his.
"I was always the Boy Who Lived, and then I was The Chosen One, and every day of my life, I was just what everyone else wanted me to be. I did what they expected me to do. I became an Auror because that's what I was supposed to do. And when I realised that it wasn't what I wanted to do, when I finally decided to do something for myself, nobody could accept it. So I left and I promised I would never again let them tell me what to do. That everything I did from there on out would be my choice and my choice alone."
There was nothing to say to that. It was all Draco had ever wanted, presented to him in the form of a kind, handsome, young man. Still, as Gregory opened the small box and pulled out a simple band, Draco couldn't help but look towards Harry. He stood stock-still on the other side of the room, a stricken expression on his face as Gregory placed the ring on Draco's middle finger. It wasn't an engagement ring, but it was enough of a promise that once word spread, there would be no denying the end of Harry and Draco's courtship.
Harry turned to Draco sharply, his eyes roaming over Draco's face. What he saw made his expression soften. Draco could tell Harry wanted to say something else. He'd even gone as far as opening his mouth, the first syllable formed, his tone gentle. Draco waited with bated breath, unsure of himself as his heart started beating hard in his chest. He hadn't meant for his words to be taken seriously, but he could tell there was a moment where Harry believed them. Until Elise Abbott coughed delicately and Harry looked up, frowning as he realised they had an audience.
As though there were any other possibilities but the one right before both of them. Draco felt Harry's gaze like a brand on his body, knew that Harry was watching him, taking him in from head to toe. He stepped closer and Harry took a step back.
He knew where he stood with Draco, knew that even if Draco wanted him back, he wasn't going to choose Harry. Because Draco needed a fortune, a pureblood, and uncomplicated attachments. Draco needed Gregory Greengrass or Blaise Zabini, someone who knew how to navigate their world, someone who didn't think of children with horror and marriage with revulsion.
Harry had been drinking black tea with milk and sugar and Draco had jasmine green tea, no sugar, no milk. Harry had watched him, had pressed a little harder about steeped leaves and how unfortunate Draco's choices were. Draco had rolled his eyes and in the fading afternoon light, he'd seemed heartbreakingly beautiful.
The first things Harry does Monday morning are clear his afternoon and harass Bartholomew from the Department for Intoxicating Substances, until he promises to send Draco home early.
But he couldn't marry Draco. He couldn't put someone else through the never-ending rotation of rabid reporters, the demands from people who didn't even know them, the questions about children and destinies. Harry couldn't do it again. He'd left the Wizarding World because he couldn't stand the endless expectations, or the idea that by doing nothing he was letting everyone down. He preferred to be nobody, but if he married Draco, he had to be someone. He had to come back to London, had to be part of Wizarding society again, had to show his face. For Draco. For his family.
What was he to do? He never had a choice in the matter, no more than Harry had a choice. Their charade had been to keep each other safe, to help each other when they needed it. Now, with Gregory waiting at the bottom of the steps, there was no need to keep up appearances. Draco had gotten what he wanted, a good match with a good man. The season was almost over and soon Harry would go back to the countryside, back to fucking the beautiful Muggles that made him feel alive and normal.
"Not a chance, mate," Ron said. "You promised you'd keep me company and we haven't given Mum nearly enough time to catch Ginny."
"Potter," Draco said, lowering his voice and planting his back firmly to the crowd. "If I said I had a proposition that would prove to be mutually beneficial, what would you say?"
Pansy laughed, "One dance says he tries to come through a side entrance and is ambushed the second he gets inside."
And in the aftermath of their embrace, neither of them noticed the figure walking away into the night.
Still, it was with the same annoyance that had been simmering underneath his skin since he'd stepped foot in Parkinson Manor that he said, "I'm hardly the only person with connections to former Death Eaters. I don't see why the blasted Lady Red had to single me out."
Then, with a quick wink in his direction, she turned back into the mass of potential suitors, leaving Draco to ponder the question by himself.
Harry was too distracted to hear her and because Draco was not above being petty when the occasion called for it, he said, "Apology accepted, Harry. You know I would never stay mad at you."
With a careful glance behind him, Harry followed, feeling a rippling of magic wash over him as the moss curtain settled back into place.
Harry goes, close enough that Draco can put his hands in Harry's hair, but with enough space between them that Harry can still see Draco laid out beneath him. Harry wants to touch him everywhere, press into him until his presence in Draco's life is undeniable.
"Right, so my poetry is limited to what I learned from Ginny, but here goes," Harry says, clearing his throat as he pulls out the small piece of parchment. "Your eyes are as grey as Earl Grey tea / Your hair is as light as a chickpea / I wish you were mine, you're really divine / the one man who I want to love me."
He'd taken two steps away from Harry, his eyes going from Harry's bare arms to the women huddled under the tree. Harry spared them a glance and was surprised to see the interested looks. He saw Alice Abbott outright staring at him from beside her mother, her pretty face flushing bright pink when she saw that Harry had caught her watching him. Next to her, Pansy Parkinson tilted her head to the side, a contemplating look on her face as she followed the muscles on Harry's forearms. When she met Harry's eyes, she smirked and held his gaze. Beside her, Cormac McLaggen was glaring daggers at Harry as he tried to draw Pansy back into conversation, unsuccessfully.
He wasn't standing indecently close, but the shortened distance between them would advertise to the people around them that Draco had given Harry confidences he hadn't extended to other suitors. It wasn't a marriage announcement but it was a declaration of sorts, especially if Draco did nothing to lengthen the space between them.
He could feel his heart beating rapidly in his chest, Draco's words echoing in his head. He had to tell himself that Draco didn't mean a real courtship, that he wasn't looking for anything aside from a boost to his image. This was meant to help Harry. Neither he nor Draco wanted anything serious from the other. They were both looking for a way to better their situation and a fake courtship, no matter how terrifying the prospect, might be fun. If only for the look on Ron's face when Harry told him he intended to court Draco.
"Do try to be a little discreet with your staring," Pansy said, carefully inserting herself between Draco and his view of Justin. "You wouldn't want anyone getting any ideas about where your interest lies. Especially not before you hear who's coming tonight."
He hears Draco sniff as he orders their food. But by the time Harry goes back into the living room, Draco's already sitting on the sofa, turning the cellphone on and off.
"They'll stay away if they think you've picked someone," Draco said. "Even Elise Abbott isn't shameless enough to beg for entrance where she isn't wanted."
Draco pulls out a small blue rectangle with a white circle off-centre. There are four buttons on the white circle and one in the middle. Harry recognises the little thing as Hermione's iPod Shuffle. Her parents had gotten it for her last Christmas and she'd been carrying it around ever since.
"True," she said, sniffing daintily. "But it doesn't really matter, does it? As soon as he steps through these doors, every single mother will be fighting for a chance to introduce their eligible children to him. It's really only a matter of whose will is stronger, a debutante's mother or Wizarding Britain's Greatest War Hero."
But all that mattered was that Harry closed the last of the space between them. All that mattered was that those hands pulled his hair back so that Draco had no choice but to go where Harry put him.
Harry nodded, already imagining walking back into the Parkinson ballroom with Draco at his side. He could almost feel the eyes on them, the whispers that would spread like wildfire around the room. He'd ask Draco for a dance. He'd have to if they intended to really sell the idea that they were courting. He'd have to pay him visits as well, would have to spend time with him, with his mother.
"I'm chaperoning," he said, taking her hand with his left so that his wedding band glinted under the light. "Hermione couldn't make it tonight."
It takes a moment for Harry to register exactly what he said. When it does, he figures, in for a knut, in for a galleon, and waits for Draco to turn before stepping across the room to stand in front of him. This time, Harry's sure there are no headphones to get in the way, no movies to lull Draco to sleep.
Gregory noticed him soon after. He took one look at Draco and excused himself from Cormac's presence, walking over to the bottom of the steps. He smiled openly at Draco, his blue eyes sparkling with fondness as he waited. There was a pointed silence from the room as Draco descended, eyes darting between Draco and Gregory then to Harry and back. It wasn't just that Gregory was making an obvious play for Draco's attention. It wasn't even that Draco was wearing Gregory's necklace and everyone knew it. It was that Harry hadn't moved from his spot near the stairs. He stood close enough that he might also be waiting for Draco, giving off the illusion that Draco had a choice, that it was up to him to choose between Wizarding Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor and Gregory Greengrass.
"I…" Draco started, not knowing what he intended to say but knowing that he had to move before Harry did something they might both regret. Before Draco let him.
He couldn't get distracted, no matter how attractive the men and women in front of him might be. No matter how much he liked the way Draco had smiled at him in the Parkinson ballroom. Harry had no desire to marry, no will to prove right all the voices that screamed at him about duty. The world wanted him to provide heirs with his name, with his supposed bravery, with his blind willingness to put himself in danger. But Harry had been someone else before the War, before prophecies and destinies, and he was damned if he would let the Wizarding World have more than he was willing to give.
It had always been about lifting his mother out of poverty, of being able to provide for her, to take care of her the way his father had never taken care of them. Harry had never volunteered for that, and no matter how much Draco might want him to change his mind, he knew better than to place his hopes in impossible places. Besides, Gregory Greengrass was perfectly acceptable, rich, kind, handsome. He wasn't directly related to the main Greengrass family, but he had enough that Draco would never have to worry again. And most importantly, Gregory would be at the Bulstrode event that night, and if Harry was finally done, then there was nothing else for Draco to do than go to the ball and seal the deal.
"Never say I love you during sex," Ron says. "Everyone knows that. Too much adrenaline. Not enough space to think."
At any other time, when they were in the presence of strangers, Draco held himself stiffly, back ramrod straight, eyes ahead, and chin pointed up. He'd become a blank mask of rich pureblood upbringing, clipped words, and razor-sharp accent. But when he was with Pansy or Blaise, or with Harry in his flat, all the sharp pointy edges melted away. The Draco that had stood in Harry's flat in the fading light had been the same one who'd said yes when Harry had finally plucked up the courage to ask him out.
There was nothing for Draco to do except to walk down the rest of the steps, right up to Gregory Greengrass, to smile at his handsome face and meet his kind eyes. He took Draco's hand, seemingly oblivious to the attention they were attracting. Draco could hear the scandalized whispers, the rustle of fabric as people tried to look discreetly at Harry.
Harry wakes up on Sunday to the smell of bacon coming from his kitchen. The sun is just starting to rise and the light gets lost in between the London flats. Harry can see the patch of blue sky that promises a good morning but will probably be clouds and rain by midday. He lets himself enjoy waking up a moment longer, the quiet of his bedroom, and that sense of rightness that settles in his chest at knowing that Draco's downstairs.
Maybe he'd be a little rough when they finally fucked, just enough that Draco might feel it the next morning when he stretched. Just enough that Draco would remember Harry moving in him, holding him down, making him come. Doing it over and over until Draco could feel his orgasm building as it did now. He muffled his groans against his arm as he thought about Harry's hand on his mouth, shutting him up, keeping him quiet, pressing down hard.
That much was obvious to Draco even across the room. Weasley had abandoned him to Elise Abbott of all people, and Draco had to wonder whether Weasley was attempting to punish Potter for some wrongdoing. Everyone knew that Elise Abbott was absolutely mad with jealousy over her niece's engagement to Neville Longbottom and that her new goal in life was to find her daughter an even richer and better-connected husband.
He moved first, of that he was sure. He was the one to close the distance between them, the one to put his hands on Harry's shoulders, to press him back against the hedges. He moved with intent, feeling Harry up against him and continuing anyway, until his free hand met the rough branches at Harry's back. Draco was the one who started it all but it was Harry who tipped them over the edge. It was Harry's fingers that cupped the edge of Draco's jaw. It was Harry's thumb that pressed down on the centre of Draco's bottom lip. It was Harry who pushed until Draco thought his lip would bruise, until he felt Harry's thumb against his teeth and he had to open his mouth.
God, he still looked so good even as angry as he was, and Harry had to stop himself from reaching out. Draco stood before him, pale and shaking with barely concealed fury, and all Harry could think about was how much he still wanted him.
He swore he could feel the band heating up, the metal sitting heavily on his middle finger. He took a shaky breath, imagining the headlines tomorrow, Lady Red's column speculating as to what had happened between Draco and Harry. He thought of Gregory coming to his home with a proper engagement ring, of planning the wedding, of the party, the endless days to come with Gregory in his bed, by his side, talking to him, living with him, taking up space in his home, in his life. Forever.
He let out a low growl of frustrated rage and strode forward again, linking his arm with Draco and pulling him along the path. "Listen, Draco," he said. "I knew who I was before and during the war. But then it ended and everyone wanted me to be so many different versions of myself. I didn't know what to do, so I left. Now I'm back and no one learned a single thing in my absence. They still want me to be who they think I should be, and no one bothers to ask me what I want to do, or who I want to be, and frankly, last night it was one person too many so I fucked off. I'm sorry. I should have told you."
Pansy looked at him, practically shaking with fury. "Tell me you aren't the type of idiot who would get caught fucking Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor. And by Cormac McLaggen, of all people."
Harry does his best to be polite to Narcissa the next time they have lunch. It happens on the last Saturday of September, when the weather's decided that rain would put them all in a good mood. They're not able to eat outside, even though they always eat outside when Harry visits with Draco. But Harry gets through it in one piece, doesn't use his coffee spoon for the Tarte Tatin, and manages to scrape by a moderately successful evening.
Harry inhales and glances at that back of Draco's head. Draco's still standing by the stove and there must be something in the air because Harry can't take his eyes off him. He stops thinking about the poem and imagines walking over and pulling Draco into a hug, kissing the back of his neck, burying his face in Draco's shoulders. They don't need to have breakfast yet. There are so many things they could do instead.
Harry frowns, looking back at the screen where people are wrapping Christmas gifts. He thinks of Christmas at The Burrow, of mornings with Ron and Hermione in the Gryffindor Common Room. The Weasleys and Hermione have always been home, have always brought comfort and safety. They're a big part of who Harry is and he can't imagine his life without them. But these days, when he thinks of home, he always thinks of Draco too.
He moved without thinking, his thoughts not yet fully formed in his head. All he knew was that he had to get to Draco, to see him. He'd know if he saw Draco. If he saw Draco, everything would settle into place.
So the morning after he'd come on Harry's leg, he woke and felt nothing but a deep sense of satisfaction. It wasn't the same as if he'd had Harry naked in his bed, but at least now he knew what Harry sounded like when he came.
"Cheer up," Ron said, clapping Harry on the back. "Just lean back and enjoy the view. Just because you're here to help me chaperone doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself."
"I just want to be happy," he said, his words a little harsh, a little desperate. "Let me be happy."
"I didn't have a home before Hogwarts," Harry says, looking at Juliet opening the door on-screen. "I have a home now and I know what that feels like and I wanted to let you know that I feel that with you. More than that. When we're together, it makes me want to do crazy things like bake you cakes and write 'I love you' in icing. I want to do what Mark's doing except, of course, you're not in a committed relationship. But I get it? The need to make it a grand gesture and to just let you know that I like you so much in the mornings."
But Ron had laughed when he'd said it, and he hadn't hesitated when Harry had asked him to help him pick out something for tonight. That his look for tonight had been Ron's idea still makes Harry want to laugh. But he's seen the appreciative glances from Draco and he makes a mental note to send Ron flowers.
But now, as they walked around the park, Harry was thinking of Blaise. He imagined his smooth, deep voice and his effortless charm, how he'd fit right into the Malfoy home. The only pureblood family Harry had known for most of his life had been the Weasleys, and they were as different from other pureblood families as it was possible to be. Harry didn't know what things were appropriate, whether he wasn't pushing his luck by following along for this long with Draco's scheme.
Draco nodded, extending his neck a bit as Elise Abbott made a full turn to get a better look in their direction. He could hear the gasp of breath from the people nearest to them and when Gregory asked Draco for a dance, he gladly accepted. They danced together a second time before propriety dictated that Gregory pay attention to his other guests. By the time Gregory excused himself, Elise Abbott looked as though she'd swallowed a particularly sour lemon. That made Draco feel better until he looked towards the corner where the Weasleys stood and remembered that Harry hadn't shown up.
He knows what answer he's going to get and so he decides that he might as well go for it. After all, it's not like Draco expects a grand romantic gesture.
For a long time, he stared down at his ring, unseeing, imagining that he could hear Harry walking up to him, standing just a tad too close at his side. He could almost feel the way their sleeves would brush against each other, as Harry took his coat off, despite the windy night.
Ron gave him a gracious bow and Harry shoved him, both of them batting at each other playfully, as they settled back into their spots by the door. Harry wished Hermione had come but she had no time for balls and even less time for Mrs Weasley's match-making efforts. Not necessarily because Hermione felt as though there was something wrong with setting people up, but because she disagreed with Mrs Weasley's choices for her children. As far as Harry knew, Ginny didn't want to marry Justin Finch-Fletchley and it was Fred, not George, who was interested in Angelina Johnson, which meant that Mrs Weasley's children weren't too fond of her match-making efforts either.
Draco nodded, keeping his eyes away from Alice's horrified expression. "It would be my pleasure," he said.
Draco said the last part quietly, as though he was coming to a sudden realization. Harry didn't understand what was happening until Draco moved his hand away from Harry's arm. He took a step back and tucked his hands into his pockets, shoulders straight as he looked Harry in the eye.
Harry knew they were friendly, that most of the purebloods had known each other since birth. Draco himself said that he wanted to marry into a pureblood family, so it wasn't that far of a leap to imagine that he might choose Blaise. After all, Blaise was rich and beautiful, well-bred and important. Harry and Draco had talked extensively about Draco's preferred suitor, so Harry knew that Blaise was a potential candidate. He just hadn't given Blaise too much thought because of Gregory Greengrass and his constant need to be near Draco.
She was watching him as they were announced to the room, a blank look that nevertheless found a way to be assessing.
"Ron's right," Hermione says. "It's not meant to be something complicated. If you love him, you love him."
It's why Draco had taken it upon himself to marry well. He owed his mother that, owed it to himself. He was tired of courtships, pretend or otherwise. At the end of the day, all he wanted was to know that he'd have a place to live and that his mother would be safe for the rest of her life. Gregory Greengrass could provide that for both of them.
Harry tries not to laugh as he nods solemnly. He knows Draco enjoys the movie more than he lets on, not only because of the film itself, but because it'd become a sort of tradition between the two of them. On weekends when work had been particularly demanding, they'd curl up on Harry's sofa, tucked under a blanket and just let the sounds of holiday cheer wash over them. Sometimes, Harry knows, they hadn't even paid attention to the movie. What had mattered was the calm that had swept through the flat as the movie had played in the background, something comforting that let them know things would be okay in the end. With work the way it was recently, a Friday night curled up with Draco on the sofa sounded good to Harry.
"You court me," Draco said, continuing before Harry could voice his protest. "A pretend courtship, of course. Enough to get me the attention of someone other than the eldest Bulstrode cousin. Not necessarily a Spanish prince but someone proper."
By the time she was done, Harry and Draco were the only two people in the sitting room, both of them on the couch, alone, as Narcissa walked the last of the visitors to the door.
It was impossible to tell where he was, something about the spells in place skewing the sounds around them. From far off, Harry could hear the sounds of the ball in full swing, the string quartet carrying on over the chatter of the guests. Much closer was the sound of swishing robes and footsteps, as though there was a group of people passing nearby.
“Granger, what you did is still very illegal and it could’ve gone very wrong. You will never, ever, put potions in people’s drinks
“This is Nymph,” Potter says, kneeling next to the snake holding out his right arm to let it crawl on him. “She’s an albino Honduran milk snake. Nine years old.” At that, the snake raises its head to look Potter square in the eyes and hisses.
“Oh, I totally plan to!” Draco snapped, pointing his wand at the levitated fridge with his left hand and bending down to rifle through the contents of the nest with his right, grabbing his clothes and throwing them over his shoulder while the ferret hopped on the spot and screeched, swiping at Draco’s hand with a tiny paw. “Get off!” barked Draco, batting the little creature away and dragging the old T-shirt out from under a carefully collected pile of (
Malfoy swung and slashed and the last thing Harry saw was Lily’s body drop – no, float – weightlessly to the ground.
Perhaps it’s Harry’s expression, or his disbelieving tone, or maybe it’s the sympathy that’s unintentionally pouring off Harry in waves, but suddenly Malfoy’s perfect, white teeth are bared at him and he looks terrifyingly angry. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
“What did you do?” Malfoy asks roughly, squeezing a hand between them; Harry can feel his fingers slipping over where he disappears into Malfoy’s arse.
“I’d Floo’d Grimmauld Place this morning,” Weasley raises an eyebrow pointedly, “Hermione and I check up on him the day after the full moon.”
“Malfoy?” Harry stared blankly at the framed photograph of Luna and Ginny on the wall in front of him; Ginny was whispering into Luna’s ear and the two of them were pink in the face as they giggled at Harry.
Several days after Malfoy and Harry started studying together, George and Charlie came visiting and invited Harry, Ron and Hermione to dinner at Hogsmead. Harry didn’t pay heed to the slight, completely inexplicable, pang of disappointment at the fact that he wouldn’t be seeing Malfoy that night, and so didn’t think much of skipping out on their nightly ritual without informing Malfoy about it.
Lily was unnaturally quiet and listless in his arms. Harry patted his pocket and was relieved to count all three trunks in there.
“No,” Harry sighs, “He’s got this...amazing sense of style and I wouldn’t know the first thing about what kind of robes to pick.”
“Fucking— fuck this.” He impatiently flaps one spidery hand at a burgundy wool coat, half-falling off its hanger between us and I help him shove it behind me with the rest of the clothes I’d carelessly pushed aside before pulling him in here. “Oh, yes,” he sighs when I bury my face into the side of his neck and lick. “Fuck, yes, Potter.”
“What, jumped you and then rushed out before I accidentally broke a few of your bones or something?” Potter smiles crookedly, “I usually just leave for the evening,” he shrugs, “Tell you I have a meeting or something. You never do ask many questions,” he adds, sounding a touch rueful.
“Finish what you fucking started yesterday, Potter,” Draco says snidely, grazing his teeth up the taut chords of his neck, laying a wet lick beneath his ear. “It’s the least you can do after abandoning me and our unborn offspring the way you did last night.”
“I understand that you don’t give a flying fuck about my father,” Malfoy says, voice trembling with rage and raw loathing as he seethes at Harry. “I understand that you believe he deserves
But Malfoy looked as calm and blank as Harry felt and for some ridiculous reason, it was oddly comforting.
from having been thrown onto the training mats as many times as it had been in the past ten minutes.
. Plucking the items one by one out of Draco’s grasp, he sets them on his cluttered desk, all the while smiling at Draco with a rather sappy look in his eyes.
“I don’t really care anymore,” Potter says honestly. “I never did, to be honest. I mean, it was never a big deal when I was younger so I guess I’ve never really known what it’s like to have a big party or whatever.” When Draco doesn’t reply, he smiles. “The Muggle relatives I stayed with weren’t the most affectionate people. It really is okay, though. I’d take an evening with Ron and Hermione over some loud party any day,” he hesitates for a beat, cheeks turning pink, “and I’m really glad you’re here this year too. So...”
