“I talked to two of them, actually. You should’ve seen this one girl’s hair,” Harry said, bringing his hands up to the sides of his head and expanding them outwardly as if to suggest an explosion, “It looked straight out of one of those rock bands. Merlin, it felt like I was being investigated talking to her.”
At that Hermione relented her struggle with Harry and instead hurried her pace to match Harry’s jog. “What’s going on?” She asked in between laboured puffs of air.
“You come up with that one yourself,” Harry said sourly, “Clearly Voldemort’s been the warmup this entire time and my true enemy has been you Slytherin prats.”
“What do you think—? Nevermind! The ponce wants you for whatever bloody reason!” she practically yelled at him and resumed her furious march past him.
“Well,” Pomfrey sighed, “I can’t say that your methods are without their faults.” Hermione visibly deflated at her criticism, then Pomfrey continued, “But given the circumstances, I applaud you on your quick-wittedness, and I dare say that Mister Malfoy has you to thank once he is able to regain consciousness. You should be very proud of yourself, Miss Granger.”
“Pierra!” sang a birdlike voice, then a striking head a white blonde hair pranced through the Great Hall’s doorway, “Whacha doing?”
to follow such a radical ideology and a child bred to blindly follow said ideology; and given Malfoy’s habit to parrot his father at every opportunity, I’m prone to believe it’s the latter,” when Harry remained silent, she continued, “Honestly, it’s no small miracle you came out as sane with the way your aunt and uncle neglected you.”
Hermione seemed to realize this too because she nervously began to shew down on her lip and shot Harry a scared look. “There’s something else, but it isn’t meant for humans,” She said carefully.
“Leave!” Malfoy repeated with an ire that left no room for argument; and, so, Harry left with Malfoy’s eyes fixed on his back.
“You want to nip this pureblood ideology by ending it with this generation,” said Harry, only now beginning to accept Hermione’s reasoning.
Wanting to escape the intense atmosphere that surrounded him, Harry snatched a handful of bread rolls from the pile stacked neatly surrounded by a first-year group of students. As he turned to leave, a good number of annoyed protests followed behind him, while the rest sat in stunned silence, wondering if they had really just witnessed Harry Potter steal their food.
“Then, what’s the difference?” asked Harry as they neared the Great Hall, “Between me and Malfoy, I mean.”
Finally, he reached the common room where Malfoy was waiting for him, devoid of any sign of physical excursion. The boy stood almost blankly, and Harry paused. He looked closely, but unlike the furniture in his room, Malfoy didn’t flicker against his backdrop. Instead, the boy seemed as if he’d been replaced with an ice sculpture, he was white, white not like snow, but as if Harry was looking at a painting where someone had taken a brush and blotted out the figure with pure white paint. Then, with sloth and mechanical motions, Malfoy drew his wand, and Harry realized why he had been in his dorm room. Harry launched forward and tackled Malfoy before he had the opportunity to curse Harry. His hands roughly clamped down on the thin neck with a python-like grip. Malfoy’s expression remained that of a statue, blank; however, he squirmed under Harry, using his hands to push at his shoulders.
“I’ve brought you some food,” Harry said lamely, attempting to smoother the increasingly wayward atmosphere and began to cautiously approach the other boy who seemed about ready to slug Harry until he turned black and blue and the various other shades his skin would permit.
“Leave… Please leave,” Malfoy whispered intently, still staring at the wand in his hands as tears continued silently down the sides of his reddened cheeks.
As they parted ways, Harry found himself once again hurrying down the route which he knew would lead to the Hospital Wing. He passed where Pansy should have been waiting for him. Unsurprisingly the girl was nowhere to be seen. He was alone as he descended through the seemingly endless labyrinth of floors. While the corridors had been dimly lit when he and Hermione left the library, they were now almost completely entrenched in darkness, only ever lessened by the occasional window that allowed the moonlight to bathe everything within reach; and, Harry found as more time passed in his journey the more he looked at the windows with relief in his eyes.
“So, did I, but I wouldn’t knowingly use Dark Magic!” Harry bellowed and Malfoys eyes were opened wide, “If you had succeeded in casting an Unforgivable Curse, you’d be in Azkaban right now. Are you honestly so desperate to reunite with your father?”
“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,” sighed Harry, “I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ll continue on next year.”
“Anyways, let’s get going, you’re partnered with Parkinson and she’s rather nasty about, well, everything... So try to survive, yeah? Oh, and Hermione gets annoyed whenever she thinks Parkinson abuses her Prefect status, so could ya try to get her to not do that,”
After extraordinarily long seconds—or it might have been an hour—or possibly several eternities—they broke apart. The room had gone quiet, and there was nothing more Harry wanted than to trek back down to the Hospital Wing and endure another agonising conversation with Malfoy because somehow that had been less awkward than the curious stares all on him and Ginny. Harry looked over the top of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron. Still clutching the silver Cup and wearing an expression that suggested he had been clubbed over the head, Ron met his eyes and broke into a brilliant grin that rivalled a child who had just discovered mountains of sweets. Harry felt his something settle itself low in his stomach, but he was not quite sure why.
Snape cleared his throat, attempting to redirect the conversation to their original topic, but Dumbledore seemed determined to deny Snape the opportunity. “Now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, anchoring Harry with the sensation that he was under an X-ray, “What precisely transpired in your encounter with Mister Malfoy?”
“Yes, but you've seemed to have forgotten that you, unlike me, are the one who started a duel in the first place and you, unlike me, attempted an Unforgivable Curse,” mocked Harry to which Malfoy grimaced.
At the last amendment, Snape perked up and a condescending smile, which resembled that of a hyena, stretched across his sallow face. A dreadful feeling settled deep in his stomach and Harry hypothesized what bothersome task Snape would conduct. Given the man’s affinity for creativity in the detentions he oversaw, something he lacked in his teaching, Harry wasn’t particularly eager to suffer Snape’s unpleasantness.
Despite the current circumstances Dumbledore smiled kindly at him and said, “That will be all, Harry.”
Once in the corridor, Harry broke into a mad dash towards the Gryffindor tower, hoping he would have enough time to make that forbidden detour. A large group of Gryffindor and Ravenclaw students heading down to the Great Hall, excitedly chattering about the upcoming match. The few who glanced over at whoever was thundering past them gaped at Harry's blood-soaked robes and reached out to nudge their friends.
Suddenly, Ginny was in between the two, turning to Hermione angrily, “Sod off, Hermione! Would you rather Harry be the one lying in the hospital wing? I’m not surprised Malfoy had something horrible up his sleeve, you should be glad Harry was able to defend himself!”
“Harry,” Hermione cried while pressing her two fingers to Malfoy’s neck, “The cuts, they’re so deep, and his heartbeat... His heartbeat if barely there.”
Most of the beds were left vacant, although there were noticeably one or two new occupants Harry had not seen before. One bed, the one he knew to be Malfoy’s, shifted slightly and a head appeared from the blankets tightly clumped together, forming a small mountain. White-blond hair that appeared otherworldly in the rouge rays of moonlight stuck out disobediently in every which direction, overshadowing heavy-lidded eyes that seemed confused by their surroundings. Despite his hair not being nearly as his own on a good day, Harry smothered the urge to laugh at his appearance.
He looks all calm and collected as he waves his wand around, setting the table neatly, like we’re a loving couple having a late night snack. It’s when he sets a plate with cookies on the table - mentioning something about Mrs Weasley having sent them - that I go crazy.
A moment’s hesitation. Draco’s hands moved to his blindfold and he took it off. Harry blinked, black spots smearing his vision. He closed his eyes shut, resting his head against the leather, waiting for it to pass. Beads of sweat and tears were trickling down his face freely and he felt too exposed without the blindfold. He blinked again, turning his head.
‘He - he got violent-’ I say in a whisper. ‘Threw me against the wall and he forced himself on-’ it all flashes before my eyes again. I make myself look at Harry’s clear green eyes.
‘Don’t you fucking say that,’ he bites out. There’s that raw fire in his eyes again, the taint of darkness calling to me. ‘Fuck, Draco. I tried to abide by your rules.
Draco kissed his forehead, his lips warm, brushing gently against the scar and Harry closed his eyes against the welling emotion. Draco Malfoy was kissing his scar. The scar he’d insulted all of their lives.
Magic blows up in my veins, draws down to my fingers, hits him right on the chest. His silent counterspell strikes me full force. I see white, the whole room erupts in a violent scream, but it’s as if I’m under water, swimming a thousand miles away. Deep, deep under. I taste blood in my mouth.
She eyes me intently. For a moment, she kinda looks like Hermione. Seeing things I’m not. Apparently, marriage does that to people. She sits down again, looking exasperated.
‘You sure about that, hon?’ Pansy pins me down with her hard gaze. ‘Because he’s either fucking everything that moves and making headlines pertaining the size of his cock, or trying his best to get killed. I’m guessing you’re the reason behind both.’
Harry withdrew his hand, but he had the hint of that half-smile tugging at his lips. Draco noticed the small dimple forming on his cheek. He couldn’t think clearly.
He came screaming inside Draco’s mouth, his spunk shooting between them, Draco fucking into him so deep he felt like he was being split in two. His come was splattering his own chest, Draco’s mouth crashing over his lips, biting on them viciously, and Draco was still thrusting inside him.
He takes a step towards it and the light twinkles. Beckons to him. Strange behaviour for a light, he thinks. Even a magical one. He doesn’t want to have anything to do with it. But he’s going to have to approach it to leave the room. He takes another step, there’s another twinkle and then the light moves forward. It stops again.
‘God, that’s hot,’ Josh said and he had Harry on his hands and knees again, yanking his head up in place, so that Harry’s eyes were level with Draco’s cock. ‘He’s so fucking crazy about you, his hole is sucking me in.’
I don’t look at him, I keep my hand on the table, I pretend it’s nothing. This is the reaction he wants from me. My inaction speaks volumes to him.
The worst of it was that he was sure Potter, oblivious as he was, had no fucking idea what he was doing. How effortlessly his eyes could break a person, how they could take any walls head on and shatter them. No matter how much time said person had spent building them up. A face like his - that showed every range of emotion and vulnerability - could disarm you, before you even knew what hit you.
I can’t stand it, I am unable to stand this look on his face, like he’s about to say something he won’t be able to take back. He’s about to drive us both over some line we’ve silently decided never to cross. I can’t let him. Can’t follow him beyond that line. His breath catches, he’s about to say it. I shut him up by kissing him desperately. It’s inevitable, the way my lips fall open, the way his eyes fall closed & everything he was going to say dissolves into my mouth. I allow myself the kiss I always wanted to give to him. Wide open, filled with a terrible, shameful need that I would never show to anyone else, something reserved only for him, taken from years & years of impossible yearning, maddening regret. I want him to take me & he does take. He takes everything, he tears me apart, his tongue fucking my mouth, his cock sliding against mine, his fingernails scratching over my back, finding purchase there. I am aching & open, pulling him in, my whole face wet with tears. We’re covered in sweat, both grunting & tearing each other apart. He grips my arse, rolls us both so that I’m standing on top of him.
Right about now, I’m wondering why the precious Golden Boy didn’t get sorted into Slytherin House, cause he sure hits all the requirements. He knows exactly how to play me.
‘As amusing as your life is, I have my own to attend to,’ it’s a lie, but it makes him feel stronger as he turns to leave.
He came back to it with Draco kissing along his hipbone, his every touch a torture Harry wanted never to end. He watched as Draco licked his own lips, and then as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He stood up, his hands climbing up Harry’s chest.
Draco eased one of the buttons of his shirt open, and Harry’s eyes shot there, drawn up to his fingers, to the stretch of skin visible there. He let his legs fall open, his free hand coming down to rest against his thigh and sure enough Harry’s eyes darted there, then slowly moved to the visible bulge on Draco’s trousers. Draco felt himself grow harder under that stare.
We both laugh because we said it at the same time. None of us really answer with words. We’re not in a rush, we already know this night will be different. We’re kissing again, the beat rushing through us. I throw my head back, my eyes looking up and notice the stars, striking dots of brightness in the dark night.
Draco’s lips stretched into a smile. He let his eyes linger on Harry’s cock. What a pretty sight, all red and painfully hard. He was intending on keeping it like that for a very long time. When he looked up, Harry’s face was a wreck.
His voice tugs at your chest. It’s the most personal thing he’s ever told you. For a while, you think he’s going to leave it at that.
I might be a cheater, but after the War I learned my lesson: lying corrupts you to your core. I came clean to Andrew. Unsurprisingly, he called me a disgusting bastard + a waste of his precious time. I couldn’t exactly disagree with either of these notions. He took the ring back. I have never seen it or him ever since. Mother was rightfully distraught by the news, but at least I kept my status as a disappointing son (points for coherence?).
. To be fair, he’s better than me. His technique is nearly perfect. He’s quick on his feet, when he wants to be. He fights strategically, but he can get creative under pressure. He knows how to read me. Sometimes it’s as if he knows what I’m going for, even before I do. He’s definitely better than anyone I ever dueled.
Then Josh was there, hard body against Harry’s back, his unmistakable scent, his beard brushing against his neck, his hands tightening over his arse. Negotiation and talking and getting to know were over. Harry was going to be left in Malfoy’s hands.
Harry was shy and awkward all of a sudden, his body drained, his heart wanting. He looked at Draco’s lips. They were just there, so close.
‘Fuck,’ he said, when Harry pulled back once again. He had an apologizing look, but Draco was sure he wasn’t in the least bit sorry.
, the name lacked in creativity, but the place was fucking perfect. Harry was tightly bound to a St. Andrew’s Cross, his wrists and ankles spread and tied to the cross. He was completely naked except for a black blindfold. Standing behind him, barely an inch from his neck, was Draco Malfoy.
‘We’re not having sex,’ he says. There’s that stubborn look in his eyes. He’s going for what’s right instead of what’s easy. ‘Not like this. You’re drunk.’
Malfoy’s hand was wanking him in the most slow, deliberate, delicious way ever, his other hand cupping his bollocks.
He actually laughs at that. My first instinct is to be mad at him. But I quickly realise it’s a bewildered laugh. Like the thought had never crossed his mind.
‘You really don't get it do you?’ She asks. ‘Some people, my wife included, believe you have an actual brain.’
‘Harry…’ Draco swallowed, shadows playing across his face. ‘You were… so good. More than. You were everything. The best I’ve ever had,’ his hands were as gentle now as they’d been strong, demanding and cruel before.
I have no idea how he managed to convince me, but I start going down to the Great Hall for meals. The first time back there is the worst. There’s too many people at meal times. All of Hogwarts is packed there. I can hear them talking, finding their way to their friends, discussing classes and the latest gossip, carrying glasses of juice, piling up plates and books, cracking up jokes, laughing and it’s as if I’m drowning, something pressing heavy over my chest, all of the noise building up like a wall around me, as I’m sucked down under under under. This was never a problem before, but it is now. It’s one of the reasons I stopped showing up to meals. Draco puts his hand on my arm. I notice I’m shaking. I want to tell him it’s nothing, but I can’t say the words. He pulls me close and starts walking us over to the eight years table, his body working as a sort of shield between me and the wall of noise and people. I can still hear them, see them, it’s still too crowded, too much, but Draco keeps us walking in a straight line towards the table. He finds me a seat on the quietest end of the table and sits right next to me. He gently pushes a plate in my direction. I stare at the stark yellow scrambled eggs and instantly have to fight the urge to throw up. My face must have shown something, because Draco quickly pushes the plate away from me and sets a fuming tea mug in my hands instead. When Hermione and Ron come down for breakfast I’m already sipping my tea and biting on the ends of an already cold toast. But it’s more than I’ve done in months. They look really happy to see me there, but what I’m really awed at is that they speak to Draco all through breakfast. The three of them seem to be getting along, in fact, Ron and Hermione are the only people at the table who actually talk to Draco at all. After that first time, I start to go down to meals with them. I still don’t eat much and most of the food makes me nauseous. But what I do eat doesn’t get stuck like it did before. At least that’s something I can tell Mirna. I think she’ll be happy to know.
“So we can people-watch,” Draco said. And then slanted his eyes sideways at Harry. "And be thankful we’re not them."
there is an indication of either of those babies arriving!” Draco didn't dare argue, feeling humbled that she cared enough about him to scold him like that. Her face softened to a smile. “Thanks again, Malfoy. I mean it.”
While relieving himself—and it was nerves as much as a constricted bladder—Draco tried to come up with a happy memory he could use. But he'd tried so many, he simply couldn't think of a new one. He shook himself off, tucked himself away and re-tied the drawstring on his tracksuit bottoms—he’d finally given in to slouchy joggers in the last few weeks, transfiguration spells on his normal jeans and trousers just weren't cutting it anymore. They'd inevitably be too uncomfortable, and he'd be forced to adjust the spell to loosen them, and then they'd slip down his hips as he walked. That and, well, he couldn’t see past his bump to button up trousers any longer; it was bad enough having to feel around for his dick when he needed a pee and then get the aim right.
And that's what does it: Potter's breathy, worshipful utterance of Draco's given name. Not to mention the beads of perspiration dripping from Potter's forehead, dripping onto Draco's cheek, sliding down to soak their joined lips in salty sweat. Draco feels the pleasure rising, rushing molten towards that point where they're rubbing together, scratching that beautiful itch that's been building all week—longer, if he's honest. A lot longer.
He went to bed deflated. Deflated and alone. He pulled the duvet around him, hugging it, and in seconds felt hot and uncomfortable, and had to move position, which was easier said than done. Once settled, he consoled himself with the fact that in five more weeks he’d meet the little son or daughter that he’d created, and his heart would be full again.
Malfoy then, not a ghost. But haunting nonetheless. The slash of a scar across his neck and chin. Harry feels sick.
As Fordus described the various pain potions and charm options for labour, Draco thought some more about what Potter had said. If no one else had been able to help him with his Patronus charm up to this point, what difference could Potter possibly make? But at the same time, he
"I've made orange and cinnamon sugar French toast with smoked bacon" said Draco, "but I suppose I shall just have to give the last of it to Samwise and Frodo."
Mrs Potts startled, an alarmed puff of steam emitting from the airhole in her lid, but sagged again when she saw who it was. "Oh, Kreacher," she mumbled into the cosy, "do
Granger snorted. “Merlin, you’ve got the same black humour as he does anyway. I… I think I understand why he’s with you. And I can’t argue that you don’t care about him.”
Draco nodded, thinking it a slightly odd comment for a food expert, and muttered "Indeed." He walked as steadily as he could back to the kitchen, feeling rather proud of how he'd handled the interaction. He was glad too that Chang didn't have some unusual allergy to something that was present in every dish. At least he would avoid getting points deducted for
Before him on the lawn, wedged between the banks of wildflowers that lined the sides of the garden, was an enormous table, piled high with what looked to be a pretty extravagant spread. One that could rival a Hogwarts weekend luncheon, he suspected. If he could only see it clearly.
Placid nods in acceptance, and Draco hands him his wand. The Magister grits out a Finite Incantatem, and a stream of blue magic engulfs Draco where he's crouching, before floating upwards to surround Potter.
possibility. Why shouldn't they be in love? He tries to think about it logically. They spent years circling around each other through their schooling, Quidditch, Auror training and now as Auror Partners. So what if not all of it was friendly? Competition is a key ingredient for motivation, and they've certainly always been motivated to best each other, to seek each other out time and time again (even when life
And secondly, Potter was a half-blood. As far as Draco knew the gene for predisposition to male pregnancy ran in purebloods only. Draco shook his head and sighed, not even the least bit surprised that Potter was
Draco pointed to Mr Gnome’s neck and then to his own. “He’s got a little tear. His stuffing is coming out.”
Draco couldn’t believe he had been fool enough to fall for Potter’s false charms; even more galling was that Potter was using tactics that were more Slytherin than Gryffindor, and now Potter had something else over him because he knew Draco liked him.
You know the type. The ones that hold regular village fêtes involving homemade marmalade stalls, a hoopla and a coconut shy, and events such as pumpkin-tossing, flobberworm-racing and broom rides for little kids. And of course, yards and yards of pastel-coloured floral bunting. The sort of village with a tight-knit community where everyone knows your business, and if they don't you'll be regarded with high suspicion. The type of place with a strong pride in its local small businesses, and where if you can't buy a thing in Abbott's Ironmongers, well, it just isn't a thing worth having.
He got up and walked to the window. Maybe he'd see Malfoy on the beach from here, he mused, and then he swore under his breath. Fucking Malfoy. He couldn't even enjoy the sight of the palm trees and frangipani that surrounded the villa's pool—one of those swanky infinity ones that seem to drop off onto the horizon—because all he could bloody well think about now was Malfoy. What was he doing here, Harry asked himself again, looking all bronzed and speaking the lingo and giving back rubs to people on the beach? And why the hell did it have to be the very same beach that Harry decided to go on holiday to? If Harry didn't know better he'd think Hermione had engineered the whole thing! Only that was impossible. And ridiculous. Organising for him to travel seven thousand miles just to get a massage from Malfoy would be a ludicrous plan, even for her.
Draco stood up. “I know a place.” Harry nodded and stood up too. The world still felt a bit sparkly but reality was trickling in.
Of course, things got worse before they got better for Draco. The trials took it out of him, having to revisit every bad choice he'd made and shitty thing he'd done, knowing he could never make it up to everyone he'd hurt, even if he had ten lifetimes in which to do it. And though he knew it was
“Same. Though Molly’s sure it’s a boy from the way I’m carrying. She’s driving me crazy. Keeps coming over with knitted blue things. Hats and booties and all sorts.”
Draco’s pulse sped up. Merlin, anything got him hot these days, so his cock was already twitching just from Potter’s words. He felt mortified. He hadn't meant to hint at…
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Maybe. Because it certainly couldn't be that you're attracted to me, could it, Potter?"
appraising second glances, but those had been nothing to do with his part in the war. In any case, he kept the flimsy alias going, and as all his staff were over a decade younger than him, not to mention self-absorbed beyond measure (
. I- I love you." Potter's chest is rising and falling in fast spasmodic movements, and he draws in a sharp breath.
The flood of sensations is immediate, and he slumps bonelessly forwards against the pillow as every cell in his body loosens and surges. A deluge of pleasure up his spine, and he's dimly aware of a pressure in his pelvis. When he comes back into his head, Potter's buried in him balls deep, an arm around his waist barely holding him up
"I meant the curse. It should be gone now, so we don't need to hold hands and hug and all that." He's looking at Draco strangely.
Draco watched Harry's face crumple even further, and then Harry got up from his seat and gathered James up in his arms.
But Draco's face still itched, his lips still tingled hot, and within his mouth his tongue ached. It was like being on fire, and thinking back on it, it was all they could have done. It was the only way. Potter's face had simply angled upwards, and Draco's chin had come down slightly, and they had kissed, open-mouthed, desperate for touch. Wrapped in each other's arms, skin to skin, hot flesh to hot flesh.
Harry arranged all the kids' flowers, plus his lilac asters and Draco's blue delphiniums, into a big bouquet, conjured a white ribbon to tie them, and together they trudged through the quiet village towards the little cemetery, the kids kicking piles of wet leaves as they went. It’d be baths for them all before they went out to Bill and Fleur’s this afternoon, Draco made a mental note to remember.
why Mrs Clabbert next door has been glaring at me for days. And Mr and Mrs Snodsbury on the other side. I thought I’d offended them somehow, or that they maybe didn't like my guitar playing. I didn’t realise it was over a Tidy Towns competition. What’s the prize, a medal? A tiny trophy in the shape of a watering can?” That set him off laughing again.
He'd been propping up the bar for a good half-hour, watching Ginny and Luna dance, checking out all the quite frankly
At breath number twenty-two, a bare chest presses itself against his back with a mild zap. Draco freezes, not daring to breathe or move a muscle.
Potter looks as dumbfounded as him, but his expression quickly turns to anger. "I won't be distracted from the fact that you're cursing young adults for the simple crime of being attracted to one another!"
Draco leafs through the pages in his hand. There are photos. Picture after picture of Trista and her supposed murderer. Posing together, some sisterly, some more intimate. All happy. All smiling. All touching. All close.
"Yeah. But wouldn't it be better if we figured out what it was first?" Potter had begun pacing back and forth, as he always did when he was having one of his 'brilliant' ideas. "I say we go back and do some more investigation at the coven tomorrow. I'm pretty sure we could break the curse, we just need to do some poking around, go back over the case notes. And then our record stays unblemished."
,” in an insufferably obsequious tone, which garnered an unamused moue from the matron. "I'm Harry's best friend. I’ve been here many times in the past when he’s been injured. I’m sure you—"

“My god, look at you, you're huge!” Gabriel said, gawking at Draco’s bump. Draco couldn’t move his throat let alone form words. “Well? Aren’t you going to ask me in?”
"Mr Potter, sir! Please open the door. This gentleman says he knows you and that he needs to speak to you urgently—"
Draco grimaces. He adores Harry, but he doesn't adore seeing Harry's breakfast moving around inside his mouth. "
"Speaking of..." Potter scrubbed a hand through his hair. "What are you doing all the way out here? It's been years. Why Bali? Why massages? I'm confused, the last time I—"
Draco pulled Potter's wand out of his shoulder bag, thrusting it toward him. "Here, take it, and just forget about the massage. I didn't finish the service, and clearly you don't want to see me; I can only assume that's why it took you two days to finally front up and seek me out. You probably tried your level best to summon the bloody thing back from your villa, especially after slamming the door in my face and—"
His hopes skyrocketed when he saw Pansy walk out an hour and a half later with a wide smirk on her face. He knew he could count on his friend to get Potter to see reason.
Draco gasped at the slur, but was left stewing as he waited for his Roquefort to be wrapped. He’d be damned if he let that pompous bigoted arsehole win.
The Daily Prophet’s fashion supplement insists Draco looks just as beautiful in a three grand silk crêpe de chine Valentino gown as he does in a sharply tailored high street suit.
Potter's face relaxes, and a slow smile brightens his face. "I'll tell you what I think. That's a bloody clever little spell."
Draco couldn't even remember exactly when they'd stopped using surnames, though if he had to guess, he'd say it was definitely
Potter accompanied Chang through the Floo, sparing Draco a small worried glance right before he disappeared into the flames. Draco stood there watching the smoke curling out of the grate with mixed emotions.
Harry huffed a laugh. Just what was with every single person being able to read him like an open book? Hermione's words floated through his head—
"Potter! Malfoy! As you're insistent on disturbing the meeting with your fidgeting and grunting, you can excuse yourselves and wait for me in my office, where I
"It increases the taker's emotional openness and makes them feel more connected to others... and more accepting of them. It's strongly believed, by
“That’s not very bloody fair on you, though—” Potter said, but he was interrupted by a chiming sound. “Oh bugger, we’re being called to go back.”
Potter howls with laughter. Draco is delighted. Not only because he's the one to make this glorious man laugh, but because he's finally within touching distance of getting something he's wanted for a very, very long time.
in the meantime?" Draco's skin was prickling again. "Obviously something that doesn't involve—" Potter gave him a look, one that deterred him from finishing that sentence.
to do with the bed-making charms and the liberal use of Scourgify, but who's to say? Certainly not I."
"Potter, please, it's not what you think," Draco pleaded, but Potter had already turned and was walking away. "Potter, wait!"
Of course, so too faltered his spell; there was simply no hope for it. And it struck him, as Fordus gave a sympathetic
"Oh, did she just?" Harry looked toward Mrs Potts, who had scooted behind the fruit bowl. "Now who's being childish?" After a beat, Harry snickered, childishly. "But, in fairness, leaves
Draco helped Harry to get organised and then they met Granger outside the hospital. She was waiting on the kerb, next to a black Muggle car.
By the time he reached his flat on Brick Lane, he was feeling more positive. He did love his little flat. Well, it wasn’t really that little, and it wasn't really
Draco reached for Potter's neck and pressed his palm firmly against it, wincing against the small painful shock.
“I’m aware of that, thank you, but the baby is using my bladder as a squeeze toy right now. I’ll just be a minute.”
What the fuck was Malfoy doing here at all? Come to think of it, Harry hadn't heard a thing about Malfoy in years. The last time he'd seen him was at that awful Ministerial memorial, marking a year after the end of the war. Harry had admired his bravery in even attending. Amid jeers and obvious whispers, Malfoy had carried his thin, pallid form as elegantly as only he could and laid a simple wreath of rosemary studded with deep crimson roses at the feet of the elf figure on the restored Fountain of Magical Brethren. He'd thrown a handful of coins into the water and left the Atrium without a word. That was years ago now; so where had Malfoy been? Why was he out here giving massages on the Muggle beaches of Denpasar? And when did he get so good at it?
“Well in that case, we better bloody win.” Potter grinned at him and Draco flushed with pleasure. "Just don't serve me up any of that hamper meat, ta very much."
how guests and suitors of the head of house should be treated, as if she was some un-seasoned young kettle straight off the coppersmith's workbench who had seen neither scratch nor tarnish.
“Ugh, let’s just get on with it,” Potter blurted, and Draco didn’t miss the wide blush that had appeared across his cheeks. “We could start with the body image part? Dunno about you but I think I look
Draco was at a loss to respond to that unexpected compliment. He was wondering if perhaps Potter wasn’t quite as obnoxious as he remembered.
Draco sighed in defeat and nodded. He should have known that the most well-known critic in England would not settle for just speaking to the waiters. All critics wanted to talk to the chef, and Draco knew that if he kept trying to avoid it he would look unprofessional and end up getting a bad review anyway.
Draco did, and he closed his eyes and let his head flop back on the sofa. His ankles and toes were throbbing and the baby seemed to be doing yoga sun salutations in his tummy. The wee thing had been non-stop today, moving and rolling about. It was as if it sensed that his emotions had been up and down and wanted to join in.
Potter snorts extremely unattractively, and Robards' angry demeanor is replaced by one of amusement and disbelief.
The man wasn't wearing his glasses, and he had a short stubbly beard, but he was still unmistakably Potter. And if Draco wasn’t mistaken, that was Cho Chang he was sitting with. Dear Merlin. Were they an item again? Potter had always gone for the athletic Seeker build, so he really didn't know why he was surprised.
Potter blew across the surface of his tea and then took a noisy slurp. “You having a boy or a girl?”
." Harry could almost hear the smirk in the man's voice as he drawled out the word 'no', and there was a strange familiarity to it. "Normal in the sense that it can just
That year saw Harry as the most pitiful Prince Eric in history. If he wasn't making grumpy comments about his outfit, he was staring mournfully out the window of Percy and Penelope's cottage, and Draco just knew he was thinking about his mum and dad. Even Draco's fabulous Ursula costume and Teddy's cheeky Sebastian couldn’t cheer him up. Though in fairness, James toddling about in his Ariel costume did make Harry crack a smile; the red wig just wouldn't stay on and the shell bra bounced around as he ran.
"Yes. I suppose so." Harry looked thrilled about it. Draco didn’t know why that irritated him so much. But it did. He didn't know why people put so much stock in birthdays anyway. They were nothing but a meaningless milestone of decay.
Madam Kite walked past several beds where patients were lying, most of them asleep or on magical drips, but some staring curiously at Draco. Reaching the end of the room, she pulled back a curtain sharply and Draco’s whole body went cold. Harry was lying unconscious on a bed, looking small and paler than he'd ever seen him, with bandages wrapped around both his legs and a massive purple bruise across his brow. Yellow magic swirled around his exposed abdomen, slow and sickly. The air smelled heavy with frankincense.
himself in the shower most mornings). There was plenty to do, and so many things to see. And importantly, lots of other tourists to mingle amongst so he wouldn't be too lonely.
He did glance at Potter momentarily though, and his face heated in shame as he saw sympathy there. Draco grit his teeth to stop the tears of frustration from springing to his eyes. A hand squeezed his forearm—Potter. Draco supposed it was meant as a comforting gesture, but Draco hated it,
“Thanks, Mal— I mean, Chef Marco,” Potter said, throwing Draco a wink. The type of wink he’d only seen used in seedy bars as a come-on. It had Draco’s whole face and neck heating up.
Potter also says nothing. The clock ticks, the hands bearing their names dead centre in the trouble zone.
Harry felt the frustration in Draco's voice as well as a sharp pang of guilt. "Sorry," he mumbled in reply.
Draco was pleased to awaken the next morning feeling rested and refreshed. Which made him wonder if in fact Potter'd had the right of it, that it would have been hasty to trouble St Mungo's about their little predicament.
. A sort of 'claustrophobic sensory overload' curse if you will. It's harmless really, designed to immobilise intruders in their own mind..." He trailed off when he saw Harry's expression.
"I reckon you almost let something slip, there, Malfoy," Potter joked, though his expression was kind.
Potter laughed delightedly, causing several heads to turn and shoot them filthy looks. Laurence looked particularly annoyed and Draco could see that Jericho’s cheeks were wet with tears.
But Potter threw his head back and laughed, and it only got louder when he noticed the bewilderment on Draco’s face, in fact it was so raucous that he had to put his hand on Draco’s shoulder to steady himself.
“Nah, it’s fine.” Harry curled his arm around Draco’s waist, slipping his fingers into his belt loop. “This is enough.”
“Thank you, Uncle Draco.” Teddy ran his hands over the stitches. “Mr Gnome is my only friend,” he admitted quietly, and his little cheeks flushed, and his hair turned the same sandy-brown as Professor Lupin's had been.
Potter rolled his eyes, not seeming to care that he was crushing Draco’s dream of a winning streak. “I don’t eat meat, so they can keep the hamper,” he said. “And I’m far too busy with work to be landscaping my 'frontage'." He elbowed Draco in the ribcage. "Look on the bright side. This way you’ll give the other streets a chance to win.”
But if you were to ask Harry when he thinks Draco looks the most beautiful, he would say it's when Draco is sitting in their kitchen in his baby blue pyjama bottoms, sun streaming in the window, a suggestion of morning stubble on his scrubbed-clean face, his long hair tied back with that bright yellow banana clip he bought for 50p on Petticoat Lane market. Smiling at Harry and teasing him about the jam on his cheek.
“Nothing new for you, I'll wager," Draco snips, but there's no prickle in it, so Harry sticks his tongue out. "Yes…" Draco hums. "That’s definitely part of it, a reduction in the intensity of fear and threat perception. And that’s why I think it could be so useful."
“Almost there,” Potter whispered when, after several minutes, Draco choked out low moans and soft murmurs of
Harry looks up at the glowering hulk of the castle, its familiar silhouette distorted by savage battle. The Gryffindor tower broken, roofless.
Potter grinned. "I'm in." One of the bar staff approached them and Potter announced, "Two Puckered Pink Peaches, please!"
"I do!" he blurted. He paused and looked around, eyes wild. Then back at Harry, pursing his lips before admitting, "No. Not a clue."
“I felt so much more… charitable towards him. Father and I… well, it’s never been an easy relationship, and I’d despised him at the end, when all came to all. But when I visited him, I genuinely wanted to hear how and what he felt about what he’d done during the war. Without judging or making him out to be wrong, just
so hard as Dorothy did to get home. Thankfully things were very different now. Draco had enjoyed the film a lot; though Harry had enjoyed Draco's mild indignation at the Muggles' depiction of magic much, much more.
“I… well, I wish for my child to have a different upbringing than I had. I want them to be free to do the things they want to do and be the person they want to be. ”
Healer Thornberry tells them it's very likely a type of Equilibrium curse. That the constant itch and burn compels them to touch, that when they touch one will feel pain and the other pleasure, and that on touching the pendulum swings the other way, reversing the effects for the affected persons.
Potter grips Draco's hand tighter. His short fingernails dig into Draco's palm. The tiny hurts of it are distracting and a little arousing. "Auror Robards sir, I really don't think that will be necessary—" Potter pleads.
And Draco said, "Yes," and smiled back at Harry just as big and unselfconsciously, because actually it was.
that one time they'd had a drunken heated conversation in the Fwooper and Firkin at Slughorn's 80th birthday bash, which ended with Potter shoving Draco against a wall and some significantly laboured breathing on both their parts, before Pomona Sprout walked by and they sprang apart panting, red-faced and scowling, but he was positive Potter had forgotten all about that. At any rate, it hadn't seemed to sour their subsequent interactions.
Very handy for conditioning people against such cravings and infatuations. The Muggles call it Aversion Therapy I believe, and it's a perfectly valid form of—"
Ginny gave him a wink and said “Knew you’d get the hang of being happy, mate. You just needed a nudge.”
in anyone enough to consider…" He waved his free hand about. "And anyway, I mean, what if they just want me because I'm Harry Potter the hero? What if I'm too much for them? What if they see I'm not a hero, just a boring bloke? Not someone worth having at all."
He'd lit a pile of dry leaves at the base of the railway bridge. They crackled to life, and Draco'd laughed and grabbed my wrist and pressed me against the fence.
Though… as they all stepped through the Floo into a pumpkin-and-zombie-themed Shell Cottage, Draco couldn't help himself—he was already planning their outfits for Christmas… and Merlin, wouldn't Harry look amazing in white fur?
Meandering back towards Dumbledore’s office, which was thankfully located on the same floor. Harry attempted to tidy his appearance and took deep breaths to calm his still racing heart
Harry had wondered how Dumbledore would receive news of Malfoy’s inflicted injuries. He could not imagine Dumbledore would respond with anything other than his consistently calm presentation, though Harry had never directly harmed another student in this way, despite the fact that he could not have known the intention of the curse. At least, that’s what he told himself. Although, any judge would sternly remind the boy,
“Oh, like you’re one to talk! You’re nothing but a pathetic school bully,” Harry yelled back, which caused a good number of portraits to mutter indignantly about their disturbed rest.
“That’s—” he paused, thoughtfully watching the elves. Occasionally, a few would raise their heads to send reproachful looks towards Hermione; despite her attempts to help them, her S.P.E.W. movement had fallen flat, not for a lack of effort, but for a lack of understanding. Instead of the obnoxiously colourful clothes, Hermione knitted in a vain attempt to free the house-elves from their bondage, they still were covered in what could barely be considered clothing. Then he glanced over to see Hermione watching the house elves rather dolefully, and it was evident to Harry that although she cared deeply for her cause, her neglect towards the desires for who she meant to represent had been the fatal flaw which shattered her plans.
“Mister Malfoy needs bed rest,” Pomfrey shot a pointed look at Harry, “It would be the best for you both to leave for now.”
“You know everything you could possibly want to know! You’ve solved the mystery, Master Auror. So, why don’t you go tattle to Saint Dumbledore?”
Slower than a snail’s pace, he walked to where Malfoy would surely be resting. With every step, his body seemed to increase in weight, pulling Harry into the stone floor. Despite his sluggish movements, his mind ran hundreds of thousands of times faster, bringing about images of awful blood-red branches that stretched out for him, surrounding him until the entire floor had been transformed into a never-ending field of those familiar and dying red flowers. Tentatively, Harry took a step forward, then another, and another. Across the field, a limping figure appeared, pale and haunty skin which grew all the more pale in contrast to his pitch-black robes. Then the figure collapsed and the spider lilies which surrounded him transitioned into a darker shade of red. Harry closed his eyes tightly.
As he approached the Great Hall a single girl leaned back the stone a few meters from the door. She stared intently at the wall across her, as if she were in the midst of plotting a murder, or at the very least, how to cover up the evidence. The girl’s dark hair, her most notable feature, was thick and messy, stubbornly stuck out in every direction resembling more of a bird’s nest than actual hair. Beneath a heavy fringe of bangs, her eyes, permanently stained by sickly dark circles, peered out, watching him the way one would passively watch people hurrying down a busy street corner.
Inside the dormitory, there were items scattered across the floor like a chessboard nearing the end of a game. Where the other boy’s spaces were tidied within reason, Harry’s four-poster bed and the floor beneath it laid strewn with the possessions he had been too lazy to return to its proper place. He chided himself momentarily for the mess but made no move to resolve the issue. Another day perhaps. Atop of his trunk, lay the bloodstain robes, now crumpled in certain places by what he knew was dried blood. Harry thumbed over the particularly flat stains, hardened by blood, and found himself disgusted by the texture. His hand dipped into the pocket, pulling out Malfoy’s wand. Tossing the robes aside, he studied the wand. It was simple in appearance, at least, when compared to his own. The wand itself was sleek, carved from fine quality wood, with a smooth black grip that gradually transitioned into a dark brown as his eyes moved further up the wand. It suited Malfoy.
Cautiously, Hermione thumbed-close the book she had been reading and instead rested her arms on the table, still looking over at Harry. A shaft of moonlight crossed her face, illuminating her curious eyes above all else. Harry forced back the strong urge to turn away and ignore whatever she intended to say next, although it would surely do no good given her annoyingly persistent behaviour.
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron’s absurdity, then panted out, “I need your book. Your Potions book. Quick... give it to me.”
The door groaned loudly, and Harry tore his attention away from the window he had been closely examining, to see a fringe of white-blond hair disappear behind the mahogany door. At first, Harry was only confused, but anger replaced that feeling almost immediately.
Then, the feeling of his bed pressed against his back and the wind that had forced him downwards had dissipated. Harry was in his bed. In his room. Alone. It was the room in which he had fallen asleep in. It was the boy’s dormitory. He had seen this room at least a thousand times. He recognised the familiar circular room accented with the Gryffindor house colours of gold and crimson. Peering past the curtains that hung limply from his four-poster bed, he could make out the familiar rug, which bore the house sigil, lying broadly in the centre. It was so familiar, but nothing felt right. If Harry stared at something for too long, he could convince himself that it would start to move ever so slightly. Not abruptly. No, that would be too obvious. Whatever it was that Harry decided to turn his gaze upon, it would flicker, then dance about similar to the way a flame would.
Harry sighed, for what felt like the millionth time that day, looking up to where Hermione was still staring intently at him, he said anxiously, “This is all new, Hermione, and I’m not sure if dating is what even I want along with everything else,” he gestured outwardly, “That’s going on. I thought it was…”
Whatever spell he had suspected Hermione would use, a mending charm was not it. Past her, Malfoy, still unconscious, lay deathly still save for the occasional laboured breath. Just as Hermione had said, his smooth, pale skin was blemished with ugly, white scars that twisted and barbed unevenly similar to how a thick rope would. At that sight, Harry felt his rage seep back into his chest and shoulders, but this time was different. Instead of letting himself lash out at the world for its cruel expectations, his rage was directed inwards, to himself. He had done this. It mattered little that Malfoy had intended to use the Cruciatus Curse, because where Malfoy had failed to cast the spell Harry succeeded, but this success almost had cost a life.
“Anyways, I might have suggested that Malfoy had replaced his father as a Death Eater to which he obviously denied; and I remembered when Madam Malkin tried to touch his arm, so I told him to prove me wrong. We got into a bit of a scrap—oh, don’t give me that look—and I yanked up his sleeve and he, erm, seems to have been branded with the Dark Mark.”
Josh laughed. It told Draco everything he wanted to know. He turned and pulled at the leash without looking back. He felt Harry scrambling to his feet.
I have no shortage of offers. Our favourite gay club is one of the few where Wizards and Muggles mix freely, without breaking the non-disclosure laws. The owners are Wizards, hence the available Firewhisky, which the Muggles think is just a very intense, very expensive, secret-recipe whisky. Anyway, by the end of the night everyone’s way too much wasted to spare a thought for the types of alcohol they’re ingesting. The best thing about this club is that most men here are Muggles & Muggles don’t give a crap about my surname. In fact, they don’t even care about my name. Names are not very important after 2 am and they grow increasingly unimportant as the night progresses. Or at least they should, because no matter how much I drink, or how many blokes want in my pants, at the end of the night there’s still only one name stuck in my head.
My hand lifts of its own accord and I don’t know its purpose until my fingers close around his neck. His eyes widen, he gasps. But he does nothing to break free of my grip.
Pansy ends the staring contest by pressing her fingers to her temple, like I’m giving her an especially atrocious migraine.
He seems relieved. My tea is cold, his coffee forgotten. Now that we’re really looking at each other, neither of us seems to be able to stop.
‘Weren’t you dying for me to touch you?’ Draco said, the words sounding very far away. Harry trembled, every bit aware that the hold on his cock had turned to touch. Every movement of Draco's hand over his cock was mimed on Harry's.
There’s mischief in the way he smiles. I can’t believe I’m on the other side of that smile, that it's directed to me. The grey does pop. Draco looks so good, my chest hurts. I never liked anything this much.
My days are spent at Hogwarts, helping with the reconstruction. I keep waiting for him to show up there. But he never does. He comes here every night and watches me. I have this feeling I’m the only reason he’s even here. It’s certainly part of what keeps me dancing and turning down all these blokes who can’t keep their hands off of me. Speaking of… There’s this bloke running his hands over my chest, his half-hard cock pressing against my arse. Potter watches us and I notice how his shoulders tense, his back straightens, his hand tightens around the glass. His eyes eat me alive. I don’t look away as I take the stranger’s hands, placing them over the bulge in my jeans. I’m not hard yet, but with Potter looking at me like that, I will be.
‘That’s what she helped me understand. That all this time I wanted more. From you. With you. So, there’s that. I want a relationship. I would like to date you. Exclusively.’
There are forty five indents carved on the door. It makes no sense that the Golden Boy lives in a house tainted with so much darkness, a house that links him to my family even. Or maybe it does. Few people know this about the Chosen One, but the truth is: there’s something dark about him. Something that makes him all too eager to be hit by curses and hexes. Something that makes him come look for me when he’s battered and bleeding to death. And it’s not just his fucking hero complex. The War left its mark on him, just as it did with me.
Merlin, he was so beautifully submissive, all thank yous and sorrys when needed. So fucking obedient. It made Draco eager to make him lose all coherent speech and thought. He’d play the game until Harry was beyond crazy with need. Ready to beg and do anything for a simple pat of Draco’s hand.
I fight back a wave of nausea as I recall the reason I’m here. Everything in my body hurts. I meant to go back to my dorm last night. I think I remember him asking me to stay. I refused. He said he would sleep on the floor, I could take the bed, he wouldn’t bother me. I told him that was the dumbest suggestion I’d ever heard. We argued about it for some time. But I guess we ended up falling asleep in his bed. I think it’s the first time since the end of the War that I slept through the whole night. Even after what happened.
I don’t notice her leaving. Draco is so close to me all I see is the way his mouth speaks the next word.
He doesn’t turn to look. You stare at his lonely back, down the long line of his black-cladded legs. Muggle formal clothes. He never wears robes to these things and you find it intriguing, strange. You always thought of him as one to follow proper etiquette.
She’s laughing, I’m laughing, and I hear him joining us. His laugh is a bright, gentle thing, deep, unexpected, my heart jumps to my throat. The War almost took all our laughs away. His fingers twine with mine, like it’s nothing at all.
Because yes, I’m the only one of his hookups he feels the need to hide from the press. The usual flock of reporters & photographers waiting for him outside by the front door of the club. I’m the only one he doesn’t want to be seen with; the only one of his pickups whose shady picture won’t be plastered to the frontpage of every wizarding newspaper the next day. Because he’s ashamed of being seen with me. Ashamed of me. Disgusted, even.
He pulled Harry up and walked them over to the couch, pushing Harry to straddle him. They took some time adjusting, until they were comfortable enough, Harry with his legs around Draco. After a while, Draco had the glasses filled up with water and handed one to Harry. They both drank, Harry looking at him with soft eyes. The glasses were set on the table again.
He yanked Harry up to a standing position, dragging him by the leash, and forcing their bodies together. He had a moment to appreciate their height difference, that made Harry tilt his head up to face him. Then he snapped hips forward with purpose, the swell of his erection grazing against Harry’s.
He turns you both around and your back is against the wall. He steps back, his lips red and moist from kissing you, his hair a bit disheveled. It’s like he’s accessing you, wondering if you might do, wondering how far you might want to go and you want to tell him -
As if on cue, Harry’s cock leaked a thin flow of pre-come onto the sheets, still trapped by the spell. Draco felt an insane urge to laugh at the fact that they both got off on their shared fucked-up history. All that pent up tension could be used to make Harry Potter look exactly how he looked now, so far gone and aroused Draco was sure he’d come the second Draco’s hands went anywhere near him.
‘No,’ I say slowly, my voice trembling. ‘For some fucked-up reason, I only want you, but that’s my fucking problem, isn’t it?’
I run. I run as fast as I can, pulling my pants up, my ripped robes around me, ignoring the searing pain in my forehead, on my nose, on my hands, I run and run and run mindlessly. I look back but he's not following me. The castle feels empty, quiet, my frantic breathing echoing off the walls, like the only living thing, a desperate sound.
Draco’s hand twitched over his own trapped cock and that was when he knew he’d reached his threshold.
It’s a downright lie. I’m the cheapest when it comes to him. In fact, I’m easy. Other blokes might chase me for weeks before I say yes to something more than a blow job. Andrew chased me for months, until I agreed to a date.
Harry gave him a short smile, and very slowly placed a kiss over his left thigh, that delicious mouth brushing over his hairs, going gently upwards.
He smiles, almost shyly. It’s so unusual in him I just stare. And stare some more. This is what he means. No walls, because I can’t bring myself to put them up with him.
Draco dragged his cock along his crease, breath stuttering quite suddenly. His eyes glinted in the light of the club and what Harry saw there eased the knot in the pit of his stomach. Draco was going to take him apart, carefully and brutally, just like Harry liked. Just like they
‘I’m up for anything within the rules we discussed the other night,’ Josh said. ‘You know Harry’s hard limits.’
Draco had no fucking doubt about that. He let his thighs spread on the couch, watching as Harry’s eyes darted to the swell under the fabric.
Her touch brings me back to Hogwarts, to those horrible nights, in which Pansy was the only person reminding me I was still human. That I was still lovable, no matter how low I sunk, no matter what horrible things I had to do. I feel her take a deep breath.
‘I only want one thing. Let go. Do it for me, Harry.’ Malfoy’s fingers tightened around his cock, circling it perfectly and he pumped him once, twice.
‘I thought I was the only one…’ Harry said, but he didn’t even finish that sentence, because Draco was taking his mouth again and he was letting Harry inside, his fingers catching on Harry’s hair, hurting, easing.
He sounds exactly how you imagined it. Breathless, insistent, aroused. You can feel his cock achingly hard, trapped between you two. You pay no mind to it and you open him up like you never did anyone, taking your time, using your fingers until he’s unable to order you around.
The order goes through your veins, a rush of adrenaline. Your hands tremble on your trousers but you manage to do it. You hesitate on the hem of your pants.
To my knowledge, this is the only class he still shows up to. This random realisation hits me at the same time his hex throws me down to the floor.
‘’Gosh, Draco,’ he laughs, but even with my back to him I can tell it’s not a pleasant laugh. ‘You’re such a little prick. Maybe I should shut you up. Bet your mouth just needs to be busy…’
‘I feel…’ he breathes out. He shuts his eyes, he feels pliant and easy, and I sink into the rhythm seeping through me. It’s easy. Like dancing.
Harry’s jaw went slack, his mouth taking him in deep, his throat accommodating, eyes closing in bliss.
She gives me a long look that says it all. Mainly that if I was to forget him, I would have. Ten fucking years is a long time to want someone. It’s pitiful. Another reason I can’t tell him. Or allow myself to fill in the blanks of that night. Whatever he was about to say. Whatever I felt he might say. It’s probably all in my head.
I can tell I also need some time to get used to it. All I can think of is sinking my hands in his hair and kiss him until I lose what’s left of my breath.
‘You know I can take it.’ Harry’s eyes were bright and challenging, and he bucked back harshly, impaling himself on the fingers, head dropping on the bed, his fingers curling on the sheets. ‘Him. You. All of it.’
Harry felt so hard, his cock was hurting against the leather of the cross. He wanted to forget everything, that was why he came here every week, why he was into this pain and pleasure game. And Malfoy…
‘It’s better than I imagined,’ Harry said, his fingers curling around his shaft and pulling slowly. ‘Fits my mouth… and my hole.’ Harry smiled as he licked a path up Draco’s shaft. Draco wondered if he could come like this, just with slow teasing and Harry’s dirty talk. ‘When I'm down here I feel like I am made to be used by you.’
And he certainly was going to take his sweet time, Harry thought. Malfoy wasn’t moving, but Harry was sure he was looking at him.
He moans into your neck, his fingers dig into your shoulder blades. He shifts, and impatiently pushes your hand down, your fingers finding his hole. He closes his eyes, murmurs a sequence of spells for protection, deep in concentration. His magic rubs against your skin, makes you heady.
His tongue darts out to lick over your pants. You try to rub against him, to get some more friction, but his sweet hands keep you in place, pinned to the wall, and of course you already knew he would be like this.
Draco opened the bottle of lube and stood between Harry’s parted legs. He slickened his cock, his hand slow, purposeful, his lips parting. How could Malfoy be like this? How could he be the perfect torment and the perfect lover? How could he be everything Harry never even knew he’d wanted?
Draco grabbed Harry’s hair, gave it a tug and forced his cock down his throat. Harry’s eyes watered. Draco pulled Harry’s head back and rubbed his cock over Harry’s tongue and then it was so easy, almost like letting go, allowing the inevitable, dropping free from the sky.
for that night and leave before that blindfold was off. For the strict purposes of the rules established there, he would even have the
‘You should wear this everyday,’ Draco said, the words carrying between them. His fingers trailed over the metal ring. ‘Only this.’
Draco lifted his head up, surveyed him, silent. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking. He nodded, curtly, and at once Harry’s legs wrapped around his waist, arching closer to him. Now his hole was gaping open, waiting for Draco to fill it. Draco brushed the tip of his cock against it and Harry held his breath. He’d had several men fucking him, why was he feeling like this was a first time of sorts?
The club is dark, noisy, too crowded & completely gone as he kisses me deep & desperate, backing me up against the counter. I realise, in the pit of my stomach, that I am going to fall for him. That in fact I already am —
Josh adjusted behind Harry and then snapped his hips forward, slow, hard. The movement jerked Draco out of his near-reverie. Harry’s lips brushed over Draco’s cock for a long, painful second. Harry
It sounded like a confession. Harry shivered and for once it had nothing to do with Malfoy’s hands, or his excruciating proximity.
I close my mouth. She gives an exaggerated sigh. Ever the drama queen. One of the reasons I love her.
He felt trapped in a world filled with Draco Malfoy. His demanding voice that could be cold and sweet all at the same time, his hands so cruel and gentle, his eyes that could pin Harry down like restraints, even if he could not see them.
Those words worked like soft silk wrapping around his cock. Malfoy didn’t even need to go anywhere near it to make him lose it.
These formal dinners are an exercise in masochism. I never miss a single one of them. I know, beforehand, he’s going to be there. I also know that he’s going to sit right next to me, even if there are dozens of other empty chairs. When he’s already there, I’m the one to go to him. We don’t speak after the usual uttered Potter, Malfoy. We always start on this pretend distance.
Josh knew Harry loved to be handed over to other men - carefully picked by Josh, according to their mutual taste. He went willingly, Josh watched the whole thing and made sure no boundaries were crossed. He knew all of Harry’s hard limits and set them beforehand with the other men. Then Josh watched. He loved to watch Harry being spanked, flogged and fucked. By the end of the night he always brought Harry home and fucked him on his bed, slow and hard. Harry was pretty happy with how everything worked with them. He wasn’t in love with Josh, nor was Josh with him and that was what made it so simple and wonderful, really. They had a D/s relationship, they had sex sometimes, and that was it. Their arrangement had been going on for over a year and it provided the much needed release Harry wanted. Inside the club he wasn’t famous Harry Potter, or an Auror, he was just Josh’s plaything, his fucktoy. And whomever’s Josh chose to spank and fuck him any given night.
I sit down next to him. Our shoulders bump, but he doesn’t put any distance between us. His leg is shaking, a nervous twitch of his. I resist the urge to put my hand there to quiet him. He seems lost in his thoughts. I think I might know why.
He’s so close I can see the shape of his mouth forming the blunt words. He’s taken to calling me Draco, instead of Malfoy. He does it in & out of bed. It’s annoying & incredibly appealing & it fucking unhinges me.
I close my mouth. Drop the sweater. He looks young and sort of Muggle and incredible, that stubborn strand of hair falling over his eye. The blue suits him like something out of a wet dream I could have had — that is, if I ever allowed myself to imagine Draco as happy as he looks right now.
Draco took the leash and hung it on the ring. His hand slipped down the leather, fingers curling around the handle. He took a deep breath. He tugged at the leash and Harry looked up.
I know I am. I feel it, too. Every man I ever slept with tells me that. But he’s nothing like them. He says it like a prayer, like a sacred truth.
I evade his tentative kiss. His mouth ends up on my neck. He sucks on my skin, and I ignore the fact that I’ve told him over and over again to not leave marks on me. I’ll have to glamour it later.
His voice is like a drug. It’s everything. You pull all the way back and then you push into him in one slow slide. You stop there, your arms trembling.
I can’t look at him right now, but I know he’s looking at me. There’s so much shame as I say this, but I have to keep going because I need him to know, to understand. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Tainted, unworthy of everyone, but especially of him.
‘I wish you could see what I’m seeing Harry… you’re a sight, spread like this for me,’ Malfoy said, his words hitching on Harry’s crease, making him insane. He’d never been this desperate to be fucked by anyone.
His smile is blinding. He laughs, I can’t breathe. I take his hand and place it there where I want it.
‘I like it. More than like. I want you coming up to me and having me, no questions asked. Like I’m something you own for your pleasure, something you take care of because… because…’ Harry looked from his cock to him. He swallowed, looking unsure.
‘Look at me,’ Draco said, even though he didn’t have to. He’d never had a man watching him like Harry was, his eyes taking stock of everything they could, like Draco was a prize at the end of a painful trial.
It was a sound that Draco knew, with crazy certainty, would make him come if only they were alone. Harry was the only one who could bear witness to him losing control like that, so he reeled it in.
He didn’t know honesty could be a kink, but it felt much like one. Everything Harry said was like a fucking drug to Draco. Magic thrummed on his skin. A twist of his fingers would tie Harry up. Another would suffocate him. Yet another would have his hole ready and dripping. They just needed the privacy. The time. And he could have both.
Harry’s hands climbed up his thighs, pulling at the hem of his trousers and pants, pushing them further down. He was careful and purposeful and every bit the teaser he looked as he bent down his head and let his breath huff over Draco’s thighs.
Draco is vaguely aware that there’s a huge Christmas tree in the center, covered in lights. Draco has always loved Christmas lights. Right now, he hates them with a vengeance.
‘Fuck me,’ he repeated, watching the bulge on Draco’s trousers. Malfoy shifted, adjusting his trousers just so. The cane twisted again on his nipple. Harry screamed.
He considers you for a moment. You never asked this before, for fear of getting turned down. Not for the first time, you wonder what goes on inside his head. Does he want you? Is this just a bit of fun and games? Is he bored? What does he want from you? When will it end? Because you know it will.
Draco almost laughed at the comparison. Harry had always been a great flyer. More than. It was all about confidence. The sureness in his every movement. Like now. Draco watched him move closer to Josh, knees scraping on the carpeted floor. Josh spread his thighs, allowing Harry to shuffle closer between them, as he started to unbutton his jeans, then moved to unzip the rest.
Potter grins at him. It should be ridiculous, but it’s just fucking attractive in a way it has no right to be. Draco releases his hand and picks up the sign. He turns it and reads the words again. It’s the most pathetic thing.
Indifferent to all of it, Potter leans over the counter, peers over at my nearly finished drink. I see the hint of a smile tugging at his lips. The scent of his aftershave is maddening.
But that’s when he breaks eye contact, sets his glass on the counter. I recognize the finality of the gesture from watching it time and time again. He leaves right before that last drink that might tip his scale. Like he’s afraid of what he might do.
‘Color?’ Malfoy breathed on his ear. His hands came up to Harry’s hips, probably to reassure him, but for Harry that touch meant that he belonged to Malfoy. That was how Malfoy had touched him all night: like Harry was his.
‘Not for this,’ you say, which is the truth. Work has been hell. Every waking hour has been hell, except for this.
The blindfold was dampened. His eyes felt warm and wet. Malfoy had fucked him until he cried and was now holding him like they were all alone, like they were lovers, like they had all the time in the world and not just one night.
Malfoy held him, his hands massaging his wrists and it felt so caring, so strange. Harry was shaking, Malfoy turning him around, holding his weight against the cross. His arse hurt, but the change in position helped to relax his limbs, and so did Malfoy’s hands holding him, one on his hip, one on his back. Malfoy pressed his forehead to Harry’s.
I hear him take a deep breath. He moves quietly around the table and I don’t step back to maintain the distance.
I can’t close mine. I’m fully intent on every bit of him, like this is it, the point of no return. He’s wielding something to me, I don’t know what, but he is. I could hit him. I could kiss him. I could tighten my fingers harder around his neck, make him choke.
Harry’s whole body went liquid and then tensed up in his arms. He cried out and his cock spurted between them, warm, jolting next to Draco’s hard length. Draco held him through it, Harry’s body shaking, their kisses growing desperate, the wetness over his cock almost unbearable.
I’m hard against him. He feels it too, against his groin. I can almost taste the fight in him. He clenches his jaw, his hand curls at his side.
Harry closed his eyes in bliss, but he was still aware of Draco, of the leash connecting them. It was all in the way he sucked Josh. He was doing it for Draco, his head placed just so Draco could see everything, his legs parted as Draco ordered, his tongue working Josh so perfectly he had him lifting his hips from the couch to sink into his mouth, lips stretching around the girth.
‘Do you know it’s been like that since he saw you?’ Josh went on, addressing Draco. ‘What is it... two hours, coming on three?’
‘I wanted to keep them,’ Harry said. The words seeped through Draco’s chest. ‘I wanted to keep your marks on me… In case we,’ Harry breathed out. ‘In case this never happened again, I wanted to remember you on me… every time I sat. Or moved. I wanted to keep you… It’s stupid, I-’
Harry gagged on his three fingers, his eyes wet, while Josh shifted again behind him, angling his cock deeper, his hands seizing on Harry’s hips. Josh gave Draco a look of urgency.
His fingers lock around my wrists, he pulls my arms up and pushes me hard against the wall. Just one of his hands is enough to pin both my wrists there without much effort.
‘I’m interested in more than fucking, Draco. Casual is fine enough, but we both know it’s not what we are, at least not together. We’re not casual.’
He extends a cigarette, in a sort of greeting. You take it, your fingers brush. He lights the tip with wandless magic. The shiver begins in the pit of your stomach and spreads everywhere in your body. You’re starting to accept things you can’t control.
Harry closed his eyes, nudging closer, the leather cutting into his neck. Draco eased the pressure on the leash and Harry let out a content sigh, then mouthed at Josh’s still covered cock. He let his lips trail down the shaft, and Josh grabbed his head and kept him there, rubbing his length against Harry’s stubbled cheek.
Pansy laughs. Yeah, I lied. I only do it with her, because she always knows. And Potter. I lie to him too & he always knows.
He has one foot against the wall, his jaw half hidden by the upturned collar of his long grey jacket. As you reach him, he takes another slow drag of his cigarette, the tip shining red.
He forces my legs apart and rubs his cock in between them, like he’s got all the time in the world, like I’m enjoying this. He’s hard and he holds me in a vice-like grip, adjusting himself behind me. I scramble against the wall, push back with all of my strength.
‘Oh, spare me the judgement, Pans,’ I finally manage to sit down on the sofa. I pull a pillow over my lap, hugging it for comfort. I try for a dignified, even if slightly deranged look. ‘It’s not like you don’t enjoy them as much as I do.’
‘It’s not,’ Draco said very fast, over the staccato rhythm of his heart. His fingers brushed gently over the bruise. He had made that mark. He had placed it there and Harry hadn’t want to get rid of it.
All my want breaks the dam at the raw honesty of him. He kisses my piercing first, pulls it between his lips and runs his tongue over it. I swear this is the sweetest, sexiest thing a bloke has ever done to me, and I’m pretty sure there’s more of it coming.
Harry’s Dom, Josh, was waiting for some sort of answer on his part, and he sure wasn’t leaving before he was satisfied. The fact that Josh had followed him, when he was about to leave, opened an array of possibilities large enough for Draco to drown in; possibilities he had spent the last week - plus two very long, excruciating hours at the club,- dismissing one by one, convincing himself that they were unrealistic, downright
Potter is sitting at a table, in a quiet cozy corner, away from the windows. I get the feeling he chose it on purpose. It feels secluded, hidden from possible prying eyes. So he wants to meet me in public; he just doesn’t want to be seen with me. I have half a mind to turn and leave when he looks up. His eyes meet mine. There’s a livid and slightly pink gash cutting across his left cheek. It’s nearly healed, but clearly recent. It changes his whole expression to one torn between a complete stranger and an older version of this person I knew almost all of my life. He holds my gaze as I walk over, trying my best to pretend this is not a huge mistake.
Harry heard the spiral staircase shift from behind as he started towards the common room, hoping to switch out of his dirtied robes and still have enough time to snatch something from the Great Hall. However, when he came upon where the castle diverged Harry paused, peering down the corridor to see a grand stairwell waiting patiently for him. He knew where it led. He could not muster any desire to return to the blood-splattered laboratory. Nonetheless, that didn’t prevent his traitorous feet from leading back to the still horrendous scene like a cruel siren’s call beckoning Harry to his downfall.
“No! You don’t deserve to get away with that! You go prancing around this school, Potter the hero, Potter the Chosen One, nothing
As the world began to awaken with the sunrise the castle sprung to life with students pouring cheerfully into the Great Hall buzzing excitedly with anticipation for that day’s Quidditch match. When Harry arrived alongside a few other Gryffindor sixth-years who not-so-subtly ignored his presence altogether, seemingly due to his detention during the match, while a good number of Slytherins glared at him with an unrivalled fury. Word had spread quickly, and it would seem that neither Slytherins nor Gryffindors would be quick to forgive Harry, instead preferring to silently hate him in an ironic unity. The worst part was he could not blame them.
With Hermione’s semi-dismissal, Pansy turned on her heel and began towards the staircase without checking if Harry was following. The trio stood awkwardly, watching Pansy disappear down the corridor. Hermione and Ron fixed him with worried looks, which Harry ignored, choosing to instead trail after Pansy.
“My cat, Potter, well... Mother’s cat now, which is for the best all round. It’s a long story and I don’t like talking about it. What I’m trying to say is—”
Hours after that the feeling of their accidental contact was still persisting, a low tingling sensation on Draco's skin that developed into a very unpleasant itch the following morning.
Harry waved a salute. In silence, they watched Blaise follow Pansy out of the park and across the street.
To Draco's astonishment, Potter reached across the table and placed a hand over his, the dry warmth and firm grip so profoundly amicable and comforting, Draco could hardly breathe. He looked up and met Potter's eyes, which didn't help the not-breathing situation, as he was met with an intensity he wasn't expecting.
But now. Now it was of vital importance to Draco. A knot of worry rose in his chest; he had five weeks before the baby was due, so he would just have to practice, practice, practice. He’d read all the theory that existed on the subject, even spending a day in the Manor library searching for inspiration. And he’d tried so many memories, from his childhood, from Hogwarts, but nothing worked. More than once he'd wondered if it was just impossible for a Death Eater, even a reformed one, to cast the spell properly. Whatever the reason was, he was now determined to find a way.
written in slightly smaller letters underneath and in what looked very much like Ron's handwriting. Harry groaned. He'd found one alright, but in typical
Harry wasn't certain when he dozed off, or if he even had dozed off. His mind swam lazily in and out of the hybrid-English conversations around him. Locals and tourists alike were chattering, 90's Eurotrash hits (and misses) were pumping from a boombox on a nearby food cart, a lady in the distance was calling
Draco couldn’t help his gaze falling to Harry’s body, his legs splayed out displaying the swell of his bump, his hand resting lightly at the base of his abdomen. A strange emotion overcame him at the thought of the tiny baby within.
He looked around at the children's faces. James' hopeful expression tugged at Harry's heart; at eleven years old, James was at that funny age where he didn't always want to spend time with his younger siblings, nor with the grown-ups, and so Harry had grown to cherish the moments when he relaxed and let himself just be a kid. Albus was scowling at Harry—
Draco pulled himself together, absently scratching his own stomach too. "It certainly does seem like you've had your share of paramours, if the
“Because they love you,” Draco said. “You’ll come round in your own time, I’m sure of it. And you have lots of people who’ll help out.”
The brief jolt subsides, and Draco breathes out and strokes his thumb gently over the raised letters on the smooth skin on the back of Potter's hand.
“I'm going to need you to go out there and ask his partner for her dietary requirements yourself," he ordered, and when Pineneedle began to protest, a confused look on the poor lad’s face, Draco sighed and added, “The critic is someone I went to school with. Let’s just say that I wasn’t really the nicest person to him. If he finds out I’m the chef we risk him writing a bad review just to get back at me.” It was a simplistic version of events, but he didn’t have the time or energy to explain further.
Draco braced himself by taking a gulp of air and then walked out of the kitchen, trying his best to look composed and professional instead of like someone about to walk to their death. He saw Potter waiting patiently at his table—alone, Chang seemed to have disappeared—and forced his legs to take him in the right direction.
The man behind him chuckled. "Ah, welcome, then. Shall we start with an upper back massage, and see where we go from there?" The more the masseur spoke, the more Harry detected a background English accent to the smooth, soothing tones of his voice. Perhaps he wasn't a local. Not that it mattered either way.
“Yeah, I properly went for it there, didn’t I?” Potter grimaced. “You weren’t expecting that much baggage dumped on you, I reckon.”
“It looks perfect, Draco,” Harry said as he walked around the room. He trailed his fingers along the light ash of the cot rail, then picked up a bright fabric covered rattle.
Is that how 'equilibrium' is achieved? Could it be that the curse could be overcome by simply being so in love that a person is willing, if not eager, to bear the pain of it in order to bring relief to the other... could that be how its effects become nullified? It might explain why they had experienced very little pain yesterday (given the myriad times they'd touched) and felt a lot less discomfort when not touching?
Draco peeled off his marigolds and rushed out of his house. He met Pansy at his garden gate and waited for her to give him the good news.
"...and I maintain: tea brewed from your water would taste like something wrung out of a mop," said Mrs Potts shrilly.
of the holiday dance music that seemed to be a constant presence here, and the roar of the waves which seemed to bring a swell of laughter and noise with each rush up the sand. The warm breeze blew in over his face and body, and within seconds he felt hot and sweaty again.
know that,” he scowled, and Ginny pulled back with a laugh. She finished her water, and then grabbed Harry’s hand, slipping something small into it and pressing his fingers around it.
Manners be damned, he wouldn't have needed to be in such an awful rush if it wasn't for Draco bloody Malfoy. Stupid Malfoy and his stupid firm, oily hands, smelling of fruit, wood and sweetness, and
"Potter!" Malfoy's voice cut in, sharp and haughty, just like he'd been at Hogwarts, and Harry wondered how in Godric's name he hadn't instantly known it was Malfoy. He was definitely losing his touch; his so-called 'skills' seemed to have fled once the plane touched down (or perhaps it was due to an entirely different sort of
"Trista was a filthy monster!" the Magister shoots back, red-faced. "She infected Goodsister Joanna's mind. Before Joanna, she'd influenced poor Goodsister Hazel, who decided to abandon her vows and leave the coven. We lost her, and it was all Trista's fault. I decided to forgive her, but within a year she was making eyes at Joanna. And Joanna has a weak mind at the best of times. They both deserve everything they got."
sort of guy. It's just…" He shrugged. "I dunno. Okay, I'll stay on track. Sex? I'm off it for life. Never doing that again. Never, never, never. Had my fair share and look where it got me." And to Draco's astonishment, Potter pulled his t-shirt right up, exposing an expanse of shiny bronze skin, with a thick line of dark hair along his linea nigra, all the way from his protruding belly button down, and down, and disappearing under the waistband of his black leggings. Draco’s mouth instantly became wet with saliva; this was exactly what he meant about men in stretchy sporting attire. "Dangerous business," Potter added, and gave the hair on his belly a good scratch for a moment before covering up again.
Draco doesn't crumble easily, but he falls apart safely with Blaise. It's a ritual, a sick nostalgia, how Blaise removes Draco's clothes one by one and turns him onto his stomach. He doesn’t feel the sting of defeat as Blaise roughly angles Draco's hips and licks him open, doesn’t feel the helplessness of finality as the pillow fills his mouth to muffle his crying.
Pansy lived in Foxglove Close too, in the big house with the ivy up the side, and she and Draco had remained close friends since leaving Hogwarts. Even though she didn’t really care about the Tidy Streets contest, she knew how much it meant to Draco and the rest of her neighbours, and so she agreed—as he plied her with lemon drizzle cake—to have a word with Potter herself, under the pretence of belatedly welcoming him to the street (she was a busy woman you understand; the residents of Upper Itchington thought nothing of calling on her hairdressing services morning, noon or night. No matter the hour or the cost, they had to look their best).
The man’s eyes snapped open then, met Harry’s gaze straight on, as if he knew he was being stared at. It
And so they sat down. Potter and Malfoy, having a drink together, in a tropical paradise, at sunset. Nothing ridiculously absurd about that in the slightest, thought Draco, slightly deliriously. Maybe he'd had one Banana Hammock too many.
And Potter didn't know it, but that simple request for Draco to help him, that mere hand-hold, that implication of trust and the obvious desire to have Draco accompany Potter each remaining day of his holiday, it
"I'm not sure, Potter," he flung back. "At least mine doesn't end with me displaying my prime assets in all their glory to my number one enemy."
Draco raised his hand to Potter in a salute and the man froze. Then he seemed to sag a bit, before waving back, setting his drink down and starting towards him.
As his mind wandered, Harry started to build a mental picture of what his masseur might look like. Images of the men in Hermione's holiday magazines—tanned and oiled, wearing
Hermione had insisted that the mode of transport was all part of the plan, and just the beginning of the relaxation, that it was going to be cathartic and enjoyable, that he could read a book or have a long sleep. Or both.
Potter looked enquiringly at Draco, who shook his head. "Nope," said Potter. "Just the drinks, please."
they might practise. Did he want to go to Potter’s place? It seemed surreal that Potter would want him calling over, like a friend popping round. However, he
” he said, clear as a bell, and opened his eyes. He looked at Potter, who had a bright false smile on his face.
“Oh. Well, then I suppose—even though I don’t feel I’ve done much to deserve it—I’ll be very happy to accept your offer of dinner.” Draco thought he did quite well at keeping the eagerness out of his voice, right up until he added breathlessly, “It would be a pleasure.”
Thankfully, Pineneedle seemed to have understood the seriousness of the situation and nodded. “I’ll try my best, but you know how much critics like to talk to the head chef. I don’t think you’re going to be able to avoid him all evening. Maybe throw in a free bottle of wine once he realises it’s you?” he suggested.
Robards is shouting. "You mean to tell me you've been hit by some unidentifiable curse on the job, and have some kind of weird touching bond, and
Harry cleared his throat. "I said: 'Thanks for that'," and a slight grin tugged at the corners of his mouth.
Potter takes a step towards Draco, and then huffs and turns towards the bathroom door. He goes in and closes the door behind him, and Draco whispers '
The doorbell went a good five minutes before the allotted time, and Draco dropped his wand in surprise. Once he'd completed the laborious task of picking it back up again, he gave himself a once-over in the hallway mirror. He was wearing a comfy wrap top made of a soft jersey material with a grey sash that tied at the side just above his waist, accentuating his curving abdomen. He’d tried baggy loose tops when he was first starting to show, but now that he was gargantuan there was no point hiding it, so he’d decided he might as well just flaunt it. His hair was looking decent enough too, and he quickly swapped his fluffy slippers for a pair of slip-on Vans.
Draco nodded. "Yes, Harry, this is Hestia. She's been in my mother's family for many years and is very dear to me." He gently stroked the handle of the appliance. "Hestia, this is Harry Potter and he's come to live with us."
"I think I understand," Draco cuts in. His blood is boiling, and it almost makes him forget the intense itching all over his body. "Joanna, can I just ask you one more thing? And please answer me honestly. I am an expert Legilimancer, but I'd really rather not invade your mind."
But when he got there Augustus started in straight away on a story about a customer complaint—someone allergic to bergamot oil (only one of the most common top notes in perfumes, for Merlin's sake) had come in with scaly pustules all over their neck—and then Suada began briefing him on the contract she'd just negotiated with Jo Malone, and by the time he left for home that evening, he realised he'd quite forgotten to mention a single thing about Potter. Which was
The process was lengthy and unpleasant, but eventually drew to a close as Miriam and Finian departed. Finally alone, he and Potter ducked behind a drystone wall and fell into a feverish embrace, both eager for the sweet bliss and relief of skin on skin. After several minutes of sighing into each other's hair, Draco realised he was crouching in sheep droppings, and Potter began grumbling about sitting in a gorse bush, so they bid each other farewell and Apparated home for a weekend of discomfort.
He thrashed again, fighting against the invisible restraints binding him. Needle sharp sensations jabbed his armpits, his ribs, his belly, relentless and unforgiving. He was vaguely aware of a discordant clinking, rhythmic and hellish.
Draco got dressed and walked outside, resigned to seeing the judges’ disappointed faces. The last thing he thought he would see was Potter’s garden looking immaculate, even better than it had been before he moved in. He couldn’t believe it. The grass had been cut, the weeds were gone and there were colourful flowers bordering the lawn. The buxus had been trimmed into a mercifully un-phallic spiral shape, and there was even a stone birdbath in the centre of the lawn containing a merrily splashing blue tit.
he did; but when Potter coughed softly and smiled at him across the table, he wasn't so sure. Perhaps Potter actually wanted to know, to listen to what Draco had to say—the imploring look on the man's face was damn near irresistible.
For another, Potter's an excellent cook. Often, when Potter gets home before Draco, he makes dinner; lasagnes and shepherd's pies and Lancashire hotpots, nothing at all like the food the elves served at the Manor and everything like Hogwarts' hearty fare, and Draco thinks he knows why that is.
usually do this. It feels nice though, relaxing, and Draco’s body feels heavy and sluggish. Potter has always been the touchy-feely sort. Draco's seen him do similar to Granger or Lovegood when they've stayed up til the wee hours chit-chatting at house parties. So perhaps this will become something they do. Soothing each other to sleep with gentle caresses.
Draco faltered slightly, his heart dropping into the pit of his stomach as he heard the undertone of what Harry said.  Or rather, the emphasis he placed on his family name.
It was like the house had held it's breath and stopped time on the inside.  Looking at the table just inside the door, there were clear streaks in the thin layer of dust that looked just like someone's fingers had scooped up a set of keys or a wallet before stepping out the door.
Draco hiccuped as tears overcame him again and Harry felt his heart well and truly ache.  Even if Draco didn't have what appeared to be any sort of relationship with Dumbledore, he didn't hate him.  Didn't see him as a threat.  Didn't want to hurt him, it was the threat to himself and his family that was driving him.  And Harry could hardly fault him for that.
Draco nodded without saying anything.  He wasn't all that fond of his father as a person, not anymore.  He sure used to be, used to idolize him, used to be so proud to be his child.  But in the past few years that sort of... It wasn't like it was.  But that didn't make it easier to live every day knowing where he was now.
"I'm still going.  And I'm going to have to act a lot more friendly if I expect to get away with seeming like nothing has changed."
"Surprising, though.  And you're right I didn't.  But I was feeling so shit about the whole Goblet of Fire, two champions from Hogwarts situation that I didn't like knowing something Cedric didn't."
Harry frowned for a second, watching Draco's retreating form.  "Talk later, maybe?"  He couldn't help calling hopefully after Draco, smiling when the blonde turned to look at him again.
"Really?  I have more red and gold clothing options than I care to admit.  Although, to be fair, most of them came from Mrs Weasley.  If she didn't knit me things I'd likely have the same array as you."
"I'm not."  Draco shook his head, smiling a bit.  "I know Astoria dates.  I don't spend a lot of time with Scorpius but he tells me about them.  On paper we're legally married but that's just a piece of paper."
“You admit you’re disappearing.” Harry’s expression lifted a bit, looked more hopeful like he might be getting somewhere.
“Well.. We really aren't supposed to be socializing with any of the people that are being protected.  But even he recognizes that someone is going to HAVE to in order to teach everyone what they need to know to live in the Muggle world.”
"Mm..  When we were here the first time, there was a Boggart in that desk."  Harry said, moving halfway across the room and stopping.
‘I love to watch you beg, Potter,’ he said, his cock fucking his own hand, and Harry’s eager eyes on it, as Josh fucked him steadily.
He smirked and Harry blushed harder. Draco coiled the leash around his arm, tugging Harry closer so that their lips were almost touching when he spoke.
He knew they were being watched, that the club was packed with men enjoying their show, that Josh had probably already wanked himself raw once and would do it again, his legs spread, his cock hard and leaking, as he watched them. But there was no else for Harry now, he was alone with Draco Malfoy, his world narrowing down to the tip of the cane, the penetrating pain tearing everything down and Malfoy handling him like he was his. His to take. His to hurt. His to fuck.
I reach the foot of the stairs and grab hold of the railing. I take one step and I scream, willing my voice to be heard loud and clear:
‘I thought we had been through this,’ Malfoy said. The confident smirk was there in an instant, robbing all coherent thought from Harry’s mind. ‘When I ask you a question I want an honest answer.’
‘The War changed everything,’ I realise I said the wrong thing as soon as the words leave my mouth. He tenses.
‘Fuck you, Potter. Fuck everyone. The whole world. Wizard. Muggle. I just want everyone to fuck the hell off.’
It wasn’t a provocation, Harry realised. It was an honest question, one that showed care. He’d been cleaned and rimmed, but he knew it was going to hurt. No matter, because he liked it, he liked it a bit rough, a little on the side of painful, and he knew Draco would be careful. The thought made something twist inside Harry, something he did not want to be feeling because it really complicated things.
Then, you use your tongue. He curses as you take your fill of him. Whatever happens after this, you think wildly, there will be this file lodged in your brain containing things Malfoy likes in bed. How he likes to be fucked. How he tastes. How he takes it so good. It’s a stupid thought, but you feel insanely happy about it. Your tongue sinks into him, he’s incoherent, the taste of him makes your head swim, the bed seems to shift under you, the walls of the room fall away, everything is warm and slippery and he’s pushing against you harder, deeper.
He’s clearly babbling now. Of course he’d be the type of person who babbles. I just never thought that he would with me.
‘Yes,’ my mouth forms the word. There’s this drumroll of need drawing us together. His lips are right there, chapped from the cold. He’s going to, he’s...
I never knew he wanted me like this. We’re on the bed now, kissing among the clothes and the books, a whole mess around us. He’s on top of me, moving, sunlight catching on his throat. His blue hair brushes my cheek. He smells like Summer and impossible things.
Harry nodded feverishly, his delicious broken whimpers making Draco feel higher than a fucking kite. The idea of making Harry spill like this, without even touching him, was nearly perfect. But not enough.
‘Do you like it?’ He asks, a tilt to his head. The bright sunlight coming in from the windows catches on the blue. Electric starlight.
Under his other hand, Draco felt Harry’s pulse beating wildly. This plain collar would have to do. For now, at least.
The Forest looms right up ahead, distant, close. Every night, as I walk past it, I dream of going there to die. I dream of walking the whole length of it. Of finding what’s beyond it, of never coming back. Instead, I turn left and move along the castle’s walls. Further back, there’s a quiet spot I like. A place where there’s only the night, the stone, the trees. Hidden from sight.
There was a heavy weight sitting on Draco’s chest, making it difficult for him to breathe properly. Potter was so fucking beautiful it hurt. Draco felt those eyes piercing him, his whole body heated, throbbing, his cock inevitably half-hard. He gripped the glass like a lifeline, emptied it, and signaled the bartender for a refill, even if he knew the wine would not help him keep a clear head.
I should have some sort of comeback, but my brain is currently damaged. I simply gawk at him. He grins.
The room fills up with our raw, unbridled magic, sparks and edges cutting across stone and wood. We fight ugly, but the new teacher never tells us off, maybe because she’s new here, but mostly because he’s the saviour of the fucking world and the sole reason we’re all still living and breathing. That means he gets a free pass for cutting classes and roam around Hogwarts grounds at his will and I heard he even has a private room. He also gets to fight me until one of us draws blood.
‘He almost comes from it only,’ Josh added, and indeed Harry looked like he was about to, his cock hard and untouched, leaking against the couch, his hips jerking helpless.
