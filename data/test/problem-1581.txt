He fared even worse that night. The nightmares increased in intensity, waking him intermittently throughout the night. When he finally crawled out of bed long after the sun had already risen, he felt as though he hadn't gotten any sleep at all. Even worse, Harry had said he would be back by noon today, barely giving Draco time to compose himself and present an unaffected front.
"Great," Potter said in response, grinning. For some unfathomable reason, Draco found himself smiling back.
“I’d been on my way to apologize,” Draco said finally, unable to bear it. “To explain everything. You were right; I shouldn’t have let my fears control me like that.”
Harry started walking again as he replied, forcing Draco to follow. "It wouldn't be permanent," Harry pointed out. "Look, just think about it. You've still got a week to decide, yeah? Besides, if you're that concerned, you can just cover Ron's portion of the rent over break." He jostled Draco's shoulder with a smile, amusement glinting in his eyes.
"Tall, brown hair, glasses, wearing a gray shirt?" she listed, eyeing Draco hopefully. The taller one stared at him with rapt attention as well. He suppressed a shudder at the gleam in her eyes.
"What is it?" Harry asked after a moment.
Potter rested a hand on Draco's arm then, startling Draco. "Wait," Potter said, turning Draco to face him. Draco tried to take half a step back as he realized Potter was standing much closer than he had been before, but Potter had blocked him in against the door and there was nowhere he could go. He tried to block out the panic threatening to engulf him as Potter leaned in towards him, clearly broadcasting his intent and giving Draco ample time to pull away or stop him.
“Yes, there was a purpose.” Malfoy linked his hands at his lower back, something Harry noticed he tended to do when he was uncomfortable. “I know of a library that contains the books you’ll need,” he said simply. He didn’t say anything else, just stared at Harry, waiting.
“Oh, not for you, you great egotistical prat. Last I heard, your name wasn’t Harold.” Draco crossed his arms tight again, which seemed to be his default posture when he was uncomfortable.
Her smile broke through like sun after clouds. “Brilliant.”
“Draco filled my assistant in on his observations, which are critical given his place in your life. But I also had a long talk with Healer Medville. He’s actually very concerned about you, and tells me you’ve lost a stone and a half in the last six weeks.” Harry looked down at his hands, his jaw working in his discomfort. Bernard didn’t seem a bit cowed. “For a healthy young man of your age, who passes a battery of tests with flying colors, we have to ask ourselves just what is going on.”
"Because apparently, the Malfoy didn't fall far from the tree, either. Al assures me your son is, and I quote, 'bloody brilliant' at potions."
It was all he was able to get out before the ring glowed bright blue, then the familiar feeling of being hooked behind his navel and dragged away sent a shock through him. He heard Draco shout, and Hermione gasp, then he was flying through space in a dizzying rush. When it stopped as abruptly as it had begun, he fell heavily to his knees, his stomach rolling as he fought to catch his breath.
“Fair enough,” he acknowledged. “If most people who see me knew what was troubling them, I wouldn’t be here, either. Do you think you could be comfortable just talking about it for a few minutes?”
Draco could see Harry was staring fixedly at someone, and he followed the direction of his gaze. Umbridge was staring right back, her lips in a tight little smile. Draco could almost hear her twittering, and the thought made him sick to his stomach.
"Oh, not including you, Ron, of course. We've seated you next to the Minister."
"What, and let Draco say 'I told you so'?"
I have sent a copy of this to Mr. Weasley at Freddie’s House, along with copies of both the mother and father’s death certificates. I am sorry this was the outcome, and sincerely hope Olivia will have happier Christmas’s in the future.
weird. “Would you like me to see if I can help you find a new potions professor?”
Harry and Hermione both turned to Ron, who had slipped in beside them, taking in the surprised expressions on their faces. He held up his large hands, showing every appearance of trying very hard not to laugh at them.
Harry looked down so he didn’t trip on anything on the path. “No,” he said softly. “It was actually… pretty wonderful. It just wasn’t – real.”
“Oh, joy,” Harry groaned.
“Not me,” Draco said. “It’s so girly.”
“It’s…” Draco hesitated, mostly for effect, then turned. Potter had crossed his arms, his hands tucked defensively under his arms, almost as if preparing himself for cutting criticism. How in the world, Draco wondered, could Harry Potter be insecure? “It’s spectacular,” Draco said with all of the genuine admiration he actually felt. “Truly.”
“Of course.” He opened the door and stepped aside, clearly still irritated but Hermione didn’t care. This wasn’t some minor training officer they were talking about; this was Harry Potter, defeater of dark lords and her very best friend in the world, dammit, and she meant to take him home in one piece. She lifted her chin and walked through the door, Ron right behind her.
Draco’s brows arched in surprise.  “Really.  Well, Threadgood’s has a decent selection, and they’ll have her size on file.  Come along.”  He started off down the sidewalk, and when the other two men didn’t follow him, he paused and looked back.  “Are you coming?” His tone was arch.
"The glamour," he said tightly. Ron's eyes narrowed. "The waiter."
He didn’t know how long he stood there, the snow falling all around the bubble of warmth, staring at the lit panes of glass in the windows, diamonds of light as cold and remote as the gem stones they resembled.
Harry hadn’t been able to forget about it. He’d been so fixated that Lily told him if it bothered him so much he should open his own school. Her words echoed in his head for weeks. He recalled how much trouble he’d had when he’d been dropped into the wizarding world at eleven with no background in magic. Even Hermione, who excelled at everything, had trouble adjusting and making friends before he and Ron knocked a mountain troll unconscious in the girl’s loo, forging a friendship that would last forever. He could tell that students from magical homes had a much easier time settling in than those from Muggle homes. Given Andi Lupin’s experience, he was afraid that with the prejudices lingering in the wizarding world, she wasn’t the only child who’d been refused admittance to one of those very few, very exclusive magical pre-schools. He was still musing it over, not sure if he was serious or not when his assistant at the MLE, Joanna, came into work one morning, eyes red-rimmed.
"Alright, on 3," he said, aiming and focusing the camera. "1, 2, 3." He tapped the screen. The image froze with a small click as it was captured before the camera returned to normal. "There you go, girls," Draco said graciously, handing the camera back. "Now if you'll excuse us, we were just leaving." He stood up and gestured to Harry to follow suit.
It was spectacular how things fell apart after that.
“Father didn’t take that kindly, of course. He tracked me down, had one of his cronies visit me just before Christmas. Yaxley, on behalf of my father, threatened to rain hell upon me if I didn’t return to London, and to my post. It left me shaken, obviously. It was like the version of myself I’d buried in London had come back to haunt me, making it clear that I would never be free of my past.”
“You will fail,” Lucius spat. “If you imagine wiping your slate clean to be as easy as running away, you are a bigger fool than I ever imagined you to be. Do you think you can simply drop a curtain between your past and future and separate yourself from the things you’ve done? Do you think your future clients, your future colleagues, will see your Mark without knowing exactly who you are? Who you were, who you could have been?”
Harry didn’t approach the end of break with the same relief, though. He caught Draco when Draco was in the middle of packing up his things, just days before Draco could move out. “We need to talk,” he said, arms crossed and shoulders tensed.
Draco drew a shuddering breath. He nodded and tried to gather his thoughts. As horrified as he was on Harry’s behalf, he knew Harry wouldn’t care to hear his platitudes right now. Besides, this was the opportunity he had wanted all along, wasn’t it? To come clean? He would never forgive himself if he wasted it. “We truly are a matched set,” Draco said faintly. “My father is a powerful man. He sits atop a sprawling criminal network in London. I was drafted into his militia at thirteen; I started as a simple runner, but I climbed the ranks with ease, and when I was sixteen, my father began training me as a lieutenant. That’s when I took the Mark.” He twisted his left forearm to display the Mark in its entirety, though he still couldn’t bring himself to meet Harry’s gaze and discern his reaction. “It was an enjoyable lifestyle, even if I couldn’t stomach the violence at times. I relished the power I held.
The start of term crept up on them without a warning. Draco met it with a sense of relief. Soon, he would be able to move back into his dorm room, away from Harry’s disappointment and concern. He would be able to confront his father on his own terms, without worrying about keeping Harry in the dark. For a brief moment, he felt guilty that he was looking forward to leaving Harry, but he pushed the guilt aside with the knowledge that he could keep Harry safe this way.
Draco scoffed. “Home? London isn’t my home anymore, Father. I’m done! With the Death Eaters, with the bloodshed and violence, with you. Do you honestly think you’re making a case for yourself by bringing me out here, by kidnapping my—” Draco swallowed past the lump in his throat. “By kidnapping Harry as leverage? He doesn’t pose a threat. You only involved him to justify your own power trip. Because you couldn’t stand letting me pave my own way. All of this”—Draco swept his hand across the tableau, from Harry to Lucius to the Death Eaters lurking in the back—“has only convinced me I made the right decision.” He paused, breathing heavily and trying to rein in the anger and panic sweeping through him. “I’m leaving now—”
The man under the desk-Potter, Draco presumed-attempted to rise, but Draco pushed him down. "Not yet," he murmured, able to see from his vantage point that the girls were headed back their way.
Instinctively, Draco pulled at the hem of his sleeve, even as he said, “No, it’s nothing like that. It’s just a nightmare, I promise.” He turned to look Harry in the eyes, attempting to infuse as much sincerity into his voice as he could.
Clara snorted. “No, you wouldn’t. That would mean you’d have to keep track of your own appointments.”
“Let me go!” He cried out, swinging, terrified. He couldn’t get to his wand in his sleeve, and the hands on him seemed determined to wrench his shoulders from their sockets. “Let me go, goddamn you!”
When Harry was just a couple of feet away, he stopped, and stood silently, waiting. Draco swallowed nervously.
“No I won’t,” Ron replied, taking a huge bite of what Harry could see was a mince pasty.
“Knows that you’re with me,” Harry interjected. “She isn’t expecting you until late.”
The look on her face was not particularly encouraging. “Thank you, Headmaster, but I’ll pass. You can’t afford me.” Harry snorted, but he knew it was true. “And if I told Ron we were moving back into Hogwarts so that I could become the head of Slytherin House, he’d divorce me. Odd as it seems, I rather love my husband.”
vapid and shallow. Perhaps he saw too much of himself in them; he didn’t know. It just seemed like they were entirely too much trouble to go through for not nearly enough pleasure. They were all in such a hurry; he had grown to appreciate taking his time, lingering over a well turned bicep or a strongly muscled shoulder.
Bill grabbed Harry’s shoulders and forcefully turned him.
“Roland,” Draco repeated, knowing he’d never use the man’s first name.
“But think of the service you’d have done for mankind.” Malfoy skated over until he was standing on the other side of the boards, and between his skates and the several inches of ice that made up the rink floor, Harry found himself having to look way, way up into his face. “I only know about the paper because Pansy forced me to look at it,” Malfoy went on. “Mother stopped taking it just after the war, and I certainly never cared what they wrote about us. And why am I babbling?”
Kingsley looked to Hermione, but it was abundantly clear she wasn’t going to help him. He linked his fingers, looking down at them. “He was in Dartmoor National Park last we heard, staying at a compound that was established by Karkaroff’s nephew. He’d been sending in regular reports, and was making excellent progress.”
She smiled shyly around her fingers, but didn’t come any closer.
“So, Hagrid,” Harry lowered his hand, smoothing it over the horses muscled chest. Finally, he dropped it to his side and turned. “You sent for me. What’s going on?”
The hat felt like cashmere, and matched a scarf that was wound around her small throat. Her jacket was burgundy wool and expensive looking, as were her patterned tight tights and her shiny black shoes. Apparently, Ms. Patil wasn’t hurting financially. Draco pulled the bright pink hat from her head and a riot of curls spilled over her forehead and around her ears. They were thick and black, and once again his breath caught. Messy black hair and vivid green eyes, and a surprisingly strong magical background at eight months…
Again, Harry slowly shook his head. “I can’t do that,” he said, his deep voice resolute. “You know I can’t do that. Not now that you’re back. Not until you tell me what happened; why you left me.”
“How do you know that?”
hpdmhpdmhpdm
That voice he knew as well as his own. Ron. The name floated through his mind. It was Ron. He wanted to say hello; it had been so long since he’d seen him. Almost a year, he thought. That was right, wasn’t it?
“They’re in the blue tin on your desk, Daddy,” Megan answered, taping yet another length of sparkly garland to an end cap. When he’d walked in that morning, each of the over-decorated Christmas trees had at least a dozen brightly wrapped packages beneath, tags hanging from them with nauseating sentiment’s like, ‘To: Draco, Because you’ve been so good! Love: Santa Claus’. He’d been tempted to tell her to take his name off of anything so obnoxious, but he bit his lip. She was so pleased with herself even he couldn’t bring himself to burst her bubble. He was also fairly certain there was so many Christmas decorations adorning the small store, it could be seen from space.
“Very nice, Rosie,” he said fondly. She turned and looked up at him, her blue eyes very wide.
He shot her an outraged look. “I do no such thing,” he protested. He waited until he got home, thank you very much.
“You’re right, sweetheart. I do.”
He saw Draco's shoulders stiffen and his face pale in spite of the glamour. "Why? Is…" He hesitated. "Are the boys all right?"
As luck would have it, Potter was one of the last people to arrive. It was odd, really, how Draco knew that he’d entered the room. He… felt him. It was the strangest thing. He was pouring out a double scotch for Pansy’s father, who seemed bound and determined to be in his cups before they even approached the dining room, and the hair on the back of his neck seemed to lift as a chill skirted across his shoulders, and he looked up to find himself pinned in place under a steady, verdant gaze.
Draco nodded, fighting back a wave of nausea. Where to begin? He looked down at his hands.
“Truer words.” She came up beside him and put her hand on his arm. “Darling, will you take these and the canapés into the back sitting room for me while I get the sherry for ‘the old dear’?” Draco started to protest when she handed him the quiche, but he saw the slight tremor that ran through her hand. He paused in what he was doing and took the tray from her and set it aside, then caught her hand and held it.
“Gods, Lily.” He ran his hand through his hair. “Truly, I could happily live to be a hundred and thirty without hearing the words
"Not until you tell me why you're leaving," Harry said. "We had an agreement, and you have one more event to attend. Remember? Widows and orphans, tomorrow at one."
“I know,” Draco said with a huff. “But I’ve always been a spoiled brat. I want what I want when I want it, and I want you. Damnit.”
Harry squeezed his hand.
Draco was lounging against the headboard of his bed, several pillows at his back, his hands linked behind his head as he watched Harry try on a set of opulent hunter green dress robes.
“You didn’t know about it?”
“Malfoy,” he said breathlessly, drawing Draco’s eyes back to his face. “I didn’t realise…” He paused and took a deep breath. “I thought I was alone.” The tips of his ears turned pink, and Draco found himself unexpectedly charmed by that.
She walked into the Floo with a little wave, and Harry went downstairs to collect the groceries before he went home.
“Who was it, Draco?” she went on insistently, her tone hard. “Who was it? And what in Hades did they say to make you leave?”
“Ah, lovely Bellatrix. The mad cow.” Draco cleared his throat. “You know your grandmother reconciled with her other sister before she passed.”
“Read ‘stupid’,” he said wryly. He looked down at Potter. “Promise her you’ll be good. You and I need to talk.”
“Here, love,” he murmured, handing him the glass of water. Harry took it gratefully, sipping and swirling it through his mouth, washing away the bitter taste of bile without swallowing. He spit it out and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, sitting back on his heels before looking at Draco crouching beside him. “I think we’ll be passing on dinner today.”
Draco smacked him on the shoulder. “Because you’re going to force me to socialize with all of these people before I can take you home to bed!”
“You’re each taking five?” Draco’s brows shot up.
Harry opened the oven and checked the hot, beautifully browned roast, basting it carefully, then closing the door again. Everything else, all of the accompaniments to the vast dinner, were sitting under stasis charms on the island of their custom remodelled kitchen, but the meat wasn’t quite where he wanted it to be yet, and so he closed the door and went back to pulling apart the homemade dinner rolls Molly brought, placing them in a self-warming basket and covering them with a towel before using his wand to set a spell that prevented drying.
Harry sputtered, then bit the laugh back. He could see that not understanding wasn’t amusing Draco in the slightest. “It’s an American cartoon, drawn by a man named Charles Shultz. It’s called ‘Peanuts’.”
“You say that as if you doubt my qualifications.”
She settled gracefully onto the edge of an elegant chair. “You don’t think it’s urgent that I haven’t seen my best friend in two months?”
Ron had covered his face with his hands long before Draco, with Harry's eventual enthusiastic participation, was finished.

"Secondly, I don't get how anyone could even
"Point to Granger."
Hermione looked thoughtful.  “What you need is a real estate agent,” she said firmly.  “Someone who can find just what you’re looking for.”
As he and Draco walked by the giant clock tower  with Teddy between them, Harry paused and looked at the stately tower, and the massive tree. They looked so much like they had before, save the looming London Eye behind them. Harry couldn’t help but remember how he’d felt, seeing the grand buildings, eyes avid before they locked him away in the dark parking garage. Usually the memories didn’t bother him much, but standing there in the expensive suit, Teddy next to him wearing a bright red jumper, shirt and tie, and Draco looking so elegant it made Harry’s heart race, he couldn’t help but think of the grubby six year old in ugly black clothes four sizes too big for him. Gods, all he’d wanted, for as long as he could remember, was for someone to love him, to show him small kindnesses. Instead, through no fault of his own, they’d hated him. He tried to force the memories away, but for a moment they swamped him. He’d been running away from Privet Drive, and from the year spent wandering in a tent, and from that last, cataclysmic battle for five years. He’d gone as far and as fast and as high as he could, using the adrenaline rush to push everything away, but it hadn’t worked. He’d almost killed himself running from it, and it hadn’t worked.
Draco sighed and pushed at Harry's head, lifting his hips from the floor to fasten his trousers. "I don't suppose we have an excuse not to." He sat up, running his fingers through his tousled hair. He looked embarrassed, and Harry was amused at the thought.
For a moment, Hermione thought the woman might cry. She sniffed, but her composure didn’t crack. Hermione was grateful she was holding herself together; she’d had a suspicion Mare had a bit of a crush on Harry from the way she lit up whenever he came down to the office, but the last thing she needed was someone to ask her assistant what was upsetting her. There were people inside of the Ministry who wouldn’t hesitate for a moment to sell any story about Harry to the
Harry glanced over at him, raising an eyebrow. “Nice try, Mate. I happen to know she ‘resisted’ for nearly four years. I’m sure that self-control is still in there somewhere.”
She nodded when she stepped back. “Do you think the Hogwarts Board of Governors will want to do a memorial for him here?”
Always one of the smartest people in the room, Pansy clasped her hands together in front of her and began to laugh. "Oh Draco, no. Seriously? Oh hell, this is just too good to be true."
“You mad cow,” he muttered, looking at the image on the card. Depicted was a beautifully built young man with dark hair, hands crossed over his groin, eyes coyly downcast. He was also wearing a large pair of heavy carved gold wings that would have fit in perfectly on the proscenium arch of the Paris Opera House. “Subtle, Pans.”
“Haven’t you ever seen a condom before?” Harry asked, genuinely curious.
For several minutes the room was silent but for the sound of their breathing.
“None of them had Malfoy blood,” Draco murmured, finally remembering the Malfoy wards.
“Or Potter Stinks badge, or Bludger to the head line-drawing, or ‘Potter’,” he impersonated Draco’s sly, drawn out tone, and Draco sighed.
Harry smiled. “Blueberry, thanks.”
“She’s doing better,” he said. “Still, if you need me during the night, don’t hesitate to come get me.”
“I'm not afraid of her,” Draco said, seeing that Mrs. Granger-Weasley was, in fact, bearing down on them like a steam engine, her jaw squared and her face determined.
Draco scowled to hide his mortification. "So you're not planning on going anywhere over break, then?" he asked, changing the subject.
He lasted exactly thirteen minutes and twenty-four seconds from the start of the lecture before he broke down and sent Harry a text, though it contained little more than a simple "miss you." Harry responded a few minutes later, saying "miss you too." A second text followed the first, accompanied by a picture of Harry lying haphazardly on what seemed to be his bed: "wish you were here."
“Leaving?” thundered Lucius. “Remember your place, boy! Rebellion has made you arrogant, and it is time you were put in your place. You cannot possibly believe you would be happy here, rubbing shoulders with commoners and groveling to those who are beneath you. I’ve built you an empire, and I will not see you squander it for some naïve, misguided sense of superiority!”
“But then I watched him execute one of my mother’s friends over some meaningless transgression without so much as flinching. His complete lack of remorse was startling. The way he walked away without a word while my mother stood witness, tears slipping down her cheeks…” Draco clenched his fists where they rested on his thighs, taking comfort in the pain radiating from the crescents his nails were carving into his palms. “He had no room in his life for trivial things like mercy and compassion. It changed my whole perception of him, and of my own life. I couldn’t become him; I didn’t
Then the previous night rushed back to him in a blur, and he released a frustrated groan, his head falling back until it thunked into his headboard.
In the process of writing this fic, I've graduated both high school and college. I've changed jobs twice, moved to a new city completely on my own, and become a published author (technically speaking). I've gone from being 4 years younger than Harry and Draco in this fic to being 4 years older than them. And throughout all of that, this fic has been by my side. It's crazy to think about how much I've changed and grown through the process of writing this fic.
Draco, however, remained awake for hours after that, too caught up in his own frantic thoughts. He wondered if the sleeplessness and its inevitable resultant exhaustion were better or worse than dreaming, night after night, of Harry slipping through his grasp. He was no closer to an answer when the sun began peeking through the window, and he chose to extricate himself from Harry’s grip rather than grapple with the question any longer.
Though it was hard to do anything on the Death Eaters’ terms given Draco still didn’t know what they were. It had been three weeks since Yaxley had confronted him, and Draco had yet to experience any fallout. Was Draco being lulled into a false sense of security, or was Lucius taking pleasure in watching Draco squirm? Draco also had to consider the possibility of Yaxley working alone. What was Yaxley’s endgame—currying favor with Lucius by returning his erstwhile son?
Potter shrugged, an easy smile back on his lips. "I told you, I'd like to take you out sometime. You obviously weren't interested so I figured hanging out as friends was the next best thing. The beer really needs no explanation."
Against all odds, Lucius lowered the weapon. “You’re right,” he said softly. But that was too easy. There had to be a catch. Draco held his breath, dreading Lucius’ next words. “If I killed him myself, you wouldn’t learn a thing.” He whirled around, his long coat whipping imperiously behind him, and approached Draco. When he was within arm’s reach, he spun the pistol in his hand and proffered it grip-first. “Kill him yourself, Draco, and perhaps I’ll be merciful when addressing your transgressions.”
"Master Lucius has sent me to bring you home," Yaxley drawled. Even without looking, Draco knew the man was smirking. Draco scowled reflexively in response. Thankfully, the irritation gave Draco an outlet for the emotional turmoil he was struggling with. Focusing entirely on the ire Yaxley inspired within him, Draco let his anger grow until he trembled with the effort of keeping his rage contained.
Draco laughed but there was no humor in the sound. "You think that now, but you have no idea. I was known as the Ice Prince back home, did you know?" he revealed. "Draco Malfoy, the heartless bastard with a perpetual stick up his ass, the emotional range of a rock, and lips that are probably cold as ice." The insults rolled easily off his tongue due to the frequency with which they'd been flung at him in the past. They didn't hurt him anymore as they once had, but perhaps they would warn Potter away.
“I’ll do you one better,” Harry offered. “Can I take you to lunch?”
Despite Draco’s best efforts, Harry’s return sent Draco’s paranoia skyrocketing. There was no telling when or where Lucius would strike, nor how or even if he would target Harry. It was Draco’s responsibility to make sure Harry didn’t get caught in the crossfire of Draco’s mistakes.
Seeing the image again sent a flurry of sense memories and images flashing through Draco's mind.
Draco’s eyes snapped open at that, and he turned to look at Harry head-on. “Is that really what you think is going on?” he asked, hardly able to believe what he’d just heard.
Draco’s incredulity lasted a scant few seconds before he had to look away to keep from being barraged with memories. But a few seconds was more time than he had ever spent looking at the Mark and feeling something other than abject terror. It was growth. It was progress. And he never would have experienced that progress had he not been forced to by a complete stranger.
At length, Harry continued. "I still don't know if I even got the part," he said with a wry chuckle. The incongruous statement forced a surprised laugh from Draco as well. "But between preparations for the funeral and transferring my care to my mum's sister, I didn't have much time to dedicate to acting. And afterwards, well," he broke off. He swallowed audibly. "Well, circumstances prevented it," he said, echoing his previous statement. His shoulders moved against Draco's in what felt like a shrug.
"In fact, I looked it up earlier," he continued breezily, ignoring the look of panic slowly settling in on Harry's face, "and I found out it was on Netflix. How convenient."
He didn’t give the Death Eaters time to react. As Lucius cried out, Draco fired three more times, and Montague, Yaxley, and Dolohov all crumpled, their own weapons falling from their hands and hitting the concrete floor with reverberating cacophony.
“Nothing permanent,” Yaxley replied, “though I can’t guarantee things will stay that way. Perhaps things would be different if you had come by this morning when I’d asked you to.”
The words hit Draco with such force that he wondered for a moment whether Lucius had shot him, though when he darted a glance toward Lucius’ holster, he found the gun still sheathed. Lucius was entirely correct; Draco had been the one to invite Harry into his life, the one to drop his guard and entangle Harry in his unresolved problems. For every moment when he had thought he might finally deserve to be happy, this moment was proving him utterly, irrevocably wrong.
But he needn't have worried. "Then we'll cross those bridges when we get to them," Potter said dismissively. "Anyway, if you're agreeing to this, then you should call me Harry, right?" His eyes were bright, and he wore an infectious, easy grin that had Draco instinctively grinning in response. Pot-
The taller one puffed her chest in indignance and angrily opened her mouth to say something, but her friend stopped her before she could by placing a hand on her arm.
They spent much of the first week cuddling together underneath layers of blankets to block out the cold, moving only when one of the two had to go to work or run errands. The days blurred together, passing by in a haze of falling into each other with complete abandon. In want of something to do, their snogging sessions grew increasingly common and heated in equal measures, until Draco reckoned he had mapped every inch of Harry's skin with his lips, and Harry had done the same to Draco.
Draco closed his eyes. It was easier than trying to meet Harry’s gaze without feeling guilty. He clenched the fingers of his right hand around his left arm, his grip so tight that he knew he’d find bruises there in the morning. It was what he deserved, he supposed. “I do trust you,” he said, injecting as much sincerity into his voice as he could. “I trust you, but I can’t involve you in this. I’m telling you things will be okay. Don’t you trust

“About why you weren’t an Auror.”
Ordinarily he was very fond of the view from his third floor windows. He lived in the top floor of what had once been a very high-end townhouse, in a neighbourhood that wasn’t what it had once been but was still well above middle class. The townhouses, butted up one right against the next, were situated on a wide avenue with a delightful courtyard down the center. A fountain with a statue of a slender Victorian girl had been drained of water for the winter, and bike racks down each side sported dozens of bicycles. One of them, the black racing bike straight across from the etched leaded glass door that led to the main stairs, even belonged to him. He found riding most of the year bracing, and it helped to keep him in shape to ride the five miles to his job at the Muggle pharmacy. In winter, however, it was mostly just too bloody cold. It was time to bring the bike in, he knew, but dreaded hauling it up the three flights to his entryway.
Scorpius shrugged. “Just thought I’d drop by and make sure you were eating right.” He frowned slightly as he studied his father’s face. “Which, you aren’t. You’re too thin.”
"No idea," Harry admitted, and she made a sound of exasperation.
“Thank you,” Harry murmured.
“Yes, you will,” he and Hermione said in unison, and she turned to him with a smile.
The apprehension Draco felt was no longer a misgiving, but a rush of fear. "What?"
to go, I’m sorry.” She angled her head thoughtfully. “I think, if I were you, instead of working myself up into a right snit and trying to avoid being in the same room with him,” she paused, “I’d be backing him into a corner and making him tell me what it was, or
“Is that…?” she murmured, turning her face, a slight smile pulling at her lips.
“We’ll take four.”
They had lived at Harry’s for the first two years they’d been together, but the Weasley clan, including the ex, had been entirely too comfortable just popping through the Floo. That problem had been solved when Lily and Scorpius had moved in together - even though Harry had been less than thrilled by the idea, they’d both been in school and broke, and he’d allowed them to move into the house.
“’Bye,” he’d murmured, his soft voice wistful. Gods, if they’d just been smarter back then, and braver. But they hadn’t been, and the next Monday he’d left for his residency on Ginger, forcing himself not to pine. It hadn’t been easy. And if he was honest, the scene replayed in his daydreams. Often. According to Hermione, Malfoy was now teaching Transfiguration at Hogwarts and had been in a relationship with a wizard who had been working at Gringotts, but it had ended a few months ago. And Harry, to her consternation, went from man to man, wanting a long-term relationship but not finding the right person. Jory had been the best of his stream of lovers, but Harry couldn’t even make it work with him. For the last few months he’d remained single, and it was a good choice; he was much happier that way; Hermione said she believed he was so picky he was making it impossible for any man to live up to his unfeasible standards. He countered that he merely knew what he wanted. Or so he kept telling himself.
“No, just my number one fan going a bit overboard,” he answered, attempting to lighten his tone. Ernie wasn’t the brightest torch on the wall, but he wasn’t completely stupid.
“Oh, you bloody poser.”
“And a jacket,” Harry added.
“Fine. Relax, Weaslebee,” he drawled. “We won’t abuse your tender sensibilities any further.”
"Harry, it's only one o'clock. What's going on?"
Draco reached for the brandy snifter sitting in a candle lit warmer at his elbow and watched the pages of the newspaper curl in on themselves with a certain amount of satisfaction. The picture reappeared as page one turned into a tube of ash, and the second page went the way of the first, fire slowly eating away at the glamorous, white smile until it disappeared and crumbled to dust. Draco took a sip of the fine, warmed amber liquor, enjoying the heat as it moved over his palate and down his throat. As long as he could burn the pictures to dust, he supposed he could deal with seeing them occasionally.
“Now who’s charming.” Hermione wrinkled her nose.
“What a bloody rotter,” Ron said finally. “What’s up his arse sideways?”
“You’ve got to try these biscuits, Draco,” Mr Frombley said, removing the rubber gloves he’d been wearing to mix a child’s cough syrup and scuttling into his office. “They are truly brilliant.”
“Scolding in stereo,” Ron quipped, grabbing another cookie from the three tiered server. “Lucky me.”
“J. W. I. is Juvenile Wizarding Influenza,” she answered absently. “It isn’t necessarily serious, but it’s nasty business. Lasts several days, causes upper respiratory distress and high fevers. And Freddie’s is the orphanage George started in Fred’s honor…” She began to chew her thumbnail.
Harry felt a surge of alarm. “What’s wrong with it?”
“You mean, ‘who vomited up Christmas’?” Draco said wryly.
spell targeted to specific people. I intend to do some research, but I encountered nothing like this in my spell reversals or mind-altering study divisions. If it’s what we think, this is very unusual magic.”
“Thanks.” Harry smiled at him shyly, and Draco was completely charmed by a naked Harry Potter looking shy. “Allow me to return the compliment.”
As if he were being blown along by a force of nature, faintly alarmed at the prospect of George’s crackers, Harry was propelled to a flight of stairs that apparently led to the kitchen.
“Care for a dozen?” Draco answered, and he heard Potter laugh.
They both stared. “Well, if it does look like that, it's lovely.”
"I will fucking hex you," Draco burst out finally. Harry fought the absurd impulse to laugh. He decided he'd made Draco wait long enough.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Ron.” Hermione forced herself to slow slightly, even as her neck craned as she searched for the people who were supposed to be waiting for them. Finally, she saw them waiting near the lifts; a middle-aged gentleman in lovely pewter gray robes that for some unaccountable reason reminded her of Draco Malfoy. It certainly wasn’t his bearing or his hair; he wasn’t tall, and his hair was black. At his side he saw Ms. Carrilon, several inches taller than her superior, her hair a brilliant red beacon in the soft lighting.
Using his teeth, Potter grabbed the elastic waistband of his pants, and pulling out and away, freed his throbbing cock. Draco panted loudly as Potter studied the revealed erection, then smiled slowly and curled his hand around it.
"Oh, now that's just over-achieving," Draco shot back, clearly enjoying himself.
Harry Potter walked along the pristine, deserted beach, the sand warm beneath his bare feet, the stunning expanse of sky above dotted with occasional fluffy clouds. In the distance across a stretch of brilliant azure blue water he could see the coast of Tortola, one of the largest of the cluster of Islands. The beach where he stood was on Ginger Island, one of the last so-called ‘uninhabited' islands in the British Virgin Islands. But it wasn't uninhabited; not at all. It was merely charmed to look that way to the outside world.
“Oi!” Ron complained. She glared at him, then turned an expectant look on Harry.
"Why?"
Lily frowned slightly. “What makes you think that?”
“Something like it,” Hermione offered. “Perhaps partnered with a sophisticated
“And doing something because a lunatic threatened your family isn’t the same as doing it because you think it’s the right thing!”
“I don’t think so.” Draco frowned. There was something important he should remember, but it was just out of his reach. “It’s honestly been so long since I was around much magic, I’d mostly forgot about that.”
“Malfoy, this isn’t your room, is it? I won’t put you out of your room.”
Draco kissed the smile away, free hand coming up to clutch black hair as he pressed his hips forward, thrilling in the feeling of Harry’s knee against him.
Draco didn’t bother to correct this mistake. They’d been trying for months to get ‘Weasley’ right, without success and Draco decided it wasn’t worth the headache.
Malfoy studied him, one mobile brow arching. "You want to ask
“You’re beautiful,” Harry breathed.
“Imagine my surprise,” a smooth, refined voice that was the female version of Draco’s said, “when I looked out of my study window and saw two supposedly grown men pelting one another with snowballs. Now I find the same two grown men, dripping water onto my Aubusson.”
Just when Harry thought that Draco might have dozed off, and he was in danger of doing the same, Draco shifted until his lips were near Harry’s ear.
Hermione blinked. It suddenly sounded like wind, rushing through her ears and though the Carrilon woman’s lips were moving, Hermione didn’t hear a word.
Harry hoped Ron would speak to him again.
Harry grimaced. “No, Ernie’s married. His wife is expecting their first.”
Harry whipped his head around and saw Draco entering the room, carrying another two enormous sacks. He set them down near the two already by Molly, then ran his fingers through his hair, attempting to straighten the wind-blown strands. Harry wished he’d leave it alone; he liked the ‘just got out of bed, tousled’ look. Draco’s cheeks were pink from the cold, and he sent Harry a quick, tentative look from beneath his lashes.
“Clara.” Draco spoke softly, his eyes darting toward Harry. When he caught his wry grin, he glared. For some reason, that only increased Harry’s desire to laugh.
He let his head flop back on his pillow. “I’m not even sure. I think I implied he didn’t care enough about people to be a Healer.”
Harry could feel cool gray eyes on him, too, and he pushed the dark thoughts away.
“Come on,” he called. “Come out.”
Hermione shot him a dark look and elbowed him sharply in the ribs.
“I’d like to, very much,” Potter answered, and Draco immediately reached behind himself in blind search of the doorknob. “Which is exactly why I’m not going to.”
Draco cupped his palms around his glass. “I’d be willing to bet you already know some of the background.”
“Scorpius brought him to my flat for dinner not long after the beginning of this term.” His eyes widened. “I hope I haven’t got him trouble.”
“You will,” Draco’s eyes warmed as he stretched out on the bed, his head resting on the palm of his hand. “Tomorrow night. I’d like for them to be a surprise.”
Prompt for this part:
The door closed behind Hermione and her daughter, and Draco smiled wearily. They engaged in the same exchange about her last name every time they saw one another. The day they didn’t, he’d know something was terribly wrong.
Body tight with nervous energy, Harry paced the room, opening drawers and closets, finding the Gideon bible in a bedside table and a plush white terry-cloth robe hanging inside a massive wardrobe. The room service menu was in the top middle drawer of an elegant desk, and Harry sat in the chair facing it, studying the offerings, knowing he was about to charge a meal to the Ministry account he had no desire to eat. Oliver's chef's meal sat uncomfortably in his stomach, and he wished he'd eaten nothing at all. Over-coming his qualms, he waited until two after ten to dial the phone.
“Adrian’s mother?”
Harry couldn’t help the grin that curved his lips as he watched Adrian jet across his lush, green lawn, followed moments later by his tall, willowy grandfather.
“Never fear, Weasley,” he said, affecting his laziest drawl.  “Potter nearly knocked me into the street not five minutes ago.  What is it with you Gryffindors?  You’re a public hazard.”  He shot Harry a quick look, and found the green eyes on his face, a frown between them.  “Seriously, I’m following him, harassing him unmercifully until he willingly buys me coffee to make it up to me.”  Draco tried to step away, but Potter’s hand tightened around his elbow.  “It’s all right,” he murmured.
“I'm a wizard,” Draco answered, giving the child a pointed look.  Potter laughed.
He did. He still didn’t want her so close, just in case. “Where’s your mum, honey?”
"Sorry," Harry repeated, stroking Draco's lower back. "Stay there. I'll be right back."
, you idiot.”
“Fair enough.”
“Aren’t you going to wait for Giles?”
"Well, there's something to look forward to." He thought he would probably put it in his school trunk where he kept his memorabilia; it was where he saved the Snitch Dumbledore left him, the words
Draco backed away, then turned and walked out of the room.
She sniffed. "You know I don't tell you how to live your life, Harry."
"Potter. He's here."
“I’m not sure, okay?” Harry knew he sounded a bit like a desperate mad man, but he didn’t care. His palms were damp and his heart was racing and he needed fresh air. In some place, some alternate reality, he was married to Draco Malfoy, they had twin boys and were even now meeting their new baby daughter.
“Oh.” She took a step back. “Whimsy will go upstairs until…”
Malfoy snorted and again, Harry had to bite his lip to stop a burst of inopportune giggles.
But then, that look, on that face, always had gotten his juices going.
Harry stared at him. “I don’t like the direction this is going. Is Scorpius all right?”
Harry looked at the wand in his hand, then up into his eyes. All he saw was a legitimate desire to help.  Finally, he nodded. Draco’s full lips pulled into a slight smile.
He nodded, eyeing her wand as it neared his face. Harry bit back a snort when his eyes crossed as Hermione’s wand touched his forehead. He looked over at Draco, and was charmed to see his small smile.
Harry frowned at him. "I insisted you be here, Draco. I'm not the only one in those photos."
Harry bit his lower lip. "No, I'm very interested. Maybe just a bit cautious."
And the pygmy puff, inked to his pale skin between his hip and his groin, purred.
Ron straightened and stilled at the same time, which was something of an accomplishment. He turned slowly. "Malfoy," he said, just this side of civil.
She had returned the kitchen to its ‘pre-Malfoy invasion’ configuration, and after all of the time he’d put in to get it perfect during the remodel, he now thought it looked weird. Even knowing what he would find, Harry went upstairs to check in the guest rooms and of course, they were immaculate; bedding washed and put back on the beds, floors scrubbed until they shown, fresh vivid purple lilacs in vases on the nightstands. The lilac bushes in his garden weren’t in bloom yet, so he could only assume they’d come from the Manor hot house.
Harry leaned his hand against the doorframe, his hip cocked to the side. “You’re hilarious. Open the door and let me in, you wanker.”
Harry felt the color drain from his face; he’d never considered the idea that Draco might say anything other than yes, but now that Ron mentioned it –
“Apologies, Harry Potter.” For once in his life apparently Dobby realized he’d interrupted something. “But the Headmistress would like for me to tell you that it’s your turn to be touring the courtyard?”
Her eyes softened on his. “Oh, Draco. That doesn’t mean anything.”
“I’m sorry, sir,” the elderly welcome witch was saying, her face a picture of prim disapproval, “but I cannot give out any information on whether or not someone is a patient here. I have been familiar,” her disdain could not have been more obvious, “with the Malfoy family since I was a girl, and you are not a Malfoy.”
Harry sat back in the chair again, rocking slightly, his lips curling up at the corner.  “I'm thinking this might be the year to go.  Tell her I'd like two tickets, will you?”
“I may never be able to look at presents under a Christmas tree again for the rest of my life without getting hard.”
“I like their names,” Megan replied dreamily. “They’re so romantic.”
Aaron’s eyes brightened. “Oh, cool. I’ve never been anywhere outside the country. I’ll need to get a passport, and you’ll have to help me with airfare, but I can’t wait to see where you grew up. Will I meet your family? That would be so…” His excited chatter finally stalled when he seemed to realize Harry wasn’t contributing to the conversation. He studied his eyes, his face falling. “Oh,” he murmured. “Oh. I… see.”
The room was warm, and Harry wanted to lean into it, to join what looked like the happy family on the couch. Faintly, he could smell popcorn. Inexplicably drawn closer, he took a tentative step, just enough that he could look down on the heads of the people attached to the socks. All boys, they wore thick jeans and colorful jumpers. Two of the kids had curly black hair, and one, the oldest on the end, was sporting blue hair that matched his socks.
“There are
“For heaven’s sakes,
“Mr Draco Malfoy requests an audience with the Headmaster,” the little animal said in Draco’s smooth, upper crust voice. Harry quickly set the plate aside.
"Ronald, stop it," Hermione said, easily grabbing the collar of his robes and stopping him. "He's just winding you up, like he always has. Sit down and be quiet."
"I do," she said, pugnacious jaw hard. "It's at the very least an invasion of your privacy. It's extortion. It's blackmail. It's… It's…" Her hand was trembling in his, and he knew Ron had to feel it.
Harry was grinning as the Floo went dark.
The Dursley’s small row house was still empty. Using a muttered Alohomora, Harry broke in through the back door. The electricity had been turned off, but enough light filtered in through the uncovered windows that he could make his way through the shadowy house without Lumos. Someone had finally cleaned out his bedroom; now it was just a small, empty space, the bars gone from the one window. He could hear the echo of Hedwig’s soft insistent hoots in the room, and it made his eyes burn. He’d never had time to grieve for her, and now it was like a crushing weight. Staggering down the stairs, he stood in the entry way and looked around vacantly, wondering what in hell he’d hoped to find. Then he caught sight of the door that led to the cupboard beneath the stairs, and he opened it, not expecting to anything to be left there, either.
Hermione had finally lost her patience. “What sort of mistake,” she ordered in a firm voice. “The lot of you have done nothing but talk around it since I was first notified of a problem. I want to know what’s been done, by whom, and I want to know right now!” She didn’t stomp her foot, but it was a close thing. Ron squeezed her hand.
Instinctively, Draco angled his hips forward. “Because they are completely wicked.” He paused, his voice lowering. “The scones are as light as a cloud, and taste of sunshine and crisp autumn mornings. This tastes like late nights and after dinner cognac before a roaring fire, and long looks full of sensuous promise followed by a short trip right into bed. In short, they taste like sex in a fluted golden cup.”
Draco shuddered dramatically. “Even they aren’t that cruel.”
Harry turned his attention to the baby waving her little arms. “I see you, Miss Marnie. Did you think I was ignoring you?” He slipped his hands around her wiggly little body, lifting her to his shoulder and pressing a kiss to her forehead. She patted his face with her soft little hands. Draco sat forward to stand, and Harry situated the baby in the crook of his elbow before reaching out and catching Draco’s hand, tugging slightly as Draco stood. He grimaced and paused to rub his lower back.
“Bad?” she touched his arm, concerned.
The end
He wanted to go slow, to make love to his partner and not just fuck him, but Harry had missed this as much as Draco had and wrapped his free leg around Draco’s waist, changing the angle that Draco’s cock pressed inside of him. Harry cried out, his head going back, his fingers digging into Draco’s arse.
Kingsley chuckled. “I think you over state my effect on the three-year-old vote.”
Harry looked up at her then, a slight smile quirking his lips.  “Just in case, eh?”
“Yes, yes,” Draco said quickly, heading her off before she could build up a head of steam. “Pansy,” he turned his eyes back to hers. “Have you room for another at your table this evening?”
“Too late,” Potter managed, sounding as if he were speaking through clenched teeth, and Draco looked into his face in time to see his eyes clench shut and his mouth drop open on a silent cry. The powerful body above him shuddered, and Draco felt a sweeping tenderness as he tightened his fingers around Potter’s hand, holding it steady as he thrust erratically through their joined fingers. He felt a warm, wet splash on his wrist and the back of his hand, and wrapped his arm around Potter’s shoulders when he collapsed against his chest.
Draco closed his eyes, a vision of Potter as he was now superimposed on the inside of his eyelids. Potter had always seemed short to Draco, shorter than he was at least, but now they were almost eye to eye. His hair looked windblown and there was tawny color on his skin, and his eyes were such a vivid green Draco wondered how he could have forgotten for even a moment how luminescent they were. And his body; the dark hooded sweatshirt he wore showed quite clearly how broad his shoulders had become, and his hips were narrow, his thighs sturdy looking in the fitted jeans. He hadn’t allowed himself to stare at the front of the faded jeans, but he’d wanted to. Gods, how he’d wanted to.
The last week before everything fell apart had seemed so…normal. He’d gone to work, Draco had spent his days at the Manor in his lab. He’d been working on a stronger version of wolfsbane serum for testing at St. Mungo’s; Greyback was dead, but many of his ‘offspring’ were still at large, and none of them deserved their fate. Harry thought that he was so dedicated to it because of Teddy; he wanted to be able to remove the stain of lycanthropy before the child was old enough to understand what it meant, what his father had been. He’d been working long hours, and in retrospect, he’d seemed a bit ‘odd’ a few days before.
Harry had never seen Draco so off his usual reserve, and he smiled. “Is this a job interview?”
“Well, there’s no Auror with them, so you should be all right. Chin up, lad,” he said bracingly. “I’m right behind you, and I won’t let them take you anywhere.”
Harry fought a smile and lay very still. He wasn’t used to having his bedroom invaded in the morning, at least not by a four year old. But he was in her house, after all.
Harry scooted to the edge of the bed, his hands dragging through his hair. “Yeah, yeah. Hermione informs me I’m definitely more articulate since you moved in. Are you done primping?”
Despite himself, Draco was helpless but to follow.
Pressing a hand covertly against Harry's lower back, Draco pushed him away from the cafe and towards the tube. "We're going back to my dorm," he told Harry firmly. Harry only nodded once, shakily, his eyes downcast, and continued shuffling in the direction Draco had directed him.
"You're not getting anything?" Harry asked Draco as they joined the queue for the register so Harry could purchase the myriad items he was juggling.
Draco made a decision. It was just one date, after all. And here, so far from his father's influence and the bloodied skeletons rattling in his closet, Draco couldn't justify letting fear dictate his life. Potter was right; he was only refusing to take this plunge because he was afraid. But Draco was done being afraid.
"I'll be waiting," Harry said flirtatiously.
Draco let them come. Emotional distance was just what he needed right now. Potter had the vexing ability to bodily drag Draco's emotions from the cage wherein he had confined them long ago. His unflinching honesty had wormed past all of Draco's defenses. When had Draco last met such a sincere person? He couldn't remember. His life had been so full of lies and deceit that it was all he knew.
*unending screaming*
Around the age of 16, I realized that in order to write this fic properly, I should probably plot out the narrative arc and major events. So I wrote out a 2-page outline, with notes for what would happen in each chapter. Some of these notes were quite detailed, and some even included dialogue so fleshed out that it ended up in the final draft nearly verbatim.
Harry pulled out one of the stools and glanced over at Malfoy as he sat. Malfoy still held the paper, but he watched as Adrian very carefully cut his pancakes into small pieces. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen a three-year-old so precise. His kids certainly hadn’t been; when they’d eaten pancakes, there’d been as much on them as in them. Harry smiled slightly at the memory, then glanced over in time to see Malfoy’s tender expression as he watched his grandson.
"Why?" he asked Hermione, his voice louder than he meant for it to be. Justin, Hannah, and poor Marta, who visibly jumped at his volume, turned to stare at him. Ordinarily, he would have the good sense to apologize and then pretend to listen. But right then, he just couldn't be arsed to. "Why the fuck should I listen to them, when they can't be bothered to listen to each other? Justin, is this or is this not the same shite you were peddling on Friday?"
He might as well have been invisible.
It was a welcome surprise to find them clean, if a little clammy. Draco heaved a sigh of relief. He collapsed back into bed without bothering to turn off the light. A quick glance at the clock resting next to the lamp told him it was just past 5:00 in the morning - too late to try to fall back asleep. Draco rubbed his eyes instead of dragging himself out of bed, trying to prolong the inevitable.
His hands stopped their movements a second later when Draco suddenly remembered that it was already Christmas Day and he hadn't managed to buy Harry a present. He briefly contemplated the merits of staying in bed all day and ignoring reality in the hope that it would cease to exist, but the fragments of the previous night's nightmare that still danced behind his eyelids spurred him into action.
He left the flat in a hurry, barely pausing to wrap a scarf around his neck and lock the flat behind him, desperately hoping that the Christmas crowds hadn't stripped the shops bare quite yet.
Draco released an explosive sigh. "Obviously it wasn't nothing," Draco bit out. "You wouldn't be sitting here shaking if it had been nothing." He clenched and unclenched his hands helplessly, trying to find a release for the frustration he felt that didn't result in using Harry as a target. Breathing in deeply, he forced himself to calm down. "Tell me what happened," he beseeched, his voice soft with desperation. "Let me help you, you arrogant git. I can't do that if I don't know what's wrong."
Harry only laughed, the sound much louder than was probably appropriate in a bookshop, and that was when the appearance an aggravated employee prompted them to flee the bookshop as well for fear they would be ejected for their unruly behavior.
Draco stood up abruptly, dropping his empty beer bottle carelessly on the floor and stifling a yawn. "I'm tired. I'm heading to bed. Feel free to see yourself out." He knew the words were harsh, and he could only imagine what Potter thought of his unexpected change in personality, but he was too shaken to care. He trudged unsteadily to his bed, falling onto the covers without bothering to change. He closed his eyes the moment his head touched the pillow, glad that sleep would come soon and wipe away the guilt that plagued him.
Lucius raised an eyebrow. “Yaxley,” he called out. Draco suppressed a flinch at the sudden increase in volume. “Is that what you saw?”
“But you aren’t okay now!” Harry exclaimed, voice rising in volume. “Why are you hiding this from me? Why don’t you trust me?”
Draco stumbled on the pavement. He grabbed Harry's arm to steady himself, then used the grip to force Harry to face him once he was upright again. "You can't be serious," he said faintly.
On the other hand, my notes for chapter 12 were, in their entirety, "Breakup :D". I've spent a depressing amount of time staring at that one word and wishing I could go back in time to wring some more information out of my past self.
When he put it that way, what choice did Draco have?
The carriage doors had long closed behind them when Draco turned to Harry and said, "Let me know how much the rent is; I'll cover it. I wouldn't dream of imposing you for so long without recompense."
Draco heard Yaxley shoulder through the trees and waited for the older man to stop moving before he spoke. "Why are you here?" he asked, his back to Yaxley. He squared his shoulders and drew himself to his full height, drawing on every lesson his father had given him on portraying authority to disguise his horror behind a stony facade.
Comments are adored. Pls pls pls leave a comment, even if it's just a few words! I'll love you forever if you do.
A bright yellow sticky note caught Draco's eye from where it was plastered to his desk, the non-adhesive side lifting slightly from the wooden surface. Draco made his way across the room and peeled the note off so he could read it.
When they finally curled into each other an hour later, drowsiness slowly creeping upon them, Draco carefully pulled away from Harry to make his way to the couch. He had barely gone a step before Harry caught his wrist to pull him back.
"Did you think you could run forever?"
With a violent shudder, Draco pushed the memories back. Harry dropped a gentle kiss to Draco's lips, and Draco lost himself in the sensation for a moment. All of a sudden, his breath seemed to rattle too harshly in the stagnant silence permeating the flat, broken only by the quiet hum of the traffic outside.
If you've made it this far, or if you clicked on that "new chapter" email and decided to give this fic another shot, thank you so much for joining me on this journey! Happy reading :)
Draco glanced at Harry but looked away immediately, unable to handle the helplessness etched on Harry’s face. “It’s nothing. I’ll be okay,” he said resolutely.
"Excuse me, have you seen Harry Potter come through here?" the shorter one asked.
to be him. So I applied for university in secret, got my affairs in order, and left in the dead of night just before first term.
Draco walked away with a smile on his face.
Draco could only stare blankly at the weapon in Lucius’ hand. His mouth was dry, his hands clammy, and his mind full of static as he tried to process what Lucius had just said. Lucius gestured again for Draco to take the gun, and the action galvanized Draco into snatching it away. At the very least, Lucius couldn’t cause immediate harm if Draco had his weapon.
“I love it,” he said sincerely. Harry’s answering smile left Draco breathless.
The one thing he couldn’t control, however, was the nightmares, and soon Draco’s reassurances weren’t enough for Harry. The brunette turned the light on and sat up after the sixth night Draco had woken them both up, a serious look settling in his green eyes. “Please tell me what’s wrong, Draco,” Harry asked, voice tinged with desperation. “I’m your boyfriend, let me help you. I care about you, and I’m worried. Please.”
Briefly, Draco wondered why he was trying to push Potter away in the first place. What would be so bad about letting him in? Potter certainly seemed as though he knew the meaning of discretion, and he acted like he was genuinely interested in Draco. Selfishly, Draco tried to convince himself that it would be fine to see where things went with Potter.
“Sit the fuck down,” Harry said.
Draco's phone buzzed a few minutes later, just as he was settling back into bed to sleep for another hour or two. He thumbed open the notification to see that he had received a text from Harry reading "Left your present under the tree; do NOT open until Christmas day. I will know if you do." Horror dawned on him as he realized that, caught up in Harry and the holiday spirit as he had been, he had completely forgotten to buy Harry a present.
Harry visibly bristled. His hand flew to his scar, and though he immediately disguised the gesture by brushing his fringe out of his eyes, the action only served to confirm Draco's suspicions that the incident in the cafe was connected to Harry's scar. "It was nothing," Harry said finally, still avoiding Draco's gaze. He took a breath to add something, but hesitated at the last second and seemed to decide against it.
And then there was the hand, palm slick, fingers scrabbling around Harry’s wrist to hold on as tightly as he could.
