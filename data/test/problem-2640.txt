“Out. I want to go out. I have a fake.” Harry began rummaging through his things and then stopped. “Right. Guess it won’t work with having a different face and all.” He looked deflated as he sat back on his bed.
“I missed you too, Jamie,” she said, turning to Harry and smiling. “You’ve done a good job with him so far. Look at how strong his magic is.”
“I’ll be back next week to check in. Don’t hesitate to Floo if there’s trouble.”
you piss off to the middle of nowhere like you’re some sorry version of Robin Hood?’ Very clever, didn’t think you knew Robin Hood.”
Sirius pulled himself up to his full height as he said, “Could you do this favor for the literal savior of the Wizarding World? He needs rest and he’s not going to get it on a loud hospital wing where reporters can sneak in.”
“This is going to blow up in your face, Seer,” Remus pointed out.
a Malfoy. I can’t imagine being hired by anyone, much less the best hospital in Britain.” It stung to recognize that, and Draco felt the bile rise to his throat as he considered his future.
“I’m not concerned with what’s fair, only safety.”
“Oh, you have company,” he said, voice sounding a little downtrodden. He then realized who Draco’s company was and looked a bit nervous as he said, “Oh, hey guys.”
Draco willed himself to put on his Malfoy mask once more.
"Did you regret the words or that they came out?" At Draco's non-answer, Remus heaved a sigh. "It will get better, Draco."
He wiped at his face and when he pulled his hand back, he saw it was covered in blood. He stared at it in confusion—where did that come from? He was beginning to feel a more lightheaded at the sight of the blood and shook his head in an attempt to stay with it. He looked up to see himself surrounded by Healers, eyes wide and staring down at him. “Don’t worry, he’s fine,” he said, before promptly passing out.
“Like Harry’s remnant?”
Remus clapped his hands together after letting James go. “Brilliant.”
“Bad night,” Harry remarked, looking away.
“Draco said he was
“The wives tales spread about what I do are ridiculous. I don’t steal children. I save them from orphanhood or aggressive and abusive situations. Your dear professor’s father might have said horrid things about our condition but his wife also had an abusive streak. I wanted to help him, not ruin his life.” Draco looked down, heat rising to his cheeks. “I’ll see you in a bit. Don’t hide in here all day.” And with that, Fenrir stormed out. Draco felt doomed.
He supposed she was right. How much longer did he really think he could avoid them? He’d have to leave eventually. “Okay.” Gathering as much Gryffindor courage he could muster, he rose from the sheets, eyes downcast in order to not read their reactions. He heard the soft gasps however, and he flinched as though he were struck by the noise.
James just laughed. Harry was happy to realize he had inherited his own laughter from him. At least that was something they could still share genetically. “If you say so, Hare.”
Harry’s nose wrinkled at the mention of tea. “I’m feeling a bit queasy, honestly. Water?”
Harry rolled his eyes but nonetheless stayed put and let Draco drift off on him.
Blaise sighed, as though he had been waiting for this question to come for some time. He was able to skirt around the question when he first arrived and had attempted to steer the conversation away from the subject again. And he had been doing well at it—the two only really spoke about Quidditch, Draco’s healing magic progress, and what might be happening at Hogwarts as of late. “It didn’t feel right to go into hiding. I miss my parents so much but now is not a time for neutrality, you know?” he replied.
There were nights that he felt he couldn’t breathe properly. These nights generally included accidentally catching himself in the mirror and being startled by Sirius staring back at him. It felt as though there was something standing on his throat. It was enough to make his skin crawl involuntarily. Those nights, he would knock on Draco or Ron’s door after imbibing with something from Seamus’s stash, not daring to chance it with Hermione. Most of the time they let him in; other times they weren’t so welcoming.
“Oh I dunno,” Remus responded sarcastically, “maybe sneaking out of bed past hours and not letting anyone know where you were.”
One day Draco decided to join him, plopping down next to the Black Heir as he watched the giant squid wave from afar. “Hey,” he said.
“Alright, alright,” Harry held up his hands in defeat, “You don’t have to bark at me,” he quipped, heading towards the highly ornate wardrobe in the corner of the bedroom.
Harry grabbed his hands again, squeezing them tightly. “This is why you need to stay here and be safe. I miss you every single day. I was being apparated away in Malfoy Manor and all I could think about is you. I saw your mum’s face and all I could focus on was wondering how you were doing. The thoughts were so strong I circumvented House Elf magic and warped it to my needs subconsciously. If I don’t have you to return to, I will die.”
“Really?” The blonde’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline. He wasn’t expecting that.
“Would it be alright if I hugged you? I know we’re not that touchy but—”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t have much to go off of so I think you’re good. Can I see Dad today? I think it would make me feel better.”
Draco matched his sire’s frown with one of his own, feeling discomfort at the situation at hand. “I suppose I should thank you if I was apparently on death’s door. I know Remus couldn’t bring himself to re-turn me but we all knew that was what was required.”
The blonde just nodded, feeling a bit helpless. The anxiety suddenly rolled back in waves, crashing over his prior calm. He had to know everything, now. “What else? Who else?
“He what, Rem?” Sirius was becoming more concerned by the minute. If he inherited the mental health issues of both himself and James, Harry would need all of the support he could get. Sirius squeezed Remus’s hand gently when he noticed his distress. “You’ve been doing a brilliant job keeping it together for both Harry and Draco. I know it’s been a little off the rails. What happened?”
Regulus laughed. “Do I know who Harry Potter is, are you kidding me?”
Ron sat at the edge of his bed. He sighed heavily at the sight of a once strong Harry clearly defeated and out of control. “You’re not trying very hard, mate.”
Harry kneeled in front of him, taking his hands in his own. “Draco, look at me,” he said. The blonde slowly met his eyes, tears overflowing again. “There is nothing you can do that would make me want to leave you, alright?” He kissed his hands gently. “Nothing.”
Sirius was looking over at Harry in concern, noting the piece of toast being nursed in his grasp. Harry nodded. “I’m fine. Had a rough night but nothing that an afternoon nap can’t fix.”
“It’s fine—just leave the curtains closed.”
“So you
“I don’t know where to go from here,” Harry confessed when he was released. “Dad wants me to hide away, I think.”
Draco replied sarcastically, wishing he had lied about taking care of himself.
Remus looked at him in concern. “Are you okay?” he asked, “you look pale.”
Sirius rolled his eyes. “Oh don’t torture him, Jamie. You know werewolves mate for life.”
Blaise tried to not flinch at the obvious display of controlled wandless magic, opting for some Slytherin coolness: “A Potter apology? In this lifetime?”
“I thought Slytherins were all about solitude.”
Draco shook his head. “Nah, that’s okay. I’m tired from travelling.” He closed his eyes. Molly began to shoo everyone from the room. “It’s okay Mrs. Weasley,” he said. “I actually like the noise. It was dreadfully quiet at St. Mungo’s.”
“He’s fine. He’s resting, too. You’ll see him soon.”
Harry grimaced in response. “No thanks, Hermione.” He then disappeared up the stairs.
“Remus promised to catch me up later but I wanted to say hello. You two can stay in these rooms if you want. I can camp out in Regulus’s room. Next door. Hearing everything the two of you might be getting up to, mind.”
Harry sighed and put down the dried tarantulas he was working with. “Not exactly.”
“Well that depends,” Remus countered, “have you been taking your Wolfsbane?”
Harry huffed out a breathless laugh. “Me too. They put a dampner on me though and it’s making me feel like I’m walking through water. My magic is really volatile, they said, and I can’t get better if my magic keeps creating barriers for me.”
Draco shrugged. “I dunno. But I always felt wrong when I’d be spiteful towards Granger or anyone deemed different. I don’t believe you should be judged on your blood status: it should be about abilities. Your side doesn’t stand for that.”
“Me either. And I’ll have a lot to say to him when he crosses. I’m just glad you have Seer now, even if I can’t be around.” James looked a bit downtrodden at that. It made Harry’s heart swell in a bit of despair.
Draco looked up to see James heading towards the duo. He still couldn’t believe that he was among the living once more, the same age he was on that fateful night all those years ago: the Potters truly had nine lives, Draco was convinced. “Morning, Mr. Potter,” he said with a grin, knowing just how to wind him up.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut at the confirmation, willing tears back. The bedside table began to rattle some. Sirius just squeezed his hand gently. “I didn’t want you to know. I didn’t want you to be disappointed in me.”
A quiet knock was heard on the door. “Please go away,” Harry voiced this time, trying to get a grip on his emotions.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t know His name was Tabooed. It was my fault.”
“Why wouldn’t they put him on a potions regimen?”
Harry’s eyebrows got lost in his fringe at that. “Well that’s news to me. What does that even mean, full heritage?”
Draco perked up at that. “I miss them and the village in general. Life is slower there.”
He left Draco then, allowing him to wallow in his own misery. How did he get so far in his life being so self-righteous and horrible? He felt ill thinking about the way he just moved through the world, not really showing interest or understanding to anyone around him. And yet here he was, being cared for as if he had never been terrible to Potter and his friends – it seemed to be forgotten. Draco vowed to not burden Remus, or anyone for that matter, anymore. While he was mulling about in self pity, his ears picked up a conversation just beyond the door. Still not used to his new super hearing, Draco could not tune the voices out. It was Remus and Jack. They were talking about him.
Sirius frowned, looking ahead towards the door rather than at his son. “I was betrothed to Draco’s dad when I was younger. He hated everything that made me me and was content with trying to beat it out of me. He hit me a lot.”
“Well there’s always tomorrow.”
“Well I’ve only had her to speak to as of late.”
“So, what is He telling you in this dream?”
McGonagall scoffed at Dumbledore. “Albus this seems to be well-beyond schoolboy antics: he’s coping with grief in a very destructive way. We should get a Mind Healer in to see him.”
Healer Markus frowned. “We need to set your arm and monitor it. You are also suffering from magical exhaustion—you really should be at the hospital.”
“Everything’s a bit foggy.”
“Nope, no consumers of death, just humble ol’ me.” Blaise winked at Draco, sitting down in the booth with him. “Like they’d know of this place anyway – decidedly Muggle, isn’t it?”
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look of surprise. “How Gryffindor,” Harry lauded. Draco shot a look of absolute mortification in response, causing Harry, Ron, and Hermione to burst with laughter. Remus, too, had a grin spread wide across his face, much to Draco’s chagrin.
The blonde shook his head. “I’m fine, honestly, just a bit of a headache. Thanks, though. I appreciate you willing to smuggle me into St. Mungo’s.” Remus released him, taking the sarcastic droll as evidence that Draco was, in fact, feeling fine. Draco looked towards the ceiling uncomfortably. “So, he’s really here, then?”
Sirius nodded. “I know how that goes.”
“Language,” Remus chided, placing water in front of Draco, who was thankful that he was provided with a straw this time.
“Afraid not,” Bill replied with a grin.
Harry, apparently a light sleeper, jumped into action, wand pointed in Draco’s face. Draco, not one to show fear, just quirked an eyebrow as he waited for Harry to realize what was going on. Once recognition shone in the Chosen One’s eyes, they narrowed in exasperation. “You’re kidding, right? I could’ve hexed you.”
“You do like him though, right?”
“I do. I’m not the one on pain potions sobbing that I finally get to see my parents even if I’m in recovery
He leaned over to turn the jets on and sighed and closed his eyes as they came to life, working out his bodily tension. It had been a rough transformation.
But Greyback only shook his head: “No, I can smell it—you’re not going to last much longer. I can fix it.” Greyback then opened his mouth wide, jaw almost unhinged, leaning close to Draco as his canines descended.
Ron nodded and looked expectantly at Draco. “I suppose we can ask Sirius about it. Interhouse bonding and all that.”
James frowned, standing. “I’ve only had five minutes with you.”
“Could be the vampire genetics kicking in, too,” Remus mused, “seeing as Draco donated some of his core you’re probably with more of it than you used to.”
“I’ve been dying to do that for ages,” Harry grinned after pulling apart, sitting at the edge of Draco’s bed. “I’ve missed you.”
Blaise and Pansy looked between one another. “Go on, darling,” Pansy drawled, reminding Harry of Draco’s over the top posh accent he put on sometimes. “But do be careful, the Chosen One has a knack for stealing all of my boyfriends.”
“Don’t be a stranger,” Blaise replied, still staring at Harry as though trying to read him.
Just a little update/tableaux before we move into the war half of the series. Look forward to a time jump next time!
“Of course. You can take one of those every 6-8 hours or so if you’re experiencing a lot of discomfort with that arm. It was broken without intervention for so long, making it a slower heal than usual.”
“Potter, you’ve never been normal.”
“I think it has to do with fighting the adoption spell,” Harry lied. “I have more of the gene inside of me than normal. You look like you’re in your twenties,” he said, trying to distract the wizard.
Meanwhile, James had reached Harry about midway towards the castle doors. “Hey,” he said, catching him around the middle as he tried to run past him. “Slow down, Haz.”
Draco thought but couldn’t help but feel comfort in the embrace. “How are you feeling? Any eye pain?” he asked pulling back.
Draco felt his stomach drop at the thought of accidentally turning Harry. “I’m so sorry.”
Thanks for sticking around! I know it's been awhile but I have finally obtained my PhD! Planning on wrapping up this fic over the summer--as always, your comments and kudos are appreciated more than you know :)
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and scrunched his eyes shut, unwilling to let himself lose it. He’d whine to Blaise later about it. “Fuck. Okay. When does he want to see me, then?”
“It doesn’t mean I’m bull headed,” she replied.
“Speaking of horcruxes,” Harry said, “I’ve been doing some research.”
“No, actually. He’s in a session.” Ron shifted uncomfortably.
“Then his dad disowned him and kicked him out of the Manor.”
Sorry it's been awhile - I have a longer chapter to make up for it!
“We’ve been roommates all summer. He’s had to put up with a lot,” he explained.
Quick warning about the chapter and the way the plot is going to go: very rollercoaster like with ups and downs and alcohol. It will get worse before we get to the garden. The next chapter will be pretty intense.
The bed rest was terrible the second time around, Draco had decided. He wanted to be working towards recovery and once again he was forced to “get lots of rest” and “take it easy”. Ever since turning all Draco ever was was ill, it seemed. He couldn’t stand it.
“It’s all my fault you even got to that point. I shouldn’t have shut you out. I should have kept a closer eye. You were obviously in need of help anyone could see it. I’m so sorry.” Draco was crying now, fully overwhelmed by the guilt that was consuming him. He was also furious at Dumbledore for brushing it off as well. Did he
“You’re Seeing?” Harry nodded. “Is this a new thing?”
birthday, Harry finally decided to start speaking again: he had resolved to leave Draco at the Manor and protected, rather than bring him on the horcrux hunt. That should be enough to keep him away from the battle, he thought.
His dad. Right. He must be worried sick—Harry felt the guilt well up again. “Okay.”
“I shouldn’t be even talking about this without Ron and Hermione. Mind if I grab them?”
“You don’t smell right,” Fenrir grumbled, leaning in to sniff him without a shred of shame. Draco winced at his touch, wishing he could Disapparate on the spot. “You’re off.” He pulled back to meet Draco’s eyes, his own crinkled in what Draco could only read as concern, surprised to find no malice. “You’re dying again.”
Harry looked up with a grimace. “Sorry, I was going to lose count again.” He began capping the vials off as they continued. “Classes so far seem great, though it is only the first day. I’m not excited for Draco to leave this Thursday.”
Harry continued to primarily speak to James about this, remaining silent to the living. He’d bounce the most ridiculous ideas off of him about how he could best protect Draco in the event of the Killing Curse or overexerting himself, coming up with little. He was modeling Hermione, spending copious amounts of time in the Black library, even going so far as to go into werewolf clan magic, which the library had several books on to Harry’s surprise. The silence was beginning to really worry Remus and Sirius. Draco seemed to be okay with Harry’s muteness, taking it as a form of grief more than anything. He didn’t suspect that the quiet was due to something potentially happening to Draco.
Sirius shook his head. “I’m not dead. I just fell through the veil and landed here.”
Theodore Nott seemed to had joined up with his father. He looked a bit worse for wear, always covering his sleeves. He was becoming quite the introvert: less about Slytherin political games and more keeping to himself, Crabbe and Goyle. Draco was just happy that he seemed too distracted to pay him any mind: thank Merlin for small favors.
He glanced at Harry, who he had realized was currently subject to intense staring and whispering from everyone around him. He looked like a statue, schooling his features into blank passivity as if he were trained to do so. He looked very much like his uncle’s portrait at the moment, stone faced and disinterested. Draco thought about Regulus and his advice: he hoped that Harry wasn’t completely miserable by Christmas.
Harry returned for the funeral but sat himself closely next to his father, slumped against him at times, rather than speak to Draco or his friends. He looked paler than usual and quite resigned, as though he were deflated. Draco knew that despite all of Dumbledore’s faults, he was a formative character in Harry’s life, and without him the dark-haired teen probably felt lost and directionless. Remus pulled Draco aside when there was a moment to tell him that he would be staying at Black Manor over the summer: Grimmauld was compromised because Dumbledore was the Secret Keeper. Draco felt relief at that, happy to be going to the same place as Harry, resolving to help him any way he could in the upcoming battle no matter what that meant for him.
“Looks cool but also deadly. Hope they get to the bottom of it soon!”
everything?”
Remus hummed in response. "Well the Order uses it now, a gift from Harry, really. Let's go in, shall we?"
“Tomorrow,” Healer Markus provided. “If everything goes smoothly, we’ll have you out of the hospital in about a week.”
James smiled. “Safe and sound.”
“No worries. I’ll take you to your new digs. Anyone else want to join?”
Draco pulled the two Gryffindors away and towards the meeting. He couldn’t believe Blaise already. He had to know that comment would cause suspicion. Draco was seeing red.
"You all are fussing for nothing," Draco grumbled, making his way to the door and swatting Potter's offered arm away. "I'm not going to drop dead, Potter, relax."
Sirius squeezed Harry’s hand gently. “Oh, but you did, and were way too young to be doing so. You were willing to throw everything away for the sake of protecting the magical community. You were fated to complete an ugly task and you did so with flying colours. You bled into the Garden, and while I wish you hadn’t, your father has returned and for that I cannot be sad or angry. You both get to live now—She has deemed it so.”
Harry matched Draco’s frown, feeling his head. He immediately became alert. “You’re burning up,” he remarked. “Hold on, I’ll grab him for you.” Harry bounded out the door. Draco willed himself not to cry again, choosing to sigh instead. Was this it? Was he even going to make it to his second full moon? What a horrible way to go out, he thought, surrounded by people who don’t even care about you. He wished he could be near his father so he could kick and scream out his frustrations at someone who deserved it.
Draco laughed. “I’ve missed you.”
Draco was fiddling with his blanket as he listened to the former professor. "I don't want to go through that pain again," he mumbled, feeling very small. "Maybe next time, I won't survive long enough to feel that pain." He hated being pitied and he could smell it rolling off of Remus. It was all too much. He felt the older wolf place his hand on Draco's shoulder comfortingly, reminding him of his mother again. He blinked back the tears threatening to fall – now was not the time.
Harry would smile encouragingly at him from across the room as Draco shuffled along with a Healer spotting him, sometimes saying innocuous things like “You got this” to push him along. Harry would attend any session he was allowed in, even if Draco felt extremely embarrassed while exerting way too much energy trying to cast a simple
Once the rest of the students heading to class passed by he sat upon on of the large windowsills, drawing his knees up to his chest and closing his eyes.
“Not all of us can have a forced RP, you know.”
Harry nodded. “I’m glad Draco is writing me a script. I feel a bit out of my depth.”
"What other nicknames are on that list, I wonder," Harry said. "Snake Prince? Dungeon Dragon?"
Blaise glanced at the parchment. “Will you eventually show him them, you know, after everything?”
Sirius nodded, happy to finally check on Harry. “Great—thanks so much, Eric. I’m so glad Haz trusts you and is willing to work.”
Sirius only nodded, expecting that answer. “Healer Turner should be here soon and he’ll have pain potions for your arm and leg and some nutritional supplies. Then we’ll pick a specialist to see if there’s anything else we need to worry about, yeah?”
Harry was finally settling down enough to realize the full extent of what happened. He detached himself from Draco and sat against the wall. “Sorry.” He wiped his face with his robe sleeve. He buried his face in his hands. “That was so embarrassing.”
He almost forgot about what was happening outside this insular bubble until Remus finally arrived a day after the moon, looking quite grim.
“The battle’s over, Draco,” Jack explained. “You’ve been out for about 12 hours.”
“This is so cool.” He held up the mirror. “James Potter,” he called into it. James’s face appeared about ten seconds later.
“What are you sorry for? You saved my life. I don’t have a lot of time—they said I could only see you for a few minutes. I just wanted to thank you.” He squeezed Draco’s hand gently.
“Why would you get them?” Harry asked.
Lucius let out a breathy laugh at that. “You can’t have tea yet. I paged the Healer, though so we’ll see.” He then got serious. “I don’t hate you. The hospital got in contact with us and came as soon as we could. Your mum just stepped out for some food. I’m so glad you’re alright.”
“I’m just going to go back to my room. I’m really tired today,” he said.
She looked a little worn but still as regal as ever. Remus stood to give the two some space. “I’ll just be down the hall,” he said.
“When I can keep them down,” Harry replied. “I’ll try harder.”
“You mate for life, right?”
Harry wasn’t buying it. He pulled Draco into his arms, standing on his tip toes to properly envelop him.
Draco looked down at the letter in his hands, a small frown growing on his lips. Would he show Harry? The letters were honestly acting as a quasi diary at this point—some of his deepest thoughts and feelings were sealed in those envelopes. “I’m not sure. This is more cathartic than anything. Who knows if he’s even alive right now?”
He was beginning to feel the effects of the moon, battling waves of nausea every so often, his face becoming paler and under eye circles becoming deeper by the day. This ill feeling made him more and more homesick for his mother. This led Draco to the tapestry room a few days later. There was a  similar set up in the Manor, depicting the Malfoy lineage. He had spent countless hours memorizing every branch and nuance of the Malfoy family, knowing which relatives were in good or bad standing, at what level, and the reasoning behind it. He couldn’t imagine what future Malfoys would learn about himself – if they learned of him at all.
“Someone slept on the wrong side of the bed,” Harry quipped, biting into a biscuit Molly had made.
“Don’t be rude to her, Malfoy,” Ron warned.
“I’d also like you to hide away if we’re being completely truthful here.” Harry sighed at that, putting his face in his hands. James rested a hand on his shoulder, rubbing small circles into his back. “I know you, though. I know you feel compelled to finish this. We’re just worried is all.”
Blaise shrugged. “What? Everyone was going to find out tonight anyway.”
“Is that what happened?” Harry asked. “I remember him looking over me, and Uncle Regulus too, and some people I didn’t recognize. I thought they were bringing me into the Garden.”
“Father,” Draco intoned, devoid of much emotion. Harry wondered if he was Occluding to get through the exchange, with his face in passive blankness. Harry just nodded in Lucius’s direction in acknowledgement, not sure if he should speak.
“Do you think the castle will look different with its new repairs?” Blaise asked.
"Great."
He gingerly made his way to the kitchen, fearful of seeing the previously adventuring Golden Boy. The walking cleared his headache some—a telltale sign that he completely overdid it with the healing thing again. He was met in the kitchen by a very tired werewolf and a jittery father, nervously glancing at the ceiling every few minutes. “Lo,” Draco said hoarsely, announcing his presence and pulling the two adults from their musings, “thanks for the water,” he continued, holding his glass up in gratitude.
It was Draco’s turn to shrug. “I’ve found ways to cope. Welcome to Black Manor by the way.”
“All clear,” Remus responded. “Breakfast at home, then?”
Quick reminder that this story isn't a how-to book on dealing with friends/family members who are struggling with depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts/alcoholism. My characterizations are far from perfect and I am in no way advocating you getting angry with people who are obviously crying out for help. This is a story--perfect behavior on the part of friends would 1) make this unrealistic as nobody is perfect and this stuff is generally messy, especially if you are a teen and 2) would not advance the plot in the way I envisioned. If everyone was perfect, Harry would never have been sent to unloving relatives and wouldn't be involved in a war since 11 in the first place.
“How do you turn it off?” Harry asked.
She caught his eye as she made her way to the Slytherin table and winked, causing Draco to flush. “Yeah,” he replied, “that’s Pans, alright.”
“Where are you going?” Sirius called after him.
Harry shook his head. “Nah. They just remind me of how stupid I am is all.”
Draco couldn’t put his finger on what the fuck was wrong with Potter. Draco knew for sure he had not been the one who ensued the uncomfortable silence, he had actually felt lighter than ever since his confession.
“If you win, then you can kill Harry. Do whatever you want.” He paused, wanting to look behind his shoulder at Harry and make sure the other boy knew Draco would never let that happen. “But if I win, you let Harry and I go, and-”
Draco knew he would have to leave the Hospital soon. He knew that if he stayed another week, or even another day, it would turn into a bigger mess, and he would end up never leaving his hospital bed.
“Oh yeah, I’ve been here plenty of times this summer and have served myself Butterbeer from the tap. Let’s just say I’m pretty good friends with the person who owns the Hog’s Head.” Draco had no clue who the owner was, and didn’t have much interest in finding out. During his earlier years at Hogwarts when he and his friends would go to Hogsmeade, they would always pick The Three Broomsticks to get Butterbeer and food over any other place. Now though, he was extremely happy Potter had picked the Hog’s Head to take shelter in. He didn’t know if he was brave enough to enter Rosmerta’s pub.
“So, Draco, I bet your real happy The Chosen One saved you from being stuck in that closet today. You're really lucky to have him as a friend,” Theo spoke casually, as if Draco and him were best mates.
Harry was so sickeningly sweet and sincere, Draco couldn’t fathom how he had gotten to this point in his life where Harry bloody Potter was offering him emotional help.
Draco hadn’t really thought of anything else he wanted to say, but now that Dumbledore mentioned it, he did want to mention to Snape that his Mark had started moving again. He knew Snape would understand how he was feeling, seeing it come alive again; he also had the cursed tattoo. He wondered whether Snape's portrait had the Mark. Probably. He wanted to ask if his scar had started moving again too, but he didn’t want to ask in front of Dumbledore.
“You’re quite welcome.” The faint smile that had been replaced with annoyance was now back on Snape’s face, and Draco was glad of it.
Wednesday was a repeat of Tuesday, every detail replicated except for the fight that had ensued around twelve thirty in the early hours of Tuesday. Draco’s Mark throbbed a bearable amount, and he had climbed into Harry’s bed without asking permission. Harry didn’t seem to mind.
“You came to find me?”
“What about you, Harry. What do you think about the whole Alec situation?” Draco asked, needing to know Harry’s thoughts on his once-friend.
Every moment, the good and the bad that made up their entire relationship, led to this moment right now. Draco had wished he could go back in time, all the way back to when they had first met, but now, he realized he didn’t want to anymore.
heard something other than the wind. It’d been the owl, delivering your father’s response,” Harry said, coming to the correct conclusion. Draco nodded his head shamefully. “I knew it. I could just tell something else was going on other than the

What truly defines a hero?
Draco ran down the millions of steps that made up the Astronomy Tower, almost killing himself three times by tripping, and once he reached floor level, his eager running turned into composed walking. Or, at least, mostly composed.
They would have to leave soon, Draco knew, and he didn’t know when the next time they saw each other--alone--would be. And before he and Harry parted ways, Draco had to explain what had happened in the woods with Drys. Especially the part where he had been hit with the Killing Curse.

was a little hard to wrap his head around, but crazier things had happened in the past weeks, so he figured he shouldn’t dwell on it too much now.
. It’s weird. What the fuck do we have in common with each other?”
“I can’t believe your favorite team is the Chudley Cannons. That’s Ron's favorite team,” Potter said with a laugh.
Although, Draco knew he shouldn’t be judging Harry, considering he was the one who started their childish rampage throughout the castle.
Draco swallowed. “Okay.” He had every opportunity to apologize right now to Harry, he knew, but he first wanted to hear what Harry had to say.
Elizabeth laughed too. “Yes, very good, Harry. Now, to start off our session today, I would like to talk about guilt. Who here has ever felt guilty?”
“You could have had a great life, Draco. Ruling beside me, letting me take the reins of your mind. You would have been admired and loved by all, known as the boy who had cleansed the world from the evil Purebloods.”
They officially had less than a week until this coming Sunday, and Draco became more anxious as time went on. Harry seemed stressed too, but not to the same extent as Draco, obviously.

“Mr. Malfoy,” she started as she neared Draco, “How are you feeling?”
“So you’ve finally come to terms with being a hero?”
This time Pansy groaned. “It’s been three weeks now, Draco. I know I told you it was fine to wait a bit to talk to him, to work things out by yourself, but honestly you both look terrible.” She pointed discreetly to Harry across the hall, who wasn’t even trying to hide his tiredness and was staring blankly at the table.
“What about Harry?” Draco asked, causing Harry to turn his head a bit. “What will happen to Harry in either one of the scenarios I choose?”
“Harry, are those the names of Kaspian’s parents?”
While he had been watching Potter cast spell after spell for the past hour, and his Mark had burned away, probably grinning up at him from his arm- blistering in the pain and self-loathing that washed over him, he thought he might possibly have a way to find out more about the Dark Mark.
“There’s this ward that goes around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and anything that goes through it immediately disintegrates,” Draco added.
Draco banged his head against the door. He really needed to get out of here. He was starting to panic and he could feel the swell of tears against his eyelids. Not that he was going to cry. He wasn’t going to cry.
Draco wanted to mention that
“You are clearly not fine. Tell me or I’m just going to keep asking, never going to leave it alone until you-”
He had sat so close to Draco, it was like he’d been
Draco had some of his own questions, too, that he figured only Harry would be able to help him with. Like the fact that Draco had survived the killing curse. And that he had somehow made his Mark stop hurting,
“You’ll get it. I know you will,” Draco said easily. Like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“Oh. It’s nothing, really. I just knew that your special, stalkerish map was important to you, and the last time I saw it was…”
“He didn’t want to be seen while trying to capture me: for whatever reason, I don’t know, but when I was on his trail, he left the Slytherin tie for me to find and keep me off of his tracks; for me to think it was a Slytherin who was awake. I guess he thought his cover was blown since he had made noises and I’d obviously known that I was not alone anymore. Then, I'm guessing he hid in Slughorn’s office, which was the last place I heard a noise and searched for him before I bolted off to go and search for you, Harry.
“What? What is it? Who’s The Half Blood Prince? Potter
He pulled the blade away, and the sharp edge had a gracious amount of blood sticking to it and dripping to the ground. He felt content with what he’d succeeded with, and walked back over to Drys, handing the blade over.
After the second slow song played through, the music stopped entirely, but the two of them kept on swaying, clutching onto each other like the world was ending, crumbling into pieces, and holding onto each other made staying alive so much easier.
Draco knew he was blushing fiercely. Even after everything, Harry still wanted to be his friend. It was even more great to hear him say the words aloud, so that Draco knew he hadn’t just dreamt it.
Until then, hope you enjoyed this chapter even though there wasn't too much drarry in it <3
He wanted to spit in their faces and tell them that yes, he did indeed know that fact, but he very much enjoyed staying at Hogwarts, since that meant he got to be far away from the Manor. He didn’t say anything, though. Instead he clasped his wand tighter, adjusting his grip. Now would probably be the time to cast a shield charm. It would show weakness, but he honestly preferred appearing weak in front of some nobodies than adding more scars to his already battered skin.
had turned into real affection towards Harry. He thought of Harry yelling at him on the other side of the bathroom door, and how he’d found Harry
After a minute or two of lying in bed and staring at the ceiling, he finally decided to turn his head and endure the inevitable.
you to accept the pull of the Mark.
Pansy glowered, but didn’t push. “Fine, then who’s it from?”
“Thank you. I just- I need time. But really, thank you for offering to listen to me,” Draco said, his voice almost a whisper.
“What’s on your mind now?” Harry asked.
“Hi,” he rasped, and brought his hand down to clutch at the blanket. “Do you know the time?”
While still dancing, Harry took his wand out, and pointed it at the radio, which made the song even louder.
The Auror spoke again. “Mr. Potter gave us his memories. However, everything he saw was blurry, and the voices were hard to hear. We did, though, get the part where you killed a man.”
It was still hard to breathe, and everything Draco had just seen was too much to take in all at once. He honestly still wasn’t sure what to choose.
The Figure disregarded his questions. “I’d like to talk to you in person, if you will.”
. “Aren’t you going to dance?” Harry sort of yelled, his dancing beginning to become more jumpy.
“Well, if you believe that, that only gives you a more motivating reason to keep on trying, to keep on trying to better yourself, because one day, I assure you, you will be the best version of yourself. A version of yourself filled with self love and self reassurance.” Harry squeezed his hand. “I know I can’t really compare to… uh, your experiences during the war, but I had to better myself this summer. I had to find self love. I already sort of told you all this on Thursday, in the Garden, but I haven’t exactly found it quite yet, but I think I’m getting there. Slowly, but surely. You just have to pick something or someone that gets you to fight, everyday, for yourself. Someone that cares about you.” Harry squeezed his hand again.
Harry, accompanied by Weasley and Granger, hadn’t so much as batted an eye in their direction. They hadn’t even noticed that he and Pansy were standing pretty close to their little group, listening in on their conversation.
“What if we split up and then someone comes into Hogwarts and kills you? Or I get killed in Hogsmeade?”
Draco fell down next to Harry, taking the arm he had just cut and holding it in his hands. He didn’t know much about the human body and the different arteries, but he was pretty sure he’d cut one.
He was now almost positive the universe could read his mind. This book was exactly what he needed at the moment to cure his boredom and refocus his mind.
He did not want to go to the Hospital Wing. He couldn’t face Madame Pomfrey. He couldn’t have yet another person see the Mark. It was all too much, especially for one night. But, he also didn’t want to have to walk the halls of Hogwarts. He didn’t know how late it was, but he was sure some students would still be up. He could ask Granger if she knew any charms to repair clothing, but that would be way too embarrassing.
“Right, then,” Draco muttered, and tried yanking his arm away, one last time. To his surprise it worked. He turned back around, and started walking away from Potter when he felt a hand wrap around the same wrist, once again.
“Malfoy-” laughter- “fucking idiot!”
Draco realized, in that moment, that he
He tried to sit up quickly, to show that he really was fine, but it didn’t quite work out. Instead, he banged his head against the wall, making everything blurry again, and was promptly knocked out, meeting darkness once more.
Draco absently played with the gem at his throat, thinking about the possibility of having a secret room just for the two of them, like the Garden. It was a truly amazing prospect, and Harry was right; they were more than capable of fulfilling it.
“Sadly, yeah. Sort of,” Harry said, taking a quick break to shove food into his mouth. “As I’ve mentioned before, this summer was hard for me, and he was a great friend to me over the summer and during this year at Hogwarts. Well--” he snorted-- “he was pretty toxic. As you might’ve seen. Quite a bully; reminded me of someone I used to know…”
Draco was glad Potter had offered to check on McGonagall, he really didn’t want to talk to the Headmistress if he did not have to. “Fine. You do that. I guess I’ll check the Slytherin common room, see if anyone is awake in there.”
“Draco, aren’t you going to open your letter?” Pansy was dangling the envelope in front of him.
and go rant to Pansy about what happened. A deeper instinct told him now was the time. The time to explain things and set everything right between the two of them. He’d already waited way too long.
Potter took a step away from Kaspian, and his arm dropped back to his side.
Another person was walking their way. A person significantly smaller than the Figure, but about the same size as Draco. The harsh rain made it hard to see who the person was from a good distance away, but as the person ran up to the Figure, and his face became clear, Draco knew exactly who the boy was.
And so Harry stood, placing himself beside Draco on the bed. They weren’t touching, but Draco relished in his nearness.
Drys lost his calm composure immediately. “They’re not here!” He said, panicked.
“Oh, uh, yes of course. Harry, go join Malfoy.” Slughorn seemed to be avoiding Draco’s eyes.
Draco had gone to bed with his arm burning horribly, and had to hide his discomfort from Potter which proved to be extremely hard, since the git was nosey about every single little thing.
“Stop!” Potter said from behind Draco. “Stop kicking snow up! It’s getting
“Maybe. Or what if it’s a warning? Like thirteen days to save them and then something horrible happens,” Draco suggested.
“Right. Not like I haven’t been wanting to do that for weeks now,” Harry deadpanned.
Draco went on, “And- uh- did the cut leave- any scars?” A small part of him wanted to believe the gash over the snake and skull would stay there forever, disfiguring the vile tattoo enough so that he would never have to look directly at it again. But as Madame Pomfrey looked into Draco’s eyes, he knew what the answer would be.
Blaise blanched at that. “We were mostly casual. I think we both caught more feelings than we let on.”
Draco just laughed. “And I thought the horcrux was what made you such a twat.”
Once they reached the Hogshead, Draco turned to sneer at the two of them, not for the first time in the last thirty minutes, and crossed his arms defiantly for good measure.
The piece of parchment was still laid out in front of Draco though, while he watched Theo’s dot. He couldn’t occupy himself with anything else, since he was afraid he’d miss a movement from Theo if he was distracted.
Pansy had thrown a party for him, even though he had specifically told her not to, she did it anyway. Typical.
“Goodnight.”
Harry gave a small chuckle, which Draco knew meant Harry had already given up on whatever he was looking for. It was a depressing realization. The Boy Who Lived had given up, due to pain caused by a war he had ended. A more depressing realization was: if Harry hadn’t found his ‘something,’ Draco would never be able to find his either.
“Right. Well, we’ll finish this conversation tomorrow, Mr. Malfoy. Have a good night.” With that last statement, she crossed the room to the doors, passing Granger, Weasley, and Potter who were awkwardly standing in the middle of the room, nodding to them as she passed, and left.
Draco knew that Drys had been expecting Draco to go along with his plans; he saw Draco as a scummy Death Eater who would always take the easier path. After Draco finished talking, he suspected that Drys’s face would fall, and that he’d become so enraged, that he might actually leave Hogwarts, taking his band of Death Eaters with him along with Alec, to go find someone else who was suitable for cutting Harry’s skin.
He didn’t trust himself to not make more horrible decisions, and he didn’t want to burden Harry with the thought that they had actually made progress in their friendship, when in reality, Draco was really deceiving him.
Draco figured out that taking walks alongside the Forbidden Forest and Black Lake greatly comforted him and eased his muscles and mind. When he wasn’t in classes on Wednesday, he found himself traversing the school grounds, clutching a book to his side.
“Well, you made this big show about getting Harry’s blood, telling me to
“You see, Draco. Whatever you choose, I’ll get my way. But the ‘right’ way will benefit you. So, like I said before, it’s a simple choice. Besides, if for some foolish reason, you’d rather decline my offer, and have your family, almost half of the Wizarding World, and Harry Potter
At one point Draco had even bloody
Draco let out a breath of relief.
And then two became one.
Slughorn was walking around the classroom, adding the tiniest hint of Bundimun Secretion to everyone’s potions. From the look on Slughorn’s face and his very grandiose praising, Draco knew Granger and Weasley had made an excellent brew, along with Kaspian and his partner, and Theo and Blaise.
Sure, Harry admitted they were friends. Sure, Harry had danced with him for an hour, or longer. Sure, Harry smiled his brilliant smile and his eyes sparkled every time he so much as glanced at Draco, but did all those things-
Draco then explained to Pansy in detail everything he could remember from the night before, leaving out the part about the cut on his arm. Pansy pulled up a chair and listened intently to Draco’s story until Madame Pomfrey finally came out to yell at Pansy to leave. Draco was pretty sure Pomfrey had let her stay for more than five minutes, but he didn’t complain. Pansy had also handed Draco his wand. She had apparently come by to see him Saturday morning, and Pomfrey had given her his wand to keep safe until he was awake.
He did a couple breathing exercises, ones that Elizabeth, the Eighth Year’s group therapist who Draco hadn’t thought of in more than a week, had taught them how to do. He knew he spent more time in the bathroom than just a couple minutes, but he didn't care. Harry would probably complain some more when he got out, but that was his problem, not Draco’s.
Soundlessly, he moved Harry’s limbs to the side and picked up his wand off the floor, seeing that the time was only 6:48 am. He sighed, and then climbed back in bed, doing his best not to wake Harry as he stole back a blanket.
For a split second Draco thought everyone had found out about his and Harry’s shared kiss, before rationalizing that if that were to somehow get out, people’s expressions would be much different from what they were now.
Draco was speechless. Not because he was angry at Potter, but because he realized Potter was
Somehow, a tear fell silently down Draco’s cheek. Harry was just so
“It’s no problem. And, you did save my life too, so thank
“Ugh! This is hopeless,” Potter said as he banged his forehead against a book called
“What the fu- Malfoy. Seriously.” Potter eyed Draco up and down, taking in his Slytherin attire. Draco felt himself blush under Potter’s gaze, and immediately picked a spot on the wall to stare at, giving himself something to do other than have to acknowledge his awkward stance in front of Potter.
Draco honestly couldn’t believe he was arguing with Harry about whether or not he should accompany Draco to the depths of the library. But on second thought, he definitely could believe it.
was inevitable. It was inevitable, and yet, they’d faced greater threats.
Draco cast his gaze down, and made his way to the very back of the room where Pansy was sitting. She seemed to be in mid-conversation with Blaise and Theo.
“You know, when there was more than just themselves on the line. So in your case, you could have fended off Drys due to a mix of adrenaline and the desire to save Harry.”
“Right. Thanks.” Draco yawned again before sitting up and collecting his things.
“Okay, let’s do this.” Harry took out his wand, and Draco assumed that even though Harry had said ‘let’s,’ plural, he concluded he’d be the one casting the spell.
Potter went on without a response from Draco. “So, I sort of feel, I don’t know, obligated to be friends with him. Like being his friend and hanging around him is going to fill the hole in my heart that was left there by Remus’s death. Alec has so many stories about him that I love to listen to, and I feel like if I just stop being friends with him, I won’t ever get to hear anymore stories, and it will be like I’m disgracing Remus’s memory. I don’t know, my reasoning doesn’t make much sense, and it sounds stupid. Also, before you say anything else, I
Harry contemplated what Draco had said, and for half a second, Draco thought that Harry might forgive him. “But how am I supposed to know that you won't change your mind about slicing my skin, bringing my blood to another dark wizard to save yourself, huh? Any sane person would get as far away from you as possible. So, that’s what I’m doing. Leaving.” Harry pushed past Draco, now walking out in the rain.
Draco huffed in annoyance. “Knew it. I knew we were having too much good luck.”
He was sure the situation could not have gotten worse.
“Harry?” He tried again, except this time his voice sounded unsure.
“Okay,” Draco returned.
“You said I’d be the death of you. You were right.”
After about ten more minutes of impatiently sitting in bed, the Aurors and McGonagall finally lifted their heads in unison. McGonagall had a tight, strained look on her face. The Aurors were simply angry.
Now it wasn’t possible. Draco would be condemned to watch the Wizarding World fall apart again, all because he had failed, and lied, and hadn’t changed from the Death Eater he had been only less than a year ago.
“I didn’t ever have the chance.”
Naturally, he picked the paper up, his eyes raking over it, and he realized that it was an exam paper; an exam he had completed. The date at the top indicated that he had completed the test three Thursdays ago. Which meant that that was the day he had gotten trapped in a storage closet on the seventh floor, and Harry had ended up saving him.
“Yes,” Draco breathed. “Aren’t you?”
Potter was sitting with his back against a wall when Draco got to the bottom of the steps and passed by the gargoyle. He seemed to be in a slightly better mood than the one he was in before; he was humming some song and tapping his foot to the beat, and Draco almost laughed and smiled at the vulnerability and human side Potter was showing.
“You know what, never mind. Of course you don’t even know what a movie is.”
People were dancing and drinking and overall having a wonderful time, from what Draco could tell. He wondered if this was what parties in Hogsmeade were always like; the ones he’d never attended.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked as they neared Slughorn’s classroom.
Draco continued to stand with his arms crossed in the middle of the hall. Unlike Potter, he wouldn’t lose his cool. “Same thing happened to me when I went to check on Pomfrey. She was asleep in her bed, or what I suppose is sleeping, and when I tried to wake her she just wouldn’t budge.”
Draco wanted to offer up a secret of his, he really did if it meant it would save everyone in the end, but the only deep, dark secret he could think of was his moving Mark, which he most certainly would not offer up.
“Harry! Merlin, Harry, I’m here. I’m here, I'm here and I’m not letting go.” Draco let the tears fall down his face freely. Draco was fussing with the other boy’s body, moving Harry’s head so that it rested on Draco’s lap, and so Draco could lean down and wrap his arms around Harry’s freezing stomach. Hopefully bringing life and warmth back into the liveliest person he knew.
As he stood in front of Drys, he felt a cold, metal object being thrust into his grip. He wondered what it was, but couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“Oh, come on. Don’t be so dramatic all the time.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed. “Get the fuck off of me.”
“Absolutely.” Draco smiled despite himself.
“How are you, Mr. Malfoy?” McGonagall asked. Even though Draco was terrified of her, she was without a doubt one of the nicest people in the world, especially to him; especially after the war.
“So, nothing. Drop it.”
He huffed. “Alright, come on. Let’s get this over with.”
Draco was nervous to hear Harry’s answer, but knew that it was something he needed to have knowledge of. No one had told him, or had been able to tell him, exactly all the details about what went down after Draco had killed Drys.
with pain, and Draco couldn’t suppress the small scream he let out. He also couldn’t suppress holding his arm, to which Drys gave a tight-lipped smile.
It all seemed childish, now. He’d been incredibly embarrassed because of what Harry had done that day, but that didn’t even compare to all the embarrassment he had felt throughout the past two weeks, and especially today.
Pomfrey looked like she wanted to say something else, but opted out of it, grabbing the last of her things and levitating some behind her that would not fit in her arms.
Draco was about to catch his mouth in another kiss when Harry tugged on Draco’s robes, and Draco looked down at Harry as he repeated the same process Draco had done, and definitely ripped some of the buttons off. He carefully unhooked the necklace that the red gem hung from, and placed it on the floor besides the bed.
They’d decided that the Garden of Mystics should be left for Drys and Olive and those two only. But the idea of leaving a mark on Hogwarts, their very own secret room, that students generations from now might happen across, was something Draco and Harry had needed to create.
He was proud of himself, of course, since the potion he had brewed had potentially worked after all, and he guessed he was glad to see that Theo hadn’t died, but Theo wasn’t important right now. Harry was.
Before he could get a word in, though, McGonagall spoke. “Draco, please realize that I am always here to talk. And if anyone bothers you, whether that be a student or a professor, please come to me immediately.”
It was probably likely.
Draco had been certain that whatever he had been feeling for Harry was only a simple crush. But now, he was certain, he had found love.
The next day, a Monday, Draco found himself skimming through books in the library.
, Draco thought.
Draco watched the woods again, for the lack of an answer. He
He finished writing his short letter, and read it over a couple times.
It felt like Déjà vu, making their walk to the potions classroom around twelve, like they had done the previous day and night. They’d given up on checking out the Slytherin and Gryffindor common rooms to check if anyone had woken up. Draco’s visions made it abundantly clear everyone would stay asleep until next Sunday. Or worse, in the situation Draco was avoiding thinking about, would stay asleep forever if Draco didn’t comply with what the figure had told him to do.
“Were you planning on doing it?” Harry gritted his teeth. “Were you planning on- on giving my
Draco slowly extended his arm to touch Harry. “Did
Potter was now serving himself a nice sized Butterbeer, foam spilling out over the top of the glass. He made a glass for Draco too, which made him surprised at the kind gesture. He could have figured out how to serve himself a glass of Butterbeer surely, and Potter must have known he was capable, so why was Potter being purposefully
“Ah, finally.” A strange noise came out of the radio, and Draco almost covered his ears with his hands. Almost. “Okay, so, summer before eighth year I learned this spell that allows you to play whatever song you want on a radio, you just have to think of a song and it will play it.” Harry seemed truly prideful of the spell.
But close. Potter also still maintained his slim figure.
“C’mon, Harry. I can’t lose you,” Draco spoke, “I can’t lose you. You’re the best part of me. You make my life whole, and without you in my life-”
This, in the first place, was extremely optimistic thinking of him; going up to the people he had wronged in his life and admitting his misdeeds. He knew he had to do it, he had made a promise to himself during the Curse, although it was much harder than he would have liked. But, it was only the beginning of February: he had a lot of time to figure things out.
Being a Gryffindor was in fact not something he was good at. He’d always hated the idea of being associated with Gryffindor in any way, but now he longed to have courage. He was starting to get the idea that he could never be anything but a coward.
personal relationship with Draco and his family. To him, the discovery was sort of disappointing.
He heard a curse on the tip of Drys’s tongue, and could feel Harry’s fear. Or maybe it was his own.
Drys hesitated. “
On top of Potter being upset with him for squandering their Thursday, he knew the other boy was perturbed that Thursday morning Draco had specifically told Potter he wouldn’t keep secrets from him, and then that same day Draco had made very clear he hadn’t wanted to reveal a meaningful secret to Snape’s book. He was sure that made Potter collect doubt that Draco wasn’t keeping anything to himself. The doubt was rightfully placed, since Draco
Thank you SO MUCH to everyone for reading. I really do hope almost everything was cleared up in this chapter. It was so fun to write, but I was (and am) constantly worried I wasn't explaining everything well enough or that the "end" wasn't going to be as good as everyone expected it to be.
She finally turned to him. She was wearing bright red lipstick and dark eyeshadow. Her short dark hair styled perfectly. She honestly looked like the epitome of a stripper. Not that she
As if the universe could hear his thoughts, Draco heard a soft rapping at what he presumed was one of the far windows of the library, promptly diverting Draco’s attention.
Look out for my next update since it will sort of be the finale!
Harry chuckled. “Maybe. But you really do deserve it. You did all the heroics. I was immobile on the forest floor.”
He looked back the way he’d come, hoping and dreading Harry was right behind him. He wasn’t.
“Aren’t you worried about what’s going to happen? I mean I know you told me before that you think nothing huge is going to happen, but…”
, Draco, I want you to come.”
. He usually worked well under stress, but this stress was different; his own life wasn’t on the line here, Harry’s was. Somehow, trying to save a life instead of his own in the moment, was much harder.
Drys casted a spell that was much more powerful than the one’s he’d been sending before. Draco’s shield almost faltered.
Draco remembered how weird the Garden was when he’d first walked in; there were no windows that would allow in sunlight, let alone rain or any water source, and yet the plants had all been in perfect condition. He’d guessed someone had had to cast specific spells to keep up the maintenance in the Garden, but he’d also known that the caster had to be an extremely powerful wizard.
“We’ll get back to that important piece of information. Anyways, my first thought was
“Oh, yeah, of course. I’d love to,” Draco said, trying to reign in his feelings. Kaspian was asleep. He wasn’t here, and he wouldn’t be here until, well, everyone woke up. Which could be soon. But, who knew when the curse would really be broken. And until it happened, Draco was the one with Harry.
Because what he had learned from all their shared moments was that it made them who they were, and it led them to sitting next to each other in the snow, looking at each other like they were the only two people to have ever existed.
“So you’re a stalker?” Draco huffed, then came to a realization. “That completely explains sixth year and how you always knew where I seemed to be! You are a stalker!”
he’s rude to everyone, especially the Slytherins. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he won’t listen. So, on his behalf, I apologize.”
Draco groaned. “Don’t remind me – I’ve had a constant headache being stuck in this noise void.” Then he realized. “Our footsteps.”
James looked almost tired as her rattled on and on about Harry’s safety, Sirius’s morning tea abandoned for strategy.
“He’s still a bastard.”
He thought about Remus a lot and the guilt the older werewolf was carrying inside of him for not trusting Sirius in the beginning. He also considered Harry and his constant state of mourning he seemed to be in. He was sure Harry was worried about the upcoming war as well and keeping everyone safe. He just wanted to help them, a new feeling he had acquired seeing as he never really felt the need to help anyone before. He chalked it up to the wolf enhancing his emotions.
Maybe he could overcome his darkness after all. There might be hope for him yet.
Draco did smile at that. He had been practicing healing magic more frequently now that he knew he wasn’t returning to school any time soon: he split most of his time between defensive and offensive battle spells and healing magic. Any time an Order member came back bruised and bloody, it gave him an opportunity to practice on actual people. It was quite the highlight of his day when he was able to help in this way. “I’ve moved past cuts and bruises and have been able to foray into metal health and brain chemistry. It’s kind of cool.”
“Dumbledore said—”
McGonagal looked at him as if she saw a ghost. Harry was getting used to that look but it didn’t make him any less weary about it. Would his face or voice ever belong to him, he wondered. “I was hoping you would be able to offer your preference as to how you would like to be addressed.”
Thanks to everyone who has seen this fic the entire way through! It has been an interesting 4 years on my end to say the least, and writing this has been a welcome escape from life especially when the going got tough!
Harry nodded and smiled sheepishly at Remus. “I really am sorry. I didn’t realize they’d freak out.”
Blaise stood. “I was just apologizing, Draco,” he said. “No need to be so cold.”
“I’m going to have to warn Molly about this: she’s not very fond of Sirius, is she?” Remus then squeezed Harry’s hand gently. “I’m so glad you got to talk to your Dads. I’m sure James was over the moon to meet you.”
“I thought that was the only way to remain in control.”
When Harry returned to Grimmauld Place, almost everyone had gone to bed. Draco was in the tapestry room nursing a mug of hot chocolate opposite Remus. They were both facing the tapestry, away from the fireplace and seemed to be having a deep conversation, not noticing Harry stepping through.
was getting worried about being in public. He tried to keep his cool despite the werewolf charm. “It would make sense, wouldn’t it?” he asked, voice a little higher than usual.
Harry placed an arm on Draco’s shoulder, who started in response. “Draco?”
He looked impossibly pale, most likely from blood loss. His eyes were sunken and his arms were bandaged heavily. Still, though, he was moving and talking and
“It was suffocating, right? That feeling of helplessness—we needed to do something. Especially with your familial ties. No matter what they said. Haz has even more of a reason to try and end this. You can’t clip his wings like that.”
Draco laughed. “I think that had more to do with being thirteen rather than the actual tattoos themselves, seeing as he was perfectly happy for me to take the Mark if things had gone differently.”
“Of course, of course,” she said, Draco smelling the empathy rolling off of her in waves. She rounded on her children anyway, telling them to not make too much noise while Draco rested. He was happy to be back.
“Yeah,” Harry commented, biting his lip. “Cheering charms,” he explained.
Remus looked away, distraught. “Fred didn’t make it.”
That night Harry was manic. He’d constantly have a drink in his hand, dancing on too many people to count, making out with multiple men. It stung Draco a bit to see him like this but what could he do? If he told him no, Harry would just go out by himself. He’d rather have someone there with him to keep an eye out on potential dangers.
“It wasn’t just a random cup,” Draco defended. “I think it was tied to Hufflepuff? One of the founders. He seemed really concerned about it.”
Turner nodded. “Of course. Anything for my favourite patient,” he quipped with a smile.
Draco was confused. “Why would I be afraid? I’m just sitting here.”
“Your father’s incompetence affects the entire family, young Draco. We must hurry, though, the moon is rising.”
Harry looked almost feral with the wind whipping around him. His green eyes were shining so brightly they were almost glowing.
Harry sighed. “You’re probably right. Hopefully your mum and her sister have some answers for me. I can’t keep going on like this.”
Can't believe we've made it to the end--very appreciative to all of you who have given kudos and comments along the journey.
“I can really get that reckless?” Draco was disappointed in his future self.
“Well, you’re alive,” she finally said, dumbfounded. “I wonder how to file for an undoing of a Death Certificate,” she mused.
“Have you seen them?”
“You look exhausted,” Sirius remarked when he finally got eyes on Healer Turner. The normally youthful Mind Healer’s eyes were sunken in, his dark hair just as disheveled as it was when he came to the manor a few weeks prior. He was in his Healer’s robes this time, looking quite official.
Draco frowned. “But does he deserve an open door?”
“You’re not from America are you?”
Sirius sat next to him suddenly, engulfing him into a hug. “Oh no. Don’t cry, please don’t do that.” Harry heard Sirius sniff him (he assumed to verify his identity with his canine senses). “Merlin, it really is you, isn’t it?” Sirius released him from his hug and held Harry at arms length, scanning his tear-streaked face. “How did this happen, babe?”
"Open your eyes for me?" Remus requested. Draco obliged, looking into the professor's amber eyes. Remus frowned. "Your eye color is very dull and dark today." He felt his head again. "Your fever is back too. This shouldn't be this way with the Wolfsbane. Your magical core must be very strong to be fighting the potion this hard. Here." He handed Draco a familiar vial. Fever reducer potion. He took it, feeling a bit better. His headache had receded some.
Another week of hospital food, brilliant. But he knew he had to be polite to the people saving his life. “I’m glad you figured it out—thank you.”
thought Draco.
It was all quite boring.
“Sure.”
Draco turned grey at that. Bill rolled his eyes. “Basil, your bedside manner is atrocious, has anyone ever told you that?”
Still the knocking persisted. "I'm giving you until the count of ten and then I'm coming in," Remus threatened. Draco ignored him. "One...Two...Draco this isn't funny! Three...Four..." Draco turned towards the door. This was all so dramatic. He couldn't make himself get up. "Five...Six...Draco I'm completely serious! Privacy does not trump mental health! Seven...Eight...Nine...Come on Draco." Draco waved his hand at the door in frustration and whipped away from it, curling up into a ball.
Sirius poured himself a bit of the vodka over some ice, pouring one for Remus as well. He handed the glass to him. “Here, you’re going to want this, probably.”
When he finally told Draco about Sirius’s revelation, he was met with a frown. “I had no clue my mum had that ability,” he said, feeling put out.
“Things get blurred a lot don’t they?”
"You seem to be allergic to red hair, then."
Draco snorted in response, the tension obviously eased. “Are we going back to the colony for the full?” he asked, reaching for a chocolate covered scone. Harry couldn’t help but parallel Remus and Draco’s love for chocolate. Maybe it was a wolf thing.
Harry changed tracks quickly, after realizing he was getting nowhere. “Well I’m here for a little while anyway. Dad can apparently access Bellatrix’s vault because it’s in the Black family holdings. He refuses to let me go so—I’m ‘resting’ while the ‘adults’ take over for a little while, I guess. Hermione and Ron are doing the same at Shell Cottage.”
“Of course it wasn’t—but much of the burden was unfairly on your shoulders and you came out on the other side a victor. You’ve saved people from a lot of hardship and pain—you must know that.”
Sirius stood. “Definitely.” He turned to Harry. “Want to go see your Dad?”
Molly even came to see him instead of simply dropping off sweets. She thanked him for saving Harry and said she couldn’t wait to have him at Christmas. He felt as though he were living in the Twilight Zone. If only his father could see this exchange.
Harry burst out laughing. “What?”
“Have you been trying any meditation? Occlumency?”
Draco sighed, thinking about his conversation with Remus all of those weeks ago. “I know. I forgive you for that. I would probably do the same.”
Blaise had bought Draco a gorgeous deep maroon winter cloak for Christmas. It was spelled special to always fit, adjust to weather conditions, and withstand copious amounts of wear and tear. It was
Harry sighed slowly in response. It was awhile before he decided to speak; it looked as if he was struggling not to react. He had a sad frown on his face. "It's just been different lately," he explained. "I don't like talking much anymore. Hermione wants me to own my feelings. Ron wants me to joke around again. I'm so angry with Dumbledore for giving me an incompetent Occlumency teacher who hated me. It was all my fault that anyone got hurt or worse." He sighed again. Draco felt badly for him, which was odd considering his feelings about the Golden Boy over the past few years. "I'm just tired of doing the Boy Who Lived thing and they come with the title. They remind me of my responsibility and my shortcomings. I can't help but see red when they try to interact with me."
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Harry grimaced. “Sorry.”
“I’m not saying he isn’t.” Ron shifted uncomfortably, obviously getting ready to say something he was unsure of. “You’ve obviously grown close this summer…”
Harry wasn’t going to fight Blaise, it turned out. But he definitely was going to have a word with him.
His father frowned at that. “Is that safe?”
“It doesn’t matter. I don’t know what your game is but I don’t think Draco wants to play. If you really want to be friends again I suggest you lay off a bit.”
Draco was sat in a Muggle/Wizard hybrid open MRI machine, much like Harry described going through when he was dealing with the Horcrux remnant. It was rather intimidating, honestly but he was glad he didn’t have to go in the large metal tube that he saw in the room next to him. Claustrophobia just wasn’t something he wanted to deal with today.
"Better than the Illiad I suppose," he replied.
Harry seemed to understand the gravity of this garden. “I can see my dad,” he said, eyes wide.
“Merlin,” Sirius breathed, suddenly standing. “That’s Regulus. R.A.B.: Regulus Arcturus Black.” He let out a breathy laugh. “That insane child. That impossibly ridiculous child.”
“Tests?” Hermione asked, breaking their silence with Harry.
Draco arrived early to Remus’s office on Monday afternoon, excited to begin to help even though he knew he would be going into Healing after school. Remus smiled at him upon his arrival. “Eager, are we?” he asked.
“You’re a saint, put it on the table—I’m just going to get changed.”
“Take your time.”
“Yeah. It was weird this time, too. It felt so real.” Harry shook his head in an attempt to shake the memory of it, though he knew he’d be retelling it to Healer Turner shortly.
Draco’s eyes began to well up with tears, not really hearing the elder wolf. He felt like he couldn’t breathe as he considered everything that had happened. “How are they going to let me be a Healer? I can’t be trusted.”
"It's alright," Draco interrupted, standing as well. "You're so high and mighty, Potter, acting as though the world revolves around you. You want to know what my worst day is? Getting bitten by a werewolf after being intercepted by your own father so he doesn't take on his own punishment from not getting some stupid mission accomplished for an egomaniac who has turned my home upside down for the better part of a year. My worst day is being kicked out of said house and disowned on paper so the Malfoy line doesn't have dirty blood. My worst day is watching someone powerful and respectable like my father turn on his own family to please some snake faced pile of dragon dung like he's some kind of puppet. Take a fucking look around: you are not the only one hurting from the war. We are all losing people – we are all making sacrifices. Stop acting as if the world is black and white and behaving like some sacrificial lamb who has no choice. No wonder your friends are so upset with you." Harry was in a stunned silence by Draco's outburst. His mouth was gaping like a fish and Draco vowed to savor a moment where Harry was actually silent for once.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said unconvincingly.
When the three arrived, Draco hadn’t even touched his essay. He was just staring blankly at the paper. Harry squeezed his shoulder gently, causing the blonde to jump in alarm. “Alright?”
“What do you care?” Harry bit back, not even caring that he was sassing a Professor. He was still irate at the man for harming Draco.
"Enough." Ron was cut off and he swallowed uncomfortably. "You are all probably driving Molly spare with the endless bickering. If Harry wants to be alone, give him space." Harry grinned triumphantly at that. "And if Ron and Hermione want to ask how you are, don't respond with insults and anger. They just care about you. Be happy for who you have."
“Nah, seems a bit too close to Legilimency for my taste.”
“Can he stay?” Draco asked.
Draco blinked. “I didn’t know that.”
“I wanted him to realize what he had done. And then it turned into something else entirely.”
Draco felt a cold chill wash over him. “What?”
Black Manor looked the same as before—for some reason, Draco thought it might look or feel different. It was quiet, sure, but the walls were still a calming beige and the windows were still brightly illuminating the large foyer. He actually heard Sirius’s bark of laughter coming from the direction of the sitting room and it put him at ease. He was
“Wait,” Remus interrupted. “You had the sword? How?”
“Couldn’t you be though?” he asked, trying to keep the hope from his voice. He loved his parents, even his father however messed up that was. However, he didn’t want to have to return to the Manor, maybe ever. And Remus had shown genuine concern for his wellbeing and was the best person to look after him with his lycanthropy. “Aren’t I disowned?”
He sat back on his heels, trying to process what just happened and hoping that Sirius got there in time.
Harry just laughed. Soon, the others had joined and it was really turning into a party. Everyone was impressed with the display: Draco had really outdone himself with his Samhain vision. A night that was usually so melancholy for Harry had transformed into a celebration of life—he wasn’t sure how he’d ever be able to thank Draco properly for this.
The Great Hall looked like it had never seen a day in battle, but the energy from that day was still palpable and filled Draco with dread. However, the malaise would not stop him from helping his friend.
Draco sighed. He had had it. “It means that we’re getting into a pattern of behavior again in which you get completely fucked up and come see me to hide from your feelings and I’m not doing this again.”
Draco looked down. Another notch against him in his father’s eyes.
Narcissa nodded knowingly. “It’s difficult to manage at first. With time you’ll be able to block it out when you need to. I must say, though, it is nice being able to commune with those who have passed. Have you been able to speak with Lily?”
Draco, already drifting off, was hearing none of it. “They’ll find you eventually. Shh, I’m dreaming now.”
He would read Sirius’s battered copy of The Odyssey in study halls, identifying with the main character’s quest for home. Harry never really felt at home anywhere; at least Odysseus had a place to long for. Not even Hogwarts seemed welcoming anymore.
Harry tried his best to detach from himself as he spoke again. The memory of it all felt so overwhelming. “It’s so strange. He basically ripped me from Fred, and it took me a moment to recognize him. He looked like how he did before everything. He looked around my age, like he was still Tom Riddle. He spoke so desperately. He said that his soul had come back together in death, and he couldn’t believe the pain he had wrought. That he was completely out of his head. He said he’s haunted by everything and shrouded in pain and that he was so sorry. He pleaded for forgiveness and for me to tell everyone what had happened. He was clawing at my arms in desperation and it actually hurt. It…I think I might be sick, sorry.” Harry fled to the bathroom to sick up again, but only bile came. The stress of the dream was a lot for him to bear. It felt
James sat across from the two and set his coffee mug on the table. “Your father snores so loudly, Harrison
"Couldn't tell with your display earlier," Draco joked, feeling stranger by the second.
It was like a living nightmare honestly.
“Very low,” Harry admitted, looking down.
“Of course!” How could he not be with all they had been through.
Why did you even go back to him?”
James sighed. “Nightmare?” he asked.
“I’m a curse breaker for Gringotts. Remus told me your vampire genetics are messing with your health. You look a bit peaky to be honest.”
That surprised Harry. “
“I’m glad for it, if not a bit jealous.”
“The rooms all look the same, Malfoy,” he responded with a laugh. “I’m sure yours is identical.”
Harry pulled together as much Gryffindor courage as he could muster and approached the two. Pansy looked put out to have to so much as look at Harry, but Blaise had a huge grin on his face. “Antares!” he exclaimed. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”
The plan was deceptively simple, devised by the remaining faction of the Order. They would stage a coup for Hogwarts, largely dependent upon sneaking in without notice. Harry, happy to not be the one at the helm of planning for once, was surprised to learn that Ginny, Neville, and Luna of all people were the key to getting inside of the castle’s grounds unnoticed, through a secret entrance guarded by none other than Aberforth Dumbledore himself stationed at the Hog’s Head. It was almost too perfect when it came down to it: Harry, Hermione, and Ron would enter in first with the others arriving quietly thereafter. Of course, after successful venture into the castle, everything dissolved into chaos.
Draco snorted through his tears. “Doubt it. You’re fiercely loyal.”
It was Draco’s turn to start. “What?”
“Well, no, but Remus said he’d get me a book.”
“I just didn’t know what to do. I was scared,” Blaise admitted.
“That’s insane,” he said. “I can’t believe you had to go through all that.” But then he smiled. “I have a son.” His voice was so full on wonderment and joy that it made Harry’s heart break at the thought of losing the opportunity to be raised by Sirius.
Sirius smiled sadly. “Haz,
“Not for most.”
Harry sighed. “I’m channeling the dead. Severus says hello, by the way.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah. See you there, Dad.”
“Well you have a funny way of showing it. Breaking up with someone you love isn’t very convincing.”
“If you were trying to protect me, why didn’t you let me go to asylum without becoming a werewolf first? All you had to do was let me leave with Severus and neither of you did anything to protect me.”
Draco schooled his features to not betray how happy he was to have Harry wanting him around and sat on the opposite side of him. He’d finally be able to return the favor of comforting Harry during a meltdown; he didn’t have to have the night with the letter hanging over his head any longer.
Draco sighed. “That’s not why they’re staring.”
Harry scrubbed his face in embarrassment. “Maybe I’m the jealous one—I’ve missed a lot of time with Draco, yet all I want is a nap. You got to be with him while I was, what did you call it, playing hero? I feel like a ponce about it—you pointing it out made me defensive.”
Remus nodded. “That’s a great idea. We’ll set up an earlier appointment than your monthly check-in. Sound good?”
things, especially as he bit into him while in human form.
Draco let out a shocked laugh in response, relieved that he wasn’t completely strange to at least one person. “Sure, Potter.”
Lucius huffed out a laugh at that. “I’ll do my very best.” When they returned to the fireplace Lucius turned to Harry. “Take care of him, Harry.”
Draco blanched and Remus, who had moved to the side table in the room to enjoy his tea and leave the teens alone, couldn’t suppress a snort from coming out. “Shut it,” Draco warned the elder werewolf, who held his hands up in defense. “I do not ‘have it bad’ for Potter. I just didn’t fancy him dying is all.”
“It’s to appear attractive to potential ‘prey’ and also to gain favor based on aesthetics. We get a bad wrap in the wizarding world, we need anything we can get to survive. Fenrir’s pack is also immortal. If we aged, we’d look a bit odd later on, don’t you think?”
“Your father, actually.”
“Nope. Molly Weasley only knits for those she cares for,” Remus interjected. “Ask Sirius: never got a sweater.”
“We’re fine. Better.”
"That's different," Draco said in defense.
Harry matched her frown—it looked strange on Sirius’s face. “Fine.’
Remus smiled knowingly at Draco, who flushed. He returned to the situation at hand with a sigh. “I think I need to fully explain the relationship dynamic of James, Lily, Sirius and I for you to fully understand what’s going on.”
Harry sighed. “I know—but I can’t sleep without it.”
James nodded tightly. “Agreed. They almost got caught. Ron wasn’t with them.”
“I’m sure you don’t.” Draco gave him a warning glare, noticing the flirtation in his tone. “I’m Blaise, and yourself?” he held out a hand for Harry to shake.
More angular and symmetrical. Though, if I’m remembering correctly, the Malfoys and Blacks already sort of look that way genetically. I’m assuming you don’t look too different from before. Eyes are probably brighter.” That was reassuring to Draco who found his breath and stood back up.
“Of course.”
I thought I was going to actually include the Samhain celebration in this chapter but it was getting lengthy: guess it will have to be the Halloween special. Thanks for reading!
“You swapped out a horcrux, didn’t you?” Sirius asked.
“So,” Markus changed the subject, “Potions, Arithmancy, Charms, Runes, Transfiguration, and perhaps Defense seeing as you’re locked in with Potter down the hall.”
Sirius allowed Remus to envelop him in a soul-crushing hug, not knowing what he did to deserve the werewolf’s grace. They would make it right together.
Draco moved to sit up suddenly, which caused him to cry out. Harry gently pushed him back into the pillows. “How? Why?” Dumbledore must’ve known, why else would he be so adamant of Harry not seeing a Mind Healer? He wondered who found them in the bathroom: certainly not Dumbledore if they wound up outside of his control. He suddenly realized what Voldemort was doing on his personal mission. “He’s got more of them.”
Harry was surprised at that, though he supposed he shouldn’t have been. While Harry spent time in St. Mungo’s over the summer, Draco spent some time getting acquainted with his pack. He knew he missed them. With the war done there was no pressure to hide from his true nature, his body allowing the wolf side of himself to flourish. Being with a pack would surely emphasize those instincts more.
Draco was looking forward to a silent nighttime patrol. He and Ron had split up to make shorter work for the both of them; they had been Prefects long enough to not need to be continuously paired. It was odd, being quasi friends with a Weasley, multiple Weasleys if he was being honest with himself. They both were ever-aware of their families’ blood feud, but Draco was coming to realize more and more the ridiculousness of some Pureblood customs. He wondered if that was Dumbledore’s plan when he said Sixth Year Prefects were to only sleep in their quarters. While aggravating at first, and definitely feeling like an overreach in the old man’s protective nature, Draco had found himself thankful for this rule: he was becoming more civil with the right people in addition to being safe from vengeful Slytherin dormmates, namely Theo.
“We’ve noticed.” Ron smiled. Draco chanced one back, but he felt himself grimace instead. “See you, Malfoy.”
James laughed in disbelief at that. “Clean bill of health?”
“You are staying out today. You’re going to meet your pack.” Draco paled at this. “Don’t do that, you’ll disappear.”
The very last time Harry knocked on Draco’s door in a full tirade was mid-October. He was  doing so well but found himself reeling from Pansy Parkinson putting the pieces together and it naturally spreading throughout the entire school. The morning’s
They all made their way out to the garden, Sirius calling loudly for his brother. When he finally appeared, he was taken aback by the amount of people. Remus gasped—he was able to see him. Sirius whipped towards the werewolf with a giant grin spread across his face. “We’ll see Jamie later, year?” Remus just nodded, unable to speak. Sirius hugged Regulus.
“It’s addressed to Harry Black Potter” he stated plainly, his face twisting into a frown.
“Like when Muggles cut other Muggles open and tinker around with their insides?”
, isn’t it? Like looking in a mirror.”
The continuous wand scans and nagging pain inside of his chest had made Draco want to jump out of his skin most of his waking hours. Someone was always sitting with him, whether it be Remus or his parents. Every so often, Mrs. Weasley would be there with various sweets for him and Harry, which he greatly appreciated: he had missed her home cooking while at Hogwarts. It made him long for Grimmauld Place in a way he never thought possible.
“He’s—well, inherited your depression, I’m afraid. With James’s anxiety to boot. Always been there under the surface, I suspect. He was always pretty quiet and having a Dark Lord after you since birth doesn’t help. He’s been a bit of a mess, really.”
Harry laughed. “Well, he did help me. He tossed me his wand. I was using Nott’s for awhile—I wrestled his out of his hands at the Manor. I lost it, though, towards the end—snapped in half from overpowering it, I think. I dunno, I was more magic than human at that point. Lucius tossed me his and I ended it.” He didn’t make eye contact as he described it, looking far off as though he was seeing it unfold again in front of him.
had a quasi tell-all of the findings—he wondered who sold him out to the news. Harry had a meeting with Dumbledore and McGonagall about what to do about the inevitable lurking paparazzi in Hogsmeade and both settled on the idea that Harry shouldn’t go at all for his safety. He was livid. He set the Headmaster’s curtains on fire through a bout of accidental magic and stormed out, ready to raid the kitchens of its firewhiskey.
Harry sighed. “Yes, Dad.” The potions were still a sore subject for Harry. Although they maintained his depression and anxiety, he still felt defeated having to take them, obsessed with the idea that his brain should be able to work itself out. Draco spent quite a bit of time trying to encourage him that it was perfectly fine and normal to need help, but it still made Harry feel embarrassed about it, even with nothing to be embarrassed about.
I know it's been a few months--very sorry about that! I was finishing up my PhD semester and was at conferences and writing academically. Thanks so much for your support and interest in the story! Hopefully I can whip a new chapter out soon!
Remus laughed again. “How are you doing by the way – feeling ill at all?”
Harry nodded towards him. “Hi.” He took a long drag.
“Yeah, well. He and Harry are pretty close and Harry took everything pretty hard. I’m worried that if I take him here he’ll never leave.”
Harry sighed again. “Yes, I’ll tell him.” He stood. “You can go back to bed—I’m alright now, thanks.”
Harry was crying now. “I don’t feel very strong right now.”
Draco winced at that. “I know that’s not a great feeling. Harry,” he began carefully, “are you eating okay? You’re really thin.”
Blaise sat next to him. Draco, while annoyed, was happy that it wasn’t Pansy or Theo. Crabbe and Goyle were avoiding eye contact with him towards the middle of the table. Draco felt sadness again: he wouldn’t be able to talk to them, would he? They probably were warned against it. Nobody sat across from him—so he was to be a pariah. No matter, he thought, he’d just keep his head down and look forward to a quiet semester. His resignation was short lived when Pansy sat across from him. “Who’s that boy at the Gryffindor table? Looks like a Black,” she said.
Turner nodded. “He suggested the physio, actually. He wants to get better—we’re here to provide him that space to heal if you’re willing.”
This time, he knew his wand had rolled far away from him.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “But that’s beside the point. I am going to help you learn new defensive spells.” He brandished the book he’d tucked under his arm to Potter, who carefully reached out and wrapped his fingers around the spine, taking it from Draco’s grasp.
“I just need to make sure he’s okay! I need to find some way to get into the Hospital Wing!” said a
Harry looked a little frightened at that. “I don’t even know what to say.”
“Yeah.”
“James and I crossed to see them, yes.”
“Your mother is a saint.”
She sighed and smoothed back his hair. “Oh Draco—I’ve missed you too but I do wish you hadn’t picked up all of these Gryffindor sensibilities while we were separated.”
Harry nodded, not wanting to divulge anything too personal. “They have to run some more tests later but I just wanted to stop in and say hello before the rest of my day is taken up.”
“I know the story, Seer,” Remus interrupted. “You reckon Mother Magik might be gifting Haz?”
Harry looked at Draco in disbelief, but ultimately nodded. “Fine.”
"How?"
“Harry, I need you to open the door for me,” he responded. “Is someone in there with you?”
Harry looked at Draco in alarm who shrugged. “It’ll be nice,” he said.
Harry nodded, eyes growing thoughtful and far away. “Me too, I think. I dunno what I want to do now.”
Draco nodded. “I really do.” He let out a shaky breath and steeled his nerves—
“I guess you’re right.” Harry took a breath and dove into the vision haunting his dreams. “We were in some sort of battle. I couldn’t identify where exactly but there was a lot of blood and screaming. It’s possible that it’s Hogwarts. You were healing someone and expelling so much energy you were screaming and then you suddenly collapse. I think at the very least you rip your core again and at the most you could be…”
After what seemed like an eternity of quiet, Harry sat back down, head in his hands. "I just got told off by Malfoy, and he's right," he mumbled to himself. He looked at Remus, eyes full of sorrow. "I'm sorry I keep ruining everything. I'm not so hungry anymore." And with that he disappeared upstairs.
“Well that’s very nice. I wish the same to you,” Draco replied dreamily, only to begin screaming horribly as the now wolf clamped down on him. He blacked out, feeling no more.
Remus and Bill found Draco in the same spot where Bill had left him, head in his hands and curled up on a chair by the fireplace. Remus shut the door and walked over to kneel beside him. "Are you feeling sick?" He asked, placing a hand on Draco's shoulder. Draco wished he'd be less fatherly toward him – it was driving him spare with cognitive dissonance.
“I really think you should stay in Prefects quarters this year. I know Nott has it in for you,” he heard Blaise say, concern sparkling in his eyes.
“Probably doesn’t want to be kicked out. Never thought I’d see a Malfoy in precarity.”
Draco stood up with him. “No use—I’m already awake. Want to catch an early breakfast? I’ll sit with the lions if it makes you feel any better.”
“Not so fast, you’re not,” Sirius said, his grip intensifying.
“I told Kreacher to hide it away. My guess is it’s at Grimmauld somewhere.”
Remus frowned. “I dunno, maybe sometime. I think I’d be devastated for it not to work. I’ll just wait until Christmas.”
“What does it say about me that I feel so bad for him?” Draco replied. “He tried to get Harry and the rest of us killed.”
hurt. He heard a scramble and then a glass of water being pressed into his lips. “Thanks.” He chanced opening his eyes again. He tried to sit up but was met with intense pain. He cried out.
She wouldn’t hear any of it. “Nonsense, dear,” she said. “Ronald can do with less lazing about as it is. Now, come on,” she continued, laying a few pillows down, “we don’t want you secluded in your room but I have to insist you stay put here, alright?”
“Draco, this is serious. You could get really hurt.”
“Not sure. We have to go for Bill and Fleur’s wedding anyway. It says tomorrow.”
“I was Imperiused so I honestly wasn’t scared until I was bitten.”
“Fancy a tea?” Molly asked, making Sirius jump.
The manor was eerily quiet. If Draco concentrated (which was difficult considering his splitting headache), he could hear the sound of the kettle in the kitchen, someone (Blaise, he thought) pacing back and forth a few rooms down, and a shower running down the hall in Harry’s room.
” This couldn’t be possible. He had just gotten used to the idea of having visions: he wanted no part in speaking with those who have passed outside of the Garden. Would he be haunted forever?
Remus rolled his eyes and spelled the cabinet open. “Thanks, Moony.” Remus softened at the nickname but was still on high alert. What did Sirius have to say?
Draco tried to sit up and grunted in pain. “Draco you need to stop doing that,” Remus chided, gently helping him into a more comfortable position. “They let you out to visit, then?” Remus asked the two newcomers.
Remus grimaced in response. "We can go shopping for your things once your school letter arrives."
“Alright, laugh at the unfortunate, very well. Can we let the subject matter go for now, please?” he said, not finding their amusement very amusing.
“So you came back from Paris to finish here? Why not Beauxbatons?”
The chapter also explores a depressed mental state but I feel as though if you got this far you've already seen this type of content in the story.
“I can feel your heart beating through your wrist.”
Not thirty minutes after the clothes debacle, Draco was sat in a booth in the back of one of his favorite clubs while he watched the savior of the wizarding world get absolutely trashed.
Draco wasn’t completely sure how they managed to sneak out, if they really did at all. He suspected there was an Order member or Auror lurking somewhere in the vicinity, but he thought they were pretty much home free – Harry using his Invisibility Cloak to get them past the front door. Hopefully, Draco thought, watching the green eyed boy take several shots at the bar, they’d be able to sneak back in without him tripping over his feet.
Severus nodded. “Make sure he gets seen by Pomfrey.” He headed towards class.
"It seems like the two of you get on."
“Do you get them now?”
“Have they found any more horcruxes?”
Fenrir frowned. “I know—I’m sorry about that. I definitely caught your tendon, but I wanted to make sure it would take—it’s a little difficult to will it in human form.”
Draco nodded, remembering Harry’s experience. “Fine,” he replied.
A few days later, however, Draco was observing himself in the mirror, heavily scrutinizing every aspect of himself. He’d shift every so often, getting a proper look at himself from different angles, observing his hair, expression, and physicality. Harry found him about thirty minutes into his bathroom mirror introspection, having left the door ajar. Harry grinned as Draco made faces at himself in the mirror, not used to seeing Draco this odd. “What are you doing?” he asked, causing Draco to jump in alarm.
Draco did not sleep well that night.
Instead, something strange came over him. Instincts took over and he grabbed hold of Harry’s arms tightly. He felt his magic bubbling over onto his fingertips. “
Fenrir just laughed, resting his hand on Draco’s useless arm. Draco winced. “Sorry about that—I might have gotten into the tendon a bit.”
Harry looked up in surprise at the name. Hermione had slapped Ron in the chest in excitement and Ron couldn’t hold back the grin. “Your what?” he asked.
“I know. I just feel so vulnerable, I hate it.”
“I know, I know. This is just a lot at once. Keep going, sorry.”
Harry shrugged. “Two nights in a row of nightmares will get you out of bed and ready to go, I guess,” he replied, stepping into his parents’ quarters. The large sitting room had been decked out cozily with no shortage of seating and oversized pillows. Remus always made spaces into a den and Harry loved it. Draco did similar decorating, making the Black Heir wonder if it was a werewolf thing. There was a doorway that led to a small, mostly unused kitchen, and another that led to a set of rooms. Harry tried not to think about the sleeping arrangements, knowing full well that the living Marauders’ “open love” policy was back in full swing. He was happy for his parents, if not slightly embarrassed at the thought that they, too, were full human beings with their own set of romantic needs.
Now it was Blaise’s turn to be done. Of course, there was some pent up bitterness between the two—how could they be so naïve? “Fuck off, Potter. Draco is my best friend—you abandoned him to play hero. You weren’t here for the endless nights of tears and self doubt, yet he still loves you and welcomes you with open arms. You hurt him—any wedge driving is by your doing alone, not by me just trying to help you rest so you can kill the maniac that ruined all of our lives.” How could he be so stupid to think things would ever be alright between himself and Potter? He was sending bloody courting gifts to his boyfriend for Merlin’s sake. Blaise stood, ready to stalk out of the room when Harry surprised him.
"For what? For giving him a dose of reality?" Draco scoffed. "No thanks."
increasing. Draco was so angry with himself. “I swear to Merlin if I have to have Christmas dinner with this shit hospital food I’m going to scream.” They stuck an IV back into his hand, much to Draco’s dismay. “Could’ve fucking warned me couldn’t’ve you?” he spat.
Remus checked them in and a mediwitch brought Draco back into the rooms, leaving his guardian behind. This was something he wanted to first face alone.
The two unlikely allies in seclusion made their way to the kitchen, finding Ron and Hermione having an in depth discussion with Remus. “I just think he’d be safer in our House, don’t you agree?” Hermione had said. Remus had a frown gracing his features, seemingly conflicted about something.
The Healer rushed over and did a quick scan with her wand. “Okay. Everything is normal. Sorry, the healing process is going to be a bit lengthy. You essentially donated half of your core to Mr. Potter. It needs time to regenerate.”
"So you choose to coddle me?"
Draco shrugged. “Then it’s worth it.”
Thanks for reading! Hope you liked this one :)
“Just leave it, okay? I’m fine.” He could hear Harry’s heartbeat pounding erratically.
Blaise’s eyes were shining with unshed tears and Draco looked away, not wanting to see his friend cry, nor did he want Blaise to see he was beginning to get upset as well.
“Prat,” Harry quipped, but it did lighten the mood. Harry cast a quick
Draco huffed out a laugh. “Thanks, Mr. Potter.”
Blaise looked around. “Really?”
Healer Jacobs was clearly a seasoned professional, especially considering she worked in the Anomalies wing where only the rarest cases showed up. However, even she was somewhat wide eyed as she ran James through a gamut of exams, having him drink strange potions, and provide her with historical facts about his family and the events surrounding his death.
“Who would’ve thought Draco would sacrifice himself for Harry Potter,” Remus said.
Sirius followed his gaze. “Oh, him?” he asked. “Miracle child, apparently. Harry brought him back on accident.”
“Night.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he should step in. Draco’s yelling would definitely arouse looks, notice-me-nots be damned. He looked around for his Auror guard. They were still surrounding Harry and Draco, leaning against shop walls, reading newspapers, anything that would allow them to blend in. Harry could sigh in relief at that moment. They would be safe.
Sirius nodded in understanding, thinking back to his bull-headedness in wanting Harry involved in everything Order related the previous year. “I think I was trying to be his friend more than his guardian. I wasn’t completely right in the head after everything. The Garden helped.”
Draco worried his bottom lip, a habit he picked up from Harry. “Not sure, honestly,” he responded, trying to pluck up the courage to step forward.
Remus hummed. “Remember when we all hung out? That was wild.”
Draco looked up at Sirius at that in disbelief. “Write him a letter? Are you mad?”
“Your mother is a monster.”
“We’ll come with you –“ Remus began to offer, but Harry cut him off, unwilling to cow to Remus’s outlandish suggestion.
“Ah, yes. The lack of ageing thing. Didn’t you pay attention when Severus was trying to out me?” Remus joked.
“Sorry if I’m not too keen on the guy who has been sending courting gifts to my boyfriend.”
“Am I only good in the summer, then?” Harry was suddenly angry, balling up his fists. The water sitting on Draco’s bedside table began to rattle. Draco was a bit frightened at that: he knew what the Black Heir’s unchecked magic could unleash and it hadn’t been set free in awhile. “You said you’d be here for me, or did you forget?”
“You’ve grown close.”
“His fever will not break. I’m very worried,” Remus’s voice sounded stressed.
He handed Harry the potion, who took it and sighed in immediate relief, his injured arm losing some tension. “Thanks.”
Draco nodded encouragingly at him. “Give it a minute. Call out a bit louder.”
Harry nodded at that, feeling less weary about this secret late night venture. He was quite surprised, however, when Draco led him to the tapestry room.
“Who, James?”
Remus nodded. “That’s good.” He looked at Lucius. “I’m not trying to steal your son from you, you know. I care about him a lot, though. You kind of threw him at me, after all.”
“Have you tried yet?”
“Hey, Granger?”
Draco hummed in response. "I'm sorry about your godfather. My aunt hates him so he must have been a decent human being."
“That’s kind of you, Harry.” Harry smiled at that. Draco liked that it softened his features some. It made him look his age rather than a hardened war hero. “Anyone else?”
Draco stopped him before he got there. “You’re drunk,” he said.
“Can I see him?”
“Well it’s not pretty if that’s what you’re asking.”
“Yes, please. Cream and three sugars.”
“Can we wait until I’m off bedrest? I don’t think I’ll feel clear enough to talk right now.”
Harry rubbed at his eyes as tears began to fall in earnest. “What about Regulus, though? He’s an Early Soul, why doesn’t he get to come back? Or Tonks?”
When Harry and Draco stepped through the fireplace they had thought that they had successfully finished their jaunt without anyone noticing their disappearance—at least Harry did. Draco’s sensitive hearing alerted him to the frantic footsteps and whispering of Remus Lupin. “Where are they: you have got to be kidding me!” the older werewolf exclaimed to himself.
“Typical,” Draco lamented, lying back. He tried to will himself to calm but to no avail. “What happened?”
Draco rolled to his side to look at Harry, who was smiling at him. “Well, I’m here now, and you’re here for longer—no need to miss each other any longer, right?”
He pulled away and procured a folded piece of parchment from his robes. “Your script,” the blonde said, handing it over.
That comment got a genuine laugh from the blonde. “Spending too much time with the lions, I think. I’ll have to hang out with you more once we’re discharged.”
“What happened to me? Is it the house?” the teenager in question asked, clearly shaken by his appearance.
“I’m sure he’s witnessed it. It’s just hard with the full so close. Words feel strange.”
“Good morning,” Sirius replied. “You all have a meeting with me and Headmistress McGonagall in about an hour in your common room.”
It was Remus who explained. “You had an aneurysm during the healing process and the dark magic clouded over your eye before you pushed it out—it’s a remnant.”
James sat. “Adoption spell? Lily?” he asked.
Harry shook his head. This didn’t make any sense. “But I’m not dead—I didn’t sacrifice my life.”
“I’m not in turmoil—I’m in waiting. Completely different things. But I feel at peace nine times out of ten. The afterlife is the afterlife—it’s an eventuality we all face. We’re not meant to be on the living plane forever. It’s not sustainable. It’s
Remus waved him off as he began helping them with dinner, chopping up the vegetables lying in wait. “You look really healthy considering the full was last night—looks like Dad fixed you up well and good.”
“He’s coming here?”
Suddenly, Harry was face to face with McGonagal. “A word, if you will,” she said.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand again. “I hope so too.”
Draco laughed. “You’re just cute. Sorry.”
The wit took Draco aback. He always was taught that Regulus was more stoic than his brother. Maybe death loosened him up. “I’m Draco,” he said, and Regulus’s eyes looked like they were about to pop out of his head.
They discussed how Draco was getting on in the village with the others, what their plans were for the next full, and what he has been doing to keep busy. It was only when Jack bade them goodnight that Remus began to open up.
“Only thing to keep your mouth shut,” Draco quipped, but he had to admit that he also liked when he kissed Harry. It was quickly becoming one of his favorite things to do, much to the amusement of Remus, who had walked in on them more times to count. Draco hoped that they’d be able to continue their tentative relationship outside of the privacy of St. Mungo’s.
Hermione snorted, finally responding in some way. “You didn’t seem to learn from those differences.”
-Kate
Draco had never been in Professor Dumbledore’s office before, he realized as he sat in front of the intimidatingly large mahogany desk, filled to the brim with the oddest assortment of candies and trinkets. The old man was always a bit childish for Draco’s tastes, but his parents had warned him of the Headmaster’s undeniable strength and power. They warned against being taken under the man’s wing. Draco allowed himself a snort at that one – it looked as though that was now unavoidable.
“You don’t remember?”
James smiled at the name. “Yeah, I see Lils a lot. I honestly wish she could come here: it’s kind of nice and tranquil don’t you think?”
Draco shook his head. “No, I don’t. We’re cousins.”
Harry shook his head in shame. “Honestly? No clue. I was hanging by a thread after everything and the nightmares were terrible. I was going on barely any sleep and the charms were the only thing keeping me upright. It was a bad call.”
Draco turned to look at him, eyebrow raised. "I only apologize when I've done something wrong. How have I wronged you, Potter?"
“Well, that’s exciting,” Pansy commented. “Draco darling, your husband is going to be a Quidditch star. Maybe you can be the team Healer.”
“I wasn’t insinuating you didn’t. I’m insinuating that I don’t want to put you in a situation where you have to choose the safety of those around you over yourself. It’s not a fun place to be.”
Raised the Dead—catchy, no?”
Draco shrugged.
He found him in the dining area, drinking from a cup of coffee and reading the Daily Prophet. Harry’s picture was on the cover and Remus looked put off. “What’s with the mugshot?” Draco asked, gesturing toward the cover.
Draco looked down at the bowl resting in his lap, willing himself to pick up the spoon. He frowned in frustration – he knew he wouldn’t be able to lift it; the room would not stop spinning long enough for him to focus. He slowly looked up at Harry, already burning with embarrassment. “Remus,” he managed to say, pleading with his eyes.
Harry gave a small smile back. “I’ll try to remember that.”
As always, thanks for reading, giving kudos, and commenting.
“Oh,” he replied, “I lived in America for some time – went to Ilvermory.” Hermione’s constant babbling had made some sort of impact on Harry if he was easily bringing up foreign schools. Maybe he knew more than he let on all the time.
“But the cause—“
“Watch the duvet, Potter,” Draco quipped, looking up from his desk. Ever the Slytherin, he didn’t want to show his cards just yet: Harry couldn’t know how nervous this subject made him. “Seven? No wonder he’s a bit mad.”
“We do feel a bit ill, yes, but only when it draws very near. We rest for a few days after each transformation, as that does take its toll. The effects are generally worse on wolfsbane.”
The rest of Christmas Day was pretty uneventful for Harry. After his panic attack which threw any notions of him being cured out the window, Harry let himself breathe a bit. He didn’t have to worry about being the perfect after-patient. He could be himself and that was okay.
Remus looked at Sirius for a long moment, eyes bright with worry. “I’m not sure.”
Harry, realizing Remus was genuinely upset with him, quieted down. “Sorry,” he said. “I wanted to show Draco my scars and we fell asleep.”
Draco frowned a little at that memory. His feelings were still very complicated and he hadn’t even talked to Harry about any of it. Or Blaise after that, really. He felt very much at odds.
“That one’s already accounted for,” Harry interrupted. “Dumbledore has it. What about when he first returned?”
“Starved,” said Draco, sitting with the group. Harry looked like he wanted to run. “Sit down, then, Potter. Wouldn’t want to miss all of the Malfoy gossip would we?”
“It’s all I can do to not go mad, honestly.” Draco wrapped his arms around himself, feeling small. “I’m a different person than I was a few years ago—I like to feel helpful.”
“You don’t have to see him if you don’t want to—you know that, right?”
“Mate, it won’t be that long,” Ron said, trying to appease him.
Harry took it, marveling at the tanned skin in a way that only an unbelievably drunk person could get away with. “Nice to meet you. I’m Antares Black,” he lied easily. Draco blinked at the name.
, he willed to himself. He really missed Remus at times like this.
Regulus squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “I’m not. I’m at peace. I’m just waiting.”
Harry laughed in response. It was a choked sort of laugh, like he hadn't made the sound in awhile. It made Draco feel weird. "Thank you," Harry replied quietly. "I'm still getting used to it."
“Ah,” Bill replied with a grin, “but you’re an Heir. Disowning an Heir requires a direct violation of the House’s pillars of character. You’re a bit of a snot from what my brother has said, but I doubt you could violate pillars like justice, loyalty, and intelligence that the Malfoy family derives from.”
“We’ll see.”
Jack sat on the edge of his (well Remus’s, he supposed) bed, smoothing back his hair gently. “Voldemort fell—Potter finished it. It’s all over now.”
"Fine, fine. Don't cut my head off, Malfoy."
"Well as long as you're using me for personal comfort, I guess that's fine." Harry laughed in response. It sounded like music. Draco mentally shook himself. It was like he was developing Stockholm's Syndrome or something. "What are you reading?"
you testifying for anyone?”
The blonde snorted. “Healers can’t take holidays: what if someone got hurt? Injuries are very common during Christmas, you know.”
“Ah, there it is. Full circle.” Draco just glared at him. “Done cursing, love?”
Harry shook his head. “Not really, no. But I realized that home doesn’t need to be a place. It can rest with a person.” He took a deep breath. “I think you’re my Ithaca, Draco.”
Sirius pulled him into a tight hug. “This isn’t your war, kid. You don’t have to do this alone and you’re not going to.” He pulled away, eyes shining as his said, “Dumbledore may have isolated you but we’re all in this. We’ve got you.
"Or Carrie," Remus muttered to himself. "Do you want to actually talk this through with me or are we going to have malaise all the way to the safe house?"
“No,” Draco replied. “Hogwarts is not going to be safe without Dumbledore. I can go.”
“Not necessarily—you’ve gained some social favor after saving Potter. It could be much worse.”
Hermione frowned. “I can see where he’s coming from,” she said, “what happens if we need to respond quickly? It makes sense.”
“How was the full, Draco?” he asked in an effort to not shy away from Draco’s condition.
Harry jumped as though he were realizing Draco was still there. It wasn’t a nice feeling. He frowned. “She’s okay. Thin. But she’s alive and didn’t look to be hurting.”
Draco sighed and pulled away, rubbing at his eyes. “You make it sound so simple.”
Harry hugged Draco suddenly. He was handsy when he was drunk. “Thank you.”
“Just here,” Draco commented. “I wanted to shift back alone.”
Remus scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, silently cursing the Dark Lord for leaving him alone to explain something so personal. “So in the 70s there were multiple wars going on, with the Muggles and us. There was a lot of fear associated with that – everyone was feeling like there wasn’t much time. For some of us, like Lily and James, and now Sirius, that was true.” Harry looked very forlorn at that, it was odd to see Sirius’s face twist in that kind of way – he had been taught to school his features from a young age. Remus shook himself again. “Nobody wanted to leave anything behind if they died, especially love. Polyamory was pretty common.”
They heard a quiet snort in the room, alerting them they weren’t alone. Draco looked over to see Theo sat at a table by himself staring down at a book. “Something funny, Theo?” he called over.
Remus pulled away and sized him up. “Are you feeling okay?” His eyes were crinkled with worry. “It’s going to be difficult getting you to the hospital, but we can do it if we need to. We’ll find a way.”
The older werewolf gingerly got to his feet, wincing as he did so. He put out a hand in front of the teen. “Let’s get you some tea, shall we?”
Harry nodded in agreement and he settled back into the chair.
“I’m just being truthful. If I’m not leaving today, I’ll just be in my rooms.” He turned to go and was quickly grabbed by the good arm by Fenrir.
When he next awoke, his head felt explosive and his arm felt like it was in need of severing. He groaned in pain, alerting Jack that he had finally come to. He felt a cool glass pressed against his lips and he gratefully drank, the scene feeling altogether too familiar. When he finally opened his eyes, he was met with Jack’s kind gaze, forehead wrinkled in concern. “How am I even here? I have to get back—Blaise is in trouble.” He tried sitting up, but Jack just gently pushed him back into the pillows.
Bill Weasley was there with him—he looked different in Healers’ scrubs—dark purple for his curse specialty. He had taken up post at St. Mungo’s after moving home for the foreseeable future as he helped take care of his family. He looked good in dark purple, Draco mused.
He grabbed a biscuit out of Mrs. Weasley’s goodies for him and stuffed it in his mouth to prevent any further embarrassment. His Healer didn’t need to wake Harry it seems, because the black-haired wonder in question was slowly passing by Draco’s room, much to Draco’s delight. “Harry! Am I psychic?” he wondered aloud through stuffed cheeks.
Harry nodded glumly as he pushed some of his anxiety down.
Draco sighed in relief. “Sir, I’ll live with the entire Weasley clan if that means I can be safe.”
“Sorry,” he muttered.
Remus just smiled knowingly. “Marking is special. The wolf knows you found your person.”
“You can come see me tomorrow.”
“Cissa, I’m so sorry—I should have gone in with him.”
Despite Draco’s efforts to keep Harry away from the club, they made a reappearance every night for the majority of the rest of summer break. The days were back to the old Harry – moody and silent, smoking on the balcony, barking at people who wanted to ask if he was okay. The nights were reserved for this new Antares, lighting up the dance floor with a signature Potter grin, grinding up against men and women alike.
“So, do you want to take a photo? You know, to save this moment forever?” Harry asked, his face scrunched in confusion at Draco’s tense posture.
He told Harry that he had thought about sending a letter for help right after he sent his first letter, but then Harry distracted him and he couldn’t get time alone that day to send a new letter. And then that night, he had his last vision, the Figure telling Draco that he was to get Harry’s blood, in return for the Figure not killing his loved ones, and if he didn’t comply by the end of the two weeks, his loved ones would be killed, and everyone subject to the sleeping curse would stay asleep forever. He also explained the threat that if Draco sent another letter, the figure had said something horrible would happen.
Draco hadn’t wanted Harry to complete his sentence. He knew Harry would say something along the lines of agreeing with Draco’s statement, about how they weren’t friends, and Draco’s heart couldn’t take that agreement.
“It’s alright?”
“If Drys and Olive can do it, I’m more than sure that we can, too.”
being
the Figure had said. So, if he hadn’t done anything to Harry, and he hadn’t been lying, then that meant someone else had put Harry under the body-bind…
for being on the Dark Lord’s side, and Potter was accidentally pulled along for the ride. “Potter. That’s crazy. It’s not your fault. Don’t think that.”
“Oh. That’s a silly name for a book.”
Potter looked up at Draco and smirked. “You
With a couple of quick glances over his shoulder to where he could hear Potter casting away, he hastily made his way over to a window in the very back of the library- his wand, letter, and Snape’s book in hand.
Draco was taken aback by Potter’s words. He tried to think of a witty, snarky remark that would surely end the Potter bloodline, but nothing came to him. He just stood there, staring at Potter blankly, with his mouth slightly open, processing everything he had just heard from The Boy Who Lived.
“You were protected by Hogwarts’ wards at first, the one McGonagall had put up. I don’t know how you’re resisting now however, given that the wards are broken.”
He tucked the chain under his shirt, and boldly took Harry’s hand, guiding him back to their spot in the snow.
“We weren’t friends in the beginning of these two weeks! I had it in my mind that I didn’t have to tell you anything, and-”
“I’m sorry about Alec. He was just being a git.”
coming out of the back.
Ten minutes to eight o’clock, they stopped what they were doing, and looked at each other miserably. It was time to go to group therapy with the other Eighth Years. He knew Pansy hated therapy too, but not as much as Draco did. They slowly packed up their things and headed out of the common room in silence.
Draco glared at him. He didn’t really know what else to say. All he knew he had to do was comfort Harry, even if Harry couldn’t exactly feel it through the body-bind. He had to let Harry know that Draco had not forgotten about him, and that he cared for Harry so, so much.
Harry nodded his head in agreement.
He hated it when Harry was right. Draco hadn’t been able to fall asleep for an hour; tossing and turning and trying to make out the tiny specks on the ceiling. He would have been worried for Harry’s sake because of his consistent movement, but Harry had been doing the exact same thing as Draco for the past hour, neither one of them talking. Until now.
Harry shook his hand, flinging water droplets onto Draco, which led to Draco shoving Harry slightly in a playful way, almost causing the tosser to fall into the fountain.
He couldn’t wait to find out.
He hesitated. He didn’t want to talk about how Potter had given him no credit for their potions work, and then had basically touched his Dark Mark. Also, now that his mind had slowed down and he could think clearly again, the whole Potter situation was stupid. He didn’t really care that much about a silly assignment. It wasn’t like he would have gotten much more attention and praise for his work if he’d had worked alone.
“No kidding.”
At the moment, Harry was the only thing in Draco’s world. The only person who could make time itself stop, just by existing. He wondered, by the way Harry’s eyes sparkled when he looked at Draco, if the feeling was mutual.
to him?
“Calm down. Alright?” Potter interrupted. He put his hand on Draco’s elbow again, and somehow Draco instantly felt relieved.
Narcissa smiled at him. “Ready to go, dear?”
It wasn’t like the swapping of Snape’s book was dangerous, but the thought that someone had somehow found the secret hatch, and was now in possession of a book that could reveal to you any information in the world that was known, was terrifying.
“Of course I know that, I figured that part out on my own. But for what I needed to do, three questions wouldn’t suffice. I needed to ask it
As he walked through the empty halls, his mind was spinning with one thought.
It wasn’t like he was brave enough to wear a short sleeved shirt under his robes, though.
“Maybe cast it somewhere else?” Draco said after he finished coughing.
Lucius Malfoy was another possibility, too. Maybe all this time, he wanted to get revenge on Harry, and using his own son in his terrible scheme was his cruel way of revenge. But, under all of his father’s hard outer core, Draco knew Lucius loved him. If he really had wanted to get revenge on Harry, Lucius would have never used his own son to get what he wanted. Not after the war.
“Goodnight, Potter,” Draco responded.
“Sorry we were mean to you,” said a petite third year girl who had been surrounded by a flank of friends.
“Why not make Alec the one who would be able to procure Harry’s blood?” Draco asked, seeing a weak spot and wanting to pry even farther. “Drys, you said I was the perfect candidate. But why not use your own son instead? Surely, after two weeks trapped with Harry, Alec would have been able to become close to Harry? Do you not trust him?”
Theodore Nott.
“Great, ‘cause I have a lot of work to do, and I reckon you do too.”
“We’re going to get in so much trouble-”
“I’ve heard stories like this,” Elizabeth said. “Where a wizard could escape any curse thrown at them even at their weakest, even without a wand. Mind you, nothing was ever recorded that said a person could fend off
“Mate, he’ll be fine,” Draco overheard someone whining. “Can we just go in now? I’m bloody starving!”
“Okay then, let’s get going.”
He knew that was how the world viewed him and the Malfoy name in general, but hearing Potter say it; the hero of the Wizarding World, the boy he had grown up with, his sworn enemy,
“Don’t make me take back that thank you.”
“Oh shut up, you git.”
It was a wonderful thought. He kept scratching.
“Uh, also, Madame Pomfrey, I think he’d want me to tell you this, but I think he’s uh- rather… self-conscious… about his arm. He looked pretty shaken when I saw it and I don’t think he’d want any one other than you to see…”
She nodded her head. “We talk about
Potter was dumbfounded. “Oh.” Is all he said.
Harry took Draco’s hand, leading him out to a spot where they wouldn’t have a chance of crashing into anything. Draco had never slow danced with a man before, and he didn’t know how to designate who was supposed to lead and who was to follow. But, Harry, the Gryffindor that he was, took Draco’s hands and placed them on his waist, while Harry placed his own hands on Draco’s shoulders.
you were dead. I carried your limp body up the castle. You jumped in front of the Killing Curse, to save
Draco was comfortable talking about many things. Those many things, however, did not include the war, the Dark Lord, anything even remotely related to the Dark Lord, and most of all, the scar on his forearm that signified all the mistakes he had made. A scar that would fucking be there for the rest of his life. It was just so humiliating, mortifying, shame-inducing, and any word connected to embarrassing. What was even more humiliating, was the fact that he was now having a conversation with Harry Potter himself about the tattoo on his arm that showed his allegiance to the man who had killed Harry’s parents and friends.
Now that Draco was looking at the book, which was more like a journal of sorts, Draco became optimistic.
But if he didn’t accept the offer, would his parents and friends (or in his case,
Draco nodded his head.
“Malfoy? Are you alright?” Potter asked from right outside the door.
“Really?”
Potter perked up even more when he saw Draco, and quickly jumped to his feet. “I’m guessing by the amount of time that went by, Snape was awake?”
“Yes.”
“You’re just glad it isn’t yourself getting all the attention this time, aren’t you?”
her, but more that Draco was scared of opening up and talking to her.
moving. The dull grey color it was last night when he had last looked at it, was no more. It was stark black, once again, and
a secret that was, but he didn’t. Potter continued, “What I mean is, everyone expects me to be okay, but I’m not. I don’t know if I ever will be. I haven’t come to terms with what happened with the war. It’s all too much. I look around the school, and I just have, flashbacks, or whatever, to everything that transpired here last May.
He self-consciously scratched his forearm, hating that he hadn’t had the time to secure about a million cufflinks on his sleeves. He could feel The Mark moving under his touch, and shuddered as he continued on his way to his house’s common room. He would think about his dream and Mark at a later time, but right now the priority was finding other people who were awake.
“I still don’t understand. I- you- I don’t-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco did as Harry said, and somehow, they were even closer than before. Draco’s cheek was touching Harry’s cheek, and the contact was bloody amazing. Draco felt giddy knowing he would have a photograph any minute now of the two of them in close proximity.
Harry had explained exactly how he’d been able to see Draco torture Rowle, along with many other stories about his adventures at Hogwarts and during seventh year when he was on the run. In return, Draco had vaguely told him what life was like living with the Dark Lord, leaving out a lot of the more gruesome aspects. Which was technically almost everything.
Potter was definitely right. As Draco looked down at the page, he noticed how easy the charm was to cast. The movement was two circles overlapping each other. A First Year could probably cast the spell.
killed somebody.
The food looked absolutely delicious, and much more appetizing now that he wasn’t sitting in the Hospital Wing. There were two steaming plates of veggies, roast beef, shepherd’s pie, and treacle tart.
“Oh? Do tell, Mr. Potions Master.” Draco smirked. However, he gave a good look at the liquid in the vial himself and saw that it was in fact not the Restorative Potion, but another type of potion that looked quite similar, except for a darker shade of green. “I must have grabbed the wrong potion vial off of Slughorn’s desk.” Draco peered at the green liquid more intensely. “I think this is a vial of the Bloodroot potion we brewed on the last day of class.”
He didn’t have to look up to know it was Pansy. Plus, no one else would sit down next to him.
together yet, and they didn’t know when they would, but for now they were content with how things were moving.
The tall silver gate that marked the start of the path to Hogsmeade came into view, and so did the edge of the Forbidden Forest. He was less than a minute away from saving Harry. Somehow.
there were people somewhere among the trees. They were outside of Hogwarts’ protective ward, along with the ward that Drys had allegedly put up, keeping him and Harry inside Hogwarts and Hogsmeade grounds.
Dumbledore smiled down at Draco. His eyes sparkled, and Draco felt the anger inside of him subside, replaced with a hint of courage. “Go find Harry, Draco.”
“I needed Harry’s blood because, like I said, he is one of the only known prophesied wizards- which I found out from Snape’s book. I needed his blood to break the wards of Hogwarts to let in all of my new friends, and well, his blood is precious. I’m sure I can use it for many more spells.
“This morning, I woke up, and you were sort of clutching your arm in your sleep.” Harry didn’t have to say which arm he was referring too. “I needed to know if you were harming yourself, so I could help you. I care about you so much, and I had to know if I was just imagining things or if there really was something going on that you were trying to hide from me. Something that was serious and something you needed to see professional help for.”
“Oh, Draco. Playing the hero, I see,” Drys said, “You could have had it all. You could’ve kept your precious family and
Draco nodded and turned back towards the gargoyle. Was he really doing this? Was he really going to have to face Dumbledore? At least Potter would be there with him to ease the tension, but still.
The letter shimmered for a second, and then went back to its normal self. He repeated the steps over again except with the owl this time, who did not look pleased to have a spell cast on him, and gestured for the owl to take the letter sitting on the ledge.
He was sure Harry would agree, but broaching the subject made everything so real.
Draco tugged his arm from Harry’s grasp, straightening his shirt. “I’m not really in the mood,” he stated blankly.
Harry leaned against Draco, and Draco leaned against Harry, simply enjoying what life put in front of them.
If Harry was waiting for Draco to start throwing insults, he didn’t show it. “Yeah, sure.”
are in control of the situation. Show them you are a Malfoy.”
Draco shook his head and went back to reading.
leave the bathroom door unlocked, and they could get ready for bed while he used the shower, but he was way too self-conscious for that. It wasn’t like anyone would see him, for there were shower curtains, but the thought that there was always a possibility they could was unpleasant. So, Draco cast several locking charms on the door that could not be easily opened by
Draco conceded that ‘together’ was starting to sound like such a weird fucking word.
Potter was probably right in this case though. Hogsmeade would offer answers as to whether anyone else was awake. If people were up and about, they could get help, and neither he nor Potter would have to do anything about the whole sleeping problem. They might expect Potter to do something though, since he was The Savior and all.
Harry’s breaths were becoming nonexistent, and Draco was shaking horrifically, but he had to be strong to cast the charm to make it work right. He could be strong.
“I doubt anything is wrong with the book, Malfoy,” Potter said.
“I’m positive.”
“You got the charm to work?” Draco asked, surprised but impressed.
At first, it was a chaste touch of lips, both of them unsure of what they should be doing. But, with that uncertainty came the two of them wanting to experience more, even if things were quite diffident.
That, and the fact that Harry was standing there right in front of him--the two of them alone--looking so incredibly gorgeous it made Draco’s heart hurt; so gorgeous that it overpowered any thought to flee the situation in the end.
“Goodnight, Malfoy,” Potter said in a hushed voice.
He was about to crawl back into bed when he noticed Harry was visibly trembling, sort of like he was cold. Draco knew that wasn’t the case. The Room of Requirement was the perfect temperature, catering to their specific needs whenever one of them so much as blinked. Harry must be having a nightmare.
“Together?” Harry asked.
He thought of how Draco had saved Harry’s life in Malfoy Manor, and how Harry had saved Draco’s life in the Fiendfyre. He could conjure up thousands of memories between them, good and bad (mostly bad), and yet he still could not figure out what had led him to care for the tosser.
The Death Eater’s held a silent conversation once more, and then the leader spoke. “He’ll be attending Hogwarts come September. He’ll wait in the dungeons until that time comes.”
“Yeah, they are.” Harry was staring at the names like they weren’t, though.
“Is- is this alright?” Harry asked, worried.
The noises of the room were all joining together, and Draco considered leaping out of bed in just his hospital robes and running out of Hogwarts.
, not for himself.
Potter seemed to notice Wynn’s hateful expression, and even though it looked like it physically pained Potter to speak up for Draco, he sighed and said, “Professor, Malfoy was stuck in a broom closet, he couldn’t get out. I walked by where he was stuck and heard him, and got him out. It’s not his fault he’s late, don’t punish him for something he had no control over.”
“You’re right, I did.” Drys pointed his wand at Draco, and he saw Alec moving to stand closer to Harry. “But first, you need to see this.”
Draco shook his head back and forth. He knew he had to tell Harry
“Don’t say your sorry. It’s not your fault. I did this to myself, Potter.”
Around eleven o’clock, Potter said that they should go back to the Room of Requirement, and Draco agreed. Even though he hadn’t been the one practicing magic, he still felt exhausted.
The book hadn’t provided them with any information regarding the time span of when the effects should start to work their way through a human’s body, but Draco supposed it worked like any other potion. Which meant, based on logic and knowledge, the effects of a potion should start to work between the time span of a few seconds, and up to five minutes.
He pushed a couple of books far out of reach so he could rest his elbows on the table.
“You too.”
“Okay I think I’m missing something here. Aren’t you going to be learning the spells too?”
Harry now brought both hands to cup his cheeks, and the warmth that his touch brought was exhilarating. It was perfect, and it was Draco’s. “Thank you for finding me,” Harry said. “For filling the gap inside of me.”
Drys’s plan was a good one; one that would probably work.
It was probably just some side effect of being Marked, that was all. All the former Death Eaters were probably feeling the same sort of pain that Draco was feeling, though it might be easier to see if his predictions were correct if another Death Eater were present, or if Draco could write a note to his father in Azkaban. Maybe what he and Potter should start working on was trying to break the barrier spell so they could send letters. Draco knew Potter would never go for that though. He would want to focus on saving the people, not saving themselves.
But Harry was extra insistent that day, which only irked Draco to a new height. He dropped things on the floor where Blaise and Draco were working, constantly walking by their area
“I visit McGonagall on occasion just to chat with her about… things. It was the password the last time I visited her, so,” Potter shrugged and backed away from the opening, now standing behind Draco.
“You remember what Elizabeth said to our therapy group three Fridays ago?” Harry asked.
Draco winced at the mention of the name, finding it shocking how even after everything, Potter used the Dark Lord’s name as if he was speaking of a friend. The motion did not go unnoticed by Potter, and he gave Draco a look that clearly said
Potter had literally caused an explosion in the exact right area of the library, which made the secret hatch in the floor apparent to them, and inside the hatch held a useful book that could literally solve all of their problems. Draco didn’t want to say he was an extremely lucky bloke, but yeah, he definitely was an extremely lucky bloke.
They picked themselves up off the floor, and Harry was about to open back up the book when Draco took the opportunity to grab it out of his hands. Harry gave a small
He couldn’t look Harry in the eyes; he knew he'd been too abrupt. For Salazar’s sake, they only reconciled with each other last night!
After he realized he’d been awkwardly eyeing his side table, he snapped out of the trance and sighed.
Draco sighed. “Not really, no. It’s just…”
“Hey!” Harry exclaimed, glaring slightly at Draco. Although, he didn’t seem to be too upset at the insult. “I’ll tell you how I know the layout pretty well, but you can’t tell anyone. Promise?”
Harry gave him a look that said ‘I’m sorry’ over his shoulder, and Draco gave a little laugh.
Kaspian. Draco thought the best apology would be for Potter to just end his supposed friendship with him right then and there, but he couldn’t have everything.
“Wait, you said that Alec created a fake, but the book we found that was apparently ‘the fake’ still worked,” Draco said, realization dawning on him as he spoke. “Well, it partially worked. I was able to send a letter to my father by breaking the wards you put around Hogwarts.”
Draco did indeed remember Lupin. How could he forget? The man was only brought up to him and his family about a thousand times by the Dark Lord and other Death Eaters, always being reminded that they were now related to a werewolf, thanks to Tonks, and that the Malfoy bloodline had been tainted. He also knew Lupin had died during the Battle of Hogwarts, along with Tonks. Their names had been in the newspapers for a while, in the many columns of the fallen hero's of the war.
His hands fumbled with the bed sheets as he waited in anticipation for the group to come out of the Pensieve.
He thought he heard Harry’s voice, sounding pained and concerned, but he knew he was just imagining it. A small part of him told him to go back over to Harry, but why would he do that? Why would he fight the calm, warming sensation that left his mind cleared of all worries?
“Draco, I-” Harry started, then stopped briefly to lick his lips and run a hand through his hair, which did all sorts of things to Draco. “I accept your apology. I don’t know if I can forgive you for everything quite yet, but I can tell that you’ve changed, or at least you're working on changing, and I admire that.” Harry flicked his eyes to Draco’s as he finished speaking, and didn’t move his gaze away at all. Draco felt like he wasn’t allowed to blink.
He just wanted Harry. He wanted Harry by his side again. And he wanted to never let go. Ever again. He wanted to build a new future with Harry, one that wasn’t based on lies. One that would be full of honesty and truth.
“I think I can see my constellation.”
Somehow, Harry saying, “it,” pained him more than Harry outright saying, “The Dark Mark.”
He continued to stare in bewilderment at the empty corridors, when he heard the echo of footsteps bouncing off the walls. He turned himself around to face the stairs he had just come down, relieved to know there was someone else wandering Hogwarts.
“Yeah, technically. Drys and Olive were born to Muggles, but they were obviously magical themselves.” Harry swept his finger over the signatures.
“And what is your end goal?” Draco asked, unable to help himself.
“Last time,” meant that that was because he’d told Pomfrey he was officially leaving the Wing today, right before dinner was served in the Great Hall.
Draco’s eyes widened. Was Harry really implying that he-
along with a couple silencing charms that went both ways.
“Malfoy. Malfoy! Wake up!” The figure was screaming his name. But no, that wasn’t right. He smelled soap and sweets, and the hooded figure surely didn’t smell that nice. “Malfoy!”
so no one can be sure if fending it off is even possible. But, people have stated that curses like Imperius and Crucio hadn’t had an effect on them when placed in dire situations. Especially situations that involved more than just one person.”
“But after all that time, when the war was over and I was set free, somehow not dead, I realized I needed to
Snape squinted slightly, like he was trying to read the words on the cover. “Ah, yes. That book. I remember it quite well. One of my finer achievements. You said you and Potter found it, yes?”
He leaned in closer to Draco, and Draco could feel Harry’s breath on his lips. “I don’t deserve
McGonagall’s hard exterior softened. “You’re welcome, Draco.” She pulled out her wand from inside her robes sleeve. “You have grown a considerable amount since first year. I am very proud of you, young man.”
“What’s wrong with it?” Draco questioned.
“Potter- uh. So, I had this dream last night.” Potter looked utterly confused, like he didn’t know why Draco was talking about his dreams when they were in the middle of a crisis. “I was in this weird room, and there was a hooded figure. I couldn’t see his face and he didn’t say anything except for ‘two weeks.’”
He knew it had to go back farther than when the sleeping curse had started; there was already something planted inside of Draco from their other years at Hogwarts, and all he needed to awaken that something was to spend time with Harry and only Harry for more than a week, figuring out the curse together, walking around Hogwarts together, sleeping
Or, he had to be, since the world was non-existent.
“You’ve already made your decisions, and now I make mine. You’ve done what you had thought was best for you, and now I’ll do what’s best for me,” Harry said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out Snape’s book, shoving it into Draco’s arms. “I just need time to think things over. Alone.”
“Insufferable git,” Draco said, separating from Harry.
Harry crashed into him, his feet tripping over Draco’s body, falling right on top of Draco, making him grunt in even more pain.
Back to his story.
They would probably go back to ignoring each other whenever they could, and insulting each other when they had conversations, after the whole sleeping curse was sorted out. They were only being kind to each other because they needed the other to help save the Wizarding World, and were both smart enough to understand that they would not get anywhere if they fought. They still were not friends. They only called a truce to deal with the crisis laid before them.
He felt extremely giddy and his leg was bouncing up and down; it was impossible to focus on different types of Muggle sea creatures. It was almost time to make their way down to the Garden, and Draco couldn’t stop thinking about spending more time with Harry.
Harry stepped up to the portrait of fruit, and tickled the pear; the entrance appearing and both of them walking inside, still not touching each other.
He wasn’t sure why Harry was asking for Draco’s permission to hold him closer, since he’d already been doing it basically all night, but it showed Harry cared, which made the moment sweeter.
“Well, you still had the idea.” Draco walked closer to Harry, lightly touching the box-contraption with different sized knobs and gadgets attached. “What is this thing?”
He settled with a short pat on the back; the touch slightly startling Potter. It was an extremely quick show of affection, but it made Potter smile a small sad smile, which Draco knew was a win. His eyes were red and puffy, his expression still heartbreakingly sad, but that smile made Draco want to reach out to Potter again. He was about to act on his intention when Potter shifted slightly away in his seat, presumably trying to hide his tears, so Draco’s hand fell to his lap.
He felt a pair of strong, yet consoling, arms surrounding him. Harry was hugging Draco, and Draco found he was hugging Harry too. He was crying into Harry’s shoulder, getting snot and tears all over Harry’s shirt. He felt Harry rubbing small circles on his back, and then he felt wary fingers carding through his hair.
Draco eyed his mother nervously, silently pleading for help, but she just shook her head and made her way through the maze of people, probably heading to talk with anyone she could find.
Apparently, Harry had visited Draco every night while he was still in a some-what-coma, until one night, the first time the Aurors had visited Hogwarts, they’d flat out barged in to the Hospital Wing, demanding to know exactly what happened. Harry had offered his memories, but they weren’t clear enough, and the Aurors became even more furious. Of course, everyone at that point already knew that Draco and Harry had been the only ones awake during the sleeping curse.
There were millions of possibilities that could happen over the next two days, and Draco already knew what he wished one of them would be: for Harry to never stop looking at him like he was now. Eyes full of sweetness and care.
It was funny how words could lose value as quickly as secrets revealed themselves.
Draco took a deep breath, he had studied for hours for this exam, and he knew the content pretty well. But his grade all depended on what kind of mood Wynn was in.
He basically had to re-think everything he had ever known- something he had specifically done only a couple days ago when he’d figured out he had a
Draco nodded. “My aunt would probably go spare knowing that her Ancient and Noble House was being utilized as a safehouse for the Light.”
Harry just shrugged. “It’s been a long seven months. Is my first name really Harrison? I’ve just been going by it.”
“So what if you did?” Harry challenged. “We can have this conversation as many times as you’d like but I’m still not going to change my mind about being with you. If you turn me, you turn me. It’s not a death sentence. It’s not the end of the world.” He pulled Draco into his arms, who collapsed onto his knees next to him. “Besides, two of the greatest men I know are werewolves. Can’t be all that bad.”
Sirius had told him not to worry about it, kissing the top of his head gently as Remus toted him, Draco, and the rest of the kids off to King’s Cross with a fleet of Aurors. Sirius, for obvious reasons, did not join them. Nobody really knew he was alive and although there had been proof submitted to the Ministry of his innocence, the process was slow-going. It was best to lie low. He rubbed his face tiredly as he saw them off, wishing he had more time with Harry.
Draco nodded. “It’s definitely an uncomfortable feeling but I’ll be okay. I’m more worried about Harry and Ron—they’re a bit more sensitive to the malaise, it seems.”
“Oh hah-hah.” But he was grinning: always a Marauder. “What are you two lovebirds doing up so early, then?”
Draco glared at Harry but was trying not to smile. He supposed he was rather rude to the Weasley family. His father had always instilled an annoyance for them for some reason: maybe there was some hidden feud he didn't know about. "You seem to have developed the same allergy as of late."
The reality of being stuck in his new body suddenly washed over Harry like ice water. He wasn’t even thinking about Hogwarts – it hadn’t crossed his mind that he would still look like this when school resumed. “I’d rather crawl under a rock than return to Hogwarts like this,” he said, almost resigning himself to doing just that. He barely survived the rumour mill surrounding himself and the Chamber of Secrets in Second Year, never mind the campaign against him during the Triwizard Tournament. He suddenly felt very tired at the prospect of going on.
“Well, hello.” Remus rummaged in his drawer and procured a chocolate bar, offering it to Draco. He took it gratefully. “How are you feeling?”
“Oh, I understand. You’re a bloody coward is what I understand.”
been close to a battle before—there had been no coup in taking Malfoy Manor, with his father essentially opening the door to the Dark Lord as soon as he could manage. He was, however, used to the constant stench of fear and death, which now increased tenfold with his wolfish sensibilities. His job in all of this was to try and remain hidden, healing those that came to him along the way. He spent hours in the midst of chaos healing cuts and bruises, even mending bones and minor spell damage where he could. Of course, this plan of lying in wait went right out the window when he witnessed Blaise take a hit to the chest with a curse he didn’t recognize, causing him to drop unceremoniously to the floor.
“When did you get so wise?” Draco mused.
Draco shook his head. “I just thought about wanting it and it appeared in my lap. It startled me.”
“How are we going to properly sneak away when everyone is awake?”
Draco jumped and pulled away from Remus. “You’re back,” he said, trying to wipe the tears away.
Bill huffed out a laugh, eyes bright. “They’re surprising. One minute they’re pulling pranks and the next they’re the most nurturing souls.” He looked straight ahead, blinking back tears. “It’s really hard right now, honestly.”
Harry nodded, steeling himself. “The dead came to me. From all sides. It-“ he paused again. “They were clamoring for my attention. Fred gripped me tightly and said so much. He wanted me to tell Ron something, but I can’t remember. My mum was there talking to me. Even Cedric. Even…” he started to get worked up again about it, feeling nauseous all over again.
“I know it wasn’t. But those who were in that place were Confunded or dead.” Some objects began to shake and Harry began to count his breaths until he settled. “I’m sorry,” he said again. He wasn’t going to fail is Mind Healer by losing his cool here. “Accidental magic is my new specialty it seems.”
Draco shrugged. “I think Finnigan but I’m sure he has other ways.”
He asked his parents, “Is this morning’s headline going to make things more difficult for you?”
Harry shrugged. “I’m not. My brain doesn’t want to calm down enough to not give me nightmares.”
Draco gazed down at Harry and couldn’t help but smile at the view. His new, thick frames he got after shattering his in the horrid affair complimented his new looks well. Harry, sensing this, opened his eyes and glared. “What?” he asked.
He walked over to where Potter was still standing, facing a shelf that Draco was sure had a chair sitting in front of it at one point.
Draco had to admit, he’d never been more mortified in his entire life.
“Well, we’re here,” Potter said as they arrived at the gargoyle signifying the entrance to McGonagall’s office.
“Oh! They’re good. I mean, as good as classes can get.”
He knew Potter wasn’t going to give up. But neither was he. Potter would either stay in Hogwarts or go to Hogsmeade alone. That was that.
So, Draco carefully pulled up his pyjama sleeve, and unwrapped the bandage. He was sure his heart stopped beating in his chest for at least five seconds. It had to. The Dark Mark was
“You’re resisting,” Drys said, “how peculiar.”
Throughout the rest of their meal, they talked to each other as if they had been friends for years, and it made Draco feel like he was floating.
No one could come inside the school grounds, unless they were invited in by the Headmistress herself.
“Harry, just
“We are going to do something different than stare at paper all day again. Something actually productive,” Draco said. He took out his wand and held it in his free hand.
“It seems like it. I don’t think this was here before. I just came here on Thursday, and I didn’t notice anything like this then. It must have just gone up…” Potter lowered his wand to the ground, bending down with it, and picked up a rock the size of his palm with his free hand. Draco just watched Potter, not really understanding why Potter needed a pet rock right this second.
Harry grinned and kissed Draco briefly. “Do you mind if I…”
It was obvious what Drys’s plans were for the duel: he wanted to tire Draco out so that he would admit defeat, starting with simple spells and working his way up to complex ones that would certainly break Draco’s wards, causing him to use his magic over and over again to keep putting the wards up; draining him.
Draco shared a room with Blaise, Theo, and two other Slytherin’s named Jorah Davis and Calder Robins. They were the only Slytherin boys who had returned as Eighth Years. The girls consisted of Pansy, Daphne Greengrass, Milicent Bulstrode, and Jorah’s twin sister, Tracey.
“Yes.”
“Once I was awake, Father told me to go and get you, Malfoy, after I got Potter, and that I was to stun you and levitate you to the edge of the forest. But, you heard me coming, and I couldn’t risk you finding out I was there until you confronted my father. I was in the Slytherin quarters though, so I figured I’d throw you off my trail by leaving a green tie.”
Harry shook his head, smiling. “I think you got it wrong. It’ll be the other way around.”
“What about you? Got any big plans?” Harry implored.
He wanted to tell him how this was the best gift he could have ever received, that this was all he’d ever wanted, but he didn’t want to ruin their moment with a mushy heart-to-heart.
or not, but decided against it. Definitely
Draco stilled, taking in Harry’s words. Draco hadn’t apologized to anyone, besides Harry, and there Harry was, the hero of the war, apologizing to quite literally every person he ran into, for… what? Saving the world? And what has
“Okay, thanks.” He did not want to hear the rest of what she had to say. He knew all about the skin where the Dark Mark was. He knew no matter how much you marred it, it would always magically heal itself.
The next day was a Friday, and that meant it was getting even closer than Draco’s liking to the one week check point that marked the day he had woken up to a school full of sleeping bodies. And that meant he and Potter only had one week until something surely terrible happened.
When they arrived at Transfigurations and Potter opened the door to the classroom, all heads from inside the classroom turned towards them as they walked through the door. Potter walked in casually, a little tense around the shoulders, while Draco slowly inched his way in, head bowed but eyes up.
Draco was definitely startled at the question. “What for?” he asked. In reality, it wasn’t like he couldn’t remember almost all of the things he’d done over two weeks, but that there were
Draco still felt stiff, and his body was filled with doses of pain, but he knew he felt ten times better than he had the last couple times he’d been slightly conscious.
was supposed to have.
was all that Draco wanted to say. Before one of them entered into a near death experience again.
“You have to reveal a deep, meaningful secret,” Draco declared, “and once you do that, you only get to ask it three questions. Severus Snape told me himself.” He was stating the obvious, but he felt like it must be said.
“I guess I understand.” Draco swallowed, pushing back the bout of nausea that was starting to rise. “I- I want to try and live a normal life as well.” It was a half-lie.
“Is the day before the sleeping curse happened,” Harry finished, understanding of the situation washing over him.
“Yes, but Harry, now really isn’t the time.”
Draco scoffed. “You could be wrong, you could be right. Who knows. What really matters here is: We. Don’t. Have. A. Cure. We’re stuck in a school with sleeping bodies, and absolutely no means of escape. On top of all that, it’s almost Saturday. Which means it’s almost Sunday. And Sunday, I assure you, something bad will happen.”
“Well that’s a relief.”
He wasn’t in his bed. He was gone.
Had he used a defensive spell on someone? Had he used an Unforgivable?
“So you’re telling me-” Draco shook with rage- “That this book we’ve relied on for days and days and
Potter had pointedly not spoken to Draco since the moment they had woken up Friday morning. Draco was sure Potter was upset with him due to Draco wasting their day yesterday.
The next song that came on was another slow song, and they both didn’t seem to mind. They stayed pressed against each other, swaying slowly to the song.
“I’ve heard plenty of stories, you know,” Theo remarked, trying to come off nonchalant. “No one seems to know the correct one, though. There’s ‘Oh, did you hear how Malfoy killed Alec’s father?’ and also, ‘Did you know Malfoy intentionally set Hogwarts under a sleeping curse to murder them at their weakest?’”
locked away in a prison cell all summer, and at Hogwarts he barely had time to exercise, since most of his time was spent studying and keeping his head down, not drawing attention to himself.
The swirling, sickening sensation as he’d transported into the moment that changed Drys forever.
He knew he had possibly killed Drys.
And through the entrance came Pansy, running towards him and sobbing her heart out.
Draco’s stomach clenched and his eyes burned. Had one of his professors
Professor Wynn looked towards Potter, a wide grin spreading across his face.
all wounds, along with reviving people, only if cast perfectly right.
“Hello, Draco,” the Figure said. Draco assumed he was smiling maniacally under his hood.
Pansy rolled her eyes in return and whacked him in the elbow with a book. She playfully hit him quite a lot, he realized.
During the middle of a crisis, Draco and Harry are still allowed to have fun, right?
“Try me. We’ve got all the time in the world, really.”
Draco thought about their last group therapy session. He thought long and hard, trying to remember some word Elizabeth had told them.
“Now remember class, this potion is very lethal. One splash on your skin and you’ll be obliterated from existence.”
Draco tried to form a coherent sentence. His throat was clogged and the world felt dizzy. “I killed him, Harry. I killed Drys. I even killed my own father.”
“Are we just going to take turns asking that question?” Draco retorted.
“How very Gryffindor of you,” Harry remarked as he started walking towards the sound himself, completely disobeying Draco’s wishes.
the one who has Snape’s book! You replaced it with a decoy!”
The same scenario happened where the Purebloods in Hogwarts died, and then Draco was taken to the Ministry, Drys pinning everything that happened on Draco. Everything was basically the same, except this time around, Draco didn’t care. He felt light as he’d watched the deaths, and he felt nothing as he was escorted into a holding cell, awaiting a trial that would end in his death.
“Thank you, Pansy.”
“Draco,” Harry said. Draco knew what he would say next. It was the very thing he had hoped to hide from Harry, possibly for forever. “It was
“Alright, fine. Go back to Slughorn and tell him I basically did all the work. Then I’ll forgive you.”
Draco was beyond shocked. He was wondering whether or not he was dreaming again.
, which instantly slowed down Draco’s movements so that he couldn’t cast any spell.
option- the one where you refuse to take my blade, would mean your family dies. Everyone under the curse stays asleep forever, slowly deteriorating until they die too. I will make sure that everyone who is left in the Wizarding World knows it is
Two: He most definitely, inexplicably, undoubtedly, had a crush on Harry Potter.
Within that week, all the details of the Malfoy family trials had been out for the public to see, in the
But those memories washed away, and what replaced them was the good moments. The moments of them two actually getting along and working together. The two of them sharing jokes, and even sharing a bed. Draco apologizing to Harry, and Harry saying sorry to Draco for all of the horrors he had to encounter. Actually becoming friends, something Draco had wanted ever since he had found out about the Boy Who Lived.
They would never match. Draco would have to accept that. He sort of already did, but a small, small part of him whispered in the back of his mind, “you could be friends, if you just tried.” He knew that would never be true, but that little part of him did hope.
“What do you mean?”
cast the spell to make the stairs change, was pretty cool.
He neared Slughorn’s desk, and scanned it over one time, looking for a clue or something.
“I couldn’t have anyone in the way of my plan, either. Potter was in Hogwarts, surrounded by people. I can’t touch him. Only people who are permitted in Hogwarts are even allowed to be around Potter, and the spell which would break Hogwarts’ wards, required the blood of someone prophesied, and had to be cut by the hand of a person close to the prophesied one; they had to mean a great, great deal or else the spell wouldn’t work.
Harry bloody Potter.
“I guess we just say a secret,” Potter stated. They were close enough to each other that Draco could slightly feel Potter’s breath on his face, and the feeling made his skin tingle.
“Probably, knowing Drys. But it’s nothing we can’t figure out. We still have a good amount of time before the school year ends.”
Harry was shaken, literally and figuratively. Though, the literal part might have had to do with the freezing temperature. “Oh,” Harry whispered, facing the whirring snow again but not shifting farther away from Draco.
Harry finally turned to look at him for the first time since they sat down in their respective spots. Draco had to bite down on his lip to keep himself from smiling.
” Draco said helplessly. “I spent all of sixth year fighting my task of killing Dumbledore. In the end I didn’t kill him, and I told myself I would rather die than plot someones murder ever again. It’s just weird, no matter how evil Drys was, that after all that time agonizing over the task
Draco was hesitant on what exactly he should do. He didn’t know how to comfort people. Especially people he was enemies-turned-sort-of-friends with. He wanted to sleep badly, he didn’t want to spend another second awake and worrying about the figure’s offer.
“You- you
“I’ll spill a ‘deep, and meaningful’ secret. If that’s what’ll get you to stop moping.”
It had been late at night and Draco had been exhausted, so Potter reluctantly agreed they should head to the Room of Requirement.
for the man he was supposed to hate.
Draco coughed awkwardly and willed himself to look Harry directly in the eyes. “Can we talk?”
“I’m sorry, I forgot what you had gone through with this room when I had announced we should use it.”
Muggle-borns were just as powerful as Purebloods. No question about it.
“Okay,” Potter said evenly.
Draco was even more angry at himself, learning that even though Hogwarts and Hogsmeade were under a curse, the rest of the Wizarding World was perfectly fine. He’d
“What do you mean by ‘bisexual’?”
After a while of sitting around and doing absolutely nothing, he made his way onto a balcony, and found a bench to sit on. Inside was way too claustrophobic, and there was luckily no one else out on the balcony.
“I’d say otherwise.”
“This might be too personal a question to ask, and I totally understand if you don’t want to answer it,” Harry rambled, his eyes still searching Draco’s. “But, how- how did you get this scar?” Harry finally lifted his head, his hand slowly reaching out to touch Draco’s right cheek, hovering over the scar that was there, silently asking for Draco’s permission to touch.
Potter pulled up the handle, and the hatch came loose so that Potter could physically pick up the square plank of wood and move it aside. Draco peered over Potter’s shoulder, and inside the hidden compartment he could see a book. A dusty, old, leather book that was about the size of Draco’s hand.
Once they had finished their odd dinner- or what he should call a late night snack- they stood up and rearranged their chairs back to where they were placed before. Potter reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out a couple galleons, setting it on the table. Draco felt like he should say something about how he could pay for himself, but when he reached into his own trouser pocket, he felt nothing, and remembered he hadn’t put any money in his pockets, as he had thought he wouldn’t be needing it. It was weird having

“While you were off doing… who knows what you did, with Potter, I used what you gave me.” He made a grandiose gesture at the Death Eaters. “And now, you can meet my new friends.”
“Isn’t this copying?” Harry had said months ago when Draco had suggested creating their own Garden.
He stopped in front of the Slytherin common room entrance, wondering if he should check in there- Harry knew the password, since he’d heard Draco say it multiple times- when he decided to first check Slughorn’s classroom.
“No! We’re not-- we’re not anything, Pansy.”
“You think?” Draco said through gritted teeth. He tried pulling away once more, but he couldn’t.
promptly cleaning up the blood on Draco’s face and fingers. He was lucky that blood hadn’t ended up on his grey jumper; it was a really nice Muggle jumper.
currently in Azkaban, rotting away with Lucius. Though, escaping Azkaban had never been a problem before.
Draco hadn’t used Occlumency that night, finding he wanted to speak to the figure again. About many things that couldn’t yet be explained. He knew if he had a chance to encounter the figure again, it wouldn’t be likely he would answer any of Draco’s questions, but Draco wanted to try at the very least.
Draco was speechless. The gem obviously meant a great deal to Harry, and he was giving it to Draco. It was still hard to process the fact that Harry considered Draco a friend, and that Harry actually cared for Draco.
Draco’s face fell even farther. “Right.”
“It doesn’t matter who this man is. He’s a nobody.” Draco chanced a withering glare at the Figure, and saw that he was watching Harry and Draco thoughtfully, almost with an amused smile.
