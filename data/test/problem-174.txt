“How long is it meant to…” he began to ask, but he didn’t bother to finish the sentence as a creeping discomfort seeped from his stomach.
She looked at him with big, watery eyes and a trembling lip for a moment before bursting into tears again and flinging herself into his arms. It took him a moment to catch-up with what was happening and wrap her into a hug, trying to not look too panicked as her parents frowned at him.
“We didn’t have a quick catch-up on each other’s lives, Maggie. Potter and I really aren’t friends.”
Despite not being a full Healer, she’d learnt some tricks over the last few years. He winced as she cast some kind of diagnostic spell that felt like someone was slowly lowering him into an ice bath.
“I’m going to take Ron his hangover potion,” Hermione said tactfully, getting up and making a swift exit as Harry stumbled around for an explanation.
As he sat down, Blaise asked loudly, “Are you feeling okay, Draco? That was a very long bathroom break.”
Pansy and Millie were dressed to the nines: Millie’s dress was blue with gold piping and knee-length with a skirt that flared out in layers like petals. Over the top, she wore a cropped robe that fell to her elbows. Pansy wore a black sheath dress (impeccably tailored to her curves by Draco, of course) with a sheer gold cloak draped over her shoulders, falling to her ankles. Greg had traded his bartender’s uniform of a black t-shirt and jeans for black robes, which fit him nicely, making up for the slightly dull choice of colour. Blaise had opted for a claret cloak and grey trousers, and Theo wore his walnut-coloured robes with artful nonchalance.
It was a practical movement, he needed a looser measurement so he didn’t make the collar too tight for Potter to breathe, he’d done it a hundred times with his friends and other customers. There was no reason for it to feel any different, except that it was
“No one turns up on time to a party, Potter,” he said, checking his watch. They were only (a fashionable) two hours late.
Harry saw himself wearing his two hundred Galleon robes in the back garden of Grimmauld Place next to Luna in her turnip earrings and Arthur Weasley, who’d recently discovered Hawaiian shirts. Ron and George suddenly appeared in this imagined scene — dressed normally in jeans and shirts — falling over each other in hysterics. He winced.
The resulting compromise was that the cleaners didn’t come into his office much any more, which suited everyone (including the mice) just fine.
Harry lunged for him, pushing him back so his head landed on the arm of the loveseat, Harry’s hands bracketing his face. They kissed fiercely and Draco didn’t even try to keep quiet, moaning into Harry’s lips as he fisted one hand in the back of his hair, pulling him closer. He tried to wrap the other around Harry’s waist, but it quickly got tangled in the never-ending folds of his cape and he grunted in frustration, reaching up to the clasps at his breast.
“Hello Draco,” Luna said, drifting over from the other group. Her long blonde hair was plaited in a complicated braid that she’d looped around her neck like a scarf. Bedazzled radishes hung from her ears and she wore a knitted jumper depicting a farmyard scene, Draco guessed. He couldn’t be sure because the jumper was inside-out. It was a comical sight standing next to Harry in his dress robes.
A white coffin covered in a spray of white and pink lilies hovered above the empty ground, suspended by magic. He blinked and was in two places in time: in one, he held Maggie’s hand as she told him a story about her grandma; in the other, he stood alone in a cemetery, levitating his mother’s coffin into the ground as the grey clouds spat at him.
“No,” Harry said, shortly. “Because I don’t think there’s any law-breaking, I think we’re just overstepping our boundaries and working on a tip from some bigot who’s making shit up.”
“A sleepover,” Luna corrected, pulling the throw cushions off the sofa and making a nest on the floor close to the fire. The other three chose chairs.
A far-away corner of his brain speculated on the logistics of being Splinched like that. You’d probably die, he mused. Someone would have to find you immediately if you were to have any hope of being stitched back up…
“Ah, yeah, it’s not too bad.” He ran his fingers over his cheeks, the day’s stubble catching on the calluses on his palms. He didn’t want to talk about work, but they were still on the fourth floor, so he latched onto another topic. “How’s Malfoy?”
“Piss off George,” Harry said cheerfully. He met Draco’s gaze across the table and smiled at him. Draco’s cheeks flushed lightly.
Hermione shot her husband a disapproving side-eye. “Are you sure it’s not just a coincidence? You said it yourself, he hasn’t exactly been acting nefariously when you’ve seen him.”
He went back to the hem, checking it was even. The issue with work was Draco had got to a point where so much of it was muscle memory that his mind was free to wander and it was only interested in wandering in one very specific direction.
“Mmm,” she hummed. “No pressure but you better make the best robes anyone’s ever seen… I’d like to at least stay open until Christmas. I think my parents have a bet with Granny that this place will fold before then.”
Sweaty and tired, Draco threw open the windows. The breeze curled around the room, rustling through the clothes. He left the window and the curtains open as he stripped off. It was too hot for modesty, and it wasn’t as if anyone would see.
He stalked to the nearest Floo Station in a terrible mood. The wizard behind the bar didn’t look up as Draco burst in and headed straight for the fireplace.
who said ‘Potter’, not just me. Holy fuck!” he swore as Potter appeared at his elbow, still holding the baby.
Some nights they would stay up late drinking red wine and Hermione would explain to them Muggle card games that the Dursley’s had never played. Ron would then teach them the magical variation, and they’d create some kind of hybrid of the two, making up increasingly ridiculous rules. Harry would end up crashing in their spare bedroom.
Maggie had once again beaten him to the shop on Monday morning. Before he could comment on the rarity, he noticed the reason why inspecting their stack of fashion magazines in the sewing room — Muggle and wizarding alike — her wrinkled hands clutched behind her back, as if she was afraid of touching anything. Maggie was nowhere to be seen, though a personal Healer in their green-trimmed uniform was making three cups of tea in the cupboard that passed as a kitchen.
Draco opened his mouth to snap that he didn’t realise being guided by a greater purpose was a requirement of being a groundskeeper, but Harry put a hand on the small of his back, cutting him off. Harry’s ribs expanded beneath Draco’s palm as he took a deep breath.
Maybe it was the combination of post-work out fatigue and sudden Apparition, but as he landed in the alleyway next to Malfoy’s shop, he was hit with another wave of vertigo, like the one in the coffee shop two days earlier. It was so strong he had to hold onto a wall for a moment to stay upright.
“Shut up!” His wand twitched away from Draco to Theo for a second. He took a step closer to Draco. “I said
Bill’s head jerked up, and he flicked a strand of hair behind his ear with practised ease. Draco realised Bill was
The initial plan had been to go to a restaurant, but payday wasn’t until next Friday and Draco’s wallet was unpleasantly light so he had suggested an intimate dinner party instead. It went without saying that it wouldn’t be at the Manor, so Blaise had stepped up and offered his (though, really, his mother’s) townhouse.
“Yeah, it was a nightmare though — apparently psychics and physics are different things?” she said, holding up the book she was browsing so Harry could see the cover:
“I’m not really sure,” Potter said hopelessly. “There’s this charity ball I have to go to and I just thought that I’d need new ones. I haven’t bought new robes since the Yule Ball. Do you have any recommendations? I’m kind of hopeless with this.”
at his mercy. Like the time on the Hogwarts Express in Sixth Year, except that Potter wasn’t hexed, he was standing so still under Draco’s fingers by choice. Did he feel as vulnerable as Draco felt powerful in that moment?
He rubbed his hand up and down Draco’s back, bringing back memories of evenings spent listing the things that made them happy.
It had been quiet, even for a Wednesday. They hadn’t received any new orders in weeks, and without a steady flow of customers to see to, Draco listlessly sketched ideas for robes that he didn’t have the fabric to make as he watched the seconds tick away.
“Oh, you don’t have to rush out on my account,” Harry said quickly as he also stood. “I could make you another cup of tea…” A glance down told him that Kingsley’s mug was still half full.
The thugs appeared to have finished most of the destruction. There were some stragglers leafing through the piles of designs and fashion magazines on the shelves, but the rest were standing around in pairs or threes, talking in low voices and looking disgruntled.
A memo shot through the crack at the bottom of his door and hovered above his desk before gently floating down. It came to a stop on top of the raid report. Harry’s heart lurched as he recognised the MLEP-headed paper and he picked up the paper.
He was all-too aware of the barista’s wide eyes and the curious mutters of the people queuing behind him and he shook off Ginny’s hand lightly.
Harry’s mouth fell open, and he had to force it shut consciously, his lips thinning out into a tight frown as Ginny grabbed a handful of Floo Powder and gave him a jaunty, casual salute as she disappeared in a whirl of green flames. Kreacher retreated, muttering under his breath and leaving Harry alone in the living room, staring at the fire.
She laughed and pushed him away, but held onto his hand for a moment. “Let me know that you’re okay,” she said, giving him a hard stare.
The Snitch’s charm must have worn off slightly in the past seventeen years. When Draco eventually turned around, it had only flown to the middle of the small pitch and it barely moved a foot before Draco caught up to it.
it,” he said with a laugh. “Didn’t even realise how much I hated it until I quit and suddenly there was just this weight lifted from my shoulders.”
From a drawer in his desk, he pulled out a stack of files that was so comically large that Harry was sure he was joking. But Robards didn’t join in with his small chuckle and the mirth quickly died. He took another look at the files with dread.
Draco sighed and stretched his neck back, scrutinising the Muggles behind the bar. He assumed Layla was the tiny blonde woman pulling pints in a stretchy tank top that showed off her impressive cleavage. Very much Greg’s type.
“Well,” Rolf shrugged, a cheeky grin stretching across his wide mouth, “who could have predicted that?”
The lift shuddered to a halt on the fifth floor and the doors creaked open. No one was waiting on the other side. Parkinson grunted and jabbed the button to close the door several times. It responded lethargically and did the same on the fourth floor.
Harry extended his hand like he was asking for a handshake. Draco took it like Harry was asking him to hold a Flobberworm and anger flared bright in Harry’s chest. They were doing everything Draco wanted: he could be
When he’d first joined the Aurors, he hadn’t expected there would be quite so many meetings about future meetings. His hands itched to go back to his office and take a look at the evidence for himself. Robards eventually finished setting out the day’s schedule and dismissed everyone. As they stood and gathered their belongings, heading for their offices, he called out Harry’s name.
They groaned and got to their feet and lazily pulled on their clothes — far more wrinkled than they had been an hour ago. As Draco tucked in his shirt, Harry buttoned up his. They didn’t bother with their cloaks (or, in Harry’s case, waistcoat, bowtie and two layers of cloaks). Lazily, Draco cast an anti-wrinkle charm, but he wasn’t paying much attention and it wasn’t his finest work: his silk shirt definitely bore the signs of a lengthy stay on the floor, but they at least no longer looked like they’d been dragged through a bush backwards.
Draco glanced down at Harry’s shoes (trainers) and looked faintly disgusted. “Spend at least twenty Galleons on them. Actually, forget that, don’t buy anything without showing me first.”
He looked up to see Potter approaching him, full Auror-mode, his red cape snapping behind him with definitive authority. He could tell the moment he recognised Draco lying amongst the vinegared vegetables; for a second, the professional façade disintegrated, leaving Potter looking a lot more like a twenty-six year old than an experienced Auror, but then he snapped back to the job at hand.
Harry snorted. “I’m not Ron’s number one priority — you’re making it sound like I’m his bit on the side.”
By Monday night, however, the fantasy was wearing thin: the pounding music had given him a headache and if he read any more trite gossip on Z-list celebrities, his soup-like brain was going to fall out of his ears. The dullness of reality had to sink in at some point. His stomach rumbled, and he knew his parents wouldn’t call him for dinner. His friends weren’t on glamorous holidays that were worth owling about. The thought of having enough money to buy even an old Cleansweep was laughable.
It was still ten minutes until midnight, but the glitz of the ball had lost its enchantment. All Draco wanted now was to go home and leave those robes in piles on the bedroom floor (and maybe make a case for why they needed to at least extend the hut to have a bedroom big enough to fit a king-size bed).
Harry laughed and pressed a kiss to the corner of his mouth, his hand snaking around Draco’s waist and staying there. Even through the many layers of thick fabric, Draco fancied he could feel the metal band of Harry’s ring. They were still so new to Draco that he was hyper aware of their presence.
Over her shoulder, Draco met Maggie’s damp eyes and started mouthing along to Madam Malkin’s well-worn speech. He heard it every time the woman dropped in. The corners of Maggie’s mouth trembled and she bit her lower lip in an attempt not to laugh as she turned back to her grandmother.
He reached for a bottle of wine. “There was a raid,” he said as he poured a large glass. “I thought beforehand it was a bad idea, and that we were overstepping our bounds. Turns out I was right, and even though everyone also knew it was a total bust, they didn’t seem to really
Draco blinked, taken aback by the sudden aggression directed at him. Greg had never dared to challenge Draco on anything before.
Losing the cloak and the jacket made Harry shiver. Malfoy lifted his arms up, leaving them hanging at ninety degrees to his chest as he fiddled with the armholes in the waistcoat. His hands gripped either side of Harry's ribs and slid down to his waist. Was he imagining the slight squeeze?
ness but Potter didn’t budge. In fact, he had a blank expression like he wasn’t paying any attention to what Draco was saying. He blinked a couple of times and then shook his head.
He’d dozed off in a hundred classes, staring at Potter messing around with his friends, seething with hatred — but a different hatred to how he felt about Granger and Weasley. His hatred for Potter made him squirm in his seat, wouldn’t let him take his eyes off him when they were in the same room, an intense, primal hatred that maybe wasn’t hatred after all.
Any pretence of decorum had gone, along with any ability to form coherent thoughts. Only a few words remained that fell from Draco’s tongue without conscious thought. Words like
Harry was in the middle of trying to force a self-conscious smile and an awkward insistence that it wasn’t necessary when the world suddenly slid out from under him.
The next morning, he went to work with a sense of purpose he hadn’t felt in years. He waved at Belinda in the corridor but skipped his usual trip to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee and sat straight down at his desk, grabbing a blank MLEP enquiry form which folded itself into a paper aeroplane and zoomed away when Harry pointed his wand at it.
Theo straightened and swallowed, then nodded and plastered on a smile. He handed the bloodied handkerchief back to Draco with a soft thanks. They paused as they exited the bathroom and saw Potter leaning against one of the walls, his arms crossed and watching the Muggles with vague interest.
it announced along with a photo of the man himself, holding an Azkaban slate in his claw-like hands. If it hadn’t been for the occasional blink, Draco would have thought it was a Muggle photo. Then, under the mugshot, a smaller subheading read
Draco yelped and grabbed him by the shoulders and spun to face him, pulling him into a tight embrace which Harry returned reflexively.
“Alright, you four, line up against that wall over there,” an Auror ordered. She was tall, with sleek dirty blonde hair slicked back into a low ponytail. She gestured to the wall, looking bored by the ordeal as Draco, Pansy, Millie and Blaise followed her instructions.
“Nothing, don’t worry about it,” Malfoy said smoothly. Harry frowned. He wouldn’t have expected Malfoy to be so charitable to a Muggle.
“Yeah, well, seeing as it’s my business and all, I feel like I should try and be here for opening at least once a week.”
Malfoy blushed — an actual, obvious flush of pink sprayed across his cheeks and nose, unmistakable against the whiteness of his skin — and Harry’s stomach dropped. The same tension as earlier sparked between them, as if he had flicked a switch.
Draco hurriedly dropped the cloak and took a step back before anyone else noticed. Apparently the other Slytherins had grown bored with hovering by the escape route and decided to mingle. As he moved away from Harry, Pansy snorted and raised an eyebrow at him, clearly under the impression she was interrupting something lewd.
Maggie grinned. “This is fun. It’s like team bonding. Next one: Jacqueline Cordelia’s job. Six. I don’t have a clue who that is.”
His wand woke him at 8 o’clock with its high-pitched screaming alarm he’d forgotten to turn off. Eyes fused shut with sleep, he clumsily slapped his hand over his bedside table until he found it and performed the counter charm to shut off the noise. The sunlight trickled in through the small gap in his curtains and he rolled onto his stomach and buried his face in his pillows, knowing he
Potter gazed over at the congregation, a frown tugging at the corners of his lips. “Maggie Malkin? Has she, um, seen me here?”
“Ugh,” Draco grimaced, turning away from them and back to Pansy before they noticed him staring. “What are the chances?
that it’s the pinnacle of wizarding formality. Come with me.” Draco led him over to the back corner of the shop which was a step higher than the rest of the floor where they kept their dress robes.
Harry punched him lightly in the arm. “I lived with Ron for seven years. That was plenty — he talks in his sleep. But you’re not wrong. I keep thinking maybe I’ll move, eventually.”
Draco stood next to a window with his back to Harry. He had a yard of rich emerald fabric laid out across his arm that shifted to a deep shimmering gold in the rays of sunlight. In the corner of the room, Harry recognised his robes carefully laid out on a headless mannequin that had been unceremoniously shoved into a corner.
to say ‘Oh Ginny, it doesn’t matter who the Keeper is because you’re the best Chaser in the world and the other team won’t even have a chance’.”
, he’d wallow, and if he wallowed, then he wasn’t sure if he’d ever convince himself to get out of bed again.
to do. So, I started thinking — making a list of all the things that made me happy. My friends helped, too...”
But he couldn’t do that. For once, this wasn’t about Potter, and Draco wouldn’t let him ruin Maggie’s final memories of her grandmother.
Potter reached for the tie at the front of his robe, tugging the knot loose so he could slip his hands around Draco’s waist. One held the small of his back as the other reached down and groped his arse. Draco groaned into the kiss as he squeezed, pulling their bodies tightly together.
Potter in this. He could see the swirl of the coat-like robe around his ankles as he turned to greet a friend; he could see him tugging at the bow-tie, trying to loosen it, see him fidgeting with the small embroidered details at the cuffs in a fit of boredom as he waited for the interminable speeches to end.
Draco stood. Any closeness he’d felt between the two of them had disappeared with Potter’s arrival and the revelation that Granger was now
She flapped a hand dismissively at the mention of Draco’s wellbeing. “Apparently Harry Potter was the one who brought him down. Did you see
,” she said and then giggled breathlessly. “Draco explained the whole summoning curse thing to me, so there are no hard feelings. I mean, not that there
The man sucked his teeth and jotted down a few notes. “And do you often host parties of wizards in a Muggle shop?”
They both took a long sip. In the silence, Harry could hear Kreacher banging about in the kitchen two floors below.
chicken shop? The market when we were arresting Thorne? It’s too often to be a coincidence, don’t you see?”
“Be a good host and order some pizza,” Pansy ordered, pushing him out of the doorway with her hip. The other two followed her into the workroom. They chose one of the empty sewing tables and started uncorking the wine and pulling up the spare stools.
The steam from his coffee curled around his face as he raised the cup to take a sip, the hot, wet tendrils leaving a layer of moistness on his cheeks as he stayed hunched over his mug for a long moment.
Squeezing his eyes tightly shut, he imagined someone else’s hand on him. Someone kneeling between his splayed legs, toying with him, teasing him. In his fantasy, Potter smirked at him, gripping Draco’s thigh and pushing his legs further apart, making room for him to crouch down and run his tongue along Draco’s shaft.
Harry was intimately familiar with all of Ginny’s pissed-off tones of voice and he winced. The chances of this ending up in a screaming match were high.
“The comparison just makes me adore your buttocks all the more,” Tavin said batting his eyelashes at his lover and making them all laugh.
“Yeah, I assumed they would,” Harry said with a rush of affection for the three people sitting in the compartment. They were his best friends. They always would be, no matter whom he fancied, he was sure about it.
When Kingsley Shacklebolt came to get Harry’s statement, Madame Pomfrey did not alter her restrictive regime one bit for the Headauror. Therefore Harry’s interview had to be stretched over several days. He told the Kingsley everything that had happened, from the forged letter – which had indeed gone up in flames – to Harry’s encounter with Taurus Malfoy including everything the dark wizard had told Harry about his true intentions.
“No time to explain, I’m afraid!” Harry said with a grin. Now what if Neville and half of all Gryffindor students knew about his and Draco’s morning encounters – big deal. It had always been just a matter of time until someone found out.
“Oh no, don’t worry, he’ll be gone for a while,” Daisy looked very pleased with herself, “I told Pinkie to chase him!”
The door opened and two very excited and obviously clean Shelties darted at Harry. He laughed and dropped down to the floor to cuddle them.
Harry stared at the Imagic. She was not only naked, she was drop-dead gorgeous. Her full breasts and slender waist made for a perfect hourglass figure. For a split second he contemplated the idea of being not totally gay but… maybe a tiny bit bisexual?
Harry stared at her. Did she ask him out? How was he supposed to react? He certainly did not intend to go with an eleven year old girl!
“Good Morning, Professor,” said Harry, “Snape’s… sorry, Headmaster Snape’s Imagic told us to see you?”
“So we stayed. Dinner was served but I was far too alarmed to enjoy the meal. After the last course everybody retreated to the library for firewhisky. When some greasy guy made a suggestive remark about my brother’s body, I finally had enough. I stood up and insisted on leaving. By then Tim had started to feel uncomfortable too, as he readily agreed to come with me and Lucius seemed to understand as well.
They started to walk again and Narcissa Malfoy began with her story, “Cassiopeia is the only child of Lucius’ younger brother Taurus. She was born just one week after Draco. At that time Taurus and his wife were staying with us, the Manor’s nursemaid took care of both children and as neither of them had siblings, naturally they became very close.” She sighed, “Cassiopeia was a child full of energy and strong-willed as well. When she was just a toddler, she started to refuse what was expected of her. She was already… the way she is today.” Ms Malfoy stopped again and gave Harry a significant look.
“Will you bring Teddy as well? Or do you want to ask Molly to keep an eye on him while you are at my place?”
“That is so not true!” Blaise protested and Harry found their bickering to be a nice distraction from the present situation. He felt quite overwhelmed – another missing Imagic, Draco’s changed behaviour – it was all a bit much actually. Joking seemed like a good way to let off some steam.
Harry laughed and took a sandwich which squeaked slightly when bitten. The smoking ham tasted very nice.
Basically every single student of Gryffindor except the eighth-years was present. Ginny and Cass sat next to Harry, cuddled together in one arm-chair.
“But surely you had no idea about Taurus Malfoy’s criminal intentions!” Harry protested. “He’s the villain! He’s to blame and no one else!”
“Relax, Harry, I know… it’s for your own good. I don’t want you to lie anymore. You could even offer to testify under Veritaserum – that’ll restore your credibility… which might have suffered by dating me.”
“House-elves!” Harry gasped. “Brilliant! Have I ever told you how superbly clever you are, Hermione?”
“Good morning,” Snape’s Imagic said, “We’ve heard about the latest developments, Mr Potter and wanted to see how you are coping. Ms Granger, Mr Weasley – good of you to take care of your friend.”
Harry laughed. “I’ll be happy to see for myself! But Hermione – what’s the interesting stuff you’ve found?”
“Well, he has a point. You are indeed brilliant, Hermione. Everybody knows that. Even McGonagall asked specifically for your opinion on the whole affair.” Harry said.
Draco snorted, “Friendship with females is not a concept Blaise gets, he just wants to shag each and every girl he meets… everything that moves actually.”
“The Elves had nothing to do with it – I made all of this myself!” Cass said proudly. “Aunt Mella taught me how to cook and I love it. These are Smoking Sandwiches – the ham is not just smoked but actually smoking – and Every-Flavour Muffins, but don’t worry, I always cheat, I sort out all the dubious beans before I pour them into the dough.”
Harry looked at Draco, “Right… be careful, will you? And don’t forget to send your Patronus as soon as you’re safe!”
Harry took another peek and gasped. He wanted to shout and smash the window open! Right in the middle of Aberforth’s sitting room was Draco, gagged and bound to a chair. His head had fallen to his chest, he was most likely unconscious. Aberforth was nowhere to be seen. Difficult as it was Harry dragged his eyes away from the dreadful sight and silently touched down just below the window.
“Oh, that’ll keep him busy!” Flitwick said. “One day, when you’re old, Mr Potter, remember what I tell you now – the secret of old age is not to give in.”
Harry’s heart missed a beat, then his body started moving all of its own. He took two quick steps towards Draco, grabbed his face in both hands and kissed him.
His eyes found Harry’s – and stayed there. They were warm and grey and – just very beautiful. Harry felt a flash of heat rising from his neck up to his cheeks and he silently cursed – these damn blushes had to stop!
What was she doing? Trying to support him? Harry was unable to cope any longer. “Rain check,” he groaned, scrambled to his feet and left the compartment.
Harry was strangely relieved by Snape’s rebuke. Being in love with Draco Malfoy was one thing, but being also close friends with Severus Snape was stretching it a bit too far.
“Apple tart is totally ok with me,” Josh grinned, turning his attention from Teddy to Harry, who felt slightly dazzled by the warmth of these chocolate brown eyes, “and call me Josh, please. We can stay for about an hour and a half before we must head back to the Manor. I have to be at the Ministry at four,” he explained.
“Oh, that’s good,” Harry said, “good to have friends one can turn to… thank you for everything you did for Dra – David.”
All remaining Imagics shook their heads and Headmistress Longbottom wailed, “Oh poor Amanda and Selena! What a disaster!”
Harry mastered a lopsided grin. “You might be good at torture but you’re still a bad artist. Never managed to create an Imagic, did you?”
“I’d like to add, that Auror Training is still a very solid base for anyone who might want to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts,” Flitwick said with a smile, “wouldn’t you agree, Minerva?”
Harry was stunned. He shook his head in disbelief. Not only was Narcissa Malfoy talking to him about a topic he had never expected in his wildest dreams, but the sheer craziness of pure-blood traditions was unbelievable.
A thought hit Harry. “What about your tracking spell? I know it’s not precise enough to show your whereabouts within the school, but if you leave Hogwarts altogether, they’ll know!”
After a few seconds of awkward silence Draco said, “You’re… really good at this,” he paused for a second and added, “Harry.”
Tavin sat close to his lover and every now and then he would sneak a bite from Tommy’s plate. “It’s so, so cool, to see you here, Harry,” he said beaming at Harry, “I bet you don’t miss the noise and turmoil of it all, but it’s great to have you back!”
spell Draco applied, there are several varieties… with a bit of luck you might still be able to find my son by means of Otto, as soon as the bird is fully recovered.”
“Yeah, it’s so nice to be here again,” Harry said, “though the Guest House’s common room is great and much more quiet of course, it’s good to see you all. Maybe I’ll drop by once in a while? If that’s ok with you?”
“Well, I can assure you it would not work,” McGonagall chuckled, “Lady Library wouldn’t even deliver to the Headmistress – if I were foolish enough to summon!”
Hermione chuckled. “Let’s change topic, ok? How about I wrap up, what’s to gain from the incident board, shall I?”
“Very well,” Flitwick sighed, “you shall have your clothes, if you wish. But only if the painting’s owner agrees with it. It is still part of the Malfoy collection so I shall have to get permission from Ms Malfoy and the Ministry first.”
Josh raised his hand. “– wait, just listen. I’m… I still don’t know, what exactly is going on but Kingsley told me that
“There you are!” Ron slapped Harry’s back. “We were starting to get worried. Where have you been after Kingsley’s announcement?”
“I am sure as can be, Professor,” her blues eyes widened and she looked pleadingly at the humans. “Why would I say so otherwise?”
“And what does she know about Draco’s whereabouts at the twenty-eighth? He was grounded at her house, right?”
They hugged – and it was simply wonderful. Harry exhaled deeply. No, he need not have worried. Draco was definitely not annoyed by his visit.
“That’s interesting,” said Harry, “well, Cass told me the former Ollivander collection was handed over to the Ministry… maybe their C.O.M.A. copy is at the Ministry’s library? I’ll ask McGonagall to check this. The Malfoy copy must be the one Taurus has read. I’m sure Kingsley could find out whether it’s still at the Manor.”
Sylvia Silver shook her head. “No, he does not look familiar at all.” She paused, “Well, the only other man who looks slightly familiar, is the one to his left. But I assume it is just because there is some likeness between him and the handsome young man.”
“So that’s why she’s so good at martial arts!” Harry said. “The witchards of the far east are all supposed to be brilliant fighters.”
And Harry did. He sat down at her side and soon found himself wrapped in a warm hug. Molly’s soft body felt comfortably familiar, just like her scent of rose-water with a hint of cinnamon.
“Yes, he’s missing. And that is exactly what I wanted to talk about, Harry,” said McGonagall with much concern.
As they were now free for the rest of the afternoon, most students were in a hurry to leave. Harry cleared his desk and tried to focus on the next task at hand. He looked at his watch– still one hour until swim training would start, that should do.
“The pavilion!” cried Cass. “Of course! That’s where all the filial cups and sticks are kept! We've collected about seven hundred items over the centuries and keep them in the pavilion's large display cabinet! It’s part of the Malfoys’ arts collection, the largest assemblage of filial items in Britain,” she explained.
Snape continued, “I know it might seem unlikely and you will most probably not be aware of any such memory, but maybe if you give it some thought and we are lucky, something comes to your mind… at any rate, here’s what we know. The day of my death–“ he cleared his voice, “– the day of the Battle of Hogwarts, Headmaster Dumbledore’s portrait was here in this room with all the other portraits, except mine of course.”
He watched the hands of the clock above the entrance door. The training was supposed to begin in twenty minutes. Laddley was a creature of habit and always came timely before the lesson started to prepare training equipment, check the water’s temperature and cleanness. He must appear any minute now.
When Harry approached the common room he found the door slightly ajar and heard voices coming from the room. He stopped in his tracks – obviously some other student was up already as well. Maybe Draco had left the door open to give him notice? He stepped closer, yes, that was Blaise Zabini’s voice… Harry was still undecided whether to enter or to walk away, when suddenly he heard his own name.
“Having you with me, that’ll feel like having a backup! To be honest, I don’t like the idea of being alone with her, I mean, she will be accompanied by an Auror anyway, but it’s different to have someone I trust at my side.”
“Joshua Jordan, I’m Ms Malfoy’s probation officer,” the young man introduced himself and beamed at Harry, “I’m very pleased to meet you, Harry… sorry, Mr Potter.”
“What’s this? You’re losing consciousness like a damsel in distress? You haven’t got much endurance, have you, Potter?”
“So, what’s a sisters cup then?” he asked, “is it just a memento or does it have some specific use?”
“You were brilliant, Ms Malfoy,” Harry said feeling truly dumbfounded by what he had observed and immensely relieved as well. “Thank you so much!”
“What a pity,” the Imagic sighed, “I had such high hopes for your friendship. I really do believe that you have very much in common and could complement each other perfectly.”
“Let me think about it, ok? I need to swim some more laps, ‘cause I’m beginning to feel really cold… but I’ll come up with a plan. You’re not alone in this, Tommy, I’ll be right with you, ok?”
After a moment of stunned silence Flitwick cleared his voice. “Well, at least that makes sense. If indeed such a painting exists, it might well be part of the Malfoy collection. They are supposed to own paintings with some truly unique magic and hardly ever show them to the public.”
Feeling more confident by any minute he had not been attacked, Harry lifted his cloak, put his wand in the pocket of his jeans and reached down to touch Draco. He started to pick at the gag and managed to loosen it, when several things happened within an instant.
“ – exactly Mr Potter, the very one.” Flitwick nodded. “Apparently they are preparing a case to clear Taurus Malfoy and to remove his name from the Wanted-List. And if they get away with their claim, his chances of legal succession would be intact again.”
“Good afternoon, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said and Harry could not help but feel a little bit disappointed for being called by his surname again.
Ron shook his head in mock despair, before he started to grin. “Count yourself lucky, that Hermione explained it all to me yesterday evening, otherwise you could watch your best friend having a major heart-attack right now. Well, if you must… you are fully prepared for the worst, I hope? If this goes horribly wrong, at least I get to say
“Of course she will! It only happens about once in a century that the library gives one of the patrons total access!”
“That’s enough, Kreacher,” Harry interrupted. “Thank you!” Then he addressed the other House-elves. “And thank you so much for coming! I completely understand you have no obligation to talk to me.” He was well aware that they were bound to the school and not to him, like Kreacher was.
The headmistress went on, “Kingsley says this is not unusual because the Probation Tracking Spell is less than perfect. Nobody talks about it, because they don’t want delinquents to know. I told him in no uncertain terms that this is highly unprofessional of course! The Ministry must fund research for a proper spell as reliable as the Under Age Magic Tracker, which was developed at Hogwarts and works perfectly as we all know.”
Harry extinguished the fire and they rose to leave. They walked along the quiet corridor up to Ron’s door.
“Creating an Imagic is considered the highest form of Magical Arts, only very few artists are capable of it. It’s a required skill for the position of Charms Master of Hogwarts of course, as it is his or her duty to create an Imagic of the Headmaster or Headmistress for the famous portrait collection of Hogwarts.” Cass paused and added, “I’d very much love to see those paintings by the way…”
“Well that’s reassuring…” Harry murmured, “if that’s all for now, I’d rather… you’know?” He gestured vaguely at the hidden door.
“Oh,” said McGonagall, “right, we all got a bit carried away I’m afraid… maybe you want to continue now, Harry?” She seemed slightly embarrassed by the less then disciplined course the meeting had taken.
Harry nodded, he had expected as much. “But that’s not all, right? You’re upset about something – what is it?”
Which made Harry chuckle and soon enough they were grinning at each other like madmen. This was embarrassing and fantastic at the very same time. Harry ruffled his hair and managed to say, “Well, you wanna come in for a second? Or shall we just go to the hall early?”
“Don’t be daft, Ron,” Hermione said with a nervous glance towards Harry, “why shouldn’t we call him by his given name? He’s practically a friend of ours this year!”
“Calm down, ‘Mione,” Ron said patting his girlfriend’s arm. “Don’t you think magic always has a twist of anarchy? Messing with nature’s laws and such? And as long as nobody gets hurt this is just fine with me. Without bending the rules a little bit here and there, no new magic ever would have been invented – and none of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products either.”
First of all he used the silencing charm once more, this time on his clothes and boots to prevent any noise from moving. It was dark all around, the only bright light came from a crack below the door to the room, where Draco was held hostage.
Narcissa Malfoy nodded and her face became all soft. Harry had never seen her that vulnerable before. He was reminded of Draco’s early morning face, the resemblance between mother and son was more obvious than ever.
Harry listened with interest although he had no idea, how this information might be useful for the investigation.
“Well, you heard the Headmistress, she had outstanding grades in every single D.A.D.A. exam… Merlin, I had no idea about that… mind you, we’ve had a subscription of
“Lucius was there, but neither his parents nor his brother. He excused their absence with urgent family business but it seemed odd. The first of many signs, that this invitation was not what it was supposed to be. Lucius was in exceedingly good spirits, he joked and laughed while showing us around. And he was especially nice to Tim, complimented him on his looks, asked him lots of questions about Muggle Arts – and Tim was simply enraptured. For the first time it dawned on me, that Lucius might be homosexual. His sexual desires had never concerned me before, nobody talked about it at school, at least not in front of me. I had been totally ignorant, but now I was alarmed.
“Pinkie!” Daisy shouted with a surprisingly loud voice, “Attack!” – and she pointed at Taurus Malfoy.
Tommy blushed. “Yeah, says he got some vibes… he has this weird idea, that you and… but it’s nonsense of course. Forget I said that.”
His dad had laughed and said, “Narcissa, you’re speaking to a future England seeker. Appearance fees for birthday parties are at least ten Galleons.”
“Hey.” Pansy leaned forward and clicked her fingers in front of his face. “Don’t start fantasising in front of us, that’s gross.”
Draco waited by his chair as Maggie walked up to the grave, which had been magically filled with dirt, and lay a lily on top of the fresh soil. She was wiping a tear from her cheek as she returned to Draco’s side.
, but even odder was the ease at which he took to being a bartender. After spending six and a half years observing him struggle in every single Hogwarts class and get through OWLs by the skin of his teeth, Draco had always imagined Greg depending on Draco’s family connections to find low-level jobs at the Ministry.
“Oh.” Potter turned back to the robes but his gaze kept flickering back to Draco and he eventually shrugged. “I don’t really know, I don’t care about this kind of thing. Aren’t you a tailor? Can’t you” — he waved his hands helplessly in the air — “
He was just taking a large gulp of wine (it was the good stuff, clearly Pansy had raided her parents’ wine cellar) when Pansy called uncertainly, “Um, Draco? I don’t think it’s Theo.”
“I’ll see you at Sunday lunch,” he said to the others and, with a wave, stepped back into the fireplace.
He stood and pulled Harry against him, his arms wrapping around his shoulders as they kissed. His legs were weak, and it was only Harry’s hand on the small of his back that kept him upright.
And yet even amongst his gorgeous friends, Draco knew he stood out. Maggie had spent all week helping him tailor his outfit. It was technically a set of his father’s old robes that he’d bought and never worn that Draco had found at the back of his wardrobe, still in its bag. The cloak was navy blue and fell to his mid-calf. He’d added gold filigree growing like vines from the bottom hem and cuffs. He’d resisted Maggie’s plea for him to wear skintight leather trousers and had instead gone for a matching blue slim-fit trousers — high-waisted so his legs appeared to go for miles. Draco had left the musketeer-style shirt mostly unlaced, the deep V of the neckline plunging to show off his chest. When he’d met the others at Pansy’s, Blaise had looked right at his exposed skin and smirked.
“But Draco, you managed to fix that wedding dress last year even though the skirt was half gone,” she pointed out.
Draco waved away the concern. “I’m fine. Something went down the wrong way. Which way is the bathroom?”
“Well, I was going to have a quick word, Potter, but I can wait until our meeting on Friday if you’d rather.”
Harry wanted to scream, but he bit his tongue. When he had control enough over his temper to be sure he wouldn’t throw punches, he spoke. His voice was icy with rage.
“I’m getting more sleep,” Harry said with a shrug. It was strictly true: Kingsley didn’t need to know that the sleep never happened for more than three hours at a time, so he stole it in many small increments throughout the day.
Above his head, he heard several pairs of feet lumbering down the stairs to the kitchen. A moment later, Ron and Hermione arrived, followed by a half-asleep Neville.
He pulled the cubicle curtain shut behind him and toed his shoes off, quickly shrugging out of his robes and kicking them into a corner until he stood just in his underwear and socks. Uncertainly, he reached for the dress robes and quickly realised he was out of his depth.
They collided once more with a desperate fervour. Malfoy wrapped a hand around the back of Harry’s neck, his fingers digging into his skin as their lips parted. Their tongues met and the wet warmth spread from his mouth down Harry’s entire body. He nipped lightly at Malfoy’s lower lip, appreciating its soft fullness even more when he moaned in Harry’s mouth.
He sent the robes over to an empty desk with a swish of his wand along with a self-stitching needle and thread and walked to the shopfloor, curious. He tried to school his expression into something polite before he got there. Maggie had told him his face while dealing with customers looked like someone realising they’d trodden in dog shit.
He watched the bravado slide from Malfoy’s face as Harry stared intently. His brow smoothed out and his eyes widened, flicking down to Harry’s mouth and then staying there. Harry licked his lips.
He’d been quite proud of the annotated design last night, but in the fresh light of day, they were clearly wrong. They were nice robes but they weren’t right for Potter: they’d wear him, rather than the other way around. Draco could easily imagine how he would spend the whole night fidgeting and escaping self-consciously at the first possible moment.
the annoying pests, knowing he’d get a lecture about their importance in the ecosystem or something, so he quietly did as he was bid. After wheeling the mountain of lumpy, writhing bags to the porch, he rejoined the others inside for a quick shower and a glass of Pimm’s in the sun.
“Uhh…” Harry racked his brains, trying to remember if he should know there were plans after work. He ran through all the usual occasions for a post-work pub trip (birthday, leaving party, new recruit, end of a case) but came up blank so he asked, “What’s tonight?”
Draco gritted his teeth and shrugged minutely, keeping his expression blank while internally he raged.
The baby made an unhappy noise, and she stopped talking for a moment as she rearranged the child so it was lying in her arms. Its head turned towards Draco and it peered at him curiously. He tried not to look unnerved and redirected his gaze to Granger, who was flipping through a book on the couch cushion next to her.
“Hey, Belinda,” he shouted. When the Auror stuck her head round the door, he asked, “Could you throw me the file for this raid?”
“What the fuck?” Draco muttered, the apprehension draining from him like water down the drain. He dropped his wand and stalked to the door, yanking it open as Potter raised his fist to knock again. “What the fuck?” Draco repeated, louder.
Potter winced, and Draco watched him take stock of the shop with fresh eyes. “Can I help?” he asked, gesturing towards the broom Millie had found.
Harry moaned around his dick, the vibrations making Draco’s toes curl against the cold marble tiles.
“Should we…” Harry trailed off and took a deep breath, steeling himself. “Talk about this?” He gestured between them, as if Draco might somehow get the wrong end of the stick — as if there was anything else the two of them needed to talk about.
“Thank you,” Harry said, shifting on the uncomfortable chair as Robards meandered his way over to the point.
“Would you like to try on your robes quickly, Mr. Potter? Just to make sure there’s no final alterations we need to make?” she asked.
But Draco wasn’t done. He then handed him a waistcoat and watched with raised brows as Harry struggled with the buttons. After that came a jacket, and then a floor-length cape.
to give you tips on how to seduce Draco Malfoy. Can you see how it’s a bit of a weird position to put me in?”
She jumped as the bread glanced off her ankle and glared up at him. “What time do you call this?” she demanded.
“Merlin, Harry!” Ginny eventually cried. “I’ve got try-outs tonight! I’ve only mentioned it a hundred times!”
He scrawled a letter to Ron and Hermione, letting them know he was back from St. Mungo’s curse-free and thanking them for their help.
so right. Harry couldn’t understand where the doubt was coming from so he ignored it completely. “You need a reason to
Draco finally caught sight of Potter speaking to the harsh woman with the low ponytail. He nodded seriously as she talked to him, but Draco could tell his attention was wandering. His eyes darted towards the line of Slytherins, and their eyes met for a moment. Draco imbued his stare with as much hatred as possible; Potter’s cheeks darkened, and he looked away.
But he was also different to the stuck-up prig from school, a treacherous part of his brain pointed out. He was kind, apparently, and charitable, and the arrogant rudeness was, more often than not, bitingly funny if you didn’t let it offend you. The new Draco Malfoy drank bad red wine in fad Muggle bars and got greasy chicken takeaways and answered the door to strangers in the middle of the night in come-stained thigh-length satin dressing gowns…
“Morning,” Harry grunted as he filled a glass with water and gulped it down, panting as he wiped away a few stray drops from the corner of his lips.
The bell tinkled in the wizarding side of the shop, announcing a customer. They both glanced up, Maggie’s surprised eyes magnified threefold by the glasses.
He stormed to the front of the shop and checked that, yep, Maggie had definitely flicked the sign to
The windows had been repaired, and the racks of Muggle clothes were stocked once again. He peered through the window and couldn’t see anyone in the Muggle front, so he ducked around to the hidden side door. The bell tinkled cheerfully above his head when he pulled it open.
“Yeah, sure,” she said and returned a moment later with one of the red-bound files that the Auror Department used for ongoing cases.
Around them, the dream’s scenery melted away like candle wax. Grass sprouted between the Entrance Hall’s flagstones and the walls crumbled, revealing the Great Lake. It was still sunny but warmer now, and Harry and Draco unfastened their fur-lined capes and spread them on the ground like picnic blankets. Draco reclined on the ground, his long legs stretching into the grass. Harry remained standing, blinking at the new surroundings.
“No,” Harry interrupted, “this isn’t me throwing my toys out of the pram because I didn’t get what I wanted. What we did was
have been that easy. She didn’t know what it was like, living under so many expectations with so many pairs of eyes on her. Not the same way that Harry knew.
The silk sheets twisted around his body as he fidgeted, impatient for sleep to come, and he forced himself to lie still.
She still didn’t answer, but when he hailed a taxi, she slid into the passenger seat, folding her arms and glaring out the window until they arrived at Grimmauld Place. Ginny put the bag of books on the kitchen table, twisting the bag handles in her fingers as she hovered.
The hippogriff had been an unexpected sign-off to his final shift before his rest days — turning what was meant to be a small bust of an illegal imported pixie ring into six hours of overtime as Harry had to fill out form after form about why their risk assessment hadn’t considered that the pixie dealers might have imprisoned a hippogriff in their broom cupboard. He needed to remember to write Hagrid a thank-you card for introducing thirteen-year-olds to incredibly dangerous animals; otherwise Harry would have come out of that encounter with a lot more than just shredded robes.
“You should at least report it. There’s an anonymous tip system for Aurors, you know — people using magic in front of Muggles is the kind of thing we could investigate.”
. That’s more something Hermione would do,” Harry said. “I’m more selfish than that. I just… I didn’t realise how much I hated it until I woke up the morning after I quit and realised I didn’t have to go back ever again. I imagined that life when I was seventeen and for the last decade I’ve tried to make it a reality, but I was
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Those would be more helpful if they didn’t all say completely contradictory things. Then there’s Ron, just telling me to
and he’d hated it. After all, what actually mattered was that he was happy during the day and he was, so he must be doing something right.
restaurant. No one had thought he would last more than a week, but (maybe because he and Vince had taken Muggle studies as a doss subject) he’d worked there for three months before becoming a bartender at the same place. Since then, he’d jumped from bar to bar — he explained he was working his way up from what the Muggles called
“Just… How are you?” Harry asked. He was aware of exactly how lame the words were as they came out, but it was too late to think of a better question.
She frowned at him for a long moment, squinting at his face with an expression of bemusement. “Who are you?” she snapped.
Below, the Manor’s grounds spread out like a map. His mother’s gardens were almost unrecognisable: weeds had completely taken over the once-manicured flower beds and the lawns were waist-height, undulating beneath him like the sea. The paving stones that led from the Manor to the lower lawns were barely visible amongst the tall grass. Occasionally Draco caught glimpses of grey between the green, and he followed them like a connect-the-dots game down from the back door, past the pond which had been taken over by territorial geese that honked menacingly whenever he got within fifty feet, to the small fenced cemetery at the tree line.
She blinked at him like he was a few brain cells short of sentient life. “The funeral? When you didn’t show up to our
He remained there, bent over the parchment for the next two weeks, his backache increasing along with the pile of crumpled, rejected sketches on the floor beside him.
It took him another hour to fall asleep. He switched from his old records to the radio and listened to a dull interview with a woman who was opening an exhibition of enchanted sculptures in Warwick. He forced himself to listen to every word as the sculptor explained the influential witches who had inspired each of the statues, half of whom he’d never heard of and didn’t care to learn about but they helped to keep his mind off Potter for long enough to drift into an uneasy sleep.
“Maybe she wants to retire. Spend her golden years in a paisley bikini in the French Riviera,” he joked.
Robards stood abruptly and punched a stack of papers on his desk, cutting Harry’s tirade off. He looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him.
A surge of jealousy swept over Harry. So that’s where Draco’s sexual experience came from! He must know some gay Muggles, most probably intimately.
“Well, if you intend to become an Auror, you’ll get used to the idea that appearances can be misleading,” Josh smiled.
Indeed, there was a girl with a book in her lap sitting at the foot of one huge tree. She looked about ten years old, wore a white dress with lots of lace and ribbons - and seemed very impressed by Draco’s introduction.
Therefore most of Malfoy’s usual crowd would be gone, and being on probation would not increase his popularity either. If his cousin was hanging out with ‘Potter’s gang’, as Harry was well aware his circle of friends was labelled, Draco was prone to be rather lonely this year. Harry realized this thought didn’t please him half as much as he would have expected.
“Yes, that’s what Flitwick said,” Harry nodded, “Taurus Malfoy tried to hide Ariana’s cup in plain sight, hoping the thing would blend in with hundreds of similar pieces there. So – you want to help searching?”
Harry knew exactly how to proceed when he woke up. He stretched – a good night’s rest really did work wonders. It had been surprisingly easy to fall asleep last evening, in spite of having no idea what to do about Draco. And now it was crystal clear. He got up and looked out of the window. The lawn around the castle was covered in frost – he better put on warm clothes for what he intended to do.
rescued him. Because it was their heritage of witchcraft and wizardry, that finally led Harry from the Dursleys to Hogwarts– even for the price of having to fight Voldemort.
To Harry’s utter amazement McGonagall suddenly started to smile until she was all smiles and looked truly and totally delighted.
“Alright, abandon me,” complained Ginny at the breakfast table on Sunday morning, “my very own brother, my flesh and blood… “, and she sighed in mock despair.
“I’m sure, they only did it for your pleasure, Finnigan,” snapped Draco and Harry totally agreed with him. He certainly did not approve of Seamus lusting after Ginny or Cass.
He opened the door – and froze. Obviously Harry was not the first student awake. Draco Malfoy, fully dressed already, was sitting on a sofa in front of one large bay window. Legs stretched along the sofa he was sipping from a cup of tea and reading this book with the black cover again.
The kitchen smelled nice and the sun streamed through the slightly smeary window above the sink… it could be quite peaceful here, Harry thought, as long as one pushed aside any thoughts about Tonks, Remus and Andromeda’s late husband Ted, all of them murdered during that insane war.
And that’s what we did yesterday evening. He produced the potion – must have kept a bottle at the ready – and I put the tracker on myself. As soon as Slughorn changed into my physiognomy –“
Laddley shook his head. “No they weren’t. Mum only managed to bring Tim to St. Mungo’s after dad’s suicide, more than four weeks later. The Healers agreed that Tim had been molested and cursed, but there wasn’t enough evidence to prove anything. Tim didn’t say a coherent sentence, hasn’t talked much up until today, at least nothing that makes sense. But even if he had – a Muggle’s testimony at the Wizengamot of those times? Accusing the member of an influential pure-blood family? Forget it! Damn it, my testimony wasn’t enough and I was a wizard! Nobody wanted to cross the fucking Malfoys!
Sylvia Silver furrowed her brow for a few seconds, then she nodded, “Yes, I can see them both. The strange artist – that’s the man in the second row, middle column.” She had identified Taurus Malfoy.
“No! I found nothing on that stupid board! Nothing of interest at all – which was so very frustrating! So I had to go to the library of course.”
Harry stared at Draco. He had never seen Draco so… exposed. As if all the hidden feelings, the carefully protected weaknesses were suddenly on surface. As if he had stepped out of a suit of armour, naked.
Harry sighed. Right. He needed to set himself a limit. He would wait for another three minutes and then – he would ring the bell. Harry stepped away from the door and checked once more that his broom was well hidden in the branches of the pine tree, when he heard dogs barking.
Before Harry had even a chance to respond, Draco said with a sneer, “Now that you have come to his rescue, Professor, I’m sure ‘
“But Mr Weasley still has a point,” Madame Pomfrey said, approaching Harry’s bed again. “Time’s up!”
and switch the colour of Mr Malfoy’s shirt to whatever you like,” Flitwick explained. “Because it’s easiest to start with a white object, we will use this item of fabric. I think Ms Granger has earned herself the first go– please join us at the front.”
“And madwomen!” chimed in two former Headmistresses who had obviously been part of the rescue mission.
“Yes, you do!” Hermione insisted, turning to Josh she added, “He also can’t get his Patronus to talk!”
Harry shared about Otto’s training, but had the distinct impression Narcissa Malfoy did not hear a single word he was saying. They stepped into the aviary and Harry was glad to see, that his owl was still well received by the other birds and seemed to enjoy the visit immensely.
“It’s so great to have you in our house, Cass – I hope we’ll be roommates too!” Ginny spontaneously threw one arm around Cass' shoulder, who seemed to freeze for a moment before she relaxed and smiled at Ginny.
Professor Flitwick cleared his voice. “Very well, Ms Silver, let us get back to what this unknown artist did – please carry on.”
He was terribly worried about Draco’s safety of course. Was it a good thing that Draco had gone into hiding? Maybe he was even safer in the Muggle world? But what if his malicious uncle found him at his refuge – Draco would be all alone, left to defend himself without anyone’s support! The thought alone made Harry feel sick.
“Seriously,” Harry said with careful consideration, “no, I’m not attracted to Josh Jordan, neither am I looking forward to leaving Hogwarts,” silently adding to himself,
“That’s not what I meant,” Harry said. “But I think Narcissa should know. First of all she’s still married to that bastard. As far as I know, she doesn’t want to be disloyal to her husband, now that he’s imprisoned. But she might reconsider, if she knew. And I’m pretty sure she will want to help your brother financially, Mr Laddley, if the Ministry permits it. Don’t you think that’s worth a try?”
“He didn’t leave me,” Harry protested instantly, “he just had to go into hiding– “ He stopped talking, afraid of giving too much away.
They walked towards their table side by side when she added, “I’m sorry, Harry. Please don’t hold it against me that I – you know…“
Their other friends were all surprisingly supportive as well. Harry was astounded how much respect and even friendship Draco had gained in just a few weeks. Hermione spent most of her spare time at the library, searching for information about Magical Arts and just about anything that might be helpful. Soon enough she had the same slightly crazy, overstrained look he knew from previous years before exams started.
Harry thought, Sylvia Silver’s Imagic was meant to see ‘Draco’ in case she should talk after all. Luckily enough neither Taurus Malfoy nor his accomplice had been aware of the House-elves observant demeanour. Harry wanted to smack himself for being nearly as ignorant as them. Why the fuck had it taken him so long to interview the room-service elves?
“Because they have no idea what has happened to them. They have no desire to leave, none of them has ever even tried. The hex makes them feel perfectly comfortable where they are. You could say they are a bit drugged,” Narcissa Malfoy said. “Which is all for the better, because they will not try to warn off Aunt Walburga, but instead try to convince her it’s a good idea to join them.”
“Yeah, I know, we were here right after the battle, me, Ron and Hermione. I wanted to talk to Dumbledore – to his Imagic I mean, wanted to ask for his opinion,” said Harry.
“May I remind you that you passed your Potions O.W.L. with ‘Exceeds Expectations’? The same grade you got for most of the other subjects except Transfiguration, which you passed with ‘Outstanding’?” Draco said raising his eyebrows.
“Of course, he’s innocent! I swear! Whatever you think he might have done – you must be wrong! I know he was ever so careful not to break any rules since his trial! Draco would never ever risk his probation!” Cass was desperate and turned towards Harry for help. “Harry, tell them! They won’t believe me, but they will trust you!”
He cleared his voice, “Ok. I want all prefects, seventh- and eighth-year students at my side immediately. The rest of you – please sort into house groups! Can you do that? Thank you!”
“You are quite lucky, you know,” Cass smiled at him and Harry mused again how very much alike she was to her cousin, “to be accepted no matter what. It’s not something to be taken for granted.”
As usual Harry’s place was next to Neville and right behind Draco. He looked at the back of Draco’s head and was unable to move.
“No, I’m afraid not…,” Harry said and Draco’s face fell, “but I did not expect such intense security measures! I thought it would be much easier to stay in contact!”
“– and nobody seemed to be able to get rid of her, even the Auror department failed,” Harry stared back at Kingsley. “Well, Ms Malfoy offered to clear the painting for me and I let her. She wanted to do me a favour, because she was grateful for my testimony at the trials… anyway, she came to my house under Auror Jordan’s surveillance and brought that hexed painting along... it shows a feast, a banquet. Then she persuaded that Black woman to switch painting and took the hexed one back to the Manor. And it’s just such a relief to have that screaming wench out of the way!”
Draco nodded. “Alright. I promise.” He flushed and opened his mouth as if he wanted to add something, but kept quiet.
“I’m not sure his name’s actually Bob,” putting her hands on her hips Ginny eyed the pompous owl curiously, “he looks more like a Reginald to me. Well, are you going to fetch that letter or not?”
“Hi Cass, come in – both of you – take a seat,” Harry said, “This is Ginny, Hermione and Ron.” His friends nodded their greetings.
Blaise stood behind Harry’s chair at the corner of the card table. “Forget that boring Muggle game, Harry, nobody in his right mind uses Roman numbers nowadays,” he said, “how about a game of wizard chess instead?”
Harry thought, removing the letter. Hedwig had nuzzled his ear and hair whenever near enough, but this one turned his head as far away as possible from Harry.
“I can well imagine, he did,” Harry grinned, “he’s such fun to have around, I really appreciate your mother’s present –,“ when he saw Draco’s satisfied grin, he suddenly realized, where Narcissa Malfoy might have gotten the inspiration for this very special gift.
“Over here, Potter,” Draco Malfoy said with a frown pointing at the place mat with Harry’s name on in – right opposite of his own. Harry realized with a sinking feeling, he was meant to sit facing Malfoy. Oh, what fun that would be.
“Alright, you two,” Ron sounded exhausted, “you’ve been repeating yourselves over and over again for days – can you just hold it for now? I’m bored!”
“Oh! I see,” the bearded man smiled. “You’re talking about David? I’m not sure he’s expecting a visitor – but I’ll ask him. What’s your name again, lad?”
“It’s a shame that Auror Jordan has to leave Hogwarts,” said Harry, “and I’m certain all the other students will feel the same. He’s an excellent teacher, you know.”
Harry cleared his voice, “Sure… I mean… hmm…“ He was lost for words. How could he tell Ginny of all people, that the sight of Draco Malfoy dancing messed with his head in a most frightening way? Was Ginny feeling the same? If his ex-girlfriend and Harry himself were capable of admiring the same guy –not to mention that the guy in question was Draco fucking Malfoy!– life was full of weird surprises indeed.
The obvious thing to do was to ask Ariana’s Imagic about it, as Imagics were supposed to keep track of all the portraits they could switch into. So of course Harry had asked her as soon as he learned that the cup was lost. But Ariana just smiled and kept quiet. Even Aberforth did not know how to make her talk.
“Otto’s just lovely, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said, “he’s still at owl school of course but his teachers are very happy about the progress he’s making.”
The House-elf fell down on his knees wailing. “Master is too kind! Master is the kindest! Kreacher does not deserve to serve Master Harry Potter Sir!”
Harry’s pulse was still racing and he did not fully trust his own judgement. The picture of Draco tied to that chair was too dreadful – how was he supposed to consider his options wisely, with a cool head, when his boyfriend was up there, bound and gagged? Maybe he needed to call for backup after all, although his every nerve wanted to act immediately? He wanted to groan in frustration – but bit his tongue to keep quiet until he tasted blood. He was up shit-creek.
“That’s not what I meant,” Harry interrupted ignoring Hermione’s glee about that information, “I wanted to ask you about the painting that was above his bed for a while, the naked lady, you know?”
The girls smiled fondly at each other before Daisy continued, “Ariana and I have so much in common. We both like to hike, to climb trees and we even share the same taste in books – so we have a lot to talk about!”
“May I introduce to you the perfect costume for every Halloween party world-wide: dress up as Superhero Harry Potter!” Draco said mock seriously. “Extra bonus in your case: minimum effort required.”
“I’ve always had a soft spot for babies… and this one is so very special, aren’t you, Teddy-bear? Such a clever Metamorphmagus you are,” Josh crooned and cuddled Teddy.
“But that’s just my point! Harry has no clue how to train an owl and neither do we!” Ron said. “It’s a lot of work, training a reliable post owl, everybody knows that.” Otto seemed to agree with that and hooted enthusiastically.
“When you told me to be careful around Laddley, you refused to tell me what exactly I had to watch out for,” Harry said. “Well, as it happens I might have found out by my own. He’s… very intolerant? About diversity issues? Is that it?”
“So you were right, Harry,” Hermione said eagerly, “this one is actually the Malfoys’ copy! Taurus must have studied C.O.M.A. in secret, because he wanted to present any findings as his very own inventions. And he could not examine the book at the Manor, considering the mess he was making by opening it the wrong way. Hence he went to the empty house at
Two minutes later Harry stepped back into the great hall. Although the music had started to play again, very few students were in the mood for dancing, everybody was still talking excitedly. While searching for his friends Harry picked up some very strange rumours.
“He might well be a poor chap, but he sure is a mean creep as well,” Harry said and retold Tommy’s story.
“Yeah, you told us Josh Jordan was there,” Ginny said thoughtfully, “but you certainly didn’t tell us he was going to be one of the teachers… come to think of it, you were rather vague about that meeting…”
“What if Harry asked Flitwick on your behalf?” Ron suggested. “He can pretend you don’t even know about his request and if Flitwick declines, you don’t need to feel embarrassed.”
Josh laughed, “Oh, I’m used to far worse, I assure you! Sharing meals with Aurors takes a good stomach, as we talk about our cases while eating. But that book of yours sounds like a nasty piece of parchment indeed.”
“Well, I don’t know much about Greg’s professional life,” Aberforth looked strangely touched, “went to school with his Mum and have been friends with her until she passed away last spring… he’s a good guy, Greg… his life hasn’t been easy for a long time...”
The first days of school after Draco’s disappearance Harry felt slightly numb. Time passed in slow-motion, his lessons seemed boring and pointless. He asked the Headmistress for permission to skip classes and investigate full time, but she flat out refused.
“No,” cried Ginny, “I mean, I’d love to dance with Cassy, but I don’t want to push myself between you – actually, I want to see you two dancing together, Hermione has marvelled about your elegance … maybe both of you could dance with me just once in a while?”
The compartment door opened for a moment and Cass stepped out. She bit her lower lip in the exact same way Draco did, when he was upset or confused, Harry realised.
“Stop it! That’s just… just crazy in so many ways!” Harry pleaded. “Where would you hide anyway? You aren’t even familiar with the Muggle world!”
If this wasn’t about Harry’s sexual orientation, then he had no clue what had gone wrong. Maybe Draco was just a moody bastard – certainly that would have been his conclusion in previous years. But he had been sure, that Draco was more than that, a better person than the arrogant brat who had been a pain in the ass for seven years.
The only person who was even more devastated than Harry was Cass. She was paler than usual and her puffy eyes were a clear sign that she must be crying a lot. Harry tried to talk to her whenever he could, not just for her sake but because he felt closer to Draco when Cass was around. Just looking at her comforted him. Right after the ball she had been angry at Harry, believing him to be indifferent. But Harry convinced her that he did care very much indeed and would go to great length to clear Draco’s name. Ginny’s insistence that Harry was trustworthy had helped too, so Cass came around to have faith in him again.
Christmas with Draco – how would that be like? Harry was expected to spend the holidays at the Burrow, but Draco would probably want to stay with his mother at the Manor. Would they still be able to spend some time together? Harry heaved a sigh. He was getting ahead of time. First of all, he had to make sure that Draco returned safely to Hogwarts.
Harry moaned. What was he supposed to do now? His stomach rumbled. It was probably dinner time already. Should he walk over to the great hall, sit at his usual place and pretend nothing unusual had happened? What would his friends have to say about it? And most importantly – would Draco show up for dinner or rather skip another meal? Harry sighed – once again he had to find out by carrying on. He got up and left the class-room.
“Actually I thought someone was making fun of me,” Draco continued. “So I took the thing down and shoved it into the closet, just to get rid of it. And I swear, at that time there was just one human Imagic in the painting, just that naked lady and a poodle!”
“Oh that’s Teddy waking up, I guess,” he murmured and hurried from the room. “I’ll take care of him, you finish your lunch.”
Harry sighed. He was not at all interested in whatever bizarre reason Laddley had for getting involved in Taurus Malfoy’s wicked schemes. Laddley hated Lucius Malfoy, probably had been promised some money as well. Whatever.
Cass pulled away from her aunt. She snuffled and said, “Hi, Harry… I guess I’ve got to go now.” She nodded at Josh and stood up.
Kingsley Shacklebolt did not seem too eager about their coming along but at least he did not contradict McGonagall.
“As so many times before you make absolutely no sense, Potter.” Draco shook his head. “You attend a dance party but claim never to dance? What a pity… for your countless admirers I mean. Who, it seems, lately include even a famous deceased Headmaster of Slytherin origins…”
“Don’t be daft, he’s not flirting with me,” said Hermione beaming at Ron, which gave Harry the impression she rather enjoyed Ron’s display of jealousy.
“The damn thing didn’t work properly from the very beginning. Again and again Draco was having fits of nausea. Usually people get used to the tracker within a few days, his mother for example had no trouble at all to adjust. But not Draco. Of course I reported that back as soon as I was aware of the problem. I even helped Draco file a complaint after a few weeks when nothing changed. I have no idea how he managed while he was in Edinburgh, but when I saw him still suffering from side-effects here at Hogwarts, being sometimes hardly able to eat, and no one from the head-quarter seemed to bother, I removed the damn thing.” Josh sighed. “Of course the ministry found out now… because we can’t locate him.”
?” Ron said. “Well, as my lovely girlfriend says, now’s the time to leave all that behind and start acting like your average stupid young bloke – have fun, get pissed and get laid.”
we say. But I fear we rarely act accordingly.” She gave him a final nod and started to walk back towards the Manor.
“At least for this school year,” O’Malley nodded, “we’ll see how that works… I just wanted to say hello to you before McGonagall is going to introduce me at lunch-time… thought you might want to know in advance.”
“No, no – not to worry!” Flitwick said, “Quite the contrary, they are helping to solve some… some mystery. I’m very glad you are here, Molly, and you as well Arthur, very glad indeed.”
“But surely not Draco! This is ridiculous, he wasn’t even in London at that time but in Edinburgh with Cass and her Aunt Mella – isn’t she a friend of yours? Draco was grounded and under a Tracking Spell trailing his every move for the whole summer – it’s impossible.”
?” Draco asked innocently, making everybody laugh as they all knew, this was Harry’s favourite pudding.
When Harry and Ron gave their report of this morning’s visit at the village, their audience seemed unimpressed. Hermione of course already knew what had happened, but the members of staff did not look convinced at all, although Harry insisted on the importance of a previous conflict between Lucius Malfoy and Gregory Laddley.
“But what if… somebody else pretended to be Draco? Gave a false identity at the Archive’s registry? They could even have used Polyjuice Potion!” Harry argued. “How do they check visitors’ identities anyway? At Gringotts any wizard or witch has to present their wand and Draco didn’t even have his wand!”
“Finally he confided in me. He simply panicked because his Patronus had started to change, he was broken-hearted and desperate.
He cleared his voice. “Charming indeed. Is it difficult, Dean? To charm pictures I mean? Could you create an Imagic for example?”
“Let me get that straight. You’re asking me, if I want to spend the weekend with my boyfriend and two cute dogs at your house? When I have the chance to go back to school at once, no doubt to be interrogated by the Headmistress and get myself buried under tons of missed lessons? Hmm… I’ve got to think about that carefully.”
The dance party ended in turmoil. Several students were alarmed and shouted questions at Ginny and Cass. Most of the Gryffindors got ready to leave, apparently they wanted to see with their own eyes what had happened at Gryffindor Tower. Others, mostly Slytherins, were annoyed about the interruption and demanded the party to be continued.
When he set his foot on the first step, he was immediately assured he need not worry, as the stone turned completely wobbly and no longer supported his weight. It felt like trying to climb stairs made of jelly. Mere seconds later a cat-shaped Patronus darted down the stairs, gave Harry a significant look and ran upstairs again. Harry assumed, he was meant to follow and tried his footing on the steps once more – yes, now he was able to climb alright.
“Very well, Master Harry Potter Sir,” Kreacher squeaked with a deep bow. “If Master wants anything else from the kitchen, anytime – Kreacher will prepare it.” He disappeared with a significant ‘Bang!’
Most of his students chuckled but one look at Harry’s annoyed face made them quickly start swimming again.
“I most certainly did not expect you, my dear! What a surprise… what a pleasant surprise indeed!” Harry had never heard the portrait talk with such a mellow voice.
“Thank you, but that won’t be necessary – “ Harry tried to refuse but instead of Laddley, Josh snatched his bag away.
“Ah, I see,” the Imagic said, “it is unfortunate that I can’t come along… you don’t have any suggestion what I might attempt today? I’ve been looking into more or less every painting of the castle without result but there must be something else I can do to help! The headmistress has no time for setting me a task… she is busy keeping the Aurors under control.”
He added a few words to Aberforth’s note, stepped to the corridor outside of his room and pinned the letter to his door.
Looking at his watch Harry said, “It’ll be about one hour after dinner till I finally dive in, that’ll be ok.” He had missed swimming during the last few days for all that had been going on and desperately needed some physical exercise. It would help him sleep better as well, he thought.
He volunteered to lock up and was therefore the last one in the swimming hall, when the door opened again and a very dirty person appeared. Harry had to look twice to identify Ginny hidden under layers of mud. He couldn’t help laughing at this sight, but still had to tell her off.
Within the course of just one week Harry fell into the pleasant routine of school-life. The recent changes at Hogwarts did not alter his feeling of being totally at home – and he was immensely happy about it. So much had passed since his last regular weeks at school, but thank goodness many things were still the same: Interesting if sometimes tedious lessons, the dread of home-work, Hermione’s and Ron’s double act of affection and bickering, not to forget three delicious meals a day and the wonderful smell of fresh air whenever he went outdoors. He especially enjoyed visiting Otto at the owlery in the evenings and taking him for a flight. His new pet had easily settled in the new environment and seemed to relish the company of other birds.
“Stop laughing, Harry,” said Draco, “you don’t want to encourage them! They can go on like that for ages – I’ve come to suspect they’re actually stand-up comedians in disguise. And excellent at procrastinating. They’ll be late and all in a hurry – and then they’ll blame us.”
It turned out that Narcissa Malfoy and her probation officer had been put into door-to-door guestrooms. When Harry and Josh entered her room, they found Narcissa Malfoy sitting on a sofa, one arm around Cass’ shoulder.
Fake-Draco looked very smug. “A pub is a wonderful place for gossip, especially a pub as dubious as this one. Eventually every rumour will find its way to the bar. Last weekend… let’s just say, someone dared to criticise Saint Harry, Potter the Saviour. They said you are a pompous brat and very full of yourself. Outrageous, don’t you agree?” He sneered.
Harry flew up to the owlery and peeked inside through one of the glass-less windows. He was delighted to see Hagrid standing in the midst of very excited birds who were all trying to gain his attention and to catch scraps of raw meat he was feeding them. Hagrid really was many animals’ favourite human being.
“No!” Tommy shouted. “I mean, it’s fine Harry. Just leave it, ok?” He seemed to be really uncomfortable about Harry’s suggestion.
Harry and Draco fetched the tea Draco had prepared already from the kitchen and sat down at their usual place in front of one bay window.
“I understand your concern, Ms Malfoy,” McGonagall said, “and I hope very much that you are right but the Aurors still have to do their job.” McGonagall turned towards Ginny, “Ms Weasley, please accompany Ms Malfoy back to your dormitory, thank you.”
Molly held him for a minute, until Harry relaxed and the tension in his body disappeared. Finally she removed her arms and looked pleased again.
“Right,” Harry said, “we’ll see about that, Kreacher. But as long as I am at Hogwarts, I want you to stay here as well, ok? I need an ally at the kitchen in case I’m starving,” he grinned at the elf, who puffed up proudly.
“Very well,” Kingsley nodded. “We found a hexed painting in his room, hidden in the closet behind his trunk. Three of the missing Imagics are trapped in it.”
“He never visited at all, which is not surprising. The archives don’t hold Muggle items.” McGonagall rolled the parchment further down and sighed again. “Which brings me to unpleasant news, I am afraid. When going through the records of all visitors during the last week of August, one name stood out. According to the registry on Friday the twenty-eighth of August a person presently staying at Hogwarts visited the Magical Arts section. Yet, it is not a teacher, but a student – Draco Malfoy.”
“Shall we go to the pavilion? It is not very far and a very nice walk, I assure you,” Narcissa Malfoy continued and while they took their stroll over immaculate lawns between beautifully trimmed flower-beds and bushes, their hostess continued to make polite remarks about the fine weather, about the roses and the little fountain they passed by. Had her voice not trembled occasionally, she could have fooled Harry. Narcissa Malfoy tried obviously very hard to keep her countenance.
“No, you don’t. The Laddleys have suffered enough,” Aberforth shook his head, “leave Greg alone, Harry, he’s got plenty on his plate without your snooping.”
Cass poured the tea and they both sat down. This time the food was right on the table, tiny sandwiches, which seemed to be smoking and a plate of rather colourful muffins.
“No need to apologise, Ms Silver,” Flitwick said, “none of what has happened is any of you fault! Maybe you can even help us to solve this crime! The first question is – can you describe those men, how they looked like? The strange artist and the young man?”
Not until next morning -on their way to Friday's first lesson- Harry got Hermione’s update. At least something to cheer him up – Draco had skipped today’s early morning tea and Harry was more disappointed about it than he wanted to admit.
“Enough!” Harry shouted. His anger must have released some wandless magic because suddenly Laddley was not to be heard anymore, although his mouth was still moving, a bit fish-like in fact.
Harry nodded. “I see… so, Narcissa Malfoy… when will she arrive?” He felt slightly alarmed at the prospect of meeting Draco’s mother again.
Embarrassing as it might be to be teased like that, still in a way it felt… perfectly normal. Ron would make fun of Harry’s love interest no matter who they were. He had needled Harry two years ago, while he was with Ginny as well. It felt like a step in the right direction, if Ron was comfortable enough to joke about Harry’s feeling. Definitely preferable to awkward silence.
Harry stared at the picture. Three girls were looking at him, obviously sisters. Two of them were dark haired, the middle child was blonde. Although their features were very much alike, their expression was not.
Harry groaned silently. He was determined to do something, anything to continue this investigation. They needed to find Taurus Malfoy or Draco’s safety was at stake!
“Of course I’ll support her,” Harry meant what he said, “and not just because you asked me! That’s the least I can do – she more than deserves this.”
“Why don’t you all wait at the Gryffindor common room for us, together with Ginny and her new friend? And we will see you there as soon as we are done?” said Molly Weasley. “I want to talk to my kids in private before I am officially introduced to all the students – and when I say ‘my kids’ that includes you too, Harry!”
“Well done, Mr Potter, you seem to have quite an artist’s eye for colour,” Flitwick said admiring Harry’s choice before he turned the shirt white again. “Who’s next?”
“Unlike my brother. Tim was lying next to me in a four-poster and he was… just broken!” Laddley gasped. “There were bruises, all over his limbs. But it wasn’t only his body that had been abused, his mind was broken as well. I asked him what had happened but he didn’t say a word, he just silently cried and cried. It was terrible… in the end I carried Tim out of that horrible house and as soon as I could disapparate I took us both home.
And last year – naturally Harry had been totally consumed by his fight against Voldemort, hardly the time for romantic feelings, but still… he had been delighted, when Draco had refused to rat him out that evening at the Manor and not just for the obvious reason of wanting to survive, but also because he desperately wanted to trust Draco. Finally, at the night of the Battle of Hogwarts, he remembered his uttermost panic when Draco was very nearly killed by Fiendfyre – Harry hadn’t hesitated for a second to risk his own life for Draco. And in the end it had been Draco’s wand that enabled Harry to destroy Voldemort… How comfortable Draco’s wand had always felt in Harry’s hand… Fuck! Harry groaned and his cheeks burned when it dawned on him how that sounded.
Hermione put her hands on her hips. “Ron! This is just…” words failing her, she shook her head and looked outraged.
“Can we please stop talking about Malfoy?” Harry sighed, “Don’t you think we have more pressing issues to deal with?”
“Yes, she most certainly will,” Madame Pomfrey said giving his visitors a stern glance before she smiled widely at Harry. “Welcome back, Mr Potter.” She looked quite pleased when he nodded back and grinned.
“I hope your help won’t be necessary. I’ve already alerted Kingsley and as Head of A.D. his credit should do the trick.” Josh shook his head. “Occasionally I’m really mad at the Ministry’s administration, some of my colleagues are just so… lackadaisical. Just following orders, no practical sense.” He sighed.
“Tango, Mr Potter,” Draco answered. Although he obviously played by heart, as no sheet of music was to be seen, he did not turn around.
“You think so, Professor? Well, I don’t.” Hermione said firmly. “I think they were just looking for paintings and Imagics, not for hidden potions or secret correspondence with an accomplice.”
After the swimming lesson, Blaise, Tommy, Harry and Josh stayed to swim laps. Josh was an excellent swimmer as well and their training quickly became competitive. It was a lot of fun – Josh behaved just like any other guy and not like a teacher at all. Harry was proud of himself for keeping his cool about Josh's presence.
“Oh Harry, I know this must sound awful, but the Malfoy family was nothing but dysfunctional, when Draco and I were little. Two brothers who detested each other, two weak wives and mothers who tried to calm the waves and avoid any confrontation – and us kids. Frankly, we wouldn’t have survived, without each other and our beloved Nanny.”
Blaise’s comment had been anything but helpful to ease the tension between Harry and Draco. For the rest of the day Draco didn’t speak a single word to Harry, he didn’t even look at him and skipped both lunch and dinner. Harry wanted to scream his frustration at Draco – but bit his tongue.
Laddley nodded, pushing his food around on his plate. “Yes. I’ve been working for the Ministry at the United Nations, which is the most important international organisation of Muggles. Quite interesting to see how they are running their affairs.”
“Well, finally I get to meet you!” shouted the other teenager – and within an instant Harry realized his mistake. This was not a boy, but a girl. Admittedly a very tom-boyish girl. As Harry stepped closer, the differences became more obvious. She was not quite as tall as Draco, had sparkling blue eyes instead of Draco’s grey ones, a softer jaw line, slightly fuller lips and cheeks.
Flitwick rubbed his hands. “Excellent, excellent... the Headmistress left quite a long list of things she wanted me to tell you, Molly, to prepare you for your new position. And in fact I need some things to discuss with you too, Arthur. We better get started.”
Harry kept his voice low. “It’s about Professor Laddley. You said you were friends with his late mother?”
“I brought you something,” Harry said to change the subject and pulled the Sorores Cup out of his pocket and set it on the table in front of their hostess.
Harry and Hermione hardly had time to squeeze into the alcove, which was partly hidden by a larger than life suit of armour, when Kreacher reappeared in the company of two other House-elves with a triple ‘Crack!’.
“I can assure you, I don’t! As usual I have not the slightest idea what is going on in your funny little head.”
He asked Hannah to join him at the front. “Ms Abbott, close your eyes for a moment and recall a cat’s miaow… have you got it? Is it clearly in your mind? Fine. Now call your Patronus while concentrating on the miaow, ok?”
Another benefit of having Blaise around was that he really knew how to handle Draco Malfoy. Whereas Cass was easy going and fitted in with Harry’s group of friends as if she had always been there, Draco was moody. Sometimes he behaved more relaxed than Harry had ever seen him, then again he was quite tense and cagey. Blaise had a way of dealing with Draco that was interesting to watch. In fact, Blaise didn’t even treat Draco differently from everybody else, he was just his usual self – confident, loud and often a bit too much – but that seemed to do the trick.
“I know. We all knew about it. Dumbledore desperately wanted to educate you at Hogwarts – he expected the Dark- ,” she cleared her voice, “he expected Voldemort’s return and was fully aware of your destiny. Cass was not as important to him of course,” Narcissa said dryly.
“I second that,” Harry said, “and as you’ve been asking what I did – I watched Quidditch practice and then spent some time on a broom myself. Do you approve of these activities, Blaise, or are they even worse than cross-country?”
“I’d like that,” said Cass resting her arms at the windowsill, “it’s so peaceful up here as if one’s troubles are not that important after all… does this sound silly to you?”
“Harry, I’ve just got an owl from the Burrow – Mum and Dad are totally ok with me dating Cassy,” Ginny beamed, “they’re glad I told them and Mum writes
“Oh, but the cards must be magical! Look at number twenty-one! Every evening the moon on the card is exactly as full as the real moon outside!” Luna exclaimed.
Finally the door opened and Gregory Laddley came in, pulling a cart with training fins, pull buoys and hand paddles. He left the cart near Harry’s deck-chair and kneeled down to check the water’s temperature.
“Ah,” fake-Draco nodded solemnly. “Aberforth Dumbledore. Maybe that’s me? You must be very curious indeed… well, I suggest we play a little game, to kill some time, shall we? We have all night to continue.”
“Don’t call me superhero!” Harry snapped back, “you sound just like Draco–“ he stopped abruptly and cringed.
“Hey, guys and girls – get into the coach, will you!” Ron shouted clapping his hands. “I’m starving and the quicker we get to the castle the sooner the feast will begin.”
“That’s a nice tune, Mr Malfoy,” Harry said, “what is it?” Lately they had started to address each other with mock formality. Harry couldn’t even remember, who had started it but he felt, the rudeness of using just last names didn’t suit them any longer and they didn’t dare using first names – yet.
Half an hour later Harry and Tommy munched their way through a variety of dishes in front of the Gryffindor common room’s fire-place. Kreacher had rejoiced in the opportunity to prepare his master’s favourites and delivered the food in person. The House-elf was still wearing the fake locket Harry had presented to him a year ago and beamed at Harry with much devotion.
“Mr Potter, hear me out,” Laddley pleaded, “I know you like to stand up for people in need, for minorities and such… but this is different! You might not know any homosexuals… you have no idea, what people of his kind can do!” He pointed at Tommy. “Homosexuals– they corrupt innocent minors, they destroy families, they-”
“I agree, Hermione. I guess, that’s how I feel about Teddy as well. No doubt I miss Tonks and Remus, I will always miss them, but spending time with Teddy… it just makes it a little bit more bearable.” Harry said.
Josh stared at him. “Harry, you cannot seriously doubt getting into Auror training? You are more than qualified for that job! The A.D. will be most pleased to employ the wizard who finished off Voldemort!”
“Strictly speaking, this is not a question, Mr Zabini… and none of your concern either,” said Professor Jordan.
“Right,” Harry said to Aberforth, “I’m glad you’ve arrived safely, Mr Dumbledore. I’ve got to go now but I’ll visit before long – and we can talk about that night as soon as Madame Pomfrey sees fit.”
“I’d think so? If I were you, I’d get a curse-breaker to have a look, but I don’t think there’s any risk of killing you.”
“Just good? You don’t have anything else to say?” he asked, mocking. “Surely you can do better than that, Potter?”
Narcissa would like Harry, Draco thought. She would have liked that he made Draco laugh, and that would have been enough for her.
“Draco.” He jumped, not expecting Maggie to be right behind him when he turned to go back to the front desk.
Draco grimaced (he couldn’t exactly deny that) as Millie pouted, looking between the three of them. “Will someone stop being cryptic?” she demanded.
He groaned and slid his fingers under his glasses, squeezing the bridge of his nose. He’d be fine after a few more hours of sleep.
He shrugged. “As you’d expect. He called me blind and unfashionable.” He caught her giving him a sideways glance and frowned. “What?” he asked.
Draco glowered at him. “Skipping the queue will cost extra,” he said, though he wasn’t sure the two projects they had counted as a
“Yeah, well, me neither, but I showed the woman the robes and she said she’d need to check with her colleague — then out walked Malfoy.”
“Uh… Nothing really, just a bit of extra work he wants done. Oh, and an order to go to the War Recovery ball this year.”
“To be fair to the man, you did order robes from him and you’ve gone to his shop every other week for a month,” Ron said.
“Are you coming to dinner at Ron and Hermione’s tonight?” he asked as they joined the end of the line, examining the limited choices of drinks (tea, coffee, tea with milk, coffee with milk).
“‘Jubilee’?” Greg echoed doubtfully under his breath as they obediently followed the house elf’s pointed finger.
. While he may have all the relevant experience, Harry couldn’t imagine himself leading a department. He was only twenty-six and he couldn’t keep a relationship going, let alone a national branch of law enforcement.
’. He might have got a bit heated in his questioning of the cleaner (some had described it as an interrogation) and he regretted raising his voice, but for fuck’s sake, it was an
works but we can use any colour fabric so that doesn’t particularly matter. I was more looking for what styles you like.”
“Yes,” Draco agreed, “I’ll be having words with Hugo when he’s old enough about how arriving three weeks early is very rude. I spent ages on Ron’s dress robes just for him to weasel out of it.”
as a ‘pioneering force in wizarding fashion’, Draco found Madam Malkin’s taste hit-or-miss. Today’s was a miss. On her short, plump body, the forest green robes with brown chintz designs made her look a bit like a decorative throw cushion — especially when she raised her hand and he saw the curtain-like tassels hanging from the cuffs and hem.
Robards mimicked Harry and sat back, crossing his arms as he regarded him. “You seem confused,” he observed.
At first, the pain was manageable, like someone running their hand across your sunburnt skin, but it quickly deepened into an intense tickle unlike anything Harry had ever experienced. It felt like his bones were covered in ants and he wanted to
and how she wants me to be the next Madam Malkin. Which, yeah, I get, but she’s not even that old! I don’t know why she’s so obsessed with making sure there’s someone to take over her shop.”
“Your robes. Of course,” Draco said, folding the fabric in half again and again until it couldn’t get any smaller. He stared down at the desktop, smoothing his hands over the material. “They’re over there. You can sort out how much you owe with Maggie.”
Something hardened in Potter’s eyes and he stood up straight, pushing away from the wall and marching up to Draco so there was barely an inch of space between them.
, his traitorous brain pointed out, unwilling to let him go more than ten minutes without thinking of the stupid blonde prick) and he’d yet to come up with a satisfactory answer.
“Yeah, it’s me,” he called back. The door was ajar, Draco nudged it open with his foot to find Maggie sat at one of the two work tables with her feet propped up on the tabletop, absentmindedly plaiting a strand of her waist-length purple hair as she read a Muggle newspaper.
He glanced over, his eyes resting on Draco for the briefest of moments before returning to the floor. A fiery red blush had spread from his cheeks down his neck. Pansy elbowed him sharply in the side as Millie, Blaise, and Theo pelted Greg with questions about the girl.
. I can assure you, I see plenty of customers in their underwear, you’re nothing special.” But even as he said that, Harry thought he saw his eyes travel down and up Harry’s body. Harry gave up fighting for control of the curtain and covered his groin instead as Malfoy pointedly started handing him clothes. “Here, put those on first,” he said, giving him a pair of trousers.
Ginny nodded and followed Harry into the nearest cafe, which was busy with Muggles on their way to work and the queue stretched from the counter to the door.
“Okay…” Hermione said slowly, turning her back on him as she cracked two eggs into a sizzling pan. Harry took another slow sip of the hangover potion. It had a faint woody scent that was familiar, but he couldn’t place it. “Well, what about—”
Afterwards, he regretted not owling her to let her know he wouldn’t make it, but he never regretted going. As Ginny yelled at him, all he could think of was trudging down the artfully placed stepping stones through the rain to the Malfoy cemetery (because
It was for the War Recovery Ball and his stomach twisted unpleasantly. He’d always wanted to go — it was the kind of party he and his friends would have been at every summer if their lives hadn’t turned out the way they had. It was exclusive and luxurious, filled with only the top brass of wizards and witches, which no longer included former Death Eaters and their friends.
“Yes please. Is the carrot cake…” She pointed to the sweets cupboard and Harry nodded, even though she knew her way around the Grimmauld Place kitchen better than he did.
If only Potter could have stayed out of Draco’s life, everything would be fine. But always he had to insert himself where he wasn’t welcome and Draco was once again at a disadvantage because of it.
Perhaps Greg wanted to say something else, but whatever ember of courage he’d discovered had flickered out. “Alright,” he said and stopped fiddling with the apron string, tucking his hands into his pockets instead. “So, do you guys have any money?”
Draco had dared to say what he actually wanted in St. Mungo’s rather than what he knew Harry wanted to hear? Would Potter have entertained the idea, or laughed in his face?
, Malfoy? Ring any bells?” he snarled, his voice matching Draco’s in volume. A small, cautious part of Draco’s mind cautioned him that someone might hear them and call the Muggle authorities, but he was too angry to back down.
“Oh, right! Shit. Yeah, here you go.” He tossed their wands back and Draco immediately pocketed his, trying not to outwardly show how relieved he was to have it back in his hand.
“Nothing wrong with looking,” Blaise said. “If it was a group of shirtless Muggle men, you’d all be leering as well.”
“No, she definitely won’t,” Harry said with a smile, thinking back to all the late nights at Ron and Hermione’s, listlessly listening to her lecture about brutish cast-first, think-later attitude of the Aurors. No wonder he’d fit in so well.
He was hard again. The thin satin tented obviously around his erection, and he could feel Potter through the soft cotton of his joggers. The elastic waistband was easy to pull down, and he gave a silent thanks to the Muggle clothes designers who apparently made clothes with the sole purpose of being easily removable. He wasn’t wearing underwear and Draco’s voice was ragged as he whispered, “
“See you ‘round, Potter,” she said, and headed off down a corridor without waiting for Harry’s reply.
. Did you not finish your raid the first time around? Are you here to smash some more paintings? Tear up some robes for no reason?”
“Oh, fuck, I’m going to…” he trailed off as he came. Harry kept his mouth around his dick, licking around the tip as he swallowed, and Draco watched reverently, carding his fingers through Harry’s hair, stroking it almost tenderly.
Cass hesitated for a moment and then said, “Harry, I know you don’t like Draco and he’s certainly a bit of an idiot sometimes, but honestly – who isn’t? Still in his heart he’s a good person. He means the world to me.”
“Ladies, gentlemen and everybody else! A short update from the cockpit – this is your captain / author speaking. We are approaching our final destination fast and will reach ‘The End’ in seven chapters. We expect serious turbulences for this part of the journey and therefore ask you to fasten seat belts. Be assured we’ve got everything under control. If the journey has pleased you so far, please recommend our service to other potentially interested travellers. I bid you a good day / night & enjoy the ride!”
Harry closed his eyes for a moment and exhaled deeply before he said, “I admit to changing my mind. Although I wouldn’t call my efforts dancing yet. Well, I was told it makes no sense to attend a dance party without dancing. And I’ve learned to take advice – sometimes.”
So they left together. Laddley kept quiet but Josh chatted away about Teddy, Molly’s success as D.A.D.A. teacher and even about the fine weather – until Harry got the distinct impression he was avoiding some other topic.
“What if I don’t want everybody and their brother to know about it? I’m telling you, because you’re my friend! I most certainly don’t want the whole witcharding world to drool over my love life!"
Hermione glared at her boyfriend. “Oh, so now you want to switch back? But maybe Harry wants to stay? Maybe I want him to stay?”
Minerva McGonagall continued, “So you will remember that this office was damaged too – although not as badly as other parts of the castle of course. But still there were repairs to be made. After students had been sent home safely, the remaining staff made an inventory of the demolition and we started planning. We decided to store all of the valuables at the Ministry archives for the time of the reconstruction. Among these items were the magic paintings including the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ portraits – the Imagics had agreed unanimously with this arrangement. Perhaps Headmaster Black would like to continue…” McGonagall turned towards the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black.
Harry kept quiet. He had actually wanted to ask Ron to be his fake escort, flying out of Hogwarts together for as long as they were watched, but then going all by himself. But Ron seemed resolved.
Harry spent the rest of the day mostly outdoors, as the weather was fine again, but the forecast promised rain soon enough. He took Otto along to visit Hagrid in the morning and in the afternoon discussed the Imagic issue with Hermione and Ron, sitting on a bench near the lake, making plans for their enquiries into the matter.
Early next morning Harry awoke with a start. He listened closely but could hear nothing but his own fast heartbeat. Was it the silence of his new bedroom that had startled him? Harry wondered. This room was spacious, comfortable and – extremely quiet. Never in his life had he slept in a room as still as this one. At the Dursleys’ he had been used to a cacophony of Muggle media sound – the telly’s constant chatter, blasting radio programs and Dudley’s shooter games. During his previous years at Hogwarts, sharing a bedroom with Ron, Dean and Seamus, Harry had never been the only one who snored. Add Ron’s vivid sleep-talking and the occasional embarrassing noise of someone wanking, their sleeping arrangements had been anything but quiet. Even his beloved bedroom at Number Twelve – which was quiet enough but of course full of London’s white noise – could not match the absolute stillness surrounding him now.
“Yeah, maybe I don’t. But… tell you what, life is not worth living without a challenge and –disregarding Tom Riddle– you’ve been the biggest challenge of my life so far.”
, Harry could not help thinking, as Draco looked skinnier than ever. His blonde hair shimmered like silver in the afternoon sun and Harry had to admit, his Nemesis had an elegant posture. He was most certainly handsome, standing there like a male model posing for pictures.
with him asking for his support. Whatever. He was in dire need of distraction, so he scribbled his reply without thinking twice. He would see her tomorrow for another Sunday high tea at the pavilion.
“Good morning, Mr Potter,” said Severus Snape’s Imagic, staring down from the Wizard’s Wood with Polly on his shoulder. The forest had lost most of its colourful leaves, it looked bare and empty. Daisy and her terrifying pet were nowhere to be seen.
“Right, Mr Dumbledore,” Harry hesitated for a moment before he went on, “I wanted to ask you about your brother’s portrait. I’ve been told, Professor Dumbledore hated to sit for paintings and that his portrait at the Headmistress’ office is therefore the only one of him that exists?”
“I will try to persuade Aunt Walburga to visit another painting,” she explained to Harry, “assuming she must be rather lonely after so many years. Even hostile people can get lonely, you know?”
“But,” the Headmistress continued, “that is not enough. Changing your behaviour will be a necessity of course, if you want to stay at this school permanently – but I repeat: it is not enough. If you just
She levitated the pumpkin with her wand from its place at the foot of the staff table and made it rise up in the air. “This pumpkin has been enchanted to spill the most appropriate motto and the name of its author, who will be asked to explain, if necessary.”
“Well, the Malfoys have been breeding snow owls at the Manor since the eighteenth century, when the first aviary was built. We’ve had hatchlings this spring and I wanted to offer you one of the young birds… we could have a look at them, if you were interested?” Narcissa Malfoy said nervously. “In case you pick one of them, our caretaker will train the bird for you, if you wish – or you could train the owl yourself.”
“Wow, that’s… – I’m really glad too.” Cass beamed at him. She looked so cute, Harry suddenly remembered Ginny saying, Malfoy was actually quite handsome. Maybe if that git didn’t frown all the time…
Harry had to admire Hermione’s skills not only as a witch but also as an interior designer. Their place no longer looked anything like ordinary dorm bed-rooms, but like a young couples’ first shared lodging – which it actually was.
“How about we leave the whole matter for tonight?” Kingsley said. “Tomorrow morning Ms Granger and her friends will consult the library, while we interview the abducted Imagics. Meanwhile my team keeps searching for Malfoy. If we catch him in the course of the night, we’ll be able to interview him in the morning! Maybe the whole matter can be solved before the week-end is over,” he said with forced confidence.
“Not bad? Tommy, you’re probably the best swimmer of the school!” Harry said with feeling. “What exactly did he say?”
“Nobody is going to judge you, Sylvia.” Headmistress Da Ponte said with a stern look at the humans. “Right?”
“So you’re not totally stupid, apparently? The way you fell into my little trap like a real simpleton made me question the Dark Lord’s abilities. If he was indeed defeated by an ignorant teenager, the world of dark magic is far better off without him.” The blonde man smirked. “Anyway … keep on shouting, go on! You can even call for help, if you want to. This room is as good as soundproof, nobody will hear you.”
Ron turned to his sister. “Are you crazy? Harry’s your ex-boyfriend – you know damn well he’s straight!” And he gave a slightly hysterical laugh.
“Look, I’m sorry,” she ran her fingers through her hair, just like Draco did when he was embarrassed, “I’m sorry I lost it. So you fancy him too?” She smiled when Harry nodded.  “Well, I so much hoped you might… one day. He’s been sweet on you for ages. I’m just worried about him… he’s not doing well lately…”
Cass shrugged. “I seem to have this hyper sensitive gaydar – if there is even just a hint of queerness in someone, I’ll spot it. But I do believe being gay is as much a choice as it is a disposition,” she said firmly, “everybody should have the right to decide for themselves… whom they want to tell and how they want to live.”
Harry sighed and decided to finish clearing out that bloody cupboard, which had given him the bump. Rummaging around at the very back of the nearly empty shelf, he grabbed an odd cup… or vase… or something? A small item with nice proportions made of fine bone china, painted the wizarding way with a moving picture.
“What? Just yesterday, you wondered, what’s going on between Harry and Gin! And I said, let’s ask Harry! And you agreed!”
“But… if that’s possible – how come none of the Aurors tried it when they took down the other portraits?” Harry asked suspiciously.
But what about the imminent Weasley and Malfoy encounter? Maybe they were already talking to each other, just one floor below? He remembered Molly’s statement of blaming Draco’s parents rather than Draco himself for becoming a Death Eater – that did not bode well. But Harry wanted them to get along. He knew Draco was close to his mother in his own way, at least as close as two uptight pure-bloods could be. And Harry himself had taken a liking to Narcissa Malfoy, especially this afternoon, when he had seen her all emotional and vulnerable.
Two hours later Harry was finally ready to leave the pool. The rest of today’s lesson had run rather smoothly. The regular swimmers gave their new instructors no trouble at all. When it was time for the newcomers to get wet, quite a number claimed to be in group two – only to find out that Harry and Blaise switched groups.
“Which he isn’t, we have checked,” Phineas Nigellus fell in, ”seven of us have spent the best part of September at the archives and we have been running around like madmen among hundreds of thousands of paintings…”
Harry floated through the rest of the afternoon smiling. Being way too excited for a nap he stopped by Ron’s and Hermione’s rooms. His friends were busy removing all the changes they had made to their place, when he broke the news, that he would not accompany them, but go with Draco instead.
“I am glad both of you could make it tonight, I really wanted you to see him,” Harry said. “He entertained me all day. I can’t remember the last time I laughed so much.”
Harry was deeply impressed by the effect her natural authority had on the students. She looked content and calm, even friendly, but still nobody in his right mind would disobey her. Including Harry.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry mumbled, “I can eat later. Maybe I’ll heat up your fry, when Andromeda comes home.”
The House-elf appeared with the usual crack and bowed deeply. “Kreacher at your service! How can Kreacher please Master Harry Potter Sir?”
He quickly opened the window to let his pet inside. Otto took a seat at the back of his preferred chair and hooted in a moaning way. His feathers were ruffled and his left wing was bent in a strange angle.
“Oh, well,” Draco said looking at his sleeves, “at least it doesn’t hurt. Nice colour, Hermione, although it’s rather yours than mine.” He smiled at her.
Harry could not hold back any longer. He wrapped Draco in his arms and murmured, “I’m not done with you yet, do you hear me? Don’t you dare leave me for good! Promise me to come back as soon as this nightmare is over! Promise!”
“Wow, that’s as broad a grin as I’ve ever seen on your face, swim-mate!” Blaise boomed as Harry sat down, “You must’ve found a very satisfying way to spend Saturday afternoon – I’ve missed you in the pool, by the way… please don’t tell me you went cross-country like all the other worshippers of Josh the Fabulous?”
“I was so mad! And not just at the Malfoys, but also at myself! Why hadn’t I left the Manor in time, at least when those greasy guests arrived? Why had I trusted Lucius Malfoy in the first place? Why hadn’t I realized that his ‘friendship’ was nothing but fake? Of course he had just lusted for Tim! Malfoy had spotted my brother at the train station, after Christmas, when Tim saw me off together with mum. That’s all the reason he needed. Just a beautiful young man he wanted to share with his perverted friends. I have been guilt ridden ever since.”
Flitwick turned around and said, “Good thinking, Mr Potter! Your defence skills are really extraordinary!” Then he was gone.
“Just… don’t forget to let the dogs out, into the garden, David, if you can’t be bothered to leave the house,” said Odie confirming Harry’s thoughts.
Harry ruffled through his hair and cleared his voice, “No, I didn’t… I thought… well, it doesn’t matter what I thought, this isn’t about me. It’s about you two and I’m happy for you, so – congrats'!” He smiled at the girls.
Narcissa Malfoy sighed again. “It was futile of course. The two of you belonged to opposing forces in a frightful war. Draco was torn apart between his attraction to you and his family’s loyalty. In the end the tension was too much for him. I must confess, I didn’t take his feelings seriously for years, I expected him to get over his crush until… “
He sat down again in his usual place facing Harry. They looked at each other. Draco’s eyes were shining and so full of feeling, it made Harry gasp and flush. It was a small relief to see that Draco’s face was quite pink too. With an effort Harry turned his eyes away to watch Cass walking tall towards the staff table. She nodded politely at McGonagall, stood next to her and addressed the students.
When Harry told Andromeda about his decision the next day, right after their usual Friday lunch, he was rather surprised by her response. They were sitting on a wooden bench behind Andromeda’s cottage observing Teddy and Otto, who were mutually fascinated and frightened by each other. The little boy was clutching at his grandmother and not daring to get close to the bird sitting on Harry’s arm.
“This is ridiculous! I’m asking you again: Who are you?” Harry blurted. “Taurus Malfoy? Aberforth? For fuck’s sake – at least show yourself!”
“That is exactly why I don’t feel comfortable in letting him go anywhere else. For him this is a huge chance. The question is will he take it?” She looked again at her watch and sighed. “I’m afraid we have missed today’s dinner. I will ask the House-elves to serve some light supper for you in the Gryffindor common room.”
Seamus and Luna just passed, but Neville declared, “Calling cockatoo!” – which made the other three players groan.
Harry stared at her. She did not rule out the possibility that someone like – let’s say Draco Malfoy, just for an example – might already been spoken for? The thought alone was stomach-churning. Harry shook his head in disbelief.
Harry laughed, “Looks like Blaise was not the only one feeling that it was about time for an intervention.”
He was just about to knock again when a side door to their right opened with a creak and Aberforth appeared.
“That’s excellent news, Harry! David will be delighted! He told us, that he had been temporarily suspended and needed to get away from school for some time.” Odie put a cutting board with a loaf of bread on the table that made Harry’s mouth water.
“But you have to admit, Malfoy doing a runner does not look good,” Ron said, “can’t blame Shacklebolt for his suspicion.”
“Yeah, good news, like us, being an item!” Ron beamed at Hermione and placed his arm around her shoulder. Otto seemed to be jealous of his new found lady-friend and tried to sit on top of Ron’s arm until Hermione handed the excited owl to his proud owner.
If Harry was totally honest with himself, he lately had hoped for another reason. He had hoped… that maybe Draco being with Pansy hadn’t been so much different from Harry’s own attempts of giving heterosexuality a try.
“Good. Because I do not have the slightest idea.” She seemed to be highly amused by that fact. Turning to leave she added, “I bid you all a good night, Gryffindors. Don’t stay up too late. Just in case of an impromptu Transfiguration test tomorrow.”
“Whereas the original message on the front states,” he turned the parchment around and cleared his voice before reading aloud.
“He seems to remember me from the Manor’s aviary,” Draco said, “when he was still a hatchling. I was glad when I heard that you had picked him from amongst his siblings… he always stood out.” Otto had finally messed up Draco’s hair to his satisfaction and flew back to his master.
to return? Maybe living with his gay Muggle friends or lovers was better than anything the wizarding world had to offer – including Harry? Or – an even more dreadful thought – what if Draco was in trouble? Harry needed to find out, the sooner the better. And Otto seemed to be his only chance to contact Draco.
They had finally finished pudding and he planted a loud kiss on her flushed cheek. “Off you go, ‘Mione, your date is waiting for you!”
McGonagall chuckled. “Well, Miss Granger, I am sure Mr Potter will explain everything to you much better than I could. Let me just say as much – it is a great gift to have you at our school especially in times of troubles.” And with a final nod she went back to the staff table.
But obviously the mattress was worth every Galleon, as he could not remember a time in his life, when he had rested as comfortably or as peacefully. Each morning he would be surprised that he had slept right through another night without being disturbed by ghastly nightmares like so many nights before. Not that he was without dreams at all. He dreamt some pretty strange stuff recently, often starring Otto in a major role. And some of his dreams were… well, quite embarrassing. About chocolate brown eyes, smooth dark skin, sandalwood smells and such.
Draco rose and cleared his voice. “Forget what I said. I volunteer to do the dishes… need to show Harry how the dishwasher works. Meanwhile you two might want to dress up and pack?”
Harry was well aware, that any such registry was not necessarily complete, by proof of unregistered Animagics such as Rita Skeeter or Harry’s very own father.
McGonagall laughed. “Students are the least of her concerns! No, the library is very moody and can be rather… touchy. Among the staff we call her Lady Library. Madam Pince merely tries to keep her Ladyship in good spirits, that’s why she has to be so strict with all the patrons.” She gave a little laugh. “Be assured our Madam Pince can be as bossy with us teachers as she is with students, just to please her Ladyship.”
“Fine, let’s get back to the castle,” Hermione said with a look at her watch, when suddenly out of nowhere Headmistress McGonagall appeared at their side.
Draco was speechless for a moment before he cleared his voice and said. “Fine… so I’ll wait at the Room of Requirements for you – if I can find it. But what if I don’t? Or what if you can’t get away?”
“I might as well tell you while we are waiting for Filius and Severus to return… please sit down, Harry.” McGonagall sighed, “The head of the Ministry archives, Amanda Pince who is our Madam Pince’s younger sister, happens to be a very good friend of mine and with some persistence and a little bribe she let me have a look at the archive’s visitor registry.”
“Never mind – what is going on? Don’t pretend it’s nothing, I’m not stupid. Your sudden interest in Magical Arts, Imagics dropping in an out of this painting here – I assume that’s part of what is bothering you, right? That’s why I thought Cassy might have some valuable information and asked her to tell you… I’d really like to help too, you know, but I can’t, if you don’t tell me!” he pleaded. “Plus you missed yesterday’s morning tea. Big offence, Mr Potter! Had to pour your tea down the drain!” He grinned again but still looked worried.
“Thank you very much, Kreacher,” Harry smiled at the elf, “I hope everything is alright at Number Twelve?”
“That’s one of the most important international organisations of Muggles, something like a world government, mainly to support peace and human rights worldwide,” Harry explained.
Late in the evening Harry opened the door for Ron and Hermione, who finally retreated to their respective rooms (or, more likely, to their cosy apartment). He heard piano music coming from the common room. Either Draco was still awake… or somebody else was playing? Harry decided to have a look. As the investigation gave him every reason to improve his relations with Draco Malfoy –Hermione had told him so, mind you– he did not intend to procrastinate. Not even late at night. When he entered the common room, he found the card players just about ready to leave and yes, Draco played the piano.
“I can live with that, but don’t make a habit of it,” Harry said keeping his voice unimpressed. Annoyingly enough he felt a sudden flush rising up from his neck. Draco was the one supposed to flush all the time – fuck, was that contagious or something?
Taurus Malfoy! If he had captured Draco right here, at the pub, making use of the sitting room, what the hell had happened to Aberforth? Taurus Malfoy must have overpowered the pub owner who was now probably incapacitated – or maybe even dead? But Arthur had seen Aberforth only this afternoon – so it all must have happened this very evening!
Snape’s Imagic cleared his voice before he said, “Mr Potter, I’m here to explain the purpose of the latest addition to this common room.”
“Who are you?” Harry shouted for the umpteenth time at the blonde man, who grinned maliciously at him. So far his opponent had kept quiet and busied himself with fastening and hexing ropes around Harry’s body and the chair. Finally he seemed satisfied with Harry’s ties and stepped back. He gave Harry a strange look.
Harry bit his lips to refrain from grinning broadly and his pulse quickened at the prospect of a weekend in undisturbed togetherness.
The door snapped in its lock. Harry gulped and tried to focus, in spite of his jealousy and outrage. Draco still had to be informed, to know what had happened and that he could return safely to Hogwarts – if he wished. But Harry need not necessarily be the one to deliver that message. He could call for Josh instead. The young Auror would certainly be willing to take over and ring the bell.
“Scones – I guess?” Harry answered and both of them grinned. Joking was easy with Ginny, they enjoyed the same sort of humour.
“Not at all, I guess I feel the same about this place, have been up here many hours over the years.”
Waking up on Saturday morning Harry was eager to get going. Finally a day without tedious lessons to endure, he had both time and permission to investigate some more. A quick shower, getting dressed and Harry was ready to go. Reminiscence of the past weeks as well as craving a cup of tea made Harry heading for the common room first.
Concerning the investigation Harry’s line of thought focused on Ariana’s missing Filia Cup. He was quite convinced that this was important, that someone had taken it and used it to lure her brother away. Dumbledore’s Imagic would not be fooled easily into a trap painting, he argued, but Ariana’s Imagic, even a miniature one, could tempt him to be careless.
“That’s at least something to work with,” Harry said, “I can try to find out what exactly has happened between them… maybe Laddley just wants to punish you instead of your father, because he can’t get a hold of him?”
Laddley seemed to be amused by her praise. “I am very glad to hear you enjoy my lessons, Ms Whiteside, but as Mr Potter grew up with his Muggle relatives he surely would be very bored at my class.”
“That’s the most unlikely promise I’ve ever heard,” Draco Malfoy said sitting down face to face with Harry at his usual place. “Seriously, you are always putting yourself in danger, Harry. Whatever you have in mind – don’t do it alone!”
“Oh, thank you for that heartfelt compliment, darling! Finally someone who appreciates my – ” fake-Draco gasped and swayed a little.
When his eyes had adjusted to the darkness, he suggested, “How about we grab that table over there?” He pointed at a window, which was so greasy it made hardly any difference to the general murkiness of the inn. “I’ll get us three butterbeers, ok?”
Harry flushed. He had tried to ignore Draco as much as possible for the last few days and of course there were no more early morning encounters at the common room. At first Draco appeared struck by Harry’s changed behaviour, but lately he seemed to accept that Harry kept his distance. And that was just what Harry wanted – distance.
Harry laughed. “Who would have guessed! Ron Weasley, taking safety measures seriously! I never thought I’d live to see the day!”
“Alright gentlemen, you’ll be right as rain in just a moment,” the Healer said, coming back into the room with a stoppered jar of milky white potion, two empty vials, and a swab. He put the vials down on a table and then held the swab out to Harry. “Mr. Potter, if you could rub this around the inside of your cheek, please.”
“Professor McGonagall, sorry! Hello. I didn’t know you were here,” Harry said as they turned to face her. Her robes were slightly too garish for Draco’s taste, but if there was any witch who could pull off tartan dress robes, it was McGonagall.
“I don’t even know where to start. Work is… I love it when there is work, but we hardly get any customers. I can’t imagine we’ll still be open by Christmas and then I don’t know what I’ll do. Maybe it’s a good thing. I should start looking for a proper job.”
attractive: his long hair paired with the scars gave him the sort of rugged charm that Draco couldn’t resist. Still, he was a
The workroom door slammed shut behind him, causing Maggie to regard him curiously and he wondered whether he looked as frazzled as he felt. He heard the bell tinkle as the front door opened and closed, helping to calm his nerves.
“Stop overthinking this. I’m very talented, remember? Witch Weekly dedicated two pages to my brilliance last year. I could build a business in Hogsmeade in a week,” Draco said, but then sneered. “I’m
“I didn’t do it for you,” he said. “And you still need to leave. You can’t attend a funeral you weren’t invited to. Especially not barefoot in your pyjamas.”
It dawned on him that Theo had been gone for longer than expected, and he could tell that Pansy had the same thought because she glanced at her watch, frowning.
“Why do I get the impression that you don’t know what that means?” Draco snatched the invitation from Potter’s hands. So much for Seeker reflexes.
Ron took the opportunity of a night off fatherhood to drink so much whiskey that Hermione — drinking only coffee because she was breastfeeding (because apparently that was a thing) — had to take him into bed within the hour. Ginny had training in the morning and left at the reasonable hour of 2 o’clock in the morning. Luna, Neville, and Harry stayed up for a few more hours, talking about how Hogwarts had changed and what their old school friends were up to and eventually fell asleep sprawled across the couches and floor.
?” Draco asked, outraged, as Potter grabbed his elbow and steered him towards a corner of the market that had been cleared for Healers to inspect the other unlucky bystanders.
The kiss was tentative at first, but it didn’t stay chaste for long. Harry turned around to face Draco fully, allowing the sweet kiss to deepen into something more primal, urgent,
He nodded and they fell into an awkward silence as they sipped their drinks. She took a bite of carrot cake and hummed with pleasure. “This is good.”
He wanted to take two steps forward and close the distance between their bodies, but his feet were stuck to the floor. It was midday and between the sunshine and the ticking clock, everything felt too… Bright. Their physical relationship had been restricted to darkened shop corners and midnight trysts, and while he wasn’t about to assume he knew what went on in Draco’s head, it didn’t feel like the time or the place.
“Stop it, Granny,” Maggie said as she entered the room with an armful of old stock. She sounded tired, like she’d already worked a full day on a busy shop floor despite the clock only just hitting 9 AM. Her purple hair was braided into several complicated loops on top of her head, and along with her moss-green robes with drooping petal-shaped sleeves, she reminded Draco of a wilting flower.
Harry stayed at the table, nursing his tea and wishing it was an acceptable time of day for something a little stronger.
“Of course not! I just want to be my own person and do what makes me happy,” Maggie said, her voice scratching over the denial. Her eyes were quickly filling with tears, clinging to her eyelashes like raindrops caught in a spider’s web.
“I know,” he said, reaching out to take the bag from her. She jerked her hand away and scowled at him. He sighed. “I know,” he repeated. “I can… Well, actually, I can’t really explain. People were looking at me, you know I hate it.”
“Well,” Robards clapped his hands, rubbing his palms together like the excitable Muggle TV chef that Harry liked to watch on lazy Sunday mornings. “That’s the whole point of these meetings. I’m not retiring tomorrow, we have lots of time to get you ready for leadership.”
“You have to tell me everything!” she said, pulling a chair from one of the other sewing tables and sitting on it backward, resting her elbows on the backrest and putting her chin in her hands.
about it, but Maggie would lose her marbles and Pansy was so busy with work that Draco hadn’t seen her in a week.
want to talk about Potter’s urges in the middle of his friend’s grandma’s funeral. Potter blushed as he realised what he’d said.
Potter cocked an eyebrow. “You’re thinking about me an awful lot,” he said, and Draco kicked viciously at his bare ankle.
“I ran into him, yes,” he said, turning away from Maggie to look over his current project, a simple alteration of some ugly dress robes. (He shouldn’t complain: any business was good business.)
It was an excellent question and it was a shame that Harry didn’t have a satisfactory answer, or any answer for that matter. He cast around for any normal reason he could give that wasn’t ‘I’m having a minor mental breakdown.’ Malfoy frowned at him, his lip curling into his customary sneer.
“Arm twenty six,” he narrated, the Quick-Quotes Quill scraping pleasingly across the parchment at the side. He stepped around the box so he stood in front of Potter and tapped his other arm so he could thread the tape measure under his arms and around his chest. “Okay, breathe out…”
“I was just thinking that when England offered me a chance on the team — I didn’t have to think about it because I knew it’s what I wanted.”
Potter looked disappointed but resigned; however, as he went to pick up the robes and leave, Maggie piped up.
“Continuing to do something just because you’ve spent time on it in the past is a stupid reason to do it if you don’t enjoy it.”
“Well, of course,” McGonagall said with a laugh. There were two high spots of rosy pinkness on her cheeks that Draco hadn’t noticed. Although her hair was pulled into its usual tight bun, a few wayward strands had got loose and flared wildly around her face at all angles. “If Gilderoy hadn’t had that unfortunate accident, he’d owe me fifty Galleons — I told him you two would end up in a relationship at some point, but he insisted Draco just exhibited classic fan behaviour.”
“You know,” he said, leaping to a new topic, “I ran into Wood at the pub the other night — he said he’s heard Cormac McLaggen is also aiming for the England team.”
She stomped into the sewing room and started to aggressively tidy, clearing away the barely touched cups of tea with a wave of her wand before turning her attention on the pile of robes she’d brought in from the shop floor. Her eyes were red-rimmed and clashed with her outfit.
