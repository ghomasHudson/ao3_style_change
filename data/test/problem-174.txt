Harry was inside Draco's wings.
"And your family?" Draco asked curiously. Harry frown slightly.
Harry opened his eyes, looking around to find himself standing in a candle lit room with potions and spell books scattered around the tables.
"You are dismissed potter." Snape said shooting at Harry. Harry wasted no time walking fast out of the classroom.
"Why are you here....Draco..." Draco gave Harry an actual smile.
"Harry!" Draco ran up and grabbed him as they fell in.
Harry opened his eyes to meet complete darkness.
"Expelliarmus!" A voice called and Pansy's wand flew out of her hand and onto the ground. Everyone glanced down the hallway to see a very irritated Draco Malloy.
"Even worse, Draco will realize I wasn't there." Harry said sighing. The twins went pale and quickly got up and grabbed Harry, running out of the room.
"What sounds like a plan, what are you and the weasels up to now potter." Harry nearly jumped and turned to see Malfoy with his arms crossed, wearing his bitch face.
"I am sure you rather not contaminate our golden boy Mr. Malfoy. I do have some words with him after all." Snape said as he used a spell to clean his sleeve. Draco frowned and looked at Harry before letting go.
"No, but I believe I know who it is after talking with Madam Ravenclaw. Another old professor who used to work here, Edward Rimplestein." Harry said feeling his stomach drop just by saying his name. Snape nodded seriously.
"Yeah! The Harry Potter adventures continues!" George said smiling excitedly.
"Harry, are you alright?" Draco asked quietly, looking abit concerned. Harry gave him a small smile and took his hand.
"Atchew!" A sneeze resounded in the room. Everyone turned their heads to see Draco Malfoy enter the hall with a handkerchief to his face. The room went silent and he looked at everyone, abit embarrassed. A growl forced everyone to turn away and continue their conversations. Harry jumped out of his seat and ran over to Draco, concern evident on his face.
"Let's just get this over with." Harry said, feeling the guilt as he remembered draco's confused face as he called his name.
The twins nodded as they followed Harry to the portrait.
"Do not lie to me Potter!" He yelled angrily, causing Harry to flinch.
"I would prefer it if you did not tell him of your visions, but considering he is your mate, it would be best if he found out from you and not on his own. I suggest waiting until he is better, a veela is even more protective in their vulnerable state and will most likely not listen to reason and may accidently harm you." Snape explained. Harry bit his lips again and nodded.
Harry just looked at him completely star struck.
"Well hello der, sorry bout that." Hagrid said smiling.
"I apologize Professor, but I couldn't wait. You see, I am in reach of a specific book." Tom said cooly. Edward raised an eyebrow.
"......alright, so I might be the mate of Draco, I still fail to see why that matters."
"Fine, Then I suppose I shall ask Mr. Malfoy about your strange behavior-"
"Hey, at least we didn't harm him." George said with a smile, earning a glare from Harry.
"Because he's my golden boy."
"Of course." Draco sniffed. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry woke up with a gasp, his forehead sweaty. He felt Draco's arms around himself as he bit his lip, calming his heart beat down.
Snape cleared his throat.
Harry hugged hem back.
"Harry what where you thinking?!" He demanded. It was then that Harry realized Draco's eyes were white. He quickly rubbed Draco's wet and cold arm with his free hand.
Harry still blushed deeply, but didn't say anything.
That name breaks his heart, and turned it into a cold terror. His blood feel as if ice is running through his veins at the sheer thought of the name.
"Did you see the killer's face?" He asked. Harry shook his head.
Harry sat down next to Draco and Snape started his class. As Harry wrote down his notes, he began thinking of the voices he heard by the portrait.
"No!" Madeline yelled.
"Let's just get off this bloody train." Harry went out of his compartment and came face to chest with Draco.
"Why did he do that......why did he-....what did he-.......best not think about it too much." Harry said to himself as he carefully got out of bed.
"Harry!" Someone called his name from beyond the wings. It was Hagrid.
As Harry opened the door he saw Draco there, slightly shocked that it was opened. They stared at eachother.
Suddenly a woman's face appeared in Harry's vision, her body floating in the lake. Harry let go of her hair and yelled in terror, crawling backwards. He ran into something and looked up at the dark figure. A green light covered his vision and he opened his eyes, finding himself on the slytherin common room floor.
"Be careful mates." Harry said as the twins walked off.
"I don't know, what if it's dangerous? Draco would get angry if I get hurt." Harry muttered. The twins laughed.
"...Hello Professor." They said in unison as they stood up, a guilty look on their face.
"Come Potter." Snape said. Harry looked at Hagrid.
"5 points from griffindoor for running on the halls." He heard Snape call behind him.
"Now, my dear students, I am positive none of the books we offer hold this potion. At least, not anymore." He spoke in thought. Harry swallowed his fear before speaking.
"Edward stop!" Harry walked faster, reaching for the door.
"She was a very dear friend of mine. It broke my heart when we lost her." She said sadly, then her expression turned angry.
"W-What?"
"I'm fine guys, promise." Harry said as they headed to the changing room.
Harry made his way to the common room, figuring it was late by the lack of light outside.
"Madeline was a dear friend of mine, She was a bright and cheerful woman. She was also the smartest woman I had the honor of meeting. She created many potions and spells, such as the potion you've stumbled upon.  But they were unfortunately too powerful and dangerous to teach our students at the time, so we allowed her to work in her own lab." Dumbledore explained. Harry was in thought.
"Edward Rimplestein. He was another professor who used to work here. He also went missing around the time she disappeared."
Harry wondered what happened and where he was. He looked around, careful not to wake Draco up.
The twins pulled back and looked at their young friend confused.
"....um....alright...D-Draco." Harry said, trying to keep the excitement from his voice.
"He did seem to dislike her for awhile, but when she disappeared, he was the worst of us. He refused to eat, he hardly slept, and he would disappear for hours until one day he just never returned." Dumbledore explained. Harry looked confused before shaking his head.
"I am sorry sir." Tom growled.
"No, it's really not-"
"Cheer up, Malfoy is here too." Harry paused and turned behind him slowly, seeing Malfoy's angered eyes on him.
"You idiot! How can you not open the door!" Tom yelled.
"Hey wait!" But he was unable to exit. He sighed, looking around the room. He recognized one of the books from his last dream and picked it up.
"I'll protect you, I promise." Draco said rubbing Harry's back. Harry relaxed slightly and laid back down, his head on Draco's chest.
"You've only been here for two days Harry, and you've found yourself in here both times. You need to be more careful Harry." Pomfrey said.
"I do sir." Harry said firmly with a nod. Dumbledore hesitantly takes the necklace from Snape, studying every detail.
"S-So out on the field..."
"I'll be fine." Draco chuckled lightly before coughing.
"Ingredients to what, Mister Potter." Snape's voice came from behind Harry. Harry nearly jumped a foot into the air, not expecting his professor behind him.
"Professor I do not think that." He said quickly.
"It is okay now Ed, all is forgiven." She said as they melted into a kiss again. Once they broke apart, Edward looked at Harry.
"Actually sir, Fred and I believe we found the lake Harry described in his dream." George said quickly. Snape gave him a cold glance.
'A hour left, fantastic.'
"......This is the key to Madeline Croft's Secret room." Dumbledore said, a tear fell from his eye.
"You'd best keep your tone appropriate, you are standing in front of a malfoy." He said snootily. Harry scoffed and started pulling on draco's arm.
"This place is beautiful...." he said out loud. He noticed movement underneath the water and scrunched his face. He leaned closer to see what it was, but couldn't make it out. He rolled up his sleeve and put his hand in the water and felt around for what it could be. He suddenly grabbed onto a handful of stringy noodles. Wait, that's not right.
"Please....don't tell Draco." Harry said sadly as his eyes watered. Snape turned to him and raised an eyebrow. he went over and sat back in his desk.
"I saw her in my dream." Harry explained. The woman looked in though before clearing her throat.
"Oh Draco." He said quietly as he watched his chest rise up and fall back down, his wheezes sounded loud in the quiet room. Even ill, Draco looked like a god, his beauty barely dented by illness.
"I would hope you were." She said crossing her arms, angrily.
"Well, it is not a subject I prefer, but to inform our young withes and wizards about the use of dark magic and the dangers that comes with the use of it, I willingly wrote about the new discovery from our researchers." SHe said with a small smile.
"We were all sadden by her disappearance, especially Professor Rimplestien." Dumbledore explained. Harry looked confused.
"And most importantly," Fred began.
"Of course." Harry smirked.
"Ah, Severus, Harry, Draco, what a lovely surprise." He said walking over to his desk and sat down.
"H-How did you know?"
"Save it Hagrid. Come out." Snape called as he waved his hand. The couch moved to show the Weasely twins from behind.
"Draco." Draco cut him off.
"But Draco looks human, well, abit more beautiful before last year." He muttered, causing Draco the beam happily.
"......what is going on....." Harry turned to see the woman from his dream quickly leave the room. Harry went to follow.
"Hey!" Harry exclaimed embarrassed.
Draco cleared his throat.
"And What, pray tell, possessed you and Mr. Weasely to go into the Forbidden Forest? I Believe you both are not stupid enough to not know what Forbidden means, or am I wrong." Snape said coldly. George gritted his jaw in anger before speaking.
".......what is going on?" Harry asked himself as the lady began to hum, opening the book and grabbing the ingredients.
"Yes, the grounds keeper." Snape said annoyed. Harry and Snape was walking through the grounds to Hagrid's hut. Snape and went up to the door and knocked on it.
"We will once I go in. I have to do this." Harry said firmly as he took off his socks and pants. He left his glasses for last.
"Don't Draco...just-....don't." Harry sighed, walking off to his table, leaving Draco there to figure out his mistake.
"I'm tell you, you're wrong."
"......Sorry." Harry managed to say. Malfoy looked slightly surprised.
"Yes....very beautiful." Draco said with a smirk. Harry turned alittle red as he smiled.
"It is good to see you my boy." Dumbledore said to Snape. Snape nodded.
"I do not know what you are talking about sir-" Snape abruptly stood up and knocked the chair back as he rounded the desk and grabbed Harry by the tie, forcing him to look at him face to nose.
"Albus, it has been too long." She said smiling.
Harry mentally sighed, wishing there was at least one other student in the classroom.
The twins nodded.
"Madeline!" Madeline turned her head to see her love running to her with a smile.
"Harry?" Draco asked Harry. Harry turned his head to meet the glowing eyes of a wet Draco.
"Course Arry, be safe out there!" Hagrid called as Harry closed the door behind him, smiling.
"....I don't know, this whole situation is confusing." Harry sighed.
"........" Harry instantly remembers what happened and looked at Malfoy confused.
"Let him go Draco, he needs some time alone." He said gently. Draco growled slightly and then sighed.
"I would like that." He said. Draco smiled back, then cleared his throat.
"Alright, let's head down to breakfast." Fred said standing up and putting the parchment in his robe sleeve.
"Hagrid?" Harry asked confused.
"Oi Harry, don't hurt yourself." Fred joked.
"Draco." He said breathlessly. Draco's eyes were a beautiful silver, almost glowing. He had these beautiful pair of white wings. The moon was shining onto him, making it seem like his hair was shining.
"Alright Harry....I will try, for you." Draco said hugging Harry. Harry blushed abit and hugged Draco back.
"Whatever, just don't topple the boat, please." He began to row. Malfoy sighed and pulled out his wand and castes a spell on the boat. It started rowing itself.
"If you're trying to hurt my potter I'll-" Malfoy was soon in a sea of fan girls.
"Accio blanket." He cast a spell and a blanket zipped across the room, and laid perfectly over Harry.
"Harry?" Fred asked. Harry whipped his head at the twins.
"...I love you." Harry said blushing. Draco smiled brightly as he grabbed Harry carefully and planted a kiss on his lips." Harry nearly lost control of his broom before Draco pulled back with his famous Malfoy smirk.
"I've seen her in my dreams. What can you tell me about her?" Harry asked carefully. Dumbledore glanced at Harry, and then the twins before snapping his fingers. The place where the caldron was, was replaced by a couch and a comfy chair. Dumbledore sat in the chair, gesturing for the twins and Harry to sit. After they all sat down, Dumbledore began to speak.
"Ma'am!" Harry yelled getting on his knees, trying to get her attention.
"And George and I have two days ago." Fred said smugly. Snape snapped his head towards the twins, an irritated look on his face."
'Wake up?'
"I was just looking through my second book, I have the potion right here." She said as she guided Dumbledoor to the books. He looked distressed.
"I-...I am sorry what happened to Madeline, I know you loved her greatly. But why? Why did you kill her? Because of a bloody book? Because of stupid Tom Riddle? I didn't come this far to just turn away. Please, give me something so that you two may finally rest in peace." Harry said as he reached his hand out and touched the cheek of the stone.
Draco started Harry with a kiss. Harry was so shocked he froze for a few seconds, then jumping up and fell into the water.
"Rowena, I require access to the room." Dumbledore said. Rowena frowned instantly.
Harry kept his eyes up front, ignoring Draco's presents, and it seems Draco has kept his words, be he hadn't even looked at Harry this last week.
"Give me the books Madeline!" He yelled. Madeline cried out as she held the book in her hands, close to her chest.
"Tonight. We can get three of these ingredients there, then leave before curfew."
Harry and the twins were sitting in the Room of Requirement, adding the last ingredient to the potion they spent a week creating.
What am I going to tell the twins.
"What the hell?!" Harry looked across to see Draco.
"Tell me where the book is Madeline!" Harry opened his eyes to see a door at the bottom of a stairway, completely dark.
"We found it in a lake sir." Harry said. Dumbledore finally ripped his eyes from the necklace in Snape's hand to look at Harry.
"Well-"
"Incendio." He casted. Fire left the tip of the wand and set ablaze to the unfortunate material in front of him. Harry began to cry harder as he fell to his knees, his head hung as the room filled with smoke.
"Alright Harry, whatever you say."
"......." Edward walked along the hallways, the paintings all seem to have something better to do than worry about a weary Professor. He found himself in front of Rowena's Portrait.
".....It has been many years since I've seen this color." He said in thought, examining the vial.
"....morning professor." Snape looked down, raising an eyebrow at Harry before walking off.
"Let's go your highness, we don't want to be late for lunch." Harry said annoyed.
"I am not mad at you Harry...though I will admit, I might decapitate those twins." Draco said with a small smirk. Harry smiled back at Draco as Draco's wings came out and wrapped around Harry.
"Having troubles Potter?" Harry felt defensive, but sighed. The look of confusion and concern crossed Malfoy's face, but before he could say anything to him, Pansy and Draco's fan club crowed Draco, pushing Harry further into the twin's compartment.
"Hello Hagrid." harry smiled.
"Draco and Harry, sitting in a tree." The twins sang. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry looked at him in horror, his chest hurting.
Dumbledore heard a knocking on his office door and waved his hand, opening the passageway. He was greeted by the sights of one of his favorite teachers and students. He smiled and gestured for them to come in.
'Maybe I can ask Madam Ravenclaw.' He thought.
"...." He put the book in his robe before he reached down and picked her up, heading to her favorite lake.
"Madeline! Please, you must listen-"
"Bloody veela." He sighed heavily as he grumbled and stormed away, towards the direction Draco went.
Harry shut the door in his face.
".......Come my friends, you deserve to know of her room after all the trouble she caused." Albus said as he headed to the door.
Harry sighed as he continued down the hall towards his class. As he walked he felt his eyelids start to fall.
Draco tightened his grip abit more, then nodded lightly.
Little did he know, Draco woke up when Harry snuck out of bed.
"You fell asleep in the hallway. I caught you so you didn't hit your head." Draco said sitting up with Harry. Harry turned towards him with raised eyebrow.
"Potter!" Snape yelled as Harry went under. The twins leaned over the lake but were pulled back by Snape.
"You go on ahead, I'll take my own."
Harry felt very frightened, but also felt a sense of relief and guilt.
"Harry, I'd much prefer to attend classes with you instead of being confined to bed." Draco said with a small smirk.
He had to go tell Professor Snape.
"....Is there a reason you're here Malfoy?"
It was hair.
"I've got a game to win." He muttered and flew after the snitch again as it flew off. It start flying higher and higher.
"Professor." Edward heard. He turned his head to see a small boy standing in the corner. He recognized the boy instantly.
"Well, good luck mate. Ya gonna need it with snapey." Fred said, smirking.
".....awwww he called you his potter!" Fred teased Harry.
"Thank you Rowena." Albus smiled. The portrait looked sad as she opened her picture to show a dark passageway. Dumbledore looked at Snape and then the students before heading into the passageway, Snape right behind him. Draco held Harry's hand firmly before he went after them, the twins hot on their heels. Once the small group entered, the portrait closed, and the hallway was lit up by small candles littering the walls around them. They were able to make out a set of stairs ahead of them leading down.
"....sleep well Draco."
"We never said that mate." Fred said quickly.
There was a bang and Harry looked at the entrance.
"I will."
"If there is something wrong, we need you to tell us."
"And you think this man killed her."
"Like what Harry?" George asked.
"Yeah Harry, and take care of those bags under your eyes. Don't want ya falling asleep in Snape's class." George chuckled as they split up from Harry.
"This is not a game George."
"Is it morning yet?" He asked tiredly.
"Harry!" Harry blinked multiple times to clear his vision as he could finally make out an image of his angel.
".....Well, I suppose I go in." Harry said as he began taking off his shoes and his tie.
"It's alright Harry, I understand your boyfriend is abit jealous." Draco glared at Cedric.
"Tell me or I'll kill you!" The man, Edward, yelled.
"Thank you Harry, you've finally set us free." She said smiling. From the corner of Harry's eye he saw a transparent Edward stand up from his stoned body. He had a shocked expression on his face before it morphed into a sad yet happy look.
"Nothing happened, I promise."
"Do you know a Madeline?" Harry asked. The woman looked confused, then realization.
"The creator....Was her name Madeline Croft?" Harry asked, watching Dumbledore's reaction. He looked shocked, then collected himself.
"Mr. Potter is with me, though I cannot imagine who is with you both." He said coldly. Hagrid cleared his throat.
"I'll say this one more time, give me the book Madeline!" He yelled, raising the wand at her.
"What am I doing here?" He wondered. He walked forward, passing a few trees in the process and stopped in front of a lake.
By the desk against the wall, sat a stone figure of Edward Rimplestein. His form has crumbled due to time and there were cracks littering the body. Harry slowly approached, as if in a trance.
Harry looked at Draco confused.
"Why did someone make a sculpture of him and left him in here?" Snape asked.
Harry couldn't recognize the man he was with, but could take a good guess that it was Professor Rimplestein.
"Arry!" Hagrid smiled brightly.
"You don't understand, he will kill you-"
"Fine." George said walking past him.
"Draco, Love, if you are not feeling well, I would much rather you rest." Harry frowned. Draco raised an eyebrow before sniffing.
"It was fine, thanks Hermione. And yours?"
There were five boats left so he got in his own.
Harry felt his blood go cold and frozen in terror.
"So you've been seeing a man and woman in your dreams."
"Well professor, it is called The Dark Magic of the Horcrux." Tom said smiling like a predator. Edward looked stunted.
"Professor, if I may ask, where is this lake located?" Harry asked.
Hagrid was waiting for the first years and helping the other years through there teleportation to Hogwarts.
After an hour, Draco was asleep, but Harry just laid there, listening to draco's heart.
Harry shrugged, sitting on the couch in the dormitory room. He's glad that it was early in the morning so no one else was awake, and those that were, were too tired or busy to eavesdrop.
"Now I need canabis snail." He said looking around.
"You just don't really talk about him anymore." George said.
"Not into too much trouble are you?" He asked looking at Harry and Draco.
Harry smiled as he pulled out the mauders map.
Harry turned his head and looked into draco's eyes.
"That's guys. Night." The twins waved at Harry.
There was a flash of light.
"No....I'm so sorry." He said quietly before he sat down in the chair by her desk.
"Harry no!" Draco could hear.
"......." Harry sighed and rubbed his face.
The sound of the door opening caused him to open his eyes. Tom stood back and watched as the  portrait opened for the last time in ages. He quickly ran down the stairs and opened the door.
Harry blushed harder and shook his head, feeling Draco tighten his grip.
Harry got into bed and stared up at the ceiling, thinking of the one name and why it brings terror to his heart.
"Hello potter."
In the distance he could hear a familiar voice, feeling the arms that he loved the most wrap around his torso before feeling himself being pulled up from the water.
"Isn't that right, Mister Potter." Harry managed to finish as he looked up to see Snape had called on him.
"I don't know! But there has to be! He was crying when he left her body in the water." Harry said with tears falling. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry.
"Very well potter, then explain to me why I shouldn't talk to your beloved Veela about this and exactly what connection you have with Professor Croft." Snape said folding his arms. Harry rubbed his eyes and sighed heavily, sitting back down.
Harry made a disgusted face at the fan girls and got up. He realized Malfoy said HIS Potter.
"Oi, dont go getting yourself drowned mate." Fred said smirking. Harry looked at him and nodded.
Harry looked at the wings than Draco.
"Oh....well..." Hagrid said trying to come up with an excuse.
"Because we won't mind having a talk with him-"
Harry sighed and continued to take notes.
"Well then, I shall return to my quarters. Good night, Harry." Draco said, unable to hold back a smile.
Harry headed out of the room, stopping and looking at Malfoy once more before shaking his head and closing the door behind him.
"Uh huh."
"Now what?" George asked. Snape and the twins looked at Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes as the other students piled in. Hermione and Ron sat on each side of Harry.
Harry groaned as he he pushed past the twins to exit the common room.
"Where were you this morning?? You weren't at breakfast." He said worriedly.
"Malfoy, your eyes, why-"
"Potter, Draco, if you would be so kind as to sit down and allow me to start my class, I might not take away any points for your public display of affection." Snape's voice rang in the air.
"you're a bloody liar, I know you have a copy on you!" He spat. His eyes caught the book on the shelve and before he could lunge at it, Madeline grabbed it and held it to her chest.
"It seems to me Mr. Potter, You are a Seer." Snape stated. Harry looked up at Snape confused.
"Step aside Draco." Snape said as he moved Draco out of the way and took his wand out.
"Absolutely not," Snape spat.
"....I've been seeing her in my dreams." Harry explained.  Snape raised an eyebrow and gestured with his hand for Harry to continue.
"I can't believe Snape is trying to ruin our fun." George sighed as Harry stirred. He frowned, thinking about his earlier talk with Professor Snape, and then when he explained to the twins what happened an hour ago.
"Hagrid, do you have any other guests?" Snape asked raisng an eyebrow.
"We will be fine, it will be quick. Meet back here in 10?" The twins shrugged.
"Wait up!" Harry called as he ran after them.
"Fred, George, have you seen Draco?" Harry asked as he kept looking over at the Slytherin table. The twins looked at eachother, a look of mischief on their face before looking at Harry.
"This is Edward Rimplestein?" Draco asked confused.
"........she disappeared, never once seen again."
"....Mr. Weaselys." Snape said with a glare. Fred and George gulped.
"I've sent a patronous potter, they should be on their way back, and maybe, if your excuse is good enough, I won't tell Severus about your little adventure."
"Hold on, I'll get help!" He said in tears at her. He saw her look up at him then her eyes dulled.
"Harry!" Harry looked to the side to see his beloved mate, Draco. Draco was flying next to him, his wings ruffling in the breeze.
"Only the first day and he's being more of a prat than Malfoy."
"Sleep well Harry." Draco said, kissing Harry's head. Harry smiled and closed his eyes and nuzzled into draco's chest.
"Well at least he doesn't know about our little potion sessions." Fred snickered.
Snape's eyes widen slightly as everyone looked around.
"Madeline?" He called. the wax from the candles dripped down the walls, the books stayed where they were last place, unmoving, but no Madeline left to be seen. Edward silently cried as he slowly realized what it was he'd done.
"Where is the light?" Fred asked. Dumbledore took out his wand.
"Maybe you should see madam Pomfrey."
"We do not know what is in there!" He said angerly.
_______
"Harry, we should create this in the recreation room!" Fred said smiling.
"It is madam Ravenclaw, and I apologize." He replied.
Harry was waiting for Draco outside his Magic History class,  when he was approached by a group of slytherin and hufflepuff students.
"Very well, perhaps I can help. What is the name of the book?" Edward asked curiously. Tom gae the professor a smile that froze Edward's blood.
"Off to bed children." The portal echoed.
"Well mate, you best think on it. We'll see you later Harry." Fred said.
Harry huffed annoyed.
"Alright, we should spilt and get these ingredients." Harry suggested. Fred and George looked at him skeptically.
Madeline.
"You too Draco." He said, soon falling asleep in draco's warm embrace.
"As in Albus Dumbledoor?" George asked.
"Ed, I just care for you-"
He uncapped it and looked up at the ceiling.
"Malfoy and Harry sitting in a tree, S-N-O-G-I-N-G!" The twins sang. Harry huffed and put his stuff up.
"I told him not to tell you." He said. Draco growled and glared at Snape.
"You fool! If I did not catch you when I did, you would've been dead!" Draco roared.
"Do not 'Huh' me potter, see me after class." Snape threatened as he continued to write on his board.
"Listen Tom, the book is not ready to be shown to students at your age, if the ministry allows it to be published at all. Now I suggested you head back to your dorm this instant." Edward said sternly as he continued stepping back.
"No sir, I suppose not." Harry said smiling back as he left. Harry sighed.
"But- I- you-"
"So what is this suppose to make Harry?" Fred asked as they sat at the Gryffindor table, eating dinner.
"I can't read lips potter."
The nurse's station. Harry sighed. He felt his eyes were wet and used his free hand to touch his eye and pulled back, seeing he cried.
"Ah ha! Here's the beauty." She said as she blew dust off of it. Harry huffed.
"...Yes, and them, stumbled across something we believe you might appreciate." Snape said taking out the necklace from his pocket. Dumbledore's eyes changed from glee to shock and finally sorrow.
"Wha- why?" He asked.
"Hello Harry, how was your summer?"
"Bye Harry!" Cedric called back as he was out of sight. Harry led to the lunchroom, Draco feeling abit guilty for upsetting Harry.
"......what a prick." George mumbled.
"I will be fine Harry, there is no need to worry." Draco assured before turning his head from Harry and proceeded tp coughing abit.
"Thank you Hagrid." He smiled.
"Malfoy?" Draco smiled.
"Draco!" Harry said flustered as they passed by other schoolmates. Draco ignored Harry's pleas of putting him down and went down to the dungeon.
"It is a rare occurrence for someone to have the same ability as Madam Ravenclaw, but with your high levels of magic and you being a magnet for trouble, It does make sense." Snape informed. Harry nodded, thinking about the information he obtained.
"Thank you." Harry whispered.
"Savage, those fans are. I hear even Seamus has a poster of Malfoy. Rotten fellow he is." Fred stated.
"Ah....um...good morning professor Snape."
"Why are you here Malfoy."
*a week later*
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry in a firm but gentle hug.
"Bye Cedric!" Harry called, dragging Draco by the arm.
"Thank you sir." Harry said. Dumbledore gave him a small smile.
"Ey Harry, you got our letter?"
"You'll think I've gone mental." Harry said resting his head on his hand. The twins gave eachother a worried look and sat across from him.
"Harry! Harry! Love, are you alright?" His lover's voice entered his ears, causing Harry to look into draco's panicked eyes. Harry took draco's free hand and gave him a small smile.
"I've told you, I'm a veela. And you are my mate."
"Hagrid, I need to speak with you." Snape said loud enough from Hagrid to hear him. There was some rumbling and multiple footsteps in the hut before Hagrid opened the door.
Someone was calling his name, but the world went black.
"What do you mean? They don't harm you do they?" Draco asked protectively.
The smell of potions being brewed and a dim littler room full of books and spells.
"Night, try not to dream about Malfoy too hard." They teased as the headed to their rooms.
"......the titles of the spells and potions are erased..........I've never heard of these combinations before......" Harry thought as he looked into the potions.
"I thought you two were on civilized terms now."
"My boy, do you know what this is?" He asked as he stood up to come around his desk.
"Alright, see you soon Harry." The twins said taking the list and ripping it into threes and giving Harry one part.
"Oh shut up." Harry said as he got the invisibility cloak out.
".....do send a patronous once you get there alright? I want to know you are alright." Draco said gently.
"The twins played a mean trick...I didn't know they got you sick until you came in this morning, I swear." Harry said when a tear fell. Draco sighed before pulling Harry closer, letting out a quiet cussword.
"Hello Fred and George." They smiled and they made room for Harry.
"Onestly Arry, Professor Snape, I never actually went ta the location. Neva ad ta." Hagrid said.
"See to it that you do, Mister Potter, I'd hate to have you in my class again next year." Snape said and flipped his hair out of his face as he walked to the front of the class.
"It is fine Draco-"
"Of course not profess- Atchew!" A sneeze snuck up on Draco and he covered Proffessor Snape's robe sleeve in green slime.
"I see you brought company. Hello Harry." She smiled.
"Sir..." The twins said in unison softly. Dumbledore seemed to be in memory lane as he looked at the red diamond in his hand.
"Hi mates." Harry replied.
Everything went black until he opened his eyes again, finding himself mouth to mouth with Draco Malfoy. He found himself on the shore of Hogwarts and surrounded by not only students, but a pair of beautiful white wings.
"Please, call me Draco." Malfoy said with a smirk. Harry looked confused.
"Alright Edward, I just need a strain of your hair." she said getting the ingredients."
"Great, now to find out what it does." George said excitedly.
"I'm sorry madam Pomfrey." Harry said as she bandaged his head.
"....sorry." Harry said quietly. They stopped at the end of the hall and looked at eachother, then to Harry, who appeared to be in thought.
"What is it?" Draco gulped and looked closer at Harry, his own eyes glowing alittle. Harry looked surprised.
"Alright, thank you madam Pomfrey. Have a nice night."
"Pansy!" He roared, making his way down the hallway. She visibly jumped, hearing footsteps behind her retreat. In a matter of moments, Draco was glaring down at her.
"Draco....its you isn't it?" Draco growled again slightly.
Harry let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding as the door opened and the twins came in, quietly shutting the door behind them.
Harry gasped and jumped in shock. This time he was sure he heard it, a ghostly man voice he hadn't heard.
Harry put the parchment in his robe sleeve as he focused on Snape.
"Only if you don't mind. Well, we don't have to be friends, yet. We could, take it slow." Draco said, clearing his voice.
"He already knew that I was with Harry. Same school, you know. And Woodie and Harry were friends before Woodie graduated."
"I can put him to nap." Draco says quietly.
"She wants to be a housewife?" Ginny asked.
"How is he doing?" Hermione asks.
"Me ow!" Astoria goes and Ginny snickers.
"Do you want it?" He asks.
"Third cabin to the right, Mr Paralegal." Darien smiles.
GOOD NIGHT AND DONT DIE IN YOUR SLEEP
Nipple suction cups
"Also, you and Blaise are her godparents." Draco smiled.
"Would you like to go on a walk near the lake?" Potter asks.
Draco stopped there on their tracks.
"Nothing, just minor fever." Cormac answers.
"You're not allowed to meet him or write him anymore." Longbottom stated again.
"It's just two pancakes and they're not even that big. No skipping meals."
"I can't- I can't be sure." I say. I can't look at him in the eyes. I try to maintain my distance from Greyback as well.
"Ms Belle Darling! 11 NEWTS and an aspiring professor for Hogwarts." The crowd cheered.
"Do you really like her?" She asked.
"Treacle tarts are nice. I love pancakes. I can have them all the day." Belle says.
"Of course, son."
"One last time pet. One last edge and then I will let you cum. You can do it "
"Also I'm very high maintenance. You'll have to treat me very well and buy me food. Also you better get me flowers or don't come at all." Draco scoffed.
"Well, yes, buz you've anyways made a choice en then you made a choize again when you distanced yourself with zhem. Zhey're not in your life anymore, 'Arry. Not really. Not even though they keep trying so much. Give zhis a chance, Harry. Don't let it go."
"I'm so sorry about th-" he gasped.
"I mean, Harry was also stuck between his best friends not knowing, avoiding and not acknowledging their feelings for each other." McGonagall replied.
"And Dumbledore used it well against us. He went all out with the Traditionalism Massacre in 1963. We all would have been in your side if it wasn't for the constant hatred all years gave Slytherin from the moment that hat yelled Slytherin and the massacre Dumbledore lead. Just because they get sorted in Slytherin doesn't automatically mean they're all evil." Nott says.
Draco immediately does it as his body makes him do it.
is to ask you to permanently move in with me." Harry says.
"If you stay here and send Teddy away, Lucius will know. We can't have him know what we're up to. He thinks we are on a vacation and are meeting you while we're here. He doesn't know that we're here to rescue Narcissa. Do your best to keep Teddy safe, Andy and leave the rest on us." Harry explained
"He was pretty amazing. He was my favorite as well. Of course I had to pretend like shit to him because of my father. I kinda wished we had a bond." Draco said.
"Are you offering, Longbottom?" Draco sneered.
"Why does Pansy says anything? Really. You know how she is. She just speaks bullshit and can't keep her TRASH MOUTH SHUT! Reintroducing people. Let's re-introduce. " She rambled and then screamed to call out Theo.
"But Draco-"
"No. I don't. I won't mind watching you dance for me, though." Harry smirks.
Harry joined Draco to his room and they were soon playing with Teddy and kissing in between. Ron had went to see his girlfriend. Neville came to their room to see Harry and Ron but was greeted by Blaise and Theo. Blaise and Theo invited him in and sat talking. Neville had already visited Hannah and she she was tired, she had slept immediately. Belle continued reading her book while Pansy and Luna sat on one bed talking about their different upbringing.
"I want them gone, right now. Every one of them." Draco grits his teeth.
"Arry? There's a birthday on fifth June. Customer has asked our best dark chocolate cake along with anything lemon and raspberries. And they will pay for the bakery to be open for about four people at midnight. Shall I accept or reject it?" Eveta asked.
Blaise catches Belle's hand as soon as they leave the hospital wing. He hugs her and kisses her forehead. They walk together to their classes. Belle holds his arm while walking.
"Why?"
"Disney?" I look at Zabini shocked.
Draco doesn't know what to think. He doesn't know if he'll ask Harry to stay. All he knows is that he has to see Harry one last time. He run towards the door and as soon as he opens it, he watches Darien standing at the door, all broken and on the verge of crying.
"Show me who they were." Harry demands.
What do I tell them, that my so call muggle family hated me. That they never let me see any movies while they took Dudley to all the movies. That I was locked in my cupboard and wasn't allowed even one but of happiness.
"This pet of yours; it's Draco Malfoy, isn't it?" She asked.
"Luna. I wish I didn't have to lie to you all but I can't disclose names. Its a matter of security. But I promise you I'm being careful." I assure her.
Ugh Moony, trust me this is awesome.
"Belle Darling?" I raised an eyebrow.
"Oh, very mature, Draco."
"Pansy, what?" Neville looks at her baffled.
"Draco, are you okay?" Pansy asked concerned.
*Service and Restrictive Behaviour*
This gave me some strength to stand up. Bee ran towards me and pulled me into a hug. She sobbed onto my chest. I pulled her away and cupped her cheeks.
But you'll are my friends! How am I supposed to live knowing I can't save you all after everything you all did to save these people? I won't be able to live with myself.
"T... T... Two." I stutter.
Astoria cuts Daphne off by standing in front of her and giving Harry a nod. Harry picks up his wand and points at Astoria.
The look on Draco's face is laughable. It takes Harry all his strength to not laugh. He bites his lips to keep from laughing. Draco's face is completely rendered of all emotions except the wide eyes blinking at him owlish.
"Do you think they'll be fine?" Draco asked Harry.
"Just remember that you can end this game any time. Don't go over than what you can't take for my sake."
Potter grins. His eyes bright through his new round, black rimmed glasses. Draco wanted him to take the rectangular ones but his heart was set on the round ones. It reminds him they still have to go shopping.
"Harry." Draco started speaking. "I have always been obsessed with you. I always talked about you and hated you. As I grew up, I felt more emotions towards you. Only when you landed on my Manor, bound, and I lied to save you, I understood my true feelings. I realised all those emotions I ever felt for you was love all along. I was just to dumb to understand that. I've always loved you Harry Potter and I always will. I promise that I'll do my best to never let you down." As Draco ended saying he had tears rolling down his cheeks. So did Harry.
"Ummhhh Malfoy." Harry moans.
"I don't mind." She said and sat besides Theo.
"Please what?" Potter asks.
Legands and lores say that when a person with most beautiful soul says their last goodbye to the ones they love before being accepted by mother earth, the sky cries it's heart out. The thunder can be heard in entire Wiltshire. The heavy pouring of rain can be heard by the loud taps on the glass window of the in built cemetery in the Manor. The cemetery, it's beautiful in it's own way. The shades of white and grey reflect the numbness of his heart. He doesn't even have it in him to shed some tears as he looks at his mother sleeping peacefully in the open casket. Her eyes closed, her lips painted pink, just like she always liked it. She lays there asleep in her favourite silver robes, looking each bit of elegant and beautiful as she always did. It's tradition that the lady of the house is buried in their wedding dress but Draco refuses. He refuses to take this last piece of her freedom by putting her in her wedding gown. He refuses to tie her down to this marriage of her even in her death. She will rest peacefully, in her favourite robes, wearing her favourite shade of pink lips, looking like she always did when she took Draco out.
I open the door to see that it's Amycus manhandling Belle.
"Mrs Malfoy, what do you mean by you won't be free after he dies as well?" Hermione asked.
Ralph takes Hera in a small cottage that is painted in beautiful blue. The house has photoframes with their old photos that were taken before both the wars. When they were extremely young and not on their almost deathbed. Hera grins looking at the pictures, reminiscing all those wonderful moments, their last three school years together. The day is spent dancing around the house and going out for a nice dinner. And when they come back home, they lay together, in each other's arms while listening to each other's heartbeats.
"As you say, your highness."
He watches as the beautiful blond enters the bakery. He looks so much different than he did six years go and yet still looks the same. The straight hair is not just shoulder lenght anymore, it's few inces longer below his shoulders. And it's not straight anymore as well. It has slight waves that suddenly remind him of Luna. The smirk that gave him the cocky look is nowhere to be seen. There's a soft smile playing on his lips as he speaks to Eveta in fluent French, ordering what he wants. He isn't wearing the stiff robes anymore as well. Instead, he's wearing jeans, a crop top and black leather jacket matched. His red crop top matching the red stilletos and pink gloss on his lips. He smiles at Eveta and walks to sit on one of the chairs near window that gives the view outside of the bakery. He pulls out some books and parchments and pens and starts working.
"Draco-"
"You are not taking him anywhere." Harry growls.
"Waiting for my interview as an editor. Quitting the Prophet."
"Harry and I had a bet. He won apparantly. My bet was you wouldn't find our until Christmas. He had said Halloween." Hermione laughed.
Don't do anything you don't have to and be safe.
Harry walks into that club, his heart pounding as loud as the music inside. The club is dark except all the colourful disco lights flashing around. All neon blue, pink, green, red, yellow. He stalks around the club, his eyes drifting everywhere until it stops on one person sitting on the bar. Bright blonde hair falls on his eyes as he scans the menu. Harry avoids the dancefloor and walks towards that person to the bar. He stands besides the blonde and gives him a once over. The blonde is wearing a shimmer blue net top with a tight black, indecently short skirt, looking like a meal. Harry orders whiskey neat for himself and then stares at the beautiful blonde again. Theres glitter on the blond's cheeks and eyes.
"What do you mean?" Ginny asks.
"Did you. Uh. Did you want him to be sexual with you?" Harry asked and held his breath.
"Mr Malfoy. I have a solution for the both of you. I know this is a special case so I'm ready to make a special arrangements. The seventh years and eight years will have one common room and dorms, no matter the house. We have built up a new tower just for you all. I am willing to construct two more rooms. You and Teddy will be having your own adjoining rooms. If you can get a helper to help you babysit Teddy while you are in your classes then you both can live here. Also Madam Pomfrey and Madam Pince have agreed to look over Teddy on regular basis while you will be attending classes. Will that be okay for you?" She says.
As soon as everyone was settled, I cleared my throat to get their attention. Blaise was out to bring alcohol, Pansy and Theo were cooking, Bee was getting ready, so I had a while to get my apologies in order.
I looked at him wide eyed and my jaw dropped. Then I looked at Belle who gave me an excited smile. I have a family! I have to meet them.
As Snape said this, a psychotic looking lady laughed her maniac laugh. Her skin very pale, eyes with dark bags under, cheeks hollow and sucked in, her hair all curly and tangled. I recognised who she was. It was Bellatrix Lestrange. I knew that she was the most loyal follower if dark lord, she worshipped him. I also knew that she had a love for killing and torturing every human and non human that wasn't pureblood. I had to get out of here.
"Please. Listen to me once. Please." Harry begged.
He is still standing behind me. He tugs my hair and pulls my head behind. I yelp.
"Mr Malfoy, I need to know every detail that you can share. Even the tiniest bit that doesn't seem important to you. Start from the beginning if you would." Said Blackburn.
I do what I want
"I don't know." I say and walk towards the fireplace next to mother.
He knows for a fact that Granger and Weasley are not at home or Potter wouldn't have come in like this in front of them. Something warms inside Draco knowing that Potter can be his complete self in every way in front of Draco that he cannot in front of his best friends who had gone through so much together. Draco smiles.
"What do you need?" Harry asked, one hand pinching and bruising his waist brutally, making Draco moan in pain.
"That is so Slytherin. No wonder she is so good with Slytherins." I said.
"Well, yes, but no one gets rich doing a job." Cormac replied.
Harry took a sharp breath. Out of all things, he didn't expect this request. He was a killer amongst them both. Draco couldn't kill to save his life. He wasn't able to do it with Dumbledore. Even with the dark mark, he was lighter between them both. And Harry wanted it to be that way.
It's funny that with the amount of self hatred filled in Draco, he still wants to look perfect. He grooms himself everytime like he is going on the ramp to walk and lures people with his seductiveness and still think he's ugly. But Harry has also noticed how chipper he has become now while grooming himself, while getting ready. Harry can feel the self hatred reducing and Harry knows he won't stop until it completely vanishes, until Harry wins and the hatred stops. The loud music that Draco still refers to as art is definitely half the reason Draco always takes so much time because he spends half the time on his toes dancing on the screaming loud music and stops in between to apply the products on his face and hair. Like right now he is dancing on this song called Bad Girl, singing on the top of his lungs and only stopping in between a little to get the proper waves on his hair. As adorable as this habbit is, it also means Harry has to wait for at least another thirty minutes before Draco will be done. Harry groans again and falls face first, sideways on the bed dramatically. Draco, the bastard, laughs. Harry feels two hands picking him up to sit straight and he glares at Draco's amused face but then smiles as Draco kisses his cheeks and blushes. He stands, holds Draco's hips and with a crack, apparates them both to Diagon Alley.
"Better. But I still can't leave him alone for more than a few minutes. It's like he's afraid that I'll vanish and leave him alone forever. His abuse was a secret for so long and to have it outed this way, I don't even know how to fix it. He thought I would be mad at him because he kept it a secret. Then he thought I would leave him after I'm done with him the way the others did. I feel like I'm still reassuring him that I won't just dump him and leave. Ginny and Tori say it's because he's never had the kind of intimacy that we have. Astoria says it's closeness and intimacy he wants, because he's never gotten it much. Not because he's afraid that I'll leave. But to tell you the truth, I love the clinginess. It just, feels good to be needed this way, like I am his everything." Harry smiles.
"Listen, Cormac, I'm staying here for you. I've a meeting with investors for you. Do something."
"Its not much but this is the best I could manage to get for you." I say.
"They're on to you, Potter. They have you as the main suspect for all the killings. You go after them and that gives them a way to pull you in."
"Think you can just walk away, you scum? He sneers and pushes Malfoy to the wall. The Slytherins get up. Harry closes his hands in fists and looks at Malfoy. Malfoy doesn't look scared. In fact, he lookes amused as if he is being entertained. "What are you looking at like that?" The Ravenclaw says and gets his wand out.
"Because I consent to be and because I want to be. Not because he's making me be. What relevance is this to the case?" Draco snaps. A year ago, this all talk about consent would've been bullshit for him. But now, he believes. He does.
"I try."
Ginny was worried about something but she didn't show. She left Hermione and Ron alone and went out. It was almost one a.m. and she was wandering around the castle. She banged on to Theo.
"Not to ruin it." Draco replies weakly. His breathing is faster and his lips are quivering.
"That was amazing, pet. You were wonderful." Potter praises.
I am the worst human being to exist. Ugh.
"Mr Neville Longbottom! 6 NEWTS and a researching job in Herbology." Neville went on the stage. McGonagall gave him a hug amd his certificate. She also told him that she thinks he's a very brave and kind man, and that she's very proud of him.
Draco's POV
Potter accio's the leash and with a smile, attaches it on the collar. He climbs off the bed, Draco does the same but then Potter clicks his tongue when Draco gets ready to stand. Draco stares at him blankly.
"Darien, they are your friends mostly. You say no to them." Draco tells Darien after Potter leaves.
"Because I didn't tell you. I didn't want you to know." Draco replies, his voice still small.
"Please let me cum. Please." Draco begs.
"You love me?" Harry froze and asked.
Draco went to protest again and stopped.
"Harry." Says Hermione. "Being feminine and female are two very different things. Being feminine is having personality of what the society says is feminine like wearing skirts and heels. Being female, that's biology. Draco is a man who is feminine, but a man he is."
"Alright. You're too cute to say no. Come on top." Harry finally gives him the permission and it was worth it.
"Alright then. I'll try to make it quick." Says Harry.
"What is wrong with us?" Draco asks his mother and his mother cuckles.
She should be. Harry is an idiot. A huge idiot. He didn't even realised what he did and Draco listened to him. Without complaining. Harry took away that small freedom from him. Harry metally slaps himself for it. He has to be better at organising where Draco needs to be free and where held. He sits at the table and rubs his temple. This has already been a long day and it hasn't even started yet.
He looks at Draco who is biting his lip, clearly struggling to stop his moaning. Harry takes out the panties from Draco's ankles, rolls it into a bundle and places it on Draco's mouth. Draco takes the sign and opens up like a good boy. Harry pushes the knickers in Draco's mouth, using it as a gag and then bends to kiss Draco's thighs again. He slowly sucks the skin into his mouth and bites on to the soft flesh. He licks the bite mark and then goes forward, near Draco's V and sucks another mark, claiming his pet. He looks at Draco, his eyes tight shut and fists clenched and toes curled, his erection standing proud. Harry smiles and gives his erection a long lone lick and Draco rolls his head behind, barely managing to suppress a moan. Harry gives Draco's cock another long lick.
Im sorry. IF??
"You want that music playing in the morning, don't you? Even now when I play that instrumental music. I'm so sorry Draco. You can play that music in the morning. You can play whatever you want to. You might belong to me but you belong to yourself first. You must understand that. If there is something you want to do, then you do it. Within reasons of course."
Something is seriously wrong with you both.
"Harry, please. Please please let me cum. Please please please. Ngh!"
"Bend down and hold your ankles." Potter orders.
"Look, I don't know who is it that you're meeting, but I'm really worried." Pansy holds her wrist. "I don't want a third cut here. Okay?"
"My boy. My dear boy. My sweet child." Nana Paki strokes his hair.
"Its crazy how you can look at me like that and still not be in love with me." Christian says a bit breathless.
Eveta opens the door for Harry and pushes him to sit on one of the small tables they placed for customers to sit.
"I apologise to have barged in you home this way. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much." Little grass says to Harry in a shaky voice.
"They left after waiting." Draco replies, not looking at him.
"Draco? What else?" Harry asks.
"Cum with me Draco, cum now." Says Harry as he feel his balls tighten and the orgasm rips through.
"Yeah." Harry blushed.
Draco looks at them. Two senior aurors along with Robards and oh, look. The minister him self. Great! Draco looks at them unamused.
Draco can feel his cheeks burn out. He's grateful that his pale face is all pink and flushed due to the throatfucking so Potter can't see how much he blushes. Potter puts his hand on Draco's erection and smirks. Draco knows that smirk. He swallows.
"I know. And I appreciate it but she has to understand she can't keep pushing people like that.  Don't you remember how frustrated you were when she kept forcing you to talk about Fred when you weren't ready to talk about it?" Harry then turns to Hermione. "Or when you weren't ready to talk about your parents."
Draco looks back at Harry with a pout.
Zabini groaned.
"Oh. Sorry. My wards. Only allowing mails from very specific people." Draco explained.
"It's a girl, so Aurora." Dravo smiles.
"Nothing to worry about at the moment pet." Potter said and kissed his cheek. "Now go. They must be waiting." He smiled.
"Hey yourself." Draco smiles.
"You had that chance once." Draco grits his teeth.
Ginny looks at Luna then Neville. They nod at her.
Draco's POV
"What is it?" Draco asks.
Please don't talk like it's already over please please please. I can't live without you all. You all are my family. You'll are the only true friends I've ever had. I won't be able to live like this. Please!
"Granger, you're brilliant but my solicitors or no less. They worked too damn well to keep my father out of azkaban and made them give the punishment to exhile in France. Which by the way, was playing at my father's hand. He's living the best life there. Malfoy name might be ruined here but in France, it is stronger than it ever was here." Draco says trying to remain calm.
"Fuck yeah. Come on darling. Suck me like you always do." McLaggen says and Harry sees red.
PADFOOT!
"Fine. Send her in."
"They're as smart as a troll, Draco. They even look so. I need a smart, witty, manly man with class, you know. I have one life, darling. How am I supposed to ruin it by marrying someone not worth it?"
"Are you okay?" Tori asks Draco as she hugs him.
Draco and Harry went shopping along with Teddy. Draco got a few stares from people who didn't believe Draco was on the site if light, but no one did anything as Harry was besides him, holding hands at all time. They carried Teddy turn by turn. Once they were done shopping for school, they went back to Nott Manor to dump all the stuff. Draco begged Pansy and Theo to babysit Teddy while he went to muggle London with Harry. When Pansy agreed, the apparated.
"Yes my Buzzy Bee." I kiss the top of her head.
"I was just dancing." Draco replies.
He walked out in the garden and with his magic, digs some holes in the grounds. Within minutes, the holes are filled with wooden toys and broken China. He covers the holes and plants few flowers on them. He goes back to the living room and kisses Draco. He sits back on the chair and relaxes.
"You're amazing." Harry says with guilt rotting in his stomach. Ginny smiles.
"Slytherins." McGonagall shakes her head.
Children do grow up so fast. You will always be our baby prongs, no matter what.
The club is small with mostly everyone above 30. There are some people in their twenties as well. The lights are bright. Not dark in usual clubs and there's a girl singing on the stage wearing a cowboy hat. Draco and Harry wait at the door. The pub, not club, is relatively small. Suddenly there are people clapping and the host appears on the stage. She's a woman in her eaely 40s but extremely beautiful with tanned skin and brown long hair with bangs, wearing a beautiful red full length cocktail dress.
Harry doesn't want to. He wants to be here, hug Malfoy, whisper sweet phrases just like Greengrass and Nott are but he finds himself leaving the room. Hermione follows him. They go in Harry's room. Hermione says she's calling Ron and sends a patronus. Ron is there within minutes. Hermione explains everything she saw. They look at Harry. Harry finally explains them everything.
His mother's favourite place in the entire Manor. There are chairs and a coffee table there made of wood as dark as possible. All his mother's favourite flowers are here. Narcissus, dahlias, daisies, pansies, peace lilies, white roses, purple orchids and bluebells. All of them are muggle flowers. Along with some Touch Me Nots, all spices and some other plants. There are enchantments that saves the plants and flowers from excessive rain. It saves the flowers, not him. He sits down on the grass, dirtying his robes with mud, staring at the beautiful narcissus flowers. And he finally cries. He sits there sobbing, his shoulders jerking and he has trouble breathing. He doesn't stop when he feels someone sit down a little behind him and holds him in warm embrace. It's his aunt, he recognises. She's crying as well, holding him. He let's her hold him. He doesn't have it in him to stop her, to get away. So he just sits there, crying away what's left of him. The rain covers the tears he can't stop. He's so tired and all he wants to do is sleep. He wants to just sleep. Forever. He gets up and leaves for his room, leaving his aunt behind.
Harry sits on the barstool as he waits for Draco to make his decision. There's a faint rosy blush on Draco's cheeks which makes the glitter on his cheek more effective.
"That's no problem Malfoy. I'll give you all the pain you want. I would love to have you bounded and gagged and at my mercy while I claim you as mine. Its pain you want I'll give it to you and only the best kind. I'll give you the pain but I'll never give you the abuse. I promise you that. I'll only hurt you in the best possible ways." Potter says.
Third person pov
"Yes."
"Will you marry someone you want to or someone your mother would choose?" Healer Jacobs asked.
I felt my cheeks blushed. I wasn't ready for Ginny joking about it. We had our time but after the war, it didn't feel right. Ginny felt it too so we went our separate ways. We still are pretty close as friends.
"Tell me you'll save her. She, Harry she's gone through so much that even I didn't go through. Promise me you'll save her. Please." Draco started sobbing again.
"Touch yourself." Harry said and watched as Draco's eyes widened as his hand automatically went to his cock. "Stroke that pretty cock of yours slowly." Harry smiled.
"Thank you Mr Olivander. You can go now. Minister, I'd like to calm upon Miss Luna Lovegood."
Draco walked into New Beginnings, a sanctuary for old people who's kids left them there and a place to give to orphans and those abused. It had been years since his mother had died but he still had his nanny. His nanny was the only thing resembling to a parent figure he had left after both his parents had died. His father had died after five years of azkaban, his mother followed soon, dying away with heartbreak. Draco and his mother were spared at the ministry after a hefty fine they had to pay. With Draco saving Harry Potter's life and being a spy for Fleur Weasley had made it very easy to escape prison. It was a shock for everyone to know that Draco had been working with Fleur after letting in the death-eaters in Hogwarts, when one fateful night, Fleur had found him wasting away in muggle London. His father wasn't given that consideration and was destined to Dementors kiss after enduring their torture for five years. He entered his Nan's room, her son had placed her in there, not wanting to take care of her and not letting Draco keep her as well.
Draco can feel his body melting, like lava flowing in his blood. He is being played around with casually and he loves every second of it. Its taking him all of his strength to hold back and not cum.
Everyday I Love You- Boyzone
Treat you better- shawn mendes
"It doesn't fucking matter Nevil! What matters is her life is in danger and she needs to fucking leave!" I half shout.
"You are my everything Bee. And you're everything I'll ever need. I was afraid a little because I started to fall for you but for you, I'm willing to get disowned by my family. All I want is you." He said and left a sob.
Good. Make sure you don't talk about us at all. And be safe.
Draco's eyes widen and his white tail wags. After a moment's hesitation, he nods.
"Are you blackmailing me?" Elizabeth sneers.
Luna looks at me and gets down from her bed. She walks towards me and sits besides me. She smiles her warm smile and holds my hand.
Harry kissed Draco on the top of his head and lifted one hand to pet his hair.
"We are ever so grateful to you, Potter." Says a blonde girl who is holding a brunette girl younger than them.
"Dreadful. I don't know how I'll manage. To stay in a place I helped ruin. Both my homes ruined."
Now is not the time to back out Wormtail! This prank will be beautifully executed!
Breakfast pasts with Harry staring at the blond and uneventful. Malfoy doesn't even look at him.
"Well, that gives us good amount time for me to ravish you once at least." Harry smirks.
"Oh, how adorable!" Luna coos.
"Nightmare. He won't wake up." Harry manages to say, his voice craking.
"Crawl." He says, bends down, kisses Draco on the top of his head and starts to walk. He doesn't have to look back to check if Draco will obey. He knows Draco will. He still looks back and smiles to see Draco on his hands and knees, his face still pink and Harry can make out the blush apart from being flushed with all the crying. Harry doesn't wipe his tears or the snot running on his face. Harry wants to see it. He loves how gorgeous Draco looks. And even after kneeling for about thirty minutes on the hard floor, he still crawls with elegance. Harry leads them to his bedroom, which Harry is determined to make it their bedroom. He sits on the bed, facing the windows and Draco obediently kneels before him.
"I do."
Belle, Harry, Ron and Blaise laughed and talked about most unnecessary things. At one point they were talking about how specific and similar Blaise's and Harry's features were. Both had dark skin, Blaise eyes were sapphire blue while Harry's eyes were emerald green. Belle was a complete goofball, she made the most obscene comments that turned things awkward and laughed about it. Blaise couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy everytime Belle laughed pushing her head back. Belle couldn't help blush everytime Blaise smiled and played with his thumbs whenever he spoke. Ron and Hermione loved each other so much that every once a while they checked on each other and smiled.
"Palms open." Harry says and Draco does it.
"I don't think he will. He's just, he's just like a ragdoll right now. He won't talk. He won't smile. He won't, he won't do anything and let people drag him around. He gets up because he is told to get up by Mrs Parkinson or the Slytherins. He eats because he's made to. He's just lifeless, Ginny."
"I do."
"It is." Potter replies.
Draco did something that wasn't probably wise, but then again, when had Draco made decisions that well helped him. He laughed. He looked at the men and laughed at their face.
Harry gives his lips a peck and Draco's smile increases tenfold.
Draco flinches as Darien throws the cup on the wall.
"Oh yes, you should be able to see them, you filthy death-eater scum." Someone yells from behind.
"You know, I think Potter grew up to be like Lupin." Belle stated. Draco gave him a questioning look. "Well, Andromeda told us how they all were. She knew the marauders personally. Potter is kind and caring but at the same time he's fucking sassy. He grew up to be Lupin." Belle explained.
"Okay, Potter. What is it? Something's on your mind and it is more than my nightmare." Draco pulls him out lf his musings.
"Neville, what was Traditionalism Massacre?" Harry asks.
"So any chance that I can be one of those specific people?" Charlie asks with a small smile.
I close the book and tuck it it again. I feel the tears go down my cheeks again. Diana isn't here so I'm cry louder. How do I fucking stop all this?
Theo did the same. Blaise was still there. He shut the door behind him. He held her hand and led her to bed. He sat her down then sat besides her.
"Did you leave her or she left you?" Draco asked.
Harry grinned and pulled Draco for a kiss.
Slowly everyone giggled except Weasley. He got up with a scowl. Everyone was suddenly quite and I started preparing myself for a punch. He walked towards me and stood in front of me. I knew Belle had my back and she had her wand ready. To my surprise, Weasley put his hand out for a handshake. I froze.
"This is not a decision you take on a wimp, Draco. This is something we have to sit and discuss." Potter says.
Potters smiles. His smile is so open, huge and vibrant, Draco can't help but return it.
"You can call me that whenever you want. Can I call you kitten and pet in front of others?"Harry asks.
[Some paragraphs are directly taken from the books so that the timing and everything that was happening could match.]
"Bee. My Buzzy Bee!" I managed to say with cracked voice. I  wiped her tears and kissed her forehead. "My Bee. My Bee." I repeated and hugged her tight.
"Did you talk to them this time?"
"I did not know that!" Theo's jaw dropped. "That means Teddy wouldn't have happened if Sirius was alive!"
"This says that you no longer have the authority to the riches or any of the properties. I've left the property in Germany for you along with some money. This also says that if you come anywhere near Teddy or Belle, you will be sent to Azkaban. Whether you do anything or not to them. An exhile is being set which means you can not enter UK after two weeks. I will not have you anywhere near my family. So unless you want to go to azkaban, I suggest you leave. Right now." I demand.
Draco can feel his cock twitch at the evil smirk Potter gives and oh fuck, he wants this. He wants to be used, wants to be made to do things and he wants the humiliation. He's had the romance for so long now that he craves the humiliation. He craves the disdain and the disrespect and the humiliation like he felt when Potter made him rut the tub like an animal. He can feel his face and neck burn off as the drool starts dripping down his tongue and runs through his chest and stomach.
Now was the chance of Slytherins.
Harry laughs. He kisses Draco slowly then deepens the kiss. Draco, as always, like Harry's good boy, surrenders to the kiss. He then pulls away to call Kreacher and give him some galleons. Telling kreacher to bring as many 'blood lollies' as he can in the galleons, which might be like five boxes full, Harry turns to take some of the chocolate chip pancakes in a fork and offers it to Draco. Draco gives an uneasy look to the pancake but then sighs and opens his mouth to take the bite. And the bite he takes makes Harry extremely happy.
"You stopped reading as well, didn't you?"
Potter looks blissed out with his orgasm. Draco is extremely turned on and hard as rock. Spit and cum drools down his chin and his hair sticks out on all places. He must be a sight to be seen.
"It'll be alright, Andromeda. We've just gone through a war. Give him time."
"With me you can Draco. You know that. I need you to tell me if something I said or did upsets you. I don't want to upset you."
"I wanted to tell you, my love. I did. But your mother requested me not to tell you. It wasn't my secret to tell, Draco." Harry said.
"People, I've known Draco from the worst of times, times when all hope was lost. I consider myself lucky to have known Draco when I did. He's been my family since the first time we spoke and I love him. I knew Draco loved Harry even before he knew himself. Me and Pansy had a bet about how long it will take for him to figure out. Obviously I won the bet. Harry has helped Draco grow and recover in so many ways and gave him so much love, Draco thought he'd never get and that he didn't deserve it. Harry, I can only thank you for making my brother's life brighter and happier. I'm in debt to you for that. But if you ever hurt him, you will have to disappear from this world because if I find you, I will kill you with my bare hands. And no magic of this world will be able to protect you. With that done, I wish you both the best in life and all the happiness." After Belle was done, there was a lot of dancing and drinking. Well, everyone drank except Ginny and Pansy. The wedding was beautiful.
"You feel guilty."
"That sounds nice. I'm not much in to pain. I won't mind a little bit here and there but I'd rather be without it mostly." Tori replies.
Harry Potter has always been powerful. He was powerful as a child to kill the Dark Lord. He was powerful to run an army. He was powerful to kill Voldemort again. He was powerful to finish an entire war. And now, he is more powerfull than ever.
Draco maintains his shield for two seconds but as soon as he's behind the manor's closed door, he can't help it. He lets out a wretched sob. He sits down on the floor, hugging his knees close to his chest and he cries. He cries so loud with heavy sobs, cries like he hasn't in a while. He feels someone near him, sitting beside him, pulling him close. He smells his mother's perfume as she holds him close, comforting him, runing her hands on his back. He cries.
Draco goes crimson. Beg for it. He really does want it, it's just that when he really is having sex, like he is now, it becomes difficult to ask for what he wants. He used to ignore what he wanted when he used to get abused but that's because he knew there was no point. This, it's different. Christian made him do it sometimes as well. This sets his skin on fire, he so wants it.
Huh. Harry is getting a lot of information today that he didn't know. Then he smirks.
Draco looks at him in disdain.
"Get the bath ready then please, pet. I'll quickly rinse off the blood in the shower till then." Harry says and then does just that.
"Hmm." Harry replied.
Yes Bee. Our parent's have chosen our fate. Least we can do is make sure you're alright.
Millicent nods with a small smile.
The courtroom filled in whispers so loud that the minister had to yell at them to remain quiet. And so Potter told them. He told them how Draco refused to give him up at the Manor. Which Draco did. He remembers standing there, looking in Potter's green eyes. He would know Potter anywhere. And he did refuses to give Potter up. He knew a definite yes or no would result in him dead. They needed time to escape and the best Draco could do to give them that time was to say he can't be sure. And just like he knew, Potter's luck worked and they escaped. The rest of the trial went in a blur.
"No Ron. You don't know how it was for him in the start of the relationship. You don't know how he was. You didn't see the scars on his body. I have. There was barely any place for the skin to show. His body was so full of scars and he would wear glamour all day. And he wouldn't heal them in the start because it would be like just getting rid of evidence. This has helped me heal him. Emotionally and physically." Harry cuts him off. "They deserve what they got."
"Yes, gran. I know. Her clothes are so skimpy or tight, she might as well not wear anything at all. She can't speak a sentence without cursing, she calls me a pussy and you a hippocrate, which by the way, you are. She has a very strong personality and she is extremely independent and opiniated. She's perfect. And I love her. I'm sorry Gran."
"What are you doing?" I asked her. She slowly turned and looked at me scared. She's the girl I took to hospital wing. The poor girl was shivering. "Who is behind you?"
"Are you going to do something about them attacking Draco and his friends?" Harry asked seriously.
"Its Greengrass, Potter. And her name is Astoria. Also, are you really just finding this out?" Malfoy asks.
Potter smiles and gives his hole one lick, then two, then many more until the outside of Draco's hole is covered in spit. He then breeches Draco's hole and pushes his tongue past the walls, inside Draco's hole. Pleasure. So much pleasure. That's all Draco can feel. He can hear his wanton moans and whimpers. He can feel his orgasm building slowly. Doesn't take much as he hasn't cum in a while now. And it's even more torturous when he watches, hears and feels his master cum again and again in sweet release while he doesn't get the privilege. Oh Salazar, his Master is gifted in the tongue skills. Draco's breathing is hard and laboured, he swallows and lets out a groan as he feels Potter twist his nipple as he rims the life out of Draco. Close. Draco is close but not close enough to beg yet. Potter then inserts one finger along with his tongue and Draco loses it.
"Where are you going?" Pansy asks.
"Good. You deserve it, the happy feelings. And the sexy ones."
"Oh you cowboys are going to love this one. Join my boy here in the chorus. We all know the song." Iris smiles at the crowd. Harry is positive whatever song they're gonna sing, he doesn't know. Draco starts strumming and slowly starts singing.
"Alright." Draco agrees quietly, blushing, and feels a flutter in his stomach when Potter smiles at him.
"Times up." Blaise yelled.
"Nope." Neville replies.
"Kiss me, Potter." Draco commands and Harry obeys, grinning.
Ginny and Theo had a good lunch and dessert. After roaming a little bit, they left for Hogwarts. As soon as they reached Hogwarts, they found out what happened. They went to meet Draco. Draco was asleep so Ginny left for her dorm. Theo turned to Harry.
"Yes Master."
"And you, Draco? That's not all you are. You an an individual as well. What about what you want?"
"Neville. Go to hell, you cunt." Pansy says coldly and walks out of the garden.
*Bodily fluids*
Draco raises an eyebrow.
We both wear our clothes. Just as I'm about to say bye, he leans in and whispers in my ear.
They walk out of the library towards the common room amd the dorm. Draco ignores Granger's looks. He's been ignoring it since yesterday. She can't seem to hold her tears in whenever she sees Draco and this makes Draco want to punch himself. They reach outside Draco's dorm and Draco turns to kiss McLaggen. McLaggen gets his hands to Draco's arse, squeezes it and Draco moans. He hastily opens the door and they shift towards the bed, barely managing not falling. Lips don't leave each other and both are opening each other's robes.
"He doesn't." Draco frowned. "He doesn't even know me."
"Slytherins look after their own. At least they do in Hogwarts."
"Who sent it?" Nam asked.
Theo stood up.
"I love you too." Harry finally breathes.
Shit! Bee are you there? Did you read this?
"And I missed you." Teddy mumbles in between kisses.
"How did you find out? No one knew about that?"
"Give Neville and Hagrid our love okay?" Hermione said to the kids.
"I'd rather have you." Ralph mumbles sleepily.
"Are you okay?" I ask her gently.
Draco looked back down at the letter. Harry walked towards Draco and sat in front of him.
"Everybody does. He's Draco afterall. But I do believe you. You and him, it was inevitable anyways. The way you were obsessed with him. I'm not a least bit surprised that you both ended up together."
Draco blushed so hard and didn't look up at all.
"Father has kept cake in the fridge. Shall we eat?" Darien asks and smiles as Narcissa smiles.
"I'll take the whole bottle please." Weasley cuts of Draco's mocking and snaps the wine from his hand. Draco snorts in amusement.
"Same thing. What is wrong with you Gryffindors? I mean there was this one when I was thirteen. Pureblood. He was in seventh year. My first I tell you. And obviously I was too young to understand that that fucker was after my money but I did understand later and asked him to fuck off after few hexes. I mean he still has that 'pig' forever stamped on his arse, I'm sure. Then there was this red head fucker who is way to old for me. But I'm 15 and he's hot and when he gets what he wants and then he says "let's wait till your of age, Draco." I mean he didn't wait before fucking me but then he wants to wait, the fucking red wanker.
"I know that, Potter. Pandas are extremely dangerous animals when they aren't cuddly. Their claws are like of tigers and they can harm and eat us when angry. Don't you know that?"
"Well if you really like her so much then you should ask her out." Ginny said giving a weak smile.
"Get back yo-" Whatever Lucius was saying is stopped as Draco slaps Lucius on his face. Hard. Just the way Lucius used to slap him. And now Draco can't stop. He slaps again and again and a few more times until father's lips are slit open and bleeding. His pale face, now red all over due to the slaps and Draco, he loves the satisfaction he's feeling.  He hears his father shout which pisses Draco off and he feels his own crackle around him and he feels as his magic takes away his father's voice. He has never felt his magic this way before. And it's not just his magic. He can feel Potter's as well. He's harnessing Potter's magic with his own and at this moment, he feels powerful. He isn't the powerless little child and teenager his father used and abused repeatedly, all his life. Right now, it's him who has the power. And its his father who is weak, powerless. And it's glorious. His father's eyes widening at this powerful display and the fear on his face is cherry on the top.  He doesn't know from where the baseball bat came in his hand but now there it is. And he hears the beautiful melody of the crack that sounds so loud when he raises the baseball bat and it meets his father's face, hard. He doesn't remember much after that. He remembers vaguely that he might have hit his father a lot with that bat. He doesn't remember how he reached to the couch he's sitting on and he definitely doesn't remember how that blanket came on him. It's like that time he smashed the bathroom after Potter insisted that he can say no in Hogwarts. He still doesn't remember much of that day as well. And he knows that he won't remember much of today as well.
"It's a panda." Harry says and Draco rolls his eyes.
"I won't give up. I'm not as big of an imbecile as Darien. But I'll talk to you, Draco. I will."
"I think I'll just take half of my stuff. We can go shopping in Paris. The fashion there is brilliant. Can we go shopping there, Potter?" Draco asks.
"I'm my mother's son, aunt Andromeda. I will not do that to Teddy. Whether he has you and Potter or not."
"Madam Undersecretary." Harry greats.
"These filth is not your family!" She yelled. "That blood traitors Tonks was not family. You're a pureblood."
"Did the bastard say anything?" Ron asked.
"Teddy would happen anyway. Tonks had agreed to be their surrogate. They were gonna try after the war. If Sirius was alive then Teddy would be living with Remus and Sirius. Ginny explained. "Draco knows this I'm sure."
And so Draco said. He told how he treated the Slytherins and Draco and how he was incompetent and how occlumency and legilimency is not something an amature person should teach. He told about Storm casting legilimence on him without consent and that it was so terrible that if Draco wasn't an occlumence, it would have hurt badly and the memories would've been affected and ruined and maybe lost forever.
"Well, its you he'll be spending his life with. If he didn't run away in first few months of dating you, I'm sure he's definitely not going to run away now." Pansy laughed.
- Bee
"I missed you." James kisses him again.
"Every single one that exists in the books! I learnt them even before the year started. I already know all the defence spells that are going to be taught to me next year and even more that are not taught to us." Belle says.
School uniform
"You know how girls are taught to walk on heels with balancing books? That were walking classes. I'll never put my Teddy through that shit." Draco said.
MOONY! COME AND GET YOUR FUCKING DOG OUT OF HERE! HE IS SABOTAGING MY DATE!
Sexy clothing (private)Sexy clothing
I relate to Aurora because all I wanna do in this fucking lecture is sleep
"You know what. These people, they are just as awful. They treated you the way children never should be treated. Just like you're healing all my scars, I want to heal yours." Draco explains.
"Pansy Parkinson? Really?" Harry laughed as they walked in the streets of diagon.
Shut up
Draco closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath. He hasn't been here an hour and he's already ao tired. It feels like it's been such a long day. Draco calls in Mimi to set up his silk sheets and bed. He sits on his bed as soon as he is done and watches as Mimi casts undetectable extension charm on his closet and sets his stuff how he likes it organised. Draco pulls out a photo frame out of the trunk. It's silver with beautiful flowers. There's a picture of Draco in his fourth year with his mother and Dally. They're both smiling at Dally's small form. She's in a bundle of blankets his mother is holding her delicately. Dally hasn't any hair in the picture. She does now. Beautiful white blond hair just like his. This is his favourite picture. Picture of him, hia mother and his new born sister before the dark lord came and fucked it all up. They had kept her birth a secret. Draco doesn't know the child well. She's four now and Draco has met her many times secretly. He places the photo frame on his bedside table takes out his book and sits on the bed to read.
"I don't have the energy."
Hera sat on the park bench with Draco, waiting in anticipation for Ralph. Draco excused himself to get cotton candy, one of the muggle sweets he loved. Hera looked ahead and stood up, looking at Ralph smiling at her happily. She smiled back . He walked towards Hera and bent his knees a little, to be in height with Hera.
He doubts something. Narcissa is sure. He won't be asking such stupid questions if it weren't for that.
It's dark when Draco opens his eyes with a yawn. He just stays there still with his eyes open. Potter is still there, sitting, petting Nura with one hand and Draco with other. Draco smiles. His body feels relaxed and he's feeling weirdly emotional. He can barely stop himself as a tear flows his eyes and he sniffs. He watches Potter jerk and then bend down to give Draco a small kiss. And that does it. Draco pushes himself in Potter's lap and holds him tight as the tears flow and he sobs. And this irritates him because he doesn't even know what's wrong. He's not upset but he feels so emotional. And he's grateful that Potter does nothing but hold him through it. So does Nura.
"Really? Why?"
"That's great, Ginn! What are you worried about?" Harry asked.
As I was eating, a small origami swan came and sat at my lap. I opened the paper and read what's inside.
More than half of the term had passed. Belle and Blaise were in a relationship. It is the longest they've ever been in. Draco and Harry are closer than ever. Draco is an excellent father and Teddy loves his dad. Draco only had three trigger accidents and things have gotten a lot better. He has started eating healthy amounts of food as well. Luna and Pansy are so in love. Pansy has never been more comfortable to have a penis. Luna is so supportive of her. Ginny and Theo teach people in Hogwarts sign language together. Within a month of dating, Theo confessed his love. Ginny said she loves him back. Neville and Hannah are strong together. Neville is the bravest and kindest man she's ever met. Hermione is working hard to get in the ministry and Ron is the most supportive boyfriend she could ever ask for. Ron's insecurities have almost vanished. He is proud of his girlfriend's achievements. They plan to go and find Hermione's parents, once their school is over.
Zabini laughed.
"Ah. The sleeping beauty is awake." Head auror Robards speak.
Professor McGonagall gives me Teddy and he snuggles in my chest and yawns. He falls asleep on my chest immediately.
"Draco, Bellatrix was always a psychopath. Violence and bloodshed was always her idea of fun. I remember how me and Sirius were always talking about running away from them to live a life without their blood purity bullshit. Sirius did run away. After everything that happened,  I refused to believe that Sirius would betray James and Lily. I was glad when I found out Sirius was innocent. Cissy and I were always close. It was one of the reasons Bella hated me. But then I started to like Edward. Cissy was fine with it until she met your father. Thats when our differences started. I knew that I had no one in that family. I only had Cissy and Sirius. Then I had no one. When I found out about you, I wanted to take you away from them because I knew they would turn you into twisted terrorists like them. When I read Harry's letter, Draco, you have no idea how happy I was knowing you didn't go on their footsteps. I'm so proud of you kids." Andromeda said and proceeded to kiss mine and Belle's forehead.
I enter the kitchen to see Neville and Belle talking. Neville is mixing something and Belle is drinking coffee. They look at me and smile. I smile back.
Draco's POV
Harry gives Draco's lips a small kiss and then manhandles Draco so that he is on his back with his knees bent up and arms up like that of a pup's.
"We can't tell Draco about this. But we have to save Narcissa. Draco doesn't talk much about her but when he does, he always says he misses her. I'd like if he could get back with her." Harry says.
"Sweet Godric. Someone's hungry." McLaggen says, places his hand over Draco's and pulls it futher to his cock.
"It screams Gryffindor!"
"Oh my boy, we missed you. Come up here! It's been so many months since Neptune has had you up on stage. Come on." She looks delighted to have Draco.
"The snake calls you pretty human." Harry says instead and watches blush bloom in Draco's cheeks.
"Harry, are you okay?" Hermione asks.
Harry couldn't help but feel mixed emotions. He wanted to hex the shit out of that cow Bulstrode but he even wanted to laugh at Draco. His situation and his behavior was funny. Slughorn gave Harry antidote and Harry force fed it to Draco. Slowly Draco calmed down and it was like he woke up from a nap. He suddenly became aware that he was no longer in the party and looked at Slughorn and Harry stunned.
"Maybe because of the confidentiality clause. We did keep it a secret."
"Lets leave." Harry said and gave Draco another peck on his lips. He could see the purple Hickey getting dark on Draco's neck. He caught Draco's hand and their fingers intertwined. They left the room holding hands. Everyone smiled at them and the game was over. They all got a lot more drunk, had some food, got more drunk. During this entire time, Draco and Harry kept stealing kisses. So did Neville and Hannah. Blaise and Belle kept their distance but blushed. After a couple more hours they all passed out on the floor of the living room.
"Look at this. Cute." He laughs and turns at the Slytherins as if he's sharing a joke. He turns back to the Ravenclaw and smirks. "Do it. You know you want to." He says slowly. He steps forward which makes the Ravenclaw's wand poke his neck. "Do it. You know the words. A little murmur of words, a little flick of the wand. A stunner or an unforgivable. Do it. You know you want to." Malfoy says
"Looks different from here."
Hairaan- Urdu for worried, upset, stressed
Harry nodded at the waiter as the waiter looked back at him to confirm what Draco said. As soon as Harry nodded, the waiter nodded back and left with their orders.
Harry can't stop thinking about it. 'When you've been getting this treatment all your life, you kind of get addicted to it.' It's what Malfoy had said. Has he been hurting his whole life? Harry didn't even want to think what had happened with Malfoy to make him believe his consent wasn't important. But he did. He thought about what happened with him that made him believe that whether he said yes or no was of no relevance. Something had happened that made Malfoy believe he can't say no. Almost like, he doesn't has the right to say no, or like he doesn't has the permission. Harry can't pay attention on the class. And how can he, when his mind is still stuck on the blond who is missing the clas? Who Harry gave an excuse for.
"Get over with it." Spine sobs.
"Of course, love. Whatever you want." Harry smiles.
"Every Christmas eve, my group has dinner together. And I'm not cancelling Lavie's first Christmas eve with us for a bunch of ginger heads who want to meet golden boy's boyfriend." Draco states.
Third person pov
"Thank you Sev. Thank you for looking after me." I smile at him.
"Nicholas." Harry greeted.
"Take off the shorts." Potter says and Draco scrambles to follow the order. "Good boy."
Pansy can feel the excitement in her heart as she and Smith walk side by side. Smith had offered her to walk down to the floo and apparation point. Spoke to her, asked her if she would come to the party and if she'll go with him. Pansy, was ecstatic.
"Please tell me you're not a Gryffindor."
"Colour?" Harry asks.
Gee chill D. I'm fine guys. I'm fine B thanks for asking. D you have to behave normal in front of them. You live with them. Remember that.
"So you'll let her choose my wedding robes?" Neville asks as he pins her down on bed.
"Don't yell at the love of my life." Draco yelled.
"Harry don't worry. About the money as well. I'll take care of it." Theo assured.
"Slut, my whore, derogatory remarks like that." Harry explains.
"You want me to cast this spell on you?" Harry asks quietly.
Malfoy slowly unbuttons his shirt and throws it on the floor. He gives a bit of a show of turning around, put his thumbs under his leggings and pulls it down, slowly removing it. He isn't wearing lace this time. Plain cotton knickers but they're wine red. He looks gorgeous. He makes a show of bending down and pulling out some clothes from his trunk, slowly walks his way into the bathroom. Harry doesn't even bother asking this time. He throws himself on the bed and curses himself and his completely hard cock.
"Nana Paki!" He breathes and all but sprints towards her.
"Okay sir, thank you." Pansy smirks and leaves, unaware of the whole conversation that happens after.
"Now, Draco." Harry turned and looked at Draco. He repeated in soft but firm tone that brooked no argument. Draco nodded and left.
Belle's POV
"Yes Sir." I end up saying. Well, fuck. I say and run to my room.
"I want to." Draco's silent admission made a beat skip in Harry's heart. "Not all the time, but at least when we're alone."
"Mother." Cormac gave a nervous chuckle. "Wants me to get married."
Harry looks back at the beautiful white and blue mist of the dragon. The dragon walks towards Harry and sits at his feet with his head low. It reminds Harry of how beautifully Draco submits to him. How he kneels at Harry's feet and reads his novels while listening to music while Harry does his research. It reminds Harry of how he kneels at breakfast and let's Harry feed him. It reminds Harry of how Draco lets Harry take charge and listens like the good boy he is. He is Harry's most prized possession. And Harry feels like crying.
"What are you doing?" I demand.
"And you? Why aren't you married yet?" Pansy asked.
"So Augusta Longbottom is a supremist who wants you to marry someone who is a closeted supremist instead of us?" Pansy sneered.
"I have feelings for Malfoy." He says.
"Thanks Mione. I was so gonna do this to prank you but but thats out of the  window now." Ron said and everyone laughed even more.
"Rope bondage?"
"Our families taught the traditions and rituals important to keep magic alive and we were still fighting on taking away the abused muggleborns from their parents. The hatred for muggles started because at that time, abuse for muggleborns by their families was extremely common. The dark and light families have always been together Harry. We still celebrate our traditions and follow the rituals. There is magic extremely dark, I know, but many of that dark magic is just magic. Like light magic. I can tell you so many blood magic rituals that will cure terminal magic illnesses that light magic can't cure. Light and dark magic, both can be used for both good and bad. But Dumbledore spread this line into good and evil. When purebloods started to put pressure into saving the muggleborns, Dumbledore lead a massacre. In 1963, almost all pureblood families were wiped out. Only 34 families remained which kept dying and now we're just 28.
And Draco moaned. A long and deep moan.
"Thanks for telling me. I'll get you pretty flowers and buy you everything you want to eat. And if you be a good boy and behave the entire date I'm sure you'll get so much more." Harry smirked.
"We do it tomorrow. We get one Gryffindor, one Ravenclaw and one Hufflepuff child. Nev. Talk to Hannah. We'll need a Hufflepuff with us if we are doing this." Ginny says.
"Draco?" Harry calls him out.
Harry wakes up in the dead of the night, his neck stiff and back hurting from sleeping in the sitting position, holding his boyfriend. He feels Draco's even breathing but he knows Draco is awake. He knows that Draco is staring emptily out of the window. His hands are losely holding Harry's arms. Harry runs his hands on Draco's back, trying to soothe him. Draco responds by shifting his hands and locking them around Harry's neck, nudging even more closer than it is possible. Harry kisses the back of Draco's head slowly as he keeps his hand running up snd down Draco's back while other hand holds his waist.
"Well. If you say so."
"Even you called me Malfoy. That was really hot though." Draco blushed.
"But Room of Requirement was Neville's idea." I say.
"Wait!" Says Blaise. "Tell the patronus to note where is the closest he can get to Draco. We start our search from there."
"Waiting for you." Harry replies, his smile dripping honey.
Draco won't spell it out that this person was Harry. That it was Harry Draco was in love with before he met Darien. That when Harry was there, in the manor for Draco to identify, suddenly it all came crashing down and Draco realised that he'd rather die than give Harry up. It was sick and twisted time, that war. And they were wrapped tight in the middle of it, the ones who went through the most. The ones for who the war never stopped.
"No fucking way. You know I don't sleep with anyone. I just fuck." I remind him.
"You as well." Cormac says, his face impassive and leaves. He holds himself until he's home and then he falls down, unable to control his tears.
"What was that?" Mili asked.
"Very good. Five points to Hufflepuff." Storm smiled delighted. "Now occlumency is raising a wall on your mind and hiding everything behind that wall. The stronger the wall, the easier to hide everything."
"I feel like a teenager with all the playing and laughing." Narcissa says and Nick chuckles.
"We'll do lay down again." Harry says.
Harry had a feeling that Charlie and Draco had a past. Maybe Charlie was Draco's ex? But how would that even work? Charlie lives in Romania. And Charlie is way too old. He's at least eleven years older than them. He watches as Draco comes out of the bathroom and storms off out of the room and Harry is just, very confused.
Draco nuzzles himself deeper on Theo's neck and Theo wraps his arm around Draco. One hand petting Draco's hair. Suddenly Granger and Daphne emerge the room and ask if everything is okay. Theo gives Daphne a mournful look.
"Shush you. Tori will go bonkers if you wear this dress. Your boobs are good enough for it."
"Theo?" I call him. He looks up from his cookbook and raises an eyebrow. "Theo don't you think Luna is cute? She's adorable. She's so self aware and she's so happy with herself. She's such a goofball."
"You are. Do help me to cook while you stay, please. Draco doesn't do it at all." Harry said.

"Hi beautiful." Christian greets Draco.
others)Video (recordings of you)
"You said they were non negotiable." Draco said.
"Do you wanna get out of here?" Harry asks as he watches Weaslette.
"Thought so." Draco smiles.
Treats. Draco wants treats. He looks at Potter with narrow eyes. He gives another hissy meow and looks at the paper bag that Potter is catching that has his treats, longingly.
"You're so important to me, Rosie. What if we ruin it and forever hate each other?" Scorpius asks. "I'd rather have you as a friend forever than loose you if we broke up."
Draco feels the burn of tears in his eyes. He tries to blink them away but those stubnorn fuckers still flow. Silently, but they flow. Potter's hold on him tightens and he hugs him, holds him like Draco is a treasure to be cherished and a sob escapes Draco's throat. Potter walks him towards his bed, lays him down, lays besides him and makes Draco curl around him. Draco falls asleep listening to silent breaths of Harry Potter. The person Draco now belongs to.
I'm wheezing!
"Did you finally loose your v-card?" She smirks.
Two of the people got confused at Draco's reaction where as the other two just got angrier.
I try to say something through the gag but I'm not able to. He removes his hands.
"Quiet, Millie. Stand here, I'll get a carriage. I don't know if you're up for apparation or floo." Pansy tells Millie and leaves her to search for a carriage.
I looked at all the delicious food kept in front of me. Looking at that food my apatite died even more. I knew what was going to happen. How could I eat knowing my schoolmates will be starved. Snape stood to give a speech.
"Failed attempts. Because I couldn't kill to save my life. I'm a lot of things but a murderer is not one of them." Draco replies.
"Thanks." She smiles. "Since when did Draco start listening to instrumental music in the mornings?"
He places Draco on the bed gently and kisses him softly on his lips. He pours some water in the glass on the bedside table and makes Draco sip it slowly. Draco gives a content sigh and smiles at Harry gratefully. Harry places the glass aside and works on Draco's clothes. He carries Draco to the bathroom and helped him in to the bathtub. He switches the tap on for hot water, and the magical house gives it. The house even gives some salves and pain potions. Harry let's Draco check on the potions and it is pain potion. Draco drinks it. He gives another content sigh as the warm water starts to fill and the pain subsides. He looks so tired and Harry's heart aches.
He can't even cry. No tears come out. He's empty. Finished. There's nothing left of him. And this is the last he'll ever see his mother again. He barely hears the speeches Nana Paki and his friends make. Theo is here as well along with Millie to pay his last respects. So is Potter and his Aunt Andromeda. He gives one last kiss to his mother's forehead and closes the casket. The elves gently place the casket in the grave. Draco bends down to pick up some of the black mud and drops it on the coffin. He watches silently as everyone else does so as well. He watches as the elves cover the coffin and bury his mother. He walks and places some narcissus flowers on the grave.
"And what did you do?" Draco questioned.
And Rose does. With one last smack, she turns and she leaves.
Thanks Moony
"Why would that scare you?" I ask.
"Harry, tell him it's a filthy habit and he shouldn't smoke." Hermione demanded.
I go to my dorm room and lock the door. I put silencing charms and wards. I pull out the practice doll and practice stunning spells, hexes and jinxes. After a while I'm tired and hungry but I don't feel like eating. I need something to cheer me up. My patronus. I think about the happy times I spent in the muggle world with my parents and cast a charm. A beautiful silver mare comes out of my wand. My patronus is a beautiful mare. She looks at me and puts her face in front of me. I can't touch it obviously but looking at here makes me feel so much better.
Draco is sure the smile on his face would be the answer enough. It was.
Draco manages to gets his breath in control and fakes a smile.
"If you want to cum, you rut on the tub like the filthy pet you are or you don't cum at all. The choice is yours. Or, you can safe word and I'll let you toss yourself."
He was one of the kids along with Potter because of who my father went to azkaban. Bee is right. Don't underestimate him. Bee. Speak to them today.
"Aaaaa! Oh my god! Maleficent!" Belle screamed. A jet black owl came and sat on her shoulder and started nibbling her ear in affection. "Oh my god I'm so happy to see you my baby." She gave a soft sob. My stomach churned as I was reminded of Hedwig. "This is amazing guys. Thank you so much." She said and walked towards her arts table. She picked up a photoframe kept on a table and silently began to sob.
Draco sits on his bed besides Darien who has his nose in his case files. Draco knows it's a lost cause. Darien won't look at him once. Draco bites his lip and picks up the book from his night stand, Potter's book. He doesn't know why he still has it, why he keeps it on his night stand. He just holds it, doesn't open it, doesn't read. Just holds it.
Harry felt Draco tensed and saw his fists clench behind his back. The last thing he wanted was to cause more distress to his pet. He immediately cast silencing charms back on them and watched gleefully as Uncle Vernon silently screamed in pain through the cruciartus curse. He kept playing with Draco's hair to distract him from whatever was happening behind him. He felt strange satisfaction watching the fear in their  eyes, watching them squirm and tortured. This apparantly was one of the best gifts, Draco could've given him. He saw as uncle Vernon's chair slipped and he fell down head first along with the chair and laughed at the tears. Who was crying now huh? Who was being abused now? Look how the tables have turned. He then looked straight in the eyes of his blonde aunt and saw the silent scream leave her body as she felt the pain. He saw the tears, the struggle, and smiled.
"I can't go to a movie with you! I have a boyfriend." Millicent laughs.
"What about the other one?" Theo asked.
"Because you'd look beautiful doing it and if you be a good boy then you will be rewarded."
- Bee
"You're beautiful." Potter says and Draco's face fell. He looks away.
I call out Blaise and go to find Potter. I have to tell him about the elder wand. I have to make sure he's fine and he doesn't do anything stupid as to give himself. We have no idea where Bee is but I will search her once I find Potter. When we reach room of Requirement we see the trio go in. Just as we were about to go in Vincent comes along with us. We can't shove him off. He has seen the trio. I try to warn Potter but he's so fucking oblivious. Vincent being the daft he is managed to set the entire room in cursed fire. I'm going to die! I cry. I can't help but feel all the emotions. I can't die without seeing Belle. I need to see her. Potter saves me. I breathe relief. A death-eater comes to kill me and I try to save myself saying I'm with them. Weasley sees me and gives me a fucking punch. I deserved that. Belle. I've got to find Belle.
"Yes. They all were people who did things to Draco and so many other children that shouldn't be forgiven." Harry replied firmly.
"It's beautiful. How much?"
"Then Slytherin would have gained an amazing wizard. Slytherins are good as well Albus. Not all of them are bad. Look at your father. We both will be proud of you, no matter what." Harry smiled back at him.
"Relax. It's alright. Uh, it, it was my flat." Cormac explains.
She opens her eyes with blurry vision due to tears in her eyes. She looks into those bright blue eyes and then pulls him in for a kiss by pulling him from the collar of his shirt. And she kisses him.
"Are you suggesting we talk about our feelings?" Albus laughs. "Oh, you Gryffindors." Albus laughs as he leaves.
Harry warns him that he's removing the restraints and catches Draco just about he almost falls. He hisses as his freshly caned chest hits Harry's chest along with the clamps. Harry makes him kneel and checks if Draco is too far gone. He is. His eyes are glassy and his face his blissed out. He's in another world and Harry can't control himself any longer. He removes his belt, unzips his jeans and pulls his pants down. His cock bobs right out, standing proud. He can see the lust in Draco's eyes as he takes in the view of Harry's cock.
I go to a toy store that has magic as well as muggle toys. I let Teddy select whatever he wants. He takes stuffed unicorn, monkey, dog, cat, tiger, lion, zebra, elephant. Then he takes a few barbies and ken dolls. Then he takes a car he can drive. He takes blocks and a play kitchen. I take some play food to go with the kitchen and some dinosaurs and a quidditch broom for toddlers.
"Are you sure?"
This is too good to be true. This can't happen in real. Potter's reality will come out. The abuse will come out. He will cross the line.
"It's a surprise, Potter. Letting you know kind of defies the point." Draco replies.
"What are you talking about?" Harry feigned innocence.
"I'm not his slave. Being his slave would mean that he has complete and total control over my life. Which he doesn't. I still live my life they way I want to. I'm his submissive but also his boyfriend." Draco answers relatively calm as he doesn't feel.
"Not anymore, you don't." Lavie laughs and soon enough, everyone else does.
"Mafilda Hopkins." Draco whispers.
Andromeda's eyes turned hard and her smile faltered.
"But it shouldn't be me. So many people, Harry, I was so weak. I couldn't stop them. It never stops. The nightmares don't stop. The pictures. It hurts sometimes so bad even when nothing is happening. When will it stop? When will it stop hurting?" Draco cries.
"Fuck! Harry why would you scare us like that?" Belle asks.
"Would you like to talk about it?"
Speech restrictions (when, what, to whom)
I bit my lip. Fuck. I can say no. I can say I don't get owned. I can say i don't need a dominant. But fuck.
"Within ten minutes, I can throw you back in where you belong." Darien barely manages his temper. "Fuck restaurant, you won't be able to sell Street food."
"By prolong it, what do you mean?" Blackburn asked.
Harry hears Andromeda sniff. He turns around to see Andromeda's eyes are full of tears. Harry awkwardly places one hand on her shoulder and she pulls Harry in for a hug as she cries on his shoulder. After a few minutes, she releases him, some instrument is still playing a tune in Draco's room.
"How long will you be able to hold?" Potter asks as he slaps the balls a bit more harder. "Remember whore, you don't have the permission to cum." Potter says in such a threatening voice.
"Change the music, Malfoy." Harry said again, firmly.
"No sir, but I know how to sell."
"See you." Potter whispers and leaves the bus.
"Do you think there are any pancakes left?" Draco asks.
Belle was walking silently as Blaise held her hand while walking. Belle flinched and looked at him stunned. Blaise smirked and walked ahead, her hand still in his. Belle just followed him wide eyed.
"What spells you can do?" Theo asks her.
______________________________________
Draco fixes his top with a charm. He fixes his hair, wipes the tears and fixes his face with a few charms he's so used to. Used to them like he's used to breathing. He walks towards the common room and runs inside the dorm. He walks into the bathroom and stands in front of the mirror, removes his top and stares in front of him. The glamour charm slowly fades away only to reveal all the wounds, the scar, the dark mark, the ugliness he sees when he looks himself in the mirror and the ugly but real Draco Malfoy stares back. The reflection mocks at him. Shows him the truth. Shows him the past, he can never walk away from. He hates it. Can't stand it anymore. He hates it and he hates himself and he hates everyone and he hates everything and he HATES HIMSELF!
Ron blushed as red as his hair. Everyone stood up and cheered. Professor McGonagall gave him his graduation certificate and a proud hug. "You have a special knack of making people happy. Always embrace that."
"Tell one embarrassing thing about yourself." Robards says.
"Write to Ginny, would you? Ask her to stay here as well. Tori would like that." Draco requests.
"Make them stop." Draco mumbles between his sobbing. "Make them stop. They're so many, Harry, it hurts. Make them stop."
a part of his mind asks him.
"Open your eyes, my love." Harry says softly.
"Difficult my ass Draco. Its a fucking disorder. You need help!" I yell.
"Nura keeps calling Draco pretty human and is now challenging me for Draco's affection." Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry wakes up early in the morning with Draco in his arms, well, more like half on top of him. Draco's upper chest and cheek rested on Harry's chest. He smiled. He could feel Draco's breath slow and even on his chest. He shifted his gaze to the room, still very much ruined from last night. Not as ruined as his bed though. He still has to punish Draco for that. But maybe, he can let this slide this time. Would it be wise? What if Draco thinks Harry will be lenient next time as well and misbehave? Maybe he can just give Draco a reprimand and strict warning. Yes. That's what he will do. He accio's his wand and concentrates. Through sheer will, he gets the room back to its original state. Everything, except the bed. The bed is damaged beyond repair.
"Lay down." Harry says. "This is lay down." He talks slowly as if explaining to a child.
"Harry please. Please let me go. This is wrong. This is so wrong." Draco sobs.
"Let's show Harry his room." Belle said breaking out of the hug.
Potter is nowhere to be seen. I just sit in front of the gate. I don't know what to do anymore. Belle, she's unconscious. I don't know how are my friends. I look up and I see the entire army coming outside. Voldemort is leading them. Potter is dead! After everything we did. After everything we've been through. He died. My Belle, my friends, all that sacrifices, for nothing.
He takes drag after drag, listening to the music that is too loud and too heavy to be listening in the morning. He stares out at the view outside his window with his tired eyes. The sun was rising over the black lake. Its rays shining light over the black lake and the part of the forbidden forest that can be seen. He breaths.
Looks like Ron has been talking. Harry doesn't blame him. He was pretty shook after he knew everything Draco has been through. It's no wonder he went to Molly for motherly comfort and reassurance. He was about to say something to Bill when a curse breaker called him out and pointed towards the study. Harry looked towards the closed doors, they had dark grey smoke coming out of the gaps. Harry ran towards the study along with the other curse breakers and pushed the door open and a busrt of grey smoke came out. Few portions of the study were on fire. Draco was sitting in the middle of the study on the floor holding a miniature crystal peacock in his hands, his gazed focused on it. The huge Mahogany desk was on fire along with whatever was on top of it. The chairs too and were the curtains and some stacks of papers. Harry slowly walks towards him while the curse breakers try to squish the fire.
Harry apparated in front of the Malfoy Manor gates. The gates white and huge with large cursive M on both the gates making the already elegant gates look even more elegant. Harry stands there nervous. It's the first time they are bringing Teddy in the Manor. The manor is nothing it looked like a month ago. Zabini had taken charge and got best curse breakers from Italy to purge the house of all dark magic. All the dark artifacts were put in Lucius's vaults in Gringots. The Manor was much brighter and light after getting rid of all dark magic. But this was the place he and Ron were almost killed. Hermione was tortured. Where so many people were kidnapped, enslaved, tortured and killed. A place where people who were responsible for Teddy being a war orphan once resided.
Harry walks over to the bed and sits down. He casts a tempus to keep the record of timings. He sits there the entire time and his eyes does not leave Draco. He watches as Draco's fists clench and unclench repeatedly. He casts a tempus again to see two minutes have passed. He'll wait another three. The next three minutes pass excruciatingly slow and he's sure it's a lot more slower for Draco. As soon as the three minutes are done, Harry walks towards Draco immediately and pulls him from the wall. The galleon falls down on the floor and Harry ignores it.
"*beeeeeez*, I heard professor *beeeez* has been hanging around here, around you." The lady scoffed.
Harry walked over to the portrait to look at her. He looked behind her frame, lifting it alittle and to see just a wall behind her.
Harry blushed and looked away.
".....do you have a last name?" She asked warily.
Draco and Snape managed to pull Harry out before the flames could get him, but unfortunately the smoke had its effect and Harry soon found himself unconscious again.
"Of course mate!" They said in unison.
"NOW!" He yelled.
"We'll I planned to go to madam Ravenclaws portrait, and try to find some information." Harry explained.
They stopped in front of the sleeping woman. Harry waited a second before clearing his throat loudly enough to wake the woman. Madam Ravenclaw yawned and stretched as she was awoken.
"Yeah, but you are still our friend, and we will help you any way we can."
"I do not need your damn help woman." He roared. Madeline flinched before looking at him.
"I'm sorry Cedric." He sighed. Cedric smiled at Harry warmly.
Dumbledore hesitantly took the steps down to find a small door at the bottom of the staircase. He slowly grabbed the handle and opened the door. One by one, they all filled the small room covered in dust.
"Yeah Malfoy, bugger off." Fred said.
'What have I gotten myself into.'
Harry, Draco, Snape, and the twins followed behind Albus out of his office and down the hall.
"....Harry??" Draco yelled as he tried to open it. The door wouldn't budge.
"Your family, Favorite food, place, what you were like in school before coming here...I want to get to know you." Draco said lightly as he kissed Harry's forehead. Harry looked in thought.
"Hagrid, do you know how to get to the lake?" Harry asked him. Hagrid appeared to be in thought.
"We are not harming my mate." Harry said firmly as he headed up to his room. The twins looked at eachother and shrugged before going to their rooms.
"Wicked." Fred and George said.
Its's fine though, they will always be together. Won't they?
Harry barely missed the sound of a low growl as he got off.
"I am glad to catch you before class started, I hope you didnt forget our date tonight." He smiled. Madeline reached up and kissed the tip of his nose.
"I am sorry Draco-" Draco pulled Harry up with a glare.
"I don't know guys-"
"Wha-...what are you?" Draco looked down at Harry smirking.
".......Madeline..........MADELINE!"
"I say we inform Professor Dumbledore, maybe he'll keep it as a memento of his dear friend." Snape said.
"Good day to fly, ey?" Draco called with a smile as Harry laughed at Draco.
"What your tongue potter, or you just might have us all killed." He said annoyed.
"You risked your life for a game!?!" Draco snarled. Harry felt defensive.
"Very funny. I knew you wouldn't believe me." Harry said irritated.
Harry woke up with a gasp and sat up, or at least tried to sit up. He felt arms holding onto him and someone's face in his neck.
"What can I elp ya with Professor, Arry?" Hagrid asked. Snape glanced at Harry before speaking.
"Thank god, I worried you hit your head." Draco said lightly as he held onto Harry.
"I do not understand sir." Harry said confused.
"I love you too." He managed to say before falling asleep.
Draco made a look of disgust.
"Nightshade...." Harry looked around the grass. He spotted it and took it.
"The tell me why you are exploring a missing person's case, Specifically Madeline Croft." Snape reached into his desk and pulled out a file and threw it onto the desk, Her picture shown on the top cover, where she was laughing and smiling. Harry froze up and he looked away from the picture, feeling a sense of guilt.
Harry looked confused as him and the twins waited until they were sure they were safe.
"Three things, I can do this." He said encouragingly to himself.
Harry blushed. He opened and closed his mouth. Malfoy raised an elegant eyebrow.
______
"What's there to talk about, he's a ponce." Harry said with bitterness in his tone. The twins looked confused.
"Basically."
"Madeline, I am so so-" Madeline put her lips back to his.
"Well Harry, veelas are beautiful bird like creatures. They posses great power and excellent charm, amongst beautiful wings." Dumbledoor started.
"Blimey Harry, this is a complex potion, where did you find this?" Fred asked reading the paper Harry gave him, George looking over his shoulder.
"What??" The said in unison.
"Night to you as well Harry." She said gently and went to her chambers.
"My my boys, creating a potion, not even knowing what it does? What would your potions master think about this?" Dumbledore asked, appearing next to them.
Fred and George looked at eachother confused, then followed Harry's example and changed.
"Well that was terrifying." Fred said quietly as he took the cloak off them and handed it back to Harry.
"We will talk about this later, preferably after we have your head checked."
".......forbidden magic and how to use it for good...by Madeline Ructure....."  Harry opened it, reading some of the spells and going through the potions.
"BullHog." Draco cut Harry off. Snape came over and put a hand on Draco's shoulder.
"Go!"
"I am sorry sir, it won't happen again." Harry said.
"Well, now that you mention it, there was a beautiful Lake Rowena and her would often visit. Rowena adored her so, she was heartbroken and never visited the lake after Madeline disappeared." Dumbledore frowned.
"Yes!" The twins said high fiving eachother. Harry chuckled at their childishness.
"I love you too Ed." She said as they kissed. There was a mix in the scene, the colors mixing together as if a brush swirled the image like paint. It cleared up and It showed Madeline and a pale, angry Professor Rimplestein arguing in her secret room. Harry noticed he had bags under his eyes and a distant look in his eyes. His hair was no longer slicked back and it looked as if he had not brushed his hair in weeks.
"Besides, we ready think you're mental for going out with Malfoy." George add, a smile to lighten the mood.
"Common Harry, are you going to let Malfoy dictate what you do now?"
"So did I." Harry muttered and went into the changing room, the twins right behind him.
"I apologize for disturbing you madam Ravenclaw, but I have some questions I would like to ask you." Harry said quietly a she lit up his wand. The twins followed suit as the woman raised an eyebrow.
"Harry?" Harry heard a gentle voice speak to him. Harry slowly lifted his head to see a transparent image of Madeline Croft. She was smiling down gently at him.
Draco leaned into Harry, sniffing his neck.
Harry slowly unlatched from Draco and snuck out of bed. He tip toed towards the door and turned back to make sure Draco was asleep. He let out a breath of relief as he headed out of the room.
"........what is going on..." He saw a lanky man with black hair and a beard.
"Sleep." He said to Harry. Harry slightly tensed.
Harry checked the hour glass on Snape's desk and internally groaned.
"Are you sure about this Harry?" Fred asked, checking the list.
"I was lucky enough to speak with Professor Slughorn about the subject and came to find that one of our lovely Professors at this school written a certain book to inform on the subject, more specifically on how to create them." Tom said stepping foreward. Edward stepped back.
"Madeline." Harry heard From Edward before the image distorted and Harry's eyes began to shut.
"Why do you care, we are strangers remember!" Harry argued back. Draco growled, which made Harry remember the situation.
"Yeah, beautiful!" Harry called over the wind.
"Edward please-" Harry heard a smack and then things falling. He started going down the stairs, keeping a hand on the wall.
"...you mean Hagrid." Harry said.
Harry found himself in the room again.
"Well, Ron got car sick on our way to Australia, you know how he can be."
“It’s your plan Hermione, you invite whoever you like.” Draco smiled.
“I’m surprised you didn’t use his real description for her,” Harry added.
“Draco dear, how are you?” Molly smiled and opened her arms wide for a hug, which Draco happily accepted even though he was shocked at how happy she was to see him. A Weasley happy to see a Malfoy? Hell must’ve frozen over.
"What! Why?"
“That’s me sir!” Pansy beamed.
Love you all xxx
Pansy just rolled her eyes, “You worry too much.”
“It’s no problem Ginny, come to me if you need help with anything.”
“They would have done no such thing Draco. They would have accepted your apology with open arms. No matter the situation, the Weasley’s are always caring people. George barely leaves his room; he goes to work but no ones seen him on the shop floor since before the war. Charlie and Bill visit every so often. But Percy cut all ties with his family again. He feel’s responsible for Fred’s death, he was there when he was killed after all. I heard him sobbing to Molly before he left, thinks it’s his fault and that he could’ve stopped it.”
“We turn Draco into a girl.” Hermione said proudly.
“Okay,” Draco sighed “I’m in.”
“About what he did?”
“You were at the funeral?” Hermione looked at Draco, shocked.
“Please, call me Molly,” She smiled as she headed back down the stairs.
"We're having money troubles Pans," Draco said as he sat on the bed, "We may have been pardoned but the ministry had all our accounts at Gringotts frozen. We get the fund back when I finish my eighth year. We're selling what we can until we can have it back."
“why does it have to start with a D? Why can’t it be something like Iris?”
“Gra- Hermione, I don’t suppose you’d want to talk soon. There are some things I need to tell you.” Draco held his arms behind his back and crossed his fingers.
“I’m doing well thank you Mrs Weasley, it’s a lovely house you have here.” Draco replied moving away from the smaller woman.
“I’m proud of you.” Pansy smiled at Draco.
“That’s a good idea, but what? I’m not being called Daisy! I refuse.”
“Oh, right okay. Are you coming George?”
“Nothing, I just asked her when she was free to talk and she said now. But don’t let me hold you back. Go home without me.”
“Money is great but there’s actually something else.” She smiled back putting another green item in the basket.
Once they sat at their table, Hermione took their drink orders and assured them she’d return with them in a few minutes.
After this was potions. Professor Slughorn as always didn't really teach anything and we had to do all our potions ourselves. He just asked few questions and gave like two three tips. We were brewing Veritaserum today. I noticed a change though. Professors were no longer allowed to give points to muggleborns and half-bloods. Only purebloods were to be given points. On top of that, purebloods who are not Slytherin can't get more than five points while Slytherins definitely must get more than five points. Slughorn looked upset. Well, the whole class did. This was bullshit. But Slughorn did try and cheer us up by giving us all as many compliments as he could. He was a collector but he wasn't a bad guy. One of the handful Slytherins I liked.
"Sorry." Harry says sheepishly and then snorts again.
"In between this, you casted few unforgivables yourself. You used Imperious Cursenon Katie Bell and Madam Rosmereta."
"That is great." Harry tells awkwardly. "Why are you here?"
"We have a wedding to plan!" Andromeda grins.
"I did what was best for me at that time." Andromeda replies.
"After you left, I kept going in that park thinking you might come back. But you never did. I got married, had kids, and even they left me and went away in the U.S.like you. I'll wait for you in the same place. I've grown old, Ralph, please don't get disappointed looking at me if I'm not what you imagined anymore. And if you do get disappointed, then please hide it." Hera remembered the words she had written in reply to Ralph.
That makes sense. I have to stop doubting them. But its an old habit.
"And will you try to mend things with your aunt?"
He feels Potter's fingers threading through his hair. It calms him a little but after the day he had yesterday, he wants to stay alone just with Potter.  He hears someone clear their throat.
Since when??
"Do you want me to go further?" Harry asks.
"Eltanin. Fancy as you. It's perfect. Let's take them back to the dorms."
"Well then that's settled. Welcome back Mr Malfoy." She smiles at me.
"Potter, I appreciate what you're doing. We all do. But he doesn't want to talk to you. You can't tell him that he can say no and then force him your way. How is he to believe you then?" " Zabini says.
"One more word about Draco and I promise you Ronald that you won't stay alive to make a sound let alone say another word. I have told you time and again and I'm repeating it now for the last time. Get the fuck out if my life, you selfish, fame digging arseholes. Get out! You made me leave Draco! Forced me to be with that slut sister of yours. Forced me to leave the man I'm still so madly in love with. You forced me into this miserable, painful life while I could have been happily married already with him. And now, I left you. I threw you all out of my life the way you made me throw him out. Get out!" Harry yelled so loud. "OUT!"
“Well nearly everything. I still think you can be a git sometimes.” Draco smiled which made Ron laugh, “But I am truly sorry, and I can’t thank you enough for offering to help me.”
“What do you mean?”
“Shout if you want some tea!” Molly manged to add before the door shut behind her.
“We all know refusing would have got you killed. You took the option that would keep you alive through the war.”
“You think so?”
“We all know that you have a crush on Potter, but you Malfoy’s have a strange thing about emotions. So, what you thought was hatred was definitely love.” Pansy laughed.
I'm so sorry it's been so long since an update things have been pretty hectic the past few months. Sadly I am going to pause writing for now, I will come back and carry the story on as soon as possible but for now, it's going to bed. I really love the idea and I don't want it to go to waste, I might even end up re-writing it and starting again when I have the chance. I definitely owe you some reasons as to why there have been no recent updates, so here they are:
family as well. We can say Draco’s mother sent him, well her, to live with the Weasley’s because she didn’t want you near your father.” Hermione added
The group finally arrived on the platform 10 minutes before the train was supposed to leave.
Sorry it's been so long. I started University last month and then my laptop broke. Everything has just been a complete mess. Anyway, enjoy this long awaited chapter.
The night carried on as normal, Hermione brought them their food and drinks and let them be, not wanting to trouble the group. As the trio were ready leave, Draco approached his classmate.
“Really? I was joking”
“Oh god I didn’t even think. I hope he’s doing okay.” Pansy confessed.
“Thank you, Ginny.” Draco hugged the young girl, “Did McGonagall reply to the letter we sent?”
“Luna?”
Draco slowly opened the door, “Hi George, I was wondering if I could have a quick word?”
“I have a feeling she might take you up on that offer.” Pansy laughed.
A shocked Ron poked his head round the door, “Draco Malfoy! Being nice! Never thought I’d see the day.”
“Your father is an arse that’s why.” Pansy answered making them laugh.
“Dahlia is a nice one.”
“I wanna come in too.” Ginny added joining Hermione by the door.
Last start up chapter before the story really begins. I'm so excited!
“It’s red! I have never worn red in my life. I will never wear red ever!
Ron chuckled, “That sounded dirty,”
Draco rolled his eyes at his father. Lucius had become a shell of the man he was before. In front of people he tried to seem just as he used to, he held his head high and glared at people he deemed 'lower' than himself. But when he was in the isolation of his own home, with only his wife and son around, Lucius was a wreck. He constantly apologised to his wife for bringing a murder into their family home and for turning Draco into a copy of himself. Draco's constant shunning of his father and avoidance of him made Lucius fall deeper into a pit of depression and despair. If the pair ever did speak, it would always be sharp, snide comment on younger Malfoys part.
Here have a present … It's a Ginny and Draco friendship
Draco had many sleepless nights thinking about people would treat him when they returned. He had never wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps and join the Death Eaters, he had never wanted to fight for Voldemort's cause. But never mind what he didn't want, he did. Draco linked himself to the wrong thing. Even though the Malfoy's had been pardoned, it wasn't something that would be easily forgotten. No one would ever be able to forget the boy who was ordered to kill Dumbledore. No one would ever forget the boy who had immediately ran to his parents call when Harry Potter was supposedly dead. No one would ever be able to erase the image of the Dark Lord embracing the boy on his way back to the Death Eaters. It was something Draco would have to prepare for. He would lay awake for hours staring at the scar on his left arm that would be a constant reminder of his mistakes.
“You know you could go for him now.” Pansy said as they sat down.
Molly took the young boy up a couple of flights upstairs, “Just the room at the end there.”
“Yeah Pansy’s flower name situation isn’t working.”
They made their way up to Draco's room, and passed Narcissa on the way.
“We could always call you Dracoina”
“Do I get paid?” Ginny joked.
The door opened to reveal a grinning Pansy, “It worked, but he’s nervous. He said he doesn’t ‘look right’ whatever that means. But I’d get with him if he wasn’t, you know, Draco”
“Name it! Oh Merlin, they have silver too!” Draco grabbed Ginny again, “Talk and walk my dear ginger one.”
“I know it’s meant to be flowers, but what about Destiny.”
“Now is not the time Ron!” Hermione snapped at him, she turned back to Draco, “Now drink the damn thing!”
“Know what?” Draco asked, he knew what was coming.
“I never understood why my father hated the Weasley’s so much. They are some of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure to meet.” Draco sighed.
"Surely they can't do that to you! They pardoned you but they’re still punishing you."
You have yet to answer the letter I sent to you about returning to Hogwarts for an eighth year. I do hope you consider returning to Hogwarts for another year. It would help make things feel normal again after everything you delt with during the war. It would also be nice to see you again Potter. I would love to have a catch up with you sometime, I think it would do us both some good. You might not have responded to my letter but there is still a place waiting for you here at Hogwarts, there always will be. I hope to see you in the Great Hall.
“I’ve never been to muggle London; I don’t feel as safe as everyone said I would.” Pansy replied, “I mean those muggles can’t figure out how to wear jeans properly. Do they not have belts in the muggle world?”
Ginny laughed at Draco’s comment. She had never seen his so laid back and free. She had never seen him have fun before. It was weird. Nice, but weird.
“We were but your father is annoying me, and frankly I can’t take much more of his whining tonight. If he’s not careful I’ll be hexing him far into next month.” She shouted back which had the duo rolling on Draco’s bed laughing.
Draco’s head perked up, “Is George in?”
“I’m glad to be of service.” George saluted which made Draco laugh.
“Danica is cute.”
“Oh, so him rejecting your friendship first year definitely had nothing to do with it.” Pansy laughed.
“But why not? It’s the most stunning dress in this shop!”
“It’s too risky. If they say no, I’m screwed. The only person who still like me out of my old school friends is Pansy. I haven’t seen Blaise since we were in the room of Requirement. Goyle died, no one has seen Crabbe or his family since the war so they’re probably dead to.”
“The other side of the shop. They have a whole section that’s just different greens.”
“What’s wrong with the name Daisy?”
“I forgot about that! Well it will have to follow the family’s trend of using astrological names.” Draco sighed.
“Which means you can do this!” Hermione said, “Right so here is the plan”
“I’m a very well-kept secret. Mother knew that when the time came our father would try and push us to join the death eaters. She wanted one child that would have a respectively normal life. She sent me to live with some friends my mother had on the Isle of Man, she had to make sure father didn’t know who they were and with them being half-bloods she knew he wouldn’t. I was home-schooled my whole life. The family I was with would send letters to the school each year asking what I needed to be taught.”
“I knew you weren’t dumb enough to go to Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade where you would be recognised, the smart decision is muggle London. Plus, I heard Malfoy’s screams from outside the shop.” She laughed.
“I know how that feels.”
“Can I come in?” Hermione asked.
The owl happily took the letter and flew back out the window. Harry reached under his bed and pulled out his old Hogwarts case, it still had all his Gryffindor uniform in it. He knew it was going to be hard going back to a place now filled with bad memories, but it was better than sitting in this flat for the rest of time.
I am so sorry it's been so long! I had so many uni assignments that needed doing, then I had a break from everything. Enjoy the chapter!
Draco stared at her wide eyed with his eyebrows raised, “Pansy Parkinson hoping Harry Potter is doing okay. Wow I never thought I’d see the day.”
“Thank you. And you must be Pansy.” She then threw her arms round Pansy, who had never been happier to receive such a loving hug.
“I’m nothing like my brother Potter, I would like you to remember that!”
“No Hermione!”
Harry was trapped. He was trapped in his own thoughts. No matter how many times part of him called out to check on friends or to leave the small flat he lived in, the dark thoughts that seemed to be controlling every part of his being overpowered them. So, there he stayed in his bed, only leaving to go toilet or the odd shower and occasionally some food and drink. Harry was stuck and he knew it, which only made him more stuck because he didn’t know how to get out of it.
“Say no more. I’ll help. Don’t tell anyone but I’m a sucker for romance. I used to secretly watch muggle romance films when I was younger.” Draco laughed, “So who is it?”
“About what who did? You need to be specific here, I don’t know much about the war.”
Pansy shut the door on them, she opened it again a few seconds later nodding.
At 9am on the 1st of September, an owl started to peck at Harry’s window. Harry reluctantly got out of bed and opened the curtains. His heart began to ache when he saw the owl, part of him still expected Hedwig to turn up unexpectedly. He constantly hoped that the snowy owl would have been rescued by some muggles and set free when she recovered. Harry opened the window for the owl and let it into his room. The owl dropped the letter it was carrying onto the bed and then sat on Harry’s desk waiting for attention. Harry pulled out some old owl treats he still had and fed the bird, for the first time in a while Harry smiled. He sat on his bed and the owl flew and sat on the pillows next to him. He recognised the handwriting on the front straight away.
Draco smiled at her, “Of course, there’s more than enough room.”
“Yep that’s me Mrs Weasley. Its lovely to meet you.”
“Yes, she did. She understands and is happy to go along with the plan.” Pansy added.
“I can hear you Pansy!” A voice that definitely didn’t sound like Draco shouted.
“Draco you look gorgeous!” Ginny gasped, “Floaty black dresses suit you.”
“Pansy darling, are you alright? You look very pale.” Narcissa smiled as the young girl clung even closer to her son as a group of teenagers playing loud music pushed past them.
“Ginny what are you doing here?” Ron asked.
“Why you have friends going back? They’re going to be with you every step of the way and so will I. I wouldn’t be surprised if I could convince the others to stand by you as well.”
The first thing Pansy did when they entered Draco's room was throw herself on the bed. Draco laughed at her for the first time in what felt like years.
“I agree.” Ron answered earning him another hit from.
3) My mental health has gone down the drain. Anyone else that's from England will know how much we have been fucked about by our prime minister for the past few months. I won't get into much detail but in short, Christmas was canceled like three days before, we gon put into our third lockdown in January, I haven't been able to go back to my university at all (I came home in October just before our second lockdown) and it was only at the start of this week when I could see all my friends properly.
The four stood around for awhile thinking of names, most of them being turned down straight away.
“Wow, that’s one hell of a story.” Ron smiled, astonished with the amount of creativity the youngest Malfoy had.
A small knock was heard on the other side of the door. It slowly opened to show a smiling Hermione.
“What should we call you?” Hermione asked.
“That even though you were the saviour of the war, even though you wanted to help everyone,” Draco took a deep breath, “You never helped my brother, instead you nearly killed him. And he still went and saved your life. You saved his to return the favour!”
Dear Harry Potter,
Draco and Pansy had met Hermione, Ron and Ginny at The Burrow to make sure their plan wasn’t going to fail. They were currently all arguing in Ginny’s room.
“You didn’t grab your arm once, which means you weren’t nervous.” Pansy smiled.
The pair looked over at Ron and George who had found the only chair in the shop and were starting to fall asleep.
"Can't really blame them for what we did."
“Ophelia!” Draco shouted
“He laughs and smiles!” Ron gasped, “Where’s Draco Malfoy and what have you done with him?”
“About what your brother did? What he was?”
“She’s strong isn’t she,” Draco laughed thinking back to the time she punched him in the face.
“Hello, sorry for the wait I was stuck at a... Malfoy!”
“Is that Harry?” Ron asked, “It is!” He waved to his best friend but received nothing in reply.
“Well I guess she does live here now.” Pansy smiled as she started to walk closer to the large house
Draco smiled. He hadn't seen Pansy for months. He quickly left his room and made his way downstairs. And there she stood in the Malfoy's living room, Draco's best friends. He laughed as she tried to avoid Lucius Malfoys intense glare.
“Did he tell you?” Pansy asked, “I tried to get him to tell be countless times, but he never caved in.”
"Draco!" Pansy smiled and ran to hug her closest friend, "I've missed you. Why didn't you answer my letters? I would have come round sooner but I didn't know how things were going"
“There are! Bloody hell. Maybe ‘mione is right, I should pay attention more” Ron laughed.
“Are Draco and Ginny hugging?” Ron asked shocked, “He does know that I won’t allow him to get with her, no matter how nice he becomes.”
“Sorry, I just never thought you’d come to muggle London,” Hermione laughed to herself, “Hello to you too Pansy, Mrs Malfoy. Well, follow me and I’ll take you to your table.
“ The day before we leave for Hogwarts, come to my house,” She wrote her address on a napkin and handed it to Draco, “Bring Pansy with you, it think I know how to solve your problems.”
Draco shuddered at the thought of those gruelling trials, “We’re living, that’s all that matters. How are you? How’s Potter and the Weasley’s”
“I’ll stay here.” Ron quickly said which made Pansy laugh.
Ginny nodded her head. Draco’s face was blank, she couldn’t tell how he felt. Was he secretly judging her. Was he homophobic? With the upbringing he had, she wouldn’t be surprised if he was.
“Oh no it’s completely fine! I’ll happily tell the world how terrible my father is doing and how my mother is thriving now that she is head of the house. If you ask me, he deserves everything that he’s getting.” Draco confessed to the couple.
“What did she want?” His mother smiled when her son approached.
“Imagine how Potter feels,”
“What are you on about?”
Narcissa shot him a look of pity, “Draco there is nothing to worry about. From what I heard, Hermione is a sweet and forgiving girl,” She reached across the table and held her son’s hand, “You have nothing to fear.”
“Okay but don’t be late back, you know how your father is when he get’s woken abruptly.” Narcissa rolled her eyes at the thought of her husband. “Pansy you are more than welcome to come back to the manor. I brought a muggle video player without Lucius knowing so I can watch muggle movies.”
The duo arrived at the café, quickly ordered a coffee, and sat down. They spoke about things they’d done over the summer and, for the first time ever, Draco Malfoy laughed with Hermione Granger.
Pansy just laughed at the flustered Draco. A small knock came from the compartment door. Draco shot a look at Pansy and stood up to open the door.
Draco panicked and gave Harry a small smile. Did he know? Had something gone wrong? He subconsciously reached for his left arm.
"Stop staring at her you old prick, she doesn't need any grief from you." Draco snapped at his father. Lucius' face dropped and he continued to read the latest copy of the Daily Prophet.
“He would love a visitor.” Molly said as she stood in the doorway holding a tray of freshly made muffins. She placed them on the small table and took Draco’s hand, “I’ll take you to him”
“But it suits your body type. Why do you have a problem with it?”
'If he's like this all the time', she thought, 'I could get along with him'.
“It’s nothing mother, I’m fine.”
“I’ll believe it when I see it.”
Ron burst through the door, “Ophelia is a great name now let’s go its 10:30! Draco you look lovely, now let’s go!”
“It’s a great idea if I do say so myself. We just have to create a backstory and tell Professor McGonagall about it so at least one professor can help us if something goes wrong. Ron we will have to tell your
Pansy looped her arm round Draco’s and took him onto the train. She began talking to Draco about Hogwarts as if he’d, well she’d, never been so they could keep up the façade, but Draco didn’t listen. He was too busy thinking about the one and only Harry Potter, but then again what’s new. Draco finally clocked back into reality when Pansy scared some first years out of a compartment.
He hadn’t seen or heard from anyone since the war ended. If he’d received letters, he hadn’t opened them. He didn’t want anyone’s pity; he didn’t want to answer the Daily Prophets questions. Harry wanted it to be him and himself.
“I said I’d get you a table at one of the most prestigious restaurants London can offer.”
“When she said meet at her house, I thought she meant her own home. Not the Weasley’s” Draco laughed as he and Pansy apparated outside of The Burrow.
“Do you know?” Harry asked.
“That sound like fun, we’ll see you later Draco.” Pansy smiled and automatically clung to Narcissa, still scared of the muggle youth.
“I’m doing well thanks. How is your father doing? I heard he isn’t too god.” Arthur asked.
“Just a second.” A soft voice called from the other side of the door.
“I never knew Malfoy had a sister.” Ginny perked up, excited to carry on the façade.
“Oh please, you’re only mad because you know I’m right!”
“Well you are more than welcome to come here anytime you like, same for you Pansy. And, Draco, if you mother ever wishes to escape your father, she is more than welcome to come over.” Molly smiled.
“She’ll come out of it.” Ron shouted back earning him a slap from his girlfriend.
“Don’t worry about it. I completely understand.” Draco smiled as he moved some books off a chair so he could sit down. “I just came to apologise.”
Harry smiled and began to stroke the owl, “Well Sterling, looks like we’re going to Hogwarts.” He quickly wrote a reply to the Headmistress and handed it to his new owl, “I think you know where to go.”
The door then opened wide and Draco and Pansy saw a smiling Mrs Weasley standing staring at them. She smiled even wider when she realised who it was.
“Come in.”
“Don’t be rude Ronald!” Hermione said as she dragged Ron to sit on the chairs opposite Pansy and Draco.
“Hey, you Weasley’s are my friends now thank you very much.”
“Well there’s this person I really like, and I want to ask them out, but I am no good with romance and I don’t know any romantic places to take them. I can’t really afford anywhere nice.” She sighed.
Draco nodded, “I was in the back though keeping out of sight. I wanted to go speak to them all, apologise for their loss. But I didn’t think the time was right. Who knows, they probably would’ve kicked me out.”
The bustling streets of London were a nice change from the depressing feel of Malfoy Manor. Pansy clung onto Draco for dear life as they wove their way through the busy crowds.
“If something went wrong Pansy would have murdered us all by now.” Ginny joked which only made Hermione more nervous.
“Hi, all the other compartments are full. Can we join you?” Hermione smiled.
Draco took a deep breath in and nodded in reply. His mother smiled and let go of his hand.
“Ooo wait I brought you something! It’s a small thank you present for agreeing to help me.” Ginny smiled. She ran to her wardrobe and pulled a box of the top. She opened it and pulled out a silver and
“If you’ve come to apologise about Fred, don’t” George said.
Hello and welcome back to chapter two!
“Sorry to interrupt,” Pansy said as she stuck her head round the door, “But we need to go shopping Draco.”
“Why not? It will give me a break from these four walls.”
Hi everyone!
“We all feel the same Dray,” Pansy replied laying down next to him.
“Oh god yeah, I’m sorry about hitting you Draco.” Hermione grimaced.
“I saw you.” George spoke up and Draco gave him a confused look, “I saw you at the funeral. I wanted to come over and speak to you, but you looked like you wanted to keep hidden. So, I waited till
“Why what have I done?”
“But it is. I let the death eaters into the castle. I didn’t try to stop Snape from killing Dumbledore. I followed in my father’s footsteps and joined a murderous lunatic, “Draco sighed,
Draco laughed as Pansy tried to push him off the bed, “Look I never hated Harry, I thought he was a nice person. I only hated him because you did.”
Harry’s eyes widened at how sharp her tone had become. She was definitely a Malfoy. “And what would that be?”
green head band (Which followed the same pattern as the Slytherin tie). Draco smiled at her and she placed it on his head.
“Oh no it’s not that, see there’s this…”
“I-oh shut up Parkinson!”
“It’s not nothing Draco,” Pansy interjected, “He’s worried about what Hermione’s going to say to him, he thought she’d kill him on sight.”
everyone had gone. And then there you were pouring your heart out to my brothers gravestone.”
“You’d really do that! You’d really do that for a Weasley?”
“Why not.”
“Draco? Can we see?” Hermione asked.
“He’s away. Fear took over him as the days till the start of term drew closer. Draco was scared how people would react; he was scared someone would blame him for what happened. My brother may act as though he is better than everyone else, that he fears nothing. But I can tell you know that from the letters I received, he wanted desperately to be out of it. If you only knew some of the things that happened to him.”
“Wait,” Ron said laughing harder than he had done in weeks, “Can you say that once more, please!”
“I might have held a small grudge for a few years, but I am over that now.” Draco smiled
“Ginny I’m shopping for dresses because I need to turn into a woman to get away with not being harassed, and not once have I complained. I’ve also been dropping hints the whole time we’ve been at Hogwarts.” Draco gave the girl a soft smile and Ginny laughed.
I hope you like the owl. I know how hard Hedwig’s death was for you, so I took it upon myself to buy you a new companion. I know he will never replace her, but I hope he can fill that empty space. His name is Sterling and will be as loyal as Hedwig.
“Now that,” Draco smiled, “I can work with that. Where did you find it?”
Ron didn’t even think twice, he grabbed Hermione and Ginny and dragged them as they went to find Harry.
Hermione smiled at the nervous boy, “I finish my shift in a bit, wait outside and I’ll be there soon.”
Molly lead them to the living room where Arthur Weasley was sat reading the latest Daily Prophet. He looked up as the three entered the room.
“Hermione I’m scared to go back to Hogwarts”
“I thought we were going tonight.” Draco shouted back.
Draco’s jaw dropped. He walked over to Ginny, grabbed her wrist, and started to drag her over to the other side, “Ginny Weasley you might just be my fashion consultant by the end of the day.”
“Nice to see you Draco, and you must be Pansy” Arthur smiled as he stood from his chair.
Crazy in love- beyonce
Draco remembers the next day, as he walked down to the common room with Pansy and Blaise, looking at Harry, smiling at him. He remembers as he was about to take a step towards him, the Weaslette ran towards him, grinning, hugging him, holding him close. He can feel the tears in his eyes as he watches Draco while he holds her back, doesn't push her away as she kisses his throat at the spot that Draco had marked him last night. Harry had healed the bites. Draco clears his throat, and walks out of the common room with as much dignity as he could muster. He refuses to talk to Pansy or Blaise about it. After telling them about last night, he feels too humiliated, to vulnerable. He can see that Blaise and Pansy are furious at Har- Potter. Once the train stop and he gets down, he can hear Potter calling him but he doesn't turn. He apparates to the manor.
"What the hell is it with you and the bad gryffindor purebloods. I mean there are better Gryffindors!" Longbottom says.
"Cormac." Darien replies. "He works in my office. Even he's on leave since past few days. They'll come together."
My house elf immediately comes and Teddy looks at her and makes excited giggles.
Harry's POV
Y r james and Sirius sitng bck 2 bck?
"Time for bed, pet. Let's rest." Harry says and gives Draco's cheek another kiss.
"You look pale amd tired. If I didn't know better, I think you've put on glamour charm. Are you okay?" I asked.
"I'm going shopping with Ginny today." Draco informs.
Harry thought.
Harry's hand that's on Draco's hip, tightens. He takes a deep breath in an attempt to calm his anger down. His anger on those men.
"Potter." Draco mumbled on to Harry's shoulder.
Belle's POV
"Draco dear. Why don't you both take teddy in the living room and I'll get you both some tea." Andromeda said.
"Sit with us guys. Lets all be friends for tonight."  Lavender screams. The colour on her cheeks show that she is definitely tipsy if not drunk.
Thanks guys really. Suckers. Picnic is a good idea though. I'll sort out the music as well. Pads we need to go to Hogsmade to but some stuff for the date.
"Yes pet?" Harry asked and waited patiently.
Harry immediately notices that Draco and Iris are not at the bar but he finds Draco with Iris, Keith and Arnold somewhere near a table.
"Of course, pet." Harry says and lets Draco apparate them.
So many hands. So many people. Draco remembers that night. One of the most terrifying and terrible nights of his life. He still doesn't know what potion he was given. He remembers those death-eaters enjoying his body while his Father and Voldemort watched. They made his mother watch. He saw as she fell on to her knees, begging them to let Draco go. He remembers how limp his body was. How he could do nothing but lay there and feel the pain, unable to help himself. His punishment to save Potter that day. To not reveal him. To holding the wands deliberately loose so that Potter could get them and escape. How could he not? How could he let Potter get caught. Draco wanted him to win. But is it worth it? This pain, this torment. He remembers watching Hagrid bringing in Potter's body. He remembers feeling empty in a way he never did before, which is a lot to say because Draco has always been empty. A vessel. A body to use. A tool. He remembers feeling the tiny bit of hope he had, lose. It still hurts. It hurt so much. Why doesn't anyone make it stop? Why doesn't anyone ever make them stop?
