? Why? He just wanted to get something to eat and then head home, drink a nice glass of firewhiskey or something even stronger to burn away the memories of being all lovey-dovey with Potter and go to bed, preferably blacking out immediately and without a massive hangover the other day.
His footsteps were muffled by the carpeted floor as he started looking for Draco’s rooms. He knew from what the blond had told him that they were on the first floor, in the East Wing. He sincerely hoped that that was where he was at the moment, because he had absolutely no idea where East would be. He’d never been good at remembering how one could find out the cardinal points.
Harry cursed and hurried towards the door to pick up his cloak. Raising his wand, he layered charm over charm onto the old wood of the door, hoping against all hope that it would buy them time.
, the plaque said. No names were listed below, not telling the visitor who resided in this dorm. He didn’t need the list the Slytherin plaques depicted, however, to know who was sleeping behind this wooden door – Harry, the only person who had ever trusted him fully, even though he had had more than enough reasons not to.
“Ron!” Hermione cried out indignant and pulled him away from a now laughing Harry. “Behave yourself, damn it!”
It truly was. It was silver in colour, and although there was nothing overly special about it, it looked of value. It was a magical watch with loads of hands and twirling globes. He didn't know how to read it, but Draco did. He thought that his dad, to whom the watch had belonged, would have appreciated the gesture behind what Harry was doing at the moment.
He glanced at the old grandfather clock in the hall-like room, ticking softly. The bigger hand moved slowly, inching towards his meeting with his parents. He gulped. Why was he so nervous? Two fingers pinched the bridge of his nose as he squeezed his eyes tightly shut, trying to not only shut out the light but everything else as well. Why was this situation so nerve-wrecking? Why was he so afraid to tell his parents that he fell in love?
"Indeed, I do." He cleared his throat nervously and hesitantly sat down next to his object of desire that looked a little bit afraid as if he didn't know what to expect. If Draco was honest with himself, he didn't know that either. He hadn't even known he fancied
” She bit her lips. “I mean… It's Draco Malfoy we’re talking about here. Can he really make a 180 degree turn so soon after rooming with Voldemort earlier this year?”
“So, you are on his side, then? Do you believe all of this nonsense that is coming out of his mouth about all that Death Eater stuff?” Her eyes flashed as she rounded up on Harry.
Laughter filled the room as Voldemort moved past the Malfoys and stopped right in front of the terrified Muggle.
He could still feel the last bits of adrenaline pump through his system as he slowly walked across Hogwarts’ grounds and tried to not look too closely.
Pain was the first thing he noticed when his brain caught up with his surroundings. It wasn’t the type of sharp pain you had when you cut yourself with a knife or the dull ache that was caused by knocking your knee. It was a weird mixture of these two kinds; a dull, everlasting ache that felt as if his bones were on fire. He couldn’t specify its origin, as it felt like it came from within, directly from his blood, being spread through his veins by his steady heartbeat.
Content, he let himself plop down onto one of his two couches, picked up one of the two fresh socks that he'd taken out of his wardrobe earlier, and set about getting the finishing touches done. One twirl with his wand later, his hair was dry, his arms and legs moisturised, and his favourite cologne flew out of the bathroom and straight into his lap, ready for application.
“Is that so?” Pale blonde eyebrows raised as the grey eyes beneath them studied him with mild interest and curiosity, although their owner would never admit the latter.
"They will know. You know they will, and they will not stop until they find me. I can't make you go through that. I can't be the reason that destroys your life. I won't be."
Just as she was about to pick the of dust smelling tome up to put it back into its shelf, she could hear hurried feet running into her direction, but before she could do more than open her mouth to chastise the person from running in the hallway, someone collided with her and send the old, fragile book flying out of her hand. It landed on the floor with a deafening thud. The thin spine immediately fell off the cover and landed on the cold stone floor.
"Thank you." A pink tint coloured his cheeks as he tried to squirm under his mother's gaze. She had always enjoyed to just look at him. "You do, too."
. The blond male stopped on his walk towards what Harry could only guess was the – or a – parlour or fireplace room to look over his shoulder, his perfectly shaped eyebrow raised.
After a hurried shower, hair still slightly moist but dressed in a smart shirt and freshly pressed pants, he felt a wave of relief wash over him. Another look at his watch told him he still had four minutes to spare.
He should have known! He should have known that Malfoy didn’t want anything from him except gossip material! And he had given it to him willingly, acting like a love-struck teenager, giddy to stay the night at a lover’s house! A shudder ran through his body as he picked himself up, swaying slightly. He felt disgusting! He had actually believed him when he had said that he had changed! He had actually believed him when he had said he wanted to try it!
“Why did you come?” The softly asked question echoed through the deadly silent room, jumping off of the cold stone walls, assaulting the two people currently staring at each other; silver eyes emotionless, emerald ones unbelieving.
Harry’s head turned towards Hermione automatically, who grabbed hold of Ron’s hand as his eyes focused on her. She was nervously biting her bottom lip, her teeth leaving white marks on the soft pink flesh and her cheeks were slightly darker than usual.
Torches bathed the dungeons in an eerie light, making shadows more pronounced and threatening. Cloaked figures framed the hallway as the two Malfoys walked calmly towards a metal door that was guarded by another two cloaked and masked figures.
A high female voice cleared her throat and took a deep breath. “May I welcome the persons of the night; Mr and Mrs Ronald and Hermione Granger, accompanied by non-other than Mr Harry Potter himself!”
“I’ve been in Dumbledore’s office,” he murmured and started playing with a button on his boyfriend’s shirt.
Draco bit back a sigh. It's always been this way. His mother had always locked away her human side whilst near her husband and Draco had not known better than to follow in her wake. His father did not appreciate them showing emotion or how he used to call it 'weakness'. At the time he had not known why he had acted like that, but during the war he had had suspicions that his father had merely acted that way to keep them safe, to protect them and teach them to not let others see what they could possibly use as a chance to attack. But he hadn't changed after the war was over, which was the one thing that made him wonder whether Lucius Malfoy really thought of emotions as weakness. If that was the case, he didn't look forward to the conversation they were going to have.
„Were you ever under the impression that I was normal? Seriously, Dean! We were together for a year. You must know me better by now.”
Draco frowned at it and put his right hand over the covered wound. A dull pain told him that the gash wasn’t healed yet, meaning that it would probably never completely heal either.
“Harry!” Ginny gasped for breath as she skidded to a halt in front of a very confused-looking Harry, whose eyes widened slightly. “Thank goodness, I found you. I was looking everywhere for you!”
He had wanted to respect Draco’s wish to not come after him as he needed to do what his family asked of him. He had not been happy about it – quite the contrary in fact – but he had respected that wish. He would have wanted Draco away from the bull’s eye as well if he had had the opportunity to tell him to stay far away from the Ministry of Magic and their Department of Mysteries or whatever places where he had fought for his life. He wouldn’t want his other half in danger, and he knew that Draco found comfort in the knowledge that Harry was far away. Or so he thought....
She gaped at him indignantly, huffed, ripped the glass out of Draco’s hand, smashed in on the floor and stormed off.
I blinked at him owlishly. What the devil was going on here? Was everyone losing their minds right now? I closed my eyes and took a deep breath to calm my inner, slightly more malicious than necessary voice down.
,” Harry scoffed and laughed humourlessly. “Don’t you think I’ve done enough for the Greater Good and for the Wizarding World? I saved the school’s population more than a couple of times. I fought against Voldemort more often than I can remember, starting with when I was one and didn’t have a clue about what was going on. I
“Getting the hell out of here,” he replied, glancing over his shoulder and fastening his pace. He turned around a corner and let himself fall onto the nearest bench. “Sorry ‘bout that,” he mumbled as Draco blinked at him owlishly. “Skeeter was on her way towards us and I don’t have the nerve to deal with her just now.”
Harry exhaled softly as something close to relief flooded him. He was on the right floor, it seemed. At least one positive thing was happening to him tonight! He just hoped that Hermione and Ron’s distraction managed to hold Malfoy senior and his goons away for long enough, so that he could get to the blond safely and unnoticed. Thinking back to his friend’s explanation of her brilliant plan, though, he somehow doubted that Lucius Malfoy would be kept away from his son’s rooms for long. He had to hurry.
The woman beamed at him and batted her eyelashes. “Emily Ackland,” she grabbed his hand and intertwined their fingers immediately. Harry blushed. Her smile widened. He gulped.
that I could be half-human. Mother and father would rip their hair out if they were to find out, if they had been told there was a magical creature in our pure family history of only wizards and witches of the purest and finest blood there was. There was absolutely no way that I could be…
“Draco,” Ginny huffed and pushed against one of Dean’s feet that was currently digging uncomfortably into her stomach. “Would you please move, Dean? Your foot is in my stomach.”
The young wizard glared at the werewolf for a few seconds before huffing and leaving the room. He didn’t care whether he’d get help. He’d go and get Draco, and if he died trying then the Order would maybe try and change their views on some points because they were just a bunch of prejudiced idiots, who couldn’t look past the obvious.
Blaise’s head shot up, his eyes getting bigger with the second. “Harry!” He yelled, as he saw the dumbfounded wizard stand in the doorway, his hands hanging at both sides, staring at the pair in front of them. “Please, I need he-“
“Mr Potter, there you are. I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” Harry whirled around and stared into the plain face of the blonde woman he had ‘met’ while on stage. She raised a very thin and unnatural looking eyebrow and eyed the bottle of whiskey in Harry’s hand.
“Harry, please, just let us think this through beforehand!” Hermione said desperately, her hands wringing nervously as she watched Harry hurry through his bedroom and grab his father’s cloak. “I’m sure we’ll find a solution that is perfectly safe.”
for Draco, he had even honestly thought of moving to France with him. But just as Hermione always told him, decisions like that shouldn't be made lightly.
Theodore Nott leant against the wall and scrutinised the blond intently. “Well, do you like him? I mean, if you’ve been nice to him...”
Harry swallowed down a wave of sadness, betrayal and pain as he hurried to pick up his clothes and turned to leave the room, leaving a broken Draco behind.
me than to help me fulfil a so-called destiny that everyone was only too happy to know it was lying on somebody else’s shoulders! I had two Ministers against me, one more publicly than the other. I had teachers torture me, betray me. I watched friends get hurt, tortured,
Ginny grinned. She couldn't believe that they had not yet noticed each other's Feelings, but as she looked towards Dean who was busy watching her, she wasn't all that surprised. Apparently guys were just blind when it came to
On his slow and painful way there, he had to accept the fact that that was not about to happen as white spots pushed themselves into his vision, closing in on him, until he collapsed in a bloody heap on the polished mahogany floor his mother loved so much.
The blond sighed softly as a sad smile pulled at his lips. They’d find each other again. He really hoped so.
The heavy hand on his shoulder squeezed painfully as Lucius softly cleared his throat. “You will be asked to give this filth what it deserves,” he muttered in a gentle tone, almost caringly, lovingly. He nearly sounded as deranged as his dear auntie Bella. Draco clenched his teeth together. “You will do as our Lord demands. You will then bow down and take on your true destiny.”
He had lost his whole family due to that maniac and had watched others lose their lived right before his eyes – whether that had been because of the Killing Course or because of their parents’ believes and their own unbelievably huge fear.
His once slightly tanned skin looked sickly pale and was covered in wounds, some still looked raw and inflamed. Bruises covered half of his face, which was sunken in as if he hadn’t been eating properly for months. His entire frame, clad in dirt and blood-crusted clothes, looked almost tiny. His clothes hung off of him as if he had lost a couple of stone, which he probably had. His hair was rumbled to such an extent that Draco was inclined to just cut everything off and let it grow anew. It was matted with so much grime that it was a wonder that his pillow still looked white.
are,” she smirked at the handsome wizard, who stood now between Harry and Ackland, shielding him successfully from her clutches of doom.
hands were fidgeting, but Draco could only stare at the long, somewhat elegant looking digits that he would give everything he had if he could just touch them once… along with that amazing hair and those muscular arm and this mouth-watering neck…
Thoughts about being disowned or killed seemed favourable at the moment and those feelings scared the hell out of him. He had never wanted to die. He thought his life a very big deal and nothing to play with. Being a Malfoy had always been a source of pride but being just Draco sounded safer to him now.
Hermione’s gaze travelled over the surface of the Black Lake as she tried to think of an explanation for the pureblood’s weird behaviour. And however she tried to turn the events, she came to the same conclusion every time.
. Just like the time with Sirius. Hadn’t he learned out of his mistakes? Hadn’t he learned by now that he should at least listen to Hermione out of all people when she thinks there’s something wrong?
"I see," he said quietly before nodding slowly and turning around without another word. Harry heard him walk down the hallway and out of the apartment, closing the door softly behind him.
Granger and Harry exchanged one of those looks that contained a whole, complex discussion that for the life of me I couldn’t – and still can’t for that matter – manage to figure out. Granger sniffed, crossed her arms over her chest and leaned forward slightly, so that her eyes would be on the same level as mine, was I to decide to raise my head.
woman shuffled into the frame, looking at Hermione with a reproachful look on her face. She huffed and let herself fall onto a low wall painted right behind her. “Well?” she raised her eyebrows, and looked from Hermione to Draco and back again. “What do you want? Do you want to give me the password or were you planning to just stare at me?”
“This is not about betraying anyone.” Hermione dropped Ron’s hand and stepped up to him, kneeling down next to the chair he was trying to stay in. “We have to make sure that there is no threat remaining that could cause another war.”
Everywhere around Harry and the stupid bird, the floor was covered in extremely deliciously smelling scrambled eggs, bacon, muffins and pumpkin juice. I hated that bird.
Harry leaned back against the cold stone wall of the cold dungeon, wrapping his scarf tighter around his slender neck. He was happy that he had remembered taking it as he had upped and left the Common Room to meet up with whoever had sent him this nice sounding letter. He just hoped it wasn’t some crazed fan who wanted to kidnap him.
He had only his hope that he was desperately holding onto. He had continuously told himself that if he didn’t give up hope, he’d see Harry again some day. And that day was today.
The cautious smile that she gave him did nothing to calm him down. He was thankful, however, that she did not talk about honour or the Malfoy name as he was sure his father would have. His mother knew what he went through and she knew that he was not fully convinced that the Dark Lord's ways were the right ones. Draco had never given her any reason to believe that he thought less about her Lord, as he was sure she would have told his father and that punishment would have been preventable.
Now the confusion was more than obvious on Malfoy's pale face. His mouth opened and closed as if he was having trouble finding words, which, not going to lie, confused Ginny a bit.
"About one hundred metres! Incendio!" Ron yelled, quickly followed by a pained scream as one Death Eater lit up in flames, involuntarily taking two others down with him.
“What are you doing here?” His voice was deadly calm, but his head was spinning. How did he get in? Why did he come here? What else did he want?
Draco Malfoy was never more aggravated than during those official festivities where he was just being invited to due to one handsome wizard going by the name of Harry James Potter.
He couldn’t believe that he was still alive. Trembling all over and still gasping in pain, but breathing nonetheless. Not many people could say that once they’d disrespected the Dark Lord.
He gulped down his third firewhiskey in one go, grimacing slightly as the liquid burned down his throat. He hastily turned around as two women, went past him, saying something about wanting a photograph with and an autograph from the hero. He gulped and raised his whiskey glass towards his lips, only to notice that it was empty. He glanced over his shoulder towards the bar, loaded with bottles of white wine, red wine, sparkling wine, whiskey, firewhiskey, butterbeer and for some odd reason bananas.
“Why do you think I would do that?” Staring straight into the blue eyes of his headmaster, he raised one eyebrow and bit back a scowl as said man took his time to take a sip of his tea, adjust his glasses and take a deep breath before gracing him with an answer. Harry frowned.
As a little boy, he had once gotten lost in the manor as he had played hide and seek with one of the house elves that were responsible for his education, and had ended up behind the narrow wooden door. He could still feel the cold and clammy stone walls underneath his small fingers as his curiosity had weighed out his parents' warnings. His little feet had carried him into the maze that was the mansion's dungeon.
He had to stay calm and think. It didn't do him any good if he went and started to get panicked. He had one room left, just about three metres ahead of him, and if that one wasn't the one he was looking for either, then he'd just turn around and search the whole freaking mansion! He was not giving up or leaving without Draco!
was telling them – but he had never acted on these speculations of the Wizarding part of the paparazzi world. And he had planned for it to stay that way for quite some time; at least until he had found
Behind him, Harry huffed. He didn’t like this whole scenario either, then. Draco smirked. “This whole thing,” he gestured wildly with his hands, “is to honour those who lost their lives during the war?” He started laughing loudly as Ackland looked ready to murder him. “You can’t be serious!”
This is one of my favourites! Also, I'm sorry if there might be some mistakes in my stories. I'm not a native English speaker, so you guys might see mistakes that I don't. I hope you enjoy reading my stories nevertheless!
“What is it they want now?” I sighed as I dropped the blanket next to my chair and strolled over to Harry’s side, who had just shooed the rude owl out of the kitchen window. I had done my duties in charity and social work, just like the Wizengamot had told me to right after the war. That’s what father was good for – steal the last of my free time. He even managed that while rotting in prison.
As Malfoy sat down, his finger brushed against Harry's thigh, causing him to tense and supress a shiver. "I want to be honest with you, Potter," he put the wine glass onto the brightly polished surface of the coffee table and put his now free arm over the back rest of the little sofa they were sitting on. Harry could feel his body heat seep through their layers of clothing and into his skin, heating his body… too much. He squirmed slightly as his trousers started to get uncomfortably tight.
A hand grabbed his upper arm, fingers digging painfully into his biceps. “Do it, Draco, or so help me Morgana...”
Granger smiled at me and – I think my heart stopped there for a second when that happened – took hold of my hands. “Trust me,” she said in a low and gentle voice, her smile soft and honest. “I won’t let anything happen to you. I swear.”
Confused, he took the parchment out of my slightly clammy hands, pulled it out of the envelope and began to read.
This was the answer he had been looking for. It didn't make it any less painful, however, but deep inside he knew this was right. What Draco and he had had… it was long gone. He still felt love for him, yes, but there was more to a relationship than a feeling that wouldn't be enough to keep it going—to keep
The evil grin that spread over the youngest Weasley’s face was frightening to say the least and the young Gryffindor who was kneeling beside said Weasley was very happy that he had not been chosen as a victim this time. It was horrible enough that Ginny grew up with two of the most infamous pranksters of the world but to have them ruin her innocent mind in a way that made her come up with even more dangerous and downright frightening plans was just too much for him to handle, so he could merely sit back and watch the show.
After the Triwizard Tournament, when Harry Potter had appeared outside the maze, cup clutched in one hand, and the lifeless body of Cedric Diggory in his other, he had known that the peaceful life had ended – that
He cursed as his eyes fell on the slightly open front door, letting rays of sunshine stream into the hallway. Wrapping his silk blanket tighter around his waist, he started running out of the heavy front door, onto the gravel path outside the manor. Birds were chirping left and right, the sun was shining, the flowers were bright and colourful, but everything Draco could see was the lone figure at the end of the path, loaded with clothes, that was coming to a hold just outside the Anti-Apparation wards.
“Hermione got hurt when we were getting you out of there,” he said and looked up at the wide grey eyes that were staring at him as if he had lost his mind.
Fear so potent and overwhelming that he hadn’t dared to move had flooded his body. Dread and a paralysing sense of acceptance had left him frozen on the spot.
But seeing the wizards and witched of the British community glaring at him and whispering behind his back didn’t help his nerves. His fingers clutched desperately at the glass in his hands, the golden brown liquid inside spilled over the rim, wetting his trembling fingers.
without a fight. He had thrown his own wand towards him, leaving himself defenceless, but in that moment he couldn’t have cared less. The shocked gasp that ran through the crowd, good people and Death Eaters alike, had barely bothered him at all. If at all, it had filled him with pride. He had, for once, acted on his own accord – he had
This couldn’t be. She couldn’t have… Oh Merlin, she needed to find Harry. She needed to make this right again, explain to him what an idiot she had been, and make him see that he had been right about Malfoy and she had been wrong.
Blood covered most of the front of his dark robes, which made his already bloodless skin look even paler. He looked dead. The only calming thing was the shallow, huffed breaths and the moving chest, as it raised up and down slightly as it painfully took in oxygen.
“What took you so long?” he asked, but Remus ignored him and walked past him towards the still screaming portrait. With practiced motions, he pulled the curtains shut and motioned the three younger wizards to follow him into the kitchen.
"Umm... research," she said and sneaked a glance to her right towards Dean who was looking everywhere but the three people in front of him. She huffed. Typical of him to not support her in a moment of need. She rolled her eyes and met Harry's amused, emerald green ones.
“He got a letter from your department earlier this morning, saying that he had to come to a hearing due to his newly acquired heritage,” Harry answered calmly, a gentle and peaceful smile decorated his soft lips. I swallowed. God, how much I loved that man.
Draco shook his head and buried his face in his hands. “I can’t believe this really happened,” he mumbled softly as Harry lovingly wrapped his arms around the shaking body and pulled him close. “This is so embarrassing!”
I watched as his eyes narrowed slightly, just to quadruplicate in size right afterwards. He stared at the yellowish parchment in his hands, his pink lips slightly open. I frowned and moved a step towards him.
His fingers clenched and unclenched around his fragile mug as he tried not to show his nervousness. His parents sat on the settee in front of him, occasionally sipping their tea, but otherwise not trying to start the conversation he was getting desperate to have. He sighed as he put his cup back on its saucer.
As he looked at the broken watch that he had found in his family vault after the war, the first of many tears fell down his cheek. His hand trembled as he wiped it away, only for more to follow in its wake.
He hadn’t gotten a good look at Harry in a very long time. Back in the Manor, he had been disfigured by Hermione’s stinging hex, and a few hours ago both of them had been busy shooting curses at Death Eaters to really look at each other. But what he saw now made it hard for him to breath.
“Draco,” he said, his eyes not leaving the girl, as a cruel smile found its way onto his thin lips. “Come over here.”
Harry gaped at the old wizard sitting behind the old oak desk he had sat in front of so many times. His facial expression was serious, neutral. The roughly twenty people that were currently scattered throughout Dumbledore’s office, all staring at him with more or less cold expressions were the least one of his worries at this moment. He blinked as he tried to take in what his mentor had just asked him to do. This couldn’t be true. He had to have misunderstood what this wise man had wanted to –
The next day started just like any other day in the autumn month - gloomy. Clouds covered the sky, making the golden leaves look dull and dead. Classes hadn't been any better either. It was Ginny’s last year in Hogwarts and she had always imagined it to be exciting, but as it turned out, the professors had reached a new level of spitefulness.
Draco frowned and made to move towards Harry but froze as soon as he saw what the other was holding in his hand. "Where did you find that?"
He ran after the invisible form of the blond and aimed his wand to the spot he assumed his body to be. Muttering the counter charm, he slowly lowered Draco and let him come to rest on a soft patch of grass underneath the window. He hoped that the rogue peacocks running around on the ground didn't step on the blond, but to blow the cloak off of the injured boy could very well mean his death.
A tear fell out of his eyes, and he sniffed softly. He had him back! Harry was back, alive and relatively healthy. He would be back to full health in no time! The only thing he couldn't know for certain was whether the Gryffindor’s feelings towards him had changed, and that possibility scared him more than anything he had seen or had been forced to do during the last year.
She took a deep breath as she felt her fingers start to tingle. It would do her no good if she were to lose control of her magic at this moment. She needed all of her strength to properly hex him after he had admitted to treason. “Don’t act all innocent,
He would not show that kind of vulnerability! If Harry saw him like this, his damned hero instinct would kick in and he’d feel obligated to save him like he always did. That’s his thing – saving people; no matter how hopeless the situation was. Harry was too stubborn for his own good. If he’d have his way, he’d ruin his whole life just to save another, and that was what he was currently doing. If Draco allowed the Potter heir to stay, he’d seal the horrible fate looming over him. Voldemort would come after him and end what he had started. His own father would come and see to him dying of his own hand, and he would
"Hey 'Mione." Harry laughed and ushered both of his friends inside. "I'm alright, thanks. And you guys? Everything going well?" He looked at her growing belly and couldn't keep the grin off his face.
Harry sighed and lowered his face into his hands just as Draco let himself sink into the soft cushions next to him. An arm wrapped itself around his shoulders, holding him gently but tightly as his lover bent towards him and pressed his velvet lips onto his pale cheek.
Door after door he opened, without finding anything than possible guest rooms, studies, game rooms and libraries. Why a family of three needed so many libraries was beyond him.
They came to a stop in front of a tall, empty painting. The canvas showed an Italian landscape with sunny hills, trees and some sort of building.
He would go even without her help. She knew him. She had grown up by his side, had gotten to know how he ticked and how he acted. The only difference between her staying or her going would be his chance of survival. She didn’t have a choice. She never did. But she didn’t care. She wouldn’t risk her brother’s life over anything. Even if that meant sneaking into Malfoy Manor. But, hey – it wasn’t as if they hadn’t done that before, right?
, earning her a disapproving stare from Madam Pince. Nothing. She could absolutely not find any information whatsoever! How was she supposed to complete this essay if she couldn’t find what she needed for it?
Draco had promised he'd be here at 6 pm sharp. He had even told him to be presentable then because he wouldn't be waiting for him to get dressed. Had something happened to him? Had he been delayed at work and couldn't make it in time?
“Any moment now the Dark Lord will arrive,” Lucius Malfoy’s voice was soft, velvety, almost gentle, as he whispered into his son’s ear. “He will welcome his followers, and he will include you in that welcome. Us Malfoys have been on the side of power and influence for generations now, and to now have a Lord as generous and fair as ours is, is truly a blessing. We have no right to be anything but thankful, Draco.”
“Whatever they did to your arm,” Draco’s eyes trailed back to Harry who was once again seated right next to him, looking worriedly at his appendix, “was to serve as a kind of warning. Voldemort always had a thing for drama.”
He'd heard people talk about relationships like his and Draco's. He'd been in denial at first, saying that wasn't how his relationship with Draco was. What they had was special, after all. But even he had to admit, after being disappointed time and time again, that something was wrong.
that had survived and not Voldemort. He wanted to tell him so much, but all he could do was stare at those beautiful lips and those brilliant eyes…
do this anymore, Draco," his voice breaking with unfiltered emotion. He lowered his gaze back to the watch that he was still clutching onto. The small pieces of glass had started to dig their way into his palm without him noticing. Small droplets of blood mixed with his tears and started coating the globes. "I just can't."
"Ah, Draco," the voice of his father said, and he looked at the hooded figure that stood directly above the defenceless girl. "You're in time. Excellent. Our Lord will be here any minute now. He will not want to miss you joining his ranks."
“No offence, Hermione, but we don’t have time for brainstorming right now,” Harry grit out and forced himself to not scowl at his best friend. “I know you’re trying to help, but this really isn’t helping. I haven’t heard anything from him in ages. The last time I saw him he acted as if it would be the last time I would ever see him. He’s in danger, Hermione. I just know it. I can feel it. I know this isn’t safe and I know that the chances of us getting hurt or worse are very high, but I cannot leave him on his own like this! I love him!”
Confessing something disdained is never easy, but Draco's heart gives him strength to do what must be done - tell his parents he's in love. With Harry Potter.
Harry smiled awkwardly and tried to scoot away from the overenthusiastic blond witch at his side. “Thank you,” he said into the microphone and the next ten minutes were spend with trying to convince the audience that he enjoyed the party just as much as he was supposed to, always in constant danger of getting out of reach of the microphone, as the blonde lady beside him made it a very uncomfortable habit of sticking to his body like a second skin.
A lot had changed during the last year. With most of the population of Hogwarts going through the trauma of living in a school filled with Death Eaters, certain loyalties had been formed while others had been broken. Thinking back to her conversation with Hermione the night before, she wondered whether Malfoy had been one of those who had renounced Voldemort’s ranks and had really changed for the better.
There were two sides to the medal, however. Draco hadn't been someone Harry could fully trust. Well,
Lightning cracked through the sky, briefly illuminating the garden underneath. The flowers that usually stood tall and proud were fighting against the pressure of the rain drops that pelted down upon them without mercy.
He would wait for him. He had all the time in the world now, could do whatever he pleased, so he would wait for Harry to come to him. He would give him the time he needed, and when he was ready, he’d come to Draco, and Draco would be there for him.
Hermione was wrong! She had known that this would all go down the drain and would hurt Harry. Merlin, how she despised herself right now! She had known that Malfoy would not have changed that drastically, yet she hadn’t said anything to Harry. She hadn’t warned him of that… that
"Then don't." His voice was barely above a whisper, trembling ever so slightly, but he didn't care. He had to make sure that the one good thing in his life was safe and would stay safe. He wouldn't be able to live with himself otherwise. He tried to keep the tears from falling out of his storm grey eyes, but he couldn't.
“Rise and shine, love,” said the most loving, beautiful and at the moment most annoying and irritating voice I have ever heard in my entire life.
Heart aching and lungs protesting, Draco slowly stood up and moved around the chair, cautious not to stumble over Harry’s boots.
Comment and tell me what you think the bracelet is for! It has a purpose :) But neither Draco, nor Harry know about it - obviously.
“Well?” I asked nervously, not really wanting to hear the answer, but wanting to hear it nevertheless.
"He is nearly of age. He should have started courting me by now," Astoria frowned and gazed over to the other side of the Great Hall, where her fiancé was talking with Gryffindor's Golden Boy. "But instead he's busy flirting with Potter! I don't understand this, Daphne. Am I not beautiful enough for him?"
Harry smiled innocently. “I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living. Especially with all the shit that’s been going on lately.”
Taking a deep breath, Harry checked whether he really was on his own in the deserted hallway and lifted his cloak off of his left hand, his right reaching for his wand. His trembling fingers curled around the cold metal of the doorknob and twisted.
The tousle-haired wizard had made it a habit to tell everyone he met that Draco had changed and wasn’t to be hold responsible for his parents’ actions. Upon the reply that
Harry blinked and stayed silent. He had to admit that there was an odd truth in what Draco had just said. He hadn’t thought about it that way. All he had seen was his friends trying to jeopardise his relationship with the Malfoy heir and trying to get him into the position of the Wizarding World’s hero again. He had enough of that role and although the newspapers still loved him and still had him on their front page even after over half a year since the end of the war, he had not been happy about giving them even more juicy news to publish.
I am not supposed to be talking about ongoing cases,” she said, as if talking to a three year old. “I’m still not supposed to.”
Ginny was pretty sure her face was bright red by the time she had reached the library, but she couldn’t care less. Her jaw was hurting from her teeth grinding, her palms were sweaty in her balled fists. She was set to fight someone, preferably Malfoy, but she wouldn’t say no to Nott either. He hadn’t seemed to know that Malfoy was messing with Harry, but he didn’t really seem to care that he did either, so he was more than worthy for a few hexes.
“What was supposed to happen?” Dean blinked and rubbed at his eye to get out a grain of dust that had landed in there from Ginny’s breathing out rapidly. He grumbled as it started to tear up.
"Draco!" his voice was trembling violently, as he grabbed the blond's shoulder and rolled him onto his back. Green eyes widened drastically as they took in the sight that was his boyfriend.
“I’m sorry that those people treat you like a criminal,” he muttered as he looked into Draco’s light eyes, searching for any sign that might tell him he was moving too fast; he didn’t find it.
“What?” He hissed back as he nodded to Harry in thanks. “It’s itching like hell, ‘Mione! I can’t help it.”
He groaned as the smart witch came into his mind. She had told him! She had warned him! She had been sceptical when Harry had told her about his meeting with Malfoy! She had told him that she thought it was a trap! And he had not listened to her. He should know by now that she was usually right! He
Her high laugh echoed through the room as she pushed a strand of white-blond hair out of his face. His partner didn't like him slicking it back, so he had gotten rid of the habit his father had pushed on him in his early days.
It wasn’t as if Potter would be the one writing that letter. He just couldn’t imagine the boy-wonder sitting down in front of the fire, the flames warming up his slight figure as he hunched down over a piece of parchment, his falcon quill in his right hand, a pot of ink on the floor next to him...
But on this day, he knew that he had never had a choice; not really. Deep down he had always known that this day would come, even though he had done his best to not accept his imminent fate. He had wanted a future. He had wanted a choice. He had wanted a life, but all of this would be taken from him within the next couple of hours, he realised, as he stared into the pitch black night that enveloped everything around him.
. This party was being held in honour of him; it was impossible, if not disrespectful of him if he would have just stayed at home.
"Get Draco and get out of here. I'll manage to hold them off for a while until you've brought him to safety."
On any other day, he would count down the hours until his parents would retire, so that he could force a house elf to keep its mouth shut if he wanted to stay in the service of his family for a day longer as he sneaked out of his room, down the multiple corridors that led through the whole mansion, down the grand stair case and out the doors. He would always choose one of the back entrances, the ones that were only used by servants and house elves. The sky was always clear, as if it knew what the young wizard was up to. Thunder would only wake his parents up and would, thus, make it impossible for him to seek after what he truly wanted.
His pink lips stopped moving and the corners of his mouth twisted into a slight frown as he turned his head away from Harry. The black-haired wizards had to blink multiple times to get his brain to start working again. He hadn't noticed it froze around the time Malfoy had told him he wanted more than forgiveness.
Harry felt tingling butterflies do somersaults in his stomach. Seeing the dishevelled Draco Malfoy standing in front of him not being his perfectly organized self, stuttering for words, missing his gel and shoes, he felt an odd warmth spread through his body. Draco Malfoy was a pure-blood wizard to whom it was very important to be collected, strong and self-assured and yet he wasn’t anything but perfect in Harry’s eyes. He swallowed and shook his head slightly as Draco shifted and glanced up to him, looking through his bangs that hang into his beautiful face.
Indignant, I opened my mouth to shoot back an equally uncivil reply as a burst of heat stopped me from doing that. Harry’s hand squeezed my shoulder slightly as he smiled at his long-time best friend. “Brilliant!”
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” his voice was a mere whisper. He didn’t bother trying to overplay this faux-pas. I could see it in Harry’s eyes…
Red left grey as they zoned in on the trembling girl on the floor. “What do we have here. Not brushed off your shoes before entering the room, I see?”
was a place one should feel safe. He had never felt safe in that huge manor. The only times he had truly and entirely felt safe was when he had been in Harry’s arms.
Draco sniffled softly and a shy grin started to spread over his young face. “Harry,” he breathed and an adorable blush coloured his pale cheeks.
He sniffed, pushed himself away from the wall and stood straight. He needed to keep a clear head to find out what all of this letter nonsense was about, so with this thought it was that the blond wizard walked around a corner and saw one particular Gryffindor wander through the corridor, his back turned towards him, mumbling softly but quickly to himself and Draco’s heart stopped.
“He?” Lucius forced out between continuous coughs. He had nearly spit out his tea as his son had unconsciously given them too much information in his opinion. That couldn’t be! His son was the only heir of the Malfoy family! His son was of pure blood; blood so pure it could be traced back hundreds of years. His family had power and influence. His son couldn’t… no. No, this had to be a misunderstanding. There was no other option for this. He wouldn’t accept this…
He was downright fuming at this point and struggling to keep his voice even. "I found the destroyed remains of a watch; the same exact watch that happens to be a family heirloom, which I gave to you
Harry’s eyebrows shot up as he scrutinised his horrified boyfriend as he was trying to rip his hair out of his scalp.
Casting a strong shield in the hopes that no Unforgivable would be sent his way in the next few seconds, he turned his back towards the doorway, ran to the open window and jumped right out, without casting cushioning charms in the ground first.
“What?” Harry asked, scrutinising the blond closely. His bright green eyes looked at if they were illuminating the entire room - Draco’s entire world. “Don’t I get a congratulatory kiss from my boyfriend?”
Blond strands of hair fell into beautiful, red-rimmed, grey eyes that shone with pain and desperation. His cheeks were red, the rest of his complexion as pale as a porcelain doll. He was beautiful, the man of his dreams but he knew that it wouldn't work like this; not if he didn't change.
Soft whispers filled the room as the nameless figures moved to the back of the cell, leaving the defenceless girl in the middle of the cold, wet floor. She was still clutching desperately at her aching stomach. Draco schooled his features into a carefully empty expression, but inside he was screaming. He wanted to help her, but he knew he couldn’t. Judging by her defeated posture, she knew that he would not be of any help. Quite the contrary in fact. He would be one of her torturers. She knew it and he did as well.
"Still, I am so very sorry that you had to experience that. I had thought that I had offered the restaurant enough gold to handle this sort of thing, to keep it from happening, but apparently…"
His back straight, his eyes still looked into unbelieving brown ones, he prepared for the pain that was about to come. He would never be able to get lost in the bright emerald ever again, he thought, depressed, as he once again made peace with the fact that Harry knew that he loved him with his everything.
A beautiful smile stretched over Harry’s tired face, his eyes closed as he hummed softy. Draco couldn’t help himself but reach out and cradle Harry’s face in the palm of his hand. Warmth spread through his arm and up towards his heart.
Once seated, Harry stared at his former rival oddly. He didn't understand what was going on. This felt more like a date than a nice meeting with a possible future
"Hermione, don't you think we're past that stage when we kept trying to lure each other into traps?"
The 'Third Anniversary of Harry Potter's Triumph' isn't as bad as the second one was... At least for Harry and Draco.
Without deeming the two confused Slytherins another glance, Ginny cursed loudly, turned on the spot, and started sprinting out of the library, hoping against all hope that she had not just lost a friend.
Pansy Parkinson bets that Draco Malfoy won't manage to get into Harry Potter's pants and give her the story of her lifetime. One shouldn't bet with Draco Malfoy.
"I've had little constants in my life and one of them was you. I have had a lot of time to think after the war and I-" Malfoy's pink lips were moving, but Harry couldn't hear a word. Every once in a while the blond wizard's tongue tip would move to wet these soft-looking lips, leaving behind a trail of glistening beauty. Harry swallowed and bit his lower lip. What would they feel like if he would just… move… now…
His eyes snapped open, his head up and his hand to his side. He desperately tried not to clench it as he saw his mother walk into the room, a soft smile on her face and her arms opened wide to greet him.
Bemused, Draco only managed to gasp as Harry took hold of his hand and dragged him away from the table with the alcohol on it. “Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”
Tucking the Invisibility Cloak tightly around himself, Harry sneaked down the hallway, pausing every now and then to listen for footsteps that didn't belong to him. He couldn't hear a sound next to his shallow breathing and his heart that was thumping desperately in his ribcage. Judging by the silence, he was alone on this floor.
He turned on his heels and fled out of the classroom, his rounds completely forgotten. He needed to get away. Now.
“Yes, really,” she answered deridingly. “You’re a Death Eater and have no business anywhere near Harry Potter or this party. We’re here to honour those who died at
A shocked gasp escaped Harry before he could bite it back. Not caring whether anyone would find him anymore, he threw the door shut behind him, quickly sending a locking charm in its general direction. His cloak lay on the floor, entirely forgotten, as he rushed forward and fell onto his knees next to the person that meant the world to him.
He thought disgruntled, as he stirred Pansy into the next room to be tended to by his house elves and left the hallway himself. He had to get ready for his date.
“Why should I?” The smirk widened as she saw Draco getting redder with the minute. “This is quite amusing to watch. Have you seen Potter’s face?” She laughed. “He’s such a poof, oh Merlin! It was hilarious!”
“So, you mean that I should just go there and let them decide my future as a half-human? Just like that?”
They stayed like that for a while, just enjoying the feel of someone there. After a few, short minutes, Narcissa ran a slender hand through his hair and smiled at him. She had unshed tears in her eyes that she didn't even bother to blink away - something she would have done immediately if his father had been in the room.

rummaging through your things!" Harry all but hissed as he stood up and turned to face the blond. "I was putting away laundry and there was a pair of your boxers in it, so I wanted to put them away. And lo and behold, would you believe what I found?"
Glancing at the sleeping faces as they went by, they looked for the Malfoy heir. Astoria jumped as Blaise Zabini snorted in his sleep. "Careful!" Daphne whispered as she glared at her sister, who was standing behind her, shivering slightly. She hadn't taken her coat with her.
“Well, why don’t you tell us then what they’ll do during this hearing,” Harry dragged a chair beside mine and sat down. “I called you because we need your help, ‘Mione.”
“Draco,” he lowered his eye lids, so it looked as if his eyes only contained the colour bright green. It was creepy as hell. “Did your parents ever tell you anything about possible Veela ancestors in your family lineage?”
Harry tapped his foot, annoyed, his arms crossed over his chest, as he glared in the direction that he knew led to the dungeons.  He and Draco met at the bottom of the Great Stairs each morning, kiss each other hello and go to the Great Hall to have breakfast together – either at the Gryffindor or the Slytherin table. It was Slytherin’s turn today.
Well, if he was completely honest with himself, he assumed that he might not stay alive much longer since one needed skin and most of the flesh to keep blood from pouring out of the body, right? You’d need skin at least. That’s what kept unwelcome things out and essential stuff in.
"Actually, no. A friend recommended a location to me and I thought it fitted quite well," Draco smiled at the black-haired wizard in front of him and offered his arm. "Shall we?"
This one was written for The Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition Season 4 on FFN. My position was Chaser 3.
Harry gaped at the man sitting on the bed in front of him; his aristocratic features smooth, too smooth to be honest. He knew what the blond was doing; he had seen him do it multiple times before, more often than he could have counted, and he couldn’t help but feel disappointed that he apparently still felt the need to shut him out.
The curtains had not been drawn, and had been tied back neatly. Draco took a few cautious steps forward, hoping that the floorboards wouldn’t creek. He stopped dead right next to the bed, and he felt his heart pummel to the ground.
“Will you tell me what’s wrong?” Draco’s voice was low and quiet. It seemed to blend into the background noise of crackling fire and calmed his panicked thoughts down even more.
The room was circular and contained five beds with scarlet red curtains. Each bed had a wooden night table standing next to it, as well as a heavy trunk resting at its foot – except for two. One of those exceptions was the only bed in the room that was occupied.
“Hermione,” a soft voice whispered behind her and she saw dark hands wrap around her wrists as she reached for the pile of parchment that had once been a century old tome about the art of potion making.
"Perfect!" Pansy rubbed her hands together; her eyes began to shine at the new prospect of a front page story. "How are you planning to go about this?"
his usual companion at his side. He needed the charming, handsome young wizard at his side; let himself be calmed by the soothing sound of his soft voice and the warm touches of his big hands on his shoulder, arm or back.
"Can't do what any longer?" Draco sounded so insecure in that moment that, for a short, insane second, Harry doubted everything. Maybe he could change, after all? Had he given the blond enough time and opportunities to change? Yes. Yes, he had, but still…
I gulped in a huge amount of air and felt the dizziness slowly leave my brain. I could blink again. I turned my head and frowned at a concerned looking Harry who was still kneeling in front of me, one hand resting on my knee, the other on my cheek. Their warmth seeped right through my skin, into my veins and onwards to each and every little part of my body, concentrating in my groin. I groaned.
“What? Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course I’m alright,” Draco huffed and turned his head sideways to hide his adorable blush. Harry’s stomach made a somersault.
Harry turned around in time to see Draco close the front door, an air of hurriedness surrounding him.
On any other day, he would lie on his bed, his head turned towards the side, his eyes following the clouds in the sky. The window would be open, letting a soft breeze enter his bedroom carrying with it the sounds of birds chirping joyfully.
The young witch turned around towards her attacker and looked into the apologetic face of her boyfriend.
And with that Harry pulled Draco towards him, gently pressing his lips onto the blonde’s, enjoying the feeling of having him in his life.
"Harry! We've got to get out of here! We barely managed to get rid of them. They've swarmed out and are looking for you," Ron panted and leant down to pick the raven-haired wizard up off the floor.
“I... I know that, Harry,” she stuttered and squeezed her eyes shut for a few seconds, trying to keep the tears from falling. Harry didn’t understand why she was crying as he was the only one who had the right to cry right about now!
he! How dare he give Harry hope for something more than friendship and talk about him like that behind his back! Harry deserved everything and more; how dare he use him like that! She had
Harry rushed over to Draco's humongous bed, shot a cutting hex towards the satin bedding and ripped long pieces of cloth out of it, ignoring Draco's pleas to abandon him and get himself to safety. The blond was a bloody fool if he thought he would listen.

felt like Malfoy had changed, then she would find it in herself to open up and maybe even trust him in the future.
She stood there, trembling and breathing rapidly, staring daggers at her husband who stood in front of them, a shocked expression on his face and completely frozen. “You will accept his decision,” she said in a much quieter voice, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him out of the room, leaving her husband behind.
Betrothed or not betrothed - Draco Malfoy is in love with Harry Potter. But the betrothal between the youngest Greengrass and only Malfoy heir is a binding contract. What to do to change the wizard's mind in the matter of love? Daphne knows.
Sitting at a table with Malfoy now, having burning candles between them, the silver crockery glistening beautifully, he had to ask himself whether Hermione had been right the whole time.
Surprised, the young couple at the lake turned around, only to see a very pissed off Harry Potter march their way. Blaise gulped, Hermione just barely managed to keep from rolling her eyes.
Head held low, he walked through the Entrance Hall, and shuffled through people who had started on the preparation and through those, who were wandering around aimlessly, still in shock of what had happened.
Her broken form was surrounded by hooded figures, most of whom had their wands drawn and either pointed at the crying girl or loosely at their sides. The sight before him made him want to reach into his cloak, grab his wand, and curse every single witch and wizard in this room because he was sure that the innocent girl lying at the mercy of the Death Eaters was a Muggle.
Had she just made a mistake? She couldn’t help but ask herself whether there had been another way. But, no! No, Harry had needed to know! She had done the right thing. He would get over it, and she would make sure that Malfoy would never forget what it meant to hurt her best friend.
Throwing a glance over his shoulder, Draco tried to push the stubborn Pansy out of the bedroom. "Just leave, damn it! Leave before Harry-"
. Being part of a pure-blood line and being male held high responsibilities. He had to carry on the line of his family name. He wouldn’t be able to do so without a pure-blood woman by his side.
Harry gazed up into those bright grey eyes that he adored so much and held his breath. He didn’t know what he wanted to hear but he needed to hear
were the one who kept telling me that once it was all over I could finally live a life that I deserved. Those were
Slowly, he shook his head. “I don’t know,” he whispered, his silver eyes leaving the loving embrace of the emerald ones looking at him. “I was unconscious.”
A perfectly shaped black eyebrow rose and Draco took that as his sign to get going. So he took a deep breath and told him everything. He told him about Pansy’s idea with the bet, him accepting it in order to prove not only her but himself that yes, he could manage to manipulate someone as powerful as Harry, but also that – his voice hitched slightly. He wanted to see whether all the things he had noticed in the past were mere imagination, normal things that everyone would notice or whether they had their origin in something more meaningful, something his family was sure to use as a reason to disinherit him. According to his family it was a shame for a pure-blood wizard to be attracted to…
“So, I came to apologize to you about… everything. I’m sorry about how I acted, how Pansy acted, that Pansy was even
different. It might not even be that we’re different. Maybe the straight people are different? At least that’s what I’m trying to tell me.”
?” Harry chuckled darkly as he sat up straight, causing Hermione to sink back into herself. “Do you even listen to yourself, Hermione?
Everytime his Death Eater relatives had left him alone, which hadn’t been all that often, he had tried to listen to Potterwatch, a secret radio show he had found by accident. They never said anything about how Harry was or whether they had been in contact with him, but, as they had always repeated, in that case
Hearing the people laugh and chat happily without a care or regret in their minds was disgusting. All Harry could think of when he thought of that night three years ago was how many lives had been ended brutally or destroyed completely, only because of one insane monster, who couldn’t understand that there was more in life than power, fear and immortality.
His narrowed eyes searched Draco's silver ones, demanding, pleading for an explanation, but Draco could only open his mouth, unable to give him what he so much longed for. He needed to explain that this wasn't what it looked like, that this wasn't what Harry was thinking, but it
And just like that, all the agony he had felt until then vanished, leaving behind nothing but cold emptiness. Draco hadn't even fought for him. He had just accepted it without trying to convince him otherwise and left.
"I don't think of this as a fling, Harry," his voice was seductive as he leaned forward and started to nibble at his neck, succeeding in sending pleasant shivers down Harry's spine. "I've thought about this for a while now and I just cannot wait any longer. I have changed, Harry. Please, believe me, I have. I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do, so if you're not ready or don't feel the same-"
First, Harry’s over enthusiastic behaviour after such a wonderful and special night like the last one and now
"Messed up!" The answer burst out of Harry like an explosion. It was as if something had broken inside of him in that moment, as every scenario washed over him again. Every moment that Draco had disappointed him, every moment Harry had relied on him only to be proven wrong, assaulted his already aching mind and heart. He couldn't do this any longer! He just couldn't!
I hope you liked that one! I definitely had a lot of fun writing it (probably a bit too much fun *laughs*)
Ron scoffed and moved forward to Hermione, who was still kneeling on the floor, staring up at Harry with teary eyes. She didn’t move as he tried to pry her away from the chair Harry had sat in mere moments ago.
He was crying heavily now, tears flowing freely over his cheeks without being wiped away. And Draco just stood there in the doorway, hands on each side of his body, doing nothing. He just looked at him. And did nothing.
He ran his hand over his wet face. There was no use beating himself up over it. It happened and by tomorrow, the whole wizarding world would know he was gay and easy to get. He sighed and stood up. He had to get on with his life and he had to get over this stupid trap, but most importantly, he had to get in touch with Hermione. She would know what to do!
One glance towards the red-haired boy standing to his right told him what his once best friend was thinking of him. The disgust in his blue eyes was obvious. He had seen it lurk in the background ever since he had told them about Draco, but choosing his boyfriend over his best friend which he no doubt thought this had been about had brought it all to the front. In an oddly satisfying way Harry was glad that it had happened that way. Seeing the true side of his friend hurt, yes, it hurt a lot, but he was also thankful for knowing that this side existed.
Shocked grey eyes that were impossibly wide were the last thing he saw before he felt a blinding pain shoot through his right leg as he hit the ground. A snapping sound told him that his leg had been snapped in two.
Malfoy had taken a step forward and had started to peal his coat off his shoulders, his warm, big hands lingering a little longer than they normally would, would this be a
"You will do as I say, Draco. This betrothal got arranged before you were even born. You will be obedient and marry Astoria Greengrass. And no complaint!"
I had to write about the Beast Division (Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures) of the Ministry of Magic.
Confused and somewhat dizzy, he turned to look at what Malfoy found so interesting that it was worth stopping his explanation and talk with him. He blinked as a bright light blinded him for a second. "What the-"
He knew everything. No, not everything, he thought desperately. An image of a laughing black-haired boy filled his mind. He would be dead if Voldemort found out.
She frowned. Next to her, Dean glanced up from his spot on the ground. He had somehow managed to lie down on the floor, press his cheek onto the cold and dusty stone floor and tried to sneak a glance through the small space in between the ground and the door. Ginny huffed.
Draco ground his teeth and forced himself to stay rooted to the spot. He needed to find Harry. He couldn’t think about what people might do or yell once they’d seen him. All he wanted, all he
"Where are we heading to anyway? The Leaky Cauldron?" Potter tapped his wand against the door knob and they could hear a soft
Harry smiled and cuddled closer to the blond. “They asked me to...” He swallowed and pressed his eyes shut tightly. His breathing got faster, more laboured and he felt himself being pulled into a tight embrace.
“Believe me, I’ve tried everything. I’ve talked to my parents about it – without telling them anything specific, of course. They don’t know the reason why I asked. I guess they think I’m interested in carrying on the Malfoy name and want to do it perfectly. I’ve tried talking to Pansy, but you’ve seen how she’s acting. She wouldn’t understand. I’ve considered talking to Blaise as there have been rumours in Hogwarts that he might not be straight either, but I didn’t want to risk either his or my reputation by asking, in case those rumours were just rumours indeed.
Draco stopped walking and leaned his forehead against the cold stone wall to his right. He was close to the Potions classroom and he could smell the fumes wafting through the corridor. Having all this probably toxic or at least unhealthy mist floating around him didn’t exactly make it easy for him to get back into the right state of mind. He knew where that thought had come from if he was completely honest with himself, but he refused to dwell on those feelings. He had sworn to himself to never act on them! He was a
A girl, about the same age as Draco himself, lay on the floor. She had bruises and scratches all over her thin body. Her clothes were ripped and covered in blood, her hair matted and in knots. She was trembling and flinching; her sobs jumped back from the cold walls of the small room. Draco could see deep wounds in her forearms and one in the skin of her left shin that was peeking out of a rip in the material of her jeans. Something cream-coloured made a stark contrast to the deep red blood covering her right hand.
Why did he even bother to leave the somewhat warm Common Room in favour of the cold stone halls of Hogwarts?
Draco gulped. He had figured as much since the wound had not healed fully yet, so if he was being honest with himself, he wasn’t that surprised.
“Well, what do you suppose should have happened?” She hissed quietly and annoyed, both with him, herself and the two lovebirds outside the dirty broom cupboard they were hiding in which was filled with dusty, old brooms, rusty buckets and bottles of unknown liquids... and probably about a hundred or so spiders hiding behind the items stored in there.
Draco shook his head slowly as the antics of the man who people saw as a war hero, who was currently grinning cheekily at him.
"Oh, we've been very well, thank you. Just missing you, that's all." And with that, she was off. She kicked off her shoes and hurried into the kitchen, probably looking for a snack.
"The potion seeps through the skin into the blood system. I don't want to spell myself, now do I? I would instantly fall in love with dear Draco here and none of us needs another one that's running after that damn pureblood."
The bright green eyes behind the round spectacles narrowed dangerously as they watched every single student climbing up the stairs from the dungeon. As the last two – Crabbe and Goyle – shot him death glares, he knew something wasn’t right.
Just a mere twenty metres away from Harry, Draco stood in the biggest parlour of his mansion, pacing back and forth nervously, trying to get his confused and illogical thoughts back into order and
“I hope she’s somewhere near,” Hermione said as she cleared her throat before Draco could ask who she was talking about. “Fat Lady? Hello?”
"Of course, I know you’d choose differently. You’re not one of his followers. And I will always be by your side, love. No matter what you say or decide, you won't make me leave you. My life is dangerous as it is, it can't really get any worse."
She gritted her teeth as she glared at the old leather-bound book in front of her. Books had never failed her before and she wouldn’t let this stupid essay cause her to feel as if they did now!
Someone, he figured it had been Hermione, had taken off his shoes, and had neatly put them next to the bed. Mud had fallen off its sides and had spread on the floor.
Draco had the decency to look sheepish as he stood there, wringing his hands nervously. It was a very uncharacteristic gesture for him, but Harry only registered it incidentally, not paying it any mind. He was furious, a seething ball of anger and fury within him begging to be let out as Draco continued to look as if this wasn't a monumental event.
Shaking his head, Harry exhaled shakily and glanced to the young Slytherin sitting next to him. A frown darkened his beautiful and flawless face and Harry complied with the urge of raising his hand and gently rubbing at the wrinkle between two perfectly formed blond eyebrows. A soft smile and a roll of light grey eyes were his reward.
"I thought this would be more fitting." Harry's eyes jumped up and locked with Malfoy's pale grey ones. He had never noticed that they had a slight blue tint in them, giving them the look of ice crystals. "When I asked you out yesterday morning, I wasn't just asking for forgiveness or whatever people like me should ask for. I know this might seem strange and weird, considering how I have behaved in the past and you have no reason whatsoever to actually believe me now, but I…"
"You promised to keep it safe," he said as he fought back tears. He didn't know whether they were tears of anger or sorrow, but they might have very well been both. "You know how much that watch meant to me, and you promised to keep it safe!"
And all of a sudden, he wasn’t so sure whether he should enter this room. He didn’t belong here. The warm feeling that had engulfed him as he had entered through the portrait hole was exchanged by a cold sense of
, that the bet existed, that you had to find out that way, that I’ve hurt you, that I’ve-“ His rambling was stopped with two very soft lips pressing against his softly, melting against his. He gasped and Harry took this opportunity to run his tongue along Draco’s teeth, teasing and testing. A shudder ran down Draco’s spine and straight to his groin. He moaned softly as Harry’s hand touched his cheek gently, letting his tongue explore the insides of Draco’s wonderful tasting mouth.
“I don’t think we’ve been introduced yet,” he said and jerked his arm forward, successfully getting rid of the way too small and way too hot hand on it. “Harry Potter. Pleasure to meet you.”
Hermione scoffed and forced the dark-haired wizard to turn around. He looked completely lost, so unlike usual. “We’re not too late. Now listen to me, Harry. We will march in there. Well, you will. Underneath your cloak. Ron and I will create a diversion. Didn’t Draco once say that his father held peacocks? We’ll think of something. Once everyone is busy trying to figure out what’s going on, you sneak up the stairs and into Draco’s rooms. Once you’re in there, you get him out and we’ll apparate back to Grimmauld Place.”
“He should not be nervous, my dear sniffling servant. He should embrace the opportunity instead of acting like a filthy blood traitor.”
"Oh, come off it, Hermione. We're just going to go drink a butterbeer and maybe a firewhiskey in a pub. He asked me to meet with him to catch up and get over our past, not to shag him!"
“He’s messing with you! I just overheard him saying that he was just being polite about everything and didn’t want to insult you by directly telling you that he isn’t interested.” He didn’t need to know all of the insulting details. That would hurt him even more, no matter how much he found out, and she really didn’t want him to break apart completely. Not if she could do something about it.
Ginny turned around the next corner, still deep in her musings, as she heard a familiar voice echo through the hallway in front of her. She stopped abruptly, blinking. Behind her in the adjoining hallway, she could hear a group of students approaching, babbling loudly about Quidditch. Heart beating fast, she looked for a hiding place before she spotted a suit of armour that would do a perfect job.
Harry chuckled softly as he grabbed the rolling pin. "But don't forget the flour," he repeated before grabbing what was left of his stock and dusting the dough with it. "Because otherwise, I can't really make a pie out of it."
“I said let them. I know their behaviour is wrong, but I understand it. Really, I do. Just try and put yourself into their position,” he added as the green eyes continued to look at him with a mix of wonder and confusion. “If you’d be in their place and have a friend of yours suddenly go out with, let’s say, Nott,” Harry cringed and Draco grinned suggestively, “you’d think there was something fishy about it, wouldn’t you? And if you’d want to find every evil on this planet and truly think you could use that connection between the good side and the evil side that so conveniently presented itself to you, wouldn’t you want to make use of it as well?”
He hated the thought, but he had been one of those people. He had been too scared to do anything but follow. He hadn’t wanted to, but he had done it either way. It didn’t matter that he told himself he’d only done it to protect his family. That was just a way to justify what he had done or helped doing.
Hermione choked as a roar of applause and whistles greeted them and forced them to enter the overly decorated room full of eager wizards and witches, who eyed them with both pride and awe. Harry put on a bright – but fake – smile as he dragged a dumbstruck Hermione and an itching Ron  through the masses towards the podium, where a young witch stood, beaming down at them. She reached out with her hand as Harry and his two friends set a foot on the stairs leading onto the podium and immediately pulled Harry onto the stage, positioning herself right next to him and batting her eyelashes at him flirtatiously.
Silence followed the sisters' words as they watched the couple at the Gryffindor table giggle and steal a kiss every once in a while.
“This whole I’m-untouchable-and-emotionless-thing you have going on since I know you. Why are you doing this?”
Ginny wondered as she strained to hear what the two were saying. They had to be talking about Harry, right? Who else was there? It was obvious to everyone but the two that Harry liked Malfoy and Malfoy liked Harry. Those looks, those gestures, those
Draco's lips twitched into a weak smile. He was in heaven. His suffering had had an end after all, and he was in his personal paradise. But why did every single breath hurt as if his entire being was on fire? A painful groan escaped his lips. Everything hurt. His bones were feeling as if they were shattered in tiny, sharp pieces that were digging their way into his organs, tissues and muscles. He couldn't breathe. Every breath he took burned down his dry thought, all the way into his lungs where the heat spread. He tried to move, but a blissfully cool hand held him down.
Malfoy blinked and turned to Nott, who merely shrugged. He didn’t look at all worried at her confrontation. “What exactly did I do, Weasley?” Malfoy sounded oddly tentative as he looked up at her.
“Shh, it’s alright,” Draco whispered and kissed the top of his unruly hair, sniffling a bit as the stubborn strands tickled his nose. “You can tell me. I’ll behave.”
Blaise looked at her incredulously as if she had lost her mind. “I would remember if it had been going on for longer than that.”
“It’s from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures,” he said in a low voice, his eyes never leaving mine.
“Hello father,” he said politely, because there wasn’t any love between them. He respected the man who sired him, but that was all.
Draco jumped and nearly dropped the bottle of expensive wine. "Y-Yes. Yes, of course, I'm okay. Please, take a seat." He pointed towards the loveseat that stood in front of the fireplace. With a flick of his wand a fire erupted in the hearth.
“I’m so sorry I knocked you over!” Blaise Zabini said as he pulled her to her feet and behind a huge wooden bookshelf. “He kissed me!“ He hissed as peeked around the corner of the shelf they were currently hiding behind.
“Draco isn’t a Death Eater,” Harry hissed. His eyes narrowed as he watched Hermione move nervously from one foot to the other.
Draco was taken aback and gaped at the black-haired wizard, who had a cute frown on his face. Those brilliant green eyes bore into his silver ones, giving him the feeling of being read like an open book. He blinked. He didn’t know, did he? He gulped. He hoped not. He didn’t want the world to know that he wasn’t that bad of a guy. Well, maybe he did, but he didn’t want to be seen with the man of his dreams like this, talking civilly and probably destroying Harry’s popularity in the wizarding world just because he didn’t hate the
Harry looked over his shoulder and sighed with relief as he saw non-other than Draco Malfoy walk towards them, an empty glass in his hand and looking adorably confused. Harry’s blush deepened as he noticed that Emily Ackland’s hand was still clutching his like it was some kind of extra slippery fish that needed to be contained.
“Didn’t you want her to come in and take a picture of me after we’ve spent the night together? Didn’t you want her to follow us for the whole evening and collect proof that I am very much not straight? That I am as gay as a man can be? Didn’t you plan for that to happen?” He screamed and pointed his finger at Draco, who started to tremble slightly. “Don’t tell me you didn’t plan for everything to happen, because you did!” He huffed and took a deep breath to calm himself down.
Nobody but Draco had known that he would be anything but a loyal servant. He hadn’t wanted to be a servant at all. It hadn’t been his decision as his father had woken him up one morning during summer break, had told him to get dressed in his finest robes and had taken him to his initiation ceremony. He had been forced to bow to the monster himself, standing in front of huddling and trembling cowards, and kiss his muddy boots. He had never felt so embarrassed and ashamed of himself as a person.
The thin witch turned around, eyes widening when she set her eyes on the blond. “Draco?” she exclaimed, not believing what she saw.
Dumbledore looked at him over his half moon shaped glasses that perched on the bridge of his nose. His fingers intertwined as he patiently waited for Harry to regain his ability to think and understand the spoken words.
Harry smiled at that and looked up at a softly glowing face that looked even more beautiful in the flickering lights of the warm fire they were still sitting in front of.
Shaking his head, Draco watched as relief lightened the blond woman’s face. “No, nothing bad happened. But I do have something that I need to tell you. You and –“
"It was almost too easy," Draco laughed as he opened the house door to welcome Pansy inside. "It was like he seemed to be waiting for it to happen."
He had always laughed at Harry as he had said that everyone had all of the four Hogwarts houses inside them. Everyone was as brave as a Gryffindor if the time for courage came, everyone was as cunning as a Slytherin when stubbornness was the only thing saving your life, everyone was as smart as a Ravenclaw when they were forced to use their brain, and everyone was as loyal as a Hufflepuff once they had found a reason to stay put and believe. Facing his situation now, he figured it was time to channel some of that lion that is supposed to sit somewhere deep down in his heart.
After a while, he reached the top of the stairs. A lone window overlooked the roofs of the castle that stood in stark contrast to the rising sun at the horizon.
Laughing people were mingling in the dome-like room, chatting to one another and overall waiting for the person of the evening to arrive. Said person stood in the shadows at the entrance and refused to set a foot in that nightmare of a party.
"Don't believe a single word she says, mate," Ron said seriously as he pushed the bowl with the broccoli filling into Harry's hands. "She's getting scary, honestly. Last week, she woke me up in the middle of the night saying she wanted oysters." He blinked, eyes big. "Where the
Harry groaned and rubbed the famous scar on his forehead. Why had he even bothered to come? It was sure to be some kind of crazed and infatuated student who would just love to get a hug or even a kiss out of him. Running a hand through his hair, he slowly turned to leave the cold corridor.
"Ah, I'm glad," Ginny smiled innocently and turned towards Dean. "What do you think? Should we make a short trip to the kitchens and have some delicious cupcakes for celebration?"
“They’ll get over it,” the black-haired wizards said in a low voice and kissed the top of the blonde’s head.
That time, seeing him with a bloated and burned face, a determination so sickening and incredible that he had felt his stomach drop... His breath caught in his throat as he looked at his trembling hand, still holding onto the door knob.
had indeed been a Death Eater himself, bearing the Mark and all, he had merely said that the consequences of not acting after his parents’ wish would have been even worse. Since Draco had never actually killed anybody, and had only tortured people while at the wrong end of Voldemort’s wand, he was not to be called responsible for his actions during the war. Having saved the Golden Boy’s life certainly helped with that request, which Harry had mentioned more than once.
“See? Everything’s alright.” Harry smiled and let himself fall back into the uncomfortable-looking wooden chair next to the blond’s bed. “Everything that we’ll have left of this night is the wound on your arm, and that will hopefully fade with time.”
A house elf, dressed in dirty rags, came shuffling through the door at the very end of the long hallway. It was carrying a bucket and a piece of cloth, muttering softly to itself.
, or whatever it was they were calling him now. He had lost count after the Boy-Who-Lived-And-Conquered thing…
He wanted to think that he was better – that he was a good person. No matter how often Harry had told him otherwise, he knew that good people didn’t do what he had done.
“Nothing!” he exclaimed a bit too quickly. Draco raised his eyebrows sceptically, waiting for the common sense of his opposite to kick in. “Well, not nothing, but everything is fine now. They are fine, I mean. Well....”
A hectic look towards the clock hanging on the wall made him curse. Draco would be there in twenty minutes for date night and Harry still needed to change and—he lifted his left arm and sniffed. Okay, first and foremost—he needed a shower. Desperately.
sceptically. Hadn't Malfoy said they'd go to a pub to catch up? He hadn't told him anything about going to a restaurant like a… A blush threatened to creep up his neck.
Draco groaned softly, and pressed the golden satin pillow he had grabbed off of the couch onto his arm.
His thoughts wandered to non-other than Draco Malfoy. After the war, Harry had focused all his power onto the trial of one white-blond wizard, who was trying to avert a future ‘life’ in Azkaban. Being the son of two Death Eaters that used to be in Voldemort’s inner circle, bearing the Mark himself and having a history of dark activities under the name of the Dark Lord had not exactly been positive for him and Harry had known that. He had been the only one that had seen the other side of the dark boy – he had seen the fear in those silver eyes, the worry in the lines on his alabaster skin and the uncertainty in the posture of his lithe body.
Granger lowered her hand and studied us for a long moment. Her gaze stopped at Harry’s hand that rested on top of my knee. She sighed. “Nothing bad is going to happen,” her voice was soft. I didn’t know she could sound like that. “They’re just going to ask him a few questions like ‘Did you know about your heritage beforehand?’ or ‘Why didn’t you register as a Veela?’. They won’t condemn him for what he is.”
“You know what? Hermione warned me. She told me that I should be cautious around you, that you weren’t what or
Warm hands grabbed his trembling ones. His head jerked up and he saw brown eyes look at him encouragingly. Hermione smiled. “Everything will be alright,” she said, her eyes never leaving his frightened ones. “You’re not alone.”
He should be used to it by now, he told himself and sank to the ground, trying to enjoy the hot rain. He was used to everyone wanting to know what was going on in his private life, his
He had not raised his hand to touch the window, as the door was pushed open and his fate stood in the doorway, successfully blocking all possibly escape routes. Why had he not taken the offer when he had still been able to?! Stay. How could one word hold so much power?
me,” the fuming man scoffed and pushed out of his chair. He had too much energy flowing through his system right now. He needed to calm down somewhat before he completely lost whatever was left of his control on his magic.
words, Hermione. Not mine. And now you’re telling me that you lied all along? That although I have fulfilled what Voldemort and the entire Wizarding World thought to be my duty, I have to still do whatever the important and influential people need me to do because no-one else will do it?”
"I can't rely on you anymore," Harry said softly before wiping the tears away from his eyes. They were obstructing his view and he needed this moment to really look at the love of his life for the last time.
This wasn’t right. They had to see that this was so wrong that nobody who was truly sane could believe this bullshit! But they didn’t.
He didn’t know how long they stayed like this, kissing as if their lives depended on it – maybe they did – but as Harry finally pulled away, his eyes were anything but gentle. He glared at the blond and the Malfoy heir could literally see smoke come off of the man who had just taken his breath away.
Draco cursed, grabbed the blanket tighter and made to run out of the room and after the dark-haired man that was rushing out of the house at this very moment and maybe even out of his life if

It’s been about half an hour, maybe slightly longer, since Lucius had thrown Draco back into his room, pushing him to the ground. With a last nasty sneer, he had slammed the door shut, sealing it with multiple charms to make sure he would not get out of this posh prison. He didn’t even have his wand on him. He wouldn’t be able to leave even if he tried.
” It sounded more like a forced, somewhat painful question than something that’s supposed to reassure me. “You’ll see, they’ll just ask a few innocent questions.”
"Shh, I'm here," his boyfriend said calmingly and gently brushed the sweaty hair out of his thin face. "I'm gonna get you out of here, Draco. Ron and Hermione are waiting outside. We'll get you out of here."
