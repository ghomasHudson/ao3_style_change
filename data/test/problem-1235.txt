Despite Harry’s happiness that they were all getting along, courting gifts of the past a silly Hogwarts memory, he couldn’t help but feel exhausted by the constant interaction day in and day out. He still had a ways to go in terms of his anxiety, and not having moments of respite were beginning to wear down on him. At least the Golden Trio left one another alone to think in the evenings—Draco seemed to be making up for lost time with how he was continually joined at the hip. It made Harry happy to see that he hadn’t ruined it all but also completely exhausted with the constant interaction day and night.
And that was that. Still, the frown was firmly attached to his face as they drew nearer to the castle, not ready to face the ghosts of the final battle that waited inside its doors.
Lucius sighed. “I was trying to get you out of the Manor at that point. I didn’t need Voldemort experimenting on you or ordering you to complete impossible tasks that would have marred your soul. I wasn’t letting you get dragged down with me. It’s
Harry jumped, noticing Draco had woken up. "Don't worry about it," he offered in reply. "You look like you got some colour back. That's good. Are you feeling better?"
Fenrir frowned at him. “I gave you a nice room. Probably the best besides mine,” he mused. “I didn’t want to harm you but the Dark Lord is a bastard.” He wasn’t lying. Fenrir had ignored the cries and complaints from his pack when he let Draco settle in one of the largest set of rooms in their vast community, usually reserved for guests of honor, such as previous pack mates who have forged amiable connections with the wizarding world or potential allies. It was a lavish area, much like a penthouse apartment, with a large living area filled with plush couches, bookshelves, and other comforts, a kitchen and adjoining dining room, a beautifully pristine bathroom with a rain shower and tub not unlike the one in the Prefect’s bathroom, and a huge bedroom with a queen sized bed in the center. Draco had the realization that werewolves may live deep in the forests, but they still enjoyed the comforts of wizarding and city life, and worked to maintain those as well. But it was of no use.
Harry snorted. “Furry little problem.” It was nice to hear him laugh for a change. They sat in comfortable silence for awhile, Draco drawing small circles on Harry’s hand with his thumb.
Sirius grinned, looking down at his sapphire blue set. “Thanks, thought I’d bring a little colour to the Potions lab.” He looked over at Ron. “Alright, Ron?”
Draco rubbed Harry’s still scratched up arms from that, putting pressure on them and letting his magic heal them. Harry sighed at the touch: Draco’s magic always left him feeling warm and safe, and getting Voldemort’s marks off of him calmed him. “I can’t believe he was able to affect you physically. What if he were to try to kill you?”
Harry looked up at him as if noticing his presence for the first time. “Hi,” he responded, then dissolved into giggles, “don’t I know you from somewhere?”
“Oh no dear, Ron just can’t help himself. There’s a full spread in the kitchen—go on then.” Molly smiled warmly at Harry, ignoring Ron’s protesting in the background.
Draco tried not to tear up as he thought about his own father’s unwillingness to protect him in the face of adversity, yet this almost complete stranger was willing to freeze an entire battle just to make sure he was okay. It was almost too much. Attempting to remove himself from his thoughts, he wiggled his arm pathetically and said, “I can barely move this thing it hurts so badly.”
He visited his Dad by himself for a little while after dinner, leaving even Sirius behind. He wanted to have quality time with the man he spent his whole life wondering about but never had the chance to figure out. It was therapeutic to sit with his father in the Garden and decompress a bit about his anxious episode. James smiled in understanding as Harry recounted his panic attack, noting how Sirius handled the situation with a practiced ease.
“I do, actually. There’s nothing shameful about therapy. Harry’s been doing better from it, slowly but surely.”
“What does it say about me that I feel so bad for him?” Draco replied. “He tried to get Harry and the rest of us killed.”
Harry laughed. “You’ve never been good at that: definitely not your strong suit. Your aristocrat is rusty from living with Remus and Dad for so long.”
Harry changed tracks quickly, after realizing he was getting nowhere. “Well I’m here for a little while anyway. Dad can apparently access Bellatrix’s vault because it’s in the Black family holdings. He refuses to let me go so—I’m ‘resting’ while the ‘adults’ take over for a little while, I guess. Hermione and Ron are doing the same at Shell Cottage.”
She laughed. “Not quite. I wanted to let you know we have some scouts coming before the holiday break and was wondering if you had any interest in professional Quidditch. You definitely have the stuff from what I remember.”
Draco suddenly looked up from his own mug, ready to hear about the aftermath. “Blaise?” was the first question out of his mouth, silently ashamed that he didn’t ask about Harry.
“You helped—your information on the horcruxes were crucial to finishing it,” Harry said, feeling uncomfortable with the praise.
Sirius poured himself a bit of the vodka over some ice, pouring one for Remus as well. He handed the glass to him. “Here, you’re going to want this, probably.”
“I didn’t even know that was possible. I didn’t know a lot of things were possible.” Harry rubbed his face, suddenly tired. “Why would she do this?”
Harry scratched the back of his head nervously. “I mean, not really, no. With the horcrux I was sort of able to share vision with You-Know-Who—but that was the horcrux and I guess it was in real time. I looked up the Black family though, and premonitions are fairly common. I think I’ve been having some lately.”
Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione boarded the same carriage on the way to Hogwarts. Draco jumped involuntarily, as he now did, when he saw the Thestrals. He first saw them at the midpoint of Fifth Year, having witnessed multiple deaths over the winter holiday. He remembered screaming and gripping onto Blaise’s arm, startled by their leathery forms. Blaise had been kind to Draco then, gently helping him into the carriage and explaining what had happened. Blaise had always seen them: he saw his grandfather die when he was young. Draco couldn’t shake his weariness toward the creatures. Harry, on the other hand, patted them like they were old friends before boarding. Draco realized he must have been seeing them for awhile, witnessing Cedric Diggory’s death in Fourth Year. It saddened him to realize this, having been in his comfortable bubble even then. He certainly had changed in a short amount of time.
Regulus sighed sadly at Harry’s revelation. “I know. War is hard, especially on those who survive it and must deal with the aftermath.” He squeezed his nephew’s hand. “I’m thankful to you, though. You finished what I started. We’re all so thankful to you, you have to know that, both living and dead.”
and are bound to be exhausted.” At Harry’s non-answer, Turner continued. “It’s Dreamless Sleep. You have to be careful with this one—it’s addictive and can lose its edge if you take it too much. Usually we’d only prescribe it for once per week tops, but in extenuating circumstances we allow twice. There’s enough for twice per week for the next month. We can talk about it again next month if you’ll need to continue.”
Draco looked up from his tea at the rare bit of praise he’s heard Kingsley dole out. “It’s really just the stairs that get me tired,” Draco replied. “I’m feeling much better already, though. Thanks for walking with me.”
Harry seemed to welcome the barrage of Malfoy affection in the moment, but Blaise couldn’t help but notice the tired look in his eyes any time Draco left him alone for more than a minute. He’d deflate as soon as the blonde was out of sight, letting out a soft sigh. It was extremely apparent that he was not doing as well as he was letting on.
Harry shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. “It’s not so bad, really. I’ve been writing statements for the trials to be read since I can’t be there so that’s been taking up my free time. The rest is spent in therapy and testing while they try to figure out a solid treatment plan.”
“We do feel a bit ill, yes, but only when it draws very near. We rest for a few days after each transformation, as that does take its toll. The effects are generally worse on wolfsbane.”
Blaise’s eyes were shining with unshed tears and Draco looked away, not wanting to see his friend cry, nor did he want Blaise to see he was beginning to get upset as well.
He spent the moon with them and it was as freeing as he remembered. Running into the woods with the pack was unlike anything he had ever experienced. Not stuffed up in a room, not trapped inside his own mind, but
“Are you trying to kill yourself?” Harry asked him as the Healer settled Draco back into bed. He, too, wasn’t released just yet, still seeing a Mind Healer for long hours every day. It had something to do with having a horcrux inside of him that made the Healers cautious in releasing him too soon. “I thought that was my thing,” he quipped.
Finally, the mediwitch who led him to Harry’s room came in. Sirius sat up suddenly at her presence. “Well?” he asked, afraid to know the outcome.
The blonde shook his head. “I’m fine, honestly, just a bit of a headache. Thanks, though. I appreciate you willing to smuggle me into St. Mungo’s.” Remus released him, taking the sarcastic droll as evidence that Draco was, in fact, feeling fine. Draco looked towards the ceiling uncomfortably. “So, he’s really here, then?”
Despite Draco’s efforts to keep Harry away from the club, they made a reappearance every night for the majority of the rest of summer break. The days were back to the old Harry – moody and silent, smoking on the balcony, barking at people who wanted to ask if he was okay. The nights were reserved for this new Antares, lighting up the dance floor with a signature Potter grin, grinding up against men and women alike.
“Dru was worried about you running off this morning,” Remus commented, referring to one of the teen werewolves in the community.
Funerals would begin in the following week, with a large memorial service planned at Hogwarts. They were working on gathering the remaining Death Eaters for trial with the help of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. That made Harry’s interest pique—so they did turn away from Voldemort in the end. Lucius was still subject to a trial but would likely end up on house arrest due to his help in the months leading up to the final battle. Draco would be thrilled.
“I’m just being truthful. If I’m not leaving today, I’ll just be in my rooms.” He turned to go and was quickly grabbed by the good arm by Fenrir.
Draco laughed. “No. It’s really special, especially for those of us who don’t connect with the dead as easily as you can. The Veil is lower on Halloween night or Samhain and we invite our lost family and friends to celebrate with us. We keep a fire going, set our altars, and join together.”
Draco was the first to shake himself. “I’m fine. Let’s go to the apothecary, I need to restock some ingredients.”
“You can stand to rest. You can stand to work with the Mind Healers and get your mind right. It’s not your fault. None of it is your fault.”
“Not if they don’t know where I am. I can’t bear the Weasleys thinking I’d miss Fred’s funeral—I just
Sirius’s smile lost a little of its sparkle at the mention of Harry, the light leaving his eyes. “He’s alive, so from a physical standpoint, yes. A bit malnourished, having trouble sleeping, but they’re working on it.” He pulled out a mirror. “If you want to talk to him, you could use this, but Healer Turner seemed adamant about leaving him be for the rest of the week.”
Draco sighed. He had had it. “It means that we’re getting into a pattern of behavior again in which you get completely fucked up and come see me to hide from your feelings and I’m not doing this again.”
“I’m not willing to fight for a monster, sir. And if I continue to stay in my home I may have no choice,” the Malfoy heir explained. “I cannot possibly go back home this summer and face him; my father has obviously failed him in some way and I know I will get a death sentence in return. If I don’t have asylum, I’m dead either way. I’m not a fighter, sir, and I am not a monster.” Draco’s cheeks heated. He didn’t mean to say all of those things, but the words just tumbled out.
Draco sunk into the large deep soak tub in his and Remus’s apartment and let out an appreciative moan as the warm water soothed his aching muscles. He threw his swim trunks on in case Remus decided to join him even though they’ve seen each other bare more times than Draco would have liked: everyone in the village had as it came with the territory of the transformation. The werewolves living in the colony didn’t view nudity the way Draco was raised to feel about it but try as he might he would still feel embarrassed stripping down in the moonlight for the world to see.
“And what did you do, Theo?” Draco responded before he could help himself. He viewed James as family and the wolf inside him was responding in rage to his comments. “Oh, that’s right, you took The Mark because you’re a bloody coward.”
Harry nodded, not wanting to divulge anything too personal. “They have to run some more tests later but I just wanted to stop in and say hello before the rest of my day is taken up.”
Abbott laughed. “I’m honestly happy to get out of the hospital for a little while, I should be thanking
Getting close to the end of this story--do you want a sequel? What do you want to see happen with the characters after this arc? Let me know, you might inspire a sequel!
Remus pinched the bridge of his nose in a combination of frazzled nerves and overtiredness. He was in a mismatched jumper and slacks combination, alluding to the fact that he must have rushed over to the hospital during the night. Harry felt bad. “Just alert her next time, okay? I’ve had years taken off my life with that call; I thought you were abducted.”
The rest of his session with the Mind Healer was much more boring, with Harry recounting some successes of the summer and his return to Hogwarts. He noted he was unsure about what he wanted to do after school but was glad to have special work coming up with each of the professors.
“Imperio!” Draco felt a cloudiness wash over him. Suddenly his concerns for his parents did not seem very important to him. “Go down to the dungeon, Draco, and patiently wait.” That sounded like reasonable request, Draco thought. He calmly walked down into the dungeons, ignoring Lucius’s cries. He sat himself next to a man he did not know, who looked to be in some sort of distress. He smiled blandly at him, not hearing the door locking behind him.
It took him a few minutes to realize that someone was holding his hair back as he vomited over the side of the bed. His body was trembling as he laid back down and his father spelled away his sick. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you,” Harry mumbled as Sirius pressed a cold compress to his forehead, eyes crinkled in concern.
Turner frowned. “It could have opened you up more to it, but I think it has more to do with heritage and your family’s connection to the Veil. I want you to focus on meditating and perhaps even Occluding at night if you can manage and see what happens. We’ll meet next week and go from there.”
Draco closed his eyes and willed himself to calm down. He felt the pressure building behind his eye and knew his magic wasn’t far behind. He had to relax but he couldn’t even Occlude without risking his eye. What a disaster. His anger at his plight had been building like a festering wound and it would take an enormous amount of self-control to not take it all out on his father, even if he deserved it.
Draco frowned. “I dunno. With your and Sirius’s testimony, he probably won’t end up in Azkaban—probably some form of probation. I think he wants to start seeing me more now that everything is over.”
Remus was more amused than annoyed that his two quasi charges were front page news. “No, they don’t mention it. They just say he was in ‘grave peril.’ I think a student leaked the information. Must’ve seen you two getting escorted to St. Mungo’s. Myrtle was screaming about it from what I’ve gathered. Anyway, cheers, you’re a hero.”
Remus looked up at Draco in surprise. “What are you doing out of bed? You look like shite.” Draco shrugged, placing his hands on Remus’s leg. “No don’t—it stings—FUCK!” Draco snapped the leg back into place with a quick motion, flinging a nonverbal healing spell at it to boot. He sat back on his heels, feeling quite exhausted. Remus let out a shaky breath, more relief than pain in it. “I could’ve managed, Draco.”
He stopped at Draco’s door, frowning. He shouldn’t bother him, he thought. He was so tired, though, and he knew he’d probably let him in. He glanced over at Ron’s door. He couldn’t show up drunk in Ron’s bed—he’d be cross at him. He swallowed his nerves and chanced a knock.
“How did this happen?” Ron asked in disbelief, expecting only minor changes in appearance. Remus really didn’t prepare them for this.
Can you believe we're almost at the end of this story? Thanks so much for continuing to read and comment!
“It wasn’t just a random cup,” Draco defended. “I think it was tied to Hufflepuff? One of the founders. He seemed really concerned about it.”
“You sort of missed it,” a voice chimed in. Draco looked up suddenly and was pleased to see Jack there. Remus must have been really concerned to call him to Grimmauld.
Blaise laughed. “You two are hilarious. I’m going to say hi and get some intel while you discuss who is more protective of whom.”
“I’m walking around with a convicted murderer’s face, Draco.” Draco was surprised at being called by his first name again. Have they officially crossed the bridge of enemies into some strange friendship? He pushed those thoughts aside to attend to the newly minted Black. “If anything this just makes it more difficult for me.”
Draco reached out and Harry pulled further back. “It’s just because I was pulling dark magic out of Blaise—it was suffocating his core. I’m going to be fine.”
"I would but I think Remus would kill me if something happened to you and I wasn't around. He's very fond of you lately."
Sirius was having none of it. “And? I’m sure he can administer potions and get Harry set up. Can you set his arm here?”
Draco woke up the next morning in his bed and immediately felt ill. Sweat was pouring from his body and he wasn’t sure where he was. He tried to lift his arm to check the time and was met with excruciating pain. He cried out loudly. What had happened to him? He chanced a glance at his arm and saw that it was heavily bandaged from his bicep to a little over the crook of his elbow but blood was oozing through. The night came rushing back to him, causing him to lean over and empty the contents of his stomach on the hardwood floor.
“I’m sorry about that night, you know,” Draco said, startling Harry into looking at him. “I was just really worried about you; we all were. Getting cross and shutting you out wasn’t the best course of action, I realize.”
When he next awoke he surprisingly felt better. The fever had broken and he finally felt grounded enough to venture a walk into the living room, much to the surprise of his former professor. "You're moving!" He exclaimed happily.
“I think it has to do with fighting the adoption spell,” Harry lied. “I have more of the gene inside of me than normal. You look like you’re in your twenties,” he said, trying to distract the wizard.
The plan was deceptively simple, devised by the remaining faction of the Order. They would stage a coup for Hogwarts, largely dependent upon sneaking in without notice. Harry, happy to not be the one at the helm of planning for once, was surprised to learn that Ginny, Neville, and Luna of all people were the key to getting inside of the castle’s grounds unnoticed, through a secret entrance guarded by none other than Aberforth Dumbledore himself stationed at the Hog’s Head. It was almost too perfect when it came down to it: Harry, Hermione, and Ron would enter in first with the others arriving quietly thereafter. Of course, after successful venture into the castle, everything dissolved into chaos.
Sirius waved his hand dismissively at the pet name. “I’m only five years younger than you, Molly, no need to call me dear.”
Nonetheless, they ended up at the Burrow the next day, much to the chagrin of Sirius. It turned out that Dumbledore had tried to leave the sword of Gryffindor to Harry, although he did not have the right. Harry had realized that the sword would be able to destroy horcruxes, as it was impregnated with basilisk venom. The sword, however, was missing and was not Dumbledore’s to give. Harry was back to square one, but at least he was able to collaborate with the other two thirds of the golden trio.
Blaise and Pansy looked between one another. “Go on, darling,” Pansy drawled, reminding Harry of Draco’s over the top posh accent he put on sometimes. “But do be careful, the Chosen One has a knack for stealing all of my boyfriends.”
Harry’s eyes were brimming with unshed tears. He just felt so ashamed of what he had put everyone through. “I just wanted to see my dads. I was just so tired. I wanted the pain to stop,” he said quietly, finally admitting it outside of therapy, only for Remus to pull him back into a crushing embrace. “I’m sorry, Remus.”
“We won’t bring him to you if you can’t bear it. He just asks for you constantly so I said I’d ask you. He’s not entitled to your time, Draco.”
“I don’t trust him completely if that’s what you’re asking. I do know he’s probably our best shot at getting out of this alive. He knows the most about how to defeat a horcrux.”
He almost forgot about what was happening outside this insular bubble until Remus finally arrived a day after the moon, looking quite grim.
James ran with Sirius to the fireplace and threw Floo powder into the flames and suddenly his son was gone, leaving him alone in the house with a werewolf upstairs.
Madam Malkin seemed to pay him no mind at all, most likely not caring about pureblood politics enough to find a young Black suddenly popping up odd. His luck ran out when he was placed next to none other than Blaise Zabini to get measured. He eyed him as the magical measuring tape did its job, instantly recognizing him from the club. “Antares!” he exclaimed.
Sirius sat across the table from the three boys, reaching out for Harry’s free hand. “Should we try to get a dose of Dreamless for you? You haven’t taken it in a while—it should be okay. I can firecall Healer Turner and--”
When the opened the door they discovered Blaise on the other side, casually strolling down the corridor. When he saw them all he grinned. ‘I knew you were Potter,’ he said triumphantly, obviously putting two and two together regarding who was in the room.
There was an actual laugh that came from that and it sounded like bells. “I’m glad you didn’t, you know? I deserved some of those insults. My favourite was, and I quote, ‘you Merlin fucking green eyed goblin how
“I can take you to see Blaise—that shouldn’t be an issue.” Remus turned to him once they reached the Apparation point. “But, Draco—you should know he’s not awake yet. He’s still healing.”
Harry grinned at the joke but before he could reply, Lucius entered the sitting room. The Black Heir could feel Draco stiffen next to him. Lucius looked good despite everything. Paler than usual, probably due to being stuck inside for so long, but he gained some weight back and the bags under his eyes were less prominent. He was dressed in his favourite Muggle style: black slacks and a solid blue button down. He looked almost normal but Harry knew better.
“He’s not my husband, Parkinson.” Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling at Harry. He could tell he was very excited about this tryout. “That’s great, Haz.”
Harry rubbed his face in his hands. “I’m sorry—this is a lot for me to deal with. Everyone around me just keeps on dying or getting hurt and I’m just left here to deal.”
Draco was beginning to get worried now and tried to push the rising bile down as he spoke: “Why wouldn’t I be able to see? What’s wrong with my eye?”
At the mention of damage, Draco felt his magic rush to his fingers. He clenched his fists, willing the magic back into him. He’d probably die if he tried to heal Harry again. “Anyway, they’re running a bunch of tests and they can’t use magic to heal my arms so I get some cool new scars,” he continued, trying to make light of the situation but failing. “I just want this all to be over.”
“But I have my mother’s eyes. I have Lily’s eyes – everyone tells me that!” Harry was becoming more and more upset by the minute.
His Healer couldn’t contain her laughter at that one. “Sorry, love. Waking the patients after hours is against policy, especially famous ones.”
The night was set from there. Once Harry was drunk enough, he regaled them with the summer’s events, carefully editing out the parts with Draco. The whiskey had loosened his tongue, making it easier for him to admit out loud his new heritage to people other than his best friends. They swore not to spread it around; Harry wasn’t sure how much he trusted that. At the end of the night when the three were sleeping, Harry snuck out, making his way to the Prefect dorm.
Harry laughed. “A bit, yeah. I’ve never had a Dad before…a biological one, I mean. I feel like Remus is sometimes my dad with all of his fussing.”
Harry just gave a small chuckle. “How was your trip here? Sorry I didn’t say hello before you fell asleep, I was trying to catch up on school work so I don’t completely fail out.”
James sat across from the two and set his coffee mug on the table. “Your father snores so loudly, Harrison
However, Harry found that he wasn’t angry about Blaise’s presence—in fact, he was relieved. The entire time he was away with his friends, he had imagined the utter betrayal gracing Draco’s features for months on ends, wondering who knows what while toiling away at the Manor. Instead, Draco was surprisingly calm despite the initial outburst, having a friend to talk through much of the hurt. Harry was genuinely happy Blaise stayed behind and the three became quite inseparable.
Blaise led the Black Heir further back in the large compartment to a pretty secluded table in the corner. He cast a privacy charm around them and grinned. “What did I do today, Antares?”
Remus hummed in response. "Well the Order uses it now, a gift from Harry, really. Let's go in, shall we?"
The blonde cleared his throat, begging Merlin for some nerve. “I require asylum, Professor,” he managed.
“Where were you two?” he demanded. They had got to stop doing this to the poor man, Draco thought. He looked a bit crazed as he stared the two down.
Draco nodded again in understanding: sometimes he needed to grip onto Harry to make sure he was still breathing. The war had touched them all. “I get it.” He leaned into his father, who tightly wrapped his arms around him.
Once the rest of the students heading to class passed by he sat upon on of the large windowsills, drawing his knees up to his chest and closing his eyes.
He placed both of his hand over Blaise’s chest, directly above his core and began to work the dark magic out from around his best mate’s magical center. The dark magic was violent and didn’t want to go without a fight—Draco felt it pulling not only on Blaise’s magic but on his own as well as it desperately tried to keep hold of Blaise. Draco squeezed his eyes shut harder as he began to pull more of his own resources to break Blaise’s core free of the dark magic—he felt some sort of liquid running down his face as well as dizziness that was always a telltale sign he was overdoing it, but he’d worry about that later.
“Oh hah hah, Potter,” Draco bit back sarcastically, then continued quietly: “If you must know, I’m trying to recognize myself.”
James walked over and glanced into Draco’s basket. “Oh sugar quills! My absolute favourite. I’m just grabbing a few sweets and of course chocolate for Remus before we head over for lunch. We’ll see you there, yeah?”
Harry meanwhile was trying his best not to let his magic loose on his dorm. He felt their stares on the back of his head when they saw that his trunk was in its usual place. It still clearly said H.J. Potter, he noticed. They seemed to notice too. When he reached into his trunk for his pajamas Seamus spoke: “What are you doing? That’s Harry’s trunk.”
Draco turned to look at him, eyebrow raised. "I only apologize when I've done something wrong. How have I wronged you, Potter?"
“It’s fine,” Regulus waved him off. “I’m not mother. I’m capable of hearing critique without running off.”
The quill scratched angrily across the page as he let out all of his feelings on paper. He lost track of time as he wrote everything he wanted to scream at the Boy Who Lived. It wasn’t pretty. Eventually, the sound of footsteps and a knock at the door took him out of his concentrated frustrations. “What is it?” he called.
They all remained silent for awhile after that. “So this is the calm before the storm,” Lucius mused.
Harry shook his head. “I’ve been promised safety so many times before. Hogwarts was supposed to be safe.”
Draco wrinkled his nose in distaste. “Maybe Greyback will try to rip my arm off again when he gets back, provided he isn’t chucked into Azkaban. Was he working for Voldemort this entire time?”
“Alright.” He clapped his hands together. “I need to gather plans together for each year so I thought we could divide them up. I’ll take 6
Ron squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. “We have Aurors and Order members. It’s going to be okay. Nobody knows you look like this right now—it’s probably very safe. Malfoy is under protection as well. We’re going to get in and out, I promise.”
Severus just shook his head. “You’re disowned so anything you do won’t befall negatively on them. They are fine. Don’t fret about them.”
“Of course you can. You needn’t ask. He’ll be thrilled.” Sirius grinned at him. “What do you think, after dinner?” At Harry’s nod, Sirius squeezed his shoulder gently. “Perfect.”
Lucius frowned, not in a position to argue. “I’ve failed him as a father. It’s the most shameful thing I’ve ever done.”
Lucius only nodded and gave his son a tight grimace. “Me too.” Draco looked at him in silent thanks, but the malaise was still palpable.
“Yeah. When I told my parents my mum just told me to deal with it, even when he cracked a bunch of my ribs. All she could see was the family connection it would bring: she didn’t really care about what it would take for that connection.”
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand tightly. How could they let him get this far? “I had no idea. I’m so sorry.”
“Being out of Azkaban means nothing to me if you can’t bring yourself to look at me. Draco, I am so sorry for everything.”
Sirius wrapped an arm around Harry, who leaned into his father’s embrace. “It doesn’t have to be you, babe.”
“Another longstay? Please, I need to finish school. Everything else is fine.” Harry couldn’t imagine being stuck in St. Mungo’s again. There was no way. He’d rather be forced to stay home in the manor with a live-in Healer, he didn’t care if it would drain his entire Gringott’s account.
"You can call me Remus, you know," Remus corrected, but there was a grin on his face, happy to have talked Draco off the ledge. "At any rate, it seems as though your dramatic antics will balance out your roommate's: hopefully you won't rip each other's heads off."
Harry looked better than he did when he arrived. Though still gaunt with shadows marring his eyes, a shower did him wonders—his hair was gathered in a messy bun atop his head, matching his father’s usual style as of late. He had shaved, making his bone structure stick out even more so than when he arrived and a beard hid his thinness. He looked ill but he no longer looked as wild as the splinched man of only a few hours ago. Draco was both relieved and furious to see him in the kitchen like a ghost of happier days past.
When he returned to the castle for breakfast, Draco was at the Slytherin table with Pansy and Blaise. Waving at Ron and Hermione, he decided to sit with the snakes. “Oh look, it’s the sweaty savior,” Pansy drawled as he sat next to Draco. “Plug your noses, everyone.”
Dumbledore sat behind his desk, bright blue eyes examining Draco, making him feel as though he were being seen through. He doesn’t believe me, does he? Draco thought to himself, misery setting in. “Why don’t you have a cup of tea, Draco?” he responded, indicating to a mug and kettle. Veritaserum, Draco supposed. Well, if that was the way out, he would oblige.
Thanks for sticking around! I know it's been awhile but I have finally obtained my PhD! Planning on wrapping up this fic over the summer--as always, your comments and kudos are appreciated more than you know :)
Sirius nodded in understanding, thinking back to his bull-headedness in wanting Harry involved in everything Order related the previous year. “I think I was trying to be his friend more than his guardian. I wasn’t completely right in the head after everything. The Garden helped.”
“You’ll be able to see him soon, yes. We wanted to get his intake done and get him settled in his room. He’s on a private wing as requested. Nobody knows he’s here besides the support staff and those who tended to him in the trauma ward.”
“When did we become a war faction?” Ron mused. “I’m happy to go back to worrying about taking the right NEWTs.”
“We always have an altar at home,” Ron replied. “Besides, this year is different anyway. I need to connect.”
Narcissa pulled Draco into a hug once they crossed the threshold in the London residence. It was definitely smaller than the Manor but still sizeable and fashioned similarly. Harry hadn’t been there yet so he just took it all in.
Harry crossed his arms defensively. “I know a courting gift when I see one, Blaise—didn’t he tell you no?”
Draco let out a humourless laugh. “It’s funny, actually. My mind was more human during the full moons where I actually turned. Now, I’m just feral. I can’t take it much longer.”
increasing. Draco was so angry with himself. “I swear to Merlin if I have to have Christmas dinner with this shit hospital food I’m going to scream.” They stuck an IV back into his hand, much to Draco’s dismay. “Could’ve fucking warned me couldn’t’ve you?” he spat.
Remus laughed. “I doubt that, Draco.” Draco looked at him in disbelief. “Harry isn’t one to be prejudiced like that.” The blonde shrugged. Remus nudged him gently, shoulder to shoulder. “There’s no sense moping—what’s done is done. How have your healing practices been working?”
Draco closed his eyes and willed back tears. He hated how his pain potion pulled on his emotional side. “I just get so scared when I think about the Manor. As much as I miss Mother, I don’t want her to try and take me back there.”
“The wolf can be emotional. It opens an instinctual side to you. You’ve been battling health problems most of the time since your change. This side will take some getting used to. Even if you don’t have those feelings for Blaise anymore it’s still going to hurt. It’s going be alright.”
“He’s healing. Fenrir dug into his tendon when he bit him so he’ll be resting at the colony until after the full in a couple weeks. He wants to keep an eye on him to make sure everything is alright.”
His heart ached painfully at the thought of reuniting with his friends after taking off without so much as a goodbye. Was he ready to face them? He scrubbed his face tiredly but nodded. “Alright, I’ll go.”
Jack hummed in affirmation. “You look exhausted. I tried to clean you up a bit, but you’ll definitely need a shower when you’re up for it.”
Draco looked down at the letter in his hands, a small frown growing on his lips. Would he show Harry? The letters were honestly acting as a quasi diary at this point—some of his deepest thoughts and feelings were sealed in those envelopes. “I’m not sure. This is more cathartic than anything. Who knows if he’s even alive right now?”
Harry smiled at that. “Yes, actually. That’s been great. I just wish all of my visitors were as kind.”
He didn’t heed Fenrir’s words and hid out for the first few days, willing his arm to heal. He couldn’t cook with the state of his arm so Fenrir’s beta would bring him food every day. Jack was apparently Fenrir’s biological son, and he was much less broad and had a kinder face. He’d tut at his wound, stressing that Fenrir didn’t need to treat him like a rag doll, but from what Draco gathered, Fenrir was under the Dark Lord’s persuasion as well. Jack would stay and eat with Draco, knowing that while he wasn’t comfortable throwing himself into pack life just yet, he was probably in need of some semblance of company. As the days wore on, Draco began to feel a little more at home, and decided to venture outside.
Draco frowned in confusion. “Well, yes, but I thought it was a born wolf thing, or a pack thing. I didn’t think it could happen at any time.” He suddenly grew pale. “I could have turned Harry.”
Harry opened his eyes as tears began to well up. “I just don’t understand how I deserve this. Everyone has lost so much, why do I get to have a happy ending in this?”
“You’re seeing Healer Turner today, yes?” Draco asked carefully after he had spelled away the vomit and dug out a candle from his bed side table to get rid of the smell. Hermione had bought him a bunch of scented Muggle candles over the summer after learning that scent therapy seemed to help Draco calm down and he was quickly becoming a hoarder of all things mint, lavender, and apple.
Draco refrained from tutting sarcastically while he busied himself with putting his clothing into an empty wardrobe. “Sorry for dumping all of that on you before. It wasn't fair,” he managed to say. His back was to Harry but he could feel the golden boy's eyes on him. "What?"
Harry was happy to toast to that. He grinned at his two best mates. Ron looked to be turning a shade of purple and Hermione’s eyes began to spill over as everyone in the room echoed, “To Ron Weasley, to Hermione Granger.”
Blaise raised his hands in defeat. “I’m sorry I said anything—I can’t help that you’re dead on your feet at he doesn’t know how to leave well enough alone.”
Draco let out a snort, unable to keep it in. He enjoyed when Remus gave it back to Harry, who had been insufferable as of late. The glare was now aimed at Draco, who shrugged at it. “You don’t scare me, Potter, I lived with a Dark Lord for a year.”
Harry tried to push down the guilt he was feeling about everything, to no avail. “Still sorry, though. He was a good friend and an even better brother.”
Remus chuckled and Draco looked up in concern. What did he say? “You surprise me sometimes with your instincts. Yes, the scenting is important. A mark would be even better, but you would be hard pressed getting my father to risk the situation. He’s very protective as you know.”
Draco sighed. “I know.” He looked up at Bill who was focusing on setting up the equipment. He looked tired. “How is everyone?”
Seamus frowned, taking Harry’s form in. “Do you need a Healer? They’re all over the castle right now and a search committee’s been out looking for you.”
“Might be difficult,” Draco commented as Bill pushed the scanning equipment close to Draco’s face, causing him to flinch.
Draco instantly knew who it was before even seeing him and guilt welled up inside of him—shite, what would Harry say about his eye? He didn’t expect to run in to him but he also supposed he didn’t expect to find himself in the longstay wing at all.
“Do you have any patience?” he heard a very familiar voice drawl out. “I was all the way across the garden for Merlin’s sake.” There he was. Looking very much like his nephew, albeit with neater hair, Regulus Black was approaching him, a bit shiny around the edges but looking quite human and quite alive and quite young. It knocked the breath out of Draco—he forgot how low the veil was here.
"No," Remus replied. "For dumping the emotional baggage you've been holding in for a month on him. Besides, the two of you are roommates and I don't need you fighting all day long."
“Can I come in?” Harry slurred against Draco’s doorway, not caring for how voluminous his tone was nor the stares they were getting from Prefects passing by to their own rooms.
He heard Remus enter the house a few minutes into his bath and wondered if he would join him. The bath was large enough, considering it rivaled the size of the Prefects’ tub. He probably wondered where he went off to as Draco had snuck away around dawn to transform back in privacy in front of their building away from prying eyes. It had taken him awhile to shift back, the wolf wanting to front longer than he was used to.
“It doesn’t matter. I don’t know what your game is but I don’t think Draco wants to play. If you really want to be friends again I suggest you lay off a bit.”
Meanwhile, Harry was quite nervous to be seated on the train after the events that transpired. He wondered if the rumour mill had died down or if their return would freshen everyone’s minds. Mostly, he was nervous about his meeting with Dumbledore.
Harry shrugged. “I’ve been here for a few days and he’s grown on me. Prickly but knows what he’s doing.”
Draco winced and turned to Harry. “Are you ready for a parental meltdown?” he asked, hearing Remus running down the stairs at the sounds of Draco’s voice.
When they stepped back through to the Eighth Year Common Room, Draco pulled him into a hug. “You’re so good with parents,” he said, “even the ones who wanted you dead.”
Harry laughed. “Sorry. Coping mechanism. But seriously. Are you determined to be stuck here forever? You tore your core a bit again, it seems.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at that. “Well, we weren’t exactly in the talking mood the last I saw you, were we?”
Draco sighed and resisted the urge to pinch his nose. “You’ll obviously keep your room for when you want some space but I don’t mind us sleeping together—it’s not like we don’t do that at home.”
The blonde snorted. “Healers can’t take holidays: what if someone got hurt? Injuries are very common during Christmas, you know.”
“Already ruined, Potter,” Draco replied in jest. “I have a disownment and a furry little problem that I’m sure everyone will catch onto eventually.”
Draco huffed out a laugh. “Everything was fine until I went to Hogwarts, father. There was no Dark Lord destroying our family bit by bit as you worked like a slave for him. It wasn’t all blood supremacy and dark magic. We were
Draco gazed down at Harry and couldn’t help but smile at the view. His new, thick frames he got after shattering his in the horrid affair complimented his new looks well. Harry, sensing this, opened his eyes and glared. “What?” he asked.
“I’m fine—a little strain but nothing I can’t handle. They’re putting me in stasis tomorrow to get the dark magic out.”
“Oh hah-hah.” But he was grinning: always a Marauder. “What are you two lovebirds doing up so early, then?”
Harry just nodded, lost in his own anxious thoughts. What did Sirius know? Did Remus really tell him everything? Did he think less of him now? The shaking was getting worse as his thoughts spiraled out of control.
Draco smiled at that. “I feel really balanced. He said I wasn’t going to make it another full the way I was.”
When Harry returned to Grimmauld Place, almost everyone had gone to bed. Draco was in the tapestry room nursing a mug of hot chocolate opposite Remus. They were both facing the tapestry, away from the fireplace and seemed to be having a deep conversation, not noticing Harry stepping through.
“They’re at Bill’s safe. Once Harry found out I thought he’d pass out in relief. We sent him away to clean up before getting any information as to how he’s suddenly here, though. Sure we’ll get to the bottom of it soon.”
“Can’t let you wander the streets alone can I?” But Kingsley was smiling. He had taken to the demi-werewolf and his dry wit.
Remus stepped down into the tub from the opposite side, leaving a large gap of space in between them. Truly the tub was more of an inground pool or a spring, Draco supposed. He wondered if everyone had bathing quarters this large. Remus let out a similar sigh as Draco as he sank down: his bones must be tired as well.
“That would go great. I’m sure Weasley would be thrilled.” Draco refused to admit that he and Ron had nightly meetings about all sorts of things, starting with protecting Harry and ending with friendly chess matches. He didn’t want Harry knowing just how worried everyone has been about him, so much so that it was ending a blood feud.
Hermione snorted, finally responding in some way. “You didn’t seem to learn from those differences.”
Marlene stood and began adjusting her hood. “Right. Well, I’m off to the next room—I’ll check in on you before you leave and we’ll work out a contact schedule. It’s seriously great seeing you alive and breathing, Jamie.”
The moonlight shining on the greenery and flora made the garden seem more ethereal. Draco looked up at its waxing shape and wondered where they would place him for his transformation at Hogwarts. He sighed wearily thinking it was probably the dungeons. He’d have to ask Remus about it before they left.
Can you believe we're finally getting to the point that the oneshot was set at? Only took over a year ;). Obviously, this fic has turned into it's own realm so treat the oneshot as an AU to the AU as the plot has shifted and turned along the way.
Kingsley came to see them off this time, knowing that the train station would be filled to the brim with not only students and their families, but those hoping to catch a glimpse of the Savior of the Wizarding World after he disappeared for the entire summer post-Final Battle. Draco was thankful for the support, as the din of the station certainly made him feel anxious as people craned their necks to get a glance at Harry or at Draco’s eye or at a previously dead man or…he couldn’t
been through and lost so much. Your life has not exactly been easy, has it? You’ve been given a gift. It’s time to enjoy life. It’s time to have family. You don’t have to play perfect soldier anymore.”
The Healer interjected, “You’ll pass out from the pain if you don’t take something to alleviate it. I think you’re still in a bit of shock.”
It looked like he stopped at his home for a shower, as he wasn’t covered in blood and not dressed for battle, wearing a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt. Draco felt as though he could laugh at the sight if he weren’t in so much pain—not very intimidating garb for someone known as a baby snatcher.
Draco gave him a final squeeze and stepped back. “I love you too. I’ll stay safe as long as you do.”
Sirius shook his head in disdain. “I didn’t realize He was a Halfblood. I would have never thought it was a good idea if I did: of course He’d want to pick someone as like Him as possible. Should have done our research.”
“I, for one, am thrilled,” Blaise piped up. “I’ll finally have a decent defense professor again, thank Merlin.”
"I'd want a guard if I were you," Draco chances. Harry's head whipped up to meet his eyes. The fierceness in his green eyes was almost too much for Draco to bare. He raised his hands in defense. "I'm just saying, if there was a Dark Lord out to get me..."
“She doesn’t want to see such a coward and failure, dear Draco. She must miss his punishment,” Voldemort explained.
Draco didn’t know what to say. Harry was essentially baring his soul to him. “That was the most frightening thing I ever experienced. You with all that blood,” he said.
When they arrived at the safe house the next morning, Draco would see why Remus was walking on eggshells about who he was to stay with. "The safe house is Grimmauld, really?" Draco asked in disbelief as he read the address off of a bit of parchment just in front of the London abode.
“Shite. James!” Remus called towards the bedroom. “I need you to head off your son and lock the door on your way out.”
“You are staying out today. You’re going to meet your pack.” Draco paled at this. “Don’t do that, you’ll disappear.”
Hermione nodded eagerly. “I’d like that.” She turned to Ron. “What do you think? Everyone can be involved?”
“And I won’t have you die because you wouldn’t accept my help.” Draco was feeling his magic shoot down his arms as he imagined Harry being in peril. It made him a little dizzy and he willed it back. Maybe he wasn’t as up to the task as he’d like to be.
The next day, Draco heard Seamus loudly complaining that someone had tipped of McGonagall and his stash was taken away. Harry looked crushed but he could see the wheels turning in his head. Draco wondered if he could manage to knick Harry’s Invisibility Cloak so he couldn’t run off to a pub.
“Blaise was probably scared. Things are beginning to become very real. I’m not sure if you can find it in him to forgive him—Merlin knows if Sirius ever forgave me.”
Turner smiled in response. “That’s great—he needs a support system and as his father you should be at the center of that. If you approve of the schedule I handed you, I can have the mediwitch take you to his new room.”
Remus and Bill found Draco in the same spot where Bill had left him, head in his hands and curled up on a chair by the fireplace. Remus shut the door and walked over to kneel beside him. "Are you feeling sick?" He asked, placing a hand on Draco's shoulder. Draco wished he'd be less fatherly toward him – it was driving him spare with cognitive dissonance.
He found him in the dining area, drinking from a cup of coffee and reading the Daily Prophet. Harry’s picture was on the cover and Remus looked put off. “What’s with the mugshot?” Draco asked, gesturing toward the cover.
He unstopped the vial and set it on the tray table next to Blaise’s bed. “Don’t worry,” he said to his sleeping friend, “I’ve got you.”
The Headmaster wasn’t nearly as concerned that a student was imbibing on campus and causing destruction as McGonagall was. “Mr. Black is doing
Sirius pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. “Those Muggles. Yes, Harrison is your actual name. I swear if I ever run into them in a dark corner…”
Harry sighed. “Well, your mum, for one. She’s not technically accused of anything but I want to make sure it’s on the record that she helped me when it counted the most.”
He was wearing grey joggers and a dark green tshirt, wild dark hair falling messily into his eyes. His scars were prominently on display and he seemed at peace with it. “Looking very Slytherin,” Ginny commented.
There was also an American magic specialist there as well—they were well-versed in ridding manifested dark magic in the body. Harry told him all about his experience, and he severely hoped he wasn’t left vomiting on the floor after they decided treatment.
Nothing felt as good as running lately for Harry, whose anxiety had been manifesting itself more often due to his newfound channeling abilities. Healer Turner was considering changing up his potions routine, but for now, Harry was managing in other ways. Running and flying turned his brain off in a wonderful way: all he had to do was focus on moving and not worry about anything else. He wished Eighth Years were allowed on teams this year, but McGonagall thought it to be unfair. He ran by the Quidditch pitch where he saw Madam Hooch exiting the broom shed. She waved him over.
“Don’t you usually stay for the Halloween feast? You never go home for Samhain,” Blaise interjected.
“Draco shook his head. “No. Well, sort of I guess. But that’s not the reason. This is the Garden of Souls.” Harry’s face scrunched up in confusion. “The only connection to the Manor is through Grimmauld as those are Lord owned properties. Nobody who has intent to harm the Heir or Lord can come through the wards. It’s really old magic.”
“He was in jail for the majority of my life because of Ministry incompetence,” Harry spat bitterly. “I could have known my father in a way where he wasn’t so broken down. Whoever did this glamour took that from me. Why would someone do this?”
Ron and Hermione were also in good spirits: mainly to have Harry safe and alive, but also because he was going to have the opportunity to have a living parent. Even with a war looming, everyone seemed happy for it to be Christmastime.
“I do. I’m not the one on pain potions sobbing that I finally get to see my parents even if I’m in recovery
Harry blanched at that, sitting on Draco’s bed. “I know you’re angry, but the doe wasn’t malicious. I felt like I knew it. It was strange.”
Harry, apparently a light sleeper, jumped into action, wand pointed in Draco’s face. Draco, not one to show fear, just quirked an eyebrow as he waited for Harry to realize what was going on. Once recognition shone in the Chosen One’s eyes, they narrowed in exasperation. “You’re kidding, right? I could’ve hexed you.”
His father smiled gently at him. “It is one of my favourites,” he admitted. “It’s a comfort reading that someone’s life could be more insane than mine, though I suppose after the run we’ve had it’s not that much livelier.”
Draco startled awake at the sound of Harry’s voice calling from his mirror. He had drifted off early in the evening after a full day of testing and visits.
With the conversation moved away from Draco’s werewolf pack, the blonde felt more at ease. The rest of the visit was focused on Samhain and Harry’s newfound chanelling abilities.
a Malfoy. I can’t imagine being hired by anyone, much less the best hospital in Britain.” It stung to recognize that, and Draco felt the bile rise to his throat as he considered his future.
Draco let out a laugh: he knew just how to rile the Black Heir up and it made him joyous. “He hasn’t been sending courting gifts: just the cloak.”
Sirius sat back, Potions tasks abandoned. “I’d be less worried if Voldemort wasn’t contacting you, but channeling is a serious thing to be dealt with. It can drive you mad if you don’t learn to control it.”
Harry sighed. “You’re probably right. Hopefully your mum and her sister have some answers for me. I can’t keep going on like this.”
Sirius looked at him. “Fucking cheering charms. He was abusing cheering charms—the scan showed about 10 in recent bodily memory. Don’t they teach you in school anymore that overuse can make depression symptoms worse? That people who have felt suicidal should
Remus sighed. “Manically. They’re thinking he’s on the bipolar spectrum but haven’t officially diagnosed him. He’s been going to therapy and it seems to be helping him a lot. I’m sure you being back is also helping. He…” Remus stopped himself, unable to get it out.
Harry agreed, which filled him with both excitement and trepidation. At least he would be able to speak with others like him and potentially reclaim his nights but the thought of letting others in on his new secret was daunting. What if people began to ask favours of him? Spending all of his hours speaking with the dead didn’t sound like the most uplifting career path.
Harry stood. “Sure, Professor.” He caught Draco’s eyes as he left the hall—he seemed nervous. He gave him a small nod as if to show he was fine. It didn’t seem to help.
Before Draco could protest, Remus stepped in. "I think that's a great idea. Harry, would you help him to your room? I'll be up later to check on you."
The blond squeezed back and sighed. “I know. I know I made fun of Remus for his stress over the possibility of having to bite me last year, but it is daunting to force someone into a life like this.”
The older man was lying on the floor, leg twisted at an odd angle. Draco grimaced. “Leg doesn’t want to snap back?” he asked.
Fenrir just laughed, resting his hand on Draco’s useless arm. Draco winced. “Sorry about that—I might have gotten into the tendon a bit.”
He felt Bill’s steady hand on his shoulder, grounding him. “Draco is fine—he’s at the Greyback colony resting. Fenrir sent him there.”
Harry sighed and stood, resigning himself to the idea that the fun was officially over. Antares was dead.
Remus frowned. "It might gain suspicion, but I'm sure he could try. At least to let her know that you're okay."
Harry laughed. “We lost out on a lot of time last year is all. It was nice to exist like normal teenagers for once.”
“We don’t even know if he’ll be released in time for that. For all we know he’ll be in here until the Spring term.”
“He’ll be alright, Rem,” Jack soothed. “But he’s going to have to take really good care of himself between moons. He needs to eat properly, keep up his strength. He won’t survive otherwise. He needs to outfight his genetics.”
“Ah, yes. The lack of ageing thing. Didn’t you pay attention when Severus was trying to out me?” Remus joked.
“Well, you’re alive,” she finally said, dumbfounded. “I wonder how to file for an undoing of a Death Certificate,” she mused.
“A bit, yeah,” Ron replied. “It’s okay though. We’ll take you half-werewolf, too: full dark humour and all.”
” the two warned simultaneously, causing all of the teenagers to jump and look up. Remus cleared his throat. “We are going to Diagon Alley today,
“Malfoys are natural Healers,” Lucius explained. “Though, we haven’t had a Malfoy show traits of it in some time. And they usually don’t exert themselves to the point of exhaustion like you did. You must really care for Potter.”
“I know it’s not. But I want you to trust yourself: you really did something amazing last night. Not just keeping yourself in check—you helped so many people find closure. Don’t let a rogue transformation soil it or your relationship.”
Draco spent a lot of time writing letters after that initial meeting, reconciling his anger and sadness of Harry leaving with his newly repaired friendship with Blaise through words. When he wasn’t preoccupied with Order meetings or preparing for the worst, he was writing Harry letters about everything that was happening; what sort of plans were in place, where they thought he was, even funny things that Sirius and Remus did to cheer everyone up. He’d date and seal each one, placing them in a basket next to his desk. Hedwig would often look on, confused as to what the ex-Malfoy Heir was doing with all that parchment. Sometimes Ginny (before leaving for school) or Blaise would join him, sitting on his bed while he scratched away at his desk—Remus was right, it was comforting to have someone his age around.
Harry snorted in derision. “Right. That’s what this is about. Not that you’ve become the prat you’ve always been.”
The two were seated on opposite sides of Ron’s four-poster, Ron leaning back with his head resting on the headboard. He looked better, with color returned to his features. Harry was laying across the bottom of the bed on his back, his legs dangling over the sides. He still looked so small despite the summer of recovery: it would be an uphill battle.
Harry smiled at Draco, pulling him into a kiss. “It looks great, Draco. Thanks for doing this for Ron.”
Draco shrugged. “I dunno. But I always felt wrong when I’d be spiteful towards Granger or anyone deemed different. I don’t believe you should be judged on your blood status: it should be about abilities. Your side doesn’t stand for that.”
Draco stood at this, feeling immediately dizzy. "No way. Nope. I'm not getting weirder than this. Thanks, I'll risk it with the Wolfsbane." He made to leave but he swayed in his spot. Remus was by his side almost immediately, gingerly sitting him back down.
Sirius grinned. “That’s the best part!” he exclaimed. Harry looked up, temporarily offended until Sirius continued. “I’m not dead.”
The younger wolf flushed at that. “Do you think you would have stayed there if it weren’t for Sirius and James?”
“He’s so odd,” Draco commented as he watched James dash away, spring in his step. “How is anyone that chipper in the morning?”
Harry’s head was spinning trying to process this new information. He couldn’t be suggesting what Harry thought he was. “What are you trying to say?”
“Draco,” he exclaimed, standing up to greet him. He set the lifeline mug down and gripped Draco in a tight hug. “I didn’t know you were here.”
“Oh you decided to be Antares against the Headmaster’s wishes, then?” Draco crossed his arms, not thrilled to be dealing with a drunk Harry once again. He thought they put that behind them.
“I’m sorry I brought it up—I just haven’t been able to see anyone and wanted to make sure everyone was alright, considering.”
Harry jumped up as if Remus shocked him with his words. “Are you kidding me - I can’t go down there! I can’t handle the reaction right now.”
Pansy didn’t even look ashamed. “You weren’t at Hogwarts last year, Draco,” she replied, “you have no clue what we all went through.” She reached up and brushed a piece of hair out of Draco’s face. “Nice eye, darling: it’s dashing.”
Remus frowned and for a moment, Draco thought he made it worse. “He is. They think he’ll wake up sometime today, now.”
Draco spun to greet him. “You’re thinking of the old, bitter Draco—this one quite likes Bowie.” Taking the elder wolf in, he frowned. “You look tired, why don’t you sit down while we fix you something?”
Harry was sat at a workbench across from his father sorting ingredients out for the upcoming classes this week. “This way, we don’t have a free for all running to the cupboard,” Sirius had explained. “If it’s all measured out, they just need to prep the ingredients and go.”
“It means,” McGonagall replied, picking up where Sirius had left off, “that you will be completing an apprenticeship of sorts this school year, open to only 8th Years. For the first half of the year, you will be on rotation, aiding the faculty and staff. You’ll spend about two weeks in each position. Hopefully, by the holidays, you will have a clearer idea as to what you might like to do once you leave Hogwarts. Before Christmas, it is expected that you will send an owl with your top three preferences of continued apprenticeship and rationale. The remainder of the school year will focus on one or two of your choices more specifically where you will work with your mentor to craft a plan.”
Remus smoothed Draco’s hair back gently. “She wouldn’t do that to you. She knows where you need to be. You’re safe with me, I promise.” Draco nodded, willing himself to not think so much about what happens next. “Maybe we’ll get a Mind Healer in, yeah? They wanted to evaluate you anyway as your core grows to make sure you’re okay.”
Draco gave Harry a sideways glance before continuing. He was well aware that a new meltdown could be imminent. “Your magic has been a bit unruly as of late and it’s tied to your emotions. I think you need a Healer’s help to get some control over it.”
He sat across Draco from the table, picking up a biscuit. “Excuse me, Healer,” Draco said, looking up from his copy of the Daily Prophet, “Molly Weasley only bakes for me.”
Draco screaming covered in blood. Remus being ripped apart by his own clan. Hermione getting slashed by Bellatrix. Fred falling over, the light leaving his eyes as he’s hit with green light. Voldemort coming for Sirius just as he got him back.
Sirius sat back against the headboard, contemplating if he should really delve into his past. “I didn’t have the best upbringing.”
Remus frowned. “I really didn’t think that was the case.” He took a look at the blonde’s bandaged bicep and winced. “Did it open back up?”
Harry nodded at that, feeling less weary about this secret late night venture. He was quite surprised, however, when Draco led him to the tapestry room.
birthday, Harry finally decided to start speaking again: he had resolved to leave Draco at the Manor and protected, rather than bring him on the horcrux hunt. That should be enough to keep him away from the battle, he thought.
Remus eyed the two teenagers suspiciously. He knew they were sharing a room but to see the two interact like the Marauders used to all the while ignoring Ron and Hermione was more than odd. It seemed as though Harry and Draco screaming at one another leveled their hatred for one another out. Remus wasn't sure how he felt about that.
Draco shrugged. “It might not have come into full view until then, but watching my Dad torture innocent people really solidified the idea for me before that.” Hermione blanched in response, obviously regretting some of the bitingness in her tone. Draco shoved his self-protecting nature aside in favor of some Hufflepuff humbleness. “I’m not trying to justify my actions towards you—they were completely wrong and I made you feel like an outcast when you should have felt special. I just want to tell you that I’m learning and that I’m working to be better. I’m sorry, Hermione.”
Harry scrubbed his face in embarrassment. “Maybe I’m the jealous one—I’ve missed a lot of time with Draco, yet all I want is a nap. You got to be with him while I was, what did you call it, playing hero? I feel like a ponce about it—you pointing it out made me defensive.”
“I don’t want you to deal with it right now if you don’t have to. We’ll key Healer Turner into the wards and then get some CVs to see who is trustable to treat you.”
He grabbed a biscuit out of Mrs. Weasley’s goodies for him and stuffed it in his mouth to prevent any further embarrassment. His Healer didn’t need to wake Harry it seems, because the black-haired wonder in question was slowly passing by Draco’s room, much to Draco’s delight. “Harry! Am I psychic?” he wondered aloud through stuffed cheeks.
“Good morning,” Sirius replied. “You all have a meeting with me and Headmistress McGonagall in about an hour in your common room.”
Draco nodded in affirmation, deep in thought. In their silence, an owl flew through the window, dropping a letter on Harry’s lap. It had a Ministry seal on it. “What’s that?” Remus asked.
“Must be an interesting one. I did remind you I rarely get company from the living—could be quite boring.”
Dumbledore sighed, sitting back in his seat. “Your parents tried their best to protect you but it ultimately drew Voldemort even more to you. We couldn’t have known he was going for similarities rather than the ‘purest’ blood.”
“Please, the two of you have been obsessed with one another since you set eyes on each other,” Hermione said. It was Ron’s turn to snort.
“You’ll have time for that, I swear. You’re allowed to be happy it’s over and done with—even if you have apologies to make.”
“I dunno,” Draco commented wryly, “Sirius seems to have some Slytherin moxie in there somewhere with how covert he’s been about Harry’s return to the wild.”
Draco laughed. “I mean it, though. I know you’re scared but you can’t tell me you wouldn’t do the same.”
“Well yeah but that doesn’t mean I should be running around telling everyone. Not about public displays like that.”
It was Remus who sprang to his feet first, pulling Draco into a tight hug. “You’re so, so, stupid. Never do that to me ever again.”
“Malfoys are natural healers,” he replied defensively, but Ron echoing his father’s words were ringing in his ears. He felt so vulnerable. Everyone was going to know his feelings now. Especially with all of the “hero” nonsense in the news. He hoped it wouldn’t come back on his parents when Voldemort found out.
Draco wasn’t completely sure how they managed to sneak out, if they really did at all. He suspected there was an Order member or Auror lurking somewhere in the vicinity, but he thought they were pretty much home free – Harry using his Invisibility Cloak to get them past the front door. Hopefully, Draco thought, watching the green eyed boy take several shots at the bar, they’d be able to sneak back in without him tripping over his feet.
“You don’t smell right,” Fenrir grumbled, leaning in to sniff him without a shred of shame. Draco winced at his touch, wishing he could Disapparate on the spot. “You’re off.” He pulled back to meet Draco’s eyes, his own crinkled in what Draco could only read as concern, surprised to find no malice. “You’re dying again.”
Draco nodded. “Definitely thinned out a bit. Looking a little too much like your dad post-Azkaban to be honest.”
“Where is he, then?” Draco asked. Everyone else seemed to be milling about between the sitting room and kitchen.
Harry was finally settling down enough to realize the full extent of what happened. He detached himself from Draco and sat against the wall. “Sorry.” He wiped his face with his robe sleeve. He buried his face in his hands. “That was so embarrassing.”
Harry shook his head. “You’re not a monster. The air was so thick with magic it was driving everyone a little mad. It’s okay.”
Draco wasn’t expecting to feel the air suck out of him when he stepped through the Floo into the lobby of St. Mungo’s. He couldn’t help but feel chagrin thinking about the last time he was here—a month’s long stay without the ability to leave the hospital bed had taken its toll. As he took in the bustling hospital, he found himself recognizing some of the mediwitches and wizards who had tended to him and vaguely wondered if they would remember him. It was all too weird.
Draco shrugged. “How are you doing? I’m happy I got to see you today—I know you need to focus right now without distractions from home.”
“Garden of Souls?” Harry echoed in a small voice, clearly only hanging on to that part of the conversation.
His parents and Remus had left for a bit to change clothes and purchase books and other things that would occupy Draco for what surely was going to be a long stay. It was when they were off running errands when Harry chose to sneak in.
“I know it wasn’t. But those who were in that place were Confunded or dead.” Some objects began to shake and Harry began to count his breaths until he settled. “I’m sorry,” he said again. He wasn’t going to fail is Mind Healer by losing his cool here. “Accidental magic is my new specialty it seems.”
“I’m happy to chart some of that journey with you, maybe with the help of Draco’s mum since she’s probably less out of practice than I am.”
Draco barked out a laugh at that, surprised by Remus’s brashness. “It’s not as though Potter has a choice in the manner.”
Harry’s lips drew into a thin line. “Look, I don’t know what kind of relationship the two of you had, but it seems to me like you hurt him pretty badly when you broke things off with him.”
When he awoke from his nap, only Ginny remained in the room, reading some sort of novel that Draco couldn’t make out through sleep-filled eyes. “Was I snoring or something?” Draco asked her. “Scare everyone out of the room?”
Draco shook his head. If Blaise thought he was going to become some new ally he had another thing coming. On the other hand, getting Harry to laugh seemed to be of import, especially with the rough weeks to come. Nothing was ever going to be easy for Draco, was it?
Both Draco and Nott were working with Remus. Remus had a lot of set up to do, especially with the moon arriving mid-week, so he required some additional help. Draco was both apprehensive yet thrilled to be working with Theo due to the Slytherin’s standoffish demeanor. Hermione was working with McGonagall, Ron with Hagrid, Blaise with Firenze, who had recently taken up post as the Divination Professor as Trelawny had retired, and Pansy with Pompfrey. They all had their work cut out for them.
Draco kept it together until they returned to Grimmauld, locking himself away in his and Harry’s room as soon as he possibly could. Why was he letting Blaise affect him like this? How could he think he’d sell his best friend and his family out to the death eaters? Was he really that awful? He knew he could be a brat but he didn’t think he was capable of murder.
It burned his throat as he contemplated the last few years of his life. How it all went topsy turvy by his second year of school. How his entire life was molded by hatred, only to have to painstakingly relearn morality from the right side. How he was so close to asylum when his father brought him back to the Manor to be turned. Everything bad in his life originated with his father, and it burned Draco up inside. “You’re sorry?” he asked, voice low.
“Sirius is the best for panic attacks,” James said when Harry finished his story. “I’d have them so regularly everyone was on a constant swing shift with me.”
While that was going on and everyone was distracted, Remus and Sirius snuck away in order to bring the returned Black up to speed on everything.
“Yes. Fenrir has informed me. Luckily without diagrams, I’ll have you know, but it was still the most awkward birds and the bees talk I’ve ever received in my life. Thanks for the reminder.” Draco shuddered.
Draco gave a tentative smile in response, feeling a bit warm inside. Being more in touch with his emotions since become a werewolf was unsettling.
Harry and Draco went to visit the Malfoys the weekend prior. Harry wanted to pick Narcissa’s brain about channeling and Draco simply missed his mum. Lucius would also be there and Draco supposed he should try to build upon that tentative relationship. Still, he was feeling on edge with the moon having just passed.
Draco felt his headache get a little worse as he processed all of the information. It was mentally exhausting trying to figure out if he should believe a word coming out of his father’s mouth. Though, he supposed if both Harry and Sirius were willing to back him in court, he must have done something right. “I’m not going to refuse to ever see you again, if that’s what you’re worried about,” he said. At his words, Lucius visibly relaxed. “I’m still so angry with you and I believe that you need to pay for the things you’ve done, especially the diary. Ginny still has nightmares from that bloody thing. But, for mum’s sake, I won’t shut you out. It’s just not going to be the same as it was before—I’ve had to unlearn so much hatred and I refuse to go back into that dark place. I hope you can understand that.”
He called loudly for Ron or anyone really, to no avail. He groaned, realizing that he really couldn’t wait for anyone to arrive, someone was really hurt in there.
that you had to be turned into a werewolf in order to leave the up and coming ranks. It’s awful. But you got out and I’m thankful for that—I’m indebted to Remus for taking care of you. I owe him my life for his caring for yours.”
“Ah,” Bill replied with a grin, “but you’re an Heir. Disowning an Heir requires a direct violation of the House’s pillars of character. You’re a bit of a snot from what my brother has said, but I doubt you could violate pillars like justice, loyalty, and intelligence that the Malfoy family derives from.”
Harry sat back and considered his position. Dumbledore was reaching out to him for help? Why would he need a sixteen year old to figure things out for him? “If he made me a horcrux on accident, he has to have more than three. The books I’ve read talked about instability after the soul was split 3 times. Something to do with the numerology of it all.”
His magic reached out to meet Blaise’s, and as it reached his core, Draco found himself recoil slightly. Surrounding Blaise’s brilliant magical force was darkness—it felt like vines filling in the cracks around Blaise’s core. Dark magic was keeping the core severed, not allowing it to heal. Draco closed his eyes and mentally tugged at the vines—he found that while they held fast, they were malleable enough to break free, if only he had a vessel for the dark energy that would release from doing this.
Dumbledore sat back in his chair, thoughtful but not responding immediately. “Do you know where Harry is procuring the alcohol from?” he asked.
Draco nodded tightly. “I know. It’s just…still raw for me I guess. I know you’re trying. I’m trying too.”
Nevertheless, he was happy to have the odd kinship with the Gryffindors that came with dating The Chosen One: it wasn’t like the Slytherins were providing much friendship as of late.
Draco reached for his hand, which Harry took gladly. “Tell me Samhain is going to go well,” he asked.
Harry came back with the soup that Remus had promised earlier. It was a nice chicken soup with plenty of vegetables. Draco took one look and his stomach began to growl viciously. He took the bowl from Potter's hands. "Thank you. You didn't have to do that."
Harry only nodded and James swopped him up in a tight embrace. “Oh, Harry,” he said. He squeezed a little tighter, as if attempting to anchor him to the spot. “I’ve missed you so much, my baby.”
Turner ran a quick diagnostic, waving his wand over Harry. “Your arm seems to be healing alright, just a bit slow. You’re suffering from magical exhaustion so your body is taking its time healing. I’m afraid there isn’t a potion for that—you just need to rest and not do too much magic, if any at all. Healer Markus told me to advise strict bed rest for at least a week, no magic. Then you can start trying out small things, Lumos, Accio, et cetera.” At Harry’s blank face Turner looked at Sirius. “I have some paperwork with all of this written down for you. I know it’s been an overwhelming time.” He procured a packet and handed it to Sirius before turning back to Harry. “Are you swinging high or low today?”
And he seemed to. In the days leading up to his birthday, Harry made more of an effort to at least sit in the same room as his best friends. Hermione seemed pleased that the two regularly would read quietly with one another, Draco joining at times as well. He and Ron would quietly convene to play chess in the evenings, Ron always besting Harry. Remus, Molly, and the other adults looked happy to see the younger group finally getting along, smiling along to their dinner conversations and willingness to work together around the vast manorhouse. The tumultuous Fifth Year seemed to be moving into the rearview, with Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Draco knitting some fragile form of kinship.
When they returned from the colony classes picked up fast, September blurring into October without pause. In that time, Draco was able to take on some work with Sirius, which he enjoyed thoroughly. If Healing didn’t work out for him, he could definitely go into potions making after school. They spent most of the time working on adapting Dreamless Sleep to be less addictive and Draco considered choosing Sirius as his specializing preference after the holidays just to continue the work with him. He knew he should stick to Pomfrey, though.
“Try being his roommate,” Draco replied. Ron let out a laugh, startling the both of them. “This is too weird.”
“To the Order,” everyone echoed and drank. Harry drank as well, not registering that he probably shouldn’t be consuming alcohol after his run in with it a few years prior. The familiar burn felt good as the firewhiskey ran down his throat, soothing his pain in ways he forgot possible. He took a seat next to Ron and Hermione, happy to have this moment over with, and the real meeting began.
After a while, Sirius spoke again. “We ruined his life. We should have just stuck with the original plan. It caused all of this suspicion and we put our trust in the wrong person.” Remus didn’t know if he meant Peter or Dumbledore at that moment. Sirius put his face in his hands. “I missed so much time with him—I thought Dumbledore would have lifted the spell but it makes sense: the Dursleys would be able to protect Harry with the spell still in place. I’m sure he knew he was on borrowed time with it but it was a stop gap. I really need to talk to Dumbledore. I need to find out his plans.”
Draco pulled the two Gryffindors away and towards the meeting. He couldn’t believe Blaise already. He had to know that comment would cause suspicion. Draco was seeing red.
That wasn't as drastic as Draco imagined. His appearance was already a little different, being a little paler wasn't that detrimental. "Are we going to do this today?"
“I think it will be good to get some rest after the past few days. Will you meditate with me later?”
James smiled at the name. “Yeah, I see Lils a lot. I honestly wish she could come here: it’s kind of nice and tranquil don’t you think?”
James reached over and pulled him into a bone-crushing hug. “I love you so much, did you know that?”
Remus nodded. “That’s good.” He looked at Lucius. “I’m not trying to steal your son from you, you know. I care about him a lot, though. You kind of threw him at me, after all.”
Blaise sighed. “Fine. I’m not out to get him or anything. He’s a decent bloke.” Blaise’s voice had taken on a faraway quality reminiscent of their conversations of who was fit and who wasn’t back in the dorms.
Draco frowned. “I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. He’s already irate during the day – I can’t imagine what he’ll be like at school.”
“Piss off,” was the reply he got, the Black Heir pushing past other students angrily to get away from the blonde.
Sirius suddenly looked around the room frantically. “I don’t see any suitors waiting in the wings to take Draco away, do you?” he quipped. Harry flushed. “Babe, you have more than enough humility—you’re not Odysseus, even if you’re both tragic heroes of some sort.”
Harry looked up in surprise at the name. Hermione had slapped Ron in the chest in excitement and Ron couldn’t hold back the grin. “Your what?” he asked.
“This might be advantageous for you,” Draco supplied, trying to brighten the mood a bit. “Nobody knows what you look like right now. That means You-Know-Who doesn’t either. You can go out to London and enjoy anonymity for awhile.”
Ron found Harry on the balcony that was attached to Sirius’s old room, smoking a cigarette from Merlin knows where. “Alright, mate?” he asked, sidling next to him.
“Of course, of course,” she said, Draco smelling the empathy rolling off of her in waves. She rounded on her children anyway, telling them to not make too much noise while Draco rested. He was happy to be back.
“Have to give you your pain potions slowly,” she explained as she switched the bags. “You’ll probably feel a bit loopy in a little. Sorry about that.” As the potion began to work its way into Draco the pain began to ease. He heaved a grateful sigh. “We also need to avoid too much magic use on you while you’re regenerating. Only basic scans to not interfere with the process.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “The day I listen to Zabini about anything is the day you commit me to an asylum. We just got through a war; we’re allowed to be touchy.” Harry grinned at him in response, giving him a peck on the cheek.
“I said what I said, Potter.” There was that laugh again. It filled Draco with a great warmth to hear him laugh so frequently again. He briefly considered letting the garden go: Harry seemed to be healing on his own. He couldn’t justify it though: Harry had almost crossed to see his fathers and he needed to know that that wasn’t necessary.
Narcissa smiled. “I’m sure that will be lovely. Draco, did you want to take anything from home for the altar? We’ll miss having you here but how special that will be to join with your friends for Samhain.”
When he next awoke, night had fallen and his parents were gone. He felt very sore as he tried to readjust himself; the pain was still quite unbearable when he was in between potions. He called for a Healer and they reupped his IV, noting that he was sleeping when it was time for a new bag and they didn’t want to wake him. He smiled in thanks and settled back into the pillows.
“I hope he doesn’t bother Harry,” Ron said, looking over his shoulder to where they left the other Slytherin. “Wouldn’t want the train to explode from accidental magic.”
“Well, we’re all here for you if you need us. You know that, right?” Draco couldn’t help to feel the deep guilt surrounding him throwing Harry out when he was clearly out of control. He didn’t want to do that again; not ever.
“So,” Harry said, changing the subject. “Is Dad’s snoring the only thing getting you out of bed so early?”
Jack frowned. “I remember you saying you were having very rough full moons—your mind was turning on you?”
Harry looked at his father in disdain, but his gaze didn’t waver. The Black Heir sighed, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. “It’s Draco. There’s blood everywhere, not like when I tried to kill myself but like, everyone is bleeding. He’s screaming, using healing magic, but it’s too draining to him and he crumples to the ground. I don’t know if he’s alive at the end of it.” Harry wrapped his arms around himself, shuddering slightly at the thought of the premonition. “I don’t want that to come true. I don’t even want to utter it out loud. I need to keep him as far away as possible from this battle. I just don’t know how to do that.”
and seeing it was six in the morning, Harry decided to rise for the day. Maybe a run would shake him from his restless night. He threw on a pair of joggers and an old Quidditch tee and took off, not worrying about alerting anyone to his venture.
Harry gave a small chuckle at that but sobered pretty quickly. “I know everyone is worried. I know Dad and Remus are trying to figure out how they can loosen the wards quickly enough to get a Healer to see me—they’re right; I probably should see a Healer. It’s just—I’m fine. It’s sad that Dumbledore’s dead but I’m not in deep mourning or anything. It’s just that I had this vision that I’m afraid I’m going to spill out to everyone if I say anything. It’s been constantly in my mind.”
Remus and Draco departed from the Greyback colony two days after the full moon with promises to return as soon as they could. Jack had squeezed Draco so tightly he thought he would break in half—he was really a great caretaker. Draco had to admit that he’d grown accustomed to the village after spending the past fortnight there and was a little weary of returning to the real world and facing the fallout of the war. Werewolves were much better company than wizards, it turned out.
“What’s with everyone here?” Regulus asked. “Usually it’s just you and your morning tea.” He pulled away from Sirius and stared at Harry. “Well this is
“Yeah, I think the Garden upped the vampire gene in the healing process. No blood cravings yet though so I’m not complaining. Why are you so pointy?”
Harry obliged, getting on with the rest of their errands. Harry returned to the robes shop last with a singular Auror, Draco unwilling to approach the area. Inside, Blaise was waiting for him.
Draco’s biting retort he had lined up for whatever Harry was going to say caught in his throat. How was that possible? “You were captured,” he said finally. It wasn’t a question. Sirius gripped Harry’s hand tightly at the notion, as though he were a lifeline.
Draco had scooted back against the headboard, curling around his mug. His head was low, trying to hide the puffiness of his eyes. “You know you can experience emotion in front of me, right? I won’t destroy your reputation by telling.”
Draco chose to ignore the glib insult, actually wanting to learn something new about Pureblood lines. “But I’m not loyal. I defected.”
That made sense to Draco. He suddenly got an idea. “If you work with Dumbledore, then you can get in contact with him. I was granted asylum but got intercepted. No offense, your colony seems nice and all, but I would like to go where I was supposed to be in the first place.”
. Even my father, who threw me quite literally to the wolves.” Lucius flinched at that. “Just think about it. You know who to contact.” He squeezed Narcissa’s hand in goodbye. “I’m going to stay with Harry. Nobody is here with him tonight. Both his parents are dead, you see.” Lucius flinched again. “See you tomorrow morning.” He strolled out to leave the two to ponder.
He was also feeling a bit better to know he could keep up the charade a little longer, at least outside of his dorm. He’d undeniably have to tell Seamus, Dean, and Neville tonight. They wouldn’t be able to stop questioning him otherwise. He wondered if blood oaths were too extreme to get them to keep quiet; Seamus could never keep his mouth shut.
Draco took the mug and sniffed the contents—whiskey, he realized. He sipped gratefully. “Thanks.” They sat in silence for a few minutes after that, Draco’s eyes burning a hole into the fireplace. Suddenly, he could take the silence no longer. “How are you remaining so calm?” Draco asked in frustration. “He’s your son—you were just reunited. Shouldn’t you be upset?”
Jack shook his head. “I don’t have the details. Remus sent his Patronus along to tell us the news. Fenrir should be back shortly, and Remus will be round soon once everything settles.”
“And here I thought you left martyring behind with your soldier’s uniform.” He leaned down to kiss Harry lightly. Harry smiled into the kiss, knowing he calmed Draco down. “I just can’t imagine you at the village.”
The three stepped out onto the patio the overlooked the Garden. James couldn’t help but realize that he didn’t feel as connected with it as usually. He usually felt right and calm and in tune with those in the Garden with him. Maybe it was just because he was on the patio, but he couldn’t really feel anything but his anxious nerves.
“Silence,” Voldemort hissed angrily. Draco flinched, sure he would be punished, and looked down. “This boy is insolent, Lucius. How dare he speak when not spoken to?”
She shoved him away in mock disgust. “Ugh, no PDAs: you’re such a Gryffindor.” But she was smirking. Draco wanted to let out a big sigh of relief. That was two Slytherins on his side now: if only Theo were so easy. He glanced his way and saw him standing off and away from the rest, looking quite uncomfortable. Draco didn’t have much time to ponder because Sirius swept into the room to greet them, Professor McGonagall in tow.
Draco dragged his hand down his face as he said, “Ginny told me to burn them. Why is she always right?”
Harry felt exhausted despite getting a full night’s rest. He scrubbed his face with his hands as he looked at himself in the mirror, no longer fazed by seeing the Black features so prominent on him. In fact, he thought he reflected both his fathers at different times, depending upon the expression. He was really coming into his own even though he was still recovering from the rotting curse. The bags under his eyes seemed to be depthless and his collarbone still stood out starkly against his skin. It made him a bit uncomfortable but there was nothing for it but time.
Harry jumped off as though he were stung. “Shit, Draco. You’re still healing.” He helped him settle back down into the pillows. He then let out a sheepish grin as he said, “sorry. I’ve just been waiting for that for a long time.”
“Your father’s incompetence affects the entire family, young Draco. We must hurry, though, the moon is rising.”
Sirius rubbed his face in his hands, suddenly very tired and overwhelmed. “Textbook isn’t it? Throwing everyone off the trail?”
“You’ve met Hermione Granger, right? Brightest witch of her age? Has Muggle parents? I don’t think ‘mixing’ is diluting the magic stream.”
Black Manor looked the same as before—for some reason, Draco thought it might look or feel different. It was quiet, sure, but the walls were still a calming beige and the windows were still brightly illuminating the large foyer. He actually heard Sirius’s bark of laughter coming from the direction of the sitting room and it put him at ease. He was
“Good to see you can follow orders this time, Lucius,” Voldemort  said, his high voice full of disdain. His father seemed to stiffen more if at all possible. He inclined his head in a jarring motion, a clear act of submission. Draco felt ill.
“I died at seventeen. He was just born. I’m sure Sirius was over the moon about it.” Regulus was looking far away again. Draco wondered if he knew something he didn’t or if he was referring to Sirius being happy his brother had died.
Draco’s eyes narrowed and his grip on Harry’s hand grew so tight it was all he could do from yelling out. “As if you cared a few years ago about that? Last I checked you chased me out to the colony. You’re lucky Fenrir isn’t as horrid as the stories about him.”
Sirius looked up at Draco and grinned a Harry grin, blue eyes bright and alive. “I know,” he said. “Isn’t it odd?”
Harry frowned. “I don’t think he could. He was gripping my arms in desperation. He wanted me to tell people he wasn’t in his right mind and that he didn’t mean for it to get this far.” Harry angered at the thought. “As though reconnecting his soul could absolve him of everything he’s done. As though he didn’t make that decision long ago.” Draco turned into him, sensing the anger, and nuzzled into his neck. Harry blinked and looked down. “Are you
“Watch the duvet, Potter,” Draco quipped, looking up from his desk. Ever the Slytherin, he didn’t want to show his cards just yet: Harry couldn’t know how nervous this subject made him. “Seven? No wonder he’s a bit mad.”
Draco leaned back into the chaise after finishing his meal. Harry took the tray from him. “I’m not crippled, you know. I can make it to the kitchen and back.”
“Ah, yes. Though you must know it’s for protection of both the humans and the pack. Wouldn’t want to accidentally make someone a snack.”
“Let me know if you want something else—Molly has been sending along loads of food. It helps to keep her mind off of everything.”
He would be going back to Hogwarts, perhaps with Blaise, Harry, Ron, and Hermione in tow. What would it be like, he wondered, to enjoy a year of school without looming threats of war? What would it look like when he didn’t have to hide his relationship with Harry, or his friendship with the Gryffindors?
While the year had many challenges ahead, things seemed to be alright for now, which is all they could ask for.
Remus rounded on the bespectacled teen. “I don’t understand why you are always looking for trouble. There is a madman out to get you and you just casually stroll out the door like it’s nothing at all?”
“You can call me Eric. And it’s honestly no problem. It’s all hands on deck right now with everything anyway. If that’s all I’ll head out.”
Remus smiled. “Good, we’ll set it up.” It was met with deaf ears as Draco scanned the front page of the
“I’m not trying to hurt you, I’m trying to make you snap out of it!” Books were now falling off of Ron’s bookshelf. “Drinking makes this all worse and you know it!”
“Antares,” Blaise tried it on his mouth, smiling around the vowels, “where have you been? Haven’t really seen you ‘round school.”
Harry just shook his head, plopping down on Draco’s bed and rubbing his face in his hands tiredly. He peeked through his fingers as he said, “Stupid nightmare. I haven’t slept alone since St. Mungo’s and I think my brain didn’t know how to react. I’m sorry, Draco, I know it’s early.”
Remus frowned. “I’m not sure. And I’m not sure who did it. Lily was positive you were hers. She loved you so much. If she did this I’m sure it was to protect you in some fashion. Lily was a good person.” Harry snorted. It didn’t seem that way at the moment.  “She probably didn’t consider your becoming so strong. You’ve been able to do wandless magic for some time, most wizards are lucky if they can do that after coming into their full powers. She couldn’t have known this would happen.”
“Why is everyone that I care for so incredibly stupid?” Draco said, eyes wide. Blaise would be coming here? What was wrong with him?
It was around midnight when Draco finally made a reappearance in their shared room, probably wanting to give Harry some space. He dropped quite a few parcels at the foot of Harry’s bed. “You left these, Mrs. Weasley asked me to take them up for you,” he said.
The elder wizard smiled at Harry as he entered. “Harry,” he said, “I am so glad to see you alright. You gave us quite a scare.”
“Seeing as I was out for five days I don’t see 24 hours being an issue. The Healers haven’t said anything to me about it.”
Healer Turner frowned. “It would lose potency—best not. We can talk some meditating strategies, though that may help with rest.”
The elder wolf sighed, and Draco saw all of his 39 years flood through on his face as his shoulders sagged. “He attempted again. He’s in the hospital.”
Blaise followed his gaze, resting on the new Black. “You never answered my question. I don’t recall a Black our age.”
Harry sighed. “Yes, Dad.” The potions were still a sore subject for Harry. Although they maintained his depression and anxiety, he still felt defeated having to take them, obsessed with the idea that his brain should be able to work itself out. Draco spent quite a bit of time trying to encourage him that it was perfectly fine and normal to need help, but it still made Harry feel embarrassed about it, even with nothing to be embarrassed about.
Remus nodded. “Alright—let’s stop home first, though and get something to eat.” He held out his arm and Draco took it and felt the familiar pull of Apparation—they were suddenly back on Manor grounds, just outside the door.
A quiet knock was heard on the door. “Please go away,” Harry voiced this time, trying to get a grip on his emotions.
Everything was tense as they reached the steps of Hogwarts, the Great Hall coming into closer view. As they walked through the castle doors and approached the alcove leading to the opening feast festivities, Ron grinded to a dead halt before they could see what lied in wait for them.
Draco found himself unable to say no to Harry most nights, Ron held on stronger than he did to their “no alcohol, no exceptions” mantra: the redhead was obviously the better friend.
Lucius huffed out a laugh at that. “I’ll do my very best.” When they returned to the fireplace Lucius turned to Harry. “Take care of him, Harry.”
He must have voiced the concern because Regulus shuddered. “I wouldn’t know if my body is being used in that manner. I never looked but I doubt it. He didn’t even know I went there. It’s fuzzy, really. I was dragged down and then kind of just ended up here and I haven’t looked back since. Kreacher was at Grimmauld so I couldn’t call for him here. I just hoped that he had solved the locket.” He shook himself out of the memory after a moment, looking to Harry with a smile. “I guess my nephew cracking it works just as well.”
Draco sat down at that, growing pale. He let out a low whine, almost inhuman, which startled Harry. His wolfish qualities have really been manifesting as of late in ways he never saw Remus act. Harry, with werewolf blood in him from Draco’s healing, wanted to respond in kind, but felt himself holding back. That feeling hadn’t overcome him before and it made him feel strange.
Harry looked a little ashamed at that and avoided everyone’s gaze as he explained. He most certainly didn’t look at Remus, who already knew why but was still a bit disappointed in him for it. “Well, that could be because I might have used an enchanted blade?” he began, using uptalk as a defense mechanism. Hermione, Ron, and Draco all looked appalled at that as they stared at the Black Heir in disbelief. Harry swallowed nervously. “The wounds will keep reopening until there is magic intervention…which they can’t do yet because of all of the testing. So they’ve just been bandaging me up really tightly until they can figure out what to do about the dark magic remnants.”
Marlene laughed and it was like they were teens again. “No, they’re monitoring you here and noting any anomalies that come up for us. We’ll be in contact with you to check in and make sure you’re not experiencing any untoward symptoms but that’s pretty much it. Your wife used to work with us, truly you don’t believe that we actually kidnap people?”
Draco thought suddenly as the scent invaded his nostrils. He let the wolf take over for a moment as he let his sense of smell take over. It
“Oh, Draco,” Hermione sighed in sympathy. Draco’s eyed narrowed. He hated the pity from her and that’s all she’s managed to give him.
The newly reinstated family thus spent the rest of the day in James’s room running down the list of potential press agents and mapping out protocols for how Harry and James’s return to society would go, fully knowing that when Remus came to visit the following morning he would point out all of the logical flaws and come up with a better solution—it was almost like old times.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter. We are now entering uncharted territory past the oneshot: can't wait to share what happens next!
"Did you regret the words or that they came out?" At Draco's non-answer, Remus heaved a sigh. "It will get better, Draco."
Ron, and Hermione looked at each other in disbelief. Ron grumbled about the unbelievability of it all and left the kitchen, Hermione following to see if he was alright. Harry chose to seat himself next to Remus, opposite Draco, and poured himself a glass of pumpkin juice.
“You almost missed me longer,” Draco replied, unwilling to ignore the reason why Harry was even in St. Mungo’s to begin with.
“If you were trying to protect me, why didn’t you let me go to asylum without becoming a werewolf first? All you had to do was let me leave with Severus and neither of you did anything to protect me.”
The headmaster frowned. “I didn’t want you to be hauled away by Unspeakables—to be poked and prodded until you were no more. There hasn’t been a human horcrux—I didn’t want to see you destroyed in the name of science.”
Harry nodded. “Thanks for helping me breathe,” he said finally, “I’ve never been able to come down that fast.”
They discussed how Draco was getting on in the village with the others, what their plans were for the next full, and what he has been doing to keep busy. It was only when Jack bade them goodnight that Remus began to open up.
Harry closed his eyes as he realized the effects of his emotional outburst. He counted to ten in his head but couldn’t keep it inside of him. He was out of control. “I can’t stop it,” he said panicked. The wind was picking up more and more and the window pane began to shake.
Harry chose that moment to make himself known. “Draco I’m all done.” The two Slytherins looked up in shock. “Is everything okay?”
Harry scrunched his eyes shut at that, trying to keep his emotions in check. Ron was trying, but it was difficult to imagine the redhead react in anything but anger. It was like he was lying to him all this time, even though he couldn’t have possibly known himself. “I’m afraid to show you,” he said, hardly above a whisper.
“I would imagine that someone with an ‘x’ marked on their back since birth is rarely alright,” Draco commented.
“Of course I’m not disappointed in you! You unfortunately inherited my depression, babe. That doesn’t make you weak.” Sirius brushed Harry’s wild mane back gently with his fingers, wondering if it was a step too far. He couldn’t help but reach out after hearing how broken he was feeling.
Draco sat next to him, gently pulling Harry’s hands away from his face, not letting go of the one nearest his as he got settled. Harry flushed but didn’t let go. “To be fair, you haven’t really cried about your situation. You were headed towards a meltdown, regardless of what set it off.”
Draco swallowed and ran his hand nervously through his hair. “Well it’s kind of your gift. This garden is special.”
The door creaked open at Draco's wave, just as Remus was reaching ten. Remus was surprised to see Draco still lying there, wand nowhere to be found. "Well that was pretty impressive wandless magic," he claimed, sitting on the edge of Draco's bed.
“Please don’t apologize for saving the world and needing a rest, mate,” Seamus voiced with a laugh. “We just wanted to make sure you weren’t buried under some rubble.”
“We call on the spirits of loved ones who have passed on this Samhain to join us in celebration. We honor and adore you. You are welcome here.” Draco squeezed his hand tightly in reassurance as the magic began to get stronger. “Mother Magick, we ask you to please bring our lost spirits through safe passage to us on this the night of the lowered Veil so we may enjoy the company of one another once more. We honor and adore you. We provide the gift of the earth as offering.” At this, everyone reached their hands filled with the dirt of the Hogwarts’ Grounds towards the fire. “This earth grounds the living and comforts the dead. We offer it to you, Mother Magick, to join us together once more.” They all released the dirt into the fire, and a purple smoke began to release into the air. The magic was overwhelming.
.” Blaise emphasized the title the media has given Harry with a staged whisper of false enchantment.
Draco closed his eyes, willing himself to ease the wave of anxiety surrounding his best friend. “Right—you wouldn’t. Harry?”
Sirius sat next to Draco in front of the fireplace, offering him a mug of strange smelling tea. “Brooding again, are we? Thought you might like a cuppa’”
“Haz, you’re beautiful.” Draco squeezed his hand tighter, earning a small smile. “You do look frightfully thin, though. I can try to feel it out if it’s a curse?”
Remus’s cheeks heated up in embarrassment. He couldn’t believe he was having this conversation without any backup. “Well, yes. For quite a while, we were all inseparable. Then James got pregnant.”
“How mature.” He glanced down at Harry’s plate, noticing that it was just as full as when they arrived. “You know you need to eat, right?”
Healer Markus was no nonsense as he treated Harry’s wounds in the Gryffindor Common Room. Sirius had come up to see Harry, leaving the savior of the wizarding world with nowhere to hide regarding his current physical status.
“The wheels were turning for some time, but when you landed in the hospital for saving Potter, I knew I couldn’t go on like that anymore. It wasn’t helping our family at all. We were alive, but at what cost? I met with Dumbledore and he allowed me to spy. I’ve been working for the other side for a few years now. It still does not absolve me of everything I’ve done in the past, but I am working on it.”
Harry laughed. “Oh yeah. Sorry.” He stood and stretched. “I’m going to get ready. Thank you for helping me.”
Draco opened his eyes to stare blankly at the ceiling. "I'm still getting used to it. Professor Lupin has been helping me."
“The nightwitch firecalled me at 3 am in a frenzy, unable to locate you. I almost had a heart attack.”
When Harry and Draco stepped through the fireplace they had thought that they had successfully finished their jaunt without anyone noticing their disappearance—at least Harry did. Draco’s sensitive hearing alerted him to the frantic footsteps and whispering of Remus Lupin. “Where are they: you have got to be kidding me!” the older werewolf exclaimed to himself.
Draco felt the pull of the wolf as he eyed Harry, the urge to mark him, turn him, make him permanently his on the surface. The way he felt safe and protected by the Black Heir was unmatched and his devotion and pheromones rolled off him in waves. He
They were quiet for a bit after that, lost in their own thoughts. “When do you think he’ll step through? Does he even have his wand?” Draco asked finally, unable to contain his curiosity from spilling out.
“How do you feel about being back on that?” Draco asked as they slipped into Honeydukes hand in hand. Harry couldn’t help but feel a little happy that Draco was actually publicly showing affection. It was hard to break the Malfoy demeanor at times.
Remus, however, was back to bothering him daily. He was secretly glad for it: Harry was set for release soon and he needed someone to spend time with.
Hello everyone. Thank you for continuing to support this fic! I've been really enjoying writing it and developing it in a way that is a little out there but overall realistic. Full apologies for taking so long to get this chapter out: between grad school and a few family deaths over the summer I have not been in a state to write. The good news is I am already working on Chapter 5 so I am hoping to not keep you hanging like this again. This one is a bit shorter but there was too much happening with what I had so far, so it is getting its own chapter. Thank you for your patience!
“But…you and Dad and…Dad…?” Harry trailed off. This was so confusing. Was Draco only with him because of werewolf instincts? Was nothing actually real?
“Me either. And I’ll have a lot to say to him when he crosses. I’m just glad you have Seer now, even if I can’t be around.” James looked a bit downtrodden at that. It made Harry’s heart swell in a bit of despair.
"What in Merlin's name..." Draco wondered, following the voices to the kitchen. Harry was standing on the opposite side of the kitchen, red in the face from bellowing, his hair wet with sweat. Nearer to Draco was Hermione and Ron. Hermione looked like she was about to cry and Ron looked to be made of pure rage.
Draco knelt next to the form, not caring that he was going to be covered in blood. “Harry,” he lamented. He put an ear to his chest. He could barely make out a heartbeat, which was really bad considering his extra-sensitive hearing. “Fuck. Harry, come on.” He then noticed the long gashes down his arms and the knife used to make them. Draco wanted to vomit from the sight.
“The wives tales spread about what I do are ridiculous. I don’t steal children. I save them from orphanhood or aggressive and abusive situations. Your dear professor’s father might have said horrid things about our condition but his wife also had an abusive streak. I wanted to help him, not ruin his life.” Draco looked down, heat rising to his cheeks. “I’ll see you in a bit. Don’t hide in here all day.” And with that, Fenrir stormed out. Draco felt doomed.
Jack sat on the edge of his (well Remus’s, he supposed) bed, smoothing back his hair gently. “Voldemort fell—Potter finished it. It’s all over now.”
” holding his breath in anticipation. Nothing happened for a moment and Draco wondered if he was harboring any ill intentions towards Harry, as that would be the only way it wouldn’t let him through. His fears were alleviated when a bright light shone through the fireplace. “Brilliant,” he breathed, stepping through to the other side.
Draco frowned and decided to admit something close to his heart—he felt Bill should know he wasn’t forever a pointy bastard. “The twins were the first to treat me like a human. Even when I was terrible to Ron all those years ago—they caught me on a bad day once in Fifth Year. I was having a panic attack in the hallway on the first night back after dealing with Voldemort all summer. They sat me down in an alcove and breathed with me. I’ll never forget it.”
Harry shook his head, feeling sick. “I don’t want the recognition, I just want to rest.” He was beginning to feel out of control again. The wind began to pick up around them. He closed his eyes, trying to calm himself.
Draco felt a bit ashamed by the fact that he’d need help walking but didn’t refuse it. One by one, they slowly made it up to the first landing, Draco’s joints aching with each step. He’d need to get a bit fitter if he was going to take Harry to the garden, he realized.
“Funny,” Draco replied, reaching for a sandwich, “I was under the impression that I was no better than dirt under your shoe, Granger.”
The full moon, it turns out, didn’t affect Harry at all. In fact, he wasn’t presenting any werewolf-like tendencies. On the contrary, it seemed that he was doomed to be porcelain white due to the increase in vampirism into his system. They had advised him of wearing sunblock when going outside and it almost made him burst out laughing: what a lame vampire, he couldn’t help but think. His canines were slightly pointier but he wasn’t craving anyone’s blood, thankfully. Harry didn’t seem to care about more appearance changes, though. He was just glad to be alive.
Years had all been divided up amongst the participating staff in this new career exploration venture, some getting two students for the two-week interim for additional assistance. Harry was paired with his father, which made him nervous because he was pants at potions to begin with. He hoped that he didn’t end up making more work for Sirius, as he was wont to do.
Fenrir squeezed his good arm gently. “You’re one of the pack—I protect what’s mine.” Draco didn’t expect to feel so warm from that statement and bit back a grin. He wondered if Father would be furious that he was pleased to be accepted into a werewolf pack. Fenrir glanced at the slinged arm again, frown deepening. “You know it has to heal on its own, though, right? We can’t help it along.”
Harry turned to him wide-eyed. “What do you mean?” Remus had burst into the room at this point and let out a huge sigh of relief. “Oh.”
Harry could think of nothing he’d like to do less. Thankfully, his father noticed his extreme discomfort at the idea of being stuck in St. Mungo’s again and spoke up. “Send Healer Turner to the Manor—we’ll key him into our wards.”
“He what, Rem?” Sirius was becoming more concerned by the minute. If he inherited the mental health issues of both himself and James, Harry would need all of the support he could get. Sirius squeezed Remus’s hand gently when he noticed his distress. “You’ve been doing a brilliant job keeping it together for both Harry and Draco. I know it’s been a little off the rails. What happened?”
“My Weasley jumper—it’s so cold here.” Draco avoided his mother’s eyes as he said it, not wanting to see her reaction to the fact that he has been ignoring the blood feud to the point where the Weasleys feel like he’s one of the brood. He was glad his father wasn’t here.
Sirius sighed, frustrated that he was being blocked from his parental duties. “Can I at least try the Dad thing? We’ll have to talk eventually.”
Harry scoffed. “That’s not what this is.” He tried pushing past Draco but the blonde held steady. “I just miss you,” he tried, “and I’ve had a rotten day.”
What was even more disconcerting was Potter’s behavior towards him. After his ridiculous meltdown on the first day, the golden boy had been particularly quiet and withdrawn. Weasley and Granger would attempt to coax Harry into speaking to them and he would just get up and leave the room, befuddling his friends in the process. He, too, began eating at odd hours with Draco and Remus. His wolf seemed to be happy to have Remus around – Draco assumed the first full moon was instrumental in creating a pack mentality with the older wizard, not to mention the very paternal behavior Remus had been exhibiting towards him as of late.
“Now that, I can explain,” Jack chanced a smile at Draco, not surprised when he did not receive one in return. “My father possesses the unique ability to send any of his coven back home, no matter where they may be located. He obviously wanted you out of the battle and safe, so he sent you here to be tended to.”
“I think I’m overly symmetrical now,” Draco agonized, shifting the angle of his face as he continued to observe himself. “I look inhuman – it’s uncanny.”
You'll notice there is a change from the oneshot in regards to when Harry receives some information.
hurt. He heard a scramble and then a glass of water being pressed into his lips. “Thanks.” He chanced opening his eyes again. He tried to sit up but was met with intense pain. He cried out.
Harry was surprised at that, though he supposed he shouldn’t have been. While Harry spent time in St. Mungo’s over the summer, Draco spent some time getting acquainted with his pack. He knew he missed them. With the war done there was no pressure to hide from his true nature, his body allowing the wolf side of himself to flourish. Being with a pack would surely emphasize those instincts more.
James rolled his eyes. “Why, Draco?” he lamented. “I’m 21 years old, for the love of all that is good just call me James.”
Fenrir sighed and stood. “I’ll see what I can do. But for now, try to relax. If anything, this has given you a ticket out of the conflict. You’re just a child – you shouldn’t have been thrown into this.”
not make the papers?” Harry laughed at that. It was good to hear him laughing again, Draco realized. “Harry, I’m so sorry.”
As he felt himself drifting further, he suddenly felt James’s strong arms haul him up and they were moving quickly. He passed out as James bounded up the steps, letting darkness take over him.
Everything associated with Hogwarts seemed to be too difficult for Harry to bear. He thought going back to school would serve as a welcome distraction but being referred to as Mr. Black would shake him back to the harsh reality of his situation. He wished he would have just went by his actual name instead of trying to throw suspecting students off of his trail. They weren’t dumb: a new name wouldn’t keep them from the truth for long, especially when it looked as though Harry Potter was missing.
“Typical,” Draco lamented, lying back. He tried to will himself to calm but to no avail. “What happened?”
Draco reached for it with shaky hands. What would he see? He lifted it up to his face and drew in a breath. His left eye was perfect, mercurial silver but his right eye…His right eye was pitch black with no distinction between his pupil, iris, or cornea. Curious. “Oh.” He looked up at his mother and adoptive father, surprised to find he didn’t care nearly as much as he probably should. “I can see fine, though—how did this happen?”
Draco looked down, knowing Harry was right. He understood why Harry was so frightened about this vision: it frightened himself. “I can’t help my magic when someone I love is hurt,” he said finally after a few minutes of silence. “Maybe it’s you I’m healing in the vision. Maybe it’s Remus. Hell, maybe it’s Ginny or Ron or Hermione. The magic just manifests itself and takes me over. It’s almost like I’m possessed. I don’t have access to the Malfoy journals to see if any of my ancestors have learned how to curtail it.”
Sirius smiled. “Re has always been the parental type. Jamie and I—more hopeless I’m afraid. You’ll have to be a bit patient.”
It was an odd moment for Draco as the three stared at each other for what seemed like minutes. They seemed to be having a silent conversation as Harry awkwardly rolled his sleeves down to hide the bandages. He wasn’t ready for Ron and Hermione to see him like this. He felt ambushed.
you piss off to the middle of nowhere like you’re some sorry version of Robin Hood?’ Very clever, didn’t think you knew Robin Hood.”
“Sure.” Harry returned to the book, his brows furrowed in annoyance with the Slytherin. Why didn’t Slytherins leave anything lie? Blaise couldn’t help but fan the flames.
been close to a battle before—there had been no coup in taking Malfoy Manor, with his father essentially opening the door to the Dark Lord as soon as he could manage. He was, however, used to the constant stench of fear and death, which now increased tenfold with his wolfish sensibilities. His job in all of this was to try and remain hidden, healing those that came to him along the way. He spent hours in the midst of chaos healing cuts and bruises, even mending bones and minor spell damage where he could. Of course, this plan of lying in wait went right out the window when he witnessed Blaise take a hit to the chest with a curse he didn’t recognize, causing him to drop unceremoniously to the floor.
“I feel like a complete fraud.” Draco said. “Everyone has been so painfully nice to me lately and I don’t even deserve it. I wish I had just died saving him sometimes. I can’t take the despair any longer.”
“You seemed to need the sleep more. You looked a bit dead on your feet when you came in and you didn’t budge even when Fred and George set off a Christmas cracker.” She disappeared into the kitchen and came back with a tray filled with chicken, vegetables, roasted potatoes, and a large glass of water. “Mum saved you this.” She placed the tray in Draco’s lap who took one sniff and his stomach growled, giving away his hunger.
Draco looked down. “I’m sorry. I wanted to tell you. I thought Regulus knew best, seeing as he pretty much lives here.”
James laughed. “Makes sense with his proclivity to get into all sorts of trouble.” He looked at Harry. “Can I give you a hug? Haven’t been able to do that from afar.”
“I can’t believe you’re here,” James said, pulling away finally. He wiped a few tears from Harry’s face gently. “How did this change of appearance occur?”
“They’re putting you under?” Lucius interrupted. Draco had almost forgotten he was there, he was so quiet. Draco turned to look at his father and Lucius flinched as he got full view of his eyes.
“No, I did,” Draco replied, “startlingly so. I couldn’t believe a Muggleborn was besting me in class; it shook my foundational knowledge of the world. I began to question everything.”
“Even I have to agree with that,” Ron replied, “I’m not that fond of him but snakes can be cruel to those they think betrayed them. I wonder if Dumbledore will move him.” Draco’s eyes narrowed at this – they were obviously talking about him.
Regulus shrugged. “You’ve been around the Black Family enough, I reckon. So why have we all gathered to speak to me?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He was nervous to leave Harry like this; he was obviously distressed about something. “Okay, I’m going down to breakfast.” He promptly ran to find Remus.
“The real question,” Sirius’s voice echoed, “is how to get into Hogwarts while its crawling with Death Eaters.”
Pansy had been staring Draco down the entire meeting, obviously trying to grab his attention. He did his best to ignore her but he knew he’d have to talk to her eventually. He prayed to Merlin that it wasn’t tonight on the train. He felt spent the way it was, worrying about Zabini’s claws digging into an emotionally unstable Harry.
Being his wolf was the most exciting part of the night. He was still mentally in the back of his head, but the instinctive nature of the canine side of him took over, and he found himself letting loose and feeling joy running with the pack. He hadn’t felt this happy in a while. He stuck to Remus and Jack mostly, and they were happy to show him the ropes, nudging him along the trails, happily howling along with him at the moon. The joy ended abruptly in the morning when he painfully transformed back, leaving him retching.
“I can’t believe Jamie and I made you.” He then sat up in realization. “Jamie! He’s here. Do you want to say hello?”
“Well I’m not drinking anymore so there’s that,” Harry replied after a moment. “Probably needed the wakeup call.” That surprised Draco. “I honestly should say thanks to you and Ron. My magic has been much less volatile now that I’m sober. Only downside is withdrawl symptoms I suppose. Gotta sweat it out.” He drew his knees to his chest, resting his chin on his knees. He looked really fragile.
Mr. Black. Your potions work is dismal but you shouldn’t be slipping this far behind in Defense so early. You did receive an O, did you not?”
Bill smiled. “It’s quite literally the job description. No magic at all until we clear you, alright?”
Harry’s heart sank. He was going to be alone in the dorm to fend for himself. He looked at Ron, who looked back at him in confusion and concern.
“Your mum’s a saint,” he said before digging in. He was ravenous it turned out. Having something other than hospital food for the first time in a month was the best thing in the world to him. Well, almost the best thing in the world, he thought, as he watched Harry walk into the room.
“I know that—I didn’t want to make it a big deal.” He looked over at Blaise. “I guess not all Slytherins have mastered subtlety.”
“Do you think this is a good idea right now?” Draco replied, feeling the déjà vu of their first night back in the castle. It didn’t matter: he was so angry at Harry’s decision to get completely pissed after so much progress. It didn’t make sense to the blonde.
“He may have scented that the wolf was hurting. Maybe you weren’t dying but that’s how it read to him.” But Jack sounded doubtful.
“Piss off, Malfoy.” Now that stung. He hadn’t heard Harry refer to him as that in a while. Suddenly Harry weaved into the crowd and out of site.
When Draco emerged from the bathroom Remus was sat at the small table he had in the corner of his room. He seemed a little stressed—Draco couldn’t help but wonder what conversation was going to take place.
“Slytherins are always so dramatic. They left me behind too, you know. And I have quite a good right hook.”
Draco nodded, feeling awkward about Harry leaning on him so heavily when he just tried to kiss him minutes before. “We’ve been found out, it seems.”
“Harry, relax,” Remus replied. “It’s not some mystical force pushing upon Draco or anything. It just comes with the extra sensitivity. We can basically sniff our soulmates out. His emotions are his own, I promise you.”
Harry frowned again. “I didn’t realize that.” How did he go from a humble Half Blooded Potter to the Heir of the Black House in one night? What did that mean for him? Would he have to become like Draco – stiff and pointy and proper? He shuddered at the thought.
anyway. No dust was on the furniture, Draco noticed as he headed toward his final destination. The House Elves must still be tending to it with a new Heir being awakened and all. Nobody would have access to this place outside of the Lord and Heir; Draco only was able to pass because he was coming from Grimmauld Place, its only connection. He reached the garden quickly, having visited its contents quite frequently when his grandmother died years ago.
Remus nodded knowingly. “Without wolfsbane, the pull feels much more intimate, especially away from the pack.” Draco flushed at his choice of words, thinking about what he and Harry had gotten up to all weekend in the great quest of distracting him from the whole being a medium for the dead thing. “Are you excited to return?”
Remus nodded. “I’d like to see he’s okay with my own two eyes, anyway. I think he’s been at the colony long enough.” He looked at James. “How did this happen?”
The feast felt heavy for those whose last time in the castle was a time of loss and desperation. Harry felt himself regretting not going with Ron and his father when he had the chance. Ghosts in the more Muggle sense were littered throughout the hall. Harry couldn’t look in any direction without seeing a battle remnant, a fallen friend, a hurt companion. It was quite overwhelming.
Fenrir frowned. “I know—I’m sorry about that. I definitely caught your tendon, but I wanted to make sure it would take—it’s a little difficult to will it in human form.”
Draco sat next to Harry, nudging him gently with his shoulder. “You need to tell me when you’re tired. Go take a rest—Blaise and I will continue researching.”
“I dunno what to say, really. Thank you—I’ll have to speak to my guardians about it now that it’s been brought to my attention.” Draco smiled. “This is great news.”
Sirius just had a sly grin aimed towards the Irishman in question as he continued. “Mr. Finnigan is correct. Hold your groans. The past year, well years we should really say, were extremely challenging to your education, and especially in the last twelve months, learning wasn’t really the prime mode of existence here, was it? That’s fine, but we need to now catch you up in a way that helps you figure everything out while you’re still here.”
Harry frowned. “I’m not someone with a good sense of humour these days, I’m afraid.” He looked at Regulus, who was now staring back at him. “You’re suffering, then.”
Remus ran his hand through his sandy hair, not thrilled to be explaining why they were already past that juncture. “He’s had a pretty rough go since you’ve been gone.”
As the moon reached higher in the sky, it was time for the true celebration to begin. Everyone was instructed to collect some earth from the outer edges of the courtyard and make a circle around the fire. The magic thrummed around them as Harry began.
Fenrir huffed out a laugh. It really was a full circle moment. “It would be good if you stayed until at least after the full so I know you’re back on the up and up—is that alright with you?”
“I’m a curse breaker for Gringotts. Remus told me your vampire genetics are messing with your health. You look a bit peaky to be honest.”
To get Harry on the up and up finally, the American specialist had him suffer through a week of lengthy Native American rituals that included steaming himself, smudging around his forehead, and picking up some intense Cherokee spiritual cleansing spells. They had successfully, albeit painfully, forced the remnants out: it was like an exorcism only less head spinning and vomiting—well, without the head spinning at least.
Harry and Draco made their way down early to ensure everything was set up just right. A fire was lit at the center of it all as a welcoming hearth to guide the spirits to them. The altar already had food prepared as an offering to the spirits. Everything was perfect.
It wasn’t like Draco wasn’t trying to push his feelings down. But after he finally had an altercation with Blaise, he realized he was doomed to like Potter.
Instead, something strange came over him. Instincts took over and he grabbed hold of Harry’s arms tightly. He felt his magic bubbling over onto his fingertips. “
at him. He has a remark for everything and I couldn’t take the smugness any longer.” He sighed. “I lost it. I have the Black family madness, don’t I?”
Draco woke up to a scream and a crash, causing him to jolt out of bed. He looked to Harry’s bed – the absence of the green-eyed wonder making Draco feel queasy. His very sensitive ears picked up heavy breathing coming from the bathroom, where his vision was met by a closed door. Draco slowly approached the door, afraid Harry might spring out of it any minute. He chanced a knock. “Are you alright in there?” he asked.
“I’m tired of the Antares antics, Harry. You need to go to bed.” Draco said, steeling his nerves. He wasn’t going to let the Golden Boy win that easily.
Harry sighed. “It’s my trunk, actually.” He pulled out a pair of his father’s joggers and an old Ramones tshirt. He hadn’t really updated his sleepwear to fit his new height, settling for Sirius’s old wear. He pulled out his copy of the Odyssey as well, setting it on his bed.
Draco flinched a little at that—he could never fully assuage his guilt over his father’s hand in Ginny’s possession. He had apologized to her more times than he could count. “I remember him bringing the diary out of his study in conversation with Theo’s dad. They were trying to decide the best course of action. Mentioned a ring…”
The slope to Harry’s decision of attempting it again wasn’t linear. He would feel alright for most of the day, only to be haunted by nightmares and emptiness at night when his daily charms wore off. Only getting a good night’s rest two nights out of the week was draining and debilitating. He just simply could not continue like this.
“I was damaged. From Azkaban and falling through the veil. The Garden has been healing me. I’m actually almost ready to leave. I made it to the porch a few days ago. I was going to surprise you guys at Christmas but it looks like you’ve surprised me instead.” Sirius smiled at Harry again.
“Harry’s doing alright, considering. He’s here too. Same floor and everything.” Remus smoothed back Draco’s hair just like his father. The juxtaposition of the two men made Draco’s heart ache. He hated to admit that he missed the bastard, even if he threw him out in the cold. “You called on some ancestral healing magic, according to the Healers. Your father confirmed. Kind of cool, actually, if you ignore why you had to do it.”
“You’ll be lucky to be able to get out of bed in a week. Just focus on resting for now, alright? And maybe a future apprenticeship at St. Mungo’s.” His Healer gave him a wink as Draco let out a giggle. Must be the pain potion. Everything was getting a bit swirly.
“Dumbledore is on my list right now,” Sirius said curtly. “Don’t worry about what he said. For now, let’s just worry about Christmas, yeah?”
“Draco, stop.” He finally pulled his arm away from the Malfoy Heir and sat back down. “Healer Turner told me this might happen.” That caused pause in the werewolf, who crinkled his eyes in concern. At last he was listening. “The Dreamless Sleep didn’t work because of my Seeing abilities.”
Narcissa led them into the sitting room where tea was waiting for them. “Where’s father?” Draco asked.
The blonde felt Blaise shrug against him. “I’m just glad to see a familiar face.” Blaise pulled away, taking Draco fully in. It made him uncomfortable, as though he were being examined. “Is Harry here, too, then?”
I'm not sure whether to characterize this chapter as angst or fluff...maybe a bit of character exposition? Anyway, please berate my horrid understanding of UK regions in the comments!
Remus suddenly understood, sitting himself in the nearest armchair. “The Garden,” he repeated. “Of course, why didn’t I think of that?”
“Such a Potter,” he commented. He wrapped the fireplace with his wand like he did all those months ago, intoning “
The Healer ran a light scan over Draco. “Well, I’m putting you back on bedrest but I don’t think for long. A couple days and you’ll be right as rain.” Draco groaned in annoyance. “You didn’t lose any of the core, just tore it a bit. Please don’t cast above the level you’re ready for next time, okay?”
Harry ran his free hand shakily through his hair. His scar stood out starkly against his pale complexion. “The relief lasted for like 5 seconds until I fully realized what I’ve done. I was terrified and I tried calling out but only Myrtle could hear me. She was determined to have a stall mate and didn’t do anything. Thank Merlin you showed up.”
Harry nodded, steeling himself. “The dead came to me. From all sides. It-“ he paused again. “They were clamoring for my attention. Fred gripped me tightly and said so much. He wanted me to tell Ron something, but I can’t remember. My mum was there talking to me. Even Cedric. Even…” he started to get worked up again about it, feeling nauseous all over again.
Harry looked at Neville, who was now edging closer to him. He looked like he was losing his nerve. Harry stood up straight, feeling his full height as he towered a bit over Neville now. “I told you. It’s my trunk.” Neville narrowed his eyes, obviously not believing him. Harry sighed.
“Don’t believe everything you hear, Master Malfoy. I was rather Gryffindor when it came down to it, very heroic I’ll have you know.”
Remus pulled away and sized him up. “Are you feeling okay?” His eyes were crinkled with worry. “It’s going to be difficult getting you to the hospital, but we can do it if we need to. We’ll find a way.”
The green-eyed Gryffindor answered with a shrug of his shoulders. “It doesn’t absolve him of all the shite things he’s done but he really showed up when it counted—the courts should know that. He apparently was spying for us for months.”
Harry frowned. “Do you have to go?” It was already Wednesday and Draco and Remus would be taking leave the next morning. Fenrir had set up a Floo point in their apartment to make it more convenient, but Draco wanted to spend the day with the pack before the moon rose. Harry was already beginning to feel wary.
Dumbledore looked down in shame. “I am sorry, Harry. I have taken things too far with you in the hopes of helping wizardkind. My scope was too large, I fear.”
The wit took Draco aback. He always was taught that Regulus was more stoic than his brother. Maybe death loosened him up. “I’m Draco,” he said, and Regulus’s eyes looked like they were about to pop out of his head.
Harry rolled his eyes but was grinning. He’d grown used to Pansy’s sarcasm over the past weeks. “Morning,” he said, reaching for a slice of toast. Another benefit of running was that he was always hungry: it had really been helping him put some weight back on. He pecked Draco on the cheek, who flushed. “How did you sleep, love?”
Harry, nonplussed, just shook his head. “I know his family leans light, but do you mind if we kept him out of the details for now? Dumbledore doesn’t even want me telling anyone about this.”
After the final battle was won with all of the horcruxes gathered and destroyed, Harry slept. He slowly retreated from his mourning family and snuck into the Gryffindor dorms (which were thankfully still intact) and curled up in his four poster. He supposed they would find him eventually, but his bones have never felt wearier and the sudden emptiness that comes along with fulfilling one’s life-role had him experiencing true exhaustion.
Ron and Draco met the next morning in Draco’s room this time after the ebony-haired wonder left. “Have you told Granger about how bad he’s getting?” Draco asked.
Sirius piped up at that. “Next week—I’m scheduling him a session. Harry wanted to wait until he built some strength back up.”
She looked a little worn but still as regal as ever. Remus stood to give the two some space. “I’ll just be down the hall,” he said.
“My uncle, I know.” Harry sighed. “Black is fine. Apologies if I don’t respond right away; haven’t trained myself to consider myself Mr. Black yet.”
“Tea?” Draco asked, moving to the kitchenette to put the kettle on. He demanded his nerves to calm—he wouldn’t show weakness.
Remus smiled at that. “Yeah, I guess it is. I can’t believe the Healers didn’t brief you personally yet about this. They said you’ll still feel the pull of the moon probably, might get more instinctual, and if you were to bite someone during the full they’d probably turn.” Draco’s ears turned red at the prospect of biting someone. “But, as it stands, when you gave Harry part of your core, you gifted some of those traits to him. As your core heals, that half will be brand new—no werewolf bits.”
Harry worked with McGonagall and found himself frustrated with Transfiguration. His problem was overpowering everything. He’d transfigure things so strongly he couldn’t shift them back. He felt bad for the frog he had permanently doomed to being a tea saucer. McGonagall had commented that at least if he went into a job where Transfiguration was needed, his clients would be happy his spell work held up. He was honestly hopeless.
“We can’t know for sure unless you indulge me in a little experiment.” He rummaged through his bag pulling out a familiar potion bottle.
“You know what I mean,” he huffed. He then inched closer to Draco so that their noses were almost touching. All Draco could really see were his eyes and suddenly it was if he was with the old Harry. It made him excited and frustrated all at once. Harry made a move to wrap his arms around Draco, but Draco backed away further into his room, realizing what was being propositioned here.
“He’s stable,” Turner assured Sirius, who let out a little sigh of relief. “We restricted his magic a little, however. He can’t resist the urge of letting his magic out when highly stressed and we need to get that under control. Could have helped to know he was a wandless caster—he grazed my arm with a nasty stinging hex when he came to.” There
Harry barked out a laugh. It was funny how he was able to sound so much like Sirius at times. “So scientific.”
“Just keep your head up and stay vigilant,” Severus advised. “Look out for those who wish to harm you and take the help of those who offer it. You’re in a good position, out in the open or not. You just need to play it smart.”
Draco suddenly realized something. “The moon is coming,” he said, panic beginning to settle in. “How am I supposed to transform here? They haven’t given me wolfsbane and I’m bedridden.”
There it was. Both Sirius and Harry would be testifying for his father? With those two at his corner, he’d barely get a slap on the wrist. Draco didn’t get it—the man made their lives hell. The Slytherin’s eyes narrowed. “Why?”
Harry frowned. “Lengthy and invasive. They seemed to figure it out, though. They’re calling in a specialist from America. They’ll be here tomorrow. Apparently they know how to deal with this without making things worse.” Harry seemed distraught at the prospect of being poked and prodded by someone new. “I can’t wait for them to heal my arms, though. They hurt all of the time.”
Harry looked at her oddly, as if he had realized she was still in the room. “Uh, yeah,” he replied lamely, scratching the back of his head with his hand awkwardly. “Nothing to worry about.”
Draco wasn’t feeling so optimistic when the morning came and he suddenly transformed back with a snap to all his ligaments at once. He yelled out in pain. Remus woke and stretched, leaving the room to transform back as Draco found a blanket to cover himself with. He tore his clothes last night transforming, he realized. He groaned, feeling a headache blossoming as his body radiated pain.
It was night and day from his first arrival, he’d have to admit. The Weasleys had grown quite comfortable with Draco around, finally convinced he wasn’t feeding information back to his family. After Bill had helped him out, he felt as though he became part of the brood. It made him a bit warm to think about it.
“It’s not their fault,” Draco interrupted, nipping an infamous Potter-Black doom spiral before it began. “I am fine.” He looked down, heat rising to his cheeks. “I just acted rashly in the last hour or so is all.”
Harry pursed his lips in concentration. “Let me see. Turn towards me.” Draco rolled his eyes but begrudgingly obliged. Harry gave Draco a proper once over, his green eyes slowly roaming over his body. Draco felt heat rise to his cheeks, feeling more like a specimen than a person. He never imagined Potter of all people to be looking at him like this and he never felt so insecure. He forced himself to get a grip as Harry’s eyes roamed back up, meeting his own. A grin formed on his face, shocking Draco – Potter hadn’t smiled like that in weeks. “Show me your teeth?” Draco’s eyes widened but obliged. “Hm. Looks completely ordinary to me – a little more angular and wavier hair, sure, but you’re the same old pointy Draco we all know and begrudgingly tolerate. Can we go get some food now? I’m starved.”
“Partial starvation and living off the land?” Sirius blanched. “Just kidding—but not really, I suppose.”
“Piss off Ron.” Harry swept out of the room and into Draco’s, who was a little more forgiving when he crawled into his four-poster and cried.
Sirius sighed dramatically. “No, Draco. We need to discuss how the year will carry out. Special 8th Year stuff, you know.”
Winter was bitter and cold at Hogwarts after the holidays. The snow seemed never ending, keeping students mostly indoors save for the odd Herbology class or Hogsmeade trip. With Harry off most of the time doing Merlin-knows-what with Dumbledore, Draco was beginning to get cabin fever. There were only so many games of chess he could play with Weasley before he completely lost it. Though, he supposed things could be worse.
Harry got up and knelt by Draco’s feet. He put his hands in Draco’s lap, reaching for his hands. Draco reluctantly let him grab hold. “I am so sorry, Draco. I know it was stupid. I was lucky it wasn’t malicious. I
He meandered down the train, peering into each compartment as inconspicuously as possible. He was about to call it quits after not catching a hint of the dark haired teen, but he lucked out in the dining compartment: he and Pansy of all people were seated at a table.
“Is that what happened?” Harry asked. “I remember him looking over me, and Uncle Regulus too, and some people I didn’t recognize. I thought they were bringing me into the Garden.”
Remus rolled his eyes and sat next to Draco. He rested his hand gently over Draco’s, ignoring Lucius’s commend. It had a nice calming effect. Pack mate perk, he supposed. “We’ve been arguing just about every day. Your father is insane.”
“That’d make it three down, one caught, three to go,” Harry replied in awe. “I can’t believe it was under our noses the entire time.”
He closed his eyes as he felt the potion’s effects ease his pain somewhat. Unfortunately, he was wide awake and it seemed to be midnight. He was alone for the first time in awhile. It felt unsettling. He looked at the table to see that Molly had dropped off food for him. He was suddenly ravenous. At the thought of wanting to have the basket closer to him it appeared on his lap. He jumped suddenly and yelled out in pain. A Healer rushed back into the room.
Draco’s first week at Grimmauld Place was decidedly lonely. Everyone tended to give him a wide berth in the vast house, especially as the rumors of his motives behind wanting asylum swirled and transformed dramatically from person to person. He heard Weasley and Granger conspiring in the corner one day about how bright his eyes seemed to be, and attempted to attribute it to being under some sort of Imperius variation. Draco resisted outing himself again – Granger was too nosy for her own good and would put two and two together soon enough. If anything, his depleting health from the looming full moon would be a dead giveaway when the time came.
"Well maybe I don't want saving!" Draco burst out. His eyes widened at the realization of what he said and he bolted back to his room, slamming the door behind him. Remus was right behind him, banging loudly on the door as Draco covered his head with a pillow. "Go away! I didn't mean it! I was just mad!"
All Harry knew for sure was that he seemed to be doomed to have a busy year for the rest of his life.
Sirius shook his head. “No, thank you, Draco. I’m actually going to be hanging out just outside so the two of you can chat. Is that alright?”
Harry believed that he had seen enough bloodshed and battle before this day to be prepared for the waste about to be laid out before him—however, he had no idea what was to come. It felt like an ongoing explosion, with spells flying from every direction, some people resolving to Muggle means of fighting, and constant movement surrounding him—it was enough to feel dizzy with fear and anxiety. With little time to recognize just who had fallen and who was on whose side, Harry rushed about to gather the remaining horcruxes and destroy them, unwilling to let his mind dissolve into madness at the thought of Draco, Remus, and his father being in the depths of the castle themselves, fighting their way through. He had a mission to attend to and would kindly see a Mind Healer much later for all of the trauma he would bear witness to, thank you very much.
The Healer rushed over and did a quick scan with her wand. “Okay. Everything is normal. Sorry, the healing process is going to be a bit lengthy. You essentially donated half of your core to Mr. Potter. It needs time to regenerate.”
Harry sighed. “I saw you reading it before you fell through the Veil. I started reading to feel closer to you, but I suppose I’ve been feeling a bit of kinship with the protagonist.”
It was messy and desperate and had entirely too much teeth but it was the best kiss Draco ever had. It was like Harry was pouring himself into him and he was addicted. He reached up his hand to tangle it in Harry’s mane, bringing him closer. Harry climbed on top of him and Draco rose to meet him, only to cry out in intense pain. It felt like his chest was tearing.
The elder wolf looked larger than life, his long auburn hair wild about him, muscles flexed in his plain brown robes. As Greyback’s eyes narrowed at him time seemed suspended and everything slowed. He couldn’t hear the battle going on any longer—Draco realized Greyback had somehow created a shield around them in this moment, blocking everything out. He’d have to learn this wolf trick himself, he mused, but there were more important matters to attend to.
Remus just shrugged. “It’s true, though.” He sat next to her and sipped on the coffee he had. “Very glad
Draco linked up with Pansy once back in the rooms. “Here to sell out my boyfriend again, Pans?” he asked in a joking tone, but his eyes were narrowed.
Bill Weasley was there with him—he looked different in Healers’ scrubs—dark purple for his curse specialty. He had taken up post at St. Mungo’s after moving home for the foreseeable future as he helped take care of his family. He looked good in dark purple, Draco mused.
“It’s going to get better, Draco. The cane won’t be forever and you’ve been getting on well with everyone. You’ve made so much progress.” Remus said. Draco was wiping his face with the sleeve of his sweater: a gift from Molly. It was a deep shade of blue with a white ‘D’ on the front and had almost made Draco burst into tears when he opened it.
Harry just laughed at that. He’d never quite get over how close Draco and Ginny were. It was cute, really. “I’m sure she has other ideas with what she wants to do with Blaise,” he suggested.
Draco did not wake during his second full moon, at least he was not aware that he did. It was with heavy lidded eyes that he awoke the following afternoon, once again feeling worse for wear. Bill was leaning over him, his ponytail almost touching Draco’s chest. Once he realized Draco was awake, a large grin split over his face. “Welcome back,” he said, and then looked over his shoulder, “you can relax now, Remus, told you he’d be fine.”
Now Harry was beginning to feel attacked on a level deeper than his supposed exhaustion. “Just keep trying to drive that wedge, Zabini.”
Harry was just poking around at his plate, not really touching anything. He sighed. “I know. It’s hard after bad nights. I get queasy.” He picked up a piece of toast and started working at it.
Harry couldn’t help but feel as though he was running out of time. It felt like he couldn’t go on much longer, not without rest, not without people beginning to expect something from him again. He tried to push those feelings down as best as he could, but it settled just below the surface as time wore on.
“Well I have these friends as of late who knew your brother quite well.” Regulus hummed in response, looking a bit far off.
“Of course,” Sirius replied, sitting opposite him. James flopped down onto a loveseat and stretched. Sirius smiled lovingly at him. Harry could tell that he was also glad to have him back and Harry’s chest ached for his past self, so lonely and scared. He could have never dreamed a life like this was possible and was glad he was saved not once but twice from himself to experience this. “When he arrives we’ll get out of your hair. Do you want to go down to the village after? Might be fun.”
Harry sighed and looked down again. “I didn’t want to make a fuss. I thought the Garden would just—I dunno—
Albus Dumbledore was dead. He was murdered by Severus Snape when Theodore Nott could not bring himself to kill his headmaster. It was obvious to Draco that Theodore had been some sort of pawn of his parents to prove their loyalty to the Dark Lord: it was quite common amongst his kind. Of all places, it happened on the Astronomy Tower surrounded by a score of Death Eaters. Draco’s head wouldn’t stop spinning about Snape doing the deed: couldn’t someone,
Draco was solemn, though. “It’s true. You’ve told me about this terrifying vision and old Draco would agree with you that it’s best to stay here where I’m safe. And I’m not trying to martyr myself, but I will become a martyr if that means saving the people I love. I’m not afraid of splitting my core again. Not if that means you, or Remus, or anyone I love can live.”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t have much to go off of so I think you’re good. Can I see Dad today? I think it would make me feel better.”
“Your father disowned you informally. Your mother did not.” Remus, sensing why Draco was so touchy about the guardianship subject, squeezed his hand gently. “You’re not going back there. I promise.”
“The Black Family has a connection to the veil.” Harry shuddered at the word, remembering Sirius falling through last year. “It’s legend that Mother Magik blessed the family at some point: unique eyes are always a tell for that. Anyway, when members of the Black Family die, they can still converse with other family members in this garden. The veil is nearly nonexistent here. They’re more than a spirit here. You could touch them. I used to visit my grandfather here a lot as a child.”
