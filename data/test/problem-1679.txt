‘Thank you! I like your hair too!’ Daphne’s hair was much shorted than Draco remembered it at school, although he’d never paid that much attention. Once upon a time, his parents had wanted him to marry Daphne – and later her younger sister Astoria when that hadn’t gone to plan. Thankfully he’d managed to grow some balls and point-blank refused.
‘Mind spells? That sounds a bit Mickey Mouse.’ There was a pause. ‘Oh, that’s a muggle thing. It means its sounds made up.’
There was something warm on his cheek. He turned his face towards it, but it kept moving further away. He rolled over, trying to get closer to the source when he heard a chuckle.
‘Excuse me,’ Draco knew he’d have to tread carefully here, but there was something off about this. ‘Is there something else I should know? I understand that this case is urgent but foregoing paperwork is another kind of urgency.’ Ever since the war the Ministry had become increasingly tight with its paperwork in an attempt to clamp down on the misuse of resources and corruption.
‘What makes you think I know?’ Harry asked him, and Draco raised a single eyebrow at him.
‘But you
‘Nothing on this earth would ever make me chose you over him. Get that through your thick skull and don’t call me like that ever again. You might have something against me, but I can do just as much damage and unlike you, I don’t care if I lose my reputation in the process.’ He released Wood and stalked off into the mist.
That wasn’t a situation Draco was willing to accept. At varying points of his desperation, he had even considered going into the Ministry and finding Potter himself, but the consequences of being caught were more than he could bear. He was already watched everywhere he went, which was precisely nowhere.
‘Hm. Really? Sure feel like one to me.’ After a few minutes of pretending to be annoyed, Harry caved and returned to his default – running his hands gently through Draco’s hair.
‘Hi. Who are you?’ She gave him her best mum look which only made his smile grow a fraction.
‘If Harry had told you why I was practicing magic, you probably wouldn’t say that.’ He didn’t wait for her to reply, he simply kissed her cheek and let himself out. He didn’t know how Harry would feel about everything that had happened before Draco’s stint in hospital, but he knew he wasn’t ready to go home and deal with it all, particularly as Teddy wouldn’t even be there. That was perhaps the greatest kick in the teeth. The new year had barely even started as far as he was concerned, and yet he’d probably already won worst parent of the year.
‘What? Draco! No! Delete that. I bet I look ridiculous!’ Draco shook his head and hid the camera behind his back.
Harry didn’t react. Draco could feel the seconds tick by as slow as Harry’s much-loved treacle. Harry was rejecting him, wasn’t he? He didn’t want Draco here. Just as he was about to pull away and roll away from him, Harry’s hand came to rest over Draco’s and his heart stuttered. He held his breath as if any movement would make Harry pull away again.
No, I don’t suppose it did.”
But now there were papers strewn everywhere, some of which were from before he’d started coming here, and he couldn’t handle it any longer. He started with a stack of mail which had accidently been delivered to this address. The new owl he’d purchased he’d left behind in France in the furore that had been in incident and he’d simply assumed Spungen had been looking after her. He wasn’t really sure now.
‘I’m very sorry about that. I don’t think you have anything to hide but the healer said it might upset the other patients.’ Draco had been studiously avoiding looking at anyone else in the ward since he didn’t want to think about where in the hospital he was. So long as he wasn’t anywhere near the Janus Thickey Ward he supposed he’d be ok.
“Malfoy, please. People will die.” It’s manipulative of him to say it, he knows, but it’s not wrong. He can see the moment the gears start turning in Malfoy’s mind. He places the cup gently on its saucer and sets it down on the coffee table. He straightens up his shirt as he sits back up, like he means business.
He flinched as a particularly vicious pain lanced down his left side and a large shadow appeared across his vision before he felt his eyes roll into the back of his head and he was overcome by darkness again.
‘Harry has enough to deal with already.’ It was simple but it was true.
The heavy pub door slammed loudly when he stepped outside, having been shoved closed by the strong wind that was whistling through the alley. Other than the flickering lights of the pub, Diagon Alley was quiet. In the short time since the war there were shops that had never reopened and the street was still recovering as everything settled into normalcy. In the dark, Fred’s face loomed ominously move the Weasley joke-shop, the moonlight catching his features wrong and casting frowning shadows over him. Harry had come to think of the face of Weasley Wizard Wheezes as Fred, even though that hadn't been the original intention. It made him feel like Fred was still there with them, watching over the business and tipping his hat in greeting whenever anyone walked by. Harry had never said so aloud, but he was sure that if he did his friends would probably agree.
‘Aunt Molly has been teaching me!’ He said proudly, puffing his chest out. ‘It’s not much, but I tried! Is it ok?’ His face fell for a second as his eyes flickered nervously between Harry and Draco sitting next to each other on the sofa, no doubt with equally surprised expressions on their faces.
‘You remember. When you didn’t identify me at the Manor, and I disarmed you. Do you ever find it weird that it was this wand that destroyed Voldemort? I’m sorry I took so long to give it back to you. Once I fixed my own I totally forgot…’ Harry’s voice trailed off into background noise when Draco was hit with waves of memory flashes. Dark flickers of cold hallways and meetings and hiding behind his bedroom door in blind panic.
Harry left the pub quickly, feeling fettled. Malfoy had the ability to strip Harry’s outer layer off like he was pealing an orange. If Harry had been less flustered, he might have noticed that the crowd of people nearby were not just the regular punters. If he had been less disconcerted by Malfoy’s display of something akin to warmth, he may have noticed the flash of a camera. As it happened, Harry noticed neither of these things. However, unbeknownst to him, Malfoy definitely had, and it would come back to bite them both later.
When he arrived, he was surprised to find the room stacked full of boxes. The numerous bookshelves which had once been crammed with thick tomes where now sparse, the photographs on the desk packed away.
By the time they arrived at Level 2, Draco’s heart was pounding in his ears and the hairs on the back of his neck prickled with fear. His arms were no doubt turning purple in the grip of the Hit Wizards, but he dared not utter a word. He was brought to a large desk where a group of Patrol Wizards were standing in a crowd. This was where he would be registered and taken to a holding cell before questioning, if he remembered correctly. He’d now experienced this situation both knowing and not knowing what was in store, and he wasn’t sure which was worse.
“I was going to,” he lied, and silently prayed to every god he could think of when Pansy handed him his wand and he cast a quick drying charm on his hair. Never before had he forgotten to do his hair, he hadn’t so much as walked from the bathroom to his bed in the dorms without at least drying it first. Stupid Potter.
with me?’ Her voice was so small and broken he just wanted to scoop her up in his arms and promise her the earth, but he refrained.
‘I’m not playing games, Potter. I’m on the verge of getting you the evidence you need to prove the clinic is involved in this damn case and to be honest the sooner this case is solved the better. We’ve been monitoring Hopkirk and Runcorn for weeks now and we’ve still got no tangible evidence to link them to the case.’ Draco’s fuse was very short at the minute and Harry had always known how to get under his skin.
“P-Potter! What the hell are you doing here?!” It was disappointing that the serenity was gone, but Harry sort of liked the fierceness in her grey eyes as she glared at him. It also felt like some kind of spell had broken, although there was none involved but the weather jar. Having Malfoy stare at him in irritation reminded him that this was
‘It’s still empty!’ Draco could hardly believe his eyes. ‘When I came here, even though I had the chateau I really wanted to open my own apothecary. No one has been investing in mental health related potions and mine were actually starting to work. I was making some purely herbal type things too – just relaxants and things. You know, since sticking potions down people’s throats doesn’t just solve mental health issues. This was where I was going to set up shop but then…’ He didn’t want to talk about that day. He had never fully explained what happened to anyone except Harry.
‘I’m afraid I can’t let you leave, Draco. Not until you give me what I need.’ He was tall and menacing, his face twisted by the darkness. Draco took a step back.
What other life was he supposed to have? He couldn’t work anymore, could he? He was only here because he had to be, he didn’t believe for one minute that this child understood anything of what Draco had been through and what’s more, he didn’t think it was relevant to his current issue in any way. It wasn’t as though he didn’t want his magic back. His life was difficult enough already.
Teddy rushed off upstairs the second they got home – presumably to play with some of his Christmas presents, and Draco flopped bonelessly onto the sofa. He spent a lot of time there these days. He channel surfed for a few minutes but if he was being completely honest he wasn’t really bothered about television, so he ended up pulling out his journal and wrote about how Christmas had been and Harry’s disappearance earlier. Two hours later and no sign of Harry or Teddy, Draco was getting irritable.
‘You told the Weasel and you didn’t tell me?’ Draco’s tone was icy. What the fuck? How could he tell someone entirely unrelated and keep Draco in the dark like that?
‘I’ll come with you! I mean, I don’t need to sleep but maybe I could stay with you? I don’t want to be too far away if something happens and uh…I think I might get lost? This place is huge.’ He turned around on the spot and took in the room around them. It wasn’t even the fanciest of the rooms in the chateau, and it was a particularly dull and wintery day which didn’t show off the room’s potential very well. The ceilings were as high as one might expect from a French architect with far too much money and not enough sense. The colour scheme was one of Draco’s favourites though. Pansy, bless her heart, had nearly bitten his head off when he’d suggested ivory and vermillion – she’d almost fainted with the prospect of Draco wanting to decorate anything remotely pertaining to Gryffindor. Draco patiently pointed out that ivory and vermillion were vastly different shades than gold and maroon.
‘To what do I owe the pleasure?’
‘Spungen, sir. I welcome you back to
‘Daphne no I couldn’t with all good consciousness let you do this free. It’s Boxing Day for crying out loud.’
When Draco arrived home that evening, he began planning how he would pack his things for his move to France. From his desk he’d sent a Ministry owl to the letting agent and asked them for a bolt-on lease earlier than his current lease started since he knew the apartment was already empty. He didn’t want to start packing before he knew he could go earlier so he contented himself with planning.
‘Yeah of course he is. I just meant…never mind. It doesn’t matter.’
Century, although they found the remains of the originals a few years ago. I don’t remember exactly how long. Honestly, you just can’t trust muggles with anything.’ He turned his head to look at Harry. He found him staring at him wistfully. ‘What?’
Draco thought. Harry had learned to drive a muggle car and sometimes took Teddy out in it. Draco hated the thought of being trapped in a lump of metal hurtling down narrow lanes with nothing but a few bits of plastic to cushion the blow. He’d always take a broom over a car.
‘You’re right. As always. I’m sorry to distract you from your work.’ He stood and smoothed the creases out of his trousers. He turned to go but was stopped when she flung herself at him. She smelled like fresh flowers and as odd as the connection was, it sort of reminded him of his mother.
the dead or
‘He calls you Daddy, you know.’ Draco finally caved and sat on his sofa next to Harry.
‘And then Professor Flitwick said that Wingardium Leviosa was developed in the sixteenth century. Can you imagine? That was so long ago! And the man who invented it, he jumped of a church roof while singing the national anthem and-’
He also didn’t want to be a voyeur of that particular departure; he knew how difficult Pansy could make things.
‘You’re not Head Auror anymore.’ Draco said as soon as she closed the door behind her, and Harry had the decency to look embarrassed.
He jumped when something cold was pressed against his forehead and a glass of water was pushed into his hand. He gulped it down and sighed with relief when the world stopped spinning.
She pursed her lips in thought. ‘I’m not an expert on this, Draco. Having said that, I’m not sure anyone is. It’s practically unheard of. What did Smith say about these memories?’
When he reached the trees he stood very still, took a deep breath, and recited: “
She stared at him as if she was expecting him to say something else. “Hermione’s here and she wants to talk to you. It’s important.” Instantly his heartrate went through the roof.
“You’re right,” he says when Draco seems calm enough, “I have no idea what it’s like. But I know Orion loves you and he’ll be doing everything he can to get back home.” There’s not much Harry can do for Draco, but he wishes there was.
‘And there’s this sweet little girl called Ella…’ Draco interjected when Harry began talking about how they were trying to educate the children. Bill seemed genuinely interested and offered help wherever he may be useful, although Draco couldn’t imagine what his expertise in cursebreaking would be useful for…
‘Thank you Pans. It would be nice if I could get some support for once.’ He made a point to subtly remind her of the backlash he received both during and after his divorce. He turned back to his bloods and began casting diagnostic spells. He knew Pansy was here for something more than that, but she was never all that good at confrontation.
He said as much to Hermione when they had lunch at the Ministry the next day. They’d been having lunch together once a week since Draco had started working there. Hermione said the familiarity would help him settle in much better and she wasn’t wrong.
It was then that he could no longer fight the calling from the tapestry. His eyes found Draco instantly and he fought the wave that came over him when they did. It was hard to describe how it made him feel. Maybe he should have been scared, but he wasn’t. It was difficult to be scared when so much of it didn’t make any sense. There could be a simple explanation for it all. Maybe Narcissa and Lucius had expected a boy and ended up with a girl. Maybe the fabric of the tapestry had been so damaged by all the burns that the magic had failed. Maybe he was just seeing things.
“I was trying to use my left hand.”
He’d made it now though, so he may as well drink it. He sat at the kitchen table and looked across the open space. He’d always been pleased he’d made sure they had an open plan living space, it made him feel less contained, less trapped. The Christmas tree twinkled brightly in the far corner, currently devoid of any presents. Draco briefly wondered whether the orphanage would teach the children about Santa Claus. Teddy had never believed in Father Christmas, although Harry had been sure to tell him about it. Draco thought the whole thing was ludicrous.
Draco rolled his eyes. ‘If you don’t like it, cast a translation charm. Don’t they teach you those in Auror 101?’
Harry has never heard Draco talk this way. It’s not as if he doesn’t have feelings per se, it’s just that the Malfoy family as a whole isn’t especially expressive. In fact, for the first six months Harry was partnered with Draco’s twin Orion, he was convinced the guy didn’t like him at all. Then he found out Orion actually volunteered Harry’s name for promotion, even though it would split their partnership up. Slytherins. They’re impossible.
‘I have a solution!’ He proposed suddenly. He ignored Harry’s bewildered look as he took off down the hall towards his old potions lab. He kept the key in his pocket at all times, now simply a habit, which stuck in the lock a little. It did that sometimes in the cold.
‘You too Mrs Weasley. Sorry it’s taken me so long.’
‘Really? Man? Woman? Neither? Both?’ Draco asked him. She certainly wasn’t behaving like it. He assumed she’d hate him a little less once she’d found herself someone. She’d only had brief flings up until now – he wasn’t even sure why he was so interested anyway, it was no skin off his nose.
‘It’s not so weird now. I missed you guys a lot last term. Am I going to come home every time Daddy is sick? Is he going to keep getting sick?’ Some of Teddy’s enthusiasm bled away. It seemed he’d half-forgotten why he was home.
“Nothing, I was just working on the wards. No time to explain. I really need to go now, ok? You’ll be alright here?” It was a stupid question because nothing was going to stop him leaving, but she nodded anyway.
‘Is that why you were home late?’ He asked Draco instead of dwelling on it. ‘How was the conference?’ Draco had been away for four nights on a curse-breaking conference in Switzerland and Harry had missed him terribly.
‘Um. I just thought I’d have something here. In case…I don’t know. It just seemed like a good idea.’ He said sheepishly. He went over to the windows to reopen the shutters by hand, mostly so he wouldn’t have to look at Harry, but also so that Harry wouldn’t see the flush he could feel blossoming over his cheeks. He was a hopeless romantic at heart – though people would find out over his dead body.
‘I’m going to help her, and she can come and play with you, yeah?’ Johnny looked up and Harry and held out his hand. He tottered for a minute before he slapped a kiss on Draco’s cheek.
“Would you pass me my bag? It’s on the back of your chair.” Granger released Pansy’s hand to let her retrieve a small beaded bag. It went everywhere with Granger although Draco had never asked her what was in it. She stuck her hand in up to the elbow and Draco realised it was imbued with a sizing charm. Very clever. After a few seconds of rummaging and the occasional crash of things being knocked over, Granger pulled out a thin, shimmering length of fabric that Draco recognised instantly.
“That’s- awful. And wrong.” In that moment it was like the gentle breeze from the weather jar had given him a gust of the kind of confidence he’d never had before, “you’re beautiful exactly as you are.” And he meant it.
“Don’t look at me like that,” Harry snapped. “I’m not the one who doesn’t know how to behave.” The fox didn’t look the slightest bit chastened, so Harry stomped off to call Luna. The fox followed him as he looked for his phone and it grated on his nerves. Walking two feet behind him as he searched through drawers and cupboards, whining at him for attention, the fox looked rather sorry for itself, although Harry knew full well it was only sorry it got caught.
‘YOU CAN’T MOVE TO FRANCE!’ Hermione shouted in Draco’s face. He’d asked her to have lunch with him to tell her about his plans for project
‘Of course he can’t, but he’s also from a long time ago when clever little girls like you weren’t nearly as big and strong.’ He wasn’t really equipped to deal with this, he still felt out of his depth with Teddy, but he was immensely proud of her intuition. He should introduce her to Hermione, they’d get along like a house on fire.
“You would tell me, if you knew there was something wrong, wouldn’t you?” He thought about that. It was odd for her to be invested in him, the fragile new intimacy between them seemed like something he should cradle carefully in his hands. He didn’t know that he could tell her anything at all. He might be going slowly mad. But was it better to lie and save face or to tell her the truth?
Of course, he couldn’t find the words to explain any of this to Harry, so instead he let out a choked sob and collapsed against him. Harry didn’t even hesitate to wrap his arms around him and let him cry against his shoulder. Ironically, the tears beaded against Harry’s robes and rolled straight off – all Ministry approved robes were complete with permanent impervius charms. Draco felt Harry’s hand on the back of his head as he held him to his chest and the tiny gesture, something Harry had done all the time when they’d been together, nearly broke Draco.
‘No not here.’ He told her, ‘I saw him before-’
“Move!” She shouted urgently and they took off down the corridor. Draco didn’t think the man had seen them, but he guessed that Granger wasn’t taking any chances. It was much harder to run as the muggle because his legs were rather short compared to Granger’s long ones. He took to following the flapping of her dusty yellow robes which were all he could see in the dim light. They twisted and turned through what felt like hundreds of rooms that all looked the same as the last to him, until suddenly it opened out into a cavernous space.
Except there was no easy way to say it. How could he explain to someone he had hated for longer that he’d liked that he had weird dreams about a man trapped in an archway in a forest after following an imagined version of a fox that randomly showed up at his flat in the middle of the night. And how, after explaining all of that, would he then go on to say that the mystery forest man looked just like said person and he wasn’t entirely sure that said person was actually real.
He checked under his pillow – no, that was Harry’s place. He checked in the back of his wardrobe – only his mother’s jewellery box. He opened the drawer of his bedside table – only a pair of reading glasses and a book he’d half finished. Finally, he walked over to Harry’s old Hogwarts trunk. They kept it as a storage unit since Harry had never wanted to let it go. Draco rarely went into it – it served almost as a giant memory box. He lifted the lid carefully and scanned the contents. An old
Before she stepped out of the front door, Draco memorised the clothes Granger wore so that he would be able to find her again. They’re nothing like what he is used to seeing her wear when going to the Ministry. The bright red of her law firm has been replaced by a dowdy yellow; the sort of yellow that was once white but had been too damaged by the sun. They were an old style, too broad across her shoulders and hips and pulled in tight around her waist. It made her look waspish and older than she was.
‘Oh god this is such a mess.’ Harry said with a frustrated groan. He rubbed his temples as if staving off a bad headache. Draco knew from experience that Harry was prone to migraines. He always said that it might be some residual magic left from the Horcrux. It would made sense it would accumulate where Harry’s scar was, but Harry refused to see a healer.
When he spoke again, he sounded so hopeful it was almost pitiful. ‘Really?’
Pansy came to sit on the piano stool with him. Usually he hated it when she did that but today, he didn’t have the heart to turf her out. “Draco, before you go, would you play for me…?” She rested her chin on his shoulder and looked up at him with puppy eyes.
“Do you think we’re doing the right thing? You know they’ve given up looking.” Her words came as a punch to his stomach. He had pinned all sense of morality on Granger being the better person of the two of them, but over the course of the past month he had discovered just how far she was willing to go.
Peter was frozen in place, apparently shocked by his own actions, and Snape found himself incapable of even looking at the men. As Pyrites got into the room, he immediately raised his wand to the boy behind Lily’s body, and started casting the Killing Curse when, all of a sudden all three Death Eaters buckled - the mark in their arms burning. Only, it wasn’t the regular pain of being called upon, but the blaze of the harsher lines fading – and that could only mean one thing.
Hermione also pointed to other students out of bed, names she vaguely recognized as older Slytherins, in the hallway of the DADA classroom.
scars.
Later, during defense class, Draco approached him “My name’s Draco”. Harry just stared at him, his mouth slightly open.
“I know things have been tense with them lately, specially Dad, because of this Pettigrew thing...” Tessa lowered her voice, making it more soothing. She used her other hand to grab one of his, the one that wasn’t petting the cat. Harry squeezed it back, although his gaze was still fixed outside the window.
Okay, that was a complete exaggeration. But he recognized that the kid was smart – smart enough to have already figured out about Lupin.
Closest to the Manor was a garden – reaching the length of the building and over eight quilometres of width. It was elegant, well adorned, strictly kept and addicting to visit. It harbored a variety of plants – some of which had magical properties, others simply easy on the eyes.
Cedric bit his lip, looking conflicted, but he then seemed to make a decision, and opened his mouth to say...

“Ah, that’s- no. Nothing going on” he tried to get to that Map before Ron, but the redhead was already reaching for it, a teasing smile complementing his wiggling eyebrows.
After squirming in his seat enough to get a glare from Hermione, Ron picked up one of the books to see what they would be studying, and groaned when he saw charms.
Hermione met Harry’s father in the end of her First Year, when her and Ron were in the hospital wing, waiting for Harry to wake up after their attempt to protect the Philosopher’s Stone. James strutted in, banging the doors open. Concern so evident on his face that not even Madam Pomfrey protested the loud noise.
“I wouldn’t be so smug, Ron” Hermione interrupted his musings “Ginny has been ogling him quite a bit”, he inspected his sister down the table, that was, in fact, staring the Slytherins.

“Of course, my mistake. That
He paced back and forth for a while, taking shaky breaths, trying to calm himself down. He didn’t even know why he was so worked up over Draco bloody Malfoy. It was like that damn boy just knew which buttons to press to piss Harry off, without even trying.
No... Harry didn’t mean that, he just meant to say that he looked like a prick. Yes, that's what he just thought. “He looks like a prick” Harry added, for good measure.
“Go ahead pup” Sirius encouraged her, and she tore through the packaging, and pulled out the fluid and transparent fabric. “What is this?” she asked, while inspecting the cloak closely.
He and the others crept around the wall slowly and silently, none of them knew
“Oh, I’m sorry” Draco feigned concern, putting a hand on Cedrics shoulder worriedly “Want to sit in front of a fire a sing some songs about it?”

After promising to meet Hermione and Ron in the Gryffindor Tower, he went to the locker rooms to shower and change out of his sweaty uniform. Oliver Wood was still gloating about their new point advantage when Harry finished and left. He was running his hand distractedly over his wet hair, lost thinking nonsenses about the other seeker and even indulging in some weird wondering about whether or not Malfoy ever played Quidditch when the figure of a tall man appeared in front of him.
Sybill was convulsing in bed, and Draco ran to her, grabbing her shoulders and yelling her name. He was about to put his new

“Thank you, thank you, thank you!” she tackled Harry once again, who was still recovering from he previous violence, but hugged her back anyway. “It was Dad’s” he managed to explain, and she let him go to in favor of hugging James.
He met kids that got bullied for 'looking gay', and heard plenty of nasty conversations about it. Dudley told him, once, about how a new coworker of his dad was rumored to be dating another men, and he was fired once the rest of the office figured it out. One time, when he was younger, some older kid was teasing Harry when he was walking back from school, because he had picked up some flowers to bring to his sister – she had had a tantrum that day, ever the drama queen – and Daniel had defended him, telling the other boy that Harry was not a 'fag'.
Harry made a move to get up and leave but she held his forearm.
“Sorry, again...” he backed away slowly from Cho’s bright smile, and she waved as he left. When he turned away from them, he felt a blush creeping over his cheeks.

know the answer, so, he just had to be convincing - it was fine, completely under control.
“We really are” Hermione added, pale and wide eyed.
“Well, have fun with your friends” Draco smiled, enjoying Cedric’s anguish more than he should.
Or so he thought.
Because, in front of him, Sirius cupped James’s cheek with his hand, reached down, and kissed him. In the mouth. With his own mouth. And James kissed back. And they smiled at each other when they pulled back. And continued talking, like nothing out of the ordinary happened. And Sirius was stroking James’s tight. Casually. And they kept laughing.
Harry felt self conscious without his invisibility cloak, but the Map was enough to make sure they didn’t stumble upon Peeves, who was lurking in one of the staircases, or anyone else.
“Well, I’m sure
Harry spun around, dribbling the ball from one foot to the other, managing to get around Daniel, before kicking for the goal, and scoring. He laughed as his friends just grumbled to themselves.
“Oh, look, our first class is with Remus, Harry!” Hermione huffed at the timetable and Ron tried to suppress a giggle about her subtlety. But Harry welcomed the subject change, he was actually excited to have some decent defense classes for once.
He was also barely seeing Genevine, he though, as he softly scratched a finger under her chin. She was very independent and loved to explore and do things by herself. He also suspected that she visited the Griffyndor Tower a little too much – and not for Crookshanks.
Lucius finished his tea and leaned forward, shoulders tense “I’ve never seen her like this. Even when ‘He’ was still around, she was always so contained and controlled, never losing composure like that. I would think it was a panic attack, but she was breaking things around her, and muttering nonsenses.
“And the look in her eyes Cygnus... It was just like Bellatrix, when she has those- those moments”
Draco’s parents told him about the Potions Master over the Winter Break, how he used to be a friend of the family. Draco tried to sympathize with the men, thinking about how lonely he probably was, how he lost the woman he loved. But looking at how Snape’s face contorted in disgust every time Potter opened his mouth...
“Well, he is a great professor, sir. I am very lucky to have his guidance” Draco was quickly growing tired of the conversation. It felt like they were playing a very calculated game, that Draco had no idea how to win. He kept himself polite and reserved as Dumbledore made seemingly random subject changes, some that looked like he was prying for information, others that indicated that the man had knowledge of things that should be secret, and some that were actually irrelevant and apparently meant to throw the boy off. Either way, Draco maintained his stance. After a while the headmaster started to feel a little frustrated, which the boy considered a win.
. His sneers and biting words were mostly self defense, she noticed.
he thought. But honestly? He was hungry and had seen much weirder things in his life, so he just shrugged it off and made his way to the Great Hall, where Ron and Hermione were discussing their class schedule. He was starting his second serving of bacon and eggs when he noticed that the conversations around him had subdued, and he followed his friends gaze to the Great Hall entrance behind him, where three students were making their way inside.
Draco got jealous and even a little angry when he realized that his cat had a soft spot for the Golden Boy, but he learned to bitterly accept it. After all, Genevieve was smart enough to make her own decisions, and she was a pretty good judge of character, if Draco was anything to show for it. Either way, just because Genevive liked the Gryffindor poster-boy, that didn’t mean that

Very offended, Draco took a breath to dictate them on betrayal and rude assumptions based off jealousy, when a small flock of paper birds came flying through the hallway, and surrounded him, singing screeching tunes in his ears. That only made Pansy and Blaise laugh louder.
Harry’s brows dip in confusion. “Awakening?”
Draco gives him a small, tight, embarrassed smile. “You look bloody fit on a broom.”
“An Ex-Death Eater,” Harry corrects automatically. Sighing, he drops his head back against the wall and stares at the ceiling. “I don’t want to be the savior anymore,” he whispers.
They knew.
And they let him embarrass himself.
Draco blinks. He blinks again. “Too?”
Harry tilts his head. “No.”
He forgets the door isn’t warded until it flies open to Ron’s, “Harry, what the fu-” that’s followed by him freezing in the doorway. Malfoy stops, meeting the shocked gaze frozen on the other boy’s face.
Zabini, sure. But Malfoy?
Draco’s other hand releases the curls in its grip to fumble with his own pants. “Merlin and Morgana, Potter. If you don’t help me I will AK you right now.” Harry barks out a laugh but reaches for Draco’s pants anyhow. He doesn’t even fully take them off; just roughly shoves them down his thighs and then proceeds to do the same with his own. Draco lifts a brow, somehow channeling some of his posh, pureblood attitude with a flush face and a handful of cock. “Are you taking me against a wall?”
Harry Potter never expected to return to Hogwarts.
Draco rewinds as quickly as he can in his fuzzy brain. He runs through it over and over, sensing no wrong answer. He wasn’t unkind, he didn’t lie, and he answered the question. Wha-
“You bloody well are not.” Harry turns at the sound of Malfoy’s voice from his side. He blinks at the pinched, angry features of the other. “Go sit with your Gryffindors.”
Cheeks flushed and grin so wide it could rip his face in half, Dean leans over the table excitedly. “You’ve been bloody hot for Malfoy since at least sixth year.”
“Walking up to me at dinner, going on about how I’m ‘just what you need,’ pretending to realize you’ve been secretly in love with me for years, and then hitting on my friends? Did you suffer a fucking brain injury in the past year?” He’s pissed, all fluttering hands and sharp tongue.
“Always am, always will be,” Draco breathes. He’s pushing back now, begging for more while also relishing in the feel of his cock knocking into the wall in front of him.
After a long, tense silence, the table erupts into chaos. Half of the table seems to be rejoicing in having some suspicions confirmed, while the other half are arguing the insanity of the idea.
Freezing, Draco gapes at Ron’s satisfied smirk. Horror seeps into his veins as he realizes he’s been surrounded by Weasley’s (and Potter, who is practically the favorite Weasley son) for the last numerous functions he’s been to. “Oh Merlin, I’m a Weasley.”
Ron chokes on his juice, Hermione flushes behind her hair, Malfoy squeaks in surprise, and Harry blinks.
“What are you lot on about?”
Draco takes a deep breath. He thought he had been so careful. He thought he had kept himself from showing anything on his face. He worked so damn hard to ensure that no one realized he’s been pining after the unattainable for years.
Secretly preening, Draco plants his hands against the wall by his face. “Didn’t really take you for the slow type, Potter.”
There’s sweat pooling in the dip of his back and lube dripping down his thighs when he feels the fire build in his gut. “Close,” he gasps, head shoved down into the cushion.
“Time? Space?” Ron sat up, eyes not meeting Harry’s as he raked his hands through his bright hair. “You shut us all out, Harry. We needed you. I needed you.” His breath was wet and heavy, deep in his chest. “Fred died and I needed you.”
Harry has no shame. He whines, letting his weight fall back into the mattress completely. “Draco,” he moans, smashing his sweaty cheek into the pillow beneath him and trying to shove himself back onto his cock. “If you stop now I’ll hex your balls off.”
Harry smiles devilishly, and Draco knows he’s done for. “Bet your pale ass I am.” Draco snorts, opening his mouth to argue that his ass is just fine, before he’s cut off by being yanked away from the wall and shoved back against it face-first. His cheek presses to the wall as Harry kicks his legs as far apart as they’ll go with his pants around his knees. “I wanted to do this slow, but fuck if you’re not a walking wet dream.”
Draco swirls the wine in his glass and speaks without really stopping to think. “It reminds me of the utter git I used to be, and the idiotic half-brain I used to think you were.”
“It was almost empty you Drama Queen.”
“Uh,” Harry hears Ron’s voice as he begins filling his plate. “Harry?”
Draco hears the pop of an apparation and jerks without lifting his head.
Freezing, Draco sucks in a surprises breath.
Harry fidgets with the sleeve of his robe. “It means that I’m so bloody tired. I’m tired of having so much responsibility. I’m tired of having so many people depending on me. I’m so tired of not being able to control my own future. I’m just so fucking tired of taking care of everyone but myself.”
Malfoy’s mouth pops open in surprise. He stares at Harry, mouth forming words that aren’t coming out. Harry patiently waits.
Malfoy raises one pale blonde brow at the request. He thrusts his fingers particularly hard and grins at the way Harry arches, knuckles going white with his grip on the headboard. “Did you think of me while doing this to yourself?” He draws his fingers almost all of the way out before thrusting them back in. “Did you imagine that your fingers were mine? Getting you nice and loose so I could fill you with my cock?”
And then Draco can’t keep up with their banter. He can’t think, can’t focus past the sweet, pleasure-pain of Harry’s cock driving into him over and over again. His own is trapped against the back of the couch, rubbing with a burning ache against the cushion with every powerful thrust. His toes are dancing across the floor, slipping as Harry’s body drives into his so hard and fast the couch slips across the carpet. Draco is well aware he’s making noises and saying things, but if anyone asked him what he wouldn’t be able to recall.
“Because it reminds me of the man I’ve changed into and the man that I’ve come to love.”
Pansy smiles, leaning back into Ginny’s lap and crossing her arms. If Draco were any ounce of straight he’d be unable to tear his eyes off her chest. “I think you’re doing just fine, muffin.”
“Yes,” Harry breathes in relief.
“Having a powerful wizard, the damn Savior, begging for my cock?” Draco slams into him again, pausing to listen to the desperate whine that falls from Harry’s lips. “You bet your fine ass it does.”
He can also confidently say that he didn’t expect for the first thing he’s felt in months to be triggered by finding the shiny, blonde head of Draco Malfoy bent over a textbook at the end of the table he’s headed for. He can’t get the image of Malfoy chained at his trial, misery and self-hatred written all over his face. He had nearly collapsed in on himself when Harry took the stand, testifying for him and Narcissa. Between him and a number of professors, they had managed to gotten the council to see that Malfoy had been a child. They had managed to make the council see that, despite being raised by Lucius Malfoy and living under the same roof as Voldemort, there was good inside of Malfoy. He was just too bloody terrified to let it out. When it came down to it, everything within him warred between what he needed to do to protect his mother and what every piece of him was screaming to do instead.
Draco scoffs. “Why?”
Ron snorts into his glass. “Don’t we all know it.”
Harry raises a brow, hands up and wand staying safely tucked in his holster. “What?”
“Other thing?” Harry questions. He racks his brain to try to catch onto whatever Dean is saying and comes up empty. “You lost me.”
Malfoy pulls his shoulders, lifting him off the bed just enough so that he has to brace his weight on his palms pressed flat against the smooth wood of the headboard. “That’s not my name.”
Dean snorts into his drink. “At least we’re all finally acknowledging it.”
Draco laughs. “With a cock that size I imagine everyone is.”
Harry whines, arching up into Malfoy’s touch as his fingers burn against his skin. Hands scrambling for purchase, they fist into the comforter below them that’s somehow still tucked under the mattress after all of Harry’s squirming. He pushes his head back into the mattress when Malfoy’s hand ghosts over his leaking cock, a look of wonder on his face. Those gray eyes flash back up at Harry. “What do you want, Potter?”
Harry snorts, and it’s not nearly as unattractive as it should be. “So what should I call you?”
Hermione pats the back of Ron’s hand with a fond smile directed at Harry. “Well, he has always been a little obsessed.”
Harry laughs, loud and long, and Draco thinks maybe that’s not such a bad thing.
Then they had all gotten the letter from Hogwarts. McGonagall had orchestrated the rebuilding of the castle. Witches and Wizards all over England had lend a hand, working day and night until the castle had finally been deemed safe for students once again. McGonagall then had the idea to invite all of the seventh year students back for an eighth year. All other years had been relocated to the other wizarding schools across the country and were right on track to return. Ginny had even finished her education and was moving on to professional Quidditch.
“First of all,” Harry corrects, “no one said anything about love.” Enjoying the way Malfoy flushes at his slip-up, he walks him backward until he hits the wall by the door. “Second of all, I pretended nothing.”
Harry gasps, the fingers of his left hand slipping and finding their way to Malfoy’s shoulder. “No,” Harry answers honestly. “But fuck if I’ll never be able to do it again thinking about anything else.”
“Goddamnit, Malfoy! I laughed at the idea that you returned my own bloody feelings!” Harry grabs Draco’s shoulders and shoves him against his own living room wall. “Ron didn’t tell me to make a joke out of it. He told me hoping that it would finally get me to stop fucking moping around about you! I laughed in his face because there was absolutely no fucking way you could ever love me, too!”
Harry can do nothing but brace his weight as Ma-Draco fucks into him again and again. He is unforgiving, slamming all of his weight against him as they slip across the sheets with the sheer force of it. The bed slaps against the wall and Harry can feel the headboard shaking under his fingers with every slam against the stone. The room sounds of nothing but wood hitting stone, skin hitting skin, the ragged, uneven pants from Draco and the filthy, nonsense words coming from Harry. He doesn’t even register the “fuck, Draco, harder, faster, fuck, oh merlin,” that falls from his lips on a steady stream. Draco lets the words urge him on as his hands slip over Harry’s sweaty skin, grabbing and holding on as hard as he can until he slips and is forced to find another spot to squeeze.
Malfoy slams his hand back onto the wall and presses forward, caging Harry against the wall with his long body. His head drops to glare at Harry’s green eyes. “You want someone to fuck you?”
Harry’s groan vibrates against Draco’s skin. “Yes,” he whispers, pressing this throat up into the other’s grip.
He shouldn’t love those things.
Ron hadn’t lifted his head when he whispered, “You’re okay?”
Harry ignores the other eighth year students as he moves through the halls with Ron and Hermione at his sides.
Laughing, Harry shakes his head at him. “I suppose I deserve that.”
Harry finds himself hesitating for only a breath. If there’s one thing that Ron and Hermione have been trying to tell him over and over again recently it’s to latch onto any healthy urge he has. Anything that makes the empty inside of him feel a little less lonely. He no longer feels the pressure of the eyes that follow him everywhere but something inside of him is screaming that Malfoy has always tugged at a mess of emotions inside of him. While he can’t promise that the things he feels toward Malfoy are particularly healthy, he can bloody well assure himself that it’s something other than the endless dark he lives in now.
“I wasn’t aware I was playing one, Malfoy.” Harry lifts a brow as he scoops a spoonful of potatoes in his mouth. He catches Malfoy watching the motion and his other brow joins the first.
“You know, I would,” Draco shoves the glass back at Harry, “except I don’t have a glass. Why don’t you be a fine chap and grab one for me? It’s only polite since you stole mine in the first place.”
Malfoy groans, as if he’s in physical pain. “You don’t understand what you’re asking, Potter.”
Harry feels himself relax at the thought. “Oh,” Harry murmurs. Leaning back on the bench, his fingers close around the edge of the table as he lets out his first real laugh in weeks. “Merlin, that explains so much.”
Malfoy’s jaw clenches as his chest presses against Harry’s with the deep breath he takes. “Let me be clear, Potter.” Shoving a knee between Harry’s legs, he brings a hand down to grasp at his jaw. His fingers are tight as he holds his head in place and his steel-gray eyes bore into Harry. “I will not be gentle. I will not love you. You want to be fucked, Potter? That’s what I’ll do. You’ll ache for days. You’ll feel my fingers pressed into your skin when you wake up in the morning. You’ll walk around this castle with my teeth marks covering your skin.” Malfoy dips so that his free hand can grab the back of Harry’s knee, lifting it so that his entire weight falls between Harry’s legs. “You’ll be begging for me to let you go and I’m not sure I’ll have the strength once I’ve tasted you.”
Harry reaches forward and heaves him up by his shoulder. Draco’s head drops back against Harry’s own shoulder as lips wrap around his ear and teeth tug. He damn near screams when Harry’s fingers close around his cock just as he hits his prostate for the hundredth time. “Cum for me, Draco. Right now, spill all over my fingers.”
Harry tunes them out as they continue to bicker over it. He’s too busy reliving every encounter with Malfoy he’s ever had and with the new information swirling around in his head. He’s known for quite some time he fancies blokes as well, but Malfoy had never pinged on that radar.
“Because he got to tell me ‘I told you so.’”
“Absolutely,” Ron intercepts as he pops up at Harry’s side, an annoying habit he has. He hands another full one to Harry, who sticks his tongue out at Draco like he’s not a grown ass adult. Ron turns to watch his sister laugh as Pansy dips her back, nearly dropping her. “Who would have thought that you would be keeping Draco Malfoy cozy while my sister marries Parkinson?”
“Bullshit,” Malfoy spits. He pulls his fingers free again, muttering the lubrication spell under his breath as his free hand reaches out to touch his wand. He shoves three fingers in this time, unforgiving as he watches Harry buck against the pleasure-pain of the stretch. “You’re taking my fingers like you’ve been fucked into every mattress in London.”
Draco is equal parts stunned and thrilled at the answer he receives. He lets his fingers tighten around the edges of his throat with the barest pressure on his trachea. The blood flow it slowed by this fingers and thumb as the hell of his palm places just enough pressure to give the illusion of not being able to breathe while still providing enough oxygen. He watches as Harry’s eyes glaze over and his eyes flutter between open and closed. Harry’s nails create dips in Draco’s shoulders where he’s holding on for dear life as his head swims pleasantly. He can’t focus on anything completely and just lets his body feel everything Draco is doing, from the tight grip around his wrists, the thrill of his fingers around his throat, and the push and drag of his cock as his pace turns completely unhinged and he hits his prostate over and over and over.
“Thank Merlin,” Harry breathes. His fingers disappear and Draco has to remind himself that what’s to come is better to keep himself from chasing them.
“Why?”
Ron coughs. “Not sitting with us?”
“You most definitely should,” Draco reassures. “You should just also call me Malfoy.”
Malfoy’s eyes flicker with something. He relaxes, his shoulders drooping, but face staying guarded. “I don’t do…soft, Potter.”
McGonagall leads the group of eighth years through the portal hole of their new dorms. When they’ve all gathered inside, Malfoy fidgeting as far from Harry as he can get, she waves her hand at the new common room. “Since not all of you have returned, you will all be sharing this one living space. The girls’ rooms are down the left hall, boys’ to the right. Each door has your new dorm mates on them. There are two to a room. This is the common living area, and each room has their own showers.” She narrows her eyes at the excited chatter that breaks out at not having to share showers this year. “You’re all adults, so I trust that I don’t need to assign an eighth year Perfect to keep you lot under control.” Harry almost laughs at how her gaze flickers over to the three of them. “Your schedules will be given out at breakfast tomorrow morning. You’ll have these next few days to settle in and readjust to being inside the castle. Your classes will officially start on Monday. I will serve as your Head of House.” She pauses, glancing around at all of the faces that have put their lives on hold to return to her. Her shoulders slump, her eyes tired and heavy. “We’ve all been through quite a bit, yes? I hope you know how grateful I and the other Professors are to have you here one last time. I’m hoping that we can all find a way to heal and move on together.”
Draco slips one hand inside of his sleeve to touch his wand and apparates without another word.
They fucking know.
Draco barks a laugh. “You came here to tell me you’ve all laughed about it behind my back?” He stands roughly, shoving away from the couch and stomping toward his kitchen.
Draco sucks in a sharp breath, fingers pressing firmly into Harry’s hips. “Better than pining since sixth year.”
Somehow Draco finds himself panting against his own wall, pressed into it by the bloody Savior of the Wizarding World, head dropped back with lips and teeth taking him apart across his neck. He’s rutting shamelessly against Harry’s thigh, fingers tangled in his dark curls and “fuck, Harry, oh Merlin,” leaking from his lips like gospel.
“I don’t think he really chose, Ronald.” Hermione gives Ron an exasperated look, just as over this conversation as Harry is.
Malfoy’s gray eyes snap back up and narrow. “You’re always playing a game with me.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbles, muffled by the pillow he turns his head into to bite. “So good, Malfoy. So good.”
“I mean,” Ron continues and Harry nearly groans. “Malfoy? Of all the blokes in this castle, you choose Draco sodding Malfoy?”
Harry laughs. He forces his limbs to move, tangling his legs with Draco’s and bringing his arms up to roll them onto their sides. “You just fucked my brains out, Draco. I think you can call me Harry.”
“Maybe I just need someone to let me let go?” Harry sighs, deep and dramatic. “Guess I’ll just have to go find someone else.” He moves to push past Malfoy’s arm.
Draco should have stopped drinking four glasses of red wine ago.
Malfoy pushes at him, swinging so that he’s the one trapping Harry against the wall and oh, that’s something. “You’re trying to tell me that you’ve been attracted to me for all of these years and didn’t bloody well notice?”
Draco laughs, ignoring how bitter and pained it sounds as he rips his hand from Harry’s grasp. “I would hate to be a Drama Queen.”
Harry might have blacked out.
“No,” Harry had answered honestly, letting everything he had been wallowing in coat his voice. “I think I will be, though. I just need…”
Harry’s weight presses into Draco’s back as he mumbles the lubrication spell again, using one hand to fuck two fingers into Draco and the other to slick up his own leaking cock. “Fair point, Malfoy. I forget sometimes that you’re still a git.”
“Okay,” Hermione interjects, “I think it’s time for a sobriety charm, Draco.” She reaches for her wand up her dress sleeve.
“But…” Ron trails off, lost for words and confusion written all over his face when Harry glances up as he sips his pumpkin juice. He waves his hand helplessly at the empty space next to him.
By the time he can focus again Draco has already slid out of him, cast a cleaning charm over them both, and is smoothing Harry’s hair back from his brow. Draco is still nestled between his legs, letting his weight rest on him in a pleasant way. His gray eyes are soft and searching. “Alright, Potter?”
He’s still unprepared for the thick length of Harry’s cock pressing into him. He’s moaning, whining, fumbling for purchase on the wall in front of him. Harry’s pulls him against his chest and turns, taking two unsteady steps until he can shove him over the back of his couch. Draco hisses and his fingers clench around a cushion as Harry drives into him in one quick, brutal thrust. “Fuck, you’re so tight.”
Harry gives him a curious look. “Everyone knows Malfoy and I have been at each other’s throats since we were eleven, Dean. It hasn’t exactly been a secret.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispers. “I didn’t mean…”
His life was supposed to be laid out for him. They had won the war, defeated Voldemort, lost so many loved ones, and learned to adjust to this new life they have all been given. He was supposed to never return to the castle, begin his Auror training, marry Ginny, have 3.5 kids, and settle into a home for a comfortable life together.
Draco falls onto his couch, head in his hands and breathing too shallow. He’s ruined everything. His idiotic friends just couldn’t let Hermione cast a so sobriety charm?
“I’m not,” Harry assures, punctuating his claim by shoving a lubed finger completely into Draco’s hole with no warning. Draco whines, nails scratching at the paint. “You’re special, though. It’s supposed to be different.”
Malfoy’s arms come up to rest on either side of Harrys’ head. He uses his extra inch of height to force Harry’s eyes back to his own. “What does that mean?”
“Have been pining after you since before I left Ginny.”
“Merlin, you’re perfect.” Harry grins into his pillow before moving so his cheek is against it and he can just see Malfoy out of the corner of his eye. Harry feels one of Malfoy’s hands brush up his thigh and he can barely see his other stroking himself. Hearing the wet sound of the lube, Harry groans again and shoves backward into Malfoy’s grip. “Eager for it,” Malfoy laughs.
Maybe it’s a good thing that Draco Malfoy can’t keep a secret from his friends.
“Myself,” Harry croaks. His voice cracks and he has to take a second to heave in a breath, hips stuck between trying to shove down on Malfoy’s fingers and push up in a desperate attempt to find his mouth again. “I’ve done it to myself.” Malfoy freezes and Harry whines, loud and high. “Please, Malfoy.”
“No, that’s no-” Draco cuts himself off, throwing his gaze around until he lands on Pansy. “Help me out here, Pans.”
Harry laughs, surprised and delighted. He lift up on his toes, bringing himself to Draco’s height to press his lips firmly against the taller man’s. Draco opens for him immediately, something inside just chest slipping into place and clicking please fly together. His fingers turn tight on Harry’s waist when Harry shuffled forward and slides a leg between Draco’s thighs.
Harry whines and brings his hands up in front of him. His toes dig into the mattress as his palms push against the headboard, rocking his body back into Malfoy who hisses at the pull of his cock moving less than in inch inside of Harry. “Move, please.”
Draco laughs, the sound distorted by how out of breath he is. “What about that?” He kicks his head toward Ron still frozen in the doorway. Despite his words he begins moving again, long and slow thrusts that are less frantic but just as hard and deep as the ones before. Harry simply groans and throws out his hand. Draco feels his magic tingle over his skin as the door slams in Ron’s face and several strong silencing and locking spells fall into place over the room. Draco groans, “Did you just cast multiple wandless and wordless spells while I’m balls deep inside of you?”
In the end, Kreacher’s constant tough love is what finally shoved him out of the house. Hermione’s tea cup shattering on the floor greeted him when he stumbled into the Burrow from the floo, covered in soot and reeking of sadness. He barely hit the floor when Molly’s arms were already catching him, murmuring soothing yet panicked, worried words into his unruly curls. Ron had come crashing down from the stairs, half-dressed and flushed red from anger. He had ripped Harry from Molly’s arms, shoved him upstairs, warded his bedroom door, and shoved him down onto his bed.
Love.
Harry absolutely loves it.
Harry’s elbow slips off the table and he barely catches himself from knocking his chin on the table.
Draco’s shoulders lift as he tenses. “What game are you playing, Potter?”
“No, no,” Harry waves his hand toward Dean in a motion to elaborate. “I’m not mad, just confused.”
Malfoy hesitates. “You’re the Savior. I’m a Death Eater.”
‘We’ve waited too damn long for this.’
They know.
“Ignore them,” Harry catches his attention again. “Why do you love when I call you Malfoy?”
Love. Love. Love love love love love.
There are so many things Draco expected out of his life. He’s happy to have been wrong about all of them.
Malfoy’s eyes are wild. His breathing is labored, his hands are tight against Harry’s skin. Something passes over his face before he relaxes back in realization that Harry actually does want this.
“You don’t want this,” Malfoy pushes. “You don’t want this.”
Grinning, Harry pushes forward to breathe into Malfoy’s ear, “Try me.” He punctuates the demand by locking his teeth around Malfoy’s lobe and tugging before sagging back against the wall.
“Draco.” Wincing at Harry’s voice, Draco keeps his head down. “Draco, will you look at me?”
Draco huffs, blowing his fringe out of his eyes. “Where do you keep coming from? Bloody Gryffindors,” he mutters under his breath.
“Ooo, Potter.” Harry grins as he shoves the empty glass back into Draco’s hand. “What have I done this time?” Draco holds up his empty flute with a raised brow in answer. Harry rolls his eyes. “It’s an open bar, Draco. Get another one.”
Malfoy’s hands find his hips as he pulls off of Harry but stays fully sheathed inside of him. He’s holding him still, gripping so tightly and Harry knows he’ll have bruises in the shape of his fingers. The simple thought of it has Harry leaking onto the comforter below him. “Say my name.”
McGonagall’s letter had laid out her entire plan for the eighth years that chose to return. They would receive their seventh year curriculum all over again with minor adjustments now that they were all of age. They would live together in what would be known as the eighth year dorms, still representing their houses with their wardrobes but sharing a common living space. They would be free to apparate to and from Hogsmeade, which they would have unlimited access to as long as they keep up on their classes. They will have their own lunch table, follow the same schedule, and take their NEWTs at the end of the year.
Draco turns to Hermione. “I’ll take that sobriety charm now.”
Harry fights to get one hand between them and give attention to his neglected cock but is stopped in his tracks by Draco’s iron grip. He snatches Harry’s wrists in his hands and presses them into the mattress above his mess of sweaty curls. “I want you to come like this.”
Draco stumbles as he lands in his living room, unsteady on his feet as he recovers from the sobriety charm.
“Malfoy,” Harry immediately complies. “Malfoy, please. Move, please.”
Draco Malfoy has a secret buried inside of him that he fully intends to take to his own grave.
Hermione and Ron have found their happy place together. Ron had gone straight into Auror training, doing his best to hide the disappointment at the realization that Harry wasn’t going with him. Hermione had taken the year to work on rebuilding her life with her family. The process of undoing the Obliviate she had cast on them was a long, exhausting thing. Her parents had been devastated when they learned the truth and she has been doing her best ever since to repair what she had broken between them.
“It’s disgusting, honestly,” Draco mumbles. Trust Pansy to snag her half of the Golden Couple while Draco flounders in the corner.
He had made his apologizes. His owls had started coming through a few weeks after his trial. He had been seen meeting with others, giving apologizes that weren’t always accepted. He made no excuses, asked for no pity. He focused on making amends; on becoming a better person than the one he had been in the past. The Malfoy name had been trashed, yet he’s building it back up simply by working to be a better person than his father was as he rots away in Azkaban. There are some that will never accept him as an ex-Death Eater. Somehow, he deals with that.
A year later and they’re still working on that. Harry and Ginny had finally given up trying to piece themselves back together. There isn’t enough left of Harry to be what Ginny needed, and he refuses to pretend there is. Ginny needs something different to move on, to be happy. He will never keep her from that.
Harry laughs a desperate, breathy sound and flattens his curls against the bed as his head falls back. “Pretty sure that’s your job right now, Malfoy.”
Why the fuck didn’t he adjust the wards?
Moaning, Harry bares his throat in silent invitation. Rather than descend on it with lips, tongue, and teeth like Harry had intended, Draco switches both of Harry’s wrists into one of his hands and brings the other down to curl around the lean, tan throat exposed to him. “Do you trust me?”
“I don’t know,” Harry had admitted. “I just know I need something else now.”
Merlin, he’s an idiot. Why would he assume that it was reciprocated just because he had been so oblivious for the last few years?
Merlin, how could he be so stupid?
Harry turns toward his trunk resting at the foot of one of the beds and gives a forced chuckle. “I won’t throw myself at you, Malfoy. Get over yourself.”
Sipping his champagne, he watches Ginerva swirl Pansy across the dance floor, both just as stunning as the other in their wedding gowns. Of course the Weasley chose a simple, elegant gown that fluttered at her feet with every turn. Anyone who is shocked that Pansy’s fits her like a glove and has a slit to the top of her thigh shouldn’t be at the wedding at all.
“Oh,” Dean flushes. “I thought we were acknowledging the other thing.”
Laughing, Harry moves between them and pushes the door open to find two large, comfortable beds and two desks in the room. The beds are decked out in deep purples and grays, as nothing in their dorms are coordinated with their houses. Harry turns on his heel, throwing a smirk at the boys hovering in the door. “Scared, Malfoy?”
Harry is gasping, chest heaving and hands fisted in Malfoy’s robes. “Then don’t.”
Malfoy shudders at the image he’s created, filing it away for later use. “Good,” he mumbles. He pulls his fingers from the other boy’s tight heat, marveling at the way Harry slides down the bed in an effort to chase them. “Turn over.”
Dean rips his mouth from under Seamus’s hand, nearly bouncing in his seat with his excitement. “Please tell me that I get to be your awakening.”
“And now?”
“Fuck,” Harry mumbles. “Do you need more?”
Harry laughs, “Must be my stunning wit.”
Harry huffs a laugh against his throat when Draco roughly shoves a hand between them. Draco wastes no time in undoing Harry’s belt, the clink of the metal somehow just as hot as the rasping breathes of the other man. He abandons his work on the zipper and shoves his hand into Harry’s pants, cool fingers wrapping around his prize. Harry groans, hips bucking. “You’ll be the death of me, Draco .”
Malfoy squawks, indignant. Zabini laughs next to him. “Yeah, you have fun with that, Draco.”
“Merlin,” Harry sighs. “You’re so stubborn.”
There’s a smirk on Malfoy’s face as he takes Harry in his mouth once more, just the tip. He hollows his cheeks, tasting the precome that’s dripping heavy on his tongue. Pulling his finger out, he shoves two back in as he drives down and lets Harry’s cock touch the back of his throat.
Harry leans forward, elbows on the table. He knows Malfoy is still there because he brushes against him in the motion. “I couldn’t give a single bloody fuck, Finnigan.”
“Yeah.”
“Yes,” Harry moans and flips himself, landing in a tangle of loose limbs and curses that Malfoy has to pull straight. Malfoy shoves his knees into the backs of Harry’s, positioning his legs wide as the sweaty skin slides against the blanket beneath them. He pushes at his shoulders until his goes down flat on his chest, arms thrown out on either side to grip the edges of the mattress.
Ron had finally looked at him then. He had taken in his dirty clothes, his knotted hair, and the deep bruises under his eyes. He had stared long and hard, so much written on his face that Harry didn’t even know where to begin deciphering it. “Then we’ll have to figure it out.”
Of course, it wouldn’t be a letter from McGonagall without the short yet pointed reminder at the bottom that told them they were adults and would be treated as such, but that they were to serve as role models for the younger years.
Harry elbows him, something passing between the two that Draco doesn’t care to decipher. “Don’t be a git, Ron.” Harry lets his gaze wander back to his ex-girlfriend. “They’re kind of perfect, aren’t they?”
Draco bends, letting his lips brush over Harry’s ears. “Cum around my cock, Potter. I want to feel you cum completely untouched, that abused little hole of yours fluttering around my cock.”
Malfoy’s eyes narrow. “You want someone to take care of you.”
Harry tilts his head, intrigued. “And why should I still call you Draco?”
“I don’t think this is something we should discuss here, Harry,” Seamus warns with a hand clamped over Dean’s mouth. He motions with his free hand toward the entire table that isn’t even pretending not to listen.
Seamus kicks Dean under the table. “Nothing, Harry.”
Draco glares at Ron. “No one is keeping me cozy, Weasel.”
Draco nearly chokes on his drink when he’s bumped from the side by a flustered, messy Savior. He watches with an irritated scowl as Harry snatches the champagne from Draco’s fingers and gulps down what’s left of it. “Why am I friends with you?”
Harry’s fingers are clawing at the mess of blanket and sheets bundled beneath them. He’s gasping again, mouth hanging open and face half-smashed into the pillow. Draco can’t take it any longer. He pulls out, ignoring Harry’s angry protests, and shoves the other over. Harry’s leg knocks into the desk too close to the bed and an angry pulse of magic has it flying across the room, slamming into the opposite wall. Draco takes a second to marvel at the sheer power of the other wizard before dropping on top of him. His legs are bent and open and Draco slots between his legs, sliding home to quickly it’s as if Harry is built for him. Draco says as much as he picks up his frantic pace from before and Harry just laughs, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders and relishing in the strong hands that hold him in place on the bed by his shoulders and the teeth that clamp around the skin of his throat.
Ron stops her before she can get her fingers around it. “I think bloody well not, ‘Mione. We’ve waited too damn long for this.” Blaise hums his agreement and Draco’s brows furrow, confused.
Harry opens his mouth to snap at him but his unspoken words turn into a long, loud moan as Malfoy shoves himself inside of him, pushing until his balls rest against the other’s thighs. Harry is panting at the stretching burn that takes over, but fuck if he doesn’t feel so completely full. Malfoy’s hands brush up his back, pushing against his shoulders hard enough to force his muscles to relax. “Shhh,” Malfoy murmurs as he covers Harry’s back. His nose brushes along his neck as his fingers continue to push the strain from every one of Harry’s muscles that he can reach. “Merlin, you’re still so tight. Made for my cock.”
Draco makes an affronted squeak and narrows his eyes. Harry, the smart man he is, takes it for the warning he intends it to be and scampers off to refill the drink he so rudely drained.
“I love when you call me Malfoy,” Draco mutters into his drink. He fails to notice the drop of wine at the corner of his mouth.
Draco learned that there had once been a team of thirty house elves who serviced the chateau. Its use had dwindled in the late 1930s and early 1940s due to the family’s associations with Grindlewald. The last Malfoy to step on the chateau’s grounds had been his grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy in the late 1970s, who had tried to make the chateau look abandoned in the face of Ministry raids during the first rise of Voldemort. He had never intended the chateau to remain empty for so long, and he hadn’t really had to do much to make it look the way it had when Draco had arrived; the perpetual confusion of the Malfoy family allegiances had weakened the family magic and the chateau had decayed largely of its own accord.
He didn’t remember why he ended up on the living room floor. When Harry had returned that day after speaking to Lyra about Sirius, the whole house was upside down. Aspen had raided cupboard for snacks and ripped through cushions; he’d dumped the small collection of toys he had into his water bowl and flung them all over the floor. He’d even hidden under Harry’s bed and screamed for an hour before Ron managed to coax him out with sugar snaps, only for the fox to wee on the floor and saunter off. Now Aspen would only sleep if Harry was there, although that didn’t require being on the floor.
‘I know sweetheart, but I promise you you’ll have a great time. You can owl me, or your dad whenever you want.’ He let Teddy down again and he looked up with watery eyes that made Draco’s chest ache terribly. Teddy walked back over to Harry and Draco reluctantly followed. It appeared that Harry wasn’t going to acknowledge their issues today and Draco was glad that they could pretend to be mature adults at the very least for Teddy’s sake.
‘Really? Enlighten me.’ He could tell Harry didn’t give a fig about why he was currently ruining the wine, because his face was pressed into Draco’s neck, making it particularly hard to concentrate.
‘What the hell are you on about?’ Harry demanded.
‘Harry isn’t Head Auror anymore.’ She cut in. If Draco’s head hadn’t been spinning before, it certainly was now.
‘I see.’ Draco sighed. ‘And where exactly are you planning on taking me?’ He asked, although he wasn’t going to agree to go anyway.
His chest tightened at he gazed down at the pain on their faces. Things had gone on far too long and he should have done something about it sooner. All this running around with spells and translations that thus far had proved fruitless when all he’d needed to do was chase after Potter; make sure he didn’t leave.
Once, a long time ago, Harry had remembered seeing a medical magazine at a doctor’s appointment his Aunt Petunia had taken him to when he’d caught chicken pox. In one of the articles he vaguely remembered that when children cried in the night, parents weren’t supposed to give them too much attention because it taught them their crying would work and they wouldn't develop a good sleeping routine. Although the fox was clearly not a human child, Harry thought maybe the same principle applied and screwed his eyes shut tighter.
‘Who are you?’ He asked her. She gave him one last, tired smile.
‘Granger!’ Draco said as he opened the door. As she stepped inside he cast a finite on himself and went back to his breakfast. Hermione dropped a kiss on the top of Teddy’s head as she went to make a cup of tea. Somehow, she’d ended up spending so much time in the flat that it was like a second home to her.
‘Why are you crying?’ Teddy asked him worriedly when he pulled away.
She turned the top page over to reveal a page full of snippets of transcripts with long sections redacted. “They have nothing on you, you know.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, Lord of Malfoy Manor?” Ponytail spoke with a deep and rasping voice and a faint West Country accent. The title made Draco cringe, but he kept his face impassive.
He was blown away by how much Harry’s eyes glittered in the morning brightness. The beams of sunlight cast an extra shadow across his jawline. His skin was still as perfect as ever and Draco ached with how much he missed him, even though he was right in front of him.
‘Potter! POTTER!’ He yelled, banging of Harry’s office door. Harry’s secretary wasn’t at her desk and Draco couldn’t afford to waste any more time. The door was yanked open and a furious looking Harry stared back at him. Draco knew he must’ve interrupted something important because Harry’s jaw was doing that tell-tale twitching.
‘No. I won’t do it.’
‘I’m really sorry, I wanted to be here for this, but something’s come up. I’ll meet you back at the orphanage later?’ He appeared too angry to look even remotely apologetic and Draco wondered what on earth had manged to change his mood so quickly.
‘A puppy.’ Teddy said finally, ‘but not a crup, just a regular puppy. I think they’re cute and I’ve never had a pet before. Well, except Eltanin, but he’s not really that sort of pet. I talk to him though…sometimes.’ Draco wasn’t sure what response he’d expected, but it wasn’t that. He shrugged.
“O-ok.” They were silent as he tended to the scratches on his arm. He tried to think about everything that had happened in the last twenty-four hours, but he found himself too distracted by his proximity to Malfoy. He kept his eyes firmly on the skin-deep wounds for fear of losing himself in the moment.
When Potter had been asleep for a while and he deemed it reasonably safe, Draco crept across the room towards the sofa. The fox made it much easier to be quiet, something he would have to use to his advantage when things were back to normal.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said quietly. He hoped Harry heard him, but his voice was muffled against his arm. Harry pulled it free so he could wrap it around Draco, and he felt warmer than he had the whole time he’d been in here.
It wasn’t unusual for him to find himself unable to look away from her. He knew full well he’d spent the past few months thinking of little else besides Aspen and Lyra. Her hair was curling even more than usual as it dried, and Harry desperately wanted to run his hands through it, but each time he caught her eye something inside him lurched like he was about to fall off a precipice.
“Oh I love foxes! I have such interesting conversations with them. Please, come and say hello. The plants would love to see you.” As was often the case when he spoke with Luna, Harry was utterly lost for words. He wanted to ask her how she knew the plants would love to see him, or if she had actual conversations with foxes like he did with snakes, or if she just talked to them as he had been just now. He had just started to ask her when she hung up on him mid-sentence. Whilst Luna adored muggle phones, she hadn’t really got the hang of them yet.
Some thought him a runaway, unable to take the pressure of his celebrity. Some were convinced he had been murdered and tried to stir up mass hysteria every week. The ones that gave Draco the most amusement were the ones concocting conspiracy theories about what had happened. The most amusing so far came from
‘Fuck it.’ Harry said and brought their lips together.
This was what he needed Malfoy for. Although he knew Remus and Sirius better than she – or he hoped he did – he knew full well his letters were almost as ineloquent as a toddler trying to say dada for the first time. With matters as intricate and delicate as this, a practised hand was more appropriate. Who better to compose a succinct and apt letter for the circumstances than Malfoy, who was literally trained in social etiquette despite the fact she ignored it ninety-nine percent of the time?
‘More than anything in the whole world!’ She said before burying her face in his neck. If Draco were a softer person, he may well have found tears welling up in his eyes, but he wasn’t like that, not at all.
‘No,’ he said. ‘I don’t dwell on the past Harry, and you shouldn’t either. If things had worked out, we wouldn’t have been true to ourselves. I’m done apologising for who I am, I have been for a long time.’ Harry sighed heavily.
He kissed Draco with as much love as he could physically muster through a kiss. Teasing Draco’s bottom lip gently and sinking a hand into Draco’s ridiculously soft hair. Harry could never quite get over how much Draco melted into their kisses. Harry could actually feel the way Draco gave himself over to them as though he was literally giving Harry his heart with every kiss. Sometimes, Harry got so frustrated that he would never be able to express the amount of love he felt towards Draco, that his magic attacked their surroundings. He was managing to keep it under control just barely, because it normally sent Draco into an absolute frenzy when he was witness to Harry’s accidental magic, and Harry knew he wasn’t in the right frame of mind for that right now.
He jumped when Teddy sidled up to him whilst he was doing the dishes. Harry had always done them the muggle way, even though he didn’t need to, and Draco had picked up the habit since he couldn’t spell them clean.
‘Hey little wolf.’ Draco said, his voice scratchy. He glanced over Teddy’s shoulder to see Harry standing there holding Eltanin’s cage, a conflicted look on his face. Draco supposed it was a mix between the hatred he was feeling towards Draco mixed with the empathy he felt at the fact this this was a tough day for the both of them.
The only problem he had was that his loan had been rejected by Gringotts. He would just have to apply for any potions related job, regardless of whether he was overqualified, and hope for the best. After all, he could always work his way up the chain like he had here.
‘You’d best get on the train Ted, it’ll be leaving soon.’ Draco told him. He plastered a fake smile on his face and blocked out the voices that were beginning to sound in his head. The noise of the crowd was getting louder and parents fought to shout at the kids who’d already got on the train.
Harry’s eyes flickered to a point just past Draco’s head, but when Draco turned to see what he was looking at, Harry gripped his arm to stop him.
‘Well yes, quite. That’s why everyone at the practice had had their licences revoked.’ Harry said smugly. ‘I don’t know the particulars since I’d left before they’d cracked it, but it turns out they got them on the money trail. They didn’t cover up their tracks very well and there was a clear money exchange all the way from the clinic back to the supplier. Turns out they weren’t the brains of Britain.’
“What the actual fuck?!” Harry rocked as he waited for the fiery pain to die down and Lyra shouted at the fox. When he eventually started to return to his senses, a very strange scene greeted him. Lyra was wrestling with the fox which was screaming in her arms and scratching at her arms. It was spitting and snarling like a rabid animal, as if a switched had flipped and turned its personality on its head.
‘I’d love that!’ He was already making his way outside when he remembered Draco. ‘You don’t mind, do you?’ He supposed he should mind, since Teddy had come home to see him, but he couldn’t deny them some bonding time. He hadn’t finished writing up his journal either.
The fox sat in the middle of the bed, fur gleaming in the limited light. Aspen’s ears were pricked attentively, and his head was cocked to one side as if in sympathy. There was a sudden calmness, as if it was Lyra’s presence alone that had vexed him.
When he returned to the living room barefoot and with dripping wet hair, he found that the mess in the bathroom was only the beginning. He should have known better than to leave the fox unattended after the havoc it had wreaked in the night. He found the Canons blanket clamped tightly in the jaws of the fox and in the process of being torn to shreds. Perhaps he should have tried harder to wake Ron... at least he would have come to the blanket’s defence.
‘Hermione what the hell?’ Draco hissed as soon as Teddy was out of earshot.
“No! No I don’t know why. He’s not
‘You’re welcome. I love you too. Now get some sleep, you need did.’ Harry got up from the end of the bed and made his way to the door. Draco hid around the corner as quickly as he could, feeling like he had in first year when he’d snuck out to catch Harry out of bed, only to get himself detention too. His father had been furious.
You’d never know that from the photo though. He watched as his sullen expression dissipated as Harry ran up behind him and attacked him around the waist. His miserable faraway look melted into a broad grin and he turned his head to the side to see Harry’s chin hook over his shoulder. They grinned like maniacs at each other and then the loop reset.
‘You forgot something!’ She giggled and launched herself at him. He wasn’t strong enough to told her up, so he lowered her to the floor to hug her back. Her hold was so vice-like it almost hurt which was quite impressive for a little girl. She’d come a long way since she first arrived at the orphanage and wouldn’t look at or speak to anyone.
September was shaping up to be the worst day of Draco’s life. He stood on Platform 9 ¾ for the first time since the beginning of his seventh year of school. There were kids everywhere, shouting between carriages, pushing and shoving to get their luggage on as quickly as possible and finding someone to spend their first train journey with. There were parents laughing and crying, some doing so at exactly the same time.
‘I’m just trying to be honest.’ He looked wounded and Draco couldn’t blame him.
The next time Harry went to Luna’s place the front door was locked. Luna never ever locked her front door, which meant something funny was going on. He knocked politely and when there was no reply, he made his way around the side of the house. It was absolutely bloody freezing; the shift from October to November had been fierce and even in his warmest coat Harry found himself huddling over against the arctic winds. The sky was nearly black with cloud and if he didn’t move fast, he was going to get drenched by the inevitable downpour.
‘No I don’t.’ He said stubbornly, ‘how else will you know when you’re pissing me off?’
Harry began to splutter. ‘What? But- but you- I didn’t- what?’ Draco scowled at him even though he knew it was his own fault the issue hadn’t been resolved sooner.
“What exactly is it that you think I can help you with, Harry? I will, as long as it’s in my power, you know that.” Sirius had nearly finished his tea by the time that Harry had finished talking. It was still too hot for Harry though, so his sat full on the table in front of him, slowly warming his hands.
‘And you’re spending time with an attractive “social worker” because? Is this because of Teddy? What the hell have you done Harry?!’ This was like pulling teeth.
“It did something at least. Are you ready?” She stepped in front of him and suddenly he felt terrified. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Granger, except… well, he didn’t trust her at all. The wild notion entered his head that this whole thing could have been an elaborate hoax to lure him into the Ministry, breaking his house arrest, just so she could see him locked up. It would be the ultimate revenge. Granger wouldn’t be that vindictive… would she?
He was lucky Teddy was still young and he could pretend that was why he watched them.
His mind drifted as he played Pansy’s favourite Chopin piece. He wondered if Potter liked piano music, if he’d even heard of Chopin, if one day Draco might play for him instead.
Harry was still a little chilled, so he hadn’t removed his jacket. He took the packet of sugar snaps out and distracted Aspen with them while Sirius tried to gently introduce himself. Aspen was thrashing about, screaming and scratching. It was clear that this had been a terrible idea, but Harry had come this far, and it seemed stupid not to go through with it now. Although Aspen was also in distress and Harry cared about this little fox quite a lot.
It was funny that Malfoy should remind him so much of Luna. That in turn reminded him that he hadn’t spoken to Luna in a long time. Maybe if he’d kept in better contact, he’d know full well what was going on with Malfoy. The two of them were thick as thieves, or so Harry had been told. He’d dare say they even looked more similar than Ron and Percy ever had. It would probably look obvious if he were to take sudden interest in Luna now that he was only forming yet another weird obsession with Malfoy, but he didn’t like how unsettled seeing her had made him.
‘Why did you have such a hard time telling me about your anxiety and your magic trouble? What did I do to make you think you couldn’t trust me?’ Draco was surprised he hadn’t asked that question sooner. He never did have the balls to take Harry to his mind healer appointments, although with the help of Smith he had begun to understand where his issues had become so deeply rooted.
“He’s definitely not an animagus!” Luna giggled. Both the fox and Harry were much less amused, and the fox leaped into Harry’s arms so fast he barely had time to catch him. Harry’s heart was almost fit to burst. He had never really had a pet before, except when Sirius was in his dog form, and he couldn’t believe how much he had missed.
‘What the hell is your problem? Every time I try and find out what’s going on with you, you start attacking me like I’m some sort of social pariah!’ Harry yelled at him. Oh shit. Draco hadn’t meant to set him off, he always ran his mouth and then couldn’t handle the consequences.
‘Hey, hey,’ he shushed the crying boy, ‘it’s ok. I’m here, I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always be here when you need me, ok?’ He looked over Teddy’s head at Harry who was standing with his hands in his pockets, smiling encouragingly.
‘Of course not.’ He lied. ‘As if I would ever come back here voluntarily.’ He sauntered off to get a drink, it was going to be a long evening. He found Pansy picking up an overly full glass of wine and he prayed this wouldn’t end with her making a fool of herself as she usually did when she drank too much.
‘Of course,’ he said his goodbyes to Hugo even though he knew he couldn’t understand him and headed over to the floo. He hoped Harry wouldn’t be too angry with him for wrecking the bathroom. He wondered what he’d done with Pansy.
Suddenly she was alert. She stopped leaning against the table, the quick movement causing the splayed pages of the book to rustle and reorganise themselves around the bookmark. “Me?” She asked him with wide eyes, her hands twitching at her sides, “What on earth for?”
‘But then?’ Draco was frustrated. They were falling back into the same old patterns. Keeping things to themselves when they should’ve been sharing. He’d picked up on things in Teddy’s letters, things he’d brushed off but were red flags to him nonetheless. Had Harry notice the same? Was their little boy miserable?
‘Good point. Why do you want me to teach them? More to the point,
She gave him a long look as if it wasn’t a big deal. “That way you can’t possibly accidently bump into yourself and no one can question if you’re somewhere you shouldn’t be.” She shrugged.
He really didn’t feel like going to all that effort today.
Draco looked down at the chipped surface of the interview table that sat between them. There were no audio charms set up as there had been the last time Draco had been in one of these rooms, but he wasn’t any less nervous. He wiped his palms against his trousers and then cringed at his own behaviour. He was practically feral already.
‘What brings you here this morning? It isn’t normal for you,’ Susan asked him. He looked away from the kids to observe her more closely. She had a kind face, the crinkles around her eyes looking like they came from decades of too much laughing. She had thin hair, almost totally grey, which would have made her look old if it weren’t for the spark in her eyes. Draco liked her, he had been instrumental in her hiring if Harry should be believed, he’d only picked up that she had an air about her and suggested her as a favourite.
‘Did she like it?’ Teddy asked him when he eventually found him upstairs. Draco nodded but couldn’t reply properly since the stairs had hit him hard. He was so over feeling like he couldn’t do anything for himself anymore. He wasn’t even 30 yet and he already heaved his way up the stairs like he was 75.
‘Oh! Really? Well, I suppose that’s alright then.’ Molly looked a lot older than she had the last time he’d seen her. She was nearly completely grey now, and the bags under her eyes betrayed how tired she really was. He could relate – watching the children at the orphanage for one afternoon drained the life out of him and he knew full well she saw a lot of her grandchildren.
Harry was dumbfounded. He had no idea how to respond. Lyra slipped passed him and was halfway down the corridor before Harry figured out what to say. He couldn’t believe how calmly she was taking it. He had effectively just told her he wasn’t convinced she was actually a real person and she seemed fine with it – was it even more evidence that it was true? Or did she know something else too?
‘Oh no Draco dear, I have this all under control. Thank you for asking though, it’s more than that lot out there do. I suppose if you wanted to be really helpful you could coax Arthur out of that blooming shed of his. I dread to think what he’s doing in there this time…’
“Yes, well, Granger is a mu-muggleborn isn’t she. It won’t have the same connotations for her. And Weasley. You consider yourself family I dare say. So you see, it’s not really the same…”
He stood in the hallway of the clinic for a long time, having an internal debate with himself over what to do next. He could always go home, but he’d only end up stewing over the things he had said in his session. He couldn’t fathom that all of his problems boiled down to an unwillingness to share his feelings. He told Harry he loved him, didn’t he? He certainly told Teddy so all the time. He gave hugs, he smiled, he laughed, he cried a lot more than he ever had before. It wasn’t as though he was made of stone.
‘But…but…there’ll be even less time!’ Teddy cried. His grip on Draco was starting to hurt, but he said nothing.
“Unless you can transform into a cat or an owl, you’re going to be conspicuous walking through the Ministry, even if you do manage to keep to the shadows.”
‘Christ, Draco,’ Harry said as he grazed a thumb across Draco’s cheek, ‘you’re scaring me.’ Harry pressed a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips but pulled away again to let Draco’s breathing even out.
‘I’m sorry, that must’ve been nasty when you woke up. I was there though, so maybe it wasn’t so bad?’ Draco almost nodded to put the matter to rest, but he knew he shouldn’t hide from Harry anymore, not if he wanted things to improve.
‘See. Some things never change.’ Harry joked as Draco looked at him helplessly. The house smelled like roast dinner and cinnamon which was an assault on Draco’s senses but felt like true Christmas. Teddy had already run off to see his cousins and Draco sidled up to Harry for a hug before he joined the madness.
‘Six months. Just wait it out six months. I swear you can do all the planning and organising you need in that time, but don’t leave for six months. Can you do that, for me?’ He thinks about it.
‘ICE CREAM!’ Teddy yelled at the top of his voice. Draco rolled his eyes at Harry who snickered.
‘Why do I have to tell you where I’m going and what I’m doing every minute of the day? So what I had something to do that didn’t involve you? So shoot me for having a life outside of you!’
Harry was perfectly entitled to date whoever he wanted to when they were separated. That was the whole point in divorce. Of course, it was easy for Draco to say that now, he didn’t need another Leggy-Blonde fiasco. Out of interest, he flipped back to the front page, interested to know how long ago this had been. He froze.
‘Daddy…’ Teddy turned back towards them with the wand gripped tightly in his hand. ‘I already have a wand?’
“Don’t come then,” Lyra snapped. “If it was a shapeshifter,” she said the word with notable distain, “it would have attacked one of us by now. If Harry’s right and none of this is real, what exactly do we have to lose?” She sat with perfect posture, but Harry knew her well enough by now to know that she was terrified. Her eyes couldn’t settle anywhere, and she hadn’t done anything to fix her hair which she was usually so particular about.
‘She told you about that?’ He was very surprised, he assumed Hermione wouldn’t say a word. Although, in her defence, he hadn’t said she couldn’t.
He thought about where he should go. He was burning with anger and he needed an outlet. Going home would only make him feel more caged, but he was still waiting for Hermione to come through on the favour he’d asked her. He couldn’t go to the orphanage, he’d probably terrify the small children who were too young to be at school yet.
‘I-I-I have to go.’ Draco scrabbled in his pockets for his wand. He was too unbalanced to try the floo. It wasn’t until he was turning on the spot that he realised Harry had probably changed the wards after Draco left. As Head Auror and
“Ok… I think. Better than earlier.” He rubbed the back of his neck for something to do with his hands.
‘Come back to mine.’ The man whispered in his ear. Draco grinned despite the fact he couldn’t even see where he was going. He nodded, and the man dragged him off the dancefloor and out of the club. Draco couldn’t remember how he got from the club to the man’s house and he could’ve sworn he’d been outside the club one minute and a blink later he wasn’t.
“Yeah,” Harry affirmed, trying to arrange his face in a sheepish but encouraging smile. For a split second he thought Sirius might shut the door in his face but at the last second Sirius pulled Harry into the house and into a strong embrace. Stepping over the threshold was like stepping back in time. A wave of emotion passed through Harry and he felt the itch of tears pricking in his eyes. It was like his heart had been cracked open and he gripped Sirius tightly, temporarily forgetting about Aspen and letting go of him.
Most of the theory behind the spell, including the hours he tirelessly worked to perfect his translation, he omitted from his explanation. It took longer than he expected to get through it all, especially with little input from Granger who, for once in her life, was pensive and quiet.
‘Yes.’
‘I can’t keep doing this,’ he tells her. ‘It’s too much.’ He hadn’t admitted it to anyone, how much the divorce had taken its toll on him. He’s not even angry anymore, he can’t be. He doesn’t resent Harry for the way things ended, he just wishes there was another way.
“Are you going to make me say it?” The way Draco’s lips moved as he enunciated every syllable was mesmerising; they were full and the perfect shade of dusky pink.
They did make it to the orphanage eventually, it just happened to take a lot longer than either of them expected, since Harry’s hair charm turned Draco’s hair blue instead of straightening it. Naturally, Draco threw a hissy fit and his magic nearly destroyed their bedroom.
“Just after four,” she told him, suddenly looking tired.
He dropped Harry’s letter on the kitchen table and fished around for some treats to give Eltanin, who eagerly accepted them. He was more than curious to know whether Teddy told the two of them the same things, but he respected Harry’s privacy. He thought it was a good thing that they had slightly different relationships with him – hopefully that meant that if there were anything Teddy wouldn’t tell Harry, he might still tell Draco.
‘I don’t talk about Harry. What goes on between us stays between us. He’s not even my husband anyway.’ He felt it like a real pain in his chest when he said it aloud. He hated being reminded how precarious his current situation was. One wrong move and Harry could easily kick Draco out again. There was nothing binding them together anymore, not directly anyway.
‘I never thought I’d say this Weasley, but you’re the safest option around here.’ Ron caught the look on his face.
He looked imploringly at Harry. ‘Tell me you didn’t.’ At least the man had the gumption to look guilty.
He was being weak. He knew that. He was going through the motions day to day, only doing what the healers told him and nothing more. It wouldn’t be enough, and it wouldn’t be what Harry would do. Harry had defied every odd his whole life, he wouldn’t roll over and take it the way Draco had been. Today had proven that Harry needed Draco as much as Draco needed Harry and right now Draco just wasn’t good enough.
‘I’m ok. It’s kind of nice spending time with the kids. They have no idea what’s going on around them.’ He watched as Hugo’s small eyelashes fluttered as he dreamed. His hair was marginally less flame red than it had been last time he’d seen him, and he hoped he might inherit a little more of Hermione’s colouring. Honestly there was only so much ginger an ex-Malfoy could handle.
‘Harry, I know I’ve been an absolute shit, but I need you to help me here, for Teddy’s sake, please.’ He begged him. Harry’s expression softened, and he nodded. He reached out and grabbed Draco’s shaking hand, holding it tightly in his own and suddenly Draco felt like he could breathe again.
“Don’t call me an idiot, this was your idea!” Harry couldn’t tell if Draco was in a rage or hysterical, but either way it wasn’t good.
There was a long silence when he finished, and he dared not look at any of them. Harry felt faintly sick as he waited for each of them to decide it was a step too far even by his standards. He didn’t know where he would go if they turned on him. There was always Luna’s, but Lyra had been staying there for months so he couldn’t be sure Luna would be a viable option. There was always Hermione too, but he didn’t even know where she lived these days.
Of all the parts of the grounds, Draco’s favourite was a small corner towards the western border of their land which was home to a collection of aspen trees. Aspen weren’t native to Wiltshire and although there were plenty of them up in Scotland, his mother had imported this variety from Nova Scotia because they were her favourite. They were quickly becoming his favourite too. On milder days it was under the aspen trees, in the rapidly brightening spring sunshine, that he felt he could think most clearly.
‘I’m not worried.’ He turned away from her and caught Ella clambering up onto the chair clumsily. Bless her heart. ‘You should probably help her with that, I’m not getting involved.’ Daphne laughed and went over to help. Draco took the opportunity to take in the appearance of the salon since Harry was pacing back and forth talking quickly and running his hands through his hair impatiently.
‘Can I try lifting it up the stairs?’ Teddy asked Harry.
He quite literally fell out of the floo once they were back home and Harry’s quick reflexes were all that saved him from ending Christmas with a broken nose. Teddy tried to pretend it was nowhere near his bedtime and he definitely didn’t need to sleep, but after falling asleep halfway through Love Actually, Harry carried him up to bed.
‘He keeps writing me letters. I think he writes them to you too. I assumed that because he wrote us separate ones maybe he wanted to tell us about different things.’ He sniffled. His tears had tried but there was a weariness in his demeanour that shook Draco. ‘At first they were quick notes like he scribbled between classes. He just said he was having a great day and he’d tell me all about it later. But then…’
Taking a deep breath, Harry walked into the middle of the room. Dust motes flew around his head, floating in the streaks of light coming in at an angle through the windows. He shivered again and scrunched his eyes closed before forcing them open again and looking at the tapestry wall. He knew before his eyes found the right area that it was as he suspected. Nestled at the bottom of the family tree was a blond-haired boyish version of the man behind the smoky screen. Harry’s heart swooped as he looked at name Draco Malfoy and he couldn’t quite tell if it was in a good way or not.
“Hey, is that Malfoy? Bloody hell.” Malfoy’s presence didn’t bother Ron nearly as much as it bothered Harry, but he could echo the surprise.
‘You have no idea how long this bullshit has been hanging over me. It’s been killing me these past months keeping it from you. Anything I can do to get us through this, I’ll do it. It’s the least I can do for letting it go on so long in the first place.’ Draco was quiet once again. He hated how intensely good Harry was inside and out. He put him to shame on a daily basis. His left arm twitched, almost as a reminder of how different they were.
Draco was utterly shell-shocked as he slid out of the bed and stood in the middle of his old bedroom wondering whether he should run away now or stay and face the consequences. He always left after a one-night stand. But then, his one-night stands weren’t Harry. If he left now, he could be at work before Harry woke up and Harry would just assume that his random shag just disappeared. Maybe he wouldn’t even remember bringing anyone home at all. How drunk had Harry been anyway? Draco wasn’t sure.
‘I missed him go to school. I left you on your own. I’m sorry.’ He couldn’t help it. He buried his face in Harry’s neck and let himself cry.
‘Do you mind if I head over to the flat?’ He asked but didn’t move from his one-armed hug. Harry squeezed him closer into his side for a second.
“I’ve done it before,” Harry shrugged nonchalantly, “I don’t see why I can’t do it again.” He was beginning to regret having this conversation in the Leaky. It had seemed wise to pick a public place to meet Malfoy, mostly because Harry wasn’t quite sure he trusted him. People had been staring at them since the minute they stepped through the door, despite Harry’s reassuring glance at Tom. If Harry had anticipated telling Malfoy about his plan, or Malfoy’s subsequent anger, he probably would have suggested somewhere more private. The other customers looked ready to spring to Harry’s defence which he found both touching and amusing, since he was supposedly more powerful than all of them put together.
‘You’re such an idiot,’ he said fondly. Harry leant over to kiss him, and it was so much more intense than Draco was expecting that it almost made his toes curl. They were really getting into it when Harry pulled away suddenly and Draco groaned in protest.
‘I did well then?’ Draco turned his attention from the window to Harry, who was watching him carefully.
‘What?’
Whilst the kettle boiled, he went to get some blankets from the cupboard. His favourite grey one was still in the summer house, so he grabbed a deep green one instead. He made two giants mugs of hot chocolate and realised that it wasn’t as simple as levitating the mugs and walking behind them. Not one for doing things the easy way, he walked back through to the living room with the blankets over his head like a dementor with a mug in each hand.
‘I do appreciate it, thank you.’ He grabbed one of Harry’s hands and pulled him closer. ‘What’s got you so stressed though?
‘Well what?’ Draco said as he flipped through the file, ‘I’m no longer coming into the Ministry for the case. I don’t see why that’s such a big deal, Kings-’
“Grow up, Potter,” Lyra snapped, “you can barely stand. You’ll go where I tell you.” His vision distorted as he watched her whip the cover off an over-stuffed armchair and transfigure it into a long, soft looking sofa. The movement of her wand was sure and graceful like she barely had to think about it. He’d never noticed how naturally magic came to her until then. Although her bedside manner still left much to be desired, she helped lower him onto it with surprising gentleness.
‘Nonsense, nonsense. You’ve had far too much to be worrying about to come and visit me. I’ve told you a hundred times to call me Molly, or Mum, if it’s easier.’ She stepped back but kept a tight grip on his arms, looking him up and down. ‘No, no, no, this is terrible. Have you not been feeding yourself? Harry dear, have you not been looking after him? Look at you! You’re as skinny as Harry was back in the day. Honestly, you boys are a disaster without me. Not to worry dear, there’s enough food around here to feed the five thousand!’ She bustled off back to the kitchen, having pinched his cheeks so hard they burned.
‘I have to leave because I’m still in love with him.’ He said bluntly. Hermione’s eyes widened, and she leant forwards on her elbows. ‘I’m still in love with him but I don’t see us ever managing to make it work and I want to move far away where I can find someone who’ll love me without all of this messy history. Is that a good enough answer for you?’
‘No, sweetheart. It’s Draco, Dad’s downstairs.’ He said gently. Of course he wanted Harry.
‘Why, haven’t you?’ She shot him a confused look.
“Yes, I can do that. I’m not an idiot.” He snapped. He didn’t actually know for sure that his plan for escape would work – he was making an educated guess based on his existing knowledge of property magic.
‘We have done the right thing, haven’t we?’ He asked Harry. He propped himself up on one elbow and Harry leant back into a more relaxed position.
‘Teddy still does all of those things?’
“We’re looking for something dating to around the seventeenth century.” She said as she scanned the first bookcase. “I’m not sure exactly what kind of thing it would be in. It might be something totally unmarked, or it could be hidden in a Dark Arts book. It’s really difficult to say.
‘Well, it turned out we couldn’t find anything that linked Runcorn of Hopkirk to the clinic because they weren’t directly involved. We’d assumed that the healers at the clinic were in on the deal because they’d been handing out those pills to everyone who walked through the door. It’s easy to assume private clinics will bend the law just to make a packet. Well, turns out they were doing that, just not the way we expected.’
It wasn’t like any kiss they’d ever shared before. It wasn’t like any kiss Draco had ever had with anyone. At first it felt like Harry’s lips were just ghosting over Draco’s, Draco was even about to question if any of it was real when it seemed like Harry’s last thread of restraint snapped. He pulled Draco flush to him and kissed him like his life depended on in. Draco could feel Harry’s chest pressed flush against his own and his hands trembled as he tried his best to be the strong one of the pair.
“Draco, you’re standing in a supply cupboard Polyjuiced as a muggle so that you can break into the Department of Mysteries. There’s nothing legal about this. Besides, I was thinking if this works it won’t matter what I said or did. We can stand here arguing about it all day, or we can get to that Veil before the Polyjuice wears off.”
A man in a giant red suit flying through the sky to deliver gifts to every believing child in the world? Impossible. Even more ludicrous that one company could single-handedly change the image of such a figure just through the sheer power of advertising. Everyone knows green is better than red.
‘What does this mean Draco?’ Harry asked him as they waited for Kingsley.
He sighed. ‘Yes. I have to go home, and you have to stay here.’ He held his breath and hoped she wouldn’t kick off again. When she stayed quiet, he extracted himself. ‘I’ll be around, but don't expect me to come running every time.’ He didn’t wait for an answer, instead he straightened out his crumpled clothes and nodded stiffly at Susan as he left the room. It killed him to leave her there, he could almost feel his heart breaking, but what choice did he have?
“Potter- Harry. I know we haven’t exactly seen eye-to-eye in the past, but you should know that we will support you in this. I mean,
‘I take it you didn’t come here to fix my hair.’
“Please, Harry. Don’t do something you’ll regret. No one will save you this time.” Malfoy pinned him with such a piercing look that Harry’s insides turned to jelly, his name rolling off Malfoy’s tongue like he’d been using it for years. Was it possible that Malfoy knew more than he was letting on? Surely not. No one knew anything about the Department of Mysteries except the Unspeakables, and there was no way on earth Malfoy held a position as important as that.
‘What.’ He watched as Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. He reserved making any judgements until he’d given Harry the opportunity to explain himself.
‘I did so many things wrong, I know that. I haven’t given you a moment’s peace since everything fell apart and I didn’t realise how important it was for you to have you space. All I know is it killed me to think I might never get to talk to you like this or hold you like this again. I know life got in the way but we’re still us, aren’t we?’ Draco sighed. He wanted this so badly, he really did. He couldn’t say he wasn’t scared though. It was different now, they didn’t have to spend time getting to know each other and figuring out the future. They’d done that already and if they messed it up a second time there would be no going back.
That was it!
He drifted off into a fitful sleep, not caring that it was only four in the afternoon. He was more than done with the day.
Harry couldn’t stand to listen to her much longer. With the delicate notes of the second song the whole pub had descended into silence and Harry’s claustrophobia had become unbearable. The air crackled against his skin like it was charged. His seat nearly tumbled to the floor with the force with which he stood but after teetering dangerously on its back legs it clattered back down.
‘Love you too Ted.’ He hugged him gently and ran a hand through his messy blond hair before leaving and closing the door behind him.
‘Oh, yes I’m fine. I just need some water.’ He helped himself to a glass and he sat down at the kitchen table with her since most of the pans were happily stirring themselves with impeccable household charms. He thought she was a very smart woman pretending she needed to be glued to the kitchen when she really didn’t. He doubted either of them would get a word in edgeways if they went outside…
‘Sommeliers all over France are weeping right now,’ he said instead. Harry’s hand came to rest on his hip and he almost forgot to be pretentious for a second.
. A literal translation would be referring to the staff carried by the Greek god Hermes or his Roman counterpart, Mercury. Did that mean a long staff, the literal caduceus, or was it a roundabout way of referring to a magical wand in a time before they were in popular use? It was impossible to say.
“You wanted to kiss me.” The disbelief in his voice sounded wrong even two his own ears, but he found the concept of her wanting him difficult. That afternoon at Luna’s Harry had been the one to move in first and although Lyra had seemed very pleased with the notion, nothing had been said about it since.
‘Mother?’ He asked disbelievingly. Even his voice sounded as if it was underwater; muffled and warped and it completely contrasted with the fire in his veins. The figure turned, and Draco realised that it was indeed his mother. She was foggy and not totally in focus, but she was there, and just like that he remembered.
“Lyra is my cousin, Harry. She’s actually been making quite the effort to see me.” Harry immediately felt terrible for neglecting the only family he had left. What must Sirius think of him? He instantly agreed to stay for dinner, even though he would have accepted the invitation even if he hadn’t been guilted into it by fucking Malfoy.
“I told you, don’t lift the-”
‘Really? That’s what you got out of this?’ He set the wine down on the table and motioned for Draco to budge up.
‘Yes, Master?’
Harry could hear the laughter in Draco’s voice and couldn’t stop himself from smiling. Draco’s picnic went uneaten until well after dark, neither of them wanted to untangle themselves from the other.
his dreams could be real, but
It’s a shock when Malfoy himself opens the door, rather than the house elf Harry expected. He hasn’t changed much since the last time Harry saw him – jawline a touch sharper, cheeks a little less full. The biggest difference Harry can see is his hair. It’s much longer now, reaching down to his shoulders. The top half is pulled back from his face, emphasising how sharp his features still are.
‘It’s been three years Granger, haven’t I given it long enough?’ She smirks at his slip, she’s not been Granger for a long time and she can always tell she’s getting through if he accidently calls her by her old name.
‘I can see that. I can also see that your current coping mechanisms haven’t been helping you. Perhaps it’s time to change that?’ Draco hated the idea of Smith being right. He didn’t say anything for a while. ‘Why is it that you struggle to talk to Harry? You’ve made it clear to me that he’s important to you and you obviously think very highly of him.’ Draco took a deep breath. He knew the reason why, he’d always known it, he just refused to acknowledge it.
‘Don’t be sorry. We’ll get through it.’ He felt heavy in Harry’s arms, but he didn’t want to fall asleep, there were things he wanted to say, things he wanted to do. He’d barely done a thing all day, he didn’t have the right to be tired.
He had reached the bottom of the lane by the time he came back to himself. He hadn’t even thought about where he was going. That was stupid, and irresponsible, and very Harry. He’d been right about the cold though, his breath was visible in the dull air and he stood for a second and watched the clouds dissipate with each exhale.
‘You’ve missed a lot while you were sleeping Mr Potter. The healer determined your injuries are linked to your previous exposure to dark magic. It’s really quite nasty. It seems your magic is being blocked by your own mind, which in turned is triggering…well, I’m sure you know what I mean.’ His eyes flickered to his left forearm – a habit which he thought he had long broken. He was surprised to find it was bandaged over.
He stayed in the bathroom, staring at his reflection in the grimy mirror as he took deep breaths and waited for his heart rhythm to settle. His cheeks were flushed red and his eyes looked unfocused. Was he really ready to admit that he believed in the alternate Malfoy in his dreams when there was a very real Malfoy who made him feel like this? Doubt crept over him like a shadow and he forced himself to push the idea to one side. Whichever was the truth, he still had to know what all of this was about.
And his blood would be on Draco’s hands.
“Tell her yourself.” And then she was gone.
‘I forgot what it was like to be around you when you get passionate about stuff. It makes your whole face light up like Teddy’s does at Christmas. It’s beautiful.’ The intensity of Harry’s gaze alone would’ve made him blush. But that? That was something else…
In the fifth month of Draco’s not-deal with Hermione, he moved to the outskirts of Paris. It was a strange transition, because he hadn’t expected to be making trips back and forth between his rented flat and a bloody chateau. Perhaps he’d been a bit premature with his move, but he used the first month in France to get the family estate in a liveable condition.
‘It’s up to you.’ Harry frowned. Draco couldn’t exactly blame him. Draco tried to watch as Harry undressed, but his eyelids were already getting heavy. His heart fluttered as he felt Harry slip into the bed next to him and draw him against his chest. He could hear Harry’s heartbeat thumping steadily against his ear and he sighed as his fingers ran through his hair slowly. Wherever their bare skin touched Draco felt as though he was on fire, but it was worth it. He saw Harry’s arm wave out of the corner of his half-closed eyes and the shutters around the room closed, plunging them into darkness.
‘What on earth are you doing?’ She twisted around to stare at him incredulously.
“Well,” Granger began hesitantly. Draco found it amusing that she was now being so timid; it made a significant change from the last time he had an ‘important’ discussion with her. “I’ve heard on the grapevine,” she gestured vaguely, “that the Ministry have found Harry’s wand.” Draco had just finished taking a sip of tea as she spoke, and his teacup clattered back onto the saucer more violently that he anticipated.
‘Perish the thought. Seriously though, I’m sorry I had a go at you for spending time brewing. It’s one of your passions and I shouldn’t have tried to get in your way. I just hated seeing that haunted look on your face those times you got rejected from healer training and I wanted everyone to know you weren’t the person you used to be. You were only a fucking child…’
He was pulled from that train of thought when Eltanin clawed at his cage impatiently. Neither Harry nor Teddy seemed to notice so Draco walked down the hallway to the front door to let the owl out for a fly. Eltanin perched happily on Draco’s arm when he opened the cage door and Draco smoothed out a few ruffled feathers on his wing. He hooted happily and nibbled at Draco’s knuckles.
Hermione had been researching? He knew the woman was a formidable researcher but surely, she wouldn’t be able to find that which the healers couldn’t. He didn’t like how casually she dropped the word horcrux into that letter, however brief it might have been.
‘Excellent. If I don’t see you again before you go Draco, I’d personally like to thank you for your help. You’ve saved lives here, and it won’t go unnoticed.’ Draco tried his best to ignore the final comment, he refused to be a charity case. Angling personal favours in the right political spheres had been his father’s gag and look how well that had worked out for him.
, they had everything they could ever ask for. Family on the other hand, that was what had always matter to Harry. Draco knew he hadn’t had a ‘family’ Christmas until he’d met the Weasleys and after their first Christmas with Teddy, Draco had found him crying in their bedroom at the end of the day, having been overwhelmed by the feeling.
“I’m going to the lab,” he muttered, allowing his chair to scrape across the floor as he stood. Let them talk it out between themselves.
“Is as useful as a chocolate teapot,” Draco finished for her. “I’m sorry. I didn’t want to imply that I don’t want to help, I do, but I also don’t think Potter would want you to harm yourself trying to help him.”
‘You have an appointment with the magical therapist soon to see how your magic is coming along. As far as your magical core is concerned, it’s still stable but remains weak. I do hope you’ve been taking it easy…’ Draco zoned out once again as she gave him the usual spiel. Every appointment had been exactly the same since he’d been released after the poisoning which nearly killed him.
“I would be delighted,” he told her distractedly. He didn’t particularly care about Astoria’s engagement. It was a blessing that their own engagement had fallen through. She was a lovely girl but there was no love lost between them. They were far too young to be getting married anyway; why the Greengrasses were so keen he couldn’t fathom.
‘Kids don’t come with an instruction manual,’ he joked. Draco couldn’t manage a laugh.
“I’m going to overlook that comment since it was me who cooked you that paella you loved so much.”
‘Me either,’ Draco reluctantly admitted.
Luckily for Draco, the featherlight charm on the box was still in place, so getting it down the ladder was more of a spatial problem than a weighty one. By the time he got to the bottom he couldn’t be bothered to take the ladder back out to the shed, so he pushed it to one side and decided to ask Harry to do it later.
‘Granger, why are you bringing me here? Aren’t you supposed to be somewhere?’ She pulled the diamonds from her ears and dropped them into a wooden dish in the hallway. She stepped out of her shoes on her way and left them in her wake. Draco knew she tried to keep a tidy house to set an example for the kids, so it was strange to see her be so lackadaisical. He followed after her.
‘You say that like it was a choice the first time.’ He sat on their bed and unwound the leather straps. He’d had enough of this – going over and over it. He really just wanted to move on.
Even after the train disappeared, Harry kept holding onto Draco. Draco wanted desperately to say something, but he didn’t want to break the spell and remind Harry that he hated Draco. He knew he’d been an arse and he didn’t deserve for Harry to be even fake nice to him, but he was selfish, and he wanted it.
Turning back into the house when they had disappeared down the driveway, Draco forced himself to focus. The first hurdle he would have to overcome was getting out of the Manor without tripping the wards. He had wanted to test the strength of them ever since the beginning of his house arrest, but there hadn’t been a reason worthy enough of risking it until now. He had waited until Granger had gone, however, since he knew she would not approve of his methods.
‘Would you? I know you’ve got a lot on your plate, but it would really help.’ She grabbed one of those muggle post-on notes or whatever it was they were called and jotted something down.
‘This is great Draco, maybe the adrenaline brought out your magic! You should talk to your healer about it as soon as possible. Fascinating…’
‘If you agree to help I’ll send you over the analysis from St Mungo’s. They tested for traces of poisons and nothing showed up, but we’re not convinced they haven’t used something untraceable. They’re not under any spells and they’re not responding to treatment. We really just need someone who’s got knowledge of rare potions and ingredients who can do more in-depth analysis. It would also be useful to get you to assess any facilities we come across, like the warehouse. Aurors have potions experience but nowhere near your level of expertise.’ Harry shut himself up when he realised he was babbling. Once upon a time, Draco had found Harry’s babbling unbelievably cute, he always did it when he was nervous. Now though, it infuriated him. The coward couldn’t even be professional with him in front of the Minister.
Draco was nervous about picking Teddy up, he didn’t know how he would react to everything. He was also worried that if Teddy was struggling with school, coming back to all the baggage Draco and Harry had wouldn’t do him any good. But then, wouldn’t it also have been hard on Teddy to have to split his time between them? He didn’t know. He’d adapted so well to everything after the divorce, and they were uprooting things yet again. It was always a hard balance between doing the best for them and the best for Teddy. Draco didn’t always think they picked the right option.
They started walking away from the joke shop and passed Flourish and Blotts. Harry had a newfound appreciation for the bookshop since he had discovered reading was actually quite fun when he had glasses which were the right prescription with no cracks across the lenses. Hermione sometimes dragged him to the secondhand bookshop at the other end of the alley, but he wasn’t as fascinated by inscriptions or first editions as she was.
‘This is going to sound so big-headed…’ He looked at Harry nervously, not really wanting to say what he was thinking. He knew it would sound bad as soon as he said it aloud. ‘I just- I miss that feeling of having someone think you can do no wrong. You know, when Teddy was little and he looked at you like you were the whole world. Kids trust us blindly, don’t they? They don’t know all the things that happened in the past and even if they did, they wouldn’t understand. They just love you because you’re nice to them.’ It sounded even worse than he thought when he said it out loud.
getting Harry’s eye.
As the men exited the ballroom, another cloaked figure started to make his way out, steps echoing in the still silent room, before The Dark Lord spoke:
xoxo, gossip girl
“Hermione Granger just cornered me” Draco told Pansy and Blaise, while launching himself over Pansy’s bed, in the girls empty dormitory “I’ll have to meet her tomorrow in the library” he whined, throwing one arm over his face, to cover his eyes and add a visual cue to his despair.
- Hope this chapter helped justify a little more of Harry's character!
With a trembling hand, Bellatrix gave her wand for her nephew to hold, and got down with her sister in front of him, waiting expectantly “Return it to me Draco, please”. He looked at her with wide eyes, held the wand tightly with both hands, and closed his eyes, his face contorted with effort. “Are you doing it? Is it working?” she asked, her tone starting to gain back the edge of hysteria.
They approached Draco as the older students left.
She looked up to the darkening sky, imagining the full Moon that would bloom there in a few hours.
– oops! Bad word. That’s a bad word. He knew that because Tessa told him after he said it once. Yeah, let’s forget that. This is not even
Cygnus’s daughter was in such a state of disarray he hadn’t seen on her even when she was a child. She was on her knees in the dirt, leaving brown stains in her cream-colored robes. Her platinum hair falling precariously from an updo, while she used her bare hands to dig out roses frantically, eyes puffy, red rimmed and tired – a disturbing contrasting to her frantic expression.
After giving the school owl a treat, Draco was leaving the tower when he came face to face with a certain dark-haired boy. “Oh, hi” he said to the slightly taller boy, quirking his head sideways. “Hello” Harry glanced away nervously before dodging Draco to enter the owlery, attaching a letter to the leg of a snowy owl and petting it fondly.
“Well, you’re wrong” Harry said, before getting up to leave the Common Room.
The Slytherins were reluctant at first, but after a mild temper tantrum, a few covert threats and a poorly put-together inspiring speech about unity and the glory of their school years, even the older students agreed to participate.
Sirius didn’t have answers either “Well, for a part of my life I also thought I could trust him, so I guess I just don’t know the man. I don’t know why he is coming after you Harry – maybe it’s revenge, maybe he want’s to finish what he started... There’s no way for me to know.
As the crowd dispersed, letting the players leave to change from their uniforms and the rest of the students going back into the castle for the promise of a celebratory party, Blaise and Pansy went after Draco, who got lost during the commemoration.
“Flint. Focus. Of course it makes sense” Miles pointed again at the open DADA book in front of the other boy.
Draco Malfoy always had a rather
“How convenient for them” Harry’s eyes narrowed towards the Slytherin table “And I am not overreacting”. The white-haired boy had a bored expression, barely moving his mouth while talking with the other people on his table. Harry cringed as he saw that a lot of the great hall was looking at the boy, gossiping furiously, a lot of people were paying
about this cape, you’ll lose your privileges” he gave them a pointed look.
“Merlin, I truly hate that man” Ron fell into the couch besides Harry “I’m never doing anything for Fred and George ever again”
“Those are some impressive reflexes. Youngest seeker in ages? I can totally see that”
– Harry knew his name, but it sounded so good with his posh accent. The boy gave a small frown and Harry realized he hadn’t said anything, he had actually forgotten what Draco had said...
“Sorry” Cedric Diggory smiled as he propped himself on the ground next to Draco, who was getting to a seated position. “Some students said you’ve been here since lunch, I wanted to check that you hadn’t been stunned or something like that”.
“What! I didn’t even do anything!” Harry tries to defend himself from her intense staring.
“Harry” Ron intervened, looking slightly concerned.
“He was spotted in Albania” Tessa explained “The Dementors are leaving the school, and you are free again. Surprise!”
Harry stumbled through the corridors, with no destination, he just knew he wanted to be alone. He heard people saying “Hi” or asking if something was wrong, but he just walked right past them, not seeing their faces. He ended up in a empty hallway, in a part of the castle he’d never been to before.
Draco’s eyes darted around the room in alarm before stiffly agreeing to do the assignment with her.
to study in the same place his family did, with so many knowledgeable and powerful wizards! But he kept his cool. He was a Malfoy, after all, and Malfoys don’t squeak – it’s undignified, or at least that what his aunt was always saying.
1. Can we all collectively pretend that Cedric is only two years older and not FOUR? I'm gonna mention this later in the fic but let me say this here too just to let y'all KNOW.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
“NO!” Abraxas cried as the crack of apparition sounded trough the room. Nacissa’s own followed, and Lucius just after. With doubled effort, Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Cygnus and Abraxas finished the remaining Death Eaters, before apparating themselves to Draco’s room.
“Uhm, why don’t you two go ahead?” he said “I’ll meet you in the party later”
For a moment, Tessa was so distracted by the glasses that she didn’t notice the small gray cat laying beside him, until Harry started speaking to it.
“Oh, no, no, no” Ron continued bitterly “She’s just more discrete. But don’t think I didn’t notice that our picture from last term suspiciously disappeared. I think she’s making a secret altar for you in her room” he grinned at Harry.
It came with no surprise that little Draco would like to spend his afternoons curled up in his mothers lap and surrounded by her magic. But whenever his father and grandfather argued, he was prone to magical flare ups - once he even lit on fire the halls of the West Wing, and it took months for them to repare themselves.
Harry’s stomach dropped as his two friends stared at him expectantly. He looked down at the possible answers, trying to find the right one, and he felt a embarrassed blush starting to creep up his cheeks. He tried not to panic – there were four possible answers, so he might just guess it right. He went with option B.
They never told me, and I never saw anything like... you saw”
“Well? I’m intrigued” he pleaded. His mother put down her tea and straightened her posture – which was already impeccable before.
new. And, how was Dad ever
“I was saying, dear Harry, that in life, not everything comes easily. Sometimes you will have to struggle to find, or ever realize, what is important to you”
, and for the looks of it, Snape was trying to make it obvious for the rest of the students as well. Which didn’t help the whole ‘finding sympathy for him’ thing.
There really was a reason as to why it was called a revolutionary model. So much speed, so much control, so much precision... He was feeling giddy.

Snape really didn’t like Harry Potter.
Draco was thinking if it was something worth reporting to Trelawney, when he accidentally focused on her. It caught his attention because what he felt wasn’t her regular steady flow of energy – but a anxious indistinct ripple that was fragmenting and putting itself together. It was frightening, and before he had time to reconsider, he touched Genevieve's back firmly. The cat
a few days ago, Blaise and Pansy had been enthusiastic about learning it. They were aware that it was a tough spell, but were up for the challenge anyway. Surprisingly, both of them could already produce a silver mist, which was no small feat. Draco was satisfied about it, he knew he would never have dweebs for his best friends.
As all the other Death Eaters started to blast hexes, Bellatrix tried to stand, but the pain in her head pulled her right back down. However, her father came to crouch next to her, muttering a string of spells as Rodolphus stood before them, using shield charms and blasting hexes. “How is she, Cygnus?” her husband asked, strained, and as she felt the last of the pounding in her head vanish, her father answer “Just dandy”. And they joined the fight.

“What is it?” Oliver asked.

For Blaise, at least.
It was not long after that all of them fell into the web of despair and false promises of one Dark Lord, and Narcissa’s smiles became controlled and empty.
“That’s what I’m saying!” Oliver agreed “I knew Mr. Brown just hated our class”. Harry, exhaled, relieved. But before Oliver could take the sheet of paper out of Harry’s hand to put it back in the drawer, Daniel held it in place, with a weird expression on his face.
. She really did try.
“How are you enjoying Hogwarts? Your uncle told me you got into Slytherin! Oh you make me so proud!”
He also pulled Blaise into a hug afterwords, for good measure.
“But, you know, they love us very much. Even this tension, it’s only here because they’re so worried about us getting hurt. You know that, don’t you? Dad cares about-“
The letter also stated that there was no reason for alarm, because nothing would change overnight – that line helped calm Draco down a bit -, and finished with a request for patience regarding him specifically. It was wrote that there were vital things in play that he didn’t know about yet, but would be soon revealed over Christmas Break, so he should proceed with caution. Very ominous and - now that he felt level headed once again, he could admit – a tad dramatic. But he went with it.
This time, Remus muttered spells to test the integrity of the shield, and his eyebrows went to his hairline “This is very advanced magic Mr. Malfoy, very impressive”. Harry raised his wand to try and use a severing charm to break the bubble, but Remus stopped him “No, no, no, Harry. It will bounce off and hit you. This type of spellwork needs to be ended by the caster; either that or call a cursebreaker. Again, impressive. Would you, Mr. Malfoy?”. The white-haired boy raised his wand the bubble dissolved softly around Harry.
He tried to act as normal as possible, and it was easy, to just fall back in the happy family dynamic they had. Soon, he pretty much forgot that anything was wrong, because he was enjoying the morning so much. They all got plenty of sweets, some books, clothes, miscellaneous magical artifacts, suspicious magical artifacts, and even one sentient magical artifact – a typical Christmas morning.
Draco stared dumbfoundedly at Blaise. “Why would you want to help me?”
‘No.’ She said petulantly.
“Harry?” Sirius rasped. It sounded like he hadn’t used his voice for a long time. Perhaps he hadn’t.
They’d agreed to decorate the house in warm shades throughout. Draco had surprised Harry with this because Harry had assumed he’d want an ultra-modern house full of chrome. Years living in the dark and cold manor had meant Draco wanted the exact opposite. Now that he was back for the first time in three years, he marvelled at the way the bright summer sunshine shone through the hallway. It bounced off the mirror Draco had strategically placed opposite the coats and filled the hall with a warm glow which accentuated the pale-yellow walls. He’d always loved the warmth of this house, something about it always evoked an inner peace he could never achieve anywhere else.
“I don’t quite know how to phrase this part,” she said to the paper. Harry was so convinced that she had forgotten he was there that he leant over to read what she had written so far, mostly to remind her she wasn’t talking to herself. At that exact moment, Malfoy turned her head towards him to seek his opinion. They were a hair’s breadth from clanging their foreheads together, but they managed to stop in time.
‘Masters Potter, sirs. Spungen is very pleasing to see you. Master Draco is being required these.’ He handed two potions over which Harry gripped clumsily in his free hand. ‘Spungen be unpacking masters’ belongings now sirs.’ Draco indicated to the left to tell Harry to take him through to the nearest sitting room. The chateau appeared to be spotless, unlike the last time Draco had made the journey. Harry helped him onto one of the few
‘I’m really, really sorry.’ He repeated. Ella clung onto him again.
‘You can’t stay here Draco. You can go backwards, or you can go forwards, but you can’t stay here.’ She told him quietly. He was confused.
‘Oh!’ Pansy seemed astounded. ‘That’s not the impression he gave me. He spent a good ten minutes talking about how well you were fitting into the department and how fantastic your work is.’ Draco took in her appearance. Her black hair was cropped into a harsh bob cut and despite living in Dubai for the past ten years, she was as deathly pale as she had always been. Pansy’s face wasn’t one that hid her emotions well which meant for a Slytherin she was quite terrible at lying.
If it was a dog or a cat Harry could have easily held out until morning, but from the days when Uncle Vernon made them all watch Countryfile on the television, Harry was under the impression foxes could dangerous when kept shut in. It did seem so very…calm though. Cautiously, he leant down to the fox’s level. It stopped its pawing and looked at him with its pale blue eyes. Up close Harry could see its fur was a blend of soft greys and whites. Its teeth looked sharp and menacing the way they were bared at Harry, but the fox seemed to be panting with excitement. Tentatively, Harry reached his hand out and it sunk into the thick fur.
‘He decided having a secretary wasn’t working for him. He’s been making a lot of changes to the way the executive office works recently. He’s upgraded the role to a PA instead and-’
He decided to walk down to the nearby village. It was muggle, which Draco had hated when Harry had first suggested it, but he had gotten used to it over the years. It wasn’t very far, maybe half a mile one way, but he knew he would have to be careful. He’d lost track of his potions timings and couldn’t be sure if the previous amount one would last.
The jobs he’d been looking for in France all appeared to be much of a muchness. So, he’d decided to arrange a meeting at Gringotts to see if he could take out a business loan and set up on his own in France. He hadn’t told anyone about his plan, because he would be far too embarrassed if he was refused.
‘My mother and I. Father always had so many rules about the clothes we would wear or the things we would say. There was no crying, no laughing, no anger. Everything was “unbecoming of a Malfoy”. It was like being a Greek statue most of the time. Of course, once I went to Hogwarts, there wasn’t much he could do about it. I supposed that was why I lashed out as much as I did. It was fun having my own voice. He wasn’t a bad parent though, he thought he was maintaining the elite. He thought he was teaching me everything I needed to know about being untouchable.’ Smith didn’t say anything at first. He simply kept surveying Draco like he was waiting for some kind of giant revelation.
‘Why would you ever think that?’ Harry’s voice was thick and deep, and it made Draco feel so much worse. As if Harry had been worried about hurting him with everything that had gone on with Wood, and here they were the other way round. ‘What did I do to make you think that? Please, tell me what I did.’
‘What the- you can’t be- you’re dead.’ He eventually stuttered out.
‘There you go then,’ Harry said with a smile and kissed him again. ‘I don’t care what anyone else thinks, I care what you think.’
‘I panicked! I trust Ron. He’s never let me down and I knew he wouldn’t say a thing if I asked him not to. Hermione, well, Hermione’s great with secrets too but she’s so soft on you I thought she might try to tip you off. Shit, this all sounds so manipulative.’ Harry’s tone was getting more and more irate, his breathing uneven, as he tried to explain but couldn’t get his words out.
‘He misses you, you know.’ Hermione said quietly. Draco looked at her. ‘It’s true. He was furious when he realised you’d just upped and left. I’ve never seen him so bad. He nearly destroyed your flat when he found it empty. Don’t worry though, I caught him in time.’ She added hastily, acknowledging Draco’s alarmed expression.
September 1998. Then, traces of Potter’s magical signature had been detected by a specialist team of Unspeakables, or so Granger told him. It wasn’t public knowledge nor would it be. Granger said it was all too convenient that the Ministry could use the Unspeakables to say whatever they wanted, but in Draco’s opinion it really didn’t matter whether it was right or not; they had to prepare for the worst.
Harry’s hands are sweating as he knocks on the Manor door. It’s been, well,
‘Are you sad?’ Draco smiled at him.
“Draco! There you are!” His eyes snapped open. Sensations started coming back to him – the feeling of the sun edging out over the cover of the trees, the birds singing and small animals rustling in the hedgerows. Pansy was marching towards him across the grass with purpose, a look of exasperation on her face.
It was strange that even though she didn’t ask him how he took it, she still managed to present him with tea exactly how he liked it; milky with one sugar. He couldn’t help but stare down at the cup as she put in in front of him – had she taken that much notice in school? He didn’t ask. Together they walked back through to the conservatory Malfoy had been sitting in when Harry had arrived. She took the lid back off the weather jar and Harry removed his coat and the jumper he had been wearing underneath. It was like sitting out in the sun on a baking hot August day.
In the second month of Draco’s agreement with Hermione, Draco quit his job. His bosses were furious, they even tried to blackmail him into staying, but Draco held his ground and walked out of there with his head held high.
‘He lied to me Mum. He lied again and again and now I don’t know if I can trust him. What if I need to have my secrets? He doesn’t understand.’
It didn’t appear to be the right time to say that Draco wasn’t in fact a Malfoy. When they’d married, Draco had actually taken Harry’s name. It surprised a lot of people; the papers had been running bets on whether they’d become Potter-Malfoys or Malfoy-Potters, but Draco was firm. He no longer had a reason to associate with the Malfoy family. He had no family left and no land to claim – he figured his marriage would mark the end of the family line and the beginning of a new life. Anyway, Draco had never found the time or the inclination to change his name back after the divorce. He didn’t particularly enjoy being a Potter, but since no one had ever bothered referring to him as one it hardly made any difference anyway. Only the legal documents would show any different.
He took some upstairs and left it outside the study door, knowing full well that was where Harry would have gone. He felt terrible, especially since Harry had been feeling low and Draco had made it worse. He was no good at this. He knocked on the door and went back downstairs, knowing Harry probably wouldn’t answer.
‘Here. Let me. You’re shaking.’ He held onto Draco’s hand to steady his arm and took over what Draco had started. ‘I take it it was you I managed to bring home last night.’ He said, not looking up from Draco’s arm. ‘Did we…?’ He trailed off awkwardly. Draco wasn’t sure why Harry was quite so bashful, it wasn’t as if they hadn’t slept together before. Yes, it wasn’t the wisest decision Draco had ever made, but he’d rather have had a one-night stand with Harry than a stranger. Judging by the familiar ache Draco had, and the fact he’d been completely starkers when he woke up, there was no question in his mind what they’d done.
‘There was a deposit of dark magic in your heart when you came in. A very stubborn one at that. Your husband did the best he could to stop it spreading – without him you likely would have died. Goodness knows how he knew that counter curse. We spent the better part of the time you’ve been here trying to reverse the effects. It’s been about a week since the deposit was dissipated fully.’
‘Ella, I know you’ve missed him, but would you mind if I borrowed Draco for a few minutes?” He asked her politely. Draco always thought it was cute the way Harry spoke to kids almost the same way he would speak to adults, he always managed to make them feel important. Ella pursed her lips again.
‘Sure. Fine. Whatever.’ He said hurriedly, practically shooing her off. She stood and kissed his cheek.
There was a scuffling from the bath and Harry’s attention was immediately piqued. It was then that he noticed the shower curtain had been ripped from its hooks, in the same manner as the living room curtains, and was crumpled in the bottom of the bath. It was the shower curtain Hermione had bought when the previous one had started going mouldy. It was pale pink with white elephants all over it, but most importantly it was currently moving.
Their eyes met once more. “I want you to kiss me.” The steady determination in his voice as he said it broke something in Harry and leant forwards and captured Draco’s lips hungrily. He imagined this was what sunshine would taste like if such a thing were possible. A different kind of warmth flooded through Harry as Draco met his kiss with equal fervour.  Somewhere in the back of Harry’s mind he had half expected Draco to be a tentative kisser, although he should have known better.
‘That’s not true and you know it. I’m not letting you leave again.’
.” Nothing. Maybe he wasn’t saying it loud enough? He tried one more time. He screamed it so loudly and with such force that some of the birds hiding out in the depths of the trees flew away. But still nothing happened. The thunder continued to roll overhead.
“Are you really here to help me or do you just want to make sure I’m miserable?” She pursed her lips.
‘Do they need to understand that? Or do you?’ She gave him a pointed look and he didn’t reply. Mainly because he couldn’t answer.
‘Thank you,’ he said breathlessly when they pulled away. ‘You’ve been nothing but good to me through all of this and I’ve been a total shit to you sometimes.’
Granger looked up at him with watery eyes. “But what choice do we have?”
‘Regeneration Potion?! As in, that awful dark magic concoction supposedly used to bring Voldemort back from the beyond?’ She sucked in a sharp breath when he called The Dark Lord by his still-fake name. It had taken him ages to be able to say it himself, but he had done it. As he’d once read in a book way back when, “fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.”
