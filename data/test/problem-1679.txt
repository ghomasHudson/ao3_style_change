Dumbledore stood up as he walked towards his window that overlooked the grounds of Hogwarts. The small lights off in the distances from Hogsmeade illuminating the dark night. A deep growl left his throat, magic flaring again. He would find that brat if it was the last thing he would ever do.
“I knew an idiot like you wouldn’t be able to follow the simplest of instructions!” Petunia’s shrill voice yelled loudly, making sure to slam the front door closed behind her.
"Alright so we will meet back here in a month to discuss things," he said, looking around the room. "Fletcher, same as always. Keep an eye on crime reports in both worlds. Shacklebolt, watch any information within the ministry and any possible reports of Harry Potter."
Instead of responding, Harry merely stood up and allowed his wand to slip down into his hand once more. He pointed his wand down at Steven, watching the intense fear ignite in his eyes. Harry took a deep breath before moving his wand smoothly in the correct motion. He focused on casting the very difficult spell '
“And you know no one can access it since he is in prison, correct?” he continued asking in disbelief.
“Harry, we’ve talked about this. You need to go back to the wizarding world and draw him in,” he said with a soft tone, empathising with the younger. “You need to find the remaining Horcruxes and destroy them so he is mortal once more.”
Harry took three long strides to reach the other window. Again, he hugged his body to the wall in case his target was suddenly to appear. He turned his head slightly and gazed upon a quiet living room. Mismatched furniture was spread out along the walls, dimly lit lighting created soft shadows, an ominous bookcase looming tall, hiding a very dark secret inside. The hairs on Harry's arms stand straight just looking at where the hidden photos were. This was one of the sickest cases he had dealt with in quite a while. No doubt this will give him much pleasure to end this sicko's life.
The door to Dumbledore's office suddenly swung open and startled the old man whom sat behind his desk reading over documentation. Order member after Order member waltzed in to the office, the space soon becoming cramped. Dumbledore looked confused at the unexpected assemble of the group. The whole atmosphere that radiated from them was anger and upset, he knew this was not going to be a very pleasant meeting. Especially considering the unannounced visit.
Snape started talking with Malfoy during the meal which left Harry to sit in silence, tuning the two out as talk turned over to potions. As Harry ate, he couldn’t help but glance over at Malfoy, watching as the young man smiled, not smirked, as he talked passionately about the subject. Harry thought that the smile suited him very well, much better than the sneer or smug smirk he usually wore whenever in Harry’s presence.
“What? You would have what?” scoffed Harry. “Try and save me only for me to be put back in their care by Dumbledore? You wouldn’t have succeeded in helping me, Remus.”
The room was silent as the teenagers and young adults looked at each other. While the comment was mostly directed at the twins, they knew she also meant to leave the young boy upstairs well alone. Like Harry had said before leaving, it had been quite an exhausting day with the stressful events. All of them felt a sense of tiredness looming in the air after the adrenaline began to wear off. They continued sitting in silence for a little longer, not really sure what to talk about in the presence of the guest.
“Fred, George, go get your older brothers and your father,” Molly spun around, wiping her sweaty hands on her apron. “Ron make sure you are looking after Ginny. You two are not allowed to leave until we come back.”
“Or possibly I could stay at a place with more space, the Weasley’s would be more than welcomed to join me, and anyone else that is training me,” Harry tried his best to compress the smirk that was bubbling under the surface.
He had been studying this man's routine for two weeks straight. He knew every move. Every detail about his life. This man's name was Kevin Owens, he was single, lived alone, worked from 9am to 6pm every day a part from Sundays, and every night he would have a cigarette before popping in a microwave meal.
Looking around while perched on the side of the building, Harry located the small group over to the right. His eyes widen as he saw all of the lift in to the air on their broomsticks and speedily start to head towards the building, weaving and ducking around each other. Keeping his cool, yet knowing he needed to act fast, Harry pushed off the wall and swung his whole body to the left. He watched as the window got further away before it rapidly came back towards him. Pointing his feet and inclining his body slightly to be more vertical, Harry let go of the rope while at the same time jerking his body forwards.
“W-Well I was told to come talk to you, to get to know you. Since, you know, you don’t really know any of us. It would be good to have at least one friend your own age while you are here, right?” blushed Ron, embarrassed from the situation.
“I’m sure your spy within the inner circle of Voldemort’s Death Eaters has told you if Sirius Black is or ever has been a Death Eater,” he smirked.
Smiling kindly and nodding at Nymphadora, Remus quickly grabbed the bag of candy from the table and hastily made his way up the stairs. His heart pounded as he approached the door. This would be the first time interacting with Harry one-on-one. Lifting his hand, his knuckles hovered above the wood as he tried to gain the courage for the upcoming encounter. A deep breath in, Remus knocked lightly on the door before fidgeting with his hands as he waited.
“Little brat,” he laughed as he ruffled the messy mop of hair. “I’ll have my mirror with me for the next few days. Just call me through that if you need anything at all.”
Remus Lupin had his hand raised and looked around nervously as the room’s attention was drawn to him. The man looked eerily thin in his over-sized, brown trench coat. His light brown hair had flecks of grey throughout it, a sign that all of his stressful transformations had a toll on him. He looked older from all of the premature lines and scars that littered his face. Remus’s green eyes sheepishly looked over at Harry Potter, green staring at green. The older man shocked at how similar the boy’s eyes were to his mothers.
“Perfect,” he nodded, sitting forward in his chair and clasping his hands together on top the desk. “For the duration between now and the start of the school year, Harry will be staying at the Burrow as the Weasley’s have graciously offered a room for him. However, I require some of you to help train and educate him throughout the month. We’ll discuss this a little later.”
again, Harry swore as he looked all around him for an exit. The only possible one was blocked by Lucius at this current time. Harry tried to throw two different stunning spells at the same time, one from his wand and one from his hand. The older deflected one and ducked out of the way of the other. Before things could get anymore out of hand, Harry needed to get out of there first.
Turning his attention to his clothes, he considered what he would actually need. He wondered if he should take only a few outfits to save the limited space. Not only that, but he didn’t need to take much considering he would be getting an entire new wardrobe from Madam Malkin’s Robes as part of his birthday gift. Keeping this in mind, he grabbed all of his pairs of underwear and socks, followed by two pairs of sweat pants, two plain black shorts, five plain black and white, short sleeved shirts, and finally four of his black, leather cloaks. That should get him through until he gets the chance to make a trip to Madam Malkin’s.
“I know,” he sighed. “He has already demanded that I take my O.W.L.s before I go to Hogwarts. He’s made a schedule that includes several people teaching me certain subjects for the exam. Not that I need the help, as you already know. It’s wasting their time honestly. And mine. Let alone the teaching is taking place here at the Weasley’s residence or at Hogwarts.”
Icy blue eyes locked on the figure that sat in the Headmaster’s usual seat. Dumbledore knew he had many wands pointed at the stranger, so he merely stepped forwards in front of group with no wand drawn. He tried to study the young man, but could not figure out who he was or why he was here in his office. Let alone how he got in to the most secure place in the area.
“As Headmaster Dumbledore mentioned, it has been a long day for him. I must assume it has been for you too. I bid you both a good night and I’ll see you both again at the Order meeting tomorrow morning,” he said, nodding respectfully towards them both before turning back towards the Headmaster.
“I’m afraid of my feelings towards Malfoy. He obviously seems to care for me and I’ve noticed the way he looks at me. Now I’m not sure if that’s because he knows about all of the abuse and what I do to myself or if it’s because he actually has the same type of feelings for me,” Harry sobbed into his hands.
’ him, were inadvertently responsible for all of the horrible things he endured as a child. Oh how desperate and dark his mind was as he sat there imagining all of the things he could do.
“We should go strengthen the wards,” said Alastor Moody, his fake eye whirling around in his head. “Before the news breaks.”
“I’m too tired for this shit, Malfoy,” sighed Harry, watching Malfoy carefully. “Just say your piece and then kindly piss off.”
“Wait, how do you know I am a werewolf?” he asked with shock. “I have hardly told anyone that information.”
Harry stepped back and started closing the door before a hand stopped it for the second time that day. Restraining himself from the rage building up inside, he swore he wouldn’t be able to contain it if Hermione had yet again blocked his door from closing. Slowly opening it back up again, he glared daggers at Bill Weasley who had been the culprit.
Kingsley Shacklebolt looked around the quiet room, observing the dejected crowd. While he did feel annoyed and disappointed the outing had not gone to plan, he needed to sober up and focus on the future. The entire point of going out to Diagon Alley was to retrieve all of the necessary items for Harry to begin studying for his O.W.L.s and for him starting at Hogwarts in a months’ time. And unfortunately they had only managed to go to four stores before their cover was blown at the fifth. There was still so much to be done.
“This is going to be way harder than I imagined,” Harry huffed, covering his eyes with his arm. “He is infuriating. One of the most manipulative fools I’ve ever met. He expects me to just fall in line like the rest, to not question his words. But boy oh boy, did I show Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall some good childhood memories. Professor McGonagall immediately questioned how Dumbledore allowed that to happen. I could tell he hated me with a passion in that moment. He didn’t even bother responding to her, instead tried to integrate me on my whereabouts.”
Minerva felt her stomach drop at those words. Her eyes begun to water and her breath taken away. How could someone say such a thing to a child? Your own flesh and blood? Her mind was numb, fighting to just get through this experience without losing the contents of her stomach. She looked over to Severus, knowing how hard this must have been for the man. Seeing his childhood friend’s child being degraded and abused. She knew the man would immediately put aside his prejudice for Lily, anything for his Lily. Watching the normally expressionless face, Minerva saw the hurt in his eyes and the anger that contorted his eyebrows.
The three adults remained silent as they thought over the situation. Molly was worried what potential consequences her youngest son could have caused for not only Harry, but for the entire family. She paused in her cooking as the urgency sunk in. Walking into the foyer, she grabbed out some parchment, an ink pot and a quill. Placing them in front of Nymphadora, her face was almost pale except for a small red tint on her cheeks.
Harry Potter sat perched on the rooftop directing across from his disgusting family’s house. He was hidden from their view by the chimney, never once being caught in all of the years he had spied on them. Even after all this time, anger and resentment heavily weighed on him as he watched them from afar. Harry had studied their routine for years. But never had he carried out any sort of revenge like he would desperately hope for when he was younger.
“I used a stupefy on Petunia and gave her a deep cut on the arm. No wards changed,” he continued on. “It is safe to say you can cause as much harm to them as you would like while they’re unconscious.”
Steven stared up at the stranger in bewilderment. The voice sounded so young, yet very menacing. The darkness that seeped off of him was clearly a well-built aura, formed over many years. It made him shiver just thinking of all the other heinous crimes he might have committed while still being so young. He seemed so comfortable and confident in what he was doing, eerily so. Every move he made was precise, almost as if he had planned out every moment in a detailed plan.
The second the door was closed, Harry let his guard down slightly. He let the smile drop to be replaced by a tired look. Rolling his head in a circular motion, he wandlessly erected a silencing charm upon the room as well as locking the door for the night. He felt he could at least relax a little easier knowing his charms would hold. Well, except for if Bill Weasley tried to enter. Having no doubt the eldest child would easily get in with his extensive knowledge as a Curse-Breaker.
As the minutes ticked on, the room begun filling out. Order members hastily made their way to the office by various methods, some clearly annoyed by the early morning meeting. No one approached him, even when the whispers begun to circle around the people in attendance. As Harry looked around the room, he noticed the only people missing now were the members from the Weasley family. They didn’t have to wait much longer as the family frantically walked in to the room, eyes wide with panic.
“Ah yes, my dear Minerva,” he hummed before taking another sip. “Since you are not needed, you may leave. You too Nymphadora.”
Sighing heavily, Drew studied the face in front of him. Darkness surrounded the now blank facial features. He could tell that the younger one felt ashamed in his error. And while he too was shocked at the slip, he could partially understand why he would do what he did. Harry could be very antagonistic, as he learnt over the years. He fought for the right, he fought for the fair. So dealing with Dumbledore so often would be getting to him, more than he was probably comfortable with. Drew just knew he needed to take control of this situation before it got too out of his hands to fix.
He then descended along Harry's chest, kissing the finely drawn muscles, nibbling in places and licking at others. He inserted his tongue into the navel, miming the act, which caused a delicious whine from Harry. The blond went down even more. He found himself finally facing Harry's erection. He blew softly and he heard Harry begging him. He then placed small kisses all the way along Harry's cock. Harry begged louder. Draco then licked Harry's erection up and down and sucked on the cock as if it were a delicious treat. Harry gave an indecent moan and Draco took it all in his mouth at once.
“Okay” So they went to sit down, Harry took his place again and the blonde settled between him and Ginny. Harry resumed his breakfast in silence, having uttered far too much word for the moment to his liking. Malfoy, meanwhile, took a simple crescent that he pecked slowly watching Emett carefully, sitting in front of him. His three friends had finally joined, Pansy had sat next to him and Blaise and Theo were in front of him. Nobody spoke, too immersed in their incoherent thoughts. Finally, the ringing sounded, announcing the first classes of the day. Dumbledore announced that the children would attend their normal classes, thus finding themselves in the same class as their parents if they were in the same house and the same year. This only happened for Draco and Lyra. Dumbledore charged some elves with watching the little ones. So they all got up and went to their classrooms. Harry and the rest of the Gryffindors had history of magic for the next four hours. He settled next to Hermione. Harry started to have a headache only thirty minutes after the start of the class. Vertigo added to this an hour later.
“Are you OK?” Harry nodded, still trying to catch his breath. Draco appeared in front of them the next second as Harry began to cough.
“Who are you talking about?” That is, four of their children had green eyes. Draco understood who Sirius was talking about.
“Daddy and Dad aren’t going to punch each other, eh Lyra?” The girl turned her head towards her little brother and assured him that she didn’t think that was going to happen, but she did not seem very sure of herself.
“Aunty, you're the smartest person we all know here” Jordan was now in front of Hermione and grabbed her shoulders with both hands. They looked into each other's eyes and Hermione felt herself blush under the piercing blue gaze of the brunette facing her.
“Yo, Luce!” Everything’s fine?” Dimitri asked as he passed Lucius. Harry thought all the people's eyes in the hall were wide. Harry removed the dishes that were in front of Lucius, Narcissa, Sirius, Remus and Severus to sit on the table.
“I put my hand on the wall just now and a wave of magic expelled me all over the living room into the farthest wall, so that's what happened”  Draco looked like he calmed down a little.
“Well!” Draco exclaimed, a look of delight on his face. He cast a spell that bound the girl and he then dragged Harry by the hand to their room.
“By the way, your sweetheart didn’t look like he was fine at home, he didn’t stop asking us if we thought you were fine” Dimitri smiled at his words. Severus cleared his throat. But at that moment, the door opened again, letting in Alarik.
“Is there someone?” A female voice asked. Harry straightened up to open when he remembered he was only wearing a boxer. He put on some jeans and placed the sheet correctly on the blonde who had fallen asleep. He then opened and found himself facing a little brunette girl. He then looked down at her and when he saw her gray eyes, he knew who she was.
He couldn’t go back here. Not when everyone was seeing him as a big bad Death Eater. Especially not when Potter would be here, smiling at everyone and blushing under all the stares like he hadn’t saved the fucking world. Not when Potter would smile at everyone but him.
“We're going to eat! You coming?” Ezekiel shouted, drumming against the door. The noise woke Draco with a start, he grumbled and buried his head in Harry's hair. Harry turned in the blond's arms and kissed his lips. He quickly passed over him but they were interrupted when the two doors opened wide.
Harry was leaning against the counter, quietly drinking his coffee while Draco was leaning against the wall, also drinking coffee while staring at the window. Their eyes met, and it was at that moment that Harry knew something was going to go wrong. They then rushed towards each other and pressed their lips against each other. Harry had previously put his cup a little further on the worktop so he could put one of his hands on the neck of the blonde while the other was on his ass. The brunet moaned as Draco bit his lower lip. The blonde then grabbed Harry under the thighs and made him sit on the worktop. Harry wrapped his legs around his waist.
As the wind raged around him, he heard the children screaming that they were forfeiting, still on the ground. Happy with his little demonstration, he left in the direction of the castle to tell the teachers that he wanted to go get the locket the next day. He arrived quickly in front of the gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore's office. He forced the gargoyle to rotate with his magic and climbed the steps two by two. He entered the office without even knocking.
“Can you go get me Zephir please?” He asked, beating his lashes excessively. Dimitri rolled his eyes and went to upstairs. When he disappeared at the top of the stairs, a shout sounded in the direction of the library. Absolutely everyone in the room raised their heads. Harry rose from his chair and slowly approached the library.
“Okay, come here” Harry said as he knelt down. He took the boy in his arms and ran upstairs. Alya and Ezekiel were waiting for him at the top of the stairs. They widened their eyes when they saw Lesath.
“All right, but let's go at least sleep somewhere else” Jordan nodded and they went up to their room.
“There you have Lyra, Erin, Nathaniel and Ezekiel, Emett and Lesath. Here it's Zachady, Jordan ...”She was cut by Lyra.
“Yes, that's what he means Draco. And then comes the moment when I really don’t understand anything. Lyra and Jordan arrived and acted as if it was perfectly normal and usual for them. They asked me to take you to the room and your two blond twins came carrying Harry who was as pale as you. I wanted to lie you down in your bed but they forced me to lie you down with Potter. They undressed you and made sure you got in touch and you immediately took colors” Harry and Draco were staring at him, looking amazed, not understanding the situation.
“It's your gift” Harry said simply. He then returned his hand and opened it, palm to the sky. Draco's eyes widened as he saw what was in Harry's hand. There was a snitch in the palm of his hand, the one they’d caught together a few days earlier. The little golden ball spread its silver wings and flew to Draco. Harry gave him a look and the blonde grabbed the snitch that opened. Draco's mouth opened wide as he saw it open and he widened his eyes as he saw what was inside. He grasped the object between his fingers and let the chain that accompanied him hang in the air as he watched the object with undisguised emotion. It was a diamond-shaped medallion. The interior of the diamond was hollow and only the letters H and D intermingled filled this void. The jewel was silver.
“They communicate by thought” Emett explained to him as if it was perfectly normal, which was ultimately the case for him. Sirius wasn’t understanding anything, seeing his face.
“I... yes everything’s fine” Harry tried to reassure him by offering a smile. Draco was not fooled but feeling that he would probably faint in a few minutes, he undressed under Harry's greedy eye. He slipped into the bathtub and he slid between Harry's legs.
“That's not what you think, Molly” Harry started, and then he noticed his T-shirt on the floor, out of the kitchen, the blond's open shirt, his legs around the same blond's waist , his hands in blond hair, Draco's hand on his ass and the other hand in his neck. “Well, maybe that's exactly what you think” He corrected.
“Just before I fainted, I heard Nathaniel say that they knew it was going to happen” Draco looked at him sharply.
“Are we going to eat soon, Daddy?” The boy asked in his high-pitched voice. Harry smiled at him and stroked his hair.
In fact there were several. First, adults who were on the trip had clearly told them that Molly was only aware that children of the future were present but their parents had not been specified. They had also insisted that the truth should be told delicately. And Harry felt it was going to be hard and he didn’t have the time or the urge to pretend.
“Then Nath and Jordan will watch the stairs to make sure no one ever goes up. Daddy and Dad will be up there a while. Al and Joris will try to isolate Blaise and Ron in hope that it will bring them closer. Ezekiel said.
A movement on his chest brought him back to the present and he heard Draco mumble something in a sleepy voice.
“You sure Dad’s not mad at me?” Emett asked, raising his head to meet Harry’s eyes. He saw that the kid was really upset and worried.
“You should go eat your last peach jam sandwich before your coffee gets colder.” Harry raised a surprised eyebrow that Malfoy did not see as he had his head down. The brunet shrugged his shoulders.
“We're not stealing anyone, Ron” Blaise, who was standing in the doorway, interjected. The redhead then rushed on Theo who narrowly avoided him. Blaise grabbed him and went out holding Ron against him. The door closed slowly and Theo turned to Hermione, who had red cheeks.
“Would that mean that Harry and Malfoy would be your two parents?” The youngest looked at her jadedly, which seemed to mean 'it's obvious' while Harry, Ron and the Slytherins stared at her as if she had gone completely crazy. The children did not try to deny, the truth being too obvious. Ron blanched as he opened his mouth and closed it again and again. Harry was deep in silence, trying to digest the situation. Hermione and Zabini looked at each other knowingly, not looking particularly surprised. Malfoy was struggling to keep his face blank, even if Blaise could see his eyes sparkle for a moment. Hermione suddenly cleared her throat, ending that particularly embarrassing moment.
“I can’t believe it” He said. She didn’t really know how it happened. The night they had learned that they had children together, Theo and her had just discussed a lot. They had discovered they had things in common, including literature, but also that they liked to watch the stars when they couldn’t sleep and that they liked to talk for hours together each in their bed until one of them falls asleep. They had researched together for Harry and it had brought them closer. She couldn’t tell if she was in love with Theo but she was close to it. Ron had apparently screamed but she had not paid attention, too lost in thought.
“Dad? I have something to tell you” Harry shot a relieved look at him. He knew perfectly well that the child had nothing to say to him.
Harry stared at the medallion in front of him on the table. He jumped when the door of the apartment burst open in a crash on a crying red-haired girl who was pushed hardly into the room. Joris then entered, looking more angry than ever. He pulled the girl up that Harry recognized as Ginny and Pansy’s daughter.
"I'll kiss him right now" Harry heard in his head. It was Draco's voice so Harry figured it was probably their psychic bond coming up.
“All right, so you didn’t explain everything, but we know a good part of it” Harry nodded while the blond behind him was playing with his hair.
“He’s not here. We don’t know why we‘re here, or how we got here, and he’s not here!” He got angry over these last words, seeming to be slightly irritated. Nathaniel wrapped his arm around the younger boy's shoulders and pulled him against him.
“Oh” Was Harry's only answer. He was very hopeful that the red would calm down in the days and weeks to come.
Harry gave him a bright smile. He saw in Hermione's eyes that she knew exactly what the boys were talking about, Ron had probably complained to her. He smiled at them and saw Draco behind them, sitting on the edge of a window. He apologized to his friends and went to the blond. He settled between his legs and caressed distractingly the inside of his thighs.
“You should shut your mouth Potter, you could swallow something” Harry glared at him and the blonde's laugh redoubled. This little incident made Harry and the others forget what the blonde girl had announced.
Lyra was heard struggling violently but he silenced her quickly. It was about time that Draco realized that Harry only had pants on him. He pushed the door with his fingertips and pushed Harry harshly against it as soon as it closed. He first kissed him softly and Harry took advantage of the situation, biting the blond a little too violently against the door. Draco saw the teasing gleam in Harry's eyes. Harry placed his lips on the blonde's and quickly he slid his tongue against his twin. The kiss quickly grew louder than it did at first, and Harry forced himself to stop as he was about to remove Draco's sweater. The latter groaned with discontent.
“Aunty Pansy? Do you know why I haven’t seen Dad yet?” The girl turned her head to Erika who looked at her with bright eyes. “I want to see my dads” The little girl snorted, ready to burst into tears.
“That's Zach!” They said with one voice. After finally pushing the couple off the passage, a big black guy entered the room, accompanied by a blonde girl and a brunette girl. The brunette ran to join Ezekiel and kissed him while the blonde hugged Nathaniel affectionately in her arms.
“What are you doing Ry?” He asked him. Harry slowly turned to him and Draco immediately knew something was wrong when he saw the paleness of Harry's face.
“Sit up, please” She said as she forced Draco to sit on his own bed. “I will tell how we see that he loves you” He nodded and looked at her with wide eyes, listening with great attention. Blaise stood up beside Pansy as she hardly tried to make a list in her head of the proof that Potter loved Draco.
“It turns out he's not as stupid as we thought and I don’t know, his touch electrifies me. My heartbeat is accelerating when he's near me and I feel that urge to hug and kiss him absolutely all the time” Draco sliced his face down and looked slightly lost now. His friend had a tender, amused smile at the same time.
They had met Umbridge as soon as they arrived in the elevator. Lucius had started an insignificant discussion with her, which had led them right into her office. Thanks to his new powers, Harry had opened each drawer as silently as possible and could quickly understand that the necklace could only be found around the woman's neck. Zephir and Harry used their magic to lift the cloaks into one. The triplets could then join their hands and a perfect replica of the medallion was formed before them, still under the capes. Harry stared admiringly at the details of the locket forming little by little before his eyes. Once the medallion was fully formed, Zephir floated it to the woman in pink. Harry then went into action by detaching the Horcrux from her neck. They all sighed with relief when the two medallions were exchanged.
“Yes, thank you” Harry replied blushing, thinking back to the fact that it was only because he spent the night in Malfoy's arms.
“What has happened to you ?” He asked eagerly, beginning to look for any wound on his boyfriend's body.
Lyra was rather tall, had long blonde almost white hair. Her hair were perfectly smooth and it came to her waist. Her eyes were the same green as Harry, Emett and Nathaniel’s. He then looked at Nathaniel's brother, Ezekiel, and he noticed that he looked exactly like his brother, except for his hair that was a little longer, reaching him at the base of the skull. Harry finally looked at the smaller one, his hair was blond and his eyes were closed, but even so, he knew they were the exact color of Malfoy's. He frowned at this thought, how was it that he knew the exact color of Malfoy's eyes? A metallic gray that could look as warm as it could be iced. A gray in which Harry could immerse himself for hours without ever getting bored or tired. He shook his head to get those thoughts out of his mind. He finally smiled, already loving the five children in front of him. Harry continued his observation of the children and studied his best friend's children. He frowned, this situation was really strange. He did not detail Jordan, whom he had already observed earlier in the day. He looked at his two sisters. The two girls looked a lot alike and Harry thought they were probably twins. They had long red hair but their eyes were different, one had blue eyes and the other had brown eyes. Alarik and Erika had black hair, as well as their eyes. And Seth looked metamorphic, from what Harry saw. The boy was brown and had brown eyes when Harry had met him, but now his hair pulled on the chestnut with very blond locks and his eyes were blue. Harry thought of this member of the order, Tonks, he knew that she liked Remus a lot. Maybe the latter had arrived at his ends with the auror. Harry let his gaze wander after finishing his observation.
Harry ran his hands under the gray shirt and lovingly flattered Draco's pale ribs. Draco stuck his teeth into his lower lip to restrain his moan. Harry returned to take possession of Draco's lips while starting to undo the buttons of his shirt. Once that was done, the blonde removed it and removed Harry's. Draco sat up, Harry still on his lap. They were still kissing each other and Harry chuckled as the photo album fell to the floor in a thump. The blonde brought his hands up Harry's thighs to his buttocks and it was there that he felt it, a small ball in the back pocket of Harry's pants.
The two women didn’t need to be told twice as they disappeared out of the house within seconds. Severus and Dumbledore stayed in the kitchen in silence, both consumed by their own thoughts. The remained there like that until the three red heads walked in. Arthur came to stand next to Dumbledore, while the twins awkwardly stood near the door way.
Harry took a deep breath before he finally opened his door and started descending down the stairs slowly. With each step, his heart beat increased as did his anxiety heighten. He reached the bottom step and turned to face the lounge room and kitchen that were full of familiar faces. His eyes roamed the room, unconsciously still on alert for any dangers. He stood there as his presence went undetected for the moment. The room was decorated with party strings, banners with words, balloons pumped with helium floating on the ceiling.
“We were so worried about you. Don’t you dare do that again, young man,” scolded Molly, as if Harry was one of her own children. “Not after you only just got here.”
A few floors above, Lyra entered a similar room. She found Nathaniel, Jordan, Zachady, Eleanor, and Erin.
“But with the war and all that's going on, it's not the right time” Harry turned so that he was on the blond.
“Put on a T-shirt” He ordered. The brunette rolled his eyes but did so. The children laughed and Erin glanced at them in a way that Harry didn’t understand but that everyone else understood as a warning about the secret of their fathers' relationship. Dimitri moved quickly towards them and embraced them each.
“Good”, the brunette’s response rumbling in his throat, moving to kiss Draco. His hands sliding underneath his shirt and up his spine. The blond fluttered his eyes shut in pleasure, but he still felt pain in his heart. ‘I shouldn’t be doing this’, he thought. Truth be told, he loved Harry so much but to his knowledge the other man only views him as a sex-partner.
“Like what? I’m just walking to our room” Draco said without even looking at him. Harry just sighed and concentrated on Emett instead.
“Ezé! Shut up” The blond girl, who had already intervened several times during the day, reprimanded. Dumbledore looked at her and continued.
“Harry? I... I'd like to... apologize for my behavior... well, I mean, I acted like a jerk, especially since I already knew you were in love with Malfoy. And it was really silly not to talk to you all about all this, especially since these kids are really great” Harry smiled during his friend's short monologue and then stood up and hugged his friend. Ron hugged him back and then got up and went to the bathroom. Once his friend had disappeared, Harry got up and walked as quietly as he could to the room opposite his.
“Wait, he's going to attack the castle!?” Harry exclaimed. The eight children gave him a meaningful look. He moaned and let his head fall against Draco's shoulder.
“But I want to stay with you too, daddy” A tear ran down his cheek and Harry couldn’t resist the tearful look of the little blond.
“The others want you downstairs” They both nodded and Harry went to pick him up before taking Draco’s hand. They went down like that, hand in hand with Harry holding Lesath.
“Hi, it’s nice to see you Pansy” He heard her say in the corridor. He groaned again in frustration as he looked at Blaise in exasperation.
“We can’t do this now” Alya announced. Everyone had been made aware of the situation and they were gathered in the living room to talk about Harry’s possible future death.
Draco anxiously stared at the front door of the apartments while sipping his mixture of pumpkin juice and anti-pain potion for his back. To tell the truth, no one inside was in a better state. Jordan was screaming at just about everyone. Lyra and Erin were biting their nails a little discreetly. Emett was clinging unconsciously to Draco, looking for comfort. Ascella stood between her two big sisters. Lesath didn’t seem to be aware of anything, although he clearly felt the concern in the room. Eleanor read a book a little too slowly to look realistic. As for the other people in the room, they were equally worried. While the atmosphere was more than heavy and palpable as ever, a group of six people appeared on the ground in a pop sound, making everyone jump. Draco frowned as he saw that there was only one blond, or rather a blonde. Lyra and Erin had horrified looks.
“And, uh, we have a question?” Lyra, the official spokesperson for the small group, asked the adults. Severus shot her a look that told him to continue.  “Would it be possible for you to leave us alone for the new year?” She finally asked in one go. Molly firmly opposed it, but Sirius, who still had his adolescent soul, took up their defense.
“We should help them” Harry said. Draco didn’t answer but let himself be dragged to the floor below. Harry dropped his hand a little before arriving downstairs.
Several days had passed and Harry was spending all his free time staring at the locket. Draco sighed once more next to him.
“And when we come back, you'll tell me what's going on with your back” The blonde wanted to protest but he saw in Harry's determined look that he had no choice.
“Children, you're all up there!” She cried, pointing to the stairs with her hand. “And we're looking for Harry and maybe other people” Pansy, Ginny, Ron, Blaise, Theo and Hermione rushed to search. Draco got up with a grimace. He followed his instinct and walked in a random direction, then he jumped when he saw a hand on the ground. He knelt down close to the body and removed the woody debris from Harry's back, since it was him. Draco cursed himself when he saw that his hands were shaking. He slowly turned his companion's body and sighed slightly, seeing only a few scratches. He put his hands on Harry's face and immediately, the pain he felt disappeared and Harry's eyes opened with difficulty. He coughed and moaned softly.
“Are you OK?” He stepped over Draco's legs and knelt down in front of him. He put his hands on Draco's cheeks as he opened his eyes. Harry saw the silver eyes roll back and the blond lost consciousness.
“It's more up to you to tell me” Draco pulled his hand up against the skin of Harry's neck and sighed in relief, feeling the pain subsidy.
“Well, I suggest that we all go upstairs and unpack our bags and come back and talk over here” Lyra, who had taken the lead once more, said. Ron disappeared into the kitchen, still not wishing to join the group. Harry, Draco, Blaise and Theo went upstairs. Harry was forced to take the room where he was already staying with Ron while the three boys settled in the room opposite. Harry dropped his suitcase at the foot of one of the beds and dropped to the bed, his face against the mattress.
“Why are you making this face?” Jordan asked Nathaniel. They were facing each other, still lying on the kitchen floor under the table.
“Don’t worry, it'll be fine” Harry gave him a skeptical look. Knowing Molly, she was going to watch them very carefully and they were going to faint because they couldn’t touch each other.
He nibbled the thin skin lightly and Harry groaned again. Draco smiled in his neck, his moans were really exciting. He then passed his tongue over Harry’s earlobe and the moan that escaped his mouth was louder. The blonde then dropped his hand down Harry's body and stroked his cock through the fabric of his boxer. The brunette suddenly arched with an indecent moan. Draco shuddered and felt his erection hardening even more.
“Ok, but what are these observations?” Nathaniel, who was more than fed up with it to get answers, finally asked.
“Come home with me?” Harry asked, looking up hopefully at Draco. “I’ll make it up to you, I promise”
This long day ahead started badly for Harry. To be caught watching his enemy wasn’t what he’d call a good start to the day. He blew a good blow and got out of bed. He walked, a step too fast to look natural, to the bathroom. He closed the door a little brutally and leaned against it. He sighed, closing his eyes, his head leaning against the dark wood behind him. This situation couldn’t last, if he had to live with Malfoy then he wouldn’t do it in this heavy and hateful atmosphere. On this new good resolution, he opened his eyes and went in the shower. When he came out of the bathroom, his eyes fell immediately on Malfoy's back. The latter was standing in front of a cupboard filled with more classy clothes than the others. He was not wearing his towel but a black boxer. Harry couldn’t stop his gaze from coming off the blonde's back and down his body. Harry blushed furiously as his eyes fell on Malfoy's ass. He quickly looked away and went to his closet too.
“I'll give him back to you” Nathaniel laughed and Lyra closed the door gently, leaving Jordan and Zach planted in the hallway. The black finally went to bed, leaving his brother alone in front of all these closed doors.
“What did you do to my sister?” Joris repeated, crushing the girl again against the stone wall. Nathaniel, Jordan and Alarik arrived at that moment completely breathless. She winced in pain and tears of terror ran down her cheeks, but she kept her mouth shut tight and gave the blonde a look of pure challenge.
“I am pregnant!” She exclaimed before bursting into tears. Harry's eyes widened before he squeezed the brunette against him. Looking up, Harry saw the three Slytherins caught in a hug. He then began to smile. Their joy, however, was short-lived. Erin ran from the outside of the apartment and stopped breathless in front of Draco.
“When you touch each other, you can feel the emotions of the other” Harry leaned closer to her and whispered.
“We just touched the wall, we swear” Emett said, his big green eyes on his blond father. Harry put his hand on Draco's arm in the hope of calming him down.
“Hmm... Yeah, not really, sorry” He apologized under the cold glare his sister gave him. Zephir burst out laughing.
Draco was pulled out of his thoughts at the feel of his trousers sliding down his legs while Potter brushed his lips against his dick. Draco couldn’t help but moan in anticipation of what was to come.
“I mean that I met Dad's father and he seemed angry to find him nowhere” Harry swallowed loudly and offered a tense smile to the girl.
“What do you mean?” Harry who didn’t understand asked, he was too busy not to moan to think about it.
“Ezekiel!” Draco shouted. The young man looked up from his book and looked at both his parents from the couch where he was sitting. He lifted his girlfriend's head off his lap and exited the fluffy sofa.
So he convinced himself that Harry can shag him again, if only for the reason that he fucks him so well. Maybe it was just sex for Harry, great sex at that, so who is Draco to say no to a good fucking with the Boy-Who-Lived.
“Uncle Fred and Uncle George told us. It seems that Daddy was in a rage, no one had ever seen him so upset and it seems he was really scary. And yet when one of us does something wrong, and he gets upset, I can assure you that it's really scary” Draco did not ask more questions about this topic, he might observe it soon with his own eyes anyway.
Harry was executing a Wronski feint, Draco, Blaise, Ron, and Theo at his pursuit. Sirius, Lucius, Remus and Severus watched from the ground. They were at Malfoy Manor and had been questioned by Harry when he knew it.
There was a picture of him as a child, surrounded by his parents, Sirius and Remus. On the following pages he found pictures of his parents, Sirius, Remus, himself. Then he was surrounded by Ron and Hermione at age 11, others of his Gryffindor friends. He saw himself on a broom, playing Quidditch. Other photographs of the same kind followed, although he was older. Then came the year of his sixteenth birthday. There was a picture of him alone, then of him with Hermione and Ron.
“Hey! But I was reading” Blaise shouted, still leaning against the couch. He then looked back at Harry and Draco, making fun of him. He sat down on the couch too, seeing that the coming conversation seemed exciting. Harry leaned over to Blaise.
“No, he didn’t accept but we are in the same dormitory so maybe I happen to watch him sleep from time to time, but rarely”
“There are far too many unclear things in this story” Draco interjected. The others could only agree with that. Suddenly, the door opened, revealing a tall blue-eyed blonde Harry had never seen.
“I thought about it too, and I concluded that we could talk to them about it and that this time they could defeat Voldemort more quickly because they won’t be just three and we, the children, know what objects are hidden pieces of souls” Nathaniel pressed his lips to his and gave him a huge smile.
“All I know is that Draco felt bad all morning and that he fainted and I just caught him before he could into the middle of a corridor” Harry turned his head to the blond.
“Do you think this secret story still holds?” He asked, glancing at the stands, where everyone seemed to be staring at them, waiting impatiently for what would happen next.
“Why do you look about to faint?” Alya asked Draco. She was perfectly right, since at the moment he was going to answer that he didn’t feel very well, he fainted. The two boys rushed at him and put him on the bed next to Harry. Nathaniel rushed to the floor below to pick up the other family members.
Then he frowned as he felt Harry loosen his arms. He pushed him away from him again and saw Harry barely conscious in front of him. He worried immediately. The brunette then coughed hard and blood came out of his mouth. Draco's eyes widened in horror and he swung like an arrow to the ground. He laid Harry in the sand and immediately the white sand was tinged with an alarming red. Cries of horror rose from the crowd as five people screamed “Daddy!” in panic. Draco was just as panicked and it worsened when he saw the source of the problem: the end of Harry's broom handle was deep in his stomach. Harry choked again and he spat blood again. Draco's hands began to shake violently and tears began to flow from his eyes.
“It's because of the lemon candy” Her mouth then formed a perfect "O". Draco reassured them all with a smile and went upstairs. He laid Harry on the bed and took off his clothes, leaving him only in his underwear. He folded the covers over him and watched him for a few seconds. He was really beautiful.
"I agree with myself on this point" Draco stated. Harry blushed adorably and Molly cleared his throat, wishing to sit down at the table. They sat down and the meal began in silence until one of the children broke it.
“Um ... yes, sort of, but Draco saved me, don’t worry” Molly frowned as she heard that, since when were the two boys calling each other by their first names?
“I know you don’t want to do that” Pansy continued, a gentle but sad smile on her lips. “But it’s the best, ok?” Draco sighed a bit dramatically as she finished her sentence, her hand on his arm. Blaise nodded besides her.
Harry was sitting next to a blushing Draco in the Great Hall. Harry felt terribly embarrassed though thinking about it, it didn’t come from him.
"Why?” Draco then blushed, too, and he just shrugged. Harry then saw a black arm curl around his shoulders in front of him as a female arm wrapped around his own shoulders. Harry turned his head to the origin of this arm and found himself facing Pansy Parkinson. He took a step back but she held him back.
“Listen, you are just going to ignore each other the entire year and then never see each other again” She then stated with a smile, like she just resolved the entire problem.
“Of course” They replied at the same time. The little one climbed the bed and came to snuggle between them.
With a wave of his hand, he formed a large square with the tables while Draco made chairs appear with a movement of his hand as well. Eleanor sighed.
“It's kind of clever, if you forget that you've done wrong to the Malfoy-Potter family and sincerely, I don’t want to be in your place because of my kids' characters” Draco commented.
“I don’t know, I was walking quietly down the halls looking for an attack plan and then I found myself stuck in that damn room of secrets. Luckily I remembered a few parseltongue words that I heard your brother say in his sleep”
“Get out!” Draco shouted as he came back to flatten his lips against Harry's. The latter went down his legs until touching the ground again. He then reversed their positions and started sliding down the blonde's body. Blaise knocked again as Harry opened his mouth near Draco's erection.
Draco rolled his eyes when she blushed a bit. Blaise couldn’t help himself, he had to flirt with every women he came across even though he deeply in love with Theodore.
“Come on, let's talk to them right now! It's a great idea” He exclaimed, starting to get up. Jordan held him by the arm.
“See you in two days, right?” Blaise asked as they got up to go. He nodded to them before falling on his bed when they were gone.
“Where?” Harry exclaimed, stunned. He had his mouth wide open again and he heard Malfoy sneer in his corner.
“And you, do you need to be that fucking kind?” Blaise was stunned by this answer, not expecting it to be so aggressive.
“I can’t see anything now” Harry mumbled. Draco stared Harry in the eye and all he saw was the blur Harry was in. He then eagerly hoped to find a solution to his vision problem one day. And without him noticing, the tips of his fingers began to heat up on Harry's temples, who restrained himself from grimacing under the pain it caused in his skull. He closed his eyes all the same. Draco leaned over to kiss Harry, not suspecting what was going on in the least. He straightened up when Harry did not give him back his kiss.
“Do you want a little presentation of the future families?” Hermione asked. Both adults nodded. Small groups formed.
Jordan was also fine with his boyfriend and best friend. Dimitri and Joris were excellent beaters. He had not yet seen Erin in action but he was sure she was excellent. Then he suddenly spotted the snitch as it passed near Blaise. He rushed at him and grazed him very closely, so that Blaise nearly fell off his broom. The snitch suddenly went to the sky and, without thinking, Harry darted after him, Erin following him closely. And while he was on the verge of catching it, still skyrocketing, the little rain that fell on them turned into a storm. He paid no attention and continued his ascent.
“Harry! Stop!” Draco shouted behind his back. Harry almost did it to the agreement of his name in the blonde's mouth but he recovered and accelerated even more. Harry was really upset by this revelation and needed to think about it calmly. He did not need to say the password, the passage opening automatically when he arrived. Draco was not so lucky and found himself stuck in front of the stone wall, not remembering the password. He turned around and saw Nathaniel running towards him, Jordan and Ezekiel not far behind him. He did not bother to slow down and almost shouted the password. He almost hit the wall but Draco held him back as best he could. Draco began to get impatient with the slowness of opening the passage. A black aura with red reflections formed around him and the passage opened at once in the face of this powerful magic.
“These two have not gone to bed yet, it's amazing.” Malfoy sneered. Harry and Hermione laughed with him but were stopped when the door opened and shut in a loud crash. Ron was now in front of them, a murderous look in his face and Malfoy felt two arms curl around his leg.
“You really are gorgeous” Harry blushed under the compliment and stammered a ‘thank you’. Draco laughed slightly and then dragged Harry into the living room, where music was already ringing. He began to smile seeing his friends who were already having fun. He approached Hermione and Ron chatting in a corner.
“To facilitate your understanding, I must show you. If you please” He said to them, showing the door with his hand. Hermione, Ron and Zabini got up first and went down the stairs. The blond girl then got up and took the little blond boy in her arms, she also grabbed the second boy's hand. She walked out the door, the three little girls following her. The four boys who had knocked on the door of the potion class then got up with a laugh, followed by Emett. The only ones that were remaining in the office were Harry and Malfoy, accompanied by Dumbledore.
“So, what exactly do we do about that stupid wall?” Eleanor jumped down the table and Ezekiel took her place, standing on it.
The rumor of a friendly match between parents and children had spread like wildfire in Hogwarts as soon as Dean and Seamus were made aware of it. So almost all the castle was installed in the stands, even the teachers, while the players were on the pitch. Dimitri was waving at Severus with a smile that couldn’t be more insolent on his face. The five children, accompanied by Emett, stood beside Sirius and Remus in the teachers' box. Harry and Erin were flying above everyone else. Draco was standing with Theo between the chasers and Ron, the keeper. The blond, realizing that he had been isolated in recent days, decided to reconnect with one of his best friends.
“They are Alarik and his sister Erika and the youngest is Seth” She finished pointing to the little boy standing with her.
He knew it was the right choice when he saw the bright smile on Harry’s face.  Draco then apparated away to their flat, leaving Pansy alone on her doorstep.
“I don’t even want your explanation” He later tried to get out of the room but Draco did not want to stop there. As Harry walked away he followed him, explaining himself.
"Then for Gryffindor, Erin is the seeker, Zach's twin sister is the keeper, Seth's sister and one of Uncle Dean's and Uncle Seamus’s daughter are the beaters and Alarik’s twin sister, one of Uncle Ron and Uncle Blaise’s daughter and Pansy's daughter are the chasers.
“What’s the problem, Malfoy?” The blonde seemed to think for a few moments before opening his mouth.
“No, but you're communicating by thought in our day so I think it starts” Lyra replied. Draco nodded, looking totally shocked and lost.
“What?” He asked. That's when the three Malfoys came into the office and Draco burst out laughing under the surprised look of his parents, who were not used to seeing their son laugh that way.
They were crying with laughter when Ron, Blaise and their four children arrived. Ron and Blaise froze, astonished to see them like this. Harry leaned on Draco's shoulder, still shaking with laughter and Jordan leaned over to Lyra.
“I’ll send you a note, okay?” He asked as his put his shirt on. Harry nodded, still embarrassed and then Draco went out of the room, leaving Harry alone. He walked slowly to the dungeon, trying not to run to his friends because, GOD he needs to talk about Potter with them. Maybe he could tell them that Potter was acting a little more gently each day.
“Calm down. He's fine, you've heard it yourself. He's alive” It was not really conclusive, so seeing that the tears were intensifying and Harry was starting to spasm, Draco did the only thing that came to his mind. He pressed his mouth against Harry's, who widened his eyes before kissing him back. They parted and Harry wiped his tears, calmed.
“I don’t want to interrupt you guys, but I think it's time we live and quickly” Eleanor intervened suddenly, staring at Harry's T-shirt that had just landed at their feet. They all looked at each other and with a silent agreement they went out as quickly and silently as they could. They found themselves alone in the hallway.
“There are more of you than I thought” Sirius finally let out in a nervous laugh. Harry, Draco, Blaise and Theo went down at that moment. Harry and Draco each stood on one side of Ezekiel and Sirius opened his mouth wide.
He reconnected with reality when a hand slipped into his and fingers intertwined with his. He turned his head to Draco, who was smiling at him gently.
Harry smiled, letting out a tear and he hugged the one woman he considered like a mother against him.
Then all of a sudden he stopped when he met two gray eyes staring at him. When Harry looked down into Malfoy's eyes, Malfoy seemed to realize that the brunette had surprised him so he looked away, his cheeks flushing red. Hermione stood up next to him, forcing Harry to turn his attention back to her.
“You should eat instead of trying ate yourself so early in the morning and especially under Lesath's nose” With these words, he almost snatched Lesath from Harry's arms and went to sit down, followed by his two fathers. Hermione was livid.
“The five terrors take care of it, Ascella stands guard in the hallway and the little ones have asked the adults to play with them” She explained.
“You’re together, right?” Nathaniel's cheeks turned red while a smug smile played on Jordan's lips. Their eyes met and Harry drew his own conclusion as he did not expect any response from them. He glanced at Ron, who seemed to be split between shock and disgust. He also felt disgust, but towards his friend. Time passed slowly, Harry and Ron waiting patiently for the conversation to resume. Their long wait came to an end when the door swung open, letting in the boy who had shoved Harry into the hall. He went to them angrily and sat down without any delicacy beside Nathaniel. He huffed as he folded his arms across his chest and glared at what was in front of him, in this case, the armrest of the sofa where Harry and Ron were.
“Mmm,” disapprovingly shaking his head, Drew started walking inside. “Go to your room and start getting ready, little brat.”
Dudley stood up from the couch and walked directly to his father and cousin, ready to save him from the torture. Yet he didn’t get very far as a white light hurdled towards him and hit him square in the chest. His body seized up, everything becoming stiff. Then the next thing Dudley knew, he was on the floor, frozen in position. All he was able to do was stare helplessly at his father as Harry continued with the onslaught of torture. All he was able to do was let a few small tears fall from his eyes. That was all he could do in this very moment.
“You can’t seriously be expecting us to drop our spare time like that, now do you Albus?” Molly tutted at him in disapproval.
Dumbledore thought about what he was hearing and opened his mouth to respond. He knew this was coming. He saw the annoyance they tried to conceal the other night. He saw the looks of anger they tried to hide from him. It was only a matter of time and last night was the final straw.
Birds sung their morning song as the sun slowly begun to rise above the horizon. The wind blew a gentle breeze, taking leaves and dirt captive with it. The long grass surrounding the house danced in the wind, mesmerising any onlooker. Harry watched from the table in the kitchen, the sun beginning to swallow the tree line in the far distance. A sense of serenity settled over him while the information from early this morning sunk in. Suddenly a yellow envelope was slapped down on the table in front of him. Harry simply turned his head in reaction, seeing a smirking Drew standing next to him.
Harry wandered over to the hat, of course knowing exactly what it was, and placing his wand back in its holster on his forearm. He carefully picked up the delicate hat and placed it upon his head, instantly losing sight of the office as its large circumference swamped his head. Staring ahead into darkness, he waited for the quiet voice to speak. And he wasn’t disappointed as seconds later a whisper interrupted his thoughts. Knowing the magical hat uses Legilimency to communicate with its wearers.
Parker and Harry watched as Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and his friends all came outside and begun to search the area. Harry closed his eyes and removed his magical trace from the spot he had just apparated from. This took a lot of energy out of him, he rarely erases the magical trace from this far of a distance.
“Well, yeah I guess,” he shrugged. “I guess if I need to keep up some type of a façade then I need to show some type of social skills with the other students. Or am I wrong.”
Pulling on his fresh new underwear and pajama pants, Harry threw a weak glamour on to hide the scars on his chest, arms and neck, knowing that he would have to put a shirt on before the glamour wore off. Harry dried his hair with his towel as he walked out into his room, knowing and not hearing anyone come back to the dorms. His chest still dripped slightly from the water that escaped being dried away. Harry placed his dirty clothes away and sat on his bed.
Soon enough more members begun appearing via different methods. Some apparating, some flooing and some even simply walking up to the office if they were already at Hogwarts. The large, spacious room suddenly became cramped with each new arrival. They stood almost shoulder to shoulder in quiet, although a certain red headed family couldn’t grasp the understanding of quietness. All eyes were eagerly looking at Headmaster Dumbledore, the leader of the Order of the Phoenix, the only current person to defend them all from the Dark Lord.
“All my life, I would get beat for even looking at boys in any other way that wasn’t friendship. I almost died when I had my first boyfriend. My relatives almost killed me. Once I was finally able to move, I ran away and went to my boyfriend’s place. He wasn’t home, but his parents were. My relatives were arrested and I stayed with my boyfriend’s family from then on. Well, until my relatives were let off the hook and they took me away."
Harry curiously looked at his back and then down at the folder sitting before him. His inquisitive nature getting the better of him. Picking it up and tipping it upside-down, a pile of neat paper slid on to the table. The first page held a picture of the Requester's target plus all of their personal information. His eyes roamed the page briefly, catching different intriguing words, before he decided to start reading from the start. A picture of a middle aged man staring blankly ahead at the camera, dressed in a pristine police uniform. Medals and badges pinned on him, showing off his achievements.
“Preposterous,” Severus dismissed immediately. “The alarm would never trigger if it was caused by themselves.”
“Anyone can easily find this out,” he scoffed as he rolled his eyes, ready to end the lying brat and show the Order members present why he was in charge.
Alastor Moody followed behind the other Auror, shutting the front door behind him. The room was still for the first time in a while. Smiling fondly as she looked upon her children and her newest house guest, Molly thought about all the housework that needed to be done. Heading into the kitchen, she began clearing up the cups from the Order members before getting to work on the lunch that needed to feed all of the extra mouths. The group of siblings and Hermione looked at each other tiredly, the morning events taking a toll on many of them. None of them planned to do much for the rest of the day as they begun talking amongst themselves.
“Reparo,” whispered Harry, immediately turning around and walking further into the room knowing without a doubt his spell would resort the window to its full form.
“And I may need someone to take me home so I can grab all of my belongings for the summer and my Hogwarts supplies,” she continued as she thought about getting organised.
Majority of the members raised their hands in response. Severus, Minerva, Arthur, and Dodge were the only ones to not raise their hands. Icy blue eyes looked around the room, pleased that they could get the nerve wrecking expedition out of the way sooner rather than later. Hopefully each person stuck to their word about keeping Harry’s re-appearance in the wizarding world secret until a later point and not before this trip.
Taking a deep breath in, he brought his right hand up near his ear. His eyes focused on nothing but the target as he stilled himself. In a quick, yet smooth motion, Harry brought his hand back slightly before throwing the knife towards the target, his upper body twisting with the action. As the small blade wedged itself smack bang in the middle of the bullseye, he smiled brightly to himself. Relief coursing through him that he still had the skills after so many missed days of practice, he floated the knife back to him without moving a muscle.
Harry nodded before swiftly standing up. He left the room without another word and headed downstairs to his room. Closing his door, he conducted a quick check over himself and his weaponry to make sure nothing was out of place or damaged. He chuckled at himself as he realised he almost forgot something. So wasting no time, he grabbed the only missing weapons from his body; his two bicep knives and holsters. After he quickly attached them to their correct place and adjusted his leather cloak to hide all his weaponry, he walked out of his room.
A hand stopped the door from closing completely. He rolled his eyes before opening the door back up. Harry stared at Hermione in boredom, wondering why some people couldn’t understand no meaning no. And apparently this girl also didn’t know how to respect a thing called personal space either like the rest of this household.
. Now with the two of them out cold, Drew could manoeuvre them to a position that would set the scene and not give away his devious presence to the stupid Order members. He levitated Vernon a few inches off the bed before rotating him to face his wife. With the heavy lump back down, Drew approached Petunia. He placed the butchers knife and his wand on the bedside table before he manually turned her over in bed to lay flat on her back. He chuckled to himself as he thought about how even a man his size would have broken his back trying to move Vernon.
The entire room was in disbelief at what had been revealed. Although some Order members remained sceptical as they had only just met the boy. It was strange how much the kid seemed to know. Of course for those who were present last night, they saw some of the weapons he carried, while those here today could only see the one on his thigh. Moody was probably the only one present that could see his full artillery thanks to his magical eye. The weapons along with the intimate knowledge on people made Harry Potter seem untrustworthy to some at this point in time.
Fearful eyes looked upon his pride and joy, knowing what was about to take place. The bloodied blade of the knife inched closer and closer to the base of his penis, anticipation thick in the air as it seemingly moved in slow motion. The warm surface finally made contact with his delicate skin. He gulped down the heavy amount of saliva in his mouth. A searing pain like he had never felt before started burning as the knife was pushed forwards and backwards in a slicing motion. Steven wanted his screams to so desperately be heard. He wanted someone to come to his rescue and end it all. Wanted this moment to finish as quickly as it started.
“He is right, Harry,” said Dumbledore, confused how the boy even knew the place existed. “No one can get in there without Sirius’s permission.”
secret will be shared with the world. Your name will forever be tarnished. All you worked for in your career will be stripped."
“It may,” Drew shook his head with a fond smile. “But training you is an important task. Especially since, you know.”
What he saw almost made him jump if he had not been so in control of his body reactions. Floating in mid-air, less than an inch from his eyeball, was his Blackhawk Tatang knife. It was dangerously close to his iris that if he had moved, it would have indeed pierced the surface. Leaning back, he shook his head before snatching the offending weapon from thin air. Hearing the dark chuckle from above him, Harry looked up at Drew with anger. He stood up from the ground and placed his knife carefully in his leg holster.
“How did he get up there?” an equally large kid asked next to Dudley, fear and awe evident in his voice.
“You will be joining us this year, I see. I have a hunch I know which Hogwarts House you would like to be sorted into,” said the hat.
“If you pass your O.W.L.s and get accepted into his class, you’ll find out firsthand how much of a prick he is. I barely managed to get a high enough score to go back. I want to become an Auror, and one of the requirements is to complete Potions. So I’m lucky to have gotten this far, although I don’t know if I’ll pass my N.E.W.T.s for it, but it’s better to try, right? Oh you might not know what an Auror is. It’s basically like the wizards and witches who enforce the wizarding law and-“ Ron said before getting cut off, barely taking a breath between each sentence.
“I asked if you are okay,” Nymphadora couldn’t help but smile gently at the other. “Are you worried about him?”
“Of course,” he shook his head in amusement. “Where else would the mighty Drew McIntyre keep his mirror?”
“But I guess the extent of how much he knows will be revealed during his lessons and also he goes on his O.W.L.s exam,” Fred feigned thinking hard as well.
Eyes locked on the desk in the room, Harry walked over to it and pulled out the heavy chair. He lowered himself in the wooden desk chair. He felt the power course through him from the centuries of powerful wizards and witches that had all sat in this very seat. Running his fingers over the smooth wood before him, he couldn’t help but notice the piles of unattended paperwork and letters to the side. Smirking at the thought of the stressed headmaster spending majority of his time lately trying to locate him; very unsuccessfully at that.
“Go find Charlie and deliver this message for me please,” Drew’s thick Scottish accent filled the quiet room. “It’s time. Meet in the foyer when you get this.”
The words hung in the air as Remus tried to keep back his tears. Clearing his throat, he grabbed a few packets of some interesting looking candy. He avoided eye contact with Nymphadora as he continued shopping, not wanting to give away how emotional he really was. So many thoughts about the past and the future went through his mind. His anxiety and worry were heightened in the environment. Grabbing a few packets for himself, he finally headed up to the counter to pay for the lot.
at him then quickly threw his knife. The tactic seemed to work because just as the older man had disarmed both of the incoming spells, his left bicep was hit instantly by Harry’s unsuspecting knife.
Tomorrow Dumbledore would discuss some plans moving forwards with Kingsley, Nymphadora and Alastor about this trip to Azkaban. As much as he hated that he was even considering this, he needed to thanks to that stupid Weasley kid. Only the future would tell if the alternated plans would benefit his desired outcome or absolutely obliterated it. Either way, things were out of his control for the time being. And as much as he would very much like to choke the holy hell out of the two teenage boys - for very different reasons - he knew he needed to try keeping his cool around both Harry Potter and the Weasley family the next time he was in their presence.
“As I was saying, the search for Harry Potter is finally over. We are going to need to keep this extremely quiet for the next couple of weeks. No one is to know he has been found. This information you learn today does not leave this room until we are ready to let the public know. Is this understood?” Dumbledore asked with a stern gaze.
Closing the door behind the twins, Harry grabbed his mokeskin pouch before sitting at the desk near the window. A smile settled on his face, content with how his second interaction with the twins had gone. He sat still for a few seconds as his mind continued to think back on the conversation. He could tell by the twins reactions that he had unsettled them, as well as slightly getting on their nerves by not easily giving in. A small chuckle escaped him as he shook his head in amusement. He had to wonder how long until their next interaction would be as he very much looked forward to it.
“Part of me felt bad for Mrs. Weasley; her house is already so crowded. And I knew in the back of my mind that no one resides in that place,” he continued, noticing the shift in the conversation’s tone.
The room started to blur slightly and morphed until the three of them were standing in the lounge room where not only hours before had Vernon Dursley been tied up and dead in the middle of the floor. Now the fat walrus of a man was lounging back in a chair with his bunioned feet resting in the air, watching whatever braindead show was on the television. Petunia sat on the couch with a straight back, quietly knitting away to herself, occasionally looking up at the boxy television. The quiet of the evening was soon interrupted as their son waddled into the living room with a loud, obnoxious cry followed closely by a terrified looking Harry.
“That’s so kind of you. May I possibly owl my parents so they aren’t worried where I have disappeared to?” Hermione asked with a wide smile.
What could he do now to make sure hardly anyone knew where the boy was? Dumbledore left the letter behind on the desk as he got up and walked over to one of the windows. As he looked over the ground, his thoughts continued to churn out different ideas and solutions. He could allow the boy to stay at Hogwarts. It wouldn’t be very suitable considering it would be hard to keep an eye on him, even with the help of the portraits. Maybe he needed to be moved to a different house put under a Fidelius Charm. But finding a place big enough to house many people would prove difficult on such short notice.
Pointing his wand at his fat uncle, he silently stunned the man with a nonverbal ‘Stupefy’. The red light whizzing through the air and striking the unsuspecting victim. Although the light was bright and lit up the room momentarily, the only child continued to lay where he was as his eyes never left the television. Face scrunching up in disgust, Harry wasted no time in casting the same spell on his cousin, getting what he deserved for being so caught up in the brain dead media. Harry entered the living room quietly, making his way directly to the open window. Shutting the curtains to prevent onlookers from his heinous action that were about to occur.
The food arrived and Malfoy dug in while Harry hesitated to put food on his plate. But knowing that Malfoy and Snape would snap at him to eat more, Harry piled on as much as he thought he could handle right then and there.
With mouth wide open in disbelief, Dumbledore stared at his least most trusted member of staff. The bustling room quickly diminished into a shocked silenced. With cheeks turning rosy red and the twinkle leaving icy blue eyes, the Headmaster stood up slowly from his chair. The room looked on in fear as the old man walked towards them, eyes locked on Severus Snape.
Landing in a quiet, dark alleyway, Harry took a second to observe his surrounds. The street appeared mostly empty. Nearby restaurants and stores had barely any customers. He could feel no magical aura in the immediate proximity. Harry pulled out the pocketknife carefully. He held it delicately in the palm of his hand while removing the tissue to reveal the object. Looking around once more, he quickly casted a non-verbal Disillusionment Charm over himself and the object. Although he blended in with the environment around him, if anyone was to concentrated on his spot then they could easily find him. Keeping that in mind, he flicked out his wand from his holster to prepare the tracking charm.
“I’m going to take you to my Godfather’s room so we can decide what will happen. Be prepared to stay there tonight or for a few nights,” whispered Malfoy, taking the cloak off of Harry and passing it to him before he turned and, Harry’s hand still in his hold, started his way down the stairs again before reaching a corridor. He led Harry through the many corridors of the dungeon and made sure that the whole time Harry was okay and keeping up.
“Hopefully nothing spectacular so we, or more so you, are able to focus on the main mission,” he sighed. “Expect to be pampered and swooned over. They’ll smoother you with kindness, friendship, and caring gestures to persuade you over to their side.”
As he looked around the orange tinted sky, he thought about how this time tomorrow he would be departing and making his way to the Dursley’s. How this time tomorrow would be the last time he would lay eyes on this very sight for a long time. How in over 24 hours, he would be facing the very scenario he had been dreading ever since he was kicked out of the Dursley’s residence. How he would be getting his long awaited revenge on the family that tried to destroy him. And soon enough he’ll be able to get his revenge on the old fool that had placed him at 4 Privet Drive that faithful night.
Draco turned his head, looking around the room. Harry held his breath and stilled all movement, hoping this moment would pass by smoothly. Draco scanned every inch of the room he was in before briefly looking out in to the hallway.
Dumbledore feigned a heavy sigh, forcing a sad twinkle in his eyes as he tried to hide his irritation as much as he could. This boy is already causing so much trouble, causing his loyal followers to question his leadership. He just hoped that no more questions would arise from the rest of the Order of the Phoenix. Not wanting to answer anything right now in fear of betraying his true motives, he decided to remain silence. Hoping the false facial and body expressions would be enough to throw both of his professors off the scent for now.
The answers Harry told Remus gave him much to think about. The man had always wondered why Harry could never be located. It would make sense if the Ministry only places the Tracing charm upon students when they first head to Hogwarts or any other wizarding school. Considering not many parents choose to home-school their kids, it would be feasible. But again, it would also make sense that Harry had been at a place extremely well warded that it would make it impossible for anyone to find him.
“No but’s Ronald Weasley. We’ve been over this. Until you are out of school, you aren’t allowed to join the Order,” Molly said as she hurried up the stairs, ignoring the whining that continued from her youngest son.
The old wizard lifted his head slowly from his hands, dangerous blue eyes flashing with fury. He inhaled slowly, trying to keep his cool as much as he could. He looked around the room slowly to find not even a single pair of eyes was on him.
“Gryffindor. Hogwarts. What is it all like?” Harry tried to keep his tone filled with fascination and wonder as if he hadn’t heard about it before.
"What is it?" he asked, turning his head to the side to look at them while still skilfully removing his first ankle holster.
A white, glowing Phoenix materialised from the tip of Dumbledore’s wand. It flew around the office before perching itself on the edge of the Headmaster’s desk. The Phoenix’s silvery eyes eagerly looking at its caster, awaiting instruction since there was no danger in the vicinity. Dumbledore looked back upon his patronus with fiery eyes, trying to contain all of his raw emotions in front of Kingsley Shacklebolt.
“Yeah,” he nodded and rubbed his eyes. “Came not long after you two left. So I left it there for you.”
Reaching in to his pouch, he summoned up a book to pass the time with. With a small thud, a thick book landed in his hand and he pulled it out. Harry closed the drawstrings of the pouch before placing it on the desk. He looked at the book that had come up and was deeply amused by it. Perhaps his subconscious was thinking about his family back home as he was summoning a book. He ran his hand over the hard cover of the book that Grayson had brought him for his birthday.
“Voldemort attacks Harry mentally and he has to fight to push him out of his head” He explained when she asked why Harry was so tired that he was out of consciousness. She then fled to Dumbledore's office. Draco took Harry's hand in his and sat on a chair near the bed. Lyra stared at Harry with an impassive look borrowed from Draco, but the blonde could almost hear the cogs coming into the blonde's head.
“We just came to pick up the sleepers” Dimitri explained. Zachady took Emett and Ascella in his arms and he went upstairs. Joris pulled Lyra by the hand and he finally lifted her from the ground under the soft protests of the girl. Dimitri took Lesath in his arms and dragged as best he could a sleepy Ezekiel behind him. Alarik lifted Erin in his arms without waking her up. Nathaniel slowly opened an eye and saw Jordan in front of him.
“He said Oh my god” Harry explained, shoving his head through the curtain. Blaise jumped, he then took the time to spit his toothpaste and rinse his mouth before turning around.
“Thank you” He said, kissing Harry. They both reached out and seized the Snitch at the same time and closed both hands on it. Harry put it in his pocket, having a little idea, then he came down again and set foot on the ground near the other three who seemed still shocked by the fall they had just made like Draco. Sirius was laughing loudly as Severus and Lucius stared at Harry with a kind of fascination in their eyes.
“So, what’s the reason for this family reunion?” He asked as he entered the room. The conversations stopped when he entered.
“But not right now” Harry wanted to ask why they couldn’t do it now bit he didn’t have the time because there was a loud thud behind him. He turned on his chair to look. The thud seemed to come from upstairs and everyone in the room was now looking in this direction.
“Then we're getting ready and we're going” He announced while standing up and leaving Dumbledore's office almost running.
“How do you know all this?” Harry asked, squinting, suspiciously. Mal-Draco laughed slightly at Harry's mistrust.
“Sorry for that” Malfoy only shook his head to show that it was nothing. Harry then got up and found his clothes perfectly folded on the second bed of the room. He realized at that moment that he was in his new room. He then dressed quickly and realized that Malfoy was staring at him as he pulled on his T-shirt. The blond was still lying in bed and when he saw that the brown had noticed that he was looking at him he got up too. He put on black jeans and his sweater and they came out of the room, each opening a door and giving a powerful effect to all those present on the other side of the door. Ezekiel, Nathaniel, Jordan, and Alarik jumped and quickly stood up when they came out of the room. They were originally all four lying on the ground in a kind of star, their heads were all gathered in the center and the legs each pointed in different directions. And they were arguing like that. Harry would have liked to have friends with whom to do that.
“I advise you to speak now, Weasley. You know perfectly well that I would not hesitate for a single second to do it” Ginny arrived at this moment and froze at the sight that presented itself before her eyes. Alarik blocked her so that she didn’t interrupt the scene in front of them. Harry continued to watch his son in full death threat without moving.
“Oh fuck, Draco” Harry moaned, throwing his head back. It was then that Ron realized what they were really doing.
“I mean she's really very smart and she's frankly not bad at all physically. She is really devoted to her friends, funny and her literary tastes are really great”
“Just stop and fuck me” legs opening even wider. The brunette chuckled and pulled his fingers away. Harry started to push his hard cock smoothly into Draco. Much too slowly in Draco’s opinion.
The days passed, bringing them closer and closer to the Christmas holidays. Harry did not share it with anyone but he questioned himself strongly about the holidays. First because he had to buy gifts and secondly he wondered if they would spend the holidays at the castle. Besides, he could hardly see Draco anymore and Harry had to admit that it worried him a bit. It worried him a lot, really, and he was really on edge. The blond had just arrived in front of him and Harry didn’t even want to look at him. The blonde wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him close to him.
“Oi! Get out of my bathroom! You’re gonna break something precious” Draco yelled as he approached the door of the bathroom. Blaise opened it and then went off with a smirk on his face. He sat beside Pansy.
“What's going on here, by merlin?” Draco exclaimed when he saw Alya holding Lena against the wall. She twisted her arms behind her back.
"Lupin". There was then only one door where no name was inscribed. They opened the door gently and were relieved to find Hermione, Blaise and Theo immersed in thick books. There were two tables, one with a large number of books, and the other, where all three were. They each had an open book in front of them and took notes with an extremely concentrated air. Draco and Harry had closed the door and watched them, their presence not yet noticed. Draco cleared his throat after a while. They turned to look at them and smiled. Harry suddenly had his head spinning and Draco narrowly caught him before he collapsed to the floor. The blonde's hands came into contact with Harry's arms and Harry felt his headache and vertigo disappeared almost instantly. And Draco had to admit he felt better too. The other three looked at each other, then approached the bed where Harry and Draco had sat.
“Do you mean how do I do that?” Harry asked, revealing a black-colored ball of magic with red highlights in the palm of his hand. Draco looked fascinated as well as everyone else.
Harry stepped out of the compartment but someone held him by the hand. He found himself facing Draco who kissed him.
“We don’t need anyone to understand since you've already guessed everything, aren’t you?” Hermione looked up at him and nodded slowly.
“Because we don’t wanna die, do we?” Jordan moved his head to say no and then glared at the wall like it was mean to him. Nathaniel pulled the library to close it. Just as it closed, the door of the living room bursted open.
“Calm down, we just want to talk to you” She calmed them with a reassuring smile. They didn’t recoil, but didn’t seem very reassured for all that. Harry reached out to them.
“It's funny, he has the same head as you when Dumbledore taught us about the kids” Draco laughed at Harry. The latter laughed.
“Harry!” He shouted as he ran across the children's room where Emett, Jackson, Jasper, Skott and Isaak were. The five boys watched him pass and then began to build a more than shady plan. Draco violently opened the double doors and saw Harry huddled on the windowsill.
Breaking up was always painful and Draco now perfectly understood why it was called ‘breaking up’. He felt broken.
“We’re making you beautiful” Pansy replied simply. He looked at himself in the mirror when they had finished. He had pretty black jeans on and a green shirt that made his eyes stand out. His hair was pretty much his hair, Emett came to help with that part, and Harry found himself particularly sexy dressed like that.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!” He whispered harshly to Blaise. “You brought Pansy!” Blaise smirked at him and smiled brightly when Pansy walked in the room. Draco scowled at her from his sitting position on the bed.
When he opened his eyes the next day, he was lying in his bed and was pressed against a warm chest. He smiled and then intertwined his fingers with those against his belly.
“I thought you were never going to come and you were going to let us die” It was Harry's turn to laugh.
“Dad!” Erika threw herself into Sirius' legs and Seth into Remus's. The two adults were greatly surprised but did bend down to take the children in their arms. They walked into the room, watching the children.
“I'm not gonna have to do it with you too?” They all nodded, and Jordan grabbed the hands of his two sisters and led them to Ron and Blaise. Lyra, meanwhile, stood next to Harry and Malfoy and only one of her glare was enough to make his three brothers join her. All that remained was Seth, Erika, and Alarik.
“I’m not worried about it,” he shrugged, laying more bacon in the pan like instructed. “I am mainly doing it to brush up on my knowledge before my exams. I’m sure I’ll be done in no time.”
Harry abruptly came to a stop as his eyes comically widen with fear. The three adults turned their heads to find yet another three children running directly towards the terrified child. They turned their attention back to Harry just in time to see the young boy turn on his heel and run into the open backyard of a house. His fat cousin leading the other two he was with to meet up in the middle with the first two boys. The group of five slowly catching their breath as wolfish grins and lit up eyes stared towards the backyard.
Gulping down the last of his tea, Dumbledore swiftly left the house without another word to the family. After he had closed the door behind him, he marched up the dark street with his robes swirling out behind him in the gentle breeze. How he wished that this night had turned out differently, if only he was walking away from the house with the Potter brat in his grasp. His body took him towards the end of the street while his mind was preoccupied in dark thoughts.
“Successfully rescued, alive and mostly unharmed,” Harry said as he stepped in and closed the door. “Also successfully retrieved the diary.”
Many questions wanted to come out at once, but Remus withheld his tongue as he looked at the younger man. Now he was closer up to him, he could see so many resemblances of James and Lily. There was no doubt in his mind that this was the one and only Harry Potter. His mannerism was a little off putting, but that might be down to his preconceived expectations of the missing boy. All Remus hoped for him was that he had been safe and cared for the years he was missing, and he did seem to have been taken care of fairly well.
The further he continued to read, the angrier he was getting by the second. That Weasley boy had managed to undo all of his hard work with a few words. By this time tomorrow, the entire wizarding world will know Harry Potter is alive and back. Everything was out of his control thanks to that blasted Weasley brat. There was nothing he could do to prevent what was about to happen.
Hearing those words come out of his mouth, Molly felt a wave of sadness run through her body. She knew that the boy was the only hope of getting rid of the Dark Lord, but she didn’t expect the younger to solely focus on that. He was only a kid for merlin’s sake! He should not be focusing on preparing for the fight of his lifetime. Instead he should be focusing on finishing school and living his life to the fullest.
“How are you feeling about starting your study in a few days?” she asked, watching Harry put a plate of bacon on the table. “Just one more plate of bacon should do, dear.”
Scoffing and rolling his eyes, Harry watched as his uncle handed the keys to his cousin. After all this time, that kid was still being spoilt as if he was the prophet boy that was destined to save the entirety of the planet. Not only last week had the whale of a boy spat a tantrum in the middle of Privet Drive when his father had not allowed him to drive. Harry smirked as he thought back to a red faced Petunia Dursley rushing out to resolve the conflict.
Slowly, Harry pushed his presence into Severus Snape’s mind. He tried to break down the barriers within at a snail’s pace as to not alert the other. He found a little push here and there, but so far he had yet to be detected. Harry could contribute the slightly relaxed barriers due to the distractions of the ongoing events around the man. He was utterly impressed at the sheer amount of layers he had protecting his mind. It was unlike any he had seen before. The impressive barriers would have definitely come in handy when it came to being a double spy agent for both side, preventing either mad man from perusing his memories and thoughts without permission. There was no doubt the other had probably perfected the art of sharing specific memories while not letting his guard down at the same time.
Clapping from behind Harry brought him out of his own world. He turned around to see Drew walking towards him with an impressed smile. Harry couldn’t help but smile at his mentor, feeling a little less anxious now that he had run off some pent up energy. He had thoroughly been enjoying his time training with his new weapons. With not much room on his body to strap on the sheath, he decided to place them just above his ankles. Tightening them to fit snuggly on his black pants, he found it quite natural to pull them out when he was in a crouch as well as nonverbally summoning them with an
Grunting and applying extra pressure, Harry managed to successfully sever and decapitate the entire penis from its owner. He held the member up in the air, blood still dripping from it, and held it for the both of them to see. He inspected the cut and was quite impressed with his skills; it was a rather clean slice considering other factors such as uncontrollable movements. He lowered the penis only to notice Steven was one again unconscious. The shock of seeing his penis removed must have pushed him over the edge this time rather than the pain. He simply discarded the penis to lay vertical on the pelvic area before standing up.
Seeing why he shouldn’t continue acting accordingly to normal missions, Harry slipped his wand into his hand and casted a Disillusionment charm to hide himself from the view as he made his way to his relatives place. He felt his heartbeat begin to quicken as he flew closer and closer to the house filled with nightmarish memories. Shivers traveling down his spine as memories resurfaced that he had tried so hard to supress and forget about. The sky seemingly darkened along with him as his thoughts turned violent. Rage bubbled dangerously under the surface.
“That’s okay,” sighed Remus, knowing he needed to build up way more trust before he could start delving into his past. “I just wanted to know if you have been safe and well cared for. And maybe thank those people one day for taking good care of you.”
“I am here to speak with Sev and I brought Harry Potter with me. Just go tell Sev that I’m here regarding a very important issue,” impatiently spoke Malfoy, his grip on Harry’s hand tightened for a second before relaxing.
Grayson wasted no time, immediately rushing forwards and tightly wrapping his smaller arms around Harry’s back and stomach. His head resting on Harry’s steadily beating heart, find it comforting to listen to. Wrapping his own arms around the younger, Harry felt his heart break. He and Grayson had never been away from each other since Grayson had been taken in. Harry knowing what the younger had been through only made their bond stronger. He didn’t know how the other would cope without him here to turn to, to be there in the dark moments, to talk to late at night when everyone else was asleep.
This was exactly what Dumbledore did not want to happen. He wanted to keep Harry a secret from the rest of the wizarding world for as long as he could. And thanks to that idiotic Weasley child, his grand plans had been dashed in one day. Part of Dumbledore was glad the boy wasn’t here, otherwise he might not have had the self-control to restrain himself from strangling the child. He wondered how long until the majority of the wizarding world knew.
Almost a millisecond after the handle left his fingers, an obnoxiously loud alarm blared in the distance. Harry’s head whipped around knowing exactly what that noise was. Someone was trying to get into his room. Sighing in irritation, he left all of his weapons abandoned on the ground as he took out his Nimbus 2000, flying like the wind back towards his room in the Burrow.
Moving the tip of the knife, he dragged it up along Steven's left leg, running over the thin ropes holding him in place. He came to a stop right next to his pelvis, sweat pouring down his victim's face as he saw where the knife was. Harry smirked before retracting the knife and watching the wide brown eyes.
“Does he need help? I can help. I’m a really good tutor and I got good grades on my O.W.L.s,” said Hermione as she sat up straight, eyes glistening with wonder. “I’d love to help in any way I can.”
The room erupted in to shocked chaos. Dumbledore watched their reactions intently, taking note of each person. He noticed majority of the members that worked within the Ministry of Magic were not shocked. Obviously Shacklebolt had not been lying when he said the talk was not being hidden. The rest of the group shook in their shoes, fear and hysteria rapidly setting in. This was the news they had all feared; that one day Voldemort would return. The family of red heads huddled together, Molly squeezing all of her children that were present.
“I am,” he chuckled. “Next time you should try going face first down that way your eyes are always on the target.”
Harry hummed in response as he started walking towards the entry, wanting to get out of there as soon as possible. They reached the doors without another hiccup. Looking around and finding the place still empty, Harry opened the door. He paused with it slightly ajar, looking around for any signs of life. He poked his head out and looked up towards the windows where Draco’s room was. But thankfully he couldn’t see anyone. Nodding to Parker, they stepped outside quietly. Harry leaned back to close the door gently, sighing once he successfully did.
“You heard that too, right?” one of the unknown males said, voice deep but not as deep as the one before.
"Some of us have problems with the way things are being handled," Minerva spoke up as she stepped forward in front of the group. "We would like to talk about a few things."
“That would be great, thanks,” he gave a fake smile as he watched Ron leave the room with a bright flush on his face.
Gripping the ‘t’ shaped handle in his fist with the blade sticking out between his index and middle finger, Harry imagined someone charging towards him. As he moved around the space, he grasped the TPE material harder, ignoring the pain it caused him slightly. For if he was in an actual fight, the grip on the weapon was more important than any physical pain the awkwardly shaped weapon would cause. He almost scoffed at the image of an opponent knocking the loosely held weapon from his hold, not that it would happen.
Once again, it slips their notice of the use of Harry’s given name. Harry kissed him again softly and slowly mouths down to his neck before he adding another finger into Draco’s intimacy. He brushed against that bundle of nerves deep in Draco’s body before Draco gasped out,
Harry did not see him, but Malfoy had a big smile on his face, if Potter thought he was being discreet by looking at him that way, he was more silly than he’d thought. Finally, Harry pulled on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt while Malfoy put on black jeans with a gray sweater, magnifying his eyes beautifully. Malfoy was walking towards the exit of the room and Harry remembered his new good resolution so he held the blonde by the wrist just before he opened the door. Malfoy turned to him, an eyebrow raised in wonder. Harry cleared his throat, uncomfortable.
“I didn’t think you had such a high-pitched voice, Hermione” Blaise laughed from his place in the kitchen.
“You are moving away from me, you are probably planning to leave me and on top of that you act as if nothing was happening every night! And you think I'll let you take me in your arms! You must be kidding” Harry snarled. Draco then understood the essence of the problem.
“What if we sit down?” Ron offered, he seemed to be bored to listen to them speaking. Harry and Hermione both sat on a couch, while the two boys sat on either side of Ron on the opposite couch. Hermione was still staring at them, which was starting to scare them a bit.
Harry tied his legs around Draco's waist when he lifted him up and walked to the shower. He pressed Harry against the cold tiles while kissing him. Hot water came out of the showerhead and Draco began to kiss Harry's neck, enjoying his moans.
“Inform him about Horcruxes” Ezekiel interjected, pushing one of the doors, followed by his brother and sister. The three of them came in and stood next to them as Draco's eyes widened as he recognized the name, Harry stared at the scene without understanding anything, and Dumbledore yelled at Severus.
“What did you do?” She asked Draco immediately, ignoring Blaise. He opened his mouth to say that he didn’t do anything but was cut off by Blaise.
Then, bodies fell from the ceiling, screaming. They all crashed on the ground and then the silence was back. Harry looked at them and they seemed unconscious. Four of them looked about around his age while the others looked like they were around 12 years old.
“Oh, shut up will you” Draco growled, letting himself fall back to Harry, thrusting his head into the mattress. Harry swiveled to the side and the blond laid on his back. The Gryffindor could then place his head on Draco's shoulder and they fell asleep for the night, or at least what was left of it.
Harry was now in front of the gargoyle that led to Dumbledore's office and hesitated to give the password. He heard hurried steps coming towards him. Soon he saw Alarik running towards him, his big brother following him from afar as he walked. Alarik grabbed his wrist and dragged him into an empty classroom. Dimitri closed the door with a spell when he arrived.
“I see we're in the same situation then” Ezekiel said. A silence then settled in the room. Harry yawned and decided to go to bed no matter what was the time.
“You're right, your face was so much worse” Harry giggled, hitting Draco's chest lightly as Sirius stared at them strangely, not understanding this reversal of behavior. Ron and Hermione came to hug Sirius in their arms. Lyra went close and hugged him too.
As Malfoy came out, Harry turned and looked at the room. The room was square and two double beds were on each side, then two large wardrobes were placed next to the beds. On the back wall, there was the bathroom door. The room was in shades of beige, gray, black and white. Harry smiled a little as he looked around the room, he felt good here. He turned around and went through the door too, or at least he tried but he hit Malfoy's back, who had been standing on the doorstep.
Eleonor and Ezekiel were reading books at one of the tables. She was sitting on the table, holding a book at her eyes level and he was sitting on a chair between her legs, his book on one of her legs. Nathaniel and Jordan were lying on one of the sofas. Jordan seemed to be asleep, his head on his boyfriend’s chest. One of his arms was wrapped around the blond waist and one of his legs was pulled up between Nath’s. Nathaniel was talking quietly with Joris, Alarik and Erin who were sitting on the floor next to him.
Zach almost ran to a girl and knelt down beside her as the triplets appeared next to Harry and Draco.
“You sleep together, I don’t see any other solution” The two boys opened their eyes wide with astonishment.
“But you're welcome, all the pleasure was mine” It made Harry laugh. They then got up and went out of the room for good. The kids were gone and Harry was grateful for that. They found the whole troop in the great hall. Harry settled in front of Hermione. She greeted them with a smile and Harry was surprised to see Ron laughing with Theo sitting next to Hermione.
“It wouldn’t really have been a rape, Potter” Harry nearly choked on himself again and blushed heavily.
He could then start a slow and long come and go that made Draco moan in pleasure. The blonde shouted Harry's name as he hit his prostate. He then made sure to hit it as much as possible and soon the room was filled with groans more indecent than the other and cries of pleasure. After a good number of back and forth move, they both came almost at the same time. Harry fell back on Draco, both completely out of breath. Harry was the first to recover and he straightened slightly, not wishing to crush his lover. Draco finally smiled, his eyes still closed.
“Is not this Voldemort's HQ?” He asked. Lucius replied that the Lord had never had the opportunity to settle there since Lucius had somehow refused to become a Death Eater again. He had also expressed concern that Voldemort might look for them here, or that he might see them fly. Lucius had hurried away all his sources of anxiety, assuring him that Voldemort would never have the idea of looking for them here. Harry had forgotten all that and was quick to grab his new broom and jump up to the sky. A panicked Draco had followed him quickly, the blond was visibly traumatized by the incident that had occurred at Hogwarts.
“Of course yes, I was even thinking of helping him, actually” Draco chuckled. Harry laughed and kissed Draco.
“For starters, there are the three of you and eight other kids coming out of nowhere. Nobody knows you, and you look like some of us" She paused in her speech, looking for the rest and leaving time for others to assimilate her first words. Everyone was deep in thought, thinking about what she’d just said.
Harry tilted Draco aside and placed himself between his legs. He took possession of his lips in a rather passionate kiss. They were interrupted by two cries. They turned their heads to the source of the noise and saw Fred and George on the doorstep, mouth and eyes wide open as possible. Harry could very well imagine that the scene was quite shocking from their point of view. He was lying, shirtless, between Draco Malfoy's legs and he was kissing him.
They fell on the bed, breathing heavily. Harry rolled to the side and rest on his back beside Draco who had his face into the mattress. He waited until his body stopped to shake to roll on his back too. They don’t look at each other as usual. Draco looked at the ceiling as the guilty feeling he usually felt after they fucked came to him.
“He means the night when there was a storm, the night Dimi arrived and the night you slipped into my innocent brother’s bed” They all laughed at the word ‘innocent’, knowing full well that he was far from being it.
“Explain yourself” Draco asked more aggressively than expected. Harry glared at him, wanting him to calm down.
“You told us a few things about war in the future, you know. And from what I know, we’ll have to start acting. We can’t just let Voldemort attack Daddy without counter-attacking” Draco nodded and looked at Harry for a moment, looking pensive.
“He’s Jordan, but you already know him for the most part, the two little redheads are Irina and Isallys and they are Jordan's sisters” She then showed Nathaniel's fourth friend and the little girl next to him.
“Right but you yelled at your son and his friends when they were right. You were wrong , Draco” Draco nodded, looking a bit ashamed. “You made him cry” Harry added, feeling really mad at Draco for making his son cry. His anger felt like it wasn’t his own, like it was from far away. But it was still his, he could tell it was coming from him.
“We know who you are” The blond boy said in a voice so cold that Harry felt like he was in front of Malfoy. He grabbed Harry's hand with a slight smile. His brunette friend was watching the scene, a bored look on his face. So Ron handed him his hand, which he grasped firmly. Hermione, who was not participating in the exchange, cleared her throat, drawing the attention of the four boys on her.
“My brother and I are the first twins in the family so we have a lot of magic and it shows in one of our physical characters. And I also have the ability to read minds” Harry nodded, a sign he understood.
“I think that's actually what happened” Harry glanced at the boys behind him as Draco pondered the meaning of his words. His son's four friends were hidden behind him. Jackson's blue eyes were wet and he was hiding behind his twin, who was hiding behind the Black-Snape twins. Emett's lower lip was shaking dangerously so Harry turned and lifted him into his arms. The little boy wrapped his legs and arms around him, and as soon as he lay his head against his neck, Harry felt tears running down his skin. He gently stroked the boy's back while glaring at Draco. The four boys stuck to him. Draco looked away, clearing his throat.
“Stop it you fools! You too are in love too and it seems to me that we’re not making fun of you” Tented to defend Erin.
“If you want my opinion Weasley, Blaise is my best friend and believe me, nothing will work better than going to see him looking confident and kissing him, putting all your feelings in this kiss” The two boys turned their heads to the blond who hadn’t even looked up from his book. Ron looked back at the ceiling as Harry's worry skyrocketed as Draco winced again. Ron almost flung himself out of bed and left the room with a quick step under the blonde's sneers.
“I bet it's Aunt Mione” Zachady shouted behind Blaise. He shut the door of his room and entered the Malfoy Potter's. He also closed that door and flung himself on the mattress next to Draco who had a hand under Harry's T-shirt. Theo and Hermione moved to the other side of Draco and Pansy settled between Hermione's legs, herself between Theo's.
“Obviously” Draco made a smile that didn’t please Harry at all. He knew he was right when he saw Dumbledore dancing in a really transparent nightdress. Harry took a disgusted look.
Harry and Draco were doing their best to kiss each other without waking up the other two people in the room. The door swung open and Draco, in a pure reflex, tilted to the side. He fell into a thud on the floor and he thanked Harry for catching his head.
“They are in the chamber of secrets” Once her sentence finished, Alya hit her head against the wall and she dropped her on the floor, unconscious. The triplets then turned like one man and left the apartment, Zephir, Erin, Joris, Alarik and Jordan on their heels. Harry and Draco exchanged glances before following them. Draco opened his mouth wide when his five children asked the Chamber of Secrets to open up in Parseltongue and he understood perfectly. He froze on the spot, even after everyone except Harry jumped.
“What’s this?” He asked the brunette. Harry put his hand in his pocket and took out the object. He punched Draco slightly, who was staring at him without understanding.
“Leave them a few minutes, Mr. Malfoy. they haven’t seen each other for several months. And they are pretty touching I must say” Lucius nodded, growling, but a tiny smile finally made his appearance on his lips. After several minutes, the four children stopped bickering.
“I'm sorry Rik” He gave her a smile and took her in his arms and walked away. Harry and Draco were still in a state of deep shock.
“And it's Eleanor and Zachady” Nathaniel went on, pointing at the brown girl and the black boy. Hermione finally raised her head and Harry, who saw the two young women almost side by side, noticed the great resemblance. Without a doubt the girl was Hermione's daughter.
It was in this position that Harry and Hermione found them. Harry did not even know what was going on and just went out of the room looking for his blond boyfriend. He found him in the room occupied by Pansy and Ginny. He had his head in his best friend's neck and Harry could hear his sobs from the children's room. He opened the door as softly as he could and entered. He sat next to Draco and Pansy gently pushed Draco into his arms and then slipped out of the room. Harry tightened his arms around Draco and stroked his hair.
“Actually, I think Elie...” Nathaniel was cut off by a glare from Jordan who promised him a thousand sufferings. Everyone could distinctly hear him swallow.
“Are you OK?” Harry shook his head. Draco felt panic seize him as he felt all the pain Harry felt when he placed one of his hands against his arm. Then suddenly the pain disappeared completely and Harry opened his eyes again. He widened them immediately.
Harry didn’t pay any attention to her, his bright eyes boring into Draco’s. Draco knew he was fucked. Those puppy eyes always had him doing anything for Harry and the smaller man knew that.
“I have no reason to stay here, I'm going back to our dorm and we'll see each other in the Great Hall tomorrow.” Harry nodded and hugged her before letting her go.
“We just wanted to check on you all because it’s been hours since you left” Harry nodded again. Emerik brushed passed him, shoving him aside to kneel in front of a boy. They were all starting to wake up by now. The boy reached up to touch Emerik cheek as he sighed.
“What are...” Draco started but he couldn’t finish his sentence, uttering a really loud groan when Harry licked his cock all the way. The brown repeated his gesture several times, tearing groans from the blonde. He placed his hands on the Slytherin’s hips who began to stir. Then, without warning, he engulfed Draco’s erection at once, tearing a cry to Draco. He wrapped his tongue around the sex in his mouth while Draco gripped his hair with one hand and the sheet with the other.
“Sirius and the others must have arrived by now” Harry replied with a shrug. As if to confirm his words, Lesath screamed in his high-pitched voice in the next room.
“He looks at you like all the time and there’s so much love in his eyes, it’s really disgusting” Blaise added. Draco started to open his mouth in surprise but he doesn’t tell anything.
“This plan can wait a few hours, Draco. Especially since we're not going to put that plan together and nobody's in the apartment yet” Harry retorted. The blond offer him a pout before taking his mouth. He quickly straightened up and lifted Harry up to lead them into the room.
“We should do a parent-children match again when we get back to Hogwarts” Joris offered, shaking his fork.
“Madame Pompfresh told us that your loss of consciousness was due to Voldemort” He continued. Harry nodded again.
“You can call me Harry, that will be enough” The brown man replied with a smirk. Draco chuckled before hugging Harry and burying his head in his neck. Harry smiled and stroked his hair. He didn’t know exactly how much time they spent like that, but he was brought back to reality when blows were knocked at the door.
A satisfied hum rung through the room as Drew turned his attention back to Petunia. He wanted to cause a bit more of a deeper wound to the foul woman before he left. Looking from his combat knife to the butchers knife, it was clear in his mind which one would do more damage. So without another thought Drew holstered his knife before grabbing the giant kitchen knife from the bedside table. His evil smirk reflected on the silver surface as he moved it around to inspect every inch of it. Yes, indeed, this knife was quite perfect for the job.
Before Dumbledore could say anything else, all attention turned to the door being opened. Severus Snape froze for a millisecond at the sheer amount of people in the cramped room. With a disgusted look on his face, he closed the door and practically hugged the wall. If anyone got to close to him then he would give them his famous, deadly stare. Dumbledore’s magic unintentionally lashed out to the nearest people at the utter disrespect the late member showed.
“Then you need to relax a little, Harry” Drew said as he placed down the diary and folded his hands together. “This is it.”
The group laughed, all chance of being caught gone for now. Harry kept his eyes trained on the group while warily taking steps to his left and back against the wall.
Like had happened every night since the bigger pile of lard had purchased the sports car, the father and son duo got in before noisily taking off to run the same route they always did. Harry narrowed in on Petunia, following her movement as she tried to sheepishly waved across the street at the neighbour who had stuck their head out their door. Inadvertently being the very same house on which Harry hid on the roof of, behind the chimney and safely out of view. He watched as Petunia hastily made her way back inside, seeing her settle in on the couch in the living room. The curtains that were wide open showed perfectly what the layout and future looked like within, a helpful advantage he had over them.
The two Auror’s looked at each other, daring the other to raise the topic. Alastor turned his head away in defiant silence. He had already brought up the issue of 12 Grimmauld Place, so he was going to let Kingsley handle this one. His magical eye twisted and turned in his head until he could see Kingsley out the side of his head, still staring expectantly at him. Alastor tried not to show any sign of his victory as the other sighed before looking at the Headmaster of Hogwarts.
"Think of it as your last official mission before you leave for Hogwarts," he smiled and took a sip of his drink.
Harry made sure his hoodie was covering his identity as he ran across the street with speed, eyes never leaving the window of 4 Privet Drive. He crouched down as soon as he arrived at the door step, wand sliding smoothly in to his hand. Silently he unlocked the door with a small click signifying the success of the spell. It swung open a few inches, a strong scent of alcohol wafting straight into his nostrils. Harry scrunched his nose in disgust as he stood up from where he was squatting. He took a cautious step in to the house for the first time in eleven years.
Time seemed to slow down for the two of them as they waited in anticipation for the other Order members to arrive. The first few people landed within five minutes, looking around at each other and towards the leader of the group for some indication as to why they had been called so suddenly. They remained silent out of respect and a bit of fear of Dumbledore, waiting for him to engage first so they would not face his wrath. The room was practically sizzling with his anger, magic lashing out without the man’s knowledge. This rarely happened and they all knew that when it did, it was bad news.
The fact Remus was selfishly giving up his time to help a boy he had never met before warmed her heart. Yes, the man felt obliged to help his childhood friend's son, but he didn’t need to. Nymphadora couldn’t help but admire the caring nature of the soft, older male. Her heart clenching as she remembered the emotion in both his eyes and voice moments ago. She saw so many qualities in the other that were rather endearing and attractive. Finding her face growing hot as Nymphadora found herself thinking about the other in that way.
“I’ll be prepared for a duel if I know where the damn book is located,” he grunted before gently shoving Parker along. “Do you know where it is?”
“Thank you,” he nodded his head before relaxing back in to the couch. “Well I’m sure you are keen to know about tonight.”
“Does it matter anymore? It’s done. I can’t change the past,” he replied quietly, annoyed this was being brought up yet again.
As he reached the first floor, he was pulled out of the memories by a disapproving click of a tongue. His eyes laid upon Charlie Poole lazily lounging on one of the couches. The young lad was shaking his head with a cheeky, yet stern look on his face. Drew couldn’t help but chuckle at the antics of the other.
Harry smirked as he continued to saw off the offending member, grunting slightly with all the thick parts. Blood spurted everywhere, his hands, the floor, as well as soaked into both of their clothes. As each second ensured, Steven became more and more restless. He was arching his back, bucking his hips, kicking his hips, thrashing side to side, all in an attempt to make it stop. It was making Harry's job harder, however, knowing the pain his victim would have been experiencing made it bearable. He assumed it wouldn't be much longer until he passed out from the pain once more.
“Is that envelope for me?” Drew asked after spotting an unopened, yellow envelope on the coffee table.
Ron’s siblings chuckled as his face only grew redder by the second. All of the attention was now on him again, much to his horror. He knew he messed up. He knew he shouldn’t have said it that loudly. He knew his words could have led to some major consequences. But everything had worked out in the end, right? They managed to get out safely. Harry was still in one piece. So what people now knew he was back? The public was sure to find out sooner rather than later.
Only the sounds of the clock ticking and the crackling fire emitted from the otherwise silent office. No movement had been heard within as the minutes slowly turned to hours. Drew McIntyre sat in front of his fireplace with a glass of firewhiskey in his hand. His mind travelling miles away to another place, thinking over the plans for the upcoming week. He was consumed by worry for Harry, taking him in when he was young and helping to raise him all these years had a profound effect on him. The young man felt like close family to him, almost like a son. Drew only wanted what was best for the younger.
“Might make Harry’s job that bit easier if they still haven’t noticed in a week,” he mused, also shaking his head.
Grabbing his wand, Harry attacked instantly, trying to stun the older man instead of harming him. Yet Lucius was ready as the red light raced towards him. Easily able to deflect it, Lucius fired back without hesitation. Going down the nasty root like Parker warned. Lucky for Harry that he has had extensive training in duels and has a comprehensive knowledge of defensive spells and counter charms.
Harry adjusted his long, leather cloak before swiftly walking to the left side of the path. He crouched down behind the very first bush, peaking around it to look for any signs of movement. This mission was going to take time and patience, one wrong move and the game is up. Perhaps that was why Drew choose him. A bubble of proudness engulfed him for a mere second before he squashed it down. He couldn’t let emotions interfere with the task at hand, it was too dangerous.
The entire group stayed silent as the words from the youngest member of their family hung heavily in the air. Their hearts sunk as the seconds dragged on, neither boy wanting to let go of the other. The silence was soon filled with soft sobs as Grayson let out his pent up emotions. He broke down crying for the first time as he squeezed all of the air out of Harry. His heart broke for the younger. He tried to soothe him by rubbing his back gently, knowing he craved caring and gentle touches since he was so deprived of them as a child.
“Yeah,” he was slightly taken aback by the change in attitude. “My whole family, for generations, has been sorted into Gryffindor. In my opinion it’s the best house out of them all.”
Together, him and Drew gathered a small team to research as much as possible into these ancient forms of magic. They took notes on the history of any documented cases where a sacrificial protection was used. Many hours were spent going through parchments, some took months to translate from other languages. But one thing they had seen in all of the cases were the long lasting benefits for the person being protected. It was a very common occurrence that the murderer could not touch the protected without experiencing unbearable pain. There were even some cases where if the murderer tried to cast any spell on the protected once the sacrificial protection was in place, it would simply rebound back to the caster.
The little shit just had to go and mess up everything. Severus was probably right in assuming he was a spoilt brat. While he may not have been a spoilt brat when he lived at the Dursley’s, he probably was currently living a life of luxury under the care of someone. Probably someone who knows nothing about the wizarding world. Otherwise they would have been utterly selfish to hide Harry from his fate. He was destined to defeat Voldemort by giving his life up during the duel, yet now he was completely unprepared and untrained. This was all thanks to whoever took him.
The man instantly froze, becoming unconscious in mid-step. His limp body falling forwards and tumbled down the remaining steps. Harry would have winced if he cared for the man when he heard a loud cracking sound as Steven's face went directly into one of the steps with full force. Steven came to land awkwardly with the half of his body folded over, legs spread out in mid-air, his own crotch smashed against his unconscious, bloodied face.
Everyone turned their heads to see Molly Weasley with tears in her eyes, clutching her husband’s arm. While no one ever voiced this opinion in front of the Headmaster, they were all thinking it every time their searches turned out fruitless.
In all honesty, Harry could probably head on in right now and start the job. However he wanted to wait just a little longer. He needed them to be in the prime position for when he entered. Preferably one or two members of the household leaving the living room. That way he wasn’t able to be ganged up on, not like they would be able to with his magical abilities. However it was better to be safer rather than sorry. He exhaled deeply as he adjusted his position on the roof, his muscles aching slightly from the training he had been putting his body through the last day and a half since receiving the new weapons for his birthday.
Ridding anymore thoughts along those lines for now, he snatched the small box that held his shrunken Nimbus 2000 from his bedside table. With one last longing gaze, he turned sharply on his heel and left the room. Closing the door softly behind him, Harry took a deep breath to compose himself before finally descending the stairs. As soon as he had reached the last few steps, people begun to stand up and make their way over to the staircase. He smiled at the glum faces that surrounded him, knowing this was as equally hard for them as it was for him. A small figure pushed through the small crowd to stand at the front.
Harry’s eyes widened dramatically as Malfoy raised his wand and swished it in a small circle. Flinching and closing his eyes, Harry felt the tingles wash over his skin and he knew, from doing it to himself so many times, that Malfoy had just taken away his glamour. That meant that he was now standing in front of his mortal enemy, exposing all of his scars, bruises and cuts.
“Don’t you recognise me, dear Uncle?” Harry laughed darkly as he pulled the hoodie off of his face to finally reveal himself.
“Have you been in the magical world?” Dumbledore’s red face giving away how much Harry was getting on his nerves.
“My magical caregiver was in fact you, Headmaster Dumbledore,” he ignored the comment once again with a vicious glare. “Was, is the key word. You are no longer my magical caregiver. And before you dropped me off at the Dursley’s all those years ago, you discovered I had a piece of Lord Voldemort’s soul within me.”
Blood soaked the carpet beneath Vernon, creating a spongy noise as Harry stood with feet either side of the fingerless stumps of hands. He looked around at the family that once abused him, glad to see the fear they had instilled in him present in their eyes. Making sure they were both paying attention first, he then proceeded to bring his right hand up to his shoulder and he lent forwards slightly. He looked Vernon dead in the eyes as he swung his right arm down with force, slicing a deep, long gash in the middle of his throat. The male immediately begun to gurgle and choke on his on blood. No longer being able to breathe properly, he soon passed out from oxygen depletion. The life slowly draining from his body.
With his body fully inside, he softly moved the door to close behind him, eyes never leaving the hallway. All of his sense where on full alert as he made his way towards the living room, back against the wall to keep him from view. Inch by inch, he moved closer to the doorway of the living room. His ears filled with the sounds of an action filled tv show. Peeping around the corner, Harry saw his relatives up close and personal for the first time in years. The rage quickly surfaced at the sight of the two males relaxing in their living rom. He tried his best to fight off the urge to go in with guns blazing, trying to keep his rational side above any other strong emotions.
The entire world quietened as Harry heightened all of his senses to be fully alert. Eyes were darting in every direction for any signs of danger or Drew. Something caught his attention from the corner of his left eye, a shimmer of a Disillusionment charm. He stayed still for a few seconds to see if there was any movement from the other, before he shot a nonverbal
The little boy's eyes widened and he suddenly burst into tears. Everyone remained frozen in front of the crying child, absolutely not knowing what to do. He cried louder and louder, making students turning in the corridor. He would have kept crying for a while if the blond girl, who was now in front of them, had not arrived. She was a blonde girl of fifteen or sixteen years old, according to Harry's deductions. She had the little one in her arms, who was slowly calming down. She then gave them a small smile before disappearing at the corner of the corridor. They finally arrived in front of the Great Hall. They came to their seats at the Gryffindor table, but as Harry lifted his leg to the other side of the bench, he was shoved by a Gryffindor who seemed to be in third year. He nearly fell but caught himself on Ron's shoulder. The boy wanted to continue on his way but an icy voice sounded throughout the great hall.
