Sleep well. Miss you.
“I thought about you so much without having a face in my mind’s eye,” you said when we were kissing there, looking out into the beautiful day and the rush of the rising tide. “Your words and the idea of writing to you never left my mind for even a minute.”
You murmured your consent, and I felt you spread your legs wider, welcoming me, exposing your sweet, beautiful pucker that I adore so very much, and I felt the last of my worries leave me.
Our professor came then and told us that we’d better get back to practising duelling. With you and Seamus gone, Dean and I teamed up. I know how much I suck at martial magic, but Merlin. For such a tall wizard, Dean is ridiculously quick with dodging spells. Did hardly stand a chance against him. I didn’t find a good opportunity to ask him anything about Seamus, though. I’m not sure whether he’d confide in me anyway. We only talked when the lesson was over and he saw me writing in my diary, remembering that it’s linked to yours.
Darling, I had such a good time. Flirting. Talking. Kissing. Our friends had ordered for us – the menu in the Broomsticks is pretty minuscule, I’ll give you that – and before long, our fish and chips were in front of us and the two of us dug in. I hadn’t realised just how famished I actually was. It was only as we were pushing our plates away and draining the last of the Butterbeer from our glasses that Ron made his announcement.
And so on, and so on. I’ll bring the
Then we lapsed into silence for a minute.
My lovely. I’m back in my bed, still buzzing a little bit from our interview.
Love, I saw how your home was no longer a place of safety, but was instead a place of terror and heartbreak, and I heard your thoughts, as clear as if you had spoken them. My future is void, you thought. My life has ended, and it hasn’t even begun. Tears pricked and stung, tears of impotent horror, but you didn’t even dare to let them fall. That would only have raised Voldemort’s wrath, and you couldn’t bear to see his punishment doled on your mother. He was a sadist, Draco, a psychopath, skilled at picking at the loose threads of your brain until he found the soft places of kindness that he could twist and manipulate, torturing you into near madness.
Not the sexy stuff – not that it wasn’t perfect – but just being with you. Cooking for you. I’d like to do that. I’d learn all the fancy dishes that you enjoyed, and I’d make them. Not for any reason. I’d do it just because I loved you. I’d rub your feet and your calves after you’d been on them all day. At night, I’d bury my head in the crook of your shoulder. The smell of your soap clean skin would fill my nostrils and then I’d go to sleep knowing I was luckier than any person had the right to be.
I did touch myself while you were telling me your story.
May I tell you that you gave me a very good idea about something you told me back in September? You wrote to me you were “always behind with your reading, hastily copying your homework before the start of lessons and bundling everything together at the last minute”. Even last week I didn’t quite want to believe you when you mused about your homework, not even sure whether there was any or not.
Love, can I confess a little thing, while we’re talking about last night? I didn’t have any idea that you could make yourself cum from putting your prick between another person’s thighs. Hardly the sex god you described in your entry, Draco darling.
Go to Italy as soon as you have the chance. On first sight, the Colosseum looks a bit underwhelming. There are other attractions much more imposing. BUT your friend is so right about the graffiti. And I tell you what: if you have a good sense for magic, Wards, and such, you can actually feel that the Colosseum has been a magic place once. So don’t just look from the outside but pay the weird Muggle ticket and enter the ranked areas. With a minor Disillusionment Charm, you might be lucky and get to the podium.
You said that you fear you might have provided evidence against Mother and I. I can assure you that this will hardly be the case. If you asked me, I should be rotting away in Azkaban. I haven’t only been sentenced because someone in my family was involved in Death Eater activity. I was sentenced for my very own crimes. I told you that I tried not to do anything at all as soon as everything went to the dogs – and Merlin knows I did try – but it wasn’t entirely possible.
“Oh yes! Listen to yourself. Preaching patience and acceptance! You’re nothing but a green, naïve schoolboy! You and Draco are both as bad as one another. Circe. If only the pair of you were correct.” Some of the heat left Narcissa’s voice, and I saw the smallest slump of her shoulders. “There is nothing, nothing that I want more than my son’s happiness but how can that arrive at your side, Harry Potter? You're the most famous wizard in England. Perhaps even the world.” Some unnameable emotion crossed her features. “Draco, a prideful, foolish boy, let the love he held for Lucius lead him down a dark path. The Dark Mark he wears on his arm can never be reversed, and his reputation never be salvaged. All I dearly wish, with whatever years I have left on this Earth, is to protect my son from further maltreatment! My only wish is for him to be safe. I failed to protect him from Lucius, but I’ll be damned if I cannot protect him from you.”
“Is that what I saw before? The slices of memories, are those the things you think of when casting a Patronus?” I wanted to tell you that you shouldn’t have been through such a thing at just thirteen years old, but I didn’t know how.
Fuck, sorry, I’m clearly… agitated. Give me a few minutes to make sense again. I love you so much.
Talking about courtship always reminds me of the most dated things I’ve learnt as a young lad. Tell me if you’re interested to hear about them. But keep in mind that they are awfully ridiculous and only sometimes a little romantic.
I think you and I were close to each other at the Quidditch. It might be nothing, but I could feel the oddest sensation of magic prickling my skin, close to where I had this diary shoved in my pocket. It wasn’t unpleasant, though – it felt protective, caring, safe – and similar to the way that the diary heats up whenever you write to me.
I love you. This afternoon was fun, wasn’t it? I thought that chaotic and brazen were two fabulous words to describe Sunday Quidditch in the Gryffindor common room, though I’ll have you know that today was demure compared to other matches I have listened to.
“Patience,” you admonished, pulling nearly all the way out before you pushed your fingers back inside of me. You did this for a few wonderful minutes, and I felt my brain grow blurred with every brush of my prostate. It wasn’t long before I was ready and acclimatised, and I gazed, eager and ready as you slicked up your prick and moved higher up on the bed.
With a flick of my wand, I banished both our clothes. And I’m sure I preened at your astonished gasp when you looked down at yourself, finding both our pricks at full attention. You pulled me close. While I kneaded my fingers up your nape and through your unruly hair, I felt your broad hands all over my back, my shoulders, my arse; your soft kisses on my chest and your hot tongue left wet trails across my skin. And Circe, it felt glorious. Have you ever heard about blokes complaining that their girls only want foreplay? They have no idea what they’re missing out on.
We will think of something. Let’s talk later about it – I have a few more things to reply to.
I just wanted to say thank you for today. Yes, there’s no two ways around it. I was nervous about travelling to Whitby and taking tea with your mother. She’s fantastically important to you, Draco, and she’ll always be an important part of our lives. It was all I wanted for everything to be right and good for you, love, and I think it was.
The pull and push of our kiss would remind our bodies of everything else we could share. I think that I’d moan, then, and make little noises that I couldn’t help.
Neither of us spoke, but we didn’t have to. Both of us knew what we wanted.
Please, my darling. Don’t be anxious. Don’t be nervous. I’m the one to dread what you can possibly think of me.
I’m sure that I must have been annoying, the way that I kept having to lean over to touch it but I still can’t get over it. It felt soft, like feathers. The longer hair really suits you. I’m not under the impression that you minded too much though. When you caught my hand, kissed my knuckles, and met my eyes, the rest of the world fell away.
All you did was smile and kiss me so gently. You didn’t laugh at my silly, ardent, adolescent lust. Instead, you told me that I was perfect, and that nothing that happened between us could ever be wrong. You suggested that you try on your formal robes for me, simply to give us both a couple of minutes to cool down.
Okay, wait. This brings me to the Yule Ball. Yes, Hermione looked exceptionally gorgeous, don’t get me wrong, but ‘stunning’ isn’t exactly the very first thing that comes to my mind when I’m thinking of her. Not an offense. But it reads like an offense, doesn’t it? Jesus Christ, it does. Whatever, you will get what I mean. Where was I?
So I withdrew. “Circe, you need to focus,” I said. “Only one memory. Try again.”
The careless exile that this precious book had to endure could certainly be due to the fact that it might have been unseen by our dear Walburga. I have no idea whether she had witnessed death first-hand or not, but the book, much like its spectral subject, is unseeable to those who are not familiar with our great equaliser in one or the other way. Pas de problème for you and I of course: whilst death is a distant acquaintance of mine, rumour has it that you became their master.
Even though I can remember a thousand occasions that I would have done with your fingers knotted into mine, and your encouragement in my ear, I couldn’t have borne it if you’d have gotten damaged or hurt along the way.
Merlin’s teeth, Draco! What potency, exactly, were those potions that Pomfrey gave you? I’m not certain that you didn’t get a double dose by mistake.
“I’m of sound mind,” I muttered in his direction, “and I’m of good character too, and you know full well that I’m aware of Draco’s legal history because it was my testimony that kept him and Narcissa Malfoy from serving a custodial sentence.”
Thank you for your wake-up message earlier. Is it terribly embarrassing to admit that I sleep with your diary beneath my pillow, my fingers searching for it the moment I first stir awake? Perhaps it is, but I don’t care. I keep it with me always.
Darling, of course it consisted of eighty percent sweets and twenty percent actual food. The evening was for you. But I had honestly no idea what else the House-Elves would prepare other than Treacle Tart and Cauldron Cakes which I insisted upon. But apparently, they remembered our requests for the fancy dinner we had just about two months ago, for these roasted red and golden beets were rather upscale. I’m dead sure the dressing was with balsamic vinegar and honey which is completely off limits for the usual Hogwarts feast. These lovely (and even to me very friendly) creatures simply adore you, Harry.
And yes, I want to experience everything life has to offer with you beside me.
You sniffed at that, but you didn’t let me go. “I’ve never known anything like this before,” you protested, “never known happiness like I’ve found in these four walls, and I wouldn’t survive without you.”
I love you too.
I think that we, as a family, needed to have the conversations that we did today. I’m of the impression that some of my Mother-in-Law’s thoughts and opinions are ones that – through no fault of her own – are going to be very difficult to change.
A tap of the official’s wand endorsed it, and as we all looked on, the document folded up, and vanished into thin air with a green sparkle of magic. I’m officially your chaperone, Draco, which means I can accompany you anywhere in the British Isles. I’m excited, my darling! This’ll open up so many horizons for both of us.
Every day was an exercise in dread. Snatchers were all over the countryside and yes, eventually we were caught too. That was one of the bleakest, most terrifying days of my life.
I’m sitting in the Library right now and I’m sure that I must have only missed you by minutes. Considering that the bell just rang and you’re usually five to ten minutes late to class, you must’ve just left this peaceful place, redolent of centuries-old books, parchment, and ink. Circe, the scent, and the silence make me drowsy today…
Two more things: firstly, thanks for wanting to help Theo. Secondly, care for a jog tomorrow morning?
Oh darling, I think I had under-egged the pudding a little bit when I described the state of the place. I’d only been down there once before today, and I’d forgotten what a deathtrap the basement is.
Whitby Abbey. That building is one of my most vivid recollections of the two days that I stayed in the town.
To cut a long story short, Madam Pince spied what I was doing, and glided over to help me, which I have to admit, was perfect timing. The thing was, some of the course titles at St Mungo’s sounded incredibly intimidating, love. Maybe not for geniuses like you, and ‘Mione and Nott, but ‘Neurobiology of the Magical Brain’ and ‘Biology of Magical Organisms’ sounded very tough indeed.
So to make things short and clear: It pleases me very much that you think I’m fit, of serene beauty even. I love sex talk and I love knowing that it’s you I’m having these randy talks with. And as for everything outside the diary, I’m feeling certain that we’ll figure it out. We will show or tell each other if there’s anything we don’t want. I will try not to pretend anything.
Hearing about your concerns made me realise that I have no idea about bonding or weddings apart from traditional pureblood ceremonies.
Well, neither of us realised that we were dozing off right after, did we? But this morning when we were rushing to get dressed enough to run off into our respective dormitories to have a quick shower before classes, you remembered our post-orgasm-conversation perfectly fine, much to my surprise.
Hermione looked ridiculously pleased all the while. Love, I met her when we both were on our way to the library earlier today. We talked for a few minutes before we studied, sitting next to each other. You mean so much to her and you’re absolutely right about her. She does have a big heart. Only her brain is bigger than her heart.
Please, do come to the Library, love. We’ll get this sorted out. We’ll find where your mum has gone. It’s bound to be a mistake or some sort of misunderstanding.
Merlin, listen to us! Making plans for a ceremony that will hardly take place while we still haven’t finished our N.E.W.T.s. I haven’t mentioned it before, but I felt really flattered that you thought about my probation in one breath with our idea to bond. May sound unromantic to some; to me it sounds very rational and practical. I love that side of you just as much as the sentimental Sturm and Drang poet that you are.
You forget how bloody liberating it is to be up there, high above the rest of the world. It’s the best part of being a wizard. A far better method of travel than Apparition, anyway. I’ve never been quite able to get over that awful giddy, wobbly feeling that flips your belly over. I feel a bit jelly legged even talking about it.
They were in the same year at Hogwarts and the same House besides. I often wonder when their friendship turned to something more, whether it was a sudden awareness between them, or whether they found their love over months and years. I’d love to know what their first real date was, or where they shared their first kiss. The pair of them never got the chance to kiss in front of The Eiffel Tower or ride in a gondola, but they did, at least, have me. If I can honour that, make them proud, then that's enough for me.
I truly am every bit as chivalrous as the reputation that precedes me. Outside of these pages that we share, I won’t mention our diary, or the pages and pages of words that we’ve shared with one another this year.
You said just before that you sit in silence with your Mind Healer, staring in different directions.
But anyhow, mentioning the train actually led me to your question a few pages before and you also reminded me earlier today that I haven’t replied yet. Well, I do want you to go to Paris and get some of that money from Gringotts sometime during the Easter hols.
Now, this particular pal of mine. I'm going to tell you a bit about them. They’ve always had their eyes on the prize. Even when they were young – and I'm talking eleven! – they knew exactly what they wanted, and the exact steps to go about achieving those things. Currently they’ve got their heart set on a brilliant, shining career and they know exactly how to get there.
We’d have whole worlds to explore, but most importantly, I’d wish to help you make this inherited house of yours a home. Your first true home which is not filled with nosy students and annoying teachers. Safe and cosy. A nice place to make new memories and to start a life after this dark era and the nerve-racking N.E.W.T.s.
“Either must die at the hands of the other because neither can live while the other survives.” That was the prophecy and Dumbledore decided my destiny. I had to die. I had to walk into those bloody woods, and I sacrifice myself to a fucking prophecy, spoken when I was not even a baby.
Your sleuthing has netted us a few extra clues as well. Dean is blatantly besotted with Seamus if he was as panicked after the incident in DADA as you described. I know that if there was even a hint of you being injured then there wouldn’t be a force on earth that could keep me from being by your side. I’m glad you’ve not chosen a hazardous profession, Draco Malfoy, because I’d be forced to fellate you for hours each morning to stop you going to work.
Don’t laugh, but I’m a little afraid I’ll feel this intoxicated by you forever and then I’ll simply never get anything done, ever again. There’ll be nothing else for it, my dear: we’ll have to graduate from Hogwarts and then spend the whole of the next century in our bed. What do you think? We can get up to shower occasionally, and have an owl to deliver us food, but otherwise I’m not sure there’s anything else I want to dedicate my life to.
My mind was filled with images of our night in the Astronomy tower. It’d been purgatory, sheer purgatory we didn’t touch for a whole twenty-four hours. Not a single kiss, not a brush of our fingers and not even the feeling of your leg pressed against mine when we sat together in our lessons. Somewhere along the line I’ve become dependent on having you close, and I never even realised. Of course, you forbidding me to wank only pushed the craving directly to the forefront of my mind.
Please tell your mother that I mentioned the Girding Potion to Braithwaite and that he seemed to perk up at the idea. I’d hazard a guess that much of the same literature kept in your Manor are the same books collected in St Mungo’s Research Library. The Healer is going to examine a few of the more arcane texts, and then owl message me in the new year, so fingers crossed for good news.
Your voice still resounds in my mind when I think about that day, love. Thank you for your patience with Mother. I hope that seeing her tipsy, gossiping with Andi about all the Muggle-cut festive robes, and – most importantly – dancing with her, all at our bonding reception, was worth the effort you advanced towards her. I saved this until now, but right after Hermione snatched you from her on the dancefloor, Mother told me with almost indecently flushed cheeks, “But how handsome your Harry looks tonight, Draco darling. He’s not much of a dancer, but he’s such a dishy gentleman.”
I haven’t thought this through. You can’t love me. I feel like I’ve betrayed you. I should’ve told you my name the very moment I first suspected you might start to fancy the boy on the other end of this diary.
What you said then, about the bigotry that was forced on us. This may perhaps be the one thing that’s different for the both of us. You sound like you fought for your ideals during the war, may those be yours or just ideas that were forced on you. And that’s exactly how I grew up – my family’s ideals always on the tip of my tongue without stopping to think about them.
I’m a little wired for very obvious reasons and I’m not sure that I’ll be able to sleep for another couple of hours so, if you don’t mind, I’d like to talk to you. My mind has unscrambled enough now to give you the sensible and (hopefully) reasonably articulate reply that your long letter merits.
You must excuse my wordy remarks on this. I just think that it’s the most adorable thing ever: you, picking up words I use all the time. Did you ever realise that I managed to not curse ‘Salazar’ when we still wrote anonymously? I only ever heard Slytherins use it, and I thought it would have been suspicious. Now my perfect, Gryffindorish fiancé uses it. I’m enchanted.
If I had just a trifle of decency in me, I’d tell you to walk away from me. I can’t though – not even that. I bloody can’t.
When you suddenly broke the kiss, stopping me with a hand on my chest and worrying your lip, I first thought that I might have missed a problem in my plan. You looked so worried suddenly and opened and closed your mouth without actually speaking your mind, which is not very typical of you, love.
Try to find a minute to send me a few words before four o’clock tomorrow, even if it is only a line.
Wow. I’m so flattered that my words had that particular effect on you.
articles with my own two eyes. I saw the disgraceful, scandalous display that you pulled when you received your Order of Merlin. I saw the pair of you, kissing and embracing for all the world to see.” Your Mother pursed her lips with distaste. “And I knew, there and then, that what the pair of you were involved in was more than a mere infatuation.” She knotted her fingers together and stared hard in my direction. “It was obvious, simply from the way that my son looked at you in those photographs, that he loves you deeply. A mother always knows these things. I’d already known the strength of Draco’s partiality back at Christmas, when he’d waxed so lyrically about his committed relationship with his unknown correspondent. Merlin. My heart broke, for I knew that no good would come of your pairing, not in the end, and I do fear that I’ve been proved right. The newspapers are already rather brimming with vitriol, aren’t they?”
Of course, the ancient old hearth jumped into roaring flame, and we both leapt back, snorting with shock and laughter.
Oh, my love, this is what I want forever: you and I with each other, experiencing the passing of seasons and years, knowing that whatever else is changing in the rest of our lives, our love remains constant and unchanged, the foundations that we build our lives upon.
Still being a sap, though: I’ve been waiting for a well enough occasion to tell you something. You told me weeks ago that you thought that your ex might have found you lacklustre. You also keep on calling yourself gauche and thick, but you’re none of that.
“Duly noted,” I answered. “Three things that I’d tell myself, nine months ago?” I thought for a moment. “First, you’ve just been through the most significant, frightening period of your whole life. It’s alright to be angry with the world. Being the Chosen One wasn’t your choice, and it’s okay to grieve for everything you’ve lost. You don’t have to be brave, every moment of the day.” I wrapped my arms around you and rested my chin on your shoulder. “And I’d tell him that the rest of his life is his for the taking. Just because you planned to be an Auror, and live the life other people planned for you, doesn’t mean you have to do it. I’d tell him that his life was his own.” I watched Ron and Hermione nod in agreement, and took in the faces of the schoolmates, good people that I loved like a family. “Finally, I’d tell him to keep an open heart. Sometimes the love we need is waiting where we least expect it.”
For Harry there was simply no other choice for his plus-one at the Order of Merlin ceremony when he was presented with his medal. “There wasn’t another person in the world that I wanted beside me,” Harry stated, looking very much like a man entirely in love. “Draco has made me truly content for the first time since the war. Draco’s brought joy into my life.”
Yes, I am Harry James Potter. You’ve caught me, bang to rights! Shall we do all my names while we’re on the subject and get them out the way? Hero. Saviour. Chosen One. The Boy Who Lived. What about my being the third part of the Golden Trio? The last is a new one that the
I’m sitting in the open window in the study that overlooks the overgrown garden, and I’m glad that we decided not to bother with this area of our home for even one minute during the Easter hols. There’d be much too much for us to do if we tried to get the house clean and tidy – we’d have been busy until McGonagall would have owled us a Howler for skipping our N.E.W.T. exams.
She gave me all the normal mumbo-jumbo talk about how I've lost my loved ones, and how I'm suffering from post-traumatic stress, but what she basically said was not to pressure you. She reminded me that you might be feeling love-bombed. Is that right? Sometimes I can be much. Hermione said that I needed to give you time, and so I did. I’ve let you be, but I can’t, not anymore.
Ron grinned, knowing full well that he wasn’t getting a free pass. “Truth,” he said, leaning back on the palms of his hands. “The last few years have been far too full of bloody daring for me. I’m not scaling the roof or stealing McGonagall’s dressing gown. I know I won't get expelled, but I don't want to die, not on my last night.”
Sounds like your lot is a bunch of overprotective Hufflepuffs. Look, I’m not a reliable source when it comes to friendships. Used to have some allegiances but I’m on my own now. What I do know is that I’d be fucking furious if they’d been meddling with my school business and career choices. You said you ran away like a petulant first year but I get your point. I don’t know who thought we’d come back and be able to put up with school in the first place. I’m so bloody sick of this cursed castle and the professors speaking about our N.E.W.T.s and all the rejoicing Hogwarts students waltzing about the halls and preaching inter-house unity. And don’t even get me started on these bloody dormitories. Is it too much to ask for some peace and quiet in the common room I’ve known for years? Everything is so fucking fraught with friction and misjudgement and memories. Must they pen us in like this?
See you in the afternoon.
I mean, I knew something was wrong the minute that we entered the Hall for breakfast. All those barely concealed sniggers, and half-heard whispers.
“I always knew that you’d find your way to each other’s side eventually, and wasn’t this way so much more enjoyable? Soulmates always discover each other, Harry.” I didn’t know what to say to that, but all she did was take my hands in hers and give them a light squeeze. “My dad and I? We’ve always believed in you. It’d be an honour to tell Draco’s and your love story to the world.”
Theo huffed out a sigh when we sat down on his bed. And don’t you worry, my darling, this one is straight as a wand. “I wish I could go there,” he said, his brows furrowing. “I can hardly abide the idea that she’s not living her best life. Do you think she misses me?”
Harry, what have I got myself into? I suck at Defence. I’d hazard a guess that not even your extraordinary reputation as a patient teacher will change that.
“Seamus,” I said, feeling my heart shatter a little at his story. “I’m so, so sorry. I – none of us – ever had a clue.”
You’ve shared such wonderful stories with me, stories of your childhood and your birthday cakes that always tasted of lemons, dancing at the Yule Ball and visiting the Colosseum. Compared to me, I feel like you’ve lived two lives. I’ve swallowed every detail and then begged you for more. I've ached for the pictures that your words created in my mind.
him and guided Palmer to the hospital wing delivering them into the capable hands of Pomfrey.
To tell the truth, the idea that you’re actually sitting somewhere outside of my drawn curtains with your diary in your lap is more than a little intimidating. I hope that I can make this a more enjoyable evening than if you’d attended the Ball itself.
I did have Muggle Studies today and my heart feels oddly warm to know that you were in the back of the Charms room when I was sitting there, listening to traditions I had no clue existed in the country I’ve grown up in. Feels weird. And I feel even more so like a bloody bigot when I think about how ignorant I was. I shall try to do better now.
There was nobody around though, and so I furtively picked up a couple of booklets about St. Mungo’s that were sandwiched between large texts about working in the Unspeakable Office and being an Alchemist (is that a job? Can people really turn straw into gold?)
What I do remember, though, is that you asked me whether you did well with Occlumency as well. “You were brilliant,” I told you. “Seeing the light of your Patronus, the memory – it’s probably the closest I will ever get to this magnificent charm.”
As for a family: I’m the very last heir on the line. That’s because Father didn’t have any siblings. As far as pure-blood genealogy is concerned, Mother’s side of the family tree isn’t as important. When we don’t think in these blue terms, there’s some more family. My Grandparents were old, all of them deceased. I had two older first cousins once removed who both died rather young men. My aunt and my only cousin both died in the War. There were rumours about a pregnancy, though. I might have a younger first cousin once removed, but I’m not entirely sure on that. Another aunt is still alive, but she has never been on speaking terms with Mother.
Tonight was fun, wasn’t it? The last party that we’ll have at Hogwarts and the very first one that I’ve actually enjoyed. I mean,
But I digress. What I meant to tell you about are the Sectumsempra scars. I want to warn you and your guilt-complex, should you ever find yourself in the gifted position to get a glimpse of my imperfectly appealing torso. Please, Harry – we both know that it was an accident, so don’t apologise. But there are some notable scars hidden underneath my smooth robes. And quite honestly – vain as I’ve been before – I think I look rather wicked with them. Adds some character.
Did you like it, Harry? Please be frank with me. You were so quiet, huddled beside me. I feel a bit sappy for talking about ancestors in the night sky, talking to you about astronomy and the House of Black naming traditions like I was your grandfather.
The game moved on quickly, but I felt the gentle dip of your body pressing into mine. I knew that Ron’s words had meant a lot. Every eye was trained on the spinning wand, following it towards its next quarry. It felt inevitable when it landed on Seamus. He laughed, accusing Hemione of wandless magic, but she deflected the situation. “Everyone knows that wands have a mind of their own,” she said primly. “Now what’ll be? Truth or dare?”
Harry Potter is to be presented with a First-Class Order of Merlin in February.
The topic of the day is, of course, Dean and Seamus. I have to admit, I’m a little impressed by the two of us. We’re an incorrigible pair of cupids, and it would seem from what you told me earlier that you’ve pulled Ron and Hermione into the conspiracy too.
I will come find you now and interrupt whatever you’re doing with our lovely owls. I’m going to ask you to explain to me how exactly soil acidity is related to plant ingredients. I’ll blow you if you can answer me. And if you can explain how the waning moon influences the sulfur levels in forest soils and which plants should exclusively be picked under the unobstructed light of the waning moon, then I will give you five minutes to recover from the BJ and have you against the next best wall.
calls me Harry. When my godson starts to talk, he’ll call me Harry and even the Professors usually call me by my given name. Seeing it written, in those twisty letters that you write makes my heart hurt.
You’ll have to excuse my horrible handwriting, but I’ve got my diary on my knee, and I’m supposed to be revising the effects of different brewing time for the Draught of Living Death. I’m not rightly sure what difference the different brewing times actually makes: you die nevertheless, be it faster or slower.
Three days until it’s the day of our superb non-Ball. Talk before?
Reading your words from yesterday got me quite sappy as you can see. Your words when you wrote away while watching me sleep were so reverent, Harry, so full of love. I wouldn’t have believed, only a while ago, that it’d be possible that someone would look at me like you do.
Christmas is a difficult time for me, truth be told. The Muggles that brought me up used to use the opportunity to have a big, pretentious party where they’d drink multicoloured cocktails, and do their damnedest to impress my uncle’s business associates.
Draco, when I saw you in that filthy, sodden bathroom, weeping and broken, I ought to have tried to help you. Instead, I cut you into shreds, using a spell that, for all I’d known, could have killed you there and then. I was a reckless, judgmental fool, as cruel as Voldemort in that moment, and hardly the force of good that has been so claimed since.
You will always use the cutlery on the outside of the table setting first and then progress inwards with each course. So if you find a spoon on the furthest right-hand side, you know that there will be soup for the first course.
“Draco is more than the sum of his past,” I answered, your mother’s words ringing in my ears. I couldn’t accept her vision of your life, hidden away from the world. “And whether that’s with or without me, he still deserves a full, happy future.”
I apologised for my mindlessness with a squeeze of your hand and asked if you would be willing to Side-Along us. “St John’s Wood – ever been there?” You shook your head. “Doesn’t matter. You Apparate us a bit further northwest from here. Just let me take over while we’re Apparating, and I’ll lead the way. Think we can do that without Splinching?”
I love you, more so with every day that passes. I’m counting the days until I see your face and know you for who you truly are.
“I didn’t mean to…” you signalled to the fireplace, but quickly surrendered the gesture, your hands dropping into your lap. “Fuck, but I haven’t felt my magic like this in a while. That was strange.”
Glynis and Mother showed us the back garden. On Yuletide, I didn’t bother to have as much as a glimpse behind the house, but I was stunned by all the colourful tulips and hyacinths. I would have loved to sit there with you for hours on end, on the bench at the white little fountain.
My left hand is on my prick as I write this, but I can’t wait to have both hands. I’ll Levitate our book. Will
Usually, I rush the process of washing, anxious to be getting on with my day, but today I made myself take my time. I allowed the rivulets of heated water to run through my dark, knotty mane and over all the scars, hollows and thick hair of my body. I soaped myself clean, and fresh, and I couldn’t believe how much I enjoyed every minute of the process. I finally practiced the self-care that my Mind Healer is always banging on about. I took time to just exist in the moment.
Seamus seemed to accept that and I felt things lighten a bit between us. After all, Seamus has always been a good mate and that plan of mine was half-baked to say the least.
Thank you for the special day yesterday. I still can’t believe that Weasley appears to be such a romantic kind of fellow. Excuse my opinionated self, but even though I know Ron much better than I used to, I still lowkey thought him to be this Quidditch talking, meat and potatoes kind of bloke, know what I mean? I had no idea that he’s good at chess, remembers conversations about romance, and that he’s the one pulling Hermione into kisses all the time and not the other way around.
Salazar, but when you massaged my arsehole? Did you feel how my whole body shuddered with every brush of your fingers? Every nerve ending was sensitive, and so quick to respond to you. Your lewd suggestions are playing on a loop in my mind. I think that you must have been made entirely for my pleasure, Draco, made entirely for my delectation. You say that I looked like an Adonis, or a sex god? Well, I thought you looked like a fallen angel, fell to earth and stripped of their wings.
My darling boy. I’m here, wrapped up in my sheets, thinking back over our afternoon, and I cannot get over what a brilliant wizard you are.
Thank you for your brilliant letter. I don’t mind admitting that I’m glad I know where you’re staying and that you’re safe.
Alright. Bedtime. Real life beckons tomorrow (exam practice in Transfiguration) and then I’ve committed to tutoring a couple of the fourth-years in DADA (don’t ask – Saviour Complex strikes again) after school.
I dare believe that I see both. And that’s why I’m so scared. You’ve been through so much and I can’t abide the idea of adding to it. That’s why I would’ve been more careful. I would’ve thought twice about telling you about my feelings so hastily, had I known about the entirety of sorrow you’ve suffered through. Don’t try to downplay that.
Perhaps, I blushed or looked funny because she just smiled and offered me one of her biscuits before she dismissed me. I can’t believe this witch sometimes. I think she’s my favourite professor. By far.
A great big part of me wanted to tell you my name after your last letter. I nearly asked you to meet me in the Astronomy Tower at the end of today. My friend – whom I’ve opened up a little to now, and even told that I'm gay – said that I ought to be brave. “Seize the dragon by the horns,” were her words, in the most irritatingly forthright voice.
You’re going to need to be decent at potions, because when you’re making house calls to clients, and visiting the businesses that you’re trading with, you’re going to be the face of your business. Oh, Draco. I’m trying not to get too excited but I feel like it might be a losing battle. If what Mulvaney said today was right – and why wouldn’t it be, that’s his bloody job! – then I see your future beginning to open up. I can see tiny splinters of light. Sorry. I’m grinning like a total prat. You are too, darling. Just a tiny little curl at the edges of your mouth. It is terribly handsome.
We’re all about honesty, aren’t we, sweetheart and I got a sense that you’re getting entirely and wholeheartedly shit-bloody-terrified about the various friends and relations that we’ve committed to visiting.
Me, I was always behind with my reading, hastily copying my homework before the start of lessons and bundling everything together at the last minute. Do you have lofty job ambitions for when you’ve finished school? Is that why you worry so much about grades? Maybe you’ve got the sort of parents that hover about you, sending you Howlers whenever your marks drop.
You looked gorgeous at breakfast Draco. All pink-cheeked, soap-clean and delectable. I hope you didn’t mind me coming and sitting down next to you. The whole bench took a collective breath – did you notice? – but when I looked around not one of them dared to meet my eye. Having a reputation is useful, I think, every so often. I swear, McGonagall quirked a smile in our direction.
Okay, thanks for ending this on a note that evoked genuine laughter. From my immediate reply, you probably figure that I’ve been reading along as you were writing. This is a lot to take in, but I can’t emphasise enough how glad I am that we’re talking about all of it. Your words, once again, help me understand several things.
I’m not going to, though. Five more minutes in bed. That's all I want. I'll pretend to my kind hostess that I’m a heavy sleeper, but really, I’m going to touch myself once more. My prick is stiff and sensitive against the sheets and I’m warm… I’m so very warm.
If you are worried about Mother, let me tell you something. We’re both wizards. Your paternal line had been cast out of the Sacred Wizarding Families. Your mum is Muggleborn. New money, for Salazar’s sake! And again, we’re both wizards. I think Mother won’t be picky about the details of the bonding ceremony. You aren’t exactly a candidate who she’d expect to follow any traditional etiquette.
P.S. I know it’s silly, but I was too nervous to ask directly before. Do you want children one day?
Can I tell you a secret? When I read Theo’s words, and he’d asked whether we’d run away for a secret bonding, a tiny part of me wished that it was true, that we’d made our vows last night. Maybe it’s fanciful – perhaps you’ll laugh, but when we embraced at the moment of the Equinox, our pricks hard and full and our mouths fervent for one another’s, I was sure that I experienced my magic entwining with yours, twisting and coiling in the air around us, encouraging and egging us on to make that full commitment to each other. Had you asked me to make a bond last night, I wouldn’t have wanted to wait for our families. I would have given myself over to you, spiritually, and physically too. I love you.
I’m struggling to process the news, as you can no doubt tell. I'm sorry.
I had such a brilliant time this evening, lazing about on the settees in the common room. I ought to have been revising potions – both you and Hermione managed to remind me separately – but my mind was already swimming with brew times, active ingredients and magical properties, and I know if I tried to cram any more facts and figures into my brain, they would just come slip sliding right out of my ear.
I felt my skin goosebump with eagerness as I straddled your hips and let my hands coast over your beautiful body. I traced my fingers over your Sectumsempra scars and across their raised edges. They’re a gorgeous - and yes, very wicked looking - part of you, love, and another part of our interweaving stories.
I lead your hand then, following one of the lines of the Cassiopeia constellation. “See those, the very faint set of stars below? That’s Andromeda.”
I grew up believing that I deserved such rough treatment because I knew nothing other than what I was told! Children are blank slates, and their ideas and opinions are created by those who bring them up. (Don’t rack your brains and try to remember Hogwarts gossip. I didn’t tell a soul about my horrible childhood bar my two best friends and I swore them both to secrecy.)
You see, during the time that You-Know-Who frequented the Manor, the nights felt all but safe. Especially so after sixth year.
I’ve been racking my brains. About your request. And what kind of fiancé would it make me if I didn’t give my everything to come up with ideas for places where two young hearts like ours could indulge in some proper cock- and arse-worshipping?
I missed you today.
I know that I sounded like a complete nutcase. But you looked at me for a long moment, your secure grip on my arm never relenting. Your expression was knowing and far too bitter for your young, usually so happy and open face.
I wouldn’t care about any of your other probation regulations either. We could work through whatever the world threw at us. It wouldn’t matter if you had to stay in the UK or even if you had to put up with unannounced visits. Is there no way that your case could be appealed? Sorry, maybe this insults you, or you feel like I’ve stepped over the line, but I want to support you. I meant it, you know, when I said that I loved you.
It’s not healthy for little witches and wizards to be educated by their mums or by their Governesses (was that your experience?) and only be allowed to socialise with the children their parents think are suitable companions. It isn't natural.
I wanted to say that, of course he can, but that didn't ring helpful. So instead, I said, "Use a good enough excuse. It's the night of the Spring Equinox."
I ought to have practiced better selfcare this morning and asked a friend to accompany me. Do you know why I got myself in such a state? Because with you, I’ve finally found my future and I don’t want to endanger that.
My thoughts always come back to the fact that she told you about her initial plans to retrieve the ring and offer it in exchange for you to break up with me. There was no need to tell you and she bloody well knew how you would take such information. After everything she’s said before – either Mother wants your trust, or she mentally just accepted you as family. I have no bloody clue, Harry.
Talking to two people who demand to glimpse into your soul and into the deepest corners of your very well-Occluded brain is quite an experience.
Nobody in my life has ever described me as thoughtful, kind or pleasant before. I’ve had a fair number of compliments chucked at my head in my time, but no one had ever taken the time to get to know me, not in the way that you have done. If any of those wonderful attributes are true, then it’s because your company and attention has brought them to the surface.
, or something equally icky – though of course, I’ll do no such thing.
That said, perhaps being approachable will be a useful trait when I’m a Mind Healer. I knew it was crucial that I didn’t pressure Seamus to say more than he was ready for. Often, the most successful sessions I've had the ones where my Mind Healer has simply let me talk, and barely interrupted.
I don’t know why Mother didn’t request Glynis’s help, perhaps she – bloody hell, sod off and mind your own business, Nott! Sorry, I’m right outside the common room right now. I’ll be here, waiting for you.
So yes. I’ve been trying to make you forget about me by manipulating you. I don’t have to tell you that my last two letters were a big fib and only small parts of them were truthful. I’ve been trying to ignore you because you told me that you tend to fall in love with anyone that pays you attention. I’ve also been emphasising parallels between me and my father, and I even tried mentioning your Muggle relatives, in a desperate attempt to make you hate me.
“Please,” I moaned. “I need you.”
“It became noticeable quickly that my friend and I had very different upbringings,” Draco explained, holding tight to Harry’s finger, “but rather than giving us less to talk about, that gave us more subjects of conversation. Harry wasn’t ever judgmental about my past, but instead seemed fascinated. Of course, that only spurred me on to talk more! We quickly got to the point where we couldn’t get enough of each other.” Draco’s and Harry’s eyes met at this point and the pair of them smiled shyly. “And before we knew it, we were falling in love with each other. I mean, had it have been anyone else I’d have laughed at their naivety. But sharing our diaries, and then our lives? It felt as natural as a charm. It barely seemed to take any time at all.”
Never will this beautiful pocket watch be a retrieved heirloom from Mother’s side of my family to me, Harry. No matter what you think, for me it’s a precious gift that I received through your hands only. An heirloom from your ancestors, blood-related or not. It’s a proper courtship gift, really.
“Well, seeing that he’s writing to his Death Eater fiancé’s Slytherin friend, they might have that.”
In my mind I’m straddling you and the mere idea makes lust curl through my abdomen. I wouldn’t get enough of your hands on my body, and I’d make it up to you that it’s my skin you’re touching and not your own cock. I’d jerk you. I’d jerk us both. And I bet you’d make all kinds of delicious noises, being caught underneath me and with your pleasure in my hands. The grip around our pricks would be deliciously tight. I’d watch your face, listen to your moans. I’d find out exactly what you like, and I’d repeat it until you squirm underneath me.
Oh darling, but it was lovely. “Good morning,” you said when you woke, your voice all husky, soft with sleep. You stretched your arms around me and smiled, a lazy, happy thing.
“Don’t worry,” you assured me, learning over to press a long, sweet kiss upon my lips. I’d have deepened it – Merlin, but I tried – but you pulled away. Your grey eyes were bright and searching. “I love you, and I trust you. I know you’re thinking about Snape, but our old Potions master? There were a million other thoughts, twisting through his brain. A million wishes, and unrequited dreams.” You looked at me, ever so gentle and unquestioning. “You’d never, ever hurt me, Harry. It isn’t in your nature.” Then your mouth twisted into the most gorgeous of small smirks. “Besides,” you added. “I’m very, very good at Occlumency. You won’t see anything that I don’t want to show you.”
He grabbed hold of my robes and pulled me back behind the bookshelves, so hard that I nearly stumbled.
Maybe I will talk a bit more about my childhood to you, but not today. Today, with the last of the glacial fresh air in my lungs, my relations and my childhood feel about a million miles away, which is exactly where I would love them both to stay. Perhaps that is what being an adult is really about? Choosing not to have negative, damaging people in your life anymore.
Brace yourself, Harry. You will have to tell me all about it later. I need all the details on that. And, no, I don’t care that I sound like a prat.
At least all the revision is beginning to pay off. I saw how proud you were when I was able to explain Golpalott’s Third Law to Slughorn without referring to my notebook yesterday. Don’t worry: you schooled your face very smoothly, straight afterwards. That was the reason I squeezed your hand so tightly afterwards.
It wasn’t until I began to turn the pages that I felt my good mood start to vanish. It would seem that bearing every aspect of our lives to public scrutiny is what passes for good journalism, and I felt your grip on my hand tighten as details of your probation were explained in crude and inflammatory language.
The head of my hard prick lining up with your entrance alone caused a frisson of arousal in me. I felt clumsy for needing a few tries, my love, but once the head of my cock found the perfect angle and the perfect pressure, my prick slid so perfectly into you, and also so much deeper than I intended at first.
Pomfrey told me to stop reading the diary and to sleep or at least rest. She also wanted me to have some more of the potion – it’s called Draft of Thought Diversion – when I didn’t immediately put the diary away, but I refused to take it, obviously. I need to keep a clear head.
“Your wish is my command,” I murmured, wrapping my arms around your waist and pulling you up so that our faces were only inches away from each other. I could see the tiny droplets of water on your jaw, and your hair, darkened by the water, seemed to glow gold. “Shower, yes. Kreacher, no. Reckon I’ve got it.”
By Absence this good means I gain,
But first, let me tell you how good it was to see you this morning, delighted as you were. “You’re so smart. And always thinking so practical,” you said between kisses, sneaking your arms beneath my outer robes and pulling me close. But Circe, what I said about you being a cute dolt? You did prove me right on that.
Theo nodded. “Yes. It only started before everything went pear-shaped, mere weeks before the battle. I tried with a gift, and she rejected it. Well, that’s what she said, except that she kept it. She complained how dreadfully old-fashioned I was and how her own quill works perfectly fine. ‘Better step up your game’ – that’s what she told me. But I saw her using the quill in class anyway. And so I… I tried again, and we kissed a few times.”
“That’s the art of elocution, my love. Leave out some details and use some smart terms, et voilà – you sound like an intellectual gentleman with an acquired taste.”
The knocker glowed with strange mauve magic and then he spoke. “What is always in front of you?” he asked, “and yet cannot be seen?”
I did, though, and I hope you saw his face as well. There was not a hint of pride or joy. All I saw was quite a grave bitterness after the first shock (of course he was shocked, oblivious prat). Embarrassment, perhaps. Anyhow, when I saw his face, I kind of wished someone had casted a quick Muffliato for him to shut out the applause. Maybe some solid Wards to stop those gullible brutes from slapping his back.
The truth is, I've read our whole diary back to myself, and I think that I have withheld more than you ever have.
The moment Mother and I came to stand right in front of each other was quite nerve-racking for some reason. There was this short second when we simply stared at each other, and I felt uneasy from all the expressions that switched through her blue eyes. She must’ve been immensely worried about me. It was like she couldn’t quite believe I was alive. She took my hands then and I kissed her cheek very much like I’d usually do, as though we hadn’t been apart for far too long, in lack of an appropriate greeting. However could I have shown how much I missed her? How worried I’ve been for her? Nothing I could’ve done or said felt adequate.
There’s something I need to talk about, something I didn’t want to mention over our wonderful dinner.
Best for last: This blowjob gets you quite excited, doesn’t it? I’ll gladly keep you on the edge, though. I will talk about it in all detail. But only with some Firewhisky and the bliss of your unrendered opinions in the form of a more fluid conversation in the night of our non-Ball. From what you said about ex-lovers, Shakespeare, and your anatomy, I daresay that you are about to like what you’ll hear.
I couldn’t help but cut in.
I have to admit, drafting the speech during the final period of the day was definitely one of ‘Mione’s more exceptional ideas. The younger students were still in their lessons and most of the rest of our Eighth Year were outside, watching Quidditch practice on the pitch.
I will lock the control-freak-side of me away for now and go see my beautiful, understanding, loving intended for dinner.
But once we both recovered from convulsing in laughter, I thought I’d rather try to show you. I will admit now that I didn’t have a clue whether this would work or not, but I tried anyway. “House magic does things like this, of course,” I said, (hopefully) summoning my impressive air of competence and authority and concentrated my eyes on the fireplace.
I don’t just feel like this in the bedroom either. There aren't any topics that feel taboo, or any part of me that I feel I have to be ashamed of. You’re right, too. I have lived a sheltered existence, and it’s only with you that I’ve begun to bloom. Art, music, posh tea, French pastries… You name it, and I’m a void, hungry to be filled. Like yesterday, at the café? I’d have walked away, quick as you like, fearful that one of the waiters might have said something.
Some time ago, I told you that my heart sometimes starts racing because of the most ridiculous things. The Healer said that it’s too early to tell from just one session but that it sounds like I panic when I’m afraid to lose control over a situation. Sounds about right to me, even though I’ve never seen it from that perspective.
In fact, you might be the most thoughtful, kind, and pleasant company I’ve ever had.
I just read your reply – oh Harry, I was so moved by your words.
After a few minutes of walking in the sun, raising our voices over the few but still quite obnoxious automobiles, we reached our destination: a pavilion right at a garden that was blooming with narcissi, crocuses, and snowbells. The café inside wasn’t as dreadfully prim and posh as you had dreaded, now was it, love?
Okay then. Don’t laugh at me for frantically scribbling away like a Second Year Lockhart fangirl because I received a letter from my Mother. But I simply didn’t know where she was since I last saw her and I couldn’t reach her via owl (sorry, can’t explain that either). It’s all good now, though, or as good as it gets these days anyway. She’s the only family I have and not being able to exchange even a few lines just added stress on top of everything.
I know, you’re rolling your eyes at my lack of originality, but the words were so perfect. “I’m in a committed relationship with a wizard” were the first words out of my mouth after Edward’s gran had served me a slice of Shepherd’s pie, and I honestly thought the lovely dear would keel over in astonishment.
Draco, when my evidence was taken from me I was exhausted and I wasn’t well.
I do so love you xx
“It’s from Pansy,” you said, gazing at the seal. “She’s written back.”
I want to talk about you. I was thinking: perhaps you could pursue potions as a career? Your probation sounds awfully restrictive, and I imagine that might make working in a traditional nine-five job a little challenging.
You said that her lot will perhaps stop talking to you. I haven’t asked about your mates recently. How do you get along with Crusade-Wix or Shining-Career-Pal these days? Did your ex get them, or did you get to keep them after the breakup? Is her brother at Hogwarts, by the way? I haven’t seen anyone with a black eye lately, which might mean that he isn’t. Keeping an eye out for that, though. Better learn a good spell or two to vanish bruises or they might expose you.
In that moment, Draco, all that mattered was the warmth of your skin and the way that our arms were tangled around each other’s waists. You looked so relaxed, love, your head squashed against the pillow, more relaxed than you ever do in the daytime. The sharp curves of your jaw, and the neat shape of your eyebrows, and your long, dark eyelashes fluttering on your cheeks. I felt so happy, and if I couldn’t have that with you, every day, then I know I’d be lonely.
I shifted myself then, my darling, because I wanted to get into position for you. It was as if our minds were synchronised, Draco, like they were working as one because then you kissed me, drawing me in close. My skin was achingly sensitive, and all my nerves were on fire. Part of me was frightened that I’d cum untouched, just from the feeling of your blunt, thick cock rubbing and teasing my entrance, making itself known and welcome.
When we go on our field trip, I’ll feed you Muggle sweets, which are every bit as delicious as wizarding ones, but don’t have some of the more obnoxious side effects. You won’t lose your voice, sprout horns or erupt into horrible spots when you eat a simple bag of pick-n-mix.
Sorry, that I answer only now – you probably wondered why I didn’t mention your proposition when we ate lunch together. But my day has been so busy. I hate days without free periods – however did we manage to get through the first few years of school when there wasn’t even such a thing?
Draco. My darling.
Are you thinking of me right now? Are you reading along during your free period? I love you, Harry.
Were they trying to use it for a banishing ritual, or was it for the creation of an undouseable flame? It boggles the mind thinking about taking a risk like that when it isn’t necessary to do so. That’s the thing about magic, isn’t it, the whole dark/light dichotomy that you joked about with Ron.
When I told her a little about your magic, Mother seemed to be quite impressed. She said that this usually only happens to very powerful wizards. Made me quite proud, isn’t that odd? Anyhow.
Alright, I shall try not to get too much of a sentimental, self-pitying prick right now. I’m in a perfect mood. One which I’d rather maintain. So read the rest of my reply very conversationally and light-heartedly, please. Because I’m sure you won’t like the first topic.
Okay, you can probably count one and one together. I know Malfoy. As far as I know, what you said about his father is right. It might not have been the brightest idea to bring his family in the position to owe the Dark Lord so badly that his son needed to step up in row when LM fell out of His favour. And imagine having Him living in your home. Creepiest family dinners ever, am I right?
I had better leave you, my darling. Most of my common room had left the room and I’m one of the final stragglers left behind. I want you too. I want to touch you and card my fingers through your hair. I’d let my hand rest on the nape of your neck and pull you close as I possibly could.
Anyway, enough about me. Let’s talk about you for a bit.
Did you already try to show this to a friend? Could you check whether it’s true that nobody but us can read it?
Anyhow. How in Merlin and Morgana’s name can you be so darn hot? Yes, you’ve read this correctly. Hot. Sexy. You have no idea what you did to me when you grabbed that prick by the shoulder and snarled at him like you did. You can be fucking intimidating. And the bloke was a good head taller than you, babe. All that raw magic and power radiating from you like a bloody thunderstorm. The way your shoulders squared, oh dear Circe, No wonder they buggered off as quickly as they did.
You surged forward then, my darling, forgoing words as your lips briefly met mine. It felt brilliant. We were official. It was you that answered Luna’s question. “We both realised quickly that our inclinations erred more towards wizards rather than witches,” you replied very diplomatically, “and though we flirted lightly in our diaries, I wasn’t sure that my co-writer was looking for a relationship.” You tangled your fingers in mine, and looked at me briefly before you spoke again, “but that changed on the night of the Hogwarts Ball. Harry- well, he feigned having Mufflemumps so that we could spend the night together… And though we weren’t physically together as such, I’d never in my life felt closer to anyone than I did with my secret friend. That was the first night we both told each other we were gay. After that, things moved very rapidly-”
I’d like to fucking sue them, Draco. I’d like to take them to the Wizengamot, and extract an apology from their grasping, lying mouths. Zabini too. That money-grabbing, slandering creep! I thought his family was supposed to be loaded? I thought he’d fled abroad after the war? I don’t have the first clue why Blaise told all these lies to the world but make my words: if I ever see him on Diagon, I won’t use my wand on him. I’ll use my fucking fists, you see if I don’t. I’ll give that cad the hiding of his life.
It didn’t escape me, the way your eyes darted over to me, checking whether I was quipping or not, precious, thoughtful darling that you are. But just in that moment – in anticipation of music and champagne, still feeling the relief rushing through my system that I wasn’t in Azkaban or cast out on the street but sitting in our drawing room with you who I love more than words can say and kisses can show – in that moment, Robards was nothing but a ludicrous caricature of an imperial, righteous Head Auror to me. I felt good yesterday evening, ecstatic even. And so well-treated and loved by you.
“Good Circe,” you breathed, and the way your groin moved against my wrist told me to let go of you, give you a moment to recover.
I know what you were expecting, sweet boy. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to bring you to orgasm, there and then, but I had other things planned. Another first that I wanted to experience only with you. Bobbing my head up and down, I swallowed you as far as I was able and I felt the keenness of your pleasure, heard your panting breath.
got wind that I’d chosen a career it’d end up emblazoned all over their cover.
I will put my quill down. See you in the Great Hall – we need some proper nourishment before practising.
You fumbled the lid from the lube, and then I heard the wet squish of your hand inside the jar. Clever, clever boy that you are, you warmed the wetness to room temperature with a spell, and then brought your fingers down to meet my tightly furled arse.
It was clear, my darling, just what your plans were for the Room of Requirement. Trust me when I say you have to do very little indeed to get a rise out of me. I was already half-hard with anticipation, and by the time that I’d pulled off my Invisibility Cloak, you were already diving into my arms. Fuck, but it was wonderful to kiss you. Everything that I’d lusted after since the moment I’d awakened.
I felt so bad once I had shoved you out the door. And I was sure that I finally must have reached the point of going too far with you. Because again, I couldn’t explain myself and I left you sitting there like you described, alone and topless in this unfamiliar room. I’m so sorry, love, you must have felt terrible.
Alright, so you’re probably wondering why my writing is flowing somewhat more quickly, all of a sudden. I've cast that transcribing charm we got taught about years ago, and now my quill is writing all by itself. Just tell me quickly, before I make an absolute fool of myself.
Of ALL the identities that I’ve ever had to carry in my short years on the earth, being your boyfriend was the one that I wanted, needed – craved – most of all. I never lied. I never exaggerated how I felt. When I said that I loved you it wasn’t some invention made to pass the time of day or said for my own amusement.
The house-elves were summoned to get their instructions for a Ball. I remember that Grandfather Abraxas listened to Father’s instructions to the elves, so it must’ve been Yuletide during our first year.
Once the dust of the war had settled, both Harry and Draco returned to school to complete their eighth year, a daunting undertaking for two men that had served on opposite sides of the war. Part of this difficult adjustment was to be matched with a fellow student, and to share a long-term diary with them.  Harry was keen to talk about the process.
Sorry, I’m not funny. To be honest, our visit to Godric’s Hollow was quite intense for me too. You were surprised when you came home, and I suggested visiting your parents, though you were everything but opposed to it.
You’ll be my friend.
Bloody hell, but I do wish Ron and Neville would hurry themselves! I’ve been ready for fifteen minutes already and simply can’t wait to see you. Ron, crafty bugger that he is – and I suppose I owe him one for giving us that password – hasn’t said a word about whether he proposed or not, though he does seem to be making an extra effort to charm his hair straight today (it isn’t working.) Truly, I don’t know whether that’s positive news or not. He’s definitely been a bit off – a little distant – but that doesn’t tell us anything. Sorry, you must despair of me. I truly am the most interfering, meddlesome person with the people that I care about.
Circe, I beg: no dressing up for dinner. No formal visits in the parlour, where we sip fancy tea from china cups. I want us to spend our days laughing, and our nights kissing. I never want the pair of us to go to bed in a row. It’ll be noisy, filled with children and animals and chatter, and we’ll be happy there, for the whole of our lives.
But I’m facing an insatiable desire to communicate with you – of course, I do – and words are everything we have right now. I comfort myself with the knowledge that it’s only so long until we see each other. Just at this moment, I don’t have a sole doubt that we’re doing the right thing. That we will look into each other’s eyes, first like we’ve probably done countless times during our Hogwarts careers, but then there will literally be more than meets the eye.
When your head perked up, searching my gaze with hazy eyes, you gave me a crafty smirk, and raised your open palm, you kinky git, in which you caught your spectacles a second later. I must’ve looked utterly debauched, panting and squirming under your touch, pleading with you to do the filthiest things.
But before I had a chance to retaliate, your legs wrapped around my hips underwater. Circe, it felt so fabulous. The warm water, your soft skin, our bodies being so close to each other. I felt your prick against my stomach and felt my own stiffen while my hands ran over your back, your arse, your thighs. I relished this moment, Harry, just holding and kissing you like we did before, but enjoying the intensity that comes with being naked and in love.
That’s about all I will tell you so far.
We both got our reward in the end, didn’t we? At the pitch, we snuck just past the Changing Rooms, and just for a moment then, I was reminded that we were there together the first time we met after learning each other’s identities, hidden away from curious glances and the confinement of the castle.
As for your probation: I know there’s a lot of regulations, but I promise that nobody is looking to try and drop anyone else in it. There just isn’t the appetite for it, at least not amongst anyone that I know. Take our old friend Draco Malfoy for an example. You surely can’t have regulations hanging over your head that are as demanding or harsh as his, yet nobody is out to make his life harder than it already is. Indeed, I’ve seen an acquaintance of mine (Luna Lovegood?) palling about with him during the last few weeks. I know the Ministry has a bit of a shitty reputation, but I don’t think even they want to send anyone else to Azkaban. I know it’s easier said than done, but please, please don’t worry.
One thing I’m not sure about yet, is whether I want this business to have a name that we would yet have to come up with or whether I’d rather use my name. I can see the merits of both options, love. Not using my real name for the business might save us some newspaper headlines. On the other hand, newspaper headlines are what might get this thing started in the first place. The thing is, though, that I’m not looking to become a millionaire from selling nifty little potions – our names officially attached to it might be a bit much.
I’m kneeling on my bed, completely naked, my thighs slightly spread. I’m already hard, really hard, because I touched myself just before I started to dictate. Our diary is right in front of me and I’m watching my own words appear on the page.
“Oh, and also, thanks for making Harry.”
It doesn’t seem fair to enjoy their food and their hospitality while my heart isn’t with them. My heart will be with you, every moment of the day.
The Aurors sat me down in a tiny, filthy interview room in the bowels of the Ministry, and made me answer question after question. I remember them asking all about you, Draco. They were harsh and they were insistent. “What were your impressions of Draco Malfoy’s character on the night of Dumbledore’s death?” “What, exactly, happened after the Snatchers took you to Malfoy Manor?” “Is Draco Malfoy irredeemable?”
I searched your gaze for your consent, muttering how we were open to some of the traditions – yes, the semi-public sex part – and how others just seem irrelevant and downright silly. “We’re not going to spend a week apart or have a purifying bath and anointment or anything barmy like that. Who would have it anyway?”
You seem determined to stay personally responsible for my breakfast and, seeing that you can’t take over the Hogwarts kitchen, you’ve been greeting me with strong tea and a loaded plate all week ever since I showed up hungover. And while it’s just past sunup now, I’m positively certain that that’s exactly what’s awaiting me once I emerge from the dungeons. If anyone manages to bring a sense of domesticity into this old castle, it’s definitely you, my darling.
Before I say anything else, I must apologise once again. Mainly for leaving you in the dark, and nervous and waiting. Again. And I need to take away your worries – you have done nothing wrong, darling, nothing.
That’s really admirable, love. It’s really courageous. I expect that the childhood that you’ve described – with its formal parties, pure-blood traditions, and foreign travel – would have been every bit as tightly constrained for her as it would have been for you, wouldn’t it? I've heard that the lot of a witch in many pure-blood families is a very conventional, very strict one, and I suppose she knew what her life was to look like from a very young age.
Theo is certainly the sort you’d call a ‘decent chap’, dear. And Weasley in the Wheezes? I’m not quite sure about it. I mean, I can see how a somewhat laid-back work would suit him. But I also think that he feels like he wants to assert himself. Despite his rather mediocre performance in school, as far as I can tell, he always came across quite ambitious. A bit like Pansy, really. Aiming for the best with the least possible effort. Even though this doesn’t hold true when thinking about the war. Ron is a very hands-on kind of wizard, isn’t he?
I know that I went about this the wrong way. I should’ve told you that my family had a part on the wrong side of the war as soon as we talked about my restrictions on travelling or when I put one and one together that you’re raised by Muggles. But frankly, it’s sometimes hard to decide what I need to hold back and what not. Do you have any ideas? How do you decide what you cannot tell me? Or am I being too headstrong, and you share everything with me apart from your name?
Please don’t think that you’ll have to provide for me financially. Also, please don’t think that you have to prove yourself a suitable husband for my mother – or me! I just want you to be you. We will live together, and we will pull in one direction as a team, you and I. If I’d desire to reobtain my accustomed posh lifestyle, I ought to seek out a profession that delivers accordingly.
Merlin, I cannot wait to have you all to myself.
Stubbornness is another trait that is practically sewn into Ron’s DNA, one that served me well in our younger years – there isn't a wizard with better stickability than him, and no one more loyal either – but backing down isn’t always his strong point. Merlin, but we’ve had some awful rows over the course of our friendship. During the year of the Triwizard Tournament we fell out for ages. Had to get Hermione to talk between us as an intermediary.
“Is it? How? I’m rather certain that, had you been a few years older when your sister broke ties with your parents, you would have helped her just like you did for me. You used to be close before she left, don’t even think of denying that.”
Fuck, I’m doing it again. No more soppy talk now.
You smell so incredible, Harry. At first, it only reminds me of the soap that almost everyone at Hogwarts is using, but then something adds to it that is so unmistakably you and I can’t get enough of it. I hope you don’t mind that actually sniffed your neck (it’s fucking adorable that you’re ticklish there) and your hair but I simply couldn’t resist.
Getting on the bus was the first giggle. Your eyes were as round as cauldrons when you realised that our buses don’t provide beds – which, even after being a part of the wizarding world since I was eleven, I still find a bizarre, and frankly quite gross concept! – but instead are fitted only with seats.
My beloved.
I'm sorry I left you waiting as long as I did.
I’m just teasing you, my lovely. But the fact is that now, while there are about 300 kilometres of distance between us, I can still feel a reminder of last night whenever I move. And before you fret whenever you read this – not in an unpleasant way. And I’m fairly certain that you know what I’m talking about anyway.
Because it would’ve been easier for me, just like you very rightly said. It would have been so easy to blame unrequited feelings or the idea that it just shouldn’t be. When you stopped staring at me, I thought I might have found a spot that hurt just enough.
I love you, my darling. See you for dinner soon.
He saw your wet lips, parted ever so slightly, and then he knew that you wanted him that much that you were going to swallow his cock. This might strike you as painfully naïve – the words of a virgin – but that knowledge would have made me hard. It’s that coming together of two bodies that most excites me about sex. That, for a brief moment in time, your lover and you become one person.
They’re not paying any mind to me and so I have a few minutes.
And words, Harry. So many words that ran through my mind without being able to focus on just one stream of them.
But back to our talk yesterday.
My younger self commented on your hair because he was very confused. You must see that the idea of an insult turning into a fine duel turning into a tussle turning into fierce snogging has always been quite alluring to him.
“Draco saved my life,” I repeated back to them, three or four times. “And no, I don’t know why,” I explained, my voice flat and drab with fatigue. “And I can’t answer for his personality or his choices. All I know is that his actions bought me the time I needed. His actions were enough to change the course of the war.”
But anyway. The four of us went on to less risky topics, and I felt like we all were enjoying our time. It’s good to know that we can have a more or less honest talk like that without being resentful for the rest of the day. I sometimes feel like that’s what family is about. No matter how and why Mother and I disagree, in the end I never doubt that we are there for each other.
Alright, enough with the pure-blood talk. I am now going to seduce you with our favourite and most-alluring topic. Yes, obviously it’s school, you dolt.
You slid your hand into mine and led me to the settee in the middle of the room, all business like and efficient and I followed. Can I admit something? I was a little bit fearful in that moment. Snape’s fingers, carding through my memories, dismissing them, ridiculing them, hurting me physically with his derision, was such a painful practice for me, and the last thing I wanted was to wound you the same way.
Laugh if you wish, but even now I can’t believe that beauty such as yours exists.
As for now, I will take all of the two-hours I have to reminisce about my childhood and share it with you. I’ll try to focus on pre-Hogwarts.
“You look so sexy,” you said, taking hold of the back of my knee and pushing my leg back, lining yourself up and getting in position. “You don’t know what you do to me, Harry. I’m besotted. I’m in love with you.”
Good morning my love.
Ron had a bit of a pash with Lavender Brown too, though that fizzled out when she became too possessive. Lavender always was a bit of an odd duck, though it was a terrible, awful thing that happened to her during the last battle.
This wasn’t the way that I’d expected my eighth year to look like, Draco Malfoy. I’d expected it to be a nightmare, but this all feels a little bit like a dream come true.
I ought to be nervous or full of trepidation, but the truth is I’m excited.
And love you I did. I pulled my own shirt over my shoulders as speedily as a charm and pulled you close to me, tipping our bodies onto the quilt in my eagerness to touch everywhere I could. The feeling of your hard flat chest, and your satin skin next to mine was fantastic. I felt so much trust from you, Draco. You were so secure in our love as I cast my eyes over every part of you.
informed us both that it was close to ten. “I don’t want to go back,” I said, knotting my legs around you and pressing kisses on your jaw. “They won’t miss us, love. Let’s just hide away here. Never get dressed ever again. Kreacher can bring us food whenever we get hungry. The world’s taken enough from me. All I want is you. Your skin and your lips. Your prick and your perfect arsehole.”
I’m too excited about Christmas and even more so about the New Year that’ll follow it. I've got Wrackspurts in my tummy already. Yes, let's meet in Hogsmeade. Is a date in Madam Puddifoots too on the nose, or shall we just meet at a booth in the back of The Three Broomsticks? It might be more secluded.
You know what I’m like, darling boy. If I give you even one, singular kiss then I won’t stop and I WANT to keep writing. Otherwise, these wonderful days will blur into a muddle of lovemaking, and eating, and laughing, and then, all of a sudden, we’ll be back on the Hogwarts Express and… Okay.
“Shh,” you reassured, holding me tight, kissing me on my jaw, and my neck and my collarbone. “I’ve got you. I love you.”
These last few weeks and months? You’ve grown to the most important part of my life. When I read your words about visiting France and eating mille-feuille, and when I read your words about growing together, about sharing all the big parts of our lives, then I know. I know that this is the future I want.
If there’s one thing I wouldn’t want to miss out on, it’s the consummation of the bond. It will allow both of us to act in each other’s names, no matter whether magical contracts, house magic, or whatever else may be involved one day. And, well... Potential children would certainly profit from the entwined bond of our blood and our magic as well.
I hope you’re smiling, Draco Malfoy. One of those lovely, genuine grins that I can’t get enough of.
I was you and you were I in that moment; and I hated myself for not helping you back in sixth year. I was so dedicated to helping my friends, so devoted to fulfilling my destiny that I never once considered you might have been abused and used like you had been, that your life had become a place of terror.
Like the old Mind Healer of mine. I’m really looking forward to my appointment this week. I still can’t believe that it could’ve been like that from the start of term. What do you reckon – would our MHs still think it’s perfectly normal how we communicate and what we’ve found in each other? I’m sure no one would understand us, and the idea is oddly romantic to me. I feel like we already have something that only few find. I, for my part, had no idea such a feeling existed before I found you.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at the pranks he’d suggested. “Truth it is then,” she said, her voice authoritative. It was just the teeniest bit slurred though, and I wondered whether she’d already had more than a few mouthfuls of Ogden’s Finest. “Alright. Three people… Nev… Seamus and… Draco. I want you to tell each of them your most secretive thoughts about them. No fibbing, Ron. I’ll know, and then you’ll have to do a forfeit. You really will be stealing the Headteacher’s dressing gown.”
I was about to answer, Draco, but you beat me to it, love.
Ron looked so pleased, didn’t he, when he made his announcement? He looked at Hermione with such soft longing, like she held the moon. Perhaps that’s how I look when I talk about you. I wouldn’t be ashamed if it were.
They’d have tolerated you for being my boyfriend, love, but they’ve accepted you for you alone. Not for me. Personally, I couldn’t be happier about that fact. It means I get my fiancé and my friends all together, and there isn’t anything that sounds better in the world to me.
I’m whispering but I reckon the spell can still pick up my voice. Yes, it can. I don’t want to wake you.
And you did comply with my quest. Fuck, I will never forget that feeling when you came inside of me for the very first time. I loved everything about it. The spreading warmth deep inside of me, your smooth movements skittered into a staccato of thrusts and cries.
Instead, this is what is going to happen, Draco Lucius Malfoy.
Speaking of Muggle things – I haven’t thought about that when we were talking but I do remember seeing Finnigan and Thomas kick a ball some years ago, wondering what they were even doing with their lives. Think I understand now. I’d love to see how a game of football is played. It did sound so much like Quidditch, just without the flying. And this system you mentioned with the cards, the red and the yellow one, this is something that needs to be a thing in Quidditch. I ought to petition for it. You better be supportive and help me.
I’ve written a lot again, haven’t I?
“There has to be a hidden room somewhere,” I explained. “Often under the stairs or in the cellar, I believe. I’m not sure about that. You know how huge the Manor is – the heart of the house is practically the size of one bloody story of a normal house.”
Seamus has confessed to me that he’s gay, which is, in my opinion, the most fantastic state of affairs – no, I’m not going to mention penises, lube or friction here, though you know that’s what I’m thinking of – but isn’t in Seamus’s opinion. Now, I’m not such an oblivious wanker that I didn’t realise he was getting a dig in with the ‘couple of the year’ comment (although he was entirely bloody correct!) so perhaps you and I falling in love has changed things for Dean and he? Added an extra pressure that they didn’t have before? Merlin, do you think they broke up and seeing our happiness has made them change their minds? Do you have any ideas?
But Merlin, I don’t know what to feel right now except that I’m sort of sad for Theo. Can we meet somewhere? Or is it getting too late, my sweet boy?
You were surprised that I’ve been to Godric’s Hollow before, and I told you how probably most wixen have been there. I wasn’t fibbing when I told you that – as a child and completely ignorant of the meaning of it all – I was fascinated by famous Harry Potter and his parents who have heroically died so that their son could defeat the Dark Lord. See, the times were different. Father made himself a name in the Ministry, holding back whenever something about You-Know-Who came up, and Mother wouldn’t have ever spoken to me about their former alliances in the First War anyway.
Braithwaite had me booked in his last slot of the morning, and I watched as the stuffy, overheated little room slowly emptied. Couples leaving, hand in hand.
“I don’t suppose that we’ll always be entirely fifty/fifty in our support of each other financially, but isn’t that the nature of every marriage? Both parties support each other, at different times during their lives together.” I heard the intake of your breath. “I love Harry,” you said, more to me than to the Auror, “and our relationship isn’t transactional, Auror Robards. Harry knew that I had very little when we fell for each other, and I haven’t ever looked for a leg up or a hand out. I've only asked for his love. My Father was an awful, dreadful man in a multitude of ways, but he taught me Malfoys never supplicate, and I never once have.”
Also, before I forget, I do admire your ingenuity in the running gear department. Transfiguring one of the school Quidditch kits into a tracksuit was inspired, my darling. That’s half the reason I let you take the lead of course. I was ogling how attractively your thighs and bum fit into the tight material. Very well, is my expert opinion. Even when you weren’t my boyfriend, you were quick to notice my liking for well-contoured backsides, and yours, my darling, is the roundest of them all.
So, I’m not saying this because I feel I’d have to lie or anything. But body hair is not a turn-off for me in the slightest. This is, I think, the first time that I say it like this, but I think I’m gay. Like, really gay. Most wizards come with body hair as far as I know. Truth is, hearing this gets me rather excited – makes me think of a man rather than a boy.
That’s exactly what I have with you, Draco. We’ll be lovers in every sense of the word. We’ll learn about our bodies together and be bold and unafraid of making mistakes. I love you. I know we’re going to have the most wonderful fun.
Maybe – I’m only thinking aloud here – you could set up a home laboratory? Be your own boss and have your potions delivered by owl? There’s a basement full of dusty, cobwebbed old lab equipment back at my house – I think it belonged to my benefactor’s brother. My Godfather wasn’t the studious type! – and seriously, it’s all yours if you so desire. I don’t have the first clue what to do with it all.
With that your insecurity was gone and you began to tell me about your Godson. About his hair colour changing and sometimes his facial features. “He’s ill a lot though,” you explained. “The poor bean has to see his Mediwix almost every other week or so. Also, he has to take a lot of potions. I think they are usually meant to keep his airways moist and unobstructed. Sometimes, Teddy changes the form of his throat or his nose without much control over it.”
I know this much, nevertheless: I can wade through Ministry mumbo-jumbo with the best of them and I’m not easily intimidated. With me by your side, I promise you that you’d have an advocate for whatever underhand tricks they tried to play. I don’t want to go into any great detail, but I’ve had a few run-ins with the snot-nosed, sadistic pencil-pushers that work in the Ministry, and I know how they try to use the status of their office to coerce and frighten people.
“Of course,” Mother agreed.
And no more descriptions of you as my chum or my mate. Agreed. I can do that.
What a wonderful day, my darling boy. You’re sleeping now, dozy in the morning sun, and soon I’ll wake you with a kiss.
I’m relieved that Ron talked to you and that you feel closer to him again. I know that it means very much to you. Besides, I know how difficult it is for Ron to forgive me. Merlin knows that I would have a hard time forgiving someone who bullied you.
The two of us ate our sandwiches and drank our Coca-Colas and we felt quite at peace with the world. The Muggles around us read their novels, played football with their children, all of them in pure innocence that their country had nearly succumbed to disaster. Truthfully, Draco, as we sat there, I could hardly believe it to be true either.
Being outside was so wonderful, Harry. Fucking cold, but wonderful.
“The pair of you looked the very picture of love when Harry received his Order of Merlin,” Luna began, giving us an encouraging smile, “but that will have come as a surprise to many Quibbler readers. Would you begin by telling me how you came to fall in love?”
Other than that, I’d suggest our magical toadstool shelf, but I’ve got a confession to make darling. I’m not allowed into the restricted section. My cousin was so kind to fetch your gift and to place mine for me.
It did work, yes.
‘Mione told me that she wants to be well prepared, but I don’t think I could enjoy my final months of eighth-year if I knew my nose would be shoved straight back to the grindstone. Ron is nearly as bad. He was trying to work out the right incantation for a tongue-tie truth spell but couldn’t quite get it correct. “Still think you would have made a good Auror,” he told me glumly. “Dunno what I’m going to do without you two beside me.”
Darling, you haven’t taken even a drop of Dreamless Sleep since we've returned to Grimmauld Place. Bloody hell, but I wasn’t even sure that you’ve even packed any, because the subject has simply never come up between us. We’ve stayed up ridiculously late each night, making love, making out, reading and talking, and now all sense of time had flown from us, and you were paying the penalty for it. Deprived of your usual potion and the set hours of sleep Hogwarts deem appropriate, you’d become overwhelmed by the upcoming Auror visit and built it up into a monstrous thing.
I nodded even though I hadn’t really been aware of that until he said it. But once he mentioned it, I sort of guessed what he was going to say.
Alright, you’re waking up, and so I’m going to put my diary aside. Let’s talk today about what you want for our bonding so that we can tell Andi everything we’ve planned. I want to tell your mother everything as well, though I’ll leave the saying of the actual words to you. A large part of me is still terribly intimidated by Narcissa.
We won’t be observed, because students aren’t strictly allowed there. It’s basically a tiny wooden nook, just beyond where the elves grow the school vegetables.
I’d never figured myself for the exhibitionist type but those words that you’ve just written for me? Bloody hell. If I’m not careful then I’ll shoot my load just thinking about them.
Oh Draco, I could tell that asking this question had cost him a lot of effort. He was red in the face, even in that shadowy corner of the Library, and his voice was hushed, like he couldn’t bear for anyone to hear us.
Cultured and brainy I am indeed. You forgot to mention how handsome and hilarious I am, though.
Harry. I just reread what you said about people snogging and nobody bats an eyelid. I want that for us just as much. Let me try to be brave here.
Sorry to hear that you didn’t enjoy the Yule Ball. I think it’s one of my favourite Hogwarts memories. Perhaps you only had the wrong date though. I’d totally help you find the right robes without a big fuss, and I’d leave it up to you whether you’d want to dance or not. But I daresay you couldn’t resist. The adrenaline from dancing would be written all over my face and it’d be way too contagious. You’d be a fool to think you’d be able to keep your hands off me.
We’ll be our own wizards, and all the better for it, and Gods, I cannot wait. I’ve already got most of the information collected for the form: copies of my Mind Healing tests that I took immediately after the war that prove what happened in the woods that night had no long-term physical effects. I’ve also got copies of my O.W.L. certificates, my Portkey passport and my birth certificate from St Mungo’s that prove my wizarding heritage, and that James and Lily Potter were my parents. The only other documents that I still need are the deed to Grimmauld Place – currently kept in my vault – and a letter of good character. I thought about asking Kingsley Shacklebolt for that (!) but decided that might be too much of an arsehole move. I’m going to ask Headteacher McGonagall instead.
Nobody in the Hall said a word, and when I looked around nobody would meet my eye. Where are you, Draco?
You’re going to be ogling me all evening long instead of racking your brains over the righteousness of that order that you so deserve, darling. How does that sound?
Draco; yes, definitely!
“Right you are. Robards really ought to think twice about who’s sullying who in this relationship of ours, don’t you reckon, love?”
Also, the next time you’ll see him, I will have taught you some proper lullabies.
First of all, he was quite amiable and open. I got the impression that he really put some thought into this, Harry, which I can’t take for granted. He even gave me some material that will certainly be useful alongside a few names of people he knows who have run or had to do with smaller potion businesses in one or the other way. Contacting them at some point or when I come up with very precise questions might be useful, although I wouldn’t like to reach out for advice too often. Not if I can get around it somehow.
I realised how rarely I inquired after her and Teddy. I’m sorry, Harry. I think I’m panicking, and it might be one of those things that I’m blissfully ready to shield away from my consciousness. I don’t know what she thinks about me and my family used to pretend that she doesn’t even exist.
I know, I know… You’re shaking your head and calling me impudent. I’m planning again, aren't I? I know that you're right when you say that living together is a big decision. I suppose that comes across as jovial in my letters but I'm in earnest. I think we'd be able to rub along well together.
Now I know who you really are, so many more things make sense. There’s a big tapestry in one of the rooms, and guess what? You’re embroidered into it, just beneath the picture of your mother. You do look very haughty and self-important, but also very handsome. We’ll get it fixed up, shall we, and make it into something beautiful once again? Walburga – your great aunt – she did quite a bit of damage to it, not long before she died.
Glynis went on, much to my mother’s very obvious chastisement. ”You told me she does exactly what she ought to do about falling in love. She didn’t give a flying fuck about The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black’s expectations and followed what she truly desired. And frankly, that’s not so far from what you helped me do.”
My words achieved precisely what I was looking for: you gave me the most wonderful, charming laugh. We linked our arms, and I led the way, but not through the posh arcade but in the direction of the park nearby.
I’d better turn my quill away from ardour, or I’ll never leave this seat. I’m already a few minutes late for my session but I find I can’t leave your company quite yet.
So, yes, to what you asked. I want you. I want to fuck you. I want to feel you relax into my touch when I’m loosening you, when I’m entering you. When we’re together like this evening, there’s nothing else my body aches for more.
My sweet boy.
That’s why your idea of setting up a potion business in your basement sounds awfully good. In reality I wouldn’t have a clue how to arrange any of it but it sounds like something I should be looking into. I still can’t believe how real this all sounds. You’re too good to be true, love.
Okay. Time to get settled in this very solitary, very uncomfortable bed. Why is it I wasn’t conscious of how cold and lumpy it was before? I’m going to close my eyes, and in my mind’s eye, play out every moment of last night. The small noises of pleasure you made when our naked bodies came together, and the slick slide of your lubed-up prick between my arse cheeks and the way it nudged my balls so delightfully.
What brings a smile to my face, no matter how bitter my thoughts get, is thinking of you. And of the future we’ll share. It feels odd that we’ll have all these exams before we get to have that home for us to make our own.
Look, just don’t be pissed off with me, but the morning after you – well, the morning after I visited the Slytherin dorms – I told Hermione about what had happened. Don’t fret, I didn’t tell her all the details, I only gave her a general outline. So – like we’ve both agreed – she’s pretty much the wisest person that I know.
And the family that she protected so sharply and patiently through everything – we haven’t listened! Can you believe that? We were at a point, a few years ago, when she begged Father to flee the country before the already precarious situation would get worse. Father and me both were blind for the future she dreaded. We were fools. It was not even a year later when she asked me to leave with her alone, leave Father behind. At the time, it felt like she wanted to hold me back or didn’t trust my judgement – it felt like she saw a child, not a young man who I wished to be but, in retrospect, was not.
I watched Muggle couples on Islington High Street, their arms piled high with presents, and wix couples walking over the cobbles of Diagon Alley, their hands entwined and eyes shining, full of the cheerfulness of the season. I know I’m selfish and that we’ll be together in five days, but I wanted you close to me today. I’m of age, and I know my own mind, and I love you.
I honestly don’t know how the witch took all our semi-coherent viewpoints, and vague mutterings, and made them into something so heartfelt and clever that I’ll be proud to read aloud. That part at the end, where you suggested that I talk about Teddy and then I said that I wanted to dedicate the medal to him? I already know I’ll cry when I read that part aloud. I’m resigned to the fact.
I’m currently sitting in my common room close to the fireplace, wishing I had you here with me. Perhaps in my lap, just like yesterday. I miss your comfortable weight and the scent of your lovely hair.
Please tell me about your appointment with Braithwaite, love. I better leave you now. We will finally pay this imposing Abbey a visit now – Mother just found me, and we’ll watch the tide rise for a bit, before we leave. She smiled when she saw that I was writing to you.
I can’t think of another way that I'd rather spend my time. You’ll be able to tell me about some more of the places you’ve visited, regale me with a couple more of your poems and I can listen. If you called me your friend or, even better, gave me an oh-so-macho slap on the back then that would simply be the pumpkin icing on the treacle tart. I won’t be drinking Firewhisky, but perhaps I’ll treat myself to a pile of Honeydukes that’s nearly as big as my head. I did warn you, didn't I, that I had a sweet tooth?
“That’s a good idea,” I replied, feeling a bit ineloquent. I wanted to encourage you, but sometimes I just don’t find the right words for it. I hope that pulling you closer to me and tightening my grip around your arm was more effective than my lame words. We walked in silence for a while.
