“Ron helped so much with finding Dresden…with saving you, you know that, right?” Harry says to him, suddenly feeling like maybe he needed to discuss some things with his best friend. It’s possible that Harry is in over his head, at this point.
"You'd know all about that..." He responds. A few minutes tick by, and both men are content to sit in silence before Ron speaks again.
“Never a dull moment,” he says lightly, “Was there something you needed? Molly won’t be home for a bit.”
Harry is forced out into the blistering cold weather without his coat, which he realizes was left draped over his seat inside the bar. It's foggy and wet out, and the streets have cleared for the most part. That's just great, Harry thinks, his luck is impeccable. It's extremely difficult to keep his eyes open at this point, and he can barely move his limbs. The slimy blonde git is basically dragging him along toward an empty alleyway on the side of the bar. The light doesn't quite penetrate back here, and it's eerily silent save for the slight whooshing of the wind around them.
“Lay back,” he tells him, and Draco hesitates, but gives in when Harry pushes a little harder. Harry assaults him with hot kisses, pressing his hard length against him as he does so. He works his way down to Draco’s lengthy, hard cock and wraps his mouth around him hungrily. Draco bucks shamelessly into his mouth, fingers tangled in Harry’s messy locks of hair. The fingers tighten and pull up until Harry finds himself staring into half lidded silver eyes. Draco begins to nudge Harry to turn until Harry understands, and he lines himself up so that his cock is now in Draco’s face as he takes Draco’s in his mouth again. He feels wet heat begin to wrap around him and he moans around the length of Draco’s manhood. Draco’s hands press firmly into Harry’s buttocks, urging him to thrust deep into the blonde man’s throat. Harry summons a small vial of lubricant from the nightstand next to the bed and presses it into Draco’s hand. After a few moments of shuffling behind him, he feels Draco’s slick finger pressing against his entrance. Harry moans at the wonderful pressure, relaxing and allowing the finger entrance. He quickens his pace on Draco’s cock, sucking full force as he thrusts up into the finger and then down into the searing throat below him. It’s almost too much, and then a second finger soon joins the first and it is all Harry can do to stop himself from coming.
“Draco I-I never knew you felt that way.” Harry says honestly, because he really had no idea. “You seemed to want to keep things a secret just as much as I did…” Harry is absolutely dumbfounded.
“Well, I didn’t know for sure, Ronald, so it’s not something that I could just spit ball as a thought without you freaking the fuck right out, don’t you think?” She spits back, exasperated.
He finishes his chores mechanically. Laundry, dishes, bathroom tub. Then he grabs his coat and braves the cold as he walks to the nearest grocery store. He buys eggs, milk, bread, meat, and frozen vegetables. He grabs a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of rum, and, almost an afterthought, a gallon of water. The cashier rings him up with no issue. If she’s noticed that Harry buys alcohol almost daily, she doesn’t comment. Harry likes it that way. No one recognizes him here. No one cares. No one is judging, at least not outwardly, and that’s more than enough for him. He takes the brown paper bags holding his groceries and walks back to his apartment complex. The sky is grey and a cold drizzle of rain alternately falls and dissipates. Harry concentrates on his footsteps, the sounds of children playing in the nearby park, the engines of cars as they pass him on the road. It’s a short walk, and he soon finds himself at his doorstep.
Surprisingly, Draco is awake, sitting up in his bed, when Harry steps into his room. His long hair is slightly damp, as if he has just finished showering. He looks a little more refreshed now, as if a few hours of good sleep could somehow negate all that he was put through. His lips quirk again into that tiny half smile before resuming the frown he was wearing before he laid eyes on Harry. Merlin, he is so fucking beautiful, Harry can barely stand it. Harry glances away, eyes landing on the empty vial of dreamless sleep draught on the bedside table. So yeah, it was probably pretty good sleep, actually.
“Oh yes,” Arthur replies, “Augustus is Annie’s great grandfather.” And Harry just stares at him, slack jawed.
"A nightmare? Again?" The bite to her words sting him for just a moment. Behind his eyes there are momentary flashes of platinum hair, a smile, and then smooth pale limbs being torn apart. He shudders. It’s more of a memory, but he doesn’t feel like correcting her. There isn’t a point in doing so, not anymore.
“Please, don’t stop eating on my account, I’ll only be a moment.” She replies, and Harry stares at them like a fish out of water. He can’t determine exactly how he feels about his ex-wife and current lover under the same roof, let alone exchanging pleasantries. It doesn’t even really seem forced, to their credit. He watches as Draco nods and returns to his toast, taking a small bite and chewing thoughtfully. He is looking off in the distance but Harry knows he is probably going to listen to their conversation intently. Ginny, even if she felt he might listen, doesn’t seem to mind either way as she turns back to him.
They sit this way a little longer, the silence stretching on into awkward glances at anything but each other’s faces. Potter hisses a bit more, winces, until finally Draco is unable to stand it any longer. He steels himself before standing and going to the medicine cabinet. “You can take some Tylenol now, as it’s different pain reliever from the Advil, so they can be alternated.” He says softly, handing the bottle to Potter, who accepts it rather gratefully. The broad shouldered man grunts in acknowledgement before gulping down a couple of the pills with the rest of his coffee. He looks as if he’s ready to puke up the contents of his rather puny breakfast. Draco catches his own grimace just in time and moves instead to gather up the dishes and bring them over to the sink. Potter barely notices him and he prefers it that way, focuses on scrubbing the dishes mechanically and drying them before putting them back in their respective cupboards. Something about muggle housework really calms Draco down and helps him to relax. He’s content as he goes about cleaning up.
Harry finds himself standing in the darkness outside of Draco’s flat, a few magically shrunken suitcases floating behind him. He doesn’t really have anywhere else to go. He is sure that Ginny is telling Ron and Hermione and all the other Weasleys about how Harry is a disgusting, cowardly,
"Okay, maybe just one..." he says, allows the blonde to grasp his shoulder and lead him back to the bar.
"I refuse to let you become another victim of this war." He says, chin jutting outward as he stares me down determinedly. If my arms were free I would punch him with all my might. As it were, the only thing I can do is head-butt him, which he easily deflects before backing up smartly away from me.
"Is he alive?" To which Harry nods and lets out a slight sob. "How?" But Harry only shakes his head.
"Holy fucking shit! This can't be happening!" He yells loudly to himself, trying to calm his breathing. Okay, now he is absolutely certain it's Harry
His cock, thick and hard, presses harshly into my own but it isn't enough. Potter senses this and begins to undo my trousers. I undo his and his prick pops free. He wraps his hands around both of our man hoods before thrusting again. I see stars as the pleasure rakes through me. I can barely stand the sight of him, pupils blown wide in arousal and face twisted in pleasure so strong he almost looks pained.
"Have you spoken to Ginny? She's probably worried sick." His friend continues. He slurps at his own coffee, blanching as the bitter, cold liquid touches his lips.
"Nnmmmpphhh." Harry says, trying his hardest to form the word "no." His head lolls to the side now, leaning into the strong warmth of his captor. He smells nice, which somehow makes all of this feel worse, because Harry thinks he might have let the idiot fuck him if he had just asked politely.
"Okay then. I'll ransack the place and see what I can find. You take him down. I know you want your vengeance, Harry." Ron's eyes are searching Harry's, and in the bright clear light of the day it's too much. Harry looks away.
“I don’t know what I was thinking,” Draco says tiredly next to him, “sleeping on the floor when I had such a fantastic bed.” There is a slight chuckle, but something more in his voice, a sort of fleeting uncertainty that Harry recognizes instantly.
“It doesn’t make sense though. You essentially got away with it, and the oath was fulfilled once Dresden died. You could have destroyed the evidence the moment it became available again. Why were you trying to continue the ritual?” Ron asks, the confusion evident in his voice.
Harry sits in the waiting room at St. Mungo's. He is tired and on edge all at the same time. Draco is stable, those are the only words he has heard from the mediwitch caring for him, but it's enough for Harry. He will wait until the blonde wakes up, even if it takes days. Yes, Harry isn't going anywhere, not until he can look into the silver orbs that have haunted his nightmares for months on end.
“Well…” The gears are turning in Mary’s head as she thinks. “I’m not sure if this would even be relevant but, Annie’s treatments were being paid for by an anonymous donor.”
“You need to talk to her. I think she’s just waiting to hear you apologize, at this point.” Ron looks a bit sympathetic, but he is stern with his words, fingers digging slightly into Harry’s collarbone.
"I love you," he moans. I can only gasp in response. I want to tell him how much I fucking love him in return. I have never been in love before him and I will never love again after. I want to tell him to find happiness when the war is over, to find someone else to love and to be true to himself. Who gives a fuck if the savior of the wizarding world is bent? Every wizard in England owes him their ass if that's what he wants.
“Harry, please, talk to me.” She begs. Her hand reaches across the table toward his own, but she hesitates and then pulls it back, folding her hands tightly atop the table instead. Harry owes her the truth. He owes Draco the truth. He owes himself the truth. This will be a hard conversation to have but it will be good for all of them in the end, won’t it?
“Bed,” he tells him, and Harry picks him up easily, Draco wrapping his legs around him as their mouths press once again. Draco’s tongue slips hotly into Harry’s mouth, and Harry staggers momentarily at the delicious distraction. He sits Draco down on the freshly made bed, breaking the kiss to trail his tongue down the other man’s neck. Draco groans, hands tightening in Harry’s hair before sliding down to his clothing. He begins to pull and tug at Harry’s clothes, and Harry helps him to strip himself. Both men now naked, Harry places his hands on Draco’s chest and nudges him gently down onto the bed.
A Mediwitch bursts in to the room then, the same one who first spoke to Harry when Draco woke up. “Sorry, Mr. Potter, I’m going to have to ask you to leave!” She shouts, and Harry barely stumbles out of her way in time as she makes her way to Draco. She casts a calming charm on him, starts to say soothing things, and tells him to breathe. She shoots Harry a bit of a glare at that point, almost a warning,
I can't take my eyes off of Potter, even as I feel the sinking feeling of disapparition twisting in my gut.
“Sanguinum Purgo is a complex and highly invasive ritual. The spell literally binds itself into the blood of the pureblood wizard. Over time, it compels the wizard to carry on his or her part of the ritual. Eventually, Draco would no longer need the chains. He would be cutting his own arm and slaying the sacrifices himself. The compulsion becomes stronger and stronger after the first 10 months, and the consequences of denying these urges are usually fatal. It had been so long that I figured Malfoy would be crawling out of his skin with the need to carry it on. I was, quite frankly, surprised when he denied and then attacked me once he realized what was truly going on. I didn’t even have time to defend myself. I just didn’t think there would be a need to do so.”
And then I hold back my tears so hard my eyes bulge out of their sockets from the force of it. After about 15 minutes of this torture, I'm startled as a head appears in midair right in front of me.
Silence fills the room as everyone’s interests are peaked. Draco thinks for a moment before a wide smile plays across his lips. “It’s blue, like my pajamas!” He exclaims. With a soft click, the snitch opens. Draco peers inside of it and gasps for the second time, pulling out a white gold wedding band. The words “D & H forever” are engraved on the inside of it.  He stares at it in shocked silence, and Harry feels like he can cut the tension in the room with a knife.
. I don’t want to be a part of hurting anyone, either, not ever again. I’ve already spoken to my mother about this, not about us but about my sexuality and my desires to be out and open, and although she isn’t thrilled, she is willing to accept me for who I really am.” Draco’s eyes are almost pleading with Harry, but Harry isn’t sure what he is pleading for, exactly.
"No, please don't apologize, I uh...thank you, Potter. I can't believe you did that for me. After everything...I wasn't sure...well I mean..." I trail off idiotically.
Draco shakes his head and seals off his room, giving one last lingering glance to the open scroll on his table. But before he can change his mind, Blaise is herding him towards the lifts, steering past lingering Ministry workers who are taking their time to walk along the corridor.
I still remember the pride on Father’s face, his only heir already wanting to follow in his footsteps.
his body. I don’t get to do this enough as our schedules are so packed that a quick fuck is all we can manage.
“Right then.” Draco nodded. “To the Gryffindor dorms then.” He mentally steeled himself to make the trek towards the part of the castle he religiously avoided.
Draco’s been thinking of studying via correspondence, at least till Scorpius grows old enough to start school. Harry had stayed up with him last week, helping him short list courses he could study till Draco had selected one.
They started with ice skating, and he doesn’t think he can ever forget the sight of Draco falling onto his arse throughout the day. He had been sure that Draco would be a pro at ice skating. After Draco had started complaining that his body could only take so much abuse, they had headed straight for hot chocolate before walking around the park, Scorpius and Loki enjoying the open space.
Draco blinks. His hair is longer now, Harry notices. It falls gracefully over his eyes, the wispy ends lifting lightly because of the wind. Harry is struck by his startling grey eyes.
Potter looked different. Tired, yes, but also matured in a way Draco didn’t feel yet. His face seemed more chiselled, age defining his cheekbones and jawline in a way that emphasised his features. There was even a hint of stubble around his jaw. Potter had grown into a handsome man, irrevocably changed by the last year. Draco still felt as if he stood on the cusp of adulthood.
He can feel the bile rise in his throat as the memories resurface. He is startled when Malfoy slips his hand over his.
However, the reality was a lot different. The Manor was as dark and chilling as he’d remembered, the never-ending corridors and looming portraits doing nothing to make him welcome. His mother had already written to him five times since the end of the year, urging him to join her in Nice, using the weather, the food, even the abundance of single men as an excuse.
“I’ll get these started,” he assures Draco, settling the stack down in the sink. With a flick of his wand he gets the dish rag started, the water frothing with bubbles as soap is added. He leans back against the counter then, pulling Draco to lean against him with an arm around his waist. “Teddy wants to play with his Uncle Draco.”
Harry watches on in shock as Draco fondly brushes snow off the little boy’s, Scorpius’s, coat. They hold hands as they walk away, the little boy skipping along as Draco walks slowly to match his pace.
Harry stops his fidgeting as Malfoy looks up to meet his eyes. Through the hum of the crowded pub, he has to strain a little to hear him. "Maybe," Malfoy starts, hesitating a little but never breaking eye contact, "one day?"
The area around the wall are still under the throes of winter, the trees frozen solid, the grass no longer visible under the layer of snow. But there’s still more than enough space for a little puppy to run and play to his heart’s content.
“I think it sounds exciting,” Scorpius exclaims, looking up at Harry in awe. Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever run out of these moments, times when he looks at Albus and Scorpius and can’t believe how lucky he is.
Harry frowns. “Is this because of the war? Because if it is, I’m going to have a talk with Prof. Mcgonagall. We didn’t suffer through that just to live in a world filled with discrimination.”
conversation just yet. It’s not that he’s scared of Harry leaving him, some facts are universal and Harry is anything but cruel. The reality though is that he and Harry have never discussed expanding their family, the topic of children just never came up. They’re comfortable in their life right now, enjoying each other's company as they build their careers. A baby would definitely change things but would that really be so bad?
It feels like hours have passed before my cell door opens, the light hurting my eyes as it filters in. It's Potter, of course. He walks over and gets down on his knees before me.
"Draco," he starts, and the look on his face is one I have come to recognize all too well. He feels guilty about something. My heart sinks into my stomach as I find the courage to continue looking into his eyes. "Please don't be angry with me..."
Now, I sit on a chair next to Potter's bed in the sterile, much too white and bright room. My left hand holds his at his side, while my right idly flicks through The Prophet as it lays balanced on my knees. I'm not sure how long I sit there. I've gotten so good at waiting these past few weeks that it barely phases me now.
“Harry.” Harry awakes in a tangled knot of sweat soaked limbs and blanket. He gasps for air, unceremoniously untangling himself before searching around for his glasses. His heart is pounding in his ears so loudly that he barely registers the voice of the person sitting next to him.
“Just give me a moment so I can get dressed.” Harry swallows again and nods at him. He can’t help but peak into the room. It’s also neat and tidy, but Harry’s heart sinks as he notices that Draco’s bed is not dressed. His sheets and blanket are laid out on the floor in a corner of his room, complete with pillows, as if the man has been sleeping on the ground instead of in his bed. When his eyes turn back to peer into stormy gray ones, Draco’s face is flushed with embarrassment. “It just….feels more normal this way. I can’t sleep otherwise.” He offers, before turning on his heel and shutting the door behind him. Harry can’t help but feel as though he has invaded a deeper part of Draco, a part that no one else was ever meant to see. He is almost shaking with rage, partly from the indignity of how Draco was treated, and partly from the life that was stolen away from him as well.
“I just, can’t be a part of something like that anymore. I’ve been given a second chance at life and I owe it to myself to just be….
“That’s a great idea,” the Mediwitch agrees, “he’s had a calming draught and it should last a few hours. But Mr. Potter? Please get him back here in one piece. And if anything happens, promise me you will bring him back immediately.”
Draco has been in some sort of fight. The dining room table is flipped on its side, one chair completely in pieces, another on its side, and the third one oddly missing. A few paintings are crooked where they hang on the walls, and some framed photographs lay broken on the ground. The kitchen itself is a horrible mess of broken glass and crockery. The tea kettle lays shattered next to the table, two mugs flipped over with what appears to be tea soaking into the cream carpet. Harry blinks against the looming memory of blood, so much blood soaking into pavement below his feet. He takes a closer look at Draco, who’s got a fresh cut on his cheek, and thinks better of reaching out to sooth the wound.
I'm not sure how much more time has passed before Potter comes back into my room. He hisses when he sees me. "What have they done to you?" He whispers frantically.
“First off, what can you tell me about these kids? Any identifying features, was there a pattern of some sort?” Harry asks. The kids are the most perplexing part of the story.
"It's okay, Malfoy," his fingers glide, feather light, up around the side of my jaw and to the back of my neck. I feel his palm flatten on my skin there, as his fingers tangle into my hair. "I like it," he whispers, seconds before crashing his lips into mine.
I took a few liberties regarding the Wizarding World for the sake of the plot. Please, just go with it ;)
He is not in the kitchen, the drawing room, nor the guest bathroom. So that only leaves the bedroom. Why would Draco go to the bedroom without Harry? He buries that thought, gaining confidence as he walks over to the bedroom door and grasps the handle. It isn’t locked, and it opens with a soft ‘click’ as Harry peers into the darkness. He just barely makes out the outline of Draco sleeping on the ground in the corner of his room, covered loosely by a blanket, head resting on a large, fluffy pillow. Harry swallows back the acid in his throat and shuts the door quietly. He fumbles his way back to the couch and falls back into a restless sleep.
“And you,” Harry starts, stepping closer, “all you have to do is lay back.” Draco places his mug on the coffee table, sets his jaw.
“Is there anything you can share with me about Annie’s case that seems strange or suspicious? Whether it be about her medical condition or otherwise.” Harry asks her, grasping at straws.
“Now let me see that sonogram you’ve been hogging.” Draco tells him, snatching it from his loosened grip.
When Draco first opens his eyes, Harry misses it. He is in the shower, after having put it off for much too long for fear of missing it when Draco awakes. He steps out of the steamy room to see Draco sitting up, eyes glistening as he nods at a Mediwitch standing in front of him. She is explaining things about the curse that Harry already knows. It’s the main Mediwitch that has been caring for him since day one.
Harry can feel himself relaxing. He makes his way to the bartender and orders a strong drink, eyes skimming the crowd for a familiar face. The man he searches for is standing off in a corner, shrouded in shadow. He leans against the wall, watching the crowd, his dark, spiked hair glinting with shiny gel in the distance. Harry smiles, paying the bartender before making his way through the crowd. The throng of writhing bodies seems to ebb and flow around him, hands and body parts pressing onto him as he squeezes through with purpose. The dark haired man smiles, sickly sweet down at him, brown eyes flashing as his hand reaches into his black leather jacket pocket.
“No after that,” Draco tells him, “I told you that it looks like we’re just going to have to buy a much bigger home. And then you carried on looking like a kicked Crup. It was alarming, really, when you should be smiling and hugging and kissing me and all that lot.”
“No peeking, Potter,” Draco jokes, and Harry chuckles lightly. He finds that it is quite difficult, actually, not to peek, but does his best to remain respectful. He doesn’t want to do anything to fuck up this sort of peaceful thing they have going on. He enjoys that Draco is smiling at him and joking with him, and he desperately wants the other man to just be happy. It almost feels like…
“Okay, I’m ready.” And Merlin, he is so gorgeous in his outfit, it steals Harry’s breath away. The robes are a bit big on him, but otherwise he is absolutely stunning. It occurs to Harry that it probably doesn’t matter what Draco would have chosen, he is beautiful in anything. He gets choked up at the thought, overwhelmed suddenly with a flood of emotions. The fact that Draco is standing right there, that he’s alive. It feels like a new beginning of some sort. Harry’s heart swells with the hope of it all.
The first thing Harry notices upon waking is that he is in a complete stranger's bedroom. His heart begins to race as he blinks blurrily at his surroundings. His head is pounding, mouth dry, and limbs heavy. His eyes are burning at not having taken out his contacts the night before. He is in his boxers but he is covered with a thick, warm blanket. The room smells oddly familiar, although Harry can't quite place where he might recognize it...it reminds him a bit of Hogwarts, actually, a thought that makes his throat sting. But the most alarming of all is the lack of control of his wrists. They are positioned above his head in a manner that is quite uncomfortable, shackled to the head board. Harry's throat fills with bile as he struggles against his bindings, nausea coming in waves. What has he gotten himself into?
"And what about...?" I trail off. My hands begin to sweat as her face takes on that sadness it had when she first came in.
"Lucius Malfoy was killed in battle. And as for Narcissa, she...well she fought alongside the Aurors. She is alive, although a little banged up, but nothing too serious." She tells me. I blink in surprise. It hurts that father is dead, but the sting is not as bad as I thought it would be. He is the reason my family was caught up in this mess in the first place. He died thinking I was on his side, that I died for his cause. And as for mother...well...that is the last thing I ever would have expected from her.
He chokes back tears, tries to be reassuring, but inside he is fuming. But Merlin Dresden was such a
I nod dumbly. There is no fighting this. Everything is already out in the open. She brings the vial to my lips and I spread them open easily, allowing her to tip the bitter liquid into my mouth. I swallow, coughing slightly as it burns its way down my throat.
The next morning, Draco and Tilda are sat in the dining room having tea together. Draco looks much more relaxed than he had the night before. He had taken Harry’s advice and called her in today to talk about the cutting. Harry leaves them to their privacy. He can’t stop thinking about the night before and everything that he has witnessed. Draco has been acting so very strange, and, for all intents and purposes, it is almost as though he is continuing to uphold some part of the ritual. It stands to reason that his trauma has caused him to cope in such a strange way. There is even a possibility that his magical signature has been somehow altered by the blood ritual, since they know nothing about it, and it could even be compelling him to continue to uphold the parts of the ritual that don’t morally compromise him. But there is a sinking feeling that Harry can’t escape, that Draco knows more than he lets on, or even worse, he has been somehow involved. Even the mere thought of it causes his insides to twist with utter horror.
Harry lands a little shaky on his feet. Ron clamps a hand on his shoulder to help steady him. He speaks, probably to fill the awkward silence between them as they wait their few minutes for the incantation spell to pinpoint and send them to their desired location.
"Potter," I warn, seconds before my orgasm rips through me. I try to pull away but he holds me in place, swallowing down my cum like it's the most delicious thing he has ever tasted. My knees threaten to buckle out from under me. He pulls away, wipes his mouth with his hand, and flashes me a grin. His lips are red and swollen, eyes sparkling with something I can't recognize. I am almost hard again from the sight of him. With determination, I push him onto his back on the ground and return the favor. When he climaxes, I realize that maybe my cum
Draco, for his part, doesn’t break eye contact as he takes in Harry’s words. Then he sighs quietly as if relieved, and nods, a small smile appearing on his lips in a delicate manner. “I’d really like that, Harry.” He tells him, and all is well with the world again. And even though their first night together is absolutely uncomfortable, and Harry wakes up with horrible back pain, he thinks it’s completely worth it.
"Don't worry, I've got you." He says in mock reassurance, and he is grabbing roughly now, jostling Harry further back into the alley until he is satisfied with their privacy. He then pushes Harry down face first into the freezing, muddy ground. The worst part is that Harry can still feel all of it, even as he loses the ability to move entirely. He does his best to move his head so he can at least breathe. He is dying inside, the feel of the hands worming their way into his jeans terrifying him to his very core.
“Draco, you should never feel too ashamed to tell me anything. I meant what I said before, I love you and every part of you, cutting included.” Draco blanches slightly, but he relaxes under Harry’s touch. “Call her.” Harry encourages, “she is only here to help.” And Draco merely nods.
I would just like to say thank you to everyone who has read, commented, and given kudos so far.  Only one more chapter to go after this one!
Harry is hunched over his desk as he goes through his case notes for the hundredth time. It’s been a week since he’s spoken with Arthur, and since that point he has been stuck, unable to really find the courage to confront his wife. Arthur had insisted that there was no way Ginny or Annie could have known about Dresden’s relation to Annie. And Harry really wants to believe this is true, but he knows that as a good Auror, he needs to follow up on it to be sure. Ginny is going to be livid when he finally does confront her. He feels for the tiny vials that he has in his robes pocket and relaxes slightly as his fingers make contact with the cool glass.
I don't say any of this to him of course. I just let him hold me while he cries, allowing the tears to stream from my own eyes because honestly what does it even matter anymore? As a Malfoy I was taught my entire life that crying is a sign of weakness, but none of my father's teachings could prepare me for this moment.
"P-potter..." The voice is so faint that Harry almost believes he imagined it. He whips his head around, only to be met with the most beautiful and horrifying sight he has ever laid eyes on. Well, second most horrifying, anyway.
“We were supposed to go see Annie today.” She whispers, wiping at her cheeks before wrapping her arms around herself. Well fuck, Harry is the worst sodding husband on the entire planet. He’s been so wrapped up in his own shit that he hasn’t stopped to consider that his wife has been going through a lot as well. Annie is Ginny’s best childhood friend. They grew up together. Annie has been sick for a long while, is hospital ridden, something terminal. Harry can’t remember what exactly the illness even is. He hasn’t been to see Annie even once, although Ginny has really been wanting him to lately.
I sit in a holding room with two nameless Aurors across from me. My arms remain bound behind me, stinging with pins and needles. One of the Aurors, the male, clears his throat, accomplishing in getting my attention. In front of me on the table is a small vial filled with a clear liquid. The female Auror attempts a smile as she picks up the vial.
“Don’t tell Kingsley,” he pleads quietly, “I’ve been doing so well and…he is coming over tomorrow to discuss the possibility of me going back to work, of being your partner again.” Draco’s eyes alight with so much hope, that Harry fights back his own tears. The prospect of having his partner back fills him with so many mixed emotions that he can barely keep up with his own feelings.
“I’m thinking…how much I’ve wasted time and energy on us these last two years. I’m not even mad that you’re gay. I’m mad about how long you’ve been lying to me, going behind my back, too much of a spineless coward to do me the common courtesy of telling the fucking truth! You could have put us out of this misery so long ago.”
I had visited my mother first. She chastised me for doing all of it alone, but I could see a proud glint in her eyes. She confessed to me that everything she did was to protect me, and once I was gone she didn't care whether she lived or died. She wanted to find Potter herself and kill him for what he did to me. But she knew it was a losing battle when they arrived at Hogwarts to have the Aurors and light-bringers waiting for them, so she took her anger out on Voldemort and the Death Eaters instead. My father was very brave, according to my mother, and he died valiantly.  That was another last straw for her, just one more reason to join the side of light. When she found out I was alive, it was all she could ever hope for. She asked me if the prophet article was true. I answered honestly because I was tired of lying and tired of hiding things from her. I admitted I wasn't sure what would happen now. She kissed me on the cheek and told me to go to him.
By the eighth night, Harry learns that they both suffer from residual nightmares. Harry’s still revolve around Draco’s ‘death,’ and Draco’s revolve around his experiences while being held hostage by Dresden. He has one repeating nightmare where the ghosts of all the murdered children are haunting him, asking him why he allowed them to die, circling in until they have taken up all of his air and he begins to suffocate. Those nights are the hardest, and Harry does his best to hold onto Draco as he gasps for air, screaming into the night and asking why things had to happen the way they did. When Harry has his nightmares, Draco gently taps him on the shoulder until he wakes, then he wraps his arms around him and tells him everything is okay, and it’s enough to sooth Harry back to sleep.
“I had to be sure it was viable before telling you,” she explains, “no point if we were just going to lose it.” Harry can’t take his eyes off of the little fetus as it carries on with its loops and twirls.  “Harry, we’re going to have a son.” Ginny’s voice carry’s on. A son. Harry can barely keep it together there in front of his ex-wife and his current lover, all under the same roof, sharing this moment as one.
“You could have been hurt,” she starts, “I knew you were working on locating Dresden but I had no idea you were actually planning to
“I need more,” Harry gasps, pushing Draco down onto his back and sliding down his body, kissing the trail of hair there before taking Draco into his mouth in one fluid motion. Draco cries out in surprise, hands tangling shakily into Harry’s hair as Harry sucks him down as far as his throat allows. His own cock is thick with arousal, and Harry quells the urge to touch himself, choosing instead to thrust against Draco’s leg fervently. Draco is making the most erotic sounds as he bucks wildly into Harry’s mouth, and it’s almost too much for Harry to take. He feels Draco’s hands pushing at his shoulders until Harry relents and slides his mouth off of Draco with a delicate ‘pop.’
He is relieved when he finally reaches his destination, a strip of road bustling with bars and nightlife. Groups of young women cling tightly to each other as they stumble drunkenly around, laughing and singing, talking loudly at each other over the muted music drifting in from the many bars flashing “open” nearby. What Harry likes the most about this area is how open and free everyone is. It’s not just groups of women, there are men, too, and people of all different ages and sizes. People can dress the way they want, kiss whoever they want, and say whatever they want without fear of judgment. There are bars and clubs that meet anyone’s needs as well. For Harry, there is one particular night club that he likes to call his home away from home, “Evol,” a play on the word “love.” It’s a gay bar, something he didn’t know he had been missing until he stumbled upon it several months ago. He sighs contentedly as he steps inside, allowing his senses to take in the sensations all around him; the smell of sweat, cologne, and liquor, the loud booming of the rhythmic music in the background, and the heat of packed bodies twisting together on the dance floor.
He opens his wardrobe and grabs a pair of jeans and black t-shirt, dresses himself quickly. Harry grabs his coat and makes his way out, without even a glance at the mirror. His hair will do what it pleases, no sense in bothering. The sun is already setting, the sky partially illuminated with swirls of soft pinks and oranges mixed in with the grey. It’s freezing, so Harry wraps his coat around himself tightly. It’s fully dark before he reaches his destination, most of the streets and sidewalk are empty until he hits the main road he searches for. The artificial lights of streetlamps shine much too bright as Harry walks, head bowed, focusing only on his feet as they shuffle on the sidewalk.
“No, we’re uh, still trying,” Harry answers, voice coming out much too scratchy, “but Hermione and Ron are about to have one, a little girl.”
"Hi," he says it so softly it's almost a whisper. Yet I can't help but jump out of my skin from the surprise. I clutch at my chest and try to pick myself up off the floor in a grateful manner.
"Weasley," I sputter, "as lovely as it is to see you, I feel that it is so important to remind you," he scoffs at me but I can't help myself, "although the war can be pretty distracting, we still have the responsibility of practicing proper hygiene-" he screams viscerally before fisting my hair and slamming my head against the wall. I hear the sickening crunch as my vision swims with terrible pain. For a few scary moments I am unable to breathe as he crushes my chest with his body.
"Enjoy your last few hours, Ferret." With those words, he is gone in a flash. I unceremoniously wiggle about until I am at least in a position that doesn't
“Tilda and I have been working through it together,” Draco continues, and Harry holds back a smile at his mention of his mind healer, wanting to remain perfectly neutral so as not to scare him away. “It’s a coping mechanism, or so she says, which seems right, even if it’s the not the healthiest way to cope with my trauma….anyways, when I first came back, I couldn’t stand to use pillows or blankets, but I’ve built up to this point, and I think, I’m ready to try the cushioning charm.” It all seems to come out in one breath, and Draco’s hand is gripping Harry’s so tight Harry thinks it might be broken. But he dares not pull it away, and his heart only swells with happiness and adoration at the thought that Draco trusts him enough to share with him about these things.
“Ginny, if I had done that, someone else would be interrogating you in a cold office at the Auror station. Don’t treat me like this, you know I have to follow any leads on this case!” Harry is angry now, and he uses that anger to help bolster his courage. Ginny deflates at his words, placing her head in her hands.
Along the way back, Harry ponders what he will say to Draco when he wakes up. He more than likely will be confused, possibly even traumatized. Who knows what he has been through this last year. Harry shudders, remembering the state of him when he found him. He sits for what feels like at least a few more hours before the mediwitch approaches him.
Report out of the way, he makes a few official preliminary notes regarding follow up, leaving the part about someone working with Dresden out of it. He then looks into the situation with the missing children. What he finds is terrifying. In the Muggle world, Dresden is being called “the Lamia,” based off of an ancient Greek myth about a woman who transformed into a child-killing monster after her own children were killed by the Greek God called Zeus. 35 children were taken, all of them going missing anywhere from 3 days to a few weeks, and all of them randomly showing up again, tucked into their beds, or doing something mundane such as sitting on the toilet at their home, lifeless and drained of blood. Harry feels sick to his stomach. So Dresden was returning the bodies, which is interesting.
so goddamned much. I struggle to breathe for a few more seconds, willing my heart to slow down its treacherous pounding around my rib cage. My worst fears have been confirmed. And although I knew from Potter's face the night before that this would be what awaits, there had been a tiny part of me that had hoped maybe it wouldn't come to this.
I don't have to describe to him the gravity of our situation, but I do it anyway. "We both know that you have to win this war, Potter, and my life isn't worth the loss of countless others'. I'm just saying, don't let your emotions get in the way of our mission. If it comes down to it, you kill me, or you let me die."
"Yeah. I kicked ass." He jokes. We both chuckle lightly. He grips his head with one hand. "Ow." Our fingers remain interlinked, however, and it's something I am very aware of.
Potter presses his lips frantically against mine. His grip on my waist is tight as he ruts against my hips with his own. He has released my arms because we both know I won't be making any moves to escape. One of my hands tangles in his wild locks while the other presses into his backside. His tongue slides hotly into my mouth. He is intoxicating. Much too hot, I melt against him and allow him to take control. He presses me into the ground, finding that delicious friction that sends us both groaning.
He tries for a moment to put himself in Draco’s shoes. He has survived over a year’s worth of magical, physical, and psychological trauma, and almost lost his life for it. He is just trying to get back on his feet. And here comes his lover complicating everything by trying to throw a child into the mix. Rationally, Harry sees how this would be crazy to ask of the blonde, who has already been through so much. But the rest of Harry, the parts that can’t be bothered with rational thought, are screaming inside, pleading with Harry to do something,
Albus rushes up to Ginny, dragging a tinsel-decorated Draco Malfoy behind him, and takes his teddy, a soft, mint green bear that was a gift from Harry and Draco the day he was born. Draco scoops Albus up into his arms, and they giggle merrily up the stairs to Albus’ room. “Harry, be a dear and check the roast please!” Draco’s velvety voices floats down the stairs in his wake. Harry shakes his head proudly before ambling into the kitchen, Ginny hot on his heels. She sighs before sinking into one of the plush, crème colored love seats as Harry checks on the roast. It looks great and it smells delicious. Everything seems to be coming along right on track.
“Don’t worry about me, mate. I couldn’t sleep even if I tried. I bet Ginny would be relieved to get a good night’s sleep, for once. I am going to owl her right away. Besides, Hermione needs you more than Ginny needs me, I gather. What if she has another one of her late night cravings, or gets another Charlie horse?” The smile he shares with his friend is sincere. He is happy that they are having a baby… Honestly,
"That's very kind of you," I start, "but I want to be here when he wakes up." More uncomfortable silence. And then-
"Idiot boy!" Severus is on us in a flash. He pushes me out of the way. It happens so fast but it feels like slow motion to me for some reason. He points his wand at Dumbledore, says the words I could never in a million years bring myself to utter. My ears ring with the sound of Dumbledore's lifeless body as it hits the floor. Severus is saying something to me but I can't hear anything other than this ringing. I stand there, numb, all of my hopes at possible redemption are shattered with the death of the one person who could see me for who I really am.
He just needs to think. There has got to be a way out of this. What was Potter doing in the same club that Draco frequents from time to time? Was he looking for him? Draco thought he had covered his tracks and disappeared from the Wizarding world without a trace. He did not want to be found. He's worked so hard to make a new life for himself. He's got friends, and a life here. And it's been so many years, what could they want with him anyway? Draco's first thought is to go through the Gryffindor's pockets to see what he can find, there's got to be a clue somewhere.
“Is there anything at all that you can tell me about this blood magic that could help us understand what the ritual might have been?” Harry plunges, full speed ahead.
It’s a good plan, and it worked almost too easily. Kingsley now sits in a daze in the holding cell, with Harry and Ron across from him. He has taken the Veritaserum without a fight. He just looks tired and old, and he shivers pathetically in his seat. Harry feels disgusted and angry. He had trusted this man with all his being. Kingsley was here for him all the time that Harry thought Draco was dead. He watched him grieve, provided comfort when he was in need. And to think that all along he had been involved, possibly the whole reason Draco was taken in the first place, it made Harry’s stomach churn with acid.
My heart breaks at the seams as my mind races with these horrid thoughts. I'm so caught up in these terrible thoughts that I don't even realize there are two vibrant green eyes staring at me. He seems thoroughly pleased to find me sitting across from him.
“I need to know if he has ever come to visit Annie.” Harry continues, and Mary nods her head. She places her hand over her wand.
Harry should feel at home here. He should be grateful for the family he has. But his mind is racing with thoughts of the case. In this moment he finally realizes what he has been doing wrong, why he hasn't been able to get the incantation right. The incantation is ancient, rooted in deep, dark, and highly illegal magic. Harry needs to have dark feelings to use it. It is possible that he needs to direct his feelings of revenge toward locating the dark wizard that killed Draco, rather than simply casting clinically and hoping for the best. These spells are fickle at times, highly connected to the emotions behind it, much like unforgivables. He can barely contain his excitement-
Harry is able to trace the magical signature of the payment transactions to the cottage where Dresden had been hiding out. His stomach feels heavy, as though he had eaten rocks for lunch instead of delicious curry. He doesn’t feel like he is any closer to solving anything at all, just incurring more unanswered questions. He gives Mary a very large sum of money to continue Annie’s payments. It’s the least he can do since he feels somehow responsible, even if logically he knows that he isn’t. Mary thanks him profusely, and Harry stresses the importance of keeping the status of his donation strictly anonymous. He is assured that Annie will never find out and, even though Mary gives him a funny look when he requests this, neither will Ginny. He feels honestly tired and desolate as he makes his way back home. With this new piece to the puzzle, Harry knows what he has to do next. He really has no other choice.
"Did they make you look good, too? I swear if Skeeter messed this up..." he trails off and I look up at him in surprise.
He finds fresh pressed clothes and Auror robes waiting for him on the coffee table, folded neatly. As if he needs to feel
"Drake McAfoy?" Potter laughs, plopping heavily onto a dining room chair and taking sips from the coffee Draco has laid out. Draco wants to respond in kind, make a joke about Henry Porter, but realizes at the last second that Potter wouldn't be too keen on knowing he's gone through his personal belongings.
He feels hot breath on his ear, scorching tongue licking the shell of it as his rapist pants against him. "You're so gorgeous." He whispers throatily, and Harry tries his best to look away. Ahead in the distance, a tiny light seems to dance in midair. Harry focuses on that light as it moves up, illuminating the face of what could only be an angel. His angel leans against the wall in the far back of the alley. He has sharp, angular features, and hair that is so blonde it looks white is slicked back with purple and blue glittery gel.
, sitting on the floor, chained to a tiny corner of the living room. He is emaciated, with dark circles under his eyes, and long blonde hair that reaches down past his shoulders, but he is
Ron seems satisfied with this answer. Harry can tell he is very tired, and his shoulders seem to visibly relax.
Harry really doesn't care what happens to him after the fact. His tunnel vision is trained solely on vengeance. He is not thinking about how this could possibly ruin his career or even his life if the ministry were to investigate his actions too deeply. He feels a bit bad that he has dragged Ron into this, and his one regret would be if his best friend suffers any negative consequences. But they could throw Harry in Azkaban for the rest of his life and it wouldn’t matter to him in the slightest. He wouldn’t change his intentions right now for anything else in the world. Something very precious was stolen from him and he is going to do everything in his power to avenge it.
"Potter," I whisper into his hair. He hums in response, his fingers brushing softly on my chest, swirling in some unknown pattern. He is everything to me in this moment. I squeeze him a little tighter and brace myself for what lies ahead. "It's about the war..." I say lamely. He stiffens and dislodges himself from my arms.
Draco is standing in the middle of the bedroom, sleeve drawn up on his left arm, right hand holding his wand, which is pointed at his left arm. He has cast a cutting curse on his arm, and the same scar that Dresden left on him is now open as blood flows from it into a cup on a dresser that Draco leans over. Harry simply stands there like a fish out of water, trying desperately to process what he is seeing into anything even resembling normal.
Once Potter is secured in the bed, Draco closes the door with a soft click and finds his way into the kitchen. He pours himself a glass of water, drops some Alka Zeltzer and gulps it down, before stripping out of his heavy coat. Despite the chill of the outside, he feels devastatingly hot. His heart is pounding a mile a minute. He stumbles over to his bathroom and runs the shower, scrubbing the gel and make up from his hair and face respectively before climbing in. He finds himself finally relaxing as the hot water pounds over his sore muscles.
"They got away before you were hit." He looks defeated. His face is tracked with tears and dirt and pain. His eyes are emerald pools of sorrow. He stands tall and thin, darkness spreading from behind him before the door slams shut. I have to look away. I hear him whisper before the pain subsides and I feel suddenly clean and warm and dry.
“Is that not what we’ve been doing?” He seems genuinely confused, and Harry sighs before trying again.
“May I?” She asks, and at his consent pulls the wand out. She casts a quick spell and they both watch as magic sparks out, forming pictures of thousands of faces that flash quickly before both their eyes. Harry waits patiently as the spell searches through the visitor database before coming up with no match to Dresden’s picture. “He hasn’t.” Mary states needlessly. Harry cards his hand through his hair and encounters a knot, which he tries to comb through subtly, but Mary’s eyes bore holes into his head as she watches him.
“No it’s fine, let’s just get this over with…please continue.” He grits out, pointing in Shacklebolt’s general direction but still refusing to look at him.
“Hermione….are you even going to say anything about what I just told you?” He asks, and she blinks at him, looking sheepish.
“He’s…but wait…” Realization dawns on her eyes, “I had no idea about any of this, you know that, right?” She says, anger returning to her features. She looks affronted.
A lump forms in my throat, preventing me from speaking any of these thoughts. Potter is rutting more recklessly now, faster and harder and with no real rhythm.
“How the fuck do you know that?” He asks incredulously. Harry indicates at his pocket, where the shrunken pile of documents is hidden. Draco nods minutely, allowing Harry to reach in and remove the now tiny stack of papers.
Harry sends a Patronus to Ron and Hermione, who Apparate into the flat moments later. “Oh, Harry!” Hermione shouts at the sight of him. “Are you okay? What happened?” At her gentle touch to his shoulder, Harry falls apart. The tears come full force and he is helpless to stop them as his friend wraps her arms around him as best as she can. Her belly makes it quite difficult to do so, and Harry thinks for a moment that she must be due any minute. Ron surveys the area, and Harry can hear his muffled shout of surprise when he enters the bedroom. He fumbles around in his pockets and produces the documents, tiny once again for portability. Hermione takes them from him, and with an easy flick of her wand they return to their regular size. She studies the papers for a minute, stares at the picture for far too long, and then realization is made clear on her face. Harry sits down heavily on the couch.
The first few weeks are the hardest. Draco has a difficult time accepting just how much damage has been done to his body and magical core. He struggles with what he considers to be basic daily living skills, and has trouble allowing Harry to help him. But as the time passes, they settle into another sort of routine together. Draco’s days are filled with different types of rehabilitative therapy, focusing on fine and gross motor skills, as well as basic magical ability. He continues his sessions with his mind healer as well. Harry has been awarded 6 months paid leave for his efforts with the case, and he is grateful to have the time to help Draco to heal.
"24 hours right? And then I'm free to go." Potter has shut his eyes, laid his head down on the pillow again. Draco thinks he should probably release him from his shackles now.
Have I really been so transparent? I steel myself for whatever will follow, as I am too tired to deny him the truth. I feel two fingers, firm and strong, touch my chin. I almost lurch at the touch, forcing myself to meet his gaze.
Draco rushes down the stairs the moment the bathroom door shuts, realizing he has promised the Gryffindor breakfast. What the fuck was he thinking? He's not a proper host and he knows fuck all about cooking. He takes a look around the kitchen, not much to be found, no surprise there, considering he mostly survives on coffee, cereal, and takeout. Okay, well he can start with brewing some coffee, he at least knows how to do that. The fridge is mostly empty, cupboards just about barren, but there is a loaf of bread and he does have some butter. Okay then, toast it is. Draco fumbles around with the toaster oven, a gift from a friend. Honestly he hasn't quite figured out how to make it work, even though it's been a few years since he's had it. Cooking has been one of the main things to elude him despite having adapted to basically every other aspect of muggle life.
And just like that, my secrets spill out for all the world to see, one by one. I explain to them why we never told anyone what we were doing, to protect my family at all costs. I tell them each and every bit of information I ever shared with Potter in order to circumvent horrible attacks and minimize damage. I tell them about the things I have been forced to do or turn the other cheek away from. I have hurt people, tortured them, stood aside as innocent victims were tortured and murdered. I beg them to throw me in a cell in Azkaban, it’s what I deserve and more. I beg them to make it look like I died so that the Death Eaters don't catch wind of my betrayal. I stress the importance of this next attack that has been planned, that it could be the end all to this war. It might just be the last chance for Potter to kill Voldemort once and for all because Voldemort plans to actually be present. I stress that if Voldemort finds out that I am alive and being held captive, he will most certainly cancel this attack.
It feels like hours before the Mediwitch comes out to get him again. She tries to smile but Harry can tell she is not the least bit happy. She runs her hands through her hair and gives him a pointed look after standing in silence for a few moments. He stammers out an apology, and he means it, because he feels absolutely terrible. He tells her he has been giving this whole thing some thought and he feels it may be good to get Draco out for a bit, somewhere nice, to talk about anything other than his recent experience. He knows of a great restaurant, a fancy, posh French place that used to be one of Draco’s favorites. It may help him get his appetite back up, since he hasn’t been eating well since he’s been up.
“Everything is going to be okay.” He whispers, even though he doesn’t know that for sure, and allows Draco to just cry in his arms. Later, when the blonde is calmer, he asks, “Does Tilda know about the cutting?”
“Why?” She asks, words laced with agony. Despite his best efforts, the words slip passed Harry’s lips against his will.
He allows himself to puke out all of his insides until nothing comes out any longer, and even then he continues to dry heave for quite some time. He washes his mouth out with water and some toothpaste, using his finger as a brush (damn him for forgetting to grab his bag from the other side of the flat). Harry resolves that even if, and that’s a big IF, he has a problem, he is not going to sort it out with a man he hasn’t seen in years and who used to be his enemy. He will get through the rest of his allotted time here and then he will figure his shit out on his own, as he always has. He doesn’t need help, and certainly not from an ex death eater. He feels odd with that last thought, as if it isn’t true or he’s done something wrong by thinking it. But it is true, isn’t it? He reminds himself. He needs to get a grip, and fake it with gusto. He plasters on the best smile he can muster, wipes his watery eyes, runs wet hands through his hair (it doesn’t help), and makes his way back out into the dining room. Malfoy is already clearing out the dishes.
When there are no more gifts left to open, Harry takes a sweaty hand and pushes his gift over in front of Draco. Draco eyes it with interest before handing Harry his own small, wrapped gift. “You open yours first.” Harry tells him, and Draco nods as he scoops it up with his own hand. Everyone is talking softly to each other as they admire their presents. Harry is so nervous he can barely stand it, but he does his best to put on a brave face as he watches Draco unwrap the gift with cautious care. Draco gasps softly at the golden box revealed from underneath the wrapping paper, and he opens it to reveal a small snitch with zooming wings. He reads the engraved words out loud:
, the entire time I was kidnapped. That didn’t change - my feelings, I mean.” His throat bobs as he swallows thickly, running his fingers through his hair, his eyes churning with turmoil. Harry doesn’t like where this is going, although hearing him say those words out loud feels akin to a thousand pounds being taken off of his shoulders. Draco raises a hand as Harry tries to interrupt him, then continues, “But I had a lot of time to think, as well, about my life and the way I was living it. A-and, I decided, that things can’t be like they were before. I gained a lot of perspective, about right and wrong, and I know that, before, we talked about doing things a certain way. I know we discussed me getting married and fulfilling my familial duty of providing an heir, and continuing what we had in secret…”
I wait for what seems like another eternity for Potter to come back for me. When I do sleep, it's riddled with nightmares- my parents dying, Potter dying, being thrown in Azkaban for the rest of my life, etc. I haven't bothered to sleep on the cot, as the ground seems to retain just a bit more heat. Every once in a while someone comes in with some food and drink, but I don't feel hungry or thirsty. When I ask for any updates, I am told someone will come fill me in when the time is right.
By the twelfth night, it finally starts to happen. They are laying on the ground together after another round of mind blowing sex. Harry thinks that maybe, eventually, he could get used to the hard ground in the same way that Draco seems to take comfort in it. Draco turns to Harry thoughtfully, chewing his bottom lip worriedly, and Harry just stares at him openly, trying to remain as approachable as possible.
“You know mate…Ginny’s so fucking pissed at you.” Ron tells him, clamping a hand on his shoulder. Harry can’t tell if he is coming from a best friend standpoint or that of a big brother.
More time goes by. As I have more time to think I become increasingly anxious. What will Potter really think of all this, of being outed by a sleazy magazine with an even sleazier writer? Was he even planning on making our relationship public knowledge? Do we even have what could be considered a relationship? Now that the war is officially over, he can probably go back to his life as it was before. We could go our separate ways and chalk it all up to a tense situation. I mean, of course two boys would fuck each other to relieve stress during a scary, uncertain time, right? And what if Potter realized after all that my crimes are unforgivable? That I am just an unworthy monster incapable of being loved?
"Maybe you shouldn't laugh right now." I joke. My smile is wide and he returns it in kind. Then his eyes shift over to the Prophet laying on the ground.
“It was the curse.” Harry answers, “And I’m glad you’ve come to your senses.” He smiles earnestly before planting a kiss on Draco’s forehead. Draco tucks his head into the crook of Harry’s shoulder and neck, breathes him in, and speaks, his lips and eyelashes touching skin ever so slightly.
I'm being kept in the dark, literally and figuratively. It's infuriating but I don't have the energy to complain. I just sit and continue to wait. I'm tired. I'm terrified. There is nothing for me to do. Things are flashing through my mind at lightning speed. Things I should have said to him, things that I shouldn't have said. It's all too much and the waiting is almost unbearable. I am a tight knot of anticipation, ready to snap at any moment.
"My degree is on the table," he says distractedly, "along with my ID, if you want to take a look." He hears shuffling, presumably it's Potter inspecting the documents. He hears a rather loud and unbecoming snort from the table.
"Draco Malfoy, you are under arrest by order of the Ministry..." Someone is saying in the background.
Once inside, Harry puts away his groceries. He pours himself a double shot of rum, washes it down, and then forces himself to drink a glass of water. He can’t stop the tears as they fall from his eyes, so instead he wipes at them furiously and sinks down to the carpet. He makes a mental note to vacuum tomorrow, even as sobs begin to escape him and his body shakes with emotion. He gasps for air, screams, slams his fists into the wall behind him. It lasts only a few minutes before he composes himself and climbs to his feet. He finishes the glass of water, tosses the dishes in the sink, and makes his way to the bathroom, where he grabs a quick shower. The water doesn’t stay hot for very long, but Harry doesn’t mind. He doesn’t need a lot of time to wash up anyways. People are yelling at each other next door, the muffled sounds of it drifting through the walls as Harry dries himself roughly with a towel.
Their strides are wide and feet land heavy as they trudge out of the ministry and into the open air. It's sunny out, with the sky clearer than it has been in a really long time. Neither man stops to appreciate this fact. For Harry, it’s much too painful to think about the last time the sky was so sunny. Instead, they Apparate to an empty alleyway.
"They won't," he shakes his head, "we won't...this plan is iron tight, and the Aurors have been really supportive." He nods, as if he is trying to convince himself. Then he looks determined before he says, "like I said before, Malfoy, I won't lose you." And it's enough for now. My anger is mostly deflated anyways, and all that's left is a sort of tired indifference. I've done enough, I think. It's out of my hands.
He sits at the table with his breakfast and forces himself to finish at least half of the meal, despite the way his sour stomach protests or the way the nausea hits him in waves. When he’s had enough, he places the dishes in the sink to pile on top of the others. It hasn’t exactly gotten out of hand, but the dishes have started to pile and there is a slightly unpleasant odor that surrounds the area. Harry scrunches his nose at it before walking back over to his bed. Another mental note to do the laundry at some point, as the bed sheets are starting to smell a bit too. It’s times like these that make him miss the Wizarding world the most, as he could go for a simple cleaning spell right now. Regardless, he feels very tired, and with the pounding head and sour stomach combination making it difficult to stay upright, he decides that now is as good a time as any for a quick cat nap. He pays no mind to the digital clock on his nightstand, the red glaring numbers reading 10:00am.
Our first kiss is fierce and passionate and everything that I have ever imagined it would be. We moan and pant into each other’s mouths, hands touching whatever skin we can reach. Minutes go by before he breaks the kiss, a wild look in his eyes.
Harry is surprised to find Ginny up and waiting for him when he arrives home. The first thing he notices is that she does not look pleased. Harry knows this because her displeased look has become the new normal for them. He sighs and readies himself for yet another argument. Ginny sits at the table with an empty mug in front of her. She is holding a crumpled piece of paper in her hands, most likely the letter he sent her. Her face is tear streaked, hair pulled back into a messy pony tail, with red locks falling out in random places and tucked behind her ears. She looks pale in the dim light from the hallway that bleeds into the darkened dining room.
“Please, Harry, let me finish,” he is beseeching, and Harry clamps his hand over his mouth, trying to fight the tears that are threatening to spill.
Friday night is pub night. He and Ron and a few of their other guy friends meet up to drink and talk about nonsense. His mind wanders the entire time, but he still manages to smile and nod and laugh at the appropriate times. He has it down to a science, and really, only those closest to him would be able to tell that he is still hurting, that he hasn’t moved on. He comes home too late and much too drunk, which causes a fight between him and Ginny when his dick doesn’t manage to get hard enough for them to have sex. They fight about the same things; Harry’s inability to move on, his flaws, all the things he does wrong. She looks at him with so much hurt, casts a sobering charm on him, and fucks him mechanically without a word. He barely looks at her, keeps his eyes closed and focuses on what it feels like so he doesn’t disappoint her
“I’m listening.” He says genuinely. And Draco sags in relief. He removes the wand from Harry’s throat but keeps it pointed at him. Harry’s heart aches against his better judgment, wanting to wrap Draco in a hug and tell him everything will be okay. He reaches up tentatively to rub the sore spot on his neck, and Draco blanches, looking regretful for a split second before composing himself once again. The pieces come together in Harry’s mind and he is at once relieved and exhilarated.
“Not yet,” Harry says, “things have been….awkward at home and-” And Harry doesn’t know why he’s telling Draco all of this.
“Draco,” Harry says calmly, choosing not to jump to any conclusions and allow the other man to explain, “What exactly is going on here?” Draco chooses this exact moment to fall apart. He crumples to the ground, fists pressed up against his eyes as he cries openly.
“Thanks mate, I needed a good laugh!” Ron slaps him on the shoulder before exploring the kitchen, making different noises of approval as he appraises the food choices. “I think mum will be impressed.” He nods over to Draco, whose shoulders seem to visibly relax.
"We have been through this a thousand times Harry, what happened was absolutely not your fault. Do you hear me?" She is reaching out to him now, fumbling slightly in the dark until her hands are caressing his face. Harry understands that he should feel comforted by his wife's words, her tender touches. But all he feels is desolation.
" Harry turns toward the gruff voice and finds himself face to face with none other than Draco Malfoy's killer, a dark wizard by the name of Augustus Dresden, who is scrambling to vanish documents that are strewn about on the floor. He is dressed in tattered old robes, with salt and pepper unkempt long hair, long beard and mustache to match. He is tall and thin, but appears almost a bit yellow, like he has been sick with some kind of horrible disease for a very long time. His dark, beady eyes are darting between Harry and his documents, sweat breaking out on his forehead as he works tirelessly to vanish it all.
The wards tingle as Hermione and Ron floo in to the living room, their daughter Rose bouncing excitedly from between them. “Hi aunt Ginny! Hi Uncle Harry!” She greets them, “where’s Albus and Draco?”
I hope you all have enjoyed reading as much as I have enjoyed writing! Just a warning, this chapter is purely smut and sentimental fluff. Please bear with me, I am not used to writing so much happiness in one sitting. Sad/angsty/dark is more my style, but our boys deserve a happy ending!
The real test is hoisting the unconscious man up so that Draco can half-drag, half-carry him to his car. He instantly is struck with a sense of familiarity upon closer inspection of the guy's face. He looks a lot like Harry Potter. But there's no way that would be possible, right? Draco regrets not working out as often as he should have, because this man is fucking heavy! He is panting heavily and sweating despite the cold by the time they make it to the car. He tosses Potter wannabe (he might actually be Potter's muggle doppelganger, he looks so much like him) into the passenger seat unceremoniously and then fumbles with his keys to get the motor running so he could at least turn on the damn heater. This guy feels like a block of ice, and Draco thinks that is not a good thing at all.
He takes a deep breath, pastes a smile on his face, and looks up to meet Draco’s eyes. What he sees there is difficult to make out. Draco looks at him curiously, a slight frown set in his lips, shoulders a bit tensed. This is the one thing Harry was hoping would not happen. Draco seems to neutralize his face then, clears his throat, eyes flickering around the room a bit. It looks as if he is trying to think of something to say. His hands are folded tightly on the table, elbows hanging off of it in the picture of perfect elegance. Harry would have laughed if the circumstances were different.
"Don't mention it Potter, really." He says, attempting a smile, but really only succeeding in an odd sort of side quirk of his mouth. This is going to be more difficult than he thought. But he knows how to be professional. Treat Potter as another client, he thinks to himself, remain professional. Help him help himself, the sooner that happens, the sooner they can part ways. Potter gives him an odd look at that, but it's clear he is just feeling some discomfort as he winces again, playing with the crusts of the toast left on his plate and controlling his breath so that it comes in slow, even puffs. This must be difficult for the raven haired Gryffindor, to be suffering from withdrawals in the midst of an ex-enemy (Draco's not sure if they might still be enemies, although Potter did speak out for him at the trials, so maybe not? Who’s to say, really?).
Grimacing as he plugged his nose and drank down the rest of the brandy, Harry considered Ginny’s logic. It felt like an easy out for now and he almost wanted to say
“If you hadn’t come back for me that day…” Voice barely audible, Draco hated how small he felt. He chanced a look at Harry and found himself pinned again.
“It’s Malfoy!” Harry snapped, irritated that his friends were ignoring his point of view. “You believe me, don’t you, Ron?”
“Ah.” She pursed her lips, hesitating. “I’m not sure that’s my place to say, Potter. It holds a certain… Sentimental value for Draco. You’ll have to ask him for more than that, I’m afraid.”
“He’s got a point,” Hermione said with a shrug. “They’re still not all that forgiving on Death Eaters, even at the Ministry. It’s a wonder he doesn’t go mad just being at work each day.”
Ron had offered to let Harry stay with him last night so he wouldn’t be kept up by the constant scratching of Hermione’s quill and muttering at the disorganisation of documents she was poring over on the kitchen table, but in truth Harry was glad of her distraction. He suspected Hermione knew what he was up to, but she’d given up scolding him weeks ago and had instead settled for sending disappointed glares at him when he stumbled too close to her. Most nights were just exhausting, spent in a half-asleep haze perusing the empty rooms of Grimmauld Place and doing everything he could to keep his mind away from what sleep would bring.
With that she was gone, leaving Harry and Draco alone and though they were half a room apart, Harry felt as if the space between them was rapidly narrowing.
Shaking his head in a feeble attempt to chase the images out of his mind, Harry sighed. “I, er. It’s not really something you can help me with, I think.”
Stifling a laugh, Ginny reached for another glass of champagne from the waiter passing them. “Alright, so your love letters aren’t working. What’s your next plan?”
Draco stepped into line behind the two of them as Andromeda led the way to the platform, keeping his pace slow until Harry caught up to him. “You seem surprised to see me, Potter.”
Sliding his hand up to Draco’s shoulder, Harry pulled him close one last time and pressed a kiss against his jawline. “Stop overthinking today, alright? Everything’s going to be great.”
Looking down at the papers on the desk in front of him, Draco nodded. “Finalised as of about four hours ago.”
“No, no.” Malfoy brushed off Harry’s comment with a flippant wave of his hand. “The one you’re dating. Ginevra, isn’t it?”
Letting out a yawn as he tucked his book under his arm, Harry grabbed the tea he’d just made and walked into the spare room he now thought of as his own. He had planned to read for a few hours before putting the Santa presents under their tree but paused as he heard tapping at the window, curious as to who would be writing so late on Christmas Eve. Placing the tea down on his bedside table, he looked up to see the familiar owl waiting outside, envelope attached tightly to her leg.
Potter seemed to be the only other exception to this. Still taking his every meal with Weasley and Granger, now joined by an assortment of eighth-years and the occasional younger Slytherin, Potter could almost be mistaken for enjoying himself as everyone else was. But Draco had spent too many of his waking hours watching Potter: this was very carefully masked suffering, all too relatable for his liking. For both of their sakes, he was determined to do anything possible to pull Potter out of his pity party and hopefully hitch a ride out while he was at it.
Harry cleared his throat, glowering at both of the boys. “That’s enough, both of you. Draco did make some bad choices, but that doesn’t make him a bad person. We all make bad choices.”
Malfoy barked a hollow laugh as he tipped back the rest of his eggnog. Locking eyes with Harry as he placed his empty glass on the table in front of them, he raised an eyebrow as the corners of his mouth curled up in what wasn’t quite a smirk. “You can’t be serious?”
“Er…” Harry took a long drink from his glass before throwing caution to the wind. “Pansy told me to ask you about Secret Santa.”
inside him. He was almost able to put all of the day’s wondering behind him, almost able to pack all of the confronting thoughts of today into a box for a later date. Then he noticed a small red fleck getting closer to his windows and realised just as the poor bird was about to collide with them what he was actually seeing in time to open the one nearest him.
It did, and that was the problem. Her words were eerily similar to what he’d said to Draco earlier, but hearing it from Ginny made it all the more real for him. It was a lot for his head to take in, and he regarded his wife across the table as he took a sip and spluttered. It tasted like what he imagined muggle petroleum would taste like.
“Harry, dear. Do you happen to know a synonym for “in love” that might make it easier for Draco to admit his feelings?”
“Don’t worry,” Harry says confidently, “I’m sure you’ll get the owl this week. With your marks and the recommendation from the and Slughorn, I have no doubt you’ll get in.”
Harry thinks about it, his current plans for dinner had included last night’s leftover takeout curry and maybe catching up with his reading. Dinner with Malfoy definitely sounds like a more exciting affair and he does still have more intel to gather, it’s not like he’s learnt anything much today.
As soon as the lift doors open Draco stalks out, ignoring Blaise. He steps up the line in front of the Apparation Chamber, ready to leave Blaise behind if need be. He’s almost there when Blaise walks up.
“I used to have them every night,” Harry continues, aware that Malfoy is listening, “and I would wake each night terrified that I was back in the room. I could almost feel the heat of the fire on my skin, a heat so searing that I was convinced it was going to burn everything.”
There’s a lingering hint of vanilla in the air from their late night combined shower, making Draco tut fondly as he gathers the robes strewn across the floor. Any other day and he would have made sure to dump the dirty robes on his sleeping husband as a reminder to clean up after himself. Today, however, he lets it go thinking of the longer hours Harry has been pulling to prepare for the Wizengamot getting ready to vote on his proposed bill.
Pulling back lest he get swept away in a lustful haze of avoidance, Harry took a moment to breathe, feeling his restraint waver at the sight of dishevelled Draco that stood before him. Looking equally as out of breath and off-kilter as Harry felt, Draco gave a shaky smile before clearing his throat.
He noticed that Andromeda took a moment to answer, her eyes looking to where Draco stood first. “They’re magical, Harry. Sometimes they work in mysterious ways.”
First stop on the agenda was the new cafe that had taken residence in Fortescue’s old parlour space; though his heart panged at the memories, the other Aurors wouldn’t shut up about how great it was and a few were known to duck down on lunch breaks and bring back coffee for the office. Harry had been out in the field every time this had happened, so he figured he ought to take the opportunity while he was here.
Looking to see Potter watching him intently, Draco dipped his head again to avoid looking at those entrancing eyes. Why Potter felt okay subverting from surnames he wasn’t certain, all he knew that was that the first time his name had fallen from that mouth he’d been forced to throw a hex, for old times’ sake. It had nothing to do with how much he wanted to hear it again, and everything to do with the fact that he knew he was alone in this emotional crusade. At this point he wasn’t sure which was worse: the feelings he refused to address, or the tapestry before them both that housed a door so darkly charred it was evident it would never open again.
Hermione looked at him as if she knew precisely what had just transpired in his thoughts. “Just… I don’t know. Do what you want, you’re an adult. But be gentle with Ginny, okay? I’ve never seen two people work so well together in a relationship and yet I’ve also never been so intrigued by what keeps it working. And I’m sorry if that’s too much, I’m sorry if I’m overstepping. I’m observant, you know!”
The aggravated noise Draco made across from them was loud and exasperated; clearly this was something they’d spoken on a lot together. Astoria laughed gently, sharing a knowing look with Harry and sidestepping him to exit through the doors near the fireplace.
Harry quickly learned in the days following the Battle of Hogwarts that he screamed in his sleep. The nightmares were nothing new. The pain that came with them just seemed to intensify as time went by. Hermione had woken him the first night; they had opted to stay at Grimmauld Place in lieu of the Burrow to give the Weasleys some room to grieve, a decision which now seemed to be for the best. The look in her eyes was enough for him to place a silencing charm on his door every night following, but sometimes he had still woken feeling as if he was being watched. After a few more days of this routine Harry had decided that sleep was no longer a priority and now bore her judgemental yet worried stares with a grain of salt.
“Yeah, of course.” Seamus shrugged, fiddling with the quill he’d plucked off the top of the stacked boxes. “Just wasn’t sure if he’d popped in here lately. He mentioned wanting one of those new Scrambler kits…”
The room had been bustling with noise and activity moments ago and until he had stepped into the crowd’s line of vision, he had thought the sounds around him would drive his nerves to the edge. He hadn’t realised how much worse it would be once they saw him and began to stare. Anyone who hadn’t already been seated immediately fell into place as a hush swept through the courtroom and though he had been adamant that he wouldn’t drop his gaze, the pitying looks were simply too much for him to bear.
“You still might have,” Harry admitted, though the words felt like a lie. “Draco, why didn’t you just talk to me? We could have avoided so much of this.”
Glancing back up he saw Draco’s gaze on his again, uncertain and trusting. He leaned in, ready to take the plunge…
Having the grace to look sheepish at that, Harry ducked his head. “I, er, maybe use them a lot on the kids. I didn’t really have anyone looking out for me when I was their age—”
They both pulled on three, the resulting firework crackling in the air around them in vibrant blue and green hues. It took Harry a moment to stop watching as the coloured cloud settled. When he dropped his head back to meet Draco’s gaze he found the other man looking down at the torn cardboard in his hand, brow furrowed. Confused, he followed suit and saw that the cracker had somehow ripped into equal halves.
Locking eyes with the cracked corner of the tile once more, Harry played with the end of his robe sleeve as he thought about how to respond. He had hoped, stupidly, that maybe he could get away without talking about what had happened that morning. She was right of course—Hermione always was—but that didn’t make it any easier to talk about. The truth was Harry hadn’t even had the time to process how he felt or what had even been said in the court room. The past weeks had all been such a blur and though he’d been present for many trials, even spoken at a few, this was the first where Harry had felt the need to really defend the person in the chair.
Draco surprised both of them by laughing; a light, unguarded sound that continued to echo beyond the distance between them. Regaining his composure after a moment, he smirked. “Still keeping an eye on me, Potter? Some things never change.”
“Oh.” Harry looked to the back of the shop where there were at least twenty birds all clambering for attention, trying to screech louder than each other. “Any luck?”
Salazar, they had witnesses. Draco hadn’t even thought about who might be called on to speak during his trial. He doubted anyone in his family would be allowed to take the stand and his fellow Slytherins who’d been with him through the last few years were in Ministry custody or unable to be located from what he’d read.
“Not really, just one drink and then I’m out. I need to be up early tomorrow.” Pansy gives Draco a quick kiss on his cheek as hello before turning to Blaise, “So, mocking Draco?”
Draco feels any energy he managed to muster seep right out of him. The poor child is finally quieting down, strong sobs no longer wracking his little frame.
With a sigh, I lie down next to him and curl around his back, trapping his legs under mine as I wrap an arm around his waist. I nuzzle against the crook of his neck, breathing in the scent that is just Draco and can feel sleep creeping up again.
"Yes, well . . . " Draco starts as he finally turns to face Harry. Whatever he was about to say next is lost as he takes in the open box on the bed and Harry's sheepish expression.
“Yeah, she was my neighbour when I was growing up,” Harry says, fondly remembering old Mrs. Figg. “She took care of me when no one else did and even though she didn’t have magic, she was a proud member of the Order of the Phoenix.”
They talked twice a week, each Floo call shorter than the last as Harry struggled to stay awake. Draco was finding it harder each time to keep the resentment he felt at bay, that Harry picked something that was keeping him so occupied while Draco struggled to find tasks to keep himself busy.
“They’re my favourite,” Teddy offers shyly, staring at the bowl filled with them. “Harry doesn’t let me have lots though.”
"Well", Draco starts, coughs lightly as he finally looks up at Harry before quickly going back to pull at a stray thread in their blanket, "it's not anything new though. Just something I had laying around."
He calls Zeb, asking him to help Teddy wash up and then get started on breakfast. Draco waits till they’re out of the room to finally look at Harry. He’s seated himself on the carpet as well, arms wrapped around his legs.
“Yes, well. Glad you’ve managed to become more introspective this festive season.” Draco was rambling now, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s lips as warm breath caressed his face. “Perhaps you’ll start—“
Reclining abruptly, Draco grimaced. “You can’t… Why are you even telling me this? We can’t do this. We can’t talk if you’re going through this with your wife.”
“Harry.” She paused and he heard the papers in her hand shifting as she fidgeted. “That wasn’t a normal day, even by your standards. I just…”
“Dad,” Albus whined, really drawing out the syllable. “Scorp said that his dad told him everything. How come you didn’t tell us? Some kids didn’t know, but some did, and it was embarrassing.”
“We’ll save that conversation for another day.” Malfoy turned to glance at the grandfather clock in the corner and shook his head slowly, standing and brushing his hands on his jeans. “Lovely as this has been, Potter—”
“Oh,” Harry said. Sitting silently and listening to the clink of knives and forks against plates, he wondered what the Malfoys were doing. If Draco knew that their sons were best friends. If Draco was thinking about him.
Heart catching in his throat as he let the owl in and gave her one of Apollo’s treats, Harry tore into the sealed envelope so eagerly it was a miracle the contents were unharmed. A soft smile crossed his features as he took in the beautiful image; it was London, lit up with festive lights and a monumental Christmas tree in the foreground. Mild surprise came upon realising that it wasn’t moving, clearly taken by a muggle camera. Turning the photo over, his smile became an outright grin at the short message written in handwriting that he had dearly missed.
It went against everything he knew to be breathing easier than before at a time when everything should have been falling apart. Then again, his life had been so many “should have”s lately without enough questioning on his part. It takes a lot to question all you’ve ever known, even when its flaws are staring you in the face. He had been just a kid, he was barely of age and to be at a place where he could admit it was something almost admirable but it triggered so much unease inside him that he felt physically ill.
“Yeah,” Harry said, thinking back over their time together. Even in just the past year alone he’d seen a different side to Draco; they hadn’t spent more than a few days out of each month together, but it was incredibly to see how far they’d come. He could see it now though, how coloured Draco’s words and actions were by what Harry’d thought to be stubbornness but now recognised as potentially something more. Self preservation, to start, but Hermione seemed close to the mark when she said he probably still placed a lot of blame and need for penance onto himself.
Calling out for Molly, Ginny disappeared around the doorway and Harry slumped back against the wall, groaning as he let his eyes fall closed. When it came to Malfoy, why did everything have to be so difficult?
Eyes opening of their own accord, Harry broke out into a grin as the familiar warmth washed over him from head to toe and the electrifying feeling that accompanied it started to run through his veins. He felt
Draco took a deep breath and started once more to feel the warmth in his toes. This time, he imagined he was putting his toes out towards the fire and letting it slowly heat them, the heat then spreading to his feet, his legs, his stomach, his chest. He could almost feel the flicker of the flames as his face started to warm and he thought of stretching his hands out to the fireplace, palms warming as the echoing voices of his housemates filled his ears. Soaking in the warm memory, Draco felt almost like he could manage this. The place might reek of misery and despair but without the Dementors here, he could hold onto thoughts of a better time without the constant fear of having them taken from him.
“Er, yeah. That’s why I suggested it?” Cowering slightly at the glare she shot him, Harry raised his hands defensively. “I was joking?”
Hoping he didn’t sound as breathless as he felt, Draco gulped. “What about—what about everyone else?”
Harry snorted. “I can tell. You keep dodging all of my invitations to grab coffee, you claim that you’re never available—”
“Does that mean everything Scorpius said wasn’t true?” Albus asked, puzzled expression on his face. “Because he said a lot about the war, and I want to know what was true. His dad doesn’t sound like a liar.”
Harry felt himself blinking rapidly a few times, the words not quite making sense. “But why would that ruin your marriage? Even if I was… er, similarly inclined, for it to ruin
“And I won’t ask you to.” There was a determination to Draco’s voice, sounding almost like he was issuing a challenge.
Harry groaned. “Honestly, it’s nothing. And I’m sure it’s nothing to do with that. Can we just forget it?”
After a moment, Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well. If that will be all I daresay Harry has somewhere to be, wasn’t that right?”
“Bit late for that,” James said as he rolled his eyes at Harry. “Soon as Al knew he practically screamed it at us.”
Launching into a detailed explanation complete with wild hand gestures and excited-if-slightly-maniacal eyes, Hermione compared Wideye and Dreamless Sleep to muggle drugs that Harry had heard about with their depressant and stimulant qualities.
He swore as he considered this. Why couldn’t things ever just be normal for him? When he left the house this morning he hadn’t intended on ending up in St Mungo’s. He certainly hadn’t intended to get put on a strict no stimulant order without a solution to his nightmare situation.
Laughing, the two of them came closer together as they watched the chaos unfurl before them. Harry felt Draco’s arm brush his, the contact welcome after an afternoon of trying to keep affection to a minimum. Looking up at Draco beside him, Harry saw the happiness he felt reflected back at him, a warmth spreading through him at being surrounded by people he loved.
Andromeda’s laughter sung out from the lounge, making Harry wish he could hear more of what was being said.
Harry grinned for a moment, realising immediately that he had been wrong about Hermione’s giftee and more importantly, about Draco’s motives all along. He then swore quite loudly, realising that he had absolutely buggered everything up.
He was in Azkaban, of all places. The wizarding prison. Somewhere reserved for criminals and as his father always put it, people stupid enough to get caught. He should feel ashamed, hopeless, resigned to a life of misery and despair. But all that aside, he actually felt quite calm for the first time in as long as he could remember. True, he was in a barren cell made of century-old concrete worn down by pacing and filled with the lingering presence of the dementors. But he wasn't under You-Know-Who's reign anymore. He didn't have to watch his back at every turn, even in his own manor. He didn't have to constantly deploy Occlumency shields at every waking moment in fear that the Dark Lord would hear his inner thoughts, fears and fruitless dreams of defecting to the other side. Not that he would have ever been able to desert his family and friends. He just wished he hadn't been stuck without a choice in the first place. So yes, it sucked that he was in prison for an indefinite period. But he felt so much less like his life was at risk and for now that was enough to make him almost grateful to the witches and wizards who had put him here.
Suppressing a fond sigh, he should have known, Harry barely resists the urge to throw himself onto their bed and squeeze in a quick nap. He feels like he's running on fumes, having had to juggle an increased workload as well as what seems like countless meetings with Hermione and Mrs. Malfoy going over things he just didn't think were worth discussing half the time.
I sit back on my heels and look at him, taking in his slim legs, his tapered waist that still has bruises from last night and his back slightly damped in sweat. I want to taste every inch of his body.
It’s nearing eleven pm, and night has truly fallen. The path is illuminated by streetlights, the faint dusting of snow glimmering in the light. They walk together in comfortable silence, Draco still going over Everly's question.
Harry almost envies his puppy for a second. He then wonders when he started getting such weird thoughts.
“This room.” Draco waved a hand to vaguely indicate the space around him. “How long till they make me leave?”
who asked for some variation of Harry moving in, them living together, meeting the Weasley's and Scorpius's first day of school.
“You like buying him gifts and you’ve said it yourself, he loves making sure you’re comfortable. When not at work, you’re with him and don’t forget that time I walked in on the two of you cuddling; cuddling, Draco. You don’t cuddle with a fuck buddy.”
Loosely based on a prompt by Orlando_Switch! (I kinda glossed over everyone's reactions instead of going into too much detail!)
“Please,” Draco bit back, he was standing away from the door now. “Spending a night or two a week away will not make anyone doubt your abilities and you know that.”
Within minutes they’re both flat on their backs, breaths puffing in front of them as they pant with exertion.
If Draco had found himself distracted by Harry before, it was nothing compared to how utterly hopeless he felt now. Having Harry in the room was a challenge to his attention span.
With a sigh, Harry heads for the kitchen. He has an intense questioning session to look forward to now.
Thinking of the weeks of planning, how easily everything fell together and Draco's suit that he hasn't been allowed to peek at yet, Harry leans closer as Draco tilts his head up.
“Blaise,” Draco warns him, his voice calm, “if you don’t put me down right now, the Zabini line might end with you.”
Harry chuckles and toes the puppy away from his chair, where the little fellow had been trying, unsuccessfully, to chew the leg off.
Draco’s scowling now, glaring at the slowly changing numbers as the lift seems to take even longer to reach the Atrium.
As they walk down the street, warm drinks in hand, Ron can’t help but frown at the niggling feeling of foreboding that’s building the closer they get to Harry’s house.
“What is this place?” Potter asked, getting comfortable amongst the cushions Draco had continued sourcing from all over the castle.
Zeb already has the fire roaring while Milly brings around hot chocolate. Curled into Harry on the sofa, Draco watches Teddy carefully unwrap each gift.
Especially early in the mornings or later during the day, which is when he finally had the time to visit. With every visible surface covered in plants and pots of varying sizes and an array of earthy smells assaulting his senses, it was like entering an enclosed space that still made him feel like he could breathe. Though the walls were all glass, most of the outside view was obscured by leaves and vines of a multitude of shapes, colours and sizes.
"Malfoy," he calls again, tapping on the table with his knuckles. At his enquiring look, one perfect eyebrow arched, Harry waves in the general direction of his pocket. "Show me?"
“I dunno, something for your hair. I never thought to question it! I didn’t even know you could get pregnant!”
Hermione looks between the two of them. “Erm, Harry, I’ll just be in there,” she says and follows Ron.
“I’m a Healer for Merlin’s sake,” Draco groans, running a hand through his hair. The muted golden glow of the potion makes him pause. He feels vaguely off kilter, like the room was forced off its axis for a bit and then resetted, but nothing is where it used to be. Though there’s doubt creeping in, he has
They've definitely increased in frequency over the past year, she's gone from owning him about once a month to bringing it up at every other weekly dinner. Given the fact that he has yet to go beyond the first date with any of her picks he has a feeling it's become a bit of a personal challenge for her. He's okay going along with it for the most part, it's not like he's made much progress through his own efforts on the relationship front.
“I travelled, the Malfoy cofers still deep and filled enough to let me live a life of luxury without having to lift a finger. So I left my mother and all my demons behind; the Manor was, and still is, no longer a home for me. It’s tainted by the touch of darkness in every corner, and in the sole portion free from that shadow linger my father’s memories. He might not have been a good man, but he was a good father to me and it saddens me that Scorpius will never get to feel to his love.”
The man in question looks up at Harry in confusion, brows furrowed in confusion, and there’s no denying it. That’s Draco Malfoy.
“Come on, up with you, I’d rather not freeze out here tonight,” Draco says, holding out a hand to hoist Harry up and really, he should know better by now. “Come on . . .
“Umm, yeah.” Harry coughs, aware that he’s been staring. Following onto the heels of that awareness comes the realisation that they’re still in the same position as they slept in. He blinks and tries to subtly move his arm from where it’s wedged under Malfoy, who apparently has different ideas as he rolls over and tucks himself into Harry’s side.
“Oh,” Draco breathes out, his eyes dazed as he tries to find the source of the interruption. Before Harry can point Draco in the right direction, or kiss him again because he looks sinful with his kiss swollen lips and flushed cheeks, Scorpus runs in with Loki right behind him.
Draco startles, jumping back from the table. In almost slow motion he feels his chair fall back onto its back legs, it wobbles a little before tipping over backwards, taking Draco with it. He stays on his back, too stunned to move as he waits for his ears to stop ringing.
Draco looks up at Harry in confusion, noticing how the other is also dressed in his pyjamas, messy bed head making him look years younger.
I need to work harder than the others. I don’t want to give anyone a chance to say I only got into the program because of my name.”
Maybe it’s because he feels loose and warm in the way that wine and sleep can make him, the blanket nest is cosy and he feels like he can sleep for days, but Harry asks, “Did you not want to come in because it’s a Muggle’s house?”
“You’re so good with Teddy,” Harry breathes, his lashes fluttering against Draco’s hair, “we would be such good parents.”
Draco opens his eyes, blinking against the flashing lights. It takes him but a moment to realise that they have an audience and it leaves him feeling smug. He knows they’re a striking sight, and perhaps had he been more sober Draco would have been scandalised with the fact that he was practically humping, whilst almost half naked, against his boyfriend in the middle of a club.
” he reads aloud, tracking along with the instructions with his pointer finger. Sparing a sideways glance at the clumpy mixture in the pot, Draco groans in frustration.
“Always the celebrity, Potter,” Malfoy says, but unlike years before, when the tone would have held nothing but scorn and bitterness, he now sounds amused.
He’s busy the week after, assisting the DMLE with certain cases that require him to go in everyday. He’s still looking for his purpose, something to do now that his life is no longer planned out for him. It’s been five years and Harry still feels lost, waiting for a sign to point him in the right direction. While Ron is happy as an Auror, Harry is content to work as a consultant, offering advice when needed by staying away otherwise.
“Fine,” Malfoy grumbles, caving under Harry’s stare. “You’re right. I’m just going to head home then.”
Draco yawns as he slowly walks down the corridor to check on Teddy. The house is awash with sunlight, the warm rays peeking through the curtains to brighten up the space. They ended up sleeping in longer than they usually do, even for a weekend, the late night catching up with them.
“For Draco,” he says, bringing it closer to him. Draco happily accepts the piece, making a big show of how delicious it is and thanking Teddy profusely till he giggles. He allows Teddy to mix the wet ingredients as he slices the bread and remaining berries.
And then there are those drinks that make his head go fuzzy and often lead to cloudy judgements and decisions he wouldn’t take when sober.
Draco steps into the kitchen wondering if there are any more of those cookies left before he stops in his tracks. Harry is standing across from him, busy at getting breakfast started. He hasn’t realised Draco has entered yet, lost in humming a familiar melody as he gets the ingredients out. There’s a window right in front of where Harry stands, warm sunlight spilling around his form as Draco watches on and is hit by the memory from last night.
“Where is she these days?” Harry asks, helping himself to a chocolate frog when Scorpius offers. He almost gives in when Scorpius asks if Loki can also have one, but one look at Draco’s expression and Harry shakes his head.
Potter looked embarrassed, playing with the ends of the same garish scarf he’d worn every morning. Getting a closer look at it, Draco realised that what he had assumed were little specks of random colours were actually tiny Snitches.
Harry climbs up his stairs, stamping his feet to get the snow off his boots before stepping inside. Once he’s done shedding all the extra layers he had to put on before stepping out, Harry heads straight for his kitchen. Ron had dared him to eat the last bean from the box of Bertie’s Every Flavour Bean they had been sharing as they walked around Diagon Alley; he
“So, what’s going on between you and Malfoy?” Hermione asks Harry, eyeing the other man as he laughs along to something Luna says. Harry’s too focussed on how much younger Malfoy looks when he laughs, how he laughs a lot more around him.
“Would you like to come in?” Draco pants against his cheek, he looks debauched, his hair's a mess thanks to Harry’s hands, his cheeks flushed and lips kiss bruised.
Draco vanishes the bottle with a wave of his hand and throws his arms up, arching his back and jumping with the music. He shakes his head to get his wet hair off his face, spraying the people around him with drops of vodka. He hasn’t felt this reckless in a while, so uninhibited and relaxed, like it’s okay to let go, and he suspects it’s only because of Harry that he’s feeling this way. Aware that Harry will still be watching him, Draco puts on a show; arching his back and unbuttoning the top two buttons on his shirt. The crowd is pressing in closer now, he can feel the push and pull from the other bodies around him but it’s like their energies are feeding him, making him pull his carefully tucked in shirt free from his trousers.
In the end, he only picks the toy broomstick, giggling in excitement as Harry helps him climb on. The broomstick is Charmed to hover a few inches above the ground. Draco had absolutely loved it as a child. Seeing Teddy on it, however, he’s also filled with concern, and though he knows Harry is there to take care of him, Draco tenses each time Teddy so much as wobbles.
It takes him longer than he had though to gather the courage to actually ask Draco out. A week after the talking to Hermione, Harry finds himself in Draco’s kitchen, sipping on a mug of hot chocolate as Draco gets Scorpius’s dinner ready.
They start apologising together, each speaking over the other, begging for forgiveness. They fall into bed and create new memories to overshadow those that left bruises and aches.
“Oh, Harry.” Draco kisses Harry, pouring all of his love and feelings into that one kiss. “I love you, not the idea of some wedding that my mother has you convinced I once had. My dream wedding doesn’t have to be in some fancy vineyard, with imported roses. I’m happy getting married in our backyard, as long as you’re there standing next to me and Scorpius is with us.”
Malfoy sighs. “Fine. I’m sorry, you little baby. Now listen,” he says, squirming on his seat as he nervously plays with the condensation dripping down his glass, “I know you probably don’t want me here -”
The soft niggling tones of the alarm break through Draco’s consciousness, making him whine in annoyance. The chill of the cool October morning is seeping through the slight crack in the window and he wants nothing more than to curl deeper under his blanket towards the warmth his furnace of a husband radiates. As the alarm goes on, he sits up with a sigh, waving his hand to cut the noise off before it reaches a headache inducing volume.
Draco reached out to catch him as the other swayed again, arms straining to hold onto him as Potter started growing limp.
are getting too old for the shenanigans like last night. Thinking of the night before and the kisses pressed against his back as he arched towards Harry’s body, Draco smirks.
The park isn’t far from the Ministry office he works out of, the auxiliary departments spread across the city and connected to the main location through a cleverly designed system of Floo’s and what look like comfier versions of the Gringott’s carts. It had been a move deemed necessary after the war as the Ministry expanded, with departments growing the old location had started getting a little cramped.
Harry’s cut off as Emma comes to get them for dinner. Draco shoots him a questioning look, wondering what Harry was about to say.
He’s in the training room, peeling off his sweaty t-shirt when Hermione’s Patronus appears, making him jump back and knock his shoulder against his locker.
Teddy is still lost in slumber, the covers pushed down to the foot of the bed. Draco straightens his arm with a smile and tucks him back under the warm blanket. He can sleep in yet, it’s still early enough that the toddler can get a few more hours. Draco would love to sleep more too but he’s been feeling a little queasy, he hopes the anti-nausea potion will kick in soon because he’s
Scorpius scowls when he sees Harry but there’s no hiding his bloodshot eyes and the pitiful sniffling. Something inside Harry melts, the urge to wrap this little boy in his arms and to make everything better so strong that it almost brings tears to Harry’s eyes.
Harry is waiting for him at the bottom of the steps, eyes fond as he waves at the couple. The nearest Apparition point is a little way from their house, a perk of living in a Muggle neighbourhood. Harry offered to walk down together and Draco was quick to say yes.
The last ingredient will be handled by Emma and the other experts at the lab, while Draco will take care of the first three. He has to start by isolating each ingredient, studying their nature to plot possible variants and then test each hybrid with the potion to measure against potency.
“I need to get this to Emma as soon as possible,” Draco says, giddy, trying to gather everything he needs to send.
“No, listen,” he urges, moving till he’s next to Malfoy on the sofa. Before he knows it he’s placed the cup from Malfoy’s hand on the side table so that they can hold hands. “It’s okay. Perfectly. There’s nothing to be embarrassed  about.”
The fact that Draco is no longer nervous about asking Harry, feels comfortable enough to just invite him over is what makes Harry say yes.
He is ready to give up when he feels a tug on his trouser leg, a tiny chocolate brown puppy, with the most brightest blue eyes Harry has ever seen, is waging a one puppy battle against his trousers. He tugs and tugs, till his grip slackens and the little thing goes tumbling down, but he’s up and ready again, growling at Harry’s leg.
“Would you like to stay for dinner, Potter?” Malfoy asks; he’s looking at Harry with a calculating expression, as if he’s waiting for something from Harry.
The Harry in these photos is smiling more often than not, Draco has a knack for capturing him mid grin or lost in a laugh. As he takes in photo after photo, Harry is blown away by the thought that this is the Harry that Draco sees.
When Harry had first suggested the idea of a combined holiday, looking all shy and bashful as he blushed throughout, Draco had been apprehensive. And also a little excited.
With each passing day Draco feels closer to a breakthrough, the investigation narrowed down to two possible additives. If he can identify the right one, Emma can run it through their list of suppliers to note which of them had access to it.
Harry looks up at Malfoy, hoping he’s doing the right thing. Malfoy nods at him, his expression once again confusing Harry, giving him the impression that he’s being tested.
“Pat it in like this,” Draco shows him, watching as Teddy lightly pats the soil into the plant bed, looking up at Draco for approval after. At his nod, Teddy lights up, eagerly thrusting his palm out for more.
way to unwrap gifts. Teddy is showing Scorpius the new model Quidditch Set that his Uncle Ron gifted him while Scorpius tries on his Weasley sweater.
Harry gives Draco a kiss, holding his hand till he feels the effects of the anaesthetic spell take over and Draco’s asleep. He wishes he could go in with Draco, whisper in his ear throughout the procedure but they’d known from the start that due to the fact that Draco was having twins, the less people in the room the better. Something to do with the twins fluctuating magical cores.
The story ends here for now. I might add a vignette or two soon because there are still some prompts and scenarios I feel I want to touch upon. If there's
As they prep Draco, Harry hugs him fiercely, promising him, “You’ll be okay. We’ve gone through the procedure with the Healer loads of times. Within minutes they’ll get our boys out.”
“Harry,” Draco exclaims softly, one hand coming up rest on Harry’s cheek. “Why are you running yourself ragged? You’ve been stressing about the wedding for weeks now.”
Malfoy chooses that moment to look at Harry, his eyes bright and a shy smile gracing his lips as he quirks his head in question.
Harry turns and catches Scorpius with a laugh. The little boy giggles and tucks himself under Harry’s neck, holding on tight with one hand fisted in Harry’s sweater.
Draco skidded to a stop next to him, huffing as he tried to catch his breath, all the while staring at the other in concern. He looked pale, deep dark shadows pooling under his glossy eyes as he blinked in confusion.
It takes some manoeuvring but I’m finally able to ease up behind him, letting my arms take all my weight as they bracket him to the bed.  In one careful push I line myself with his entrance, the head of my cock resting against his hole. It takes all my willpower not to just push in. Besides the fact that I don’t want to wake him up, I also don’t want to hurt him.
I could mark him all day long. And for all his complaining, I know he enjoys it. I’ve seen him reach out to trace the outline of a bruise under his shirt when he thinks no one's looking. But I always am and this has led to us to christening almost every loo in the Ministry. He always leaves with more marks than before.
Meeting Harry’s eyes with a defeated stare, Draco shrugged. “Then I guess I’ve satisfied the Malfoy name with that lie after all. I’ve stopped myself from being happy, Harry. More than that, I’ve been a selfish prick and you deserve better.”
. He couldn’t think about the feelings right now, for fear he’d never come out of his spiralling thoughts.
“Maybe this isn’t just about you, Draco. Not everything has to be about you!” Harry was frustrated, running a hand through his hair as he speared Draco with a meaningful look. “If I’m trying to save anything, it’s this. Us.”
Head and heart full of love and longing, Draco did his best to ignore the tainted vines threatening to wind their way inside his happy childhood sanctuary. His body settled slowly as the shaking ceased, breathing finally evening out as he drifted off to sleep once more.
“I know,” Draco said, cutting off Harry’s protests. “You left for work. Thank you,” he added as Mary set their drinks on the table between them. “Now can we change the subject please? You can even give me hell for drinking my 'boring' drink. This is me giving you explicit permission.”
She’d gotten stronger with all the Chaser training, it seemed. Harry’s head screamed in protest from where it had made contact with the wall and he frowned, unsure what he had done to deserve this rough treatment.
Peeking out from behind his fingers he saw Hermione drawing her wand and complied, placing his hands on the table between them.
Throwing her hands in the air, Pansy shrieked. “Merlin’s beard! If I have to spend another holiday season with Draco moping around about absolutely everything... Except Harry Potter, of course, because there’s
Taking a seat on his bed once more, Harry summoned his shoes from beside the door where he’d kicked them off yesterday and slid the scuffed trainers on before grabbing a set of crumpled black robes off the floor, tossing them over his shoulder carelessly. One day he might master ironing spells but for now, he knew Hermione would take offence to them and do it for him. He stood and made his way over to the door, checking that he had his wand and grabbing a bag of galleons from atop the dresser to stuff into his robe pocket once he threw them on.
“Good.” With that, Malfoy gave Harry a curt nod and an uncertain grimace that could almost have been mistaken for an attempt at a smile, before turning on his heel and disappearing with the rest of the Diagon Alley population.
“Yeah.” Harry let out a sour laugh, shaking his head in frustration. “Yeah, because despite how ridiculous you’ve been, I still want this. And I want to believe that things could be different, Draco, I really do. But you have to understand that you’ve gotten my hopes up and then run away too many times now.” Pleading tone creeping into his voice as he spoke, Harry’s words were a desperate whisper. “I’ve given you so many chances.”
“Er, yeah. I should probably get going.” He turned, catching the puzzled expression on Andromeda’s face as he did so. “Is this…What does this mean?”
Pansy barked a short, vicious laugh. “You’re about to feel a whole lot worse. What did you say to Draco last night?”
Draco laughed softly, the sound not quite reaching his eyes. “Just wondering how things might have been different.”
Hesitating, Draco chewed on his lip as he thought for a moment. “You know that we can’t tell anyone.” At Harry’s immediate nod, he shook his head. “I mean it, Scorpius comes first.”
“—But Master does not clean himself, so Kreacher thinks unless the Muggle-born is going to clean up after Master—“
Nodding before reaching to tangle his fingers with Draco’s around the woolen scarf, Harry whispered back. “What’s mine is yours. All of it. I’m yours.”
the new way he’s wearing his hair and how much you just want to run your fingers through it. I believe earlier you mentioned that you
, of course. Your pain is my pain, but I’d like the rest of you, if you want me. I don’t need what you’re not willing to give. Just… Us. As we are, right now.”
Shocked by the raw sincerity behind Draco’s response, Harry paused for a moment as he watched Draco’s eyes meet his briefly before dropping to stare at his feet.
Freezing like a deer in headlights as Harry felt the eyes of the entire pub turn and stare, he sank down in as chair even as Hermione realised she may have shouted too loudly.
Cheers erupted from every house in the vicinity as a new millennium dawned and with it, what felt like a fresh hope for wizardkind. Harry turned his head to Ginny beside him, pulling her close and pressing his lips to hers for a moment before separating with a grin.
“What do you want me to do about it?” Harry asked in a small voice. It was starting to make sense to him the more he sat with it. The more he thought on it, the more he considered Malfoy in those
“—and it’s one of the things that I love about you most.” A fond sigh sounded, Draco shifting slightly behind him as he removed the hand on one of Harry’s shoulders. “You’re always trying to do the right thing, trying to see the best in others. Even me. Especially me, though Merlin knows sometimes I don’t—”
“Stop being so mean.” Darting his tongue out to clean the cocoa that he could feel around his mouth, Harry frowned as he watched Draco take a keen interest in the spectacle. “No, no. Don’t make fun of me for choosing the messy drink.”
Stepping into the doorway and leaning against the frame, Hermione tilted her head towards him. “I’ll give you a hint. He had the same loved up expression on his face as you right now.”
This was the first time they’d seen each other since then. A few owls had gone back and forth after that—Harry had even gotten one letter delivered by Hestia while he was at work—but then Harry had gone away on a case and had to remain untraceable until his return last week.
Draco snorted, finally meeting Harry’s eyes as he shook his head. “Not yet. I mean one day in the future. They’ll attend Hogwarts, of course, and the Manor is a respectable place to grow up.”
Watching Ron walk off to the bar for their next round, Harry drooped in his chair as he felt the weight of the past few days catching up to him. It was hard enough to stay switched on all the time for the benefit of society, let alone to keep his best mate in good spirits. Maybe he’d have to give into sleep tonight after all. He’d managed, what, four days? Five?
He appreciated it, he truly did. He’d never had anyone to care about him before Hogwarts, and Harry definitely wasn’t about to take his friends for granted after all that they’d been through. It was just—
“Does it look like I’ve had any luck yet?” Malfoy snapped, before grimacing. “I mean… I didn’t really get far, before that man pulled his wand out.”
Giving him a weary smile, Ginny nodded and turned towards the bedroom door. “Thanks. I just need a few hours.”
This was ridiculous. He needed sleep—there were more events tomorrow, of course there were—and yet all he could think about was how detached he felt from his life right now. Flickers of the past few weeks flew by in his mind but that was all he could grasp; he felt like he was watching a montage of someone else’s life and he was intruding by knowing the few details that he did. Even this anger he felt right now seemed borrowed. And that enraged him even more.
he was frequently there or what he did with most of his time; Harry had narrowed it down to something finance-related at this point. Many mornings later in the year had been spent in London catching up over coffee—
“Okay,” he began cautiously. “Does this mean that—when you’re back in the country, of course—we can be, er, not-friends again?”
“I’m terrified,” Draco admitted after a moment. “At first, I thought it was because of what the world would say. This study was my father’s, you know. I haven’t seen him since Mother’s wake,” he added with a sigh, a sadness seeming to come over him. “He’d be horrified if he saw what I’d become.”
Clearing his throat, Malfoy accepted the proffered glass and clinked it against Harry’s, maintaining steady eye contact as he took the first swallow. Harry felt his cheeks flush as he watched the movement of Malfoy’s throat, his tongue darting out to wet his lips, the glint in his eyes as he reclined in his chair and stretched his legs out before him.
“You don’t have to do it right now,” Ginny said softly. “But hopefully one day you’ll realise that you deserve to be happy, however that looks for you.”
“Don’t make excuses. Please. I waited around for you for years and then again when you left last year and I can’t do it again. Not if you don’t really want this.”
“No, you idiot. Aside from Pansy being the type of girl who probably needs sex, she’s also not my type at all.”
Certain that his racing heart could be heard all the way in Hogsmeade at this point, Draco focused on slowing his breathing as he tried not to get ahead of himself. “What is it about then?”
Hexes were thrown, pranks were pulled: their friends didn’t seem to understand why they couldn’t come to a truce—
They’d had a slight argument a few days prior, though Harry still couldn’t entirely understand how it had come about. After a perfectly pleasant afternoon spent with Teddy and Andromeda, Draco had joined Harry for a drink at his home up the street. Two glasses of wine in and suddenly Draco was sullen and tight-lipped, nothing like the man he'd grown to know and everything like the boy Harry had seen immediately after the war. It had come out of nowhere, that was the worst part; try as he might, Harry could not connect his abrupt change in behaviour with anything the conversation had touched on. Work…Quidditch…Their respective friends…Merlin, they’d even managed to laugh about some of the things they’d put each other through in school. It seemed like Draco’s mood had come about when Harry had mentioned his new fiancee, though Astoria had come up many a time during their weekend coffees throughout the year without any mood swings he could recall. He’d only been asking if there was a set date for the wedding yet. He and Ginny had decided on April, with the invitations about to be sent the very next day.
Many great things had happened when Harry had quit the Aurors. Spending more time with his children—by extension allowing Ginny to go back to work full time—had been the immediately obvious benefit, but as the years went on he realised just how much he had tangled his own identity up with the idea of fighting the bad guys. The sense of self he’d managed to reclaim was unlike anything else he’d experienced, and having more free time to explore his interests was fulfilling to no end.
“Gee, ‘Mione. That really narrows it down,” Harry said, taking great care to keep his face as neutral as possible. He now had a very good idea of who she’d seen in the DMLE that morning; he’d come home with Harry last night after their Christmas light outing and woken him up very enthusiastically before work.
