“So you were in control to some degree?” Harry asked despite himself. Now that they were talking about it, he wanted to know more. He wanted to know more about Draco’s past.
Harry rolled over so he was on top of Draco, he kissed Draco’s nose. “Yeah. Totally. Definitely. Soon.”
Draco nodded, flopping down into what Harry by now considered Draco’s chair. Draco hardly spent any time at his own little flat anymore.
Laughter soon turned to screams. His screams, loud and echoing and horrendous, until the silence came.
Draco’s fingers found his nape and then he started to stroke that spot at the base of Harry’s skull that made him feel boneless.
Draco rubbed his temples. “Me and Blaise are a bit more hands on, but you will have to read at least something Potter.”
Draco thought it over. He could trust Blaise, he was under no obligation to publish with his last publisher. In fact he was pretty sure they wanted him to write something a bit more lighthearted, but that was just not Draco’s style. Sex wasn’t romance and Draco didn’t think of himself as a romantic.
“What will I do? What will Draco do? He’s been declared dead. The last Malfoy heir, gone. His mother has left the country… what will the Ministry do once he shows up? They’ll see him as a threat, Antoine.”
“Tea is ready in the parlor,” Luna said from the door to the kitchen. Pansy was nowhere to be found, as she did not like even breathing the same air as Ministry officials. Draco normally didn't either, and he would have been fine serving them nothing at all in the kitchen, but Luna had better manners than the both of them.
“Call for the cavalry then,” Draco hissed. He could feel the strain in his bones, in his blood, it felt like his veins were being pulled out of his body. “Oh, fuck.”
“I know that,” Draco said. He looked at the wine in his glass and then looked up sharply and directly into Harry’s eyes. Harry had been studying his features – had been absorbed in the task if he was honest and he felt caught now by Draco’s eyes on him. “Do you think you might be on the killer’s list as well, Potter?”
“I can contact someone from home to consult on your curse problem. I bet you don’t want anyone from around here,” Ivan said.
“Well, there are rumors of course about the new book,” a young witch a table over said, and Draco tried not to react to it. Speculation about his new book were rampant to put it mildly.
“You don’t decide my worth, Weasley,” Draco replied and then stepped away, slowly. There was still a chance he might get hexed by Granger after all.
“Very good,” Antoine threw in with a smile. He was drawing mindless patterns on Draco’s chest. It was kind of hypnotic.
Bloody hell, Draco thought. He was going to be Potter’s bodyguard and not only his teacher in all things wizard. Great, just great.
“Are you here because you’re still trying to buy me dinner?” Draco asked, crossing his arms over his chest. He was wearing robes, he was pretty much always wearing robes and Harry had no idea how his body looked underneath. Robes concealed an awful lot. Why hadn’t he realized that before?
“Yes, you do and food. Go and make yourself presentable and then I’m going to take you out for breakfast,“ Blaise said.
Draco kissed the tip again and then pulled Harry’s underwear down until his cock was fully exposed. This earned him a moan and a curse when he blew on the sensitive tip.
Potter spun around then and Draco let go of his shirt and stepped away. He was feeling as breathless as Potter looked.
The gate was open and he pushed gently to see if he would be let in. Once he was sure nothing nasty was going to attack him, and why would it really, he stepped on the grounds.
“As a child I was sure that I was loved and as far as I can tell you never had that, so of course you’re going to doubt any kind of real deep affection and connection.”
It should not have surprised Draco to find Potter on his doorstep the next day, but it did. He looked at Potter, and his forest-green eyes looked steadily back at him.
Harry nodded, but didn’t say anything. Maybe he had made peace with Dumbledore’s machinations a long time ago. Maybe he just didn’t want to think about it all right now. “People one table over are speculating about Belladonna’s new book,” Draco said.
Harry had thought about it all long and hard over the last few weeks he had been working with Draco and Blaise. He couldn’t really remember his feelings for Cho, or Ginny for that matter, and it probably should have troubled him, but didn’t. He could however still appreciate their beauty, he still found them interesting and arousing. “I still like girls, but there is something about boys – some of them are pretty. I mean, Blaise is really good looking,” Harry explained.
“But why me?“ Draco asked. His plan had been to keep his head down, finish his last year of school and then leave the country and start a new life somewhere where no one knew him. Or his father.
Draco’s eyes were like daggers. “Get lost Potter,” he said and then just turned around and started walking.
He sighed. Hell would not be any help. He took a breath, it wasn’t like he didn’t know how to write these kinds of letters. His father had taught him well after all.
Harry nodded. They hadn’t had another incident for over ten days. He also hadn’t spoken to Draco Malfoy in over ten days, though he also hadn't tried to contact him. Luna had informed him that Draco wasn’t taking any visitors.
For what, Harry wondered. Because despite everything, he was still in love with Draco. He wouldn’t be here if not for Draco. He -
“I would have declined, because I like to have my own money and be independent and you’re too young to be my sugar daddy.”
Later when he was on his way home again, he realized that Draco had not answered the other important question. What was Draco doing for money these days? Harry shook his head, fondly. At least Draco had agreed to let Harry buy him dinner again.
He didn’t think being inside Draco would ever get old, but it was special this first time and they both knew it.
“I still made choices,” Draco said, because he had. He had weighed everything and decided that his life and the lives of the people he loved were worth more than others. And he was pretty sure he would make the same choices again.
“No one knows. Their minds are blank. His wife and son had seen it happen. They were also marked. Which is a new one,” Astra said and showed him photographs.
And Harry did, slowly at first but faster and harder with every encouraging moan and word that left Draco’s lips. When Harry sensed that Draco was close he curled his fingers around Draco’s hard, leaking cock and stroked it in tandem with his thrusts. It didn’t take long for Draco to spill all over Harry’s hand and himself. Harry wasn’t far behind.
“It will be fine, Astra,” Harry said and then took a sip of coffee. Draco watched his throat work and then put his wand down on the table. He needed to get a grip. He had never felt like this before. Well, yes, back in the day when he had been obsessing about Harry Potter and funny enough now he knew that Harry had been obsessing about him in return, but this was more, this was deeper. And it was frightening as well. He’s been here before in a way: on the edge of losing everything and he had made it through. It had cost him dearly, but he had made it. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him and looked up. Their eyes locked and as cliché as it was, everything inside Draco clicked into place.
“Fair enough,” Blaise said. “I still have to warn you. If you hurt him I will end you and I don’t care that you are the hero of the Wizarding world, you understand me?”
Harry hadn’t thought about Draco in years. In fact, not since the trials years ago. But now Draco Malfoy and what he was up to, if he was still in Great Britain, if he had children was at the forefront of Harry’s mind when he went about his days. All of these questions seemed to be burning inside him.
It wasn’t romantic in a typical sense, but Harry had to admit that it fit them. He stood and walked over to where Draco was sitting on the leather sofa. Harry had to admit that he loved Draco against the soft leather of the sofa or the armchair. He caged Draco in, and Draco looked up, his grey eyes were so expressive, and then Harry leaned down and kissed him gently on the lips. He didn’t want to start anything, he just wanted to let Draco know how much this meant to him, how much Draco meant to him.
He stepped outside in the garden and took a deep breath as the grass tickled his naked toes. This was better. As he stood there looking over his wild garden, a scene from ‘Amongst wolves’ came to mind and he wondered if H.J. Belladonna had been looking at something like this when he or she wrote it. For some reason that made him smile. It was like a tiny thread of connection had been spun between Harry and the mysterious author.
“He probably thought I was dead. I thought he was dead, so...we didn’t look for each other. But now the situation is different. He will come for me, once he is sure I survived. He will want to finish the ritual.”
“Maybe I will,” Harry said.  His hands were on Draco’s hips now, his thumbs caressing Draco’s pale, pale skin. He had no idea when that had happened, but he wasn’t going to question it either. When Draco’s naked skin was involved things were just going to happen.
“He has to share it, right? That’s what his ancestors want?” Harry asked. An idea was forming in his head, an insane idea that could lose him his job, or even his life.
Blaise shrugged, but his dark eyes were shining. “Why not? It will surely be a scandal, yes, but it will also promote the book. I think the people who really liked your books, would still buy them, and you being, well you, might get you new readers.”
Harry dug his nails into Draco’s back and Draco hissed, but did it again and again and again. Harry never came without a hand on his cock before, but he did now. It took him by surprise. Draco didn’t stop fucking into him, now harder and faster, racing toward his own orgasm.
“Oh,” Harry said. He was fascinated. No one had told him about glamours just yet. “Can you teach me some?”
“By all means, let me welcome you to my home, Auror Potter,” Draco replied and got up from his chair.
“By talking to him,” Harry answered. He was still kind of a little bit surprised that Draco had talked to him, but of course Draco was different from the kid he had been over ten years ago. Harry was different too.
Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose. “It will get better. And it wasn’t your fault, Draco. It was them.”
“Yes, but after?” Harry pressed. “What do vampires do? Do you have a job you have to go back to? Little fledglings you need to keep in line?”
It was not the life he had imagined as a kid, but except for the Visions, the cause for them, and his little problem with human touch, he was doing alright.
“Okay,” Harry said and swallowed. Did this little speech mean that Draco was one of the people who didn’t like penetrative sex? Would that be a deal breaker for Harry, he wondered briefly.
“Meant to be?” Draco dared to ask, because he was feeling it too. That thing, that invisible threat that was drawing him to Potter and that was drawing Potter to him as well.
“I was right sixth year,” Harry replied. He had been right sixth year. He wished he hadn’t been right and the events in the bathroom still haunted him sometimes in his dreams, but mostly he had come to terms with everything that had happen. Getting away from it all had helped with that.
Draco waved his hand. “If I could get rid of the curses and blood-spells that way, I would burn it to the ground,” he said. “You are welcome to stay here as long as it takes. I care nothing for this place.”
Draco obliged happily. When he pulled away, Harry was breathing hard and his hair was a mess, because Draco had carded his fingers through it, had pulled and pushed, so their mouths aligned perfectly. Harry had let him. Draco had found out pretty fast that Harry was totally fine for Draco to take the lead. It was a strange and heady feeling.
“You missed dinner!” Luna said. He hadn't heard her come in. Her eyes moved from him to the painting. “Oh,” she said.
“I’m afraid I’m not as pretty as I used to be,” Draco replied, making no move to take off his clothes. He told Harry to get closer to the barrier, putting his hand right over Harry’s chest and sliding it down. Harry couldn’t feel the pressure, but he could feel the heat, and he could see Draco’s eyes focused on his face. It made him feel hot in his skin. He was getting harder by the second.
“I do wonder sometimes what would have happened if you had taken my hand that first time we met when we were eleven,” Draco added.
“Yes, but will people buy them once they know a former Death Eater had written them? I don’t think so Pansy.” The income from the books was his only income and there were talks about translations into other languages, which was good, but he wasn’t swimming in money. He couldn’t risk having his identity exposed, not for another few years at least.
Harry grabbed his wrist and kissed the Dark Mark. Draco had had it redone, but it was still the Dark Mark, a reminder of who he had been and what he had done. With these new powers coursing through his veins he could have gotten rid of it, but he didn’t want to. He made it better, prettier, more his, but it was still there.
“Oh, Merlin, no,” Draco gasped as he fell into the old, battered, but still very comfortable pale green armchair. He had dragged it up here with Blaise by hand since the cursed thing couldn’t be moved by magic because one of his ancestors had wanted it to stay at the manor forever. Draco wasn’t living at the manor anymore—thank Merlin—but he had still wanted the chair, come what may, so they did it the Muggle way.
Harry grabbed one of Draco’s legs for a better angle and pushed inside, slowly. Being inside Draco’s tight heat felt incredible.
“You don’t know that. I’m sure we would have found a way to get where we are now, somehow,” Draco said.
“I’m not afraid because I know you won't hurt me – in a bad way,” Harry gasped. Draco was so good at this and he was so close, but he needed more. He needed to taste Antoine’s lips.
“You look like something my cat dragged in,“ Blaise said from the sofa. Draco’s sofa, in Draco’s tiny flat.
“I don’t think you need pretty words from me, Draco. I think you want reckless honesty. I think you like my reckless honesty,” Harry answered, and Draco was in his personal space in a matter of seconds, his mouth was crushed against Harry’s, Draco’s tongue was invading Harry’s mouth. The kiss made Harry’s stomach flip in a good way. He was ready, he was so fucking ready. “I want you to fuck me, Draco,” he gasped between kisses and Draco shoved him so Harry was sprawled on the bed.
“Complicated is why I feel like you might want to end this once you can choose again who you want to fuck, Draco,” Potter said.
“You like it when I’m mean,” Draco said, but he was smiling and that was something Harry hadn’t seen in a long while.
“Harry will protect him. When it comes to protecting Draco he has a very good track record, Pansy,” Luna said.
“You can be cursed, so you can most likely profit from this as well,” Harry replied. “You do drink water, so…is this going to be a problem?”
Draco had half a mind to protest, but then just nodded. A bit of fresh air would do him a world of good.
Draco laughed. Hell, was Potter flirting with him? It certainly sounded like it. “You think I’m dangerous because I’m powerful?”
“Tell him,” Harry answered. He had no idea how he would tell Draco that they had failed and that his childhood friend was dead, but he would do it somehow.
Draco didn’t wait. He disappeared into the dark shadows the manor cast. Harry wasn’t stupid enough to try and get inside. By now Draco had most likely strengthened the blood magic inside and around the manor.
It was so weird to Draco that Potter and Blaise weren’t only friendly, but on their way to becoming friends.
Potter shook his head. “I didn’t mean that. I believe you when you say you woke up to body parts everywhere, but what if it wasn’t the ritual that killed those people?”
Draco nodded. Their fortune had been seized pretty much right away. After the trial he and his mother had spent two years abroad, but the Malfoy name and the things his father had done had followed them like a curse. It had been a shitty few years.
“Yes. We have eight victims so far. Ivan thinks the heart you painted in both Visions is somewhat important, but I’m more concerned about my face on those canvases,” Potter said.
“The way that Henri and I see it—and I am sure you and Bears came to the same conclusion in the last few days—is that someone is trying to do to these people what was done to me.”
Draco smiled, it was a razor thin thing and it made a shiver run down Harry’s spine. It wasn’t totally unpleasant. “If thinking that makes you feel better.”
“I already died once,” Draco replied. “I’m not keen on a repeat, so I will take care.” He stepped closer to Harry. He was becoming Harry now; Draco could not keep him at bay any longer.
“I think that justice and vengeance are the same thing sometimes, and if there is no one who can stop me, why should I stop?” He kissed Harry’s frown away. “Besides, I like working with Henri.”
“It was an opportunity to get what I always wanted: to be your friend. So yes, that was my reasoning behind it, but maybe, maybe I felt that pull too. Felt it from the first time I saw you, Harry.”
Potter had only one suitcase, but that was more than enough. Draco could sense the magic on Potter's suitcase after all. There were probably a million things inside it.
“But you can roam the whole place and the pleasure gardens outside?” Astra said, it wasn’t really a question.
“A toppy top who likes to top? Yes, Draco I figured that one out and still here I am and I think you should do something about the state we’re in now.”
“You feel so good around my cock, Harry,” Draco said and it went straight to Harry’s heart and cock.
“Not all of them. Lovegood and Longbottom are still his friends, so are a lot of other people. He is in love. He finally has someone who will never betray him. Who will love him until he dies. Because I know you, you will die by his side, follow him to the ends of the world. Would probably settle with him in muggle London.”
“I love you too,” Harry said, because he knew that this was Draco’s declaration and his claim, and he wanted to state his own in return.
Of course, Harry’s little bubble was burst when Astra came by two days later to tell Harry the news about Goyle.
He nodded; he was hungry, and if he was honest with himself he wasn’t too keen on being in the same room with ‘The Artist in Agony’ either.
He woke up in the middle of the night and grabbed for his pastels. He wasn’t looking at the paper because his mind was somewhere else, somewhere green and lush that tasted bitter on his tongue. Like regret, though he wasn’t sure if it was his or someone else’s.
“He marked me too,” Potter said and brushed his hair aside to show the scar. Draco had kissed it last night as he fucked Potter slowly.
“That was the word I would have used, too,” Draco replied. “Luna already sent a picture to Henri." Henri Devereux was Draco’s contact at the Ministry of Magic. They got along alright.
Harry smiled briefly before he got serious again. “Okay, that is unexpected. Why did you keep it a secret?”
Harry smiled. “Yes, I did, and I hope Draco and I can count on you two to have our backs this time too?”
Draco looked at him for what seemed like an eternity, his grey eyes sharp, calculating. Harry was fully prepared for Draco to just leave him standing there without an answer. But Draco had always surprised Harry, not always in a good way, mind you, but the fact still stood.
Draco reached into his nightstand drawer and came up with lube. Harry nearly sighed in relief; things were finally progressing to where he wanted them to.
“I think you would make a great teacher, Harry,” Antoine said. “You have a nicely screwed moral compass.”
Draco was not amused when he felt the wards stir. He knew it was Potter before he heard him enter, and was proven right when he heard him greet Luna.
Antoine thought about it for a moment and then nodded. “I will talk to her alone, she won't want to meat with you.”
Draco privately thought that that was not true at all. Draco kind of liked it, if he was honest with himself. But he would let Potter assume, because Potter had always liked to assume things about Draco.
“I hate the title, and I think you should bury that thing,” Pansy said. “Not sell it to some sick person who would probably get off on it.”
“I will provide security. Before you start, Draco. It’s so I feel better. I want you to be safe and I don’t want you to hex anyone. I don’t want anyone to get hurt, especially not you, okay?” Harry said.
“Ron is right. Malfoy is…well, we don’t know what he does for a living or where he lives or what he has been up to the last ten years, but if it had been anything shady, the authorities would have done something about it,” Hermione said. “You don’t have to do this anymore.”
“In his mind you were supposed to be the hero, but you failed him and his sister, Harry,” Granger said gently.
“And what is it that you are figuring out?” He asked, sitting down at the table. They were in a cottage somewhere, nowhere, it was their base of operation now that they were actively searching for the hidden medical facility.
“I want these people behind bars, so I can live my life undisturbed again. So that the only things we have to think about are: eating, sleeping, and a lot of that glorious fucking we do so well. Maybe work as well.” He turned to Harry and kissed him gently. “Besides I am not worried.”
“Something else,” Draco replied and touched his hand to the barrier as well. Harry could feel the heat of Draco’s palm but nothing else. He could hear Draco perfectly too, like there wasn’t anything separating them at all.
“No,” Draco said eventually. That ‘no’ was so final that Harry didn’t know what to say. Draco looked back to the manor and Harry followed his gaze. It seemed to settle on a pair of windows on the first floor. He wondered if that had been Draco’s room. He wondered how that room had looked when Draco had been just a kid.
Blaise gave him a pointed look. “I don’t know Draco, why would anyone of use want to do something like this?”
Suddenly, Luna’s disembodied voice was right there beside them. “The wards just started up. Someone's coming."
Luna grinned at him. “I’m great at finding out secrets, comes with the job. But honestly Blaise Zabini doesn’t make a big secret out of it. I guess his mother raised him to be proud of who he is.“
Harry nodded. He didn't even feel offended. There was always the possibility that a wizard would use that knowledge for their own selfish reasons.
He nodded, perused the menu, decided on a slice of quiche, a salad and slice of chocolate cake. After their food was brought they caught each other up on their lives, but the thing about Blaise Zabini stuck with Harry for the reminder of dinner, even if neither Luna nor he had brought it up again.
The knock on his door startled Draco so hard he nearly spilled ink on his document. He turned around and glared. It was Potter of course.
“Yes, I know that the Ministry thinks he’s some kind of joke, but he isn’t, Potter. He’s smart and respectful and he told me everything he knew about your case. I asked for pictures of the victims, and I have to admit they look awfully familiar.”
“I can’t remember any of that. I don’t feel anything when you tell me stories about our adventures. I’m sorry, but that is the truth.”
“Draco,” he said, because other words failed him. There was no way to describe it, but he hoped that Draco knew how good he felt around Harry’s cock. He took a moment to just breathe once he bottomed out.
“I’ll be at the cottage,” Harry said and apparated back to the house he had shared for weeks with Antoine. There was nothing he could do, but wait for Draco and Antoine to come back. Harry was pretty sure that the woman wouldn’t be with them. Antoine would find a safe place for her. Far away from any wizards.
“Well yes, Draco...good for you,” Pansy said. “I’m more concerned about the thing where you might be the only witness to a murder and a serial killer might want a piece of you.”
“But,” Bears said, frowning down at the parchment, “Mr. Malfoy died and came back. That was not supposed to happen.”
“Yes, because the other option I have right now is you and – that doesn’t seem like an option at all.” Draco was aware that this was kind of an invitation. Maybe it was the Firewhiskey that made him say it, maybe it had been the days and days of proximity to Potter. They had been dancing around each other basically from day one after all.
“At that time? No, I don’t think I did. But maybe I deserved this for what I did after,” Draco said.
He woke up to insistent tapping on his bedroom window and groaned. He was really tempted to throw a pillow at the bird, but it wasn’t the owl’s fault that he was still very tired. He turned his head and used that bit of nonverbal magic he had learned abroad to open the window. It wasn’t very impressive nonverbal magic, but it was very handy at times like this.
“Are you staring?” Harry asked, he could feel the blush creep up his neck, but his cock was still interested in what was going on.
“I am glad you chose a dark alley with no witnesses around,” Draco replied. There weren’t many spells he could do wandlessly, but he had learned some on his travels. He had no time to play around. Harry was waiting for him at home. He drew the sigil in the air and heard Julien gasp a second later. The wand at his throat wavered and then fell to the ground. Draco stepped away and looked at the man who had killed his friend, who had marked little Krabat for life. Anger and hatred were rising up inside him.
“You don’t believe that. You know what we did was right. No one died in the process either,” Harry said.
McGonagall gave him a look over her glasses and then intertwined her fingers on her desk. She had always been terrifying, but as headmistress she was downright scary Draco thought. Still. The question had to be asked.
But he knew Draco Malfoy more than just briefly. There was a red string (or maybe green and laced with silver – who knew?) tying their faiths together, tying them together. It seemed that he couldn’t escape Draco Malfoy and neither could Draco Malfoy escape him.
“I don’t like that there has been no new victim in weeks,” Bears said. “And yes, I know exactly how that sounds, Mr. Malfoy,” he added, probably because Draco had given him a look. Draco was good at giving people looks.
Draco was not having a good day. For one it was way too early to be up, or maybe way too late, for another, Ivar was a fucking difficult character to work with, but trying to work on anything else hadn’t done him any good, so Ivar it was.
Draco shrugged. At this point he didn’t even really care if it got published, this one felt different. He was self-aware enough to know that all of his characters were pieces of himself in a way, but this one was – this one was a whole other deal.
“If that is the case,” Antoine said and got up, crossed over to where they were siting and bent down to kiss first Draco and then Harry, “I will take care of some of these things now.”
Suddenly he felt like he needed to be away from Potter and his too green, too sincere eyes. He had the insane urge to bow but caught himself in time and just nodded at Potter and then made his way down the stairs and into his study. Once he was behind solid wood doors, he took a shaky breath. This was not going like he had thought it would go. His heart was beating too fast in his chest and there was something like fear coursing through his veins. But really, what else was new? Potter had always been bad for his health.
“Well, fuck,” Draco said. He turned slowly and saw Harry sitting on the daybed. “You’re still here.”
“Yes,” Harry said, because now that he had Draco back there was no way in hell he was going to let him slip away.
“People change,” Harry cut in. He couldn’t tell her that he had always felt drawn to Malfoy, that now he was pretty sure that this was meant to be, because Astra wouldn’t understand it. Hell, he barely understood it. But it was there, and it was real, and it had been in the making since that day at Madame Malkin’s.
Hermione exchanged a look with her husband. “You were right back then. But what is this about? So Malfoy claimed his family home, so what?”
Auror Bain nodded. “Granger looked into Lerch’s past too. He was in his fourth year when the Deatheaters took over the school. He was also tortured by Grabbe and Goyle.”
Shit, Draco thought, but he wasn’t going to apologize. He was basically a prisoner in his own home right now and he was on edge because someone wanted to see him dead. He nodded.
Potter ran a hand through his unruly hair. It was charming now, not a mess, but a nest of soft looking wild curls Draco would love to run his fingers through.
“You’ve been up here for hours,” Pansy said from the door. She wore her dark hair long these days, and it suited her. She and Luna were perfect opposites. Like Potter and I, he thought wryly.
“Yes, so it seems,” Harry replied with a smile. “I would like to go over to the Manor with you and an expert on curses."
“It’s still wet,” Draco said. It was a whisper across his neck, and Potter shivered. They were so close he could feel Potter’s body heat; he could smell him. For the first time in over ten years, he wanted to feel skin against his own. He could hear Potter’s breathing, could feel it too, through the shirt, his fingers curled in the material and he breathed Potter in. He felt like a beast scenting his prey. Was Potter feeling it, too? Was he afraid? Or excited like he had claimed to be earlier, when he was around dangerous things?
“Excuse me?” Harry asked. The boy was pretty. But then most people here were. Pale and delicate and with a wild edge. He reminded Harry of – Draco. Not in his appearance, but in the way he held himself. Something about the barely tamed wildness in his eyes.
Harry nodded. “I can’t work for them anymore. I actually don’t need to either. I’m not exactly hard pressed or money.”
He rubbed the bridge of his nose. What the hell had he been thinking? He shook his head. He should go home.
It hit Harry in his gut that smile. He had never wanted someone so baldy like he wanted Antoine when he smiled like that. Was that why he had wanted Draco? He wished he could remember more about the weeks he had been with Draco. It was bloody frustrating.
Harry stared at him, his green eyes first lighting up then going dark with anger, as piece by piece of clothing fell to the hardwood floor. Draco could have done it with a thought, but this had more impact, and that was what he needed now. He needed Harry to see. To see him and what Joel had done to him. He hadn’t let anyone look at his naked body in a long, long time, but he himself looked at it regularly. He traced the shapes of the symbols that were scars now, staring at himself in the mirror sometimes for hours.
“What did it matter? I didn’t think you would remember a goddamned thing about those weeks, Potter!” Draco said, getting up and pacing the small kitchen. “I’ve been there years. I didn’t think I would ever get out. Should have known better,” he added, wryly. “But why the hell did you have to team up with my lover?”
Draco gave him a look. “Of course I fought, but I was drugged.” He shrugged like there was nothing more to add.
“Fuck, you really were a model student, Harry,” Draco gasped between kisses. Harry had to stop fingering Draco for short periods of time, so he could lean down and kiss the hell out of that pretty mouth. He just couldn’t help himself. He liked seeing Draco’s lips kiss swollen and basked in the knowledge that it had been him who made those lips look that way. He had always been slightly possessive with his lovers, but being with Draco took that trait to new heights. And he wasn’t alone in that either, Draco was just as bad, or maybe even worse. While Draco didn’t like being marked in any kind, not even in a semi-permanent way, not even by something like a hickey, he loved to leave his own marks all over Harry’s body.
“I dreamed about this, I didn’t know it was this, but about you. You crying and blood, so much blood.” He cupped Draco’s face. “It was bad, wasn’t it? You nearly died.”
Harry had never really thought about that, but Ivan was of course right. The Dark Mark was a stain, and even with his excellent grades it would have been hard for Draco Malfoy to find employment in Britain.
“He thinks it would make great offices, just a bit of remodeling and he could build his empire from there.”
“She wants me to do it, because Potter feels safe with me,“ he wasn’t going to tell Blaise that she said Potter took to him like a duckling to fucking water.
Harry gave him a questioning look. Draco after all was the nearly indestructible and immortal one. And that was something that Harry wasn't going to think about now. He was a wizard so he would live longer than a normal human being, but...but Draco would live longer still.
“Luna said you were just unlucky to be the son of a crazy, power hungry, pureblood fanatic,” Harry replied and Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
“I don’t think it has anything to do with the Manor. It was more that the spells of the ritual were finding new pathways to work and it took some time and this—condition, is a side effect of that.”
“The only people who know about Mrs. Bellke's death are Bears and me, and the Aurors that got the case. They don’t know she was here because of me.”
Blaise only went because Draco told him he was fucking Potter now and pretty sure Potter would not let him die. He kept the case of feelings he had developed to himself, but he was sure that both his friends knew anyway.
“Useful,“ Draco echoed and knew that Blaise was right. The school had taken them back, but it was pretty clear that their house wasn’t looked upon favorably and that pretty much everyone else wanted them gone. Life would not be easy for anyone who had been in Slytherin before the war.
“You are not what I would call convenient, Potter. What I would call it is ‘complicated as hell’,” Draco continued like Potter hadn’t tried to answer his question.
Draco grinned like he just read Harry’s mind, but didn’t comment on it, as he continued, “But I want to be able to leave my house at my own free will and I want to kiss you senseless in a crowded restaurant, so everyone knows that you are mine now.”
Harry had no doubt whatsoever that Draco cared for him, that he might even be falling for Harry as well, so he waited Draco out.
“Because everything is water under the bridge now?” Draco asked, anger slipping into his tone. He didn't like how Potter always got a rise out of him. On the other hand: it went both ways. It was only a small comfort. He didn't give Potter time to answer before he continued. “It seems to me that it's not. Not for everyone. If it were, we wouldn't be here right now, would we? This,” he pushed the sleeve of his shirt up and showed Potter the Dark Mark, a bit faded for sure, but still so visibly there and a reminder of his, of their past. “this still seems to matter to some people.”
Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose. He and Draco hadn’t had that particular talk yet. “I don’t want to hide him away.”
Ron and Hermione exchanged another one of those looks. She put her hand on Harry’s. “Just remember that whatever happens we will be here for you.”
Potter leaned on the table, his face in his hands and looked at Draco. “This will be dangerous, Draco and it is my job, my literal job, to protect you.”
Neville nodded. “He’s broke, really, it’s the only asset he has. Maybe he lives there now, who knows.”
“Yes, I know,” he said with a glance at Antoine. “But there is something about you. I don’t think I would have remembered anyone else. It has always been you. I was obsessed with you at school.”
“You are a very powerful wizard, Mr. Malfoy, one of the most powerful your line has ever seen, and it seems your blood-magic is trying to...well, make you reconsider. The ironic part is that before you died, you weren’t that powerful. Still a powerful wizard yes, but—" She shook her head.
“He sent another owl. Hell made her displeasure known,” Draco replied with a smile. “He’s getting impatient with my silence.”
Harry blinked. He had never masturbated with anyone else in the room. Even at Hogwarts he had always found somewhere else to do it, not that he had had time to explore his sexuality much when he had been fighting for his life. His heart was beating fast and his cock surely was interested in it. The idea to be naked in this chair, pleasuring himself while Draco was just sitting there and ignoring it, or trying to ignore it was really a turn on for Harry.
“Draco,” Harry said and put a hand on his knee. First sign of affection with someone else present. Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was even aware of it. Auror Bain had definitely noticed.
“It was curiosity, I guess,” Draco eventually answered the question. “You didn’t wear me down, Potter. Maybe I want to know who you are now too.”
It had been such a simple spell for Draco, his mother had taught him that one pretty early on. But for Harry it was of course something he had never seen before.
She nodded; her face grim. “Yes, something is going on with the boy and his magic. It seems it’s been siphoned away. The mark can’t be removed by any means the healers at St. Mungo’s tried so far. His condition is getting worse.” She rubbed at her temples. “Yes, I know something doesn’t add up and that the Goyle’s condition had been kept a secret from us, by the people who are working on this case is not a good sign, Harry.”  She looked at him then. “I don’t want the kid to die. He already lost his father. We let his father die.”
Bloody hell, Draco thought. That mix of innocent and bold really did it for Draco. “I want to suck your cock, Harry.” He had been thinking about it for days in fact and it seemed that Harry was ready to take the next step now too.
“What about the kid then? He wouldn’t mark up a kid like that,” Harry replied. “Besides he was here with me,” he added, because really there was no better alibi than Harry Potter, hero of the wizarding world and they both knew it.
“No, and before you ask, no I don’t know what I was doing in that inn. As I don’t remember anything.”
“Now, if you are up for it,” Draco whispered against Harry’s ear. He could feel that Harry was up for it. Harry’s breathing was becoming faster, and his cock was getting hard. His fingers were bunching up Draco’s robes.
“I should hex you Potter,” Draco said, and he sounded weary. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. “But I guess then I would be the one blamed for attacking the hero of the Wizarding world.”
Draco made a noise that didn’t mean anything, but hopefully conveyed strongly how much he cared for reality. Reality was shit right now. Only ten years after the war he was still a pariah. Granted he didn’t do much to change people’s mind about him, but he honestly didn’t think he should grovel at the feet of people who had never been in the presence of the Dark Lord himself and who had left the saving of the world to a seventeen year old kid.
“I’m sure Henri will find something, but Aurors Bears and Potter can also go up and look at it. Maybe they’ll see something useful,” Draco said and told his wards to let Bears and Potter into his studio.
They were finally in front of the guest room. It was the one the farthest away from Draco's own bedroom. It was better for his sanity that way. Because there was something about Potter, there had always been something about Potter.
“I think I might be a clue,” Harry said, looking at the painting. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the bodies in the middle; they looked like a flower. “Is that an orgy?”
He sunk to his knees and took a breath. He had done this before, not that many times. He had some experience, but his sexual exploration and education had pretty much stopped his sixth year.
Spells like the one Draco had described to him, the one he had seen in the painting, didn’t work so well with pureblood Muggles, but they could work on Muggles born with magic blood. Maybe the killer thought he could do it with diluted blood, so to speak, and once those attempts failed he moved to witches and wizards.
Luna made a noise and Draco looked at her. “Since you started working with the Ministry of Magic, you've never once painted Harry. I mean, you've never painted or sketched or doodled Harry, Draco. You even doodled Mr. Starlord, and you hate Mr. Starlord, but never Harry.”
It was a war-council. Harry had no illusions about that. He suspected that both Blaise and Pansy had the urge to destroy Draco’s old publisher, but that they were holding back, like Harry was holding back.
“As we all should have done,” Draco said. Over the last ten years he had come to terms with his father’s failures and his greed. He had realized that he wasn’t his father, had never been a mini copy of Lucius Malfoy. Draco had too many other passions, had been too smart for his own good. Had always had too much from his mother inside him.
Draco smiled. “I know you would, you would win too and hurt him in the process, and I don’t want that. Don’t get me wrong, if he tries anything, anything at all again, I will hex him from here to Sunday, but I don’t want you to do it.”
“Yes,” Harry said. Because he had been trying to invite Draco to dinner for the past week. In fact he had invited Draco and Draco had refused every single one of his invitations.
Once Potter was gone with his coffee and his plate piled high with breakfast foods, Draco sat down at the kitchen table and drank his tea slowly in small sips. His mind was running a mile a minute. The most pressing question was why now? Was it the impending ten-year anniversary of the Hogwarts battle? Were the Auros even looking into the ‘why now’? Or were they focusing on the who?
“And then he comes back at the age of twenty-two and starts to work with the Ministry half a year after.”
“Not really, but I know what I’ve painted, and some of it was in the papers,” Draco replied shrugging.
“People don’t usually smile about nothing, Draco,” Potter said and pushed the plate with pastries in Draco’s direction. At times Draco felt like Harry wanted to fatten him up.
After discussing details and payment for another thirty minutes Harry found himself outside again with Draco.
“Probably because of Potter,“ Draco said. In the years since the trials he had come to terms with the fact that it had been Potter who had saved him from a lengthy stay in Azkaban. He didn’t dwell on it too much these days. He was trying to leave his past behind. He was giving it all away in tiny bits in his writing. He didn’t want it back either.
Draco gave him a look. He knew that Harry was only trying to put him at ease, but he was too nervous to play along. It wasn’t only the fact that he was Belladonna, he was pretty sure Harry could handle that little white lie, it was also the fucking blackmail.
“I hardly think me being an erotica writer and me working for the Dark Lord are the same things, Blaise.”
“I’m not worried, as long as Auror Potter is guarding me,” Draco told her. And he wasn’t. Harry had an excellent track record when it came to saving Draco’s life after all.
Draco nodded, the joke was of course that both Snape and Voldemort weren’t purebloods at all. There was no superiority in blood, there was only tradition and invention and will.
“Don’t,” Draco warned and Harry jerked back; he had been about to do just that. It was messed up how much he wanted it. He had always been better at controlling these kinds of desires.
They settled for a fast food restaurant, because it was one of the still open warm public places where Harry got them coffees and something to eat for himself.
Harry nodded. He didn’t want anyone local if he could help it. The rumours would fly. He was Harry Potter, and no one had set foot in Malfoy Manor for years, and there was also that well-kept secret of Draco Malfoy being a Seer.
The Ministry made an announcement two days later. They admitted that one of their own had been involved in the murders, they also told the public that a few people had done things against their will and that the spell that had been used for it was now under investigation. Lerch was going to trial for conspiracy and murder, they still hadn’t found Julien. The Ministry told the public that he was missing and presumed dead. They laid the blame for the murders entirely on Lerch’s feet.
Thinking back to his battles with Voldemort, Harry was very aware that he had had a lot of luck, and that was why he was drinking Felix Felicis and handing one to Antoine too.
Draco sighed, sitting down at the kitchen table. “I’m aware I’m not-“ he stopped, looked at Harry. “Thank you for getting me out of there.”
Inviting Draco to dinner was not an easy task. He had been well aware that Harry being Harry wouldn’t work on Draco – at all. He had known that he would have to work for it and maybe it was the fact that he had to work for it that made him keep it up. That added to the excitement of it all.
Blaise looked at him. “Would you go back to the place where people have been murdered? I don’t see you living in Godric’s Hollow.”
“Why are three of you here? Surely we don’t need four people to look at a painting,” Draco said, looking from Thompson to the unnamed Auror, and then to Potter. Potter’s eyes were a beautiful shade of green, like growing things. The colour made his fingers itch for a canvas and his paints. He reached for his mug so his fingers had something else to do.
Pansy shrugged. “Maybe to people who know you, maybe to people who know Potter. But I wouldn’t worry about that part, because everyone and their grandmother think they know Potter. All the biographies that came out after the war and the millions of newspaper articles. The boy who wouldn’t die,” she said the last words with a touch of doom in her voice and then smiled at Draco.
“I think that’s wonderful,” Luna said, who was stroking Mr. Starlord, who in return was looking with disdain at Draco.
“Don’t you have somewhere to be?” Draco asked him over his shoulder and Antoine was at Draco’s back in a matter of seconds. Harry had been right: he looked hungry.
Harry smiled and handed the papers over. While Draco was reading, Harry was drinking his tea, eating a piece of cake and watching Draco.
“I know what you’re doing,” Draco said. He opened his pants and reached inside to pull out his cock. It was smooth and pale except for the faint pink blush at the tip.
“What, fuck a man?” Harry asked, breathlessly, because Draco’s gaze was boring into him and Draco’s hands were playing with his nipples tenderly and he could feel Draco’s warm skin against his own and it wasn’t enough. He was going to go insane at this rate.
Harry rolled his eyes at him. “We don’t know the spell, Draco. It seems to be some kind of new Dark Magic.”
“So, what are you going to do now?” Harry asked once they had showered and made it to bed.Draco was running his fingers in random patterns over Harry’s skin. Harry had his fair share of scars as well, and Draco delighted in being able to map them all out.
“I’ll be fine,” Draco said. He couldn’t promise that, but he had no intention to let anyone corner him like that every again. He had enough of that to last him a lifetime.
“Fuck,” Harry hissed. It wasn’t exactly painful or uncomfortable in fact it seemed his cock liked it very much.
“Come down then and have dinner. Blaise will be here in a few weeks to keep you company and get you out of your head so you don't lose your mind.”
Well, if Draco wanted compliments, Harry was sure he could come up with something. Draco looked at him and Harry looked back. “If I get this right, will you go out with me, Draco Malfoy?”
“You and me, Blaise, we didn’t fucking start that war either,“ Draco said. He was slowly coming to the realization that his father had been blind to anything except power. That he had sacrificed the manor, his marriage and his son to get that power. Anger was like a living thing inside him. It was a blood red snake in his veins.
“I am not a specialist on these things, but I do have my strengths, and I am pretty sure the problem is that the ritual is not finished and that Mr. Malfoy’s body is in a state of flux.”
“So what will you do now?” Antoine asked the next day. Draco was still asleep and dead to the world. In the truest sense too, Harry realized suddenly.
Harry nodded; he knew that. He told Ivan about the assault and murder; it was still murder in Harry’s book, even if Draco was alive. He told Ivan about the new painting too.
“I’ve been in communications nearly the whole time you were in your study with the Ministry and my superior,” Potter said. “Someone fucked up and they’re going to find out who, but not now,  because we have bigger fish to fry.”
Draco gave him a look. “I hope you are prepared for the media circus and backlash once our – affair,” Draco settled on, “is made public.”
Draco blinked up at him. “Why are you awake?” He asked groggily and then buried his face in the pillow. Draco was not really a morning person. Harry thought that was probably partly because he worked at night. Now that he knew that Draco was a writer, a lot of his odd little habits made more sense.
The little owl perked up and cocked her head. She looked a bit haughty and a bit regal. Draco liked that about Hell.
Harry sighed. He had felt the tension whenever he had talked about Draco with the people who had claimed to be his friends. Really only Luna seemed like she was fine with it. Neville was slowly coming around, but Ron never had a good word to say about Draco.
“Well, yes, as silent partners. Blaise is rich, yes, but a bit more backing would help him too,” Draco replied.
Harry thought that Draco did an excellent job of fucking him last night. He could still feel all those little aches in all the right places.
“Did you ever think that this whole sorting thing was just bullshit? I mean, how can someone be just one thing and none of the others?” Draco asked, partly because he was curious and partly because he wanted to change the topic.
That night Harry came all over his fingers to the memory of gray eyes and Antoine's wood and copper scent and didn't wonder what it meant.
Harry hadn’t even sat down yet, his jacket was still only half draped over the chair. “Good morning to you too,“ he said, smiling at her as he sat down.
“Go for it Potter, my home is your home after all right now. And I do want you to feel comfortable here,” Draco answered.
“It was smart to mark yourself to have a reminder,” Antoine said two days later. They were at Harry's place and Harry was on personal leave, because now that he had someone to help him and a real shot at finding Draco Harry didn't want to be disturbed.
He groaned and rubbed his temples. “I’m so fucked,” he whispered. He needed to get laid to get it all out of his system, but as he was a prisoner in his own house, there was no way he could go out and pick someone up, or go to the Club and have his pick. He blinked. He could invite someone here. From the Club. A professional. Potter would probably have a fit, but Draco was willing to risk it because he was going insane.
Blaise gave him a look that clearly said he knew Draco was full of shit, and yes, that was the bloody truth too, but he was glad that at least for now Blaise was going to let it go.
“I talked to Luna, she is delighted to interview Draco,” Harry said, as they all sat down. It was so weird to have so many former Slytherins in his home. But it felt nice too.
Draco looked at him. Was Blaise fucking joking? Draco had a bedroom, a living room, kitchen and bathroom. And all of these rooms were tiny. He worked in his bedroom, for a lot of reasons. “You have enough space,“ Draco replied, because Blaise was by no means poor. Blaise’s mother had been very well off and Blaise was a spoiled rich kid and good looking too. The world was his oyster. In fact Draco had based the main character of his last novel on Blaise. Well, one of the main characters.
“I-“ he had no idea, he had always wanted to be an Auror and now he couldn’t be one anymore. He knew that most Aurors did a great job and kept people save, but now that he knew there was a darker side to the new Ministry of Magic, he could not work for them anymore. In fact the last few weeks had shown he was very capable of working against them.
“I really don’t think you should thank me, Harry,” Astra replied. “He is not your friend, he was never your friend and –“
Draco would sit down with Luna next week to get the interview done and then there would be nothing for them to do. He wanted to steal Draco away for a vacation and make the wait until the news broke more pleasant.
“Yes, at the tender age of sixteen,” Harry replied. In hindsight, he felt sorry for the boy Draco had been, the impossible position he had been forced into.
Antoine sighed. “It's done. There is nothing you or I can do about it now. The only thing we can do is rescue young Mister Malfoy and make sure that this doesn't ever happen again. And if they hadn't brought you to Draco to be healed -”
She glanced from Draco to the painting, then back to Draco. In the painting the symbols and lines that were now silvery scars on his body where crimson and dripping.
“Yes and no, I booked a room for different days, different weekends, I was hoping it would be today, but if for some reason I wasn’t ready or you didn’t want to-“
Draco nodded, because there was really nothing else to add to that. He had wanted to see if he could make it on his own. And it seemed that yes, he could. Of course, he had been without an agent back then and had no real idea how to get a book published and he had known that he would not be able to publish it under his own name either. He had lied and he had mislead and he had gotten his book out there. Of course, he hadn’t gotten paid nearly enough for it. He had learned from it though. He had gotten more money for the second and third books. Now he was, well Belladonna was, a well-known name. Even if he still wasn’t rich. Probably never would be as well off as his family had been before the war.
“It will be like fucking a virgin,” Draco said, but his voice sounded funny even to his own ears. He was a virgin in this regard, after all. Harry picked up on it.
Harry shook his head. “He doesn’t want your pity. I want you to leave him alone. I am dating him. If you like it or not, I am doing it. It is my decision. I –“ he stopped, took a breath and looked at them, “I am in love with Draco Malfoy and if you can’t accept it, well I think it would be better to keep our distance.”
It was at the tip of Harry's tongue to ask if he killed, but he remembered a passage about feeding from Voyages with Vampires. Most vampires didn't kill when they fed. But they killed sometimes too, like humans, like wizards.
“Hm,” Draco hummed, he was already getting distracted as Harry kneeled down in front of him. Draco’s eyes settled on him and Harry’s heart missed a beat. There was so much hunger in them. Draco reached out and carded his fingers through Harry’s hair. “I remember this one.”
On the way home, he wondered if Draco had only given in because Harry had been so persistent. He was very aware that if a woman had told him no the first time he wouldn’t have shown up at her house every other day to invite her again.
“Back on track boys,” Pansy said. “So, Lovegood is going to interview you and publish it in her little magazine. Good. Blaise?”
“I think you should take off your clothes for me,” Draco said and sat up, Harry followed him because he wanted more of Draco’s kisses and more of Draco’s body heat.
“Were murdered,” Draco corrected. He thought that distinction was important. Why else would Potter be here? Protecting him? Or trying to?
For a moment Harry wondered how things would have been different if he and Draco would have gotten along, if interhouse friendships had been fostered when he had been at Hogwarts.
Joel in the disguise of the departed Mrs. Bellke met Draco at Malfoy Manor. He was using a highly potent version of the Polyjuice Potion and not a glamour, which explained why Draco’s magic hadn’t picked up on it.
“Once I've unpacked, we should talk,” Potter said as he followed Draco up the stairs to the guest room.
Draco blinked at it. Did Harry just gift him an owl? Draco didn’t have one of his own yet, because they were bloody expensive, but of course Harry could afford to just give one away. He was still a rich little bastard and he was also an owl trainer these days.
Draco grabbed a fistful of Harry’s hair and pulled gently so Harry looked at him. The green of his eyes was nearly swallowed by the dark of his arousal. “I need you to hear me, Harry. It will be fine. I will be fine. We will come back here after and then we will fuck in every single room in this house.”
“Ah, so true,” Blaise agreed. “Better you keep your tiny flat with the very comfortable sofa, so I have a refuge when I need it.”
Draco smiled, he knew it wasn’t a nice smile. “I want to hunt them down myself, but I can’t do that while being confined to my own home.”
“I heard he went to France for a while with his mother,” Harry said, but now wondered if that had been true or not. He hadn’t cared at all back then. He'd had his own life to live for the first time.
Harry nodded. He had noticed that. “We should maybe look into the Muggle victims again. Maybe they had some witch or wizard blood in them.”
“Yes, they did,” Harry agreed. He stepped forward and looked at the canvas again. “I’ve seen some of your other art. I mean, I saw it before I knew it was yours.”
Henri met him at the end of the stairs, along with three Aurors. One of them was Potter, of course. Draco risked taking a look at him; he looked good. Older, and a bit taller. Draco was satisfied to note he was still not taller than him. Potter's hair was mostly the same, but his glasses were stylish now, and he didn't try to hide his scar anymore.
Harry didn't like it, but he knew that Antoine was right. They had been lucky with ruling out the other facilities, but Harry couldn’t even remember how big that place was, how many guards, how much staff. They knew nothing.
Draco nodded. Usually, they didn’t bother. The only one who ever came to look at the paintings was Henri, but this one had Potter involved, so Draco was pretty sure that someone from the Ministry would pay them a visit soon.
It was that night again, and Joel was saying something funny, and he was touching Draco, and they had been kissing the whole evening between touching and teasing. It was leading up to—well, sex. Draco had fooled around with both genders during his stay in France, but confirmed his suspicion pretty fast that he wasn’t turned on by women, so he stuck to men.
“The easiest solution would be to tell Potter everything and then let the hero handle it,” Pansy said.
“No, we don’t do that anymore,” Draco said. It was sometimes too easy to forget that Harry had killed Voldemort. Granted, it was kind of an accident, but Draco was sure that it still weighted on Harry.
Draco stared at the point where their bodies were joined, and Harry stared at Draco’s face. Then Draco looked up. “Move,” he demanded, and Harry did, because Draco using that tone in bed made Harry forget any reason.
Harry liked how it became gradually easier for Draco to call him by his first name. “For your life?”
“We are,” Draco replied. “Just out of curiosity how would you have dealt with it if I would have said yes?”
“If you do anything to hurt him, I will kill you, Malfoy,” Weasley said and then stepped back. His anger was coming off him like a wave. Draco straightened his back, he was not going to back down.
He had his own tiny place, away from all the demons and nightmares after all. He should return to it, he should return to his new book, should work on Ivar’s story.
“Pansy is not allowed to name anything, not even her own children,” Draco replied and made himself at home in Harry’s lap. Now that the new book was done and had a title it was out of his hands. He would have to fight with Pansy over covers soon, but for now he was done. The voices in his head were gone and he felt hungry for Harry.
He groaned. There was only one way to find out if it was the sensual writing of Belladonna that made Harry think about kissing Draco breathless or if it was – well, Draco.
“That is quite an arsenal,” Antoine said, impressed. It was true too. Harry had a lot of explosives and other useful 'toys' to break into a secure place and get out as well, but he did hope that there would be Floo access in the building. Because there sure as hell would be anti-apparation wards.
He remembered Blaise vaguely from school. He was handsome and refined, Harry thought. Had been friends with Draco Malfoy. Not from the beginning, Harry thought, but later. “How do you know that?“
“Maybe,” she allowed. “Anyway, now we have bigger fish to fry. Minister Winters has formed a small taskforce now, and everyone associated with the Club is being questioned. The owners too. And the employees. Most of them came back clean. Just people like you and me, having fun and earning money,” she continued. “Two pinged Astra’s radar.”
Two days later Draco found himself in the unfortunate position to finally write that letter to his current publisher. There was nothing for it. The current book was nearly finished and Blaise, Pansy and Draco were already brainstorming cover art and marketing.
“Let me spin this for you a bit further,” Malfoy interrupted him, which was probably a good thing because Harry had no idea what he was going to say anyway. “To a twisted mind it could look like you prevented justice to be served. You helped criminals to go free and unpunished.”
They finished their food in silence. Once outside, Draco looked at the pale sunshine and breathed. Even the air here was different. Smelled different, tasted different. He missed the clean air of his childhood in moments like this. But he wasn’t ready to go back, didn’t know how to go back.
“Yes, but I don’t remember it. Don’t feel any attachment to it, so it doesn’t matter. It might make our lives easier, but it doesn’t matter. I am Harry James Potter, who is in love with Draco – what is your middle name?”
“Your cock and my ass are about to meet for the first time and you promised to ruin me for everyone else, so yes, I do feel a bit smug about it right now.”
There were things he was willing to do for his own gain, and there were things he was willing to do for the people he cared about and loved and then there were things he was willing to do for Harry Potter and he suspected that Harry had a list of these unspeakable things he would do for him as well.
“Someone like Julien,” Draco repeated. “I’m not saying it’s him, maybe he modified it for someone else and it has been used on him and other people, like the Aurors who had been guarding the Goyles.”
After spending a weekend reading bits and pieces of these books he was pretty sure that it was him and Draco and not the sensual writing of one H.J. Belladonna. But the Belladonna books had set Harry on this little adventure of self-discovery.
Bloody Potter, Draco thought as he was walking the mostly empty halls of the manor. Most of the furniture was gone, so where the books, the paintings, the ancient, priceless artifacts.
For a second his heart raced and a rush of panic blocked out everything and he didn’t know why or where it came from. And then Antoine was there, looking at him. “It’s alright. It was a suggestion, not compulsion, Harry. You may sleep now, you may not.”
He could live there rent-free. But he didn’t think it was worth it. The demons that lived in that place would find him and eat him alive. He didn’t have the money to remodel it, to make it into something else, something like a home. He shook his head once more.
He grabbed the last Belladonna book and re-read the bits about attraction and then he went back and reread the sex-scenes. There was something about it, Harry had thought it was the writing, but maybe it was – well, maybe it was the fact that one of the characters reminded him of Draco. The way he talked maybe.
Harry nodded and handed over what they had been able to find. It was hard to reconstruct a spell from only the residue found on a person, but Hermione and Astra had tried their best.
Draco knew that Blaise had a point. It seemed Harry hated secrets, hated being lied to, too. Draco could understand, after all they had both been manipulated from a young age by the gown ups in their lives.
“Why paint this?” Potter asked after another lengthy silence in which they were breathing each other’s air. Draco’s fingers itched to run over Potter’s face, his neck, his chest and...lower.
“And I didn’t know he was your lover,” Harry said, the ‘because you didn’t tell me a thing’ was strongly implied.
Draco slid down to the floor and held his head between his hands. It fucking hurt. He had known that no one would be thrilled about this situation, but he hadn’t thought that someone would hurt him.
“It’s a poisonous nightshade, but yes, I guess you can call it a flower,” she teased. “You realize that H.J. could be your initials, Harry?“ Luna asked with an amused glint in her eyes.
“He did save the wizarding world from ruin and dark times, but also: this is an opportunity, Draco. Pansy told me how you used to bitch that Potter threw your offer of friendship in your face-“
The little owl made a noise that Draco interpreted as: how should I know. Get a move on. I’m waiting.
“You don’t have a cat, because you’re too vain, Blaise. A cat would get hair all over your expensive clothes,“ Draco replied and then ignored Blaise in favor of going into the kitchen to get some hot sweet tea into his system. Maybe that would make his day better, even if it had just started and the potential for disaster was high.
Harry nodded, yes, he did know that. He was still of interest to the media. Every one of his last relationships had been in the fucking Prophet. Thank Merlin it hadn’t been that many.
They had roughly ten minutes before the Aurors would knock on their door (they had bricked up their fireplaces when they moved in, so no one was able to use the Floo). Draco used those ten minutes to dress in presentable clothes and scrub the splattered paint from his skin, then made his way downstairs.
Fuck, Draco thought, she was right, he wanted to have sex with Potter. And Potter showing up at his gate, begging to be let in, was only making it harder to resist.
Harry looked at him sharply. “What would you have done in his situation? He was sixteen, his home had been invaded, he couldn’t tell anyone, he lived with a madman who killed people just for the fun of it in front of him. He was in danger, his parents were in danger, the people he cared about, his friends were in danger.”
“Mrs. Zabini visited St. Mungo’s recently and brought with her a wizard friend of hers from Asia. Krabat and his mother are on the mend. Sorry, I wanted to tell you, but it just slipped my mind with everything else that is going on right now,” Auror Bain said and seemed to mean it too.
Well, Draco thought two days later as his back was against the wall and Weasley’s wand was digging into the tender skin of his throat, he should have seen that coming.
And then Draco sucked him in and he was feeling weak in the knees. Antoine was at his side in a flash and that should have been weird, but it wasn’t. He turned to look at Antoine. They were the same height, but he knew that Antoine was so much stronger. He reached out slowly with his free hand and cradled Antoine’s cheek like he had wanted to for some time now.
“It’s not unheard of, it’s not forbidden or anything either. It was frowned upon by the pureblood wizard families, but mostly because two men can’t have any children, I mean blood related children. So no blood heir,” Neville said. “I thought you were in love with Cho? And well, had feelings for Ginny,” he continued.
“Back then I didn’t think about how you felt, the pressure you were under, the things you have seen.”
“Now, Draco. Do it now,” Harry moaned, and Draco put on a condom and did. His cock was bigger than three fingers, it was hotter too, it filled Harry out and-
“It wasn’t Joel’s voice. I would have recognized his voice. Besides, why would he have let me live?”
“You can’t use my home as your personal hotel, Blaise,“ Draco said, but he was already grabbing two cups out of the cupboard. He was too tired to use magic, after writing the whole night, he felt like all the magic had been absorbed by his parchment. Some of his sanity maybe too.
“Draco?” Harry asked and then his eyes went sharp. It would have been scary that gaze if Draco wouldn’t have known that it wasn’t directed at him.
“There are spells for that,” Draco said and grabbed his wand. He cast one on his palm and one on Harry’s; they would have matching scars now. “You bound yourself to my home.”
He had first picked it up because Luna had said the main character was an Animagi, a wolf shifter and something nostalgic had pierced Harry’s heart, the longing to see Sirius again maybe, to have some kind of piece of him back. The wolf character was nothing like Sirius, but the whole story had sucked Harry in anyway.
“Because,“ she replied, “for some reason Mr. Potter took to you like a duckling to water, Mr. Malfoy.“ She rubbed the bridge of her nose. “He is safe here as long as he stays in Hogwarts, but as you should know by now: Mr. Potter had lost all memories of being a wizard or the wizarding world. It doesn’t mean he isn’t a wizard, it just means that he has to learn everything from scratch and you, Mr. Malfoy will help him do it.“
“Did one of my friends do this to you?” Harry asked. The whole Weasley clan had a temper after all. Hermione could get really angry on his behalf as well. Neither Ron nor Hermione liked Draco. He was told that he hadn’t liked Draco either, but he couldn’t remember that. And there was this unexplainable draw to this young man. Harry didn’t see any reason to fight that pull.
“So, he has no money, no friends and only a cursed house to stay in.” Why come back at all then, Harry wondered.
“Because he did that and let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, Harry. He destroyed the last safe place for us.” Neville’s hands were clenched to tight fists.
“He says it’s not a vision, but a memory; the past, his past, and it’s...it’s messed up because it’s beautiful but also horrific.”
“I would never have made it to sixteen or older if not for Hermione and Ron,” Potter said, with a fond smile.
Her eyes landed on the bruise Harry left on his collarbone and then took in the scar Harry had left what seemed like a lifetime ago on his torso. Draco nodded at her and then proceeded to make his way to the teakettle.
“And what will they be able to do? I am Harry Potter. The Boy who lived. The one who defeated Voldmort.”
Ivan got up and paced the small room. It was cramped and neither of them was very tidy; they had a system that worked for them, but really no one else. He came to a stop at the small window, leaned his arse against the ledge and crossed his arms over his chest. “I have a feeling this is getting personal for you.”
“Before Goyle, I would have entertained it,” Harry said, and before living and sleeping with Malfoy. “But Goyle was his friend.”
“As if you wouldn’t have if one of your precious little brats had been marked like that. But of course your little Weasleys are safe.” He spit.
She smiled at him. “Well, I love you too. Now come down; I don’t want to be in the same room as this thing.”
“Or would that not be okay? I honestly don’t know how these things are handled in the Wizarding world,“ he confessed.
“The scar,” Antoine answered, with a slight nod to Harry's chest. “Is it not a nearly exact replica of the one you gave young Mister Malfoy when you were both schoolboy's?”
“Oh, before I forget,” she said and grabbed something from her bag. “Ron sends his love via his mom’s baking.”
A few moments later, Pansy was standing in the middle of the studio. “Well, fuck,” she said as she looked her fill.
Once an idea took roots, it was really hard to rip it out or ignore it. That was why Harry found himself looking at year old newspapers and cashing in favors.
“I’m on edge,” Draco continued, because he needed to breach the subject of inviting some company for himself with Potter. It was going to be a battle.
Harry took a sip of wine. He didn’t have a real answer to that. When he had been asked before by his friends and the media, he had told them it had been the right thing to do, because they had been kids. But was that really the reason why he had helped Malfoy? Malfoy who had been closer to Voldemort than any of them – except Harry in a twisted way?
“I assumed, Potter,” Draco replied. “Do you want to take this to the bedroom, where we can be naked and comfortable, or do you want to fuck me in your hallway against the wall? I don’t have a preference right now.”
“Oh,” Harry said and his lips looked kind of perfect and tempting, but Draco had to make things clear for Harry first.
“Really? Maybe because I feel smug,” Draco said. He rolled on his back and looked up at the ceiling.
“Well, some of the Aurors think of course, what does it matter? They’re finally getting what they deserve. Right?”
“Oh, I don’t intend to let him have any part of me ever again,” Draco said with a smile he knew was deadly.
“Lunch is ready. You should eat,” he said and then left. Over the last few days Draco had learned that Potter didn’t like eating alone and that was a titbit he hadn’t known before and it was endearing and a bit sad too.
Potter of course ignored it. “How did you know? We kept most of the gruesome details to ourselves, because we don’t want to risk a panic.”
“Yes, you do,” Draco replied. Draco had been desperate, and the book had been done. It had written itself really in those desperate hours he felt like he would never get his life back on track again.
It was a rather pleasant feeling. “So, what now? Because I think someone at the Ministry or Aurors’ office fucked up. I mean, they came at us with no warning.”
“Maybe I was ready to take your head off because I haven’t had sex in a too long time,” Draco snapped. He took a big sip of his whisky and then put the glass on the nearby table.
“It’s probably an empty shell now,” Draco said. A grand empty shell, but a shell anyway. A skeleton, a monument to all the death and destruction that occurred there. That his family let happen in the name of what, honestly? It wasn’t honor; it hadn’t been anything noble at all.
He had confessed to Draco being the first man he ever kissed, but really, Draco had known that. If there had been any rumors at all about Harry Potter getting it on with a man, Blaise would have heard about it and so Draco would have heard about it too. Draco would be Harry’s first. His first kiss with a man, the first man to blow him, the first man to fuck him, the first man Harry would fuck, because Draco wanted to feel Harry deep inside him as much as he wanted to be inside Harry.
Draco could tell that he meant it. “Water under the troll bridge, Potter.” He was about to say something else but then his stomach made a noise and Potter laughed. “I haven’t eaten all day.”
“Well, there are months upon months where no one knew where you were. I mean, you were with Granger and Weasley. Granger is quite good looking. I wouldn’t touch Weasley with a ten-foot pole.”
“Who should I have told? I was alive and everyone else was in pieces on the forest floor. I’m a former Death Eater, and it was shortly after the war.”
Draco suppressed the urge to blink at him. This line of conversation was very dangerous to his heart. “I know why you’re here, Potter and I’m going to tell you now that I—"
“Because I’m stubborn and reckless and I want to get to know you. And I think you refused just out of spite or on principle.”
And why, Harry thought, and why then do I want to kiss you so badly when I’m in love with Draco? He swallowed and looked away.
“I can walk and I want to walk out of here, Potter before they know that I am trying to escape!” Draco hissed.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make it sound like you let it happen. I’m just trying to get a picture of what went on. Please continue.”
Draco knew he should say no, but he nodded instead. These days he didn’t have much company except for Luna and Pansy, and despite everything, he had enjoyed talking to Potter.
Blaise nodded. “Yes, it was. But he always bent the rules and did reckless things. This time he did it for himself. There is, I always thought so, a bit of Slytherin inside him.”
“Because when we started our lessons all those weeks ago, you had to conceal a bruise on you jaw, Draco,” Harry said.
Harry reached up and grabbed his hips, pulled him even closer, deeper inside himself. His cock got some friction like this as well and then Draco reached between them and started to jerk him. It didn’t take long for Harry to come messily all over Draco’s fingers. His body clenched hard and Draco cursed as he came. Harry could feel his cock spasm. Draco smeared kisses into Harry’s collarbone and then pulled out gently and carefully. It felt weird, but the afterglow was overriding everything else.
“We didn’t have time for romance. Besides Hermione and Ron were pretty much in love and Ron was figuring it out. Hermione of course knew all along,” Harry said. “I only ever kissed two girls and not one single boy before you, apparently…I mean, your kiss was so-“ he stopped and shrugged.
“I just wrote it. You read it. So obviously I can write it,” Draco replied, irritably. He had been up pretty much the whole night to get the next chapter done, and yes, it was mostly pornography, but it was what it was. Some of it might have been inspired by bloody Potter too.
Blaise nodded and then his face became serious. “There is something I need to talk to you about, and it concerns Harry. I wasn’t sure I should tell you, but you are in love with him. He is in love with you and it might help you-“
“I was about to pack it up when Luna said you wanted to have another look,” he said from the top of the stairs. He looked good; Harry had noticed it three days ago, too. He had grown into his pointy features, and his hair was so light it was nearly blinding, his skin so pale it looked luminescent. On someone else it may have made him look ill, but not Draco. There were still parts of the Draco Malfoy Harry remembered, but he was also very different now. His confidence was real, and his mouth seemed less cruel, Harry thought. Or maybe it was just his own perspective. He’d seen real evil as an Auror, and Draco Malfoy wasn’t it.
Draco sighed. “She’s seen the painting. She’s seen all the bloody paintings, Thompson.” Draco didn’t like Thompson, and that was mutual, too. He knew Thompson had been the one who had assigned Henri to him, because he no doubt thought Draco was gaga and Henri was useless. Now he was probably resentful that they had turned out to be such a good team.
“I’m flattered, really, but your timing sucks,” Draco replied. “And if it weren’t for this, I would let you fuck me on that daybed over there.”
Harry didn’t know why he felt utterly relieved by Draco’s answer, but he did. “Come here,” Harry said, already reaching for Draco.
Of course the difference was now that he was a grown man and somewhat even more of a celebrity. He was wiser too and wearier of people. While his friends had gone off to do great things, he had bought a house as far away as he could from any hustle and bustle of the Wizarding world and started to train owls. It was far from glamorous really but he liked the space that he could call his own.
Harry nodded. “Yes,” he answered. “It’s funny when you call him young Mister Malfory, you look so much younger than him, or me for that matter, Antoine.”
“Starting something?” Harry asked, his breathing was a bit too hard and his heart was beating a bit too fast, but that was the effect Draco had on him.
“Draco,” Harry said and this time it was a warning. He was close, Draco could feel it. He didn’t let up, he doubled his efforts, scrapped his teeth gently along the base and Harry cursed and lost it. Draco swallowed everything Harry had to give and then leaned his head against Harry’s thigh, to catch his breath.
Harry had a million questions the next morning, he was already up making breakfast and coffee and had showered when Antoine and Draco entered the kitchen.
“Yes, you did, and I am happy for you, I really am. I just want you to be prepared that some people might consider you a traitor.”
“But the specialist said that,” Potter said, looking at Bears. “Your trusted curse specialist said that.” Bears shrugged. Clearly he didn’t have an answer either.
“The Ministry finally gave the manor back to me,” Draco said as they walked side by side. Blaise was window shopping and Draco was just putting one foot in front of the other and soaking up the little sunshine there was.
For a second it looked like Potter was about to grab his wrist and do – something but then he looked from the Mark to Draco's face. His green eyes were earnest, sincere, fierce even. “I won't let you die,” he said.
“I think it’s perfect,” Harry answered. He had of course been the first to read the rough draft, but it hadn’t had a title two weeks ago. Titles really were the hardest part of writing, Draco thought. It was like naming a child. A fully grown child.
Draco snorted and then smiled at Harry. “I love that I’m your first. Not going to lie. It turns me on.”
Harry kind of hated it, but in this case he would take the privileges that came with being – well, him. “Thank you, Astra.”
“I heard all kinds of things about Slytherin when I was first introduced to the wizarding world. I don’t think you can imagine what that was like for me. It was the first time that I felt like I belonged, the first time people wanted to have me around. Everything around me was magical, even the most mundane to you, I’m sure, things were fascinating. So yes, I was overjoyed and overwhelmed. I realize now that everyone around me had an agenda of some kind. Everyone was biased.“ He run a hand through  his hair. “I loved Dumbledore to pieces for the glimpses into the past, my past, my parents’ past, he offered me. I didn’t question a thing at first. Anyway,” he looked at Draco then and his eyes, what was it about those damned eyes, really? “What I was going to tell you was that the Sorting Hat had me picked for Slytherin and I argued with it. I told it no. I told it anywhere was fine, anywhere but Slytherin.”
“Scared yet?” Draco asked, but his tone was soft and mild and just a little bit teasing. Like he was enjoying it, like he was sure that Harry was enjoying it too and going by how hard Harry’s cock was – and Draco could feel it – he was enjoying it very much.
“So, and now we’re done,” he said the evening they dealt with the last person who had worked at facility.
Harry was on vacation and sending cheerful letters to his friends about all the amazing things he was doing and seeing, and the people he was meeting. Hermione probably thought he was being sarcastic. As long as she didn’t suspect anything, Harry was fine with that.
Harry soldiered on, it wasn’t easy, because looking at Draco’s lips, made him crave Draco’s lips on him.
“Giving orders now, Harry?” Draco asked, his hand wasn’t moving. He was looking Harry in the eyes and panting and licking his lips. That little tease.
“Maybe because our rivalry had been so intense, maybe because I was – apparently- obsessed with you for years. Maybe because you changed me, Draco. I don’t know, because I can’t remember, but something drew me to you. An invisible cord.” He kissed Draco gently. “Why did you agree to help me?”
Draco would bet anything he had that it hadn’t been just curiosity, but Blaise’s motives didn’t matter anymore. Blaise was Draco’s friend and Draco was in love with Harry, so Blaise was also Harry’s friend. Draco nodded and Blaise swirled the wand between his fingers. “I ran some tests on it and Draco, he did it to himself. The spell that took away his memories came from this wand.”
Draco leaned back in the armchair he was occupying and looked at Potter. “I know that no one really wanted me to succeed, Potter. After all the horrible things I’ve done.”
It made Harry’s heart beat faster and his blood boil in a good way. Looking back, he had always been attracted to boys as well as girls, but he never really had the time to confront these feelings or ask about it, what with all the conspiracies and life threatening events.
Draco shrugged. “I will feed and then I will feed some more, have sex with you two, and then maybe get in touch with my mother, so she knows I’m alive.”
“Because secrets between you two never ended well,” Blaise replied, with a flicker of his eyes to Draco’s chest.
Harry had no real excuse for why he was here in the first place. Probably just curiosity. Malfoy manor stood there like a tomb. He could feel the magic coming from it. Humming just out of reach. The building seemed perfectly intact and structurally sound, but it also seemed like it wanted Harry gone. He didn’t think the building really had any feelings about him being here, but looking at it – well, it looked hostile.
“I did in fact do you, Harry. Once, when I slit your chest open and left you with this,” he stroked a finger over the scar on Harry’s chest.
“I don’t need your pity,“ Draco said. He really didn’t. He was finally making decent money. Well, it was better than the little bit he had gotten for his first book, but he knew it was less than other authors were making. He had been broke and reliant on the charity of others for far too long. He had his own place. Granted it was smaller than his childhood room had been, but it was his and there were no nightmarish memories lingering in the corners of his tiny flat, waiting to ambush him at any second.
Luna was waiting for him at the stairs with a mug of hot tea and a black cat. He took the mug gratefully but couldn’t make himself drink the tea.
Ron looked utterly crushed by that repeated admission, but there was nothing Harry could do about it.
Draco smiled, and this time it wasn’t a nice smile at all. “Of course. We might be pariahs now, but we won’t be poor pariahs.”
“I usually go to a club or a bar to pick up some company,” Draco said. He could already tell that this conversation wasn’t going well.
Draco answered with a smile. It was that smile, that made Harry snap. It had been so long and he had fed on half remembered dreams and elaborated fantasies and now Draco was here and he was smiling and a bit mean and a lot beautiful and yes, hot as hell and Harry wanted to touch him, needed to touch him so he did.
“But you’re wearing a glamour, right around here,” he said and put his hand on Draco’s chest. He ran it over the scar that he couldn’t see, or remember, but he had placed there.
“This works both ways, you know?” Draco said and Harry reached out to run his finger along the graceful curve of Draco’s cock. Draco inhaled sharply. “I almost forgot how it felt to be with someone else.”
“I wore him out,” Draco replied. He could feel her displeasure about the situation, but she didn’t say anything. Draco hated that she was here, that anyone was here with them, really. He put tea leaves in the kettle and turned around to look at her while the water boiled. “He is never going to be yours,” he stated.
“I will be, Astra, I promise,” he said and walked her out of the small library. Draco was in the hall, leaning against the banister. Harry wanted to eat him up, kiss that slight smirk of his face and get naked.
That was the title of the new book. It was inspired by the story Harry had told him about Snape and Lily one night, but it was also kind of his and Harry’s story.
“I’m not doing that,” Harry said, because he wasn’t doing that. He didn’t think Draco was up to no good. Nothing about their interactions had indicated anything of that matter. What he got from Draco those two times was that he wanted to be left alone.
“I guess we should have had that talk a bit earlier, but really, I had no idea how to even start,” Harry said, between kisses.
Harry blinked at him. He took off his glasses, rubbed the bridge of his nose and then looked at him again. “Please explain in more detail.”
“He’s not up to no good,” Ron said and made a face. “Never thought those words would come over my lips.”
“It’s not mine anymore. Someone snatched it away,” Draco said, because he wasn’t in the habit of lying to himself. His heart belonged to Harry now. For better or for worse.
Harry frowned, but let it slide. Draco wasn’t ready to tell him, wasn’t ready to confide in him and that was fine. They weren’t that close yet.
“I am very relieved to hear that,” Draco said. He couldn’t quite suppress the sarcasm or maybe it was more accurate to say he didn’t want to suppress it.
Astra laughed. “Yes. You do. Anyway, you know how to reach us if shit should go down here. Malcier and Lerch are on the Goyles now. Zabini isn’t even in the country right now, but we try to contact him.”
“Whatever for?” Draco asked. He waved his hand so the painting was covered up by another tarp. He didn’t want it damaged. Maybe because it was the only evidence, aside from the visions, magic, and scars, that proved that night happened. Maybe it would... what? Help? Who was he kidding?
“Because he’s part of my life, because he gave me permission to tell you and because he’s going to reveal his true identity at the book signing next week.”
“Know what?” Draco asked. Why was he still here talking to Potter? Why couldn’t he ever just leave Potter alone?
“I love you,” Draco said because sometimes he just had to tell Harry and because Harry always went all soft and glowing when Draco said those words.
“Morning.” His voice sounded sleepy and gravely and warm and Draco wanted to bend him over the very sturdy looking kitchen table and fuck him senseless, but that wasn’t going to happen right now, so he did the next best thing which was to grab Harry by the hair and crash his mouth against Harry’s. Harry taste minty and warm and heat pooled in Draco’s stomach.
The thing was that yes, Harry was pretty sure that Malfoy trusted him. With his life no less. “I guess, I have a good track record when it comes to saving his life.”
“We should eat before the warming charm wears off,” he said. He would talk with Potter about company after dinner.
“And?” Draco asked. He liked teasing these little things out of Harry. Liked knowing things about Harry probably not many people knew.
“So you became a Gryffindor,” Draco said. He hadn’t even imagined you could argue with the Sorting Hat. He wouldn’t have anyway, because like Potter he too had been biased.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Henri said. He never used Draco’s first name, which was fine with him. When Draco had gone to the Ministry, nearly ten years ago now, and told them about his visions, they had thought it was a joke. They had assigned Henri to him as a kind of punishment. Draco never asked what Henri had done to anger the higher ups, but thanks to Draco's visions and Henri's uncanny talent in deciphering the clues in the paintings, cases were solved left, right, and center. Draco refused to work with anyone else. Many others had tried, mostly to boost their performance ratings, but Draco liked Henri. He thought they were kindred spirits.
“I’ll go and make tea,” Luna said in that dreamy voice of hers. She kissed Pansy’s cheek and went down the stairs to the kitchen.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said. “I thought it had been for the best, when I did this to you, I thought it would’ve made things easier.”
He chose a cozy restaurant outside of London in a small Wizarding community. He was the first one to arrive and the five minutes until Draco appeared at the entrance had been torture.
Harry was silent for a long time, thinking over everything Draco said. His hands were stroking Draco’s lower back and ass; he could feel himself getting hard again.
“And you will help me to -” he thought for a second, trying to recall the exact words, “ lay their kingdom to waste?”
Draco could only agree, but once this was over, he would find that scumbag who took a photo of the sleeping Krabat and sold it to the fucking Prophet and then he might advise the widow to sue the Prophet as well.
“The place is huge and he lives here alone, with a few servants. Before you ask, yes, I talked to them all. And if you can believe it or not, they adore him. Not a bad word to say about Malfoy. The whole lot of them.”
“Blaise is right. We need to go on the offense on this one. You dating Potter will help. You might be a former Death Eater and war criminal-”
“Not with me,” Draco replied. He was running slow, small circles around Harry’s hole for what seemed like hours before he pushed in the first finger. It was a tease really. It seemed to Harry like Draco took forever to add a second one and when he finally added a third Harry was a sweaty mess, ready to beg Draco to finally do it.
“Fine,” Pansy replied. “Still, come over and look at the ones I already prepared, okay? We want to get this book out there. The sooner the better.”
Harry shook his head. “No. I guess I just got carried away, because for a moment there you let me in, Draco.”
“No one in their right mind at the Ministry would want to kill you, Harry.” She said. He could tell that she believed it too.
There was a lot of green in the painting, and pale pink tones as well, and deep dark shadows at the edges that seemed to suck the light from the center. It was disturbing, more so once Draco put the palette and brushes aside and stepped back from it. He blinked, stopped humming, and stared at the painting. Harry was staring too. His own eyes were looking back at him, perfectly captured. Inside the green was a forest, with deep shadows and violent highlights. The darkness at the edges looked like fingers, and the pale center was made up of bodies or parts, intertwined and strangely erotic. There was also a heart again, stylised this time and not anatomically correct like in Vision No. 33.
Julien was screaming soundlessly, and he would be for a long time, if Draco didn’t finish this spell, but he wasn’t going to. He wasn’t a good person, he just wasn’t a good person.
“You weren’t worthy, Joel, but I was, so it brought me back and it gave me power. Whatever I imagine will happen,” he said softly. The cube he had Joel contained in was getting smaller and smaller.
“No,” Draco cut him off. “There was no other way for me; my family was with him, and I was with my family. The same way you were with yours.”
He leaned in and brushed his lips over Harry’s gently, he pulled back and then did it again and again and again, until Harry groaned. Draco smirked and licked Harry’s bottom lip gently, he was totally absorbed in the feel of Harry’s lips under his tongue and then Harry squeezed his hand and opened up to him and Draco didn’t lose any time to dive in deep, to explore Harry’s mouth with his tongue and his lips. Harry pulled him closer, his hands found their way to Draco’s waist. Draco could tell that Harry wasn’t a very experienced kisser, but he was learning fast, picking up on things Draco did and liked. Things were getting heated, so Draco slowed the kiss down and then stepped away, Harry followed him and then blinked.
“But – Draco wasn't a vampire. Back in school when I knew him.” But did he, Harry wondered now. Did he really know Draco? If he had to be honest with himself he had to say no. He hadn't known Draco at all and he hadn't really cared to know him either.
“Very philosophical of you, but you can unlearn things too,” Blaise said. “I guess I can be glad that mom never leaned too hard into all that pureblood stuff. She focused on other Slytherin attributes.”
“Ah, well...” Draco replied. He hadn’t been shirtless in ages around people. He had a glamour on him at almost all times, but something was different now. Not his magic: that was still strong as ever. He could feel it in his veins, writhing and pulsing. Something was changing, nevertheless.
Joel smiled, and that smile, even if it wasn’t Joel’s face right now, was the same. “You gave me your heart once, Draco. You can give it to me again.”
Maybe he craved all that space and the light that streamed through the big windows so much because he had spent his first eleven years in a cupboard under the stairs. Thinking back, the way he was raised – used and mistreated – still made him angry sometimes.
“What are you going to do about the manor?” Potter asked, closing the book and standing up. He was nearly as tall as Draco now, he always used to be smaller. Draco had enjoyed looking down on Potter. He had filled out too. He was broader than Draco, who was still slim and made up of sharp angles.
Draco smiled. He wasn't even angry about it. In fact, he was pleased about that admission. “Well, thank you for offering to keep me alive then Auror Potter.”
Harry looked at Draco. His pale skin, his straight nose, his lashes. His face was so soft and young after he just woke up.
“Harry, Malfoy is bad news, he had always been bad news and we don’t know what he did to you when you were vulnerable but-“
When you were an Auror for so long you got in touch with all kinds of people, some of them owed you favors, the kind you don't ask questions about. Harry was cashing in on those favors now.
Draco’s face wasn’t – if he was objective and he was not when it came to Draco – he never really had been, his face wasn’t really beautiful or handsome as a whole, Harry thought. But it was for sure interesting, he made you look twice, made your gaze linger on those pale but too thin lips, the sharp eyes, the pale hair. Draco was a bit too sharp too be called beautiful and a bit too unusual in places to be called classically handsome.
“Morning,” Potter said, running a hand through his unruly hair. He was wearing muggle clothes: a tight dark green t-shirt and jeans. His feet were bare, but that was alright, because the marble floors had a heating charm on them of course. He was holding a mug of coffee and he smiled at Draco.
“You have a file on me, don't you? Maybe not you personally, but the Aurors? You know that I have connections, means and ways. There is always someone who would do me a favor for the right price,” Draco answered unconcerned.
Harry got on the bed on his back and spread his legs in invitation. He had used his own fingers a few times, but the angle was never right and the first touch to his rim was always such a shock that he stopped right there more often than not. It felt too good.
“Well, that you would fall for him? Yes. That he might fall for you? No. He never gave me anything else than straight vibes, but that was probably because he hadn’t really had the time to explore what else he might like.”
“Are you insane? Do I look like a fucking damsel in distress to you? I don’t need Harry to save me.”
Harry nodded. He was nervous and excited. He trusted Draco not to hurt him – in more ways than one. He got up and took off his clothes until he was naked in front of Draco. Draco pulled him against his body and kissed him gently. “You can say no, anytime.”
That I might have a thing for you, Harry thought wryly, but he wasn’t going to say that. Every time he confessed to someone it ended in disaster. Granted he wasn’t a schoolboy anymore, but still.
Draco kissed him and then kissed down his body until he reached Harry’s cock, he kissed the tip and then pushed Harry’s legs further apart and put a pillow under his ass. Harry felt totally exposed, but it only heightened his arousal and when Draco kissed the rim around his hole, he nearly jumped out of his skin. “What?”
Ivar was whispering into his ears, but he tried to ignore him. There was something very enchanting about the color of it, a green like living things, it seemed to vibrate with energy. It wasn’t spelled in any kind of way, because it was Muggle, but there was something about it Draco couldn’t put his finger on.
Potter blinked behind his glasses. His eyelashes were long. Draco had never had the pleasure to study Potter like this before. At Hogwarts it had mostly been from afar and later...after the war, well, it had been from afar as well.
Blaise had offered him a contract for another three books under very good conditions. He knew it was a business for Blaise, but he was also aware that he was probably getting a better deal than most because he and Blaise were friends. They had been more at one point in their lives and Blaise still thought fondly of him.
“So,” Draco said, leaning back against the chair. He wasn’t really concerned about the witch lying to him, it wasn’t the first time someone wanted a piece of his fortune after all. “When the ritual is complete I will not be afflicted anymore?”
Harry nodded and in that moment Draco really wanted to make this good for Harry, more than good, amazing. Nothing short of amazing would do here, Draco decided.
“Draco Malfoy,” Draco said and took that offered hand. It was warm and firm and bigger than Draco’s.
Harry shivered. His fingers tightened in Draco’s hair and Draco sucked harder. “You should kiss me,” Harry breathed.
“We have a plan, everything will be fine, and I don’t care what people think about me dating Draco Malfoy, infamous erotica writer. They can think what they want, if someone should say something to my face, well… we will see how that will go.”
“I’m fond of her because she’s clearly off her rockers and because you are disgustingly in love with her,” Draco replied.
Harry laughed. “Good fucking luck with that. Besides I don’t think you can get a more secure place than this one. The wards are so attuned to him it’s scary. They are like veins, running in the walls, the floors, the gardens and the street outside.”
“Yes, I know,” Harry answered, waving it away: he was discovering new and interesting things about himself and his desires every day it seemed.
Draco laughed. “I remember you too. And I bet I remember a whole lot more than you do Potter,” he sighed and looked at Antoine. “And you.”
“It’s probably better, I want you to feel pleasure and not pain when I fuck you, Harry,” Draco replied.
Which was of course true. No one would even show up, Draco was sure, and especially not when he wanted to get Potter arrested for stalking. He didn’t need Aurors on his property anyway and Potter, the bastard, knew it.
“Because kissing you is amazing, you kissing me is amazing, it’s even better when we are touching too, your hands under my shirt and –“ he blushed.
“You should keep it, make it your own. You are not your father. Just be the first Malfoy in your line then.”
“What we’re doing is real sex, Harry,” Draco said, holding up a hand when Harry tried to say something. Draco was clearly not done yet. And he had called him Harry and not Potter, which was happening more and more often these days and told Harry that Draco was getting more comfortable with their relationship. It gave Harry hope for the future. “Because not every couple queer or not has penetrative sex. But I get what you are trying to say, or ask, okay?”
Fuck, Draco thought. Harry was an eager, horny, willing virgin and that was too hot for words. But he had to give an answer and really, there was only one correct answer here. “Yes, I will teach you everything, Harry.”
“Partly. We’ve been over this, Draco,” Harry said. Yes, he had been suspicious, but he had also been crushing on Draco, not that he had known that back then. Part of him had wanted to help him, and that part still wanted to.
Draco really didn't know what to do with that, so he stepped aside. “This will be your room for the time being. Dinner is served at six. We will figure out everything else as we go.”
“Some higher ups, also frequent that club,” Bain said. “Things at the Ministry are crashing down, so far we’re keeping it from the public, but Minister Winters is pissed off. We haven’t seen anything like this since Shacklebolt became Minister of Magic and cleaned it all up.”
He hated it when someone forced his hand like that, when someone was holding something over his head and thought it gave them power. He had had enough of that when he had been sixteen. He was done being used by lesser men.
“I know what you’re thinking, but you and Harry are a couple now. You should decide such things together, tackle problems together, be a team, Draco,” Blaise said.
Draco smiled. “Yes, of course they would have. Potter, you were always suspicious of me too, back in the day. Isn’t that why you stalked me in sixth year?”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. I think maybe get to know this current him. It’s been ten years. We have all changed.”
Harry nodded. “Besides, it's a secret facility, they can hardly go public with it and accuse me of – whatever. Besides I've been on the Ministry's naughty lit before.”
“I know. The Ministry wanted to have a look at it all, wanted to get their hands on it, but your mother has very good lawyers.”
Draco kissed his nose gently. “Take off your shirt for me,” he commanded gently, and Harry did. “Good boy,” he added in a husky whisper and that did all kinds of things to Harry’s gut and his cock.
Harry had suspected that. It was in the way Draco sometimes got lost in the pleasure he was giving Harry, how he sometimes just stared as Harry was coming apart under his fingers and mouth.
“I’ve seen it before, I think,” Harry looked up from the scar and into Draco’s eyes. There were questions there and Draco didn’t want to answer them. Hadn’t thought he would have to answer them truthfully. But seeing Harry’s eyes now he knew he couldn’t lie to Harry. Harry had been lied to more than enough in his short life.
“Before this whole Voldemort thing, I actually wanted to become an Auror,” Draco said. “I think I might have been good at it.”
It was getting dark anyway. He didn’t like being inside the manor after it got dark. The gardens, the vast grounds where a whole other deal. They felt safe somehow.
“This is it then,” Harry said three days later. Antoine's mysterious friend had checked out two of the more farfetched locations and they could strike those from their list. Last night it had been three locations, but by now it was only this one.
Draco nodded. He had been sick of feeling miserable. It had been time to reinvent himself. So he invented H.J. Belladonna, but he was well aware that should anyone discover his secret his writing career would go up in flames. People still said the Malfoy name with disdain like it was an unpleasant taste in their mouths.
“So, I didn’t know how to ask this before, but how are things in the wizarding world when it comes to guys well, liking guys?” Harry asked and didn’t look at Neville.
Harry kissed his nose again. “I’m not actually going to do any of these things, because you won’t let me and you don’t need a hero.”
Fuck, Harry thought, the possessive note in Draco’s voice heightened his arousal a hundred percent. Harry wanted to tell him that he was always Draco’s but bit his lip instead as he pinched his nipple.
“We can, but everything pales in comparison to the real thing,” he smiled again. It was a nice smile, a smile that invited you in. That made you want to be closer. Nothing like Draco's smile and exactly like Draco’s smile, Harry thought. “And I don't think I need to make the effort with you Mister Potter, do I?”
It was sixth year all over again, but worse. Harry could admit that to himself. It was also not sixth year again exactly, because he knew that Draco wasn’t planning anything evil. Harry was obsessed with Draco, because he was obsessed with Draco.
“Go out with him. It won’t be easy, and you might get a bloody nose for your troubles, but you might also get Harry Potter.”
“You are and looking radiant as ever,” Harry answered and Draco knew that it was kind of meant as a joke, but his heart did this thing again, where it just stuttered and then beat double like it was racing toward something or making up for lost time.
“And the lives of others,” Draco admitted. “Fuck,” he ran a hand through his hair. “I was a wreck my sixth year here, the day you found me in the bathroom and-“ he cut himself off. “Doesn’t matter. Lesson is over Harry.”
It was late October by the time they finally narrowed five locations down. It had been of course stupid to hope all of them would be in Great Britain. They were all over Europe.
“I love you,” Harry answered, simply. It was the truth. Antoine had known it too. Probably because he felt the same way about Draco.
Blaise unfolded himself and stretched. He looked so graceful it was ridiculous. Blaise caught him looking and winked at him. “I’m glad I don’t have to duel the boy who lived for your honor Draco. I like Harry.”
Neville took his time re-potting a small plant and then looked at Harry. “Is there a boy you like, Harry?”
Harry shook his head. “You could be in danger, Draco. I know you are more powerful than pretty much any other wizard, but most people don’t know that. This person might think you’re hiding because you’re broken.”
Potter put a hand on Draco’s side slowly, like he was trying to calm down a spooked animal. “Draco-“
“I wasn’t, Draco,” Harry said, and kissed him again. This time it was passionate and bordering on claiming. Draco liked that very much, too.
“You are gorgeous, you know that?” Draco asked, but Harry was pretty sure he didn’t expect an answer. “Especially naked and hard on your knees for me. Desperate for my cock.”
He shrugged. “On and off again for years, I guess.” Sometimes the sex he had imagined would be so violent he would never do it in real life. Despite everything he had done he didn’t actually relish hurting people, but his mind was a labyrinth full of dark desires. It was good to get some of them out into the world in a non-violent way.
Harry nearly chocked on his sip of coffee. Draco had delivered that compliment in such a serious and grievous tone he knew that Draco meant it.
“Astra says all kinds of people are owling or Flooing the Ministry now,” Potter said the next morning at the breakfast table, they took it in the kitchen, because Potter had seemed to favor the kitchen for breakfasts from the first day. “Some think they have leads, some just to tell the Ministry to do something.”
“And…the visions?” He wanted to ask about the touching, but he would get there soon enough. The visions were important too.
“I don’t want you to deal with my problems, Harry. I don’t need a hero. I am perfectly able to handle my own problems.”
“Merlin, you look so perfect,” Draco said against his skin. He was mouthing at Harry’s neck, Harry was rubbing himself on Draco’s clothes.
“Or outside in the garden, we haven’t fucked outside yet, which is a shame, really,” Draco continued.
“Just to state the obvious,” Draco said between kisses and they were really good kisses, they made Harry’s stomach flip and his cock pay attention. He wanted more of them. He wanted more of Draco’s clever, cruel mouth against his. “This is a bad idea.”
Auror Bain looked up from her papers and smiled at Harry. He nodded at her and then made a beeline for Draco and kissed the top of his head.
“Are you sure about this, Mr. Malfoy?” Henri asked. “I know this is hard for you and I know you can’t remember all of it, but you heard a voice in that forest.”
Once she was gone, Harry sat down on the very comfortable leather armchair and stared into the flames of the fireplace. He knew he had to tell Draco about Goyle, but he was also selfish. He knew that now that one of Draco’s own had been murdered, he wouldn’t be so docile anymore. If Draco liked to admit it or not, there was a bit of a hero buried deep inside him too.
“Yes, I was painfully aware of that, thank you Potter. But you must understand that a man has needs,” he swirled his whiskey and looked at the fireplace.
Harry would have loved to deny it, but yes, he had liked it. While he was reading, it was like he was there, right there with the characters, he could nearly feel the grass between his naked toes, could feel a soft kiss on his shoulder, could feel a big hand running down his spine. He blinked. Fuck. Even now these images were so vivid it was a bit scary.
“In a minute,” Draco replied and then just laid down on the floor and stared at the ceiling. “Are we safe here?”
“Relax Potter,” Draco said gently and then touched his finger to Harry’s rim. He didn’t push in, just kept it there and watched Harry breathe.
“The war isn’t over long yet,“ she continued. “There are still people out there who might hold a grudge against Mr. Potter.“
“I thought that was what you wanted too? Get Draco back, find out who else is there, destroy everything.”
“Is that a reason why you keep mostly to your own kind?” Despite himself Harry was fascinated by Antoine, and vampires. He was living his own version of ‘Voyages with vampires’ and it was nothing like the book.
“And there is another curse that will render you helpless for a few seconds, Draco, and a few seconds is often enough. You know that.”
After a short nod from Thompson, the Aurors went up. Draco itched to follow them, but didn’t. Half an hour later they came back down. Bears looked sick, and Potter wasn’t looking at Draco. Thompson got up, nodded at Draco, and then they left.
“What is your plan then?” Draco asked. “Because until now it seems like we’ve been only sitting around while people I call or called my friends were being murdered.”
“I didn’t use to be,” Potter replied, “But something about Belladonna sucks you in, it’s intoxicating.”
Harry kissed his nose, because it was right there and because he could do these silly little things now. Draco huffed like he was irritated, but Harry knew that he liked it.
Blaise just shrugged. “Because she liked to talk about you.“ He looked at Draco and Draco didn’t like that look. “I mean I knew for some time now that you aren’t interested in girls, but I think she liked you, Draco. You just didn’t notice.“
“We don’t know. Physically he is fine. He might remember everything, he might remember parts of his life up until now, he might not remember anything at all. But he is the hero of the wizarding world and he needs to be able to understand this world, so he can live in it. We owe him at least that much.“ She said.
Harry swallowed. Fuck, but he did love Draco’s dominant side. It did all kinds of things for him to see Draco in charge.
“But they are meant to make me feel better, right? And I want the same thing for you, Harry. I want us both to be better than we were.”
“Like your family home, mine is full of ghosts too, Harry. I don’t need it. Someone else can have it.”
“Not when someone is trying to kill me, no,” Draco replied sharply and hated himself for it a second later. He had ruined the mood. Whatever the mood had been. He poured himself tea and added cream and sugar.
“I was at that inn, in disguise and when they took him away, I looked around the room, just – curiosity, I guess.”
“I wanted to see you, and Luna might or might not have dropped a hint about your new painting,” Potter answered. “But really the painting thing was just an excuse. It seems I didn’t need it because you let me in.”
Draco looked at him sharply. “If it’s the scar, then I have to tell you it’s too late, everyone already knows your face. When you were eleven, well…it might have worked then.”
“Yes, but – I think trying to do the right thing and being just that is part of who I am, but does that make me a good person?”
“He made another one,” Luna yelled back. She too used a spell for that, but her own milder version of it. Pansy would probably hear it as if Luna was standing next to her in the kitchen and whispering into her ear. Why had he ever agreed to live with them?
He was pretty sure that tonight was going to be the night Draco would tell Harry to fuck him. Draco opened his eyes and smiled at Harry lazily. “You want to fuck me, Harry?”
Harry swallowed and then squared his shoulders. “I want to learn how to suck cock,” he said, and his voice was firm, but a deep blush was spreading over his already heated skin.
Draco’s praise was music to his ears and Draco wasn’t stingy with it. “Enough,” he said after a few minutes and pulled on Harry’s hair. Harry pulled off with an obscene sounding pop.
He wanted to say something or ask more questions, because for some reason he intrigued by Blaise Zabini and his sexuality, but his stomach chose that moment to make an embarrassing noise. She laughed. “You should really order some food Harry.“
“The formalities are nearly dealt with, Zabini Publishing will be up and running soon. Once it’s all finalized, I will let Pansy design a raunchy mysterious cover for your new book,” Blaise said.
“Maybe someday soon. I’m paying that witch a fortune for the curse to be broken, after all,” Draco said. “In the meantime, I think we have a killer to catch.”
“I don’t think I can watch you touch yourself and not try to feel your skin against mine, Draco,” Harry replied honestly, because even now he could feel the pull to be closer.
“I went snooping around that private club. They weren’t very happy about it, so I had to stake the place out. And after two days I see Lerch knocking on their door one night.”
Draco had known it would come to this, but he had hoped that McGonagall would see reason. He wasn’t the right person to take care of the hero of the wizarding world.
“I guess, but honestly, I wouldn’t know,” Harry answered. “Draco,” he began, but then their food was delivered to their table and he bit his lip. He waited until they were alone before he took a deep breath and asked the question that needed to be asked. “Are you only here because you think you have no other choice? Because I am who I am and you are-“
“I disliked you apparently for a reason too,” Harry said. “I can’t remember our first meeting, but I figure you acted kind of spoiled?”
“You sealed your house and the fireplace, so they don’t know where we went, and this place is pretty secure.”
He had half a mind to finish his document, but then abandoned it, it would keep. Somehow it was more important to eat lunch with Potter. Make some conversation maybe. Ask about how the case was going in general. Potter was cagey with information regarding the case and the other targets. Maybe that was a good thing, but Draco didn’t like to be kept in the dark or feeling powerless. He had enough of that when he had been younger.
Harry stepped into his personal space and took Draco’s face gently between his palms. “No, I don’t want to hide you away Draco, not that I think for a moment that you would let me get away with it. And I am prepared to make our relationship public, backlash and all.” And then he kissed Draco gently until Draco melted against the banister of the stairs.
“And it’s fine, I mean, I guess with our history it’s a miracle we are friends now and you let me hold your hand in public and I didn’t even ask if you liked boys and girls like me, I just assumed because-“
Draco wasn’t looking forward to the next part, once he had Joel helpless and at death’s door. He needed the heart. He could rip it out with a thought, but he would still have to hold it, to eat it.
He needed sleep, a shower, food, some tea. Not necessarily in that order either. He also needed to get in touch with his current publisher and tell him that he would not be publishing his new book with his company.
“And Harry’s,” Draco interrupted. “We are pretty sure they are after him too. What with him having been so helpful in keeping people out of prison.”
Plural, Harry thought. Of course there would be more than one protection spell on a place like this.
They watched the facility for another two weeks, in which Harry's thoughts were jumping between Draco inside there and Antoine right here, beside him. Not one of them Harry could touch right now.
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco said as they sat down. They went through the motions of ordering and Harry just observed Draco. Even now after ten years and the horrific things he had seen and done as a teenager, there was something regal about Draco.
“Okay, yes. But you should not be defined by your past. We as human beings evolve and change and grow, so don’t beat yourself up about it-“
“You were lucky I guess that you were found so quickly, because whoever did it, probably didn’t have your best interests at heart.”
“I think,” Pansy said, “Ivar is a version of you and Basil is a version of Potter.” She put the parchment on the coffee table and looked at him.
Draco nodded, because it was. It was his death so long ago, at the hands of people he didn’t know and who had hated him. At Joel’s hands.
The honest answer would be yes. Yes, he was scared because this reckless, impulsive thing with Malfoy could destroy what he has built over the last ten years. Harry had no intention to answer Draco honestly. After all there was a history of big and small lies between them, why should this moment be different?
“We think so. He wanted revenge,” Bain answered. “I kind of get it. The people who tortured her so badly she went mad, where living happy lives. He probably thought the system was broken.”
'I was looking for you.’ was on the tip of his tongue, because that was what he had been doing. He hadn’t admitted it to himself until this very moment, but yes, Harry came to the manor in the vague hope that Draco would be here. But it would be stupid to tell Draco that, wouldn’t it? In the past it had never paid off for either of them to show vulnerability to the other.
Astra bit her lip. “Just a thought and don’t shoot me down yet, okay? What if Malfoy did the people on his list in? What if he’s the one who is taking care of the rest of them as well?”
He kind of hated that tone, it usually meant she was pretty sure what he was doing or even knew something he hadn’t figured out for himself yet.
He grabbed the quill, he just had to summon the old Draco Malfoy and tell his publisher in clipped certain terms that their professional relationship was over, because he got a better offer.
“Come on my chest,” Draco repeated in that tone that made Harry obey him. He pulled out, he was so fucking close it only took a few hard strokes for him to come all over Draco’s chest.
“No,” Harry answered, truthfully. Because it didn't. It was wrong on so many levels what the Ministry was doing with Draco and any other vampire they had captured that it really didn’t matter if he or Antoine knew a captive. The decent thing to do was to help them.
Harry nodded, he was pretty sure there were other reasons, but Draco wasn’t ready or willing to disclose them just yet and Harry wasn’t going to insist Draco tell him. Curiosity was good, he decided. It was a start. A good start even.
Blaise closed his book. The common room was deserted, but that wasn’t unusual at this time of the night.
“I like calling you Potter,” Draco replied and kissed him again. Harry bucked up so his cock got some friction and Draco groaned.
Draco was right of course, he loved how tightly Draco’s body squeezed him. It was nearly painful and he didn’t try to move at all, while Draco rode out his orgasm. The only thing he could do was feel and stare and feel incredibly lucky that Draco was his.
“Yes, there is definitely a connection there,” Ivan said. He looked at Harry. “You want to keep this to yourself for now, don’t you?”
“Just because you are ready to sacrifice things for the greater good, it doesn’t mean you’re a good person or that those sacrifices will be yours,” Potter replied.
The nasty part of him wanted to tell Blaise to fuck off, that he had no claim just because they used to fuck for a brief time, but the more rational part of him knew Blaise meant well, knew that he didn’t have many friends left and that he needed every single one of them. That they needed him too. He wasn’t the only pariah after all, even if he was the only one with the Dark Mark on his forearm.
“Excellent,” Blaise replied. “Just let me read this once more. Why didn’t we try anything like that when we used to fuck?”
“Well, I don’t think you did it Harry. I mean you helped some of them to get free or get a reduced sentence. You spoke up for Goyle at his trial.”
It had been late and Draco had been on his way home, well to Grinmault Place, and this was an alley, a dark one and this man had a bad idea. Draco had hoped it would go down like this.
Draco could still feel the ghost of Harry’s kiss. For what it was worth Harry hadn’t been hesitant or intimidated about it. In fact Harry Potter was a good kisser. He had obviously had some practice.
“Ah, I was wondering when you would ask that question,” Antoine replied. He pushed a lock of his dark hair back and looked at a spot a bit to the left of Harry's face. “Yes and no. It changes, because the body changes, the magic changes too. That is why we are...let's say discouraged,” that sharp smile again, “from changing wizards.”
“Good thing we cleared that up,” Draco said. He flicked his fingers and the barrier he usually used with Potter came to live, but it was a box now, and inside was Joel.
Antoine looked out of the window and at the darkness outside, that wasn't really darkness in the city, Harry thought. “You have seen him.”
Draco didn’t say anything for a long time, then he seemed to have come to a decision and put the paper away. He took a sip of his tea, reached for a muffin and butter himself and they ate their breakfast in silence.
“It doesn’t feel like a vision. I was in full control when I did this...” His eyes flickered to the painting again, to this young, carefree, stupid, weak version of himself. “I thought I loved him, you know?”
He and Draco had talked about that possibility of course. They had talked about a lot of things since Draco had told him about being Belladonna. They were making plans, real plans for their future together. Draco had said that he didn’t mind writing under a penname. It would have been nice if people started to associate the Malfoy name with something positive, but Draco wasn’t holding his breath for that happening anytime soon.
Draco still looked like a wild thing and Harry wasn’t sure if he didn’t look wilder after he had fed. He was still pale, all over. Everything was just so much – more, Harry thought looking at him. Drinking him in, really.
It was that, yes, but underneath there was darkness and vulnerability and he didn’t know why it struck a chord with him, but it had. “Yes, obviously, I guess half the people who buy her books are there for the sex, but I didn’t mean that. I mean, it’s like you’re right there with the characters, you know?“
“Yes, but there weren’t any traces of defensive spells on it,” Blaise replied. “You can check for yourself. I haven’t done anything to it. Kept it sealed in fact.”
“Here will do,” Potter replied and used a spell to get them naked and summoned the lube. Draco had him bent over the leather armchair in seconds and even though he felt Potter’s urgency and it matched his own he sank to his knees to rim that pretty hole thoroughly. Potter made the most beautiful noises above him. “Draco,” he chanted, and Draco pushed a lubed finger inside him. Potter was moaning and urging him on, so Draco got up and kissed Potter’s nape before he pushed his cock inside Potter. It was like that first time all over again. It felt so right to be inside Potter, it was scary. Potter reached back with one hand and pulled him even closer.
“I want to publish my new book with Blaise’s new company as you well know. My old publisher didn’t take it well. In fact they somehow found out who Belladonna really is, yours truly and is now blackmailing me.”
It was after dinner, they were in the parlor, Draco with a glass of Firewhiskey and Potter with a coffee, because the only alcohol he drank was one glass of wine with dinner.  Understandable, as he was on duty, Draco thought.
Harry had always thought that he wasn’t a big reader when he had been at Hogwarts, but found out later that he enjoyed stories well enough and the Wizarding stories usually tended to keep his attention. He had a few favorite authors in the muggle world too, but he tended to stay away from all the stuff about magic. It was just too weird, because he caught himself shaking his head and comparing fiction to reality. That was no way to get sucked into a story or enjoy a book.
“Bloody hell,” Draco whispered, running a hand over his eyes. His fingers were green from the dust. Everything was green: from pale shades like budding flowers to nearly black like the Forbidden Forest, to luminescent-like poison; Potter’s eyes were staring back at him. He felt naked with all those eyes on him, hidden between trees or bushes or flowers. In some, the trees and bushes were inside Potter’s eyes. It was beautiful and creepy. Draco shuddered and gathered the paper, putting all the drawings in a box, which he shoved under the daybed he slept on more often than in his own bedroom downstairs.
“Are you putting him together, or something? Why is it taking so long to get Draco down from that bloody attic?!” Pansy yelled. She used a spell so that her voice was loud enough to bounce off the attic walls and invade every fucking corner of Draco’s peaceful world. Well, usually peaceful, except for the occasional bloody (in every sense of the word) vision he bore to canvas or paper.
“Later, upstairs,” Harry answered. His hand was running down Draco’s spine, lingering here and there on a magical symbol that was forever carved into his skin. It made Draco shiver. Every touch was making him shiver because he had been deprived of it for so long. Harry’s lips followed the path of his hands until he was kneeling behind Draco. The kiss to his arse cheek was unexpected, but not unwelcome.
He had, because he liked Potter and because it was flattering to be liked by Potter. To be wanted the way Potter obviously wanted him.
“That is why we, and with we I mean the younger teachers, encourage mingling and interhouse friendships,” Neville added.
“Well, yes, obviously. So have I,” Draco replied. He wasn’t concerned in the least. He and Harry were meant to be. He knew it, Harry knew it too. Their fucking houses knew it. Sooner rather than later everyone else would also know it. “But me and him were a long time in the making, Auror Bain.”
Harry messed up. He knew it the second his fingers brushed Draco’s skin, but he couldn’t make himself let go; his fingers had lingered as he took in Draco’s face: the way he bit his lips, the way his eyes darkened with pain, but also something else. And then Draco was on his knees and the contact was broken and Harry felt like a total idiot.
Harry looked at him. Draco’s eyes had always fascinated Harry. They were so expressive. “You want to fuck me?”
Joel was throwing everything at it; curse after hex after jinx, but it was all being absorbed by the barrier. Draco was standing a few feet away, watching Joel. He didn’t feel anything. Nothing at all. No love, regret, or hate.
“Off,” Draco said and sat up. There were spells and charms for it, but it seemed that Draco preferred to do this the old-fashioned way. He pulled first Harry’s shirt off and then the rest of his clothes, until Harry was naked in front of him.
“You haven’t seen or spoken to him for ten years, Harry and been cooped up here with him only two weeks, so I don’t think you know him either.”
“That was…” Harry trailed off and then licked his lips. The green of his eyes was nearly swallowed by the black of his arousal. Draco wanted to dive right back in, but he refrained.
“I’m sorry about this morning,” he said as he sat down. He wasn’t going to look at Potter with his artfully messy hair and captivating green eyes.
“I can't even remember if I did it or if Draco did it, probably Draco, I don't think we had weapons there or cutlery for that matter.”
“You didn’t mean to,” Draco said, because of that he was absolutely sure. He could still remember the shock on Harry’s face when he saw what the hex had done.
“They set in later, and as soon as I realised what they were I went to the authorities. Not that they took me seriously.”
“I don’t know why I did it. Probably because it was you,” Harry said and took another sip of his wine. It wasn’t a bad wine, he decided, not bad at all.
Draco pinched his nipples again and Harry moaned. “Potter,” Draco said, leaning down, so he could whisper the words against Harry’s ear. “You should, because I’m going to ruin you for everyone else.”
Draco smiled. “Yes, I know.” He watched Potter eat the cakes and once he was finished Draco said, “Back to your partner, Auror Bain.”
Joel had come along and swept him away, and now here they were and Draco knew it was going to be the night. He had some experience, but he had never let anyone fuck him before. He was nervous and excited, and Joel, well...was Joel. He pressed Draco against the car and kissed him breathless and hard, then told him to get in. He had a surprise for Draco, he said.
Not him that was for sure. Draco had been fully prepared to hate Potter for the rest of his life after Potter had declined his friendship. But the rest of his life was a long time. And it had turned out there were worse things than not having Harry Potter as a friend.
“Did I ever tell you that I love when you do research for your books? We always learn so much,” Harry continued once Draco stopped devouring his mouth.
The dark little owl flew inside and landed on Draco’s nightstand. Draco sat up and untied the note from the bird’s leg.
“Yes, your stomach is probably trying to eat itself,” Potter replied. He terminated the warming charm on their food, and they started eating.
Harry watched fascinated as Antoine’s thrusts got faster and harder. In that moment when he came, he didn’t look like a boy at all. Nothing sweet about him, just pure sexual energy and power.
“Well, you don’t want to give in into his demands, good on you by the way, and you don’t want to kill him, also good on you. This seems like the only good option.” Blaise took a sip of his tea and then reached for a Petit Fours.
“No. It’s really just a bit of harmless fun between consenting adults and can be finished with a safe word. But I guess you could modify it too. With enough knowledge you can modify nearly any spell, charm or hex, Harry.”
“Out of that list with thirty names on them? Ten, two are bubbling messes in nursing homes,” Astra replied. “We’re looking for the whereabouts of the other eight. But they seemed to have left the country.”
“It’s my natural default when it comes to you,” Draco answered. Probably because he had been stung deeply as a child when Potter had told him he didn’t want to be friends. Things like that could really impact a person.
“Yes, but you’re...you haven’t left the house for years, Draco, and now you’re going to the Manor. You hate the Manor. Not to mention: Potter.”
The Ministry officials had been in and out of this place for years it seemed after all, so Harry should be safe enough. Harry had imagined the grounds to be overgrown, but they weren’t. The pathways were clear, the hedges trimmed, there were even some night blooming flowers. The air smelled sweet, luring Harry deeper into the vast gardens behind the manor. He wandered the pathways until he came to a maze. He shuddered and turned around, he wasn’t going to go inside it.
“The safe word is like a bubble in your mind. Out of reach, but there and when you decide that it’s too much, your mind will reach for that bubble and you will speak the word and it all ends. As I told you this is a spell designed for play and pleasure, it is not meant to harm. Most people start with a period of ten minutes to try it out and get a feel for it.”
He nodded, but she probably knew that it wasn’t going to happen. He was going to worry and he was going to obsess about the mystery that was Draco Malfoy.
“It’s called growing up, Potter,” Draco said. He looked at Harry, a smile curving his lips. It made him look dangerous and inviting at the same time. “Or maybe you’re just noticing all these things about me now because you want me so badly.”
“It is sixth year all over again,” Ron moaned. They had just finished dinner and had settled down for drinks in the living room. Harry had started his tale about Draco as soon as Ron had poured them drinks and coffee.
Pansy looked pissed, but she didn’t leave the table. She also wasn’t making any kind of conversation with anyone, so lunch would have been a pretty silent affair if it hadn’t been for Luna and her talent to talk any awkward silence to death. After they were done and Draco had banished the remains and plates to the kitchen, he looked at Potter. Potter looked steadily at him over the wide expense of the old mahogany dining table. Luna touched Potter’s hair gently, then grabbed Pansy’s hand. They disappeared up the stairs.
“Not in detail,” Harry confessed. “I remember we were close, I remember, because you can’t really forget something like that Draco, that I love you.”
“Don’t you have work or something?” Draco asked. His eyes wandered to Potter’s hands holding the book.
“Hold on a second,” Potter said. "The curse specialist said that the ritual reacted with all the blood magic that was in the Malfoy family.”
Draco gave Harry a look. Harry just shrugged. What could he say? She was an expert on curses, and she came highly recommended. It didn’t matter that she was also one of Ivan’s more elusive relatives. Not that he had told Draco that tidbit of information.
“Ah, don't lie now,” Antoine interrupted. “I am sure you don't recall a lot of what had happened with young Mister Malfoy, but you know what you feel for him. I don't think you would have gone to such lengths if you didn't love him.”
He didn’t see the punch coming. Weasley’s fist connected with his jaw and his head banged against the wall behind him.
“Over my dead body, Harry,” Draco replied. His books might be pornography with plot and feelings, but it was tasteful pornography and he wanted that reflected on the book covers, especially as his birth-name was on them too.
“Probably, but I wonder sometimes if things enfolded as they did because Dumbledore was really good at scheming. If my parents had to die for people to believe that I was the Chosen One, for Voldemort to believe and fear it.”
He sped his strokes up and nearly came the second Draco matched his speed to Harry’s. He was breathing heavily and his eyes were dark, his eyelashes long. He almost looked like he was in pain, but not at the same time. Harry thought that no one had ever turned him on more than Draco did, and then he was coming.
“And they won’t see you like that?” Antoine asked. “What I meant was, you’re on personal leave now, aren’t you?”
Was that the reason? Maybe? Maybe he was reimagining their history and had spiced it up with a lot of sex.
Potter didn’t have a comeback to that and Draco was seriously doubting his sanity. He should be inside, looking for things left behind by the ministry. Trinkets really, relicts of his old life, that he could maybe sell.
Draco swirled his wand between his fingers. He wasn’t a helpless damsel in distress. He could take care of himself. He had more up his sleeve than he had let on, but it was good to have some secrets.
“Nearly five, the war was still very fresh for a lot of people. It still is for some,” Draco replied.
Harry nodded. “Yes, good. I want it destroyed. I don’t need it and I don’t want anyone to have evidence of what I did. Not even myself.”
Harry could feel the tension between them, and it was really amazing that he was ready to have sex again. Was it because he was so clearly wanted by Draco Malfoy?
“Exactly, and I'm thinking maybe it’s the latter,” Bears said, putting his teacup down. It looked even more delicate in his big hand. “We now suspect that these murders are connected to that ritual that killed you ten years ago, and we are pretty sure the killer is trying to recreate this ritual. Aside from me, Auror Potter, and Auror Devereux, no one is privy to this information. Except, of course, the killer. Or killers, because we have to assume that all the other people ten years ago intended to kill you.”
“I don’t think a publisher would give me the time of day, Potter. Me being a war-criminal and all,” Draco replied, coldly.
He liked spending time with Neville, because the boy was less intense than any of the Weasleys or Hermione.
“You could teach,” Draco said from the door to the bedroom. He was naked and Harry just drank him in.
Thompson let the interruption go. He knew that the Ministry needed Draco more than Draco needed the fucking Ministry. As far as Draco knew, he was the only real Seer in this part of the world. Draco also knew that Thompson would love to see him locked up.
“I don’t intend to hurt him, but this is new to me. I might mess up along the way. More than once. Often in fact,” Harry replied.
He slept in the studio that night. He had vivid dreams, but no visions. When he woke up it was still dark outside, and the moon shone directly onto that golden scar. Draco got out of bed and sat down, naked, in front of the two canvases. He had dreamed about that place again, about that night that had changed everything for him, giving him the visions, the power, and the inability to stand human touch. He could feel his heart beating faster and faster in his chest the longer he stared at the canvases in the dark. And then he fell inside.
“Fair enough: I didn’t know much about it. I probably didn’t want to know much about it, because it made me even more alien.”
Pansy snorted and Blaise gave her a look, and then continued, “Maybe we can combine it with the release of your new book.”
“I’m glad you said yes, Draco,” Harry said. He was too close, a few times as they walked down the street their fingers nearly brushed.
Antoine inclined his head and he looked so pretty and young in that moment that it nearly hurt to look at him, Harry thought. Were all vampires so alluring?
Harry nodded. “But did you realize that the only parts I kind of remembered involved Draco for some reason, or muggles?” Like the Origami bird, Harry thought. There had been other flashes of memory, and they had all involved Draco somehow. There was one in particular that was haunting him. Draco’s face, tears streaming down his pale skin, and then blood. So much blood. He knew he had to ask about it, but he wanted to ask Draco.
Harry hadn’t ever thought of himself as particularly kindhearted. He had selected the cases himself with all the wisdom of his seventeen years. Some might have been worthy of his attention that he had let slip to the side, some he just flat out refused to consider and yes, he was very aware that his feelings, his emotions had played a big role on whose behalf he had spoken.
“And muggle raised too, with all the notions about this kind of thing that come with it. Trust me when I tell you these professionals have every autonomy they could desire. It’s work, like any other work. It’s a service and a pleasure, if you know what you want and what you are in the mood for. Besides they are very well compensated.”
“Potter is stalking the manor,” Draco said. He needed to talk with someone about it and Pansy would probably only roll her eyes at him and tell him to do some of the lovely filthy things with Potter he was constantly writing about.
“You don’t have to marry the guy, but wouldn’t that be delightfully scandalous? Just fuck his brains out and be done with it.”
“Should we send him a reply?” He asked the bird and reached out to touch her soft feathers. She let him and he smiled again.
Harry reached out to him and Draco looked at his hand. He had seen that hand before of course, he had those fingers in his mouth, he had that hand around his cock, but it felt different now. He clasped it and Harry pulled him up.
Harry’s cock was so on board with that idea. He pulled his fingers out, lubed up his cock and pushed Draco’s legs wider apart. Draco propped himself up on his elbows like he wanted to see everything. Harry took a deep breath.
Potter looked at his face then. “You think if the ritual is completed, all this will disappear?” He waved his hand vaguely at Draco’s naked body.
“Merlin,” Draco hissed and got up, he made himself at home in Potter’s lap, his fingers in Potter’s unruly hair. “You think you are a convenience fuck for me?”
“Yes, but I have you and you have an excellent track record when it comes to saving my life,” Draco said.
“Are you sure this is an expert?” Draco asked a few days later. There was no new murder and that was good of course, but also Harry could feel himself getting restless. He daydreamed sometimes about taking Draco to a nice restaurant, about holding his hand while they walked through a park and kissing him passionately behind a bar.
“Who else would you snag, Draco Malfoy? The king of vampires is just good enough for you,” Harry smiled.
Draco rubbed at his eyes. He could feel a headache coming. He had been up all night again, because the new part wanted to be written. He loved that these stories and characters came so easily to him, but getting it all out of his head on paper still took a lot of time and a toll on his body and mind sometimes too.
“It’s a simple enough spell. I learned it when I was eleven,” Draco replied and conjured a stack of colorful paper. “We start with the basics,” he said and then proceeded to show Harry how to fold an Origami crane. Harry watched Draco’s hands, his fingers. He had nice fingers, long and slender, a bit boney with fine round nails that looked like polished glass.
Draco grabbed his paints and began smearing them onto the blank canvas. Harry watched him for a few moments and then decided to sit down; there was no telling how long this would take. He was fascinated by the whole affair, by the way Draco hummed under his breath, the way he moved, the way the colours took shape on the canvas. The smell of dark, wet earth got stronger, strong enough that Harry looked around to find the source despite feeling deep down it was coming from Draco.
“Why am I here?” Potter interrupted. He folded his hands on the table. They were good hands, Draco noted, big and strong. Clean, too. Draco had always liked big hands on him, well...before.
“There is nothing wrong with liking boys or girls or both, but Harry,” and here Neville turned so he could look at Harry. “No one will really understand if it’s who I think it is.”
Harry wasn’t going to confirm that, because he knew better than admit to it. “Mrs. Zabini is very knowledgeable, Astra, and you know it. Something doesn’t add up. You visited Krabat?”
“Let me finish, okay?” Harry asked and when Draco nodded, he continued, “I think I am in love with you, I can’t remember if I was ever in love before, people keep telling me I was, but really, it doesn’t matter. I was told these people are my friends, but to be honest, I can’t really remember all the things we supposedly did together. I like them, mostly, but I don’t feel that deep connection to them. And I feel guilty for it, because they do feel it, but I just – I think I can’t be their friend out of guilt, that isn’t a good basis for anything. And I would rather break it off with Ron and Hermione than be without you and if Ron hurt you, Draco, I will hurt him.” He could feel Draco relax.
Harry cut Ron off. “Just because I can’t remember most of my life before I woke up in that inn, doesn’t mean I’m vulnerable, Ron. I still have my wits and my magic. I hardly think I am more vulnerable now than I was when I first discovered I was a wizard at eleven.”
Draco sighed and pushed Harry away gently. “You have five minutes so use them wisely, once they’re up I’m going to suck your cock, Potter.”
He was on a job here. He was going to protect that git – it was easier to call him that in his head for the time being – with all his skill and honor. Harry wasn’t going to fail, not only because his pride didn’t allow it, but also because despite everything (and of course he was thinking of his past, their past) he didn’t want to see Draco Malfoy dead. And the deaths of the victims had been all very gruesome. He had known some of them briefly, of course he did.
“You think tomorrow everything will be better? He will still be my lover, you…you, to hell with this Potter!”
“Don’t you feel bad for it? Now people will die for sure,” Antoine said. “There won’t be any vampires to heal them.”
“If everyone would do that we wouldn’t be here right now,” Harry countered. They have been here before, Draco thought, that first day in his study.
“You know we’re dating,” Harry said. He had told his friends as soon as Draco had allowed it. It went over surprisingly well. Probably because everyone, except for Harry himself, had apparently known that he had been crushing on Draco sixth year.
It was true, since Harry had lost his virginity three weeks ago, he had been wanting sex a lot. Draco wasn’t complaining, at all, because sex with Harry was amazing and it got better the more they did it. He was still discovering little things about Harry, but his praise kink was doing it for Draco big time too.
Harry moaned, he liked when Draco scrapped his teeth against the skin there and then kissed it and Draco knew by now that it got Harry hot like nobody’s business.
“I’ve looked into him. He graduated at eighteen like the lot of you after the war. His grades were really good. He’s a smart guy,” Ivan said.
Draco nodded. Of course, Blaise had his back. Blaise was the reason, Draco was even here right now, holding Harry’s hand in public. Not that anyone was around just yet, but that would change.
“Then we’re halfway there, now strip,” Draco said, and it was the tone that made Harry’s cock pay attention, so he stripped, because it made Draco happy. And because Harry really loved it when Draco took charge like this.
Blaise smiled at him, it was that secret smile, the one Draco only started noticing after he and Blaise started to sleep together.
“I know, but it’s not ‘Draco’s case’ Harry. It was never his case. He’s just a medium; he doesn’t solve crimes, he gives clues.”
Harry sighed. “I don’t think I can work as an Auror anymore. I can’t work for the very people who did this to Draco. I mean, they did kidnap him, didn’t they?”
“They had him under a curse and I think they have been starving him too. Giving him just enough to make him able to heal people, but not enough to free himself.”
“Ask Hermione for help. I already talked to her and she’s looking into Julien’s past, but I’m sure she will help you out.”
With a little help from his not so straight and narrow friends Harry got a list of everyone who had been involved in the medical facility that had held Draco captive and he oblivated them all. It took him less than a week, because Draco was there to help him.
“You look like you got laid, Harry Potter,” Ivan said and Harry was glad he hadn’t used ‘Auror Potter’. So shortly after hearing Draco saying it while he was naked...well, better not to think about being naked in Draco’s presence.
“So, is that what you’re doing? You’re working with him? Editing? Publishing? I heard that Blaise is founding a publishing house.” Harry wanted to know.
“I did and still do. In fact, I was thinking maybe we could use some of that knowledge tonight,” Harry replied, and Draco had to kiss him. Just thinking about Harry tied up to their bed made him hard.
Harry blinked, breathed and then shut the book and put it aside. Luna had said the author was all the rage right now, Hermione had scoffed a bit, but he knew her well enough to know that she was probably in awe of the balls this author had and secretly liked the story too. Or stories, because this was the third book by H.J. Belladonna. Harry suspected that a name like that had to be a penname. On the other hand, in the world of witches and wizards you could hardly ever tell.
“I will make a production out of it,” Draco said. “Down the line and you will say yes. We will talk about it beforehand like real adults and –“
“Okay,” Harry said. “Okay, so maybe the whole no touching thing is just a side product. Maybe something at Malfoy Manor triggered it.”
That was unfortunately true. On both accounts. He had doodled Mr. Starlord, Pansy’s evil cat who he fucking hated. Mr. Starlord had let him know on more than one occasion that the feeling was mutual.
No way in hell. He didn’t even look at the contract, because he knew he wouldn’t like it. He crumbled that up instead too. The owl was still waiting. Draco was tempted to write a curt ‘fuck off’ and be done with it, but that wouldn’t solve a damn thing. He needed a second opinion and he knew he would have to tell Harry the truth too. Which sucked, because things with Harry were going very well.
“You want to throw away all we did together, everything we suffered, seven years of friendship for Malfoy?” Ron asked, outraged.
Draco’s heart missed a beat. Was Potter on to him? Was his fledgling writing career going to crash down around him? Was Potter fucking playing with him?
“What will it take for you to call me by my given name?” Potter asked, but he seemed rather amused by the whole thing.
Draco pushed him onto the bed in answer. It was big and soft and had of course a canopy, with tiny embroidered twinkling stars on it.
“Vision Number 1 through 33. This one is 33,” Draco answered. He looked at it again. “Henri says it shows all the victims until now in parts.”
His back was small, his waist slim and his legs long, Harry noticed. He was noticing a lot about men now that he had the freedom to look. Draco Malfoy had inherited his mother’s beauty.
Antoine smiled, showing a flash of his fangs. “Why ask questions you know the answers to? Why not ask the questions you don't know the answers to?”
“It’s not about me, it’s about you Draco and I know it’s been only two weeks since I came through your door and you welcomed me so warmly-“
When he "woke up", as he liked to call it, the wooden floor of the studio was littered with paper. He had used different shades of green and his subject, to no one’s surprise, was Potter.
“If we spin this a bit further, then it must be someone who was there that night, or who knows about this kind of ritual,” Draco said. “Which makes me the only witness.”
“Please suck me,” he said and Draco smiled. Harry knew they’ve done this before, but this was better, of course, because he would remember every second of this for the rest of his life. Draco’s lips made contact with Harry’s dick: it was a kiss. No one had ever kissed his dick like this and it made his heart beat faster in his chest.
“But it could be used as a weaker form of an Imperious? And if someone tells you to forget the last half hour, it could work?”
There was something there, Harry knew. He had become a very good Auror over the years, and had learned to read people. He knew that Draco Malfoy had a secret. His mind wandered back to his school days, when he had obsessed over Draco Malfoy and his secrets. He had been right back then too, but he had also been petty and righteous.
Draco Malfoy, disgraced princeling of Slytherin now dating Harry James Potter, hero of the Wizarding world. Who would have thought?
“You like it when I praise you,” Draco said, it wasn’t really a question, but Harry answered anyway.
Harry smiled at him like he could read Draco’s thoughts, but didn’t comment and went to the coffee maker instead to pour himself a cup.
Harry sighed. Put like that it was a rather half-baked plan. And very dangerous too. Harry was ready to risk his own life, but he wasn't ready to let Antoine fall into the hands of the same people who had Draco already. “We have to scout the places then.”
Draco was watching Harry pour coffee when the wards went off. It was like a thousand little needles piercing his skin. He grabbed the edge of the table hard.
“You like to forget that you didn't have a say in this whole thing. They brought you to Draco and they made him heal you, you were unconscious for it all.”
“Yes, I did and now I have a successful business, bought nearly everything back I could and wanted-“
“Once this is over,” Potter said and then looked directly into Draco’s eyes. Draco felt pinned in place by that gaze, like a butterfly pierced by a pin. “Will you kick me to the curb?”
“I refuse to give into fear again, Harry. I had enough of that. I really fucking did,” Draco answered.
“I respect your work, Potter,” Draco answered, waving his hand in the direction of the sitting room. He conjured a pot of tea and some biscuits from the kitchen with a thought.
“Doesn’t Henri always know everything?” Pansy asked. Pansy didn’t like Henri much, but Pansy didn’t like anyone much.
It wasn't question, but Harry answered anyway. “Yes. In a secret Ministry facility.” He thought for a second and then decided to hell with everything else. He needed to find Draco. He made a promise, but that wasn't the reason at all. “Is he the only one?”
The denial was on his tongue, but he was pretty sure that Blaise was right. There have been signs after all. Harry Potter was many things, but subtle he was not.
Blaise grinned lazily. “I know that that is not your style, Draco. But yes, maybe we should all be grateful for how things had turned out. Do we deserve all the hatred and scorn that is thrown our way? No, because we were kids just trying to survive, with no fucking sane adults to show us how, but Draco, so was Potter and his merry friends.”
“Yes, as you know the only places not as heavily warded as the rest of the house are the hall and the small library,” Draco answered. “The fireplace in the library works of course, I could just Floo the Club and request someone I have already been with to come over. You can stand guard if you like.”
Potter looked away and didn’t answer for a long moment. “Isn’t it always like this with a one-night-stand?”
“It needs redecorating, really. A lot of it, but I guess we could have a townhouse. I’m keeping the Manor of course. For weekend getaways.”
“I’m sorry, it took so long,” Harry said, pressing his hand to the door. There was so much more he wanted to say but they didn’t have much time.
“Strangely enough,” Draco said in nearly a whisper, and it sounded like he was right there beside Harry, right there whispering into his ear. “I am not sorry you did it.” He scooted even closer and his cock pressed against Harry’s. He could feel it hot against his own flesh.
When he arrived in the dining room, Potter was already there. He hadn’t started on his food yet, and Draco was strangely touched by it.
“I know,” Harry said, because he did know that. He had no idea what would happen afterward, but he knew as much. They would get Draco out of there.
Malfoy nodded. “Yes, I did a lot of things back in the day because they somehow concerned you as well.”
“Draco is in the room and he is feeling very good right now,” Draco said and scooted closer to Harry, so his dick was rubbing against Harry’s stomach. Harry wished he was naked.
“It’s not a vision, it’s...a memory,” Draco replied. His skin felt itchy now, though he didn’t know why. It was such an irritating fucking feeling he stripped off his shirt.
“If you have a problem with this situation, go and talk to the headmistress or you know, Potter, who it seems has a thing for me-“
“Yes, but some of us were heroes, while others… were not,” Draco looked past Potter and out of the window. “You were going somewhere with this whole thing?”
Ivar said and Draco took the quill in hand. A scene was forming in his head already and he really wasn’t sure if it was his doing or if Ivar was something else, whispering it to him. In the end it really didn’t matter, Draco thought: it was going to be written either way.
“And I do fancy you,” Draco said. Harry smiled and it was hard to breathe for a long moment, but Draco got a grip, because he had to. “I just think you need to be aware that this won’t be all rainbows and candy, Harry.”
“Fuck, feels so good,” Draco groaned. He loved how honest Draco was during sex. It was like he left his protective shell outside the bedroom and let Harry see all of him. “A bit harder,” he added, and Harry obliged. He could tell that Draco was close and that was good, because Harry didn’t think he could keep himself from falling apart in the best way possible any longer.
“I don’t think this is all you are, Draco,” Potter said and brushed his hair aside, so the lightning bolt shaped scar was visible, “like this isn’t all I am.”
Harry grinned. “You and I both know I don’t need the money.” He got up and kneeled in front of Draco. Draco really liked Harry on his knees. Harry took Draco’s hands in his own and looked up at Draco. “We will be fine,” Harry said, and Draco believed him.
Harry stepped closer until he could touch Draco. He put his hands on Draco’s hips carefully and slowly.
Draco kissed his shoulder. “It is. Sleep now, Harry. You earned it and you will need your strength.”
Draco could feel a headache coming, probably because he hadn’t slept like a real person for days and hadn’t eaten like one either.
“And then what? The whole thing will begin from anew. You will forget, you will remember maybe with another scar. I won't know where you are. And even if by some miracle we could use a tracking spell that won't be detected by the people who run a secret medical facility, you would be in no condition to help me break you and Draco out. He is surely still under the Imperius Curse. He can't go against their wishes, you won't have your wand.”
“But you did lay their kingdom to waste,” Antoine said from the door. Harry looked over Draco’s shoulder at him. He looked amused and hungry.
“You chose to be an Auror after all the things you have been through and had seen. You chose to get right back into it all, just with more training. You could have been anything else. Really, anything else. A teacher maybe, or you could have written your own biography and live from that money – but as I understand it you don’t really need to work as you, Potter, are rich.”
Harry’s heart missed a beat. It wasn’t that no one ever had told him he was handsome, but no one ever had been so frank about looking at him, taking him in and telling him he was appreciating the view.
That night Draco slept in the studio. He always said that he was just a medium when the visions came over him, but that wasn’t quite true. He could feel and smell things, almost like dreaming, but not. It was hard to explain, so he wasn’t trying anymore. It wasn’t like anyone would know how it felt.
