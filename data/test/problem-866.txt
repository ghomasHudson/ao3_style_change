"No!" Harry rubbed his face with a frustrated motion.
"Oh my gorgeous, perfect Draco. I'm going to fucking worship you!"
This elicited a moan from both men as they lost themselves even more in each other.
He washed his robes himself, and his trousers as well!
Draco stood up from the bed, grimacing as the trousers creaked around his thighs. He decided to pull on his muggle joggers, at least Harry seemed to be having no issue with the washing. The joggers glided up his legs luxuriously - no creaking seams or straining waistbands.
Harry trailed off, his eyes dropping towards Draco's middle for a brief moment before returning to his face.
"Let me finish, love. You are so beautiful like this, you have no idea how insane your body drives me - has been driving me - for the past year."
Draco released the sigh of the long-suffering martyr, there was only one solution left, and it was not pleasant in the slightest!
"No! No, I would never do that to you, I know the rules! Actually, it doesn't have too much to do with me at all. Um, well, Draco you know I love you, and you are only more scrumptious, attractive, and obsession-worthy by the day.  And-"
With that, they were both hit by their orgasms, climaxing in unison as Harry continued his frenzied chest ministrations.
Draco's tummy wasn't going anywhere, anywhere except for 'outwards', that is.
"Draco, shhh you're alright, you're safe, love. I love you so much Draco, and we can do whatever you want to after this. If you want to see a healer about this I'll help and support you wholeheartedly, and the same goes for if you gain more weight, or if you stay the same. I love you eternally, forever and after angel, you have to know that! Draco, love, can you talk to me?"
Draco pecked Harry on the cheek before walking towards the table, where a beloved Black relic from Grimmauld place sat, steam coming from it's spout, the body of the cracked floral antiquity wrapped up in one of Luna's garishly coloured teapot cozies. As he sipped his tea Draco turned his faculties back to the case of the shrinking trousers. Was he washing the wizard clothes wrong? No, that could not possibly be it. Draco was a Malfoy after all, and Malfoy's - for all their many failings - were not wont to make such amateur mistakes in the area of fashion, the one subject closer to their hearts than money and power!
"Good morning love, how about you sit down at the table and have some tea, breakfast is just about ready."
"Harry, did you shrink my clothes after all? What are you not saying?"
"Harry...*sniff*...I - I love you! I love you so much for being here, for loving me more when I change, for continuing to love me when I'm a mess, I-" Draco took a shuddering breath before he continued.
He simply could not understand it!
Harry brought the last plate of food - a generous heap of bacon rashers - to the breakfast table and seated himself across from his husband. Conversation was minimal as Draco was consumed with thoughts of magical afflictions, and Harry was entranced with the way his love seemingly inhaled over double the portion size of the Draco only a year ago.
Like when he’d offered Harry breakfast, he seemed to expect Harry to say no.
“… can we?” he asked.
There had been something entirely non-confrontational about Malfoy, his questions placid and the small crook of his mouth seemingly born from genuine amusement.
“I am very much aware that I don’t have to, thank you.”
,” Ron would say, rolling his eyes “
Malfoy had seemed entirely too befuddled to do anything but acquiesce.
He gestured to the one closest to them.
He opened the door they were stood in front of.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” he’d say, oddly without bite, and Malfoy’s grin would only grow.
To find Kreacher staring unblinkingly at his partner.
Harry suspected he would never know if there had been an actual reason for it – had the ministry been scared that they’d fuck it up if they gave them something too difficult? Had they worried that anything complex or interesting might bring even more attention from the media? Had they just wanted to start them out slow as partners? – or if the timing had simply been such that there'd been a lull in criminal activity around that time.
“Oh, why the bloody hell not,” he’d said, in that tone of weary long-suffering that he’d acquired since the War. “Might as well get it over with. Come along, why don’t you, Malfoy.”
… No, no, that wasn’t true, it definitely made him feel worse.
Malfoy must have sensed his weakness because he’d pushed on: “It’s not going to drink itself.”
Harry had glared and entirely missed Malfoy’s startled look at his side.
“Earl grey,” Malfoy specified, when Harry didn’t answer for a little bit too long.
they’d been quoted as saying, and I just remember thinking that they were crazy.”
“S-suppose not,” the had said, eyes flicking between Harry and Malfoy. “I- hm-… ‘pologies, there, Mr. Malfoy, sir. Them preconceptions ran with me, there – ain’t never been the best at thinking before doin’, my Susie says.”
Malfoy had been sprawled on the couch beside him, humming a quiet tune that Harry hadn’t been able to identify.
“Alive!” the man same man as before had commanded, and Harry believed that had been the only reason they’d remained so.
Malfoy, who had been making noises of indignation and protest, quieted.
“No shit, Potter,” Malfoy had replied. “Twelve of them and two of us, don’t think we should try it on open ground?”
?"  Malfoy demanded. "What the hell do you think you’re doing, barging-"
Turned out that the papers had not been fibbed solely for tax purposes; the perpetrators had been attempting to smuggle in rhinoceros’ horn and powdered witches' mummy.
Like a punch in the chest, it hit him that it hadn’t been their
(In ways Harry had not yet fully felt that he had become.)
He set off at a half-run, some instinct or strange magic pulling him forwards. Down a corridor, up a flight of stairs... The moon glimpsed through windows, his steps a fast and echoing beat in the empty halls.
Stuck in his office with the paperwork of cases he never got to have any real impact on, Harry had waited for Malfoy to pass his exams and be granted the license to practice as a junior auror. It was a period of his life he had spent wishing time would move faster, just as fervently as he did for it to go slower.
Harry blinked, feeling like absolutely nothing about the current situation was making any sense.
Then he felt his heartbeat.
The ministry had put as much of the story out to the press as possible in an attempt to dampen speculation. This, unfortunately, wasn’t nearly enough to be sufficiently juicy to be able to compete with what the creative reporters at the Prophet could come up with and, so, speculation had kept right on running rampant.
with Malfoy as a perfectly valid target.
Needless to say, the professionalism Robards had requested had been sorely lacking.
Hermione had put another cooling spell on the bump on his head where a photographer had accidentally hit him with his camera, flailing it about in an attempt to keep it safe in the ruckus outside Ron and Hermione’s apartment. Their wards had gone haywire with the swarm of press outside, and Harry had been caught in the mob until they’d set them right and managed to grab him. She’d given him a potion, too, but it would be another couple of minutes before it went into effect.
Four had remained around Malfoy, and three had still circled Harry.
? Because the fucking
Harry himself, though, had too much racing through his mind to notice any of it.
“Well,” Harry had said, the doors sliding open at his side. “Perhaps I was mostly cross that he thought of doing it before I did.”
Harry hadn’t been able to pinpoint
He’d shrugged.
Harry was shaking his head before Malfoy had even finished speaking.
“You go first,” Malfoy said. “That’s my side.”
“Feeling cheery today, are we?” Malfoy had asked, and Harry had been about two seconds from punching him in the face.
And, as he’d already been worked up and angry, that had been enough of a cue for Harry to go off on him about the reason for their visit.
too much, really.
partner, now, all of a sudden –, Wilkins, had been paired up with the tall blonde woman, Craig, who’d finished up her training the same month Harry had got the news about Malfoy. Harry had always found Wilkins a bit slow (in mind and wand both, if he was to be honest) but the loss of his partner still struck him hard, as it meant that he was no longer allowed in the field; solo-work was strictly prohibited.
Then Malfoy kissed him.
at him…
“Can’t be too much point in it, now, anyway,” Ron had said, after another couple of seconds of silence had passed. “Since you’re an auror and all, anyways.”
“Damn right you weren’t!”
Suddenly a shadow seemed to wrench itself from the wall, taking the shape of a man.
Hermione had treated his arrival as though it had been expected: “Oh, Malfoy, Harry finally brought you with, did he? Well, I’d thought about getting some chips, but if we’re four we could get one of those platters to share that they’ve started with. Hannah has said that they’re really good, and she’ll be biased of course, but I’m still interested. What do you think?”
Malfoy had kept on humming his tune for a little bit, his sock-clad feet swaying a little along with the melody of it. He had crossed them atop the armrest, and his black trousers had ridden up slightly to reveal pale skin. His shirt had come untucked a bit from his trousers and the sleeves were both rolled up to his elbows, one arm slung over the backrest and the other holding the rim of his glass in a long-fingered grip a few inches above the floor.
?” Malfoy asked, pushing the drawer closed and turning with a neatly folded black t-shirt in his hands. He unfurled it with a flick of his wrist and then pulled it over his head.
Harry had met the eyes of one of his assailants.
"Dear God," Malfoy said suddenly, tone abruptly entirely different. Harry couldn't help but look up. "You were serious."
Fuck.
“Well,” Ron had said. “I mean, I know you said you didn’t have a choice, but-… Well, you weren’t exactly pals back then. Can’t have been fun getting told you’d be stuck with him – sorry, mate.”
It was the opposite direction that Harry had come from, and not the way he would have expected Malfoy to lead them. He hesitated only for a second, though, before he followed; Malfoy knew the house best, after all.
"Potter,
Ever since the very first year, he’d made it tradition to hole up in his apartment and refuse to see anyone. Ron and Hermione had, by this time, learnt that there was no point in bothering him.

No Unforgivable had been cast yet, so they had limited themselves to disarmers and reversible incapacitators only.

he demanded sharply as he pulled the door open, not even bothering to wait to see who it was.
“Because I love you?” Harry guessed, cheeks heating almost painfully.
Malfoy peered at him, brow slightly furrowed, and the dam burst
Then Ron had turned his eyes heavenward and released a heavy sigh.

Harry had shaken his head at the ridiculous notion, deciding firmly that it must have been a fluke.
aware that you are the most famous wizard of our age?”
Harry had asked the almost fluorescently green snake lounging across a thick tree branch by the window.
It was spacious, though not massive, with a sturdy wooden desk with matching chair, a settee by the window, and a bed over to the right. The bed was wide and made with white dark covers with a silky sheen, and it had quite clearly been slept in. There was no fireplace.
Malfoy’s eyes had turned from Wilkins’ abandoned desk in the corner and fixed on him.
Eventually, though, Harry had spotted an opening he hadn’t been able to help but to take; as the man stumbled over a curb, his attention had lapsed for a moment and the magic had fizzled out without leaving his wand.
He found no words to finish his explanation.
would likely be far faster than running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Glad that Malfoy hadn’t been there to witness his idiocy, he’d popped back down.
Despite the awkwardness that had ensued in the office that he’d left behind, Malfoy had, indeed, ended up coming along.
For one terrifying moment, he had no idea where he was.
Harry swallowed.

“Potter what-“
Nor the rest of the Ministry of Magic, for that matter.
Harry thought,

Kreacher's wails had followed them, laments over Harry's incompetence mixed with cries of despair at having let down the noble and most ancient house of Black.

“Can I get you anything?” Malfoy asked. “Tea? Warm milk? Something stronger?”

“Okay,” he said.
“Yes!”
alive, wasn’t he?
The next time Harry woke, it was morning. The curtains hardly stood a chance against the light, now. The windows faced east, and the morning sun painted long and golden bands across the bed and on the floor.
For all the relief he felt at actually getting a quasi-real assignment, the whole situation had still irked him enough that he’d stubbornly insisted he’d be a lookout while Malfoy went and dealt with the man.
A reconnaissance mission had been planned to stake out the location.
"You're alive," Harry breathed, attempting to pull him even closer. "You're alive. Merlin, God, fuck, you're alive."
Harry hadn’t even had time to curse himself for his rashness before the spell exploded in a firework of red in front of him.
look away from Malfoy,
Later that same evening, Harry had tipped his head back and drunk the potion in big, greedy gulps. The potion had been unusually minty and had had a cool texture that had felt like a balm running down his coughed-sore throat.
There had been no more opportunity for communication then, verbal or otherwise, as all their respective attentions had been demanded by fending off their attackers.
Feeling unmoored by the whole situation, he’d placed an awkward hand on Malfoy’s shoulder. This had caused his partner to startle terribly, but his eyes had refocused on Harry’s face.
“They’ll be no use to us if they get away!” The witch who’d snarled the words had been circling Malfoy and the utter
Robards had given him a flat and unimpressed look. “I expect professionalism from my aurors, Potter.”
A very Malfoy-esque way of describing the lives of both yourself and your loved ones depending on the success of your task, Harry had thought with a snort. Arguing it would be fruitless, though, he knew, and so he conceded the point with a shake of his head.
“Here we are,” Malfoy said, after what seemed like an eternity but couldn’t actually have been more than a minute.
Harry had aggressively pretended that it wouldn’t, right up until the moment that it did.
regarding the safety procedures he’d admittedly disregarded just the
The man had flicked it away from him with a twitch of his wand.
The first time Malfoy had come to Grimmauld Place had been after Harry’d been stupid and rash.
An embarrassing amount of too generously filled glasses later, Harry had been sitting slouched in the armchair in his living room, tipping the bottle lazily back and forth as he rested it against the armrest and watched the amber liquid swirl.
Harry stood so suddenly that he didn't even realize he was doing it until the sound of the chair scraping against the floor reached his ears.
And then everything had promptly gone to shit.
“I don’t know!” Harry cried again. “For making it weird! I didn’t
Harry stared helplessly down at him and wished desperately for him to get up out of bed.
Malfoy hair had been swept back, not unlike the way it had been back in their school days, though far less rigidly. A bit longer at the top than at the sides and in the back, it was more like he’d pushed it back with his hands rather than gelled it back with a comb. There had been stubble on his cheeks, too, adding a shadow and maturity to his face that Harry had not been able to help but to compare to his own still patchy growth. He could also recall that his overall impression of Malfoy had been that he was
Malfoy wore silvery-gray pajama trousers, tied with a bow below his exposed navel, and a blue silk robe that hung threateningly low on his shoulders.
It had always been too much to hope for, Harry had realized after the fact, that a good deed would ever go unpunished.
Harry woke with a start, green still flickering before his eyes.
to keep acting like he was looking for the quickest route of escape; half the reason this whole thing had been so awkward was probably because Harry had
The drumming had escalated into a ruthless thundering and his pulse appeared set on keeping its pace. The itch in the back of his mind, the twitching in his leg; both so relentless that he could barely stand to stay seated on the chair. He
“Yeah, definitely,” Harry had said, relieved to have a semi-valid reason to cut his paperwork for the afternoon a little bit short, and put his quill down. “You coming, too, Malfoy?”
And thinking
The elevator bell had finally dinged, indicating their arrival at their floor.
As Harry felt the bed dip under Malfoy’s weight, Harry thought again of that question Hermione had asked them –
What Ron had thought that they
One early morning in November, they’d been called to Diagon Alley, where someone had smashed the storefront windows of the
Malfoy said, gritting his teeth and spinning away for a moment only to turn right back around in the next. “I just fucking
“That, too,” Malfoy had agreed, tone almost frustratingly flippant.
Nevertheless, Harry felt like he was sealing his own fate when he said: “No, I, er-… Breakfast sounds pretty good, actually. If it’s no trouble?”
“You didn’t-…? What do you
As mystifying as this potentiality had been, and for as much he’d pondered the matter during his last couple of days stuck at home, no suspicion that Malfoy would have tampered with the potion ever crossed his mind. As a matter of fact, so complete was the absence of any misgivings that he never even thought to note the lack of them as odd.
“Another couple of minutes.”
Malfoy had blinked. Then, to Harry’s utter bewilderment, he’d tilted his head back and laughed. A full laugh, straight from the belly, his whole face transformed by it.
They caught the first with a combined stunner, then a ball of flame exploded between him and Malfoy, forcing them to dive in separate directions. A blast of yellow light had followed shortly thereafter, and this time Harry had had no need to wonder about the nature of the curse. He’d screamed as he fell.
The hole in the wall would create a chokepoint, certainly, but once inside there would be no more cover for them than there had been outside; the whole building had just been an empty expanse of space.
The label on the bottle had suddenly caught Harry’s eyes.
Face heating, he hurried to get to his feet.
“Er, yeah,” Harry had realized, having forgotten about the owl Malfoy had sent him in the morning until that very moment. “Just my partner from work, though, so don’t worry about having something prepared or anything.”
“Oh?” Malfoy had said, lips quirking as he raised his eyebrows. “Could have fooled me.”
“I knew you wouldn’t let her go!” Bellett had wailed, clinging to Bancroft’s robes. “I just- I didn’t know what else to
Harry had pointed behind him without looking away from the snake. “
Harry had stared at the rack, not quite knowing what to do or how to feel.
But his tongue felt thick and heavy in his mouth, and he could not bring himself to speak.
Harry had been about to tell her that it was because it was classified and that he didn’t even know himself when Malfoy had spoken.
Malfoy put down his fork and looked at him.
Out loud, though, he managed a mechanic: "I'm sorry."

It hadn’t been cursed, but whatever powder had been in it had swirled up in the air and Harry had breathed it in before the thought that maybe he oughtn’t had even begun to cross his mind.
more skilled – than those they usually faced, however, and their saving grace was that they hadn’t been completely surrounded; with a sprawling and open field at their backs, the Death Eaters had likely chosen to forgo that advantage in favor of more secure hiding spots and opportunities for physical cover.
that it had taken him several moments to realize that that hadn’t been a
And that, at least, had provoked a reaction.
“You’re the great Harry Potter,” Malfoy said, “visiting the home of a lowly Death Eater; one must make exceptions.”
Malfoy said. “
Then he shook his head lightly, walked over, and got into the bed. The candles that had lit the room went out with a flick of his wand.
The room they were sat in was some sort of veranda, walls entirely made of glass. A great big mahogany table stood in the middle and the room was decorated with a profusion of growing things, many of which were in bloom. A marvel of a room, really, and yet Harry barely managed to take any of it in.
Though Harry’s contribution was fairly marginal - bordering on non-existent, really - Malfoy managed to keep up a conversation as they filled their plates. He indicated the marmalade he found to be superior this time of year, informed Harry on how the greenhouses were spelled to manage fresh tomatoes year-round, as well as continued his musings on how they might go about setting up the wards.
“You just apparated.”
Harry's throat clicked as he swallowed.
After a few moments, Harry started: “I’m not-…“
.” Hermione, meanwhile, pursed her lips and muttered sarcastic things about his “
Doing so at the expense of slighting Malfoy, though, seemed to be taking it one step too far.
"I thought I had rubbed off some Slytherin manners on you by now," Malfoy continued, not even looking at him as he cut another piece of melon and pierced it with his fork. "But clearly I will need to redouble my efforts."
The leader’s cry had been met only with a crazed roar as the aurors had finally burst in through the gaping hole in the wall.
Harry’d been cross about it, having looked forward to flinging some hexes around and being done with the case, and that was really his only excuse for doing what he did.
Harry had glanced in his direction and had immediately found himself sharing the sentiment.
“You is a Black,” Kreacher had said, eyes still unmovingly on Malfoy, somewhere between accusatory and reverent. “Master has
But no sooner than that, he found.
And slowly, slowly Harry found something unwinding within him.
“How long do you think-?”
The young man hadn’t made use of anything that would cause lasting harm, should they have been hit, but a stunner taking them down would still mean that they’d lose him. They’d both known it and, as such, they both went heavy on the defense. Their perpetrator must have had the same realization as they, though, because he kept a steady barrage of hexes raining down on them.
A case of nerves had begun to worm around in Harry’s belly, but a sneezing fit had stopped him from examining the sensation further.
Then he sighed, put one hand on his hip and the other over his eyes.
The sound that had escaped Kreacher could not fairly have been described as either a wail or a squeal, as it had been something squarely in between.
“It’s not finished yet,” Harry had found himself saying.
Harry had stared blankly into space, unwilling –
Harry hadn’t even managed a witty retort, too rattled still at how flawlessly Malfoy had read him and intercepted.
“Thanks,” Harry had managed, blowing his nose.
As had the way his gaze had immediately fixed on Harry, shining with a silent plea for help.
Keeping his eyes open as long as he could, he eventually fell asleep
Malfoy held Harry’s hand flat against his chest and, for several long moments, the adrenaline coursed too fiercely through him for him to be able to register anything.
By the time they had neared the door to the building, two had gone down, but one of them had already been let out of her body-bind by another. Eleven against two, but as soon as they were inside, the numbers would matter less. Hopefully.
“C’mon, Malfoy,” Harry had said. “It’s just me.”
“For my safety,” he’d said. “The consensus in the team I worked with was that I’d become a target for the remaining Death Eaters if they knew how much I’d helped out. I hardly think I need to worry about you three cavorting with that particular lot and revealing my sins.”
Malfoy had looked utterly stunned, and Harry had realized with dawning panic that he’d
Malfoy had burst out laughing ar that, and it had been so unexpected that the words had disappeared from Harry’s mouth.
Harry had glanced at the store, owls perched in the window, beholding the proceedings. Then his eyes had caught.
Malfoy had shrugged, as if to say
Finally, Harry had said: “That’s classified.”
Malfoy’s gaze had gone narrow and sharp, though no expression of anger ever crossed his features.
!” Malfoy had exclaimed. Malfoy had looked at him like he was being unusually thick, even by his standards. “Potter, I know we joke about this, but you
“Livingroom,” he’d lied-slash-guessed, trying to infuse his voice with surety. “Why?”
“I’ll return to help you fix the wards tomorrow, of course,” Harry said. “But I think it’s best if I sleep in my own bed tonight.”
Harry hadn’t known what to say to that.
Harry had sat for three days and stared at parchment –
Contrary to his words, though, Malfoy had called an elf to his room and informed him that there would be two people for breakfast today, thank you. After that, he’d again offered Harry to borrow something from his closet. Harry had declined, perhaps a little bit too quickly, if Malfoy’s raised eyebrows had been anything to go by (but the itching in the back of Harry’s head had increased at the suggestion, the fuse flaring bright, and he hadn’t quite been able to stop himself). In the end, though, Malfoy had simply shrugged and decided to forgo changing out of his pajamas as well, with an
“And a good day to you too, Potter,” Malfoy had said, raising that eyebrow of his at him.
He’d glanced around but, as of yet, they hadn’t caught the attention of the other people on the street.
Harry had caught himself drawing exaggeratedly loud and deep breath in an effort to show Malfoy what he’d wanted him to do, and then felt immediately embarrassed. But, then, he hadn’t had any other ideas.
And Harry had thought he’d been rid of that kind of thing, now that he was an adult.
had made him feel naïve and stupid and childish.
“Charming,” Malfoy had said, raising his eyebrows.
It had been like throwing oil on a fire. If the dueling had been ferocious before, it had turned into a torrent then. Barely the dark of night had been let in between the flashes of spells and all Harry had been able to do was keep raising his shields.
Harry looked up from Malfoy’s feet to his bed. It looked somehow… intimidating.
“There,” Malfoy said, his voice by now only a mumble. “There you go.”
Potentially
Harry had not stood when Robards did.
Malfoy and Harry had stepped a good distance away from the shop owners to discuss the statements they’d taken.
The elevator had never traveled as bloody slowly between floors as it had that day.
make it for you. I’ve already purchased the ingredients and brewed the base, because I had the foresight to anticipate you being a bloody idiot, but it’s the middle of the night now and we need to wait for the moon to wane, so you can’t have any right this moment.”
It had gone so far that he’d even started questioning his choice to join the Ministry in the first place. If they were willing to use his name to manipulate the public into not rioting over the fact that a bloody
It was not many moments until Harry could no longer withstand the creeping terror, and he lifted his hand and held it, hovering, above Draco’s nose and mouth. For what felt like too long, there was nothing, and Harry’s heart leaped in his chest. Then a brush, warm and humid, swept across his fingers.
Malfoy stared at him incredulously.
” – and he would try to get a hold of his case file. It was thoroughly classified, however, supposedly due to the extreme nature of the artifacts uncovered on the property Malfoy had been the head of since Lucius’ passing, and far above the paygrade of a junior auror.
. Ron and Malfoy had traded a look, wearing identical expressions, and that alone had surely been enough to count as a sign of an impending apocalypse.
Harry had attempted to school his face into doing something different but, as he didn’t quite know what expression Malfoy was referring to, he’d ended up with something he feared looked mostly constipated.
“I don’t know, Potter,” Malfoy said, raising a mocking brow. “Can you?”
, Harry thought. Malfoy was so beautiful; how could it possibly have taken
“Pepper up. Whitherson’s sell them by the dozen, so I assumed you’d be out by now.”
, Harry had heard Malfoy draw a breath that reached all the way to the bottom of his lungs.
This day, he was the Chosen One. The Boy Who Lived.
“Right,” Harry had said, scratching at the back of his head. “Sorry.”
Some of Malfoy’s smile faded as they looked at each other, until it no longer reached his eyes.
For several heartbeats, everything was absolutely still. Then the disquiet started creeping in.
A little yelling had hardly been enough to get all the fight out of Harry’s system, though, especially not with how the past weeks had been. He’d still felt tightly wound and wrong-footed when they’d returned, tapping his foot impatiently as the elevator had carried them slowly back up to their office from Portkeys.
Harry suddenly felt so unbearably ridiculous that he had to look away. The hallway he had come from was entirely empty, though he thought that he spotted the hem of a fluttering robe in a painting as its inhabitant hastily vacated it. Harry’s cheek burned, and he had to hope that the darkness would be sufficient to cover it.
It hadn't been fresh wiggenbush.
“Why me?” he had asked. “Why-… We
Death Eaters.
He’d gestured impatiently for Harry to get on with it, and so Harry had – sneaking looks back at Malfoy all the while. Malfoy had rolled his eyes at him, but Harry had not missed the tightness around his mouth as he whispered with the snake.
Again, Harry glanced back at the bed.
Harry blinked.
his name and the public approval it could buy them?
“Alive!” A voice had barked sharply through the shroud of debris, Harry barely even aware of it through the veil of pain. “We agreed!”
“Life’s easier when I pick my battles with him, I’ve found,” Harry had said. “And we’ve already had a row about lunch.”
How the bloody hell was he supposed to, when he didn’t even know what fuck was going on himself?
“Owls can’t,” he’d said with a wide grin, stalking over.
“Company,” he said, finally, putting a hand on Harry’s back and pushing him gently into the room.
Harry had finally turned to fully face Malfoy. His gray eyes had met Harry’s, face entirely impassive.
“I’m- I wasn’t-…” Harry tried, but Malfoy quickly waved him away.
Harry and Malfoy had apparated to the carefully pre-selected spot still bickering about where they should get their customary nightly snack after they were done.
The bed was soft, the hour late, and his pillow fluffy.
It had been a late Wednesday afternoon when Harry had realized that he’d officially gone round the bend. A visit by Ron had been the instigating incident.
long to realize?
“You’re not
but Harry hardly even noticed, too caught up in wrapping his arms around him, feeling his warmth, breathing him in.
The healers had chucked a bezoar down his throat the moment he’d arrived, and that had been the whole of it, really (though Malfoy had reported that the Unspeakables had come to claim the little chest, even so). The true punishment for his idiocy came the next morning, when it turned out he’d picked up a horrible flu during his brief hospital stay.
And he didn't know which one was worse.
Malfoy had dragged his hand through his hair; a gesture Harry had by then learned to associate with frustration
“C’mon, breathe, you can do it,” Harry had mumbled awkwardly, mostly in lack of anything better to say, but suddenly Malfoy’s hand had closed like a vice around the fabric of his robes over his chest.
“Malfoy?” he’d asked, but received no response. “Malfoy?”
Harry had flipped him off and been prepared to drop the subject, but Hermione had pressed on.
The smile had died on his lips and he’d stood from his half-crouch by the window.
“I don’t hold people responsible for their families, Ronald,” Hermione had said archly. “But I’m not defending him, I’m simply saying that the press has always been like this, Malfoy or no.”
Harry had had no time to apologize, or to reassure him that Malfoy was unlikely to stay more than a few moments anyway, before Kreacher had already popped off to open the door.
The thought struck him, then, that perhaps Malfoy wouldn't be comfortable being friends with him after this. It stuck like glue in his head, louder and more terrible than anything else, and produced a painful lump in his throat that was difficult to breathe around.
“Well, just always thought it was a bit weird, is all,” he’d started, waving vaguely in the air, as if he could dismiss the subject that way. “When Malfoy first showed up, he just kind of waltzed into the office, calm as you please, and
"There's no need for that kind of sentimental nonsense, Potter," Malfoy said, rather tartly, and picked up his fork again and resumed eating. "I'm sure that's all fine and dandy with your usual Gryffindor layabouts, but classier folk will feel smothered if you spell out your affections quite so clearly."
May 2
He’d thought Ginny had trod on his nerves, those last couple of months where they’d still deluded themselves into thinking that they loved each other as anything other than as a brother and sister, but that hardly held a candle to the effect Malfoy had had on him. Harry’s had blood felt as though it had been replaced by fiendfyre most days, a wrong look or a raised eyebrow more than enough to make him want to punch Malfoy’s aristocratic nose right off his stupid pasty face.
“It is being very rude not to have anything to offer guests,” he’d said, in that half-to-himself manner of speaking he’d never quite shaken. “Thinking Kreacher a poor elf indeed they will.”
in her voice had sent a chill of terror down Harry’s spine. “They need to

Harry, for some reason, did not move.
Eventually, though, the break had come from finding an address repeated on forms submitted by more legitimate shops doing business with the smugglers. This address had led them to a hangar a couple of miles east of Ipswich, which had appeared as likely place as any for the smugglers to keep their stock.
The three of them had stood frozen for a moment and stared at each other in disbelief.
Malfoy froze, the rigidity of it somehow plain despite him having sat still even before. His eyes went wide, and a hint of pink spread across his cheeks.
Malfoy’s voice had been utterly devoid of any emotion, his name a simple acknowledgment on the Slytherin’s lips.
“Oh, so, what?” Malfoy asked, voice dripping with sarcasm. “You just planned to keep it a secret, did you?!”
“I’m fine,” Harry said, after a moment that had stretched just a little bit too long.
"Hey," Harry had protested, slightly offended that Ron had directed his glee at
as an aspirational figure (
year?! You nearly went round the bend, back then, and you can't deny it! That was back when he was convinced you had a
It had been smugglers again, because Robards had seemed to have gotten it into his head that was some sort of bloody specialty of theirs. They’d been too late to catch them, cracks of apparition echoing only seconds after their own, but they’d at least been close enough on their heels to force them to leave behind a lot of their goods.
Hermione had gotten a sharp glint in her eyes at this point, but Harry had entirely missed it.
Malfoy’s eyes had narrowed further.
Towards the tail end of a Friday evening spent at the Leakey, Harry and Malfoy having just finished the recounting of how they’d wrapped up the case of the smuggled unicorn calf, Hermione had said smilingly: “Imagine if your sixteen-year-old selves could have seen you now."
Malfoys eyes found his.
turned out to be a little bit hard to find? Well, lucky for them, Greyback never was clever enough to keep his mouth shut, not back when he’d been so sure that the Dark Lord would win - and certainly not once he figured out how little many of us wished to hear about his bloody
Now see Sirius and Remus adopted a little menace called Teddy when Harry was 9 years old. He was really nice at first, a metamorphmagi entertaining everyone with his 'unique' antics, until he learned to use his little mouth. Having Sirius Orion Black as your father and James Fleamont Potter is your godfather, you're bound to grow up as a menace to society. Luckily Harry had taken mostly after  his mum. But Teddy was highly impressionable, and absorbed every evil thing about his dad and godfather like a sponge. He grew up as a menace to soceity, to Remus and his mum's utter disappointment and Sirius and his Dad's utter pride and joy. He became even worse when Remus took the job as the DADA teacher at Hogwarts. Harry barely tolerated the over-hyped 8 year old as he bounced around in his room. Teddy liked to claim that he and Harry were "god" sibling, since Remus and Sirius were his godparents and his parents were Teddy's.
Ron and Hermione were....in love. That's what they were. But both of them denied it and frankly, everyone was tired of their constant bickering.
Cedric himself was the seeker of the Hufflepuff team.
In between the break between sixth and seventh year, Cedric and Cho broke up. Harry was sitting on the roof of Cedric's house. Just the two of them.
who Draco was, him being Sirius's nephew and all. They even had met a previously when Sirius hosted a Christmas party at his and Remus's house 2 years ago. Draco and Harry were polar opposites in some senses. Draco was smart, intelligent, arrogant, cocky and very judgy. He was rich and more well dressed than most grown ups Harry has ever seen. He knew more than all of them as well and was never afraid to show it. Typical pureblood filth. But being Narcissa Malfoy's child, he also had a sense of humor and quick wits. He wasnt terrible and snobby towards Ron and himself at that party and that's all Harry needed to form an acquaintance with the boy. They never talked again but they bonded over their loyalty to Puddlemore United and roasted the hell out of Ron for supporting Chudley Cannons. He was apparently friends with Fred and George for some reason.
"He is a nightmare," Neville said, horrified.
Draco grew out his hair and made it official with Daphne Greengrass, a fellow housemate and equally attractive and rich. They were a good match. A very unexpected one. But it didn't hurt Harry when he caught Pansy Parkinson almost crying and throwing up at Draco gently pecking Daphne's cheeks at the dinner table one day. Draco's hair looked amazing. Not very long but it was still brushing his shoulders and was tastefully styled. Sometimes Draco would use a ribbon or a band to hold it off his face. Girls and boys alike were found swooning and dying in corridors on those days. Ron and Hermione also got their shit together after an
Yes Cedric was indeed selected as the champion of Hogwarts for the triwizard tournament. Fred and George were stuck with horrible beards for trying to manipulate the Goblet of Fire.
Unbeknownst to the couple, everyone including Severus Snape handed Draco Malfoy 50 galleons.
"I'm alright Harry. I wish things would've been different. We weren't working out in the end."
"What's wrong? Is there something on my face?"
"Forget about that who am I gonna go with to the ball?" Harry sighed dramatically and plopped his head on Draco's shoulder.
"Draco....um...Malfoy. I'm four years old. I live at the Malfoy Manor," he blurted out swiftly.
Why the fuck would you think that?" Harry laughed.
Or so he thought.
"The best we ever had," Neville agreed.
"I'll take you up on that offer," George immediately fished out 20 galleons from his pocket and placed it in Theo's hand.
"Hm?"
He started training diligently, putting all his heart and soul into the training. He loved every second of it. For Christmas he went home. Ron apparently had a clingy girlfriend. Hermione was greener than the grass with jealousy. It looked like Draco, Ginny, Fred and Blaise were gonna win the bet on sixth year.
He has known this little fact since he was 6, ever since his dad allowed him to fly with Cedric out of town and the wind hit his hair in just the right places, making it flow flawlessly and making Harry lose his shit on his first comet 350. It took one vibrant smile from Cedric to turn his insides into goo and BAM! Harry is like super super bi. More like Cedric-sexual.
Cedric was so so proud. So fond.
Cedric has been accepted to Hogwarts on his eleventh birthday. He was showing the letter to Draco, sitting on the highest tower of some unknown manor, a little away from their hometown.
George mounted his broom and they took off, together.
Draco danced with him. Cedric savoured every moment of it. The slight but adorable height difference, the faint blush on Draco's cheek, the giggles as he twirled Draco around, he drank all of it like a lost man in a desert. Draco looked so beautiful. He had grown so well. His sharp jawline, beautiful smile, his stormy blue-gray eyes which always reminded him of the mist the first time he saw him. Cedric heart almost bursted then and there.
"Alright. I will Ron go find a date alone I'm going with Draco Malfoy," he smiled smugly and snuggled deeper into Draco. Draco put his arm around Harry affectionately. "We are gonna look so hot together,
"He is strict but he is actually a good teacher," Harry agreed with him, stealing his hot chocolate from him.
Fred and George successfully opened their joke shop after dropping out of Hogwarts, their funds being Cedric's Triwizard earnings and Draco, Theo, Blaise and Harry's personal investment. It was an instant attraction of Diagon Alley.
George looked at him sympathetically. Then did a silly pose. Cedric burst out laughing.
And Cedric? Cedric felt like something was killing him slowly. He was slow dancing with Cho, beautiful, perfect, kind Cho, and all he could think about was Draco and Harry dancing in a silly way to the romantic ballad 'Hogsmeade is colder without you', laughing without a care in the world. Harry gagged when Remus and Sirius started dancing to the song and buried himself in Draco's chest in embarrassment. Draco laughed and wrapped his arms around him, subtly high fiving Sirius. Draco never laughed at him like that. He felt like he was choking.
"Dance with me princess," Draco smirked playfully at Harry.
"You two are so weird. Do I always have to save your asses from detention?" Cedric sighed again.
He looked up at Cedric.
Cedric stopped chewing for a bit.
"You're really going."
When Cedric turned nine and they were sitting in the garden of the Diggory household, munching on some chocolate frogs together, Draco suddenly asked,
The fifth years were taking OWLs this year. Draco, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Blaise, Theo and Neville always hovered around him, asking him for advice.
Cedric said nothing. Draco wasn't dumb. He was smart, Intelligent, resourceful, beautiful, handsome, kind, patient-
"20 points from each one of your houses for staying out of curfew. 30 points from Hufflepuff for an on duty prefect being so casual and careless. Now scram to your dorms before I change my mind detentions," with that Snape left as swiftly as he had arrived. They all ran to their dorms.
"What do you think?"
They slowly crept down the hall with Cedric leading them.
The fewer people you are tied to, the less you can lose. Harry has lost far too much in his life and it often left him wondering, what if things turned out differently? What if he was sorted to Slytherin and never gained the favor of Dumbledore? What if he never met Sirius and got his hopes up about living with him and escaping the hell of a house from his childhood? What if he never made friends with Ron and Hermione...? Would he still choose to come back when Voldemort killed him? Would he still be here now in that case?
“Were you the one who administrated the antidote to Mr. Potter?” The headmaster asked, going straight to the point. Although the answer seemed obvious to Malfoy, he realized nobody else probably knew with certainty what happened yesterday.
"No, so don't move," Malfoy said, all focused. When he lifted his eyes and looked at Harry's doubtful expression, he sighed. " God, don't give me that look. Only a handful of things can make your state worse and this is not one of them. I'm injecting it." He announced right before the needle penetrated Harry's stiff skin on his forearm.
The door closed with a loud slam.
"Why does it matter? We're not in a second grade anymore, Ronald." Harry brushed him off with a tone that made it obvious he was annoyed and continued walking. He wasn't annoyed with Malfoy's pathetic attempt to get Harry's attention. It was the fact that Harry's cock gladly responded to that little skin-ship he just experienced and gave Malfoy the attention he wanted.
"Whatever. What was that about me being a celebrity? You've been stealing spotlight since the day you were born so it's really amusing to hear that from you." Draco smirked but his words weren't as hateful as usually.
Once Draco found what he was looking for, he returned to Harry's side.
This was their current relationship.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, my apologies, sleeping beauty. I'll try not to die a bit quieter next time." Harry barked out as he turned around, which caused his head to spin. He became dizzy and the world around him went blurry for a moment.
"How very nice of you." The other pointed out sourly. Harry had been waiting to be noticed and untied by the blonde boy the whole time, lying there butt-naked and dirty.
It hurt so much that despite the numbness, Harry flinched.
Malfoy wasn’t worried about Harry’s wounds nor if he administrated the correct antidote – he knew he did, he saw Potter’s hands get better before he left him.
Before Malfoy could add some ironic comment, Harry thrust in. Without any warning or prep time, it was so sudden that Malfoy's voice got caught in his throat. Harry did cast a moisturizing charm at the entrance and made sure his entering didn't hurt Malfoy... that much.
Draco stood there in silence for a moment, staring at still sleeping Potter. He imagined how Harry would act after hearing the news about his arm. Maybe he’s already heard it. Malfoy already started blaming himself for not helping Harry faster, for not realizing his alarming state sooner. He could have prevented this completely.
"It was you who wanted to meet up in the first place, Potter." Draco pointed out and reached down to Harry's belt, slowly unbuckling it. The eye contact the pair maintained was not once broken.
Their eyes met, catching Draco off guard. He was feeling sentimental which made him vulnerable and he looked away first. Normally, he wouldn't have lost in their staring contest so easily. His moment of weakness pissed him off to the point he got up and left, not giving Potter another glance.
"I mean it." He added slowly, having pure intentions of showing concern. One glance from Malfoy told him he should not have said that.
"Brilliant. Harry James Potter, that was just brilliant." Harry cursed under his breath, angry at himself but also at Malfoy.
Potter grabbed Draco by shoulders and pinned him down against the bed, grinding their hips together in the process. They looked into each other's eyes, their every breath becoming more unsteady. Harry switched his weight from palms to elbows, lowering himself to savor Draco's pink nipple, pinching and fondling the other with his fingers.
Draco yelled something else along the line 'Running away, Potter?" but Harry wasn't interested. Ron and Hermione followed after him when their best friend headed to the nearby common room.
Harry slipped out as he felt himself going soft, letting himself collapse down next to lying Malfoy.
"Shit." Harry said, more to himself than the boy lying next to him, opening his eyes slowly. He came way sooner than his usual self.
"Didn't know this was a competition," Draco replied, sitting up. He reached for his wand and cleaned himself up with a charm. He then got himself dressed, carefully masking any signs which could give away that he just had sex.
It was so unfair. The offer of help Malfoy longed for, the hand he was waiting for finally stretched out towards him… and he almost accepted it despite all that happened.
He obviously knew how unsafe it was to perform what he did yesterday. He had never treated anyone before, had no medical experience, was unsupervised and under pressure. Draco took all the responsibility on his shoulders when he decided to save Harry instead of rushing to find help. There was no guarantee Potter wouldn’t die if Draco didn’t act the way he did. He knew all that better than anyone and yet he was perceived as the irresponsible one here. Not Madam Pomfrey or the fact that nobody was present in the hospital ward when this emergency happened.
There were three simple, yet unspoken rules between them.
"Scorpion's poison mixed with dragon's blood. Touched my failed potion with bare hands." Harry explained, letting his body fall and making an impact with the hard, hospital mattress. His eyelids were too heavy to keep his eyes open.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Ron got overly-defensive, prepared to fight with the person the trio disliked.
Draco couldn't look at the other boy anymore and averted his gaze. "Not much to thank me for, plus you're not healed completely yet. Though rest can be done by Pomfrey when she comes." He said hastily and straightened himself up. "I should leave."
“Yeah, you almost killed Harry!” Weasley couldn’t keep his mouth shut after all.
The sweat from the Draco's pale chest dripped down on the slightly tanned skin underneath him. Potter's legs were tightly wrapped around the other person's torso, making sure there was not any distance between their lower parts.
“Yes, I’m aware. If you wish to report me, feel free to do so, I have nothing to say in my defense.” Draco resigned. He saw how everyone was looking at him, they already made up their minds about Malfoy. There wasn’t a need to waste his breath and argue with hot-headed Weasley or stubborn Granger.
One thing was made clear. There wasn't a place for concern in their relationship. Harry overstepped the unspoken boundary and it bit him back. The bond he had with Malfoy became thinner, and Harry realized that he should be caring if he ever wanted to chase the blonde boy away. It wasn't hatred, insults, and childish arguments that would do the job, Draco was scared of something more deep and sophisticated. Feelings of care and love. In a weird sense, Harry understood it well.
Draco wished to yell at Potter, so many sentences flooded his brain, but only a laugh escaped from his throat. Tears filled his eyes so quickly he had to leave before that idiot noticed.
Malfoy's eyes searched the room before landing on Potter and their gazes meeting for a brief moment. Draco continued to watch the other boy even after the eye contact was broken, his curiosity and interest were triggered for one simple reason.
Harry hadn't had much appetite given that he just woke up from an unpleasant dream. He was feeling out of place and failed to notice when they entered the Great Hall or sat down to their Gryffindor table. The whole evening, he didn't touch any bit of food nor engaged himself in the conversation. It was as if he was functioning only mechanically, with his mind wandering around.
(This is after the H&D fight at the first part of chapter 5.)
(Back to present after Draco saved Harry)
It had quite the opposite effect.
Draco walked past Blaise who was playing chess with some second year, so he knew he got a bit of time for himself. Once the door on his room closed, Malfoy rested his back against it and slowly slid down. He stretched his knees before bending them again and wrapping his arms around them.
"Where's Pomfrey?" Harry managed to ask, feeling weirdly out of breath. He started to feel all sweaty and heavy as if he just finished a tough quidditch match.
Seeing Potter in his near-death state left Draco more shook than he initially thought. In fact, Malfoy was still shaking when he entered the hospital ward the next day. It was pointless to try and excuse his visit with thoughts such as ‘I just want to make sure if I used the right treatment’ or ‘the bruises on my back need more attention.’ Draco knew it was worry that brought him back to check on Potter.
Draco, on the other hand, was filled with rage. Before thinking, he grabbed Potter by his sleeve and yanked him back.
Draco couldn't hide his surprise when he found a small note in his pocket the next day. He was in the Potion class with other eight years when something fell out of his robe. If Blaise didn't point it out Draco would've overlooked it.
“I detected a short-term paralysis in his left arm but Mr. Potter should regain his full control within a month. He was truly very fortunate to have you around Mr. Malfoy.” Madame Pomfrey responded to Draco’s question and nodded her head. “But what brings you here today?” She asked in return the blonde boy.
Harry thought as he put on his clothes, pondering on how he was burning up just a second ago. He left promptly, casting a masking spell on the door of the small room before heading back to his dorms.
Draco wasn't stupid enough not to understand what Potter really meant. He just chose to take it the wrong way to avoid answering unwanted questions. He seriously debated whether to meet up with the nosy boy that day but his raging hormones won over his clear judgment. Now that he realized his mistake, it was for the best of both to just quickly disappear from the scene.
When there was a long silence in the room and Draco noticed everyone was looking at him, he interpreted it that it was time to leave. He was so deep in his thoughts he didn’t hear the question Madam Pomfrey asked him.
"Paparazzi?" Draco's head titled a little in confusion upon hearing an unfamiliar word. Harry just shook his head and didn't bother to explain. Muggle things would not interest Malfoy anyway.
"What the..." Harry got cut off mid-sentence.
And despite all of this, Harry viewed himself as a victim. As if it wasn’t his free will doing the absolute most and unnecessary. The hero complex Potter had was so strong he made himself believe there was not any other choice. Defeating Voldemort was the only thing he couldn’t avoid, every other offer of help was optional from his side. Yet he made countless offers to help almost everyone.
Time went by and Harry realised Draco was weirdly so SO cool. He was taking advanced potions and alchemy and he was just a third year. Wow. Harry had a crush. Again.
Something inside Cedric burned. He pushed that feeling down.
He lived miraculously.  Charming a rock into a dog wasnt the best of the ideas but it did the job. Cedric managed to not get barbecued.
The next few days flew by and he was at platform  9¾ again boarding the train for his last year at Hogwarts.
The first thing Harry noticed after boarding the train that Ron was looking at him....very weirdly.
"Get out of my room YOU MENACE!" Harry shouted again.
"Well duh? Everyone does. It's kinda obvious isnt it? Our school's golden boy Cedric, crafted by the gods themselves," he said dramatically.
Theo dragged along Draco and Blaise on the train to meet the-boy-who-lived. Theo being the most extroverted of the bunch, immediately made friends with Harry and his two other friends, Hermione and Ron Weasley, a muggleborn witch and the son of a close colleague of his father. Draco and Harry clashed immediately. But it soon changed when they both discovered they liked Puddlemore United and started arguing with Ron on how Chudley Cannons can literally never make a comeback ever again.
They had the time of their lives at the Delacour-Weasley wedding. Bill and Fleur looked absolutely flawless. Ron danced with Hermione all night to shove it into Victor Krum's face. The couples looked so happy all around him. Draco and Harry weren't there yet. But it didn't seem too far for them.
Draco became friends with Theo and Blaise sometime during the two years Cedric was away at Hogwarts. They met through their father's connections and it was obvious the trio was meant to be friends forever. Cedric was soon introduced to them and became fond of the two. They were good friends to his little brother.
The song ended. So did their moment.
Harry also had his quidditch captain duties which were exhausting as hell. He just wanted to be an auror why was he being put through this hell he had no idea.
"Cedric I can't believe how little he values us whe you're around. I mean seriously? We are soulmates Malfoy," Theodore whined.
Harry Potter is bi.
"Cedric?"
"Everything is there Draco. You'll do fine. I will be right there with you," Cedric smiled at him. Draco immediately relaxed, smiling at him.
"Next year when you become the head boy, we will break into Dumbledore's office and steal his sweets," George had the audacity to wink at him.
And not his.
All of their problems, Cedric had the answer. In his 5th year and Draco's 3rd, Theo started a betting pool.
"What?"
Cedric sighed. Friendship with Fred and George was so unexpected. They started hovering around the group as two of their siblings were in it. Their father's being colleagues, Cedric always knew the mischievous twins. They became close in his third year when Cedric saved them from detention(they had tried to shut the crying lady in the 4th hall up with muggle duct tape which Cedric had no idea where he they even get from). Since then the twins had always hung out with him whenever they could, even forgoing curfew to accompany Cedric on his patrolling(he tried but they were Fred and George).
Hermione was going with Victor Krum, Neville with Luna, Blaise with Daphne Greengrass from Slytherin, Draco with Harry and surprisingly, Theo with Ginny. Theo and Ginny always had this weird tension around them. Looks like they were about to figure it out. Ron was going with Parvati Patil from Gryffindor. Fred and George were going with their quidditch teammates Angelina Johnston and Katie Bell.
Draco kept his promise of course. He wrote almost everyday, with Cedric looking forward to his breakfast and owls. Cedric got sorted into Huflepuff. He always thought he was a Ravenclaw with everyone saying how smart and quick witted he was. But he was also kind, selfless and hardworking. So no one was suprised when he got sorted into Hufflepuff instead. He loved his house and he loved his friends.
Oh no.
"Its because you're incompetent Neville," Draco deadpanned, taking another sip of his hot chocolate.
"You think I'm handsome?" He tried to ask him casually.
called Lavender Brown. All it took was a girl more possessive than Hermione to make her realise how possessive she herself could be.
Harry rolled his eyes but accepted nonetheless.
"Dont you have a match in a few days? The new season is coming. I cannot believe you're making me root for Applebee Arrows over Puddlemore United. Only you Ced," George chuckled.
It became a strange routine among them, Cedric and Draco flying among the mists, talking about everything and anything. Cedric has always been a natural flyer. His father often said he would swiftly make the quidditch team as a seeker. Cedric smiled bashfully and brushed him off.
Cedric knew how to handle his broom well. He himself has been flying since he was Draco's age himself.
"You're so lonely Harry," Teddy said, unfazed. What a little shit. Harry groaned covering his eyes with his pillow. "Maybe you should ask someone out. I can help you. If you want."
"I think whoever has magic should be allowed in Hogwarts," he said slowly, afraid, like he was saying it to himself rather than answering to Cedric.
Harry almost said it.
"I heard there is a ball. Are you gonna ask Chang?" Draco wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
"TEDDY ITS 8 AM ON A SUNDAY GET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM OR SO HELP ME GOD IM GONNA MAKE YOU"
"What are you doing here at this hour," the unmistakable voice of none other than Severus Snape said from down the hallway they just took a turn to.
With that Draco Malfoy took his broom, turned on his heel and took off.
"Professor! We...um...we...were just-" Cedric stammered for an appropriate answer.
"Probably. Let's see."
"Why dont you get a girlfriend Harry?"
"I...I will get over it."
Harry groaned and slapped Draco's shoulder again.
Apparently Harry had a crush on Cho and was a little sad at the turn of events.
"Then why dont you get a boyfriend?"
"Hi Draco. I'm Cedric Diggory. I'm seven. Do you want me to help you in flying?"
His pining was a part of who he was at this point. Over ten years and still,
Cedric felt nothing. He knew it was coming. George sensed what was wrong. He hugged him silently. Fred and Theo joined too. He was grateful for them.
"He is amazing shut up," Fred shoved some more pie down his throat.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a sheepish glance and handed him a single piece of parchment Harry would recognize anywhere. His 8 year old self compared Ron's freckles to smothered jam on that. Dread settled in Harry's stomach.
They were the best flyers in their year.
The next morning he woke up a little late and a little hungover. He saw Harry and Draco come into the house, chatting about how they were gonna become Aurors together. They had obviously flown together in the morning mist. Cedric's heart broke again.
"Fly with me. I need all the practice I can get," he smiled at him.
So he bid goodbye to Hogwarts for the last time, with Hagrid guiding them out in the same boats they brought them in.
"He found someone to fly with for the rest of his life Ced. You should too," George held his trembling hand. A dam broke again. Cedric sobbed against George for what it seemed like hours.
"He came to my house a few times actually. He and Sirius always bickered. But they seemed friends," Harry informed.
"I really hope I'm in Slytherin," Draco said nervously packing his bag for the seventh time for school essentials.
And the last one; no calling by their given name. Although it mainly applied to the first name there was a silent agreement that even surname was off track. The thought of having their surname called out in a wishful way only to hear it later on as a form of insult was something neither of the boys wanted.
"You must truly wish to be one when you point out my fame whenever I go. If you think being a celebrity comes with such an advantage, I'd gladly give you my status of The Chosen One." Harry's words, to both of their surprise, carried a lot of hate. Hate, not directed at Malfoy but the title mentioned in the last sentence. The way he spat out the phrase "Chosen One" was so spiteful even Draco was taken aback.
Although they did it doggy-style Malfoy more resembled a cat at that moment, having his feet curled and arms extended upfront, squeezing the blanked firmly. It was a view Harry enjoyed.
He managed to sneak into the dorms without any problems, it must have been really late because even Filch wasn't around anymore. As Harry struggled to open the main door, which was spell protected after curfew, he noticed a light coming from the common room.
Harry had no place to go after saying goodbye to the only family he had left. It wasn't like he minded not living with his uncle anymore, but crashing at Weasley's wasn't a permanent solution either. Hogwarts was the only place he felt at home, even after all the years and events that had happened. It was only natural to agree once Ronald suggested coming back for one more year.
It wasn't that he wished for glory for his doings. Half of the things he had done were for the Dark Lord, and even though it was only to assure his loyalty, nothing could wash off the blood he had on his hands. Everyone despised him even after the War until his name was cleared by the ministry, that much was agreed on when he joined the Light.
"Not everyone has the privilege of being the Chosen One. Some have to work hard to get by." Malfoy said, surprisingly with no sarcasm in his voice. Or maybe Harry was just too out of it to hear it.
His steps stopped at the bridge that stretched over the deep chasm. A small cloud of warm fog was creating around Harry's mouth as he leaned his elbows on the railing. The freezing air made his whole body tense but his mind finally seemed at peace.
"You're late," Harry stated when Draco entered the small room.
Or so Harry thought but when Malfoy turned abruptly around and faced him, he surely didn't expect it.
His laugh was still echoing in Harry's ears when he was fell asleep that night.
"I'm... mhmm, shit, cumming!!" Draco choked as he sprayed all over the sheets. Harry came almost at the same time, letting it all out inside.
"I'm getting close..." He muttered quietly. Harry wasn't very verbal when he topped and he rarely moaned.
Harry's consciousness slowly faded and he fell asleep.
Nightmares that crept to his sleep every night didn't help. Voldemort wasn't there anymore to occupy his mind, but Harry still woke up frightened sometimes with vivid flashbacks planted in his brain.
Draco was tired of this hide-and-seek game. Yes, he avoided Potter. His feelings were a mess and all his frustration was directed at Harry. Rightfully.
"Shut up." Draco breathed, faint blush flushing his cheeks. It was hard to tell if it was from the arousal or Potter's previous comment. Maybe both. "I have no desire to listen to your fantasies." He snapped and Harry's face showed surprise. They rarely talked during their acts and the submissive Malfoy usually did not strike back.
The only thing keeping him sane was his pride. Malfoys were proud, this was shaped into him since he was small. Draco learned how it came in handy in this situation, when he walked with his head up in hallways, scowling at the glares and occasional comments he got. He would still not change the decision he had made although it made him lose everything. They made their choices and Draco had done his. He wasn't The Golden Boy, he couldn't save anyone but himself. If he waited for salvation as he initially intended, it would have never come.
"Fucking winter." Malfoy cursed under his breath when he took off his shirt. He only had his elegant black pants on while Harry was still fully clothed. When he noticed how Potter watched him without moving an inch, he gave him a confused look. Malfoy hesitated before deciding not to strip completely since the other party seemed uninterested.
Several moments had passed in silence, the only sound was their breaths which slowly steadied down.
“My, who said anything about reporting you? I’m glad you realize what your actions could result in. If it weren’t for you, Mr. Potter would hardly be sleeping peacefully as we speak.” Malfoy’s gaze shot up and met McGonagall’s again. There was a small, almost barely visible smile on her lips. “You have my sincerest thanks, Mr. Malfoy. According to Madame Pomfrey here, if it weren’t for your medical knowledge and quick thinking, this world would lose another great magician.” When she said that, a sad expression flashed her face before she regained her usual stern look.
"Gosh, one doesn't need to attend Divination lessons to see it. You have it written all over your face." Draco finished fixing his appearance, looking neat and fresh as always. "Not that I care." He added after a while.
It wasn't as if he lost purpose in life, Draco just realized he simply never had one. The Mark on his forearm burned every once in a while as if it was reminding him of its existence. The bandages he used to cover it with, as to pretend it was only an unhealed wound from War, didn't help. The tingling sensation he got every time he felt a stare from another student made him want to scratch it. And he did, in his sleep. Every morning since the War ended, Draco woke up with bloody stains on his skin and clothes. The scratches weren't deep and didn't leave any scars. If anything, they only made the Mark stand out even more.
"You look horrible," Harry said as casually as possible while staring at Malfoy's pointy ribcage.
Almost everyone. Draco was, of course, an exception.
Harry knew there wouldn't be any interaction between them so he didn't bother concealing his presence any longer.
Moans that echoed between the thick, stone walls, got louder and more intense as time passed.
Harry's brain was tingling and he could feel the pressure taking over, he wasn't able to stop it anymore.
Draco rushed down the corridor as quickly as he could, hoping he won't bump into someone again. The Hufflepuff's group earlier was already enough bully dose for the day.
In the end, the highly anticipated offer of help only made him miserable, so miserable he couldn’t stand to look at Harry for a long time.
Draco gritted his teeth in anger.
Their agreement was simple, they met two times a week, on the same days, place, and time. They had done this since the beginning, thus for almost three months with no changes.
Harry sighed to himself and sat up. His back was aching when he reached out for his wand to take care of his disastrous state. He wished to leave soon as well, the more he stayed in the room alone, the colder it got.
“Yes, that is correct.” He replied shortly.
Harry's green eyes shot open, looking at the person above him with panic. Malfoy's warm hand jerked his dick steadily, almost making him cum right away. Draco smirked and mouthed two words.
When Harry realized what exactly came out of his mouth, he clicked his mouth in frustration.
"You've missed me that much?" Malfoy smirked in return, taking off his green sweater in one smooth motion.
He blamed himself for all kinds of things, one would say that the creation of the universe was also his fault.
"The Golden Boy is sneaking out late at night just to cry on his girlfriend's shoulder? Truly splendid Gryffindor behavior." Malfoy chuckled.
A sudden twist like this made Draco feel thrilled and impatient. It was not as if his life was boring but a little distraction was always welcomed.
“Is he going to be alright then? Potter I mean.” Draco asked because it seemed like the headmaster said everything she wanted. He didn’t know how to respond to her words but it made him visibly more relaxed.
"Mhm c-chloshe...[I'm close]" Harry managed to say when Draco's movement became more aggressive. He knew all the sweet spots Potter had and hit them with great accuracy. Malfoy wasn't at top of his class for nothing.
Draco shot him a glance. "Not everyone has lost purpose in their life after defeating Dark Lord. I got better things to do than hang out in here with the oh-so-famous Harry Potter." Every word was soaked in sarcasm. This was another thing Harry noticed, Malfoy's attitude was the worst after sex.
"God Potter, what did you do this time?" He said with a truly horrified expression once he realized how grave the situation was.
"Many would disagree with you about spending time with me, I'm quite wanted, you know." He pointed out with a sly smile. "What makes you think I have lost my purpose?" Harry asked, taken aback by the seriousness in his tone.
Malfoy was on his back, holding a book in one hand, the other resting behind his head and serving as a pillow. He didn't notice that someone had entered the room. His guard was lowered and he turned all his attention to the book of advanced potion brewing.
“Right.” Malfoy cleared his throat to brush off his anxiety. Being in the center of attention was not something he enjoyed. “What’s the matter?”
“Malfoy in the room is never a good thing...” Ron whispered to Hermione that shushed him before he finished the sentence but Draco still heard it.
"Ugghh." His body shivered reflexively but it didn't stop him from taking a walk.
As Draco thought about their relationship, it left him pondering on whether the weird feeling of comfort coming from Potter's hatred made him a masochist.
Harry pulled out his wand faster than Draco could notice, pressing it hard against the fair-haired boy's neck.
He didn't lose his balance completely but it made him to stumble awkwardly around before standing still again.
Draco lived under the impression of not being worthy of this help, but the moment he caught Harry’s interest and good intentions, something broke. It was as if a long-neglected child finally caught their parents’ attention.
And he still waited. Like a hopeless fool. Was it out of pure spite? There was no chance of the Golden Boy rescuing him anymore. Draco’s relationship with Harry never improved over the years, so there was no reason for Harry to save his enemy. Yet, Malfoy still waited. It made him grit his teeth at night and curse Potter beyond the grave. Cursed Harry Potter, the walking saint and living sign of hope for everyone but Draco Fucking Malfoy.
The list could go on, but professor Slughorn interrupted Harry from his thoughts.
It was a sight that bothered Harry. It bothered him to the point that when Draco undressed in front of him and revealed his thin, bruised body, he could not hold back anymore.
"Well, thanks for the compliment. Try telling that to your girlfriend, if you ever get one." Malfoy scoffed off, but his voice sounded tired. Tired in a certain way, as if talking alone was draining energy from him. It was Harry's first time hearing the other boy speak in a week and it sent shivers down his spine.
The constant pressure he felt from all sides, the unmet expectations, the stares… living in his own house felt like abuse. Draco never wanted to do things that he was required to, he never wished to become a follower of the Dark Lord. Even some of those conservative opinions he held about half-blood magicians weren’t extreme to the point he wanted to kill them. He desired the simplest things, a warm home and understanding parents but it turned out to be a privilege Draco never got.
"Geez, I'm just going back to my room, no need to act like a celebrity being chased by paparazzi." Harry put his palms up as a way of surrendering.
It was his turn to take a deep breath before replying. ‘This is what I get for trying to play a hero.’ Draco thought and rubbed the inner corners of his eyes with one hand. This situation was causing him a headache.
He started at the messy handwriting for a second longer than it was necessary before crumpling the paper in his hand.
And despite Harry's attempts, he was not careful enough. The bomb exploded.
"I never asked for this privilege," Harry responded truthfully, not knowing what else to say.
Harry’s hero has complex never reached him. Draco had to digest this for a long time before he was finally able to admit it. He, like a hopeful fool, waited for a miracle to happen. He hoped to catch the attention of the all-mighty hero, Harry Potter. He desperately wished and waited to be noticed, to be saved… until he couldn’t handle it anymore.
I was a bit skeptical about this chapter but decided to post it anyway.
I'm sorry I took SO long to update. Hope you enjoy this chapter regardless.
Harry blinked twice before backing down, letting Draco breathe steadily again. He didn't realize how much strength he used until he noticed a red mark from his wand on Malfoy's neck.
"Oh, almost forgot." Malfoy stopped himself before exiting the room. He waved his wand lazily, untying Harry's hands quickly.
Friends with benefits without the 'friends' part.
Harry didn't know how much time passed. He stared at the darkness in front of and beneath him, listened to occasional sounds that got to him from the forest and just let himself be dazed. Not thinking about anything was salvation. However, once he realized he could no longer feel his limbs, nose, or cheeks, it was time to go back.
"Continue, I was enjoying the show," Harry ordered him with a teasing smile. Draco managed to frown before walking up to him.
"Hey there." Harry nodded as he entered their bedroom. He was feeling beat after Malfoy's aggressive performance. He noted to take revenge the next time he was topping.
"Was I right? Is that what you actually think of yourself? That you are a victim? Well, that's also a way how to ease the guilt." Malfoy said hatefully.
Today, the same time and place. P.
"Mhhmm!!" The moan that escaped Harry's mouth was buried in the fabric stuffed between his teeth. His back arched up and the tears hanging at the edge of his eyes streamed down.
"If my humble look doesn't fit your tastes, I'll save you the misery of looking at me and take my leave." Draco spat out so hatefully, yet so calmly it gave Harry another chills. As swiftly as Malfoy undressed, he was fully clothed in a moment.
“Mr. Malfoy! I was about to call for you, good that you’re here.” The sharp voice of McGonagall sliced the awkward silence that caused Draco’s entry.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, but not in a way that demanded Harry to finish his sentence. It was more of a 'I'm done with you so let go' way. This was definitely not the right place, time, and person for Draco to break down. His last week was so shitty he decided to forget it. But the boy who-minds-everyone's-business-except-his was making it rather difficult.
"Are you out of your mind?!" Draco yelled and straightened himself up in distress. He rushed to the nearest medical box and rummaged through it. "You will die in ten minutes if it's left untreated!" Malfoy's urgent tone strangely calmed Harry down. It was a while since someone worried about him and only him. Not about if he's capable enough to kill Voldemort or if he can destroy all the Horcruxes.
"I said that because it seems like you may need... a bit of help," Harry said so carefully as if he was talking to a child. In fact, that's wasn't far from true, because talking to Malfoy was like handling a timing bomb. It could explode at any moment.
"Wow... thanks." Unable to stay still, Harry lifted himself up and supported his body with his elbows.
Days passed quickly, maybe too quickly in Harry's opinion. Since the tense encounter with Malfoy, they haven't spoken. Harry would move past it, but there was one thing nudging him at the back of his mind. The blonde boy looked worse every time Harry saw him. It wasn't as if he paid much attention to Malfoy, but even then he could see how much he changed over such a short period of time. What baffled him more was the fact that nobody else seemed to notice. Or maybe nobody just cared enough to notice. To notice Draco's visibly dark circles, his paler than usual complexion, his blood-shed eyes, his bruises....
Sweet, Harry thought as his tongue made an impact with the blonde boy's pale skin. Draco probably showered in the morning, giving the faint mint scent Harry could smell.
"Alright, I get it. Let me go." Malfoy resigned and let go of Harry's hand, facing his palms upwards as a sign of giving up.
"She left to fetch some mandragoras," Draco replied, watching Harry's rapidly worsening state with a frown. His hands were now all purple and so swollen he couldn't move his fingers anymore.
But even if the name was cleared, the doubt and sorrow of those he hurt, stayed. Apart from formal interactions with Blaise Zabini, Draco was left alone. Pansy was dead, Crabble and Goyle's whole families in Azkaban alongside his father. His mother was forced into exile. He long realized he did not belong to either of sides, not the one which lost, nor the one which won. Torn in the middle, torn between himself, receiving cold shoulders from everyone was tiring.
"What?" He asked under his breath, looking at his blistered, red palms. Some of the wounds were so swollen that small cuts started to appear on them, staining his already red skin with blood.
Yet he was still worried about… Potter. There were possible long-term side effects from the poison Harry touched. There was no guarantee Draco injected the antidote fast enough for no damage to be caused.
Draco’s glance first fell on the bed surrounded by the four people. Potter was lying there asleep or unconscious – Draco couldn’t tell – with a pale face. His clothes were different from yesterday and he wasn’t wearing glasses which made Harry look younger and more vulnerable.
"As if." Harry was already sitting at the only piece of furniture there was - the old bed. He watched Draco slip off his shoes and socks and neatly putting them aside.
"Got another appointment?" Harry blurted out as he found himself wondering where the blonde rushed to every time.
Just like that, without speaking another word.
“Did you see how he looked at Harry just now? That was not a face of someone with clear consciousness, I’m telling you, Hermione…”
"Done." He said a few seconds later and pressed a bit of wool on the small hole the injection left behind.
The Chosen One. The Golden Boy. The Savior. The one who shall defeat the Dark Lord.
Harry was not having the best day ever and although he vented the frustration on sex with the white-haired boy, that numb feeling afterward couldn't be soothed so easily anymore. Now that he saw Draco's day was equally shitty, he felt relieved. Nothing can lift your spirit up better than the sense of companionship that you're not the only one struggling.
Harry got up and followed his archenemy almost without thinking. He didn't intend to approach him, he made sure the distance between them was big enough not to give the other boy any weird ideas.
"Shit." Ron cursed under his breath and returned to the parchment paper on the table. Harry smiled slightly and let his eyelids cover his view. It really was his best friend's idea to come back to finish their studies and become Aurors.
"This should help." He muttered to himself, staring at a syringe filled with a golden liquid.
Draco was almost finished with his feast when the door opened and a short, slim figure sneaked in. He didn't need to be a Seer to know it was Potter. He would recognize that messy hair and lame glasses everywhere.
Deep down, Harry knew that he was not directly responsible for the deaths of people close to him. At the same time, he blamed himself for ever meeting them, because it just brought misfortune. So much misfortune it cost them their own lives. Now his only nephew was growing up without his parents. The Weasley family would never be fully together again. Dobby won't ever come to visit him occasionally.
"Potter?" Slipped out of his mouth sooner than he could stop himself. Draco was still a bit startled, his heart beating fast.
Harry ignored the other boy's call and started moving, which abruptly silenced Malfoy yet again. During those three months, he realized Draco was sort of a masochist in a twisted way.
"God, Potter! Can you quiet down for one second?" A very familiar voice was heard behind his back. One of the beds that had its curtains closed now fully exposed Malfoy's head with a death glare directed at Harry.
Harry managed to sneak through Filch that was sweeping the floor in the main hallway. He forgot his invisible cloak nor any type of coat since he left in such a hurry. The robe provided him only a little warmth and the freezing weather bit into his skin the moment he stepped outside.
Harry didn't reply as he stared at the red flames. They flickered brightly, making it almost hypnotizing to look away.
"Forget it." He muttered, more than ready to end this unfortunate encounter with Malfoy.
Everything was clear now. 'Draco Malfoy, son of Death Eaters - servants of the Dark Lord. What an evil human he was, this Draco Malfoy, only wishing to hurt others and harm the most celebrated magician of all times because that seemed like a good idea to do. There’s no way I meant to save Potter, this was actually my failed attempt to kill him. Call the press and Azkaban, we've got a case!' Draco's mind was flooded with ironic thoughts.
Not another word was spoken as they both started heading toward the dorms.
It was just a short, almost polite remark, insignificant to Harry since he was so used to saying it, but it happened. Potter’s strong complex to save everyone reached him, after all those helpless years. For the first time, he meddled in Draco’s business to help him and not investigate or framing Malfoy for something he did not do.
"Shut up." Harry rolled his eyes, this time out of annoyance. "You cheated." He pointed out, referring to the double-combo he received by the end.
Thought about ditching Potter crossed his mind as well but Malfoy was too curious to let this just slide. Curious and horny.
They made eye-contact for the first time after their fight. Malfoy's eyes were the color of a cloudy sky and Harry found himself lost for a moment. "You've just saved my life." He whispered, afraid that if he said it louder, the meaning would disappear. "Thank you."
There weren't any particular thoughts occupying his head, Harry just caught himself staring at the wall or random people around him after minutes of daydreaming. He was spacing out so much he didn't register when someone bumped into him on their way back to dorms.
"Whose idea was it to do this?" He asked Harry, though it sounded more like a statement.
It wasn't the longest they had sex, but neither commented on it this time. They were young and didn't take ages to get off.
"Oh, right." He said awkwardly, still feeling out of place. Harry grabbed the substance with his bare hands without giving it another thought and showed it to the nearby bin. "Sorry 'bout that." He muttered, frustrated that the whole class was now watching him.
"Mr. Potter, it seems like your potion is trying to escape from you." A small laugh echoed in the room when Harry looked at the strange, slimy substance crawling on the table. He had no idea how it got there.
"Concerned? Jealous? When did you debut as a comedian, Potter?" Malfoy laughed and stood up. He walked over to where Harry was standing and put a hand on his shoulder.
First one; they switch. Since there were two meetings a week, both had a one go in receiving and one in giving. Harry was afraid of their arrangement at the beginning because he was a bottom their first time. However, the second time they met for this purpose Malfoy himself acted as if Harry was top and Harry didn't miss the opportunity to lose his virginity. He didn't know if he was Draco's first and frankly, he didn't care. If nothing, Malfoy acted very experienced and appeared knowledgeable and Harry didn't wish to boost his ego even more.
It got quiet, dark, and cold. Harry was forced to get up and dress too, pondering yet again how suddenly the entire mood changed with the departure of the person he hated. Was it really hate though?
Harry wanted to stop him, he couldn't understand why he was in such a rush, but no words came out of his mouth. His eyes went wide one last time, seeing Draco's back before his vision went blank.
Draco reached up and touched the sore spot, clearing his throat slightly, pretending to be in less pain than he actually was.
"Madam Pomfrey?!" Harry yelled louder while approaching the nurses' resting room where students were not allowed.
“Are you aware of how dangerous and irresponsible that was?” McGonagall asked with eyes full of iciness. Draco had to avert his gaze.
Ron nodded slightly as a greeting, being lost in his thoughts. The essay he had due tomorrow was slowly eating his brain cells away, so he stood up from the table few moments later to stretch his sore body.
His mind was occupied with the words he had said to Potter earlier. He would've never admitted to anyone that it was based on his own struggles, not even himself.
Harry clasped the blonde boy's asscheeks, digging his nails into delicate skin, slamming Draco harder against himself.
This time, he really did slip on the stones since his body was partially frozen. His robe got wet from the snow that melted as he entered the main building. Harry couldn't care less, he was past the point his body shivered, nor felt cold.
"Sensitive as ever," Potter commented as he sat up and started working on Draco's pants, pulling them down and freeing the firm bulge that poked him just a moment ago. "Never would've thought before that your nipples were so sensitive."
"Phleashe... Imm cummhing!" He screamed and his eyes closed in ecstasy as the white liquid sprayed over Draco's hand. Harry drove his post-orgasmic wave while the blonde boy thrust in a few more times before reaching climax himself.
"Impatient, aren't we? Seems like you're the one pent up here." Harry commented with a smirk, his dominant side taking over. Malfoy's eyebrow arched up and he gifted the other boy an amused look.
"Mr. Potter...? Did you-... did you just touch it with your hands? Does it not hurt...?" Slughorn asked hesitantly and with concern, his eyebrows formed into a frown. Harry just wanted to move on with this topic, he couldn't understand why he was getting so much attention all of a sudden. But when a pain sprang up to his forearms, forcing him to look down, he finally understood.
Harry's pants came off quickly and his half-erected penis welcomed Draco. It took Malfoy one glance at the other boy's face to realize that he didn't come to play. No teasing blowjob or cupping balls was on the list at that moment, the paler boy wasn't in charge.
A laugh escaped from Malfoy's throat. It started as a small chuckle and escalated into a half-cry. With a truly amused expression, he yanked his hand from Potter's grip and left.
"How very nice of you," Harry repeated the words he said earlier that day. "I'll keep that in mind. 'night." With that, he headed upstairs to his room, not giving any more attention to the blonde boy.
It was purely physical while they continued to hate each other on a normal basis.
"Listen here," he leaned close, whispering to Harry's ear. "You can go and fuck every person you come across in the hallway and I couldn't care less."
"Fucking winter." Harry heard Draco curse again under his breath as he sat up. He noticed shivers on the back of the boy only to realize he still felt warm.
"How do you know all that?" Harry asked in a whisper, slightly opening his eyes to see the other boy.
"Why are you so concerned? Jealous that I didn't use your shoulder instead?" He asked in return in a calmer voice, with his eyes mesmerized by the flames the second time a day.
"Yeah, thanks. Ron, you still have to finish your essay. I just remembered I wanted to visit Hagrid so I'm gonna come back in a bit." Harry quickly made up an excuse and left his two friends alone.
That’s why when he took a right turn and finally appeared in front of the hospital ward, the crowd of students lurking around the main doors made him uneasy. It could only mean that the word about Potter’s clumsiness spread around – not that it was anything new. But it also meant Harry was still there and probably not in the best condition. Draco made his way through the group of younger students and entered the ward. He was not expecting four pairs of eyes to greet him the moment he closed the door behind himself.
Because that short sentence, that bloody little phrase at the end… made Draco happy. Hope that seemed to be long-lost suddenly emerged to the surface and filled him up. Malfoy wanted to despise Potter for the rest of his life, he wanted to hate that celebrated hero, because to him, Harry was only a fraud… a fake that promised salvation to everyone but those who weren’t worthy.
Second; no kissing. This was given. Blowjobs were a yes but kissing any part of the other's body was something neither of them ached to do. Kissing was a next-level intimacy the two arch-enemies didn't have.
"Okay, I guess this will hurt," Malfoy said when he finished preparing the injection. He ignored Harry's remark completely, since there wasn't enough time for their petty arguments.
One glance at Ron's hopeless expression told Harry he was still nowhere near done with this assignment. Although he felt a desire to help him out, Ron needed to be more independent. Even Hermione did not offer to lend him a hand.
But... he didn't.
to fuel their absolute bloody garbage.
don’t know!” Harry protested. “I’m sorry, okay!? I didn’t mean to tell you!”
Then he’d abruptly changed the topic. “I brought these for you.”
Malfoy had waved his weak objection away.
“Powerful locking charms on the door,” Malfoy said in response to Harry’s unasked question. “Would have taken too long. They always seem to forget about the walls being breakable, though.”
here," Harry had said, despite all that Robards had just told him, still more bewildered than upset. "He’s not an auror."
One day, he’d promised himself he’d gather enough courage to throw a bucket of water at the fire the moment he saw the slightest inkling of the headmistress’ head in the flames.
?” he’d demanded, eyes narrowed.
For a long moment, Malfoy just watched him.
somehow to see him like this, when Harry usually barely even saw him out of uniform. His eyes kept ending up at Malfoy’s exposed arms, the nape of his neck, where the shirt clung to his shoulder blades.
Harry glanced back at the bed. Malfoy’s little speech had probably been meant as encouraging, but the result of it was mostly that Harry now felt bad for inadvertently having insulted Malfoy, on top of still feeling supremely silly for having come to the Manor at all.
over a house this size? Perhaps if we collaborate? A little overkill, of course, but if we could manage it would certainly be something. … Potter? … Are you even listening to me?”
Malfoy, on his part, had kept his eyes firmly straight ahead, though the tension with which he’d done so told on the fact that this was elf-behavior even he was uncomfortable with.
Harry hardly dared breathe, but Malfoy appeared to already have fallen back asleep.
Draco Malfoy was assigned to be his partner in the early spring of 2001.
the man had roared.
Harry mostly kept shoveling food into his mouth, at a rate that would probably be considered impolite.
There was something in the uncharacteristic tone of Malfoy’s voice that made Harry aware that this was not something that they did. That it would probably be best if Harry let go. His arms seized up at the first thought of it though, a prickle of magic shooting across his skin. But, embarrassment soon won out.
Their first cases had been dead boring.
A sharp intake of breath had pulled his attention towards Malfoy before the snake could give him its answer. Harry had turned towards him with a self-satisfied smile on his face, delighted by his own ingenuity.
"But he doesn't even
“I should-“
They walked in silence and, to Harry at least, it was not a comfortable one. The urge to apologize further would not leave him, though each time he started collecting the breath to do so he realized that it would inevitably mean that he would have to offer some sort of explanation. And that, he still could not give.
A gala had been planned to be held at Hogwarts that evening. The Great Hall would be magically extended beyond even its usual generous size to accommodate witches and wizards from all over Britain. There would be too much food, and too many speeches, and too many seats standing blatantly empty. Harry had once again been invited personally by McGonagall to attend as a guest of honor. Hermione had written his speech.
“Where’s your wand?”
And Harry had opened it.
, Potter? I know you’re shit at potions, but did you really forget that that’s a thing? And if you think it’s bloody
“You act as though

The very first had involved fibbed papers for potions imports, which hadn't even had them leaving the office.
, looking for any discrepancies between the ledgers given in France and those given in England.
“This is all classified, by the way, Potter,” Robards had added, driving home the final nail in the coffin.
Six days later, and he had seen no sight of betterment. His pepperup, sold in crates of a dozen, had run out the day prior. He’d tried to simulate the effects by drinking copious amounts of generously honied tea, but the attempt had really only resulted in him having to go to the loo every five minutes.
don’t suddenly remember,” Harry had bitten out, and shoved Malfoy through the hole. With a flick of his hand, the shield burst into blinding light and a spray of shards. Another, and the dust from the demolition had been swept up and provided additional cover.
“Keep the shield up,” was all Harry had said in response, and then he began flinging hexes.
They stood beside a strip of wood painted white by moonlight in the darkened corridor. The night was utterly quiet, save the ragged sound of Harry’s breathing.
“They’re perfectly capable of being insufferable on their own, as you well know,” Hermione had insisted. “And, besides, I hardly think Malfoy is enjoying the attention, either.”
The room was a bedroom.
Draco Malfoy? How could they possibly have resisted the temptation?
“Are you actually
Malfoy and the burly wizard they’d come to admonish stood on either side on a white gate in a hedgerow, and neither of them had looked particularly pleased with the situation. Malfoy’s mouth had been a tight line, and the man had been red in the face with anger.
He woke with a start, shooting upright with his heart hammering in his chest. The green light still flashed in his memories but, in the real world, the night was still dark.
Distantly, Malfoy’s hands coming up to rest against his back registered.
He said it like an allegation, like it was Harry’s fault.
Finger by finger, Malfoy released his hold of Harry’s robes.
Harry had foregone protesting the slight in favor of finding out what Malfoy would answer.
His silence, though, was perhaps what had softened Robards enough to grant him the cruel truth:
man, either through an overabundance of fat or muscles, nor though an unprecedented early-twenties growth-spurt. It appeared, simply, that the gangliness that had clung to him ever since Harry had met him at Madame Malkin’s had finally disappeared.
“Potter, you dense motherfucker,” he said. “Of course I bloody do.”
“Master has not
Harry had stared.
Harry’s stomach immediately curled itself into knots and sank like a stone. What he feared would follow the words, though, he could not have said.
Harry didn't know what to make of Malfoys words. Didn't know whether to brace for getting yelled at, or for a gentle let down.
The look of genuine surprise on Malfoy’s face spoke of how utterly sure he’d been that Harry would decline, and Harry’s conscience gave another twang.
Malfoy was still sleeping.
For just Harry, there wasn’t much room.
Malfoy had rolled his eyes at him.
Harry had bitten his tongue, self-preservation more than restraint keeping him.
face, oh Chosen One, they’re sure to live their life free from sin. Yes, that one exactly, Potter, good job.”
Frustration was followed quickly by bewilderment, then just a quick glimmer of what might have been joy, before it descended into frustration again. “I-!
“Stop your sorry arse from taking a stunner to the face?” Malfoy had asked, hardly glancing his way as he summoned their perpetrator’s wand to his hand. “I did, yes, and will make very sure to make a mention of it in the report. Several times, perhaps.”
to parse what he was hearing.
" as he'd handed them their next case – another one that would keep them shut in their offices – and Harry’s blood had boiled.
"I love you."
Harry wanted to leave.
The rest of the department hadn't been much kindlier inclined to him.
“Yes…?” he tried, only aware that he’d been asked a question because of Malfoy’s lasting silence.
Malfoy had confirmed his suspicions by laughing at him as he’d led the way to their portkey.
“You’re always trouble,” Malfoy replied, but Harry caught a small smile before he’d turned away.
“Unless you were planning on sneaking out without my notice, in which case I’ll remind you that you promised to help me repair the wards you tore down.”
“Blood traitor!” one had hissed furiously, and the slashing hex had cut up the sleeve of Malfoy’s robe. And his arm.
Harry’s partner –
Harry and Malfoy had appeared on a wizarding side-street at around noon and when they’d stepped out into the muggle world, they’d practically stumbled right into their perpetrator. Harry had never before – nor did he feel like he was likely to ever again – experienced such a perfect example of someone being caught red-handed; right in front of them, the young wizard had stood with his wand drawn, a hex halfway past his lips.
Though there could hardly be much of a difference to the hallway outside, the utter quiet of the bedroom struck Harry. He didn’t know what to do with his arms. And suddenly he remembered again that he was only in boxers and a worn t-shirt with a hole by the hem. And that he was barefoot.
year that his parseltongue had brought to Malfoy’s mind.
He stood in the ballroom where he had wrestled with Malfoy for his wand, the remnants of the protection around the house crackling like electricity on his skin.
No, no, absolutely not, he couldn't do that. He couldn't stay here a single moment longer, not when-

Malfoy looked at him, his expression flat. “That would be best, hm?”
“We had that storm yesterday night,” Malfoy had pointed out. “People might have kept indoors. Pity that owls can’t talk, though.”
“Not something to brag about, maybe?” Harry had pointed out.
There was something biting and bitter in Malfoy’s tone, speaking of that he was already certain what sort of answer he would receive. It plucked uncomfortably at Harry’s conscience.
At the other end of the vast room, a wizard had been adhered to the wall with a sticking spell, unconscious. An extra wand stuck out of the pocket of Malfoy’s robe.
Malfoy looked at him with a tired sort of patience.
Malfoy looked at him searchingly for a moment.
Frustration had surged within Harry whenever his old nemesis’ name had shown up in the papers again – “
Malfoys hand closed around his arm like a vice and spun him around.
“Oh, calm down, Potter,” Malfoy said, voice still calm and soft and slightly raspy with sleep. “It’s not like that's news to me.”
Harry had wanted to scream at them.
He was alive.
away.
“Changed your mind already, have you?” Malfoy asked, though the attempt at humor seemed somehow a little bit wobbly.
Malfoy had laughed, but there hadn’t really been any humor in it, “they made it clear to me that my position with the aurors was contingent on the public’s approval. And that that, in turn, meant that my one and only shot at the whole thing hinged on
As Bellett owned the property he’d destroyed, Harry and Malfoy had left the two men shouting and crying at each other on the street and returned to the ministry.
“Cheers, Potter,” Malfoy had said, raising his glass to clink it against Harry’s. In his upside-down, inebriated state, however, that coordination had proved too much for him, and he’d splashed the expensive whiskey all over himself.
you didn’t mean to tell me?” Malfoy demanded. “And I don’t understand what the bloody hell you keep apologizing for?!”
“Thanks,” Harry said.
If any doubt had remained of the whole thing being nothing more than a setup, it had gone at that moment.
“Did you…?” Harry had asked, gesturing vaguely at the air in front of him.
Trying to push any and all such thoughts out of his mind before he’d gone the actual shade of a tomato, he summoned his wand with a flick of his hand. He hadn’t the heart to transfigure his old t-shirt – he’d learned the hard way that he wouldn’t ever get the fabric quite right again – but his boxers he had no sentimental attachments to. Despite textiles never having been his strong suit, he managed to coax them into being full length. It wasn’t an entire success though; the now-trousers retained a bit of their stretch and stayed a bit weirdly tight over his bum even as they draped loosely over his feet.
'...because I was worried? Because I noticed your strange wounds? Because I can no longer look at your worsening situation?'
"Save it." Malfoy backfired and slammed the door, leaving Harry alone in the room.
"Playing victim to earn sympathy won't work on me. Oh! Our celebrated hero, Harry Potter, is actually living a very pitiful life despite having everything he has ever wished for." Malfoy said as ironically as it was humanly possible.
It pissed Draco off how much he cared, but he was still more restless not knowing about Potter’s current state at all.
"Not yet. Not before I allow you to." Draco's voice was deep and the way he said the command made Harry's insides flutter. His head was numb and he barely managed to keep his eyes from rolling back. Malfoy didn't show him any mercy and grasped the other's fully erected cock tightly, to prevent him from cumming.
The dinner time came faster than Draco had anticipated. By the time he realized it, the Great Hall was almost empty, except for a bunch of Hufflepuffs quietly reading their books or holding a civil conversation. Slytherin table had two young boys sitting at the very end, far away from Draco. He sighed and sat down, comfortable with having a meal in peace and quiet. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw's tables were completely vacant. No wonder, with one of them always competing to be first and the other's inability to sit at one place for more than few minutes.
"Fuck..." Harry heard between Draco's moans which assured him that he indeed knew all the spots of the blonde boy by now. Malfoy loved to be spanked but only to a certain measure. Harry learned the hard way when he once left bruises.
"Yours." Harry replied without missing a beat and let his body fall on the soft mattress.
Draco found himself lacking closure for the past few weeks, even longing for something he had never received – hugs. He only imagined how it felt because the distant memory of his mother hugging him as a child had faded long ago. The closest skinship he got was, yet again, from Potter, but he didn't think about it that way.
‘I said that because it seems like you may need… a bit of help.’
"Nghh." Malfoy let out a muffled moan with his eyes shut tightly and the back of his palm covering his mouth.
"You're letting him off, huh?" Ron pointed out with a hint of hostility in his voice. He was always short-tempered when it came to Malfoy.
Strangely enough, this moment didn’t make Draco feel the way he thought it would. Even though it was something he imagined countless times over the years, none of the prepared responses came to Draco’s mind.
He had become a double spy, like Severus, in his fifth year and joined the Order. Seemingly fighting for one side, secretly working for the other left him split. Being the cause of people dying on either front, putting up an act, and dancing on the edge of death every day was something a fifteen-year-old wasn't made for. Though, Draco was somehow grateful to his father. If anything, he taught him to preserve, to stand proud, and don't waver. That was also why the betrayed and utterly disappointed looks on his parents' faces left him broken.
To say he had lost everyone was an exaggeration, but not so much. There was one particular person who triggered his nerves, had he done so from the beginning of the first year. Harry Potter was a reason for Draco to keep himself together. He treated him the same way regardless, the familiar hatred but not hostility he felt every time they spoke lessened Malfoy's loneliness. It was like a safe place that had never changed despite circumstances. Their relationship wasn't shifted even after they started fucking.
"Has all the fame finally kicked in and made you blind, Potter?" A familiar, piercing voice brought Harry back to reality. The blonde boy appeared in front of them, smirking widely. Harry bumped into him gently while day-dreaming.
"Pent up? Or just becoming a slut?" Malfoy smirked with no emotion displayed on his face.
"You know..." Harry said as he struggled to walk to the nearest bed, which was only three steps away, "I don't feel anything below my arms anymore." He whispered while finally sitting down.
"Fuck, you're tight." Draco muttered under his breath as he slid out. He thrust back in hard the next moment, causing the black-haired boy under him to moan some more. Harry's hands were tied together, resting above his head. Malfoy leaned in and pressed down on the joined palms to reach even deeper places of Harry's body.
The single bed creaked heavily. This part of Hogwarts was still under renovation and the old bed should have been thrown out a long time ago, yet the pair hid it well in a small, vacant room. It was only a temporary solution, but it served them well.
Only then Harry realized he didn't see Malfoy this morning during potions. Maybe that was why no spiteful comment was made about his clumsiness.
Harry smacked him again. Draco laughed again. Cedric's insides burned again.
"He and Remus have such a strange type of relationship," Ginny piped up.
"Hey," he answered numb.
"Forget the bet my life is ending one of my dads is our DADA teacher," Harry wailed chugging some more pumpkin juice.
So the friendly rivalries began.
There was also a ball. Fleur, the champion of Beauxbatons, had been quite open about how much she wanted him to ask her to the ball. So had been the other girls in his year. He already asked Cho the first thing after the ball was announced.
"Is it wrong to have muggle parents?"
"Go with me then," Draco said casually.
He watched them grow right in front of his eyes. All six of them together. Scratch that, the size only grew with time. Neville was soon accepted into their group and with the addition of Ginny in their second year, it seemed like the group was complete. Almost. Then Luna Lovegood also joined. They were like one big family. And Cedric was the tired big brother to all of them.
After a beat Draco said, "my father says so. He says only purebloods and half bloods like should be allowed in Hogwarts. That they are filthy mudbloods," the last word came out in a hushed whisper.
To no one's suprise, Draco got sorted into Slytherin. Cedric clapped loudly from his seat and gave him an encouraging smile. Draco returned it shyly and went to sit beside Blaise and Theo, also in the same house.
Cedric trembled a little. It was still a little misty.
Then came along Ron Weasley. Their mothers being acquaintances, Ron and Harry often met and became fast friends. Harry realised he was also a little Ron-sexual. His sudden realization that he can like someone other than Cedric hit him like a truck. 8 year old Harry couldn't even fathom the concept of a direct confession, let alone a relationship. So he wrote a letter. And then hid it in a box securely in his lower drawer at his desk at home. After 3 days, Harry discovered Ron supported Chudley Cannons and that was the end of Harry's crush on the red head. They became attached to hip, always always together. Sometimes he even prioritised Ron over his parents. His father was a drama queen about it but Sirius always cackled and laughed. His mum just rolled her eyes.
The sun was shining. The mist had cleared.
After brushing his teeth he himself took off flying. Tears flowed uncontrollably from his eyes, his whole body wrecked with sobs. He couldn't see. He still kept flying, wiping his tears furiously. After a few rounds George joined him.
"Yeah. I haven't asked anyone yet and I was gonna ask Luna. I dont mind taking you," he popped another jelly bean in his mouth. Harry looked serious like he pondered on the option.
Maybe he was four? Or five? Cedric couldn't tell. He was definitely younger than Cedric. He was wobbly on his broom, visibly scared but exited. Cedric could relate. He felt exactly like that when he was first flying. He slowly approached the boy.
"Hey I was eating that!"
