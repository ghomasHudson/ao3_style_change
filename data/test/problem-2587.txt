“What did I tell you? You were never a true Death Eater, Draco. You didn't have the stomach for it," I said, exasperated. I reached out my hand and caught his left arm. I slipped my fingers under his sleeve and gently touched the raised skin of his Dark Mark.
“I actually had a good time tonight, Harry. I never expected them to accept our relationship. Tonight was really fun," Draco said.
“It didn't? Then why?" I asked, still looking at the table.
I thought to myself. I reached out my hands and I began to tickle him. Harry tried not to laugh as he squirmed against the leather of the sofa. His book fell from his hands as I increased my tickling. His laughter broke through; deep belly laughs that filled the room as I continued to tickle him.
“Sorry, Alan, but I won't order a dessert. If I don't leave now, I'm liable to do something I'll regret later," Harry said. He slipped his arm around my shoulders and led me out the door. My arm was still around his waist.
“You're going to have to explain that to me Hermione. What do you mean that you've been anticipating this?" I asked.
“What does Master Harry wants fors breakfasts?" He asked, turning around to face me.
“When and how did you find out that you had it?" I asked him.
“What are you talking about? I'm in the bed next to you every night," he said, exasperated.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
We finished our breakfast in silence, with Harry occasionally rubbing my leg underneath the table. When we had eaten our fill, Mother summoned the house elves to start cleaning up and we rose from the table. I grabbed Harry's hand. Mother led us over to a massive staircase and began to climb.
“They don't believe it. Percy seems to think that everything in the Prophet is a lie," Jolene answered.
She turned to look at me, her eyebrow raised. “Just tell Mr. Hannigan that you need two of Mr. Malfoy's usual. He'll know what it means," I said.
A little reluctantly, I pulled my fingers out of him. I squirted a little more lube on my shaft, then positioned myself at his entrance. Like he had done last night, I caught one of his legs and pulled it around my waist. I slowly thrust forward, pushing through the ring of muscle. I continued pushing in until I was completely sheathed inside him. I paused, letting his body adjust to me.
“Why have you been hiding? You have never blocked me like this," she said, moving closer so she could sit on the bed.
“So I've heard."
“And how would you know about that?" Penelope asked from her place on the couch.
I looked down at the little girl in my arms, enjoying the feeling of her tiny weight. Staring down at her, I almost forgot about the other people in the room. “She's very adorable. What color are her eyes?" I asked. I shifted her weight a little bit, getting a better grip on her. I looked up at the room around me.
He released my mother and turned to face me. “You're not going to ignore me this time, are you?" I asked.
This chapter alternates between Harry's and Draco's view. It starts with Draco and goes to Harry after he leaves Draco's room.
I choked on my eggs. After quickly swallowing down some tea, I glanced back up at her. She was still looking down at her food.
“George and his Canary Creams. I guess its not a party without pranks being played," Harry said.
We sat there in an uncomfortable silence for a moment. I suddenly remembered the food at the end of my bed. “Enough of these haunting memories. I have breakfast over there." I pointed to the foot of my bed. I held out the robe that was still draped over my arm. He took it from me and swung it over his shoulders. “Bathroom is the door on the left if you need it," I said.
The medi-witch behind the desk looked up at me, her eyes immediately going to the scar on my forehead. I fought back the urge to roll my eyes. “You just go down that hallway. The Apparation room is the door at the end."
“I remember that. Look, I'm sorry. I don't know how many times I can say it. I'm sorry for everything; what happened this past week, what happened on my birthday, even though it wasn't my fault, and I'm sorry that I thought it would be okay for me to date someone else while trying to fix us."
“Yeah, I bet that if we had been friends, you could have kept me from turning to the Dark. I might have fought for the Light instead," I said.
“You're already on Top. Might as well stay there," I said, shoving the lube into his hand before pulling him down for another kiss. I slid my tongue into his mouth, exploring his mouth and re-memorizing the delicious feel of him. I wrapped my legs around his waist. I heard the bottle click open, then Draco's hand was reaching underneath me and his slick fingers were at my entrance.
“Hello Kreacher," I said, dropping my towel into the hamper just outside the bathroom door.
Ron walked over to the fireplace. He grabbed a pinch of floo powder and tossed it into the empty fireplace. “St. Mungo's." He called. He vanished in a flash of green flames.
“Well, he said that he broke up with you because you slept with...Malfoy."
I sat and watched as the candles burned down. They had started out nice and long, and now they were about halfway gone, the melted wax in white puddles on the table. I took another drink from my wine. I picked up my silverware and began to eat. I heard the sound of someone apperating into the apartment. I glanced up at the clock one more time. 8:23 p.m.
“She's very active today," I said.
I quickly pasted a smile on my lips. “Looked like you two were having fun out there. Glad to see that your both enjoying yourselves," I said when they reached us.
I felt a pang of guilt knife it's way through my heart. I had never really thought about it like that. Hermione was right; whether Draco realized it or not, he had tried to take his own life. And it was because of me; he had tried to tell me the truth about Blaise and I hadn't believed him. I had believed that he had kissed Blaise willingly because of what I had seen in Ron's head and I had left. Draco had told me that he had cut himself because the physical pain had made him forget that I left.
“Harry..."
“Prove it. Prove that you're not scared."
“It's pretty obvious that he left because of that," I answered, pointing in Draco's direction.
Sorry for the long delay. I've started work on another story, and I was dealing with a bit of writers block. I'm going to try to update more often.
“Okay, I'm gonna need help from another healer," she said. She raised her wand and a small silvery turtle easily came from her wand. With a small flick of her wrist, the turtle Patronus disappeared. After a couple more moments, the fireplace came to life once again. A man stepped through, and he was someone we all knew. Dean Thomas flicked his wand like Shawnna had, his robes now spotless.
My feet touched the ground, my cloak blowing around me from the wind and I heard the angry clucking from the chickens as they scrambled out of my way. I opened my eyes and there in front of me was the Burrow. The seven story house all lopsided and everything stood up in all its glory. I smiled and began to make my way to the door. Before I reached it, the door was flung open and I found myself staring at Bill, the eldest Weasley brother. He looked the same as the last time I saw him. The scars across his face from getting attacked by the werewolf, Fenrir Greyback. His long hair was pulled back in his usual ponytail and he still wore an earring with a snake fang hanging from his left ear.
She stuck her hand in the flames and grabbed something. She pulled. A moment later, Ron stumbled out. He rounded on Ginny in an instant. “I told you, I didn't want to come here! Why can't you mind your own business?" He screamed.
“I'm shellinging you, Marcus wwreally thought that the Wizengamot would never figre out that he was behinds  that construction company," Blaise was saying. He was laughing so hard that he couldn't hold onto his glass very well.
Hope that you enjoyed it. Next chapter will be ready as soon as possible.
“What are you doing here?" I asked her, gently removing her hands from my wrist.
“I'm not going to argue with you right now Ron," I interrupted, slipping a tie around my neck. I pointed my wand at the tie to make it tie itself. I pulled on my vest and slipped into the robes.
“Well, I did tell him I was gay back when I was sixteen. You saw that he used the Cruciatus Curse on me for it. When I visited him in Azkaban for the first time, he was insistent that I was going to marry a pureblood witch. I had to set him straight," I said, shrugging.
Without a word, I stepped forward and scooped Rose into my arms. I bounced her lightly before I began rubbing between her little shoulders. Her cries worsened, and it looked like she was having a hard time breathing. I glanced at Draco, and noticed his hand was pressed against his throat, as though he was choking on something.
I took a deep breath and slowly let it out. “Alright Narcissa, I would like to see your memories," I said.
“Can you tell me where Master Draco is?" I asked him.
Harry's grin widened. “Steve, Anton, Randy, and Carlos, this is my boyfriend, Draco Malfoy. Draco, this is Steve Evans," Steve inclined his head, “Anton Dewitt," the brunette closest to the door waved, “Randy Thomas," the other brunette smiled, "and Carlos Madole," Harry finished.
“No, last night wasn't a dream. At least, I don't think so; my body is pleasantly tender in certain spots. Does that mean you dream about me Harry?" I teased him. I couldn't stop the smile that spread across my cheeks.
“How about the truth? Why couldn't you tell me how you really felt about it?" I snapped.
Harry and Draco go on a date. Draco finds out that Harry is living at The Leaky Cauldron. He makes him an offer that Harry can't believe.
“Who?" I asked as we strolled towards the familiar building.
He turned his head to look at me. “I thought you were different, Dray. I was stupid to think that things have changed since Hogwarts," he said. With that he twisted on the spot and disapparated.
“Harry, faster. Please," Draco moaned. He began thrusting his hips up into my hand. I did as he asked and I picked up the pace. I began sliding my hand up and down his shaft faster as I thrust myself faster into his body. I felt him beginning to tense as his orgasm approached.
“I don't know, Draco. But I promise that I'm gonna help you get back with Harry," she said. She leaned across the seat and hugged me gently. I returned the hug, wondering what I was going to do now.
“Come on, Sleeping Beauty. It's time to go home," I said to him. He grumbled under his breath and slid off his chair. He stumbled, catching himself on the bar. I slid my arm around his waist to help steady him. He leaned into my embrace as I led him away from the bartop.
“Percy said you needed a new watch. And I charmed it so it tells you if your running late or early."
“Harry, can you put that thing away?" Draco asked, sounding irritated.
“Harry? Are you going somewhere?" I asked, finally finding my tongue.
“Yeah, that was the best ride so far," Ron agreed wholeheartedly.
“Don't say I'm looking well, Draco. We both know how I look."
“No, that's fine. I can find him. Thank you, Dempsey," I said, dismissing him. He disappeared in an instant.
“Sorry Harry. That's not going to happen. No one is going to leave this room until you at least look at what happened at Draco's party," Hermione said, and with a flick of her wand, bars appeared on the windows and in front of the door.
“Harry?"
~~~~~
“I knew you would never sleep with Malfoy," Ron said. He sounded relieved.
“Harry, stop beating yourself up about that. I'm still here, I'm still alive. You didn't know what that spell would do. I forgave you a long time ago," I said. I reached out my hand and placed it on his knee.
“Can I ask why, Harry?"
“Not really. But I'm willing to do it because I know you want things to kinda slow down between us. If I stay, I doubt very much that we'll be able to keep our hands off each other. Look at what just happened between us," Harry said with a small chuckle.
We stood there glaring at each other, our breathing ragged. Suddenly, Charlie turned and walked over to the hall closet. He yanked the door open and yanked his coat from the hook inside the door.
I approached the lift just as a dark-skinned medi-wizard stepped up to it. He spotted me as I approached him and held the door to the lift open. I stepped into the lift and the door shut behind me.
I fought back a blush as I remembered the last time that Harry and I had gone to the movies; we hadn't watched the movie. “So, this is a magic free day?" I asked.
Harry grinned like a fool and stepped towards the guys. He quickly embraced each of them, before I noticed the red head staring at me. His brown eyes looked up and down my body several times. “Hey, Harry. Who's this gorgeous blonde next to you?" He asked, taking a small step closer to me. I took an involuntary step closer to Harry.
“Creature blood? You mean like vampire, werewolf, veela, things like that?" Ron asked.
“Harry, how long has it been since you had a cigarette?" Mother asked him, setting her knitting aside.
Hermione suddenly raised her wand and pointed it towards Harry. “Stupefy," she said. Harry's body went limp with the stunning spell. I looked over at her. She just shrugged.
“Please, don't think I'm following you because I want to. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for them," Jolene said, jerking her thumb over her shoulder. She moved over to one of the chairs next to the fireplace and sat down. She picked up her fork and began to eat.
Before I could do anything else, the doors behind me flew open. Ron and Hermione came barging into the room, Ron's wand held in his hand. “I know you two are having relationship problems, but what did you do to him?!" He yelled, training his wand at me.
“So, does anyone want to play anymore games, or are we ready to go to our next phase?" I asked everyone.
“I said that I love you," he practically whispered.
“You know what happened at his party. I explained what happened to you and Dean when I asked if I could stay. He betrayed me and kissed Blaise. I won't stay with someone who can't be faithful," I said, shoving my glasses back on my face.
“Yes I do. The motorcycle belonged to Sirius. And Ron, you didn't see it outside, because I drove the Lamborghini."
“Oh, never mind. Let's just get these drinks made, then we can chat when we get caught up," Harry said.
“I have nothing to say to you, Charlie. Your a coward because you can't tell your family the real reason why we broke up."
I was halfway to the table, seeing Theo was about to take his turn, before I noticed the other guy that was standing at the table. He was tall and well muscled, as though he spent a lot of time lifting weights. He had chestnut colored hair that hung just past his shoulders and was tied back in a neat ponytail. But it wasn't his appearance at our table that stopped me in my tracks; it was the fact that his hand was resting on Draco's cheek. Draco laughed at something the man said, and the guy raised his hand and brushed Draco's hair away from his face, then trailed his fingers down Draco's neck. Draco blushed and tilted his head, giving the man better access.
I sat at the desk in Harry's room, watching him sleep. The comforter was completely on the floor and he was only covered by the sheet from his waist down.
Ron crawled across the floor and examined the ring that she had spit out. He picked it up gingerly. “'Mione, its your engagement ring."
Charlie laughed as he came around the corner, carrying three mugs and a glass on a tray. Draco and I each grabbed a mug of hot chocolate. Charlie set the tray down on the coffee table and picked up the glass from it. The contents of the glass was a murky green color. Charlie quickly swallowed down the strange liquid in the glass. He shuddered slightly.
“What's on your mind?"
“Unsweetened, Kyle. I'll add my own sugar."
“It's more fun to keep you in the dark until the other person gets here. That way, Hermione and I don't have to repeat ourselves," Harry said with a grin.
“Because I remembered your reaction to finding out that he was gay," Charlie's voice said from the door. Ron and I both turned to look at him. He was leaning against the door frame. “Admit it Ron, you were upset when you found out that he was gay. You even admitted that you wanted him to get back together with Ginny,"
“I'll put it around your neck later. Right now, I need to give you the second part of your gift."
“It's making me sick to know that Lucius treated Draco like that and that you couldn't take Draco away from it. However, I wish to continue. I still don't really understand why you don't want me to feel guilty over the physical damage that I'm responsible for."
“And?"
“Too many painful memories. You have to remember all those who we've lost who stayed in that house...Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, Fred. Every time I go there, I have nightmares about them. I don't think I'll ever be able to live there again."
I glanced down at the menu. “I'll have a lemonade."
“Sweetened or unsweetened?"
“If you love me, why would you hurt me this way?"
With a little difficulty, I made my way to the bar. Marko Hannigan, the tavern owner, spotted me and waved me towards the end of the bar. As I made my way down to him, I felt a dull throbbing around my right hip. I knew I wasn't hurt, which ment that someone else in the tavern was hurt. That was the only thing I didn't like about my abilities; when someone was hurt, I could feel their pain. And it wouldn't go away until I helped them out.
The door opened behind us. I glanced over my shoulder and saw Kingsley walking in. I let out a soft sigh of relief and turned my attention back to the table in front of me. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Harry reaching towards me. I slid my hand towards him on the table. He wrapped his fingers around mine and squeezed gently.
I kept my hand moving up and down his shaft, keeping perfect rhythm with each of my thrusts. Harry was moaning beneath me, his muscles tightening around me as his orgasm approached. I felt a burning sensation in my groin as my own orgasm approached.
I let out a frustrated groan and fell back against the pillows. I closed my eyes as my heart raced and I struggled to get control of my breathing. I heard the sound of fabric hitting the floor, so I assumed that Harry had stripped out of his pajamas and boxers. I felt the bed dip with his weight as he climbed back onto it. I heard the click of the bottle of lubricant as he squeezed more lube on his fingers.
“The whole thing," I replied, taking another step closer to him.
“New song?" I questioned.
“Charlie, we haven't had sex almost since your dad's birthday party. The few times I tried, you turned your back on me. How can you say that you love me when you turn your back to me?" I pointed out.
“Are you telling me that you
“Oh, fuck, Draco. Stop or this will end too soon for me." I groaned. He pulled away, rising over me without a word. He pressed his lips to mine again, his hand still between our bodies, softly stroking my length. I snapped my fingers and summoned the bottle of lubricant. It flew up from my trunk and into my outstretched hand.
Draco glanced at me over his shoulder. “You need to sign in, Harry. This floor is one where they use a lot of strong magic. Visitors must sign in, just in case something happens." He held the quill out to me.
We finished up our meals, Ron practically shoving it all in his mouth, which was what he normally did. Draco got me to finish my food by threatening to literally feed me like a little kid. The waitress brought the bill over. I glanced at the price, then put down the correct amount, leaving a couple dollars for her tip. Just as the three of us rose from the table, Ron's cellphone began to ring.
“Well, yes I want to go, but I'm a little afraid. You see, the last time I went to visit him, he got violent. If he hadn't been restrained by the Aurors, I could have been badly hurt," he said. He turned his head away from me.
“Carlos is a wizard?" I asked, surprise coloring my voice.
I pushed open the door to the Leaky Cauldron and was greeted by several heads turning in my direction. After seeing who had walked in, the patrons turned back to their drinks. I was pleased that I had rebuilt the Malfoy reputation after Father had gotten sent to prison. We had fallen from grace in the wizarding world because of our involvement with the Dark Lord. I had successfully managed to turn things around.
He began to kiss his way down my body. He ghosted his lips against each scar that marked my chest from the curse he had used back in sixth year. He then shifted his attention and kissed his way down my left arm. I gasped as he pressed his lips against the Dark Mark on my forearm. I tried to pull my arm away, but he caught my wrist. Tears sprang to my eyes as he gently traced his tongue around the Dark Mark. I had never known such tenderness associated with it.
“Sure, if you want me to," I answered.
Her pen scribbled across her pad of paper. Her eyes drifted over me once again. This time, Draco caught the look. An evil smile appeared on his lips. “Oh, Harry dear, remind me when we get home that I have to prepare the guest room," he said, squeezing my hand. He brought our hands to his mouth and pressed a kiss to my knuckles.
“Well, I guess now is as good a time as any to start letting go of our relationship, at least for now," he said. He leaned back against his pillows.
Before she could respond, Charlie called out to from the kitchen, “Food's ready."
“I hate posh clothing," he muttered at he slid his boxers up his legs.
“You mean, like you can get Harry and I back together?" I asked, feeling a small bubble of hope forming in my chest.
“Wait a minute, we don't even like each other, and yet you want me to sit down at your table. Have you gone mental Potter?" I asked. I was confused as to why he was being nice to me.
She opened her mouth, but before she could speak, I spoke up. “Not here, Pansy!"
“Oh."
This chapter will have a small section from Hermione's point of view, at the end.
“Harry, I'm sorry for everything that has been going on this past week. I honestly didn't know you would take it so hard if I was with someone else."
(See the end of the chapter for
“I honestly don't know. I'll find a place and I'll be back for my things one day." I made to leave.
I flipped open the notebook and found a blank page. I quickly jotted down a short note to Hermione, kicked off the bowling shoes, grabbed my tennis shoes and my keys and made my way out the door.
I did as he asked and slid a third finger into him slowly. He let out a breathless squeak and spread his legs open more. I hooked my fingers and thrust deeply into his hole. By the way he gasped and by the way his hands twisted into the sheet, I assumed that I had hit his prostate. I thrust my fingers into him again.
“Yeah, your going to have to give me a moment longer," I said. Draco chuckled and snagged the blanket off the back of the chair. He draped it over my lap as he stood up.
Without a word, he crossed the room over to me. He kicked off his shoes as he walked. He stepped between my knees and bent down and pressed his lips to mine in a seemingly desperate kiss. I ran my hands up his chest until I reached the top of the zipper on his coat. I pulled the zipper down and pushed the coat off his shoulders. It landed on the floor with a plop. His hands came up to hold onto my face as he deepened the kiss. I caught his arm and pulled him down to sit next to me on the bed. I broke the kiss and stood up.
I recoiled as if he had slapped me. “I would never do that. But you seem to be getting pretty defensive right now!" I yelled.
“No, go ahead and finish your sentence. What exactly happened with my father?" I asked, arching my eyebrow.
The memory swirled away quite suddenly. I glanced at Narcissa, confusion forming through my head. She shrugged. “There was more to that memory, but it wasn't relevant to what I'm trying to get you to understand. So, we'll skip ahead to the next year. You won't see much of this memory, because I was locked in the wardrobe of Draco's room. You will still hear quite a bit though." I nodded slowly as a new memory swirled into place.
“Yeah, but they've probably changed it since the last time you were here," Harry remarked, pulling the car to a stop. Hermione pulled into the spot next to him. Everyone climbed out of the vehicles.
Boy Who Lived Twice."
As Harry added a second finger inside of me, I tugged on my bonds again, desperately trying to get free so I could reach him. I gave up and let loose another moan as his fingers began scissoring apart, stretching my hole. He continued thrusting his fingers in and out, in and out in a slow pattern. He suddenly withdrew his fingers for a moment, then he thrust three back in, hooking them so that he hit my prostate. I cried out in sheer pleasure as he thrust his fingers in again. Suddenly, his fingers were gone, and he removed himself from the bed.
“Come on, Ron. Harry's your best friend. Work this out with him," Ginny said.
He pulled me down on top of him. Instead of kissing his mouth, I kissed the underside of his jaw and made my way to his neck. I bit him hard in the delicate skin between his neck and shoulder. He groaned as I sucked on the spot, running my tongue over it in a soothing gesture. I bit him a couple more times before I made my way further down his body. I kissed his belly button and dipped my tongue into it. I slipped my fingers under the waistband of his jeans and looked up at him questionably.
“Absolutely, Mr. Potter," he said. He waved his wand and the lift shot downwards. Within moments, the lift came to a halt and the door opened. I emerged from the lift into the reception area. The medi-wizard began to walk away from me, going about his job. Before he got too far away, I caught his arm. He looked down at me. “Do I know you? You seem familiar."
“I'm an Occlumens, Harry. My mind is shielded from invasion and I'd like to keep it that way."
“So what's for breakfast?" He asked.
After several tense moments, Harry's fireplace burst to life with green flames. Shawnna stepped through, and with a flick of her wand, her robes were completely cleaned. As she stepped closer to the bed, Harry's magic began to crackle around him, and within seconds, he was removed from the stunning spell Hermione had hit him with. He started thrashing harder, and he screamed again. Shawnna rushed forward flicking her wand several times. Chains appeared out of nowhere, working around Harry's body, holding him down.
“Hey, that's mine," I protested. I reached for my platter, but Harry kept it just out of my reach.
We had reached the row of lifts. “I guess I should let you go visit her," I said. I started to turn away.
“I told you not to eat two and a half orders of chili cheese fries when we had lunch," Hermione's voice said from somewhere above me.
“Fine, I'll be quiet. Are you ready now?" Ron asked.
“You sure that wasn't a display of jealousy we just witnessed?" He asked, concern creeping into his voice. He reached out and placed his hand on top of mine on the table.
I turned from the room and went back to the kitchen. I walked straight over to the door and grabbed my cloak from the hook. As I swung it over my shoulders, Charlie came into the room.
“I had to study wandless magic when I was training to be an Auror."
I walked over to the table, taking the chair next to Ron. Charlie sat across from me so he wouldn't be tempted to put his hands on me under the table, as he had done before. Ginny sat next to him. Everyone began settling into their seats. I began to ask Ginny about the Holyhead Harpies, when the chair next to me was pulled out. I looked around and saw Jolene settle in the chair . I fought back a growl of frustration as Penelope said, “See Jolene? That's the perfect spot at the table. You can see everyone." Percy nodded his agreement.
“That's a long story, Draco," he said.
“I haven't actually hated you since third year. That was when I figured out that I'm gay. You haunted my dreams a lot that year. And the years that followed.And then you kinda crushed my fantasies when you dated Cho Chang, and then again when you got with Weasley's little sister."
“Since when am I Harry to you?" He asked me.
“You want it back, then come over here and get it," he smirked.
“You can count on it," he said. He walked over to me, bent down, and pressed his lips to my cheek. He straightened up and took a step back. He twisted on the spot and was gone.
“Hi Hermione, Draco. What can I do for the two of you?" Seamus asked, jumping down from where he had been on a ladder. He looked between us before sitting down at his desk.
I let out a heavy sigh. “Draco, did it every occur to you that he told you that because it's what you wanted to hear?"
“Yes. Once we leave Diagon Alley, no magic will be allowed. I've even agreed to let Hermione use a special spell that restricts the wandless magic I can do," Harry said.
Neville directed me through the kitchen and out the back door. When I stepped into the backyard, I felt magic surround me and I wasn't surprised to see a row of Leaping Toadstools to my right. It became obvious that the backyard was under magic to hide it from Neville and Luna's Muggle neighbors.
“Well, if you see him, please let me know. We haven't seen him since Draco's birthday, and I'm worried," Hermione said. She glanced at a small door near the back of the store, then flicked her eyes back to Seamus.
When I had him up against my chest, I twisted on the spot and apparated us into his bedroom. I laid him down on his bed and gently removed his shoes. With a wave of my hand, I had stripped him down to his boxers. I lifted him up and waved my hand to pull the sheets and comforter down. I placed him back on the bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin. I leaned down and gently pressed a kiss to his forehead.
“You don't have to lie to me, Harry," I said.
“Draco, last night was one of the best nights of my life. The only regret I have about it is that I'm in a relationship with someone, and that someone isn't you," he said. I turned back to him and watched as he stood up, and pulled up his jeans and fastened them.
“I don't care where we go, as long as we go somewhere. I want to spend more time with you."
“Can I decide where we go?" I asked him.
“I have a job Harry. I can't be responsible for what goes on with the dragons. Sometimes it takes several handlers to control a single dragon. When I take a shower right away, it's usually because I smell like smoke from the dragons trying to barbecue me and my team. I would never hurt you like that!" He practically yelled. He shoved his chair back with enough force that it toppled over. He stormed out of the room.
“You know I specialize in Mind Healing, right?" He asked quietly.
Ron headed into the living room. Draco and I followed him. We entered the room and I paused in the doorway. Hermione was sitting on the couch, holding a crying baby in her arms. Ron knelt on the floor next to Hermione, his face full of worry.
I tightened my grip on him and apparated us into his bedroom. I sat him down in the chair in front of his desk. He stared at me, his green eyes glassy and out of focus. I untied the tie around his neck and placed it on his desk. I reached out again and undid the buttons along his collar. I undid the few hidden buttons on the bottom of his robes before pushing the robes from his shoulders and then pulling them off over his head. I let the robes drop to the floor. I then reached down and tugged his shirt out of his waistband.
He pulled his phone from his pocket and walked towards me. He began touching the screen of his phone, then he shoved it into my hand. My voice rose from it. “Personally, I don't care if he wants to kill himself. I'm done with him and I could care less if he decided to get married to Blaise right now. If you'll excuse me, I have other things to be doing than having this conversation."
“Why don't you two get back in line? We'll wait for you here," Harry said. He didn't really seem to be nauseous, just like the other two weren't.
“That's not true, Draco. You can be loved, even with the Dark Mark on your arm."
Harry had moved into my bedroom about a week after we had gone to visit Father in Azkaban. The Gryffindor inspired bedroom I had given him when he had moved in was now used by Ron and Hermione when they came to visit. I actually enjoyed having them around, discovering that Hermione had the same taste in books that I did. Mother enjoyed it when they brought Rose with them. She absolutely loved babies.
It was Kingsley's turn to sigh. He dragged a hand down his face, his dark skin glinting as the fire light danced over him. “Alright, alright; I'll do it, but I'm not happy about it. When do you want to go to Azkaban?"
With a lump in my throat, I dropped my hand away and turned my back to the mantle. “Charlie, I can't take any of them. The memories they bring back hurt too much." My voice was a little husky.
“I already have. Now I have to ask; do you want to continue?"
“Actually, she's doing a lot better. Still not quite ready to go home just yet, but we're getting her there," the medi-wizard answered. He set a sheet of parchment and a quill in front of Draco. He picked up the quill and quickly signed his name on the parchment.
“Yes, Master Draco?" She asked, bowing slightly.
After about a half hour, we reached the small, pale blue house. I followed Ron as he drove his car around the side of the house to the garage. Ron pulled his car into the garage and I parked in his driveway. When I turned off the engine, Draco suddenly tensed, his hands trembling as he reached for his seatbelt.
“And you are Kyle's ex, right?" Alan asked him.
We sat there in silence, just enjoying our queso dip. A sudden thought came to my mind. “Can I make you an offer then?"
“Yes, thank you, Draco."
“You might not care, but I'm pretty sure that my parents would." He replied.
I reached out and grabbed his hands. I pulled him to his feet, dragging one of his arms around my shoulders as I slipped my arm around his waist. I half dragged him, half carried him over to his bed. As we approached it, Harry snapped his fingers and the blanket and sheets pulled themselves down. “Harry, don't use your magic right now. You'll exhaust yourself more," I scolded him.
Joanna turned around and walked away. Harry waited a moment, then growled at the young man, “You didn't have to be mean about it! It probably would have been easier to just let her be our server."
“Hot chocolate," Draco and I said at the same time. All three of us, Charlie included, burst into laughter over it.
“Back off, Steve. He's mine, and I don't share," Harry answered, looping his arm around me in a possessive manor. He was still grinning, so I knew that the man was joking.
Draco tried to pull his hand away, but I wasn't having it. I wrapped my fingers around his, holding his hand on top of the table. Ron stepped up to the table and glanced down at our joined hands. He stared for a few moments, then raised his head to meet my gaze. “You've got to be kidding me right now," he said.
I smiled against his chest and tucked myself closer.
“Surprisingly, I understand Harry. This is my fault and I know that. I never should have let it get this far. I'm so sorry that I've hurt you."
I glanced over her shoulder to where Draco was still standing, still looking down at his feet. “Why did you bring him?" I asked, trying to keep the venom out of my voice. I rubbed a hand against my bare chest.
“I've heard that Healers can feel the pain of those around them. Is it true?" He asked. I nodded. “That's how you knew I was in pain, wasn't it? It wasn't because I kept shifting."
“Hermione, it was just harmless flirting," Draco said, folding his arms against his chest.
“Oh, is your mother coming for a visit? Darling, you know I don't like it when you spring surprises on me like this," I said, playing along with his ploy. Ron's face was turning red when he realized what we were doing; he was trying hard not to laugh. I turned my head to look at Draco.
He worked slowly, sucking on the head of my dick, but not going further down. He pulled his mouth away and ran his tongue gently over just the head. I groaned, and tried to thrust into his mouth. His hands tightened on my hips, keeping them down. He took me back into his mouth, a little deeper than I was before, but he still didn't take me very far into his mouth. He bobbed his head up and down, lightly sucking me.
Harry leaned closer and briefly wrapped his arms around me. I returned the hug before leaning away. Harry dropped his arms and let out a soft sigh. “I guess we should head inside and explain everything to your mother. Will she be disappointed in my decision?" He asked.
“So, you feel he's cheating on you?"
I leaned forward and hugged her. Her arms came around me and she hugged me back. We sat there for several minutes. I felt happy for the first time since my birthday. Hermione released me and sat back in her chair. “So, when are you getting out of here?" She asked.
With that, he stood up and picked up his guitar. He headed towards the house as I sat there, watching him walk away. He paused when he reached the door, then he glanced at me over his shoulder.  “I still want to hear how things go with your interview at St. Mungo's," he said, before he disappeared inside.
Draco turned his attention back to Charlie, the evil look on his face getting bigger. “You're in pain, aren't you Weasley?" He asked, sounding like he was enjoying himself.
When he reached the top of my thigh, he paused for a moment, then began kissing his way down my other leg. My erection was getting painfully tight, but Harry seemed in no hurry to get near it. Instead, he seemed to be teasing me and we both were enjoying it. He kissed his way back up my leg and across my lower stomach. Finally,
“I didn't see your motorcycle," Ron said.
“Can I get you two something?" Josie asked stepping up to the table.
We walked together, hand in hand, without saying anything. When we got to The Leaky Cauldron, I led him through the bar and straight up the two flights of stairs and down the hall to his room. Outside his door, I stopped. We turned to face each other, and I wrapped my arms around his neck as he wrapped his arms around my waist. Our lips met in a slow kiss, neither of us willing to part too quickly.
I placed my hand on the door handle. I took a breath before I pushed the door open. As I stepped outside, there was no sign of Harry in any direction. I stood there for a moment, looking in all directions. Suddenly, I felt Harry's wild magic brush against me, coming from the left. I followed the trail of his magic to find him standing on the edge of a small cliff, his magic blowing around him.
“I didn't think you would like me smoking in the Manor."
“Bill and Jason are watching her today. We asked your mum, but she's visiting your dad, Hermione's parents live in Australia, and my parents are in Romania," he answered.
“Promise?" I asked, letting my voice get husky. I shifted slightly as his fingers edged closer to the zipper on my jeans.
I made my way towards the sunroom, feeling my gut tighten with every step. I paused outside the door, catching the familiar whiff of tobacco. I pushed open the door and stepped inside, closing the door behind me. Draco looked up from the heavy book in his hands, a cigarette dangling from his lips. He took the cigarette from his mouth and flicked the ashes off the end.
“I'm tired of hiding it too, Harry. I just don't think the family would take our relationship very well, " Charlie answered.
I thought to myself.
“That's not something I want to see again," Ron said. I glanced over at him. He turned his back and placed Rose in her baby swing. He set the swing in motion to rock her to sleep.
“Still don't believe you," I said. I glanced around and noticed that the tavern was clearing out a little bit.
He raised the glass to his lips. I watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed. My heart seemed to speed up a little in my chest. He lowered the glass. “Whoa," was all he said. He slid the glass back to me. We sat there in silence for a moment as I raised the glass to my own lips. He shifted again, and I felt another brief flash of pain. I didn't say a word, and we finished our drinks in silence.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
“Why did you have to start dating him anyway?" He asked, turning around to face me.
As he slowly continued to thrust his tongue inside of me, he slowly began to work his fingers into me as well. I groaned when I felt two fingers alongside his tongue, the fingers slowly scissoring apart, stretching me open. Before long, his mouth was completely gone and only his fingers remained inside me, as Harry planted kisses along my spine. He now had three fingers in me, but it wasn't enough for me. “Harry, please," I begged.
“Huge. And it's all Ron's fault," she answered.
“I have nothing to say to him," Ron growled.
On Jolene's other side, Percy was “whispering" to her about all the things I had accomplished in my life. Sure, his voice was low-pitched, but he was still loud enough that I'm sure most of the table could still hear him. Jolene's face was getting redder, and she just stared at her food.
Draco and I made our way out the door and over to the lifts. Suddenly, he turned around and walked back to the desk. “Now what happened, Nathan?" He asked the medi-wizard behind the desk.
“Congratulations for what?" Neville asked.
“I figured that if you knew your older brother was dating your best friend, it would only upset you again. And I was kinda right," Charlie said simply.
“We had our first date the day after she was born," Draco said.
Potter looked over at me. “What do you want Malfoy? I'm just sitting here, not hurting anyone."
Before I could answer, he turned around and went over to the desk. He grabbed the jacket from the chair, then picked up a wallet and his wand from the desk. He slid the wallet into his pocket and flicked his wand at the bed. From where I was standing, I watched as the comforter straightened up as the bed made itself. As he stepped out the door, he slid the jacket over his shoulders, and tucked his wand into a pocket inside his jacket. He closed the door behind him.
Tom turned back to me. “I'll just leave you here to wait for him. I need to get back down to the bar," he said. He turned around and walked away. As I watched him walk down the stairs, the door behind me opened. I spun around and found myself sort of staring at Harry's chest. I raised my eyes to meet his.
“Draco, can I talk to you for a moment?" I asked, glancing briefly at Chase.
He started towards me. I shook my head, turned towards the door, and walked out. I walked until I got just past the apparition barrier around the Burrow. As soon as I was past it, I turned on the spot and disapparated with a small pop.
“What's that?" I asked her.
“Harry, move, please. We are both too mad right now to be civil about this."
“Harry,..."
We were halfway through our third game, and it was Draco's turn, when I decided to get us all something to eat and drink. I took everyone's Muggle identification cards that Hermione had taken them to get a couple weeks ago, got everyone's drink order, and made my way to the bar. After ordering the drinks, I ordered two large pizzas from the bowling alley's kitchen to be delivered to our table. I thanked the bartender, then I picked up the tray of drinks and headed back to the others.
He passed around a sugar bowl and a small pitcher of milk. Draco added the right amount of sugar and milk to my mug. I smiled up at him. He slipped his arm back around my shoulders.
Silence fell around us. I glanced down to find that I was still rubbing my hand over his knee. I blushed again and slowly pulled my hand away. He let out a soft sigh. “Draco, can I see your wrists?" Harry asked suddenly.
“Can I think about it?"
“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I was just wondering if you have seen Harry?" She asked.
“For one, don't know where he went. Give me a reason why I should go after him anyway. He's the one who left."
“Harry, can I talk to you?" He asked.
“No."
“How could you do this to Harry? Harry loves you! I'm gonna make sure that you can't hurt him!" He yelled, before spinning on his heel and running down the corridor.
Last night had been incredible. Harry had taken me to dinner and then to a Muggle movie theater. I didn't remember anything about the movie; we hadn't really been watching it anyway. Harry had spent most of that time kissing me like he was going to lose me at any moment. When we had gotten back to the Leaky Cauldron, I had walked him to his room like I had done every time. When we shared our usual kiss outside his door, he had pushed open the door and all but dragged me inside.
I went around the bed and crawled in behind him. He immediately rolled over and snuggled up against me, his arm draped over me and his head rested against my chest. I wrapped my arm around his shoulders and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “I love you," I whispered.
“Perfect."
Hermione released him and shoved her wand back in her pocket. Carlos rubbed his stomach for a second, before pushing away from the wall. He glared at Hermione briefly before pulling open the door and marching inside.
“That day at your house, about a week after his birthday party, " I answered honestly. I sat up slowly so I wouldn't trigger the nausea.
“No, I don't think you love me, at least, not the same way that I love you, because if you did, you wouldn't have flirted with someone else right in front of me."
Draco glanced at me with one eyebrow arched. I shook my head and he turned back to the house elf. “Whatever you make for us will be perfect, Poppy," he said. She nodded again and disappeared with a small crack.
“One of my ex-boyfriends," was all he said.
“Who all has cellphones?" Ron asked.
My wand fell from numb fingers and clattered on the floor. It felt like my heart was braking apart in my chest. I glanced between the two of them before I dropped to my knees. My anger completely evaporated; leaving behind nothing but pain. I felt tears forming in my eyes. I forced myself to look up at Charlie.
“Absolutely. If it was up to me, I'd stay here with you all day. But I can't do that. I need to talk to him about last night and hope that he'll forgive me." He picked up his shirt.
“What can I say? Our boyfriend just broke up with us," I answered myself.
“Draco?"
“Well, I completed all my training, but I never took the exam. I guess my heart just wasn't really into it." He still carried the bouquet of flowers he had made appear. I glanced up just as we stepped onto the front steps. The doors of the Manor swung wide open, and there stood Mother.
“Draco, you were raised that you were better than anyone, and yet, you were never the top student in our year. Tell me, who was the one student who was better than you in everything, except potions?" He asked. My cheeks reddened and I refused to look over at Hermione. Harry grinned. “My point exactly. You, a pureblood wizard, were beaten in every class by a Muggle-born witch. That seems to me that your not superior to anyone; we're all equal."
Pansy and Blaise were gone when I reached the booth. I sat down quickly and pulled the last of my drink to me. I raised the glass to my lips and finished it in one swallow. Josie noticed me and hurried over. “Is everything alright Mr. Malfoy? Your friends left in quite a hurry and you and Mr. Potter have been gone awhile."
“Draco? So last night wasn't a dream? I thought it might have been."
“I feel great. There's no more pain and I bet that if I looked down right now, I wouldn't even see where it was. Thank you Draco."
I smiled as I stood up, my knees protesting slightly from kneeling on the floor in front of the fireplace for so long. I stood there without moving for a moment, letting the blood travel down my legs. I finally moved and made my way back to the bed. I slid in next to him and pulled the sheet over my lap. I waved my hand and the trays levitated into the air and drifted towards us. I laughed slightly when I saw the food; scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon, toast, yogurt and fruit.
“Your name is Draco, which does mean dragon. I remember that time Ron and Hermione came to visit and you were sleeping on the sofa in the sunroom. Ron got the bright idea to tickle you. You became slightly violent when you woke," he answered. He reached out and traced the dragon's wing with his finger.
“I want to do that again," Theo exclaimed excitedly when we got off a ride called
I loaded my plate, my bowl of oatmeal, and my cup of tea onto the tray. I stood from my seat. Charlie glanced at me briefly, before quickly looking away again. I grabbed the tray and made my way to the living room.
“No, I won't say no to sex, but sex isn't the only thing that I want from you. I want to know the real you," Harry replied. He ran a hand up my back.
“Mother!" Draco said. His cheeks pinkened and he looked down at his hands.
She wrote that down as well, then turned her attention to me. She let her eyes slowly travel up and down my body, clearly not paying attention to the fact that I was still holding Draco's hand. “And what can I get for you, handsome?" She asked. I caught the double meaning behind her words.
Mother and I talked for a few more moments, then we turned back to our breakfast. At the sound of footsteps approaching, Mother and I turned towards the door. Dempsey emerged from the hall, with Harry right behind him. Dempsey disappeared, and Harry came back over to his chair and sat down.
“Well there are other spots open now. Why don't you come join us at another table?" Blaise asked.
~~~~~
“I'm just curious."
“Draco, now. I want you now," he whimpered.
“Yes, I know that. But you are certified in all aspects of healing, and I knew you and Shawnna wouldn't fawn over me as The Boy Who Lived Twice," I replied. He chuckled softly.
I had the strangest urge to kiss him; and it wasn't the first time during the night that feeling had come over me
Seamus ran his hand through his hair and looked  over at me. “I'm only going to tell you what Dean told me about it...Draco was admitted to St. Mungo's early last Sunday morning with both of his wrists badly bleeding. After examining the wounds, they discovered that the wounds were self inflicted. I don't know the whole story, but Dean overheard Mrs. Malfoy saying to a healer that Draco's boyfriend had broken up with him. Don't you see, he didn't want your relationship with him to be over. You need to talk to him."
Ron had his wand in his hand when I looked over at him. “Ron, wait. This isn't what it looks like," I said as I shoved Blaise away from me. I fell silent as Ron pointed his wand at me.
“So, are you going back?"
Once we were outside, Harry took a deep breath and seemed to calm down even more. We walked away from the restaurant in silence, his arm still around my shoulders and my arm still around his waist. He took the lead and led me to a park about a block away from the restaurant. He led me over to a bench and we sat down. I thought about what he had said in the restaurant.
“The books on the bookcase, the items on the mantle, and some clothing items that are still in the wardrobe," Charlie said just as Draco reappeared again.
He pulled away from the kiss and looked down at me, both of us panting slightly. He glanced at the lubricant bottle in my hand. A small grin formed on his face. “Well, Harry. You want to be on Top or Bottom?" He asked me.
The four of them began making their way towards us. “Smile Harry. Don't let Draco know what's really going on in your head," Hermione whispered.
“Oh come on, Draco. If you were being honest with me, and, yourself, you would have already told me about the date you went on with that guy from the bowling alley. What, are you trying to pretend it didn't happen?"
“I want to lodge a complaint about sexual harassment against Mr. Webster," Harry said

Before Harry or I could answer her, another voice was heard. “Joanna, stop stealing my tables! You've been doing that all day!" Harry stiffened at the sound of that voice.
Hermione let out a soft sigh, which brought my attention back to her. “Harry, I don't want you to feel bad about it. I understand how you feel, but you're doing what he wants and that's a good thing. Let's just put it out of our minds. Today is supposed to be a fun day."
“Yes, Malfoy, I'm gay. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost seven months now, but tonight, things got out of hand."
He didn't answer, just reached out and rubbed his hand across my back. I pulled away from him. I reached for my fallen wand and summoned the two suitcases from under the bed. With a flick of my wand, I began to pack my things.
I swallowed hard as Ron pulled up to the curb of a small, turquoise blue house. Fear was spiking its way through me as I looked at the house where Harry was staying. It had been nearly a week since we had spent the day like Muggles, and Harry had been avoiding me the whole time.
“What happened, Harry?" He asked. He stepped closer to me and placed his hands on my shoulders. In answer, I unzipped my jacket and pulled the collar of my shirt to the side, exposing Draco's hickeys that marked my neck. I was careful not to show the ones that formed a “D" on the left side of my collarbone.
“Well, technically, since the day Rose was born."
“Charlie, I can't do this. I won't go through this again."
The medi-witch looked up. “Oh, Mr. Weasley. Congratulations on the new baby. We didn't know you would return so soon. Your wife has been moved to a private room. Come with me."
“Well, after a lengthy conversation with Narcissa, Draco and I left. I had the strangest urge to ask him out, and I did."
“Got you over here, didn't it?" Harry asked innocently. He pushed my food back towards me.
Harry nodded and caught my hand in his. He gently tugged me over to the fireplace. I reached up and took a small handful of floo powder. I threw it down on the hearth. Harry and I stepped into the green flames. I wrapped my arms around him and I called out “Malfoy Manor, foyer."
This chapter contains EXPLICIT content.
I slammed into Harry when we touched down. My finger slipped from the teapot and I fell to the floor with a groan. The teapot landed on the floor next to me. I looked up. Harry and Kingsley were the only two that had managed to stay on their feet around the table that we had landed next to. Harry grinned down at me, before reaching out his hand to pull me to my feet. Kingsley used his wand to levitate the teapot onto the table. The faint glow around it showed that it was still activated.
I slowly opened my eyes, blinking at the fuzzy images around me. My mouth felt like it was full of cotton, my tongue thick and heavy. I sat up and leaned over towards my nightstand, my hand fumbling for my glasses. Finding them, I slid them onto my face. Everything became clear and I discovered a small glass of water on the nightstand. I drank the water quickly, grateful for whoever had left it there. I slowly looked around my room, before the memory of what happened the day before washed over me.
“How, Harry? Shacklebolt has to organize a portkey. You can't just apparate to Azkaban."
My blood boiled under my skin and I felt my magic trying to break out of the cage Hermione had sealed it in with her spell. Biting my cheek, I squared my shoulders and made my way to the table. “Hey everyone, I have our drinks and our pizzas will be ready soon," I said. I ignored the other man and passed the drinks around the table: Draco, Pansy and Hermione had gotten peach margaritas, Ron and Theo had gotten Miller Lite bottles, and I had gotten a Long Island.
I didn't answer. We sat there in silence, the only sound to be heard was the crackling of the fire. Charlie rubbed his hand up and down my back, offering what comfort he could.
“Nothing important."
While Harry stood over by the sofa, I made my way over to my bed. I removed my coat on the way, and with a wave of my wand, I sent it flying into my closet. I sat down on the edge of my bed and began to remove my shoes. I glanced over at Harry and found him still standing by my sofa. A strange urge to tease him like I had before came over me.
“Yeah, Father brought them back from one of his trips. I don't remember where though."
I jumped at the unexpected voice, nearly slicing my thumb in the process. I carefully set the knife down on my work bench, the herbs I was getting ready to cut for the potion I was working on momentarily forgotten as I turned to face Hermione. “Yes?" I asked, slightly irritated by the interruption.
“Young Master Malfoy. Haven't seen you since the last time you visited your father. You seem to be well," Shacklebolt said.
“Can we put all this behind us? I don't want to lose my best friend over something like this," I said timidly.
I turned around and fell into step beside him. He looked at me, but didn't say anything about me walking next to him. “So, what started Narcissa's nightmares?" I asked him. He looked shocked, though whether it was because of my question, or my use of his mother's name, I didn't know.
“Actually, I'm not sure. I had a job, but I haven't heard from my boss lately."
“I wanted to, but I never could bring it up. There were so many opportunities, I just could never say it."
“You fought for the Light in the end, Draco. That's what counts in my opinion," he said. He gave my fingers one last squeeze, before he released my hand. I stood up from his bed and took a step back.
“Come on, luv. You know mum won't be happy with us if we're late," Charlie said when we finally broke apart. Our breathing was slightly ragged. He reached out his hand towards the nightstand and grabbed my glasses. He handed them to me, before placing another kiss to my lips. “Come on, up" he said. I pouted, but pulled myself away from him and pushed my glasses onto my face. I slid off the bed and stepped over to the bureau to grab some clothes.
“You have been taking tables in my section all day. I know you want to make money, but so do I. I don't want to report you again."
“Oh, I was just thinking of something."
Hermione released a sharp breath through her teeth. “Yeah. Let's go see what Seamus can tell us about Harry," she said. She made her way over to the same Chevy Impala that Ron had drove the first day he found out Harry and I were together. I hadn't recognized it when she had picked me up at St. Mungo's.
“Well, Harry's told us before that his father was an unregistered Animagus. Does that count?" Hermione asked.
The young man looked up. “I got into an argument with Naomi and she stabbed me with a quill."
“What the Hell was that about?" I asked, coming to a halt about ten feet from him. I folded my arms across my chest. Blaise didn't answer, or acknowledge my presence. He just continued staring out the open doors.
I emerged from the fireplace into a small, slightly dark room. A medi-wizard came over to me. He looked me over to make sure that I hadn't gotten hurt from the fireplace, then with a flick of his wand, the ash and soot were completely cleaned from my robes. He motioned me to the door on the other side of the room. I left through the door and found Ron waiting on the other side.
I took a deep breath, before I placed my left hand on his hip. He gasped at the flash of pain my touch brought, but he didn't pull away. I closed my eyes. I concentrated on my magical core and channeled all my energy through the palm of my hand that was on Harry's hip.
“Fuck, Draco! This feels so damn good!" He shouted.
“What do you want me to say, Father?" I asked him.
He glanced down at me. “Well, let me put it this way. The more powerful a witch or wizard is, the easier it is to do magic without a wand. My power is a lot greater than it used to be, and the more wandless magic I use, the stronger I become. Let me demonstrate," he said. He raised his free hand and waved it at the hedge to the left. Flowers erupted in a small section of the hedge. Harry waved his hand again and the flowers flew into his hand in a neat bouquet.
He arched one eyebrow, but he didn't answer. I sighed. “Look, Draco, I just want to talk."
He dropped his arms from around my neck. He waved his wand again and the lift began to move again. He gently stepped out of my embrace. I stared at him, my heart pounding against my ribs. “You..you.. ah hell, do you want to go to lunch sometime?" I stammered.
“Narcissa, if Lucius was abusive to Draco, why didn't you ever take him and leave?" I asked, turning to look at her.
“What he wanted to hear; that I'd be okay with it. I don't know if I'll be able to handle it though. I don't know if I'll be able to handle watching him be happy with someone besides me. I think I'm in love with him."
I chuckled. “Well, you don't have to worry about my mother. Ever since Father got sent to Azkaban, Mother hardly ever leaves her room. As for the other question, there are spells around the Manor."
“Do you think he can forgive me?"
Once in the kitchen, the three of us pulled out our wands and set to work. George waved his wand and the cutlery began to wash itself. I waved my wand and the plates and bowls were scoured clean and began to fly into the cupboards. Mrs. Weasley waved her wand. The pans were cleaned, the frying pans disappearing under the sink and the oatmeal pot flying onto the fridge.
That seemed to break the tension around the table. Suddenly Pansy burst out laughing and I couldn't help but join in. It was like all of us, including Harry, had been friends forever. As we dug into the nachos, we all couldn't help but laugh at the way the cheese clung to the chips. As we ate, Josie was constantly bringing fresh drinks when they were needed; although, Harry and I weren't drinking ours as fast as the other two were.
“Dean sent it to me, about two days after you moved back in. Apparently he was recording the conversation since he came down the stairs that day. So why should I believe you when you say you would never want me to die?"
I shook my head, trying to clear those thoughts out, but with no such luck. Another glance at the clock; 8:01 p.m. I took a bigger gulp from my wine. I pulled my glasses off my face and cleaned them with the bottom of my shirt. I put them back on my face.
Draco chuckled. “Yeah, we did promise to tell you when Hermione was around," he said.
“Me? What about you? I mean we were all at your wedding," I said as we stepped into the warm kitchen. I was greeted by several voices calling out a hello as I pulled my cloak from my shoulders and hung it on the hook by the door.
“Just the two of you, Harry?" Lisa asked, grabbing two menus off the podium.
Harry's temper must have spiked; the was a surge of magic through the room and a large crack appeared down the middle of the two-way mirror in front of us. We all jumped, but leaned forward to continue to pay attention. Harry was on his feet, his robes billowing around him and his hair standing up on end, as though a strong wind was blowing through the room.
I felt Harry smile, before he took one of my balls into his mouth. I groaned softly and arched upwards. Harry kept at it for some time, going back and forth between my balls. Suddenly, his hands were on my hips, and he was rolling me onto my stomach. When he got me in the position he wanted, he pulled me up until I was on my knees on the bed, with my arse up in the air, and my head pillowed on my arms. Before I could question him, I felt his magic as he cast a silent cleansing charm on my arse. My body tingled with expectation.
“In here Charlie," I called.
“How often would you come to see me?"
“Yes, I'm well, thank you for asking. By the way, call me Kingsley. Now are we all ready? It's just about time," he said glancing around the room.
“Sometimes he was much worse, as you'll find out. Sometimes his abuse to Draco would be verbal, sometimes physical, sometimes both," Narcissa replied. As the new memory swirled around us, another thought came to my mind.
With a sigh, Ron lowered the menu. “Hermione told me that as long as you're happy, we should be happy for you, no matter your choice."
“How many people are trying out for the team?" I asked, taking a bite out of a piece of bacon.
“Oh, that's okay Harry. I really wasn't sure if you would want them or not, so I thought I'd give you that option."
“Come on, get up," I said tugging on the sheet again.
Without a word, Kyle turned away and walked in the direction of the kitchen. He disappeared around a corner. Alan watched him for a moment, then turned back to Harry and I. “Harry, I apologize for Kyle's behavior. Allow me to take care of your bill. Please, feel free to order a dessert."
I picked up both mugs and moved over to the table just as Charlie emerged from the bedroom. I glanced at him, taking in the faded blue jeans that hugged his muscular legs and the black t-shirt that was stretched across his chest. I also noticed the dragon hide boots on his feet. Without a word, he walked over to the table and took his mug before sitting down across the small table.
“Harry, please don't tease me," I gasped out.
I thought.
I nodded. Draco rubbed his hand briefly against my thigh once more, then he placed his hand back on the table, before he could get us in trouble. He reached for his glass of water. A lock of his blonde hair fell across his cheek. I reached over and brushed it behind his ear with my fingers.
“To be honest Harry, I'm not sure that Percy actually believes that you are gay. When I was at the Ministry the other day because of the new dragon regulations that I needed to discuss with Kingsley, I walked past Percy's office and I overheard him talking to Penelope as she was getting ready to leave. Apparently, they are bringing Penelope's sister with them to Dad's party." He took a large gulp of his tea.
Almost two hours later, the wards triggered, telling Mother and I that someone had left the Manor grounds. I took a deep breath and willed myself not to cry, knowing that Harry was gone.
The old forgotten scars across my chest ached with the memory of that day so long ago...I had been crying in a bathroom at Hogwarts, expressing to the female ghost by my side my fears about my father and about the task that Voldemort had given me. Harry had come in. He had been so determined that year to find out what I was up to. We had thrown curses at each other. He had hit me with one that had spilt my torso as easily as if someone had taken a knife to my skin.
He took a few deep breaths, apparently trying to calm down. “Are you that insecure about our relationship? Do you have that little faith in me? I know you told me that Ernie cheated on you; is that really what you think I would do?" He asked. He sounded close to tears. I looked at him and there were in fact tears in his eyes.
“Just a minute," Harry's voice called back.
I nodded my head and held out my hand. He took my hand and led me out the door. His grip tightened on my hand as we made our way down the hall and descended the stairs. He pulled me along behind him as he stepped up to the bar top. Tom looked up at him. “Ready to leave Mr. Potter?" He asked.
“We can take things slow, but that doesn't mean we can't be together. Look, I'm not going to move back into the Manor just yet, but we can still go out on dates, and on the dates, we can actually get to know each other."
“You did tell him that I was coming with you, right?" I asked.
(Personal note:) Having a little fun with this chapter. I'm gonna use an actual restaurant for their date. Now I don't know if there really is a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant in London, but I work at one and think it will be funny, because then I know what type of food they'll be eating. Hope you enjoy it.
Harry finally turned to look at me. “No. He was always asking me to do magic for him. One day, he got mad because I could preform magic and he couldn't."
“Every night. Sometimes, I would end up there until dawn."
I jerked awake at the sound of my full name. My hand automatically went for my wand before the voice registered in my head.
“Great idea, mate. Come on, Theo," Ron said. The pair of them ran off towards the end of the line of people waiting to get on the ride.
A few hours later, I awoke wrapped in Harry's arms, with my head pillowed on his chest. When I lifted my head, I found Harry's eyes were open. I grinned. “Watching me sleep, Harry?" I asked.
“I don't want to hear his lies. I think by kissing another guy, it's obvious that he wanted our relationship to end."
Kyle nodded and walked away. I turned my attention back to my menu. “So, what would you recommend for me, Harry?" I asked.
“Well, get used to it. You are my boyfriend now. I mean, we've slept together, I've taken you on a date and plan to take you out more."
in my bed, his legs draped over the side, feet planted on the floor. I couldn't believe this was really happening; but I had fantasized about it back when we were in Hogwarts. Now my fantasies could come true. I began placing kisses up his thigh.
“Like you really care about that. You're just worried that I might have harmed one of your precious Aurors," Father growled softly. He turned his attention back to me. “So, it isn't enough for you to embarrass me to the wizarding world by being gay. Now you're involving yourself with the
Hermione glanced at Harry, then stuck her tongue out like a little kid. Harry laughed. “So, now can you tell us what we're doing today?" Pansy asked.
“I've wanted to come back since the moment I left. My stubborn Gryffindor pride wouldn't let me. I believed that you had betrayed me and I couldn't force myself to face you. Will your mother be okay with me coming back?" I asked, a small sliver of fear crawling along my spine.
~~~~~
For one brief moment, I actually considered pushing him away and stopping what I really wanted to do. Then I curled my fingers into his t-shirt and pulled him closer to me. He groaned again as I pressed our lips back together. I slid my tongue against his lips, and he opened his mouth, quickly sliding his tongue against mine. Harry slid his hands lower, sliding them down over my arse cheeks and squeezing. He tightened his grip and actually lifted me off the floor. I instinctively wrapped my legs around his waist and slid my arms around his neck, burying my fingers in his hair.
He propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at me. He reached out his hand and brushed my hair away from my face. “What's on your mind?" He asked.
“Well, did you not notice how they were both looking at you, Harry? I noticed Bill would glance at you for a moment, shake his head, and then look around the table. Charlie was staring at you quite a bit. He would look away when he noticed me watching." Jolene smiled before taking another bite of her food.
“H-Harry, please," I choked out.
I leaned over the sink and let my tears fall. I cried for several moments, letting out all the pain that Blaise had caused. When I finally raised my head and looked at my reflection, it was worse than before; My eyes were red and now puffy, my cheeks were blotchy, flushed, and streaked with tears. My nose was red and dripping with snot. Hating the image in the mirror, I took a step back and raised my wand. “
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
“I don't think so. Hermione was able to teach Ron," I said, just as the bell tinkled above the door as someone entered the cafe. I turned my head in that direction, and saw Ron's tall, gangly form stroll through the door. His eyes passed over the crowd, landing on me for a moment, before he noticed who was sitting with me. He frowned, then made his way towards us.
“Oh, God, Draco. Fuck, that feels good," Harry moaned. I began to move my hand slowly up and down his shaft, as I took him a little deeper into my mouth. He tangled his fingers through my hair, thrusting up his hips.
“Well, too bad. I'm riding in Harry's car," I said, sticking my nose in the air.
“Yes, she's coming to visit. She should be there around five."
“Tracy isn't coming. Her son is sick," Peter said.
“What's going on here?" A voice asked. I turned my head and saw a man standing there. He was tall and well muscled. His name tag said Alan, and the word manager was underneath it.
I glanced around as I stepped into the house. “Where is he?" I asked tentatively.
I turned my head in the direction of Hermione's voice, seeing her waving at Pansy and I from where she was sitting at a picnic table outside of Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour with Ron and Harry. I nudged Pansy's shoulder, and steered her in the direction of the three Gryffindors. Harry looked up from his phone when Pansy and I reached the end of the table.
I reached out and touched the teapot on the crack in the porcelain. Harry's finger hooked over the rim of the teapot, just above mine. Everyone else placed their fingers on the teapot. We stood there waiting for a moment. Suddenly, the teapot began to glow with a blue light. I felt like a hook had caught me behind my navel and pulled. My feet left the floor, my finger glued to the teapot.
Before I could answer, a loud, painful scream ripped through the air. My cigarette fell from my fingers at the sound. “HARRY!!!" Ron bellowed.
I suddenly thought to myself. I shook my head and brought my mind back to the conversation around the table.
“What do you need that for?" I asked my eyes locked on the wand.
“Yeah, Marko's my uncle." She smiled at us before turning and walking away.
Tom opened the door and bowed to someone before he turned and walked away. “Honestly, Harry. Your not ready yet?" Ron asked, as he walked into my room.
“Draco is NOT a Death Eater! Unlike you, he couldn't do Voldemort's wishes; it made him sick to his stomach! I won't tolerate hearing another word about him like that, especially from you! You're his Fucking Father!" Harry yelled. He took a deep breath, trying to control his rising temper.
“Of course," Lisa said. She began to walk away. Harry and I followed her. She led us to a booth over by the windows. Harry slid in on one side and I slid in on the other. Lisa placed the menus on the table, said something about the specials, then said that our server would be with us shortly.
Once we were seated, I gestured at Dean to speak. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Okay, what I'm going to say is probably going to sound crazy. First, I need to know if any of you know if Harry has any sort of creature blood in his body," he said, looking around at us.
“Because, I didn't get it until after you had moved out."
“Exactly. And right now, I'm happy with Draco. We haven't been together for long, but I'm incredibly happy right now."
“I didn't mean to hurt you. I would never want you to die because of me. I didn't even like people dying during the war because they chose to fight by my side," I said, taking another drag on my cigarette.
I nodded and led Draco through the bar. Once out the back door of the bar, I practically had to drag him to the car. He slumped in my arms, trying to shuffle forward to get to the car. Thankfully, I made it to the car without him falling over. I pulled open the door and pushed him into the seat. I snapped my fingers and his legs pulled themselves up into the car. With another snap of my fingers, his seatbelt fastened itself.
“So, what does that have to do with today?" Theo asked.
“You must be out of your mind! Spending the day like Muggles? What good is that?"
“That was beautiful Harry," I said when he finished.
“How do you know that? We were enemies back then," I said.
“Harry, are you serious? My wrists are what caused your problem yesterday."
I laughed and returned his embrace. Charlie smiled, before calling out to Ginny that Ron and I were friends again. We headed back into the living room. Charlie made hot chocolate for all of us and Ron and I began to play Wizards Chess. After a spectacular loss on my part, Ginny challenged Ron to a game. Charlie and I sat on the couch and watched them. I smiled to myself, glad that Ron was talking to me again.
“Good morning, Harry. Is that what you were talking about the other day?" I asked.
“Well, not entirely magic free," Hermione said, holding up a small beaded bag.
“After what I saw today, I just want to go to Azkaban and kill him for how he treated you," he growled under his breath.
I turned to face Marcus. He was leaning against the bathroom door as if he didn't have a care in the world. “Then speak, Flint. You answer my questions. Just remember, I'm the one with a wand in my hand."
