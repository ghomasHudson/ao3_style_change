"I always wanted you," Draco said after another silence. "Even back at Hogwarts. And I thought I was going mad - I couldn't tell anyone and even if I had, no one would have ever believed me or said, said anything that would've helped. You least of all people. Or that's what I thought, anyway. So I never tried anything, other than to make you notice me."
“Why do you care so much what happens to me, anyway?” He then muttered and didn’t really know where to look.
Narcissa's tears start falling again. She can't accept it, she knows this much already. And Draco must know it too, because there is little hopefulness in his words about visiting and welcoming.
Draco, who seemed surprisingly unbothered by the situation once he had gotten over the initial shock of waking up to his old Defence Against the Dark Arts professor barging into the room (perhaps because he didn't know Remus personally), was sitting up with admirable posture, Harry's lended jumper loosely draping over his form. Neither Draco or Harry had remembered to hang up Draco's soaked hoodie for the night, so by the time they had rushed to get dressed, it had still been damp from the rain that had poured down the previous evening. In Harry's opinion Draco looked very good in his jumper, and not only because it had the Gryffindor lion embroidered on it, which provided for delicious contrast when taking in account the circumstances; but it also felt strangely satisfactory to see Draco in his clothes, as if what was Draco and what was Harry had been fraying at the edges, dissolving into something much more exciting than what they were separately.
Potter’s voice had an unfamiliar tone that caused a strange burning in Draco’s stomach.
"Isn't… Wasn't Tonks' mother Draco's mother's sister?" Aware of how incoherent he sounded, Harry tried again. "What I meant is-"
"Yeah. That it wasn't a car accident after all. Obviously the nutter's finally gone off the deep end. No wonder really when you think of his background. Used to be a Death Eater, did you know that?"
“I wasn’t fucking him.”
doing at Hogwarts?”
“You know what I mean. After what he did during…”
“Don’t look so grim," Hermione said. “If it’s more drama you were expecting, I can assure you it will come if you and Draco keep this up.”
“I wasn’t going to say it was all okay," Harry said. “You’re probably right. A lot of things in my life would have been a lot easier if I hadn’t spent so much time obsessing over you.”
appeared on Draco's palm, and catching Harry just a little off-guard, Draco slicked it down Harry's now aching erection.
Harry skipped down the stairs and into the courtyard, but Malfoy wasn't there. Harry turned around, preparing to climb back to the seventh floor when he saw Malfoy coming down the stairs. He was wearing slacks and a green jumper with a white collar peeking out of the neckline, and was drinking something out of a black thermos mug. Pansy Parkinson followed him all the way down before stopping at the last step.
“Can you call me Harry? I rather liked that.”
“You're quite right,” Harry said. “I hope you are well, or as well as the circumstances would allow you to be.”
“What happened with you and Pansy after the whole ordeal anyway?”
Harry remembered how relieved Ron had been when Dean had once said to him it was pretty obvious he was straight.
“But he isn’t being mean to you, right?”
also just call me Harry.”
“There,” Harry said and patted Draco’s thigh, “all better.”
Harry shadowed Malfoy all the way to the third floor. He saw the blonde head straight into the Alchemy Lab. Harry frowned. Lessons were over for the day. What business could Malfoy have in there?
he wasn't. He told me later he was scared shitless when I kissed him."
Malfoy gave an unamused laugh.
"You'll get there," Hermione said. "Besides, we can split the job. I can make half of them."
“Yes, well... We’ll see,” Harry said. “Did you notice anyone suspicious in the people who were here at the time of the murder?”
They arrived to a Muggle coffee shop that looked like it was open 24 hours a day. Draco held open the door for Harry as they went in.
“No.”
"It isn't." Draco's face remained neutral and Harry was grateful for it, because at that moment, at least privately Harry was a blushing mess of restlessness and fidgeting. He couldn't quite put a finger on why he was at a loss for words all of a sudden - that sort of thing didn't happen to him often.
“Yeah, and?” Harry said, his temper riling up, challenging Ron to say what he was thinking.
“And the body?”
Harry glanced down. His hand was next to Draco's hand on the bed. They were almost touching.
Draco’s mouth opened in a disbelieving laugh.
“Ask me out? What do you mean?”
Remus' expression changed somehow. No longer just curious or concerned, he said:
“Is that a-”
“Sorry to disappoint,” Draco said. “Are you the Potions Master?”
"You're Teddy's favourite godfather, so it's no wonder he wanted to match you," Tonks had said.
Draco walks up to her.
“It’s not," Hermione said. “It’s like - you know all those famous historical figures who were queer?”
Draco shrugged.
“My, uh… Aunt’s family. Muggles. Rather not talk about them.”
son. "Will you come home? Your father is willing to forgive everything if you'd just-"
“Amortentia? And who… what gave you that idea?” Draco couldn’t help but feel a little betrayed that Harry had told her.
"You should've seen his face," Seamus wheezed, "I think he really thought, for a second he really thought…"
read about it? Which one of us is the alchemist again?”
“I mean… You
Harry was going to ignore Theodore, but then he said:
Draco stared at the neat handwriting. He looked up at Granger.
Perhaps that was why it felt so impossible for Draco to leave without a single book. In the end, he chose a worn-down copy of Flowers for Algernon, which Draco had enchanted to also contain some Murakami short stories and a collection of cheap crime novels. He would have called the latter a guilty pleasure if he hadn’t decided to discontinue feeling guilty for trivial things a few years back. It had been a champagne-drunk pact he had made with Hermione, and secretly he had kept it.
doesn't-"
“Well what - why were you…”
Granger looked like she was thinking. It didn’t look the same as when Harry was thinking - he looked like he was leafing through folders in his memory, one page at a time, squinting as he got closer to the right one. But Granger, she looked like she had a few libraries in there instead of a single file cabinet.
“Man, you're making this really difficult for me.”
“I’ll tell you what happened," Potter said, “calm down. It’s okay.”
“Yeah," he forced out. “It’s, honestly… I don’t know if I’ll pass.”
Draco hadn't even finished shifting his weight from one foot to the other before Harry had captured him in a sudden hug.
"You write letters to Dean?"
“Well? Let’s hear it.”
There was nowhere Harry could escape when Draco crawled closer to him, sniffing the air like a hound who was trying to locate a rabbit in the thicket.
“Did I?” Draco said. He was staring at the air in front of him and looked somehow confused.
aunt."
I do something?”
Remus nodded towards where Harry was sitting. "And this… I assume this, what I walked in on, is… Not just a particularly close friendship?"
"Surprised?" Draco gave a smile. "More like scared shitless."
"Do you think I'm going to let the influence of your mother ruin another child's potential?" Grandmother Yana laughed. "Foolish boy. I'm leaving everything to my other son. He will return home soon."
Before Draco could finish stuttering, Mrs. Weasley’s expression changed, and she squeezed both Harry and Draco by the shoulder. She started guiding them into the house and smiled so that it became visible where the happy wrinkles around her eyes had come from.
Harry looked at Hermione and felt the tears start rolling down his cheeks again.
Draco didn’t answer. He glanced at Harry, carefully wrote a new date on top of the old one and put the notebook back in the drawer.
Harry briefly considered punching Theo, but then, he was also Draco’s friend. Or at least had been at some point. And it wasn’t like punching him would have made him any less of a jerk. Then again, a jerk with a bruise tended to be a quiet jerk… But also, maybe this just was how Slytherins spoke to each other? Then again, this wasn’t Hogwarts and Harry wasn’t a Slytherin.
Harry wished that he would have already sipped his tea. It would’ve been much more natural-looking to almost choke on it rather than his own spit.
They stopped at the sixth landing where a portrait of an animagus was hanging, its head motif more often than not in his animal form as a lanky giraffe that looked as if it was made up of nothing but neck and clattering joints.
“Hey, um… I don’t want to disturb you for too long, so I’m just going to ask - did Neville get a postcard last Saturday?”
"I was going to write to you", Harry said after it became clear that Remus and Draco were both starting to run out things to talk about. "I was never going to keep this a secret."
“I hope they publish it," Harry said instead. “Honestly. Like, consent is a thing and all...”
“You like that?”
“That sounds very wrong”, Ron noted.
, he was really back and I couldn’t figure out how, but I was gone and I couldn’t…”
“Who did they send to investigate?” Harry said, directing his question to Arthur.
Draco frowned, and his heart beat faster, whispering things of war and murder and awful things that couldn't be avoided.
“Ugh, I don’t know," Ron said and leaned back in his chair, relaxing a little. “There isn’t really any other programme that interests me.”
“Come on," he said, his words turning into a white fog and floating away as they came in contact with the frosty air. He started walking towards the small gate that connected the courtyard with the outside world. The gate could be opened only by casting Alohomora and saying the correct password to the gargoyle that was guarding it from the nearby column, all this ensuring that no Muggle could ever walk through it.
And by the time the first snow arrives, she has made her decision. Draco has gone too far for her to reach now, but there is someone who has saved his son before, someone who can be guilted into saving him again with words of family he never had, and loyalty he has too much of. A portkey is made and Narcissa travels to meet Harry Potter.
Inside, a woman was tending to a cauldron, and from the smell in the air and the ingredients at hand Draco instantly realized that she was brewing Pepperup Potion.
“So, are you going to come?” Harry asked, and unable to use his hands, blew some unruly strands of hair away from covering his eyes. Draco tilted his head.
“But what can you do," Draco shrugged. “You can’t exactly walk to a Wizard shop with a Dark Mark on your arm and say, ‘it was just a phase’, can you? And the whole time the guy was stabbing ink into my arm and I was looking away and trying not to wail or throw up, I was thinking - I deserve to suffer. Because if I hadn’t been such a fucking coward, if I had just let him kill me… Then there would’ve been nothing to cover up.”
Then, suddenly, his eyes widened in realization. The coffee.
“You want to - you want to talk about what it was like to have sex with Draco?”
“I ran into him," Draco said. “He was crying and I just-” Draco stopped talking. So Harry had been on his way back from the library?
“She’s so different from other girls," Draco said dreamily. “I don’t know why I didn’t notice it before - she even made me coffee this morning! Just for me.”
“My pleasure," Harry said. “Let’s go find the elevator.”
“Do you speak any Russian?” Harry asked.
“Harold?” Draco said, frowning. Harry nodded towards the owl that was half-asleep on Harry’s bookshelf. “You said his name was Hector.”
Just like Percy had said, Charlie Weasley came to Darthorn the following week. Much to Ron’s disappointment, he was on a tight schedule and didn’t have much time to spend in the dorm in between lectures. Although Harry wasn’t very fond of dragons after fighting a Hungarian Horntail in the Triwizard tournament a few years back, he had agreed to go with Ron to one of Charlie’s lectures. Much like his brother, Ron was fascinated by dragons to such an extent that Harry sometimes wondered why he hadn’t gone into Magizoology instead of the AT programme.
“It looks great,” he said, gesturing to the garlands and lights that had been hung above the front door. For a moment, Mrs. Weasley beamed.
Draco smiled. Harry was starting to sound more like himself again.
"That's the thing," Harry sighed. "I'm happy. I'm really happy, but whenever I think about Auror stuff, I just… I don't know."
"Then why am I here?"
know how to knock," Draco said. He wasn't hiding very well the fact that he was still, despite getting closer to Harry, not terribly fond of Ron.
“Saint Potter saves the day," Malfoy said, his tone more bored than impressed.
“Man, that is going to
“I think a lot of it is just in his head too," Harry said. “He keeps talking about how all his brothers are better than him and how he never gets attention and - right, I know I’m not  the best person to say this, but who ever said he has to be more famous and successful than his brothers?”
Harry frowned, reviewing his notes.
“No," Harry said. “Honestly, nothing like that. I’m just, kind of stressed out right now.”
“Critics say Muggles wouldn’t have thought it was anything out of the ordinary," Harry wheezed. They laughed so hard at the thought they were both practically crying, adding ridiculous details to the story until it all came too much to bear.
“Fucking Muggles”, Malfoy groaned. “Fucking Muggles and their lousy electricity… should have gone back when I had the chance.”
"Would you show me?"
Draco gave a small huff and looked at the wall. It wasn’t difficult to tell that he was holding back from saying something mean.
Draco felt his gut twist. So Granger hadn’t - and now he had practically outed Harry to her-
As was Draco’s way, his words didn’t come without the corresponding actions.
"Lucius had big shoes to fill, growing up. Adrik and his little party killed forty mudbloods before they caught him."
“And Ginny didn’t feel like sticking with you through that?”
“I didn’t know you’ve been in therapy.”
"Yeah," Harry said. "Have you ever been?"
Once more, open-mouthed, they fell into a rhythm completely of their own, already familiar, yet infinite in an entrancing temptation. At a moment as hazy and unknown to Draco as the rest, Harry had freed one of his hands from Draco’s grip and now his fingers were creeping up the nape of Draco’s neck, passing by the buzzed-short hair at the back of his head before finding the part that Draco’s barber left longer at his request, and interlacing his fingers into it, grabbing him, pulling him closer while wrapping his legs around Draco, and all of a sudden it was Draco, not Harry, that was so deliciously trapped. There was nothing in the world Draco enjoyed more than that strange, never-ending battle of dominance, and he never failed to give it his best challenge.
“Yeah," Draco said. He seemed really tense, and Harry imagined it was because of the whole speech he had held about being there for each other and shit at the coffee shop that one night. In that moment Harry wished he hadn’t said things like that.
Harry blinked.
"So that part wasn't true?" Remus tilted his head.
“Well, she did use to be an Auror. It’s one way to gain a lot of enemies.”
"Oh, hi," Dean said and smiled wearily. "It's a nickname."
“Of course I hang out with her," Malfoy huffed in disbelief. “I mean, who wouldn’t?”
“Ron saw when you - but why would you do it in front of him? Didn’t it occur to you that it would put Harry in a really nasty position-”
“See, I’m not for earwigging personally, but since I happened to overhear that conversation between you and Malfoy a couple days ago, Dean and I figured-”
"Got you talking at least," Harry said.
Harry smiled and his eyes met Hermione's. Clearly she had had the same idea about trying to cheer Neville up.
Draco had never had such a stressful time packing his things. This was nothing like packing for any other trip he and Harry had gone on, because those trips usually got delayed at least two times, leaving Draco with plenty of opportunity to rethink which books he wanted to bring. Although, this didn't seem like the occasion to bring literature. Or was it? The plan was to go into hiding in some secret Ministry place in Denmark, but Harry wasn’t sure how long they would be able to stay there.
“What?” Harry said. “What’s with the grin?”
"I didn't mean-"
The drawer looked like it contained only papers, but when Harry moved them around a bit, he found the notebook tucked underneath.
"Am I not supposed to write letters to my friends?"
"I doubt you would have been able to," Bill Weasley said. "If it's one of the three ancient Wadjets I heard about when I was working in Egypt-"
The professor looked at his pocket watch. "Well, then... Oh, before I dismiss you, one more thing! When you visit the muggle hospitals, you are not to be seen in uniform and you are not, and I want to make this very clear, NOT allowed to bring your wands."
"How was your summer?"
Careful not to wake Draco up, Harry rolled over and reached for his glasses as well as  Remus’ letter that still lay on the floor from the previous night. Harry had forgotten all about it when Draco had showed up, but now he was already anxious to read it. As per usual, he had promised to write to Remus and Tonks often and then forgotten all about it as the term had started getting more intense. Well, this time for different reasons than before, but still. After slowly, slowly ripping open the envelope, trying to make as little noise as possible, Harry pulled out the letter and unfolded it.
“Help me pick up those dried snakes, will you?”
"Yeah... Tonks fixed it afterwards though. She used
“And you had already interviewed Toadsworth before Rolf Scamander?”
Draco leaned his back against the tree and looked up at it, up at the thick branches that fanned out above him, leafless and bare against the white sky. It was cold. He remembered how he had loved climbing trees as a child and how his father had laughed and told him to get down, to stop making such a fool of himself. Everyone is staring, he had said. Draco had wondered who everyone was, and why they mattered more than the swans that he had seen from the tree and tried to point out. But he hadn’t asked. He had learned early on not to ask stupid questions. And not to do ridiculous things that didn’t benefit anyone like climbing trees or running or staring at ponds, hoping to catch a glimpse of a swimming frog or a fish. Or even a leech. And he certainly should’ve known better than to kiss Harry Potter.
"You mean like, knowing the right people?"
. The room fell away, Harry felt his hands desperately grab onto whatever piece of clothing, skin, Draco he could find, he let his tongue brush past Draco’s like an invitation. Draco then gently bit Harry’s lower lip, and Harry opened his eyes. Neither of them pulled back, and Draco murmured against his mouth:
About five seconds of silence. Harry watched as greasy bits of film floated around on the surface of his tea.
The owl tilted its head. For some reason, though it was normally indifferent towards humans, it wouldn’t stop staring at Draco.
Lucius’ eyes turned to Harry.
Draco envied Harry, who out of well-formed habit had thrown his Gryffindor Quidditch Team duffel bag onto the bed and filled it quickly, not hesitating a single item. He had taken some clothes, but not enough to indicate a long absence; he had taken his toothbrush, a journal where he kept track of his cases, two or three potions and not much else. Harry, of course, was used to this sort of thing, having spent a considerable amount of his life on the run either from his aunt and uncle or snatchers or Voldemort, or all of them, not to mention the numerous work-related trips he had to go on.
Draco was sitting by the table in the very furthest corner next to the window. Harry handed him the coffee along with the change and sat down. Draco held the mug between his palms, and his fingers started to slowly change colours from what looked like frostbite, to a more healthy-looking tone.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. Harry snorted.
did. Grandmother Yana especially."
"Merry Christmas then, Ron."
“Must’ve been last Saturday," Larry said. “It was that day there was that awful thunderstorm! Just two days before you and Mr. Malfoy sneaked out in the middle of the night to Merlin knows where-”
"Will knitting help him fall asleep?" Asked Harry in a confused tone.
“S- So how did the interrogations go?” He said.
Someone guessed twenty-five feet, but the correct answer turned out to be thirty.
“So, how’s it going over at AT?” Seamus asked.
“You don’t seem particularly in need of that sort of thing," Draco said. “Well, if we ignore the condition you’ve left my door in. How did you get in here, anyway?”
“I have my moments," Seamus admitted. “Wanna come in?”
“Draco, I’m not going to obliviate my friend over something like that," Harry laughed and shook his head. “Merlin, you really are a Slytherin.”
“It would seem that Mr. Longbottom received a letter from someone," Larry whispered. “The letter also contained a postcard addressed to you and Mr. Malfoy. I saw Miss Granger read it and put it in that little purse she carries everywhere with her! What do you make of that?”
“That’s what a
"I've never seen you like that," Remus said and nodded back towards the dorms building as they strolled past the giant oak tree. His tone wasn't particularly surprised or teasing. Just, observing.
“I’ve made bags of this room haven’t I," Seamus laughed. “Dean’s in class and I’m bunking off, and I just got the bright idea that I should make a mixtape for him.”
"A lot of other days too," Harry said, staring at the pile of sand that now hid within it a 5000-year-old amulet worth more than twelve million galleons.
"You know, I've had this exact conversation before," Remus said, looking up at the whimsically crooked tower that was the centre of the main building.
An hour or so later Harry and Draco were comfortably squeezed into Harry’s bed, Draco reading a book he had brought with him and Harry pressed into his side, reading a folded up volume of Spider-Man - the one where Mary Jane got kidnapped by a manic fan of her modelling pictures, to be exact. Harry knew the story back to front, so he was merely eyeing at the pages, trying to pick up on jokes he had missed before. When he was finished with it, he turned to look at what Draco was reading. It was a mind-numbingly thick book called “The Idiot”.
“Uh… what?”
On Saturday afternoon Draco took Harry to a little coffee place not far from Diagon Alley. The day was crisp but surprisingly warm for October. They sat outside and engaged in something that, to Harry, felt sort of like being alone, just, together. They were sipping on their drinks (a latte with extra sugar for Draco and a tea with nothing for Harry), and Harry was reading a book Draco had brought for him, insisting he start reading it right there and then. It was a detective story by a wizard author called Hubert Lanky, published in 1948 according to the title page. The book looked its age - it was bound in moss-coloured leather and had those golden lines that old books often have, decorating the spine. The pages had aged into a pleasant tea-stained colour.
Draco nearly snorted.
"Maybe I do," Draco admitted. "But I'd rather not. It's easier to expect nothing."
"He admired a man from Europe. Grindelwald he was called. We read about him in a newspaper," the woman said.
"I failed an exam."
“Did she tell you why she did it?”
“I know worse," Draco said. “But better? No. Now, remind me again - why is it that you think it’s any of your business who I spend my time with?”
The words didn't sting much coming from a woman Draco had never liked as much as they confused him.
Narcissa shakes her head to banish the ugly meaning of the words, but hearing Draco call her mother brings tears to her eyes.
"Now then," the old man said, "should you grade each other's work from one to ten, ten being the highest of course..." Skepperus had a thick book and a quill at the ready, and Harry realized he was waiting for them to speak.
Harry was already trying to come up with excuses in his head for when Skepperus would open the closet and find two students inside. But why would he need to fetch robes in the middle of the night?
"Why am I here?" Draco asked again. He didn't have a wand with him, Harry would have no way to figure out where he had been taken… He felt the panic start to settle in. Ksenia served one person, and one person alone. It was clear from the way Ksenia now folded her frail body in half in a courtesy that she had now entered the room. Draco turned to look at the door of the drawing room.
The Weasleys were there in the living room waiting for them, too many of them to list. Hermione and Fleur with her and Bill’s three children were there, and Angelina (George’s wife, along with their two children, Fred and Roxanne), Percy’s wife Audrey and their two children, Molly and Lucy, and really, due to the number of children and people running around after them, Christmas was slowly starting to resemble the Quidditch World Cup. The mood, at least, was one of equal anticipation. The silence that fell when Harry and Draco arrived revealed that their situation had been the main topic of discussion before their arrival.
“No," Harry said. Despite the hours and hours he had talked (and snogged, to be fair) with Draco the previous night, Draco hadn’t mentioned anything about Hermione. “When?”
Draco sighed.
"They're tired after the trip," Neville said, wiping sweat from his forehead.
“Charlie said he’s managed to get on the headmaster’s bad side,” Percy said. “I can’t say I didn’t see it coming. There’s been talk at the Ministry-”
“Oh no, that would be the ginger. You don’t use it here?”
“Eff off”, Seamus laughed. “Me and the fella figured we ought to make sure you’re playing it safe, if you know what I mean.”
Malfoy didn’t answer. He went to open a cabinet behind him and took out a few jars.
“Blimey, you scared me,” Longbottom said as he stepped out of the door. He was wearing an apron and was drying his hands on it. Blue stains were left behind on the fabric, but that gave Draco no clue as to what he had been up to.
Theodore looked at him, and then he started laughing.
“What did you say?”
“You gonna come for me, Harry?” Draco said, groaning through the words.
“I did that to you," Harry said. “It was me, wasn’t it? When I used
“I don’t think that’s really any of your business.”
It turned out Seamus was going to join Dean in his Visual Charms lectures for a few weeks.
"So you like it then?"
Harry and Ron both snorted at the spell.
"Eight."
“Because I’m a selfish bastard, that's why. I felt so guilty I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t come up with anything else that would make it better. I’m sorry.”
Remus’ owl - Harry had now settled on the name Howard - flew to Draco’s knee, making him flinch in surprise. Looking suspicious, Draco offered it a hand. The bird nudged against it.
“Harry? Can I come in?”
“You need to get your shit together, Harry. McGonagall is practically begging you to teach next year, you keep promising me a weekend off there and a holiday there and it never happens! And you know, I don’t need you to take me to Bora Bora. I don’t need a whole weekend. I just need you to not be so fucking burned out all the time that as soon as you come home from work, you pass out on the couch. I need you to look after yourself, because I can’t do that for you while trying to write a thesis and get out of this shit job. I can't. I need you...” Draco carded through his hair, displeased that they were having this conversation on Christmas Eve. "I need you around."
, okay?”
"Very good," said Skepperus, "and Draco?"
"Ten."
“Well, people don’t really know that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. It’s a secret because Spider-Man’s a superhero, kind of like an Auror, and he fights all these villains - but they can’t find out who he really is so they don’t hurt his girlfriend - so he wears a mask. And when he has the mask, he’s Spider-Man.”
Harry, Neville and Hermione spend a rainy Saturday indoors. How will Hermione react when Harry finally works up the courage to bring up the topic of Draco Malfoy?
“The school, the position, the students and the rules… A conversation I had hoped I would have with yourself some day, Potter.”
Harry carefully inspected the mirror, looking behind it and at all possible parts before finally moving on to the reflection. He was to see that no one was standing behind him in the reflection. It was just him, standing in the cold light of his
“What did you say to her?”
“Do I want to come?” Draco repeated, not really able to hide the fact that he found the innuendo immensely funny. “Sure, Harry. I want to come with you.”
“Ah," the professor said in his ancient and profoundly British dialect that reeked of old money and race horses, “how are the young gentlemen doing?”
“Draco - darling - look at me.” Now there was a hitch in Harry's breath, one that told Draco he was probably touching himself down where Draco couldn't see.
"None of your concern," the blonde said and then quickly straightened his posture as professor Skepperus approached them.
PoM was short for Politics of Magic, Hermione's major.
After a couple more hours of restless sleep, Harry got up, got dressed and went to have breakfast with his flatmates. He found himself zoning out constantly, sinking into strange thoughts that made his friends, though they were sitting right there, seem distant and foreign.
“No”, Harry said, “I don’t have an owl, so…”
Outside the sun was rising.
is the time you won’t make it out of it alive, you have to let me be there for you. And even when you or I fail to do all of that we have to work it out, no matter how hard it is, because that’s what friends do.”
“You know, one time I was in Snape’s class and I forgot to call him ‘sir’, and then…”
Harry pressed his lips together and formed a somewhat apologetic smile. He couldn't help doing so every time Neville talked about Luna. The two had been a couple for a year and a half until Luna had broken up with him the previous winter. They had still remained friends, which was probably for the best but even so, Harry felt sorry for Neville. Luna had the tendency to remain oblivious to other peoples' emotions in situations like that, and while she had continued the friendship as effortessly as ever, it clearly wasn't as easy for Neville.
“Well don’t just stand there like a git then," Malfoy huffed and went back into the classroom.
“There really isn’t," Harry said, still using
"I want to take you to the movies."
“Except it is, Harry, because she’s my sister and you’re supposed to be my best friend! I’m the one person who’s supposed to know if you’re gay.”
“Some of it. At one point I was on a boat with my father - we were in a forest, travelling down a still stream. There was mist on top of the water and I was leaning over the edge of the boat to see where we were going, and then… Then I saw a rotting elk carcass in the water. It drifted past us very slowly and that's all that happened. I’d never really thought about death before and after seeing that I... I changed. So much so that my father wanted me looked at. I started walking with my head down because I was afraid I'd step on a bug if I wasn't careful. Then one time I saw Crabbe and Goyle torturing a spider and had a panic attack in the bathroom.”
"Kind of. He's now writing his thesis on Magizoology - apparently planning a trip to some rainforest in Africa to research a rare type of Flobberworm... Can't remember what they were called- well, anyway, Luna is going with him. To Africa."
“So, you have any plans for tomorrow?” Ron eventually asked.
21:10.
“Did I do something?” Harry asked. They both went quiet after talking over each other.
“N-” Draco silenced himself before the word escaped him. “Nothing” would hardly cut it now. “I may have fucked up a spell,” he then said.
“In two days," Hermione said. “I promised to send them some known historical cases of the misuse of Amortentia, just to spice up the article a bit, you know?”
Harry smiled at the thought.
"Do you want to fuck me?"
Remus smiled and placed a palm on Harry's shoulder, giving it a few pats.
Charlie Weasley gives a lecture on dragons at Darthorn. Harry feels like Draco is avoiding him, and just as he thinks he has resolved the situation, it appears he has a bigger problem. Someone in the dorm knows more than they ought to...
“How can you be so sure?” Draco asked quietly. “That you chose the right one?”
“No, I mean it," Harry said as he noticed Draco hadn’t taken him seriously.
“That doesn’t mean I won’t try.”
It was only when Harry said that that Draco noticed his absence. Draco had trouble keeping count of the Weasleys, even more so as the grandchildren grew in numbers.
“A nasty bee? Where?”
“You look so different.” It was perhaps the tenth time Draco had said it that day, but Harry couldn’t really blame him.
“That may be, but even this coat doesn’t come with a ward against pickpockets,” he said.
“What?”
“But I just saw Harry in the library half an hour ago - he was really upset when he left-”
“Now, who can guess how long it is from snout to tail?”
I sincerely hope AO3 doesn't send out notifications when I change the rating of my work. If that's the case, I'm so so sorry! I've been hovering between mature and explicit for some time and I don't know how anything works, but now I've settled on explicit. On another note, thank you so much for reading! :>
“Might pass this class after all," he said. “Seriously, Harry, thanks for helping me. I would rather drop out than go ask Hermione to help me again.”
Draco was so close that Harry had to physically look away in order to not get more flustered than he already was. Draco was pressed against him, and he could feel the soft air current of his breathing travel across his cheek before it evaporated. The way it felt - wait, what? Harry caught his thoughts as they started to drift away and tried to focus.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Draco said as he noticed Harry staring. “I’m gonna put the due date for Wednesday. That’s not too suspicious.”
“Not ants, Ron, Ents!” Hermione laughed. “They’re these imaginary creatures from a book - sentient trees that can walk and speak, only they do it very slowly. Took them a whole day to say ‘hi’ if I remember correctly.”
“Someone’s coming," Harry mouthed without making a sound. “
“Oh, Harry," Hermione said and took a couple running steps, wrapping her arms around Harry tightly. “Harry, it’s okay.”
They practically fell out of the closet, stumbled to their feet and started to awkwardly straighten their clothes.
“Can you guess?”
Draco glanced over his shoulder, the corners of his mouth turning downwards like they always did when he was disgusted by something.
“I don’t even have any treats”, Harry said and untied the letter that was tied to Hector/Harold’s foot. Harry had never gotten around to getting a new owl after Hedwig. Instead, whenever he did write to someone, which wasn’t often since his friends were at Darthorn with him most of the time, he borrowed Hermione’s owl or just rented one.
The woman chuckled.
He squeezed next to Harry and pulled the blanket over the both of them so that only a small opening was left from where they could peek out. They watched as the bee circled the ceiling lamp.
“What the hell do you mean, ‘don’t come’,” he hissed in between hitched breaths. “If you keep doing that, I’ll-”
Ron’s spoon clanged against the side of his cereal bowl. Harry swallowed down a particularly dry piece of bread and glanced at him. Ron had been staring at the hickey on Harry’s neck all morning, and Harry didn’t really blame him for it. He had hoped the uniform jacket’s collar would be high enough to cover it, but he hadn’t been so lucky.
Harry held his breath.
scared that they're somehow secretly gay. Like, as if they wouldn't have noticed."
“Politics of Magic”, Draco said dryly.
.” The footsteps were coming closer.
"Oh," Harry said. So Luna and Rolf were a couple. He could almost see Luna blabbering about him excitedly to Neville, who bravely nodded and asked questions. He was a Gryffindor, after all.
“I don’t know," Harry said. “Ron usually sits next to me, so I guess people just assumed he was down with something.”
"Things change."
Potter still looked so unimpressed and relaxed that Draco felt like jinxing him on the spot.
Harry had been right - it was cold outside to the extent where it almost felt disgusting, especially to Harry who was still a bit groggy from being woken up in the middle of the night. Harry saw Draco standing under a lamp post with his arms crossed, his hands tucked under the armpits as if to preserve some warmth. As Harry walked up to him, he noticed Draco’s cheeks and nose were flushed.
“Draco,” Draco said. “Draco Black, though a lot of people call me Potter, too.”
“Okay," Harry said, nodding. “But why in the middle of the night?”
“What do you mean? It’s a school day.”
Harry felt his heart skip a beat.
“I mean-” Draco huffed, “I get it that you’re trying for Harry’s sake but he’s not even here right now.”
“It’s not though," Draco huffed. “You should be allowed to run around London in a bathrobe and hand out little hats to people or do whatever the fuck you want without those cretins at the Prophet pretending like it’s somehow their business.”
Harry pulled a journal from the breast pocket of his uniform coat, and clicked the end of the ballpoint pen which he used to write in it. The click made McGonagall flinch slightly, as it was likely she had never seen such an object before.
Ron glanced at Harry's door and sighed. He then smiled back at Hermione.
Neville turned to look at a big potted plant with spotty leaves, perhaps to help Draco feel more at ease with the subject of discussion.
Draco was taking notes while professor Skepperus talked. He had taken Potter’s notebook from his bag while he slept, and was now writing down names of the most common poisons and their antidotes both in Potter’s notebook and his own. It was the sort of topic that Draco was already very familiar with, more so than he liked to admit. Bezoar, he wrote in his notebook and then Potter’s.
“Cool."
“Good,” Arthur said. “Very good.”
Percy nodded nobly and then turned his attention to Ron.
“Did you try the smudge-removing charm?” Harry said before Draco had time to verbally question the strange atmosphere. In a small gesture, he shook his head.
“What’s there to talk about? We’re the same as always… Fighting, alright for six months or so, fighting... But we always make up in the end, don't we?”
“I didn’t mean what I said yesterday," Harry forced out. “About you becoming an Auror. I’m sorry.”
“Really?” Harry said. He was leaning back in his chair, balancing on its back legs in that position where it was inevitable that he would either continue to look cool and unbothered or fall over any second now.
“So it was because you didn’t like her back?”
“Yes,” he said. “You’re not in it.”
“We’re not. Not like we’d like to, anyway. We can’t stay there long.”
“Okay, enough information," Harry said, got up and patted Ron on the shoulder before going to his room. “See you later.”
“I don’t believe I’ve had the pleasure,” she then said and held out her hand. Draco shook her hand, not really knowing whether names should be mentioned. They knew each other, they just hadn't met. Besides, practically speaking Draco wasn't even a Malfoy anymore.
To be honest, Draco had expected the sex to get less intense after a few times. Less desperate somehow, after they’d get used to each other being around. But come to think of it, they hadn’t really gotten the chance to get used to anything yet, had they? Once Draco had regained consciousness at St.Mungo’s, he had quickly noticed that Harry wasn’t eager to lose sight of him again anytime soon. And so, what had originally been a gently placed invitation for Draco to spend the holidays visiting the Weasleys and Remus Lupin with Harry, had now turned into an imperative. And much even to his own surprise, Draco had resisted only the necessary amount to seem polite, and then accepted. And although he wanted to ease the restlessness of Harry, to whom Draco’s sudden disappearance had triggered something of an anxiety episode, his true motives, at least to him, seemed far less noble.
"What do you mean you haven't been? I thought you were raised a Muggle."
Hermione chuckled and tucked a curly strand of hair behind her ear.
"So I take it that the article…"
"Another nickname?"
Draco leafed through the pages.
"Oh fuck... Harry," Draco groaned against Harry's shoulder. The sensation of being buried to the hilt inside Draco was maddening, so good, so slick and tight and perfect, and Harry started losing every trace of control as he heard Draco whimper out his name. Draco, who was always in control, was unraveling, losing himself in how good it was and Harry kissed him, moaning into his mouth as he fucked Draco, greedily satisfying himself in the way Draco's body gave into him.
A giraffe was staring judgementally at him from the portrait.
"Yeah. It would be so much easier to just apparate," Harry said.
, Harry thought, but Draco continued.
“Why?” Harry said, surprised.
Draco grinned.
"Are they going to adopt someone?" He asked quietly as he started filling out his date of birth, place of residence and so on.
When Harry returned to the dorm, he found Ron sobbing at the kitchen table. The man startled at the sound of the door opening and started to hurriedly wipe his face.
"But still," Hermione said, shaking her head. "I don't know how someone can just depend on a man like that."
Draco mumbled something against Harry's chest, but either he wasn't making much effort to articulate or his voice was being muffled against Harry's clothes, because Harry couldn't have guessed a single word of it.
“And start all over again? No way.”
"Good point. There's a good shot." A camera clicked.
"And you, you need to quit slacking around. Our name is starting to finally count for something at the Ministry, did you know that?"
“Down to atoms," Draco said.
"What? No, I meant... You know that I'm your friend, right?"
“Slow news day then," Harry said, not really understanding what all the fuss was about.
"He should've been the chosen one," Harry said as he sat up. Draco smiled at the comment but couldn't shake the realisation that they were now alone, and with them spending a surprising amount of time as a group with Harry's friends lately, he decided he should take his chance. He sat up too, trying to think of a better way to approach the topic than "let's fuck".
“You sure?” Neville asked.
" a familiar, spread-thin voice said from the other side of the door.
“What a shame," Draco said, leaning back in his chair nonchalantly. “Tell me, where did you drag mum this time? Russia? Cold there this time of year, as far as I can remember. But it’s not like the likes of you have much of a choice when it comes to picking out hiding places, is it?”
probably would have worked too, he thought, but there was something undeniably cathartic about using
“Where the hell are you going then?” Weasley yelled after him.
“Nothing much there to be afraid of if you ask me. He just stood there and gawked for a second looking like a proper git and then left.”
“Yeah, I kind of... screwed the whole thing up.”
“Are you feeling poorly too, Draco?”
"No."
"You mean it makes the wearer immortal?" George asked.
Some of you may have noticed Harry saying to Draco he now has PTSD as a result of everything that happened during the war. As someone who struggles with PTSD, I'm not sure how much of Harry's symptoms I'll have the energy to write into the story without it affecting my own mental health negatively. I generally like to keep my stories light-hearted, but I still felt it was important to stress that I didn't just throw the word 'PTSD' in there as a token without any real intent to follow through with it. (Looking at you, certain relevant-to-this-context author with a nasty habit of queer baiting...) After everything that has happened to Harry, I think it's realistic to assume he would have it.
“Draco and I?” Harry said. He felt his heart pick up some speed again. “What about us?”
Narcissa walks to the college. She's reluctantly aware of its location as her sister Andromeda used to go there. She is a traitor to the family and Narcissa doesn't like the idea that in addition to his school, Draco might soon have that too in common with her. Narcissa arrives in front of the college. A hideous-looking building, really. The main building is tower-like with smaller buildings surrounding it. The tower itself is crooked and appears as if it has been built out of mismatched pieces of old houses. Narcissa suspectes it's held together by magic alone, and that on the inside it's much larger and grander. Her eyes wander down to the front door. She sees it open and can't believe her luck - Harry Potter walks out and goes to lean onto a column maybe ten feet away, looking like he's waiting for someone. Narcissa knows a chance when she sees one. She clutches her purse tighter and starts walking towards him. Then everything goes wrong all at once - the Potter boy pulls away from the wall, hands tucked in his pockets, as the door opens again and Draco walks out. Narcissa stops dead in her tracks, but it's too late. Draco has noticed her and is looking straight at her, and now Potter too. Narcissa hesitates. She tries to turn back, but her feet won't budge. Her son isn't wearing a hat, she notices. It's so cold outside…
“Perhaps she thought teaching the Auror trainees too intense?” Draco said.
“We didn’t though”, Harry said, still frowning. “Why are you interested in this?” Harry’s voice pitched higher at the end of his sentence from the sheer confusion.
“We wanted to find out if you were the heir of Slytherin," Harry said. “We chatted with you for a bit, but then you said you didn’t know who the heir was, and the next thing I know you’re calling Hermione the m-word and I have to physically stop Ron from punching you into the next morning so, yeah. It didn’t go very well. Hermione turned into a cat, too. Well, her face did anyway. She spent quite a chunk of that year at the hospital wing, come to think of it.”
Harry touched the bridge of his nose. He remembered the grotesque sound of cartilage cracking, vividly. He could almost taste blood in his throat.
“What’s a bottom?” Ron said. “Is it like the one who…”
"And are you giving
Hermione took the papers and smiled awkwardly. She didn't have the heart to tell Percy that the courses on magical law had been moved to first year, and she too had passed them with full marks.
“Murdered,” George said. “They found her this morning in the courtyard. Poor bugger… The killing curse by the looks of it, from what I hear. It was Rolf Scamander that found her.”
21:04.
Harry hadn’t had laugh as good in weeks, and even Hermione went a little red in the face from giggling for so long.
Seamus, Dean, Neville, Ron and Hermione all wheeled around to look at Harry in a coordination that was at the very least unnerving.
"It was a whole argument with Ron, no surprise there. I told Hermione first and she was really understanding about it, which I don't really even get because - it's Malfoy, you know? I'm always - even now, even though I know you won't be a dick about it, I'm completely on edge, ready to defend him because I'm so sick of trying to make other people see what I see and I'm just scared that they never will. It's not fair because everyone praises me for what I did even though I pretty much had no choice, and neither did he, and he's so alone. And it's not that I don't know the he was a complete git at school, I do, but he also did good things, and brave things and now…" Harry realized he was ranting and smiled apologetically. "I guess what I'm trying to say is, despite everything, it kind of feels like there's no one else for me."
"Piss off, the lot of you," Seamus said and held the paper in front of him. "The resemblance is uncanny."
"I knew from the start she was too soft to be a good mother. I told her not to spoil you so, and look what happened."
He and Draco looked at each other for a moment. Something, the familiar something was spiraling and coiling in the air around them again.
“What is it?” Draco said, having noticed Harry’s smile quickly fading.
"No, you're right," Draco said. "You're right, we… I never hit him like father did but I wasn't nice to him. I was everything but nice to him."
Just like Harry had suspected, Hermione was doing homework in the school library on the fourth floor of the main building. Harry found her things laid out on one of the desks and could hear footsteps echoing somewhere within the aisles of books. Somehow Hermione had charmed a quill to make notes for her while she was away. Harry leaned in to look at the notebook (Hermione had exclusively started using paper notebooks after learning what parchment was made out of) and almost got hit in the head by a book that was levitating over the desk.
Draco was so embarrassed he couldn’t get a single word to come out.
Hermione smiled and shook her head in a small gesture.
“Yeah," Harry said as he sat down in one of the two armchairs. The leather was so old that it didn’t let out a squeak. “How are the socks coming along?”
“Hey," Harry said just as she stepped over the doorstep, “could you… not mention to Ron about Malfoy and I being friends?”
"A noble cause," Remus admitted. "Shall I tell Dora to owl you?"
"Is - is it good?" Draco asked through hitched breaths as if Harry's barely composed words hadn't convinced him. Harry's fingers curled around Draco's, their hands interlacing together. Harry began to freely murmur his thoughts into Draco's neck.
For a moment, it was quiet. Draco's heart sank as he realized the situation, and just like he always did when he was taken aback, he started stumbling over his words.
" he read aloud. The door swung open, letting out a familiar creak.
“Well why didn’t you tell me?”
Ron raised his hand.
“Yes, I know the feeling,” Draco said. “I can assure you, if it were up to us, we wouldn’t be here in the first place.”
“It just doesn’t make sense for him to hide it very well," Harry said. “I mean, he uses it every day, and it’s not like it has Ministry secrets in it.”
“Yes, you’re quite right. I wouldn’t want to keep you from your duties any longer than is necessary.”
“Can’t you just leave? You’re distracting me.”
“You haven’t," Harry said as he slammed the door closed behind him.
Harry hadn’t heard Draco say “um” before, and he couldn’t help but smile.
“If I did, Skepperus wouldn’t be the first person I’d ask," Draco said. “Did you pull an all-nighter again or is it just the fame tiring you?”
“People keep saying that," Harry said, taking a sip from his tea. “Is it a good different or a bad different?”
“You know, I don’t really have the heart to send you to the Owlery just yet”, Harry said. “Not in this weather. Will you wait here while I write back? It will take me a while, though.” Not really in the position to comment, the owl cocked its head and started to carefully clean the underside of its wings.
"Harry?"
"He worked hard to raise himself differently. He made some friends, even fell in love at some point, perhaps - and no, the world was not kind to him, as is often the case with kind people. But I don't believe that he regretted for a moment that he lived on his own conditions instead of someone else's."
Harry laughed a little in disbelief. Ron didn't.
“I can handle him," Draco said. “Besides, he isn’t here much and when he is, he’s usually in his room wanking so he doesn’t give me much trouble.”
Harry was a little taken aback. So in addition to his friends, Draco had lost his family too?
Draco whistled softly.
"Let's go eat," Harry said.
“Well… Yeah.”
"Good," Ron said. "Arsehole deserves it."
“And what if I have? What are you going to do, ground me?"
Harry stopped and just stood there for a while, staring at orange leaves that had been plastered against the pavement by neverending showers of water and wind. Although he was already looking forward to getting started on homework, he felt a little absent-minded. He thought about the spare bedroom in Remus and Tonks' house, and the comforting noise that came to be when raindrops pounded against its window. The wallpaper had a wolfsbane pattern. Harry wondered where he would sleep if Remus and Tonks had another baby. Maybe he would just visit and spend the nights at Grimmauld Place?
“Knotgrass,” Draco said, “but that was in bloom five months ago.”
almost noon, then who was at the door? Everyone had lectures, and even if they had decided to skip, it still wasn't as if they'd be interested in what Draco was up to. Or whether he was up in the first place.
“But don’t you think… Since it’s clearly the making of a Dark Arts practitioner…”
“I’m pretty sure everyone remembers that Howler… All the Slytherins thought it was fucking cool though.”
“Oh come on, everyone was cringey back then," Harry laughed. “In case you forgot, Ron and I stole his dad’s car when we missed the train to Hogwarts.”
“So does
“But I thought ants don’t talk at all," Ron said. “Or is that what you meant?”
“Nasty business, that Toadsworth thing,” Neville said as Draco closed the greenhouse door behind him. The air inside was very thick and moist, and the scent of wet dirt took Draco right back to Herbology lessons.
Draco laughed.
Remus and Harry both laughed, Harry with an added pinch of what felt like his heart stretching in an effort to fit a little more of this inside.
“Probably”, Harry admitted and leaned back in his chair. Ron leaned forward secretively and gave a grin.
Remus looked exhausted, but in a nicer way than usual. Instead of a dark shadow under his eyes, a couple new wrinkles had settled in the corners, making him appear more cheerful than before. But other than that, he was still the same; he wore bookish, brown clothes and his face was striped by diagonal scars, some old and translucent, some fresh and scarlet.
“He’s good," Harry admitted.
"It'll be long enough soon to make a lovely little bun," he had said. Harry had laughed, but secretly he wasn't planning on cutting his hair just yet. He had noticed that he looked quite a bit like Sirius when he let his hair, moustache and beard grow out a little bit, and he wasn't quite ready to let go of that. Not yet, at least.
“Looked okay. Like it’s supposed to, I guess.”
Draco finished reading the card and touched the top of his head.
"Neville is learning how to knit," Hermione explained without raising her eyes from the book. "His legged pots kept him awake all night."
“Hi," Granger said and, though Draco couldn’t even begin to understand why she bothered, forced a little smile. She was holding a stack of folders and notebooks and looked like she was on her way to do homework.
“I’ll be right back," he said to his friends, hurried to his feet and went after him.
“Good. I wouldn’t be caught dead associating with your kind.”
"Yes," Harry said. "I forgive you."
“Erm… Boys?” Professor Skepperus said. “Sit down, will you? Eh, so, as I was saying...”
“And yet, here you are. What do you want?”
Draco found professor Toads-whatever-her-name-was sitting on a chair in front of the broom cupboard that led to the quidditch field. Draco recognized her from the ridiculous amount of layers of robes and furs. She was reading a magazine, cross-legged, looking more like a homeless person than a professor.
“And then he started to make fun of Ron for being a Weasley," Harry said.
If you're so horny, he often asked himself, why don't you just make a move? It wasn't as if he didn't have the balls to do it. He wasn't insecure, not around Harry anyway. It was just… He had wanted Harry for so long and had expected to gain some sort of control over it, eventually. To not feel so
Harry took that as an invitation. He followed Draco and saw that he was indeed in the middle of brewing something.
“So you just, decided to scare him out of his mind so he couldn’t become an Auror?”
“Yes, Mr. Weasley?”
Walking to places with Potter on campus still felt kind of surreal. This was college so no one actually cared that much, but they had definitely received some prolonged looks from a few Hogwarts alumni who had then started whispering amongst their friend groups. Draco knew what they must have been thinking - that Potter was noble for allowing himself to be seen in that kind of company.
“Well you should know, you’re the one who-”
“Kind of," Draco said. “I guess, also that I wouldn’t even be friends with her anymore. It was too weird after everything that had happened. She tried to tell me she didn’t care what I thought about Muggles, that she just didn’t want me to disappear from her life.”
“Oh, that’s- It’s Remus’. Just got here before you did”, Harry said.
“Had better things to do.”
"You're going too far," she says. "Darthorn I could have accepted, but this… You're acting like a fool, Draco. He- his kind, they killed
"It's not that she wouldn't, I just… I don't know."
“Uh… Good morning?”
“You are wrong," the professor said, her voice calm. She started pacing around in front of Draco in an annoying way that made it look like she was walking in a garden on a Sunday evening. “To be frank with you, Mr. Potter has had trouble in the past telling apart his memories, his fears and his paranoia, from the moment at hand. This is not a quality one wishes to see in an Auror. I had hoped time would have eased Mr. Potter’s burdens - had that been the case, he would have made it out of the mirror without my assistance. In fact, despite this morning’s failed attempt, I believe he is capable of this. Whether it is wise for him to use his strength for such things, is another matter. As head of the Auror Training programme I was obligated to look past my personal opinion and give him an equal chance to the other students.”
“I said, do you like that,” he repeated, and regretted that his own pleasure was leaking through the words and eating at the assertion.
Draco recognized the ceiling he was now looking at - ornate panelling in amber wood -  and groaned. He felt seasick. Rubbing his lower back, now sore from the impact, he sat up, reaching for his wand. It wasn't there. He searched again after hastily scrambling to his feet.
“Let me have it in my mouth,” Harry said.
, but that only made seeing more difficult.
"What? How?"
, ready to stupefy anyone else in the tent. He lowered his wand a little when he realized he was alone. He wasn’t really surprised he hadn't been chosen for duelling as it always been one of his strong suits, but as someone had once - or actually, plenty of times - told him, there was rarely any harm in constant vigilance. Harry looked around the tent, expecting to find a cursed object waiting for him on a table somewhere, but the whole space was stripped of furniture. The only thing
“We’re almost there," Harry said. “Just one more floor.”
A faint sound of footsteps echoed in the hallway.
"But if I was, we could do anything. This wouldn't be so complicated, we could just… I don't know. It feels like everyone has an opinion."
“Oh, I see. But it’s not her who’s losing focus now, is it, Harry?”
“Well, we’re still here," Harry said. He let out a sigh that sounded like it came from relief. "We're both still here, Draco."
“I know what it sounds like, but here’s the thing," Harry said, keeping his voice low so their chatter wouldn’t wake up the others, “the only ones who know about us are Ron and Hermione, and this came a couple weeks ago.”
“Yeah," Harry sighed. “It honestly seems like he’s only doing it to try and make his parents proud.”
"It's an ancient Egyptian amulet," Draco said. "It's the next best thing there is to a Philosopher's Stone."
“I don’t know what his bloody name is”, Harry admitted, making Draco laugh.
"Don't you know?"
Breathless, Harry shook his head in the tiniest gesture. There was little gentle left with the way Draco kissed him now, his tongue rolling over Harry’s, his hands frantically exploring Harry’s neck and the arch in his back that had come to be just from the way Harry was leaning into him. Harry felt his limbs go weak from the almost animalistic way he began to lose himself in it. He made Draco take a few steps back, guiding him to sit on the bed and climbed on top of him just like before, except this time no one interrupted them.
“Spider-Man? Is he like, an animagus or something?”
“Why should I trust you?”
Neville closed the door after himself and sat down after awkwardly moving the pile of clothes under which Harry’s chair was buried under.
"Who gives a shit about manly?" Draco pulled back a little to look at Harry, platinum wisps of hair carelessly hanging in front of his eyes. "What did professor Lupin say?"
killed you-know-who.”
keep you quiet at the same time. Not really something I do for fun.”
Harry has his first encounter with Theodore Nott, and though it is unpleasant, he soon forgets all about it as he and Draco are faced with a choice. The question is, of course: will Draco's voice-muffling spell work, or do ducks have especially good hearing?
Lucius gave a laugh.
“Harry?”
Harry felt an unknown jerk in his gut.
Dean looked at Harry.
“She was a great professor from what I hear,” Draco said quickly. “Shame. Real shame.”
"Do you want to…" Draco's voice faded as their eyes met and admired at each other, both darkened in lust and desperation.
“In Paddington."
Draco shook his head.
“Well, not to brag or anything, but I make a pretty mean cup noodle.”
“Hm.” Draco looked outside, but could see nothing but white mist and the drops of moisture rolling off the glass walls. “Suppose I already love that person,” he then said. “Suppose I do everything in my power to love him as best as I can.”
" scribbled next to it), Harry hadn't come up with much yet. He wasn't sure where to draw the line - did his scar count as an injury? It wasn't as if there was a protocol on how to treat people who had survived the killing curse. And what about all the times he had passed out? Should he list them all individually?
“Like what?”
“No, I won’t,” Harry said, and there was now a coldness in his voice that Draco hadn’t heard in a long time. “I need your help.”
Although the room was small, it had a distinct feeling of warmth to it, one that Draco wished he knew how to replicate in his own home. All he had known growing up were cold stone and grand staircases and rooms where children weren’t allowed in. There had been a time in his life when he had thought that children would surely not be allowed in his own home, either, but that had changed after he had met Harry’s godson, Teddy. The boy was nine years old now, which Draco found hard to believe. Not that he didn’t look it, of course - it just baffled Draco how he had changed so much in so little time, while he himself had remained the same. Or perhaps that was wishful thinking.
"Bad people," Narcissa nods. "Don't speak as if we didn't teach you anything."
“Shut up," Draco said and kissed him in a way that could only be described as
Harry stepped into the hallway that was now covered in dust and bits of drywall and wood from the small explosion that had just taken place. He was expecting to see Voldemort appear from around the corner, but no one seemed to be there, not even the Dursleys. Harry wandered into the kitchen, flinching at every sound the floor made under his feet. The room was decorated with furniture he didn’t recognize. He walked over to the table and looked at the newspaper that was spread out on top of it. It was a Daily Prophet with the headline “Head Auror Potter, 42, Killed on Duty” printed in massive letters on the front page.
"Hiding," Harry said, and at the same time Draco said "nothing". They glanced at each other.
“He's not fragile.”
"I apologized to him a month ago."
“What’s with the face," Harry said. “Ron and I will be fine. You look like you’re going to bite me again like, at any minute.”
“Ready to go?”
“No, I mean,” a smile spread across Harry’s face as he spoke, “are you coming with me? For Christmas?”
“We’ll take a right at Paddington Station”, Harry said. “You reckon we’ll be seeing any little bears with red hats running about?”
Harry breathed out. Everything was okay, after all. He hadn’t betrayed Draco’s trust.
Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes - they were about at the level of where his scar began on his forehead - and saw waves and patterns in his irises he hadn’t noticed before. He noticed Draco glancing at his lips and swallowing. Harry’s lips parted instinctively and he was already expecting to be kissed again when Draco said:
Draco took a sip of his gin and tonic, threw himself in his favourite, ghastly leather armchair that Harry had picked out, and wondered when his life had turned into waiting for his husband. He was twenty-seven years old and spent his time waiting for Harry to get home from work, waiting for him to finish with the paperwork, waiting for him to help with the dinner like he had promised, waiting for him to finally make a decision about his career… Sometimes, when they argued, Draco liked to exclaim that he was becoming nothing short of a mid-century housewife, to which Harry’s only comment was that he was arguably more handsome.
“You didn’t take that nap, did you?”
“But I-”
"Fuck, fuck I'm gonna-" Draco whimpered as he came, his orgasm causing his whole body to jerk and Harry's throbbing cock to twitch inside him as his muscles tightened around it. The way Draco pulsed in waves left Harry powerless, delirious, he couldn't stop fucking him through it, and Draco was trembling under him, his release teasing, dragging itself out.
"I see."
Draco looked at Remus, and Harry couldn't quite tell what he was thinking. Something vaguely melancholic and also grateful, judging by the way his lips pursed together in not quite a smile but not not-a-smile either. He nodded.
"I won't come home," the man says. "But whenever you want to visit me, you'll be welcome. I'll write you back. Maybe one day I'll come to see you. But this is the life I'm choosing and if you won't accept it, there's nothing I can do."
Draco was silent for a while.
On Friday Harry had finally gone to the barber, and was now sporting a haircut that still looked messy and unkempt (two features that Harry doubted would always remain a part of his look, provided he didn’t suddenly go bald) and considerably less facial hair. And as if that hadn’t been enough, Harry’s new glasses had been owled to him the same day. He had had to update his prescription, and for the first time ever he had chosen new frames for his glasses. They were still round but not perfect circles, and the frames were dark tortoise shell rather than wire. With all that combined, he had barely recognized himself when he had looked in the mirror that morning.
"How old is it?" Harry asked.
"But why?" Harry asked, dumbfounded, as Draco stood back up.
“Thought you’d be still asleep”, Remus said, a smile on his face. “I-”
“Alright.”
“They’re alright.”
Hands in his pockets, Harry stepped a little closer to the wall to read what sentence was underlined on one of the book pages.
, I’m telling you…”
"As far as I can recall, he doesn't have a son anymore."
Draco ventured outside and behind the castle, grateful for the fresh air and the absence of people. He let his eyes rest on the familiar landscape; the tall silhouette of the Owlery within the mist; the faint light glimmering in the window of the groundskeeper's hut; and on his right, the Great Lake, though most of it disappeared into the fog. Seeing this place didn’t cause as much dread as he had expected. Perhaps enough time had finally passed since his school years, perhaps enough of those memories filled with panic and torment had been replaced with good ones.
“Yes we do," Harry said. “Draco, I swear I didn’t know what that spell was. I had read it in a stupid book-”
“I don’t want to go," Ron sighed. “Believe me, if it wasn’t for you and Hermione, I’d have dropped out the first week.” He sipped from his coffee and while doing that, glanced at his watch. His eyes widened and he quickly downed the rest of it in a painful-looking gulp.
“Yeah, but you know what I mean.”
“Now, this last bugger isn’t any small beast," Charlie said as he charmed into existence an almost too realistic-looking dragon. It was made up of black, stringy bits of smoke that somehow still glittered in the light, resembling real scales. It was so big that it couldn’t have stood up on its back legs in the classroom.
"Yep," Ron said, chomping down big spoonfuls of colourful cereal.
Lucius grinded his teeth.
“Hm,” Harry said, scribbling in his journal. “And after the interview, what was your impression? Did you find her competent enough to hire?”
“You would have done the same for me.”
“That’s pretty romantic of you," Harry said.
“Oh?” Draco said and sat down next to Harry. He wasn’t sure why, but his first reaction had been to think that Harry would now proceed to tell him he’d rather kiss a Dementor than be friends with him.
“Surely they don’t expect Harry to- at a time like this-”
“Listen, it’s okay if you’re scared," Harry said. “They’ll get us out of here.”
Harry chuckled. He sat down on Draco’s bed and Draco sat next to him. Harry gave him the newspaper and waited as he read the article.
"Okay," Harry said, aware that he was beaming.
"I hope I'm not ruining your Christmas," Draco said. "Harry insisted."
Harry gathered every ounce of courage he could, but the words 'because I like him' just wouldn't leave his mouth.
“Why what?”
“What was it?”
“Yeah.”
Draco," she says, because in the English language there is no word that means both "goodbye" and "forgive me".
"How did you get in, anyway?" Harry asked after a moment of silence.
“I should think so”, Draco said as he folded the corner of a page and closed the book. “We used to spend a couple months there every year with father’s relatives.”
? What - what are we talking about exactly?”
They had been climbing, floor after floor after floor, and had already passed both Draco’s and Potter’s dorms. Draco now had a feeling they were going to the roof, but he was starting to be too out of breath to ask.
“Fuck, Draco…”
By rights, bees shouldn't have been buzzing around London in December. That sort if thing seemed out of place even to wizards who were used to all sorts of flying, potentially pointy creatures. So it's no wonder, really, that both Draco and Harry flinched when they heard an eerie buzz circling Harry's room one day.
“When?” Harry asked as they started climbing up the stairs.
“Unless it has," Draco said and looked at Harry, raising his brows smugly.
“Well he definitely took something out of the drawer," Harry said. “Look.”
"I don't… I don't know
Harry gave a smile and then laughed at a memory.
guy? Who I'm not dating, I just think he's kind of, cute. When he isn't sneering."
“I should… Just have a feeling…”
Theodore Nott noticed Harry as he passed through the common area to reach Draco’s door. The boy - well, man now - snickered at him. He still, in Harry’s opinion, resembled a piece of string cheese. He had light hair and even lighter eyebrows that, along with his teeth, gave him a rabbity look.
The mentioning of Tonks made Harry realize something he hadn't thought about before, but now that he had, he couldn't believe he had missed it.
“So he left it in there," Harry nodded. “But how do we get in?”
“Now hold it - one, two, three, four…”
The short silence that followed was full of questions.
“Oh," Harry said and started flipping through his notes, trying to find the page where he had scribbled the instructions down, “here.”
"Do you intend to stand there in the doorway throughout the endurance of this conversation?"
“No, Mr. Malfoy, such is not the case. I did not introduce this mirror to Mr. Potter without the intention of teaching him how to overcome its horrors, should that be what he still wants after what he has seen today.” The professor was looking up at Draco. She was so short she probably couldn’t have reached the top of Draco’s head with her hand. “I can tell that you care for Mr. Potter deeply, and I would have you understand I am operating under the particularly close watch of the Auror Department. They are - how do you say - most
“Why I’m ever so sorry," Draco huffed sarcastically and threw Harry’s wand on the bed where neither of them could easily reach it.
20:58.
Harry looked at Draco, and from his expression Draco realized there was really starting to be no choice left.
Harry thought, bitterly: he suffered in Azkaban for thirteen years and was confined in the house of the family he hated and was then killed by his own cousin. But that wasn't what Remus said.
Draco gave that bashful smile that Harry liked so very much. Harry felt somewhat like a simpleton sitting there in his gray Donald Duck sweater, not having the faintest idea of to whom Draco and Remus were referring to. He would have liked nothing better than to impress Draco somehow, for he seemed to good and learned in so many things, while Harry often felt like he only had two brain cells, one of which was reserved for overthinking and the other for not thinking at all. Well, he was good at not getting killed, but that sort of thing didn't count for much at college where knowing a cheap pizza place that delivered was information worth more than all the defeated dark wizards in the world put together.
“No, Harry”, Hermione said. “Don’t you remember? Draco said his name and Ron laughed at him.”
“I see your friend is not with you tonight. I hope he isn’t ill anymore", Larry said, and then the door swung open. Harry frowned as he walked inside. Was Draco his friend now?
“Something on your…” Harry pointed vaguely at his own neck.
"Revolting choice of words, really."
“That maybe someone tipped the press off about you two," Seamus said. The only way he could have been referring to Neville more directly would have been to point at him.
"What don't I understand?" Narcissa says encouragingly, hoping that by being gentle she could bring Draco's mind back to the good times they have shared together.
Harry’s eyes widened a little as Draco raised his gaze and looked at him. His eyes had turned bloodshot, and a tear escaped the left one, though Draco quickly wiped it away.
"I may have."
"The mirror," Draco said, feeling his patience starting to run on mere steam, "is the mirror from Knockturn Alley?"
Draco made a face that was a delightful mix of amusement and fluster, although Harry couldn't tell which one overlapped the other.
Draco's shoe had been tapping at the floor restlessly, but now it stopped. He threw a quick leer at Harry as if assuring him that everything would still be the same, and said:
“It’s," Malfoy started, and Harry wasn’t sure if he had imagined it, but for a moment he looked a little flushed as he quickly turned to look away from Harry, “it’s your hair. It always sticks straight up after you’ve slept.”
“I hope not,” Neville said, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. “Not much of a conversation, that. Not that I don’t like talking about plants, but… I was rushing it. I had somewhere to be that day.”
"It's just… Are you sure about this? If we have the Wadjet on us, we'll be in far greater danger. If word gets out about such a thing being in the country, who knows who will try to-"
“At midday, give or take half an hour,” Gwen said. “I say, we simply must go to Hogsmeade to celebrate Christmas together after we’re all done for the day! It’s been ages since I step foot in the Three Broomsticks.”
“Give me that," he said and snatched the thermos mug from Draco’s hands. Harry sniffed the top. It smelled like coffee - but also of something else. Of treacle tart and wood, and… no, not flowers anymore, but Harry still knew what was in the mug. He then remembered what he had read about Amortentia a few days earlier. The question. Just to make sure.
“I’m sorry.”
"I suppose he could be," Draco said. "But that's not what it's really for."
“Okay," Hermione said with a confused tone. “But why?”
“Poisonous candles?” Skepperus repeated, sounding intrigued. “What about them?”
“Apology accepted," Harry said, smiling a little.
Draco threw his legs over the edge of the bed, but startled and pulled them back up when he felt his feet hit something that felt unnervingly similar to a person. Draco peeked over the bed frame onto the floor, and whoever was lying there let out a groan and shifted, the floor boards creaking softly under their weight.
“It was worse last time I was here," Draco said. He had changed out of his uniform after Magical Injury, and was wearing Adidas joggers and a black longsleeve that fit him just well enough that Harry couldn't look at him for a very long time without his thoughts straying.
“On the sixth floor," Harry said.
"But you do," Draco said. "And I turn your whole life complicated. That's us. That's what it… would be."
Harry let out the breath and then Draco held him again, a little tighter this time. Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair and for a moment, they were quiet. It stopped snowing.
"It doesn't really scare me," Harry noted. "I mean, I know I'm straight. I date women."
"Yeah, I heard... They should keep his kind locked up if you ask me."
Neville nodded, and they started walking together.
“Apparently it’s all it takes to make you hard, too,” Harry continued, ignoring Draco’s attempt at a comeback and laid his hand where the fabric of Draco’s trousers was pulled taut. Involuntarily, Draco’s breath hitched a little, his back arching at the touch.
"Of course," Hermione said, closing the book after placing a bookmark with a cat-shaped charm dangling from it, in between the pages. "We're friends, aren't we? I can make some while listening to lectures. It won't take long anyway, since they're so small."
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“But - is it true?” Hermione asked. “That you held hands with Draco and then Lucius left?”
“Take a guess, little brother," Charlie said and nodded towards Ron. “Stand up, so the rest of these rascals can hear.”
"He still thinks he has to fight, doesn't he?"
“I don’t care what people think," Harry said. “Hey, look at me - I’ve been treated like I’m some kind of public property my whole life. No matter what I do, someone’s going to have a problem with it.”
“Certainly,” Theodore said. “Yes, I have nothing but time to stand around here waiting for you to finish wanking each other so you might question me about the murder. I wonder what your supervisor would say if he knew?”
Maybe it wasn’t pride after all that had forced him out of the dorm like that. Maybe the fact was that he was still just a coward, a feeble little thing like the ferret he had gotten turned into in year four. The Amazing Bouncing Ferret… Draco didn’t want to hear Harry telling him he should probably go now. He didn’t want to hear him explain to Ron how ‘this isn’t what it looks like’, and how he had just kissed Draco on a whim, a stupid impulse, just another thing he should have gotten expelled for but wouldn’t because he was Harry Potter. Harry must have realized the reality of it, the reality of getting himself involved with a Malfoy. Draco knew it, he could tell from the way Harry’s expression had changed when Weasley had come barging in all of a sudden.
"Good, good," Skepperus said and started walking back to the front of the classroom, talking as he went. "Next week we will start our short delve into the healing practice of muggles. It's not in the curriculum, but I find that knowing the basics can be very useful to magic-users, should they find themselves in a tricky situation with no wand at hand."
Draco was wearing the clothes from when he had left to visit a Muggle hospital with Potter, where… Draco rubbed his forehead. He could distantly remember a Muggle in a strange, blue outfit, but every time he tried to grasp the memory to figure out what had happened, it blurred and escaped him. He remembered sitting on the floor somewhere with Potter. Draco frowned. It wasn’t like him to sit on the floor, especially in that company. He must’ve remembered it wrong.
“So, uh - what did Weasley say?”
Seamus glanced up at him, and to Harry’s relief he didn’t seem to be bemused by the question.
“Of course I’m sure," Draco huffed.
“What I’m saying is, if they knew, they would send you to a safe house all alone while they tried to work the situation out. Which would take a while, especially since it’s technically unethical to let Harry interfere with a case concerning his father-in-law’s family.”
“You mean when I didn’t shake his hand?”
"I was expecting you to say something more like, 'my father will hear about this'," Harry said.
last Wednesday. You know, the day of the exam where you kind of, freaked out.”
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry said with a mischievous smirk.
The elf looked at him with some kind of bewilderment for a moment and then disapparated.
"Why should it matter, anyway? I'm not a Malfoy anymore."
“Then it’s up to him.”
“Well maybe it is different. But I’m still not going to make decisions based on how some middle-aged wizards who probably haven’t gotten laid in the last decade feel about it.”
Draco let out a breathy whimper, swallowed it down hard and said:
“This was written in the 1860s”, he said as he flipped the page. “It’s about a man who’s too good for the world he lives in.”
Harry sighed and pulled back.
Had everything gone according to plan, the Christmas six years later would’ve been similar. Harry and Draco had agreed to be at the Burrow at five - an optimistic estimate considering Harry usually got home from the Ministry at half past, but Draco was hopeful. He had to be, because today Hermione was finally going to reveal to everyone that she was pregnant, and Draco was anxious to be there and see everyone's reaction.
Draco had only just reached the ground floor again when he ran into Theodore Nott. Again. Only this time, the man looked like he had seen a ghost or quite possibly turned into one. He was coming from the direction of the Caretaker's Office, and stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Draco.
“Oh no," Granger laughed, “they can yell at each other all night long if they want. I have better things to do right now than play family therapist for them.”
“Yeah. He’ll support you on it though. He was mesmerized after listening to one of your speeches. I’m pretty sure you could convince him not to watch Quidditch ever again if you wanted.”
"Fuck, Draco... You feel so fucking good I can't - fuck..."
“Notice the tip of the tail is shaped like an arrow. Charming, yes, but not the most pleasant to be slapped in the face with.”
Lucius’ smile suddenly faded. He looked at Draco, eyes widened in rage, his knuckles white from the force with which he was pressing down on his cane.
"Merlin, you're like a puppy", Draco chuckled (Harry wondered if it meant that Draco found him cute), pulled out his wand and tapped twice on the book. He said something in Russian that Harry would have had trouble trying to find enough consonants for, had he tried to spell it - and then Harry watched as the letters on the spine of the book twisted, changed and rearranged themselves to form a new title. Now, instead of "A Murder on the Thames" it said, "Worst Quidditch Catastrophes in History". Draco handed the book back to Harry and nodded as if to encourage him to open it, and sure enough - the book had changed on the inside, too.
Harry didn't know what to say. Luckily Draco's stomach gave another growl.
Hermione sighed.
“What’s taking so long?” Malfoy asked.
"Baby," Harry blurted out and pulled Draco tightly against himself. "Of course not. I'll beat up anyone who hates you."
“Yes?”
Draco closed his room’s door, and pointing at it with his wand, said: “
This was an angsty one! Chapter 8 will be a lot easier on the feels, I promise. xx
“Urgently,” Neville continued.
When Harry returned to the courtyard, he realized it was already dark and Ron and Hermione had left. Harry headed straight to the dorms. He climbed up to the sixth floor deep in his thoughts and only came to when he realized Larry the Giraffe was staring at him from the painting that guarded the door, this time in his human form. He was a tall, friendly looking man with dirty blonde hair that curled a little bit at his ears.
"Finn?" Harry said.
“Hey-”
"You mean you're hoping my talent will rub off on you," Dean said. Although it made both Seamus and him smile, it was an unfortunate choice of words considering Ron had just decided to face his prejudices and walk back into the living room. An odd sound escaped his throat, and he caughed awkwardly in an effort to cover it up.
“I didn’t know you could grow it out of season,” Draco said, following Neville to the greenhouse opposite of them.
And since it
“Yes sir,” Draco said, smirking as he parted with Harry. He didn’t feel the need to look back at his expression, as it was one he remembered well. It was one that usually led to pleasant situations, but it was possible this time would be different. There was no saying how long all the interrogations would take.
“Well, I guess I try to avoid them as much as...” Harry stopped talking when he realized what Hermione meant. He leaned on his palm and smiled into it.
"Did you now," Malfoy huffed, slurring his words lazily. "I always reckoned you cheated. But you'd never do that, would you? Saint Potter..."
They stood next to the doorway and watched as nurses ran from one room to the next, babies cried and raccoon-eyed parents tried to comfort them. Draco looked wildly uncomfortable. It could’ve had something to do with the fact that for wizards, doctors were “Muggle nutters who cut people up," as Ron had so nicely put it.
“My, goodness me," the woman chuckled. “Tell you what - I’ll take care of this paperwork and meet you on the sixth floor in a bit. We can go to the staff room, it’ll be nice and calm there.”
“Is that for homework?” Asked Harry.
Lucius Malfoy had changed little from when Harry had last seen him. He was still dressed pompously in black robes, cane and everything - only his hair had changed. It had started to turn white in some strands. Other than that, he looked like he had recovered quite well from the war. No more bags under eyes or unkempt stubble on his cheeks.
“And tell mum her son isn’t going to be an Auror? She probably has a picture frame at the ready with ‘Auror Weasley’ engraved on it.”
“If he did, he didn’t tell me," Ron said. “I reckon they were talking about us.” Ron gave a quick, lopsided smile.
"Not to pry, of course, but…"
"I have enough to last me for another six months. After that, I'll get a job." Draco turned back to look at Harry, a sly smile on his face. "I heard they're looking for cleaners at the Ministry."
"Draco," Narcissa says, holding a hand to Draco's cheek. "You did your best. And you were just a boy. You mustn't blame yourself."
“Don’t know.”
To Harry’s surprise, Alohomora worked on the door. It opened quietly enough that Harry’s presence wasn’t immediately revealed. He tried to sneak inside without making any noise, holding his breath as he closed the door behind him. It let out a muffled click, and Harry pinched his eyes closed waiting to hear footsteps coming towards him. None appeared.
Harry tried the door, and as he had already guessed, it was locked. He realized that if the events would follow the patterns of his nightmares, the eyes would come next. Voldemort’s eyes would appear in the vent. Harry decided to get out instead of waiting, and he cast
Harry turned to look at him. It was the first time he had seen Draco laugh like that, not out of mischief. It was nice. His laugh was nice, and... Wait, what?
"We had Magic in Context together last year."
”, Draco read. “
Harry opened his mouth to disagree, but Draco's chuckle silenced him.
Granger shrugged.
"I really hope that you don’t entirely lose what was valuable in these stories to you. If these books taught you that love is the strongest force in the universe, capable of overcoming anything; if they taught you that strength is found in diversity, and that dogmatic ideas of pureness lead to the oppression of vulnerable groups; if you believe that a particular character is trans, nonbinary, or gender fluid, or that they are gay or bisexual; if you found anything in these stories that resonated with you and helped you at any time in your life — then that is between you and the book that you read, and it is sacred. And in my opinion nobody can touch that."
It was snowing in Harry’s room. The air inside had turned cold and dense. Harry was sitting on the floor under his (closed) window, his knees folded against his chest and his arms crossed on top of them. He was holding tightly onto his wand.
“Thirty feet," the Weasley repeated and shook his head with a joyous smile on his face, as if he himself had been in awe at the size of the Hebridean Black.
"Really?" Neville said. "You'd do that? But you're so busy with PoM and everything..."
“Draco," Harry said, “what’s your favourite smell in the whole world?”
“I noticed.”
again to figure out where he was. He found himself crouching inside a very familiar - and very unpleasant - cupboard under a staircase. The place was so frequently featured in his nightmares that Harry had to stop and think on whether he had actually woken up that morning. He then remembered his foolproof method for checking if he was dreaming and looked at his watch twice - it showed 8.30 in the morning both times. Not a dream. Harry wondered if the mirror could have sent him into the past, but quickly decided against it. There was something surreal and claustrophobia-inducing about the space, something subtly but obviously different from the actual memories Harry had of the place.
Hating himself for not standing up for himself or Remus, Draco nodded.
"Oh, I know," Hermione said and flipped the newspaper over.
much about potions," he muttered. “Can't even make Polyjuice Potion.”
"He will understand," Narcissa says. "Good friends want what's best for you."
Harry frowned. He didn’t remember what had happened before.
Draco tried to twist open a jar that contained some type of mushrooms. After trying a couple more times, he sighed and handed it to Harry.
“Well if it isn’t the Potters,” Theodore Nott said. He stood where two hallways met, apparently having stopped there to watch. “You certainly look like you’re enjoying yourselves. I didn’t realize we were to bring our families to work on Christmas.”
stuck in the cupboard under the stairs? He felt terror gather in his chest when he realized he had dreamed it all. The wizards, the dragons and vaults full of gold coins, the friends. Harry tried the door again and startled when he saw a pair of red eyes, pierced by terrifying, black slits that resembled a snake’s pupils, looking through the vent straight at him.
“I just always thought it was appalling that it hasn’t been illegalized yet, so I thought I’d try and do something about it. Although, as an Alchemy major I don’t expect you to agree with me. From a purely magiological point of view it has some fascinating properties.”
“Fuck," Draco said.
Harry didn’t have time to even be amazed at how observant Draco was before he continued talking.
“I’ve been talking to Draco Malfoy," Harry said, forcing the sentence out without inhaling first.
"But - who taught it to you?"
“So you saw someone, anyway? In Hogsmeade? I’m asking because that would be a very good thing. You would have an alibi.”
“Leave," Harry said to Lucius. “Now.”
“Nowhere, really. Had to… pick something up from Hogsmeade.”
“So you’re wondering why there isn’t any speculation now?” Hermione said.
“Hey, where are you-”
Harry smiled.
“No one told me anything, Harry," Hermione said. “And don’t use that tone on me. If there’s something
. Guess I could write something about that being used for minor injuries."
“What do you mean worried?” Harry frowned.
“The dorms building…”
“Yes, we’ve gone all out ever since…" Her eyes fixed back on Draco, perhaps to ponder his resemblance to his father. "Tell me, Draco, how does your family celebrate?”
Draco turned to look at his grandmother.
“Yes," the professor said, staring at Draco over her glasses with a pair of eyes that were milky blue and green, the colour of old ice. “Unfortunately it is not our place to tell him when to stop.”
Harry wasn't sure why, but what he had initially found amusing about Ron's reaction now started to annoy him a little. Wasn't this a little too dramatic?
“No fucking idea to be honest," Harry admitted. “Not listen to a girl cry about her dead ex-boyfriend but other than that, I’m pretty clueless.”
A quiet rattle came about, and Harry realized it was the sound of a key turning in a lock. The drawer was opened and closed. Stumpy footsteps. The door closed.
"If you sign."
lewd”, Harry said.
“I think it stopped working," he said.
“I would have rather been at Charlie’s lecture," Hermione admitted as they all sat down under an enormous oak tree in the courtyard.
“It could be worth it if you found something you really liked…”
Harry made a face that could only be described as a visual representation of “well… damn”.
“What do you mean?”
"I had a panic attack again," Harry said, his nervousness peeking through his tone. "I was the only one who didn't pass. What if…" Harry stopped walking, restlessly shifting his weight from one foot to the other. "What if I just haven't got what it takes? To be an Auror."
“Um, I hope the fuck I don’t," Ron laughed. “That was
Draco nodded.
"Yeah," Draco said, still avoiding eye contact. "From when you woke up. After we all thought you died, I mean."
“Trying to," said Ron and started to tickle Hermione who started to simultaneously giggle and complain that her stomach was hurting.
"Hm?"
Harry couldn't help but smile at the thought of Draco Malfoy as a janitor.
Harry felt a weight on his back as Draco leaned onto him.
“Don’t worry, I won’t.”
Thank you for your patience with this latest chapter! I am currently in the process of moving houses and working at a new job, so it's safe to say things have been rather hectic. And I won't lie - certain statements made by the author of Harry Potter lately really struck a nerve with me and I've found it difficult to allow myself to enjoy the world she created in the current circumstances. But fear not - I have no intention of leaving this work unfinished! To quote Daniel Radcliffe:
"Well, since they weren't snogging in Dean's room, I don't think it's a secret at this point," Harry said and pushed past Ron to get to the door. "I'm going to say hi to them."
"Well, what did you write?"
cold.”
? Am I the only sane person in this room? Besides - since when are you gay, anyway?”
“Could someone tell me what the fuck is going on?”
“Enough?”
“Right then," she said, adopting a wide stance. “The time has come again to test our limits. We have done this before, so I will be brief in my instructions. All spells cast at you during the exam are real and will inflict very real damage upon you. With that being said, the three unforgivable curses are out of limits, as always. You may face a Boggart, a cursed object, a duel with one of my assistants - whatever it is, you have to deal with it and once you have, you send green sparks and I will come evaluate the situation. If not… Well, you send red sparks or alternatively we scrape what’s left of you into a nice urn after the exam.”
“About what?”
“ ‘Kay," Seamus said and placed his palms on his knees, sitting on the edge of the bed, staring closely at Harry. “Look me in the eye.”
“I sent one of my essays to the Daily Prophet," Hermione said as she gathered loose bits of yarn from her lap. “I don’t really know why - there wasn’t a competition going on or anything, but…”
“Something lewd, no doubt”, Harry said as Draco pulled back.
“Hi Larry," Harry said. “
Hermione frowned. “Hmm… So what happened when you drank it?”
“I’ll tell you," Draco said, “but we’re going to get off the floor first.” Draco got up and, having vanished the thin layer of snow still lingering on Harry’s bed, laid down in it on his back and spread his arms. “Come on.”
“Yeah, I’ve noticed," she said. “He won’t admit it, but…”
“Did you tell him what happened?” Draco grinded the leaves into a powder and tossed them into the cauldron that was on the table next to him.
“Tell what?”
Draco and Harry glanced at each other. They both knew it was Skepperus. They heard the soft thumps of his short footsteps come inside.
“Fuck," Draco groaned. He then threw his hands up. “Okay, scratch that - I lied. It was me. I kissed him, he’s probably up in the dorm right now telling Weasley all about it. You should go and ask him yourself.”
“Take that back.”
“He’d have guts showing up there," he muttered as he turned back to his drawing.
Harry’s brows lifted in surprise.
"You're burning up though," Harry mouthed, his lips dragging against Draco's cheek. Draco breathed out in a way that sounded like he was very much trying to hold back from something.
“It’s raining," Harry stated, although there was no way the two wouldn’t have already noticed with the way the rain was pounding against the windows.
“I mean, I told you to come, and you said you would, but, do you want to?”
“You coming, Harry?” Ron’s voice said from the door.
“What offer?” Draco said.
"Then we will have a problem," grandmother Yana said, smiling. "You see, I can't arrange a new heir with the name of Malfoy associated with Potter. You've been appearing on the English newspaper with him like some harlot. Lucius translated for me."
Neville sighed.
Potter took off his uniform jacket that was meant to be worn done-up but Potter never did, revealing a black long-sleeve that despite having the Darthorn symbol on it, obviously wasn’t part of the uniform. Harry rolled up the sleeves, dropped his bag and jacket on the floor and stretched his arms, letting out one of those sounds that people make when they stretch after sitting down for too long. It was at this point where Draco caught himself staring, and quickly turned to look away. He loosened his tie.
"The bi who lived!" He exclaimed, pointing at Harry.
“I think," Hermione started, fiddling with her bracelet, “I think I know what’s troubling him.”
"Were they so different? My parents?"
“She seems to have gotten it into her head that you flirt with her,” Harry said. “Try not to encourage her, will you?”
Harry cast
Eventually he decided to just write "passed out" and find the appropriate treatment. He was flipping through pages of his course material (a thick, black book that almost resembled the Bible in its compact shape and thin pages) when the word "amortentia" flashed briefly in his eyesight. He flipped back a couple of pages and found a chapter called "Treating Patients Under the Influence of Love Potions". He read a couple sentences here and there, trying to find the bit about Amortentia.
Harry was then called to the kitchen to help with some plates, and probably to catch up in private because Merlin knew Harry couldn't reach the top shelves any more Mrs. Weasley could, and Draco was left in the living room alone with Ron.
Harry smiled too.
"Sometimes potions go wrong," Malfoy said, now turning to look at Harry. "You would know something about that. You never were good at potions, were you?"
“A lot of stuff," Harry said. “About what happened during the war and what he’s been up to since then… He’s really changed, you know.”
the tent besides Harry himself - and Harry’s heart dropped when he saw it - was a large mirror in ornate frames. Upon closer inspection it was easily distinguishable from the Mirror of Erised that Harry had first mistaken it for; this mirror had the word “Tnemrot” engraved into the top of the frame, each letter decorated with horrified faces and foul creatures.
“I don’t get it," Draco said, still staring at the card. “This is Luna Lovegood, right? The girl who was… They were keeping her and Mr. Ollivander downstairs. Why would she address the card to you
Just before the bee had flown in, Draco had been listening to Harry talk about how his visit to the Ministry to meet Nymphadora Tonks had went. Well, Draco
"Please, call me Remus. I'm, eh… I'm very well, thank you. And you, Draco? Your father seems quite worried about you."
“Yes?”
Harry's eyes widened.
Harry heard the front door open and quickly crouched behind the kitchen island, wand at the ready. He heard two voices he didn't recognize, talking to each other.
“Oh- hi," Harry said. He threw a quick look at Dean’s room over Seamus’ shoulder, but could see no sign of Dean other than that the room was pretty organized, apart from the bed which was full of CDs and a portable CD-player that, judging by the amount of Kenmare Kestrels stickers on it, belonged to Seamus. Seamus glanced behind him.
"We'll have to set up some kind of waiting list system for tha- did you just call me 'baby'?"
“Well it certainly
Harry and Draco stared at the closed door for a bit after Neville had left.
“Yeah… You know, in case I drop out and don’t find anything better to do”, Ron said, folding up the pamphlet and stuffing it in his pocket.
Ron then went on to imitate what he imagined the Whomping Willow would have sounded like (apparently a voice not too far away from the Howler he had received shortly after the car crash).
“Your father.”
Harry did. He sighed contemplatively and tried to pick good words for his answer, to come across a way to explain everything without talking for too long at once. He eventually settled on something.
“No, Neville-” Harry raised his hand to interrupt Neville’s defense, “I know you wouldn’t do that. It’s true, Draco and I were on a date and then…” Harry’s voice was silenced for a few seconds just by the sheer shift of energy in the room that came about when he had said "date". “Then Lucius showed up.”
Neville raised his eyes from the floor to meet Harry's. He looked tired.
“But, I’m supposed to be back at the quidditch field-”
“I thought we agreed on that already.” Draco rested his weight on his elbows, nudging Harry’s nose with his own.
“He’s not like you.”
"Ah come on," Draco sighed. "I'll hold you so much you'll have a dent around your shoulders, just tell me - I don't suppose he just told you, 'yeah you and the Malfoy kid, makes total sense, when's the wedding?'"
“Oh?” Harry said, raising his eyes to Hermione.
, that one doesn’t have protection in it”, Seamus said.
Remus gave a laugh to Harry's stunned expression.
Draco took the clipping and looked at the cyrillic letters. The language came back to him in fragments and then all at once, though he had to stop once or twice out of the pure confusion of seeing his old family name being mentioned in writing. It had been years since the Prophet had placed any interest in them, probably partly because they didn’t know that the Malfoys had returned to Moscow for good.
Neville was clearly on his way back from class. His knees were stained with dirt, and his sleeves were rolled up, revealing arms dotted by small cuts from the thorns of the magical roses he was tending to at the college greenhouse. Yes, he had told Draco about them, and just about everyone else too who would listen. His eyes settled on Harry and Draco. He looked at them, then at the bee. Then back at them.
"Hi," Ron said and changed positions so that Harry could sit next  to him on the sofa.
Ron raised his hand.
“The Weasley girl," Malfoy repeated. “You two fighting or what?”
"Don't be a fool, Draco. A sick goat is buried, not eaten. I don't wish to see any children from you."
And although Harry was fairly convinced that he would annoy Draco by showing up unannounced, he was surprised with a hug right when he walked through the door. A hug so tight, in fact, that Harry was lifted off of the floor a good inch or so. Harry's heart fluttered as his feet dangled in the air.
Harry, in turn, hid under the blankets.
Malfoy had been avoiding Harry since the Amortentia incident. Harry was sure of this, as he had been without a pair in two Magical Injury classes already. The task of coming up with an excuse for professor Skepperus as to why they hadn’t completed the previous assignment had also been forced on Harry. He had figured professor Skepperus would just give them a little more time and they could try again, but to his horror Skepperus had given them a whole new assignment instead. Harry was anxious to talk about it to Draco in fear that they would both soon fail the class, but Draco was nowhere to be found. Harry had even spent a whole afternoon reading in the courtyard the previous week, hoping that Draco would pass through. He hadn’t.
“He’s locked himself in his room - professor Toadsworth tried to get him to go to the school healer but he wouldn’t, and I don’t really know what happened to him - Toadsworth had only just gotten him out of that mirror when I saw him -”
“It’s not as if I went nuts or anything like that," Harry said, although going nuts described very well what the experience had felt like to him, “I just… Everyone kind of assumed I would be really happy after Voldemort died, you know? And it would have made sense for me to be happy about it, too, but I… I just couldn’t.” Harry quickly looked at the professor just to make sure he hadn’t heard them talking in the back of the class.
Something about Larry’s tone of voice made Harry a little worried, but he didn’t have time to think more on it. He needed to find Hermione and see the postcard for himself.
“I always had bad handwriting.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know about STDs”, Harry said, although now he was feeling like a right fool for not having remembered such a thing existed. “I just didn’t… It just kind of happened.”
Draco thought about a certain pile of sand near Shell Cottage with a house elf and an amulet worth more than all the treasures at Gringotts lying beneath it, and shuddered. An image flashed his mind - an image of a small corpse wrapped up in white linens, dug up from the cold sand and left there. Draco pushed the thought away. Only Harry knew where the amulet was.
"Probably true."
Harry found the classroom, and as he sat down he realized he had arrived just in time. The professor limped in and started talking. It was professor Skepperus, who Harry knew taught the students who were studying to become healers and would eventually end up working at places like St Mungo. Skepperus was short and reminded Harry of Professor Flipwick, except Skepperus looked about as old as Harry had imagined Nicholas Flamel to look. His voice was hoarse and thin, and students were leaning forward in their chairs to better hear what he was trying to say.
“So what now, is he - is he out of the programme?”
"You want to go there?"
," Draco says and Narcissa can see that he's about to cry too.
“And?
Draco frowned and sunk deeper into the uncomfortable feeling that he hadn’t the faintest idea of what was going on. Potter’s hair was pointing out in all different directions, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder how the strands had the strength to stand up on their own like that despite being so long.
“Then it’s that”, Harry said. “It… it
“Oh, professor Skepperus…” he sighed and started looking through one of the shelves, holding his wand in between his teeth as a light source.
“Fuck, I like that,” Harry whimpered. He was close already; he never lasted long like this, and neither did Draco. Judging by the throbbing state of Harry’s erection, whatever Draco said or did next could send him over the edge. Merlin, Draco thought, he looks so good like that...
“You must be quite familiar with dark magic to be aware of this mirror," she said and stood up, her r’s rolling as she spoke. She gave Draco a once-over. “Blonde hair, dressed in black and all this,
Struggling to compose himself, Harry catched some of the excess slick before it dribbled down his thigh, coating a couple fingers in it before shakily pressing them against Draco's entrance. Just to prepare him, Harry slid a finger inside, rousing a soft moan that got caught in Draco's throat as his muscles willingly gave in. Harry carefully added another finger, hungrily taking in Draco's trembling and bitten-back moans, never letting him break eye contact as he fucked him like that for a moment.
Ron knocked on his door. Harry knew it was Ron because Ron's knock was more ceremonial than of any real purpose. As soon as he had knocked once, he opened the door without hesitation and threw himself onto Harry's bed or wherever Harry himself wasn't sitting. Something was different this time. Ron stared at Harry with a face that Harry had seen only once before, when the jinx that was intended for Malfoy had made Ron eat slugs.
“There’s one thing I don’t understand though," Harry said after his friends had scattered and it was only him, Ron and Hermione left in the kitchen. “When Rita Skeeter saw Hermione hug me during the Tournament…”
“That bastard Theo was lurking in the dorm. Said he’d jinx me as soon as I showed my face. Obviously the git wanted to get back at me for what happened earlier”, Draco said as he cumbersomely pulled off the drenched hoodie that had plastered itself onto his arms. “So, I thought I’d come here and ask if I could maybe stay for tonight, but considering all the trouble I just went through, I don’t think I’m taking no for an answer.” Draco sat down on Harry’s bed and started to untie his shoes.
Harry looked at Draco and following his lead, took in a shaky inhale. Draco lifted his index finger.
“Cock," Seamus then said without blinking. Harry frowned and smiled at the same time, not really knowing how to react.
“I know what it says,” Harry interrupted and took the clipping. “There’s more to it. Do you know who the new heir is?”
“No," Harry said.
“Oh, it’s you," Hermione said, peeking from behind the books. She apparently hadn’t noticed Harry’s offer to help her, as she made her way to the desk just fine and put the books down. She then placed her hands on her hips and turned to look at Harry.
It's snowing in London. A rare sight even in December, and Narcissa takes it in as she stares out the window and tries to ignore the Muggle woman with a squirming little toddler who sits next to her. She has missed England and it saddens her that there's nothing for her here anymore. She knows Lucius isn't planning on coming back, and she thinks him wise for that, because in Russia he is what he once was in England, if not more. Everyone knows him and he knows everyone, and they admire him for having served the Dark Lord personally. He has started to invite people over for dinner and Narcissa enjoys it because it reminds her of the way things used to be. But Draco is missing and she doesn't understand what people are saying and she hates it. Well, she
It was Draco Malfoy.
She takes Draco's hands.
"He tagged along when I left the greenhouse. I was so worried someone would kill him! Thanks, guys."
“Hogwarts," Harry said. A grin spread across his face. “Want to know why?”
Seamus looked at him for a moment and said: “There’s a way you can tell, you know.”
“If your mum really in Russia?” He asked.
“Right. Well, you should try to look at your notebook now. Skepperus looks like he’s going to come over here any minute now.”
from me," Hermione said, her voice heavy with an icy undertone.
“Just some… Need to look for something at the library.”
"You can tell?" Ron had an oddly relieved look in his face. "Is it how I dress?"
"Didn't think you'd read it," Harry said. "Besides, if the professor can recognize you from that description, you can't exactly say I'm wrong."
“Where are we now, Harry?” Draco asked.
"And do you not?" Remus asked.
"What about my parents? Will they be taken care of?"
"That's amazing" Harry said, earnest as he turned his gaze back to Draco.
“Actually," Draco said, and Granger wheeled around to look at him. “Could you… Could you use coffee as an example in the article? For the Amortentia.”
"I guess you do have that Quidditch and beer straight guy look," Dean said, "but no, I can tell because you've been with Hermione for three years. That would be a long time to pretend to like boobs."
"I love it," Harry said. "Thank you."
Harry frowned, struggling to wrap his head around the conversation.
Harry blinked.
“Let’s hear it then”, Harry said. “Say something in Russian.”
“Oh?” Draco said. “Where?”
“I can’t let her lose focus. This is serious.”
It didn’t take Draco long to add two and two together. He got a sudden sinking feeling.
“What the hell are you sneaking around here for?”
Seamus was the same as before, Harry noticed, despite the recent - or not so recent, who knew - development of events. He was still the same, cheerful guy with a charming accent.
"We should get the Wadjet first," he said quietly. "It's too close to Shell Cottage."
“Uh- yeah," Harry laughed. “Obviously.”
"With your mother," Remus said, turning to look back at Harry. "I'm sure you're tired of everyone telling you how much you resemble your father, so I will say this much - you have more of Lily in you than just the eyes."
"I won't permit it," she chokes out.
“What - what do you mean stopped working?”
“Lastly, as you’ve without a doubt been told before, these challenges have been chosen for each of you based on your weakest points in last year’s final exams. You’ve had the summer to improve on these areas, and I trust you will all prove to me that you have done so. Now," she said, clapping her hands together, “any questions?”
“What?” Draco said. “No, I do, I just-”
“This is probably a really bad moment to ask you out," Harry said as the noise faded.
“Anyway, I followed Skepperus after his last lecture. I saw him go into his office and come back without the book.”
Draco was satisfied to notice Harry’s expression shift. He was now getting angry.
"What?"
“But it’s not like you wanted to do any of those things-”
"I wish I wasn't anyone," Harry said.
“So is that why Ginny broke up with you? Because you’re gay?”
The cheapest room at the Three Broomsticks was tucked away in the very back of the first floor, which overlooked the pub from behind wooden railings. Draco remembered frequenting the pub during his Hogwarts years, and he recalled especially well the feeling of looking up at the first floor and wondering what kind of people they were - the ones who came to visit Hogsmeade and stayed a while. The village contained nothing out of the ordinary, apart from Honeydukes and the charm that was unique to quaint little places like these in the mountains, especially in the winter due to the heavy snowfall. This was not the case with the Southern parts of the United Kingdom, where rain and mist reigned during the winter months. Had it been a place for Muggles, the snow might have been a point of interest in itself. To wizards, of course, such a thing was much more trivial, and as Draco was sitting there, on the wide windowsill of that cramped chamber and looked at the snowflakes falling down, he came to a realization. He was now one of the visitors in Hogsmeade, and that had made him none the wiser. There was no knowing if all the other visitors had felt so vague and lost, too. Perhaps it was a resting place for those who wandered, either as a hobby or because they had no other choice.
"Neville-about last night-"
“I don’t really remember," Harry admitted. “It’s been what, nine years?”
“Whose owl is that?” He asked as he met eyes with Huxley. Possibly Hugo.
"Right."
“Well don’t be silly lad," Larry laughed. “I saw you practically carry Mr. Malfoy up the stairs that night!”
“Really?” Harry laughed. “Why didn’t you?”
Harry waited for Ron to start leafing through his Charms book and then wrote:
Realizing Draco was very close, Harry didn't stop drowning Draco in the sounds of his own pleasure and praise.
Draco rose to his knees and pulled his shirt over his head. He could feel Harry’s eyes following his movements. Harry was biting his lip.
“All the bullshit I came up with to make your life more difficult than it already was," he said. “And everything I could’ve done to make it easier but didn’t.”
Even in Russian, the word rang more wrong in Draco's ears more than it had ever before.
“Wait, what?” Harry said, not really knowing whether to worry or laugh.
The walls of Skepperus’ office were lined with bookshelves, each of them jam-packed full of books that looked about as ancient as the man himself. Apart from the writing desk that stood in the middle of the room, and a narrow closet in the corner that looked like it probably contained extra robes, there was no other hiding place for the notebook.
"Doing what?"
“Things going south with the Weasley girl?”
“But," Draco said, “That's not what- I dragged you here to listen to me wailing about my problems like some-”
"Well I don't, I don't really know if I'd call it a crush. I just really, like him."
"Bellatrix killed a lot of people," Draco says with a brushing off-tone.
Draco tilted his head. Brightest witch of her age, huh? More like brightest witch, period.
"Hm?"
“We could take a nap in my room," Ron said innocently, and Hermione gently poked him on the nose.
“Keep what up? Being seen together?” Harry couldn’t help but feel a little bit offended. “Are you saying we shouldn’t?”
Malfoy shook his head.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, dropping his bag at the door and went to sit next to Ron, wrapping him up in a hug before he had time to answer. “Did something happen with Hermione?”
“What happened to Potter?”
“Am not,” Draco said, giving a scoff that unfortunately came out too small to be taken seriously. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
"He's a good person. I wish you could see that."
"Well done," Draco said.
“Ah, so it
“Your dad's Russian?” Harry asked, his brows lifting.
“Why, of course it is," Larry chuckled. “So, as I was saying - I heard Miss Granger and Mr. Longbottom talking about you two.”
Draco rolled his eyes but seemed unable to contain his smile as he leaned down. Just as he was about to kiss Harry, Harry raised his arm and gently tugged at Draco's hair at the back of his neck.
"Because- Because Seamus was snogging Dean in the living room when I walked in."
“Easy for you to say," Ron said. He sighed. “Sorry.”
Grandmother Yana hadn't changed a bit. She must've been close to ninety years of age but she barely looked seventy. Gray hair that let down would have been tailbone-length, was piled up on top of her head in an old-fashioned bun. She was wearing purple robes that Draco knew were expensive even from a distance, and she was wearing that smile that she always did when she was politely, venomously dealing with something unpleasant.
Narcissa looks at her son and feels her heart break. All in one big crack, and she's left floating in the aftermath, powerless.
“You look good," Harry said, and gave his best weary smile.
“Yeah,” Draco said. It was only now that he noticed the knocking on the window.
The rain had caught Harry and Draco by surprise, and by the time either of them had managed to charm an umbrella existence, they were both completely soaked. The sea wind was harsh that night, ruthless, and Draco had to turn his back to it just to be able to breathe. If there was such a thing as the appropriate weather to be digging around at old graves, this wasn’t it. Draco cast
"No I don't," Seamus said. "I use it to flatter you."
“I just realized," Harry said, barely containing his smile, “that when you go, Neville will be the only straight guy left in the dorm.”
Draco pulled Harry closer with the leg that was hooked around Harry's lower back, and with his hand, guided Harry inside him. The sensation silenced both of them for a second - Draco was hot and slick and so tight around him that Harry's toes curled and a groan escaped him.
Her name was Guinevere Harding, but everyone called her Gwen. She was on the shorter, rounder side as far as body types go, and there was a buoyancy in the way she walked from one place to the next that made everyone watching jealous of her good spirits. And if that wasn’t yet enough, well - she also had freckles on her nose.
"Alright, cover your ears. It's best none of you know where we stopped on the way."
"See, it turned out all wonky again!" Seamus crumpled up the piece of parchment, now decorated with something that could best be described as a stick figure during an earthquake, and tossed it over his shoulder into a pile of crinkled paper that was apparently the result of several hours of work.
"I once saw father deny an offer of twelve million galleons for this," Draco said as he knelt in front of Dobby's grave.
"Prat."
"It's true," Draco said. "For the most part. It said Harry and I were having coffee because I wanted to apologize to him."
"You're warm," Draco said as he wrapped his arms around Harry. They stood like that for a while, just holding each other, and in the freezing wind it felt like the two of them were a pair of penguins huddling together to shield against the weather. "Which film are we seeing?" Draco asked.
Harry smiled.
“It was only a moment after I had interviewed Mr. Scamander, whom I had also invited here that day. He left my office and ran back in a few minutes later, pale as a ghost. He said he had found Toadsworth laying in the corridor, lifeless.”
Harry circled behind Draco and grabbed his other hand just in time. Draco's fingers had already curled around the wand in his pocket.
Draco shifts his weight from one foot to the other, and Narcissa reads this as promising hesitation.
“I don’t think he really wants to be an Auror.”
“It’s Harry," Weasley said, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, looking deeply uneasy. “He… It’s kind of a long story, but he’s not doing very well, and I-”
All of a sudden Harry realized the nickname wasn't derived from the first letter of Dean's name. He immediately decided it was urgent to go see if anyone was in the living room.
"Fuck you! Fucking faggot, I'll get you for this-"
Harry was bad at guessing.
“Hungry?” Harry asked after letting out a content yawn. Draco tried to answer but the yawn passed on to him, making his arm tense up under Harry’s shoulder. Harry shifted to release Draco’s arm and he stretched it, no doubt to encourage some much needed blood flow.
Draco nodded. He hesitated for a few seconds and then signed his new name under the documents.
“And you liked it”, Draco said. “Didn’t you?”
Harry was more surprised by how long it had taken Draco to ask than the question in itself. After that first kiss they had been sort of going along with it, worried (or at least that much was true for Harry) that words would ruin it, scare the other one away. Because this wasn’t a simple thing. Or maybe, despite the circumstances, it was.
The words hit Draco hard, and for a moment it felt like everything he had been bottling up would burst out of him any second now. His eyes wandered the floor.
“Weasley's not wrong, you know.”
Harry started to smile as he came to think of something.
“Calm down," Harry said. “I’ll get us out of here.”
“I am.”
“Green apples," Draco said without hesitation. “And- and, the way the air smells when it thunders, you know that, that heavy, electric smell that’s also kind of ominous… And…” Draco looked around, as if he was looking for something.  “It’s something different…”
Harry held the door open for Neville as they entered the narrow, spiralling staircase that was occasionally interrupted by a small landing, each of them decorated with a portrait that was actually a door to the dormitories. Their footsteps echoed.
“Darling is the password, you cretin," Draco snarled, rolling his eyes. “Let’s go.”
They stood in front of the grave, the cold mists of the ocean wind blowing against them. The sky was gray and dark, the waters treacherous and uninviting.
"I will hear no complaints about it! The rule is absolute. It's bad enough that I'm veering from the curriculum. I don't need ten Ministry officials on my back after one of you accidentally uses magic in the middle of a hospital."
“Maybe you should obliviate him.”
"You've got to be fucking kidding me," he said. "Do you know how hard it is to hit something that size? Besides, you're the one who killed Voldemort-" Draco didn't get to finish his sentence because the bee, Merlin it was big, tried to come close to him and he threw himself down from the bed to escape it.
“Scars," Draco said and turned to look at the notebook. “Which date should we put as the new due date?”
“Yes, he… Yes. Very.”
"Were you dropped on your head as a kid? You and me. Like, how bad was it?"
We're nearing the end of our story with a chapter filled with smut and holiday cheer! In August! Let the Christmas feast begin.
“Then you’re thicker than you look. I don’t care what they say about him retiring, he doesn’t have it in him.”
. What on Earth?
close.”
"You too," Draco said, his fingers gently brushing past Harry's lips. "Merlin, this is sappy..."
leather jacket, Harry.”
“A pamphlet for maintenance jobs in the Ministry”, Ron said. “Dad gave me this. Said they’re hiring.”
Draco looked at Harry with an expression that should have been reserved for looking at Quidditch accidents as they happened.
“Maybe,” Harry said and looked up at Draco. The tone in his voice was out of place considering it was murder they were discussing.
“He was back," Harry mouthed against Draco’s shoulder. “He was back and I wasn’t there - and no one believed-” His voice got caught in his throat and it sounded like he was trying not to burst out sobbing.
"Two questions," the woman said, her eyes inspecting the corners of the lavishly decorated room as if she hadn't visited it in a long time. She probably hadn't - there were plenty of similar rooms in her mansion. "Same answer." Her eyes returned to Draco, now equipped with an unnerving squint.
"Did the mandrake keep you awake? I tried everything, but it just wouldn't-"
Harry laughed.
Harry handed Draco the handful of snakes he had picked up. Their hands briefly touched and Harry saw Draco flinch a little bit.
Draco frowned.
Harry blinked and felt police sirens go off in his head. He had completely forgotten about the exam.
“Fucking Muggles…” Draco sat down and shook his head. “Unbelievable. And Pansy looked so pretty today… Could’ve stayed with her. And now I’m stuck in a Muggle hell machine with you. Should have stayed with her....”
“A what?” Harry said.
"And how exactly did you figure that out after asking me - what, two questions?"
"Good point. Good point…"
“I mean," Harry said, “you did destroy several Horcruxes.”
“What?” Draco said. He leaned in and murmured against Harry’s ear. “You wish you could fuck me right here against the wall, huh?”
Harry shrugged.
wasn’t it? Harry took a deep breath and stepped into the reflection.
"So, how is school?" Remus asked as if he had known what Harry was thinking.
“If you apologize to me again I swear I’ll make you regret it.” Harry could tell from Draco’s tone of voice he wasn’t as shaken as Harry had feared.
been important. If Harry had just listened…
“It’s nothing really," Neville said, “or at least, not as if it’s any of my business, but… Why was Draco Malfoy in your room the other night?”
Just as Harry was about to open the letter, there was another knock on his window. Confused as to why everyone had decided to owl him on the same day, Harry went to the window.
"Figures," Malfoy said. "Some of these wankers couldn't pick up a tissue from the floor without levitating it."
Remus nodded.
Harry grinned.
“I wanted to talk to you," Harry said.
"I don't know. I just… I used to be so into this. The exams and studying and..."
“But you
“Oh," Draco said. “I didn’t know they’re still visible.”
“Well-”
“On the first day at Magical Injury," Draco said, realizing he had forgotten to give Harry any kind of context as to what he was talking about.
Draco had completely forgotten around the wedding, but now that he was reminded, he too started to see the severity of the situation for Rolf and Luna. They had sent Harry and Draco an invitation, too, and to Draco’s horror the date for the celebration had been set to February 14th. Was there anything more kitsch than a wedding on Valentine’s Day? Or maybe it was that the uncomfortable feeling Draco had gotten while reading the invitation hadn't been because of the disapproval of his (undeniably) superior taste, but because in that moment, he had envied the couple for their sentiment. Either way, there would be no such wedding if the murder wasn’t solved, fast.
"Poor bastard, your father really told you nothing, did he?" Grandmother Yana seemed to enjoy Draco's grim expression. "Well, Lucius
"For sure..." Another camera click.
Harry smiled, and the smile soon widened so that he was beaming.
“You mean, on the train?”
“Oh hell no”, Ron interjected, getting up.
It was already towards the end of the lecture when Harry remembered the conversation he had had with Neville the previous night.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was one of those days, and there had been a lot of them lately, where they just cuddled and ignored homework and were stupid together. Harry pulled all sorts of stunts to make Draco feel better after what had happened with his mother and much to Draco's surprise, it actually worked. Not like a charm or a potion, not even like a proper distraction because Harry was always asking questions, encouraging him to talk about it, all of it, his parents and his life and everything that had gone wrong. This baffled Draco, because who would actually want to listen to someone complain and feel sorry for themselves? Well, Harry apparently did, and Draco couldn't help but feel quite grateful for it.
Black signs of aging had settled into the corners of the golden frame.
Granger tilted her head.
"Oh fuck," Draco breathed, his back arching, fingers digging into Harry's back. Not yet confident it was okay for him to move, Harry stuttered:
“I still can’t believe he didn’t learn his lesson after what happened with Norbert,” Hermione sighed.
“Date… What do you do on a date?”
“I suppose Scamander would have noticed the body on the way in, if Toadsworth had been killed just as she had left your office.”
“I trust Scamander is still in the castle?”
“And yet, here we are”, Harry said. “What did you come up with?”
Harry had taken part in many awkward and tense breakfasts in his lifetime, but this… this was something else. Remus was sitting across the table from Harry and Draco, one leg crossed over the other, a mug of tea in his hands. He kept giving Harry these glances where he looked like he was about to say something, but then he pressed his lips together as if holding back laughter.
“Everyone who was here is a suspect,” Harry said.
“Well, Seamus said he has it on good authority that you two… You and Malfoy, you know… Did the
"Please, Draco," Narcissa says. "Hasn't this argument between you and Lucius gone on for long enough already? There's nothing for us here anymore."
was a Muggle prison in Moscow that hid under it one of the most high-security wizard prisons in the world.
He was fine with the thought of not being straight, but he also remembered how Ron had reacted when he had found out about Dean and Seamus’ relationship. Gross, he had said. Harry got scared and tried to turn back, return to the Harry that hadn’t just kissed Draco in his thoughts, but it was too late.
"You don't know what kind of resources that family has," Draco said under his breath, glancing at the Weasleys, who were all watching the silent conversation. "If my father is at all involved, he could have found a magical object or spell that can track it. For all we know, it could already be too late. We have to get it while Bill and Fleur and the children are still here."
“At first I wanted to figure you out," he said. “I’ve always wanted to figure you out. And then when I did, when I started to get to know you better, I… I just couldn’t stop thinking about you.” Harry glanced at Draco and even in the dark and without his glasses, could still see that Harry's answer had made him none the wiser. “You’re funny," Harry continued to explain. “You can pick up when I’m being sarcastic and you don’t tell me to cheer up when I just want to complain. And, as you said, you’re good-looking. I mean, you were always good-looking, but when I saw you on the first day of Magical Injury, it was just… Ridiculous. Your hair was messy, you looked so, devil-may-care, and I couldn’t stop staring.”
“What’s this from?”
"Then they won't be able to move from sun to shade when they want to... I don't have the heart to do it. And anyway, they feel like friends now. Had them like this all summer when I was at Cuddlebogs," Neville said.
“I won’t tell him if you don’t want me to, but I honestly don’t see the point. We aren't children anymore. You’re allowed to be friends with whoever you want as long as they’re not hurting you.”
“As a way to conceal it?”
"He seems to believe that deep down, everyone is a good person," Draco continued.
He leaned into Harry, letting his hips settle at a grind that barely provided enough friction for either of them - he had learned to do so, not to give it his full effort all at once, because he wanted, he needed to hear Harry come undone in the unbearable anticipation, to have him beg for more, to tease him until he couldn’t take it anymore. Seemingly unaware of the scheming that was taking place, Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth as their erections were momentarily pressed together, an agonizing amount of fabric still in between. Before Draco had even had time to fully enjoy the reaction, he felt rogue fingers slide past the waistband of his boxers. Harry hadn’t even touched Draco as before his body already tensed at the thought of his aching erection finally getting some attention - and then it did, and a strangled moan was left a mere growl in his throat as it was received by Harry’s tongue and left unfinished, and for a moment Draco was enveloped in the warmth of Harry’s hand, his touch firm but dragging, teasing at the edges - and then it was Draco, not Harry, who suddenly found himself coming undone.
“Lewd? Me?” Draco smiled, his canine teeth showing. One was pointier than the other, Harry noticed.
Draco lifted his head from Harry's shoulder and looked at him.
“Well, anyway," Hermione said and stood up, “I should go. I’ll try to find Neville at the Owlery to see what’s taking him so long, and then I’ll have to start working on a few assignments.”
"Young master Black will not mind if I depart now?" Ksenia said.
“Shh," Hermione said softly and petted Harry’s hair. “It’s going to be okay. Ron will understand.”
“Then let’s go to my room.”
"You're letting me distract you," Draco said and pulled back a little bit so he could see Harry. "When did you eat?"
“I know. I know that’s how you see it, but you don’t know the whole story. You don’t know what he went through.”
"How is she?"
“But why did you take it with you? You hate leeches.” Harry watched as Huxley eagerly accepted Draco’s offering and downed it in one bite.
clear and you can see every grain of sand and every little creature and you just want to dive. And you know you shouldn't jump because it's cold and people are waiting for you at the shore, but... you want to see what's down there and pretend you're one of them, a fish or a little shrimp who doesn't know anything about the human world and can see colours we can't."
“I really wasn’t my place to say you don’t want to be an Auror," Harry sighed.
“Something just happened to me where I didn’t really feel like myself anymore," Harry then continued, fiddling restlessly with his pencil. “I was panicking all the time for no reason and didn’t really sleep until they put me on Calming Draughts at the hospital.”
As Harry pushed open the heavy door that guarded the exit to the roof, the two felt a welcome, cool breeze greeting them. It was one of those days where it was sunny one minute and cloudy the next, and shadows of clouds passing by were calmly floating across the roof. It was apparent that the charms that made Darthorn suitable to wizard tastes didn’t extend to this place, as it looked like it was made out of nothing but concrete and gray metal, two very essential features when it came to Muggle architecture, Draco had noticed. He didn’t understand nor enjoy it, but over the years he had gotten a little more interested in who he was with as opposed to where he was.
“He did," Hermione said. “It was from Luna.”
“You are permitted to cast
, but that’s not what happened. It should’ve been obvious-”
Granger looked up at Draco.
Harry didn’t want to think, he didn’t want to talk about it, he wanted to go just far enough so it would be too late to even think of turning back or pretend nothing had happened - he leaned in and kissed Draco, and Draco kissed him back, open-mouthed, his fingers curling into Harry’s hair. Harry felt a soft moan escape him when Draco pulled him closer, and without really giving it a second thought Harry climbed on top of Draco, straddling him. Harry felt lightheaded, it was so good, too good - he felt Draco’s tongue in his mouth, and then-
“Okay, just - keep your voice down, okay? I don’t need everyone knowing you’re here.”
"I didn't even know about wizards until the day before I went to Hogwarts. Aunt Petunia always told me my parents died in a car crash."
“Did you know ‘Mione and Draco talked yesterday in the courtyard?” He finally said, his voice still raspy from the sleep (or lack thereof).
“Why do you rip them out?” He asked. “The pages. Aren’t you worried that you’ll want to read the book again at some point?”
“I wasn’t going to say anything," Larry said, “but I’ve noticed that you’ve taken a special interest in Mr. Malfoy ever since that night he stayed in your room-”
Draco and Harry stared in silence as Seamus closed the door behind him. They heard his whistling echo in the staircase.
“Have you
"What do I call you now? If you want, I can stick with Malfoy, but I wasn't sure if that would be awkward..."
"Merry Christmas - Bloody hell, that's something I never thought I'd hear you say," he laughed. "Want to play chess?"
“Looks good,” he said. “If a bit heavy on the Mandrake.”
Malfoy glanced at the tattoo.
“No matter,” Neville said. “She’s old, and with every passing year she gets nastier. And recently her memory’s started failing… I just can’t deal with it all right now. I’d rather be here now that it’s calm, for once. Silent.”
"Ooh," Harry nodded. "Wouldn't it be easier to just transfigure them back to normal pots?"
Draco attacked before Harry could brace himself. They wrestled and played like neither of them had ever had the chance to do as kids, laughing themselves silly before eventually falling asleep in a tangled mess of hairy legs and arms.
It's only when an essay about the misuses of Amortentia is published on the Daily Prophet that Narcissa and Lucius start to suspect the Parkinson girl wasn't lying after all with her ridiculous claims about Draco disappearing and then being seen at school the next day as if the Amortentia had had no effect on him at all. The essay is written by Hermione Granger and in it, she mentions coffee being used to disguise the scent and taste of the potion. The timing, the coffee, it's all too much to be mere coincidence, and Lucius starts to grind his teeth and mutter that the Potter boy must have something to do with it. Narcissa tries to calm him, to assure him that Draco would have never associated with someone like him and especially not the Granger girl, but even to her the idea doesn't seem so unthinkable as it would have a few years ago.
“He talks about me?”
"Because you know it's not true! He was just upset, you know what he's like- he didn't mean it."
“Ah,” Neville said. “Let’s go to number six instead. I have a patch of Knotgrass in here.”
Draco cocked his brow.
“I had hoped he would find another kind of meaning. Like I did.”
“You’re soaking wet”, Harry said as he closed the window behind Draco. “Why didn’t you come through the door?”
None of the students knew the answer, and it turned out neither did Charlie.
“No," Draco said. “I’ll come up with a plan.”
“Dursleys?”
“Yeah… Guess he kind of needed you around.” Draco let out a faint sigh. “Although, he didn’t expel me either when… when I tried to…”
“No, Ron, it really isn’t," Harry said and started to feel a little flustered.
"You never were good at scolding me," he says.
“I had to get this done at a Muggle place”, Draco said, vaguely swaying his arm. The one with the tattoo Harry had seen a few nights ago. “I was scared shitless. They do it with needles and - I’m pretty much I passed out for a minute at some point. Don’t think the guy noticed it though.”
“Mother was on my side after the trials when I said I didn’t want anything to do with their business anymore, Dark magic or anything else. She agreed. Said it would be better to keep our heads down for a while. I was studying to retake some N.E.W.Ts and for a while things were pretty peaceful. Then I started talking about going to Darthorn and father went ballistic. He insisted I go to some more esteemed college that isn’t so pro-Muggle, and when I told him I didn’t really agree with that ideology anymore, he kicked me out and erased me from his will. Simple as that.”
"About how I ended up sleeping in the same bed with Draco?"
“I don’t remember asking for your opinion. And I don’t remember asking you to show up out of nowhere in my room, either," Harry snarled.
Harry quickly jumped in to fill the silence.
“No idea. To be honest, I’m more baffled by how much I’ve slept in the last 24 hours.” Draco’s stomach rumbled again. Harry smiled.
"Are you asking?"
“Thirty-seven Muggles obliviated," he said, making Harry squeal in laughter.
“Yeah," Harry said. He glanced around the room. Everyone was staring at him. “Does someone have a problem with that?”
“I’ve heard this before. Just tell me when it’s finished.”
“No, I- I will, but just…” Draco stuttered and looked away. “I’m sorry I called you that. I was a - Harry’s right, I wouldn’t - I’m sorry.”
“More like the face of I just told my best friend he’s a dick who won’t graduate," Harry  said.
“You can't tell her!" Draco insisted with more passion than Harry had ever heard in his voice. "She wouldn't get it," Draco said and continued rocking back and forth. "She'd say I'm- She'd think - And she can't, because I love her!"
“Do you…” Draco started and glanced at the ceiling. “Do you want me to help you study?”
"I told you about it. About the presentation I did with Dean."
“Nothing important happened," Draco said after a minute or so of silence. “I told her to piss off and never talk to me again. I’m good at that sort of thing.”
"Dean told me in the summer."
Harry drowned Draco in wanton, deep kisses and felt himself get increasingly hard as Draco pulled the T-shirt off of him, leaving him shirtless and powerless against the blazing sensation that trailed after Draco's every touch. Harry bit back a breath that had almost escaped him as a moan as fe felt their erections press together when Draco hooked his leg around him.
It was already dark when Harry heard a quiet clink from his window. He thought he had imagined it, but then he heard it again. Harry put down the comic he had been reading, got up and saw a small paper crane poking at his window while flapping its wings frantically. Harry quickly opened the window to let it in, and the crane fluttered onto Harry's bed before going limp. Harry took it into his hands and noticed it was all damp from the rain. He carefully unfolded it, trying not to tear the paper. There was something written on it.
“I don’t want you to go," he said. They had been in the same school for ten years and despite the odd disagreement here and there, Harry wasn’t anywhere near ready to let go of that.
She breathed out smoke and looked at the parchments one last time before rolling them up.
“Right," Draco said. “You’re mental, you know that? And what exactly about a skinny, bratty bloke who’s a foot taller than you makes you go, ‘oh, cute’?”
Draco finds himself wishing for some peace and quiet, preferably in a room with Harry, alone and with a silencing spell on the door. Is that really so much to ask?
Harry snorted.
They walked in an awkward silence. Harry didn’t know what to say - he couldn’t tell Draco why he had been crying without ruining everything and Draco would definitely see through any excuse he tried to make.
“I’m no holy joe but seeing as we didn’t get much of a sex education at Hogwarts”, Seamus explained, “I figured that as the one who discovered your bi-ness, your gay uncle if you will-”
“Did I get you this worked up earlier?” Draco said, his mind scrambling for the right buttons to push, for some purchase on the situation. The truth was that deep within his mind, married or not, there was still only one thing that could drive him over an edge, to abandon all efforts of restraint, and that was being second best to Harry Potter. And he had no intention of doing that.
Draco chuckled.
"It's not as good as it sounds," Draco said. "If you get stabbed while wearing this, you still get stabbed. You still bleed out, you still feel the pain, you just never die."
“The interrogation. Was it that bad?”
"I thought you were in the alchemy programme."
“He didn’t speak English, so in time I learned Russian from him. And dad’s family spoke Russian to me, although they never really cared much for children.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked at the amulet. Whatever beauty he had seen in it had now faded into an ominous gleem.
"Finn, I need a break," Dean said, rubbing his temples.
The Muggle houses started to blow up, one by one. Draco watched, horrified, as fire and smoke devoured the city. It was his fault, it must've been his fault, he was always thinking about how awful Muggle architecture was - and then he jolted awake and realized someone was banging on the door.
Ron came home when it was already starting to get dark. He was greeted at the door by Neville who was on his way to the Owlery. Ron asked him how Harry was doing, and Neville said he hadn’t seen Harry that afternoon. This worried Ron, so he peeked into Harry’s room to see if Draco had maybe left a note on where they had gone. Instead of a note Ron saw Harry and Draco asleep in each other’s arms. Very carefully, he closed the door and turned to look at Hermione who had just appeared from behind the portrait.
“He did?” Harry said. “I don’t remember that at all. Why would he have laughed?”
“What went wrong last time?” Harry asked.
“Saturday around noon. We’ll meet downstairs.”
“There’s spells for that?” Ron said, reluctantly sitting back down.
Ron made a choking sound as it must have dawned on him what role Draco had played in the act.
“Oh, I don’t think so," Draco said, now turning to look at his father. “See, I’m in kind of in the middle of something.”
“Agreed”, Harry said. “We did use one. A spell, I mean. Well, Draco did, but I didn’t… Exactly pay attention.”
“Then we must leave now,” Harry said, putting his hand in the pockets of his winter uniform trench coat. “If someone is after us, I’d rather not have their search lead here.”
They looked at each other. Neither one moved.
“Well… yes," Draco said, trying not to smile.
“Myself, for sure," Harry nodded, “but this isn’t about me. Aurors have this whole protocol you’re supposed to stick to - like, say, a woman comes up to you asking for help, saying she’s been cursed but nothing looks or sounds like there's something obviously wrong with her, so you have to find out what’s going on. There’s a certain set of questions you’re supposed to ask someone like that, and a set course of action depending on what they answer.”
“I’m not," Harry said. He tried to, but he just couldn't look Ron in the eyes. He was still trying to process the fact that he had kissed Draco and Draco had kissed him back instead of jinxing him.
“What are they?”
“Best not answer”, Dean said.
“I would’ve given you a ten if you hadn’t left out the time Hermione punched you.”
"I'm not surprised Lucius never mentioned him," Yana said matter-of-factly. "They never got along, you see. Of course, Adrik was already in
Draco smiled, heavy-lidded, leaned over and murmured something against Harry’s ear. Harry didn’t understand it, but the foreign sounds in Draco’s voice, his breath tickling as it travelled down to Harry’s neck, it all sent an army of shivers down Harry’s spine.
“How’s that class going by the way? The one where they make you sit with Malfoy.”
"Can I..."
“I don’t believe you. Those ruddy Muggle doctors did something to me, didn’t they?”
“But Harold is watching”, Harry protested.
"Hm?"
“I think you know full well,” Harry started, pausing only to try and catch his breath, “that coming up with sentences is damn near impossible when someone is buried to the hilt inside of you.”
“I would guess he does.”
“Thought I’d ask you what the hell is taking so long,” Theodore said. “They told me Potter went straight to re-inspect the body.
“Ready? Like hell I am.”
“What a git," Harry huffed. “And you have to live with that guy?”
“Not really,” Gwen said. “Almost everyone was a part of the regular staff. Although, it surprised me that Mr. Nott was here, too. Apparently tending to the dragon incident.”
“So, I had a question about poisonous candles," Draco rushed to say.
interesting.
Mr. and Mrs.Weasley were proud to say that they were not only the parents of the famous Weasley twins of Diagon Alley, but also of a daughter playing chaser for the Holyhead Harpies and a son in the Auror training programme at Darthorn College, thank you very much. They had never been so proud of Ron, and the young man was regurarly reminded of this by little baskets of muffins and scones that his poor owl valiantly delivered to the dormitory every Monday. The basket always came with a note that contained some variation of the following: your father and I are so proud, send hugs to Hermione and Harry, aunt/cousin/father's colleague so and so asked about you and was absolutely thrilled to hear about the programme, don't you dare eat all of these yourself, please write to us soon, your father and I are so proud.
“Yeah.”
"When was that time - do you remember, when the Bludger chased me?"
“And when he doesn’t find it,” Harry said, now stepping closer to Draco, “he’s going to come looking for the only person he knows for sure had the amulet at one point.”
"No. To be honest, I was expecting something more like… getting turned into a duck."
His new name sounding odd in his ears, Draco nodded and said absently, his mind already scanning for places where Harry could have gone:
“No, I believe you,” Draco said, shrugging. “I do.”
"So, this is where he grew up, eh? Not the prettiest place..."
“Oh, no, it was - it went very well.” Theodore’s eyes then fixed somewhere below Draco’s neck, and he glanced down to see if he had messed up the buttons, but nothing was out of place. Admittedly, the shirt was a bit wrinkly. Maybe he had a hickey? Merlin, he hadn’t had one of those in... well, months, if not years.
“Like, on a date.”
“Chaser, right?”
“Yeah," Draco said. “I remember being so salty about it… I kept telling everyone it wasn’t true since the Weasleys probably couldn’t afford a car in the first place. You know how sometimes you just, want to have a little chat with your past self and-”
It was Harry.
“Yes,” Harry said, turning Draco’s hand in his own like a healer inspecting a wound, “and no. She seemed very ordinary. Well, for a dead person. But it bothers me that she didn’t have anything in her pockets.”
on crack?”
Draco's chest felt heavy with the knowledge that his family seemed rotten down to the roots.
Harry nodded.
Harry cleared his throat a little. Ron shifted on his chair restlessly.
Harry felt his heart skip a beat.
Draco was obviously nervous about being on a Muggle elevator. He was constantly picking at his neck and leering at the walls like a caged animal. It wasn’t a new elevator either - it let out a horrible, squeaking noise every time they passed another floor. Harry felt the whole cabin shake as they finally stopped. They waited, but the doors didn’t open.
“What about Magizoology? You know a lot about dragons.”
"Well, I'm not going to pretend that isn't on my to do-list," Harry admitted, making Draco laugh, "but there's more to it than just that."
“This is my last case,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t even have taken it if-”
"We're not going to get that far if you keep talking like that," Harry muttered as Draco freed his hand from where Harry was holding it down, beginning to unbuckle Harry's belt as Harry hooked his thumb under the waistbands of both Draco's joggers and the boxers he wore underneath, pulling them down.
Hermione squinted a little.
“I’m afraid I wouldn’t know, ma’am.”
“People have gone insane from what they saw in that mirror," Draco snarled, holding himself back from raising his wand at the professor. “Why would you make Potter go in there?”
A sound came out of Draco that sounded like a mix between the words "oh" and "um", and as Harry pulled back, he saw that Draco's face had flushed.
"Yeah. If you don't mind."
“Oh, no you don’t-”
“Just tell me, where are we?”
"What if I don't do it?" He said as hesitation hit him. What did the old hag gain from all this, anyway?
“Was addressed to you and Draco Malfoy," Hermione nodded. “Neville was scared to show it to you because he didn’t want you to know that he had told Luna about Draco being in your room.”
Harry watched as Malfoy sat down next to him, the only place available. Malfoy looked different even up close. Not as ghostly and pale anymore, somehow less... More handsome? Maybe it was that he was a couple years older now.
Harry glanced at Draco. He didn’t say anything, but he raised his eyebrows in a gesture that told Harry he should probably continue talking.
“Right," Harry said and grabbed his Auror Handbook. He sat down next to Draco and handed him the book. It was heavy and full of pages where Harry had folded the corners to mark important bits - a horrible system, really, because a lot of it was important and the folded corners made the book look twice as thick as it already was. The book was full of laws on Magic and its use, and more than a third of it was just Ministry recommendations on how different situations ought to be handled.
“Do you want a list?” Draco asked, answering to his father’s passive-aggressiveness with made-up cheerfulness. “I can owl it to the manor - oh wait, you don’t live there anymore, do you?”
“Mr. Scamander is inside,” Gwen said. “I can wait out here with Draco, if you’d like to-”
Draco smiled as was polite and carefully peeked into the cauldron.
“Didn’t know they wrote books about me already”, Harry mumbled. “Is it any good?”
not expelled? You broke like, at least fifty school rules.”
She arrives at King's Cross and takes the train to Paddington. She's not used to travelling this way, to being so close to Muggles and their undisciplined children who wail in public, but she can't bring herself to use wizard transportation. She can't stand the looks. And she's nervous, so nervous she doesn't want to apparate. She doesn't want the moment she is in the same part of town with Draco to come too soon. She wants to be calm and collected, but she's too desperate to bring him home with her.
"I have muscles in my wrists?"
,” Harry said, and nothing happened.
"That'll happen before he gets the hang of it," Ron said and yawned.
on the door.
He opened the door just as Ron Weasley, who was standing on the other side of it, was about to slam his fist onto it again.
“Uh-huh," Draco mumbled as he started to pour some dried up leaves into a mortar.
"Do you know what happened to him?" Draco asked. His eyes were fixed somewhere below Harry's neck, avoiding his eyes. "After you escaped that day."
Draco frowns and quickly glances back at Potter, who has stayed behind, waiting for him by the door.
“Maintenance? You mean like, cleaning?”
