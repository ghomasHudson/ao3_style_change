It’s just that Lavender had a very very bad habit of being very very nosy. Especially when it came to Harry’s love life. Or lack thereof.
Harry was more or less sure Dean was blushing. That boy better be thankful his cheeks don’t  flame up like Harry's do. Dean always teased him about how his cheeks flared whenever his crush so much as walked by. Harry hated he couldn’t do the same back.
“Err…” Harry cleared his throat. “Draco and I, we made this for you. To uhh… thank you for being such bricks. We enjoyed these few days. Might’ve been some of the best days of my life.” He sounded weird, but that was the best Harry could do, being shit at emotions and all.
Narcissa Malfoy was seated where he had left her. It was as if she hadn’t even blinked. Or breathed, for that matter. Her eyes flicked to Teddy, who was perched on Sirius’ hip. They softened.
Harry can understand where Ron is coming from, but he’s not the one that has to listen to  Seamus and Dean rant about how ‘beautiful his eyes are’ or ‘how are his hands so long and  elegant, Harry, HOW?’ or even ‘god dammit Harry I want to shag him so bad’ without knowing the other says the exact same thing. Harry is. And he’s getting bloody tired of the pining losers.
Harry pressed a kiss on Draco’s forehead. A bit like the knight to the dragon. “What are you talking about? If anything, you made it all the more amazing.”
Teddy changed his hair to match Narcissa’s salt-and-pepper locks. His eyes remained Remus’ honey brown.
Lav pouts. “Aww, but then who’s gonna kiss Parvathi good morning, and flirt with Hermione, and get on your nerves, and piss off Ernie-”
A pair of mismatched eyes stared at him from above. One was a light grey and the other a blue so pale, it was hard to tell they were two colours. But they were. And under those eyes was a pointy nose dusted with the softest of freckles - inconspicuous, just like the difference between the two eyes.
It’s all the dysfunctionality, the ability to get along even when they’re all so very different, that’s family. It’s staying together even when you have different ideas. Pulling each other out of trenches and making meals that bring back memories. Sharing quilts and secrets. Keeping the knives at bay.
"But this is too stressful." Harry stage-whispers. "And you know too much stress is bad for  the baby."
Ron still looks a bit sick, so Harry counts that as a win. It was always so much fun to rile up  his best friend. Even more fun than gossiping about boys with Dean and Ginny. Or even chatting with Malfoy with the paper cranes.
“Acceptable.” What? That was a brilliant explanation. How come Harry only got an ‘acceptable’ for it?
that it was wrong. My mother thinks so too…” Here, Sirius glanced up in surprise. “But she thinks our hands are tied. Nothing to be done.”
She hugged him. Sirius noticed she smelled like the Rose Bedroom. Or perhaps, the Rose Bedroom smelled like
"So," Harry turned to Draco. "Should we tell them I asked you out during the knife monopoly  game or should we wait until they let us out? Which is never?" Trust the soap opera fanatic to be overdramatic.
Harry blinked. When had he fallen asleep? He remembered sitting on the train next to Malfoy. And realizing how tiny the seats were and over-analyzing his and Malfoy’s thighs being pressed so close. Then Malfoy started talking about
He’d called them blood-traitors and laughed at their financial condition, all the while being jealous of their large, happy family. He voiced the question to Madame Archibald.
A cool breeze brushed past him, making his hair flop onto his face. Draco’s hair went just a little past his shoulders and was incessantly annoying. He made a mental note to cut it sometime.
Trying for a counter attack, Harry throws the pillow back at Dean. It lands on Blaise's bed,  though. Four beds from his target. So much for perfect aim, Harry thinks. No wonder he  never got chosen to be a Chaser.
Sirius wondered how many more injuries he must have missed. The ones on the inside. He didn’t know any spell to heal those.
I don't think I'm good at prose tho ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Anyways comment, kudos and all that bc that's what keeps me going. Love y'all.
“I really think you should write back,” Ernie had told him. “You know never know,” he murmured darkly before vanishing into a corridor. Harry found that rather creepy.
The warm light filtering through the rooms. Windows no longer looking like filter paper. Things appearing just when you need them.
In the end Zabini and Hannah declared Ron the winner because obviously seeing his own handsome face in Harry’s mirror jumper wouldn’t be considered ugly.
I suck at Herbology. If Ron and I fail this term, Hermione is going to put our heads in a  jar." Which was true. Hermione did threaten to do that. No faking there. Harry tried to suppress a shudder at the memory of her fierce tone.
Well, Ron, Neville and the rest of the eighth years (and any younger students staying for Christmas) were looking at him weird.
“When she was released I truly believed she was better. That everything would be alright. I trusted her to stay alone with Delaney. When I returned, only his body remained.
“Of course you can! Anyone can! provided they can persevere. It won’t be easy, but we’ll be here for you, okay?”
It took the wind out of him, poor Harry. The sight made him nonplussed. Befuddled beyond words because
Harry felt guilty leaving Draco out of his letters, but the less his friends knew about Draco, the better.
“My father wanted me to join the dark faction. Like, how can you even think they’re right? The leader calls himself the
Harry? Did you forget what he did?” Girl Weasley had tears shining in her eyes. She turned around, like a blood-red tornado, and stalked out. Her red hair seemed like it was rising with every angry step that she took. Potter shot Draco an apologetic look before running after his girlfriend.
He put his presents (Ron’s jumper, Mione’s reading glasses and Lavender and the twins’ DVD collection and some other gifts) away.
Harry had said  this to Dean more times than he could count, but the Gryffindor wouldn’t budge, always coming up with some ridiculous excuse that made Harry want to bang his head on the headboard.
Fred is arguing with Oliver, probably because he was missing an important game for this. George is sharing a pale violet scarf with Angelina.
“I’d like for you to hear me out, please.” It tugged at Harry’s heart, that pleading tone. Guilt wracked at his brain but his mouth didn’t stop.
All the ‘I’ve done good’ feelings disappeared when Sirius realized he’d forgotten the most important thing. A blanket.
Harry hovered next to the counter, anxious for Draco to be done. Then, the old lady muttered something rude at Draco. “Rich kids,” she spat. “All the same - disgusting little leeches.”
Harry's friend still looked skeptical. "Fine. Do what you have to." Dean says, turning back to  his sketchbook.
His eyes lit up, though, when Harry turned. Sirius pulled him in for a tight hug. “Harry! You came.”
Wimbledon raises his arms as if he were an orchestrator, or better yet, a disillusioned preacher during a sermon.
Charlie makes a beeline for Tonks while Percy does the same to his mum. Molly shovels two trays onto him, which he takes with a grimace. “Kale crisps. Hooray.” Percy grumbled. “Who even eats this stuff?” says the only person who did.
"Try to find information about bond. I’m pretty sure that the more powerful, the better the support. It might depend on that."
Draco was leafing trough the huge book Hermione had found the day before, trying to distract himself from the events that had occurred during the night. Granger and Weasley were in the library too. "She’s probably helping him with the transfiguration essay." He looked around. Harry and Pansy where nowhere to be found. He wondered if they were still together. Sighing, he immersed himself back in the book.
She smiled. "Great. Now, I think you two are ready to go back to your common room. Come here if you feel any sign of weakness."
I’m glad to hear that everything went well. Don’t worry too much about the bond restrictions and the pain Draco could feel at some times, it will stop soon - depending on your strengths. Let’s call it an adaptation phase.
"For the bond to activate, both the Kitsune - pure blood or not - and their to-be-bounded must give consent. The Kitsune’s bond is known to be based on love and would therefore not work in case one would be forced. The blood pact must be done under the moonlight. Both parts must cut trough their hands and hold them together under a ray of moonlight while reciting the sacred words: Kawakami to kono kawashita ya tsuki no tomo."
"Kitsunes can breed with most human-like species such as wizards and vampire. However, breeding with another animal-like creature such as werewolves is impossible. The only animal creatures they could breed with are other Kitsunes."
"Oh… And is there someone you like?" As both him and Draco turned red, Sirius started laughing. "I see, I see. Are you two going to bond?"
They were not alright. After one minute spent in a separate room, Draco felt like his head was going to explode. He wondered if Harry was feeling the same, before remembering a line he had read in the book. "The price to pay for the bonded’s power, submission and honesty will be that the pain from being apart will be much greater for the Kitsune." So Harry was probably not in pain. "Yet." He remembered. His heart ached at the thought. What if Harry went to sleep feeling great but woke up in the middle of the night in extreme pain. "That’s not even the point, if you stay here you’ll faint from the pain yourself." He realised. Panting, he got out go his room and headed next-door. He did not think of knocking and opened the door on a shirtless Harry.
"Alright." Harry thought, taking a deep breath. "I’ll just wake him up gently…" Trembling, he climbed on the bed and softly started shaking Draco, in vain. He was wincing and groaning, sweating from the pain and stirring in the bed in hope for relief. He decided to give it all out and, cupping his face, pressed their lips together. He tried to put as much magic and love as he could and when he finally moved away, he met cold grey eyes and rosy cheeks.
At 11:24, Harry was up and before Draco’s door, hesitating to call him. After a couple of minutes, he braced himself and finally knocked.
She moved away a little, intimidated. "This is probably the last time we meet each other, Harry. Now that you know I’m not real, I’m going to be a part of your conscious. Your unconscious won’t be able to create and summon me anymore."
He blushed. "Cuddles." He wanted to say, but considering the awkwardness of their relationship at the moment, inviting Harry in his bed would not be very wise of him.
Without letting time for Harry to complain, he stripped him out of his bottoms and took his member whole in his mouth, letting it bump against the back of his throat and making Harry moan loudly. He kept sucking and licking until Harry made him move away, pulling his hair, and made him stand before crushing their lips together and leading them towards the bed where their mouths parted and he made Draco turn around and bend.
"See, I’m always right! I told you you’d be stuck with me forever." Draco laughed, ruffling Harry’s black hair.
"Kitsunes being non-gendered creatures, they can breed with both male and female. They would however not be able to be pregnant unless transformed as a female creature, this is how many Kitsunes tricked men in the past.
Thirty minutes later, he was disillusioned and ready to head to the Reminiscence Hall where a portrait of his mother was displayed - Potter had asked for it, claiming the war had been won thanks to her. He rethought about what he had heard the night before. "'Don’t you resent me, for being in love with him?'" Draco blushed. He hated himself for not being able to think about something else. Harry’s words haunted him.
Draco’s face lit up when he noticed his best - and only - friend curled up in an armchair with a book.
"Hey, stop." Harry whispered in his neck, making him shiver. "We’re both alright aren’t we? There’s nothing to apologise for."
Hermione nodded. "I believe a purification ceremony could be made, asking for both bloods again." She leafed the book until page 294 and looked for the reverse potion. "They would need to be mixed with moonlight spirit, opal powder and wolf’s-bane flowers. Both the Kitsune and their bounded would need to drink the potion."
"We cleaned up the mess upstairs, maybe you should sleep a little more before supper." Hermione softly said.
"The offspring should be born with Kitsune features such as ears, fur, claws or fangs additional to their tail. If the tail and features appear after birth (months or years), the Kitsune’s body will have to evolve hurriedly. This hurried evolution called kōki shinka could become extremely painful and dangerous depending on the number of tails the body has to make appear. The only thing that could calm the pain would be the support of one or more bounded lovers.
If the mother is a witch, the offspring will be able to use both his magical and Kitsune powers and could therefore become extremely strong. Kitsune-wizards are considered nobility and are respected. Like other half-bloods, they can not pass down the Kitsune gene. Some offsprings have shown to have an affinity with their parent’s element.
"Hm…" Draco wanted to add something but decided otherwise. "Let’s get you some outfits Sirius will be proud of."
Hermione sighed and continued. "'Mori Kitsune are of the forest, with a dark fur and mysterious personality…"
Hermione could not help but let out a small chuckle. "I think that something might please you even more." She then added, pointing the next sentence.
Hello, I'm back with another Drarry! I was inspired by the anime Kamisama Hajimemashita and the fanfiction Custody by @Author_Friend! (on Wattpad)
And just like that, they got back to it. Training and searching and reading and focussing. After a couple of hours, they gave up and headed to the Great Hall for supper. They would keep up the day after, and the weekends after that if needed.
Harry frowned. "I asked you to make me yours many time already, and despite figuring out we aren’t 'just friends' you still won’t figure out what I want?"
Harry, Ron and Hermione had spent the afternoon with Hagrid after having worked on a DADA homework during the morning and were headed to the Great Hall for dinner. Hermione had decided not to tell anything to Harry - yet - about the small meeting she and Draco had agreed on. He would have been too anxious and Ron would have figured out something was planned, something he did not know about, and could have ended up feeling left out.
She raised her head, looking at him suspiciously. "What were you doing all day? I heard you entered the Great Hall chit-chatting with Granger."
"You’ve got your lot of grief because of that Mark, but it’s only a tattoo now. Only an ugly tattoo."
"Great idea 'Mione, but we can’t get to far from each other for now so… Does anyone has a quill and paper?"
His breathing started to accelerate and he found himself to be hyperventilating soon enough. Panic was taking over him. The curtains drawn around his bed were abruptly opened by a worried Madam Pomfrey.
He started shaking. He brought his knees closer to him, burying his head in them as he hugged himself.
"Bi, actually." He shot a death glare to his best friend. "I would’ve preferred to tell you myself though."
If a Kitsune decided to bond with a male without turning themselves into a female, breeding won’t be possible."
If daggers could be sent only by looking at someone, Ron would have been badly injured. Sirius suddenly bent over the table to greet Pansy, trying to lighten the mood.
"Of course he wouldn’t have! Goddammit, you’re both so oblivious and stupid. 'Blah blah I was a Death Eater, he probably hates me.' 'Blah blah I killed his mom.' I don’t know who’s worse but damn! You should really stop worrying about these stupid matters."
"Good news, good news." He stretched. "Now the only matter left is: How the fuck do I get these features to disappear."
Today was a rainy Saturday, they had spent the whole day studying in their common room, helping each other with the tremendous amount of homework they were stuck with. Of course, now that Autumn was finally there, the sun had decided to hide behind grey clouds which would not stop crying. Even the wind was howling, making the dull day utterly gloomy.
When Harry opened the door, Draco had trouble hiding his disgust. It smelled musty, everything in the room had been destroyed and the windows were blocked off by rotten wood planks.
The day went on like an usual Friday would, but Hermione, Ron and Pansy could feel the tension in the air. Tomorrow, many things would have changed. Slytherins and Gryffindor did not have common lessons today and the small group was only able to gather during meals. At dinner, the air was so heavy no one dared to speak.
He started kissing his neck, descending towards his collarbones he softly bit, then licking and biting his whole torso until he was knelt in front of him, kissing his lower stomach gently.
The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. Was Draco only curious? Maybe he was worried about him. "There’s no need to think about it, you can’t get close to him anyway. Forget about it, just snap at her and get out of here. If you get close to her you’ll hurt Draco even mo- STOP!"
Draco felt guilty for making his… Partner (?) think of Remus. "Partner?" He wondered. "Nope, that doesn’t sound right. But 'bonded’… It’s even worse. And we aren’t just friends anymore."
"I know you hate me, I know I was an asshole but I beg you, I need your help. I promise this is not some kind of trap." Draco answered with a shaking voice.
She shook her head. "I’m the Ginny you remember. I’m your unconscious, I say the things you want to hear the most."
"But my aunt didn’t like it. She asked them to break up several times and when she thought they finally did, they kept seeing each other secretly. A couple of days before Narcissa and Lucius’ marriage, she found out about them still being together. She and my uncle were enraged. They broke into Andromeda’s house, where we were all having a tea trying to figure out how we would get Narcissa out of her marriage, and started threatening them. My aunt were calling her names, saying she would bring shame on the family as she was not only with a muggle like her sister, but with a foreign one and a commoner. That’s when Narcissa made the biggest mistake of her life. She told her parents it was too late, as she was already pregnant with his child."
"Shut up. We’re going to make it, end of the discussion. Just focus on keeping your magic flow steady and welcoming mine. We’ll be alright."
"I got Harry a new wardrobe, wait till you see!" He grinned bigger before adding. "He’s also my boyfriend now." And left, pulling him by the wrist, to get him changed.
He roughly shook his hand in an 'It’s okay’ manner and they stayed silent for a moment, each lost in their thoughts.
"Ginny." His voice broke. "I mean, her ghost. But in the end, she had no ghost. It was all in my head." Harry sighed. "I don’t know why I’m telling you this."
"We need to, to find a way," he inhaled, breathless, "to tell the, the others so that they don’t," he breathed again, "don’t worry."
Harry sighed but started talking anyway, describing how the ingredients should be treated and the evolution of the potion.
An hour ago, Draco too had woken up after a nightmare. The same he had to go through every night. He had taken a long shower, bracing himself for the night to come. And his intrusive thoughts would not let him be.
"So that’s why Goyle was wearing glasses. And that’s why you ran out of the common room for no reason… Well." He laughed. "I wasn’t the heir though."
He looked around, making sure they were alone in the dim lighted corridor and, in the swish of his wand, cancelled what seemed to have been a disillusionment charm. Hermione could not help but gasp when she noticed two white ears popping on his head and a fluffy tail brushing against the ground.
"Yeah, I read that after the ceremony, at a moment when the two bonded’s heart will be in complete coordination, the bond will manifest itself to concretise the… Relationship."
Pansy nodded and Hermione pursued. "'Kawa Kitsune are of the river, calm, they are granted of a steady and smooth power. Their fur will always be light grey.' We can cross this one too. 'Umi Kitsunes are of the sea and ocean, even though they resemble Kaze Kitsune quite a lot. Distinguishing them can be heard as they are both living oxymoron. The fur of a Umi Kitsune will also be of a light tint, the only thing telling the two creatures apart being the nature of their power (wind or water). Umi Kitsunes are also very sensitive to the Moon, and can easily be influenced by its cycles, just like the sea. Yama Kitsune resemble Chikyu Kitsune by the colour of their fur, they are howev-"
"Yes, if Mieko’s tails were supposed to appear every four years and she died at twelve trying to grow three… What if I have to grow five when I turn twenty?"
"With a little bit of chance, I’m not a Malfoy." Draco finally murmured, relaxing his shoulders. His eyes were reflecting an unexpected hope.
He nodded and left to wait at his own desk. After giving Ron some instructions about his essay, she joined him.
He slowly nodded, his mouth drying as he noticed Harry’s erection pulling the fabric of his sweatpants.
Harry frowned. "Why would she do that?" He thought. The best thing to do if he wanted an answer was to ask.
Draco looked up. Their faces were a few centimetres away from each other and Harry could clearly see Draco’s pupils shaking from doubt.
Draco turned to his best friend in awe. Her eyes were sparkling. He sighed, she had found a new entertainment and was not going to let them go.
"Well, I’ve had itchinesses around the, er… End of the spine, and on my scalp, where these ears are now since my birthday. I also grew almost a head taller, and my hair is lighter. But I noticed the features this morning, and tomorrow it’ll be three months since my eighteenth birthday."
"Granger, I just found an interesting info about, er, transfiguration. Thought you’d find it interesting."
Her heart ached. He was right, Blaise too, was gone. Not knowing what to say, they just stayed like that, on the ground, watching the duel that would define their future. They stayed there, loosing track of time, until the Dark Lord’s body finally hit the floor. Death Eaters flew in dark smoke and, as Harry fell on the ground from exhaustion, Draco stood up and started running towards his mother’s corpse.
Harry heavily let himself fall on the bed as Draco growled: "Get up, Hermione cleaned the sheets, you’re not going in without a shower."
"I’ll go get the ingredients." Draco decided, getting up. "You read the instructions a few times to be sure you understand them."
She hummed, immersing herself back in the book. Draco started scribbling the information they had gathered. When he was done, he contemplated them for a moment, addressing a thought to his late mother. "I hope I’ll still be your son after unraveling this mystery. I hope I’ll be able to get you maiden name back." Determined, he got up to look for a book about shape shifting. He was able to find was he was looking for in about half an hour.
He took the small case out of his pocket and gave Harry a kaiken, keeping the other for himself. After a look of confirmation, they both cut trough their left palm. As Draco winced at the pain, Harry took his hand. Joining their wounds under the moonlight, he nodded at him and together, they started reciting.
"It’s alright, we’ll spend the night together." He guided him to the bed. "Here, lay down." But when he tried to walk away, a firm grasp caught his wrist.
"You should go to the Shrieking Shack, like that no one can find you. And I think it would be better for you two to go alone. If all the eight year students are missing from their dorms it’ll be a huge mess."
She scowled at him before nodding again and he slowly got up, trying to forget about the aches running trough his whole body. He managed to drag himself to a chair next to Harry’s bed where he heavily sat. He took Harry’s hand, caressing it softly, murmuring apologies. After a couple of minutes, he decided to lay his head on the edge of the bed and when he opened his eyes, the clock was indicating 4PM already. A gentle hand was running trough his hair and he abruptly straightened up at the realisation.
As, breathless, they were all laying down in the common room - some on the desks, others on the ground - a small tap caught their attention. Pigwidgeon was back.
Deciding to go on with the lie he had not been told about, Harry nodded. "I’m very sorry Madam Pomfrey, I’ll ask him next time, even though I don’t think there will be any. This was just too tiring for me."
Argument (by Sirius Orion Black): "Lucius Malfoy is a known Death Eater and criminal and Narcissa was busy getting her divorce papers ready. As the heir of the House Black, I want to restore her honour in her death and grant her wish of being free of his name."
Harry wrapped an arm around him and rested his head on his shoulder. "It’s okay. It doesn’t have to be." He waited for a couple of minuted before asking. "Do you want to talk about it?"
Draco opened his arms and he squeezed himself in, keeping they foreheads pressed together.  After some time, Draco’s breathing evened out and he fell asleep. Relieved, Harry turned his back on him and snuggled in. "Ahh, how good it is to be the little spoon for once." He happily thought. A couple of seconds later, he also drifted to sleep.
Harry gently took his arm, lifting it close to his face, and kissed the Mark. "That’s not who you are. Besides, you didn’t really have a choice there, did you?"
"I’m sorry for laughing at you for not having a…" He hesitated. "A family. I see how much it hurts now."
Curious, Draco took the black box. It was quite heavy, to his surprise. Holding his breath, he opened it. Two silver daggers were lying inside, on a black cushion. Their hilt was made of opal and beautifully reflected the light coming from the window.
The sound of the dripping water helped him calm down a little. The water’s warmth was comforting. Today was the day he would be bonded to Draco. In a way, he was excited. His affection for Draco had been reciprocated and this was a promise they would be together for a moment, if not forever. However, another part of him felt extremely guilty. Would Ginny really be okay with this? If not, what would he have done? Harry tried thinking about it, and the answer came to him quicker than he expected. He would bond with Draco. Even if she was against it. Because if he did not, then maybe Draco would die. And Harry did not want that. He did not want that at all. Yes, this situation had rushed things a little bit. Yes, Harry would have preferred to be able to take his time. But Sirius was right. They would have all the time later.
The moonlight enveloping their hands started shining brighter and getting warm. Amazed, they both looked at their hands were they could feel their wounds slowly healing. Abruptly, the warmth of the light was replaced by an extreme cold that rushed trough their veins. Harry felt his heart clutch and clenched his jaw at the pain. His mind started rehashing his memories of Draco, causing him an intense headache. Draco did not have the time to worry, as his own mind was making him go trough many memories too. The thirty seconds it lasted felt like hours to them. As they gasped for air, the light disappeared, leaving them with only a warm feeling around the heart.
"Oh," Draco smiled, "I already found who I want to be bounded to. I just have to wait for them to confess their love to me."
"It’s, al- alright… Will you, teach me the, the patronus charm?" He breathed out, squeezing Harry’s hand.
Hermione nodded and got back to the reading. "'Kukan Kitsunes are often considered dark creatures as they represent void. They generally show a mischievous temper and are seen as trickster. Most of the time, their fur will be dark.' Pansy, cross this one too. 'Kaze Kitsunes are wind controllers, they can be rough and gentle, loud and quiet. They are powerful creatures and always posses light fur, from pure white to light grey, including yellows and blues. Seishin Kitsune are fox spirits, they are the most common type. Nor weak nor powerful, they can be called average unless tied to a God. In this case, they can gain the powers of invisibility and intangibility. Their fur can be of any colour. Kasai Kitsune are fire controllers. They are one of the most powerful kind, being able to control the famous Kitsunebi, or Foxfire. Their fur can change from a light yellow to a bright blue, according on their strength.’ Pansy, cross this one too."
"Well, he was poor and a werewolf, but what bothered my parents the most wasn’t his background. It was his gender. Homosexuality was a big taboo at the time."
At that time, Harry was already in bed, rehashing their discussion again and again. He could still see Draco’s grey eyes watching (over?) him. How long had he stayed there? Harry remembered the soft touch he had felt on his forehead and blushed. "What did I do to deserve this?" He thought in despair. Now that he had had a peak of Draco’s gentleness, having to stay away and ignore him would be even more difficult. And remembering he would never have a chance to be with him made his heart ache. A knot formed itself in his stomach.
Draco started scribbling the new info he had found. "Great, there’s no fucking way I turn into a woman or bond with one anyway." He sighed. "But this still doesn’t tell me who I’m supposed to bond with." Gathering his hopes, he got back to the book.
He stayed curled up in his room’s armchair until the clock indicated 7:30AM and he headed for breakfast. As he was walking down the stairs of their dorms, he heard footsteps behind him and turned back.
Draco was running around the castle, hyperventilating. "I need to find her, I need to find her NOW." He thought. She could be anywhere. He growled of displeasure, attracting the attention of a group of third years who stared at him, confused. It was a sunny day but even after looking trough the whole park he had not found the student he was looking for. He sighed heavily and decided to check the Eight Year’s common room a second time. Unsurprisingly, it was empty. He growled again and jogged towards the Great Hall. "Still nothing." He sighed ungracefully and stopped for a moment, a hand resting on his hip, trying to figure out where she could be. It did not take long for the obvious to finally hit him. He sighed again, feeling stupid for not having thought about it sooner, and ran towards the first floor.
Harry smiled. "Of course you woke me up, stupid padfoot." He let the parchment on the table. "I’ll answer later." He thought. He gave a treat to Pigwidgeon, sending him off, and headed back to bed.
Ron and Hermione were hugging Harry too, finally able to relax. After some time, everyone moved away.
He did not know what to answer. Right, if he had already chosen Harry to be bounded with, why would he laugh off his love?
Harry nodded. "He found me asleep in the Reminiscence Hall and woke me up. He looked concerned, and I think he even wiped the hair out of my face at some point."
"Alright, doesn’t look too difficult. But who am I supposed to bond with?" He thought. There was no one close enough to him… Sighing, he pursued his reading.
He sighed. "Even if we’re not bounded yet I can’t help but feel submissive to you. Is that one of your Kitsune powers?"
He smiled and bowed slightly for Harry to access the top of his head, which he started to pat, gently caressing the fluffy ears emerging from his hair.
Harry was awaken by the knocks of a tiny bird against his window. "Pigwidgeon…" He thought. "What time is it?" The clock on the wall indicated 8:16AM. He sighed and got up, trying his best not to wake Draco up.
"I’m sure that’s why Ginny would’ve said too." Concluded Ron. "She loved you unconditionally, your happiness meant the world to her."
"Well," he hesitated, "'partners' doesn’t sound right and 'bonded' is really weird but we… We aren’t really just friends either, are we?"
"The seventh one is done Honey, only two to go." Harry reassured. "You’re doing great, you’re amazing. We’re going to make it, you’ll see. We’re going to be alright."
Drenched in sweat, Draco allowed himself to breathe, gasping for air as Harry was muttering more prayers to the gods. One had sprouted, but how many more needed to come? They did not get much rest as the great pain came back and a third tail started growing. Harry decided he would be able to give more of his magic with greater physical contact and gently put Draco’s head on his lap, still stroking his hair and holding his hand. The third tail took a little less time to appear, as Draco was starting to get the hand on how to focus and concentrate their magic, and they both gasped for air when it was fully grown. Harry was overwhelmed by panic as the fourth tail immediately started to grow. "Are we really going to make it? How many are left? I hope I’ll have enough magic for it all."
"Yeah," answered Sirius, "I also got in some troubles because of love. Thankfully, I had James’ family’s support. I wish your mother had had someone to protect her from her parents too."
When he finally arrived in the Library corridor, breathless. He swore in a growl, hoping he was finally at the right place. He walked towards the library, trying to get a hold on his breathing. Once there, he politely - and silently - greeted Madam Pince, and headed towards the desks, which were unfortunately free of the student he was looking for. He sighed again, losing hope, and started walking around the different sections. It was only when he was entering the before last one that he spotted the bushy brown hair he was so eagerly looking for. He let out a sigh of relief and walked in the student’s direction.
He was not able to finish the sentence. Draco took his clenched fist and opened it, intertwining their fingers and slowly rubbing his thumb on the back of his hand, hoping to help him relax a little.
"'Kaze Kitsunes are wind controllers, they can be rough and gentle, loud and quiet. They are powerful creatures and always posses light fur, from pure white to light grey, including yellows and blues. Their eyes are typically grey, even though sometimes white eyed creatures may appear. They are known to be extremely powerful when paired with Sanda and Umi Kitsunes and have good affinities with flying creatures. They are able to control not only the wind and its intensities but also to have an impact on the weather. Kaze Kitsunes can be excellent fighters if correctly trained and have the strong mental needed.’" Draco recited. "Well, promises to be interesting."
"My uncle went completely mad and jumped on Hayate. He didn’t even think about drawing out his wand, he directly stabbed him in the heart. His body disintegrated before he hit the ground and a soft melody rang in the air. I still remember it, it was so sad. My aunt told Narcissa she would marry Lucius and claim her child as his, then they left. She was devastated. Andromeda, Ted and I tried to comfort her but it was no use. In the end, we couldn’t do anything, she married Lucius and you were named Draco Malfoy. For him not to find out about Hayate, she hid your Kitsune powers with a Mippei."
"Alright… Well. It’s, er- It’s almost dinner time, I think I’m going to go." Harry mumbled, standing up.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Draco were sitting around a table at the Hog’s Head, waiting for their rendezvous. It was 3:05 already, and Draco’s leg was shaking from impatience.
He stopped before the big wooden doors he was eavesdropping trough last night and took a deep breath. He had wanted to spend some time with his mother’s portrait the day before, but Potter had been there. Hopefully, the room would be empty this time as it was early in the morning. Draco carefully pushed the big doors, trying not to attract Filch or Mrs. Norris’ attention, and entered. The sun was at dawn already but the room was pitch dark. Draco frowned. "Potter probably closed the curtains yesterday night not to be seen but… Why didn’t he open them back?" He flicked his wand, lighting it up wordlessly, and headed towards the windows. Half way there, he noticed something on the ground and lowered his wand.
As she left, he started looking for the chapter about bonds. If he recalled well, it was around pages 300… "Got it!"
His friends looked at each other uncomfortably. What were they supposed to tell him? Harry kneeled behind him and started massaging his neck and shoulders. Hermione got back to the old book, followed by Ron and Pansy, willing to let the couple alone.
Unable to resist, Harry let their lips meet once again, gladly welcoming Draco’s little bites. Slowly, he started pushing Harry back, towards a tree. And when his goal was met and his boyfriend was pinned against it, he left his lips to let burning kisses on his jaw, then in his neck. Once he reached Harry’s collarbone, he gently bit it, causing him to moan softly. Draco moved away with a smirk and, after a soft peck on Harry’s lips, started walking away.
Unable to bear more of it, Draco slowly thrusted in. Harry gasped at the pain, tears rising in his eyes and his hands clutching the sheets. Draco was caressing his back, trying to ease the discomfort, and after some time Harry relaxed. He started moving back and forth around Draco, whose right hand wrapped itself around Harry’s erection, stroking him at the same rhythm of his trusts. It did not take long for Harry’s pants to turn in loud moans and he started moving around Draco and in his hand, speeding up the pace. Draco’s thrusts were soon the end of him as he came in a hoarse moan. A few plunges later and Draco came too in a growl. After he caught his breath, he pulled out and they both fell on the bed, exhausted. With the little of consciousness he was left with, Draco lifted his wand from the bedside table.
She reached out her hand. Harry’s jaw dropped, but without a second thought he took it and she dragged him out of the Great Hall under Ron and Hermione’s dropped jaws.
She started leafing trough the book, attentively reading the six pages, scribbling some things here and there. After a moment, she lifted her head with a smile, satisfied.
Draco blushed and shook his head. "You don’t, it’s the bond talking. It’s because it’s new. You’ll see, it’ll change soon."
"He didn’t really have a choice there did he? He only did that to protect his mom and she still…" He sighed. "It must have been hard."
"You were happy there was no mating but I feel like it would’ve been easier for you if you had a mate somewhere…"
If the mother is a transformed Kitsune, the offspring won’t be able to inherit anything from their father, making them weak and impure Kitsunes - squibs if the father is a Wizard - who could live as humans if sealed properly. They would however not be able to breed, their half-blood making them sterile.
Draco sighed but decided to give her idea a try. He got himself back to his meditation, focussing on his magic flow and on the idea of making his fox features disappear. Two more hours passed, and as he was going to give up, he felt a tingle run down his spine and right to his tail. The feeling intensified as, one by one, they disappeared. Keeping his focus on,  he tried to move the feeling to his head, making his ears vanish and finally to his hands, where his long grey nails got back to their human like state. He opened his eyes slowly, meeting the surprised gazes and dropped jaws of his friends, and let out a victory cry.
Draco squeezed his hands and nodded, causing Harry to frown. He could not help but hope that his boyfriend was wrong.
Harry woke up drenched in sweat, but nothing could help him remember the nightmare he had. He put on his glasses and looked at the clock. 6:44AM. There was no use going back to sleep. He lazily headed to the bathroom for a deserved shower.
Draco abruptly sat up, ignoring the pain piercing his skull. He was in a bed, in the Hospital Wing, and the clock before him indicated 11AM. He checked himself, happy to realise that his ears and tails were perfectly disillusioned. "Probably Hermione’s doing." He sighed of relief at the thought before a suffocating fear took over him.
She was interrupted by footsteps. In an impulse, she managed to put back the disillusionment charm on Draco’s fox-like features, just before two fifth years appeared in the corridor.
At lunch time, Pansy and Harry parted ways as he headed to the Gryffindor table, trying to figure out how to explain his situation to his best friends.
He pulled on Harry’s hand, making him stand up and pressed their lips together, gently pulling his hair, then moved away smiling.
"Pansy told me he thinks I hate him, because he was a Death Eater. But I don’t. He didn’t even have a choice. If I hated him I wouldn’t have testified for him."
Hermione sighed and looked at him in the eyes. "We accepted to forgive you, after the war. I know very well all these things you had to do weren’t your choice, even if you sometimes were a true asshole because you wanted to. You wished I was dead. But you were twelve at the time. I think we’ve both grown up enough to be able to help each other now." She paused and, with a smile added: "You’ll owe me though."
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine."I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, honestly. We haven’t even found what my powers are. I wish my father was still alive… I wish there was someone who could help."
"I can’t believe he really did it." His voice was hoarse from the emotion. "He even made a change in my middle name."
Harry started too laugh. "I’ll look super weird with these clothes on. I’m sure they’ll be too tight and too long."
"I lost Blaise during the war, you know. We were trying not to fight but there was a big explosion and he tried to protect me… A rock hit the back of his head really hard." Tears started rolling down here cheeks and in a sob, she concluded. "And he died on me. Flitwick found me there, under his body, when they were gathering the wounded."
He headed out to his own room to shower and came back twenty minutes later, wearing grey sweatpants and a black t-shirt, to an empty bed. Draco was still showering. He sighed and sat himself in front of the mirror where he started combing his hair. Ten minutes later, the bathroom door opened on Draco, still wet and with only a towel around his waist. Harry immediately got up and, without saying anything, pinned him against the wall, holding both of his hands over his head.
At the Slytherin table, Draco was excitedly telling his best friend about the night’s events. As he was whispering in her ear, he felt a burning gaze on them and shivered. Slowly, he moved away. He started to look around, trying to figure out who was staring at them - a lot of students hated them - until his eyes crossed angry green ones at the Gryffindor table. Blushing slightly, he smiled, and Harry’s eyes softened before looking away. Draco kept studying him. When Ron and Hermione arrived, he clenched his jaw and rolled his eyes. He only nodded at them and did not say a word.
Harry blushed at his mistake and sat up, looking at the ground in embarrassment. "I’m such an ass." He thought.
Draco was walking on his tiptoes in the eight year’s dorms corridor, trying not to wake up the four other occupants. He finally arrived before his room and, as he was turning the doorknob, he noticed a weird noise. He lent an ear, trying to figure out where it came form. The room next to his. Potter’s room. He broke the distance between their doors and, sticking his ear on the door, tried to hear more. Draco frowned. Was Harry panting? No, it was stronger than that. He was hyperventilating.
She nodded slowly, a smile stuck on her lips. They were right, things were finally getting back to normal after many years of suffering. They had reached peace.
"Maybe you should focus on the shapeshifting now that you know what your powers are?" Ron suggested.
"Why didn’t I think about this earlier!" Hermione cried. "Maybe he knows something about your real father, Draco."
As Draco nodded again, he dropped on his knees and untied the white towel, letting in drop on the floor and uncovering Draco’s hard member. His panting intensified as Harry locked his green eyes in his and took him in his mouth. It did not take long for the pants to turn into moans and groans as Harry sped up the pace, licking and sucking avidly while Draco was pulling his hair. As he let out a loud moan, Harry pulled away with a devilish grin and started kissing his lower stomach, slowly rising, letting a trail of love bites on his whole torso until he reached his neck which he started nibbling and licking while stroking his erection. Draco’s dominant side took over as, unable to bear more of the sweet torture, he savagely pinned Harry against the wall, holding his wrists over his head. He licked his lips and grinned lazily then started with his revenge, sucking, licking and biting Harry’s entire body safe for his erected member.
Potter and Draco? What were they, some sort of overrated cereal? Harry sticks his tongue out at the dark Slytherin.
At first glance, the alleyway seemed empty. No shivering teenage boys carrying duffel bags in sight. A million thoughts raced his mind and the more logical part of his brain urged him to leave. Damn his heart. Why did he have to start feeling compassion
“I like you and I have for a long time. And even if it hurts to tell you, it hurts more to keep it inside me.”
And well, this might not have been the family Harry dreamed about as a child or the one he saw in the Mirror of Erised, but it was a family. And a darn good one at that.
“I like him.” Harry blurts. They’ve coaxed him into the living room. “I like him the way you like Moony. I
Harry left the day after Draco did, heart still clutched in his hand. He had yet to return to No.12 Grimmauld Place.
Hey. That’s right. They came here to pack because the bus taking them to the ski park was coming after dinner. That didn't leave much time at all, did it? Maybe Harry could just stuff all his clothes in the bag…
The small group of eighth-years were welcomed warmly by a middle-aged muggle woman and her daughter. “Welcome, welcome!” She had given them each a smile and ushered them into a large parlor to warm up.
Seamus pouted and Harry felt Dean's fingers dig into his sides through his robes. And to  think Harry was doing this all for him. Atrocious.
“Maybe the best course of action would be to send the kids upstairs to play?” Sirius suggests dryly. “We have a better chance of controlling them than auntie Ginny.”
"Why does everyone keep saying that?" he moans. Everyone had taken up hobbies after the  war. There was Ron with his baking, Luna and her tattoos, Theodore Nott’s obsession with swimming in the Great Lake and so on. Neville didn’t have much right to speak either, because all he did nowadays was swoon over his mystery boyfriend.
The silence becomes unbearable, before Draco speaks up. “Maybe you can teach me more about muggles someday.”
Harry turned to Draco, who had his eyes pressed shut. Was he disgusted at the prospect of kissing Harry? He certainly didn’t look excited. “Are you scared?” He said, voice low enough for only Draco to hear.
“Technically it was auntie Mena. We got you a kurta for when we boycott Christmas.” She said casually, as if talking about the weather.
That way, Harry reckons he can minimize certain schemes to dapper-up his coiffure. At least in his presence.
"I've a wish-list, see," said Harry, pulling it out. "Snow, icing biscuits together, an ugly jumper competition-"
Harry couldn’t blame her. As blindly in love as she was, even Ginny could see that they weren’t working. There was too much going on. You can’t engage in teenage romance with death looming over every step, right?
“Only if you promise not to eat any batter.”  Molly admonishes him. “Draco. You can keep an eye on the little devil.”
. It might sound a bit scary, but if you  keep your eyes closed long enough I'm sure you can do it too." He says in an unbelievably condescending tone. Like he was talking to a
One of the professor’s eyebrows disappears under her mop of fuzzy hair. “Well, unless you got married and didn’t think to inform us, I think we can all agree there is only one Potter. At least, in this room.”
Tonks came by and returned Teddy in the afternoon. Something about meeting her boyfriend’s family. Sirius wished her all the best (and shooed her away from his toaster pastries). When she knocked, Sirius had gotten his hopes up, thinking it was Harry.
Dean frowns. "That was oddly specific, mate you okay?" then he adds, “Did you get that  from another one of your weird dreams again?”
“James was the mother-hen of our group – with Moony following not far behind, (that earned him a smack on the head from Remus) so he was always doing something or the other to make us feel nice. Imagine!” Here he laughed and looked at Remus with fond eyes.
“Someday, yeah.” Harry replied the same way Draco did. He felt a squeeze on his hand. Harry squeezed back.
The studious Weasley, who was sitting on the floor surrounded by tomes, scowled at him as he passed by. None of the other gingers seemed to be around. Thank Merlin for tiny miracles.
“Gift time!” Victorie exclaimed. Teddy whooped. The children imminently dove into the pile of presents under the tree.
Lying in bed facing each other, forcing their eyes to stay open. Draco’s cool fingers against Harry’s forehead, tracing his scar while the latter pressed his forehead against Draco’s death eater tattoo. It was too intimate a moment to have happened if they weren't half-asleep.
“Just a bit, though.” Ginny smirked from his right. She was probably making fun of him. Ginny liked doing that. So did Lavender. Why was it that people did that so much? Was he, Harry, so susceptible to making a fool of himself?
This Christmas, they covered all the beds in wrapping paper. The harvest festival, on the other hand, was one feathery affair.
“I’m trying not to say things like that. I’m trying not to be like them but no one understands how hard it is.” It seemed like Malfoy was talking to himself more than Harry. Harry wondered if he should go. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy would like his company. It was all very awkward. It made him feel off-kilter.
Sirius gestured vaguely with his hand, itching for a fag. “Don’t be. James is probably gloating about dying a hero right this moment. He’s a bastard like that.”
If he couldn't keep the smug look off his face, that wasn't Harry's fault. "Much better. Now what do you want?"
His rambling was cut short by a comforting hand on his shoulder. Molly Weasley stared at him with kind brown eyes.
It was set in the outskirts of the village. Hidden within a thicket of oaks and firs that reminded Draco of the forest behind the Manor, back in Wiltshire. The sharp smell of thyme flooded his senses as Draco opened the gate. There had to be a raspberry bush somewhere, he just knew it. Most likely basking in the late summer sun. Under the creek, where moorhens were probably resting.
He had the boy’s attention now. Sirius heard him drop the stick he was drawing dragons on the ground with. “You know my mother, Walburga.” He saw Draco nod in his peripheral vision. “She practically disowned me the moment they put me in Gryffindor. Acted like I didn’t exist and my brother Regulus became her only son.”
It felt like he was under the sea. Unable to breathe, but too entrapped by the ocean’s wonders to let go. They had to go back to the surface, for a breath of fresh air. And then, they went under again.
That was probably how they ended up having a massive pillow fight (Harry and Ron) and then passed out on the floor (also Harry and Ron). Let’s just say Ernie was not pleased.
Draco sputtered. “But… but-” He flailed his hands – newly freed of shackles – and tried to get his point across. “Why
Draco had to keep adjusting the jammies Sirius lent him. He made a mental note to take him shopping later.
Remus had in wand in a death grip, knuckles white and shaking. His face might have been calm, reassuring, but his eyes gave him away. Pure anger. Hatred for the man that ruined millions of lives.
It shows in the way this teenage boy rocks himself back and forth, shivering despite being right at the crook of the now-lit fire.
It takes a moment for Harry to tear his mind from ogling the blond and register the question.  As soon as he does, however, Harry wishes he brought Neville's Hippogriff-feather pillow. It  muffled groans really well. "Did Ron tell you that?" He squeaks.
“I might have an idea, though.” and Draco whispered it into Harry’s ear, once again inciting shivers from the latter.
He was the one that planted the idea into her head in the first place. He killed himself before the dementors could find him.
fair and just member of the jury, Madame Archibald speaks up. The woman had been in Wizengamot since before even Grandfather Malfoy was born. She was ancient and, as a rule, no one dared defy her word.
they were. Why, why couldn’t they lash out? Why can’t they demand to know why Harry didn’t reply to their owls? Why did they have to be such perfect parents?
The Slytherins, Zabini and Nott almost never stayed there, preferring to crash either Malfoy’s  or Parkinson’s dorm. No one knows where Ernie goes. Just that he attended classes and ate at  the Great Hall. If you tried to find him outside of that, well, good luck.
Draco was looking anywhere but Harry’s face. “I- Well, I… Sirius has done a lot for me. Letting me sleep here and giving me clothes and a wand and I- I’d like to repay him somehow. Show him I’m grateful…”
“You’re impossible, Potter.” Said Malfoy, shaking his head. “Do you even own a proper coat?” He starts filing through Harry’s things, throwing clothes and books everywhere.
Fuck them. Draco thinks bitterly, trying to mask his fear. Hands clammy and cold. Draco could hear his heart hammering against his chest. He was shaking all over, face steeled into a monotonous look all Malfoys had mastered. His eyes gave him away, though. They always did.
Hermione, Luna and Ginny looking radiant in their bridesmaid gowns. (well, Ginny looked disgruntled, but otherwise beautiful).
Malfoy reddened and Harry knew he was holding back a snarky comment.Like he was going to explode. Then, he did something very uncharacteristic.
To his surprise, Potter actually laughed. “Ginny got me this shirt. Said she’d hex my balls off if I didn’t wear it.”
"You're doing something stupid aren't you?" Dean narrows his eyes. It was at times like these  that Harry wished Dean didn’t know him so well.
Hermione opened her mouth, (most probably to complain about the mess) but before she could say anything, there was a scratching on the window. It was an owl. Or perhaps a fuzzy mop of sorts. Hard to tell.
Also I wanted to ease the tension a bit before I move on to the actual feelings and lovey-dovey shit coming up next chapter (!!!!!) Harry considers Draco a part of his family now. Isn't that sweet??? or a bit too fast?
Draco left him with a choice, but without the subtle coercion that laced Ginny’s. Harry didn’t need to fuck around with Draco. He could teach him about muggles as friends, if Harry liked.
And then it was all done and all four of them sat at the table, even if it was only set for two. The pot of Shakshouka was summoned and Sirius eyed it hungrily.
. He's lucky it's a hardcover. Harry would have chucked some socks at him, but that episode with Dean  yesterday had wounded his pride.
“I bet it does. You just have a secret method you don't want to tell me.” Draco said vehemently, casting a death glare at the onions.
Believe Harry when he says the amount of clothes that gets chucked out of the tower  windows is a much larger value than considered normal.
Neville was gallivanting with his beu whose name he’d refused to disclose. “Find out yourself, if you want to,” he’d said,  rather smugly. And while Harry had every intention of doing so, he felt Dean’s dilemma couldn’t wait.
Considering how headstrong the boy’s mother was Sirius expected far more resistance. Then again, who wouldn’t get tired of living in an alleyway?
He was grinning like anything, the bastard. “When did you get so flinchy?” he said instead. Potter wasn't saying it to be
Across him, Madame Archibald raised a thin eyebrow. “Would you,” she says calmly, “rather stay with the MacDougal's, whom I recall your family has been in bad terms with for years, or perhaps, with the Longbottoms? Didn’t your aunt torture Mr Longbottom’s parents?” Her tone is firm, even. Stating facts, not putting him down.
It was way too early for Malfoy to look as chipper as he did. “Remember you said you’d never seen grebes before?” Yes. In fact, Harry remembered denying they existed.
"Right… I’m Harry Potter-Black. I took Sirius’s name when I turned 16, since he became my official guardian and I… I wanted us to be a real family."
She hummed, shaking her head. "More than my boyfriend, you were my best friend, Harry. And I always knew, your love for me would never be genuine. It was only what everyone wanted, right? The great Harry Potter had to settle with a nice girl. You were afraid no one would accept your sexuality. But I’ve known, ever since sixth year when you asked me to be your girlfriend despite looking for him all the time, that you were only with me to try to normalise yourself. Because that’s what people were waiting for you do to. You have done enough for people, Harry. Now is time you start thinking about you. Be selfish. Snatch what you want and make it yours. No one will be able to stop you, not after you saved our world."
Harry rubbed his back and said with a smile: "This leaves us with Kaze, Seishin, Kawa, Umi, Sanda and Jikan, it’ll definitely make things easier."
Soon enough, a battle had started. And the eighteen years old were five again as they were throwing cushions at each other.
"First of all, it’s almost morning. Second of all, I just wanted to spend some time with my mother. I mean, her portrait."
Draco laughed softly. "We’ll ask him tomorrow I guess… Until then, please don’t call me Malfoy anymore."
"I’d need to prove I’m not my father’s son, and I don’t really want to show the world I’m a fucking beast."
Harry hummed before burying his head in Draco’s neck. His warmth felt so good. Draco closed his arms around him.
"By the way, Ginny… Yesterday, why didn’t you wake me up or call someone? My back hurts from sleeping on the ground."
Hermione did not seem to judge the situation, much to Draco’s reassurance, but was clearly analysing his features with attentive eyes.
"Here we go." Sighed Harry. "Brings back memories. If I recall, there’s a balcony in the second floor’s room."
"Yellow eyes… We can cross this one too." Draco concluded with a broken voice. In a way, he wished he had the same ability as his late father.
His hands in his pockets and looking at the ground, he headed towards the Great Hall. Thankfully, no one was in the small common room and he could walk in silence to his breakfast. He had not talked to Ron and Hermione since the day before at dinner and was not excited to do so. He sat alone at the end of the table without bothering to check where they were. He was too tired for it. Massaging his temples, he looked around trying to figure out what he wanted to eat. The knot in his stomach decided that not eating would be better, and Harry only poured some tea in his cup. As he was drinking, he looked around the Great Hall, the routine comforting his heart.
A knot formed in Harry’s throat and he slowly nodded. He prayed all the gods he knew this was not his last moment with Draco, he prayed all the gods he knew he would not lose him tonight, and in his prayers, he fell asleep.
Harry’s lips were glued together again and he sighed before nodding. He would prove his love soon enough. They started heading to the castle but something did not feel right. Draco stopped he was still holding him by the wrist when he asked:
"No, absolutely not. You have to make that blood pact as soon as possible, what if the kōki shinka happens and you still aren’t bonded because you judged yourself not close enough? It’s too dangerous to even think about it!"
"Good." She got up and stretched. "Now I believe Draco will spend the whole day in the library like yesterday, would you keep me company."
"Shhhh! You’re too loud." Hermione sighed. "But you’re right. For this to happen, one of your parents must’ve been a Kitsune under the appearance of a human… And therefore couldn’t do magic, at least not the same as ours. This means one of your parents…"
Hermione nodded. "Be selfish, Harry. No one will resent you for it."					In a much better mood, the three of them spent the afternoon in the park, laughing around, just like old times.
The room they entered looked pretty cosy and only consisted of two couches and a fireplace. Draco and Hermione sat each in one couch and stared at each other in silence, not knowing what to say. After a good minute, she sighed and removed the disillusionment charm again.
Fifteen minutes later, they emerged from the Whomping Willow’s tunnel right into the Shrieking Shack.
But Draco shook his head slowly, a tear rolling down his cheeks. "It’s not, I won’t make i-" His eyes widened as a hand was pressed on his mouth.
He then proceeded to spend three hours torturing Harry, making him try outfits over outfits without letting him rest. When they were done, he managed to negotiate the prices with the seller and they apparated to Hogsmeade with a tremendous amount of bags floating next to them.
"Kitsunes have the power of making their lover completely submissive, would they want to, trough a blood pact (process explained page 294). Kitsunes could therefore have many loyal and submissive partner if they wished to.
Hermione could never forget how Harry’s aura had changed at that moment, and how everything started shaking around him when his magic had awaken from rage.
Harry took his shoulders. "Stop, you’re not. I want to be bonded to you, I really do. It’s 11:59, we have to start now."
"I’m only in your head Harry. I can’t interact with you if you’re unconscious, and I can’t interact with anyone. They wouldn’t see me."
I guess you slept together tonight, there was nothing you could really do to avoid it. Wish him a good morning from me too!
And hand in hand, they headed to their common room where cat-Pansy, knight-Ron and angel-Hermione were waiting.
"Hey." He said, sitting down. "Sorry for this morning guys. I need to tell you something, even though you probably knew about it all along."
"I’m tired of these trainings!" Draco wined, sitting on the common room’s floor. "I haven’t done any progress."
This story is kind of a test, I decided I would just have fun and try writing about new things. It's going to be less bright and much shorter than Silky Illusions. It happens after the war, too. I will focus on Draco and Harry's romance only but it won't be a slow burn this time. Hope that you'll enjoy!
"We should celebrate your achievement, shouldn’t we?" He murmured, getting closer to Draco who, panting, nodded in response.
As he closed his arms around her, Ginny’s silhouette vanished in thin air. Harry felt as if he was drowning. The only thing he could feel was a persistent pressure crushing his ribs, preventing him to breathe. He gasped for hair, shaking, and fear took over him as he realised that no matter how many time he would inhale, air was not going to reach his lungs.
Running his fingers in Harry’s black hair, Draco started kissing his neck, slowly ascending towards his jaw, his cheeks… He stopped at the corner of his lips. Harry had trouble holding a sigh.
As they were headed back to the castle, Harry and Draco walked behind the group, willing to talk but not knowing what to say.
"Great." Draco responded, causing a shiver down Harry’s spine. "Cause I love you too." He kissed Harry’s jaw softly and moved away. "I won’t ask you to bond with me just now. Let’s give us some time. Alright?"
Draco shyly looked up, meeting bright and smiling green eyes, as a warm hand was cupping his cheek. Tears rose again. Before they could fall and roll on his cheeks, plumped lips crushed against his own. He warmly welcomed the kiss, slightly opening his mouth to let Harry’s tongue enter and play with his. Slowly, his Kitsune dominance took over as he was teasingly pulling Harry’s hair and biting his lip, causing him to moan softly.
"I think that we can cross Kawa, Umi and Sanda. Kawa and Umi automatically have blue eyes and Sanda have yellow or blue eyes. Only Kaze, Seishin and Jikan can have grey eyes. To know which one of the tree you are, I had to check the hereditary probabilities. Only a Seishin Kitsune can give birth to another Seishin Kitsune, as their bloodline needs to be pure for their abilities to fully develop. Jikan Kitsunes can only be born from two other Jikan Kitsunes… Which means that you’re a wind controller, a Kaze Kitsune."
When Harry woke up around 8, he was utterly confused. He slowly remembered the course of events. Draco in the Reminiscence Hall, then Ginny’s ghost, then his panic attack and then… Draco again. He blushed at the memory of their embrace. He had been so soft and gentle, maybe… Maybe it could work out. "What are you thinking? His mother died because of you. You’ll just make him suffer even more." He gulped at his own thoughts, a knot forming into his stomach. "Right, there’s no way I’ll make him happy." He ended up admitting. He could feel tears trying to force the way, but held them back. He knew about it all along, why did it hurt? "I’ve let false hopes grow…" He realised sadly. "I’m just making things worse." Sighing, he got up and started getting ready for the day. It was going to be a harsh one.
him and I thought he did too but when I woke up the morning he’s… he’s gone. Sirius how could you let him go?”
Ron looks like he doesn’t know whether to gag or dive into the sock portal to look for Krum's  socks. "You didn’t
Harry took the hand, trying not to think about how nice it felt to hold Draco’s hand. Because that would be stupid. Because Draco probably isn’t too happy about having to hold his arch-inconvenience’s hand.
“Don’t think too much,” muttered Malfoy, sneaking some pudding off Harry’s plate. He let him, knowing the sweet-toothed thing Malfoy was. “You look like your brain might pop out onto the plate any moment.”
“Don’t say that.” Harry grumbled, feeling all that ‘getting along’ thing they’d been doing vanish into thin air.
“Uhm, yeah! Yeah, I did, actually. Thank you for asking.” Harry didn’t think he’d ever heard Malfoy sound as flustered as he did at that moment. And he
“I…” His grip on Teddy tightened. Merlin forbids anything like that happened to his baby. “I’m sorry.”
"Yeah." Harry's best friend shouts. He's glad he remembered the Mufflatio. "How about we leave Dean alone? Respect his privacy and all that shite?"
But it was too late. The fork jabbed into the opening the moment Harry grabbed the other boy's arm. And that's how the both of them ended up standing in the dark with their hair standing up and feeling thoroughly jolty. Or maybe that was just Harry.
“No you don’t Harry James Potter.” Draco had tears in his eyes. “You being the bastard you are probably think I fucking hate you when it’s the opposite.” He let Harry hold him and buried his face in Harry’s kurta.
Of course they were, coming from two different people but… Ginny was straight to the point, but also a bit morbid. Talking about death and all that.
“Please.” Malfoy laughed as they trudged down the stairs. He could be rather good company when he liked to be. Not that arguing with him was any less exhilarating. He just looked more pleasant when he smiled. More his age. “I was five when I met her and she terrified me to the point I threw up on her.”
Sirius patted him on the back, gently, like he did when Harry had nightmares. Draco smelled like Harry. Like his bedspreads. Draco had been with him.
“Okay.” Maybe he’d wear his red robes over it for a festive look. Subtle Slythergryff anyone? Gryffrin? Slytherdor? Slythegryffrindor?
Harry and Malfoy looked up from their spot on Harry's bed. They had assembled a portable telly in front of the bed. Jacques Milano could be heard singing the theme song of his show.
“Harry, love, we know you love him.” Says his godfather. “He loves you too. Harry, he loves you so much.”
Harry didn’t feign surprise. In fact, he wondered why it took Hermione as long as she did to figure it out. “What do you think I should do about it.”
It didn't sound like a bad idea when all Harry was thinking about was getting Seamus and  Dean together. Now, spending the night in Ron's dormitory seemed like the most stupid thing  he'd ever done. And Harry did a lot of Stupid Things.
Draco made a sound of protest. All the laughter and jokes gone and a monotonous mask in its place. He looked distant, face paler than ever as he tugged at the sleeve. He quivered a little, Sirius noticed.
Harry noticed that Malfoy never wore short sleeves. Even if he did, he’d always make sure to wrap his arms with bandages. Maybe he was hiding something.
Mother was in full black silk. She looked drawn and tired. Ancient. They only allowed Narcissa to attend his trial to testify.
Malfoy made a disgusted sound and made to stomp towards the boats. Which meant Harry had to go too. “See you at the Burrow, Gin. And err... you too Pansy. See you on the train, maybe?” He waved at the couple before running after Malfoy.
This wasn’t about forks and spoons. It was about how Malfoy had grown up conditioned to look down on muggles. How he was so desperate to please his parents that he never questioned it. How his world shattered when it all came crashing down.
Draco Malfoy, bandaged beyond recognition, sat in an uncomfortable heap near the fireplace. He looked more disgruntled than hurt. “I’m
“Im trying.” He muttered. Malfoy’s eyes were shining, tears withheld. He shook tremendously and he had a trembling hand on his left arm. Was he alright?
The three of them spent that day in the kitchen, fumbling around with potatoes and onions. And Harry could feel them. His parents laughing along with him and Remus as Sirius tried to get egg off his hair.
"Right." Harry said, trying not to make himself look any more like the lovesick fool he was.  "Sorry." He let Malfoy in. And he might’ve stared at the Slytherin’s arse. Harry wasn’t going  to tell.
He flicked his gaze to the audience where, on the defence side sat only two people; Narcissa Black Malfoy and Harry James Potter.
Something in Harry dared to hope. He had no doubt that something was the supremely Gryffindor part of him that never thought before rushing in. And yet, had that part of him ever been wrong?
It was while Harry was picking out a sweater to wear that he remembers. “Shit. Fuck no.” He groaned into the mirror.
“You’re Sirius Black.” Draco said, looking detached. Like he couldn’t care less. He probably didn’t. The boy lived in an alleyway for crying out loud. that can't be easy after spending half his life in a manor and the rest in a castle.
"Can you tell me more about how this exactly happened? These kinds of things usually happen around birthdays… But yours was in June, am I right?" Draco nodded and she murmured to herself. "Why did this happen now…We’re in September."
"Harry, stop. You didn’t attack me and you will never do so. I was just uncomfortable because I’m still wet. My tails are super heavy and I don’t want to smell like a wet dog."
"Harry, it’s alright. It’s alright. Harry. Breathe in." He paused. "Now out." He paused again. "In… Out… Alright, that’s very good, keep going. In… Out…"
Objecting to the order, Draco sat up and laid his boyfriend on his back. He took out his own boxers before spreading his legs and settling between them, rubbing their erected members together. Harry wrapped his arms around his neck and encircled his body with his legs before throwing his head back, still panting and moaning. As he was going to ask for more, two fingers were presented before his mouth. Shyly, he opened up his lips and let them enter, running his tongue around them. After a couple of minutes, Draco took out his fingers from Harry’s mouth, before thrusting one in his butthole, making him gasp. He started moving back and forth and when he was sure that Harry was used to the feeling, added a second one. This time, it took longer for the pain to ease. Harry was hammering his nails in his shoulders at first but relaxed after some time. When he nodded, Draco started moving in slowly in circles and added a third finger. When Harry did not show any sign of pain, he started probing faster.
"I’m so done with this, it’s almost been a month and I still haven’t made any progress! If it’s our main ability then why is it so hard? I want to be able to do it for Halloween and be able to dress up and party like everyone else!" Draco complained.
"Lovely, lovely! As the Black Lord, I was planning on disinheriting Bellatrix and officially reintegrating Andromeda to the family… I think I could try to 'clean my late’s cousin honour' by getting her maiden name back and insist that you take that name too, cause I don’t want any Black blood to be related to criminals."
"Yeah," Ron pursued, "something along the lines of 'I want my nephew to take his mother’s maiden name because keeping the Malfoy name would be bad for business'"
Humming, Draco headed to his closet. Once ready, he noticed the something was laying on his bedside table.
Her smile was genuine, and Harry could not help but grin back. "Thanks," he then said, "I appreciate it."
At 10, Draco decided to head to bed, announcing he felt a bit weak, and Harry followed him, wishing everyone a good night. Even though they were able to spend the night apart, they enjoyed sleeping together and as such had decided that they would do so in the weekend. It did not take long for them to get in bed. Even though Draco had not used his disillusionment charm today since he did not leave the common room, he was exhausted. Once in his pyjamas, he tumbled across the room and threw himself on the bed before snuggling under the covers. Harry laughed softly and got changed before joining him. As they were facing each other, he took Draco’s hands and started blowing on them as to warm him up, and Draco’s fluffy ears twitched.
A couple of minutes later, the blinds were opened on the Healer who was followed by Draco. "Mr. Potter, how do you feel?"
They let each other’s hand go and Draco felt a shock in his heart. Craving Harry’s touch, he abruptly grabbed his wrist and pulled him close, wrapping an arm around his waist and running the other one in his hair.
"It’ll break if your will is weak. I don’t think it is. You’re both extremely strong wizards, both magically and mentally. You’ll get all the time to get closer when you’ll be bound to each other. There’s no time to wait. If I understood Hermione’s conclusion well, the kōki shinka won’t wait for you to be ready. You have to be prepared for it to happen anytime from now." He looked up, thinking. "I think that the moon will be at its first quarter on Friday night, there will be enough moonlight for you to be able to do the pact."
Draco nodded. "Even if it’s mostly a beige or a grey, white is a light colour too so we could never know."
Harry shook his head. "No, I’m alright. Now go get dressed please, I’ll join you when you’re covered up." He chuckled nervously. "You wouldn’t want me to attack you again." His heart broke as he let out these few words. "That’s right." He realised. "I attacked him."
Draco sighed but obliged, wrapping Harry in his arms and laying his chin on his head. Harry softly rubbed his back and moved away.
He lowered his gaze. His normally filed round nails were now long, sharp and grey. He winced at the sight.
Harry sighed, a soft smile displayed on his lips. His heart was light and full, life was good. They all had completely forgotten about the events planning themselves in the dark.
Everyone started laughing, until a gasp interrupted them. Pansy had just remembered an important matter.
Draco nodded and he got up, walking slowly towards his desk, then his couch, then his wardrobe and finally, the bathroom.
Behind the closed door, Draco Malfoy was shaking, trying to hold back tears. What had he just heard? Why was Potter talking… Alone? A feeling of guilt shot at him like a kick in the stomach and he felt like he was going to be sick. Tottering, he slowly headed back to the eight year’s common room.
After the long minutes of recounting, Harry was gaping. "Wow… So… You’re a Kitsune. And you’re not a Malfoy."
She inspected him with a frown before slowly nodding. "Before that I must ask you, what training were you doing for you two to end up like that? You were okay, I think you just fainted from exhaustion but, Mr. Potter… Was in a very rough state."
"So," she then said, "pure Kitsunes get a new tail every hundred years… And they can shape shift in human form only when they have nine. This gives us some information about one of your parents. But since you’re half-wizard, it’ll be different for you."
About fifteen minutes later, the lesson ended and the students were heading to the Great Hall for lunch.
Harry felt like he was being taught to breathe again. He closed his arms around Draco, grasping at his t-shirt, and started shaking. Soon enough, tears were rolling down his cheeks as he was uncontrollably sobbing. Uncomfortable at first, Draco relaxed and started stroking Harry’s hair. To his surprise, it was soft. Almost silken. He realised that Harry had fallen asleep only when his head fell off his shoulder.
And Harry thrusted in. And as Draco kept growling his name, he sped up the pace until Draco climaxed and a few thrusts later, he spilled himself inside of him.
Without hesitation, Harry headed to the condemned window and started tearing off the planks. Before Draco could even join, all the rotten wood was on the floor and a French window was uncovered. Harry opened it and got out on the balcony, taking a deep breath of the fresh air.
"There are pages with more informations on each!" Hermione yelled. "I’ll check them all and tell you my conclusion."
"I don’t think so… The book said we wouldn’t be able to leave each other’s side at first." Draco hesitated. "So don’t leave."
Ron, who was sitting next to him, wrapped his arms around him in a bear hug. "It’s alright mate, you can miss her. We all do." His voice was hoarse too.
Draco felt his erection harden at the pleading voice and nodded, slowly taking out his fingers. He cupped Harry’s cheek softly.
He kept teasing Draco, sometimes only licking and sometimes gently penetrating him with his tongue while stroking his erection. It did not take long for Draco to start asking for more. Obliging, Harry let him put himself in a more comfortable position before thrusting a finger in while still stoking him. As Draco was pleading for more, he added a finger, scissoring, then a third, and soon enough, Draco was out of breath.
Draco abruptly woke up, gasping for air. He was drenched in sweat. He checked the clock on the wall. 5AM. Shaking, he got up and managed to reach the shower. He sat down under the hot dripping water, trying to calm down.
They stayed in the library until dinner, gathering as much information as they could and, when it was time to head to the Great Hall, totally forgot they were not supposed to get along. When they entered it, still chatting happily about their discoveries, several pairs of eyes were staring at them and a whisper rose. Embarrassed, Hermione waved him goodbye and headed to the Gryffindor table, shamefully looking at the ground.
He smiled at Draco and opened his arms. "Come here." As he squeezed him closer, he whispered: "We’ll be alright, you’ll see. Our bond will be the strongest Kitsunes have ever seen."
Tears were rolling down Draco’s cheeks as panic started taking over him. "I’m not going to make it." He thought in horror. But a warm stream of magic filled his veins, and hope got back to him.
He started prepping the ingredients, giving instructions to Harry in the meantime. They were able to progress efficiently and soon enough, their Essence of Insanity was done.
He rubbed his eyes, a couple of tears rolling on his cheeks. "Why did you, who understood me the best, had to leave, Ginny?" His voice broke. "It’s so unfair."
"Draco…" Harry sighed, softly hugging him. "We’ll find a way. Hermione still hasn’t checked the whole book."
"No but… I was proud about it, about having been chosen. I was so stupid." Draco was looking at the ground.
Hermione, Ron and Pansy burst out laughing at a blushing Harry and ten minutes later, the couple was back downstairs. Harry was wearing beige dress pants and a dark brown turtleneck. His old round glasses had disappeared and horn-rimmed ones were replacing them. A black leather jacket and black boots were complimenting the look and Draco had made him put on some rings and a chain too. His hair were still an organised mess but tidied up in a wavy fringe.
Harry shyly nodded and straightened up before leaning towards Draco’s member, arching his back. He started slowly caressing it with his hand before adding his lips, encircling the erection, then his tongue. He started playing around with it and moving back and forth. Draco was stroking his hair and soon enough was pulling on it as he was panting. The view of Harry sucking him with his back arched like that was too much to take. He growled and pulled himself out of his mouth before roughly making him turn around. He firmly grasped his waist with his left hand while his right hand was rubbing his member against Harry’s butthole.
Harry too, had fallen asleep. On the ground of the Reminiscence Hall, exhausted from crying. Ginny’s ghost could not call anyone to get him to his dorm. Because Ginny’s ghost only existed in his head.
Harry’s stomach tightened. Remus too had lost his life during the Battle of Hogwarts a few months ago.
There was nothing to do, even if his status as a Kitsune made him the dominant one, deep down… "He’s quite submissive." Harry realised.
He sighed, and an idea came to him. Smirking, he pinned Harry on the wall and leaned forwards, whispering in his ear.
Harry sighed and joined their arms before they disappeared in an unpleasant and rather sickening twirl. They landed right before the shop, and Draco could not help but be amazed.
"If you want to, of course I will." Harry smiled softly. "Now focus back on our magics Honey, please."
"I’m pleasantly surprised." He admitted. "I thought I was in way deeper shit. This means I won’t be forced to bound with anyone, and won’t have to stay with the same person forever… If there’s a way to undo the blood bond."
"Is there a way Draco could get back his mother’s maiden name without people knowing about his condition?"
Proofs of the arguments: *diverse papers and notes about Lucius’s misdeeds and their divorce papers.*
Her voice was shaking and Draco’s heart break. He had never liked Blaise, but he was good to Pansy. He always treated her like a princess. Trying to comfort her, he gently patted her head, stroking her dark hair.
As Harry started to write, Draco explained everything. As Harry had only said they could not get 'too far' from each other, he omitted the fact that they had to keep a physical contact - for now. At this very right moment, only their knees were touching as they tried not to weird their friends out. Aside from this, he told them everything. By the time he was done, Harry had already tied the letter to Pigwidgeon’s leg and the owl was long gone. Pansy, Hermione and Ron started asking him questions about the bond restrictions and Draco could not help but be annoyed. He hated the attention Harry was getting. But it was Harry, he would always get attention. He gaped in realisation. Why in the world had he chosen the most famous guy to bond with? The one who would get the most attention and would make his Kitsune-possessiveness even worse? "Because you love him, you idiot."
Pansy obliged as Hermione got back to the book, trying not to lose her temper. "'Sanda Kitsune are of the thunder, wild and impulsive. Their fur can be of a pure white, a light yellow or a light blue. They are extremely powerful creatures, able not only to control the thunders but also lightning. Jikan Kitsune are time controllers, they can travel in it, stop it, accelerate it, slow it down. They are the most powerful ones after the Tengoku Kitsune, but their power is very rare and so prized that they had to go into hiding. Their fur will mostly be of a light colour, often a beige or a grey.' Do we keep this one?"
She flew in his direction, her now uncoloured hair floating behind, and caressed his cheek softly. He did not feel anything, he would never again feel her warmth against him. His hearth ached at the thought.
If the mother is a vampire, the offspring will inherit both powers and become a voracious creature that will probably end up being haunted down, considered too dangerous to live once they reach three tails. If they bred, the offspring would only inherit the vampire powers.
It did not work. Harry was like in a trance, gasping from air, his eyes wide open in horror. Distraught, Draco decided to imitate what his late mother would do. And so, he hugged him.
"I think you’re both strong enough for this." Hermione reassured. "The only matter is the time you have left to bond. You two should try spending a lot of time together and get closer. Even if you like each other, a bond’s love must be the strongest possible."
"I had to, we’re family after all." He softly answered. "I was surprised to see you with another member of the family though. I thought you two hated each other’s guts."
Harry quickly nodded and the cold fingers grabbed his erection strongly while the mouth in his neck started sucking his skin, leaving a trail of love bites behind. Harry arched his back, trying to get as close as possible to Draco’s erection. Smirking, he slid a few fingers under Harry’s waistband and adroitly got rid of his boxer. He grabbed his member and slowly started moving up and down while rubbing his own erection against Harry’s bum.
"Draco told me he was talking alone yesterday night but… Addressing his words to Ginny." She realised.
Argument (by Sirius Orion Black): "Lucius Malfoy is a known Death Eater and criminal. I don’t want his name to cause struggle to my first cousin once removed and to bring more shame to our family. As Narcissa had gotten back her maiden name, I think it is legitimate to ask for her son to get the Black name too."
They were walking towards the castle, the sun behind them warming their backs. Harry stopped and took his hands.
If the mother is human, the offspring will grow the Kitsune tails every eight years and will be able to use Kitsune magic after the third one. They would be able to breed without passing the Kitsune gene.
Before Draco could answer, a tall woman entered the room. Her blond hair were tied in a tight ponytail and she sported bright red lips. Next to their old potions teacher, she was like the sun.
"Don’t worry, he only talked to me. And I won’t share it with anyone." She paused, hesitating. "Do you want to talk about it?"
Draco’s disillusioned ears twitched and he shook his head to gain back his composure. Shyly, he freed his hands and cupped Harry’s face. His hearth was racing, he wanted it so bad. He looked at his mouth and then at his insisting green eyes before going back to his mouth. "Fuck it." He then thought, crushing their lips together. Harry instantly responded to the kiss, holding Draco’s waist and gently pulling him closer. Breathless, he moved away, but was held back by strong hands in his neck.
"Ryūji…" He said, feeling the word on his tongue. "What a beautiful name. What was he like, my father?"
"So," Draco started, "Harry and Gran- Hermione already know about what I’m going to tell you, and I decided I didn’t want anyone to feel left out. So here it is, Draco’s big secret." He smirked, wiping the air with his hand to remove the charm covering him.
While Ron nodded, Hermione silently thanked him. He was tapping his fingers on the table and his leg was shaking. He was probably the most stressed. "What’s happening?" He could not help thinking. "Is it about Draco and I? Only Draco? Death Eaters? A stupid event? What the fuck’s happening."
"Yeah, the bond kind of forced me to shut up. Seems like the submissive thing you read about is stronger than expected."
"What the fuck is he doing here?" He thought, kneeling down, looking more closely at Harry’s face. White strands were crossing his cheeks. Draco’s eyes widened. Right, he was crying yesterday night. But how dehydrated could one be for their tears to turn into salt? He looked at Harry again, he seemed different somehow, without the frown and clenched jaw. He took a deep breath and, shaking him softly, tried waking him up.
Draco had spent the whole week training after class, and after four days, was able to make his features appear and disappear without any meditation. Today was Halloween and he was happily getting ready for the ball that had been organised. He looked at himself in the mirror, satisfied by his vampire costume. Of course, the idea could be considered basic, but his outfit was far from it. He had managed to find an antique suit, had paled his skin even more thanks to a charm, turned his hair black, his eyes red and made his teeth longer and pointier. On top of it, he had managed to make his long nails appear and had dressed his hands of old rings and chains. Only one ting was bugging him: the ball was an hour away and Harry still had not asked him out. He sighed and let himself fall on the couch ungraciously. "What is he waiting for?" He thought with a pout.
"It said she knew about it since sixth year and that I should snatch what I want and make it mine. She told me to be selfish."
She chuckled and kissed him, then shot a cautious glare at Harry. His brows were furrowed but he did not make a comment.
Draco hummed as an answer and Harry opened the door. He was curled up in his bed and his tail was poking out of the covers.
Harry got up, interrupting his best friend, and left the Great Hall. She knew his feelings, she knew he would never try to approach him, no matter how much he wanted to. He was too guilty. And he did not have the guts. A knot tied in his stomach as he walked towards the Reminiscence Hall. He needed to talk to someone who would understand.
Hermione nodded. "You should send one to Sirius too, I bet he’d be proud to see you’ve finally decided to 'follow his good taste'" She teased, imitating his voice.
He smiled sadly. "It will depend on many things. If Harry and I bond in time, if he’s strong enough to support me, if I’m strong enough to stand the pain… I don’t know, Zee. No one could say."
She was clearly embarrassed, and so was Draco. He nodded nevertheless. He needed all the help he could find, even if it meant going trough unpleasant and embarrassing moments. She got up and came to sit next to him, attentively examining his ears and tail. Suddenly, she frowned and took Draco’s left hand - much to his displeasure - to look at his nails.
Red as a beet, Draco moved away. Strong hands immediately caught him, one in his neck and the other one in his lower back, and his and Harry’s lips were joined again, their tongues dancing. Harry broke the kiss, only to drop a kiss on his commissures, then on his cheeks, slowly descending on his jaw until he was in his neck, which he started to lick and bite softly, leaving pink marks and wet trails. As Draco was pulling his hair and softly moaning for more, he moved away.
"Granger. Mother died before my eighteenth birthday, and if you remembered my Father’s reaction I think you’d be smart enough to realise I’m not going to contact him. I’m not even sure I could if I wanted to."
During the last hour of this torture, Draco puked blood a couple of times more, and as Harry gave him all the power he could, the ninth tail finished its growth while the sun started rising in the sky. As light slowly illuminated their room and someone opened the door, they both fainted.
He held him close to him for another minute, enjoying Harry’s warmth and sweet smell, and then helped him lay down and covered him up. He stroked his hair a little bit more and, before leaving, leaned over him. As he was holding his fringe up, he planted a soft kiss on his forehead.
Hermione nodded. "'Chikyu Kitsune are calm and steady creatures, just like the earth they represent. They can be recognised by their brown and often spotted fu-"
Even though he wanted to answer, he felt like words would never come out. What was that? His lips were like tied to each other. His eyes opened wide when he realised. That was the bond making him submissive. "Holy shit. It’s fucking real." He thought. But the sensation he had just felt, of the bond preventing him to speak, had nothing to do with his wish to belong to Draco. Somehow, he could feel that the two events were not caused by the same thing. He started breathing slower, reassuring the newly set bond that he was not going to disobey. After a couple of seconds, he managed to part his lips, as if glue had just been removed. Draco was frowning.
He nodded. She smiled and sat on the ground, inviting him to do the same. Once settled, she gently asked:
Draco blushed heavily at Harry’s smirk and pushed him away shyly. When Harry tried to come closer again, he hissed: "Stop that!"
"Hello guys! Glad to see everyone’s on time today." She smiled. "We’re going to be making an Essence of Insanity. Take out your books page 34 and go gather your ingredients please. You’ll be working in pairs."
“Excellent observation Potter. I’ve left mine at home and Sirius lent me one from the family crypt. Now can we get on with the situation at hand or do I have to recite my life story to you before that?”
The pillow hits him square on the face. Somehow Harry ended up with a mouthful of pillow.  He can hear Dean’s guffaws as he sputters out a few stray feathers that managed to land in his  mouth. Fuck Neville for never mending that tear, Harry thinks fondly.
“At least we don’t have to worry about finding you a roommate for the ski trip? That’s the good news.”
Tonks had offered to do it, apparently. The Lupin-Black couple couldn’t bear to separate Teddy from her, so the three of them decided to raise him together. Teddy was going to have
“Listen here, sickly Victorian boy,” uh-oh. Harry knew that look. It meant Malfoy was going to get completely and utterly annihilated. “I don’t know what kind of fucked up privileges you might have gotten, but people like my sister and I have had to literally drag ourselves through the mud to study here.
"Shut up." Harry says, feeling a bit stupid. He only wants his friends to be happy. How was  he supposed to watch his friends dance around each other, so painfully in love, and not do anything about it?
Draco swallowed. He bit his lip and then glanced around as if waiting for masked maniacs to appear any second. “What’s the catch?”
Malfoy propped his head up on an elbow and smiled at him sweetly. “It’s already been established that there is absolutely no way to reverse this, and we will have to wait it out. So I thought, why spend Christmas looking like the Dark Lord-”
Draco tries not to glare at the Wizengamot official, strutting in his ugly plum robes. They weren’t even a
They stayed like that, unbearably close, until the embers died down and the dawning sun filtered through misty winter clouds.
The danger was imminent. Panic bubbled in his throat. “Moony, we have to help him.” Sirius gripped his shirt, crumpling the logo of Queen, Moony’s favourite band. “He’s going to
“How would you feel if you find an absolute casse-err..." Harry fumbled with the word a bit before deciding to fuck it. "-Prat sleeping on your godfather’s sofa?”
There was more fumbling from the kitchen and Sirius tried not to wince when he heard some Tupperware crash. Remus popped his head out and beamed at Draco, who was hiding behind Sirius.
Sirius pulls his knees to his chest, bracing himself for what he was about to say next. “I ran away when I was sixteen.”
“Wizengamot hereby sentences Draco Lucius Malfoy to four years of probation, after which all magical privileges shall be returned. He shall spend his probation serving a wizarding family chosen by the jury.”
“Well, Draco, I’ll just show you to your room then,” Mrs Weasley put her bags in the spacious kitchen. She waddled up the stairs and Draco followed meekly, too aware of Ginevra glaring a hole at the back of his head to relax.
“Babe?" He continued when Remus hummed in acknowledgement. "D’you know any Blacks around Harry’s age?”
They both turned to Harry. “Shut up.” Draco and Millicent 'call me Millie, hon' Bulstrode said in unison. Apparently they did that a lot. And it made Draco look a bit pointy too.
Harry watches, mouth agape, as she climbs aboard a Thestral, disappearing into the night sky. He doesn’t know if she’s talking about Sirius or Draco. All he sees is what he’s been missing.
Draco had always been closer to Remus, than to Sirius himself, but now, with the blond boy in his arms, Sirius felt certain Draco trusted him just as much.
She angrily got up and headed in their direction, under Ron and Pansy’s amused eyes. Harry hurriedly retreated. He did not want to mess with an upset Hermione. She started lecturing Draco but he could not stop smiling at her and she gave up.
Then Harry did something he decided he would blame on his head being slammed against the tree earlier. He beckoned Draco close, and when he was close enough, Harry pulled him between his legs. Then, he pressed his face into the crook of Draco’s neck.
“Harry!” Hermione calls, poking her head through the fireplace. “We’re coming in.” She has baby Rosie perched on her hip when she comes through. Ron’s wearing an obnoxiously bright orange jersey. Harry grimaced.
“Stop overreacting, Potter.” said Malfoy, who had not, in fact, given Harry his pillow back. It was under his feet now, with his own pillow under his head. Geez, Malfoy, why don’t you take the pillows off all the other beds and make yourself a fort?
“Greyback.” Harry growled. His body acted on its own as he stood up and harshly pulled the blond into his arms. The scent of honey and roses mixed with something not unlike cinnamon wafted up his nose.
And anyone with a right mind would be if they saw Malfoy  after Quidditch. It should be crime for him to look that good. Harry thinks dreamily.
They were also holding hands, but let's not get too observant, people. "The chocolates were a nice touch, Harry, but I'm lactose intolerant."
The gremlin at the counter checked their bags and handed them over without so much a Merry Christmas! Well, bah humbug to you too, lady Scrooge.
to hand over her shopping to Draco. Really, the woman looks all too pleased to dump it all on him. Though, Draco can’t say she was smiling when Molly told her to take Draco’s trunk upstairs if the shout of "but
Hermione snorted into her hot cocoa. "I hope you haven't forgotten our ski trip, Harry. We'll be in Bulgaria for the hols this time."
Draco and Fleur chattered excitedly in French, some of which Harry understood to be about… his hair? Perhaps it was time Draco learnt of his French lessons.
What had Neville said? Oh, yeah. Close your eyes and keep them shut until you pass out. Maybe if Harry suffocated himself with a pillow…
