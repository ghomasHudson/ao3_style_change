They arrived at a dead-end before Hagrid turned to face everyone. “Dis is like teh wall at teh Leaky C’ldron,” He said before tapping a pattern on the wall which Draco quickly memorized. “Yer names are on teh doors. Now go find yeh rooms.”
“I can’t let you do that,” Harry whispered. “I mean I’m already lost. There’s no way to help…” He trailed off.
The blonde kept whispering sweet things and rubbing the raven-haired boys back until his crying quieted and he fell asleep. Draco laid his head in his lap and played with his hair while he thought about everything that just happened.
He didn’t eat much of the apple before he sighed, it was about time to get to Kings Cross Station. Yes, it took him two hours to eat some of an apple. He threw the leftover apple in the garbage, grabbed his stuff, and flooed to the station.
Sighing, she said, “It’s ok, I just got worried because…” she trailed off, looking at Draco. “What are you doing here?” She spat.
“No, they would never talk to me unless they wanted me to do a chore or when I did it wrong,” He said. “What? What is it?” He asked looking around the group of 8th years. “Come on, someone tell me!”
“Did your family not tell you anything growing up?” He asked seriously, ignoring Pansy and Hermione who were laughing like hyenas.
“Ah- sorry,” He mumbled, looking away. “I just thought you wouldn’t be okay with it because of what he’s done to us in the past.”
Draco decided to leave the part about his cutting and eating disorder out of the story for Harry’s sake and Harry was grateful for that. He had snuggled closer to him to show his appreciation.
Draco sighed, “That’s fine. Let’s get ready before Hermione comes back up and drags us down in our pjs,” He said, referring back to 5th year when she did that to Harry.
“He hasn’t done anything to me, Ginny!” Harry yelled back. “And you’re not my girlfriend, we broke up months ago!”
“Er- well at the time you didn’t really like me since I ratted out your club and I guess so much went on after my birthday I never really found a good time to tell you,” Draco replied.
All of the 8th years got up from their seats and followed him out. They walked to a part of the school that Harry or Draco have never been in. ‘Must be a new addition,’ Draco thought as he walked beside Harry in the back of the group still holding his hand. Up in the front of the group they could hear Hagrid and Hermione talking about how his class will be this year.
“Oh, that’s great! I’m happy for you guys! And don’t worry about not being able to sit with me, I’ll be fine,” Harry smiled.
Sighing, Harry got up, following Draco’s lead, and walked out of the room. The walk back to the common room was spent in comfortable silence. Once there, the lecture started.
“W-well, it’s not like we weren’t sleeping in the same bed last night,” Draco reasoned, scratching the back of his neck in embarrassment. Harry only nodded in response. With a silent agreement, they climbed into opposite sides of the bed as far away from each other as possible.
Draco was shocked hearing this. All of the 7 years that he’s known him he always thought that he had a hero complex but he was only doing what other people told him. He felt bad about everything he had done and said to the boy.
Before any of them could reply Ron and Blaise came stomping down the stairs. “Come on guys, let’s get down to breakfast! I’m famished!” Ron said, already heading towards the entry wall. The four others got up from their seats slowly. Draco, Pansy, and Hermione giving Harry a worried look. Draco decided that he would talk about what he said with him later as he followed the group down to the Great Hall.
As per normal Ron filled his plate and dug in and Hermione was lecturing him about his bad eating habits. The Slytherins also got their food and started eating. Harry, however, just stared at the food in disgust.
“Is that what it normally is?” Draco asked. He grabbed Harry’s hand and started rubbing calming circles on the back of it.
Harry looked down at his lap, “I- uh- they did stop. It was just one of those random nightmares and when I woke up it kinda gave me flashbacks to y’know, the war and all. I’m fine now though.”
“What are you talking about? We aren’t planning anything,” Hermione said, giving him a questioning look.
“Alright,” he said smiling. “Let’s go before we miss the carriages,” he said, holding his hand out for him to take. Harry gladly took Draco’s hand and let himself be dragged to the carriages.
“Afternoon,” Draco corrected. “We seemed to have slept through lunch. Hermione and Pansy are probably going to kill us later.”
‘He sounds like a wonderful Healer,’ Draco replied, a glint in his eye that set heat building in Harry’s gut. ‘How do you plan to thank him?’
Malfoy lit up when talking about his work, Harry noticed. Gone was the closed-off, professional blankness that he’d affected at times when talking to Harry. Instead his eyes were bright, locked onto Harry’s as though to be sure he was listening and following along, and those smile lines around his eyes and mouth were back. A quiet sort of confidence, so different from the arrogance of his teenage years, emanated from him, and Harry was left in no doubt of Malfoy’s love for his work. It turned out that Malfoy talked with his hands, too, when he was passionate about something, and Harry couldn’t decide whether he wanted to watch Malfoy’s face or his hands more as he spoke.
‘How does that feel?’ Malfoy was watching Harry intently, his eyes flicking between Harry’s arm and his face.
‘Teddy isn’t a pure-blood though,’ Draco said finally, grasping at straws, trying to think of something that would mean he didn’t have to do this. ‘I thought Professor Lupin was Half-blood. And Tonks definitely wasn’t a pure-blood.’
‘Ava wouldn’t shut up,’ Malfoy said, his voice laced with frustration as he stalked over to Harry, crowding him against the wall with his body before catching Harry’s lips in a punishing kiss.
Draco’s been feeling off kilter since he last saw Potter, his nerves raw and his anxiety peaking after revisiting the war. He’s been sleeping badly, alternating between nightmares about the Dark Lord that leave him screaming and dreams full of Potter that make his heart ache when he wakes up alone.
Potter’s hands move to bracket Draco’s face, trapping him against the window, the small flexes of his biceps catching the corner of Draco’s eye. There’s so much power, both physical and magical, hidden just below the surface of Potter and Draco loves it. He almost wants to try and move away, just to see how Potter reacts.
‘Wait,’ he called, and when Malfoy stopped walking to the door, Harry scrambled to think of something to ask him. ‘Um, what happened with the match?’ Ron had already told him, of course, but it was all Harry’s panicked brain could think of to ask about.
‘Anyway, we can figure out the whys later, let’s focus on the curses. I don’t want to be here forever.’
‘It’s not pity money!’ Potter roars, shocking Draco with the force of his emotion. ‘I hated paying you, alright? Is that what you want to hear?’
‘It’s an old curse, a combination of bonding spell and sex magic, designed to keep couples together and make sure they consummated their marriage,’ Malfoy sighed, his eyes no longer meeting Harry’s. ‘You’ll be in pain until we…’
He’s leaning against the window frame, looking out onto the street far below, watching the Friday night crowds on the terrace of the bar opposite. It’s one of the things he loves best about Paris, the buzz that fills the city on warm summer nights like this, when the terraces overflow with people drinking and smoking and chatting and revelling in life. He hadn’t planned on staying for so long when he’d first fled here, after several years of hatred had driven him out of Britain. But he’d found his place, here in the city, and it’s home now. He’s happy here.
‘Not often. I don’t really have the time,’ he said, before adding with a slight glint in his eye, ‘and we don’t all have a pro team or a giant adopted family constantly on hand to play with either.’
Although he knew he should go home and see Ginny, tell her everything, confess and hope she was a better person than he was and could forgive him, Harry instead sank down onto the bed, dropping his head into his hands. He sat there for a long time, not moving, unable to face seeing Ginny but unsure what else to do, his mind a whirlwind as he tried to come to terms with what had just happened. He’d never expected to be the type of man who cheated on his wife, but he had, and he would have to live with that for the rest of his life.
‘When I have nightmares I always find moving helps,’ Malfoy said simply. ‘We can go to the tearoom.’
Malfoy seemed to be feeling the same satisfaction too, as the cold blankness that had clouded his features when they first began working had vanished, replaced by flushed cheeks and a small but definitely present smile. He’d discarded his outer robes an hour or so into their work, and had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. When Harry glanced over at one point to see Malfoy running a hand through his hair, leaving it rumpled and dishevelled, he had to look away quickly, his stomach turning over at the sight. Harry might be married, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t still appreciate an attractive man.
The time went by in a whirlwind, Harry overwhelmed both mentally and also with things to do. Although Ginny had gone back to the Burrow after Harry had told her his decision, she had come back again the next day so that they could plan. Harry had told her to stay in their house, offering to move to Grimmauld. They had both agreed that they wanted to keep the news to themselves for as long as possible, to give them time to process before the press and the public began to pry, and if Ginny rented or bought another house, they would lose that secrecy. Harry still owned Grimmauld Place—it had never felt right to sell it—and he could easily move there without anyone knowing.
‘You do make a good point, shockingly,’ he said slowly, Harry making an indignant noise at the casual insult. ‘He did always have a bit of an issue with our friendship, so he would definitely be annoyed if he thought we were dating.’
In true Pansy style, she doesn’t give Draco any warning of her visit, instead turning up on his doorstep one afternoon, matching luggage in hand.
‘I’m sorry, I’ll try and be more interesting from now on.’ Harry laughed, the rumble in his chest vibrating through Draco, the intimate tone in his voice making Draco more than a little interested.
The match raged below him, fast and furious and more than a little dirty. They’d had multiple fouls called on both sides already. It was the first match of the new season, and everyone was a bit on edge. Nerves warred with excitement, leaving everyone skittish and jumpy and resulting in one of the tightest, most exciting games Harry had played in a long time. Puddlemere were aiming to win the League this season, and Oliver had endlessly drilled into them the importance of getting a good start, of establishing dominance early on, and they were feeling the pressure.
, and that was the starkest difference. He didn’t look like he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, as he so often had during school and at Draco’s trial. He was laughing freely, clearly loving every minute of his time with Teddy, and Draco found himself strangely unable to look away.
‘That’s ‘cause he knows you’re easy now,’ Harry replied. ‘Why should he give you a good price when he knows you’ll pay the high one?’
They stood in silence for a moment, and then Malfoy sighed. ‘I should probably go,’ he said, his gaze locked on Harry. Something in his expression made Harry’s stomach flip, and he had the sudden urge to grab Malfoy’s hand, to ask him to stay, just for a little bit longer.
‘You should see the back room.’ Malfoy nodded towards a door leading out of the kitchen. ‘It was definitely some kind of potions room or similar, the detection spells were off the charts.’
They stayed in Harry’s bed for hours afterwards, the burning need exhausted but a smouldering desire still present as Draco leisurely explored Harry’s body, discovering the places that made Harry sigh in pleasure, Harry tracing the faint scars that still littered Draco’s chest, Draco brushing away his attempted apologies. It was in the past now, and Draco didn’t want to focus on that. He wanted to look forward. That was what the lessons had all been about, after all. Looking forward, helping Teddy, ensuring that the world would be better in the future. When they’d finally had their fill of each other, Harry sighed and got out of bed, Draco immediately mourning the loss of Harry’s skin against his own.
Harry’s comfort levels took a turn for the worse, however, when Millie clapped her hands and announced that it was time for Harry to try on some robes that were already made, so she could see how the fabric worked with his body. Popping out into the front of the shop, she returned bearing armfuls of robes and suits, handing the first one, a set of dark blue dress robes, to Harry to try on.
But Harry couldn’t dwell on that now, nor on the fact that the injury had been caused in a chase very similar to this. He had to beat Farrell and the Magpies, and he had to do it now. He dodged to the right to avoid one of the Magpies’ Chasers, the world turning upside down as he barrel-rolled, and then urged his broom forward as he righted himself. Farrell was still just behind him, and Harry knew he would take advantage of any moment of weakness or hesitation from Harry. Harry’s thighs ached from where he was gripping the broom so tightly, his whole body straining to go faster, but it was paying off, as he inched ever closer to the Snitch.
And then Potter moans, and Draco’s eyes snap open. He needs to know what Potter looks like when he comes, needs to be able to remember every detail of this so he can revisit it later. And Merlin, Potter is gorgeous in pleasure, his mouth falling open, his head tilting back to reveal the long line of his neck. Draco has a sudden urge to lick it. He knows the image of Potter’s face looking like this will be seared into his mind forever.
‘Oh,’ Harry said, looking anywhere but at Malfoy. ‘Yeah—I mean, just feeling a bit under the weather. Busy week, you know… I think I’ll just—just go and get some fresh air.’ Harry’s cheeks were burning as he scrambled out of his seat, pushing past the others in his hurry to get outside, away from all the eyes he could feel on him.
Draco pushes off his trousers, lingering for a moment, fully aware of how the dark red material contrasts with his pale skin, his erection tightly outlined, letting Potter know just how aroused Draco is by this, by
Draco stopped in his tracks, relieved to realise that Potter hadn’t spotted him yet, too busy looking up at the handwritten menus above the counter, squinting despite his glasses. Draco took a moment to quietly look at Harry, his first glimpse of him since Harry had spoken in Draco’s defense at his trial. In some ways, Potter had changed almost beyond recognition, but in other ways he was still the same as he had been back then. His glasses had been updated, far more fashionable now than the horrible frames he’d worn at school, and his clothes no longer swamped him. In fact, they almost clung to his body, his t-shirt straining against his arm muscles. That was the biggest and most obvious change of all - the scrawny, malnourished child had been replaced by a fit, healthy man, and Draco couldn’t even begin to process that. Thankfully Potter’s hair was still just as horrific as always, and that more than anything gave Draco the courage to stop hiding behind the coffee machine and make his way behind the counter.
Harry had put his arm on the arm rest, eyes still firmly on the screen and seemingly oblivious to the fact that his arm was now pressed against Draco’s, who was definitely not oblivious to it at all. In fact, all of Draco’s attention was now firmly focused on the points where their skin touched, the world narrowing to just the feel of Harry’s skin on his. He was dimly aware of the film starting, dramatic music filling the cinema as the opening scene began, but his attention barely strayed from Harry’s arm, even as he kept his eyes locked on the screen, trying to seem unaffected.
‘You all right, Potter?’ Evangeline said a few minutes later, interrupting Harry’s increasingly panicked internal monologue, and Harry looked up to see that everyone at the table, including Malfoy, was looking at him with concern on their faces.
The discovery of the mug broke the slight awkwardness and uncertainty that had built between them since leaving the cinema, and Draco began to feel more at ease—still jittery, and still desperately hoping to be able to touch Harry again soon, but that faded into a pleasant simmering need, noticeable enough but not so distracting that he couldn’t talk to Harry normally. They didn’t reference what had happened in the cinema as they chatted while Harry made the tea, but it was constantly present, an unspoken tension in the air, Harry’s gaze lingering on Draco for longer than usual, both of them aware of what was building but not yet mentioning it, content to let it take its time to come into bloom.
Harry hurriedly stripped off his clothes when he reached the bathroom, stepping into the shower and turning up the water temperature until it tipped over into too hot, the water like needles against his skin. He poured too much shower gel into his palm and scrubbed until every inch of his body was covered in soapy bubbles, then washed it off and did the same thing again. He repeated it again and again, until his skin was red and raw, but he still didn’t feel clean. How could he go downstairs and have dinner with Ginny, a dinner she’d lovingly prepared, when he could still feel the ghost of Malfoy’s hands on him? When the pleasure he’d felt at Malfoy’s touch was still so fresh in his mind? How was he supposed to even look at her without his face immediately giving away everything? Harry pressed his forehead against the cool tiles as guilt overpowered him, letting the water beat down on his back as he squeezed his eyes tightly shut against the tears that threatened to spill over.
‘Not really, you’re very boring. I expected more from Dickhead no 1,’ Draco teased, his heart skipping when Harry came up behind him and wrapped his arms around him, his chest warm and solid against Draco’s back.
He led Harry over to the showers, their hands clasped tightly together, his thumb stroking idly over the back of Harry’s hand, even that simple touch going straight to Harry’s cock. At the entrance to the showers they paused, and Draco pulled Harry into a deep kiss, their mouths opening on a groan. Draco’s hand roamed over Harry’s body, the sensation even better than Harry had dreamed it would be all those months ago in the hospital. Slowly, Draco stripped Harry, pausing their kiss only for long enough to pull Harry’s top over his head, his mouth capturing Harry’s again as soon as he could. Harry felt drunk on it, lost in feeling, and he barely noticed Draco removing his own clothes before pulling him into the shower and turning it on.
‘Merlin, I don’t know,’ Harry said, shrugging his shoulders and finally moving from the doorway where he had been frozen with worry. ‘Cause you don’t want to go alone and have your ex see you with no date?’
Harry was distracted for the rest of the afternoon by thoughts of Malfoy, and Malfoy’s hands, and when he might next get to see him, talk to him. Learning about Malfoy’s decision to become a Healer had only made Harry more curious about him. He found himself idly wondering what Malfoy did when he wasn’t at work—where did he hang out? Did he still see his friends from school or had he made new ones? Was he seeing anyone? That last question popped into Harry’s head without warning, and his stomach turned over. He couldn’t get rid of the image of those hands on someone else’s skin, and a hot anger he hadn’t felt in a long time burned in his chest.
‘Merlin, Potter, is that the last time you wore dress robes? I remember that ball - who knows what compelled the organisers to think that inviting children was a good idea - and it was years ago! Have you seriously not bought any new robes since then?’
‘What do you think of these?’ She held the fabrics out to Harry, letting him touch them, feel the silky softness.
Some topics were much harder though, and Draco had been wary of bringing them up, still not entirely sure how to broach them. Teddy was the one who brought up the war first, asking why Draco had been on the opposite side to Harry, and Draco had to scramble to find the words to explain why blindly following your family and their beliefs wasn’t always the right thing to do, no matter what your parents and the people you trusted were telling you. Draco had cried when he got home after that session, and the lesson where they had discussed the traditional role of the heir of the family also left him aching with sadness for the child he had been and the things he’d done wrong. He thought he’d worked through a lot of the conflicting feelings he’d had towards his family after the end of the war—he’d even had a few sessions with a Mind Healer once his court-mandated house arrest came to an end—but talking about it with Teddy was bringing all the pain to the surface again.
‘Really?’ Malfoy’s eyes had lit up at Harry’s words, and his fingers twitched slightly, as though he wanted to reach out and close the distance between them. Steeling himself, Harry reached over and took Malfoy’s hand, entwining their fingers, the simple touch making his heart leap.
‘See you next week, Potter,’ Malfoy said, and then he was gone, the crack of his Disapparition reverberating around the alley. With anticipation for the following week already bubbling in his veins, Harry followed suit and disappeared into thin air.
After several weeks of watching training sessions and diligently exercising, the team physio finally cleared Harry to rejoin the team for actual training. Harry woke up the day of his first training session with a stomach full of fluttering Snitches, excitement warring with nerves as he got ready for training. He couldn’t wait to fly again, but there was an undercurrent of worry that his body wouldn’t hold up and that he’d be set back further in his recovery. As soon as he kicked off, though, all of Harry’s worries melted away. It felt incredible to be up in the air, and his body reacted instinctively, shifting into the right position and moving as though one with his broom. With the words of his physio and Oliver echoing in his ears, Harry forced himself to take it as gently as he could, even as every fibre of his being wanted to let loose. By the time he landed after an hour or so of flying, Harry was glad he’d followed their advice—his muscles were aching, his hip tight, but the happiness flooding through Harry drowned out any pain he was in.
‘Shit.’ Harry thought quickly, making up his mind, hoping he wouldn’t come to regret his decision. All Harry could think was that if the situation was reversed, he’d want Ginny to do anything that kept her alive, however it made him feel. ‘Well, I’m up for it if you are.’
‘Ah, of course.’ Harry had forgotten entirely about Friday drinks, a tradition that the whole office tended to take part in. Harry didn’t go every week, but he was enough of a regular that it was natural for Evangeline to assume he would be joining them.
‘Not as much as I used to,’ Harry said. ‘After the war we spent a lot of time together—I didn’t like being alone, back then. Obviously now we’re busier, with jobs, and they’ve got Rose, but I still see them and the rest of the Weasleys a lot.’
‘True.’ Malfoy looked thoughtfully over at Harry, his fingers still twisting round and round each other, drawing Harry’s eye and reminding him of his dreams. ‘The others all banded together, after the war—the ones that escaped Azkaban, at least—talking about how unfair it was, how they would rise up again. They had no interest in changing, in reconsidering their views, even as society lined up to condemn them and spit at them in the streets.’
‘You’re not ready,’ Malfoy said after a long moment of silence, and Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t referring to his half-dressed state.
Malfoy took a deep breath, then said the words that made Harry’s heart sink to the ground. ‘If we don’t do anything, it’ll kill you.’
Harry bit back a smile as Hermione shot a frustrated but fond look at Ron. Their bickering occasionally drove him mad, but at times like these, when he was stuck in a strange sterile hospital room, listening to them felt comforting, like a little bit of home. Harry was pulled out of his thoughts suddenly by Ron swearing loudly.
The rest of the day passed in a blur of pain as the Skele-Gro continued to work its magic. Harry’s wrist was already feeling significantly better, and the pain in his ribs had reduced to a dull ache, a marked improvement from the shooting agony that had accompanied his every movement after the accident. He could still feel the Skele-Gro working on his hip though, and the ebbing and flowing pain made it hard for him to concentrate on anything. His frustration at being confined to a hospital bed was increasing with every hour that passed, and he latched onto the hope that soon Malfoy would deem him well enough to start moving around. He couldn’t spend much longer like this. He hated being still, being trapped, unable to do anything useful, and the need to move burned under his skin, almost more powerful than the burn of the Skele-Gro.
‘I’m sure you’ll be glad to fly again, at least? It can’t be often you’re stuck on the ground for this long.’
‘Did you know,’ Teddy continued, breezing right past Draco’s speech, far too distracted by thoughts of Hogwarts, ‘that there are ghosts there, and one of them doesn’t have a head?’
He wants that now, wants Draco’s hands on him, and he bucks his hips up in the bath, letting Draco see the effect his touch is having. The cool air of the bathroom is a shock to his cock after the warmth of the water, but it’s worth it to see the expression on Draco’s face as he looks at Harry’s erection.
‘Yes. I remember it vividly—you don’t forget this feeling, after all.’ Harry nodded in agreement at that. ‘I remember my father telling me that he had brought me here to show me why we had to look out for ourselves, to protect ourselves and our heritage from Muggles and others who would want to destroy us. I hate that framing of it now—we can protect magic without hating Muggles—but at the time it was what all pure-blood children were told.’
‘Dunno,’ Harry mumbled, his mouth dry from the match and passing out. He thought for a moment, cataloguing his aches and pains, mentally checking in with each part of his body, from his sore head down to his feet. He was injured, that was for sure—his chest and side were burning with a gradually increasing pain, and his leg felt funny and swollen. ‘Bit sore, my leg…’ he started to say, but his words trailed off as he finally turned to look at his Healer.
Draco’s hard, and he knows the loose fabric of his joggers isn't hiding anything. But Potter’s mouth has him shameless, and he bucks up against Potter’s crotch, relieved to find that Potter is equally hard in his jeans. He doesn’t even know what he wants—Potter’s cock in his mouth? His cock in Draco’s arse? To rub up against Potter like this until they both fall apart? He’d take anything, do anything at this point to quell the urgent need taking him over.
But then Potter changes target, and suddenly his lips are on Draco’s jaw, trailing down his neck to his collarbone. Draco’s suddenly glad that Jean-Luc likes him to be dressed casually—he wants the boyfriend experience—because the soft white t-shirt that Draco had chucked on over his grey joggers shifts easily out of the way of Potter’s mouth. Draco moans as Potter finds the extra sensitive spot just below his neck, and Potter picks up on it, redoubling his efforts and reducing Draco to a shaking mess just with his tongue and teeth.
‘I’m not sure that makes it any better, Potter,’ Draco sighed, finally looking up. ‘He’ll probably turn up with some young model or a famous Quidditch player as his date, and I’ll look a fool.’
But then Malfoy looked away from the window, glancing down at his watch. ‘Merlin, it’s late, and I have early rounds tomorrow,’ he said, reminding Harry that he was only here because this was his job. ‘Do you need help getting back to bed?’
,’ he repeated, his hands visibly shaking as he slowly rotated on the spot, his face tilted to face the sky.
‘All right. If you change your mind, just alert me or one of the mediwizards.’ Malfoy turned to leave the room, and Harry was seized with a sudden sense of panic at the thought of being left on his own once again.
‘So I sent you your money back, surely you should be happy? You got to fuck me for free, plenty of my clients would love that.’
A knock on the door interrupted them before either of them could say anything else, and the mediwitch who had been there when Harry first woke up after his accident poked her head around the door.
A glowing arctic fox burst out of the tip of his wand, immediately beginning to prowl, looping around them in a wide circle, eyes locked on the stag in apparent curiosity rather than fear. The three of them stood and watched, silent and awed, as the fox and the stag moved closer together, circling until they met, each sniffing the other warily. They seemed to decide that there was no threat, and then they were running, jumping, playing, together in the wide expanse of the valley, their silvery light bright against the dark green grass.
Draco however had stopped writing at the entry of the memos, the sound of his quill ceasing as he paused to read the messages. Harry paid no attention to this, continuing to consider his case file - if there was anything important in the memos Draco would tell him, especially if it would help with their cases. Despite Harry’s initial reservations, they’d ended up making a good team, Draco far happier dealing with the internal bureaucracy of the Ministry than Harry, which left Harry free to focus on the more practical aspects of solving cases and leaping into danger while Draco ensured that all their activities were at least skirting the edge of the Auror Code of Conduct, if not actively adhering to it.
‘It’ll be fine, we’ll just change the subject if something comes up that we’re not sure about,’ Harry said. ‘Come on, let’s get it over with.’
‘Mum was listening to the match and had absolute kittens when she heard you fall, she’s been firecalling us non-stop asking how you are,’ Ron explained. ‘She wanted to come and visit but Dad persuaded her to wait.’
Sorry, this took so long, I had a ton of writer's block and no motivation to continue. I guess that was kind of rude of me to leave you on that cliffhanger too... Thank you for all the support! I hope you enjoyed this short chapter!
“I’ll explain it more to you later if you want. I think it would be best if I got you to the Hospital Wing though. I don’t feel like dealing with an angry Madam Pomfrey at the moment,” Draco sighed, looking around over his wings at the whispering crowd around them.
Draco sighed a breath of relief. At least he didn’t reject him outright. “Yeah, that’s fine! Take all the time you need, Harry.” He gave Harry a reassuring smile before standing up and brushing off his clothes. “Well, I’ll leave you alone then. I should get ready for the day. I’ll come back later to make sure you’re alright if that’s fine with you?”
Ginny had come up to him before class had started and tried to sit next to Harry before Ron -- not so subtly -- pushed her out of the way and started a conversation with him about Quidditch.
“You’re going to have to tell them now,” Draco whispered. Harry knew he was right. Hermione wouldn’t leave him alone until he told her the truth and she’d know if he lied.
When they arrived Harry saw Draco sitting over with his friends at the Slytherin table and blushed. Ron and Hermione saw this and smirked at each other. Hermione linked arms with Harry.
“Yeah, let's go,” He said. “By any chance did you try to bring me over to their table without me noticing earlier?” He asked Hermione with a smirk as they walked over to Draco.
Harry took a deep breath and looked up at her. “I’ll tell you later,” he whispered, giving her a soft smile.
“Malfoy,” Harry responded when he saw who it was. He looked back out the window as the train started to move. The entire time he felt Malfoy’s eyes on him. Harry wasn’t bothered by it though, he was used to people staring at him. After all, he is Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. The one that killed Voldemort.
“All I see is two people who used to fight becoming friends. Now let’s go,” She said, walking out, Ginny following.
I reach their door and knock on it. “Harry? Malfoy? Are you guys ok? It’s nearly breakfast time,” I said through the door. I waited a moment listening for a response but I didn’t get one so I knocked again. “Harry? Draco?” I ask, starting to get a little worried. “If you don’t answer in the next 5 seconds I’m coming in!” I warn.
His two friends kept sending worried glances his way when they thought he wasn’t paying attention. ‘
It was the same dream every night and every time he’d wake up crying. This morning when he woke up, however, the dream had affected him more than it had other nights. He sat up in Sirius’ bed drenched in sweat and hyperventilating.
“Sure, tink dats fer teh bes’,” he said before standing up and addressing the entire Great Hall. “Good evenin’ ev'ryone. Can teh 8th yer’s follow me to yer commn room.”
When they got there Hermione said goodbye and walked over to Ron to sit next to him, leaving Draco and Harry the last empty table.
After class Harry quickly got up and packed his stuff. Once finished, he grabbed Draco - who wasn’t finished packing up - and dragged him out of the room. Sighing, he yelled to Pansy before they reached the door. “Pansy! Grab my stuff, would you? I have to go!”
Draco chuckled, rubbing his hand up and down Harry’s shoulder. “It’s just the way she is, dork,” He replied, earning another whine from Harry.
Thinking for a minute, he thought of something. He let go of Harry’s hand and paced in front of the wall. The door appeared and Draco dragged Harry in before anyone passed by.
Harry played with the sleeves of Draco’s hoodie for a second, looking down at the ground. “Um,” He started, “I’m sorry for putting you in that position earlier.” He brought up his little episode. “J-just, please don’t tell Ron or Hermione. I don’t want to worry them more than they already are,” He pleaded.
“Honestly Harry, do you even read the letters we send you?” Hermione sighed before continuing, “Ron and I have been chosen by Headmistress McGonagall to act as Head of House this year while she is getting used to her new position or finds a new teacher to be the new Head of house. That means that we won’t be able to sit with you on the train this time. We have to go to the Perfects cabin to find out what we will be doing,” she explained.
“You filthy Death Eater! Tell me what you did to my boyfriend right now!” She said, pulling her wand out.
The reason he didn’t want this to happen today was because today was the first day back at Hogwarts. He had been invited to learn again as an 8th-year student as well as all the other students in his year. He knew that if there were fresh cuts on his arm someone was bound to find out but he couldn’t help it.
This man, a shady potions dealer, is a significantly better dueller than Harry had anticipated, and rivers of sweat are flowing down Harry’s face as he tries to land the final blow and capture him. Harry doesn’t doubt for a second that they’ll get him though, not when Draco is next to him, whirling like a fury as he alternates between offence and defence, his movements in perfect harmony with Harry’s. It’s like a dance they’ve choreographed, both knowing their part and moving seamlessly together, covering each other’s weak spots and boosting their strengths.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, finally looking up out of Draco’s shoulder. He saw the distressed faces of his newfound friends and the puffy-eyed red faces of his ‘brother and sister.’ This is why he didn’t want them to know. They would obsessively start to worry about him rather than do things that were important for them to do for themselves. He hated that he was going to make them worry about him and hid his face back into Draco’s shoulder.
On the way to the Great Hall, I think about Harry and Malfoy. There are two ways that they could become good friends like that after being at each other's throats for the past 8 years but I’m not sure which one of my theories is right. I’ll have to go to the library later to do some research.
Harry smiled and pulled Draco back into a hug. “Thank you. Thank you so much for everything,” Harry said.
Harry leaned over to Ron who was sitting next to him and -- not so quietly -- whispered, “What does he mean ‘Not like that?” Causing Ron to spit out his food and start coughing.
They looked over the movies for a few minutes before Harry reached out and grabbed a movie. “Let’s watch this!” He said, holding up a DVD called ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show’.
“Some people that go through a creature inheritance have soulmates who that person loves with all their heart. The other person does get a choice on whether or not they want to be with them but they both would only be truly happy if they stayed together. Thinking about it really makes me want to have a mate,” Hermione explained.
After the movie, Harry and Draco decided to take a nap. Harry asked the room to give them beds but it only gave them one. They looked at each other blushing.
“Yeah, that’s fine. I’m sorry about earlier, too. I don’t know why I did that to be honest. I guess I got trapped in my head again,” Harry said, returning the small smile.
“I don’t know. As long as I can remember I guess. But after 5th year I started having dreams about Voldemort,” Harry answered, looking at his lap.
They pulled out their textbooks, parchment, quills, and some ink before turning to talk to one another while waiting for the new professor.
Harry walked back over to the couch and cuddled up next to Draco with a bowl of popcorn in his lap. Draco put an arm around Harry, getting comfortable, and grabbed a handful of popcorn.
“Oh, um, I guess. Well, I - um, I don’t really know how to explain what I did,” Harry lied. “But I did find some more rooms that we never cleaned out. There’s a whole ‘nother library full of books that I’m sure you’d like, ‘Mone. I also found a room that looked like Sirius had hid a ton of Gryffindor things in. Like, there was a whole freaking lion running around on the wallpaper that was painted red and gold and the carpet was red and - and - there was just so much!” Harry laughed. “Though it looked like it was found. Maybe after he ran away -- I don’t know, but it was all torn up and burnt. I fixed it up though and I found pictures of the Marauders…” Harry trailed off, looking down at the ground as they walked.
The journey to the Ministry was far smoother than their Tube journey the previous week, and within minutes they were in Draco’s office. It wasn’t the biggest, or the most well appointed, but he loved it. It was his space, and over the years he’d worked at the Ministry he’d tried to make it his own. The boring wallpaper that lined the room was obscured by bookshelves he’d brought in which housed his extensive selection of magical theory books, as well as a few novels that he liked to read on the rare occasion he actually got to take a lunch break. He’d found a rug in an antiques shop that covered the cold flagstones on the floor, making the room cosier than it had been when he’d first taken ownership of it. It felt like such a private place, an extension of himself, that he felt vulnerable showing Harry. Having Teddy there didn’t feel like such a big deal— he’d immediately been distracted by a very rare and fiddly contraption that Draco had left on his desk when he’d left work on Friday evening—whereas Harry was still looking around, taking his time to peruse the bookshelves and look at the pictures on Draco’s desk. Draco couldn’t help watching Harry, taking in the way his hands moved as he picked up objects on Draco’s desk, and the way his expression changed when he spotted something that gave away a little more of Draco’s inner workings. He couldn’t help but hope that everything Harry saw was giving him a favourable impression of Draco—for reasons he couldn’t, or maybe wouldn’t, quite articulate, it mattered what Harry thought of him.
‘I-’ Harry started, running a hand through his hair as he appeared to search for words. ‘I’ve had a bit of a day, I suppose.’
Before he can even open his mouth to say something, Potter pushes past him, invading Draco’s flat, anger radiating off him, the air sparking around him. For the first time, Draco sees the war hero, the man who was capable of facing down evil and vanquishing it.
‘So far, yes.’ Draco nodded, caught off guard by the way Harry was looking so intently at him. ‘Minus a few incidents with Muggle technology anyway,’ he added with a slightly awkward chuckle which he immediately hated himself for.
All week he’d been haunted by the memory of the kiss, somehow even worse than the memories of the incident, because this time he’d done it on purpose, for no reason other than that he’d wanted to. He couldn’t tell himself that it was fine, that he’d had to do it to save his life, that Ginny would understand because she’d want him alive, no matter the cost. He’d wanted Malfoy, so he’d kissed him. But at least it was only a kiss.
‘Well I didn’t die this time at least,’ Harry joked weakly, a strange need to see that smile again taking over him.
As soon as they’re in Draco’s bedroom, Harry is kissing him again, his hands roaming over Draco’s body, slipping under his shirt and tracing the skin hidden there. Every touch has Draco trembling, and as Harry slowly undresses him, it’s all he can do not to beg for more.
‘Maybe you shouldn’t have taken that advice so literally,’ Malfoy said, a hint of a smile flashing across his face. It was nothing like the sneer that used to appear on Malfoy’s face so often at Hogwarts, and Harry was taken aback at how different it made him look. Combined with his slightly rumpled hair and his lime-green robes, Malfoy looked so very different from the prim and proper boy he’d been at school. He seemed tired, Harry thought, the bags under his eyes more pronounced than they had been earlier, the shadows in the dark room exaggerating them even more.
‘Right,’ he said, at first as though just to himself, then repeating it again, more firmly this time. ‘Right, I think I know what this is. I still want to have a look, but come here, stay close.’
It only got worse when Harry was changing out of the last set of dress robes. He was exhausted, his nerves frayed from so much time spent with Draco in such an intimate setting, and he was more than ready to escape home to a quiet bedroom where he could sink into the memories of Draco’s eyes on him. Harry pulled the final set of dress robes off over his head, leaving him in nothing but a pair of tight boxers, and bent down to pick his jeans up off the floor. As he straightened up again, Harry looked into the mirror, and his heart skipped a beat when he saw Draco’s face reflected back at him. Draco was supposed to be facing the other way, but instead he was looking at Harry, naked want written in every line of his face. As Harry stood up fully, Draco’s eyes snapped up, away from Harry’s body, and their eyes met in the mirror, Draco’s widening in shock as he realised Harry had seen him. Harry didn’t look away, instead smiling slightly, hoping to convey to Draco that it was okay, that he didn’t mind. He didn’t try to hide the effect Draco’s interest was having on him and he felt heat rush through him as he saw the exact moment Draco noticed, Draco’s sharp intake of breath visible even from a distance. They stood for a long moment, eyes locked on each other’s through the mirror, letting the tension build, the unspoken interest suddenly out in the open, and Harry thought that he’d never felt anything so incredible in his life.
Harry copied Malfoy’s movement, the small stretch more intense than he’d expected after several days of not moving his wrist.
Harry wanted so much; he wanted to taste Malfoy, to let his hands discover every inch of his skin, every peak and valley of his body, to sink into him again and again, to feel Malfoy inside him, but he couldn’t bear to pull away for long enough for any of that, too lost in Malfoy’s kisses and the motion of their bodies as they rocked into each other. Harry’s orgasm crested quickly, too powerful for him to stop, and he came with a gasp and a whispered
‘Happy to be of service,’ Harry said as Teddy and Andromeda came back into the room, Teddy happily chomping his way through a bag of Hula Hoops.
‘If you need anything, don’t hesitate to let us know,’ Malfoy said, before gesturing to Grace to go through the door, adding, ‘after you.’
Without thinking, Harry shot out a hand, reaching for Malfoy. His hand landed on Malfoy’s arm and Malfoy instinctively turned back around, glancing down at Harry’s hand on his arm for a moment, before looking up at Harry’s face. Following the instinct that had told him to reach out, Harry stepped forward, closing the gap between them, and leaned up slightly, pressing his lips against Malfoy’s.
‘Well if you can’t fly with them, we’ll have to go some time. Have a rematch, finally figure out who the best Seeker really is.’ The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them, before he could remind himself that Malfoy was just his Healer, and was only spending time with him because it was his job. Harry might be finding himself with some slightly uncomfortable new feelings for Malfoy, but that didn’t mean Malfoy reciprocated them in any way.
It was a quiet, drizzly afternoon, the cafe relatively empty as people hid from the rain and gloom at home. A few patrons had braved the weather and sat warming themselves with coffees and hot chocolates, chatting quietly or reading the paper. Draco liked the cafe on days like this. He loved the buzz of the morning rush, of course, loved seeing visual proof that people wanted to come here, but there was something different about the cafe on a damp weekday afternoon. It became cosy, homelike, the low murmur of conversation mixing with the soothing music playing through the speakers. This was what Draco had envisaged, when he had first decided to open a cafe; people finding a calming space to relax and unwind in, alone or with company, and nothing made him happier than being here when it was like this.
As Draco lay in bed that night, tossing and turning and failing to fall asleep, guilt curdled in his stomach. How could he teach Teddy all the lies he was brainwashed into believing as a child? Teddy was such a sweet, open, loving child. He shouldn’t have hate poured into his veins, hate that would warp him, damage him, make him do things he’d regret. Draco couldn’t be a part of that. After the war he’d made a promise to himself to make sure that things got
Harry had no response to that—she was right. Malfoy was all he’d been able to think about for months, but that didn’t mean he was falling for him. How could he? It was
when his mother first suggested it, but now Draco couldn’t be happier that he’d agreed to do it. He’d hopefully prevented another child going down the route he took, showing Teddy the best of both worlds and protecting him from all the prejudice and hate that had warped Draco’s childhood. And on top of that he’d somehow ended up finding something he’d never anticipated having, with Harry of all people. It was better than Draco could ever have dreamed, and he couldn’t stop the hope that swelled in his chest or the smile that spread across his face as he pictured a future full of adventures with Harry and Teddy.
‘Good,’ Draco says, knowing that the topic is far from forgotten about but relieved to have the initial discovery over with.
‘Good morning, Mr—Mr Potter,’ she said, her voice shaking slightly. ‘I’m Grace Barnett, a Trainee Healer here at St Mungo’s. Healer Malfoy is in charge of my training. He’s asked me to help him with your case.’
And with that, Harry took a deep breath and closed the distance between them, his hands coming to cup Draco’s face as he kissed him. Draco froze for a second, and Harry was about to pull away, convinced he had completely misread everything, made a terrible mistake, but then Draco was moving, his arms wrapping around Harry’s waist as he began to kiss Harry back. A groan escaped Harry as Draco’s mouth opened, the kiss deepening and leaving Harry’s head spinning with desire.
Draco didn’t respond immediately, returning to tucking in chairs and wiping the tables, trying to decide what he wanted to tell Harry.
Potter starts to finger Draco properly, opening him up, and soon Draco is begging for more. He wants Potter inside him, wants to know what Potter’s cock feels like. Potter doesn’t give in to Draco’s pleas straight away though, continuing to torment him with his talented fingers.
Harry had been there, of course, at his trial. But they had never talked about it, and Draco didn’t feel like he could yet, especially not with Teddy there. To Draco’s great relief, Harry took the reins of the conversation, sparing him from trying to talk around the lump that had formed in his throat. He half-listened to Harry explaining the wizarding justice system to Teddy, trying to pay attention to what Harry was saying so that he could expand on it further during a future lesson. But with every word Harry said about the process of charging someone with a crime and putting them on trial for it, Draco couldn’t stop the flashbacks to his own post war experience. He knew he’d done terrible, terrible things, things he probably couldn’t ever make up for, but with the new perspective on his childhood that he’d gained from teaching Teddy, his heart ached for the misguided child who had been brainwashed into believing he was doing the right thing.
. It was hard, watching young Draco hanging off every word that his father spoke, soaking up the prejudice that had seemed so acceptable at the time. Draco wanted to reach through the memory and grab himself, tell him that this was all wrong, that he shouldn’t listen, that he didn’t have to live like this.
The match below him faded into irrelevance as the Snitch twitched its wings and took off away from Harry. Harry bent even further forward, his thighs straining from the stretch, his broom trembling under his fingers as he pushed it to ever greater speeds. The Snitch was dancing through the air, darting this way and that, letting Harry get tantalisingly close before speeding off again. The chase, these moments where victory was so close that Harry could almost taste it, was Harry’s favourite part of Quidditch. He loved it when his focus narrowed to nothing but the distance between the Snitch and his outstretched fingertips, exhilaration flooding his body.
idea, at least?’ Harry said, raising an eyebrow in an attempt to goad Malfoy into dropping his professional façade and give Harry more information. The latest dose of Skele-Gro was beginning to take effect, his battered nerves starting to awaken with pain once again, and he hoped Malfoy would rise to the challenge and not leave him alone with nothing but his aching body for company.
‘I know why you’re here, Potter.’ Draco shifts, pushing up off the window frame, stepping closer to Potter. ‘You’re here to see me. To fuck me.’
The movement seemed to shock Malfoy out of his trance, and his eyes shot back up to meet Harry’s gaze, before darting away again. His cheeks flushed a deep red, and he took an automatic step backwards, away from Harry.
‘Well this whore doesn’t want your guilt money,’ Draco says, whirling round to face Potter properly. He’s momentarily grateful for the few inches of height he has on Potter, even if Potter is far broader than he is. It makes them feel equal, just for a moment.
, Potter slips his fingers out of Draco. Even though Draco wants nothing more than for Potter to fuck him properly, the momentary loss of sensation still has him crying out in dissatisfaction. But then Potter’s magic fills the room again, and the blunt head of Potter’s cock presses up against Draco’s hole. Potter doesn’t push in fully straight away, instead teasing Draco until he can’t take it anymore.
‘I’m very good at taking,’ Draco says, turning to wink at Potter. Potter’s cheeks are already pink, his hair dishevelled, his glasses tossed away who knows where, but at Draco’s insinuation the flush deepens.
‘That’s all you needed to say,’ Draco crows, before they both lapse into silence. It’s a comfortable silence, not like after the last time they did this, and Draco starts to drift, not quite asleep but not quite awake either.
‘Indeed, excellent answer,’ Malfoy said. ‘For anyone else that would be exactly what we’d offer to help them drift off despite the pain from the Skele-Gro.’
Draco was spared from his increasingly maudlin thoughts by Harry’s drink being ready, and he passed it over to Harry, suddenly very keen to get him out of his cafe right now. Luckily Harry seemed to be in no mood to linger, and as soon as he had received his drink, he was heading out of the shop, with only a cursory thanks to Draco. Draco stood behind the counter, watching Harry as he left the shop, and only once he was sure Harry had well and truly gone did he let his guard drop, stumbling backwards until he reached the back counter, leaning on it to take the weight off his suddenly shaky legs.
The light spilling from the gap under the closed kitchen door was his first clue, and when he hesitantly opened the door, wand at the ready just in case, the expression he saw on Ginny’s face when he spotted her made it immediately clear. Something was wrong.
Harry had been so distracted by Malfoy in teaching mode that he’d entirely forgotten why he was here, and his stomach sank at the reminder he’d have to take more Skele-Gro and deal with the pain that was sure to follow. But if he didn’t, he wouldn’t be able to fly again any time soon, and he distracted himself with thoughts of Quidditch as he choked down another smoking beaker. By the time Harry had finished spluttering and had downed half a pint of water in a futile attempt to take away the taste of the Skele-Gro, Malfoy and Grace were by the door, clearly ready to leave.
Draco spent the rest of the afternoon answering Teddy’s questions about Hogwarts, deciding that he’d said enough about pure-blood culture for one day. He didn’t want to lay it on too thick, and he wanted to leave time for his message to sink in. They had plenty more lessons left to cover everything else, after all. By the time Andromeda came in to tell Teddy it was tea time, Draco was exhausted, the incessant chatter and enthusiasm of his cousin more tiring than he’d anticipated, not to mention the reminders of his own chequered history. He returned home completely drained, sinking onto his sofa with great relief, but there was a little kernel of warmth lodged in his heart as he reminded himself that he was on his way to stopping the next generation of the family making the same mistakes he had.
Shivers run down his spine as Draco plays with his hair, and even though his eyes are shut, he can picture just what it looks like, Draco’s pale fingers contrasting with Harry’s dark curls. Harry’s had a thing for Draco’s hands since before he can remember -- they’re always so elegant, whether they’re chopping potions ingredients or playing the piano that’s taken up residence in their dining room, and they never fail to make Harry feel incredible. He especially loves it when Draco plays with his hair, either washing it for him or stroking it until Harry falls asleep.
‘Thank you for doing this, Draco,’ Andromeda said as she gestured to him to make himself comfortable. ‘I understand that perhaps you didn’t quite want to do this, and I must admit I’m not convinced myself that it’s the best idea but, well, Narcissa insisted, and you know how she can get, so I’m willing to try it.’
He spent the day alternating between pacing around Grimmauld Place, roaming the many rooms and floors of the house, and lying on the sofa, nerves coiling in his stomach as he wondered what everyone was saying about them. He wondered if he was a topic of gossip in the office, if his coworkers were asking how they didn’t know earlier, if they were picking over his behaviour to spot the warning signs that this was on the way. Wondered if Malfoy was listening. Wondered what he might be thinking. Wondered if he would do anything, now that he knew Harry was single.
‘Stop, Malfoy,’ Harry gasped, pulling back as Malfoy looked up at him, confused, his lips swollen, the hand on his prick stilling. ‘Was going to come,’ Harry added in explanation.
Harry’s head was aching, his body so sore that even the weight of the sheet over him hurt, and his mind was reeling from seeing Malfoy again after so many years. He’d been telling the truth when he told Malfoy he didn’t trust him—how could he, after what Malfoy had done while they were at school? But Malfoy had seemed to know what he was talking about, and Harry was in no position to refuse help, especially from someone who was reportedly skilled at working with Quidditch players. He knew he could have pushed further—if he complained enough St Mungo’s would surely let him have a different Healer—but he hated using his fame in that way, and besides, he simply didn’t have the energy. His conversation with Malfoy had sapped him of any strength he'd had when he woke up, and the events of the day were catching up with him. A bone-deep weariness was overtaking him, and as the first prickles of the Skele-Gro started working their way through his system, he closed his eyes and drifted off into a dreamless sleep.
The words flowed out of Harry as soon as he put quill to parchment, too fast for him to censor his thoughts or talk himself out of baring his heart.
Anticipation building pleasantly in his stomach, a swirl of excitement, nerves, and desire, Draco followed Harry into the house, both of them coming to a stop in the hallway. Harry turned to face Draco, and the look on his face, uncertainty mixed with undeniable need, robbed Draco of any ability to take this slow. He backed Harry up against the wall, delighting at the way Harry hurried to go along with it, and then he kissed him, deep and passionate, letting out all the longing that had been building in him all day, all week. Harry melted into the kiss, opening his mouth with a groan, and Draco was gone, all restraint vanishing as he pressed his body against Harry’s pushing his hips forwards so Harry could feel how badly he wanted this.
The moment Malfoy’s foot crossed the threshold, Harry’s body exploded in pain. He dropped to the ground, hands clutching at his head as it felt like it would split in two from the pain. For a moment he thought the jewellery box had opened again, as screams echoed around the room, amplifying the agony in his head, but then he realised that the screams were his, ripped from his throat by the force of the pain.
Harry’s cock leapt at the sight of the arse he’d been dreaming about for so long, and his heart thumped wildly in his chest as the momentousness of what they were about to do made itself known. His mouth was dry with nerves as he stepped closer to Malfoy, running one hand over the exposed curve of Malfoy’s arse, hoping he wouldn’t be able to feel how much Harry was trembling. Malfoy’s skin was soft under Harry’s fingers, goosebumps appearing from the cool evening air, and he shivered slightly when Harry’s fingers brushed the edge of his crease. Noticing the reaction, Harry did it again, and again, his fingers dipping further in each time, until Malfoy was pressing back, chasing the sensation. When Harry tentatively reached out and petted Malfoy’s hole with the tip of one finger, Malfoy moaned, and the sound gave Harry the confidence he needed to cast a wandless lube charm and slowly slide his finger into Malfoy.
‘You knew what it was,’ Harry couldn’t resist shooting back, even as he thought to himself that right now, on his knees with swollen lips, Malfoy looked like he certainly knew a lot about sex at least.
dedicated,’ Esther said with a chuckle. ‘He’s been putting in rather a lot of overtime since you turned up, what with your nighttime walks and long conversations that mean he has to stay late to get the rest of his work done.’
‘Oh, has he? I hope he’s not causing too much trouble,’ Draco said, treading carefully, waiting for the trap. He had a feeling he knew why his mother had brought this up, and it had his stomach sinking with dread.
It’s cosy, in the hotel room, and Draco doesn’t want to leave. He only comes here to see clients, holds no special love for the room, and yet when he’s here with Potter, it takes on a new significance. Usually he goes home straight after his clients leave, keen to get back to his own flat and life, but when he sees Potter, he lingers. He lies in the bed, basking in the warmth their bodies have left on the sheets. He showers in the marbled ensuite, remembering the time they’d fucked in here, laughing as they kept slipping against each other’s soapy skin. The room’s become their little hideaway, a secret spot where they can both drop the weight of the expectations they carry, where they can give themselves over to pleasure and idle conversation. It feels more like home than Draco’s flat does, and he can almost pretend that it’s real.
Harry gulped and nodded, confirming that he knew what Malfoy was referring to. Even thinking about it had a sick feeling curdling in his stomach, but he forced himself to swallow down the guilt and speak.
Harry shook his head, too shocked that Malfoy was bringing up something even tangentially connected to the incident to speak.
When he heard her opening the front door, he took a deep breath, steeling himself, and went to meet her, bracing himself to throw away the life he’d wanted for so long for a man he wasn’t even sure loved him back.
‘I’m not sure. I went out to send my Patronus, and then you—you screamed, and then I saw you on the floor.’ Harry realised with a jolt that Malfoy looked terrified, his eyes wide with shock and fear. ‘None of the usual spells did anything, and Merlin, you wouldn’t stop screaming. I was going to Apparate us to St Mungo’s, but as soon as I touched you, you stopped screaming.’
His final stop before going back to his flat was the Manor. He knew Harry had been joking about the castle for marrying cousins, but that didn’t mean Harry didn’t have a point. There were certainly places that Draco could take Teddy where he would see pure-blood culture in real life, places that Draco had regularly visited as a child, and places where he could go and feel the magic bubbling up beneath his feet and understand the need to protect it that had driven pure-blood families for centuries. Somewhere in the Manor’s vast library Draco would be able to find a list of these locations. Hours later, armed with a stack of old books and his list from the internet, Draco finally apparated home, exhausted but excited by his new plan for him and Teddy.
‘I’m well aware of what the British public are like,’ Draco says, a hard edge creeping into his voice. ‘Why do you think I left?’
Suddenly in desperate need of a break, Harry mumbled an excuse to Evangeline and escaped to the toilets. They were blessedly empty, and Harry washed his hands, splashing his face with the cool water as he tried to get Malfoy out of his head. He’d only had a couple of pints, but he must be drunker than he thought, to be standing in grotty pub toilets, his mind consumed with alternating images of Malfoy laughing and carefree, and Malfoy lost in the throes of passion, his hand on his dick and his mouth on Harry. If he was honest with himself, he had been having these thoughts regularly ever since the incident, but tonight, now that he’d seen Malfoy again properly, they were having even more of an effect than normal, and Harry couldn’t deal with that.
They appeared on a hillside. In the distance the sea could just be seen, beyond the rolling patchwork hills. In the other direction a small hamlet was just visible, the smoke from chimneys floating up into the clear sky. Draco was pleased that the weather had held out—the views here were far better when the sky was cloudless, and he always felt like the magic was freer too, more playful, not held down by oppressive clouds or rain. He let Harry and Teddy take in the landscape for a moment, not saying anything, a small smile spreading across his face when Harry didn’t let go of his hand even though any practical reasons for needing to hold it were long over.
And now Potter’s standing right in front of him, apparently willing to pay for sex. Draco doesn’t think he can pass up this opportunity to live one of his fantasies.
‘He’s probably desperate to get to Hogwarts,’ Draco said, thinking back to that painfully slow final year at home, when all he had wanted was to be off having adventures at Hogwarts rather than stuck at home with his parents and his tutors.
The end of the film took Draco by surprise, too wrapped up in thoughts of Harry and his hands to notice the credits begin to roll. He hadn't taken in a single frame of the film. He couldn’t have even begun to describe what it had been about. Harry seemed equally taken aback, as Teddy had to poke him in the side to make him realise it was time to leave. With a small smile and a rueful glance at Draco, Harry let go of his hand and got up, following Teddy out of the cinema. Draco brought up the rear in a daze, his hand still tingling with awareness and the ghost of Harry's touch.
‘Merlin, no, I’m not willingly signing myself up for that kind of humiliation,’ Malfoy said, his eyes bright as he looked at Harry. Standing as close as they were, the few inches Malfoy had on Harry were more obvious, and the light, fresh smell of Malfoy’s cologne blocked out the chemical clean smell of the hospital. ‘You’d fly rings around me.’
In need of a break, Harry muttered an excuse about going to the bar for more drinks, leaving Draco with the Head Unspeakable, the two of them starting a complex discussion on magical theory before Harry was even out of earshot. Harry had no idea how Draco did it, this endless small talk with boring Ministry officials. Even half an hour of it had Harry wanting to tear his hair out with boredom - how many times could they discuss the latest internal policy change?! He lingered at the bar long after his pint was poured, slowly sipping at the drink while looking around the room. Everyone was dressed to the nines, some even employing the latest spells to cause their dresses to sparkle as though real fairies were floating around them, but despite all the people around him, his eyes kept returning to Draco. Harry was gone, so gone.
Harry pushed through the crowds of people, not turning back to see if Draco was following him, exiting the ballroom and walking up the ornate staircase in the entrance hall. After trying a few doors, Harry found one that swung open, letting him in to a small sitting room, tastefully decorated and slightly less formal than the rest of the house, three vintage looking sofas arranged around a glass coffee table. Harry walked over to the large windows that overlooked the grounds, listening to the sound of Draco’s footsteps following him into the room.
Harry hated to admit it, but Malfoy made a good point—the quicker he got this over with the quicker he could be free of Malfoy and back on his broom. He sighed, reaching out with his good arm for the beaker, wincing at the pain that flared in his ribs at his movement. The potion tasted disgusting, and Harry had to fight to stop himself immediately spitting it out. His eyes watered as his throat burned, but he swallowed down the whole beaker and sank back into the pillows, grimacing at the taste that lingered on his tongue.
Malfoy settled himself in the chair next to Harry, and they both sat in silence for a moment, Harry panting slightly from the exertion. The curtains were open to the night, the moon hanging in the cloudless sky, more stars visible than usual. Malfoy had come to see Harry in the morning as always, bringing him his Skele-Gro dose, but he’d been pulled away to deal with an emergency before he could assess the progress of Harry’s hip, throwing a promise to come back later over his shoulder as he dashed out of the door. It had been well after dinner by the time he returned, and Malfoy had said they could wait until the following day to try walking, but Harry hadn’t wanted to wait any longer than he had to.
‘Any thoughts on colour?’ Millie continued, her voice becoming more businesslike as she slipped into work mode.
‘I— I don’t want to talk about it—,’ Potter stutters, the control and certainty that he’d shown last time gone.
Her voice gradually got stronger as she spoke, and when Harry nodded in response, any last traces of nerves on her face vanished, replaced by a tentative smile. Harry couldn’t resist glancing over at Malfoy, who was watching Grace closely, a look that could almost be described as pride on his face.
Malfoy was wearing a white shirt again, the top buttons undone to give Harry a tantalising glimpse of his chest, and that was just too much for Harry to take. Blood was pounding through his veins, a dangerous mix of anger and arousal, and Harry rounded on Malfoy, backing him up until his body was pressed against the wall. There was no trace of fear on Malfoy’s face though, instead a wicked smile and a look in his eyes that suggested he knew exactly what Harry was about to do.
Harry shifted next to Draco, his arm brushing along Draco’s, his hand moving, his fingers nudging Draco’s. Draco’s heart was pounding, so loud he wondered if Harry would be able to hear it even over the noise of the film, worried that he would give away his reaction to the way Harry’s fingers were lightly brushing the back of his hand. It almost seemed as though Harry was doing it deliberately—surely he couldn’t have been lingering so long by accident? Just the thought had Draco feeling like he might faint, all his awareness focused on to his hand and the gentle feeling of Harry’s fingers on his skin. He was starting to think that Harry was definitely doing it on purpose; even though Harry still had his eyes fixed firmly on the film they seemed unfocused, and the corner of his mouth had quirked up in a slight smile that set excitement racing through Draco’s veins. Draco sat stock still as Harry explored the back of his hand, unable to move from shock and nerves as Harry’s fingers moved to Draco’s palm, gently nudging his hand until it sat facing upwards. Harry’s fingers ran along his heartline, his lifeline, tracing up the length of each of his fingers in turn, and Draco thought he might die. He’d never thought that he could feel so much from such a gentle touch, and yet it was somehow the most sensual, romantic thing that he’d ever experienced.
‘I’m surprised Farrell sent you, I thought he’d sworn never to let us take the same job.’ Malfoy was leaning against the wall next to the open front door, his long legs crossed in front of him, his robes open to reveal a crisp shirt and smart trousers.
‘I thought I knew what the curse was, so tried to remove it. I didn’t think it would have that reaction.’
‘Where did you go?’ Harry was desperately curious. He wanted to know everything that had led Malfoy to become the man sat in front of him, such a contrast from the boy he’d been.
Harry was tired. He was exhausted from a week of non-stop work, and beyond weary of constantly policing his thoughts in case they strayed too close to Malfoy and having to deal with the guilt when they inevitably did. He was tired, and he had no strength to fight his desires anymore. When Malfoy swayed forward slightly, Harry was powerless to do anything but meet him halfway, a groan escaping from him when their lips met. It was everything he’d been dreaming of for the past week, and all his pent-up desire raced through him like an inferno as he pulled Malfoy flush up against him.
‘Turn around,’ Draco murmured, pulling off Harry’s cock and dropping kisses on the sharp jut of Harry’s hipbone. Harry could hear the edge of lust in Draco’s voice, despite the sound of the water raining down on them. Powerless to resist, Harry did as Draco said, turning around and planting his hands on the cool wall. He groaned as Draco’s hands cupped his arse, then gasped as they pulled his cheeks apart and a tongue swept from his balls up his crease. The touch was gentle, teasing rather than forceful, but it still sent a powerful pang of need through Harry, and he shamelessly tilted his arse back in a wordless plea for more. He closed his eyes as Draco began to lick over and over Harry’s hole, his nerve endings alight with pleasure. It was all too much, the sensation of the water coursing over his skin and Draco’s wicked tongue combining to drive Harry higher and higher, and all too soon he was teetering on the edge.
When the water ran cold, Harry finally dragged himself out of the shower and downstairs. He felt sick at the prospect of trying to chat to Ginny while pretending that his whole world wasn’t shaking on its foundations, and hated the rush of relief he felt when he entered the kitchen to discover that she had given up waiting for him to get out of the shower and eaten without him. The sounds of a Quidditch match on the Wireless drifted into the kitchen from the living room, and Harry knew he should take his plate in there, should join her on the sofa and listen to the match, discussing tactics and slagging off the players as they always did. But he thought that bit of normality might finish him off where the curse had failed to.
Harry had been staring blankly at the stack of paperwork which had built up while he was off work, when the sound of his name jolted him out of his reverie.
Turning round, Harry saw Millicent Bulstrode, clad in a deep green suit, a smile on her face as she watched Harry take in the shop. Harry felt some of the tension drain out of him at the sight of her, the tight muscles in his shoulders loosening and the butterflies in his stomach floating away. He’d known that Millie had set up as a tailor after the war - Draco often talked proudly about her work, and Ginny and Luna had both had dresses made by her, and Harry couldn’t believe he hadn’t put together that Millie was the tailor they were going to. Draco would never go to anyone else.
‘The more we talk to people, the more likely it is that we’ll be found out,’ he said, the exasperation in his voice making it clear that Harry really should have thought of this already.
Harry nodded when Hermione looked over at him. ‘He did say he was the best with these kinds of injuries. And he treated Turner when she had that fall a few seasons ago.’
‘I can’t,’ Malfoy said yet again, and he turned on his heel and fled before Harry could say anything more, extinguishing any flicker of hope that Harry had left.
Malfoy laid his arm flat on Harry’s bed, his fingers nearly brushing against Harry’s thigh before he curled them into a loose fist. He bent his hand towards his inner wrist, held it there briefly, then returned his hand to its original position.
‘You’re a good player, from what I hear,’ Malfoy said, and Harry wondered where Malfoy had heard that. Had he been following Harry’s career?
‘Did you think I wouldn’t notice you acting strange? Avoiding me, avoiding kissing, touching me? Do you think I’m stupid, Harry?’
As they prepared to Apparate to the day’s destination, Draco planning on Side-Alonging Teddy and Harry again, Harry took Draco’s hand smoothly, easily, as naturally as breathing. Draco melted at how easy it felt, how much it made sense to once again be in contact with Harry, like a weight he hadn’t known he was carrying was lifted off him. It took all his energy to drag his focus away from the warmth of Harry’s hand and back to the task he was supposed to be concentrating on. It wouldn’t do to misjudge this Apparition because he was too distracted by a man holding his hand. Andromeda wouldn’t accept that as a reasonable excuse if, Merlin forbid, something happened to Teddy. Centering himself, bringing all his awareness inward, Draco pictured where he wanted to go, the magic building in him before they span into nowhere, Harry’s hand still tightly grasped in his.
It’s brilliant, again, and Draco’s dazed brain has just enough energy to think that so far, Potter’s more than lived up to his fantasies. Typical of Potter, really, to be good at sex as well as everything else.
‘Oh,’ Harry replied as he trailed behind Malfoy. He and Malfoy might be on better terms now, but he was still wary of Parkinson. ‘Sounds fun,’ he added, scepticism bleeding into his tone despite his best efforts to sound sincere.
They sit like that for long minutes, Pansy’s top growing damp with tears as Draco lets himself go. Most people never see this side of Pansy, but Draco can’t think of anyone he’d rather be with right now—she’s always known how to comfort him, take care of him. Slytherins have always had a reputation for being self-serving, for being ruthless and cold, but that has never been Draco’s experience. At Hogwarts they’d formed a little family, looking after each other when their parents were too distracted with chasing power and the rest of the world had written them off.
‘Fuck!’ Harry swore loudly as he used his arms to push himself off his hospital bed and onto his feet. His legs were wobbly from lack of use, and his hip protested as he put weight through it for the first time since his accident.
Winter was here in earnest now, the sky darkening even as Draco served the last of the lunchtime rush, his customer numbers dwindling as the weather got bitingly cold and people began to hibernate in their homes and offices, subsisting on poor coffee rather than venture out into the cold. The weather never seemed to put Harry off though. He still turned up several times a week, wrapped up tightly in a surprisingly fashionable coat and scarf, the feeling of the edges of his warming charm making Draco’s skin tingle. Draco was torn between wishing Muggles were able to cast warming charms so that they too would keep coming to his cafe - winter was always a harder time for the cafe with far less passing trade - and grateful that the lack of customers meant his conversations with Harry went uninterrupted.
‘Well, I’m glad you did become a Healer,’ Harry said eventually. ‘Even if that’s just me being selfish because you’re going to get me flying sooner,’ he added with a grin.
At the noise, Malfoy looked up, his eyes locking on Harry’s, and for a moment Harry let himself look, let himself take in all the details of Malfoy with his lips wrapped around Harry’s hard cock, before a wave of guilt overtook him and he had to screw his eyes shut. He shouldn’t be looking, shouldn’t be enjoying seeing Malfoy on his knees, his cheeks flushed and his eyes wide as he licked teasingly at Harry’s cock. He should be enduring this because he has to, to stay alive. He should be trying to block out Malfoy with thoughts of Ginny, he should be wishing the blond hair clenched in his fist was red. The sight of Malfoy doing this to him shouldn’t already be seared on his brain.
Sometimes Teddy seemed interested in the lessons, particularly when it came to the more recent aspects of pure-blood history such as the war which had deprived him of his parents. But when Draco began to talk about old customs and traditions Teddy visibly glazed over, becoming fidgety and uncooperative. Draco understood, truly; he’d never enjoyed these lessons, but he was worried Teddy wasn’t taking in the important messages about tolerance and the need to change traditions to reflect the way the world was now because he was already bored by the time Draco began to talk about them. Draco knew he needed a change of tactic, but he had no idea what to do.
But then Potter leans in, and any thoughts Draco had of delaying this vanish. Potter’s close enough that Draco can feel his breath ghosting across his lips, can see the very faint smattering of freckles on the bridge of his nose. His eyes are flicking between Draco’s eyes and his lips, and Draco knows Potter is about to kiss him. For a brief moment he contemplates letting him, thinks about giving in to his desire to know how Potter’s lips would feel against his. But he can’t. It’s his one rule, and he can’t break it for anyone, not even Potter.
Malfoy looked slightly taken aback by Harry’s agreement, his eyes widening a fraction and his eyebrows raising, but he quickly got his face back under control.
They’d come to a halt in the kitchen, and Malfoy turned to face Harry, ignoring his comment. ‘I’ve made a start on the initial detection spells, as you can see.’
‘I was so much worse than a pain in the arse! But I will concede that I wasn’t quite as effective in my terrorising as I used to wish I was. Merlin, I was an awful child.’
While he waited, Harry leant on the wall, watching the door, the way his jumper snagged on the rough brick reminding him of all the things they’d done out here. There was something they hadn’t tried yet, though, and Harry had been increasingly consumed by thoughts of it over the past few weeks. He’d even gone so far as to visit a sex shop in Muggle London, under the cover of the invisibility cloak, to pick up a magazine, surreptitiously dropping the money onto the counter when the shopkeeper’s back was turned before sneaking out behind another customer. The photos in the magazine had been very instructional, despite the fact that they didn’t move—visiting a wizarding shop was far too risky, considering how interested the wizarding press still were in Harry, even all these years after the war—and had left Harry with a burning curiosity to know what fucking a man felt like in reality. He was hard just thinking about it, and he couldn’t resist rubbing his erection through his jeans as he waited for Malfoy to join him. Tonight was the night.
He nearly comes as he slides into Draco, the tight heat so overwhelming that he has to close his eyes and concentrate on not ending everything here and now. He breathes, slowly, evenly, trying to tamp down the blaze of pleasure threatening to overtake him.
‘You always gave me a run for my money at school,’ Harry said. ‘You might now, too.’ The idea that had come to him so suddenly was now lodged in his mind, and he wanted nothing more than to play Quidditch against Malfoy again. He wanted to watch him move gracefully through the sky in that way that had always captivated Harry, long before he knew the words to explain that kind of fascination.
‘I’d grown up hearing about how important it was for me to marry, to find a nice pure-blood witch and settle down, and although it was never explicitly discussed, I knew my father wouldn’t approve of me being with a man. So when Astoria and I grew close, it just seemed… sensible.’
When even that got dull, Harry got desperate and reached for another one of the books Hermione had brought him. He felt a tiny pang of guilt as he picked up a book on the progression of werewolf rights and flipped it open to see a note in Hermione’s neat writing that reminded him that she had given it to him for his birthday and he hadn’t so much as opened it since unwrapping it. But now he was trapped in a hospital room with nothing else to do, and he was determined to at least read some of it.
‘It’ll be ready in a moment, if you wouldn’t mind waiting over there,’ Draco said once Harry had paid, customer service voice firmly back in place as he gestured to the end of the counter. Harry went where Draco indicated, and Draco busied himself with making Harry’s drink, muttering to himself to just hold it together for a tiny bit longer, then he could fall apart as much as he needed to.
The rest of the office had beaten Harry there, and had bagsied their favourite corner of the pub, pushing tables together and borrowing chairs until they all had seats. Harry spotted Malfoy straight away, sat on the far side of the tables, chatting animatedly to Robertson, and his stomach flipped over at the sight. Blaming it on nerves, and resolutely ignoring the flash of remembered pleasure, Harry made a beeline towards the bar, buying himself two pints. He wasn’t usually a big drinker, especially not at work events, but he had a feeling he’d need it tonight.
‘Be careful, Ron!’ Hermione admonished. ‘We’ll leave you to rest now, if you’ve got everything you need?’ Harry nodded. ‘Let us know if you need anything else at all, and we’ll come and see you again soon.’
‘I have to go, Potter. Alert us if the pain gets significantly worse. I’ll be back in the morning for your next dose.’ Professional, distant Malfoy was back, and before Harry could do anything more than nod, he was gone, the door closing behind him, leaving Harry alone in the semi-darkness again. The panic didn’t return, though, replaced instead by thoughts of Malfoy and the small glimpse Harry had got of his smile.
‘Oh, hi, Draco,’ Harry said, looking over to where Draco was hovering in the doorway, before letting out a loud groan as Teddy jumped onto his stomach.
Teddy continued talking, with Draco nodding distractedly and making vaguely interested noises, his eyes locked on Harry the whole time. He hadn’t realised until he set eyes on him exactly how much he’d missed the sight of that stupid hair, and those broad shoulders, and that smile that made Draco’s stomach flip when it was directed at him. But now Harry was sat in front of him, smiling at him in that way that made Draco’s heart ache, crunching his toast and eating baked beans, his gaze never leaving Draco’s, and all Draco wanted to do was reach out and touch him, kiss him, press him up against the wall or the door or any flat surface he could find and pick up where they had left off the week before.
‘What are you doing?’ Harry whispered, confused after being jolted from his contemplation of the feel of Draco’s knuckles.
‘I don’t really know why I came back here,’ Potter starts, and Draco prepares to be offended, but before he can say anything, Potter continues.
‘He’s a bit excitable today, just to warn you.’ Andromeda chuckled. ‘Harry took him out this morning, and he had far too much sugar.’
‘Yeah, me too, Ginny will be…’ Harry trailed off as a wave of guilt washed over him. Ginny would be at home, waiting for him, ready to spend a nice evening together with no idea that her husband had just had sex with another man. Harry felt like he might be sick.
‘I don’t know, just, like, take him out into the world and talk to him about Muggles with them actually there, stuff like that. Or show him places that are important to pure-blood history—you guys must have some old castle somewhere that is the site of the decision to only marry your cousins or something.’
‘Maybe,’ Draco chuckled, heaving himself out of the soft cushions and going into the back room to retrieve his firewhiskey and two glasses.
Draco sighed when they fell on Harry’s soft bed, their bodies aligning, pressing against each other in the most delicious way, sinking in to each other with every kiss, every touch. When Harry pressed inside Draco, the burst of pleasure that spread through him was nearly overwhelming, and it only increased with every movement Harry made. Draco’s magic, still so near the surface after their trip to the valley, seemed to reach out, sensing Harry’s, and as the two intertwined it sent shockwaves of bliss through Draco, Harry moaning into his mouth as he felt it too. Their magic cocooned them, wrapping them in layer upon layer of sensation and pleasure as they moved together, Harry’s eyes never leaving Draco’s. Draco didn’t know whether it was Harry, the magic in the air, or the slow build up as they’d taken their time to get to this point, but he’d never felt anything so incredible, his climax overtaking him in a rush of white hot pleasure and crackling magic.
‘Of course,’ Draco said, reaching out and taking Harry’s hand, leading him down the stairs and out into the garden, the two of them walking side by side down the candle-lined path before vanishing into thin air, still hand-in-hand.
‘Must have been desperate,’ Harry said, walking up the cobbled path to join Malfoy outside the house. Their boss had sworn never to let them work the same job after a big fight early in their careers had resulted in a cursed necklace nearly blowing up a client’s house, but everyone else had been busy today, so he’d been forced to reconsider his policy. ‘Been here long?’
By the time Pansy has run out of stories of socialites and soirées, they’re both lying on the floor, the cushions from Draco’s sofa stuffed under their heads. The floor isn’t at all comfortable, the wood cold and hard against Draco’s back, but he’s too drunk to care. Too angry, as well.
It’s having a different effect today though; even though minutes earlier he’d been feeling sleepy. He’s getting hard, just from the sensation of Draco’s fingertips against his head, and Harry’s mind drifts to the other things Draco can do with those skilled hands. Harry would happily -- and indeed has -- let Draco spend hours just touching him, his fingers dancing over Harry’s sensitive skin before slowly, carefully opening him up. He’s come like that before, just from Draco’s fingers inside him.
, a mixture of comfort and practicality with each piece of furniture or decoration somehow coming together to make the room seem like somewhere Harry completely belonged. The mantelpiece and several of the shelves of the bookcase in one of the alcoves contained many photos, some showing Harry and Teddy, others of Harry and his friends, a few in pride of place containing worn old photos of people Draco assumed must be Harry’s parents. He was in the middle of browsing Harry’s books—they ranged from Muggle classics, to Quidditch autobiographies, to magical theory books that surely were a gift from Hermione—when Harry reentered the room.
But that will have to be saved for another day—and Merlin, Draco hopes that there’s another day. Today, his hands move to the button of Harry’s jeans, undoing it and unzipping his flies. As soon as they’re undone Harry is eagerly pushing his trousers down, revealing his toned thighs and a pair of straining black boxer shorts. Draco can’t resist dropping to his knees and kissing along the length of Harry’s cock, delighting in the noise that Harry makes. And then Draco is slipping his fingers under the waistband, needing to see Harry properly, without a scrap of fabric between them. Draco pulls off Harry’s boxers, and then he’s bare and all Draco can do is look, letting his eyes wander up and down Harry’s body, taking in every detail.
Draco sat quietly as dessert was served, deep in thought. He’d thought by refusing to teach Teddy that he’d spare him from learning about it at all, but if hiring a tutor was a possibility… maybe Draco wasn’t doing Teddy a favour after all. Who knew what the tutor would teach? Maybe they would truly believe in all the superiority stuff, they might even be an old Voldemort sympathiser. Worst of all, what if they said something horrible about werewolves? Teddy could come out of this even more poisoned than Draco had been. Draco couldn’t let that happen.
‘No, you just broke most of the bones in your body instead.’ Malfoy’s veneer of professionalism had vanished almost entirely, as though the dim light and the stillness of the night let him slip out of it and back into himself.
But despite his words, Malfoy didn’t immediately move. Instead, he met Harry’s gaze for the first time since he’d walked into the room. Malfoy’s words and tone might have been indifferent, but his eyes told a different story. They almost burned with intensity as he looked at Harry, and that small flame of hope that Harry had been holding close to his chest burst into a blistering fire. Malfoy’s cheeks gradually turned pink as Harry watched and his breathing appeared to quicken, his chest rising and falling rapidly. The atmosphere thickened between them, and Malfoy’s eyes flicked down to Harry’s lips, lingering there for a long moment. Desire built in Harry’s gut, and he swayed towards Malfoy, taking a step closer.
‘I was going to ask you that,’ Malfoy said, his words muffled. He was standing next to Harry, bent double, his hands on his knees, his back moving rapidly with his breath. ‘What did you do?’
‘But—,’ Potter starts, as though he’s going to argue, but then he deflates, swallows the words, relents. ‘Ok, fine, we won’t talk about it.’
One afternoon, Harry was surprised to see Oliver Wood’s face pop around his door. They passed a very entertaining few hours together discussing the matches that had been played while Harry was recuperating, and Oliver regaled Harry with stories from training. Harry laughed so much his newly healed ribs ached at Oliver’s rather dramatic reenactment of the team’s failed attempts at one of his new plays. It left him with a bone deep longing to be back with his team and to get back to training.
‘I dunno, cause we’re mates and so it won’t be weird, it’s better than finding a stranger to go with just to find out that they’re boring. Everyone will be paying attention to us so your ex will definitely notice, and if he’s as big a prick as he always seemed, then it will definitely bug him to see you with me of all people,’ Harry said, breathless by the end of his sentence.
As his teammates disappeared into the showers, nudging Oliver until he followed them with a reluctant look back at the trophy that he’d finally let go of, Harry sank down on the bench. He stretched his leg out in front of him, testing it, but when no pain came even after all the work he’d put it through today, he leant back against the wall, closing his eyes. Elation warred with exhaustion, as it always did after a win, and he was grateful for a moment of relative peace to try and begin to process it. The months of rehab after he’d left St Mungo’s had been worth it, however much he’d grumbled about it at the time. Every hour he’d spent stretching, every boring day he’d had to spend at home, every game he’d had to watch from the stands, had been worth it, as it let him be here for this moment.
Desperate to wipe that smile off Malfoy’s face, Harry moved in closer, pressing their bodies together, and kissed Malfoy, hard. There was no tenderness in the kiss, no romance or love, but instead just savage need, underpinned with the anger and frustration that had been bubbling in Harry ever since Malfoy had sucked him off and snuck under his skin. Malfoy kissed Harry back just as hard, his tongue slipping into Harry’s mouth and his hands sneaking into Harry’s hair, tightening just enough to make Harry’s nerves prickle with pain and pleasure. It was exactly what Harry had been craving since the last time he had felt Malfoy’s hands on him, and it was that thought which shocked him out of the trance Malfoy’s kiss had pulled him into.
‘Did you bring me some stuff?’ he asked, nodding his head at the small bag sat on the floor next to the armchairs.
Harry just laughed in response, and Draco couldn’t stop a smile sneaking on to his face. Making Harry laugh had set butterflies wild in his stomach, and he had a sudden inexplicable and incredibly out of character urge to start cracking jokes or pulling silly faces in an attempt to get Harry to laugh again. To avoid making a complete fool of himself, Draco hurriedly returned to cleaning up the cafe, getting everything in order so he could leave as soon as Harry had finished his drink. He already knew he would spend the evening driving himself crazy replaying the memory Harry laughing over and over, wishing he was in a position to make Harry laugh like that every day.
One evening, as they lie on the bed, the sheets in a heap on the ground and sweat drying on their skin, they even warily broach the subject of the war. They’ve skirted the topic multiple times—the war naturally encroaches on any discussion of their lives and shared history—but this time they don’t shy away. Draco listens, rapt, the setting sun making Potter’s skin glow golden, as Potter describes the loneliness of having the world’s hopes pinned on you, of being a scared child in a game controlled by adults. Of the grief that had followed the war, and the loneliness that had remained, even as the world celebrated his achievements.
Speed was always the downfall of curse-breakers—it was delicate, slow work, and cutting corners nearly always spelled disaster—but that hadn’t stopped Harry from rushing, skipping the final diagnostic charm on a jewellery box, sure that he already knew what curse it contained.
‘Of course,’ Draco said, his voice rougher than normal, and Harry gave him one more quick kiss before dashing out of the room to intercept Teddy. Of course he would wait. He would wait as long as Harry needed.
Afterwards, they lay sprawled across Harry’s bed, sweat drying on their skin, their gradually slowing breathing the only sound in the room. For the first time in a month, Harry’s brain had stopped spinning while he was lost in the feel of Malfoy’s body on his, but as the afterglow faded, Harry couldn’t stop his brain from whirring into action again.
As they moved together, their hands still clinging tightly on to each other as pleasure built in Harry’s gut, he realised the sexual desire he’d felt for Malfoy had changed, shifting into something far more unsettling. It had become something more, something that led to him dreaming about Malfoy for hours each day, paperwork pushed aside and long forgotten as he wondered what Malfoy was doing, where he was in the office, whether they might bump into each other, an anticipation and excitement that he’d not felt in a long time. When Malfoy moaned and clenched around him, ripping Harry’s orgasm out of him with a shout, Harry was overtaken by a rush of emotion that had him dropping his forehead onto Malfoy’s shoulder as he let it wash over him, a confusing mix of pleasure, guilt, happiness, and above all, a sudden realisation that he wanted to keep this newfound intimacy.
‘Oh.’ Harry didn’t quite know what to say. He might be grateful to Narcissa for helping him, but he couldn’t pretend that he didn’t think Lucius had got exactly what he deserved. ‘I’m sorry,’ he said finally, awkwardly patting Malfoy’s arm where it was hovering near Harry’s. He would have immediately regretted his clumsy gesture, were it not for the way Malfoy’s eyes shot down to where they were touching.
They floated down to the pitch as a group, still hugging and clapping each other on the back, giddy happiness on every face. Harry felt like he must surely be dreaming as the League President walked towards them with the trophy in his hands. Harry whooped and shouted with the rest of the team and the fans as Oliver, still crying, was handed the trophy, which he kissed and then raised high above his head. It was one of the best moments of Harry’s life, only made better when Oliver turned to him and passed him the trophy. It was heavy, solid metal, and hard to hold while still clinging tightly to the Snitch, but nonetheless Harry kissed it and stared at it for a moment, before passing it on to his teammate so that they could have a turn.
Draco lets Potter talk until he’s done, the words flowing out of him as if they’d been right on the surface, ready to burst out, for years. He has the feeling that this is the first time Potter has said some of these things out loud, and he wonders why he hasn’t felt able to share them before.
To Draco’s great surprise, he got his answer from Harry. Draco arrived promptly at Andromeda’s as always for Teddy’s fifth lesson, but was taken aback when he walked into the living room to find Teddy and Harry involved in a rather intense looking wrestling match.
Malfoy gave as good as Harry was giving, pressing Harry back against the rough brick wall, his hand in Harry’s hair and his hips grinding against Harry’s, leaving Harry in no doubt that Malfoy was as into this as Harry was. All the sensible parts of Harry’s brain switched off as he gave himself over to feeling, letting himself be swept away with the movements of Malfoy’s mouth and hips. Too soon, Harry was moaning into every kiss and pressing into Malfoy’s body, the feel of Malfoy’s erection against his own bringing him to the brink even through their clothes.
Malfoy popped in and out of Harry’s room as his work allowed. He accompanied Harry on some of his walks, his laughter echoing around the corridors of St Mungo’s as they talked. Harry wondered if Malfoy laughing like that was an uncommon sight—he’d noticed almost shocked expressions on some of the other Healers’ faces as they’d walked past them. The more time Harry spent with Malfoy, and the more he learned about him, the more he
‘Really? Already?’ Harry was surprised. Malfoy had said he was good, and that he’d get Harry back moving as soon as possible, but this was even faster than Harry had expected.
if the blowjob hadn’t been enough, hated the way his cock reacted as he contemplated what would be involved in that something else. His and Ginny’s sex life had faded recently, busy careers and the repetitive nature of married life taking their toll, and he tried to tell himself that the only reason Malfoy was having this effect on him was because he was missing having regular sex. He’d never been that good at lying to himself though, and attempting to was only making him feel worse.
The noise in the corridor suddenly kicked up a level, voices shouting and shoes squeaking on the linoleum floor. A flood of mediwizards and Healers barrelled down the corridor towards them, but even that couldn’t break the tension that was taut between them. Instead, Malfoy simply stepped in closer, crowding Harry up against the wall, his hands coming up to bracket Harry’s body. Harry’s breath caught as Malfoy’s chest pressed up against his, moving them out of the way of the people rushing past.
When they entered the courtroom, Draco didn’t say anything, a wave of confusing emotions overpowering him, a mix of sadness, loss, and extreme guilt. It felt at once like no time at all had passed since he had been standing there waiting to be judged for his crimes, and as though it was a thousand years ago. He felt so old, picturing his eighteen-year-old self facing the court. He tried to ignore the glances he noticed Harry shooting his way, refusing to look over in case he saw pity, or worse, on Harry’s face.
‘Oh, really? Try me,’ Ginny said, looking up at Harry again, her tone icy and her expression cold, but Harry could see the tears filling her eyes.
Draco’s always loved Paris, let it steal his heart and made it his home, but now everywhere he turns there is a reminder of everything he wants but can’t have, and it’s like he’s losing Paris too.
And Harry ran out of the pub, not caring that he’d left his coat behind, the sound of Malfoy calling his name as he left ringing in his ears, his lips still tingling from the feeling of Malfoy’s touch.
The lessons continued, Draco spending several hours of his Saturday afternoons round at Andromeda’s, working his way through his modified version of his mother’s list. Some of the items on there didn’t need changing much—Draco gave Teddy a very quick rundown of the types of robes one should wear to specific events (information that he knew Teddy would immediately forget, and who could blame him?) and of the traditional baby name choices available to pure-blood families, Teddy laughing at some of the ridiculous names that kept cropping up in the Black and Malfoy families.
As always, it was like Harry had been desperately thirsty all week and only now was he able to find relief, Malfoy’s lips against his slaking a need that had been burning in him since the last time they did this. In no time at all, they were grinding against each other, Malfoy’s erection hard against Harry’s as they kissed and groped at each other. The movement of his hips only served to remind Harry of how badly he wanted to fuck Malfoy, and he pulled away from their kiss with a gasp, stilling Malfoy’s movement with a firm hand on his hip. Malfoy looked at Harry, a puzzled expression on his face—once they’d started, they didn’t usually stop, for anything, too intent on chasing their orgasms.
“No, you need breakfast. I’m not letting you skip it. You didn’t eat much of the dinner last night,” Draco replied, dragging Harry down the stairs.
“Let’s go, then,” Draco said once they were both ready. He walked over to the door and held it open for Harry who was behind him. They walked down to the Great Hall in a comfortable silence. Walking in, Draco turned to Harry and said, “Want me to sit with you again?”
“Nonsense! You don’t have to apologize for that because you didn’t make me cry,” Hermione scolded, her hands on her hips like a disappointed mother speaking to her child though she had a soft, reassuring smile that made sure that Harry knew that she wasn’t at all.
He was 20 minutes early because Hermione said if he wasn’t she would drag him out of his house. As he walked towards the train he spotted a group of red hair. When he walked over Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ron all ran up to him and engulfed him in a bear hug.
“Damn, that’s a shame! This is fucking amazing. I wanna see you wearing what Frank n Furter is wearing!” Draco said, laughing ten times harder at the face Harry made.
Harry sighed and looked at Draco with sad eyes. “I had a nightmare,” He started in a whisper. “It happens almost every time I sleep. About the people that died. They all tell me that it’s my fault that they’re dead. That I should have died not them. When I wake up I usually end up getting a panic attack and pain helps me calm down that’s why I grabbed the knife, why I cut myself.” His voice kept getting quieter and quieter. Taking a deep breath he continued, now looking at this TV in front of them. “The pain helps ground me. I used to hate it but now it’s the one thing I control in my life. I didn’t want to be the Savior, y’know. I’d much rather be a normal person. Like the people in the background of movies. Not important. I’m not important. People only ‘care’ about me because I saved them. I only did the thing that I was told I had to do. I don’t think one thing I did was my own decision besides this,” He said moving his arm a bit.
Hermione gave Pansy a smirk as they watched Draco and Harry bicker. There definitely was something going on between them. There had to be.
“Harry, you’re here! I was just telling them if you weren’t here in the next 5 minutes I was going to apperate to your house and drag you out!” Hermione said.
“Really Harry, you need to stop running off. I’m not going to be here your entire life so that I can get things for you while you’re running around having fun. Someday I’ll be the Minister and I won’t be there to help you all the time,” She reprimanded.
‘No,’ he thought. ‘Not a panic attack. Not today.’ He knew the only thing that could help him was cutting. The pain calmed him down. He had grown so used to pain growing up with the Dursley’s he didn’t know how to cope without it. After years of Vernon and Dudley punching and kicking him he’d grown to love the pain.
The three stood there hugging for a few minutes before Hermione pulled back. “Let’s go eat, yeah? People might start to get ideas if we stand here hugging too long,” She whispered, wiping a few stray tears.
“He- Hey guys,” Harry said, pulling back and whipping his eyes. “I want to talk to you guys after dinner, later. About everything.”
“Potter, wake up. It’s just a dream,” He said, shaking him a bit more. “Harry, come on, wake up!” He started to shake him a little more aggressively. Soon he got Harry to wake up. He pulled the now awake and crying boy into a hug.
Harry’s face dropped and he pulled his legs into him. “What about it?” He asked in an emotionless voice.
“Oh- er- Maybe?” Hermione said bashfully. “I knew you wouldn’t come over here on your own and well -- I think that being with Draco is good for you so I thought that bringing you over to him would -- well--”
“It is odd,” Hermione said. “How can two people go from acting like they hate each other to acting like the other is the most important person in the world the next time they see each other? It just doesn’t work like that.”
Draco smiled down at the smaller boy and put his hand on his back, rubbing up and down in a soothing way. Harry unconsciously leaned into Draco as he went back to eating small bites of his food. This action didn’t go unnoticed by the two girls who were sitting at the table with them. The two of them smirked at each other, and Pansy nodded towards the door and Hermione nodded.
“U-um, the only thing that I know is what ‘Mione said the other day. That there are some creatures that have soulmates that they love unconditionally.” Harry mumbled.
Draco nodded before looking up at Hermione and the others (Ron, Pansy, Blasie) who were now standing behind her at the foot of the bed. “He has depression, I think. And that,” He said, referring to what had just happened in the bathroom. “Was a panic attack, if I’m not mistaken. On the train ride here Harry and I sat together in a compartment. I had started reading while he was sleeping. I ended up having to wake him up from a nightmare that had sent him into one. That was when I figured out something was wrong. I promised that I would help him get better though.”
“Do you want to go ask Hagrid if we could leave now? You guys are fine with that, right?” He said, looking at the 8th years that sat at the table. They all nodded in agreement so Draco took Harry’s hand and walked up to Hagrid. “Hey, do you mind showing the 8th years to the common room now? Most of us- the ones sitting at the Gryffindor table that is - are ready to go.”
Meanwhile with Draco, Pansy had been yelling bloody murder at the poor boy. “I can’t believe you! You just left! Telling me to get your things! Do you know how fucking heavy your school bag is? Honestly, it’s like you have bricks in there! I dragged that heavy ass thing to all our classes waiting for you to come back and relieve me but you never fucking showed up!” She continued ranting and yelling at Draco, causing Harry to feel bad. If he hadn’t dragged him out of the room he would’ve been spared the embarrassing lecture that drew the entire room's attention.
written large above a photo of them on their wedding day, smiling as they looked at each other. Everyone in the wizarding world would know by now. Harry tried not to think too much about who exactly that included, tried not to wonder what their reaction would be.
,’ Harry murmured as they pulled apart, resting his forehead on Draco’s for a moment as Draco tried to compose himself. ‘I’ll go sort Teddy out, get him into bed. Will you wait?’ Harry looked uncertain, for reasons Draco couldn’t understand.
The sound of several memos swooping in to the office momentarily broke Harry’s concentration, but when he saw that none bore the distinctive purple hue of notes from the magiforensics team, he looked back down at his file, cursing the other team’s slowness. How was he supposed to get anywhere on this case when they were taking their sweet time in analysing the explosion residue?
Ron came to see Harry before he could go and see him, appearing through the Floo one evening several weeks after he had moved into Grimmauld Place, nearly giving Harry a heart attack with his sudden arrival. Harry had been feeling guilty about avoiding Ron, had known he should have gone to see him straight away, but he had been afraid to. Ron had always been protective of Ginny, and still distrusted Malfoy, and Harry knew Ron wouldn’t have been happy to hear that Harry had cheated on his sister with a man he hated.
And then Potter is gone, and Draco is reminded that this isn’t their sanctuary at all. It’s the room where people pay him to fuck them, and that’s all Potter wants from him, nothing more.
‘It is wonderful,’ Harry agreed. ‘Thank you for bringing us here. I never knew it could feel quite like this.’
They spent the next half an hour dutifully chatting to various Ministry workers, sidestepping questions about their relationship as much as they possibly could. When pressed, Draco shocked Harry by coming up with an impressively detailed story about the origin of their relationship, featuring long nights at the office, lingering glances over pints in the pub, the euphoria of chasing down a criminal leading to a spur of the moment kiss. Draco made it sound so real, every detail so firmly rooted in their actual relationship, that for a minute even Harry was taken in. He could just picture that moment at the end of a fight with a suspect where the adrenaline and the relief is so high that he feels like he could take on the world, when even pressing your former enemy and work partner up against the wall and kissing them until you both fall apart doesn’t seem like the most insane idea in the world. His heart ached for wishing that Draco was telling the truth, and Draco reaching down to link their fingers as he recounted the story only made it worse.
“Harry James Potter! Where have you been? I was worried sick! You just ran out of class and disappeared for the rest of the day!” She said, hitting him in the back of the head with the 53 chapter book that she’d been reading. “You’re lucky that I love you enough to get your note. Next time though, I won’t be so kind.” She handed Harry a stack of well-written notes and turned around with a huff, to continue reading.
He got out of bed and grabbed his razor he told others he used for shaving and ran into the bathroom. He lifted his sleeve and cut himself over and over until he calmed down. 3 cuts. One of his better days thankfully.
Too soon had Hogwarts start to appear in the distance. Reluctantly, Draco shook Harry’s shoulder in an attempt to wake him. “Come on now, we are almost there, time to wake up Harry,” He whispered.
“Well, your choices are, let me help you get better and not have the Weasel and the Mudblood know or, I tell them and have them fuss over you,” The platinum-blonde smirked. He knew what Harry was going to choose.
After a few seconds of silence, Harry whispered, “Because I deserve it… I was supposed to die like the others but I didn’t. I let other people die. It’s my fault that they are dead. I’m supposed to be the one that died!” At this point, he started crying. Draco used a spell to draw the curtains on the windows and put up a silencing charm so that people passing by couldn’t hear them. “They all had so much going for them like Tonks and Remus! They had a kid! I let them die and now their sons an orphan! It should have been me!”
The three stood there, in the middle of the Great Hall, with most - if not all eyes on them, crying and holding on to each other. That moment Harry decided that he would tell them everything knowing that they wouldn’t judge him or be mad at him for what he did to himself.
