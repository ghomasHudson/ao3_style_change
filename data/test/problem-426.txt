Throughout the whole conversation Mr. Diggory was fairly hands-on with Mr. Malfoy, who didn’t seem to mind the contact at all, so we’re left wondering: are these two together?
He felt jealousy flare up in him as he watched the way Draco’s arm wrapped around her, his hand placed on the small of her waist.
Unfortunately both of them were completely unaware of the avid listener who had heard their ‘private’ conversation.
“NO IT’S NOT! IT’S NOT FINE! THAT FOUL REPORTER CAN’T JUST SAY THINGS LIKE THAT AND GET AWAY WITH IT! YOU ARE AN AMAZING PERSON AND I CARE ABOUT YOU A LOT SO I WON’T STAND FOR ANYONE INSULTING YOU AND DOUBTING YOUR INTENTIONS LIKE THAT!” Harry raged.
“You haven’t heard of this core as it hasn’t been used in thousands of years because of the magical fish’s rarity and the only person who was able to lure them took this secret to their grave to not impact them ecologically. The White Moon Fish Fin core is powerful and loyal and generally produces spells of particular force and elegance.
Draco felt his eyes start to water again as he finished the letter and tossed it into the fire in his dorm.
“It’s fine. But seriously: what are these?” he said as he speared a soft disk with his plate and cut out a tiny piece.
He frowned slightly and opened the window; the owl stuck out its leg and waited for Draco to take the letter attached to it.
Cedric, who had just turned seventeen, unfortunately was old enough to enter and decided it was a good idea. If he hadn’t known he was a Hufflepuff Draco would have though he belonged in Gryffindor.
“We know that the egg shrieks loudly when we open it so maybe I was thinking we need to cast some sort of spell to make it reveal its true content? Some sort of translating charm perhaps? Cedric asked. Draco thought for a moment and shook his head.
“It’s too bad your boyfriend didn’t let you drown, Malfoy, he would have done the world a great favor by letting you die” Nott said cruelly and watched him closely.
“And what if he says no? What if he doesn’t see me that way? What if he sees me more like a brother?” Harry said.
As she collapsed over him, he marveled in the feeling of her breasts pressed against him: firm yet soft and warm, her nipples hard.
“Okay. It’s going to be okay, Draco. It’s not uncommon to go back to your old habits after being used to them for so many years” she said but Draco simply shrugged.
“No I do not! It took Draco and I months to go on a vacation together. Months! And they went to Paris, the City of Love, in one week!” Harry interrupted.
Since he had received no patronuses, he assumed his fellow aurors had not found anything of interest either. As he walked down a corridor, he opened a door that was locked using a simple ‘Alohomora’ and went down some sets of stairs.
His ‘parents’ had informed Harry of their decision to take Draco in but hadn’t explained to him the reason why Draco couldn’t stay with his birth parents since they felt Draco himself should decide what to tell Harry and what not to.
Currently he and Harry were in the living room, studying Astronomy. Snoodle was on Draco’s chest as the blond laid on the couch, book in his left hand while the right stroked his bunny’s soft fur.
Mr. Malfoy attended this evening the International Medical Conference for Magical and Non-Magical Diseases in London, where the best healers from all over the world came to hear the Potions Expert’s lecture on this new branch of medicine.
As he was walking down a corridor he thought he heard someone behind him but when he turned he didn’t see anyone.
“Did she stick out her ass like the whore she is? Did she flash you her breasts from under her slutty shirt? Let me guess: she didn’t wear a bra, didn’t she? Wanted you to take her there and then... well guess what Draco? You’re mine. You’re mine and mine alone” Harry breathed into Draco’s ear, making him shiver. Where had all of this boldness come from?
“Perhaps you should do well to remember, Mr. Nott, Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle, that you are members of Slytherin house and as such you will conduct yourself accordingly” Draco turned his head and saw Professor Snape emerge from the shadows of the Dungeons; Nott and his two dogs immediately stopped laughing and paled at the sight of the intimidating teacher.
“So all we have to do is submerge the egg in water and listen? You’re a genius, Draco!” Cedric cried as he hugged him.
“Uhm, actually we just finished. I was heading back to Ravenclaw Tower. Elizabeth and I have been working tirelessly to plan that ball. I’m so tired I think I may faint!” Draco said slightly dramatically, trying to lighten up the mood.
“Yes... It was very nice of you, Severus: being bullied at school after being abused all your life at home isn’t the best of situations. To be fair he does take it all in his stride” Headmaster Dumbledore mused.
I’m sorry to say this, Harry, but I think Draco did the right thing in choosing his work over you. I mean, can you imagine Draco actually leaving all of the things he’s worked so hard for, all of his great achievements because you DEMANDED it? You should be ashamed of yourself! If you thought he’d choose you then you really don’t know him at all”
“If you want to, I think we should start with getting to know one another and establishing some sort of ‘relationship’ and then we can-”  Sev said but Draco interrupted him.
Even though blinding pain cursed though him, Cedric managed to take this chance and cast a ‘Reducto’ directly at its eyes, not only blinding it, but effectively killing it.
“I know you probably don’t want to hear this but as your friends we’re really worried about you, Dray...” Michael said as he cautiously approached Draco’s bed and sat down on it.
As he went on with his studies he noticed he did find it a bit easier to master healing spells rather than others. He hadn’t given that a lot of thought before because he knew his wand was apt to healing magic but now he knew it also came from him.
“I never believed it” she whispered and Draco turned to meet her gaze. Kate involuntarily shivered as a cold gush of wind passed around her.
“Draco, unfortunately I cannot make this decision for you. However, I can say that you still have quite a bit of time left before you have to decide, so I suggest you keep your possible occupations in mind but also focus on actually enjoying your last year here at Hogwarts” Sev said as he patted Draco on the head. Draco didn’t say anything but quietly agreed with him. Maybe it was time to make a little change...
I’m so sorry we didn’t get to say a proper goodbye and I feel so guilty, but I swear if I could’ve stayed by your side I would have.
Draco and Harry had a wonderful time at the Graduation Ball. Even though Draco was forced to formally attend with Elizabeth, Draco spent all of the night with his boyfriend and his friends.
“Hmm, yes I do. Whatever you decide you want to become, just make sure it’s something you like. I want to see you happy. You deserve it” Harry said as he took Draco in his arms and wrapped them in a tight embrace. Draco felt warmth not only around him but spreading from inside his body, in particular his heart.
“So why would you think he’d enjoy getting smacked in the face with some snow at four in the morning?” she asked him gently.
James quickly put a hand on his left shoulder and started walking closer to him, effectively shielding him from their looks, and glared at the two witches.
Unfortunately for the brunette, Draco had heard absolutely nothing during his prolonged sleep and didn’t remember anything since the Third Task.
“Woah Pansy, hang on a second! Tori and I have only jest reconnected! We’re not even sure if there’s something between us yet” he said as Astoria came to stand next to him.
He tried to speak but his vocal cords wouldn’t work so he simply nodded. His throat was really sore and he had a massive headache.
The two of them spent their remaining time together talking and studying, generally enjoying each other’s company.
“Oops...” Nott laughed “Will you look at that boys? Finally Malfoy is where he belongs: on the floor beneath my feet” Nott then added when he saw Draco couldn’t get up because of his jinxed legs.
“Yeah but what if she doesn’t like him!” he was rapidly gaining some color to his cheeks (again) as he ranted on about his beloved pet and of how little he had been seeing him lately with all that had been going on.
“Oh Merlin, Harry! Are you alright?” Harry looked up and all of his anger and frustration instantly disappeared as he looked into Draco’s worried grey eyes.
“Perhaps we can do this later. Let’s let him rest for a bit” she whispered and Blaise nodded in agreement.
“Harry, if you’re so sure he’s going to choose you, then why are you here instead of at home with him?” Ron asked after a few seconds.
The blond reached out and caressed his pet’s soft fur. Snoodle turned around and hopped over to Draco, snuggling into him like always.
First he added to water some chopped Bat Wings, Dandelion Roots and Cat Hair and stirred three times counterclockwise.
Witnesses say “they spent the entire night chatting, completely ignoring everyone and everything else. It was very sweet”.
“Oh no, of course not, I wasn’t suggesting that. I was thinking you could release the cure to Spattergroit you’ve been working on. It is finished, right?”
Fortunately Harry was too busy staring at Draco to notice the brunette girl sitting beside the blond.
“Yes, don’t worry. I promise you we’ll take very good care of him” Lily said as James nodded in agreement.
A little bump started moving under the covers until Snoodle emerged and cuddled next to him, providing support and emotional comfort. The bunny had been with Draco basically everyday while the blond ‘slept’.
They both slightly blushed when their fingers brushed together sending electric jolts through their bodies.
“In Hufflepuff you could show kindness to people and your studies and hard work would pay off. In Ravenclaw your intelligence would thrive and you could demonstrate your wit. In Slytherin you may find yourself a bit more different than others but with those sly and cunning folk your ambition to prove yourself and your manipulation skills would be at their very best” the Hat said.
“They are quite disorganized. Dean and Seamus tell me I should check out Harry’s bed in Gryffindor Tower if I ever want to see a ‘proper mess’ as they called it” he said as he waved his wand and a set of socks levitated into their apposite drawer.
“Hey! How are you feeling? Have you taken your medication?” he asked him as he put down some papers.
“To Draco!” Blaise toasted, raising his champagne glass and clinking it with his and Pansy’s glasses.
“I’ve always had a soft spot for rabbits and hares, you know, and I happen to think your friend here is quite adorable” Professor Dumbledore said as Draco magically packed up his things and followed the teacher through some corridors.
I also wanted to thank you: you were the best boyfriend I could ever have hoped for. You’re kind, funny, sweet, witty and smart! Any girl would be lucky to have you and I’m honored you picked me out of all the possible girls (or boys ;), we both know what I mean).
Under the article there was a picture of Draco irradiating happiness while delivering his speech for the world to hear.
“Good. Imagine there was a nice plate with golden brown toast and melted butter in front of you. Would you like to eat it?”
“Well, why don’t you ask the lovely Hermione? You haven’t already agreed to go with someone have you?” Draco directed this last question to the brunette.
“I will not tolerate bullying. If you wish to behave like a group of eight year olds then you can go do that at another school. If I ever see or even hear about you bullying another student you can kiss your positions in Slytherin AND Hogwarts goodbye. Am I clear?” Professor Snape threatened.
He didn’t know what to do so he just stayed in his room and played with his ball on the floor: he threw it low in the air and caught it in his other hand.
That night when he returned home to his own happy son and wife he couldn’t help but wonder what sort of life that poor boy had had until now.
Getting worried about his friend’s health he glanced down and saw the blond was tied by his ankle to the floor. He took out his wand and cut the kelp, freeing Draco.
“My mother told me one of her friends had an eating disorder when they were young and her friend didn’t tell anyone about her disorder” Kate said while looking at the floor.
“I love you both, but in very different ways” he explained as the bunny on the bed simply stared at him.
“Snoodle” Draco said. He knew Harry wanted to ask why he chose such a particular name however he refrained from voicing out loud his question.
Draco’s been my friend for a very long time and I’d hate to see him unhappy, so if you waste this opportunity he is so graciously giving you I will hunt you down and destroy you. My friend is a good man and he deserves to be treated well” she said.
“Uhm... I think so?” he said. He hadn’t been the one who chose it so he didn’t know. Anyway, he didn’t see how it really mattered.
“Harry, honey, Draco is going through a very draining process right now. Do you remember what Draco’s parents did?” Lily asked as she sat down on the sofa next to her son.
I’m sorry it ended the way it did but I just wanted to say I’ll always have a place for you in my heart and I won’t forget the time we had together.
“Do you really think I’m brave?” he asked shyly. Out of all the adjectives he could be described with ‘brave’ wasn’t one of them.
“These are called ‘pancakes’; they’re really good especially when covered in maple syrup or soft butter” Harry said.
He was surprised at how perfect it felt as their fingers entwined. Harry could feel the Malfoy signet ring as he pulled Draco a bit closer to him, enough to smell the cologne Draco used.
“There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be prepared, Ron” Hermione said and further distracted the group from Draco and Kate, who she noticed had shared some sort of secretive and complicit glance.
“Well, he’s been taking some vitamins to help him and he’s been trying to stimulate his appetite by eating more frequent meals”
“That’s nice! Your english is very good” he said. It was true: she barely had any accent except for the pronunciation of the letters ‘s’ and ‘z’.
“I guess you’ll just have to find out what they took during the task then... let’s hope you find this object!” Draco said and Cedric nodded absentmindedly, still trying to think about what sort of object he would retrieve.
“Because. I am THE Head Girl! And besides, there’s a school rule that says so” she smirked at Harry, making sure only the brunette could see her.
Of course the Hufflepuff was too kind and often praised Draco, not only when they were with other people, but even in the letters they wrote each other. Cedric made sure to always thank him.
She too rarely left the Hospital Wing and preferred to be with her boyfriend, only she got to care for him publicly while he had to do it when he was sure no one was watching.
He could understand the stress: first the years of abuse, then the eating disorder, the Second Task and then going in a magical coma for a month. As if the poor thing hadn’t gone through enough.
‘I’ll never remember all of that...’ he thought as everyone sat down and Lavender (?) took the seat beside him and scooted over too close to him for comfort.
After he made sure the boy was breathing too, he quickly cast a patronus charm and instructed his stag to go and get help.
He still wrote to Kate at least once a month as he valued their friendship. He was happy they had agreed to remain friends after their ‘breakup’.
“I agree” Lily said. Since Draco didn’t have any friends, James worked in the morning and sometimes in the evening and she had chores to do around the house, Draco usually didn’t have that much company during the day except for his books. Perhaps a pet friend would do him good.
Immediately Draco’s grey eyes opened, he shifted onto his side and a lot of lake water spilled out of his mouth as he coughed and spluttered. Cedric was so horrified by the amount of water that came out from his lungs and mouth that he didn’t even register Viktor emerging form the lake with his own ‘object’: his best friend from Durmstrang.
“What would happen to the boy’s parents should they be guilty of abusing him? And most importantly, what would happen to the boy himself?” the healer asked as they started walking toward the room the boy was sleeping in.
“Don’t apologize, sweetie. It’s completely fine you’re not hungry” she said as they continued with their shopping mission in Diagon Alley.
“The Hogwarts champion is: Cedric Diggory” as everyone started clapping and congratulating his friend, Draco could only sigh and clap halfheartedly.
No one brought up what they had just discussed, figuring it should be Harry and Draco to actually tell them what was going on between them.
So he learnt various extensive healing spells: not only for him, but for anyone else who was around him that needed help. He had decided it was better if he actually knew the charms instead of relying on his ‘gift’ and on his wand.
He watched as Cedric entered the arena and started battling his dragon: a Swedish Short-Snout. Cedric conjured a cloud of smoke (like Draco has advised him to do) to distract and confuse the Dragon as he went for the Golden Egg. Fortunately his strategy worked and as the dragon experts calmed the beast down and got it back into his cage, Cedric celebrated. People were wildly cheering and Draco was clapping as well.
As they left Gringotts, Draco was quite conscious of the added weight on his right hand. He would prove them all he wasn’t like his father. He would prove he was worthy to call himself a Malfoy.
“As I’ve already explained: you’re not brothers! He is a foster child and that means he wasn’t adopted!” Hermione said not looking up from the book she was reading.
He had a quick meal with Kate, Anthony, Michael and Terry who were adamant enough about keeping the conversation away from anything related to the task and to Draco’s health. He really appreciated this.
As they were walking to a shop James had called “Potage’s Cauldron Shop” he noticed with the corner of his left eye a few well dressed middle aged women were staring at him and consequently making him feel uncomfortable. Was it because of his complexion? He knew white blond wasn’t a common hair color but that didn’t mean people could openly (and rudely) stare at him...
As she left his flat, he realized that for the first time in over a month he may actually stand a chance of getting Draco back.
He looked around pointlessly trying to ease his nerves and noticed the crowd had gone completely silent and the only noises that could he heard were the ones of Madam Pomfrey who talked as she worked on Draco and Cedric.
“Well that was...unexpected. Who would have thought: Harry’s gay” James said with a little laugh. Lily turned to her husband and gave him a death stare.
He was badly hurt when that bloody thing managed to injure through his front and back, scraping the flesh with its sharp pincers.
Draco looked up from his book and smiled, his  eyes lighting up. Harry’s heart sped up in his chest.
“If it makes you feel better, Harry, I don’t think Draco is interested in girls” Lavender said and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
“How did you find me?” he asked with a sniff as the other boy knelt beside him and took Snoodle in his lap.
“Look, Harry: if I asked Lavender out to the Yule Ball then you can do it as well” Ron encouraged him.
“I just asked Kate to the Yule Ball and she said yes!” Draco said happily and Harry actually felt his heart shatter in his chest.
“Hello, sorry to bother you but can you tell me what is this?” she said in a remarkably good english as she pointed to a platter filled with food.
Quietly Lily slipped away, found what she was looking for and had it wrapped in paper while she paid for it separately and returned to her husband and son.
He then summoned the Healing Potion he himself had made a few days prior as a Potions homework assignment.
“Who? Us? We were just... uhm... checking this-this DOOR!” Hermione said as she gestured wildly with his hands.
“Sir, forgive me, but where are you taking me? Am I in trouble?” Draco asked. He hadn’t been in this part of the castle before...
“No, thank you. I just came to ask for your permission to brew a potion that could help Cedric tomorrow, Sir” he said. Sev nodded.
“I’ve been eating one meal a day ever since I can remember. My parents weren’t very nice people...” he trailed off. Dr. Dirwin looked at Lily.
“We’ll go to Gringotts first, it’s the Wizarding bank” James said as they entered a tall building. Inside there was a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling, casting golden light on... little people?
“But the Black Lake will be freezing at this time of year! Also, how will I be able to breathe under water for an hour?” Cedric asked and Draco sighed.
“This will sting a bit and produce some smoke but only for a few seconds I promise” he said to the bunny as he let fall a few drops of potion on it and immediately the potion began doing its thing. The baby rabbit squealed so Draco quickly placed the tip of his wand to its leg and muttered the correct cleaning incantation. He noticed the tip of his wand got a red streak of color that then disappeared after a second or two.
“We can talk about this another time. When you’re ready. In the meantime, don’t worry: I won’t tell anyone” Harry said as he hugged Draco.
As they made their way to the bedroom, after making various stops down the hallway, he laid her down gently on the bed and began undressing her.
In the next few days Draco and Kate got to know each other better. Meanwhile Harry was busy trying to figure out a way to confess his feelings to Draco before it was too late.
He stood in front of the door and bit his lip nervously. He had returned to England a day earlier than planned because he had something very important that he needed to do before he told his family and friends he had returned.
“Unfortunately my son was tied up under water without so much as being given a choice. I know Draco and he wouldn’t have agreed to participate in such a dangerous task” James said.
The same couldn’t be said about Harry’s dancing which was a bit more stiff: Hermione’s poor toes had suffered a lot in one night.
Draco had tried to find out why Professor Snape helped him but hadn’t found anything useful. The man was pretty secretive and intimidating. The latter proved to be a very helpful trait because Nott, Crabbe and Goyle had stopped bullying him.
“Oh yeah, it’s a fairly recent development from just yesterday actually... Elizabeth found a school tradition that Head Students have their own dorms. So... uhm... I guess I’ll be moving in with her in a few days...” Draco blushed. He really didn’t see why it was necessary for him to be with her all the time as in the Head Dorms he would be all alone, separated from his friends.
As they left the candy store they stopped walking and Draco used this much needed break to breathe and rest a bit. He was already feeling quite tired and his joints ached.
“And you’ve been in here, alone, sitting on the floor and playing with a ball?” she asked him and he nodded.
Suddenly everything disappeared as he sat up in bed, panting. Looking to his right he saw Harry’s sleeping figure was laying next to him.
One night, four days after the Third Task, Harry snuck out from Gryffindor Tower with his Invisibility Cloak his dad had secretly given him just to check on Draco.
As the three made their way to the door, Harry glanced back to Kate, who was being held in his crush’s arms. The two shared an intimate smile and for the first time ever Harry truly felt heartbroken.
“I guess so... unfortunately he’s heterosexual and probably won’t notice me in a romantic way. We work great as friends but I don’t think he’ll ever see me as anything more” he said quietly.
“The poor boy...” James whispered. He had heard of people abusing children but never had he encountered a situation this bad before.
They talked all night, or rather, Harry talked all night while Draco quietly commented and listened. Dinner was a pleasant affair: Harry talked about his time at Hogwarts, James and Lily asked him lots of school related questions while Draco listened and only spoke when he was spoken to. He preferred to listen.
He did find it more tricky though to learn the defensive spells because he didn’t actually plan on ever using them if not in a situation of great need. Anyway, by the time the school year was almost over he had learnt basically every spell he could and practiced them during Easter break and every other free moment he could spare.
“Oh, uhm, actually the password is ‘Caput Draconis’... right? Well, anyway, it’s fine I’ll just wait out here” he said. The lady (he refused to call her ‘fat’) nodded and walked away from the portrait, probably to go find Hermione.
Kate had been happy as well when she heard what he did and showed how proud she was by giving him a long and passionate kiss which was only interrupted by the bell ringing, signifying it was time for Artimancy class.
Draco didn’t know how he had ended up here in the first place: the last thing he remembered was brewing Cedric’s potion and then nothing until now.
“At least let’s share some body heat” she said coyly and Draco had to stop himself from smirking. Instead he boldly wrapped his left arm around her waist and pulled her in to lean on him. She rested her head on his shoulder and exhaled loudly in content.
“It’s about Draco. He’s not talking, not eating, not even studying! He literally cried himself to sleep last night and we’re worried about him”
The Cure to the Spattergroit disease was officially released four days later and it made news all over the Wizarding World.
Walking into Draco and Astoria had been tough, as she hadn’t been expecting for the blond to be there as well.
As he made his way towards his international portkey he looked back one last time and waved to his family.
Harry/Draco couldn’t have one moment alone with his crush and frankly it was frustrating, seeing also as how close they had actually gotten to kissing the last time they were alone together.
When Draco woke up he felt a bit more rested but his head was still pounding and his whole body hurt.
After what happened, Elizabeth hadn’t been speaking to him; he didn’t know if out of spite or because she was shy, it didn’t matter to Draco. All that mattered was that he would be leaving Hogwarts and starting his life as a young adult.
One moment he was dancing on the floor after drinking alcohol of some sort and suddenly the next he was in bed with a total stranger, pounding him into the mattress.
A week had passed since his conversation with Ron and not a single word had come from Draco. No letters, no notes, no contact whatsoever.
“Then if you’re okay with this you can go with Hermione as friends” Draco said hopefully, trying to help Harry.
“I’m so proud of him, he’s been doing magic only for a month and is already able to heal a rabbit” James said “I think he should keep it, after all, he didn’t find a pet in Diagon Alley and seems to like this one” he then added when Draco started petting the bunny.
This was what she had always dreamed of! However she could’t shake the feeling that something felt off...
Part of him knew he had to talk to Harry eventually because they were living together but another didn’t want him to possibly get hurt again.
“So now you’re Harry Potter’s best friend? Playing house with the Potty family are we, boy!?” he said in anger.
“He performed a type of highly difficult healing magic. He transferred some of his own magical blood to Mr. Diggory, to keep him alive” Dumbledore muttered.
“I don’t really... uhm...have... anything to get... I mean...” he trailed off. He was still looking at his feet.
“Well, there would be a trial and then they would be condemned to a sentence in Azkaban. The boy would have to be placed with a foster family until he is of age” Chief Horkins explained.
A tall and bulky looking ministry man lifted Draco and started carrying him towards the castle. Professor Snape and Professor Dumbledore followed them.
As his friend started asking him questions that he would never answer, an intrusive thought crossed his mind.
Draco had grown a bit but his slender figure still remained small and fragile, perfect for Harry to encase with his own body and protect him from any harm.
So far he had made no progress in discovering what the egg’s shrieks meant but he wasn’t going to give up anytime soon.
After they visited the jewelry shop where a man (probably the owner) charmed Draco’s signet ring to fit him perfectly and to expand as he grew, it was time to acquire some clothes. As they entered Twilfitt and Tattings immediately a shop assistant asked if she could help them and overall she was very polite and didn’t ask any questions, which was perfect. One hour later Lily had him buy clothes he liked and fit him well: several sets of robes, comfy pajamas and normal clothes.
The young Malfoy was adopted only a year ago by James and Lily Potter, who took the boy in after Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy mysteriously disappeared.
“And... how do you feel about... this?” Sev asked him cautiously after a minute. Draco understood the man was quite embarrassed.
She glanced at Blaise, who was sitting next to Draco. He wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders as the blond leaned into the comfort and warmth that was the Italian man.
After her initial surprise, she hugged him back; when she heard him whisper “thank you” she had to hold back her tears of joy.
Since only a few drops were required for such a small wound and animal, he figured he would have to get an object that resembled its mother’s breast and hopefully he would drink.
As they watched their son cuddle with the bunny, they both decided it was best if they brought him to a magic specialist to check out his “gift”.
“Nott, I suggest you try aloe vera: it helps with burns” Draco said with as much confidence he could muster. Kate smiled proudly at him. She knew he could be quite passive and didn’t like to get involved with arguments.
Yes, he had been with Kate but come to think about it he had never been attracted to her sexually. He loved her personality but didn’t feel the actual need to do anything intimate with her. They held hands, cuddled and kissed but that was just about it.
“Exactly how that woman gets her information is a mystery to me. All I know is that she wrote it and all the school knows about it” Cedric said.
“Fine. I’m just worried about finding a date to the Yule Ball” he lied. Draco and the others nodded as well.
Spending the remaining time of the trip with Cedric, Draco’s mood slightly improved by the time the train arrived at King’s Cross station.
She had just been healed when they brought Draco and Cedric in the Hospital Wing and had been like a leech ever since.
A few minutes later Harry’s heart sped up in his chest as Draco walked towards them with a smile on his face.
Draco was really glad he had returned to Hogwarts so soon for two main reasons: first he could be around his friends and girlfriend again and second he was reunited with Snoodle.
As he crouched down he gasped: a baby bunny was caught in some vines and was stuck. It probably was making its situation worser by moving around and getting more tangled so he quickly started calming down the baby bunny.
“Cedric owes his life to this brave young man” Madam Pomfrey sighed as she finally patched up Cedric’s last two wounds.
“I studied privately” he answered without hesitation. This was what his parents had told him and Harry to say should anyone ask them about Draco’s education prior to Hogwarts.
“Oh yes dear boy, you could be quite manipulative if you really wished to and haven’t even realized yet. If you wish to dabble in this subtle art, do not worry: even manipulation can be used to achieve good, as long as the heart his pure” the Hat said.
Apparently the Slytherin cock-blocker knew that as well and made sure she kept Draco busy all day every day.
“It’s fine, really, I don’t want you to be cold. It’s just my uniform isn’t really fit for your Scottish weather” she attempted to joke but Draco wasn’t having it.
“It actually makes a lot of sense” she piped up  and Draco gave her a small smile. The first she had ever seen. Her heart swelled in her chest.
When he found an empty compartment he settled in it and pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around himself.
“This is your family vault: legally, since your parents are in prison, you are the owner of the Malfoys and Blacks’ wealth” James said. Suddenly there was a ‘popping’ sound and a large bag filled with galleons appeared from thin air and emptied itself in the pile of gold and then disappeared.
“Yes. I’ll be here with Snoodle” he said as he patted his bunny’s head. Snoodle made a little sound of protest, he had been snoozing after all.
“Perhaps...” he said and went to the very back of his store. He came back with an ancient looking box that was all dusty and took out from it a white wand that was very thin and simple looking yet elegant.
As Harry and his friends started to talk Draco went back to his book as Snoodle snoozed on his shoulder.
“Perfect! Then you release it and when it makes the papers you can show Potter just how important your work is, Draco. You can show him exactly what he’s so carelessly thrown away” Blaise smirked and clapped for himself.
“I don’t feel like doing anything else... look at them! Slow dancing, arms wrapped around one another. One would think they’re a couple!” a jealous Harry said as he watched Draco pull the brunette closer to his body.
He didn’t mind: he often did that to Harry when he fell asleep on the sofa. What really scared him though was just how light his son really was. He could feel bones beneath his clothes...
“It says here that mere-people, beings with angelic voices in water actually sound like shrieks and wails in a loud, high-pitched whine when on land!” Draco said excitedly.
“Great! Then let’s go get it! The wards will only let you go in because of your blood. I’ll wait for you outside alright?”
“We were able to determine the boy was beaten quite regularly from the wounds he sported. Have you gotten hold of his parents?”
“Sorry to bother you but I wanted to speak with you. Do you have a moment? Alone possibly...?” Cedric said as Draco turned to face Kate.
“Welcome back everyone to another year at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As always the Forbidden Forest is forbidden to all students. This year’s Head Girl and Head Boy are: Elizabeth Swart and Draco Malfoy!”
“I can imagine. Are they boys in Ravenclaw Tower tidy?” she had heard Draco had made some friends in Ravenclaw as well and she couldn’t be prouder of her shy son.
He missed the tightening in Harry’s jaw and the pointed look his friends sent the boy as he greeted Kate with a warm smile.
“I’ll see you tomorrow alright? Bye!” Draco said and hurried up the last few stairs to Ravenclaw Tower.
It was even better when neither of the three Slytherins showed up for dinner and the rumors started flying around, saying Nott wouldn’t dare bully anyone anymore. Draco could only hope...
“Come on, Severus. Let’s go outside and let Poppy tend to Draco” Dumbledore said and gently pulled the Potions professor outside.
Since he was on painkillers basically all day and night, he felt fine and beside the occasional tug at his stitches, his whole ordeal didn’t bother him that much anymore.
James also had suggested he bought some pillows so Draco had gotten some comfy and soft looking ones to place on his bed and chair.
Draco closed his eyes and for the first time ever he wished he was still in his father’s basement where at least he was safe from emotional pain.
James took his hand and stepped inside a fire place and threw out some powder and said clearly “Diagon Alley!”.
“Move aside! MOVE!” Cedric glanced up and saw Professor Snape make his way worriedly to his godson and try to shake him awake.
“Not in a million years. Even if you were the last man on earth with an eight inch manhood I would never ever have sex with you” Draco said finally.
“He-He can’t... He d-doesn’t-t l-like m-mme” Harry sobbed. Lily raised her head and looked at her husband, who simply shrugged.
“So, why are you so happy?” he asked. He had a dreadful feeling it had something to do with bloody Kate Aguillon (that was her surname).
“I don’t know yet... I’ll do some research on it. Don’t worry I’ll figure something out” Draco said.
“The poor thing... can’t even finish a little plate of food... those monsters got only half of what they deserved” James said.
Ignoring her husband’s obvious attempts at being a child (she did however have a fond look on her face), she turned back to her son and winked at him, earning herself another little (and rare) smile.
When the time came he had to leave for Hogwarts he couldn’t help but feel nervous. He and his family had went to Diagon Alley two weeks before and had acquired all of his and Harry’s school requirements.
As they apparated to the station Draco looked around with curious eyes: a black and red train was steaming on the rail while lots of people saw off their children with hugs and kisses and in some cases even tears.
“You’re allowed to criticize me, Harry... maybe just not every time I mention my work?” he said in a small voice, gracing Harry with a small smile. The dark-haired man nodded enthusiastically.
They had told them everything they had ever done to the boy (whose name was Draco, by the way, and he was thirteen) and by the end of their confession everyone was disgusted with them: impossible chores and tasks, beatings for no reason, starving him. You name it.
Making his decision, he slowly laid down next to Draco, being extra careful not to touch him in case he woke him up. He settled on the pillow and waited with his breath caught in his lungs.
As he got closer he gasped: his left arm (that was placed over the covers) was covered in blueish-greenish bruises. He hadn’t noticed them before. Injecting in his arm was a tube, probably for nutrition, and connected to his finger was a beeping machine that monitored his heart and blood pressure. He also had an oxygen mask on his mouth.
As Astoria’s hand began stroking him, Draco barely contained a moan, his own fingers wondering down her body and quickly finding what he had been looking for. As he heard her gasp beneath him, he smiled.
“Blaise, stop antagonizing him” Pansy glared as the Italian raised his hands in surrender, muttering something about favoritism.
“What does it mean? What is this mirror?” Draco asked as he turned away from the clearly magical object.
“To bed. It’s too early to be up” he said with a yawn. He wasn’t even cross anymore, he was just tired and wanted to sleep.
“I thing you’d make an excellent Healer, Draco. You’re not only kind and know compassion but you’re extremely talented. You have a gift in Healing magic and I think you should actually try doing something with it” Harry encouraged him. Draco blushed slightly.
“Yeah, I’ve been flirting with him since I’ve met him and he never even acknowledged me so I figured he must not be interested in girls” she said.
“Because they’re Slytherins!” Ron exclaimed. Again with ‘being Slytherins’... was that supposed to enlighten him?
He felt her lips slightly move against his so he decided to finally give her a sign he felt the same way about her. He sat up in bed while she placed a hand on his chest.
“I left a note with his meal and grooming preferences. Don’t give him too many dried apple slices as-”
When he was done they would give him his meal (he was allowed only one scarce meal a day that consisted in leftovers IF he performed well all his chores) and would lock him up in his cold cell down in the dungeons until his father came down to beat him and torture him.
“Then you can set your heart to peace and move on” Lavender said while turning a page of her Witch Weekly magazine.
He had already started to read some of the books they would be using in Third Year and to be fair he was quite impressed: they were clear and didn’t cut short on information about spells/potions.
Unfortunately both of them weren’t available for any comments regarding their relationship as I’m sure they were quite preoccupied with each other, if you know what I mean”
But now, even after receiving Muggle painkillers and a dose of two different headache-relieving potions he felt like someone was splitting his head in two with a saw or an axe while they pushed his eyes into their sockets.
The smell of blood was pungent in the air as he slowly dragged himself to the box of medical supplies that had been thrown his way and started healing himself as best as he could without his wand. He looked at his body and couldn’t help but see the differences: he looked quite paler and skinnier with bruises and blood staining him all over.
Draco had also talked to Sev about how he treated Gryffindors and his godfather had agreed to slowly stop bullying them in class just because of his past experiences.
“These are the most beautiful girls I’ve ever seen...” Dean muttered as he watched their guests with wide eye.
“The Black Lake. I read that lots of creatures live in it such as a giant squid, grindylows and merepeople!” Draco said.
Draco and Cedric trained and studied harder than ever before for the Third (and final) Triwizard Task.
“You’ll look after Snoodle for me right?” he asked. Draco had been heartbroken when he found out he couldn’t bring his pet along with him. He would terribly miss the little guy.
“Oh wow, really helpful, Blaise” Pansy snorted as she continued on comforting her best friend, combing her fingers through his blond locks.
Snoodle, who was sleeping as well, was cuddled against his neck and pillow; the pair looked adorable together. Harry kinda envied Draco for having such a cute pet.
She had to make absolutely sure that he didn’t see today’s paper; it was almost as if her life depended on it.
“You were taken ‘hostage’ as a ‘treasure’ for Cedric to find in the Second Task. Did you agree to participating?” Lily asked him.
“I can’t lose you, Draco. Every time I close my eyes I see you laying there wet, pale and unmoving and people asking if you’re dead and...” Harry trailed off trying to gesticulate with his hands.
“This is where you’ll get your first broomstick, Draco” he said as he placed his right hand on his upper back while he pointed at the shop with his left.
The tenth day he and his parents rode back to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express since his parents didn’t want him alone for such a long period of time.
Draco was immediately taken into a very delicate and long surgery and the pin was removed successfully.
He fumbled slightly with his hands as the woman in front of him checked his medical records and files.
“Everyone out!” Madam Pomfrey said in a loud voce when she got a more thorough look at her unconscious patient.
As he finished writing, he magically cleaned up the lab and left the potions classroom. He also cast a cushioning charm on the bottle so if he accidentally dropped it, it wouldn’t break.
“Uhh... toast... toast with butter... I think?” did that count as a dish? He didn’t really have a favorite food/dish but he did enjoy toast and blueberries.
“Oh God, I’m so sorry! I see I’ve arrived at a wrong time! You-You... uhh... yeah! I’m just going to leave this here and get out of your hair, alright? Okay sounds good. Bye!” she practically ran out of the apartment from the embarrassment at having caught Draco and Astoria during a private moment, as it was clear what they had been doing that involved being naked before Hermione’s arrival.
Immediately Harry sprang into action and Flooed over to his best friends’ house for an emergency “consult”.
“Wait! What do you mean ‘date’? I’m not dating Elizabeth! Also, ‘joke’? What joke?” he said quickly, desperate to get his crush to talk to him again.
Did this mean Harry had only been bluffing when he had told him of how he was his and how he wanted him? But that couldn’t be! Harry was his best friend! He wouldn’t do something like that... right?!
“That sounds good, thank you! By the way, I’m Kate!” she introduced herself as she placed some food onto her plate as well.
“Ah you’re a quiet one ay? Well it’s a good thing you weren’t placed with the Gryffindors because for them meals are like wars: you never know when you’re about to be hit by a flying piece of food until it’s hit you. Look for yourself” Michael said. He turned around to face the Gryffindor table and indeed he did see a lot of food flying around.
Merlin he had missed him. In the three days he had successfully managed to avoid him, he had been feeling miserable.
“I have a crush on Harry” he suddenly blurted out, interrupting her mid sentence. He covered his mouth with his hand and fought the urge to blush a deep crimson.
“If you want, I can go and beat him up for you, Darling. Show that Gryffindor idiot that you don’t mess with us Slytherins” Pansy suggested after a moment of silence, eliciting a small smile from Draco.
“The Durmstrang champion is: Viktor Krum” Dumbledore said as the Durmstrang students clapped and cheered.
He ran and ran as fast as he could, not even caring that he left his satchel there. Not caring that his legs felt like they could give out at any moment. Not caring that he couldn’t breathe.
The two teenagers both blushed red out of embarrassment and separated as Lily and James shared a knowing look. Meanwhile Harry felt like melting into the ground and disappearing.
“ALL STUDENTS PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR DORMITORIES. CURFEW IN FIVE MINUTES” a magical voice said, interrupting Draco.
Harry was shocked. No words could describe what he was feeling right now. Sadness? Anger? Confusion?
“Thank Merlin for your blond hair or I wouldn’t have recognized you. My son’s told me quite a lot about you, you know!” the man was slightly breathless, probably from rushing up the steps. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“I don’t know, Mate. I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you. Draco loves his job” the read-head said as he took a sip of beer.
‘Come on, Draco. You can do this’ he encouraged himself as he took a deep breath before stepping into the room.
“News and gossip travel fast here at Hogwarts”  she explained. Draco nodded and said he’d see her later. He didn’t want to keep Sev waiting.
It was Draco’s face, however, that really scared him: he seemed genuinely happy. His eyes sparkled with mirth as he made the woman laugh, judging by the way her shoulders shook slightly.
“Oh nothing, I actually just wanted to have you all to myself for a while” Harry smiled as he sat right next to Draco and took his hand.
As the food appeared on the tables the whispers started and random people (even from other schools) began coming up to him and expressing how sorry they felt for what happened and how they were glad he was alright now.
He had a bit of a limp and he was aching quite a bit in his side but he didn’t say anything, even as he struggled to walk as fast as Mrs. Potter (who was going at a normal pace). So he bit his lip and carried on, ignoring the pain he was feeling.
The MRI revealed something horrible: Draco had a pin lodged in his head that was hitting the central pain system, causing all the pain Draco was currently feeling.
“Sure thing! I’ll see you here tomorrow alright? Bye!” she interrupted him again before rushing off.
Harry cleared his throat as he was reminded he wasn’t supposed to be seeing Draco right now as he would be with that two-faced bitch.
The main themes of the room seemed to be the colors grey and black: the bedpost was black and the bed was covered in grey sheets; the desk was made out of black wood while the comfy chair was grey with black designs: the wardrobe was of the same material and color of the desk.
James was in the corner of the room and was looking anxious. Lily hadn’t accompanied them because she wasn’t feeling very well this morning and had a bit of an upset stomach.
In the next few weeks Draco got more used to his new life and got more comfortable with Lily and James. He had already started working on catching up with school and found he actually enjoyed a lot reading and studying all these charms, spells and potions. His favorite subjects were Potions and Astronomy. He also enjoyed Herbology.
Draco in the meantime had also chosen to get a dark grey comfy lounge chair that he would place next to the window so he could read.
Cedric had fallen asleep about half an hour earlier as it was six o’clock in the afternoon  and they had been researching in the library for hours.
He fumbled with his suit as his tie felt like a coarse rope was choking him. He had wanted to look his best.
The adults shooed the two teenagers to have some fun while they prepared dinner as it was already getting late.
For the next hour the healers worked tirelessly on the boy. Finally when they were finished Healer Montary (that was the name of the healer that was in charge of the boy) came out to tell them about his health condition.
Snape then crouched down and muttered an incantation. Draco watched in awe as the ink parted from his belongings and the glass inkwell repaired itself: soon his satchel and its contents were clean once more.
“Yes, well, we didn’t know for sure what type of perils he would find in there so we also considered the possibility of animals being used as obstacles. Anyway, better to be safe than sorry” Draco said.
He quietly got a chair and settled on it by the boy’s bed. This child deserved to have someone with him, especially now.
“But it’s not normal! He’s not normal!” Ron said without thinking. Immediately Draco’s eyes turned sad as he looked to the ground. Hermione swatted Ron in the shoulder.
“I should have been more clear... uhm... What is your favorite dish?” the therapist corrected herself.
“DRINK FIVE MINUTES BEFORE TASK. JUMP INTO WATER AND WAIT 5 SECONDS. FOR BREATHING-WARMTH-CLEAR SIGHT”
We are all proud of Mr. Malfoy’s achievement, especially following a hard break up with Harry Potter.
“But he shouldn’t have to! That’s the point, Albus. He should have had a happy childhood with loving parents and friends. Instead he was all alone in a small cell for years, barely fed and beaten regularly by his own father” Professor Snape said in anger.
‘Because! You’re meant to be with me!’ the voice screamed in his head. He ignored it; after all, he didn’t want to scare him away.
“Because... it’s ugly...” Draco said quietly. She was sure this time her husband was going to have a proper stroke as he was staring with his mouth open at Draco, who was now looking at the floor as if he’d just done something he shouldn’t have.
By the time his first year at Hogwarts at ended Draco could say he was happy: he had amazing friends, a great family and a loving godfather and his grades were high as well.
Even though he was out of breath and exhausted, he took the time to thoroughly kiss his girlfriend goodnight as the two of them feel asleep in each other’s arms.
It was only when the Beauxbaton students started settling down at the Ravenclaw table that Draco shook his head and quickly focused on what Dumbledore was saying: he was introducing their guests.
His healers said it would be a slow recovery and that it would take time for his magic to fully recover.
He also took note of where its eyes were positioned: on the very top of the head, surrounded by the shell.
“Mr. Potter, your son suffered a very rare magic outbreak from his magical core. This type of affliction isn’t maligne and won’t harm the boy himself or anyone else. Rather I’d say this ‘gift’, as you’ve called it, could result rather useful should he or anyone around him be injured” Healer Kum explained.
When it finished its dose Draco picked it up again and started stroking its fur slowly and scratching behind his ears.
The two started making their way to Ravenclaw Tower but stopped in the middle of a corridor when they saw Draco and Kate talking together at the end of it. Unfortunately they couldn’t hear what they were saying.
“Didn’t you hear him, Ronald!? Of course he didn’t: he isn’t talking!” Hermione chastised the red-head as she explained the events of yesterday evening.
‘What do I name you?’ he thought. His first thought had been something like ‘Shadow’ or ‘Nero’ because of its completely black fur however as he watched it he decided those weren’t names that suited him.
Since it was June, the weather had gotten a lot warmer and he could be outside with Snoodle and Kate while they studied for his final exams.
“How dare she! Oh how I would like to strangle that vile woman!” Harry was ranting in frustration. Skeeter’s implications about Draco hadn’t gone down well at all with him and he had been raving for twenty minutes about what he would like to do or say to her.
“Draco!” she squeaked “I wasn’t expecting to see you here!” she said and looked at him closely, observing his particular attire, or lack of it in this case.
“Of course! Remember this Draco: you are a nice person who bad things happened to. Besides, it was Lavender’s fault that she got hurt. You tried to warn her but she didn’t listen to you” Cedric said.
As he pet it, he noticed his fingers were covered in some drops of blood that were coming from the bunny’s back right paw and leg, which had been scratched by the vines.
He was a little bit hungry at the moment so he quietly served some stew in a bowl and on his plate a little Cornish Pastie with some mashed potatoes on the side.
After that Harry was sure that at least Draco could feel something for him and that meant he could have a chance with the blond.
“Draco did a very thorough job with healing his external and internal wounds: I’m very impressed. But it’s what he did lastly that saved Mr. Diggory”
“It wasn’t your fault. Don’t feel guilty about this, Cedric. By the way, thank you for saving me” he said. Cedric nodded but his face didn’t lose its sad look.
He contemplated telling Anthony, Terry and Michael but reconsidered. He was glad Ravenclaw and Gryffindor were now getting along but he knew the moment he told anyone about this his whole friend group would know and in approximately a few days the whole school.
“Oh, well, I-uhm....” he struggled to come up with an excuse that wasn’t “we had a sleepover last night”.
Draco nodded and slowly limped up to his room. A few minutes later for the first time he went to sleep warm and comfy in a soft bed.
As red sparks flew in the sky, James quickly entered the property and set out on checking the rooms for dark artifacts. After ten minutes he had only found one object that could he considered as a weapon: a tiny bottle of rat poison, which could harm even a human if ingested.
I miss you a lot and I think about you almost every day, wondering if you’re alright, if you’re mad at me for leaving you during such a moment.
Harry and Hermione approached him and it was only when they were standing directly in front of him that he noticed them.
He saw his pain potions had been left on his nightstand and in one gulp he downed them both: instantly he began to feel better.
After a while touching wasn’t enough for him anymore as he began making his way down her body, kissing and licking, giving extra attention to her beasts and hard nipples.
He took his fighting stance and before attacking he remembered what Draco had said while they were training: “Remember: before you attack study your adversary, look for his weaknesses; don’t jump in a duel head first but analyze him and find out what his deal is”
“But why?! You love our chess games!” Ron protested loudly as they sat at the Ravenclaw table. Harry sat down at the table right next to Draco. He had been late to lunch because he had spent too much time after class with Flitwick discussing his test results.
“C’mon, dear. I’ll apparate us. The house’s name is Godric’s Hollow” James said as he took Draco’s hand while Lily held onto his arm.
Draco still hadn’t woken up. Cedric at least had showed signs that he was waking up lately but Harry didn’t care.
Slowly she rose to meet his face and he pulled her in for another kiss. This one was more intense as both of them had been expecting it: they nibbled at each other’s lips as they surrendered to passion. A few minutes later they both broke away and smiled at each other. The kiss had ended up in a very intimate position with Kate straddling Draco.
“I know sweetie, but if you’re really meant to be together then it’ll happen” Lily smiled at her son.
Step by step he wondered all over London and soon his feet brought him to one of his favorite night clubs.
However he did make them swear on their Gryffindor honor they wouldn’t try to do anything because it would only make it worser for him.
As he was feeling particularly blue, he had a quick dinner and went to bed early with Snoodle already sleeping against his chest.
Draco got for James one of the latest models of broom servicing kits which included a shiny wood polish that apparently did something incredible to your broom.
“I don’t know... his parents’ trial is tomorrow and I’m sure they will be found guilty, so they will be spending some time in Azkaban. As for Draco, he will be placed with a foster family until he is seventeen...” James said with a frown on his face.
Harry watched as the blond’s pale features immediately reddened and his eyes widened as he realized how intimately they were laying together.
“Please, don’t let him go there. Make him-” he sobbed. He did feel a bit childish: sobbing into his mother’s arms at the age of fourteen, crying for her to help Draco when the situation wasn’t in her control at all.
They spent a few moments simply staring at each other in silence, both not wanting for the night to end.
Hermione in fact had already been approached by Viktor Krum but between her unhappy best friend and some boy she would without hesitation choose Harry.
What if by putting on this ring he would become like his father? What if by wearing it he was justifying everything his parents had done to him? Would his father even want him to have it? After all he hadn’t given it to him before... Was he even worthy of being called a Malfoy?
In the end he was glad he had told someone about Sev because he felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from his chest. He still had to find out a way to inform his other friends but that could wait... for now...
“I’m happy and excited. I like spending time with him: he’s so nice and sweet, he’s so good with Snoodle and he’s soooo cute when he’s shy” Harry gushed without even realizing what he was saying.
“Maybe he was just tired of Nott’s bullying?” he said. It was a pitiful excuse but it seemed to work with the Gryffindors.
“Harry you’re never going to get the chance to be with Draco if you keep on stalling” Hermione said.
Suddenly an overwhelming smell of food filled his senses and he literally had to cup his mouth and nose with his hand to stop himself from throwing up. At lest now he knew the potion had taken effect fully.
“Of course. I see nothing mentally wrong or unstable with this young man so the only thing we have to work on is getting his body used to eating more food than it has for the past thirteen years of his life. Habits are like a schedule that we have no control of: in this case Draco’s body has gotten so used to not receiving any food during the day that it’s decided to not make Draco suffer by uselessly stimulating his hunger” Dr. Dirwin explained.
“Ehm... kind of? I mean he’s... he’s...” Draco was slightly attracted to him and had to admit he was fairly good looking.
“I guess I could take a break for a while...” Draco muttered as he marked the page he was on and closed his Artimancy book.
“Well, he’s beaten the odds: he’s a good child in spite of everything he’s been through. I take it you’ve been looking out for him?” Professor Dumbledore asked.
“Oh please, Draco, you were the reason why I wasn’t maimed or burnt alive by that dragon today. Take a little credit for it!” Cedric said.
He had considered writing to Kate about this but he felt they weren’t close enough to discuss such a personal matter. Sure she was his friend and they had been together, but he had never told her about his life ‘before’ and had never intended to.
“Trouble in paradise?” he heard someone say as he turned his head and saw Kate smiling at him in pity.
Taking a deep breath he started walking making sure he made absolutely no noise in hope of not attracting too much attention on himself.
Draco just hoped all the drama was soon going to be forgotten so he could go back to being invisible again.
He smiled as he rose up in the air and started performing some tricks he knew to hopefully amuse and impress his crush.
“DRINK FIVE MINUTES BEFORE TASK. JUMP INTO WATER AND WAIT 5 SECONDS. FOR BREATHING-WARMTH-CLEAR SIGHT”
Draco heard some footsteps approaching the door so he quickly hid behind a suit of armor and listened as the conversation changed to school matters.
“Happy that because of me you nearly died? No thanks I’d rather be a loser and have you alive and well” Cedric said.
The news had spread quickly in the hospital and quite a few people had already came in to express their sadness for him, even if he wasn’t conscious yet. It was nice of them.
“‘Professor’ will do, Mr. Malfoy. I am Minerva McGonagall and I teach Transfiguration here at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I am also Gryffindor’s Head of House. Please, follow me” she said as she hurriedly went up some sets of stairs.
“Draco needs to take his medicine and this little fella needs to eat” she whispered as she entered and placed the potions and pills on the nightstand.
Draco and her had agreed to have coffee together to catch up after the medical conference;  soon coffee turned into lunch or dinner.
“Sure! I know it can be difficult to find your way around here. I kept on getting lost” he said. She smiled.
The Slytherin seemed to be a little taken aback by Draco’s indifference but that didn’t discourage him from insulting the blond. It just spurred him on and made him more determined to have the Ravenclaw running away with tears in his eyes once he was finished ‘talking’.
As he started eating he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder. Turning his head he saw it was the pretty girl from before. He hadn’t even noticed she had sat beside him at the very end of the Ravenclaw table. He smiled.
His eating disorder had finally been cured after his final appointment with Dr. Dirwin a few months ago. Now only one thing remained that needed to be dealt with.
“I was maybe thinking that if Draco’s up to it, later we could go to Diagon Alley and get the things he needs. It’s a week day so it’ll be less crowded”
For the remaining time of the meal they talked together and got to know one another unaware of the important conversation that was going on at the Gryffindor Table.
“Yes, his name’s Harry and he’s your age. Right now he’s at Hogwarts but he’ll be coming home for the Christmas Holidays!”
“Well, you’re always gushing about him and you keep on looking at him so we figured you were interested in him. It’s totally fine, by the way, that you like men” Ron said and the others nodded.
Evidently he would be forced up in the air by Harry, who seemed to enjoy the sport just as much as his father.
“Thank you! You’re such a gentleman!” she fawned over him. He smiled uncomfortably but otherwise remained silent.
“I’ll wear it” he said and slowly placed the ring on his right hand’s ring finger. It felt slightly loose on his small thin hand but it didn’t matter.
He didn’t exactly know why, but he didn’t want anyone to know about this possible relationship without having discussed it with Astoria first.
First he felt a slightly tingling sensation in his fingertips and toes. That sensation spread to his whole body and he felt warmth in him almost as if a fire had been lit inside him.
A powdered scale of turtle shell was the last ingredient he added before turning the fire up a bit and letting the potion ‘cook’ for one hour.
“Harry, could you give Draco and I a moment alone please? I think we have quite a lot to talk about” Kate said and Harry looked at Draco before nodding and tightly smiling at the brunette. He gritted his teeth as he left the Hospital Wing.
“I know Draco loves you very much. And I also know he was devastated by your actions lately. Despite your attitude towards him, despite your absence and the distance there’s been between you lately, I know he still loves you. Perhaps he may still be a little unsure about his feelings for you, especially if you’re going to break his heart again” she glared at him, her blue eyes slightly menacing.
He had been the only person in St. Mungo’s who hadn’t been obliviated and knew of Draco’s abuse. James and Lily has asked this because they thought it was safer if someone at the hospital knew of Draco’s past and of his previous health conditions.
The image of his bloodied friend being carried in a stretcher, holding his wand tightly even if he was unconscious burned through his mind.
Harry also had been very proud of him, saying how he was so brave and could have been one of the best Gryffindors. Harry promised Draco he would make sure Nott stayed away from him in the future, but Draco managed to convince him not to; call him stupid but the Ravenclaw had a hunch Nott would think twice before insulting him so openly again.
He was horrified as he saw a picture of him and the guy kissing and groping each other in the night club.
“Please, bring your friend with you, he’s quite welcome” Professor Dumbledore chuckled and nodded towards Snoodle, who was slowly hopping around on the table and sniffing at Draco’s book.
“Hello, sorry, to disturb you but have you seen Draco?” Harry turned his head and saw bloody Kate smiling down at him.
He didn’t go outside his dorms that day and completely ignored the food his friends brought him. He didn’t even pick up a book or copy his friend’s notes.
It had been a gift from Snape for Christmas and Harry couldn’t help but thank the man as the scent was so... Draco. The subtle smell he had come to associate with the blond was of vanilla paired with something else... something only Draco smelled like. Unfortunately Harry had never been able to pinpoint what the scent was...
“You should be very proud of this one” Madam Pomfrey said as she waved her wand and the two limp bodies were lifted into some floating stretchers.
Harry’s head whipped towards her so quickly that surely he got some whiplash. His spirits lifting instantly.
“I know, sweetheart, but pranking him isn’t the way. For example he enjoyed himself when you two were playing chess by the fire. Try doing something you think he would actually enjoy and not something you and your friends are used to doing” she suggested. Harry instantly had a great idea.
As he descended his stairs dressed in his winter clothing, he found Harry, Lily and James were dressed for the cold weather as well.
Dumbledore’s welcoming speech did include news of the tournament and of the other two schools who would be competing.
‘Oh that boy’ she thought fondly as she went to the kitchen and filled up her magical watering can and started watering the various plants around the house.
Suddenly something hit him hard in the back of the head and the last thing he felt was a warm liquid running down his neck before everything went black.
“He is dangerously underweight, so he was probably barely fed before. He also had quite a lot older injuries that were never treated and many scars, some of them old enough to be form 8/9 years ago. As for the more recent injuries, he had quite a few external and internal cuts/bruises, he was bleeding a lot from some open wounds and had a few broken bones… It’s—it’s a miracle he is still alive. He did crash a few times while we were working on him but fortunately we were able to bring him back. We healed everything we could and left a few bruises to heal on their own. He’s currently sleeping” Healer Montary said grimly.
Another relatively good thing was that the pin was in the lower back of Draco’s head and it hadn’t been necessary to shave his whole head but only a little spot which was almost unnoticeable. He would have a little scar but it would be covered by his hair so it didn’t matter too much. He already had a few scars around his body so he didn’t much care if another one was added to his collection.
Draco raised his head and stifled a yawn. They had been working nonstop for hours as Headmaster Dumbledore had given them the permission to throw the ball on the last day of school and thought it would be a wonderful idea.
“Would you like to dance?” he asked while offering her his hand. His heart was beating quickly in his chest.
He still hadn’t healed his wounds and was quite in a bit of pain, although he had gotten used to struggling through it a long time ago.
He mustered all the courage he could and asked if they could have a word in private after class. Sev agreed to this with seemingly no emotion on his face but Draco, who had grown accustomed to reading people’s emotions, saw a little glimpse of doubt and curiosity in those black eyes.
He liked Cedric: he was nice and smart and knew how to uphold an intelligent conversation. Another plus to his name was that he adored Snoodle and always asked Draco if he could bring him to their study sessions. He of course agreed and that led to Cedric bringing Snoodle treats.
“You were found bleeding and unconscious in a cell in Malfoy Manor. You were brought here at St. Mungos and your parents were arrested for child abuse. They will be serving a lot of time in prison so you don’t have to worry about ever seeing them again” she said and waited for some sort of reaction.
He asked if they could visit the potions shop again and Harry fortunately agreed so they quickly walked there.
A few seconds later it sprang open as Harry launched himself to Draco and took the blond into his arms.
“Maybe, but I think we have a higher chance of understanding it if we first find out which language this is. I suggest we research on some population that sounds like high shrieks” Draco said. Cedric nodded.
“Of course I’m alright! Why wouldn’t I be? The love of my life hates me and is with somebody else and I’m here alone because I messed up so badly! Of course I’m not bloody fine, Hermione!” he said.
As he stopped he turned and saw a door that led to an empty classroom was ajar and a small stream of light was peeking through it.
“Impressive. You’re very good in Transfiguration” he praised and Kate blushed as she got closer to him and draped the blanket over their shoulders.
“It’s alright. Go rest for a bit. We don’t want you to strain yourself: you’re not used to this much activity and food, so we’ll take it slowly”
Auror James Potter quickly cast a ‘Tempus’ as he practically ran through the corridor that lead to the meeting room: fortunately he was just in time.
“You show him that you’ve changed, that you’re willing to compromise instead of dictating the rules. And Harry, make it as sincere as possible. You’re the one at fault here, so you can’t just go to him with a bratty attitude. Maybe give it a few days before you talk to him”
The last step was to add a pinch of dried Gillyweed to his potion and make sure it dissolved by stirring counterclockwise.
He would never let that happen! He would fight tooth and nail for the blond. He was definitely worth it.
Draco smiled for the first time in a while. It felt nice to have friends who actually cared about your well-being. As he bit into the fruit he became aware of his hunger and realized he was famished.
“Nah, I’m used to it. British weather and all that” he told a little white lie. The truth was he was used to the dampness and cold currents of air that were in his old cell but she didn’t have to know that.
Draco was smiling as he normally did while that Slytherin girl was looking at his Draco with a predatory look on her face. Draco, of course, didn’t notice this and simply went on as if nothing was wrong.
“I’m sure Draco will realize just how much you mean to him one day. After all, he hasn’t been around people for a long time, unlike you, and he’s probably not sure about his sexuality yet” Lily said.
“I just have some last few tests to run and if the potion passes then we can start mass production” Draco said while smiling proudly.
“You already are normal, Draco. You’re perfect just the way you are. You’re not fat or anything and I want you to know that. You literally are the skinniest boy in our year!” Kate said. Draco recognized what she was implying.
He got closer to him and touched his face with his palm: Draco was ice cold. His blond hair was floating around his head.
Suddenly James realized exactly what was wrong with the ring and mentally slapped himself for being so stupid.
On the way back the two basically had to run to the apparation point where Lily and James were already waiting for them.
“I’ll catch up with you later” James said as he said goodbye to his friend and as quietly as possible entered the boy’s room.
If she was surprised at all, she didn’t show it, as she immediately wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed back just as passionately.
(By then Draco was already beginning to feel a bit tired again. His limp had gotten a bit better after his nap so it wasn’t that obvious when he walked but still he wasn’t used to this much physical movements.)
‘Can’t even mind their own bloody business...’  he thought to himself as he opened a door and ran straight into someone... hard. This person luckily seemed to be able to steady themselves before they could fall but Harry, being angry and distracted, fell down on the floor like a sack of potatoes. He groaned loudly.
As he stumbled through the seemingly infinite paths of the maze he froze when he caught sight of a giant terrifying beast hidden in the partial shadows and foggy mist of the ‘road’.
“Uhh...” Draco backed away slowly and suddenly he felt his back coming into contact with a wall as Harry pushed against him, pinning him to the stones. If anyone were to see them like this they would certainly get the wrong idea.
“It’s fine” he said as he smiled at her. She beamed at him as well. They were still close and entangled in each other and one little movement forward would bring their lips together again.
Harry didn’t even want to think about the possibility of his Draco being with someone else other than him.
“Did you notice how Draco didn’t deny being gay? Maybe I do have a chance after all! Oh and when we get together it’s going to be so great! I already know what we’re going to do: taking long walks together because Draco loves being outside, cuddle by the fire after a long day, hold hands and rub our noses together and study together because Draco would be worried about my grades and would make me study” Harry said excitedly. His friends stared at him.
The bunny was still there, laying down on a scrunched up piece of cloth. Its fluffy tail was moving with the light breeze.
“No, I was thinking of going away for a month or so and then of course I would come back” Draco said.
As he opened the door to their bedroom he saw something very strange: a sealed envelope was laying on the bed.
“Okay, well I may have spilled Snoodle’s treats on the floor a few weeks ago but I cleaned everything up and replaced them! I promise you I have done nothing to warrant your anger or disappointment towards me in the past few months” Harry said.
“Harry! Please calm down: everything will be alright with Draco” Hermione said as she grasped her friend’s shoulders.
He turned his head toward Lavender to ask her about Hermione’s pet but she was giving him a shocked look.
“I can’t actually believe he’s your godfather. I mean, Snape doesn’t seem like a man who likes children”
“You wouldn’t truly be happy with the Lions. You aren’t as rash and hotheaded as them and you would stop and think about everything before you do it while they would immediately charge ahead. In my opinion you belong either with the Snakes or the Ravens”
“Draco. Of course, Cedric’s told me all about you, Draco. I want to thank you for helping my son: you’re the best friend he could possibly have in a time like this!” Mr. Diggory said and Draco blushed slightly.
“Was she good? Was she little Miss innocent and perfect? Was she batting her eyelashes at you?” he growled out jealously. Draco frowned this time.
He swam until he found he was in some sort of kelp forest. In the distance he heard a voice singing beautifully. He recognized it as one of the voices from the egg, or at least one that sounded a lot like it.
“I saw him walking away muttering angrily to himself about evil and lying women” Kate said as she sat down next to him.
“You’re great... I can see why Draco likes you so much” he muttered, breathing quite fast. She chuckled.
“I was busy this afternoon” Draco said and watched with the corner of his eye as Kate blushed. Kate touched his leg with hers from under the table and Draco didn’t shy away from her touch.
“Quickly! We need to get him to St. Mungo’s as fast as possible!” James said as Sirius and him made their way to the Floo connection and flooed to the hospital.
“You see, Harry... uhh they were both kinda... sorta... naked” Hermione blushed at the memory, feeling embarrassed.
Life without Harry was a bit more dull however he managed to keep himself occupied with his studies. If he kept on with his current schedule he knew that by Easter he would have finished the Second Year’s Hogwarts Curriculum. That would leave him some months for him to start getting ahead with the Third Year’s one.
“Hi” Draco said in a low voice as he cleared his throat. He looked adorably embarrassed as the red tint to his cheeks highlighted his pale complexion and cheek bones.
I was wrong to criticize your work, as I’ve clearly seen recently with the release of the Spattergroit Cure that your brilliant mind came up with. I wanted to congratulate you earlier on that by the way but I couldn’t find a way to reach you.
Draco nodded and pushed away his plate and waited in silence with his head down for the adults to finish.
“Of course you will; I trust you know what a date rape drug like Rohypnol can do so I’m suspecting that’s how it’ll happen. Either that or you’ll have me handcuffed to the bed” he grinned at the other man, playing along.
As he descended the stairs slowly and with effort, James came up to him and asked if he felt he could manage a trip to the Manor to get stuff he wanted.
Harry, not wanting to think about Draco’s eating disorder (which had fallen as a secondary problem in light of his coma), slowly made his way up the stairs to Draco’s room.
He noticed the upper body was covered in a hard and rough looking deep red/brownish shell while the lower part was of a dirty beige and looked to be more smooth and tender. The pincers were of this same exact color except for the tips which were red/brown.
“Excuse me!” a voice called. It was their neighbor who was calling him from the other side of the fence.
“It’s fine, Cedric. I’ll be here if you decide to come back later, but right now you look ready to fall asleep while standing” he said in a scratchy voice.
Draco looked amazing and Harry had to make an effort not to stare at him for the whole duration of the ball: he was wearing black robes with a white shirt underneath that enhanced his fair complexion and beautiful ass. Unfortunately also Kate looked stunning in her mint green flowy dress.
Draco didn’t seem to be that much interested however as he obediently followed James without complain wherever he went and listened to what he had to say without interrupting or making contributions of his own to the monologue her husband was reciting.
Lucius’ eyes betrayed his bored face as they widened considerably, because of all the things Draco could have said, he hadn’t been expecting that.
Mr. Ollivander took a good look at him and started muttering to himself as he walked to the high shelves filled with boxes, pulled out a case from one of them and handed him the wand inside.
“They were found guilty of child abuse. You won’t have to see them again. And as for where you will be staying, you’ll be living with me, my husband, James, and our son, Harry, darling. Is that alright with you? You can say no if you don’t want to” she informed him.
Draco prayed he had made the right decision in accepting Harry’s plea, because he didn’t know if his heart could take it if it were broken once more.
“My little innocent Draco is all grown up! He’s not so innocent anymore” Blaise wiped fake tears away from his eyes.
“I’ve missed you so much” he whispered into his ear while placing a kiss onto the pale skin of his neck.
Since then he had noticed little changes in his behavior and this had caused general gratitude in Gryffindor house towards him.
“It signifies the charm has started working, so now Cedric basically is camouflaged as his surroundings” Draco said.
His first thought was ‘But it’s Quidditch!’ but the more he thought about it the more everything made sense: he had simply assumed Draco was embarrassed because he didn’t know how to fly as well on a broomstick but now he knew the true reason his friend didn’t like to be up in the air.
People had called him ‘gay’ loads of times before and he never had been too affected by the word itself, even when it was used as an insult.
He cast a quick ‘Tempus’ which revealed it was nearly nine o’clock so he began preparing Snoodle’s breakfast which consisted in grass hay, rabbit pellets and some cut vegetables.
He also managed to catch up with his homework and refused to be given different assignments from his classmates just because  he had suffered a head trauma and was still recovering.
You’re so unwilling to admit your own faults that you’re always blaming me for every single thing. Well, I can’t be with someone as immature as you anymore.
Draco looked sadly at his ruined satchel’s contents. He would have to re-do all of his homework and buy new stationary and books... he sighed.
As he checked out all the rooms, he even discovered a wine cellar full of rich and expensive wines. As he tried to open the last door, he found it locked and when he tried the unlocking charm it didn’t work.
He didn’t say anything though and let Harry continue talking about all the things they would do in Gryffindor Tower and once they were on the Quidditch Team.
“Ho- hhhmpf-“ he kept on clearing his throat so Lily quickly offered him a glass of water from the night stand.
“Ah, you’re awake! Do you think you can manage a trip to Diagon Alley to get the things you need?” he asked him and Draco nodded. He did feel a bit better now after his nap.
He needed to show Draco just how serious he was about this. He would not make the same mistakes again.
“That’s it!” You’re brilliant! That’s exactly what we need to do!” Hermione said in a frenzy as she started muttering and planning every single little detail about her plan.
“I’m not sure where my parents put them... They usually had someone hand me some clothes every other day so I don’t know where they kept them”
Draco told Harry about all his studying and his visits to Healer Kum while Harry told Draco about Hogwarts and his friends.
Some of the reason why the rumors hadn’t died out was Rita bloody Skeeter, who had wrote a few articles about the Triwizard Tournament over the course of the summer.
“To the Library. I have to start working on the details for the Prefect’s rounds. Easter isn’t that far away and I need to complete this schedule” she explained as she gestured to the piece of paper she was holding.
“James, don’t push him. He’s not hungry!” Lily said in a scolding voice as she patted affectionately Draco’s head.
“He’ll probably be in the Library studying his ass off or something” Ron muttered, not looking up from his Quidditch magazine.
Lily and James stayed by his bedside as Draco sweated and dealt with the pain by closing his eyes and gritting his teeth.
Soon it was Easter and he was feeling rather excited for two main reasons: he would be seeing Harry again and he had finished the Second Year’s Curriculum so they had time to do things together.
Harry’s instincts were screaming at him to mark the blond as his. ‘Back off! He’s MINE and ONLY MINE!’. However he didn’t think Draco would appreciate it if he did so, so he simply remained behind and waited behind the corner as everyone headed to Gryffindor Tower. He tried to listen to what the two were talking about but they were too far away. He carefully leaned out a bit and glanced at them from behind the wall.
Both the Ravenclaw and the Hufflepuff were covered in blood and had passed out and Harry was panicking. Again.
He had been so happy and proud of Draco. His  work had been praised and appreciated all over the world.
“Miss Aguillon, I need to speak with my student. If you could please leave us alone for a few minutes: I’ll return him to you shortly” someone said from behind them as they walked to Ravenclaw Tower.
As he quickly left the Library he started thinking about all the places where Draco could have gone and prayed he wasn’t in the Head Dorms as only the Head Students were allowed in there for the moment as Draco hadn’t yet told him the password (he had barely moved in there with all his stuff yesterday).
He picked up the baby rabbit and carried it onto his picnic blanket so they were sitting comfortably in the shade. He placed the bunny in front of him and thought about what to do: he had to sterilize the wound and then heal it.
“You’re not asking, I’m offering. Besides, I like helping you and finding out more information!” Draco said.
“Hello Harry” he said and smiled shakily, separating himself slightly from the other man, who was reluctant to let the blond out of his arms.
After his parents had sued for his injuries, the Ministry has officially declared that no other student would be involved in the tasks so at least they didn’t have to worry about Draco having his head bashed in again.
During the summer Harry and Draco spent almost every day together and by September they felt like they had known each other all their lives.
Since its mother was dead what would happen to the baby? Would James and Lily let him keep it? After all, James had been the one to suggest he got a pet and a bunny counted as one... Besides, this poor baby would never survive alone in the wild and needed a home.
As they apparated outside the grounds of Malfoy Manor, he quickly looked around and found he was standing alone in front of the back of the house.
“Don’t be ridiculous! Draco would never fall for her...” he said and it sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than Ron.
“Is the french beauty you were talking with earlier the reason why you’re so happy?” Dean asked Draco, who blushed crimson red.
In fact, over the night loads of people had come over to him to congratulate him on his work. He had never been happier.
“I’ll be in the stands, cheering for you. I’d say ‘good luck’ but I’m pretty sure that would be overkill” Draco smiled at his friend and left the tent they were in.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Draco. I-I didn’t mean-I was awful and conceited and too bloody arrogant” Harry said as he looked straight into Draco’s beautiful grey eyes.
Harry was waiting for him on the platform and the two of them made their way to their parents in complete silence.
Draco frowned at Harry’s language but couldn’t stop the corner of his lips from turning up a little. If only Harry knew...
Draco took the smooth red colored wood with both hands and examined it: it was nice and he liked the simple shape of it.
“You’re not disturbing us at all! We want you there with us, sweetie!” she said as she got up and then helped him stand up. She noticed he had gotten more comfortable with her and James touching him. Hopefully this was a good sign.
Draco kept on looking at her until he cleared his throat; it looked like he was trying to do so as quietly as possible.
“She also wrote everything about your health conditions: about your respiratory problems, about your head surgery and about your-your heart stopping... is this true? Did your heart really stop?” Cedric said.
Draco decided to be brave for once and slowly leaned in. She seemed to get closer to him as well as he could suddenly feel her breath on his skin. They both closed their eyes.
“Of course! You can’t not go to school! You’ve already missed two years, so I’m afraid you’ll have to catch up, however I have faith in your capabilities. By September next year you’ll be ready to go to school.
“Hello Mr. Potter. I’m terribly sorry to barge in on you unannounced but I needed to speak with you urgently” she said while entering the apartment.
‘Oh no, please have mercy on me’ Draco thought. Dancing with Pansy was always a health hazard as she stepped on your toes and sometimes kneed you in... delicate places.
“Hey, shhh. It’s okay. I won’t hurt you. You’re safe here” Lily said as she tried to calm down the panicking boy.
“Uhm... I’m not sure Lavender. I think you really shouldn’t-” Draco said just as her hand closed on the wand.
“Kate, wait, I’m not anorexic or bulimic or suicidal or anything. I don’t not eat because I want to be thin, in reality I really want to eat in a healthy portion!” Draco said urgently.
“Darling, you’re better off without him” Pansy said as she set a cup of coffee with milk and sugar in front of her best friend of a lifetime.
“Yes. Theodore Nott and his two goons will think twice before deciding they want to hurt my godson” Professor Snape said darkly.
“It sounds lovely” he said. She nodded and reached for her quill but accidentally made a few pieces of parchment containing the ball details fly to the ground.
Spending time away from you has made me understand just how important you are to me, Draco, and I regret everything that I said and did that made you feel like I didn’t love you.
“There’s this house in school called ‘Slytherin’ that’s filled with racist gits and their colors are dark green and silver” Harry said and Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco had been lost (he couldn’t remember which corridors he had to follow to go back to the main wing of the castle) when Cedric found him and helped him get back to Ravenclaw Tower.
Since Draco had told him his family had never really celebrated Christmas before, Harry had insisted they do everything that was typical of the holiday and in the meantime they could get to know each other.
“It’s going to be just fine, Ron. It’s what we do: we fight and then make up. We always find a way to make it work” Harry explained to his friend.
Cedric immediately sprinted towards the Maze. Looking back he saw the tall bushes and vines wrap around each other and seal the road behind him.
“He’s like an evil mastermind plotting world domination” Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear, making him laugh out loud.
“My mother gave it to me as a birthday present” he said. She didn’t say anything more so he stayed silent, simply enjoying her presence. He could stay like that for days. He didn’t know why but he felt relaxed.
“But-But why?” James asked in a childish manner and Lily internally rolled her eyes. She had seen her husband use the puppy-eyes to get what he wanted but this time she had a feeling Draco wasn’t going to be moved on this matter.
He knew he had to confess his feelings but every time he tried to the words just wouldn’t come out. So, instead, he opted for making sure Draco wasn’t ‘distracted’ by anyone, especially Slytherin whores.
“Basically you coat your glasses once a month with these two potions and they will always be clean, un-foggy and won’t break or get scratch marks” he explained.
“Don’t apologize. You’ve been studying your ass off for the last few months. You’re allowed to get distracted by my amazingness ” Harry chuckled.
“NO! He can’t! He has to eat! I’ll force the food down his throat myself if he doesn’t!” Harry said in worry. He didn’t want Draco to go to a hospital. He didn’t want Draco to leave him.
“This is Draco’s handwriting...” he muttered in relief as he uncorked the potion and immediately smelled a sweet scent.
“But I am happy” Draco said “I have a loving family, amazing friends, a wonderful girlfriend and a pet bunny!”
Next they went to Flourish and Blotts to buy Draco’s school books as he would have to catch up with the Hogwarts First and Second Year’s Curriculums. James also suggested he buy a book called “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”. It was written by a Muggle guy called ‘Jules Verne’.
And so Draco was forced to inform his friends both in Gryffindor and Ravenclaw about Nott, Crabbe and Goyle.
As Draco closed the door behind him, Harry sighed, walked down to the living room and flung himself on the sofa.
I swear on my parents’ graves that I never ever wanted to hurt you or make you think that you weren’t important to me.
She had been forced to leave for Beauxbatons when the tournament had ended, before Draco could wake up, and hadn’t been able to return to England because of her parents.
As his father handed him his trunk he realized this was it. This would be the moment he would be alone in the world with only one person who knew him (without counting Snoodle).
Cedric had won the Triwizard Tournament and had officially declared Draco the reason for his victory.
“IT’S NOT HERE WITH YOU?! W-WHY?! WHY WOULD YOU CONDEMN YOUR POOR BROOM TO A SAD LIFE IN A DARK, LONELY CUPBOARD WHEN YOU CAN KEEP IT HERE WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES, READY TO GO FOR A SPIN?!” Harry said (more like shouted) at him and Draco cringed. Harry definitely got this *passion* from his father.
He and his friends sat down in a secluded table in the Library and waited for Draco to arrive. He had sent a note to him earlier, asking if they could study together.
“Of course Draco likes you, honey” she soothed. The two boys had really taken to each other and both the adults were sure the boys liked each other and enjoyed hanging out together.
“Well, I asked Draco if he wanted to play in the snow with me but he went back to sleep...” he said with a small pout.
He checked the wardrobe and indeed all of Draco’s clothes were gone. There wasn’t one single thing that had belonged to his boyfriend in the flat.
Harry got closer to him and placed a soft hand under Draco’s chin and lifted it until grey met green.
He should have known his father would want to speak with Draco: Cedric had mentioned his friend in his letters quite often.
The scent of food filled the air and for the first time ever he actually felt like he could finish a whole meal (something he hadn’t managed to do yet even almost a year after he was adopted and his diet drastically changed).
“Oh, where are my manners! I’m Amos Diggory, Cedric’s father” Mr. Diggory said and offered him his hand to shake.
Lily expressed how proud she was of the both of them as she hugged them while James only patted them on the back.
As he walked up the stairs, exhausted, he tiredly answered the question to gain access to his old dorms. He couldn’t even bear to see either Harry or Elizabeth right now so he opted to stay in his dorms.
“Ron! There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be prepared! Final exams are in two days!” Hermione exclaimed.
“‘Come seek us where our voices sound’ so we know the task will take place under water...” Cedric muttered.
“I think you don’t. And that’s why you feel the need to take out your frustrations on people you deem ‘weaker than you’. You felt threatened by me the moment I stepped into the Great Hall to be sorted didn’t you? Malfoys have always been in Slytherin and you thought that because of my presence you suddenly wouldn’t be top dog anymore. Do you really believe that by insulting me you’re establishing ‘dominance’ in front of the other Slytherins?
“When they examined the body... she also kept a diary in which she wrote everything she did and thought” Kate said.
She giggled softly and Draco’s heart jumped slightly in his chest. It was a very soft and melodic sound, just like her voice.
He tried to separate himself from her but she was surprisingly strong. He gripped her hair and cheek as he tried to pull away.
He and Harry were sitting in the Library, revising for their final exams as Draco hoped to get high marks in all of the subjects. Fifth Year had really flown by...
“We could play Quidditch! Or I could show him all the ways you can polish your broomstick! Oh! Maybe we can do some tricks in the air!” Harry gushed as he planned all the possible activities. Lily simply shook her head.
His eyes widened when he realized what was in the clearing: two bodies were floating there, tied to the floor of the lake with kelp.
Fortunately Draco’s health had improved a lot by the time Christmas had come and he had been completely healed; his eating habits however were a bit more slow going and he still couldn’t manage to have three full meals a day. He could keep down pretty much anything as long as he didn’t have too much.
“It’s just... you’re a good and kind person, Draco. You’ve been through so much in your life... I only want for you to be happy...” Harry said.
Harry was a bit more difficult to convince because as soon as he found out what Nott was doing he wanted to go and curse the git.
He promised Cedric he would help and help he would. Time was against him, however, as the task was tomorrow...
Sighing he sat on the sofa and started doing some of his work-related paperwork while his wife cooked dinner in the other room. He would have helped her, but he hadn’t even offered as he already knew the answer would be ‘no’. He was a complete disaster in the kitchen: this fact was proven by the ‘hilarious’ story Sirius liked to tell of the time he tried to cook some pasta and ended up burning down the stove.
I also won’t pretend that your sexual encounter with that man didn’t hurt, especially only a week after we’d broken up, but if you swear that you didn’t plan it to purposefully hurt me, then I believe you.
Truthfully he was a little bit disappointed Draco didn’t like Quidditch but he knew he would soon get over it. Instead he thought about something they could do that Draco would enjoy. Suddenly an amazing idea popped in his head.
“I’ll miss you all” Draco said as he hugged his parents and Godfather. He left Harry for last as he knew he would be the hardest to leave.
“You’re a disappointment” his father said with a sneer as he slapped him hard across the face. Draco could feel the sting of his ring against his face even after his father had left his “room”, or more accurately, his cell.
“Follow me” he said as he lead them to the back of the bank and hopped into a cart. As they rode it he watched as they passed what seemed to be an infinite number of vaults until they finally came to a stop.
“Well played, Draco” Lavender said as she smiled at him again and ran her hand down his  arm. Draco awkwardly shifted some more towards the window and away from her. Why was she this close?
“I have very good news: you and I will be going to the graduation ball together!” she said happily as she latched herself to his side and gripped his arm. Harry tried to keep his jealousy in check and barely stifled a groan.
This treatment can be administered in various ways depending on the severeness of the case. It has to be applied externally, like a very watery cream (its consistency is quite denser than water), to treat the blisters and scars, however it is most effective when taken orally as it directly tackles the infected cells in the body and neutralizes them.
A lot of students and professors had come in and left flowers and well wishes and their gratitude to Draco for saving Cedric.
Now that Harry had managed to finally get Draco to listen to him, every single thing he had wanted to say to the blond seemed to vanish from his mind as he lost himself into those grey eyes.
He opened his eyes and immediately frowned at the pain he felt in his body, like he couldn’t move. The room was familiar: it was the cell he had spent most of his life in.
“I can’t. It’s-It’s hard for me to eat... I don’t want to go into detail, just know that all my life I’ve been used to eating a certain way until when I was taken in by the Potters everything changed and it was too much...” Draco hoped she understood what he meant.
“Look, Harry, who you date is none of my business, just please don’t involve me in your stupid jokes ever again” Draco said finally when Harry only stared at him.
Once outside it didn’t take a long time to spot his date as she was standing alone looking at the stars. No one else was outside due to the cold weather.
“Goodnight. And thank you: I had such a wonderful time” Kate smiled as she kissed his cheek and turned to walk away. Draco stayed where he was.
Mostly he still felt betrayed and hurt and didn’t want to even think about how much it hurt when he saw Harry kissing Elizabeth.
“Why didn’t you tell me, Draco, about the eating disorder?” Kate asked. Draco raised his eyebrow. How did she-
“Are you sure about this? Two children to manage aren’t a walk in the park, Lily” James said. He loved his wife’s idea but wanted to make sure she was sure.
Draco smiled and looked out of the window. The trees were green as the spring cold had started to leave Scotland in favor of a warmer weather.
“I wanted to apologize, you know, for Rita Skeeter...the article...because I didn’t get a chance before. Also, I wanted to tell you about the egg” Cedric said.
“Well, Draco was never adopted so he’s only part of your family as a foster kid. Also, I’ve never heard either you or Draco refer to each other as brothers so I’m pretty sure he doesn’t consider you as one” Hermione said.
“Why don’t you come with me, beautiful? We can have some fun together” Nott brazenly flirted with Kate.
“How’s your head?” Kate asked him as the three of them started walking to the Great Hall for dinner.
“If I were you I would kill myself, Malfoy. It would make me much happier!” Nott provoked him again.
“How do I tell him? I mean isn’t it going to be awkward? Technically we’re brothers! Maybe he doesn’t see me that way! Maybe he’s not even gay!” Harry said in a panic.
“That’s what I’ve started calling you in my mind. I can stop if you want” Draco could feel shyness rapidly making its presence known in him.
“Someone get him a blanket for Merlin’s sake!” Professor Snape barked. Two ministry officials rushed in and handed the man a warm and fluffy towel, which he immediately wrapped around his godson’s shoulders.
The third and last task of the Triwizard Tournament was in a few minutes and Cedric was close to panicking.
“Because I don’t. This little boy has already gone through enough pain and suffering to last him a lifetime. I want him to be happy, I want him to have a normal life with a loving family. I guess the idea of leaving him with total strangers doesn’t sit well with me...” James looked up at his wife’s face and found her eyes full of understanding.
“I told you to close the door AFTER they’d entered not BEFORE!” Hermione hissed at a guilty looking Ron. It seemed like their plan to lock Draco and Harry in a room to force them to acknowledge their feelings for each other was going to fail, as the door to the cupboard wouldn’t open until later.
“If you show anymore symptoms please come here at once so we can address them as quickly as possible” Dr. Dirwin said.
He groggily yawned when suddenly he became aware of the heat coming from the body laying next to him and immediately opened his eyes.
Hagrid had already informed him he would be going last as he was older so he waited for his name to be called as the group of First Years grew smaller and smaller.
He kept his head down and resumed walking. He heard running footsteps from behind him as a hand shot out to gently grab his shoulder and stop him.
“Would you like me to hold that for you, sweetie? Since you don’t have pockets...” she asked him. He accepted her offer gratefully. After all, he didn’t want to lose the money.
As their lips met everything around them spun and suddenly they were left alone in their own little world.
“Because they’re Gryffindors: from what I’ve gathered, if one points out to them how un-noble an action they commit truly is then they will immediately cease to do it” he said as the Sorting Hat’s words popped up in his head again: ‘Manipulation skills”.
‘Its rude for people to refer to her as ‘Fat Lady’, as if being fat was her biggest achievement in her entire life’ he thought to himself.
“Is there anything else you think you need?” she asked him as the three of them continued with their shopping trip.
A gorgeous mint green leather desk mat was in his hands. He looked in awe at it and then at Lily who was smiling at him.
“Whatever you say, your Highness” Draco chuckled as Harry shook his head while laughing and returned to polishing his broom.
“What!? That’s what you think?! Oh no, no, no, no, No! You have got it all wrong, Draco! SHE kissed ME, against my will, just to divide us. That two-faced bitch knew you were coming in the Library, so she kissed me to make you think I didn’t want you!” Harry explained, praying that Draco believed him.
“I’m fourteen. How about you? You don’t look like you’re seventeen” he said. She still had some more girlish features that her older classmates lacked.
He admitted he was attractive. Draco liked his expressive and vibrant green eyes and... and his smile, it was comforting.
Eventually things got better: Draco was still healing but at least he could move around slowly and study enough to catch up.
Hermione and Ron shared a worried look as they made him sit down on a chair and handed him a glass of water.
“Guys, the merit isn’t only mine. Draco helped too! He was the one who devised today’s strategy!” Cedric said as he hugged Draco’s shoulder even though he was fairly shorter.
With Harry’s constant support and with Dr. Dirwin’s help he soon felt a lot better and didn’t have as much trouble with eating as before.
As he set the bunny on the bed, it immediately hopped over to Draco and settled in the crook of his neck.
I feel like I could go in forever listing all the things I like about you and that would only be the tip of the iceberg” Harry said seriously as he looked straight into Draco’s eyes.
We need to talk, please. I miss you and I need you to at least know the truth about what happened the other day.
We caught a glimpse of them at the International Medical Conference for Magical and Non-Magical Diseases back in London, where the two shared a reunion.
To make the smell more inviting (because so far it smelled like rotten eggs/fish) he added some Rose Roots and let them soak in the liquid before taking them out.
“The Brew of Aquaspiritus is tricky to make, Draco, but I think you‘ll manage just fine. You have my permission to use the storage cupboard and the potions classroom”
“Where did you go to school before, Draco?” Harry asked him and Draco almost choked on his steamed carrot.
Particularly one showed Draco lifting Astoria and pinning her up against the wall, her legs wrapped around his waist and her hands pressed against the wall by one of his.
“Cedric. Listen to me. Everything will be just fine. We’ve been preparing for months and I’m absolutely positive you can win this” Draco gently said.
They were currently sitting in a pub, drinking beer and discussing Harry’s most recent fight with his boyfriend, Draco Malfoy.
first of all I would like to thank you all for being here tonight. It is a very important evening, not only for me, but for all of those out there who’ve suffered from this horrible illness.
She stayed there in shock until finally she carried herself to her room to think about her ‘conversation with Draco’.
“I like potions a lot and Severus said there are quite a few ways to get involved with the potions industry: teaching, working for the Ministry, researching”
“A SHED? YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR POOR BROOMSTICK IN A COLD AND LONELY SHED?!” James shrieked like an eight year old girl and Draco flinched.
“I can’t believe to two. Didn’t it cross your minds that maybe I wanted to wait for the opportune moment? Didn’t it occur to you that MAYBE I MIGHT WANT TO CONFESS SUCH A THING ON MY OWN THERMS? I don’t need YOUR help!” he said, letting out all of his anger.
He had heard of apparating before because his father sometimes did it when he came to his cell instead of walking down to the dungeon but he didn’t know what “floo” meant. He refrained from asking.
Why Harry was awake at 4 AM was a mystery, however at the moment he was too preoccupied with drying his face and hair.
“I admit he’s a gloomy fellow but other than that he’s quite alright. A damn good teacher if you ask me” Cedric said, not looking up from the parchment he was writing an essay on about the International Warlock Convention of 1289.
“You lost it when they took you and Dumbledore asked if one of us could keep it safe and return it to you when you came back” Ron explained.
“A house elf gave it to me when I was little because I didn’t have anything to do in the cell. When father found out he was punished for showing me kindness” he explained quietly when the adults just looked at him.
When he stopped crying, James left him so he could take his medicine in peace. He laid back in bed: his potions soon did their job and helped him fall asleep as easily as possible.
Lately there has been speculation on whether Mr. Malfoy, after his recent break up, was in a relationship and finally it seems like we’ve got some answers!
“What is it this time Lavender?” Seamus asked as Dean rolled his eyes. The girl was notoriously known for spreading gossip that often didn’t even concern their friend group.
He was just glad his head pains had reduced a lot and now they were at least manageable by pain-relieving potions.
As Ron handed him a sobering potion and his glasses, he hastily put on some clothes before going back in the living room.
“For the record, my surname is Malfoy, not Potter” Draco muttered as he placed a soft kiss to Kate’s forehead.
Suddenly his uncle’s arms were around him, securing him in a tight hug. Draco awkwardly returned it.
“Good morning, Snoodle” he said as he pet him on the head and the bunny raised his ears in response. Chuckling quietly he became aware of the smell of food coming from downstairs.
“What do you think it means by ‘We've taken what you'll sorely miss, an hour long you'll have to look and recover what we took, but past an hour — the prospect's black too late, it's gone, it won't come back’?” Cedric asked him after a moment of silence.
“Could you at least inform him I would like to explain myself? Here, I wrote this letter. If you could... maybe... make sure he reads it?” Harry asked as he gave the letter to the other boy.
“Draco, please, listen to me! I don’t like her at all, in fact, I detest her! She’s just a cruel bitch who’s playing both me and you and trying to tear us apart! Please, you have got to believe me!” Harry said.
“Oh I don’t think so. You see I’ll just claim you kissed me and I didn’t want it” she smirked victoriously at him and walked away.
“Would you like to stay for a drink? A glass of wine perhaps?” she asked shyly, standing by the door.
“I know, the chocolate was for me. You can have vanilla or whatever...” she said with a dismissive wave of her hand. This time he actually laughed.
Lily walked behind them and sighed while shaking her head when she saw her husband practically show Draco everything the shop had in display. Secretly she knew her husband had always desperately wanted to be the one who introduced their child to Quidditch. Instead Harry had received his first broom as a gift from his godfather, Sirius Black, effectively robbing James of his chance to explain every single little detail of the sport to him because Harry, being only seven years old, had wanted Uncle Sirius to explain everything to him.
Draco tilted his head to the side and crossed his arms over his chest, not letting any emotion pass over him except for total indifference.
“You were amazing! I’ve never seen someone stand up to Nott that way!” Draco said once he was sure the Slytherins were out of ear shot. He really was in awe.
He looked at her closely. She hadn’t changed much. She was wearing a Prussian blue dress that enhanced her lithe form and minimal makeup. Her hair was pulled back in a neat bun and she was wearing a silver necklace with a sapphire gem and matching earrings. She was very simple yet in excellent taste. Just as he remembered her.
Harry and Draco were sitting on a picnic blanket by the Black Lake, enjoying the fresh air. As Harry polished his broom, Draco couldn’t help but look at his friend in a different way for the first time.
“Because I’m afraid Madam Malkin’s employees are big gossips and can’t resist spreading out all kinds of information to anyone who will listen. If we go there I assure you by the end of the day everyone in Diagon Alley will know we’ve taken Draco in and I don’t want him to be the subject to rumors. We were lucky enough everyone at St. Mungo’s who knew the reason why Draco was in the hospital was obliviated. We can’t risk anyone knowing of the abuse he went through because he will very likely be bullied and teased mercilessly and I won’t stand for it. We’ll go to Twilfitt and Tattings. Besides, I think Draco’s parents used to shop there because it is considered more upper class by pureblood families” Lily said and James nodded.
It just so happened that one evening as he was walking to his study session with Cedric he overheard his name being said in what seemed to be a private conversation.
“Mate, you’re reading into this far more than necessary. I’m sure they just went to Paris because of that new restaurant opening that evening” Ron explained.
“You never cease to amuse me, Malfoy” Nott said cruelly as he opened Draco’s satchel and turned it over, spilling all of its contents on the floor. Draco winced when he heard his inkwell shatter and cover everything in black ink.
“This wand has been waiting for you and only you for thousands of years: it chose you for a reason, and that is an encouraging thought. Wand laws are not set in stone since every person’s bond with their wand is unique. It is old magic: trust its instinct”
“My boy! That’s MY BOY” Mr. Diggory had cried out as he grasped his son’s shoulders and turned him around.
“Oh that’s not good. Draco was absolutely crazy for you, you know! We have got to make him see that you feel the same!” Michael said.
“Oh, you’re awake! Sorry, I didn’t mean to barge in, I was just checking if you were alright! Have you been up for long?” Lily asked him as she moved to sit with him on the floor.
“I promise you I’m nowhere near your mother’s friend. I’ve been recovering a lot lately and eating has become less of a burden. In fact, this is the second time I’ve tried becoming normal and so far I’ve been making a lot of progress!” Draco said cheerily.
“Unfortunately, first we have to find out what is causing this symptom before curing it. He’s been scheduled for an MRI scan in twenty minutes so hopefully we can see if he’s had any trauma in his head that we’ve missed. His chart did say he was hit in the head; do you know what object was used?” Healer Montary asked.
During this months he divided his time between his studies, Snoodle, Harry, Cedric and his other friends.
What Harry would have payed to be Snoodle in that moment as Draco ran his fingers through the black fur. Harry imagined them combing through his hair and a shiver of pleasure went down his spine.
“Well, you don’t have to, but I suggest you do. It’s good for you if you have a sum of money to keep with you, not necessarily a lot, just enough for an emergency or something” James said.
Draco examined the wand: it was gnarled, of a light color and was very long and thick at the tip. He didn’t particularly like it... and was slightly relieved when he tried it and the vase broke again.
“I love it” he said as he admired his room “Thank you” he then added while turning to face Lily. She smiled.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of, Draco. It is a very common thing that can occur, especially with eating disorders like yours that are based on habits. Starting from now I will follow you with your recovery which I expect you to make completely” she said.
“Right now I could kill the person who decided to basically kidnap you and place you underwater...” Kate muttered as she wrapped her arms around Draco and leaned in to rest her head between the crook of his neck and his chest.
How could he have been so stupid! All those glances, those touches, those words... just a lie. Everything had been just a joke to the brunette.
It was true. He had felt like this for a while and wanted to have a little time just to himself. To organize his thoughts. A lot had happened in the last few years and even more was going to happen once he left school. As a boy who had had limited contact with the world, he was struggling with the last of the demons in his closet. He just needed some time to deal with the fact that his life was going to drastically change. Again.
“I didn’t want to… burden you with my problems” he said as he bowed his head. Kate gently took his chin and lifted his head to meet her eyes.
Suddenly both of them realized just how intimate their position was so they disentangled themselves and stood up.
His night was filled with nightmares and flashbacks about the moment he discovered Harry was just toying with him.
The two remaining months of school also passed quickly for Draco, who was getting rather excited to go to Hogwarts. He couldn’t wait until September.
Draco ran up the stairs and opened his bedroom door, finding the little black rabbit perched on his bed by the pillow.
The healer nodded and wrote down this bit of information; he then told them to set the boy down on a bed and they would take it from there.
“-they started making out after Harry confessed his feelings to Draco! Isn’t it amazing!?” she squealed as the other Gryffindors either grinned or smiled.
The two adults noticed Draco wasn’t in a very talkative mood so they made sure to keep the conversation alive all the way home.
Draco himself had never been targeted by the man (he wondered if this was because of his natural talent for potions and because he was good and well behaved or because Sev had a soft spot for him - personally, he hoped the former) but he could understand why his Gryffindor friends weren’t keen on him: Sev was a ‘bit’ mean to them.
“Draco...” she said but received no answer so she continued “I won’t get mad if you haven’t been eating but you have to tell me.” she said.
“He can’t die. He can’t die. Not like this. Not before I’ve told him... Not-Not now” Harry said as he sobbed. He had the image of a deadly pale Draco laying unconscious on the stand’s floor and couldn’t shake it out from his head.
The next day he was feeling quite tired because of this and opted to go study in the garden. He was sitting on a picnic blanket under a tree, reading “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”.
Draco smiled and closed his eyes. He let his body relax and his mind calm as he reveled in being close to Harry again.
He looked at the clock. Well it was pretty late. He could make this decision tomorrow when he was better rested.
“Anyone will do” he replied quietly. It really didn’t matter since all houses seemed good enough for him.
Draco nodded and pulled out from his pocket a little black bouncy ball. He held it in his hand and showed it to his foster parents.
Harry brushed back a stray strand of hair and leaned down to kiss Draco gently on the forehead. He breathed in Draco’s familiar scent and sighed in content.
“Snape favors his own house rather than others’ and this is the first time he punishes his own for the sake of a student who isn’t a Snake. Do you think it means something?” Lavender explained.
Draco was very busy in the two months following the Yule Ball: with studying, spending time with Kate (and Snoodle who had caught a bit of a cold) and helping Cedric with research he barely had any free time.
After his little conversation with Elizabeth, the Head Girl had decided she couldn’t even look at him without blushing, leaving him and Harry loads of time to explore their blooming relationship. Their friends and parents knew and approved of them. Even Severus had voiced his approval.
Harry noticed his crush was feeling a bit off so he placed his hand on Draco’s and gently entwined his fingers with his.
It completely blocked Cedric’s way and unfortunately turning around he noticed the bushes had closed behind him.
He had even made a lot of progress with his eating disorder and his therapist said he would be completely healed in about a year if he kept on going like he was now. These things took time anyway...
He recognized it now. In fact, he knew this ring well unfortunately. He had felt the sting of it on his cheek and knew the marks it left on his body like the back of his hand after years of beatings.
“Don’t worry, judging by the way you had her against the wall I’d say you scored pretty good last night. Besides you are a very good dancer” he mused.
“I didn’t do anything wrong. I just feel like rewarding you! You’ve been so brave with all that you went through so I thought you deserved a few gifts” Harry said.
“I’ve no doubts about his talent, Sir, I’m mainly concerned about his health...” Draco trailed off and watched as the three champions entered the Maze and disappeared through the leaves, out of sight.
He had given Draco an ultimatum: it was either him or his work; and Harry knew his boyfriend loved him so he would definitely choose him.
As the three of them got into position to start, Cedric looked for Draco in the crowd and found his friend’s blond head in the very front row, sitting next to his father, Amos Diggory, and talking with him.
“Please relax, I’m not here to stop you from seeing Draco. I suspect nothing could keep you two apart and that’s precisely why I’m here” she said to him, allowing him to breathe out in relief. She continued speaking.
How was he supposed to apologize if he couldn’t even see him!? Unfortunately he also didn’t know where Draco was staying at the moment so going to the blond was not an option for Harry.
“Harry. Have you ever wondered why Draco doesn’t keep his broom in his room like you and your father do? Why he prefers to watch you do tricks while he only sits on his broom? Why he doesn’t seem as eager as you to play Quidditch? Not everyone enjoys flying, sweetie, and the only thing you can do is accept that” she said.
“What are you reading?” Lavender said as she glanced over his shoulder and covered with her hair his bunny. He heard Snoodle make a little sound of protest so he gently brushed her hair away from his shoulder and transferred his pet to his left shoulder (this way he could also look out of the window).
“But I’m not your son. I never was. And that’s okay, because if I were, Merlin knows where I would be now” Draco said while standing up and walking to the door.
It was only during Dumbledore’s welcoming speech that Draco truly realized just how dangerous this tournament really was. He made a mental note to talk to Cedric and try to convince him not to compete.
Draco turned around and raised an eyebrow when he spotted what Michael had left on his bed. He leaned in and looked at the letter.
“On the contrary they could feed me just fine, they just chose... not to.” Draco didn’t want to say too much. He knew Harry wouldn’t go around gossiping to anyone about what he was telling him, however he didn’t want to be pitied either by his friend. Harry was rather protective and had already told him to inform him if anyone was rude to him at school so he would take care of them. As if he was going to take him up on that offer...
Unfortunately by telling his friends Sev was his godfather the news, just like he had predicted, spread quite fast and in only a week basically everyone found out.
“If Harry were here he’d probably overwhelm Draco with his constant chattering about Quidditch moves and of how much he hates Theodore Nott”
Draco knew their time together would most likely end soon so he tried to spend as much time as possible with his girlfriend.
“Oh, well, don’t worry, we’ll get to that later. Isn’t there something else that maybe you want to get from the Manor?”
Harry had started bringing him gifts and praising him for everything he did, which frankly Draco found a bit suspicious.
“They part students into categories: Gryffindors are brave and chivalrous, Slytherins are cunning and ambitious, Ravenclaws are witty and clever and finally Hufflepuffs are kind and generous” Harry said as he looked at Draco closely.
Screams and cries filled the air as the people watching saw Cedric laying on the floor, bleeding and unconscious.
Besides, I just wanted an excuse to spend a little more time with you, Tori” Draco grinned at her and she rolled her eyes.
“Harry, you have to accept the possibility that maybe Draco isn’t into guys” Hermione gently said as she watched Draco and Kate.
As they finished their breakfast Harry immediately dragged Draco upstairs. There still was no sign of either Lily or James.
What should he do? Meet with Harry and hear him out? Ignore this and simply try to forget the brunette?
“No, I’m REALLY sorry, Elizabeth. You were talking and I fell asleep...” he said as he blinked. The poor girl had been working while he slept and it wasn’t fair.
“That’s Shepherd’s Pie: it’s a ground meat pie with a layer of mashed potatoes on top. It’s good but I also find it kind of heavy” he said surprisingly in a non-shy way.
In the living room he found Lily and James looking barely awake and an excited Harry who was petting Hedwig, who on the other hand was staring at Snoodle with a hungry glint in her eyes. Draco wrapped his arms around his baby bunny a little tighter.
“Oh please Harry, you can stop with the theatrics. You can go be with Elizabeth if you want to, but honestly I’d rather not be in your presence if I can help it” Draco said coldly.
But before he could take the last few steps toward his friends, he heard someone call his name. He turned around and saw that a cheery looking man with brown hair and glasses was smiling at him.
“Draco Malfoy” the cheers for the previous student immediately died down as he sat on the stool and the professor placed the Sorting Hat on his head.
“Once you get comfortable with holding hands, we can move on to what you like in men” Harry said, changing the subject.
“Darling, you may feel happy but I promise you that your current eating habits are not enough to sustain a growing young man and soon you’ll be feeling anything but” she said.
The potion is the result of a five year study on this specific disease and I can proudly say it is 100% effective. I have ran hundreds of tests on different affected subjects, taking note of how their bodies responded to the treatment.
“Let’s go home, honey. I’m afraid we stressed our son enough. He should have been home resting, and instead we took him shopping...” Lily said as they quickly headed to the public floo service and flooed home.
“I need you to wake up, Draco. Please. I can’t — I can’t live in a world where you’re....” Harry whispered as he took Draco’s hand in his. He wasn’t sure Draco would be able to hear him while he slept, but he talked anyway. He had to tell Draco eventually about his feelings.
“Why is Draco talking to her!? Why is he not sending her away!?” he cried. He didn’t want his Draco talking with stunning girls.
Draco trusted Harry and knew his friend would never lie to him, so he let the matter of the gifts drop, although he did ask that Harry reduce drastically the quantity which he gave him.
“I know what you’re trying to do and I’m warning you: back off. Draco is mine!” he sneered at her as she rose up from her seat.
The rest of the ride was mainly Harry’s friends interrogating Draco and Draco doing his best to answer as honestly as possible.
Ten minutes later he felt her free hand make its way up from his stomach to his shoulder and heard Kate breathe softly.
The next day Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy’s trials were taking place: as expected Lucius got a life sentence in Azkaban while Narcissa got 80 years without the possibility of parole.
As the two exhausted guys fell asleep naked in bed, Harry couldn’t help but feel guilt rise up in him.
She then picked up Snoodle and cradled him in her hand. Since Draco wasn’t able to look after him, Lily and James had been looking after the bunny.
“Funny, I was supposed to meet Draco here about...” she looked at her watch”... now” she smirked at him. She nodded her head towards a spot behind him. As he turned around he could only frown as he spotted a satchel had been abandoned on the floor, probably by the person who had gasped at seeing them kiss earlier.
The only good thing he had come out with from his investigations was a new friend: Cedric Diggory, an older Hufflepuff boy.
He was quite protective and everyday he would ask Draco how he was feeling and if Nott had done something to him.
He then started thinking about how he could make the bunny swallow the red Healing potion, which had to be drunk for it to work.
“You’re right! I’ll go write him an apology letter immediately!” Harry basically shouted as he ran towards the bedroom to grab some parchment and a self-inking quill.
As the two made their way onto the dance floor and generally caught up, they were unaware of all the attention they were drawing to themselves.
“We weren’t right for each other, Tori. He couldn’t accept me for who I was. Anyway... I don’t really want to talk about it” Draco said quietly, still feeling hurt about the subject.
“Mate, just tell him how you feel before it’s too late!” Ron shouted after his friend before sighing and shaking his head.
As he walked in he watched with wide eyes the tall piles of gold, the jewels, the towers of ancient books and manuscripts and couldn’t help but wonder who all this wealth belonged to.
While the rest of the Manor has looked elegant and sophisticated, this section was cold, old, dreary and fairly spooky.
“Honestly? I feel alright... Actually, I feel good. I’ve never had any relatives except for my parents...” Draco said.
“Draco is already ditching me to be with the Head Girl” an alarm sounded in Harry’s head at this words.
As he picked it up he instantly paled at the words written on the inside label of the bag: ‘property of Draco Malfoy’.
He asked himself all these questions as he walked behind James and Lily, who had already left the shop and were waiting for him outside.
Draco pinpointed this to the fact the two of them had been spending an awful lot of time together, not only talking about Draco’s sexuality but also hanging out and having fun.
Turns out one of the paparazzi had seen them going in Astoria’s apartment and kissing on the couch through the window and had snapped a few pictures.
Draco couldn’t help but feel intimidated yet at the same time turned on by his crush so blatantly staking his claim on him.
“It’s fine, Draco. Pardon me if I seem rude but why ask me? I thought Harry would be your first choice” she said.
Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore were talking to the distressed man who thought his son was dead, trying to calm him down. Students were crying and shouting.
Soon things got more heated as Astoria started to unbutton his white shirt, her hands exploring his chest.
He took a shaky breath when he saw the man sitting in the interrogation room at Azkaban Prison. Fortunately the one-way glass prevented him from being seen, however it didn’t help with the flash of anxiety that cursed through him.
Quickly he took Draco by the arm and started swimming towards the surface of the lake, not even noticing the Selkies that were swimming around him.
He looked at the ‘crab’ and saw the way it held  its four pincers close to its body, like they needed to be protected.
“You can send it to Astoria’s apartment. He’s definitely going to receive it there!” she pointed out.
“No! I want to know what’s happening to my godson, Poppy!” Snape bellowed. Dumbledore placed a calming hand on the fellow professor’s shoulder.
“Draco, Love, I’m back!” Harry called as he exited the fireplace and went searching for his boyfriend.
By dinner time the whole school knew what had happened that morning during breakfast and a few people had congratulated him about what he had said.
Draco had tried Quidditch with James but he didn’t particularly like it: everything was too dangerous and pretty boring. All you had to do was either chase/beat a ball while balancing on a flying wooden stick up in the cold (freezing) air. It didn’t sound like his ideal afternoon of fun.
“Anytime you feel like eating, no matter the time, you do so. I’m also prescribing some vitamin pills to balance out your vitamin levels. You are to take one of these pills right before dinner and before every complete meal you have” Dr. Dirwin said as she handed him a glass container with white pills in it.
While Harry had polished off his plate, Draco had barely touched his food (he had already had breakfast and wasn’t hungry) and unfortunately Harry had noticed this.
He had just returned from his appointment with Dr. Dirwin and had been feeling quite happy. At least, until now...
She shivered as all the possible stupid things her friend would do to try and separate the two Slytherins crossed her mind.
“No, I’m fourteen as well! I came along because I‘m part of the student newspaper and am here to report on the tournament” she explained.
It was partly true: he did save Cedric’s life but he certainly wasn’t brave and he was no genius. Also, Draco thought people liked to esagerate about risking his own life; sure, he had been in a bad state after the whole ordeal but he hardly considered that as difficult as what Cedric had went through.
“I don’t mind. It’s enough for me to know they care” he said and it was true. He didn’t need gifts or people there with him to express how sorry they felt for him.
“I k-know it’s wrong and-and I shouldn’t like him but I d-do and it hurts to see him with Kate. I was going to-to tell him but-but” Harry said in a rush as he sniffed and cried.
“But I think he already has. Mate, there’s a reason why he invited her to the Yule Ball and I’m telling you it’s because he likes her. I dare say she likes him too judging by what I’m seeing now” Ron nodded with his head to the pair and as Harry turned his head he saw the pair slow dancing in a tight embrace. Kate had rested her head on Draco’s shoulder.
He himself had a son, Harry, and he couldn’t imagine harming him the way this boy was hurt by his own parents.
“His parents cut off all contacts with me just after Draco’s birth. They wouldn’t let me see him at all. If I’d known back then what was going on behind the Manor’s closed doors I would have done everything possible to get that poor and innocent boy away from those monsters”
Even if they couldn’t be more, he would always be first and foremost her friend, sexual tension and all that be damned.
Lily chuckled a bit but stopped when she noticed it made the boy uncomfortable. She reminded herself that Draco isn’t used to people being friendly and kind to him. She promised herself in that moment she would love this boy like a true mother and do everything to make him feel loved.
Draco was both flattered and embarrassed at the same time. He hated being the center of the attention and couldn’t wait until he was in the privacy of the curtains of his own bed that night.
Being alone in the apartment just wasn’t the same as being with Draco. The flat was cold and too quiet.
As they were walking their hands brushed against each other. Electric waves sent off from their fingers as they quickly pulled their hands away.
He noticed Harry had been acting very strangely around him the past few months and he couldn’t help but wonder if Kate was the reason for it.
He looked at his pet bunny and, despite himself, wished someone was there with him like Sev or his parents. He knew however that he couldn’t inform any of them about what had been going on between him and Harry.
In the following months Draco did slightly improve his diet and could now manage two meals a day without trouble.
“Hurts...” came the weak answer from the person laying in the bed. The voice was wracked with pain...
“Draco! Draco, where are you?” a voice sounded from the far end of the corridor as steps could be heard echoing down the hall.
That’s right folks! Just after the first Triwizard Tournament task Hogwarts’ champion Cedric Diggory was seen embracing Draco Malfoy, a fourth year Ravenclaw student.
Draco didn’t open his eyes for fear of what he could see in her eyes. The last thing he wanted was for her to feel sorry for him and pity him.
Suddenly she felt cold and as Elizabeth opened her eyes, she found she was alone in the Head Dorms, blushing like mad.
“Duly noted, boyfriend...” Kate whispered as she sighed and got even closer to him. She threw a leg over both of his and rested her head directly in the crook of his neck. She was breathing softly on his neck and Draco, who was slightly ticklish there, couldn’t help but laugh a bit.
“You’re a very talented wizard, Draco. Your parents must be very proud of you” Mr. Diggory said. Draco immediately saddened.
Cedric was panicking: Draco was nowhere to be found and he still had no way to breathe under water for an hour. He was pacing along the dock.
