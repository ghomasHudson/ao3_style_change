Draco stumbled off his broom, and Harry caught him, steadying him. “
The Quibbler gave him very little information, though he scoured it from front to back.
Draco looked fondly reminiscent. “Banned you from ever playing again, the way I remember it. With good reason.”
Harry just nodded, his attention fixed on Shacklebolt. “We can’t let this happen, sir,” he said. “Justin used an Unforgivable! He tortured Draco, tried to
“Wait. Professor!” Pansy called. “What do I say?”
Draco gave him a look brimming over with fondness and mischief and lust. “Prove it,” he challenged. “Take me into our Room and fuck me into the mattress on the bed you made for me.”
He’d survived, Ron thought, in slow, dawning horror, but what about Hermione? Harry? His family?
Dean shrugged. “I dunno.”
Hermione mouthed in disgust.
birthday, Potter,” he pointed out.
“That’s what I thought,” she said, and turned away from him, the full, determined force of her gaze falling on Harry. He tried not to squirm under it. “What was it you said, Harry? When you whispered in Malfoy’s ear this morning?”
Harry twitched forward involuntarily. He wanted to put his hand over Draco’s, tug it down,
They followed her meekly, and Harry let his hand brush against Malfoy’s as they passed through the door. Just that brief contact left them both gasping, and McGonagall frowned at them. She directed them to sit at the desk right in front of her, where she could keep an eye on them, and handed them quills and parchment.

Draco made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a growl. “No

He let go, then, only to grasp Draco’s hand to walk into the room with him. Side by side.
him, because I love him.”
“Obviously, it is nearing exams, so any students who would like to be there for young Mr Finch-Fletchley during his trial are required to apply to their Heads of Houses for special consideration. That is all.”
“Yes,” Lucius said. He turned to Draco. “Will you come, now? We’ll fetch your mother –”
She was understandably shocked by Draco’s abrupt recovery, and the two Healers practically tripped over each other in their eagerness to find out what had happened.
Harry just stared at him stonily. Blackthorn trees had vicious thorns, and grew in dense thickets in the swampy ground just inside the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Not only that, but shade-root was fiercely coveted by quoles; nasty little creatures with no teeth but plenty of sharp claws. Harry remembered quoles featuring quite heavily in Chapter Fifteen of the
Two Death Eaters had dropped down from the trees above. One of them – Cardosa – had Adeline by the throat. Crabbe Senior threw up a shield around them.
“Minister,” Harry acknowledged, after a suitable pause, just on the edge of being rude.
, within reach. You’re safe here, but it’ll hurt you if you come out too soon. I’ll come and get you when it's done, okay? Stay
“No,” Harry said.
Malfoy’s eyes flickered away. “I don’t cry, Potter,” he said. “And I’m not afraid.”
The girls giggled.
Harry shook his head. “You didn’t betray me. You saved my life.”
way.”
She spotted him instantly. “Oh, if it isn’t my ickle baby nephew! Here to save you again, but this time he’s too late!”
Pansy took a deep breath.
“I can make you submit,” Pickering said, pleased. “I will make you mine.”
Draco shook his head.
, Potter?” Pansy gasped. “That wasn’t a shield!”
Hundreds of shining knights in armour were sailing across the Black Lake, using the tiny boats meant for the first years. Harry was waiting with Ron near the carriage-road, concealed from the trees by a turn in the road. Seamus, Neville and Ginny were sprinting down towards them from the wooden bridge.
– but, no. No, it was wrong. It was
the bond!” Draco said, in furious satisfaction. “It’s me. It’s
“Was it You-Know-Who, professor?” Seamus called out. His face was blotchy and tear-stained, and he was gripping Dean’s shoulder with white knuckles.
“Katherina is trapped by her circumstances,” Professor Burbage said.
Harry tensed. He remembered all too clearly the basilisk fang piercing his arm. The numbness, first, and then the pain as the venom spread through his body, killing him slowly, torturously, as Ginny sobbed. Not even the Cruciatus Curse had come close to that level of agony. Could he really bear that again? Could he allow himself to be stabbed, knowing the painful death that awaited him?
He pulled the covers up around Draco’s shoulders, tucking him in, and Draco murmured something. It was mostly unintelligible, but Harry heard his own name again. He left the room smiling.
“I didn’t realise you were so free with your orgasms,” Draco taunted. The unexpectedly light banter was easing nerves frayed almost to breaking point by the day's events, and he reflected that those extraordinarily green eyes really weren’t anything at all like the Dark Lord’s. Why had he thought that? “Are you saying I’m not your only lover?”
A giant lumbered over the line, but was caught by a rune in the next row. He bellowed in terror, arms windmilling as he fought unseen enemies. Spinning clumsily, he stampeded back the way he came. Death Eaters threw themselves out of his way, triggering more runes. Three simultaneous explosions, deafeningly loud.
“No!” Harry blurted. He felt his cheeks flush, embarrassed, but not embarrassed enough to take it back. “Please. I can manage.”
“So,” Draco said, pinching a piece of cake between two fingers and lifting it to Harry’s lips, “clearly it is incumbent upon me to touch you as much as possible. A burden I will endeavour to bear with equanimity.” He smiled, feeding the cake into Harry’s mouth. Then he followed it with his fingers.
. He made me believe in him, made me –” He faltered and stopped, a strangled moan escaping his lips.
“That’s hardly comparable,” Malfoy sneered. “The Dark Lord is descended from Salazar Slytherin himself.”
“Has to be Victor Krum, doesn’t it?” Ron said, picking at a nail despondently. “Who else?”
Suddenly there was noise and shouting from the other side of the rocks. Snape froze, his wand pointed at the tiny gap in the rubble.
, and being trampled by dozens of panicked students –”
Dumbledore smiled slightly. “Perhaps he is. The children’s story says the Hallows were actually created by Death, angry that the brothers had cheated him by building a bridge over a dangerous river. But who made these three powerful artefacts is, in the end, irrelevant. The moral of the story is that death comes for us all, eventually. It is not something to be feared; merely the next great adventure.”
“You have got to be KIDDING me!” Seamus said, furiously. “Harry, there’s no guarantee Malfoy will accept Dumbledore’s offer! That’s
Several (though far fewer than the first time around, at least) were addressed directly to Draco, and challenged his claim in the most insulting language possible, as if Harry were little more than a prize Crup to be won. Harry read one in disgust, and then Draco refused to let him read any more, and sat there tearing up the letters into tiny pieces with a methodical grimness before he fed them to the fire.
to take, by the way, or I would never have suggested it.”
“Yes, sir,” she agreed, standing a little taller.
Harry sucked in a breath.
. Whatever you need to do. But I’m staying right here.”
She didn’t stop to ask. Daphne Greengrass was down, her back twisted oddly, and Neville too, blood spreading out on the floor from a wound to his head. Hermione forced herself to pause, to cast a blood-clotting spell. She was afraid it was already too late for Daphne.

He stopped
“You were doing what you thought was right,” Dumbledore said. “I cannot condemn you for that, no matter how much I may abhor what you’ve done in pursuit of your goal. Not the least of which was not sharing your plan with me.”
deep in his gut overruled the need. He was overwhelmingly grateful for that. Without the protections the professors had put in place, it would have been practically impossible to listen to the only guide he had in this fucked up 'heat'.
. I mean, you’re very – but – oh Merlin.” He grinned disarmingly, and Draco resisted the urge to reach out and run his fingers down the smooth line of Potter’s jaw. “I just want – well, this is good right now. Great, I mean,” he corrected himself hastily.
“I can defend myself,” Harry snapped.
, Draco said. His hand tightened on Harry’s, and Harry knew he was smiling. For a moment, he didn’t understand. Then he remembered telling Draco about the ritual in the graveyard, when Voldemort had taken Harry’s blood to resurrect himself.
Madam Pomfrey discharged him from her care several days after that, handing him a long list of instructions, and telling him firmly to come to her with any questions or concerns.
“Your performance last week in non-verbal duelling was abysmal,” Snape said, sweeping through the door at precisely nine o’clock. He turned on his heel at the head of the classroom. “I would usually expect better from a group of students nearing the end of their sixth year, but I’ve learned not to expect anything at all from
“You fell asleep
“Technically, Dark wizards who commit crimes,” Draco said, wryly. “But I understand your confusion. If the Ministry had its way, they’d round up the lot of us. Fortunately, it’s illegal to arrest a wizard solely on the basis of being Dark, and even the Ministry can’t undo laws set down by Merlin himself. Still, that doesn’t stop the systematic harassment and discrimination, raids against law-abiding businesses and households, confiscating harmless artifacts, banning our rituals and traditions…”
“But it’s almost dinner-time,” Harry protested. “We won’t be able to sleep a wink tonight.” He stopped, realising that Draco was leaning rather heavily against him. “Draco?” There was a very soft snore, and Madam Pomfrey chuckled, drawing the curtain behind her as she left. “Never mind, then,” Harry muttered, settling Draco more comfortably in his arms.
Harry stared at her.
Dumbledore was quiet for a moment.
“But Riddle opened the Chamber using Parseltongue,” Harry pointed out. “That’s one of Slytherin’s gifts, right?”
Alpha – not to mention the books –”
Pansy looked at him in surprise, but he was focused entirely on the Weasley girl, his face set in a sympathetic mask. Ginerva smiled at him in grateful surprise, and Blaise’s motivation suddenly became crystal clear. Daphne glanced at Pansy with a small smirk, and Theo rolled his eyes. Vince and Greg didn’t even blink.
Under his breath, he muttered two
“They go to trial tomorrow,” McGonagall said. “Whether or not they will be convicted is another matter. With corruption rife in the Ministry, I’m afraid there is no guarantee we will recieve anything approaching justice. Now, off you go, Mr Potter. Professor Dumbledore is waiting.”
Pansy nodded. “So you all went after Finch-Fletchley? Does Potter know?”
The Death Eaters started screaming out lighting spells. “
Draco winced. “It’s Dumbledore’s theory –”
Harry blushed, and George, who never strayed far from his twin’s side these days, chuckled. “I reckon you’re right, Freddie.”
He couldn't care less what anyone else thought of him. But he could not
“But we don’t even know where any of the other Horcruxes
He melted into Draco happily, content to just enjoy being used, being stretched and held tight and pumped full of come, his own cock not forgotten, exactly, but not necessary for his Alpha’s pleasure.
Harry stood at the window of the DADA classroom, gazing out at the clear, still night. The moon hung heavy on the horizon, white-bright and glowing, its pure, cold brilliance reflected in the quiet water of the lake below.
Draco shrugged slightly. “Less than a fortnight ago, I would have said he lacked even the ability to be
They came to an end in the tunnel, with a small ladder leading up to what looked like a drain cover. Seamus made an elaborate ‘you first’ gesture at it. She acceded, climbing up the ladder as gracefully as if it was something she did every day. She handled her robes around her so skilfully that Seamus didn’t even catch a glimpse of her ankles, which was oddly disappointing. He missed her ankles.
Draco didn’t look at her, burning a long strip down the middle of his canopy. “I take it, since you’re here, that Blaise changed his mind?”
, then
? McGonagall must have been mad as fire.”
Harry looked away. He knew. Oh, he’d doubted, in those dungeons beneath Malfoy Manor. Believed Draco’s cruel words. Believed that he’d been playing both sides, and that in the end, he’d chosen his mother over Harry. It was impressive; that ability to wrap lies in half-truths, to bury the real truths so deep down that even Voldemort had been deceived.
“You can barely perform a simple cleaning charm non-verbally, let alone a complex Transfiguration from an object of smaller to greater mass,” Malfoy said, suspiciously. “And wandlessly, too. You’ve been behind in the practical aspect of almost every class this year, even Defence. Unless you’ve been deliberately hiding your true abilities.”
“The Death Eater at the Ministry,” Draco said. “He has a daughter here. A first-year. Half-blood. I didn’t know he was a Death Eater until yesterday; the Cardosa family have a long pureblood pedigree, but the last several generations have married half-bloods and Muggleborns. They were neutral during the last war.”
He twisted his hands together, and then frowned at the odd, crusty sensation. He looked down to find his hands and arms covered in blood, dried and flaking. There were dark, rusty circles on his jeans, splatter up his front, and the new, summer robes Pansy had bought him were ruined. Revolted, he scrabbled for his wand, casting
“I love you,” he said again. “You’ve changed everything. Do you realise that? My whole

told Snape that he was using Potter to gain information for the Dark Lord. Even if he had suspected a lie, a loyal Death Eater would never have taken the risk. To speak to Potter again … that was tantamount to a declaration of allegiance. That was tantamount to
Annoyed, Draco said, “You can’t draw on anything if the bond’s closed. Or long-distance. Have you even tried that? No, of course not, or I'd have noticed. You haven’t even tried to use the bond to share
Draco growled, flipping them over in the air. “Don’t let us fall,” he warned, guiding him down onto his cock, slow and gentle, and then, when he realised how slick-wet Harry was, gushing out of him again in readiness for his Alpha's cock, in one smooth, hard thrust.
“Oh, fuck yeah! That’s
Pansy was on her knees next to them, her face expressionless. She was staring at right at Draco, and Harry wondered what she’d seen.
, and then he tore your
Harry smiled. “That too.”
Harry swallowed.
Harry looked at Justin.
She looked so surprised at this that she almost toppled backwards. “But Harry, every wizarding household has at least one nest of gerblins! They can be a little annoying when they’re fighting in your attic space, but no one really
He led her into his private room, past Vince and Greg snoring over their homework.
“Hermione?”
Draco shook his head. “There’s nothing to –”
He’d never blamed Draco for Dobby’s death. Harry had had more than enough power to Apparate through Malfoy Manor’s wards without a wand, but he’d waited too long, and Draco had been so badly injured – taunting his Aunt Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters to draw their attention away from Harry – that he’d expended most of his magic just trying to keep his Alpha alive.
Draco rolled up onto his knees, straddling Harry’s waist. His eyes were bright. “Mine,” he said, bending to kiss him, and Harry opened up for him, smiling as he heard
Pansy watched Bellatrix. There was a reason the Dark Lord had made her his second-in-command. She might be insane, but she was also highly intelligent. She was barking orders, and the Death Eaters were scrambling to reveal the runes, or find a path through. It wouldn’t be long before they found the carriage road. And once they realised it was a bottleneck, the Anti-Apparition wards would be next. Unless, of course, Bellatrix was already working on them, too. She probably was; Pansy wouldn’t underestimate her.
Pansy flinched.
Draco didn’t need to reach far. Without the lodestones to anchor them, thousands of loose threads were unravelling. The wards, all the spells and charms that made Hogwarts what it was. They were far too powerful for him to touch, but he could follow the smaller threads. His fingers found a rich vein of magic – almost like a physical support beam – and the hair on the back of his neck prickled.
Draco hummed thoughtfully. “So do you, Potter. And very well, I might add.”
Harry frowned. “Charlie brought reinforcements from the Ministry. If there were more people willing to help, wouldn’t they already be here?”
Hermione sank back down onto the bench gratefully, realising that the Headmaster was right. “It happened very quickly, sir,” she said. “We saw Justin being pulled aside by the two men from the Ministry. I don’t know what they told him, but it looked like bad news –”
The flaws in that logic were glaring, but he’d been too young, too new to this world, to see them then. He didn’t have that excuse anymore. He’d watched his father and Sirius cruelly bully a young Snape in Snape's memories. He’d met Peter Pettigrew, heroic Gryffindor, turned coward and traitor and murderer. He’d watched the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (a Hufflepuff and an Auror) turn against the people, favouring power over truth, arresting innocents so he could be seen to be ‘winning’ the war.
“Ohhh,” Dean breathed. “She’s really got you by the balls, huh? Knows exactly which carrot to dangle.”
Draco smirked slightly. “You really do have a flair for the dramatic, Potter.”
need an Alpha. Your heat will last for several days, and your need will only grow stronger.” Harry nodded; he could feel the truth of that in his bones. “I can offer you only this: Professor McGonagall is in the process of inviting any male Alphas who are interested and of age to congregate in the infirmary outside. One of them may be – will very
“Invisibility potions next week, apparently,” Harry said. “The better question is, why did
Seamus was disturbed, and yet also a little relieved. “He forced you?”
Scrimgeour looked discomfited. “Release him!” he snapped, irritably.
“Come on, sweetheart.”
Robards scowled. “I haven’t forgotten. I also haven’t forgotten that he’s the son of a convicted Death Eater. Lucius attacked
For a moment, Harry thought she was talking about Draco and Lucius, but the way she was smiling at him... A lump formed in his throat, and he had to blink rapidly to keep the tears at bay. “Mrs Malfoy –”
Draco to love him. No matter the cost to Draco.
“Harry,” Dumbledore said, sharply.
Weasley frowned, but Granger elbowed him and said, “We’ll grab some snacks, too. Harry, love? Can we get you anything?”
All eyes turned.
“And he’d have been wrong,” Pansy said. Draco slipped an arm around her waist automatically. “Leave off, Blaise.”
Pickering looked at him shrewdly. “Or I could kill him.”
“I just have one condition,” he said.
Shock slammed through the courtroom. Voices rose in a crescendo, people straining their necks to get a look down at the bench where Harry and Draco sat. Justin was scowling, and Umbridge’s face twisted sourly.
“KEEP GOING!”
. “But I think I’ve loved you ever since that duel in second year, when you spoke Parseltongue to my snake.”
“I love you,” he whispered, into Draco’s mouth.
Harry said, “Thanks,” and pulled a hand out of his pocket to push the curtain aside.
A soul-bond, fated from birth. A prophecy, binding Potter and the Dark Lord together. A Horcrux clinging to Potter’s soul, which meant that he had to die in order for the Dark Lord to be defeated. Their Mage abilities, raw and untested; impossibly powerful, and impossibly dangerous. The Dark Lord, planning to use Potter’s power in the Dark Moon Ritual to take over the wizarding world. Her own Shakespearean plot, pitting Potter and Draco against each other in order to save Draco’s life… and in the process, allowing them to develop feelings for each other that could only end in disaster.
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, into his shoulder. “It’s bloody
for Potter, of course.”
McGonagall frowned. “You’re saying you interacted with it both physically and magically, and yet you believe it was an illusion? Why?”
He walked down the steps and over to the cupboards that lined the entire right-hand wall. Harry followed him reluctantly, and Snape waited until he was right up close before pulling the first door open. Clouds of dust billowed out, and Harry sneezed at once, violently.
Harry sighed in contentment, and fell asleep.
for me, Harry. You had always hated me. It was never like that for me.”
Seamus frowned. Everyone knew Ginny had carried a torch for Harry since first year, but he’d put that down to hero worship. Once Harry had come out, she’d seemed content to start dating other boys. “Okay,” he said, “so fight for her. Harry’s gay. You’re already way ahead of him in points there.”
One way or another, he had to end this.
Unfortunately, while Hermione had managed to seal the other six passages with no problems, the Whomping Willow was taking much longer than they’d expected. Apparently the tree had developed a resistance to pressing the knot at the base of the trunk, and Hermione was trying (and so far, failing) to figure out a way to produce the same effect with a spell.
There were screams, shouts of effort and anger, the concussions of explosions.
“Not yet,” Draco said, though he wriggled a little as if he couldn't help himself. Harry had to restrain himself from rolling Draco back over and kissing him senseless. But they hadn’t had sex since their break-up, and he was determined to let Draco set the pace. “All right, up you get,” Draco said, firmly. “I've got cake and presents.”
Draco smiled. “Pansy has a small talent for Divination, and a huge amount of determination to see me safe. She’s been doing some scrying into my future. There were so many paths that led to death and ruin. But I chose
“Justin Finch-Fletchley?” Pansy said, looking over at the Hufflepuffs. They made up the majority of the class, of course; Hufflepuffs as a rule gravitated towards the softer subjects like Divination, Care of Magical Creatures, and Herbology. Justin was sitting with Hannah Abbott and Michael Corner. “The whole school knows the intimate details of every single one of Justin’s ‘conquests’. You’re saying he really dated Harry Potter and kept quiet about it?”
It was him. No, not him. Future-him? Just – standing here, outside the bubble, watching him.
Harry almost dashed straight out the door after his Alpha, but he was still mostly naked. Snarling in frustration, he stopped to throw on a pair of trousers and a shirt. As an afterthought, he cast a Patronus to summon Professor Snape to Ravenclaw tower, where most of the volunteers, including Fabien Barbary, were rooming.
“I’m fine,” Draco said. “I just – need you to s-stay, for a bit.”
. But we can’t just stop living our lives because of
“Yeah,” Harry said, softly. “You are.”
Harry frowned, suddenly wishing that he could explain everything. But Dumbledore insisted on keeping his secrets, and that made it hard to trust that he would be taken seriously. If there was some reciprocation, maybe… “I’m not going into this blind,” he said. “I know Draco is a Death Eater.”
“Bill,” Weasley interjected grimly. “Neville.”
, dammit. It was time for action, not self-pity.
Malfoy’s jaw worked. “It might be a start. Omegas are supposed to obey their Alphas.”
Pansy stared down at Draco. His chest wasn’t moving anymore, but that didn’t mean anything. He was just breathing very slowly. She fumbled for a pulse, but her hands were shaking too badly. She couldn’t find one. He was limp, his lips an unpleasant shade of blue.
, the spell to ease pain and splint broken limbs. He realised Draco’s other leg was broken in several places, as well as the fingers of his left hand. The broken bones slowly began to shift back into place under Snape’s ministrations, and Malfoy relaxed out of his stiff curl, but he didn’t wake up.
to prevent that. Whatever it took.”
Harry couldn’t argue with that. “I’m going to fuck you now,” he decided, grabbing Draco’s tunic and yanking it over his head. Draco made an unhappy noise, smoothing his hair back into place. Harry ignored him, admiring the flat plane of Draco’s abdomen, the way his flushed cock jutted up from the nest of blond curls.
It wasn’t one of the spells in their homework this week, but of course Harry knew it. He struggled against the fog of sleep, waiting until Malfoy was standing over him before he muttered in quick succession, “
Acknowledgement to the awesome community world-building project, the Santharian Dream, which inspired my elemental magic abilities :)
“Not bad,” he said, glad of the excuse to move even further into Pansy’s personal space. She just tilted her head, a knowing smile playing at the edges of her mouth. Seamus suddenly felt flushed and warm all over. “You were right, I think Harry might actually have a bit of a thing for Malfoy.” He shook his head, still amazed. “I honestly would never have guessed.”

“You deny having feelings for him, then?” Snape said. “What exactly
“Yes, professor,” Harry said, relieved. He hesitated. “Can I ask – the Nightmare Curse? Do they know who did it?”
There were more people sitting in the stands than Harry had anticipated.
his enemies the tools to hurt him.
“Time to go!” Seamus shouted, dragging him up. Harry stumbled into a run. Seamus and Dean were throwing spells over their shoulders, and the people in the battlements were firing thick and furious over their heads.
Ron threw an alarmed glance around the hallway, grabbed her arm and pulled her into a nearby alcove. Harry followed them, not because he was particularly interested, but because – well, he didn’t have anything better to do, did he?
It was some kind of protective enchantment, or shield. He could feel Hermione’s magical signature pulsing through it.
“Then you’ll have it by the end of the day,” Narcissa promised. She frowned. “I do hope you’re not planning on doing anything dangerous with it, though, sweetheart.”
Draco didn’t reply. Harry was disappointed, but not discouraged.
Harry was fidgeting in his seat. Hermione didn’t think he was even
Ron sighed. “Yeah. You’re right, honey.” Hermione’s breath caught at the careless endearment, and she ducked her head, smiling. “Look, mate,” Ron said, leaning forward. “You’ve been moping around all week, and that’s not fair on either of you. You don’t muck around with soul magic.”
; more so, even, than the night Malfoy had fallen asleep in his arms.
It was as if Voldemort had never come to Hogwarts. For a moment, he even wondered if it had all be some kind of horrible fever dream.
“Thank you,” she said.
Pansy relaxed. It wasn’t a declaration one way or the other, but it was something. “I think the Headmaster already suspects him,” she said. “But he can’t, or won’t, offer him a way out, and I need someone who
“You’re family,” Ron agreed.
“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, softly.
“Why is she here, Ron?” Harry asked. “Why did St Mungo’s just throw them all out? Where are the Healers? Why haven’t they come back to help?”“Didn’t you hear?” Ginny said. She was across the room from them, carefully tracing her wand in a series of loops over a pale-faced girl with auburn curls. She looked as exhausted as Harry felt, but she barely looked up, her eyebrows drawn together in grim determination. Harry thought he recognised the girl; a Gryffindor in Ginny’s year. Alexia something. “St Mungo’s has declared a state of emergency. There’s been attacks, all over the country, all at the same time. Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley, the Millenium Bridge... St Mungo’s can’t cope with all the wounded. They’re asking anyone with space and any kind of medi-wizardry training to take those stable enough for transport through the Floo network.”
Potter’s arm slid around his waist, pulling him in close, up against that hard, strong body.
now, and I won’t let you be hurt. That would be detrimental to my own happiness.”
Of course, even if it was, that didn’t mean the Dark Lord wouldn’t still torture him for Draco’s failure.

“Yes!” Pansy said. “Yes,
they can save him. Really. There’s nothing to worry about.”
“I don’t suppose you could endeavour to breathe a little quieter, Potter?”
“And you didn’t see or hear Justin during the time he was outside?” Madam Primrose continued.
“Oh, hell no!” Harry protested. “We still don’t know if he can be trusted!”
“I thought that was impossible,” Granger said. “It’s one of the laws of Magic. Immutable, unchangeable. That wizards can’t take magic from other wizards.”
Ron dared to look down at his injuries, and winced. He felt woozy.
She gave him a wry look. “I know what you’re thinking. And, no. They’re more than welcome to each other. I don’t have any regrets. Other than Blaise, and – and breaking up with you.”
, please fuck me, Draco –”
“You saved us,” Madam Pomfrey said, simply. “How are you feeling?”
Hermione was late to lunch that day.
“No. The two potions you drank were diagnostic only. They allowed me to more closely examine your magic, and interpret your cores in a meaningful way. That’s all.”
Draco nodded. There was almost no hope of that, and they both knew it. But she was a trained Auror, and, apparently, part of Dumbledore’s infamous Order. She would do her duty and protect Harry, and that was all he could really care about right now. “Left here,” he repeated.
was never going to be a willing patsy in Pansy’s oh-so-clever scheme.”
Harry shrieked and bucked, and Draco laughed, grabbing his hips to still him. “Going to take my time,” he taunted, gently. “Remember, Potter? You didn’t think you’d get off that easily, did you?”
“Water,” Voldemort said. “Tears of the child.”

Thank you to everyone leaving comments and kudos! They make my day :)
Harry’s eyes opened wide in sudden, terrified realisation. He tried to pull back, but Draco just grabbed his hips and held on, bobbing his head deeper. Harry held still, heart hammering against his ribs. “Draco –”
Bellatrix whirled out of the way, laughing.

He finished with a flourish, re-capped his ink pot, and measured the parchment length just to be sure. 17 inches. Perfect.
“This!” Harry said, waving a hand around at the Great Hall. There were so many eyes on him it felt like second year all over again. Or, Merlin forbid, fourth year. “I thought everyone saw me in Hogsmeade with Draco.”
After a great deal of back and forth, and yelling about traps and traitors and letting a snot-nosed kid give them orders, they were all overruled by Dumbledore. Kingsley, Moody and Tonks returned to the Ministry to begin preparations. They had agreed that infiltrating under the cover of darkness would have the greatest likelihood of success, as well as giving those affected by the Scorched Earth spell time to recover.
“Don’t call me that,” Draco said, but without much force. He shook his head. “This was a bad idea.”
The Death Eaters destroyed it almost instantly. He fell back, the pain making him stumble. Rowle lifted his wand, a predatory grin on his face. Fred made a split-second decision, launching himself forward.
Pansy gasped, spinning around. Her face drained of colour. Her expression was one of utter, abject horror. Clearly she’d forgotten – or never known – that Malfoy was standing right behind her. Seamus’ eyes bugged out.
“Sorry,” Harry said, unapologetically.
. It was a tail.
Pansy’s throat closed. “Did you See that?”
,” Harry whined, deliberately.
Then, finally, the little girl glanced up. “All right?”

Madam Pomfrey drew in a sharp breath. There was a loaded silence. The adults in the viewing chamber exchanged significant looks. Hermione’s hand rose to cover her mouth.
. How would that look, failing his task, Snape taking over –”
“Professor Lupin?” Ginerva said.
Justin stared back at him, his brown eyes dull, curly brown hair tangled and matted. Harry remembered how it had felt, pushing his fingers through that thick, curly hair as they made love; how Justin had kissed away Harry’s tears as he took him for the first and only time. How, the very next morning, Justin had turned his face away from Harry’s good morning kiss.
“Stop fighting me, Potter!”
But the Dark Lord truly trusted no one, and the Order had snatched his
“Your father?” Harry said, his eyes wide.
“Suicide!” Alastor barked. Jenkins jumped, his eyes widening.
Harry nodded silently.
Harry pressed an affectionate kiss to the corner of Draco’s lips. “When it really matters,” he agreed, “you know I will. I do. But the name of the idiot who tried to assault me doesn’t matter, not compared to
Harry’s heart stopped. “
Draco bowed, low. A small smile appeared on his lips. “I may have a suggestion in that regard, my lord.”
Draco paused to consider. “Three times,” he corrected himself. “The rose bushes, the ward to guard our retreat during the Invasion, and before that, the moment I opened the Vanishing Cabinet. I knew all I had to do was ask, and you would keep your word to protect me.”
I don’t want to feel like this – I don’t want my first time to be
“No, professor,” Harry said, trying to project as much sincerity as possible at her. Malfoy echoed him quietly, eyes on the ground, adjusting his robes with small, spasmodic twitches.
Draco chose to ignore that. “It’s not possible.”
He yelped, flinging his arms around Draco’s neck and wrapping his legs tighter around Draco’s waist.
“Where it concerns us all,” Pansy said, quietly.

Harry grinned, and swiped two sundaes before he handed them over. He settled next to Draco on the picnic blanket they’d brought along, passing the chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts to Draco. He kept the strawberry and peanut butter for himself.
Harry’s mouth filled with bile. How could one body sustain that much damage and survive?

Harry wasn’t with him.
“Some are more oblivious than others,” Pansy said, turning away from the touching little scene they’d all seen Blaise enact before, too many times to count. “But then, what else can we expect from Gryffindors?”
Carrow retaliated with a wandless Leg-Locker Curse. Draco danced out of the way, just as his own spell hit. Carrow’s tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He worked his mouth, furious.
Harry’s eyebrows rose. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“I’m sorry, professor, I – I appreciate your faith in me, but I don’t think I can,” Harry said, helpessly. “Draco’s cut me off. I’m on my own now. Besides, I don’t think that kind of spell is one of my ‘gifts’.”
yesterday.”
,” the man said.
Relieved and a little confused, Harry reached out for him again. This time, Draco allowed the embrace. “But you’re all right now?” he asked.
, Parkinson!” he gasped, his heart trying to beat out of his chest.
“The Mind Healers are going to be busy with us all for years,” Pansy sighed, in agreement. “Are you taking the train back to London? I know your parents have taken your little brothers and sisters to Ireland. When they hear about this, they’ll want you with them.”
Harry's mouth dropped open in horror.
“Voldemort cast the Killing Curse at me,” Harry explained, apologetically. “You kept me alive, but the Horcrux – well, I woke up and it was gone.”
Draco tried to scramble up, looking alarmed, but Harry pinned him in place. The dragon, disturbed from its nest on his lap, flew off with an irritated huff to sulk on the dresser. “Don’t you dare, Potter!”
“Die,” Harry pointed out, rubbing his chest. “In the future. I’m sorry. Merlin, I’m
Harry frowned, and knocked on the wall. It opened within moments, but Malfoy just took the proffered dinner and dessert (banoffee pie, this time, as well as fresh cream cakes; an apology for the previous night), and shut the door again without a word. His eyes were red-rimmed and fatigued; he didn’t look Harry in the eye, and didn’t even notice that Crabbe wasn’t at his post.
“Actually, he’s right, Mr Malfoy,” Madam Pomfrey said. “There has long been shown to be a correlation between certain character traits and the location of magical centres. Mr Potter, your core is located in the centre of your chest. Your heart. It’s associated with compassion and love, an ability to love deeply and without reservation. It also indicates a strong connection with the air and wind; a free spirit.”
Dawlish looked horrified. “You sent my partner
“Be ready,” Draco warned. There was no time to weave a ward on a different alcove. They had to help the others.

Draco looked at him curiously. “All right. I’ll wait for you in Slytherin.”

“That was Parseltongue,” Draco said.

Draco shook his head. “You don’t believe that. You told me yourself, you lost someone you loved, and you’ve regretted it ever since. What Harry did… I don’t know if there’s a future for us. But I
know you’re not the out-of-control monster they’re making you out to be. It was just a mistake. And I’ll stand by you no matter what, Harry.”
“Is she up to leaving the infirmary?” Harry asked.
someone else… well, she was glad he was suffering.
She waved her wand, and the scarves fell, vanishing before they hit the floor. The other students startled, looking at them in surprise, and Pansy realised there had been a subtle Notice-Me-Not Charm woven through Trelawney’s ward. Clever.

Elphias startled. “Calm yourself, my dear,” he murmured. Of course, he echoed the sentiment. Dolores had betrayed them all. After that debacle at Hogwarts two years ago, she’d been extremely lucky to get her job back. Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic was a privileged position. And then she’d turned her wand on the Minister, on
Harry, with his impossible hair and those pathetic green eyes. Harry, who had pursued him, held him, kissed him, loved him… and broken up with him.
Draco had no idea what a sitting duck was, but he lowered her quickly. A glance over his shoulder showed Millicent had Rowle well under control. She was sitting on his chest, wand pointed at his nose, teeth bared in a smile that would have had even the Dark Lord quailing. He turned back to Granger, relaxing. “I had you shielded.”
Harry grimaced. “Yeah.” The Horcruxes were almost as dangerous as Voldemort himself; perhaps even more so. After all, the ring had defeated Dumbledore, the strongest wizard Harry knew. The wizard even
– belongs to me, by law. He has no right to vote, no right to seek medical care without my consent, no right to schooling, to work, to money or property of his own. I could chain him up in the Manor’s dungeon and torture him every day for the rest of his life, and no one in the wizarding world could legally intervene.”
“Maybe,” Hermione said, but she looked hesitant. “And I’d normally be the first to say we should. But you’ve been telling him about Malfoy all year, and Dumbledore’s done
Draco woke screaming. Flashes of his dreams – Greyback standing over his mother, Cardosa’s smile, his hands – paraded through his mind. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead, and bile filled his mouth. “Harry, Harry!

cares about Malfoy. She won’t defect until he’s safe, too.”
“Poppy, such a bond is unheard of,” Dumbledore said.
Harry nodded, swallowing. “Will I know, sir? When the time is right?”
Harry panicked. “No.
“You underestimate yourself, Mr Potter,” she said, with a fleeting smile. Her mouth thinned again, sweat beading on her brow. “You are the Chosen One. The wizarding world believes in you. If you call, they will come.”
The Slytherins lingered at the back as everyone else crowded around him, laughing and crying.
She slipped into the seat between Harry and Ron.
Professor McGonagall eyed him severely. “I expect better from you, Mr Potter. And
Professor Flitwick was the first to push himself up. He made his way unsteadily over to a group of crying Hufflepuffs. Several older students staggered to their feet, following his lead. More appeared from behind Dumbledore, looking relieved; that it was all over, or that they hadn’t been caught up in the curse. Both, probably. Harry imagined it would have been a good day to be a slow eater.
The guardian snake blinked at him, and its next words were in Parseltongue. “You speak our language. You are a descendent of Slytherin?”

Nothing in the world could have prepared him for how this felt. Being

“Flattered, I’m sure.”
He stared up at her. And then he was flushing bright red and scrambling to his feet, blurting out an apology so quickly he was stumbling over his own words. “It was me, not you,” he said, more coherently. “Merlin, Hermione! Don’t apologise. It was me. I was stupid, and drunk, and I didn’t mean any of it.”
Malfoy threaded their fingers together and squeezed gently. “You
But, in the end, topping had come naturally to him. And it had been
Of course, he couldn’t destroy the stone. Dumbledore had already tried that, and failed. But he also couldn’t risk it falling into Voldemort’s hands.
Draco hummed. “I’m not sure,” he said, skimming down the page. “Perhaps Jeremiah didn’t know about that particular gift. There’s a lot about manipulating storms. Facilitating the return of living things to their ‘natural state’… I think that must be how you were able to remove my scars from Finch-Fletchley’s attack, even though they were beyond any Healer’s ability to remove. Not to mention my potions addiction.”
Harry felt his eyes fill. “That Cloak was my father’s.”
“I blew up my uncle’s sister the summer hols before third year,” Harry said.
A sharp rap on the wall outside made him jump, and he whirled, almost tripping in his haste.
“He’s not going to find out. And you can

inside him. Living off his soul, like cancer, or poison ivy, slowly strangling to death everything that was essentially Harry. Eating away his soul, piece by piece.
Pansy went white. “
“Speaking of freak events,” Harry frowned, suddenly reminded of his accidental magic, “I wanted to ask you something.” He glanced down at her plate again. “Just – Hermione, are you okay?”
Draco smirked. “He always was quick off the mark, wasn’t he? A bit like you, this morning.”
Justin just sneered at him.
Harry’s face fell. He took a step back.
Harry frowned. “What is that? What’s a – an Omega?”
! You’re mine, Harry! What do you think will happen if word gets out that I don’t defend my mate? It’ll be a fucking free-for-all –”
“The tides are turning again,” Theo mused. He was watching Sadie Atwood and her group, who had their heads together, talking in low, intent voices. “This is going to cost us.”
So many branches, so many paths, and they were so tangled, shifting back and forth to different points on the same branch, he wasn’t always sure where they diverged. Sometimes he saw almost the same scene, in a different path, and he started to lose track. So much darkness, and pain, and suffering. So much death, and all resulting from
“Always gratifying to hear,” a voice drawled, and Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry from behind, propping his chin on Harry’s shoulder. Harry startled, and then relaxed.
He opened his mouth, and then shut it again, looking angry and defensive, and utterly miserable.
“My father would beg to differ,” Malfoy said.
“And do you think Draco Malfoy, son of a Death Eater and the scion of a line that has been Dark for
Hermione frowned. “So what are you going to do?”
She stared at him. “As
Pansy inclined her head. “Thank you.”
Draco looked at him. “Are you really the only one who can kill him?”
“Mm,” Malfoy agreed, not really paying attention. His finger was on Harry’s lips, now, and Harry was gazing at him in something very much like adoration.
Draco leaned back on his elbows, shaking his head at her. “Go away, you daft bint. Let me sleep.”
By the time Snape had set up the wards, and Harry had finished off the three different, equally vile potions, he was desperate. His trousers were damp and uncomfortably sticky when he pulled them back on, and he squirmed, itchy and turned on in equal measure.
The girl was gasping for breath now, tears leaking down her temples. Voldemort trailed an idle finger through the tracks. Dumbledore’s eyes narrowed.
The prefects began herding everyone into groups and up the stairs. Professor Vector was assisting Madam Pomfrey in treating those students who had been injured, while Professors Sprout and Burbage gently revived those who had been Stunned.

Harry blinked. “You’re really going to get married? To a
Harry nodded, but he didn’t return the sentiment. He couldn’t. Not anymore.
“More prattle than actual help, honestly,” Pansy said, injecting a little irritation into her tone. “I don’t know why I bother.”
He was obviously pleased with himself, and Harry felt an involuntary thrill of arousal. The strength of his reaction shocked him, and he took a quick step backwards. Draco’s eyes narrowed, focusing inevitably on the rather – prominent evidence.

Draco just raised his chin defiantly, waiting until Snape turned again, impatient for his reply. He met the dark eyes with all the assurance of the scion of the Malfoy line. “I would do anything to save my mother’s life, professor,” he said. “
She’d never apologised. Never told him –
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “So we really only have one choice: fight the Dark Lord and possibly win our freedom, or fight
Parkinson was flouting pureblood tradition too, it seemed. She wore a gorgeous red Muggle dress, dark hair swept up off perfect white shoulders into a French twist. She looked flawless, cold. But that was just her mask. After three weeks of dating Blaise, Ginny was well aware of the ubiquitious Slytherin mask.
,” Dumbledore said firmly, and flicked his wand. Malfoy was torn away from him, flying to slam up against the wall near the door, pinned there like a butterfly to the drawing board.
Draco sighed and sat back. “You really want to know?”

He dreamed of two lovers dueling on a dance-floor. But it wasn’t a dance-floor, it was a chessboard, and they stood back-to-back, and fought off two armies together.
“Hey, Bill,” Ron greeted. “Not that I’m not glad you’re here, but why
“They’re going to be all right,” Seamus murmured. He reached out to her, and Pansy let him fold his arms around her. She closed her eyes, pressing her head to his chest.
at this present moment.
It was a perilous climb down to the Atrium, but Charlie was a dragon-tamer. He knew some pretty nifty spells for dangerous climbing.
Harry watched him go, observing the way his shoulders tensed as he neared Ron and Hermione. Once upon a time, he never would have noticed that. Or, if he had, he would have assumed it was simple dislike, or maybe that Draco was readying himself for another round of barbed insults. He knew now that it was fear. Fear of a threat to his task, his mother, his life. It made Harry wonder when Draco had stopped being afraid of him.
“Well, blow me off the back of a broom,” Rosmerta muttered.
Harry felt sick. It was his worst nightmare; belonging to someone who didn’t love him. He’d had fifteen years of it with the Dursleys, and the idea of the rest of his
His mind caught on a memory.
Pansy looked relieved. “You’ll come with me to Hogsmeade?”
Harry shot her a furious look of betrayal. Was she
“Just so.”
It was the most romantic milieu he could think of, and Harry was quite proud of the effect. But now he was here, with Malfoy, he was filled with sudden, paralysing doubt.
“Trying?” Harry said, slipping his hands around to cup Draco’s arse, pulling him flush against his body. Draco’s breath stuttered. “Only trying?”
Lucius Malfoy stood at the edge of the clearing in the Forbidden Forest. The Dark Lord was toying idly with the young Unspeakable, Hestia. Dumbledore was trussed up and Silenced. Lucius suspected the Dark Lord wasn’t even particularly interested in the information he could provide anymore.

you torturing me.”
Fred was groaning as he came to. George shushed him. He couldn’t risk taking his hand off his wand, so he nudged his knee up against Fred’s instead. “George,” Fred rasped. “
Harry stared at him blankly. “
“I Apparated us through the Anti-Apparition wards, remember?” Potter said, glancing at Draco.
“Draco,” Harry warned.
” Draco screamed, and Harry found himself cut off, left with only what he had already managed to draw through Draco. It didn’t matter. It was enough. But Draco forced him around, shaking him. “It’s NOT REAL!” he cried. Harry blinked, struggling to focus on him. “It’s a curse! Whatever you’re seeing,
She brightened instantly. “So Harry and Malfoy –”
Bill was yelling from inside some kind of enormous cage, his eyes fixed on someone twisting upside-down in the air. Their
They both nodded. It had caused quite a stir at the start of the year. Donald Parkinson was the only Death Eater captured by Ministry Aurors over the summer who had agreed to talk, in return for the safety of his wife and daughter. His defection was public knowledge. What had happened afterwards was not.
Draco jerked back. McGonagall was standing by the open door, a scandalised expression on her face. Behind her was Dumbledore, seated in an armchair near the desk, and standing next to him with an incredulous scowl on his face…
taught about Wild Magic. You just don’t take any of the right subjects. Magical Theory, or Ancient Runes, or Arithmancy. But that’s beside the point. I’ve never heard of anyone older than twelve using the Wild Magic without a ritual and incantations, or a runic circle, or some other magical means. You don’t even use a wand.”
Harry sighed and shifted on the bench next to him, and Draco closed his eyes.
What he saw took his breath away.
Harry held up his hands. “Okay, sorry. Forget I asked.”
~ The End ~
Pansy sucked in a breath. “No,” she breathed. “Oh
He startled at the touch of that familiar hand, eyes flying open.
Draco thrust out his hands. Suddenly Rowle was moving in slow motion, his face twisting in rage as he tried to understand what had happened to him. His curse hit Harry’s shield, and bounced back, hitting him square in the groin. The howl that emerged from that slowly-opening mouth was inhuman.
“Those weren’t ‘harmless artifacts’ your father got rid of, in second year,” Harry pointed out.
rather than find another solution. Do they?”
Dumbledore looked down at the wand in his hand. The Patronus Charm was difficult magic, and his power was fading. The Elder wand was beginning to distrust him, doubting his mastery over it. It would betray him, soon, as the children’s story warned. “
, Harry thought savagely, as a short, squat woman in a bright pink cardigan hurried in through the main entrance. She paused, smiling, as every eye in the courtroom turned to her.
Draco grimaced. “Yes, ma’am.”
Malfoy gasped, body arching up into Harry’s, eyes fluttering closed almost as if against his will. His mouth opened wider as Harry ravaged him with tongue and teeth. He whimpered when Harry pulled away at last, and Harry used his other hand to cup Malfoy’s cock through his robes.
Harry stiffened. “What?”
“You mean if they defected?” Dumbledore peered at him over his half-moon spectacles. “What makes you think he would accept such an offer?”
Draco just shrugged.
“But the bond’s closed,” Harry said, stupidly. “How –?”
Harry stared at him in astonishment. “But –
He was waking up.
He didn’t want to die like this; not with this terrible gulf separating him from the love of his life.
anything?” she cried, slamming her mirror down on the table.
“Not the Killing Curse, you idiots!” Bellatrix screamed. “You’ll hit the Potter boy!”
“Draco…” Harry said. He opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, torn between continuing to argue his case, and assuring Draco that there was nothing to forgive, he
“Fuck me,” Draco said, arching his back. “And maybe I will.” Harry rolled his hips, and Draco gasped. “Potter, please!”
“Oh,” Harry said, and then felt a little guilty that his first reaction was – bloody hell, not right before the game! “Maybe it was just nerves?” he said, hopefully. “He has been throwing up a lot lately.”
you?” She squinted at him. “On second thought –”
Draco’s face crumpled. “I promised I wouldn’t do that.”
Harry glanced reluctantly at the two-page spread, one whole page of which was a picture of his face. Large letters spelt out, ‘HARRY POTTER TELLS ALL.’ It looked like it continued over the page, and over the page again, judging by the way people were flicking through it. Had he really talked that much?
“I’ll take that as a yes,” she said, grinning. “I heard he had you up against a wall, but I didn’t believe it until now.”
“As likely as Apparating through Anti-Apparition wards, or healing curse scars?” Draco pointed out. “We are Mages, Weasley; White Mages, specifically. Literally, Children of the Wild Magic, born with an affinity for fire, water, earth or air. You can’t train someone to use elemental magic, which makes us different from any other kind of Mage. So yes, we are impossibly rare.”

And yet he obviously didn’t realise just
“You’re
Snape glanced into the cauldron, and his thin lips curved into a genuine smile. “Excellent work, Draco. Go and get some dinner. I’ll finish up here.”
Ron’s eyes snapped open, and Hermione’s head jerked up from her book. They stared at him with identical looks of dismay.
“I think it’s a pocket dimension,” Auror Tarr said, waving her wand slowly over the portal. “I had no idea such a thing was feasible.”
, no, too small. Infirmary bed? It wrenched out of her grip, slamming onto its side. Someone grabbed her, dragged her behind it.
“She said Hermione said so, and everything.”
. And now he was in trouble again because fucking
Malfoy made a slight motion, as if trying to shake his wand out of his robes. But of course, his robes had been cut off him the day before, and replaced with a shapeless infirmary gown, so no wand fell into his hand. “Where is it, Potter?” he snapped, suddenly tense.
,” Granger said, breathlessly. “Oh, Harry! Is that what this is about? Do you have a crush on Malfoy?”
Snape's brow creased. “He’s bitten you?”
Pansy glanced over, reluctantly, at Blaise and Ginerva. The two seemed to do nothing but snog and fondle each other in the most nauseatingly public fashion. Still, it was a good strategy. Blaise never involved himself in anything that did not benefit him in some way or another, and as a result, he was almost universally respected, if rarely trusted, by their fellow Slytherins.
“Oh, Merlin no,” Harry groaned, dropping his head to the table.
But now, with Lucius firmly on the wrong side of that line his ancestors had always managed not to cross, it was perhaps inevitable his own son and heir would take it that one step further.
“We thought it was only right,” Hermione said. “He – he’s not well, Harry. But he wanted you to know that he’s glad you proved him wrong. About everything.”
“Speaking of spies, Albus,” McGonagall said. “I think we’re all wondering the same thing.”
. I won’t become you when you let me go, just
“Potter,” Draco said, and then stopped. He made a sound of mingled annoyance and resignation. “I don’t suppose you’ve ever heard of the Dark Moon Ritual?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at the cloak in his hands. He hadn’t really paid attention to it that day on the train. His mind had been filled with the Dark Lord’s threats, the fear that Potter might have heard something damning, and the satisfaction of maybe getting rid of the speccy git for a couple of days. The cloak had been a means to an end, then; nothing more.
“The bed was a freak accident,” Harry said. “I didn’t heal your scars. I wanted to, sure, but I wanted to heal your Dark Mark, too, and that didn’t happen. Did it?” he asked, as an afterthought. Draco glared at him, and Harry shrugged. “I’ll take that as a no. So it wasn’t me. There’s just – no way.”
Draco just smiled up at him, teeth gleaming in the dark. And then he opened his mouth and waited, inviting and passive. Harry almost lost it right there, legs buckling under him.
“Harry?” Dumbledore said, his bushy white eyebrows almost in his hairline.
Charlie shoved at him. “Why are you stopping?”

else.
Harry, who had just come to the same conclusion, nodded grimly. “I’m sorry,” he said. “If I could get him out right now, I would. But I know it’s going to take time. I’m trying to strike the right balance. I don’t want to do anything that might make him develop feelings for me. I know that would only hurt him, in the long run.”
“How long has he loved me, Pans?” he asked. “How long did he have to
“Yeah, mate?” he sighed, trying to work out how much of a fallout there would be, exactly, when this whole thing went up in flames.
“You're right,” Hermione sighed, slamming her dusty old book shut. “None of this is helpful. It’s all prettily-worded waffle about not very much at all. It’s almost as if they were
If he failed, well, then he would have a reason to cry.
“It’s not slipping,” Draco said, indifferently. “It’s a long term complication of the Imperius Curse.”
“Tuesday,” Seamus said. “It’s almost dinner, but I figured you might not want to go down.”
Umbridge laughed. Alastor
It was
“It’s Malfoy! He’s being attacked!”
Ron exchanged a speaking glance with Hermione. Harry had always been mercurial in mood; he could work himself up into a screaming fury in just seconds, or become so withdrawn they wouldn’t see him for days. Hermione said it was a result of his abusive childhood, and having met the Dursleys, Ron didn’t doubt that for a second.
Draco stared at him quizzically, resolutely not admiring the curve of Potter’s arse.
“In your dreams, Potter,” Draco said, but he was smiling. “Get off me, you git.”
Smith stumbled away, and fell. Ron managed to get a hand on Bella’s wand. She broke his grip. Then Fred and George Weasley were running towards them. Dolohov Apparated in. The two groups clashed.
“Both dead,” Greene shouted. “Weasley, take them. I’ve got our six!”
“Draco!” he cried.
He could feel his chin beginning to tremble, and he pressed his fingers into his eyes again, trying to force back the tears. He felt raw; naked and exposed. He wanted them to stop

“He’s probably not,” Belinda said. “It’s not like Slytherins are renowned for cooperation, and this party is supposed to be about cooperation and fostering inter-house relations. That’s what the invite says, right, Lexie?”
“Draco!” he called, hurrying across the crowded Entrance Hall.
Harry sighed. “Draco… that’s not why.” He reached out to touch Malfoy’s arm, but stopped when those expressive eyebrows rose. “I know you don’t trust me. I just really, really don’t like seeing you go hungry. No one deserves to be afraid and sleep-deprived and starving, no matter who they are. And no one –” he held Malfoy’s gaze, “
Draco shrugged. “It means that there was some controversy over whether the ‘gangers could be classified as alive. And because they only last a few minutes – several hours at the most – there were ethical concerns.”
“They raided your home when we were in second year,” Harry remembered.
“Understandable, yes,” Dumbledore agreed, “but unfortunate. If we assume the Wizengamot is effectively under enemy control, we have to consider the Ministry itself vulnerable. And with the Ministry vulnerable, we cannot rely on aid from that quarter. Hogwarts and the Order will stand alone, when the time comes.”
“I’m not going to –!”
Lord Voldemort was pleased.
The Death Eaters would rally, she knew. But the inferi were already lost, wandering the ceiling without purpose. She felt hollowed out; empty. But Ron was still screaming. She forced herself back up. Crawled towards him. There was a table, splintered and broken, one leg almost off. She heaved at it, breaking it off.
Draco hesitated. “No. The Dark Lord’s taken a personal interest in him. He could be anywhere.”
He rolled to his feet, surprised that Malfoy hadn’t taken advantage of his lapse to end the duel. But Malfoy was just watching him, looking a little lost, and Harry almost felt guilty for swinging his wand down in an arch and thinking as hard as he could,
“At this point I’m about ready to lay siege to Slytherin,” Harry assured him. He wasn’t even entirely joking. “Any and all suggestions are welcome, believe me.”
It was dark and cold in the tunnel. Draco stumbled. Rough hands were on him immediately, pushing him upright, forcing him to keep moving. “Stop,” he muttered. “
to make you come again.”
Pansy met her blue eyes, pausing deliberately to let Daphne’s words hang in the air between them. “I suppose,” she said finally, “that that is something only time will tell.”
Harry whirled. He couldn’t see anything, but then – a very distinctive scream.
, Madam Pomfrey had barked around four in the afternoon, and after that it had all been a blur. The physical healing of magically-sustained injuries apparently worked in much the same way as for normal injuries, but wizarding Healing was poles apart from Muggle medicine for the simple reason that wizards had magic running through their veins. And while a snapped bone could usually be re-set in an instant, complications such as infection could apparently arise just as quickly, especially with a body already weakened by the sustained use of a Dark curse.
A muscle in Snape’s jaw twitched. “You are
. He smiled grimly. “Stay.” Amycus roared at him silently, fighting the spell. Draco stabbed his wand forward, forcing the man to his knees. Then, “
“And that, I think, is my cue to leave,” Pius said, standing with a creak. He laughed softly. “Listen to those old bones. Enjoy your youth, boys. I predict many, many happy years to come.”
. It might not be permanent, like Voldemort’s, but it was still a claim, of sorts. He raised his eyes to Draco’s again, and saw the knowledge of it reflected there. “Just for one day,” he said. “Please? You need to give your body time to recover. Just for one day.”
“Or he’s dead, too,” Snape said.
He felt as if he might start walking on air at any moment.
Bellatrix levitated the boulder off him and sent it flying back at Dumbledore. Dumbledore waved his wand. The boulder exploded into dust. With the same wand movement, he hit Bellatrix with a spell that caused her to stagger, looking dizzy and pale.
Seamus relaxed, and winked at Pansy, who was looking vaguely amused as Neville disentangled their hands with stammered apologies.
“I’m sorry.”
– ask you to choose his life over your own. But Pansy, you have to promise me. If it comes down to Harry and I, you’ll choose him.”
Hermione frowned. “I’m sure that’s not how he sees you.”

that?” he asked.
She was in the middle of the crowded dance-floor before she realised Blaise wasn’t looking at her.
Draco emerged from Azkaban, a frail skeleton. He lived under house arrest in a small apartment in the outskirts of Muggle London, without even that loveless marriage or the little boy; just a string of empty one-night stands with black-haired, green-eyed men.
you were mine.”
me how romantic you can be sometimes, Potter,” Draco said, raising his eyes heavenward. But he climbed back into bed without further complaint, and Harry gathered him close, nudging his nose under Draco’s jaw.
know?” Hermione snapped. Then she winced, looking contrite. “Sorry, Harry. I’m not sure. He’s avoiding me.”
They arrived, moments later, in the small shed where he, Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle had spent many a summer’s day playing as children.
he felt for Draco. He’d never topped before. Justin hadn’t liked the idea of letting a virgin do that to him, so Harry had bottomed for his first time. And then of course, that had been the end of that.
“Yes, my lord.”
Either way, Draco would be lost forever. A criminal with a permanent record, if he wasn’t sentenced to life imprisonment or the Kiss.
He hurried past the kitchens. They took the stairs back to the first floor.
, trying to levitate himself above the hole.
. He’d done it! Fred was fine. He just had to be clever about this. He couldn’t save everyone. He couldn’t save Dobby. The Killing Curse was final, and irreversible, and too many people had seen it.
He began twirling her around her group of friends.
, and –
“Hermione –”
“I’m sorry, sir,” Harry said, meekly. “I kind of forgot about it, what with everything that happened on Saturday.”
Draco looked at Harry, and Harry nodded.
him. If he hadn’t taken the contraceptives, he almost certainly would have ended up pregnant. The thought should have scared the living daylights out of him, should have jolted him out of the haze of lust and arousal, but it sent him higher instead, and he suddenly, bitterly regretted letting Snape give him those potions.
cover their faces.”
It frightened him. He knew the basic mechanics of it, but he’d never even touched himself like that while masturbating. He was straight. And that meant he was supposed to fantasise about penetrating. Right? Not – not being penetrated.
Draco smiled at him. “My French ancestors. Elizabeth was the granddaughter of Marotine de Malfoi, who built Malfoy Manor in the twelfth century. She was the eldest of five girls, and her father’s favourite. She stood to inherit everything when he died, but she became involved in an extramarital relationship with a farmhand named John Wexcombe, and her father threw her out. She was forced to flee to the continent with her lover. Jeremiah believed Wexcombe was also a White Mage. Their combined power was said to be great and terrible, and wherever they went, the people trembled before them.”
like he does. And I really believe he has a chance. I’ve never seen Draco like this before. He’s –” She hesitated, biting her lip, and Seamus knew she was trying to decide if she could trust him.
“We’re not alone,” Ron said, firmly. “There’s the Order, and the DA alumni. And others will come, once word gets out. We have advance warning now, thanks to Jenkins. But I reckon Mum’s right. Voldemort’s a fool if he attacks with Dumbledore in residence.
NEWTS, just like me?” she said. “I didn’t realise how much we have in common! Of course, one of her NEWTs is Divination, which is – well.” Ron made a stifled noise, and Harry carefully didn’t look over at him, fighting his own grin. “But Seamus was right – she’s taking Muggle Studies, and I can’t help but admire that. Did you know she’s the only Slytherin in the entire NEWT-level class? Seventh years included.”
Draco swung around to help his friends. He froze. Greyback was rising slowly to his feet, yellow eyes barely a foot from Draco’s. Powerful hind legs crouched in readiness for a leap.
“You have no idea what I’m capable of,” Malfoy snarled, taking an aggressive step forward. “I’m not you, Potter. I know you tried to use the Cruciatus Curse on my aunt last year. She told me you couldn’t do it, even though she killed your godfather right in front of you. I’m not like you.
“I want it,” Potter said, abruptly.
“What in the seven hells was
She tried to push herself up. Her knees buckled. Ron was fighting the werewolf.
, Draco said.
McGonagall frowned. “Mr Malfoy, if I might suggest you wait to speak until you’re spoken to? You were warned about any further offenses. The unfinished assignments, missing classes, fighting with Mr Potter in the middle of my class, and then just before your detention for the same misdemeanour –” She stopped, closing her eyes briefly. “Can I assume, now, that you were
Hermione shook her head. “It’s probably not relevant, but you should be prepared. We’re dealing with
Harry stared at him, aware that he was trembling, but not sure how to stop. “How do you –?”
“Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed,” said a voice, further up the hallway. Pansy dropped back automatically, recognising Harry Potter’s voice. “I don’t think he’s been to dinner in at least two weeks. As soon as class is over for the day, he disappears. Sometimes even
“I am.” The figure did not appear to move, but suddenly it had closed the distance between them. She stifled another scream. It had no face, just darkness under its deep hood. “Calm yourself, child. You have nothing to fear from me. I am not fair or just, but I abide by certain rules. It is not your time.”
of it. Held down, his Alpha’s body on him,
Harry bit his lip. A sob threatened, but he forced it back. He tried to open his mouth and make a joke, but he couldn’t. He was biting too hard, he realised; he could taste blood. Draco would be angry with him for mauling himself.
“Who’s coming?” Weasley demanded.
Draco had to swallow several times before he could speak. “Yes. It’s – yes.”
“Hurts,” he cried.
Fortunately, respect for the personal boundaries of the only known, bonded Alpha-Omega couple in the wizarding world kept most people at bay, and Ron and Hermione were able to handle the rest.
,” he begged, tears slipping down his face, voice cracking as he scrabbled to pull away. But Harry just did it again, and again, and the spell inside him came back to life, fucking him again, until Draco thought he’d lose his mind, unable to think or breathe or even remember how to form words. He just shook, sobbing, pleasure and pain merging until he could no longer tell one from the other, and Harry was losing his rhythm, hips rocking erratically –
She stopped short.
“Why did you show me your Invisibility Cloak?” Draco countered.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” Harry said. “Did you get much done?”
He wanted to

can wait.”
He made his way to Professor McGonagall’s office, instead, and knocked.
Harry slipped into the seat beside Ron at the Gryffindor table, snagging a piece of crispy bacon from his plate. Ron grunted, but his mouth was too full to protest, and Harry was already talking by the time he’d chewed enough to swallow. “Did you know Ginny’s dating Blaise Zabini?”
She rolled her eyes at him. “You’re an
“And Gryffindor has the Snitch!” Seamus screamed. “
“Get the injured back to the castle!” McGonagall shouted.

he defected? He hasn’t, yet.”
“It’s all right,” Dumbledore said, soothingly. “You are in shock, and understandably so. I will make this as quick and simple as I possibly can. I know you are in pain. But first, I need to know – and I understand this is a very sensitive subject for a young man of your age, but I need you to answer honestly, Harry. Do you understand?”
Pansy stared at her, shocked. In all the years she’d known Daphne Greengrass, she’d never seen the other girl cry.
“There’s some kind of secret passage in here,” Theo said.
. Of course, the mead, but – oh, no wonder Malfoy’s been so frightened all year!”
Harry stared at him. “I grew up without magic. It’s not that bad.”
Strangely enough, it was the thought of Snape that kept him strong, kept him sane through the rush of desire and lust burning him up from the inside. His trousers were soaked, clinging to him in a way that Harry found more than a little distracting. He was actually considering removing them entirely. Being naked couldn’t possibly make the Alphas want him more; each boy was progressively more frantic in their attempts to claim him.
And Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father.
“Talk to her,” Harry advised, getting to his feet. “And, Ron? Don’t fuck it up this time, yeah? I’m not a bloody heterosexual match-maker.”
to me about it – twice! For heaven’s sake,
The Death Eaters all swung around to point their wands at the intruder. Harry strained to catch a glimpse. Saw silvery light glinting off white-blond hair. Alone. Draco was
“Will it be necessary, do you think?” Blaise asked, lightly. “After all, you know him better than I.”
, mate. Alphas go nuts over you. Bonkers. Didn’t you see them in DADA? And that was just the beginning of your heat. It’s supposed to be –” he looked embarrassed, but there was a definite hint of jealousy in his voice, “the best sex
Harry smirked. “Of course you would. Alpha.”
Draco glanced at his friends. Vince was sporting a nasty gash above one eye, and Greg had been hit with a Cross-Eyed Jinx. He was struggling to focus, and there was a splatter of vomit across his robes. “Oh. Sorry about that,” Draco said, wincing. He cast the counter to the Cross-Eyed Jinx.
Harry frowned, brows knitting together. “Of course I do. What are you even talking about? You know I love you.”
He struggled against the spell, eyes wide and fixed on Harry. “No! Let me go!” he sobbed. “Oh Salazar, Harry, I’m sorry, I’m
“Yeah,” Ginny sighed, frustrated. “He’s great on the pitch. Brilliant, actually; did you see that save? But he’s so – so – I don’t know. It’s like he sees guys around every corner, just waiting to snatch me away or something. It’s so stupid, Hermione! It drives me crazy. Everything he does, it’s like it’s all designed to
Draco checked on Vince. Pansy saw the relief on his face, and her own shoulders relaxed slightly. He was alive, then. Unlike the young woman from Hogsmeade. Her husband was kneeling by her body, weeping. Luna put a hand on his shoulder.
Draco’s reply was drowned out by Slughorn’s bellow, encouraging the class to pick a cherry tree and “start digging!” Hermione tugged at Harry’s sleeve, and Draco frowned and turned away. But Harry had a point to make, and he didn’t let him get far. As soon as Draco was crouched down at the base of a nearby tree with Pansy, he raised his wand and sent a little breeze at the branches above. The blossoms trembled and fell in a shower of pink-and-white, landing light as will-o’-wisps in Draco’s hair, on his shoulders, in the creases of his summer robes.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, her tone heavy with disappointment.
Snape blinked. “You’re saying... Potter, this isn’t the remnants of your heat? It hasn't even
Draco sighed. “You do realise that extracting such a vow from a Slytherin is the height of redundancy, don’t you?” Harry smiled at him, and Draco rolled his eyes. “Very well. If it makes you feel better, I promise, too.”
Harry pursed his lips. “If you really mean that, Draco, you can’t hide anything from me anymore. And you can’t lie to me, even if you think it’s for my own good.”
Ron snorted. “Trelawney’s practiced Divination for years. She has a bit of a talent for it, that’s all. Mostly she’s just an old fraud. She doesn’t have the attention span for the kind of intensive study it would take to become a trained Mage.”
Draco worked his way down the hallway steadily, ducking under spells, throwing himself under and around the enemy. Disarming. Killing. He was savagely, single-mindedly focused on his task.
, and gentle, when you look at Parkinson, or when you’re so exhausted you can hardly keep them open –”
, he shouted through their bond. It bounced off the wall, but he kept trying, battering at it desperately.
“He’s your
Harry sighed explosively. “Fine, okay. Maybe we did make up. But it was all part of The Plan, and that’s over now. His mother’s safe, and he gave the other Slytherins a safe way out if they wanted it. It’s over. Whatever was between us doesn’t matter anymore.”
Horrified, Pansy deflected an explosive spell mostly on instinct. It hit a tree. A splinter of wood caught her across the face. Sadie Atwood yelled in triumph.
Rage flashed through him, boiling up from the pit of his stomach. After everything they’d been through, after
The wooden bridge was the most direct route out to the lawn, where a thick cloud of smoke already covered the frontline troops. Harry could see the flashes of runes going off, even far to the north near the Forbidden Forest, and all the way to the south-west, past the Black Lake. The Death Eaters were trying to go around. Which meant the Anti-Apparition wards were still up, at least.
Draco blinked down at the photo, taken by surprise.
Harry nodded. He realised he was still holding the Resurrection Stone in his hand. He looked at it, and then at Luna. Slowly, he stood, bracing himself against the statue. “Hey, Luna? If I said I had a way for you to talk to your mother again, would you take it?”
“As much as it pains me to say it, no,” Dumbledore sighed. “The wizarding public is not ready for a truth like this. Especially when we ourselves continue to be ignorant of the true import of your magical outbursts, Harry.”
“I wasn’t, entirely,” Draco said. “I told you Pansy had a vision of the future. It was a True vision, using a powerful medium; you know the Mirror, on the fourth floor?”
claim him in my place. Do you understand? He will
Harry just met his gaze coolly.
Hermione shook her head at them. “Intimacy,” she said. “Each time it happened, you were close to Malfoy. Out of necessity, yes, but you’d never really experienced that kind of intimacy before, had you? So the feelings it engendered would have been powerful. Powerful enough that whatever this is manifested itself in you first.”
“You don’t believe that,” Daphne said, staring at her in surprise. “You really believe Potter can outsmart Draco. Are you mad?”
He only realised he still had hold of Draco’s hand when Draco pulled it away from him. He could vaguely hear his lover speaking, and the distant sound of Zabini’s screams as he warded off Bat-Bogeys, but it was like white noise in his ears.
I wasn’t –”
He could feel himself tiring, but Madam Pomfrey was urging him not to let go just yet. He reached out, and felt Draco answer him. He smiled, that warm, gentle sunshine filling his soul again, giving him strength. He barely felt it when Madam Pomfrey jerked back, and then went back in with renewed vigour.
. Harry was supposed to keep him safe, not put him in even more danger. “I’d rather let Voldemort kill me than see you hurt. Don’t you understand that?”
He took a deep breath, trying to remember Snape’s instructions.
Draco to pay attention to his utter lack of interest in anyone but Draco; his true mate, his Alpha, his one and only love. Draco made a pleased noise, and bent his head to latch his mouth onto Harry’s mark, sucking lightly. Harry cried out, his cock hardening so fast his head spun, the rest of his body going limp and pliable and
The next two pages covered the rebuilding efforts. The Ministry was still struggling to fill positions of importance. There was talk of fast-tracking Hogwarts graduates through the Auror and Hit Wizard programs. The Department of Mysteries had been declared beyond repair; centuries of work, lost forever. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement had been decimated.
Potter’s eyes flashed, but he didn’t protest, which was a little disappointing. Argus would have liked to provoke the little bug into disrespecting him, which would have been a valid reason to extend the detention further. Or make the punishment even harsher, Argus thought, remembering his whip longingly.
Pius broke into a wide smile. “Well, then. I am very pleased to hear it, Master Malfoy. Please do not hesitate to contact me in future, any time at all. That goes for you, too, Mr Potter. It was both a pleasure and a privilege to meet you, and I wish you all the very best.”
Harry promised he would, and then escaped upstairs to tell Ron and Hermione everything.
Time ceased to have any meaning.
“Draco,” Harry said, desperately.
Potter laughed, and they disappeared down the boys’ hallway together.
Pain exploded behind Harry’s eyes, white-hot and scorching as the Horcrux dug its strong, deformed little fingers into his soul and held on even tighter.
“Ginny,” Lavender said, stopping behind her. “You look nice. Are you coming to our party?”
“The mewling of a dead child,” crowed Umbridge, from inside the cage. Alastor’s head snapped around. Her eyes were alight with exhilaration. “This is it. This is the end!”
expression, out of the mouth of one of the most traditional purebloods in all of Hogwarts? She looked around, seeing her confusion mirrored on almost every face around them.
anything. It wouldn’t even serve a purpose, now. Draco had defected, and Harry didn’t love him. It was just sex.
Snape stared at them both. “You stupid,
“Only if dead is all right,” Draco said, drowsily. He groped for one of Harry’s hands and twined their fingers together, bringing them up to his lips to kiss.
Harry slid down the wall, afterwards, and leaned forward to kiss him, hot and messy. He was shivering a little, and had to clench his fists in Draco’s robes to steady himself. He’d never gotten further than a kiss with Cho, and Justin – well, Harry had suggested it once, but Justin had looked so disgusted with the idea, Harry had never mentioned it again. Now, blowjobs were officially his new favourite thing, and that was saying something, given the number of new experiences he’d been having, lately.
Draco’s magic rose to protect him. Everyone else crumpled instantly.
Someone almost bumped into him. He stifled a yelp, skipping sideways.
“Oh yes, dear Poppy,” she said, ushering them inside. “She really is the most remarkable mediwitch. Not only has she far surpassed my expectations of my recovery, but I’ve had the pleasure of observing her this past week. Her skill and compassion is both beautiful and profoundly humbling. I understand now why Headmaster Dumbledore chose her over the three Healers the Board of Governors had short-listed for the position.”
But it didn’t end there. The flashes of the future kept coming. He lived, to see his parents stand trial; his father given the Dementor’s Kiss, his mother sentenced to house arrest, saved only from living death by Harry’s testimony. Hit Wizards stripped the Manor of his family heirlooms and vaults, and then sold the Manor right from under them. He married a young woman with pretty blonde hair, but there was no happiness in their faces at the wedding. It was a loveless, miserable marriage, the only bright spot was an irrepressible little boy with white-blond hair like his own.
Seamus ran towards her, turning to fall into step behind her. “I’ve got your back!”
, everything was
“Ordinary wizards can’t learn to use elemental magic,” Draco corrected. “But being born with an affinity for it doesn’t mean we don’t need to practice. We’ve been reaching out with our emotions so far, throwing around the magic with all the finesse of a Beater throwing his weight around on the Quidditch field. That’s hardly effective.”
sweetheart, it’s okay.”
“Yes, indeed,” Umbridge simpered. “But I think you’ll find that Mr Potter does not deny it. After all,” she said, meeting Harry's eyes maliciously, “he knows very well that
He was on his knees, he realised. He couldn’t get up. McGonagall’s eyes were closed. Was she dead? Cold crept over him, inevitable as death.
Draco stepped back, breathing hard, fighting to control the adrenaline.
. Malfoy sucked in a deep, shuddering breath, scrubbing his hands over his face. “You have no idea, Potter.”
, Harry. I don't care what destiny Dumbledore and a thrice-damned prophecy have mapped out for you. I will
“You keep saying ‘it’,” Madam Pomfrey observed. “Like you weren’t stopping his magic, but something else.”
The trial was being held in one of the newer courtrooms on level nine, and they walked down the hallway that led to the Department of Mysteries. Harry avoided looking at the door at the very end, his heart thumping unpleasantly. They made a right, and the hallway widened and became brighter, with carpet on the floors and enchanted windows that provided a view of a park somewhere in London. It was a beautiful morning; completely at odds with the mood inside the Ministry.
He didn’t want to be capable of it, and that was what no one seemed to understand. He certainly didn’t want to be capable of killing another wizard with his back turned, or unarmed, or in any other way, really, than in a fair fight, no matter what that meant for his chances of survival.
No one suggested he return to the Dursleys for what remained of the holidays. Of course not. He was free, now. He was so relieved at the realisation that he vomited into the toilet, twice, and then laughed for five minutes straight. He was crying by the end of it, for the first time since he’d woken up after the battle, but he felt much better afterwards.
“I’m sorry?” Pansy said, politely. She steered them unobtrusively away from the crowds of students, into a quiet hallway.
! Snape is ours, just as Draco will be again!”
More owls swooped in, and a newspaper dropped into her bowl, splattering cream and pudding all over the table. She grimaced, fishing it out.
“Oh Harry,
Harry’s jaw clenched. He was beginning to feel awkward and uncomfortable, curled up against Draco’s chest as he was, but he felt as if he might just shake apart if he let go now.
“When I signed up for this, I didn’t know there would be homework,” he said, morosely. “How does Hermione read this stuff for fun?”
Draco sat up with a gasp. “
It seemed to take an enormous effort, but George turned his gaze up to his twin’s face. He was very pale, mouthing something that George couldn’t make out.
Still, he wasn’t convinced it would sway public opinion like Ron and Hermione and Luna all thought it would. Especially since, given the whispers filling the Great Hall, people were far more interested in what he’d revealed about Sirius than the battle.
protecting him.”
, let alone allowing it to go on public record.”
The Atrium was a scene of carnage. Bodies everywhere, the floor torn up, and that ugly black statue transformed into some kind of enormous… cage? There were survivors inside, but Mad-Eye Moody was the only one he could see outside, slumped against the far wall, his left arm cradled in his lap. It was broken, judging by the jut of bloody white Elphias could see. Which meant both arms were out of action. He was helpless. They all were.
“It’s been good for you, though,” Potter said, ignoring Draco’s almost-slip. He stood, reaching out to clasp Draco’s upper arm briefly. “And I appreciate it.”
boy. Turn over for me, Harry.”
It made him uncomfortable and upset, even as his trousers dripped onto the floor and he fought the urge to beg for their unwanted attention.
“Going to report me to Rita Skeeter, if I am?” Harry retorted.
Harry gazed at him, overwhelmed. “Pansy should probably get some of the credit for that.”
“Very well,” she agreed. “Harry. I appreciate you leaving Draco to talk to me. I know you wanted to stay with him tonight.”
Potter brightened. “Actually, yes. I wanted to ask you on a date.”
the suffering of the forest and its inhabitants, reduced to ashes by his own flame. The desolation of the land, cratered and battle-scarred. The ancient, stalwart castle, turned to rubble. The spirits inside. The living, fatigued and suffering.
Harry nodded. “You’re welcome.”
Draco laughed. It sounded odd; strained, almost hysterical. “You have no idea what I know, Potter. Leave it, would you?”
That afternoon, there was a big commotion during Transfiguration. Professor McGonagall had been teaching them (so far unsuccessfully) to transfigure inanimate objects into larger animate objects.
Ron screamed.
“Yeah. One year too late,” Harry said, a little bitterly.
a good person, he was brilliant and brave and –
“You heard me.” Malfoy looked angry now, grey eyes flashing. “We were on a date. I had every right to let you kiss me. And Finch-Fletchley came at me from behind. I almost bled out in the middle of the
Only Draco’s hand on his thigh kept Harry from jumping up and interrupting again.
Draco stared at her. “Potter is part of my future?”
“Of course,” Dumbledore said, coldly. “But I fear it will not be as illuminating as you hope.” He turned to Harry. “Do you remember how you killed the basilisk in your second year, my dear boy?”
She just laughed, and a chill shivered down Harry’s spine. “Draco is a
“Yes,” Hermione confirmed.
“I will,” she assured him, tucking it into her pocket. She cast a Feather-light Charm on the Ravenclaw boy, hoisting him in her arms, and headed towards the infirmary.

Before Harry could even begin to try to get his head around
Harry stared at him. He’d caught the Snitch several times with moves not too dissimilar to the ones Draco had just used. Draco had to know that. And yet… he’d always been so restrained on the pitch. Harry would bet a pile of galleons on it being fear of failure. Specifically, fear of failing his father. Which was ironic, because Draco had always been the most challenging of Harry’s opponents. If he lost that debilitating fear, he might actually win.
Ginny couldn’t keep silent any longer. “You BASTARD! What about
Harry stared at her. “Me, professor?”
Seamus smiled back at her, covering her hand with his. “I don’t know about swearing anything, but we could do with your help now. With Malfoy, I mean. He probably told you he shot down Harry’s invitation to go with him to Hogsmeade. We need some help with what Malfoy likes, what might make him more, uh –”
“How’d we get here?” he said, blinking, confused.
“I’m going to bite you,” Draco said, “and it’s going to
“I did no such thing,” Draco scoffed, trying to hide how shaken he was. “Are you hearing voices now?”
“I’m taking you to the infirmary,” Snape snapped at him. “And if you know what’s good for you, you’ll stop fighting me and come with me quickly.”
? He was a fool as well as a liar.
Loud whispers filled the room, and he walked back down the aisle between the desks, taking advantage of the distraction to whisper in Draco’s ear. “We need to talk,” he said.
Harry stared at her, remembering his promise. “I haven’t told him yet,” he said. “I’m –”
, Mr Malfoy, and if you don't want to lose him forever, you will move
“I would never!” Creevy said. “Harry, I wouldn’t! I promise.”
, Harry.”
,” he chanted three times, with the last of his strength. It was a powerful healing spell, but he was too weak for it, now. His wound kept bleeding.
The Eternity Mirror? Infinity? It was powerful, anyway, and it made sense now that Pansy had finally succeeded in her attempts at scrying.
Harry’s eyes watered, and he had to turn his head away. He felt stupid, like he was overreacting. This wasn’t like Cedric, or Sirius. Remus wasn’t dead, just captured. But he looked at Draco, getting to his feet unsteadily, face tear-stained but closing off, and he felt such an inexplicable sense of
you!” She threw down her fork and stormed away, leaving Harry to stare after her in bewilderment, thinking that, all in all, he was very glad he caught the Snitch for the other team, so to speak.
“Why does everyone keep saying that?” Harry interrupted, crossly. “You of all people, too! You can’t just ignore what Draco did, even if I
, and you’re
“Of course it’s yours,” he said. “I want you to have it back.”
He caught a flash of green out of the corner of his eye. He shoved Ron sideways. The spell went over his shoulder. Ron’s shield fizzled out. His best friend spun on his heel, roaring with effort. Defensive magic was thick in the air. It stung the back of Harry’s throat, like scorched wood.
against his lips, and Harry’s world tore itself apart.
.” It was a clear dismissal, and Dawlish spun on his heel, slamming out of the room. “Albus –”
Dumbledore sighed again. He stood and moved over to the window, turning his back to the room. It was a clear statement of disapproval, but Harry found he didn’t mind so much. His faith in Dumbledore had been shaken, and he needed something else to hold onto right now. Someone else.
Snape visibly cringed, but it was Draco that caught Harry’s attention. He had frozen, fists clenched. “You knew Dumbledore was my target,” he said, tone very neutral.

“We’re taking these kids to the infirmary!” Hannah snapped. “
“Idiot!” Malfoy snarled. He looked on the verge of a full breakdown. Or murder. “

, Draco,” he said, breathlessly. “Come, or I won’t stop. I’ll just keep on, and on –”
She just raised an eyebrow at him. Draco could talk the talk as well as any Slytherin, but she was perhaps the only one in the world who knew just how fascinated he was by all things Muggle. Ever since fourth year, when her mother had insisted she start taking Muggle Studies, Draco had pored over her textbooks in the dead of night, sounding out the unfamiliar words and staring, enthralled, sometimes for hours on end, at the strangely still pictures.
“We can’t take them back to Hogwarts,” Draco said. “The Room’s already been compromised once.”
“FRED!” he screamed.
“He trained as a field medi-wizard, in the last war,” Dumbledore explained. “Before your time.”
“It’s not like that,” the other Harry said, frustrated. “I’m just memories you’ve locked away; nothing else. Yes, the heat buried everything that might have interfered with the bonding, but it was still
“Now,” Narcissa said, her tone brooking no arguments.

near him again until his decision is made.”
Draco let him go. As intrigued as he was by Tonks’ revelation, he knew he had no part in this conversation. He didn’t even attempt to eavesdrop through the bond, though he wanted to.
Harry kicked his heels on the stone bench in the west courtyard, squinting against the glare of the afternoon sun. Ron was sprawled out along the edge of the fountain opposite him, his freckled face tilted up into the spray of water.
“Draco,” Pansy said. She inclined her head slightly towards Harry. “I think you’re underestimating your… unique capacity in this situation.”
“By you?” Seamus challenged, half-rising.
“I’m okay, sir,” he said, trying to sound casual. He thought he had mostly succeeded, but Dumbledore’s shrewd blue eyes had always seen right through him, and he sighed. “I’m sorry.”
“It’s perfect, Harry,” Draco interrupted. “I love it.” He fastened it around his wrist, and looked up to find Harry smiling. “You really made it yourself?”
Draco’s eyes snapped to a group of Dementors less than ten feet away. Several of them turned, floating down towards them. Draco ducked. “Back,
“Draco,” Harry said. He didn’t touch, though Draco could feel his need to do so; to feel for himself that Draco was still alive. There was part of him that wanted to do the same. The bond wasn’t enough, not after Harry had almost died. “It’s enough,” Harry said, very earnestly. “You saved my
to those who love you... I can’t hide how much that has hurt and shaken me.”
Harry went bright red. “I’m so sorry,” he muttered. “That was stupid and dangerous. I could have really hurt you.”
She fell.
“Not for lack of trying, though, believe me,” Hermione said, deadpan.
Tonks nodded. She flicked her wand. The two unconscious werewolves floated up and into the Room of Requirement. Daphne and Theo followed.
. Even Harry, who had grown up with Muggles.
Draco’s lips twitched.
“I’m sorry,” she said.
“No,” Ron moaned. “Oh Merlin, I know, but come on! Harry and Malfoy,
“Yes,” Draco said, and promptly stripped Harry of every stitch of clothing with one, tiny flick of his finger.

“A penalty?” Malfoy sighed. “What, Potter?”
“I know,” Draco said, and drew him into his arms.
Harry blinked, blinked again, and sat up quickly. “Dumbledore and

Pansy stiffened. “Absolutely not.”

He smiled. They’d been hoping to catch him in a crossfire, then.
Lupin frowned, but Rowle was beginning to stir. Inside the alcove, Carrow had thrown off the ropes that bound him. He was watching them, eyes glinting maliciously. His wand was in Draco’s pocket, but most Death Eaters knew at least some wandless spells. Even the Carrows.
“What?” Malfoy looked down at the girl, obviously startled. His eyes dropped to the plate in her hands. “No. You have it.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “I've told you, I won’t take that risk with my mother’s life.”
Harry grimaced. “I’m not a leader.”
Potter shrank in on himself. “I’m sorry, sir.”
. Fifty-two minutes, now. He made his decision. “If the Death Eaters managed to breach the Room of Requirement, there’s no telling where they’ve taken the kids. I have to go to him. I have no choice. But you’re right, Voldemort has no incentive to keep his end of the bargain. So take the Room of Requirement back. Find them. If you succeed before the hour’s up, send me a Patronus.”
Harry closed his eyes miserably. “I love you,” he offered, and Draco made a sudden, low, wrenching sound in his throat.
“Madam Pomfrey is speaking for you?”
. Not children her

“Oh. No, that’s sort of a level below.” He eyed her sideways. “You
Something exploded, ripping through Madam Pomfrey’s shield.
“Don’t sound so surprised,” Malfoy said, dryly. “There’s a dearth of attractive gay boys here at Hogwarts, in case you hadn’t noticed. Of course, Finch-Fletchley turned out to be a waste of effort, but my point is, there’s no reason to assume it was
?” He reached out to her, moving as if he might stand, but Rookwood took a threatening step forward, and Draco flinched backwards.
“I don’t know,” she said. “What do you mean, Elder wand?”
Draco licked his hand, and Harry gasped, losing his rhythm for a moment. And then Draco’s hands gripped his hips, and their cocks slid together in a way that had Harry biting so hard into his fist that he drew blood. It couldn’t muffle his scream of completion completely, especially when Draco cried out, voice trapped behind Harry’s hand, and Harry felt his cock slide through the slick, wet heat of Draco’s semen.
that. But somehow, it struck a chord. The idea of his life being more important to someone than killing Voldemort…
” Granger shouted.
Harry glanced at the road. Sure enough, there were other little blue lights racing towards them. But Draco’s wall was already under attack. It shuddered, pieces of rock breaking off. “Go,” he urged them. “We’ll be right behind you.”
“Ron’s an arse,” he said, nudging her gently. “You knew that already.”
The ward-bubble was only five feet across, so they had to move as a group, with Pansy in the middle. There were too many of them to Apparate. The Death Eaters followed them, attacks growing more ferocious as they neared the infirmary. By all rights, it should have collapsed by now. But Draco’s lodestone was uniquely powerful, and Pansy thought it was sustaining the ward somehow. Impossible, of course. Like all their Mage magic.
Harry frowned, looking around. And then it sunk in. The body she was standing over, that mangled piece of flesh and blood – that was
He asked Professor McGonagall about it, the next time he saw her. She just smiled, and said, “Oh, you found it, did you?” and refused to say anything else.
“Granger, Weasley,” Draco said, and brushed past them.
,” stressing that deliberately so Primrose couldn’t ignore it. Surely it couldn’t just be her who found that contemptible?
It was an hour after dinner had ended, which meant that even the stragglers should have returned to their dorms. Instead, the Entrance Hall was in chaos, people running and shouting in terror, spells flying. Harry had his wand in his hand instantly, shoving Draco behind him as he took a step across the threshold.
This one, however, was louder than the rest, and it didn’t stop immediately. A clamour of student voices rose above the alarm, and Ernie Macmillan, seated nearest the door, peeked outside.
Harry felt the shock of that hit him like a sledgehammer. “Merlin,” he said, wrapping his own arms around his Alpha. “No.
Harry perched on the side of his chair. “What about you? Earth Magic?”
“Your woeful ignorance continues to astound and yet not surprise me, Potter,” Snape snapped.
Soon she would be fighting for her life, and she couldn’t even see who she would be fighting alongside. She wondered if Seamus was there, somewhere in the trees, or her friends. Would they be enough? Could
“No,” she corrected him, settling into the armchair by the fire. “I’m scared for you, Draco. You’re juggling far too much right now. Madam Rosmerta, your task, your Occlumency shields, Snape, your schoolwork,
Harry's jaw tightened. “I know. But I fell for Voldemort’s ruse. Sirius came to rescue me.”
Sometimes, when he was inside Draco, and Draco looked up at him with his heart in his eyes… sometimes he wondered if that was it. If that was love.
running late –”
Harry’s sobs tapered off at last, and Draco pressed his lips to the dark hair. Harry sniffled, rubbing his nose against Draco’s shoulder. He looked up to catch Draco’s moue of distaste, and laughed waterly. “Sorry. Thank you,” he said.
Harry stared, mouthing ‘
He was all too aware that his task was next to impossible; punishment, for his father’s failure. Even if, against all odds, he actually succeeded, it still would not guarantee the Dark Lord’s forgiveness. But he had made certain vows, and for his mother’s sake, he would not forsake them.
“You can help?” Draco said quickly, leaning forward, his eyes focusing on Pius for the first time without aggression. “Do you know what's wrong with me, sir?”
In the end, he just snuck in the two additional mock-orange sepals, and pretended not to know why their potion glimmered more than everyone else’s.
Draco gaped at him. “And run away?” It was the most insolent Pansy had ever heard him. Lucius flushed bright red. “I won’t do that, Father.”
for me, Potter?” Draco mocked, gently. “Because your presence will make everything
The dragon’s head lowered. Down, down, down, its enormous jaw opening as if in slow motion. Pansy stared in horrified fascination. It was a gaping maw of death, fire smouldering deep inside. She tried to swallow, but her mouth was dry with terror. It was going to kill them. It was going to kill…
McGonagall removed her glasses, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Mr Potter, you have been accusing Mr Malfoy all year of being behind the necklace and the poisoned mead – which almost
Already feeling impotent in his inability to help Harry, the letters threw him into a rage that threatened to boil over into something much, much worse when one of the volunteers helping to rebuild the castle – Fabien Barbary, the youngest member of the Board of St Mungo’s – caught Harry after his daily check-up with Madam Pomfrey.

to find the person Elliott told me about,” he said, roughly. “You’re everything to me. So it doesn’t matter what the prophecy says, or my mother, or the snakes on my lintel, or even the bloody Wild Magic. Understand? We’ll get through this, together.”
He’d been expecting to have to wait until the night of the Ministry ball to see Draco again, but as it happened, there was one particular trial that they were both expected to attend. Scrimgeour had set it for the week after Stan Shunpike’s (who, Hermione informed him with relish, had been acquitted with a resounding 40-0, and in a record ten minutes).
Pansy didn’t see any movement, but something touched her arm.
Draco would have smirked; he didn’t think he would ever understand how Potter could be so embarrassed talking about sex, when he was so completely unselfconscious in the act itself. But he was too close, breathing gently across Draco’s lips, his eyes searching Draco’s for Merlin knew what. Forgiveness? “I don’t think it’s significant,” he said, as steadily as he could. “Not if her theory is that it’s your arousal causing this. We were arguing when you created that illusion of the bed, remember? You were angry, not aroused.”
“All right, all right!” Harry said, holding up his hands in surrender. “Geez!” Ron just grinned at him, and Harry snorted. “Fine, I’ll leave you in peace.” He gathered up his books, shoving Ron’s shoulder as he went past.
try to pry. “About?”
.” The wound in his side began to knit together. She moved her wand up to his head.
Harry gasped in relief, sagging. “Oh Merlin,” he said, touching his neck with trembling fingers. Tears prickled at his eyes, and he scrubbed them away with his arm roughly. “Professor – Merlin,
That struck Harry as the kind of thing he and Ron would have found uproariously funny (and completely ridiculous) just a few weeks ago. “Where is Ron?” he asked. “Where’s Draco? What

them. Everyone here… I think I can erase their deaths. Bring them back.”
Ron and Hermione weren’t given a vote, much to Ron’s disgust. Hermione was just grateful. Harry was trapped inside Voldemort’s stronghold, possibly fighting for his life, probably already captured. Every instinct she had was telling her to storm the Manor’s wards, right now. But she also knew, logically, that Arthur was right. They needed to regroup. Narcissa, in particular, needed urgent medical treatment, and they had an obligation to return the little girl to her father, as soon as possible.
. He’s my Alpha.”
“She could only take so many days off school,” Draco said, dismissively. “I would have been fine.”
“You weren’t going to tell me,” he said, slowly. “You were going to sever our bond, leave me, and you were going to give me fucking

Harry’s eyes were bright with relief. “That actually makes a lot of sense. Thanks, Ron.”
stretched out in front of them, full of endless possibilities, and it was
Harry went very still.
“We’ll have to sort out a neutral meeting place,” Granger said. “And draw up party invitations. They’ll have to go out in few weeks, and we have to make sure none of them fall into any professors’ hands. I might be able to find some kind of charm for that.”
Dumbledore’s face was sympathetic. “I give you my word,” he said. “If he comes to me – or you – before he completes his task, I will give him sanctuary.” He didn’t sound as if he thought that was likely. “In the meantime, I have made a deal with Ms Skeeter. Mutual gain for both parties, eliminating the need for explanation, and guaranteeing her silence. Unfortunately, it requires a sacrifice on your part, Harry.”
