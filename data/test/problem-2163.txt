“Because…come off it, he’s Harry Potter,” Draco said. It was as close to an admission as he could muster, and Pansy must have known, because she suddenly leaned forward to wrap an arm around him.
Draco unfolded the bit of paper and saw that it was a receipt. “Eeylops Owl Emporium.” He looked up at Harry. “I don’t understand.”
“Well…” Draco racked his brain, trying desperately to recall a pleasant memory of Dobby. “The summer before our first year, we had family staying with us, from Strasbourg. They were awful. So I used to hide in the kitchen, and Dobby would give me sweets, little pastries, stuff like that. I would watch him cook.”
“Definitely not,” he assured him. “It's just that I, er…I like you. I like you quite a lot, actually.”
“I don’t know why Harry worked next to me in Potions, if that’s what you’re going to ask,” he said irritably. They set off in the direction of the greenhouses.
“I know,” she said, keeping pace with him. “It’s as though we’re all afraid of each other. I kept telling him he was being ridiculous. You don’t…” She looked askance at him. “You don’t mind, do you?”
“Last time we holidayed in Germany, we couldn’t have been older than seven or eight,” he heard Blaise say. “My mother was dating that awful man. God, I hated him. What was his name? The one with the beard.”
“You’re so insensitive!” she snapped. She pulled away from Draco and instead rounded on Blaise, who rolled his eyes. “Draco’s upset! He’s hurt!”
“I…” Somewhere in the haze of his memories, he did recall that day. It felt as though it had happened a decade ago.
When Potter finally moved, Draco sagged in relief. He didn’t want to discuss any of this. It was too raw, too tender, like poking a wound that had barely begun to heal. His own motivations were a mystery to him—every choice he had made, it seemed, was buried under layers of fear, of self-interest, of paranoia, of regret.
“That we’re together,” Draco said irritably. He knew by now that Harry just loved to make him say it aloud.
Rolling his eyes, Draco curled up against Harry’s chest. “Obviously. You’re very obtuse sometimes, you know. Haven’t you ever seen the way I look at you?”
“Over rubbish.” Abruptly, he stood up. He couldn’t bear to look at her. There was no reason to be angry—she was a good friend, he told himself, she was worried about him—but she was voicing very loudly the same thoughts he had been trying to suppress. “We’ve seen people
“Slughorn asked me to brew some Skele-Gro, for the Hospital Wing,” she said, gesturing towards the cauldrons. “Blaise has been horrible. I can’t stand working with him anymore. I told him to just leave it to me, that I could manage. But I've been so bogged down with homework that I ran out of time. So I told myself I would do it tonight, and then no one would be around to bother me, you know? And it was going alright, until…” She gave a sharp wail. “I don’t know what's happened!”
Draco suddenly felt an irrational anger overtake him. “That doesn’t matter, though, does it, Professor?” he asked, voice heavy with irony. “Who’s going to hire the son of Lucius Malfoy?”
“Well.” She took a moment to ponder his question, and then said, “You’ll have to remember again. And then work through them. That’s what my father did.”
The full force of what he had done struck him. Fearful, he turned towards Harry. “That’s it for him, isn’t it?” he asked. “For my father?”
“Well, then, I’m done playing around, too,” Draco said, summoning his courage. “Why won’t you let me touch you? Whatever the reason, just tell me. I can take it.”
Harry smiled as he placed his wand back onto the floor. “Right,” he said, suddenly serious. “You’ll tell me if it hurts.”
“From Hogsmeade? Why? What’s happened?” As Harry shined the light from his wand onto them, Draco dropped his broomstick so that he could steady Pansy. “Pansy, are you okay?”
Draco was in an unusually good mood when he arrived at breakfast the next morning. This meant, of course, that Pansy interrogated him the moment he sat down.
” Draco twisted his neck further, allowing Harry better access as he licked at the sensitive skin. “Fuck, do that again.” And so he did, sucking greedily at Draco’s neck.
“What?” Harry asked. The expression on his face, the rough quality of his voice, had Draco crumbling to pieces. He sounded lost. And the thought that
Draco nearly vibrated with outrage. There were loads of students at Hogwarts whose grades were worse than this—Finnigan’s marks in Transfiguration couldn’t be much better. But he doubted their Heads of House were threatening them with expulsion. “Will that be all, sir?”
“Careful,” Draco grumbled, picking up his own mouse and placing it on his other arm, away from Blaise’s.
wrote about you and your mother.” She hesitated, and then asked in a quiet voice, “How is she, by the way? Your mother?”
Lovegood gave him a grateful smile and then climbed up the marble staircase. As they watched her go, Harry said quietly, “It was me who suggested her to McGonagall. After everything that happened last year, I thought we could all use a laugh.”
“I don’t want to go through all of it,” Draco said. “But, fuck, I’d like to forget. It might be worth it.”
“This here…is that a hydra?” She leaned closer to the text, squinting. “Draco, look at this one. What is that?”
“It’s more than that,” Pansy insisted. “You know it is. Draco, for years you were on opposite sides. You can’t tell me—”
“Maybe you’ll actually use this pair, instead of slicing your fingers off in Potions,” Zabini said mildly. Draco made a face at him.
“I’m still surprised you’re with a Hufflepuff, Blaise,” he gently teased. “I didn’t know they were your type.”
George waved his hand dismissively before pulling Hermione in for a hug. “Forget it, forget it. Alright, Hermione?”
He was mollified quickly enough when Harry pulled him back into his arms, kissing along his neck. He reached down and took Draco in hand again, grinning against his skin as Draco gave a soft moan. Gently, Harry pressed Draco’s jaw upwards and then came to kiss along his throat, sucking at the sensitive flesh until Draco was writhing.
“But isn’t it true?” she asked, looking around at them for support. “Isn’t that what he always used to say?” Swelling up in outrage, she turned to Greg, who was watching her absently. “Isn’t it, Greg?”
Before he could stop himself, Draco laughed. The sound startled him just as much as it seemed to surprise everyone else—they turned to gape at him. Harry was chuckling. He was saved from having to explain himself when the crowd shifted and Luna Lovegood appeared.
“Well…now what?” Harry asked. “We’re so close to erasing your Mark…I know we are. Do we just try again?”
“Of course it matters,” Draco said, exasperated. “People are already weird enough around me. Half of them hate me, and the other half are terrified of me, as far as I can tell.”
He was never ready, not really, but he would never admit it. Still baffled, Draco settled onto the pillow, turning to face the giant oak tree. His Mark throbbed as Potter twisted the tip of his wind into his skin.
Draco closed his eyes, focusing on Harry’s fingers as they tucked a strand of hair behind his ear before going on to graze down his neck. Finally, he opened his eyes and took a deep breath. “Okay.”
At the angry look on Harry’s face, Draco changed topics. “And what about you? Going to miss the Weasleys?”
“All I’m saying is that there are so few pure-bloods left,” she sighed. “And Daphne’s one of them. Her parents will be furious if they find out.”
“And why was he out so late, then?” Draco asked hotly. He turned away and walked briskly down the path. Every step was agony—the slightest jostle set his arm to throbbing. But he refused to show Pansy that anything was amiss.
“Why’s he such a prude? I never thought Weasley of all people would be some sort of…some sort of bigot. What’s it matter to him?”
“For God’s sake,” Draco muttered in exasperation. “Why is everyone at this school barking mad? And what does he think he knows about me, anyway? He’s barely been here two weeks.”
“God, Delacour’s tough,” said Terry Boot, leaning towards him to be heard. “She watches everything like a hawk. But I thought her lesson at the study group was quite helpful, didn’t you?”
Draco lay back onto the blanket, drained. He ran his fingers through his hair as he tried to think. “Not really. Something about…sixth year. But I don’t know what.”
“Don’t be a prat,” Harry said, reaching down for him. Draco relented, sighing loudly as he took Harry’s hand.
“Don’t be ridiculous. Blaise’s mother is hosting. Can you imagine how rude it would be if we didn’t go?”
Draco gave a sharp cry at that, bucking against him. Harry smirked and took hold of his hips, dragging him somehow impossibly closer.
“You may not have noticed, sir, but the other students aren’t exactly keen on me this year,” he said idly.
Grinning, Harry reached out and tickled the enormous pear. To Draco’s amazement, it writhed and laughed before turning into a green handle. Harry pulled the door open and gestured for him to enter. The great, high-ceilinged room reminded him sharply of the kitchens at the Manor, although much larger: an incredible expanse of counters lined the walls, weighed down by stacks of pots and pans. At the centre of the room were tables identical to those in the Great Hall.
Potter’s eyes were closed. Draco saw him smile faintly. “Haven’t. Just thought a lot about it. All the ways I’ve wanted to touch you.”
The sneer returned to Blaise’s face. “Let’s try it, then. Ready?” Draco nodded. They paused, waiting for the other to make a move, when Blaise whipped his wand forward. Draco reacted a fraction too late; his wand flew from his hand, soaring towards Blaise. He caught it, grinning slyly.
teaching. And I think we learn something about ourselves, too.” He looked as though he wanted to say more, but the first few students had wandered into the Great Hall. “Anyway, you’re up, boys. Best of luck.”
Furious, Draco made to push past him back into the pub, but Potter gripped his arm. Draco struggled against him, ripping his arm from Potter’s grasp. He snarled, but Potter didn’t seem angry—he merely stared at him, as though he had never seen him properly before.
“I’m fine,” he said. Before Harry could notice his hands trembling, he pressed them against the table, urging them to stop.
In Transfiguration, he sat next to Greg, who he only ever saw at meals and in class anymore. They were supposed to be working together on turning a common lizard into an iguana, though they weren’t having much luck. Draco leaned forward, squinting at it, and said, “It looks a bit bigger, doesn’t it?” Goyle gave a noncommittal grunt.
a good teacher, Draco.” He snorted. “I’m being serious. I’ve learned loads from you this year. We all have. You’re not the most…er…nurturing person, but look how far everyone’s come thanks to you. Last week, the way you explained nonverbal Switching Spells to me…I finally got it. You make me feel like I can actually manage it.”
They were quiet for a moment, Draco looking up at the canopy above them, Potter still studying the Mark. “Is it weird?” Potter asked. He spoke so quietly that Draco almost didn’t hear him. “Not being able to remember?”
Harry glanced down at his wand and then back up at his face. Draco couldn’t make out his expression. “You wouldn’t. I know you.”
Potter was suddenly very occupied with scrubbing his hands. Recognizing his cue to leave, Draco scurried upstairs to his bedroom, crawling into bed and trying to ignore the voice in his head whispering
desperate. Harry introduced a third finger, and Draco was able to relax now, to take him in easily. The burn was sweet, soothing. He looked down at Harry, whose lips were parted, whose eyes were trained on his face as though he couldn’t bear to miss a single moment.
He shook his head. “No. I don’t.” The sombre tilt of his mouth was proof enough that he meant what he said.
An awkward silence stretched between them. Draco was tired of these conversations. They never led anywhere. Why couldn’t they understand that he wanted to be left alone?
“Can you…” He felt himself blushing. “I don’t know how to cast a Patronus. A corporeal one. And I want to learn before the lesson on Thursday."
“Of course.” He rolled back Draco’s sleeve, pulling it away from his Mark so as not to graze the sensitive skin. “How does it feel?”
These were the moments when Draco was grateful for the training he had received under his father’s tutelage. He kept his face carefully disinterested, following the two girls as they wound up the path. In a bored tone, he asked, “What do you mean?”
“I know, but they’re still angry. And now they’re on her case about a bunch of other rubbish, like only sitting four N.E.W.T.s. Please? It’ll be my Christmas gift.”
“Stupid bird,” Draco groaned, ripping the scroll off its leg. “Go on! Go!” But the eagle owl refused; finally finding its footing, it pecked angrily at Draco’s hands.
“Why can’t we just be in the greenhouses like normal?” Pansy snapped, pushing her hair out of her face. “This is so stupid.”
At the look on Harry’s face, Ron muttered, “Come on, let’s get out of here.” They wove their way towards the apothecary, where Hermione refreshed her potions supplies. It was wonderfully cool and dark inside the little shop, and mostly empty—no doubt thanks to the lingering smell of rotting eggs and cabbage. Still, it was a nice reprieve from the busy street, where people gawked at them and asked for autographs. Most of the shopkeepers were used to Harry’s presence by now; he had spent the better part of the summer in Diagon Alley. But he had not been prepared for the fresh crowds of students and parents, all craning their necks to get a look at him.
“Winky…it’s a long story.” Harry took a bite of his sandwich, chewing thoughtfully. “She was sacked, and then she met Dobby. They came to Hogwarts together. She was really upset at first, but she’s come around.” In a low voice, he said, “Don’t mention Dobby to her, though. She cries every time we talk about him.”
“Why’s Potter always staring at you, Malfoy?” Nott asked him one evening as they lounged in the common room. Nott and Zabini were playing a game of chess while Draco sat on the sofa with Pansy, Millicent, and Daphne. They were supposed to be revising their Charms homework, but they were too tired. It had been a long week.
Daphne blushed. “Well, last weekend he invited me out to Greenhouse One with him. He’s been sketching Moondew for a while now. So I went, and, er…”
Hi everyone, I hope you enjoyed this final part of the fic. Your support has been so wonderful, and has really made this story a pleasure to write. There's also now a playlist for the fic! You can find it at:
All day Friday, Pansy, Daphne, and Millicent nattered on about the trip to Hogsmeade. McGonagall had gotten wind of their plans somehow, and at dinner, she sternly reminded them to make good choices and to avoid disrupting the younger students. The eighth years tittered throughout her lecture. Draco had given in to Pansy’s nagging and agreed to come—but only for an hour. By the time they left the castle and headed for Hogsmeade, it was growing dark, and the sun had nearly set. Nott insisted that they visit Honeydukes first so that he could stock up on sugar quills and toffees. The shop was as busy as ever: children trailing after their parents, demanding sweets; people squeezing through the aisles to get to their confectionaries of choice; and a large group of witches who stood giggling over a barrel of Every Flavoured Beans. Draco wove through the stacks of sweets, pausing to peruse a bucket of Fizzing Whizzbees. He was nervous, not least of all because he risked coming face-to-face with Madam Rosmerta. There was also the question of whether the other eighth years were actually willing to have a drink with the Slytherins, something Draco doubted very much. At last, Nott made his purchases and they headed for the Three Broomsticks.
“Here, have more.” Harry pushed the platter towards him. “And, yeah, when I can. It’s nice to get away. No one else comes here.”
He would have happily been sucked into the floor if it meant he didn’t have to have this conversation, especially in front of Harry and his friends. “Er. Thanks.”
Potter rested his forehead against Draco’s again, his eyes fluttering shut. Draco was finding it difficult to concentrate on remaining upright when Potter was busy stroking them together like that.
“Because you refuse to practice until I’ve spent the morning nagging you.” Around and around in the same circle they went.
“You drove me mad…I couldn’t figure out where you were going, what you were doing. It wasn’t until Dobby told me you were on the seventh floor that I realized you were in the Room of Requirement.”
When Draco nodded, he reached over for his wand. Once Harry had sorted them out, Draco crawled beneath the sheets, reveling in the feel of silk against his limbs. Harry climbed in after him, pulling Draco against his chest in what was soon becoming their usual position. It was very warm under the blankets, and very cozy, and soon Draco felt himself falling asleep.
“I’m going to ask you something,” Harry said quietly. Draco noticed that his eyes were trained on his lips. “And you need to be honest with me.”
“My hero.” His sarcasm wasn't very biting as Harry kissed along his neck. Still, he managed to ask, “You’re insatiable, aren’t you?”
He found her in her dormitory, studying at her little wooden desk. As he entered the large, empty room, Draco suddenly stopped short as a pang of sympathy gripped him. He had been so wrapped up in his own troubles that he hadn’t considered how difficult it must be for Pansy, who had no one to share a room with this year.
“No,” Draco said truthfully. He watched as his father stumbled towards the door. “I think things are settled between us now. And I’m…I’m done. I’m just…done.”
Sighing irritably, Proudfoot raised his wand again. “I do regret this. But you’re leaving me no other option.”
“You have no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco said. Avoiding their gazes, he rolled his quill between his fingers, urging himself to stay calm. He didn’t want to shout at them again. Of course, that wasn’t easy when they insisted on prying.
the sleeves of his navy jumper pushed up to his elbows, one foot bouncing against the floor, a little smile on his face as he watched Draco eat. At that moment, Draco was very glad that Harry—according to Severus—had always been a lousy Occlumens.
Theo and Lavender stood up to hug them goodbye. Even Blaise, who appeared to be quite drunk, pulled himself to his feet and clasped their hands. “Thanks for coming,” he said. “I know my mother will be happy. She’s been in a right mood ever since that idiot broke things off with her…”
“Draco thinks he’s better than us,” Pansy said. “He practically told me so. And he warned me off you, Theo. Because you still believe in pure-blood supremacy.”
“I have an essay to finish,” he said, the lie coming to him easily. “What about you? Why aren’t you at Hogsmeade?”
you two got up to something one night in sixth year. After exams, I was so shocked that you bothered to show up—we’d hardly seen you that year. You got spectacularly drunk, I
“Alright, alright,” he muttered, terrified in the face of her tears. “What’s the last thing you did before...it went wrong?”
“Stay still,” Potter murmured, pressing his wand deep into Draco’s skin. His Mark absolutely ached. As best he could, Draco steadied himself, clenching his jaw in a refusal to shout out. Every part of his body was sore, as though his very bones were being pulled taut. Finally, Potter eased off, rubbing the Mark with his thumb as though trying to soothe him.
Draco didn’t know what to say. That sharp, crushing panic was starting to seep back in. Catching the look on his face, Harry reached out and held his hand. “Relax. It’s okay.”
Draco laughed, and that laugh did all sorts of things to him. Made him giddy. Made him weak. “You want me to fuck your mouth, is it? That’s what you want?”
“I’m fine. Really, I’m fine. Please, get to bed, you’re going to wake everyone up.” He pulled her towards the staircase leading up to the girls’ dormitory, purposely avoiding the others’ stares. “Go on. Up to bed.”
Draco gave a heavy sigh. “I haven’t really thought much about it. I guess I’ll travel a bit. We have a lot of family in France, in Iberia…I don’t think any of them will really want me staying with them, but who knows…”
“You’ll manage on your own,” Draco assured her. “I want to spend some time with my mother, you know. I haven’t seen her in a while.”
"And remember when you told Millicent that Marcus Flint had a crush on her? And she was mooning over him for weeks?”
All three of them looked up as Harry came to stand beside Blaise, hands in his pockets. In sharp contrast to Pansy, who was gaping up at him, flabbergasted, Harry had an easy smile on his face. When nobody spoke, Harry said again, “I’ll go with you. To see Slughorn.”
“Right. I know.” Harry heaved a big sigh. “They didn’t really like magic much, though. My Uncle Vernon didn’t want to take me in, but my Aunt Petunia did. Dumbledore left her a letter, explaining that so long as I lived with them, the magical protection my mother gave me—the protection that kept me safe from Voldemort—would stay intact.”
“Be good,” Potter warned. And with that, he slid back down to his earlier spot on Draco’s legs. He was mortified when he realized that his cock was already wet, but Potter smiled wickedly and took him in hand. His grip was rough as he stroked, watching Draco’s face intently. Draco didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing his reactions, and so he turned away, bringing his arms up to partially cover his face. At once, Potter reached up and pulled his arms away, his other hand still working Draco’s cock. Draco keened at that, oddly taken by the thought that Potter wanted so badly to see him. Apparently pleased, Potter leaned down and dragged his tongue from the base of Draco’s cock up to the head. The sight was as lewd as anything Draco could imagine. Potter continued to lap at his cock, occasionally swiping his thumb over the slit. Only once or twice did he take it entirely in his mouth—though Draco tried to push his head down, Potter would only laugh and pull away, returning to lick along the sides. It was maddening.
“Oh, please don’t fight,” Daphne said, reaching out to hold Pansy’s hand. “I’m sure it was just a misunderstanding. Everyone’s so tense, lately, with all this homework to get through.”
As the table began to discuss which dishes they should order for dinner, Draco whispered to Harry, “That was a bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?”
“First cousin once removed,” Draco muttered. He shifted nervously at the incredulous look on Kreacher’s face.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry said. His voice sounded faint, distant. “It was bad. I remember. My scar hurt. And I could see how furious he was…”
It seemed that even the Ravenclaws were considerably behind on the seventh-year curriculum. According to Delacour, their N.E.W.T.s would focus on conjuration in particular, but few among them felt confident in the more advanced conjurations she described.
“I hope not.” Potter looked down at the Mark; Draco didn’t dare. The sight might make him sick again. “Hermione said we don’t have to see
Harry chuckled as Draco stepped into the hallway and gently shut the door. It was eerily silent in the house. As quietly as he could, he entered the bathroom, lighting a single candle on the vanity. As he stripped off his dress robes and stepped into the shower, he felt distinctly ill at ease. He had only been gone for a few months, but the Manor was foreign to him. Under the hot spray of water, he reflected on the memories twisted together in the very walls of the house: happier times with his parents, with his family, with his friends who would visit over the summer. And then unhappy times when his father’s Mark had begun to burn, and then when Voldemort had arrived, making his presence known in every last inch of space. For a moment, Draco swayed; his Mark pulsed. He focused on lathering his hair and rinsing it, but it was no use. Without the distraction of Harry, and his nervousness around his mother, Draco was exposed to the onslaught of memories as they tumbled forth: Voldemort shrieking as he punished them for letting Potter go…Shrieks, deafening shrieks, as the Death Eaters punished another victim…Nagini’s hisses as she slithered through the house….
When he gave her a shrewd smile, she squealed again. “I knew it! I knew it! And? How far did it go?”
He thought that would be the end of McGonagall’s ridiculous internship scheme. And it seemed as though they were content to leave him alone, until that Friday during his Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Proudfoot turned out to be a stern, no-nonsense teacher. Within seconds, he had them on their feet practicing defensive spells with a partner. He paced along the students, correcting, guiding, and offering advice. Draco was paired with Pansy, and he spent much of the lesson explaining to her how to cast a nonverbal Shield Charm. He had expected Proudfoot to avoid him, as most of the other teachers did, but he eventually made his way over to them. Draco stiffened as Proudfoot approached, arms crossed.
Pansy was looking at him apprehensively. “It’s okay, Draco,” she said, leaning forward so that he could hear her. When he didn’t answer, she reached for a pitcher and poured out some firewhisky for their side of the table. It seemed that most of the eighth years were there: sitting directly across from the Slytherins were the Gryffindors; on the left side of the table were the Ravenclaws; and along the right side, the Hufflepuffs. Most everyone seemed in high spirits; the Ravenclaws were engaged in a boisterous debate regarding the merits of brass versus copper cauldrons. He was surprised to find that the Slytherins were welcomed, if not warmly, then at least politely. Sue Li had started up a conversation with Daphne, and Macmillan called out to Nott, reminding him of their ongoing wager regarding the upcoming Quidditch match.
Draco was quiet as he watched Harper yell at the Slytherin Beaters, who were utterly hopeless. One of them had managed to slam a Bludger into the other, setting off a massive argument as the other players begged them to stop.
Greg shrugged him off. “Just be careful.” With that, he shuffled out of the room, leaving Draco in a state of pure terror. He had no idea if he could trust Greg or not. God, how could he have been so stupid? This was all a mistake. If they got caught, if people found out he was shagging Harry Potter, they would hate him more than they already did. He would be accused of cursing Potter, of threatening him, of feeding him a Love Potion. His father’s position would become even more precarious. As these thoughts raced through his mind, he almost didn’t hear Delacour when she called his name. Standing in the doorway, she asked him again, “Monsieur Malfoy? Are you coming?”
“Well, I didn’t have the grades to sit my N.E.W.T.s in Potions,” she said. “But I told Slughorn what I was thinking. And he knows a few people on the Board of Directors.”
“Because you aren’t subtle at all,” Draco complained. He watched as the small dot labeled ‘Mrs. Norris’ slunk down the fifth-floor corridor. Nodding at the Marauder’s map, Draco said, “Show me again how to wipe it.”
It was very odd, watching the Slytherin team walk out onto the field while he was seated in the stands. But he told himself he didn’t mind. Draco’s stomach gave a painful lurch as he recalled the last time he had been on a broomstick—he could still remember the smell of burning flesh, Vincent’s inhuman screams. Involuntarily, his hands curled into fists.
“And what about the castle?” Lavender asked, looking around at them. “Have they managed to repair it?”
Draco growled with impatience. At long last, Harry crawled on top of him. He looked nervous. “If it hurts—”
Harry rose to his feet and took out his wand. “Right…a Patronus. You already know the theory, of course.” Draco nodded. “We just need to think of a happy enough memory.” Harry gave him a wry smile and said, “We could make one up now, if you like.”
Pansy choked on her porridge. Laughing, Draco pounded her back. He watched as Blaise winked in Whitby’s direction one last time.
“There’s an opening at the Ministry,” he said. “Magical Law Enforcement. They need someone to brew potions, you know, Polyjuice and Veritaserum, stuff like that. Thought I’d put your name forward.”
Draco rolled his eyes. The mouse was scurrying down the side of his textbook and onto the desk. Pulling back his elbow, Draco granted it access to the parchment on which he had been writing his notes. It started to nibble the corner. “Are you hungry?” he murmured, reaching out to stroke it. Its short, bristly hairs were rough against his fingers.
“I get so stressed, I don’t know why,” said Potter. “Any other time, with verbal magic, I’m pretty confident. But for some reason, when it comes to casting nonverbally, I get so tense. Like I know it’s not going to work out before I even start.”
“Fine, I guess. I don’t really hear from them now. We tend to operate under the assumption that no news is good news.”
Draco’s hands roamed along the counter, grappling for purchase—blindly, he reached up for a cupboard door. When Potter suddenly dragged his thumb over the tip of Draco’s cock, swiping through the pre-cum that had accumulated there, he gasped and gave a start. There was a crackling sound as he nearly pulled the cupboard door off its hinges. Potter laughed.
After a while, Potter said, “I don’t really…I dunno. I think we got together because we were supposed to, because, you know, the Weasleys, they’re like my family. And Ron’s my best mate. But Ron, actually, he’s the biggest problem.”
He couldn’t do this anymore. “Right. Okay. Well…just keep practicing. It’s really…really important,” he finished lamely.
"I know it must be difficult. If my parents…I mean, not that I really get along with them…but I know I’d be worried. I think you’re being very brave about it.” When he said nothing, she added, “I know Theo and Blaise like to tease, but, well…try to ignore them if you can.”
“I’m hurt, Draco,” Zabini quipped. He was speaking in a low voice that Draco hoped the others couldn’t hear. “You go sniffing around the Hufflepuffs’ dorms before coming to me?” When he said nothing, Zabini added, “I seem to distinctly remember a night back in sixth year…maybe you’ve forgotten…”
“Threw me in the dungeons for a week.” He looked over at Harry, who was staring at him in horror, and laughed. “I’m joking! Of course she didn’t put me in the dungeons. She just yelled a lot. My father was out in the gardens checking everything over, so we managed to clean it up before he came back in. Had to open every window in the Manor.”
They were interrupted as Blaise and Pansy returned with several bottles of firewhisky. Once again, they shuffled to make room. Weasley scowled as Blaise passed him a drink.
Instead, Harry looked up at him fiercely, a strange scowl on his face. Then, very slowly, he leaned forward and pressed his lips against Draco’s Mark. His Mark didn’t burn; it didn’t bother him at all. Instead, watching as Harry tenderly kissed his Mark, Draco felt himself melting. The sight was in turns intimate and erotic.
“Drop it, Pansy,” Blaise advised her. He was slathering jam onto a thick slice of toast, shaking his head at their bickering. “You can’t tell people when to read their own post, for God’s sake.”
as the trainers fell. Forcing himself not to get frustrated, he tried again; the key was to leave some small part of his consciousness still focused on the levitation spell while the bulk of his mind strayed elsewhere.
“You could probably convince me.” He must not have noticed the startled look on Draco’s face; casual as ever, he reached out and said, “I’m going to check your Mark. Alright?”
“Sometimes I do. It’s so stable, you know? If you toe the line, you’re set for life. But then there’s this other part of me that wants to tell everyone to sod off and just do whatever I want.” She lowered her voice and leaned towards him conspiratorially. “There’s this music school in Dublin, right, and they only accept top students. You have to have Outstanding on your music N.E.WT. But I want to go
Draco’s mother had tricked him again—Wednesday morning, her eagle owl swept across the Slytherin table, dropping a roll of parchment neatly on his lap. He could not have imagined a worst way to sour his already miserable mood. The nightmares that had haunted him over the summer were back with a vengeance: dark, shifting rooms, bright flashes of green light, and painfully cold fingers trailing across his cheeks. After several nights of tossing and turning, he was exhausted.
! What a fucking coward. And Gryffindors are always going on about honour and bravery and all that shit.”
“Wait.” Draco massaged his temples; a headache had started to erupt. “How did you get into the Gryffindor common room?”
“Why are you taking Arithmancy, then?” he asked moodily. He was still irritated with what’s-his-name.
A moment of hesitation, and then Harry’s fingers were back again, warm and wet. They grazed along the curve of his arse, raising goosebumps on Draco’s flesh. He surprised himself by rocking his hips up to meet Harry’s touch, deeply stirred by the thought of someone touching him
Draco realized, with a start, that Harry was going to leave another mark on his neck. He melted at the thought, nearly going limp in Harry’s arms as he let out a little cry. All the blood rushed to his cock as he thought of Harry
Draco eased out of the memory as though awakening from a dream. Ollivander’s dirty, broken face disappeared as he blinked up at the sky.
“Your father,” he said curtly, “is an old friend of mine. Many years ago, he helped me when I was in a difficult situation. Now I’m repaying the favour.”
At first, Draco wasn’t sure what Potter was referring to. Glancing over, he saw Potter reaching for his arm. “I don’t know why you bother to ask,” he muttered, looking away as he stretched his arm out onto Potter’s lap.
Draco was at a loss for words. His heart sped up when Potter gave him a lopsided smile. He knew, vaguely, what was happening, and he cursed himself for it. Pushing the thought from his mind, Draco jumped up so suddenly that Potter startled.
echoing throughout the castle, and then the Room of Requirement…feeling certain he was going to die in the unimaginable heat, and then wondering if perhaps it wouldn’t be so horrible, dying…
Potter hummed to himself. Slowly, he pressed the tip of his wand into Draco’s arm. It was very difficult to hold still as a fresh wave of pain burst from his Mark, but he managed.
“Yeah. I mean…he’s afraid for his father. He reckons they plan to use the Dementor’s Kiss on him, as well.”
“I know Grimmauld Place,” Draco said. “I’ve never been—I don’t think anyone could get in, when Sirius was in Azkaban—but I’ve heard of it. It belonged to my Great-Aunt Walburga.”
He wanted to tell Potter that he looked incredible, too: somewhere along the line he had taken his glasses off, allowing Draco to see his bright green eyes clearly. His face was flushed, and his lips were slick and red. He could see the bulge in Potter’s jeans, and he felt mad with the need to touch him. But Potter, as though reading his thoughts, made his way back down to Draco’s cock. He trailed his fingers up and down, up and down, with just enough pressure to send shivers through him.
Was it so odd, to notice these things? It was normal, he had told himself stubbornly over the years. Everyone
Draco quickly drew his hand into the folds of his winter cloak and tucked the package into a pocket lining the fur interior. Rochefort reached into the barrel and scooped up some Floo Powder. He let it run through his fingers, sighed, and then moved on down the aisle. As he shuffled away, two Gryffindor boys pushed towards the Floo barrel. He heard one of them say, “My mum asked me to get some for her. Reckon ten Sickles’ worth should be enough?”
“The problem is, if you find it,” Harry whispered, looking down at Draco’s parted lips, “I’ll never be able to keep my hands off you.”
“Can’t.” Although his heart was pounding, Draco set his shoulders back and raised his nose in as haughty a manner as he could manage. “I broke it.”
Next to him, Blaise was cackling. Half of the Slytherin box jumped up as Pritchard blocked Robins from scoring.
“Tired. Just so, so tired.” Everything seemed to weigh down on him all at once: the bizarre, complicated emotions he felt whenever he was around Harry; his terrible relationship with his parents; the sharp pains emanating from his arm; and, at the back of his mind, the grief and regret that had become his constant companions.
Potter rolled his eyes. Furious, Draco pushed away from the table and walked to the edge of the garden. Unfortunately, he couldn’t go far—the boundaries of their wards extended around the perimeter of the lawn, and so he couldn’t step past the garden’s stone paving. Around them were nearly identical Airey houses, set closely together and fitted with worn shiplap panels. While the wards rendered them undetectable to their Muggle neighbours, they could still see out of the invisible bubble ensconcing them, and Draco spent most of his evenings watching the Muggles as they went about their daily lives. Standing at the edge of the garden now, Draco forced himself to take a deep breath as he watched a middle-aged man across the street push something Potter had called a lawnmower. It was rather interesting, how Muggles managed to get on without magic.
“Well…” Harry placed his gloves on the bench next to him. He sat back and looked out at the field. “I sort of forgot, really. It mostly happened over the summer. And I thought…” He took a deep breath, and then said, “After the Battle, Pomfrey brought it up with us. She’s the one who said we should go, since we’d been through, you know…really awful things.”
Potter took another deep breath. “Right,” said Draco. “Now just keep repeating the spell to yourself. Visualize your wand lighting up. Don’t get frustrated.” A few moments passed, and Draco thought he could see the tip of Potter’s wand glowing.
Pritchard was saying something he couldn’t hear. Potter looked over at Draco, caught sight of his face, and then stepped between the Slytherins and Gryffindors angrily. “You’re all being childish,” he shouted. “I’m tired of this. Get back into your pairs. Gryffindors, go down to the end of the line, next to Ravenclaw. Now.”
“You know what’s sad?” Draco said. His throat was still raw, but he felt the urgent need to say this. “What we just saw—at the Manor—that’s one of the few things I did that wasn’t absolutely terrible. And I didn’t even
“I’m not, Draco,” Pansy insisted. “What I’m saying is, what good does it do, to be angry at your mother? What does it change?”
“Draco!” Daphne’s face was red as she sauntered towards him. “Are you alright, Draco? I’ve been so worried about you. You should have come out with us tonight.”
Draco struggled to take a breath. He felt as though he was watching the scene unfold from somewhere above them; surely, it wasn’t possible that he was about to defy his father so ruthlessly. “The Portkey,” he started before his voice seized up.
Again, Potter shook his head. He was pulling off his shirt. Draco helped him, lifting the material past Potter’s arms and casting it aside. He swallowed hard. Potter was thin, sinewy, tanned.
Very pleased with himself, Harry grinned, taking in the sound of Draco’s panting. He was spent. It was impossible to imagine how he might find the strength to drag himself up onto the bed. But he needn’t have worried, because Draco was pulling him up, supporting him as they clambered onto the mattress.
Draco nodded stiffly. The pain he felt whenever he thought of Severus was familiar enough, but it stung all the same. “You wanted to see me, sir?”
Harry took a step forward. Panicked, Draco pulled out his wand, training it at Harry’s feet. “Don’t make me hex you. Please. Don’t make me.”
“I was nervous,” Harry admitted. “I’ve been nervous for weeks. I didn’t want to meet him alone. I knew I’d be less anxious, if you were here.”
Diagon Alley was overflowing. Even though Yuletide was only two weeks away, it had not yet properly snowed. Pansy took this as a personal attack—“It has to be a white Christmas!” she whined, over and over, as though Draco and Blaise could change the weather. Instead, they enjoyed an unseasonably bright day; the brisk breeze was the only reminder that they were now firmly in December. All sorts of vendors lined the cobblestoned streets, hawking their wares: a tall, thin man selling roasted chestnuts, three sickles a scoop; an irritable-looking witch who was attempting to subdue the bunches of mistletoe singing merrily from her basket; a young woman who must have been about their age, selling hot chocolate and apple cider. Draco bought them each a cup of steaming cider, and it was very good, he thought, sipping happily as they made their way to Gringotts. They were supposed to meet Theo and Lavender.
“Let’s get back,” he said briskly. “I have a paper to finish.” Before Potter could reply, he turned away and waited by the edge of the clearing, telling himself to get a grip. Hoping Potter wouldn’t notice, he gently pressed the pads of his fingers against his throat, feeling for his pulse. It was racing.
“Don’t go.” If they hadn’t been so close, Draco would not have heard him—Potter barely mouthed the words.
Snarling, he ripped himself away. Their sudden separation caused Potter to gasp as though he had been drenched with cold water. They sat there scowling at each other.
“Not at all! You two go ahead. I need to revise this section, anyway.” She smiled encouragingly at Draco, who rolled his eyes and followed Harry. They made their way to his usual spot in the Reference Section.
“Let the magic go from your mind down your arm…past your wrist…into your hand, through your fingers…down to the tip of your wand…”
“She’s not giving herself proper credit.” Theo sat up straighter in his chair. “It can take hours, getting through these applications. And you have to check everything—some of them are trying to set up networks in Muggle homes, you know, or places they haven’t got permission to enter. You have to be really careful. And then if you reject them, they can appeal, and that’s a whole other process…”
Harry opened his mouth to protest but Draco turned away. Once again, he felt a lump in his throat—he was so sick of crying, so exasperated with himself for being weak. He returned to the table where Daphne was sitting, muttering runes to herself as she hid the translations with her hand.
“Baddock, yes…and he’s passed it to Vaisey…Avem Vaisey. He’s in my Charms class this year. Always keeps to himself, though…”
“He wanted to turn me in to the Ministry." Addressing Daphne, he said, “My father asked me to help him escape when we found out they were planning to use the Dementor's Kiss. But I've decided to stop helping him…that’s why we spoke tonight, I was trying to tell him, but anyway…”
Theo shook his head. “No, not at all. Lots of people only have their O.W.L.s, and anyway, with the partial credits we got…” Catching sight of the look on Pansy’s face, he said hastily, “But you should finish out the year! It’s really important.”
Callidus held out his leg, allowing Harry to fasten the envelopes with a bit of string. He nipped at Draco’s finger affectionately before gliding out into the night. They watched in silence as he soared across the grounds, quickly disappearing into the dark sky.
“I understand it must be difficult, jumping back into classes after the events of last year,” Slughorn muttered. He seemed as uncomfortable as Draco felt. “No doubt, a shock to us all…but you’ve always been a good student. I have to admit, I myself have been surprised at your work.”
Draco read the note several times. Two thousand Galleons? Why on earth did his father need two thousand Galleons? To his knowledge, his parents had never withdrawn money from his account. He had assumed they needed assistance in paying his tuition, but he doubted very much that tuition cost anywhere close to two thousand Galleons a year. Otherwise, how would the Weasleys be able to afford sending their entire brood? He sat back and stared at the Gringotts owl, who was drinking from his goblet. Unsure of what else to do, he found a quill at the bottom of his satchel, signed his name and scribbled the date, and then stuffed the note back into the envelope. The owl stuck out its right leg as Draco reattached the parchment.
“Meaning there might be gaps in your memory, now, and your mind doesn’t know how to sort it out,” Potter said. “It’s sort of like…Hermione said your memory is a big web, right? A spider web. When we take out a string, the problem is, that string is connected to lots of other ones. So let’s say you have a memory about, er…” Draco braced himself, expecting Potter to bring up some horrible event from the past. Instead, he said, “Dinner tonight. Well, that memory is connected with a bunch of other ones, right? Every time you’ve been into the Great Hall, you form a new memory. If you had pudding, then all the other times you’ve had pudding are connected to that memory, too. If you talked to, I dunno, Parkinson, or Zabini, that memory connects to all the other times you’ve talked to them.”
he was right there, taking Draco into his arms so tenderly that his heart absolutely ached. Draco kissed him back, forgetting all at once that he was supposed to be angry, supposed to be protecting himself. He was shaking, but not from fear. Or perhaps it
“Loads of times.” He shrugged. “You need a happy memory, right? And…I guess I don't have anything good enough.”
“But Draco, what if the cards are right?” Pansy asked. She was already shuffling her deck again. “What if there’s a big decision coming up? Or you’re about to meet your soulmate? Don’t you want to know?”
“What?” Draco looked up at his anxious face. “I don’t know. It’s bloody cold out, in case you hadn’t noticed.”
“This one’s for Hermione, and this is for Ron,” Harry said, pulling two rather rumpled envelopes from his back pocket. “They’re both at the Burrow, anyway.”
They stood in silence for a moment, appraising each other, when finally, Harry said, “I know what happened at the hearing. Yesterday night, I sort of…heard what they were planning. And I figured, unless Shacklebolt managed to change most of their minds before today, then…” He took a deep breath, and then finished lamely, “It doesn’t look good.”
Depleted as he was, Draco didn’t have the wherewithal to suppress his resentment. “Really, Potter? Tell me, if you had something like this on your arm, would you want to wait?”
“Go on, Draco,” Goldstein laughed as he finished off his treacle tart. “I was outside earlier—it’s not too cold.”
“Of all the things…the Headmistress will have my head,” he heard Slughorn cry as he sped down the corridor and up the stairs to the entrance hall. He pushed past the double doors and inhaled deeply as the cool air hit his face. His aunt’s harsh, manic face still haunted him and so he walked, bent against the wind, hands deep in his pockets. He could have done a simple Warming Charm, but the cold cut through his memories and seemed to dissipate them. He wound his way around the lake, watching as the wind whipped up the rough water. He knew classes had ended when he heard laughter coming from the castle—looking over, he saw a few students streaming out onto the grounds, no doubt looking to enjoy some fresh air before nightfall. As the sun started to set and everyone else went back in for dinner, Draco sat by the lake. The ground was hard and cold, and so he relented and cast a Warming Charm. By now his thoughts had slowed, but he still couldn’t bring himself to head back to the castle. He was contemplating whether or not he could sleep outside under the stars, with the cool air to comfort him—whether that would be safe, whether anyone would even notice or care—when he heard someone walking up behind him.
“Alright, Blaise? Draco?” Theo reached out and clasped their hands. The sight of him was startling: the last time they had seen each other was over the summer, as Draco attended his own hearings and Theo accompanied his father to his. He had been thin and gaunt back then. But now, he greeted them with an easy smile. Tall as ever, he stooped down to kiss Pansy’s cheek before pulling out a chair for her.
“What! And you two have managed to just go on as friends, as though nothing happened? It isn't weird at all?”
Greg had been placed in an incredibly dull position in a lower-ranking office. Privately, Draco suspected that the placement was a punishment, while also serving to keep him from causing any trouble. While Harry had also spoken at Greg’s hearing, the fact remained that he had cursed several students in their seventh year at Hogwarts, and that he and his father had not switched allegiances at the end. It was a wonder they had managed to find a placement for him at the Ministry. Perhaps Harry had put in a word for him. Glancing over at the Gryffindor table, Draco studied Harry as he spoke animatedly with the girl Weasley. Before he could stop himself, jealousy reared angrily in his chest. He looked back down at his bowl, urging himself to take a bite, but now he felt sicker than ever.
“I want to taste you,” Harry said at once, any inhibitions he might have had now long gone. “Please, I want you in my mouth. I need you in my mouth.”
“But that would be perfect!” Pansy gasped. She turned to face Theo as though it was the cleverest idea she had ever heard. “Draco is
—both pleased and dismayed him. In his confusion, he chose once again to lash out. “Great. First rule of being my friend: leave me the fuck alone.”
Dismissed, Draco swept out of Proudfoot’s office and made his way to the entrance hall. That familiar feeling of panic was settling in. As he pushed his way out the double doors, the sting of cold air on his face was comforting. His plan had been to settle into his usual spot by the lake and study. But his conversation with Proudfoot had rattled him, and for the first time since returning to Hogwarts, he desperately wanted to fly. He couldn’t be bothered going back to his dorm for his broom—didn’t want to run into someone he knew, didn’t want to pretend to listen to their small talk—and so Draco traipsed down to the broomshed. Rifling through the school brooms, he selected an old Comet. He headed out to the pitch, mounted the broom, and pushed off—and instantly, his mind cleared. The Comet wasn’t very fast and veered to the right, but Draco leaned forward, urging it on as he looped the pitch. He wondered, briefly, if he would be in trouble should any teachers spot him—free periods were meant for studying, after all. But he decided he didn’t care. He had forgotten the freedom he felt while flying. Hovering mid-air, he surveyed the grounds, watching as Hagrid trudged through the vegetable patch.
“Oh, he’s alright. Always getting fouls, though. Ravenclaw’s got a good Captain this year. Bradley, isn’t it? He’s always had a good build for a Chaser.”
“How cool would it be to work for the Department of Mysteries, though?” Nott suggested. “I’ve heard they’re studying all kinds of things in there—time, death, who knows what else.”
Potter stepped forward and reached for Draco’s pocket. For a moment, he panicked, thinking Potter was going to take his wand, but instead he slid the Galleons into his pocket. Long after the last coin had slipped through his fingers, Potter stood there, their chests nearly touching, his hand brushing Draco’s hip.
“We shouldn’t,” Draco muttered, holding Blaise’s arms as though meaning to push him away. Ignoring him, Zabini pressed their lips together. There was something not quite right—a voice in the back of Draco’s head told him that it wasn’t Harry, and it wasn’t right if it wasn’t Harry—but he shoved that voice away and, in defiance, drew Zabini closer. That raw, unbridled anxiety was creeping up in his chest again, but he forced himself to focus on Blaise. He inhaled sharply as he felt Zabini’s hands trailing down his stomach, sweeping past his navel, and reaching lower…
Their Arithmancy class was in a cold, stone room occupied by rows of cramped desks. He took his usual seat next to Daphne, who was flipping through her textbook.
Draco was annoyed to find that yet again Potter ignored his jab. He was still staring at his wand as though willing it to light up.
“I see.” He gave a long sigh and said, “Well, I thought I might find you out here. It seems you’re always wandering the grounds. Is that how you used to spend your time before? In previous years?”
“I know.” Draco meant to apologize again, but he caught sight of Flitwick coming towards them. He picked up his wand and tapped it against the sheet of parchment in front of him. “
Potter ignored him and went on, “Why don’t we make a list of what we think is most important, and then we’ll compare?”
“You’re not going to believe me,” Draco warned her. “Or, if you do, you’re going to be angry with me.”
But that was all hormones. He was sure of it. He frequently noticed the same kinds of things about plenty of other blokes, and he had slept with more than half of them. In fact, he had been with wizards
They left Honeydukes as a group, happily comparing their purchases—Millicent, it seemed, had bought the store’s entire stock of Every Flavoured Beans. She dared Nott to try a terrible-looking yellow one, and they laughed as he spluttered and retched: vomit flavoured. Walking next to Draco, Daphne pried open her single Chocolate Frog. As she nibbled on it, she turned the card in her hand, and then offered it to Draco.
“I don’t know!” He couldn’t understand why Blaise was interrogating him. Not even Pansy had been this difficult. “Just…different things. I can’t remember, obviously. But Harry’s told me some of them.” Uncomfortable, he looked away. “Watching someone die. Fixing the cabinet. That sort of thing.”
“He’s still on that?” she sneered. “God, I would have thought it completely beneath him to ask any of us for help. You know he thinks he’s a better wizard than anyone at this school—including the teachers.”
Emboldened by Harry’s support, Pansy slapped her hand down onto the table. Their bottles shook ominously. “Exactly! What does it matter? You have to finish your N.E.W.T.s, Draco.”
“Why are you lying to me?” she demanded. Their eyes briefly met—she was glowering at him, mouth twisted in fury.
They left the pub in various states of intoxication. To Draco’s horror, Finnigan and Thomas started up a rousing chorus of the Gryffindor version of “Weasley is Our King” as they stumbled down the lane. Several others joined in, even as they were shushed angrily from an open window. Draco was happy to take up the rear, walking along at a bit of a distance from the crowd. It had been hot inside the Three Broomsticks, and he reveled in the cold night air. He cast a soft Warming Charm and then tucked his wand into his cloak, next to the velvet pouch. He shoved his hands into his pockets and took a deep inhale when all at once someone grabbed him from behind. He was so startled that he couldn’t yell—he froze, mind blank, as his assailant dragged him off into a dark alleyway.
“Now see here, everyone,” Sprout said. She was wrapped in an enormous, woolly coat; it was not unlike something Hagrid might have worn. “Look at Ms. Granger’s work. See how she’s labeled everything?
“I want you to listen to me.” Harry’s voice was hardly more than a whisper. “I am going to wipe away every last mark of him on you. Do you understand me?” Rendered mute, Draco could only nod. “And then you are going to forget about him. About how he touched you. We are both going to forget. And you are going to be mine.”
“Dobby?” Draco frowned. “He was my parents’ elf. He rescued you, at the Manor. Does he not work here anymore?”
As casually as he could, Draco strolled back over to Theo. “So, er. Did you have any other ideas? For Lavender?”
Harry made a broken, gasping sound at that. He was beautiful as he pressed his forehead against Draco’s, eyes closed, face flushed. Everything came up in Draco at once—every little time Harry had asked before touching him, every moment he had smiled at him, comforted him, every second they had spent together in their spot. The vulnerability of having Harry inside of him would have been terrifying, but it wasn’t. He savored it, awed at the fact that it was Harry filling him, Harry caressing him, Harry making him feel so good.
Finally, as the heaving subsided, Draco sat back. Potter cleaned the grass with a sharp flick of his wand. His hand was still on Draco’s shoulder. Feeling foolish, Draco rubbed angrily at the tears in his eyes. His mouth was dry, but he didn’t trust himself to conjure anything.
Draco meant to watch the match, but his eyes were on Harry. He would be lying if he said he didn’t look nice in his crimson Quidditch robes. It was becoming increasingly clear that Draco hadn’t been mistaken—Harry
“Yeah. I’m pretty sure.” He gave Draco a lopsided grin. “It’s hard to forget where you nearly died, I guess.”
“I’m fine,” Draco said. He reached down and took Harry’s hand in his as they continued on to the lake.
“Nothing,” he said defensively. “Potter just thought I was too sharp with her. You know how he gets: he coddles all of them.”
Draco froze. Memories rose, unbidden, to the surface; he tried to stop them, but they pushed past his pleas, causing his heart to freeze. “What happened?”
“Please,” he said, giving in to Potter, his hands, his voice, his eyes. “Please, Potter. Make me come. I want to, need to.”
, boy! I understand you’ve grown up the son of Lucius Malfoy, and with that have come certain expectations—”
“Are you going to the party tonight?” Potter was staring at him with those bright green eyes, hands in his jean pockets.
He jumped when he realized that Harry was speaking to him. Embarrassed, he grimaced. “Sorry. What were you saying?”
“It’s…it’s the flying,” Draco said. His voice was hoarse. “Ever since what happened in the Room, I haven’t been able to fly.”
for the Ministry. All these passports have to be issued before they can leave…and sending an Auror into another country on Ministry business isn’t as simple as just giving them a passport, let me tell you…”
Harry pulled out the Marauder’s Map. After scanning it for a second, he said, “Fifth floor. Come on.”
"Thought you’d pissed me off with that little show?” Draco spat. “What, you think that’s how I spend my time, Potter? Mooning after you and crying to myself whenever I see you fucking around with your stupid friends?” Never mind that it was true.
Harry hummed thoughtfully. “I guess so. A bit, anyway. I was there a lot over the summer. It’s been really difficult since Fred…”
Draco was torn. He wanted to tell his friends why his Mark hurt, but he couldn’t bear their questions. If he told them he was trying to get rid of the Mark, he would have to explain that he was meeting Potter every night to do so. And for some strange reason, that didn’t sit well with him.
“Anthony.” Harry straightened up and took hold of Goldstein’s arm. “This is really, really important. Please. Something awful is about to happen and we need to try to stop it.”
“Draco. Let’s go for a nice walk.” Before he could protest, Pansy took his arm and steered him out of the entrance hall. They had only just finished dinner; Draco thought remorsefully of his warm bed down in the dungeons, calling out to him. His evening plans had consisted of hiding under his blankets and hopefully sorting his Defence homework, but he wisely decided against arguing as Pansy dragged him along.
Potter ignored him. “I haven’t been able to sleep in months. I keep dreaming of burying Dobby. Of going down to see Voldemort, thinking I was going to die. Of everyone who did die, lined up in the Great Hall.”
“Of course.” Pansy squeezed his hand, and then said, “So, what about you, then? You still haven’t told me where you go every night.”
He never had much to say during Transfiguration. Pansy and Blaise kept up a constant stream of conversation, nattering on about their relatives in far-flung places. For his part, Draco listened absently, watching as the mouse he had transfigured from a toad sat atop his textbook and groomed itself. He leaned forward, resting his chin on his crossed arms, as the little gray mouse wiped its face. Carefully, Draco held out his hand; despite himself, he felt the corner of his mouth twitch as the mouse sniffed along his palm.
“Awful,” Draco admitted. He couldn’t say why, but he felt as though he was going to cry. His eyes stung as he squeezed them tightly shut. “What was it about?”
“My mother…that’s more complicated,” said Draco. “She tried to save me, I guess. She didn’t want me taking the Mark. And then she asked Severus to make an Unbreakable Vow. But my father, he…” Draco didn’t know what to say. He didn’t think himself capable of putting into words how vehemently he detested his father.
And Harry seemed to be of a similar mind, his eyes clouded with lust as he lowered Draco onto his back. Draco felt an exhilarating frisson leap through his body as Harry reached down and slipped his hand along his arse. His touch was unbelievably intimate.
“Of course we will,” Harry reassured him. “We’ll meet tomorrow night. And the night after that. For as long as you want.”
As Draco tread down the stairs to the common room, he told himself that this would be the last time. No more secret Floo meetings in the middle of the night. No more surreptitious notes to his father, trying to relay hints as inconspicuously as possible. No more long days spent agonizing over whether the common room would be empty and, if not, how he could clear it as quickly as possible. He would speak to his father through Floo one last time—for his mother, for Harry—and then he would be done with it. Easing into his usual armchair by the grate, Draco took a deep, steadying breath and reminded himself that this was the end. One way or another, this was the end.
It was only then that it occurred to him. “It doesn’t hurt anymore,” Draco said. He hardly dared believe it.
“Relax…relax, there you go…” Potter already knew, of course, but he repeated the platitudes anyway as he slowly eased two fingers in. He had learned early on
Daphne looked up at Harry. Grinning ruefully, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a worn piece of parchment. “The Marauder’s Map,” he told Draco before handing it to him.
“I wish you’d accepted,” Harry said, cutting him off. He had a pained look on his face. “When Dumbledore offered to help you. I wish you’d accepted.”
“So you don’t even interpret what the cards say? You just take the descriptions from the book? How is that supposed to tell me anything about my future?”
The following evening, Proudfoot came to watch how their study group got on. They were still working on Transfiguration. Draco was pleased enough with the O.W.L.-level students’ progress: most of them were able to turn a Holland Lops into a hare and then back again. The N.E.W.T.-level students were more of a mixed bag. There were some who still struggled with transfiguring their hair colour, while others, like Granger, had moved on to altering their facial features and could even achieve it nonverbally. Draco spent much of the lesson helping a group of Ravenclaw sixth years, ignoring Proudfoot and Harry as they loudly discussed the group’s progress. By the end of the hour, Draco was tense and irritable.
Ron chuckled, giving her a lopsided smile. Hermione reached out and held his hand, running her thumb across his fingers.
“That’s a good idea,” Harry said, saving him from having to respond. “I think all of the eighth years have just about mastered Shield Charms, haven’t they?”
“And no one better than our Hermione to do it,” Harry said fondly. Granger blushed and took a sip of her drink.
“Slughorn,” he mouthed at her. Satisfied, she looked back up at Sprout, and Draco slipped out into the cool afternoon air. Instantly he felt better. He hoisted his satchel higher onto his shoulder, stuck his hands into his pockets to protect them from the cold, and set off towards the castle. His head was bent against the wind, which had picked up since that morning. He was plagued by a question that had been nagging at him all day—what would he say when Slughorn asked him about his career plans? In truth, he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do after Hogwarts. The trouble wasn’t only that his family’s ruined reputation had cut his options short. There was also the matter of his own interests, which he seemed incapable of sorting out. For a while now, he had considered working for the Department of Magical Cooperation. Such a position would have allowed him to cultivate relationships with high-ranking wizards and witches around the world, and, while Greg and Vincent had been utterly perplexed by his interest in what they described as “bloody boring” work, Draco had always had a knack for bartering and negotiating. It was a skill he had learned from his father. But now he doubted very much that the British Ministry would send a former Death Eater as their delegate. Snorting at the thought, he pushed through the entrance doors and made for the dungeons when he heard someone call out, “Malfoy.”
“I didn’t really have another option,” he said, still wondering what the point of this was. “As everyone loves to remind me, my family name means nothing anymore. Worse than nothing.”
“So why did you come, then?” Potter was searching his face, and in the small room, he had nowhere to hide. This had been a horrible mistake.
“Yeah. Listen, Blaise.” As Pansy turned to talk to the seventh year next to her, Draco lowered his voice. “I know about Kevin Whitby.”
Shaken, Draco ignored Daphne’s sympathetic face and pretended to focus on his parchment. As his vision swam, he gripped his hands tightly together underneath the table. He couldn’t have an episode. Not here. But the bile was rising up so quickly in his throat that he thought he would be sick. Palms clammy, he rubbed them together, urging himself to focus on anything other than his absolute panic in the face of his friends’ anger. He thought of the look on Harry’s face when they kissed; he recalled the moment when Harry had pressed his lips to his Dark Mark. Taking a deep breath, Draco returned to his work.
“What is it?” Blaise demanded from behind him. “Has someone died? Your mother never writes on Saturdays."
. And he couldn’t help it if there weren’t exactly that many good-looking blokes in their year, and if Harry just so happened to have the brightest green eyes he had ever seen. And he couldn’t help it, either, if Harry looked fantastic on his broomstick, all wiry strength and tanned skin and arrogant smile that Draco both did and did not loathe. And what was he supposed to do when Harry was so innately tactile, so physical, when he laughed so easily with his friends and wore his stupid navy jumper that looked so soft and so cozy? Even Blaise had admitted once, after several firewhiskies, that Harry wasn’t bad-looking. And for Blaise, that was very high praise indeed.
The silence stretched between them. Draco did his best to slow his breathing while Potter sat next to him, staring at the ground. It should have been awkward, but Draco was too unsettled to care. As Macnair’s face floated before him, he groaned, squeezing his fists. “Don’t want to puke again.”
The day dragged on. Potter was quiet during lunch. It might have been because of his tomato plant, but Draco didn’t have time to ask. He bent over his paper, noticing only now that he had completely forgotten to answer the third question Sprout had set them. He was usually never this unorganized. Exasperated with himself, he realized that he would have to rewrite the entire foot of parchment—there was no way he could cram his answer into the short space between questions two and four. He noted, with a heavy sense of irony, that after lecturing Potter for weeks about doing his homework at the table, he was now doing just that.
Draco smirked. A little voice in the back of his mind reminded him that Harry was holding his hand, stroking it, and that Granger was
“Professor Sprout isn’t so bad,” Daphne encouraged her. She then winced as she added, “I’m with Professor Vector…working with her on numbers charts…”
“This is so nice!” Lavender was saying. “We should’ve asked you to come! This was all sort of last-minute—Pansy only wrote Theo this morning, so I guess it slipped our minds…”
Draco didn’t know how to answer. In truth, he was grateful that Pansy and Blaise had decided to overlook his last outburst, and so he shoved down his irritation and shrugged.
he was afraid of. He just knew that at any moment something awful was going to happen, though he couldn’t say what.
“Hi,” Potter said as he approached Draco. Looking back over his shoulder at Pansy’s retreating figure, he asked, “Is she okay?”
Draco studied the cards. They were indeed very old—several of them were worn at the corners, and one in particular looked as though it had been folded several times. “Which do I pick?”
“Alright.” It wouldn’t be the worst thing, he thought, slipping into that limbo between consciousness and unconsciousness again. It might be nice. There had been something soothing about giving in to the potion’s soporific effect, listening to Harry as he talked about his Quidditch team. And if it meant he wouldn’t have to relive these memories, all the better.
Harry held Draco’s chin and turned his face up so that their eyes met. “Hey,” he said quietly. “You don’t need to feel bad. We’ll work on it.”
“Mmm.” Draco picked up a slice of toast with much less enthusiasm; he had suddenly lost his appetite.
“Absolutely not,” Draco said. When Harry frowned at him, he doubled down. “No. I won’t.” It was difficult enough to go through his memories with the promise that they would be promptly erased; to have to
“Because I haven’t written her back in months,” he said. “Because I won’t go to Azkaban with her. Because I refuse to stay at the Manor for Christmas. There are other reasons, I’m sure.”
“Of course I remember,” his father said. “But that doesn’t change…it doesn’t mean…” His face fell oddly flat. “So you believe him, then? You think he’s telling the truth?”
Everywhere Zabini had touched him, Harry kissed. Draco's skin burned. Never before had he been so aware of his own body. It felt as though he was being purged--as though every last grain of guilt and shame was being wiped away and instead replaced with nothing but Harry, Harry, Harry. Overwhelmed as he was, Draco urged himself to commit every last detail to memory--Harry's blue jumper, his brilliant green eyes, his flushed face and his swollen lips.
“Now, here’s what I propose.” Slughorn leaned forward and clasped his hands on top of his desk. He had very much the air of someone who was about to give him a special treat. “You don’t need to be back at Hogwarts, Draco. As you’ve seen, many students have chosen to—”
Potter reached out and forced Draco to turn his head towards him. “You don’t like it, do you?” When Draco stayed quiet, he went on, “You don’t like it when we have people here.”
“Oh, that will be very nice for your mother, won’t it?” Pansy said waspishly. “The first big dinner since—since the Battle, since the end of things—and she has to go alone.”
“Yeah. At the start of the year, I was really…really drawn to you.” Harry, who was rarely ever shy in front of him, blushed and looked away; Draco found it unbearably compelling. “Because you looked…you looked the way I felt.”
“I need to stop in at Flourish and Blotts,” Blaise said. “There’s a new book on herbs and spices my mother wants.” With a deep sigh, he added, “I suppose I’ll have to find something for Pansy, as well.”
“That, I cannot tell you,” he said. “I’m sorry. We’ve decided Hogwarts is just too risky. But don’t worry, it’s all been arranged. You’ll be staying with the Order. Helping us.”
As his senses came back to him, he started to notice how hard Potter was through his jeans. His sleepiness gave way to the need to touch him. He started to pull down his jeans, but Potter pushed his hands away.
She bickered with him all the way back to the castle, and Draco quickly regretted telling her about his deal with Potter. She offered to give him twice what Potter was paying—though privately, Draco doubted very much that she had access to those kinds of funds—and, as they pushed through the double doors, she threatened to write to his parents.
, he sat cross-legged, set the inkpot to rest precariously on the window ledge, and spread out the parchment on his knee. The blank page was daunting. Damn it, he was writing to his mother. It should be easy. There had been a time when they were best friends. Sitting back, watching as Callidus groomed himself, he clearly recalled the summer when he had turned eleven, right before he left for Hogwarts. There had been a huge row between his parents—his father had been insisting for years that he go to Durmstrang, but his mother absolutely refused to send him so far away. Looking back, Draco wondered whether she had also resisted on the grounds that Durmstrang took a much different approach to the Dark Arts than did Hogwarts. And so his parents had fought for most of the year leading up to his enrollment, and eventually, his mother had prevailed. Despite his parents' bickering, that summer had been a wonderful one. His father had mostly been away on business—to Peru or Chile, he couldn’t remember anymore—and so it had only been the two of them. He dipped his quill into the inkpot, and wrote:
Draco sat back and began to button up his shirt. The fire was crackling away merrily, Harry’s hand was resting on his back, and it was so
“Draco.” She hesitated, and then continued, “Blaise and Theo, they were saying you had detention with Proudfoot the other day. But…he was with McGonagall and Flitwick. I saw them. They were headed down to the pitch to inspect it before the first match.”
Harry gave an exasperated sigh and flopped onto his back. “I killed Voldemort, didn’t I? I did what everyone asked of me. Why can’t they leave me alone?”
“He did that a lot. I must have dozens of memories.” Draco swallowed thickly. “You think we’ll have to go through all of them?”
“What?” There was a deafening silence as Harry stopped ripping the grass from the earth. Draco didn’t dare look up at him. “You think…you think…I didn’t mean it like that. Draco. Look at me. Hey.” He felt Harry’s hand on his arm. “Look at me.” Draco shook his head, refusing. “I don’t think
And then Draco was back in Defence, his heart racing so fast he thought it might explode. He had fallen against a desk and was nearly on the floor. As the ringing in his ears subsided, he heard Blaise snap, “It wasn’t me!”
Either she hadn’t noticed his irritation, or she didn’t care. Beaming, Pansy returned to her magazine, kicking his foot under the table when he craned his neck to look at Harry again.
By the time they left Hogsmeade, Draco was perfectly capable of managing on his own, but Harry insisted on helping him along. If any of the others found it odd, they said nothing. Instead, Pansy and Granger resumed their discussion of places to visit in France; Pansy roped Blaise into recounting the time they had gotten lost in the streets of Paris and he had cried.
“Yes,” Pansy said breathlessly. “Yes, what a good idea. You don’t mind, do you, Theo? We won’t be long.”
listen to my thoughts on the matter…but anyway…” He trailed off, finished sorting his papers, and then sat back. There was an awkward silence, as though neither of them knew where to start.
“That’s because he hasn’t forgotten,” Lovegood said. “His mind hasn’t, and neither has his body…And it’s all the same, isn’t it? I don’t think you can separate one from the other…”
Another wizard stood up. Draco recognized the sallow-faced man at once: Richard Cresswell, one of Dirk Cresswell’s many cousins. “Mr. Potter, I’m sure you'll want to get back to enjoying your Christmas Eve. This is nothing to bother yourself with.”
“I’ve got something for you to deliver.” As Draco tied the parchment to Callidus’ outstretched leg, he looked down at the courtyard below them. It was eerily quiet. He wasn’t used to seeing the castle so empty. In previous years, he would spend his Sunday mornings lounging in the common room with his friends, only heading up for breakfast when the sun was fully out. During nice weather, they would head to the lake to skip rocks, taunt the Giant Squid, and nap in the sunshine. Once it started to snow, they mostly restricted themselves to the common room, playing chess or listening to the wireless together. He wondered how many of the eighth-year Slytherins would still gather in the common room on Sundays, if any.
“I’m not siding with anyone. I just want this stupidity to stop. Get back to work, and this time, aim straight.”
Draco hummed, pulling the magazine closer. The satin robes hugged the model’s curves; she smiled at them coyly. “No. You wore emerald last year.” At that, the model’s face fell into a pout.
Slowly, Harry shifted towards him. “I know. I’m sorry.” A pause, and then, “I’m going to hug you. Alright?”
Draco didn’t recognize the woman who was yelling at them, but Harry must have, because he said coldly, "Madam Webb.”
He suddenly realized that Potter was working through the remaining buttons on his shirt. He froze as Potter popped open the last button and, finally, smoothed his hands over Draco’s skin. At the feel of Potter’s callused hands, he shivered. As Potter pulled off his shirt, he suddenly remembered the Dark Mark—he gripped his arm, panicked, but Potter shook his head silently and pulled Draco’s hand away. He stared down at the Mark, his expression neutral, and then he drew Draco closer. Again, Draco was startled at just how gentle he was. He was used to the Potter who pushed his friends in jest in the corridors, who was so rough with his ingredients in Potions that he often had to redo everything. But here, it was as though Potter’s every move was deliberate.
“Ah…right.” She had already hidden the magazine beneath her textbook. She touched the tip of her wand to the parchment and said, “
"I imagine it must be difficult, seeing everyone else pair off when nobody will even look your way," Draco snapped.
But Draco could hardly hear him. There was an awful roaring sound in his ears as the scene flashed before him—Granger screeching as his aunt ripped back her hair…Potter blinking up at him, face swollen and almost unrecognizable…his parents’ wild eyes, urging him to do the right thing, incapable of telling him what the right thing
“Then leave them alone,” Harry argued; Draco could feel him smiling against his neck. “How else are people supposed to know you’re mine?”
“Maybe.” He tried to smile at Harry, to reassure him that everything was fine, but it was difficult when the sharp tide of anxiety rose up in him so abruptly. Looking to change topics, Draco asked, “And what about you? Anything from the Wasps?”
“Wait, actually,” Potter said, jumping up, “I’ve left something upstairs.” When Draco stared him at, saying nothing, Potter added, “Malfoy, you should check your room, too. In case you’ve…forgotten anything. Come on."
Harry smirked, no doubt seeing through his ruse, but he didn’t press. Instead, he sat across from Draco. Over at the Hufflepuff table, a group of students had turned to gawk at them. Harry shifted slightly, blocking them from Draco’s view. “Ignore them,” he said.
“You…” He didn’t quite know how to put this. “You can’t just keep the Dark Lord out by throwing embarrassing memories at him. I know that’s how you shut me down…but it’s not going to work with him.”
As he watched the green light from the window cast patterns on the ceiling, Draco allowed himself to wonder whether the Two of Cups had been referring to Harry. It seemed almost too good to be true—a new relationship built on friendship. But they
“Eventually, yes. But for now...the Wizengamot has the final say, and they are supposed to be at arm’s length from the Minister in this respect. It’s been very difficult for them to gather enough evidence on most of the others...the ones still alive, anyway. So it seems that they’re using me as a scapegoat.”
Reassured that Pansy had decided to be reasonable, Draco sunk deeper into his chair, nursing his bottle of firewhisky. The others discussed the upcoming Quidditch season—Lavender, apparently, supported the Wigtown Wanderers, a source of great ire for Theo, a lifelong Puddlemere fan. Although he tried to follow their discussion, Draco found himself overwhelmed by the heat and the loud noise in the pub. He couldn’t help but be relieved when they finally decided to call it a night.
“Right.” Potter was at his side at once, Vanishing the blanket. “Go get some sleep. I’m free this time next week.”
“I still think it’s unfair that you can’t play,” said Pansy. “If you were the Seeker this year, I think Slytherin would have a real chance. And I’d love to see us win before we leave.”
There was much fanfare as everyone bid them goodbye. Privately, Draco thought it was a bit ridiculous: they were meeting for drinks again in two days. But he allowed himself to be hugged and squeezed, finally disentangling himself from Pansy long enough to pull on his cloak. Draco knew Ron was making a face when he leaned in to kiss Harry; amused, he lingered longer than he normally would have.
"We talked about that,” Daphne said at once. “About how you saved Harry. And I told him, you know…that you're my friend.”
Potter sat back up, laughing. “Yeah? You definitely don’t want to know what I’ve been thinking about, then.”
They were alone. Once again, the clearing was theirs. Even though it was dark, and even though it was cold, it was theirs. And somehow, it was peaceful, as though the grass and the ground bore their imprint from all the nights they had met there. As he settled onto the blanket, Draco realized that he felt safer in the forest than nearly anywhere else. And that was very odd, because the Forbidden Forest was full of frightening, dangerous things. But he wasn’t afraid. Not with Harry there, sitting cross-legged next to him, looking warm and inviting in his well-worn jumper.
"I’m a bit young to teach at Hogwarts, aren’t I?” he said. “And I doubt any parent would be keen on having their child taught by a former Death Eater.”
“I've gotten you all riled up, I see,” Draco taunted him, shifting to sit in Harry’s lap. Instantly, Harry sat up, pulling him into a kiss. Draco could nearly weep for need. While he had anticipated this moment, he hadn’t expected the thrill that passed over him whenever Harry moaned into his mouth, or the gymnastics his stomach executed when their eyes met. His head was full of nothing but
Draco looked up in surprise; if he hadn’t known better, he would have sworn Potter sounded scared. In the dark, his face was pale, his eyes wide.
"That’s a bit harsh, isn’t it?” said Millicent. “Vincent was his friend…they were close, ever since first year. So maybe he wanted to come back to where they spent all their time together. Maybe he’s processing everything right now.”
Draco picked up one of Harry’s gloves and fiddled with it. The worn leather reminded him sharply of his own days as a Seeker. “I don’t know what I think.”
His stomach tightened strangely as he saw Potter striding towards them. His arms were crossed, his brow furrowed. There was an awkward silence as they regarded one another. Finally, Potter said, “I need to talk to you.”
Draco was staring down at the knife in his hand, considering the blade’s steel, when he suddenly flashed back to the Manor, to that horrific moment when his aunt had used her knife to carve deep into Granger’s flesh—he had wanted desperately to look away, and yet hadn’t dared, and so had he stared, transfixed, as Granger writhed. The blade had pierced through her skin so easily, slicing through it like butter, until it was obscured entirely by Granger’s blood, weeping out of her wounds. Draco had seen the other Death Eaters torture people before, but it had always been with magic. It was still gruesome, and he still wept at night, but rarely had he seen marks on flesh. There had been something savage about the way his aunt had maimed Granger.
“I can’t stand all this rubbish,” she said, adding hastily, “No offense. But I’ve always wanted to do something with music. I’ve been playing piano since I was three.”
For a tense moment, Proudfoot said nothing. Finally, he lowered his wand. “I know what you think of your father, Draco.” He bristled at the sound of his first name. “But you’re condemning him to a fate worst than death. You’re better than this. Think of your mother—she doesn’t want this on your conscience.”
he is, Father. Potter’s garbage at Occlumency. He can’t hide anything. And I could tell he was being honest.”
“Ah, right.” Harry reached forward and took his hand. “I don’t care, you know. I don’t care at all. I’d have you right here on the table if you’d let me.”
“Yeah.” As he busied himself with putting away his things, he thought that he would never be able to conjure a Patronus again. Every last happy memory he had was ruined. “If you don’t mind, I’m really tired. I think I’m going to…I’ll just…”
Blaise’s words cut so deeply that he forgot to breathe. The ache in his chest was reminiscent of the curse Harry had butchered him with in their sixth year. “I…I hate the Mark. I don’t want it on me. I can’t stand to look at it.”
“Of course we wouldn’t,” Pansy said. “Look at us, championing inter-house unity. I won’t be kissing any Gryffindors, though,” she warned.
Draco laughed. “That was the least of my concerns. And I don’t really think I’m Nott’s type, so you have nothing to worry about there.”
“Well, I don’t want to repeat myself, so I’ll refrain from reminding you of how important it is to come up with a plan. And what if your father is sent to Azkaban, then? Will you stay in Britain, for your mother?”
“There’s always Longbottom,” she teased. Draco rolled his eyes at her. “Or perhaps Weasley is more your type?”
“I said I’m fine,” Draco snapped, hating himself for it. He had the self-control of a child these days. “Tuesday. Alright?”
“So I went to your dorm—I know I shouldn’t, but anyway, everyone was asleep. And you weren’t there! So I ran to the Gryffindor Tower, and I woke up Harry, and then he used that, that map…”
“To help you move on,” Harry said. “If you don’t have the Mark, you won’t be reminded of him all the time…isn’t that what you said? It’ll be easier for you…”
Before he could respond, someone had grabbed him roughly by the arm, pushing between himself and Zabini. Furious, Draco reached for his wand and was about to fling a particularly vicious hex when he saw who it was.
“I know that,” he snapped. Remembering himself, he said softly, “I know. But anywhere has to be better than here. I had always thought I would do post-graduate studies. Rent a flat somewhere. My parents and I used to travel during the summer…we were invited to so many places, I’ve been just about…well, it doesn’t matter anymore. But my plan had always been to travel some more, once I left Hogwarts.”
Lips pursed, Pansy became very absorbed in slicing the last few bits of cabbage. Finally, she said, “You remember I told you about St. Mungo’s? And how you can get a job brewing remedies for the patients there?”
Pansy huddled close to Draco as she sipped her cup of tea. They sat together on a stone bench by Greenhouse One, watching as a group of Gryffindors trickled by. Draco was supposed to be reading through the third chapter of
They worked in silence for a while, Draco trying to suppress his yawns as he crushed the beetles with a pestle. His thoughts drifted to Harry, who surely must still be asleep in his bed…his bed, where he had kissed Draco senseless. Mortified, Draco realized that he was getting hard. Clearing his throat, he shifted in his seat and said conversationally, “I don’t know why you’re so upset. Slughorn’s not that bad.”
“Potter!” He gaped, scandalized. A few people looked over. Lowering his voice, he said through gritted teeth, “Your friends are
Draco traced each letter of Severus’ name. “I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you.”
“The memory, it wasn’t…” Harry let out a sharp exhale. “It wasn’t…that. Not exactly. You were in your bedroom, at the Manor…it must have just happened…”
The smile dropped from Harry’s face. Draco’s heart sunk as Harry looked away, gazing over at Winky and Kreacher as they bustled about. In an odd, flat voice, he said, “Dobby died.”
As his father’s head popped into the flames promptly at two o’clock, Draco felt a strange mixture of relief and dread. He had spent a long, miserable evening praying that everyone would vacate the common room. The eighth-year Slytherins had been almost impossible, lounging on the sofas and playing endless games of chess. Finally, Draco had taken inspiration from his letter and suggested they all head to Hogsmeade. By some miracle, they listened, leaving him to enjoy the silence of the common room as the younger students slowly headed off to bed.
you, don’t you see?” Pansy was staring at him as though she had never seen anyone so dim. “Trying to gauge how you would react.”
“Fuck,” Harry breathed into his skin. He sounded as awed as Draco felt. “Fuck, I can’t get enough of you.”
Acutely aware that they were out in the open, where anyone could see them, Draco tensed. Then, mustering up whatever courage he had, telling himself that he had just taken on a dementor, he leaned forward and kissed Harry. It was only a brief, chaste kiss, but Harry’s face lit up as he pulled away.
He reached up to catch the scroll as it dropped from overhead. As Draco worked to unfurl it, Harry pulled him closer. They huddled against the wind, reading Daphne’s letter together.
“Slughorn,” Lavender suggested. “He’s still your Head of House, isn’t he? He’s got all kinds of connections at the Ministry.”
“Owl him and let him know we’re coming,” Harry said. “We’ll Floo in from the Hog’s Head. Tell him to make sure the network’s open.”
“Done, I’m done,” Harry said. The moment he took his hand away, Draco cradled his arm against his chest. Little flashes of the memory they had just witnessed leapt before him: Severus’ stern face, his glittering eyes, and the most horrible sense of dread—something terrible had happened.
Harry gave Draco a soft smile, squeezing his wrist before he pulled away. “Tonight, then. See you later.”
“Well, your practice paid off.” Proudfoot smiled at him. “I think you could be quite the formidable wizard, Mr. Malfoy. Surely, your fellow students could learn from you.”
think this is your assignment, then?” Proudfoot asked him. When Draco said nothing, he turned to Potter, who said uncertainly, “Because we didn’t have any other ideas?”
“Never mind that. You had your reasons.” Studying Harry’s face, Draco asked, “And what about you? Are you alright?”
“But what if it does? What if the Mark comes back, and then all the progress I’ve made—with you, with my parents, with my marks—it all just goes away?”
Draco blanched. He felt exposed as he realized that Potter had been watching him sleep. Of course, he hadn’t been sleeping, not really, but he had been in a position so vulnerable that he momentarily scolded himself for being so careless. Potter could have left him in the forest, or taken his wand, or hexed him, or any number of things. These were all of the worst-case scenarios he had learned to run through in his attempt to survive the war. A part of him knew, though, that Potter wouldn’t actually hurt him. That certainty rested deep within him, a hard kernel of truth that he couldn’t quite explain.
“And what was your detention, Draco?” asked Blaise. His tone was casual enough, but Draco saw his eyes following him skeptically.
Draco shrugged. “It’s still a good book.” When Harry shoved him playfully, he smirked. “You’ll make the team, you git. You know you will. So you’d better brush up on your history.”
Harry blinked at him. He seemed to come back to consciousness, as if drifting out of a dream. “Not…” He shook his head. “Not here.”
He briefly considered skipping his classes on Wednesday but thought better of it; he could use the distraction. And anyway, he had double Potions with Gryffindor, and that meant seeing Harry. Although they had barely seen each other since Saturday, Draco spent every night laying in bed, repeating that name to himself over and over—Harry, Harry, Harry. He tried to get used to the sound on his tongue. It wasn’t unpleasant. When he did manage to drift off for a few hours, he fell asleep with that name floating through his consciousness. Of course, his thoughts of Harry mingled with his fears for his father, and so most mornings he woke up miserable and exhausted.
Harry looked as though he wanted to say something, but his response was cut short as Draco suddenly slid his cock into his mouth. He took him as deeply as he could, preening at the sound of Harry’s breathless moans. He sucked him at a leisurely pace, holding the base of his cock with one hand. As Harry started to thrust into his mouth, he pulled away, grinning cruelly. Running his fist loosely up Harry’s cock, he lapped at the tip, pleased as Harry leaked onto his fingers. Draco felt as though he would come undone from that sight alone; Harry, for his part, was mumbling his name as his hands twisted through the sheets.
“They can’t think that poorly of you if they have you teaching other students,” she pointed out. “That’s quite a responsibility, isn’t it? What will you be teaching?”
“Yeah.” It burned as Harry went deeper, but he adjusted himself on the sheets, taking a deep breath. Harry slipped out, almost withdrawing entirely, and then pushed back in again, and it was smoother this time. The ache gave away to a sense of fullness that Draco tried to breathe around. A few more strokes, and it was better, now: the pain edged into pleasure.
“And there goes the Snitch…well, they did their best,” Lovegood said. “And now, let’s see…oh, there’s the Quaffle, Natalie McDonald has it…or no, that’s Demelza. They both have brown hair. It would be so much easier if they chose players who didn’t look alike, wouldn’t it?”
“Only you’ve been very quiet this evening.” When he refused to answer, Proudfoot addressed Harry. “Has something happened between the two of you? Professor McGonagall and I were just saying that it’s good to see you putting aside your differences. But now it seems…something is wrong.”
Harry and Lovegood were already in the clearing when Draco arrived. Harry smiled, almost apologetically, as Lovegood turned around to greet him. She was dressed in perhaps the strangest winter cloak Draco had ever seen—in the dark of the forest, it looked black, but little planets and figures of the solar system glided around the sleeves and the skirt. That alone caused Draco to stop short.
Draco blanched. Pulling himself together, he said roughly: “Right. Go on, then, ease up a bit. You’re all stiff in your shoulders.”
Draco felt trapped—was he supposed to apologize? Defend himself? All at once he felt furious with Daphne, with all of them, for putting him in this position. He drained his bottle, slammed it down on the table, and stormed out of the room. He thought he heard Daphne calling him, but he ignored her. He needed to get back to his dorm and away from these people, from their reproachful eyes, from their whispers. He made it halfway down the corridor when he felt someone tugging his arm. He didn’t even need to look back to know that it was Potter.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged, a nervous smile on his face. “He knows Viktor Krum, and Krum mentioned that he’s seen me fly—at the Tournament, you know—so Mr. Dawson wrote me over the summer. Their Seeker is retiring.”
Harry dismissed his concerns with a wave of his hand. “It’s fine, don’t worry. It was very educational.”
“Am not!” Daphne protested in mock fury. “And there was this one time when we were out late—Slytherin had Quidditch practice, and there were a bunch of us there watching—and I swear we heard a dragon. Don’t you remember, Draco?”
“A Mind Healer,” Lovegood said. “He came home once he was better. He still sees her sometimes, though.”
“Proudfoot said my father contacted him this morning. But why? Why is it such a big panic, all of a sudden? His next hearing isn’t until January. But Proudfoot seemed worried.”
Weasley blinked at him and then turned back to Draco. His face hardened, and Draco had no time to react as he pulled out his wand.
“I wanted to ask…” Potter paused, as though bracing himself, and then said, “Have you had any other…flashbacks? Like you did in Defence?”
“I knew you’d react like this,” Draco said angrily as they swept down the stairs to the dungeons. “This is why I didn’t want to tell you.”
“It’s…” Harry sat down and ran his fingers through his messy hair. Up close like this, he looked as though he hadn’t slept in days. “I’m going to tell you something. But you can’t panic. I need you to stay calm.”
“Hogsmeade,” she said. She was rewriting her Charms notes; Nott had knocked over a flagon of pumpkin juice onto them at dinner.
The Mark ached so tenderly that every time his arm bumped against Potter’s side, a fresh wave of pain coursed through him. Fighting off the urge to groan, to grip his arm, Draco said, “I’d rather be dead than have this thing.”
“I don’t know. It’s strange.” Draco pictured his mother’s impassive face. “I thought she’d be angry. I thought she’d at least ask. But she doesn’t really seem to care. Maybe she’s just glad that I’m here, and she figures it’s thanks to you.”
“He didn’t do anything.” Harry sat back, considering him. Finally, he said, “He wanted to do…he wanted to do something terrible to you, didn’t he? Something…something really bad…”
“YOU!” Pansy suddenly yelled, pointing an accusatory finger at Harry. He blinked at her, wide-eyed. “Y-You keep Draco safe, you hear me?”
“I’m sure.” He eased his wrists out of Harry’s grasp. “I promise, I’m sure.” He gave Harry a firm kiss before lifting his jumper over his arms and tossing it somewhere to the side. Next, he pulled off Harry’s shirt, laughing when it snagged on his glasses.
Weasley looked very much as though he didn’t want to answer. Granger prodded him again. He glanced over at Harry before heaving a sigh and saying, “Maybe. Depends if Gudgeon plays or not.”
“I’m not going without you,” Draco said flatly. “And anyway, she won’t be home until later. She’s at that stupid dinner.”
Draco checked his watch—one o’clock. As he watched the minutes tick by, he grew nervous. He hated these Floo meetings with his father. Leading up to them, he spent hours worrying about whether the common room would be empty when the time came, and if not, how to clear it. What would he do if they were caught? And what did his father want with him this time? Even though he was of age, there was a part of him that still feared his father. They had a complicated relationship—before, he had admired his father, and for a long time, he had wanted desperately to be like him, but they weren’t very close. He wondered sometimes about other people’s relationships with their fathers: if they ever ran out of things to say, or felt uncomfortable around them, or were forced to swallow bitter resentment when they did everything they could to gain their approval and their efforts went unnoticed. And then there was the question of his father’s dubious morals. He wasn’t sure what his father believed in anymore, but he had started to suspect that they held differing opinions.
The pivotal question: whether or not to inform his parents. Draco didn’t want to add to his father’s worries, and in all likelihood he was just being paranoid. But still…if there was even the slightest chance that Proudfoot was working for the Ministry, or informing the Wizengamot, his father would want to know, wouldn’t he? In the past, his father had rarely appreciated his insights; he generally preferred that Draco do what he was told without meddling. Once again, he found himself desperate for someone he could trust to guide him, someone who had his best interests at heart. There had been Severus, of course, but—no, too painful, still too painful to think about. Looking out at the lake, he wondered, as he so often did, if everyone else had such a complicated relationship with their parents…did other people have to constantly ask themselves whether they should be honest with their parents, and to what extent? Of course, it could be worst...he could have parents who didn’t care at all…or no parents, like Potter…
“Hermione gave me a list of O.W.L.- and N.E.W.T.-level spells. We’ll go through them and decide what to practice each week.”
improved under her tutelage. Sprout, meanwhile, had them caring for their own Bouncing Bulbs, which they were expected to visit every couple of evenings to water and tend to. And while Proudfoot organized the majority of their classes around practical drills, he assigned them complicated theoretical essays that required them to consult several books in the library. More than once Draco cursed himself for taking so many N.E.W.T.s—Granger was the only other one taking seven, to his knowledge—but he needed every advantage he could get.
“You…we don’t…” Draco struggled to put into words what he was feeling. Finally, he said quietly, "Happy birthday."
it’s not coming, you must have tossed it somehow, or ruined it”—but she wouldn’t listen. It wasn’t until three that she finally relented and followed them out to the grounds to continue their sketches for Herbology.
Draco reread the note several times. There was a lump in his throat as he thought of his mother, alone in the Manor. They had done their best to tidy it over the summer, but there had hardly been any time between their hearings. One night, after his father had retired to the study, they had aired out the sitting room. His mother now detested that room, and so did he—too many painful memories. Over and over, as they rearranged the furniture and cleaned out the grate, his mother had insisted that she was going to redecorate.
Slughorn stared at him. Apparently, he hadn’t been expecting an interruption. After a moment, he said, “Well, then perhaps you might reduce your course load. Six N.E.W.T.s, boy, it really isn’t necessary…”
As they exited the teachers’ box, Harry reached forward and grasped Draco’s wrist. He hesitated, and then said, “I’d hug you right now. I want to. But I don't want to make you uncomfortable."
Slughorn sighed and lowered himself back into his chair. “Well—yes, that’s all. Take some pamphlets if you like.” He waved his hand at the glossy brochures in front of him, but Draco was already halfway out the door.
Draco stumbled back, gasping. His head was pounding. He fell into his father’s armchair, gripping his head, as Harry came to crouch down next to him.
Harry hesitated, as though waiting to see if Draco would change his mind. When he didn’t, Harry drew him in and kissed him again, this time hungrily, as though he, like Draco, had imagined this moment hundreds of times before. Draco, urgent to feel some kind of contact, slipped his hands under Harry’s jumper, and then under his shirt, sighing as he finally felt smooth, warm skin. He could hardly believe his own boldness. Harry gasped into Draco’s mouth, rocking his hips forward ever so gently. Draco traced his fingertips along Harry’s sides. It felt nearly forbidden, groping Harry under his clothes, and that thrilled him. And Harry was so quick to respond—wonderful little noises were coming out of his mouth as Draco traced along his ribs.
Draco pulled his hands away from his face to look at Potter properly. On top of everything else—the aching remnants of pain, the first pulls of a headache, the nausea twisting his stomach, and the very odd sense that he had forgotten another important memory—he was now overwhelmed with a deluge of shame. “Right,” he said awkwardly.
“Yeah.” This time, the burn was more acute. It stung as Harry pushed in. He reminded himself that Harry was there, that Harry would take care of him, that Harry took care of everything. “Talk to me,” Draco said. To his own ears, he was slurring. “I want to hear your voice.”
“It’s not like that!” Frustrated, Draco barely managed to rein in his anger. “He’s helping me with my Mark. Look.” Draco yanked up his sleeve. The Mark was hardly more than a grey blotch against his skin.
“I’m not,” he said simply. “Ask Bradley yourself—every time I came, I shouted your name. He thought it was funny. God, I was obsessed with you. Why did you think I had to learn Occlumency so quickly?”
Harry protested, but it didn’t seem to matter. Winky and Kreacher led them to the furthest table, ensuring they were comfortable before heading off to rummage through the cupboards.
The Quidditch pitch had become his sanctuary until one incredibly awkward afternoon when Harry and his friends suddenly burst out of the Gryffindor changing room just as Draco settled into his usual spot. He froze as he saw Harry, both Weasleys, Finnegan, and Thomas stroll onto the pitch. He hoped he wouldn’t be spotted, but, of course, he was as unlucky as ever. Ron Weasley almost immediately noticed him. Even at that distance, Draco recognized the look of displeasure on his face. The Gryffindors stood there stupidly, looking between him and Harry, until finally Draco's mind connected with his feet and he jumped up. He hurried down the stands. He wasn’t sure why—he hadn’t done anything wrong, or particularly embarrassing—but he felt absolutely mortified at being caught alone by Harry of all people. He tried to reason with himself as he rushed back to the castle, but by then he heard Harry and his friends calling to each other as they flew above the pitch. Those moments were perhaps the most miserable of all. Harry seemed so unbothered, as though nothing had happened between them. And, inevitably, Draco felt a sharp pang of jealousy when he saw Harry with his friends. Try as he might, he couldn’t seem to push away the absurd voice in his head whispering ‘
“I…I don’t know.” Draco pulled out his wand and tapped on the apple core, Vanishing it. “I think it’s something I would be interested in. But…I don’t know if I could work at the Ministry, after what happened over the summer. Every day I would go in for work, and I would remember, you know.”
As they took off, he glanced over at the Gryffindor table. Potter was talking animatedly with Weasley. Fury boiled up in him. Did Potter not care at all what had happened at Hogwarts only a few months ago? How were he and his friends so carefree? In Potions class Potter was as unbothered as ever. On Wednesday he and Weasley had managed to make a spectacular mess of their potion, and Draco found them later laughing hysterically about the look on Slughorn’s face. He supposed N.E.W.T.s meant nothing to Saint Potter, who would be hired wherever he applied even if he didn’t sit a single exam.
Harry blinked at him. Slowly, he shook his head. “Not really. You were just waiting around. Macnair, though…”
“Easy, Potter,” Draco hissed, holding out an arm to stop them from colliding. But Potter steadied himself. The door swung back behind him.
“S-so am I," Draco mumbled. As she resumed her humming, he glanced over at her nervously. "Daphne, er…you won’t tell anyone about this, will you?”
She shook her head, bringing her hands to rest on his shoulders. “You did very well. I knew you wouldn’t abandon your father.”
“Naudiz is…give me a second.” Daphne sat back in her chair. They were in the library quizzing each other. Draco was surprised to find that he had nearly succeeded in learning all of the runes in chapter five.
“You have no idea how awkward it would be. And there’s a dinner tonight—this stupid dinner they put on for all the pure-bloods. Well, they don’t
He closed the sketchbook and slipped it onto the pile. Then, in the muted light of the greenhouse, Draco undid the buttons on his cuff. He pulled up his sleeve, holding it away from his sensitive skin just as Harry usually did for him. His Mark was barely visible. It might have been mistaken for a bruise, or perhaps a splotch of ink, as if he had been writing and his bare arm had rubbed against his parchment. This was the first time he had examined his Mark without Harry, in broad daylight. To his surprise, the nausea didn’t come. The anger didn’t come. Nothing came except a dull sense of regret. Regret for what he had done, and for everything he wished to atone for but couldn’t. But the Mark itself didn’t seize him with the agony he had expected.
“How can you say that?” he demanded, leaning forward in his armchair. “How can you still treat me like a child, when I’m here risking my neck for you, again?”
“Can I ask you a question?” Draco turned to him. “This internship thing. Why did they stick you with me?”
“I’m fine,” he snapped. “And you still haven’t gotten through my Shield Charm, so I don’t know what you’re boasting about.”
And that proved to be too much for him, because now he was assaulted with Vincent’s haunting shrieks, and the scalding heat of the Fiendfyre as it raced after them, and the fear leaping in his chest, threatening to engulf him, as he clutched Harry’s waist and they barrelled towards the door…
“Yeah,” she said brightly. “I’ve composed my own pieces. The music class here is brilliant, although mum…she doesn’t really want me taking it for my N.E.W.T.s.”
Briskly, he yanked down his sleeve and redid his cuff. Shouldering his satchel, Draco took one last look around the greenhouse before heading back outside. Harry was waiting for him in the library, but he didn’t hurry back. At that moment, it felt like they had all the time in the world.
This time, he didn’t have to push the holly wand away; Harry stopped of his own accord, speaking gently as Draco toppled out of the memory. His Mark burned angrily. Uncomfortable in Granger’s presence but unable to stop himself, Draco grabbed at his arm, gritting his teeth.
“Well, he can’t just punish you whenever he feels like it. He’s not a teacher,” said Millicent. Draco winced at her words—Potter hadn’t exactly punished him, had he? Though he had certainly been stern with him...
“It was him,” Draco said, clutching his arm against his chest. “It was Macnair, but I don’t understand, I can still see, I can still
Fuming, he replied, “I’m not tired. I’m fed up with all this.” Realizing that he could just clean the spot with a Scouring Charm, Draco took out his wand, but he was too shaken to manage it. It terrified him to be fighting with Pansy like this—he hated conflict, hated arguments, hated disagreeing with one of his only friends. But now that he had started, he couldn’t seem to stop. “You think anyone really cares about the Sacred Twenty-Eight?”
“I’ll see you then.” Slughorn turned, took a step forward, and then looked back at him. His normally affable expression was a bit pinched as he said, “Everything alright, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Yeah?” he asked breathlessly. God, that was hot—the thought of Potter here, in this bed, thinking of him.
Draco felt his chest constrict in fear. He had spent years pushing everything away, shoving every unpleasant thought and agonizing memory under the rugs littered about his mind until there was nothing left to spook him. The thought of remembering, of going through those memories bit by bit, went against every survival instinct he had.
He settled onto his stomach, pressing his forehead against his hands. The smell of the earth soothed him. It was grounding, reassuring, a reminder that there was an immovable weight beneath him that would never falter.
Potter led him out of the shop and into the cold. The rain had subsided, though it was still overcast.
Draco wanted to resist, but it was so difficult to deny Harry anything. He sat at the edge of his chair, looking up at Draco with his wide, green eyes. His face was slightly flushed from the wine, and his hair was as messy as usual. In his red jumper and jeans, Draco thought him absolutely irresistible. And that was why, he told himself, he rolled his eyes and said, “Fine. Let’s go. Maybe the fresh air will sober you up."
“Mmm?” Distractedly, she glanced over, and then her eyes widened in surprise. “Oh, wow.” She brought her wand to illuminate what little remained of his Mark. “You can hardly see it.”
“Of course. Patronuses, then, until the holidays. And we’ll meet again in January to discuss your plans for next term.”
They exchanged nervous smiles, and then Harry dug the tip of his wand into Draco’s skin. “Three…two…one…”
“My memories,” Draco said stiffly. He felt ill at ease under Lovegood’s watchful stare. “You said they’re repressed.”
“That wasn’t bad,” Harry said, grinning. He disembarked and sat next to Draco, rubbing his gloved hands together. “It’s cold. We should go in soon.”
She looked up at him, amused. “Since when are you such a stickler for the rules? You’re like a doting father this year.”
“Too much clothes.” Brusquely, Potter sat in Draco’s lap and started to peel off their shirts. It was unbearably hot in the room. Draco reached over to the bedside table for his wand, but Potter stopped him.
“Not at all, it wasn’t a trouble,” he said, finally letting go of Draco’s hand. “Ludo would have been here, of course, but he’s never in one spot for too long these days. Still, you're a fine Seeker, Mr. Potter! I’m very happy with what I saw today.”
“You’re telling me you would have done it?” he asked fiercely. “If the Dark Lord told you to torture someone, you’d have done it?” Before Harry could answer, he said, “You wouldn’t. You’d have never. Even if it meant he’d kill you.”
Draco sat down on his bed, the little note clutched in his hand. He had read it over a dozen times already, but he hoped that some hidden meaning or indication of how he should respond might appear. It was late—he would most definitely miss lunch. Soon, Pansy and Blaise would come looking for him. And he would tell them…what? What was there to say? How could they possibly understand, when their own parents—although eccentric, although unusual, although mind-numbingly meddlesome—generally enjoyed normal relationships with their children? Draco looked down at the note once again, taking in each word as he scrambled to make a decision.
“I keep telling you, we’re doing too much at once,” Potter growled. “You need a break in-between. When Hermione and I—” He broke off and looked away.
The world narrowed to just the two of them. Potter’s cheeks were ruddy, his lips red and wet, his eyes closed. There was something so shameless about the way he sucked cock, as though he was lost in it. His hair was messier than ever. Draco couldn’t help but reach out and cup Potter’s face. He needed to touch him, to know that he was really there. His presence was grounding. Potter had settled into a rhythm now, holding the base of Draco’s cock firmly. He was mortified as he realized that he was close. That familiar, tight knot was curling in the base of his stomach, and he found it impossible to do much else than watch as Potter brought him closer to the edge.
“Really?” Harry pulled back and eyed him critically. “You’re going to show up in the tightest shirt I’ve ever seen, and trousers that leave
At that, a low buzz of whispers erupted among the eighth years at all four tables. “You will,” McGonagall said, voice rising, “be meeting with your Heads of house tomorrow to discuss your career plans after Hogwarts, and to the fullest extent possible, we will be organizing opportunities for you to complete some basic job training in addition to your coursework.”
you remember, and then you and Blaise went off to your dorm. No one else was up there. And the next day all you would tell me was that you two fell asleep.”
“From where I was standing, I didn’t see you making much progress either, Blaise,” he drawled. The others tittered as Zabini gazed down at him imperiously. He looked as though he was about to snap back, but instead he gave Draco a wicked smile and threaded his arm through his.
Despite himself, Draco recoiled as fear flooded through his body. If the Wizengamot decided to use Veritaserum on him, he was doomed. He had escaped Azkaban once, thanks to Harry, but he doubted he could manage it again. And what if they decided to use the Dementor’s Kiss on him?
weren’t you wearing your gloves? This is a N.E.W.T.-level class, Mr. Malfoy. You of all people should know to wear your gloves…”
“You’ll be working with Mr. Potter,” she said, brow furrowed. “Didn’t Professor Proudfoot tell you?”
But Draco wasn’t listening. He flung his things into his satchel and, without saying goodbye to Zabini, rushed out of the classroom. As he passed by the Gryffindors, he saw that Weasley was smirking, while Potter stared at him impassively.
“Who knows.” He was startled by a little pang of worry, but he tried not to dwell on it. “Anyway, let’s get started.”
“Father,” Draco said in alarm, “your lawyers have to do something. It’s barbaric. Write to Shacklebolt, he’s not unreasonable, you told me once—"
“Okay.” Two competing thoughts struggled within him—on the one hand, he did like brewing potions, and the position Theo had described with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement certainly sounded interesting. And it wasn’t as though he had many other ideas for a career after Hogwarts. On the other hand, he still felt uneasy whenever he thought of the Ministry. His trial had been gruelling. At each hearing, the entirety of his past had been laid bare, teased apart and dissected so that a room full of strangers could determine his guilt and his fate.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, taken aback. “Why’s he afraid of telling me? Of all people, why would
“I did. And he said it’s alright. But that’s just him, isn’t it? That’s the way he is.” Pansy gave a loud sniff. “Actually, he didn’t really seem to want to talk about it at all.”
what I’m talking about. You feel like you’re going mad, like no matter what you do you can’t shake off this sense that something horrible is about to happen, like the world’s going to end, like you’re going to die, like something awful is coming, but you just don’t know what, or when, or—”
he thought wildly. He felt hot, much too hot, and so he undid his tie and unbuttoned his shirt. Laying there, he replayed the past hour over in his mind—teaching Potter, and then arguing with him, and then, somehow, snogging him. How had they gone from fighting to kissing? Was that Potter’s plan all along? But why? He had seen Potter over the years with Chang, and then with the girl Weasley. There were several blokes at Hogwarts who were like Draco—most of whom he had slept with at some point—and, as they lay there together afterwards, they often discussed who they had been with, and who else they had heard was like them. Never had Potter’s name been brought up. And there was nobody he could talk to about this, absolutely nobody. It was too dangerous. If this got out…but Potter was no doubt back in the Gryffindor common room by now, telling everyone what had just happened…they would all find it hilarious, Draco was sure…
As Harry ambled towards him, hands in his pockets, Draco pulled together his courage. “I don’t want to fight. I’m sick of it.”
“What!” Pansy leapt up; the wine sloshed ominously in the bottle. “But you can’t leave! You need to help us finish this!”
And what about himself? Who was going to hire him? Where would he live? He couldn’t bear the thought of going back to the Manor after he left Hogwarts. The place stunk of death. He wished his parents would just set the Manor and its gardens on fire and let it all burn to ashes. Maybe that would stop the screams that haunted his nightmares. And that was another thing—his nightmares. When would he start feeling normal again? Did everyone else feel like this? Was everyone as affected as he seemed to be? Was he just weak? Or was this a fitting punishment for all those times he hadn’t refused his father, hadn’t refused the other Death Eaters, hadn’t refused the Dark Lord, had joined in even when he had started to question everything. But he had saved Potter, hadn’t he? He had lied in the face of his aunt and his parents, hadn’t he? Did that absolve him? Who was keeping track? Who judged these things? And Potter. Bloody Potter. Why had he kept his old wand? Why was he being so…civil? Why had he come back to Hogwarts at all? Surely the Ministry was ready to offer him any job he fancied. He could probably be Minister in a few years. So why come back to Hogwarts, especially since following the rules and studying had always seemed beneath him?
Draco sat up and tried to rip away his arm, but Harry held it tightly, refusing to let him go. Snarling, he twisted his free hand into the blanket, trying to steady himself.
“I should think so! Scorpions are quite scary, aren’t they? But they have to be, to protect themselves. They don’t want to fight, either—they’ll hold off as long as they can before attacking.” Giggling, Daphne added, “I thought for sure it would be a snake.”
“So why did you save me?” he yelled. “You should have left me there! Should have left me there to die, with Vincent!”
“Right.” Draco hesitated, and then asked, “You’re staying at Hogwarts for the holidays, aren’t you?”
Draco glared over his shoulder at him. “I don’t need your bloody money, Potter, for fuck’s sake. Just leave me alone.”
They sat in silence, Draco trying to relax but acutely aware of Potter’s eyes on him. Finally, he snapped, “Talk about something.”
But Harry looked very real to him as he walked back and set a vial of olive oil onto his desk. And he sounded very real when he said, “Can I ask you something?” Without waiting for an answer, he went on in a low voice, “You said there had been complaints about your marks, right? That’s why Slughorn talked to you in the first place?”
” They were shrouded in darkness. Instantly, he relaxed, even as he felt the familiar press of Harry’s wand against his arm.
His mother shrugged. “Things have changed. Your father and I agreed. You need your independence…To start a new life, if you want.” As he opened his mouth to speak, she held up a hand. “
Slughorn clapped his arm, causing Draco to wince, but he seemed to take no notice. “There’s a good lad. Go on, then. And I expect you to be on time for our meeting this afternoon.”
He groaned through his orgasm, eyes squeezed shut, allowing himself for just a few seconds to feel everything he felt for Potter all at once.
Draco looked at her. “And you don’t think what my father did was cruel? You don’t know what he’s done, what he’s capable of, the things I’ve seen him do.”
Draco stumbled out of the shower, catching himself on the vanity. Shaking, he reached in and shut off the water. He took one of the towels next to the sink and dried himself, avoiding his reflection. He didn’t want to see how scared he had become. He didn’t want to see how little of the Mark there was left. He couldn’t live like this anymore, he knew. It was time to set things right. He pulled on his pyjamas and then headed back into his room, where Harry was still lounging on the bed.
That name caused his heart to lurch painfully, but he pushed the rising panic away. “Our meeting, sir?” Draco frowned.
“Mother, I…the Portkey…” Draco shook his head. He didn’t want to apologize, but confronted with his mother’s gaunt face, he felt a sharp twist of guilt pierce through his stomach. “I just…it was…I couldn't anymore, I really couldn't…”
“We’re supposed to gossip all night. And then we’re supposed to dance to the terrible music they put on. And then we’re supposed to steal a bottle of wine and hide in Blaise’s bathroom and drink until someone finds us.”
“I’ll ask Hermione again,” Harry said, a doubtful look on his face. “We can skip tonight, if you want. Give you a break.”
“After that, I realized that you’d changed. And that it was wrong of me to try to pretend you were something you used to be before. Because the mouse wasn’t a toad anymore, was it? It was a mouse.”
The owl hooted at him angrily before shuffling across the windowsill and soaring out into the night. Draco rubbed absently at the sore spot on his hand where it had nipped him. Irritated, he pushed past Harry and threw himself onto the sofa, staring moodily at the letter in his hands. Harry, who had the look of someone hoping not to detonate a bomb, came to sit next to him.
They nodded in agreement. Gesturing to the four firewhiskies already on the table, Theo said, “I thought I’d get us started.”
“What?” Theo looked up at him, confused. “Pansy didn’t tell me anything. Why? What shouldn’t she have told me?”
Draco had finally started to sleep at night. There were still nightmares, of course. Some were clearer than others. He often dreamed about the Manor: scenes of his parents fighting, the Death Eaters duelling, the Dark Lord’s cruel eyes. Other times, his dreams were hazy, blurred, filled with screams and terrible gasps of pain that he couldn’t quite identify. And yet, despite these nightmares, Draco still managed to sleep for a few hours. It was a first for him. He was furious, then, when someone shook him awake.
“Right. I don’t mean accept what they did—because it’s awful, like you said. But accept that it happened. Accept that those are your parents, and no matter what, you can’t change that. You can’t change
The thought that Granger had been watching him—and had, by the sounds of it, perhaps felt sorry for him—was discomfiting. Uneasy, Draco snorted. “I’m fine.”
sorry,” Potter said in a tired voice. He exhaled sharply, pushing the hair from his face. “I don’t want to fight anymore. Please? We’ve fought enough. I want us to get on.”
opened my presents Christmas eve. It’s a Malfoy tradition.” Harry ducked his head, and Draco suspected he might be laughing at him, but he continued on: “We’ll need to pack. And I can guarantee my mother won’t let us go first thing in the morning—you’ll see. First, she’ll want us to stay for breakfast. Then, she’ll bring out the photo albums. She does that every single time I have friends over. Then, she’ll want to show us some new piece of furniture she’s bought, or some new painting. We won’t be back until dinner.”
“Maybe. But you’re both remarkable wizards. Your problem is…you both need to take that raw talent and master it.”
“You will!” she said, brightening. “Nobody will bother us with you around. And I thought maybe, if it looks like you’re okay with it, then the others might be, too.”
Draco strode towards Pritchard and pulled him away roughly. Ignoring his indignant yelp, he hissed into his ear, “Put your wand away, you idiot.”
Draco slipped past the oak tree and into the clearing. The air was so cold that it bit his cheeks. He was nervous—he didn’t want to see more memories about Macnair. He didn’t know if he could stand it. Emotionally, he was wobbling near the edge of a dangerous precipice, and he wasn’t sure where the plummet might lead. He had been waiting for this night all week; if Harry was right, he might finally be rid of his Mark. But now that it was here, he wasn’t sure how to feel. His Mark bothered him less often these days. He could go hours without noticing it. But there were still the flashbacks, the tremors in his hands, the panic. He hoped against hope that removing his Mark would put all of that to rest.
Flourish and Blotts was filled to bursting. The air smelled deliciously of cinnamon and cloves; the packed shelves were strung with glittering garlands. As Blaise hunted down the book for his mother, Draco and Theo perused the latest titles.
“Then what’s…what’s going on?” Draco asked. “This has never happened before. They’re not just memories—it’s like I’m there again.”
“This is nothing like that.” Draco kissed him again, so softly their lips barely touched. But Harry was still frowning. “It’s like every time you touch me, I forget a little more. I become myself a little more.”
As they wove through the students and made their way to the Slytherin table, Draco quickly realized that only a handful of Slytherins had returned for their eighth year. Along with those he had shared a compartment with on the train, he saw Millicent and Daphne huddled at the end of the table. Draco felt vulnerable, exposed, acutely aware of the glares and whispers directed towards the Slytherins. Instinctively, he wrapped his hand tightly around his forearm where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin.
Potter looked back down at his text, frowning. Growing restless, Draco levitated their dishes towards the sink. They floated down neatly until the very end, when he lost control and they dropped with a clatter. His magic was so rough around the edges here. He himself felt worn, as though being in this house was slowly unraveling him. The heat didn’t help, either. Draco leaned back in his chair, considering Potter, watching as he continued to work his way through his textbook. It wasn’t as though he had anywhere else to be.
“It shouldn’t be easier for me,” Draco spat. “I didn’t make it easier for Ollivander, for you, for Katie Bell, for…” He buried his face in his hands, ashamed.
“Forget it.” Sentimentality had always been uncomfortable between them; it just didn’t feel right. “Let’s go, come on. They’ll be looking for us.”
“Smart bird, isn’t he?” Pansy said, shading her eyes to watch as the enormous owl fluttered up to the West Tower.
He was stunned into silence. It was strange, first of all, to think of Harry as nervous. Over the years, Draco had come to see him as self-assured, confident, if not outright arrogant. And then there was the fact that Harry had wanted him there to assuage his nerves. Unwilling to reveal how pleased he was, Draco said, “But what about Weasley? Or Granger?”
“My mother…” He rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling, trying to decide how to respond. “She’s an interesting woman, my mother. She’s never said it, but I’ve always thought she wanted more children. I know she and you had your…differences. A lot of differences.” Harry chuckled next to him. “But she was a very good mother. Especially before everything fell apart like it did. She’d bring me places all the time. We traveled loads. Being an only child, I guess I didn’t really have that many friends growing up. My father’s friends, some of them had children, so we’d play together when we went on holidays or when they visited the Manor. But really…most of the time it was just my mother and me. But it wasn’t lonely. It was quite nice.”
“I don’t think it’ll go that far. Shacklebolt hates the dementors, everyone knows that. But if your father’s lawyers have any other tricks up their sleeves, now would be the time to use them.” He hesitated, and then said, “Do you think they have any other arguments? Or evidence?”
“Okay.” Harry was studying his face, as though trying to understand what this meant. “So do we stop, then? Do we let it go?”
“But…” He saw Pansy’s eyes flit down to his arm before coming back up to examine his face. She looked terrified. “Why else would it hurt?”
he pulled his wand out on you. If I’d had my wand, I’d have cursed him, no questions asked. You don’t
Sighing to himself, Draco reached over to set his wand on the bedside table before turning to scoop Harry into his arms. “If you say so.”
“In my fifth year, we rode the Thestrals to the Ministry,” Harry said, turning to squint at the Forbidden Forest. “But I don’t know how we’d find them, now, in the dark…they could be anywhere in there…”
“I need you to know something.” Harry had moved so that he knelt in front of Draco. “You didn’t deserve it. None of it. I didn’t want any of that to happen to you.”
As the lesson finally ended, the atmosphere was tense. Draco was packing up his things when he noticed Proudfoot hovering by the door, arms crossed. He wondered how long he had been there. Without saying goodbye to anyone, he slipped past Proudfoot, crossed the entrance hall, and went straight out the double doors, ignoring Pansy as she called for him. It was bitterly cold out, but he refused to cast a Warming Charm, preferring to punish himself with the brutal whip of the wind. He stalked along the winding path to the lake, shoving his hands into his pockets. The cold was like a strange sort of atonement, though for what, he couldn’t say.
She shrugged, sniffling. “I can’t remember. I think I added the ingredients in the wrong order. Or maybe I heated up the cauldrons too quickly. I’ve been getting a lot better at brewing Potions so I figured, you know, I would do a few batches at once.”
Draco was quickly bogged down with work. Delacour was still relentless: she had threatened them with a quiz sometime in the near future, and they had no idea whether it would be written, practical, or both. She was very particular about their wandwork, repeating over and over the correct way to hold one’s wand during human Transfiguration. Her intense focus on the most minute details was rather infuriating, but Draco had to admit that his spells
“You’d be great,” Theo agreed. “I can put your name forward. I’ll have to check who’s hiring, but it shouldn’t be a problem. You’ll need a letter of recommendation, though.”
Massaging his side, Zabini said, “It’s all anyone would talk about. We found out as soon as we got there.”
“I guess.” Draco was very much aware of the way Potter studied him. Uneasy and looking to get away from Potter’s gaze, he sat up. He wasn’t as nauseous as he had been last time, but he was exhausted. It was as though that memory had sucked out every bit of strength he had left. Worse still, he felt the beginnings of a headache tightening in his temples.
“Yeah. Everyone’s probably asleep, though, so let’s see what we can find…” They had barely taken a step forward when they heard a door burst open at the far end of the room. Two house-elves came spilling out: one of them had bulbous eyes and great, bat-like ears, while the other was perhaps the oldest house-elf Draco had ever seen. They both wore neat little uniforms.
—the things they did, you don’t know, you have no idea.” He was rambling, he knew. But there was no way to put into words the terrible things he had seen, no way to convey the depths of depravity he had witnessed. “I didn’t know, when I started. Or, no, I knew. But I didn’t get it. Didn’t understand. Honestly, I believed what my parents said.
“Can I ask you something?” Before Potter had a chance to respond, Draco said, “Why did you act like you cared? Why bother carrying on, talking to Granger about it and bringing me that potion, when you think it’s a big laugh?”
Harry fiddled with a knot on the wooden table. “Yeah, he…at the Manor. Bellatrix threw her knife at us. And she hit Dobby. He died saving us.”
He sunk down into an empty spot on the sofa next to her. On the way back, he had been thinking up a convincing lie. “He didn’t like the way I was talking to some Ravenclaw girl. No idea what her name is.”
When his father said nothing after several moments, Draco asked, “What about your lawyers? Can’t they do anything? Surely they must be working on some sort of—”
She gave him an exasperated sigh but headed off into the crowd. Draco leaned against the wall, nursing his drink. He usually held his alcohol quite well, but the heat, the noise, and the dark had him feeling almost dizzy. He gave a start as he spotted Daphne rushing towards him, beaming. “Oh, come on, Draco, back me up here. Isn’t it true that we saw an Acromantula by the Forbidden Forest once?” She was followed by Padma Patil, Hannah Abbott, and Sue Li, all of whom seemed quite drunk.
“That’s wrong,” said Draco, pointing at one of the runes Daphne had labeled. “That one there means ‘sun.’”
“Oh, no, this is different,” he said. “I’m not erasing anything. Hermione gave me this potion, here…” Potter reached into his pocket and produced a small, green vial. He passed it to Draco, who turned it between his fingers. The label read
Potter looked down at the envelope in his hands, frowning. “And what about Malfoy’s parents? Any news from them?”
“I’ll take care of that,” said Proudfoot, approaching them from the High Table. “Let’s clear out the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, that should be more than enough room.”
“Already signed up to work as an Auror, have you?” Draco said bitterly. “You’ll have to apply for Investigations. You’ll be brilliant.”
They entered the Slytherin common room, and with a twist of his stomach Draco recalled that he was supposed to be meeting his father by Floo in a few hours. He bid Pansy and Daphne goodnight, feigning a headache, and retreated to his dormitory. It was an early night for him—usually he was awake until at least midnight—but he had another busy day of classes tomorrow, and he wasn’t sure if he would have time to sleep after speaking with his father. He tried to calm himself down by breathing in through his nose and out through his mouth, a technique that usually lessened the worst of his anxiety, but he couldn’t manage to fall asleep. As the night wore on, he heard Nott, Zabini, and Goyle enter their dorm, change into their pyjamas, and then climb into their respective beds. Finally, it was quiet once again.
There was a moment of silence as they considered her words. Very softly, Granger said, “Lavender’s right. It’s not easy to jump back into things.”
“Weasley isn’t pleased,” Draco noted darkly. Harry looked up in time to see Weasley glaring at them before Granger yanked on his arm.
“Yeah.” Draco strained to recall the memory that had just been wiped. If he really concentrated, he could just make out his mother’s angry, beautiful, tormented face, asking him why—
Draco took a deep, shuddering breath. “Well, anyway, my mother always liked him. She felt sorry for him, I think. This was all before my time, so I don’t really know the details, but she looked out for him. Told my father to go easy on him.” He gave a hollow laugh. “Anyway, it didn’t matter, because in the end my father was nothing, and Severus was one of the favourites. And then we found out he was Dumbledore’s man.”
He wanted desperately to open up the vial and confirm his suspicions, but he knew better. After all these years, he was still afraid of his father, and the prospect of angering him was daunting. Besides, there was also the question of whether opening it would be safe. There were extremely complicated potions that spoiled if they were opened too early or by the wrong person. What if he ruined his father’s one chance at escaping the Dementor’s Kiss? What if he accidentally spilled it? And that was another thing—knowing the velvet pouch contained a small, glass vial was horribly nerve-wracking. He now kept it exclusively in his satchel, carefully tucked away at the bottom so as not to crush it under his textbooks. Whenever he accidentally bumped into a student in the busy corridors, the moment he was alone he checked the pouch to make sure that the vial hadn’t broken. Fortunately, it seemed quite robust.
Potter smirked but said nothing. Grasping the base of his cock, he smoothed his lips along the head, kissing and sucking lightly. He suddenly hit a spot that caused Draco to gasp and tighten his grip in Potter’s hair.
“If you say so.” She traced her finger along the red robes as they fluttered on the page. “They aren’t bad, though. I do like the cut.”
“Let me know if he doesn’t answer you in a few days. I’ll go ask.” Before Draco could argue, Harry held up his hand. “I know, I know, you don’t need my help. Try not to see it that way. I’m not helping you, I’m giving myself the opportunity to be the hero again.”
“Harry,” Draco said suddenly. “Do you think we should try to alert Shacklebolt? Or…or anyone who might help? We should have asked Pansy and Blaise to send an owl.”
Finally, Harry stopped, trailing his hand lazily up Draco’s back before reaching for his wand. Draco barely noticed as he cleaned the mess. They lay together, Draco trying to catch his breath, Harry pulling a sheet over him. All of his worries had seeped right out of him. Next to Harry, he felt as though everything was manageable. The outside world and all of its troubles couldn’t possibly reach him here, tucked into Harry’s sheet, nestled under his arm.
Nott opened his mouth to reply, but before he could, Greg said quietly, “I like it. Give us something to do. We won’t be at Hogwarts forever.”
Draco couldn’t decide where to start first. Finally, he settled on licking along Harry’s neck, pleased when that drew a shaky sigh out of him. And then he shifted lower, kissing past his collarbone, trailing barely-there kisses until he took a nipple in his mouth. At that, Harry groaned. His hand came up to hold the back of Draco’s head. Draco sucked and licked, teasing the other nipple between his fingers. Every little sound that came out of Harry’s mouth went straight to his cock. He knew Harry was hard—every once in a while, his hands grazed across the front of his pyjama pants, where his erection was obvious. And that made him nearly desperate with need.
In Potions, they were starting on anti-fungals. Not only were the effects rather dull, but the brewing process itself was tedious and complicated. Draco set up his cauldron as Slughorn reminded them to stir clockwise once, anti-clockwise twice, and then
They shared a meaningful look and then Harry took off. Shouldering his bag, Draco followed the crowd. Daphne was waiting for him by the doors; in his elation, he found that he couldn’t even be mad at her.
He stared at the parchment. His father had spoken to him through Floo while he was at Hogwarts only a handful of times, and always in relation to work they were doing for the Dark Lord. Perhaps he wanted to discuss his hearing, although that wasn’t until the fifth of October. Was there something he wanted Draco to do to help with his trial? What could he possibly do? Surely his father’s lawyers would have thought up some means of making him useful months ago. Before the others could sneak a look, Draco crumpled up the parchment and stuffed it in his pocket, intending to burn it later. He sent Callidus off with a bit of bacon.
“Won’t that be nice!” Turning to Draco, Pansy said, “Won’t that be nice, Draco? It’s so important to spend the holidays with your parents, I think.”
Daphne was unbothered. “Come on, Draco,” she said gently. “Let’s get you to the Room of Requirement.”
Harry gently placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “I’m going to hug you. Alright?” Draco nodded, and Harry rose to his knees, pulling Draco against his chest. Slowly, Draco wound his arms around Harry’s waist, hugging him back. He gave out a long, shuddering breath as he listened to Harry’s heartbeat. It was slow, steady, soothing.
“Spellwork, Proudfoot said. I guess a lot of them need practice sessions after…everything that happened last year.”
Silently, Harry loosened the drawstrings and pulled out the glass vial. He held it up, turning the vial in his fingers as it glinted in the moonlight.
Draco closed his eyes as a shudder passed through him. If he focused on it too long, he knew exactly the sensation Harry was referring to—a sickening sense of dread that seemed to emanate from his arm, cloaking him in grief.
They continued down the path, his mother’s letter burning a hole in Draco’s pocket. Every time he thought of her, a great surge of guilt crashed through him. The problem was, he already had so much to be remorseful for. Soon, he feared, he would grow numb to the guilt.
“Your Occlumency.” Potter rolled his eyes, but Draco held his shoulders tightly. “No, listen. Your Occlumency. You have to keep going. It’s one of the only ways you can protect yourself from the Dark Lord."
Although Draco didn't want to fight with her, he couldn’t help but snap, “It’s not really your business, anyway.”
“Good…very good.” His father cleared his throat, and then said, “Well, Draco. We have a bit of a difficult matter we need to discuss. As you know, my next hearing is October fifth. Things are…not going very well.”
Coming to his senses, Draco held back up his wand, pointing it at the doorway. Finally, when it seemed that Proudfoot was truly gone, Draco let his arm fall. “Thank God you were here.”
Potter looked up at him sharply, but nobody protested. Gathering his things, he made his way up to his bedroom. Sitting at his desk, rewriting the foot of parchment, he tried to ignore the drone of conversation from downstairs. With any luck, Lupin would be able to cure Potter of his moodiness. Draco’s nerves were already worn. If they fought, he feared that he would lose his temper completely. And if this was one of their last nights together…for a moment, the page before him went blurry. Mortified, Draco wiped his eyes.
Blaise glanced over at Finnigan, who was staring back at them. He seemed just as astonished as Blaise.
Draco tried his best to forget about his encounter with Potter. It was difficult, of course, particularly at night. He would toss and turn for hours, certain that he could still feel Potter’s mouth on his. And yet he also swore it must have been some hallucination or nonsensical dream. There were times when he lay in bed, fingers tracing the green curtains floating near his face, and in the safety of the dark he admitted to himself that he had perhaps eyed Potter once or twice over the years. Certainly, as a Quidditch player, he was quite lithe. And maybe he had noticed how Potter’s messy hair curled around his ears, how his uniform shirt fit around the broadening expanse of his shoulders, how he grinned whenever Weasley said something particularly daft. And of course there were Potter’s vivid green eyes. And his hands: Draco had noticed around sixth year that Potter’s hands were quite large, and certainly stronger than his own. There had been a few times when he had glanced over at Potter gripping his wand. He always held the bloody thing so tightly, so firmly. And maybe once in a while, as any other teenager might, his thoughts had trailed off, thinking of what else Potter might hold just as firmly.
“Draco,” Blaise said after taking a sip of his drink. “I had someone asking about you the other day.”
Five to nine. Sitting in the relative silence of the common room, he swore he could hear his mother’s voice calling for him. Her cries mingled with those of the people he had seen tortured, maimed, and killed. He stood abruptly, shoved his textbook into his satchel, and then strode out of the common room before he could change his mind. He half hoped he would run into his friends and be forced to change his plans, but he traipsed through the castle undisturbed. As he made his way down the length of the seventh-floor corridor, he wasn’t surprised to see the polished door set into the wall. Grasping the handle, he took a deep breath, and then pushed his way in. The room was different, this time: while still mostly bare, it now held a large, worn couch, on which Potter was sat.
Finally, Daphne relented, disentangling herself from his arms and scurrying upstairs. Avoiding Pansy’s eyes, Draco climbed the stairs to his own dormitory, followed by Nott and Zabini. Greg was already asleep.
Before Draco could respond, Harry headed for the store cupboard. Blaise looked back at him, eyes wide. “
They slipped out of the study as quietly as they had entered. Draco pulled the door shut, pausing to check that his mother hadn’t woken. When he heard nothing, he took Harry’s wrist and pulled him down the hallway, opening the door for him and then closing it behind them. The moment the door snapped shut, Harry was crowding him against it, his lips hovering just above Draco’s.
As Potter glanced over at Cauldwell yet again, Draco hissed, “Would you stop staring? Honestly, Potter, I didn’t know you were such a prude. I’m sure you have witches lining up, ready to have a turn.” At that Potter turned scarlet.
Draco twisted his hands in the sheets as Harry kissed along his jaw. He bit roughly at a spot on Draco’s neck, refusing to relent until he keened and squirmed. Finally, he drew back, and then licked tenderly at the spot as Draco shuddered.
Draco looked up as though he hasn’t noticed him there. Giving an exaggerated sigh, he said, “It’s that time, is it? Lucky me.”
“Alright then,” Potter said slowly, scrutinizing him. Draco absolutely hated it when Potter analyzed him like that. He wanted to get back to his dormitory, to sink into his warm blankets and
“Our spot,” Harry said, as though testing the words on his lips. Touched, Draco smiled, and then leaned forward to kiss those same lips again.
“In the D.A.,” Potter said, ignoring Draco’s derisive snort, “we taught students from different years together. Skill doesn’t always depend on what year you’re in.”
“Oh, you know what I mean. You haven’t got to worry about grades, or weird blokes trying to kiss you wherever you go, or your parents…you probably don’t even know your parents, do you?” He gazed out the window. From here, he could see the Gryffindor team shuffling up the path to the castle. They were rather subdued. Perhaps Slytherin had won. He should have been happy, but he knew the others would probably be up all night celebrating, and the very thought exhausted him. Maybe he could spend the night in the Owlery…or slip out to the grounds once everyone had retreated to the dungeons. For now, he was content to sit with Callidus, surveying the grounds as the last few students trickled indoors. It was nearly lunchtime; usually after a Quidditch match there was quite a spread. But he had very little appetite.
“You will not,” he said flatly. “Or I’ll write to yours. I’m sure your mother would just love to hear about what you got up to in France last summer.”
?” Harry teased. He pulled Draco towards him and pressed a kiss to his head. “You have a terrible memory.”
That was Finnigan’s voice. Draco closed his eyes, vowing to never attend a party with Pansy ever again.
He hovered just on the edge of that descent into tight, hot tension that signaled the point of no return. He wanted so badly to come, to feel Potter take him over that edge, but he seemed to be in no hurry. Potter was rubbing Draco at a torturously slow pace, occasionally dipping down to press soft kisses against his lips. It occurred to Draco that he could always just reach down and undress himself, but that didn’t really feel like an option. It was as though he was watching the scene unfold from somewhere above them, helpless to do much more than take it as Potter gave him both too much and not nearly enough at all.
For several minutes, neither of them spoke. Crying had been cathartic, as though someone had wrung every last emotion out of his body. He had room for little else than the numb exhaustion that permeated him. He told himself that Potter was there. That it would be fine. That nothing bad could happen to him as long as Potter was there. Suddenly, he said, “You called me Draco.”
“You're right. Hang on.” Pansy sat up and rooted through her bag. She pulled out a worn, emerald deck. “These were my nan’s. They’re ancient. But I don’t think they like me very much. None of the readings I do make any sense.”
At first, Draco felt sorry for Brown—or Lavender, rather, as she insisted they call her. Squeezed between four Slytherins in the corner of the pub, it would have been easy to feel intimidated, or out of place. But Lavender easily held her own, interrogating them about their eighth year at Hogwarts and leading them in a discussion of the Wanderers’ chances against Puddlemere. The results of Greyback’s attack were visible even in the dim light of the pub: several scars extended from her brow down the side of her face, reaching back behind her ear and disappearing beneath her hair. They seemed not to bother her at all. The entire thing was disconcerting—Draco found it difficult to imagine that the woman in front of him had once been the rather silly girl he had gone to school with.
But nobody listened. They squeezed through the pub, Draco and Harry hobbling along, until finally they made it to the door. The moment he stepped outside, Draco’s head cleared. The frosty breeze was bracing.
He thought he would lose his mind as he felt Potter’s hot release coat his own cock. Even as he shuddered through his orgasm, one arm coming around Draco’s neck as a means of bracing himself, Potter continued to work on Draco until finally he felt his own orgasm bubbling up. As he tipped over and felt the first pulse of pleasure, Draco dragged Potter towards him and pressed their lips together in a searing kiss. A cry rose up in his throat, and he gave a sharp yell as he came all over Potter’s hand.
“Come on, then, gentlemen,” Proudfoot said cheerily, as though nothing had happened. They followed him to his office, Draco feeling incredibly uncomfortable as he walked next to Harry in silence. There was an awkward moment when Proudfoot opened the door and motioned for them to enter; they both eyed each other, unsure who should go first, until Proudfoot chuckled and said, “Go on, go on, I don’t keep anything dangerous in there.” Harry scowled at Draco and then brushed past him into the office. Glancing over at Proudfoot, who was still smiling amicably, Draco slipped in after him.
“I didn’t do anything!” he said, affronted. “And Potter doesn’t send me anywhere. I told him to piss off and came back.”
“Malfoy,” she said. “Your father’s next hearing is this Monday, isn’t it? It’s been in all the papers.”
“We wanted to ask you about something,” Harry started. “We were curious about what you said the other night, at the pub.”
“Yeah.” Harry took a deep breath. “Alright.” Climbing into Harry's lap, Draco cupped his face and leaned in to kiss him. His encounter with Nott had left him unsteady, ill at ease, but now he found himself anchored as they kissed. When Harry pulled off his shirt, goosebumps prickled along his arms. He purred as Harry held him close. He was warm, so warm, and Draco already felt drunk with need as he kissed along Harry’s neck. He had never been allowed to do this before, and instantly, he knew that he had to make up for lost time. Harry made breathy little noises as he brushed his lips across his neck. Gently, he bit down on the soft flesh, grinning to himself when Harry gave a loud groan.
Once again, Draco’s cheeks felt warm. “The problem isn’t in class,” he said, hoping his voice wouldn’t carry. “It’s after. With homework. I can’t seem to concentrate.”
“That’s too dangerous,” Potter said at once. “The Death Eaters will kill him if they get a hold of him. Voldemort—”
“Professor,” Draco said as politely as he could, “I really have no interest in teaching. So I’m not quite sure why I’m expected to learn how to teach.”
“I don’t think it’s anywhere near finished. They’re out for blood. They want revenge. And I don’t know if I can really blame them.”
“And what did you plan to do in the Room of Requirement, then?” Potter demanded. “You weren’t going to hand me off to Voldemort?”
But Draco couldn’t smile. It was almost impossible to imagine a world in which Harry Potter had died, in which his face wasn’t plastered over every newspaper and every magazine, in which he wasn’t fooling around with his Gryffindor friends and making a nuisance of himself in class. In which he wasn’t now looking at Draco anxiously, the moonlight reflecting off his glasses.
“You don’t like blokes,” he said. He couldn’t help himself—he reached out and rested his hands on Potter’s chest. “So then…what…?”
it’s for the pure-bloods anymore, but it is. For the Sacred Twenty-Eight, all that rubbish. And we aren’t going.”
“Yeah. Alright. I’ll ask her if she can come next week, give us some pointers. What do you lot think?” He turned to the assembled students; several of them were nodding.
Draco looked over at Granger and Weasley, and he could have sworn Granger’s eyes flicked briefly to the edge of the table where Harry gripped his knee. She looked up and met his eyes, and then she said, “Draco’s right, though. Nonverbal magic takes lots of practice. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few hours.”
“She wants to play Quidditch professionally,” Harry said. He rubbed his palm along Draco’s Mark. “Which is fine, you know, it’s better than goofing off…but she’s kind of annoying, now. She’s driving Ron around the bend.”
“Hermione said we should try to consolidate what we’ve done so far,” Potter said, consulting the parchment.
,” she continued, looking up at him with those protuberant eyes. “There’s an article on insomnia, and whether moon frogs are to blame.”
“Er. Yes.” This was technically true: he had composed it, only to lock it away in his drawer of things he would rather forget, along with his mother’s letters.
Harry brought his hand up. Draco had the wild thought that Harry was about to cup his face, but he hesitated before clasping his shoulder. “I’ll talk to Hermione. She might know what to do.”
“Yeah. I’ll have to fuck you in every room in the castle,” Harry muttered against his lips before pulling him in for a kiss. Draco's knees nearly gave out. Kissing Harry felt new every single time—he didn’t think he would ever get used to the shiver that passed through him whenever they touched. As Harry deepened the kiss, weaving his fingers through Draco’s hair, Draco felt himself growing hard. Reluctantly, he pulled away, pressing their foreheads together as he gripped the back of Harry’s neck.
“Of course. That’s obvious. But as teachers, you need to decide on a curriculum of sorts. What exact spells will you be teaching, what constitutes a ‘pass,’ and how will you decide if a student has passed or not?”
Potter gripped him more firmly and continued stroking, glancing up occasionally to note Draco’s reaction. He was trying to control himself, to appear bored, indifferent, detached, but that was easier said than done when Potter was on his knees in front of him. He watched, mesmerized, as Potter took him in his mouth. For a moment, he seemed to hesitate, and Draco was about to tell him to forget about it when Potter gave a long, hard suck. Draco’s head fell back and he covered his face with his hands. Humming to himself thoughtfully, Potter bobbed up and down a few times before pulling back. He lapped at the tip and ran his thumb around it in lazy circles—surely, he meant to drive Draco mad. Draco felt his face flushing, the heat extending to his chest, and he gave a low moan as Potter suddenly took him completely in his mouth.
Potter sat there staring, as though waiting for him to say something else. Draco turned the page in his textbook, pointedly ignoring him, and finally Potter rose to leave. Draco settled into his chair, relieved that he would be alone at last, when Potter said, “Here. I forgot.” He placed Draco’s old wand on the desk. He recognized it instantly—simple hawthorn with a silver grip. He meant to tell Potter that he had already gotten another wand, but as he turned, he saw that he was already gone. Annoyed, Draco carefully picked it up, running his fingers over the smooth wood. He had long suspected that it had been lost or destroyed. Why had Potter kept it? And what good would it do him now? He wanted to be angry, but instead he felt a twinge of sadness. He was being silly. It was just a wand, for God’s sake. And yet he couldn’t help but place it gently in his satchel, nestled among loose bits of parchment and a spare quill. He sat there, eyeing his old wand, when suddenly a crushing sense of dread rushed over him. His stomach twisted into a tight knot. He could hardly breathe; it was as though someone was sitting on his chest. He flattened his hands on the table, trying to get a hold of himself, but the anxiety was overwhelming. He swore he could hear his heart beating and the blood rushing through his veins. He broke out into a cold sweat. He was drowning in the most terrifying sense of dread, although he had no idea
“I just thought Potter would have rubbed off on you more,” Blaise said. His tone was flippant, but as Draco turned to gape at him, he saw that he had a sly grin on his face. “Isn’t he all about mercy and forgiveness?”
“Don’t touch yourself,” Draco warned, as though reading his mind. And that was another thing Harry loved—how in tune they were, predicting each other’s thoughts before they had fully formed.
“Just fine,” she said, a brave smile on her face. “I can’t believe how busy it is, George. You’ve done so well.”
you? What, a Galleon an hour? You could start yourself a real business, Draco. There’s your plan for after Hogwarts.”
“I’ve gotten a letter from my mum,” she said bitterly. “I just finished burning it. Apparently, she isn’t very happy with my grades so far.”
Potter was still writing something out. “So next week we work on Summoning Charms. Everyone who’s already mastered those can try their hand at some nonverbal magic.”
Harry took Draco’s arm and gently leaned him back against his chest. “I don’t mind having you around, though,” Harry said sheepishly.
He hummed to himself, lapping at a spot just next to Harry’s cock. He meant to drive him absolutely mad. “God, I was a slut for you. But what can I say? I wanted to be fucked by the Hogwarts Champion. And you need to know something.” He took Harry’s cock in his hand once again, pumping it a few times. “Cauldwell, Bradley, all the rest…every single time, I thought of you.”
“Yeah. Ron’s playing Keeper again.” Potter held up a hand before Draco had a chance to respond. “Whatever you have to say about him, I don’t want to hear it.”
, I didn’t even react. And at the Battle—God, the Battle, I should have gone to see Voldemort earlier. I should have figured it out sooner. But I didn’t. And so Fred died, and Tonks, and Lupin, and Colin…”
Daphne glanced over at Draco. Frustrated, he snapped, “I never said anything. I’ve got no problem with Dean Thomas. As a matter of fact, I, er…” He urged himself to think, and then said, “We’re going flying together. After the holidays.” As they stared at him, Draco said, “That’s right. With the rest of the Gryffindors. Just…just a nice game of Quidditch.”
“I’ll let you know when I need it. If we can hold off until Christmas, when you come for the holidays...but we’ll see...who knows...” He trailed off and then eyed Draco, considering him. “And your classes?”
“I bet that sort of thing takes hours. There are loads of other people auditioning. And she said she might not be able to get away for a while, remember? There’s a dinner for everyone who’s been accepted.”
“If we keep trying, another memory will show up. I’ve got loads of memories—loads—try to find something about Macnair, maybe, or Voldemort, or…”
Draco was so lost in thought that his fingers had strayed too close to Callidus’ eye; he nipped angrily. “Ouch! Sorry, sorry.” He quickly pulled his hand back. “Sorry…wasn’t paying attention.” The sharp pain in his hand brought him back to reality. Peering around the Owlery, he remembered that he still hadn’t written to his mother yet. Guilt lurching in his chest, he dug through his satchel until he found a spare bit of parchment, his inkpot, and a quill. As he pulled everything out, he noticed both his old wand and the small velvet pouch at the bottom of the bag. At the sight, his anxiety flared. Reminding himself to
“Bit cold to be out, isn’t it?” Proudfoot called. He was wearing a thick cloak lined with fur. His curly hair was wilder than ever. Draco sat there, shocked, as Proudfoot eased down next to him, groaning as one of his knees cracked. “Not as young as I used to be, I’m afraid. Decades of Auror work will do that to you.”
“’Course not.” Harry leaned forward, eyes trained on the Mark. “Ready, then?” Draco nodded, not knowing what else to do. “Three…two…one…”
The sickly-sweet smell of Butterbeer hit him as they pushed through the door. Loud music was playing from a wireless somewhere. There was barely any room to squeeze through, but somehow they managed, claiming a table in a far corner. It was too hot. Too noisy. Too busy. Every eighth- and seventh-year student, it seemed, was packed into the Three Broomsticks: over in a far corner were Harry and his friends; by the bar he spotted Luna Lovegood dressed in gauzy green robes, talking with Ginny Weasley and Longbottom; scattered around the room were Thomas and Finnigan…Patil…Harper…Abbott…his head started to hurt.
It was dreadful weather for a Hogsmeade outing. The ferocious wind pelted them with rain, and it was so chilly that Draco wore his thickest winter cloak. They scurried from building to building, heads bowed as they braced against the rain. Inside Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, they waited as Daphne selected a new inkpot. Draco stood away from the others, pretending to consider a pheasant-feather quill, though in reality he was trying desperately to maintain an air of calm as he panicked. Since they had left Hogwarts, he was constantly looking over his shoulder, terrified that a Ministry agent was following him. The poor weather was a bit of a blessing, as it had driven most students into the warmth of the shops—he hoped Dervish and Banges would be just as crowded. There was also the matter of finding Rochefort: he had no idea what he looked like, or how he was supposed to get the package from him.
“I think Hermione and Ron already know,” he said. “And as for everyone else…they’ll be cross. But they’ll get over it. They have no choice.”
tell one of us not to bother with our N.E.W.T.s. Do you think all the staff agree? Or it’s just Slughorn who doesn’t want to deal with you?”
“Did you know his siblings are all Muggles?” she went on. “I understand why they let them in. Honestly, I do. But they’re just so
“Not at all.” Draco released Harry’s cock. Ignoring his angry protests, he began to kiss his way down his stomach. As he went, he said in a conversational tone, “Actually, no. I think the first time was in fourth year. When I saw you in your dress robes, at the Yule Ball, I wanted you to take me right there.”
“Positive,” he said firmly. “You two have a nice holiday. And look out for an owl, with your gifts.”
Potter shrugged and walked over to the nearest pair, two fifth-year girls who giggled as he approached. This was ridiculous.
But twenty Galleons a week…it was completely, utterly beneath him, and a year ago he would have hexed anyone who would dare suggest he degrade himself for twenty Galleons. However, things had changed. There was the opportunity to assist his parents financially—perhaps pay part of his winter tuition, and relieve his father’s burden—but there was also, niggling at the back of Draco’s mind, the possibility of using that money to escape…to travel, maybe, or to further his magical training somewhere far away…or perhaps to relocate permanently. He felt a surge of guilt whenever these thoughts crept into his mind, but he could not deny the temptation of a life free from the long shadow his father cast. Of course, there was still his mother to consider, but she had made her choice, hadn’t she?
“Let’s get him back to the castle,” Blaise said, supporting Draco as they started to hobble down the street.
"Months? She punched me so hard I couldn’t breathe properly after. Luckily, I don’t think her memory’s the best.”
“Draco.” He looked up in surprise at the serious note in Blaise’s voice. “I’m going to tell you this once, and then we’re going to pretend it never happened. Alright?”
They had barely begun their walk back to the castle when Draco tripped over a root. He clung to a tree for support, gasping as the brittle bark dug into his palms.
There was something stuck in Draco’s throat; he could do nothing more than rest his hands around Potter’s waist. Beneath his jumper, Potter was warm. His waist was thin and firm. As before, it suddenly felt very important to remember every touch, every sensation, every detail.
“Why are you taking this so personally?” he asked. “This is such a stupid argument. All I said is that I’m sick of all this pure-blood rubbish.”
Madam Webb looked as though she was about to explode. She took a step towards Harry, raised her wand, and opened her mouth to speak.
“Not really.” And it was true—the agony had settled into that deep, familiar ache. Instead, it seemed to be his very soul that hurt. He was so tired of this. A part of him was done. Just done.
Draco looked away at the sound of that name. Harry couldn’t have seen anything too horrible, because he could still remember the worst moments…but then, he realized with a start, perhaps there had been other times, even worse than those he could recall…but he wouldn’t know, now, would he?”
“Sit down, sit down,” Proudfoot was saying as he lit several torches along the walls. As Harry and Draco settled into the two available armchairs, Proudfoot conjured a third one for himself. He sat across from them, apparently oblivious to the tension in the room. “Now, then.” He sat back in his chair. “Tea? Either of you?” They shook their heads. “Well, I thought tonight went quite well. What do you both think?”
“Oh, Draco,” Pansy sighed. “This is why I hate reading the paper first thing in the morning. Blaise, can’t you find the Quidditch section?”
“And?” Finding his resolve, Draco grasped the bottom of Harry’s jumper. “I’m right here to pick up the pieces.”
all the time, Draco. You look ill. I didn’t want to say anything, I just thought it was from, you know, everything that happened. But you look awful.”
Something in him shattered every time Potter started using his first name. The sound nearly pushed him over the edge, and so he slowed down, enjoying the heady sensation of Potter tightening around him. Potter curved his back, his face driven into the pillow as he scrambled for purchase on the headboard. Although he was the one in control, Draco knew that he had hardly any power here. As Potter demanded, in a rasping voice, that he fuck him harder, he immediately obeyed, smirking as the other boy gasped and buried his face into the sheets.
