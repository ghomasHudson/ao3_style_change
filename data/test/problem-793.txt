As they settled down into the covers, Harry knew he always would, because this was too good to risk losing.
Harry giggled, running his hand through Draco’s ridiculously soft hair. “Good morning sleepy head, it’s nearly 12pm, I thought it was time you woke up, so now here you are, lovely and conscious!” Harry’s jarring grin made Draco want to stomp all over his boyfriends beautiful face, but he managed to restrain himself.
“Oi mate, wanna go round the back and smoke a cig?” Ron asked him. They’d both picked up the habit after the war and had become frequent smokers. “Yeah go on then, tell them we’ll wait outside.”
Faintly, Draco whispered to Harry, “Help me” before collapsing in his arms.
I’m super sorry all of my chapters are so short, writing 0.5k words and calling it a chapter is so crude, but I’m trying to focus on quality over quantity right now. I’m aiming for the next chapter to be about 3k words so I’m sorry if that isn’t up until Saturday, enjoy guys.
“Why are you being like this?” Harry asked, his voice slightly raised.
“Draco? Did you hear?” Pansy said excitably. He turned in his seat to look at her as she sat next to him in the Slytherin common room.
“Well, you can’t fly with a broken wing, especially not in the storm. So you might as well stay with me until it blows over.” He extended his hand to the angel. For a moment, he didn’t think the other man would take it, but then he felt the cool, slim fingers wrap around his own.
Another chorus of laughter.
Ron chuckled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait, Draco, do you mean?” Draco nodded nervously. Harry slid Draco off his lap and stood up, run his hands through his hair frantically. Then he let out a laugh, and then he broke into an enormous smile and started shouting out in glee.
“We don’t, but I’m sure you can make time for me” Harry spoke confidently as he sat down in his grey muggle suit.
He could feel Harry’s eyes staring into him, so he decided to face them. “What is it, Potter?”
This is the second work in my Drarry Drabbles collection- here is a link to it on
Wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist Harry pulled him so that they were facing each other, and grabbed Draco’s left hand with his right. He lifted his knuckles up to his mouth and kissed down on the golden ring and emerald studded silver ring on Draco’s wedding finger, looking up at him with a smile filled with love.
“It wasn’t like that, I promise-“
For the next three days Harry barely saw Draco. They only had defence and muggle studies in common now, but Draco was clearly avoiding him. He looked good though, his skin was perfect once again and his hair was looking wonderful, which is more than Harry could say for his mess of curls. He’d tried to corner the Slytherin after class a few times but with no luck. Dinner came and went, Draco making no appearance. He noticed Hermione watching him again but he didn’t care.
stopped loving you, not for one second” he whispered as he left.
The blonde clicked his tongue before stepping forward and taking an exaggerated bow.
he could smell the stench of hard liquor on Potter’s breath but just laughed as the boy sat back down. “Lighten up, Potter! Tonight of all nights is a perfect time to get drunk! You’ll be able to blame only lasting 20 seconds with Ginerva on the alcohol!” He was slurring over his words and his head was buzzing. He swallowed as much water as he could but it didn’t help, suddenly he was clasping at his heart and knew he’d made a mistake. “Fuck off, Malfoy.” The other boy snarled at him. He gripped the bar. He could feel himself falling. “Malfoy?” He could hear the concern in his voice. Black. His vision was going. A second later he felt Jacobs hands on his waist steer him away from the bar and Harry slink back into the dark.
“Your highness, I am Draco Malfoy, son of The Malfoys, from no Province. We were stripped of our land and titles so I have absolutely no idea why I have been chosen. I’ve been touched by so many men I may as well be a whorehouse, and I do not willingly seek to be your wife as I am no woman and will make no man a bride!”
“Tell me you love me again” goaded Draco.
“Of course not, sex should always be enjoyable for both parties involved, as I intend for ours to be when you finally warm round to the idea. Now, I could be rather angry at you for wrecking my lovely chambers, but we’ve already started of on the wrong foot”.
“Oh, right, thanks”.
“I love you, Draco. I love you until infinity ends. So will you please, please marry me?” Draco was crying again, but this time out of happiness. “Yes, yes yes!” He exclaimed as he rushed towards Harry who swept him up and spun him around. His hand shook had Harry slipped the ring on his finger.
It was late morning, he had a free period before lunch and decided to spend it roaming the corridors. The sun was shining in through the stain glass windows and each corridor was more enticing than the next. He was lost in thought when, this seemed to be quite a common occurrence for him now, he walked into the Gryffindor he’d been avoiding. He tried to get away as soon as possible but of course, Harry wasn’t going to let that happen. He grabbed his hand and pulled him into a shadowed corridor. “Potter, leave me the fuck alone!” He struggled hopelessly. “No. What the fuck is going on with us, Malfoy?” He wanted to fucking scream. There is no us, Potter. We aren’t lovers- we are enemies. Why won’t you just
Harry’s head turned to look at his heavily pregnant husband, and his eyes lit up. “I just want to make sure everything’s alright” he said as he strode across the room. He kissed Draco lovingly before taking their son off of Draco’s hip, cooing at him and making him laugh.
Harry was mad. Draco could tell by the way he ripped his fingers out from inside of him, and lined his cock up. “You really are a whore, you filthy little bitch. Just letting anyone take you, fine. I’m gonna fucking take you.” With that, he thrust into Draco in one go, causing the bottom to scream out in a mix of pain and pleasure.
He kissed Draco on the cheek before heading up to the podium, applaud roaring in his ears.
Harry awoke with a sigh. He was exhausted. It’d been four days since he’d beaten the shit out of Jacob, and today he had to go and see Narcissa Malfoy, who was back in the country for the trial. It had already been decided that Jacob would be kicked out of the school, but the Department Of Wizarding Abuse had to decide if Jacob would serve prison time. Azkaban was no longer an option, Hermione had taken care of that. She’d kept busy over the summer and had focused on prison reform, which had taken her all of 3 weeks. They now had several smaller muggle like prisons spread out across the country, and the high security prisoners- mainly death eaters- were kept in a ministry military type base. Azkaban was now nothing more than a rune.
“So” Harry repeated.
Suddenly, Draco was lifted up off of the wall and practically thrown over Harry’s desk, landing with a help. “What the-?”
Draco held his breath as Harry lowered his face to his, staring at him intensely. Draco felt himself move forward with Harry as their lips collided, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine. Harry was gentle, but powerful. Draco let out a gasp as Harry tore his lips away, smirking at his lover.

“I love you, Draco”. And he stood up and walked to the floo, grasped a handful of powder and readied himself for the journey. Draco screamed again, this time out of grief. He picked up the framed photo of the two of them and threw it to the floor, smashing the glass into a thousand shards of anguish, as Harry shouted “The Ministry!” And was gone seconds later.
Draco’s head snapped round to the door.
“You, on the other hand,” Harry reached out and grabbed Draco’s jaw, causing the blonde to gasp as they made eye contact. “You are quite clearly a liar. You’ve never had your first kiss, never mind your first shag, and it is obvious you don’t do the fucking.”
Wooooaaah another two chapters ready already?? I’m shocked! I’m trying to get as much written as possible but the editing is the longest part, I know I often make mistakes and my writing is quite chunky, and I apologise that it doesn’t always make sense. There are some broken up words in here which shouldn’t be too hard to understand; I’m just experimenting with what works for me. I hope you enjoy this and I have a day off from studying today so I might even get some more chapters done today! Enjoy <3
Draco couldn’t stop giggling. “Aw, where’s that Gryffindor courage got to now?” He teased, poking his guest in the ribs.
“Right, well I have the file here-“
This is the third work in my Drarry Drabbles Collection. Link to it on
“I have to tell you both something”.
“No, Potter, what are you doing here?” It came out as a whimper as sharp teeth nipped at his neck. He couldn’t help the feeling of bliss that rippled over him in that moment.
When the eyes settled on him however, the man startled back. “Hades!” He shouted before falling off of the back of the sofa. Harry rushed round to the other side and pulled the angel back up into his lap. “I’m sorry for frightening you, my name’s Harry, what, what is yours?” The mans blonde hair had fallen in front of his eyes, and Harry felt the urge to move it out of the way so he could see the grey diamonds again.
Draco felt like shit. It was all his boyfriend’s fault, obviously. Harry has sneezed once near Draco and now he- Draco- was in bed in a comatose state with a fever hotter than merlins left armpit. He groaned again as his head pounded.
First of all, I am SO SORRY it's taken me so long to update this, I wrote this back in October and published it on Tumblr but never got around to adding it on here, thank you for all the support and I hope you all enjoy this!
“That was excellent” Draco sighed as he rolled off of Harry’s chest, both of them panting heavily. “There’s nothing like a good orgasm to get you to sleep”. Draco laughed lazily, nodding his head in agreement.
This chapter is where things start to get more serious. The condition Cardiomyopathy is mentioned, this isn’t meant to offend anyone and I only did about 15 minutes research into it, the symptoms don’t always match up but it’s important to the story line so please bare with me. Past suicide is also mentioned and will be mentioned again later on, as I think it is important for the salvation of Draco’s character after JK wrecked him. I’m going to try and put another chapter up this weekend- comments are really encouraging, and if you wanted to have a chat/ask any questions you can email me at: unconditionaldrarry@gmail.com <3
“What are you doing in the 8th year dorms, Jacob?” Asked Draco accusingly. He’d realised over the course of the evening that he felt very little for he boy and, was done with using him. “I was looking for you, since we didn’t get to meet yesterday”. Draco ran a fast nervous hand through his hair. “I was in the hospital wing, not that you came to see me.” He said hautily before moving to walk away, but was stopped by a hand on his wrist. “They wouldn’t let me in to see you. Let me make it up to you- if you’ll still go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend I’ll make it worth your while.” Draco turned on his heel in an instant.
“I really want to have sex with you right now.” Harry grinned, raising his own eyebrow in what Draco could only conclude was Harry’s attempt at looking sexy. “Ugh, you’re getting a vasectomy. That’s final. I refuse to have the children of a man that would wake me up for something so mundane.” Harry scrambled up to pull a fleeing Draco back into his arms, kissing at his neck.
The guests started to disperse, waving at the young men before they left, many very excitedly. Draco didn’t know what to do. Harry was stood looking at him, smiling. “Draco, I know this is a bit fast but-“
They headed up to Harry’s dorm and he pointed at a chair for Draco to sit down. Draco fidgeted nervously as Harry rummaged round for his eyeliner pot.
Draco didn’t respond.
Draco frowned at her, looking back between Pansy and Blaise.
Harry nodded in turn. “Okay” he said contently, kissing his future fiancé once more.
“I love you so much.” He said, kissing Draco passionately.
Draco bit his lip to try and stop another moan escaping his as he felt Harry on his neck. He could feel Harry’s hands moving down his back, touching every inch of him his fingertips could reach.
“Thank you, Harry.” The other man was visibly shocked but didn’t say anything about the use of his name.
Draco’s mood did nothing but improve over the day as he continued to notice the glares his ex lover was shooting him.
Draco narrowed his eyes at the other boy. “Get up, you’re coming with me.” He grabbed Harry by his t-shirt and lifted him to his feet.
“Draco?” Called out an unfamiliar voice, it was definitely the voice of a man. Harry’s face fell. “Draco who is it? Are you coming back to bed?” Harry saw the silhouette of a man at the top of the stairs. “Yes, Glen, I’m coming.” He turned back to Harry, sadness in his eyes. “Harry, it’s too late. I wasn’t going to just wait around for you. I deserve to be happy too, you know?” He closed the door, shattering Harry’s heart as it slammed closed.
A mixture of relief and embarrassment coated the drunk, and a blush fuelled by both alcohol and humiliation spread across his face.
No smut, only fluff :)
“Draco! Guess what I’ve done?” Pansy approached him, black bob swinging and lipstick shining. He turned to her with interest. “What, Darling? Do tell me”. Her face burst into a grin. “We’ve got permission to have a party next Friday night, and to use the room of requirement to host it- so we’re gonna turn it into a club! So be prepared!” She kissed him on the cheek before bounding forward to the common room to let the other 8th years know.
He felt like he was high when they finished, he pulled the angel onto his chest and wrapped his arms around him before pulling the covers up over their waists. He was drifting off into sleep when he heard Drakon mumble something.
Next to greet them was Dean, looking incredibly handsome in his old age. His hair was now in long, thick dreadlocks that made him look powerful, and his vibrant red suit gave him the appearance of youth. Harry definitely thought Dean had aged the best out of all of us.
he was. He knew that night he’d dream of nothing but his blonde, then he’d have to tell his Draco what he had done.
She raised her eyebrow. “I suppose I do owe you a life debt”.
When he arrived at the hospital wing he was greeted only by a shrieking Pansy who had to be held back by Nott and Zambini from ripping Harry apart. “What did you do to him?! He meets up with you and now he’s
“I was wondering if you’d like to go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend? There’s a French restaurant just opened that I thought you might like to try” Draco let his smile travel up to his eyes which caused a satisfying blush to spread over the other boy’s face. Draco knew if he looked over to the Gryffindor table he’d be met with rage filled green, but he had to act as though Potter was nothing to him.
just fine”.
She shook her head in confusion.
Harry strolled back towards his own dorm while keeping his eyes trained on the Slytherins he was fast approaching. He could feel them openly staring at him and met Draco’s eyes, which proceeded to narrow.
“Eyeliner. Show me what you did to get it that sharp.”
“I don’t want too” he said sticking his bottom lip out at their son. He lifted James up to lay in his chest as he hugged his son tightly, kissing his messy hair. “You’re gonna be good for me right? While daddies are away?” His son nodded up at him, before smiling and waving at Draco who waved back.
“If you go now, Harry, I will not be here if you get back”. The voice was harsh, but disheveled. Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“i think you’ll find it was me that got into you” Draco gasped before he burst out laughing. “We should probably clean up, get dressed and that. Since, we’re meant to be working and all.” Harry considered this, looking around at their surroundings. There was a scrupulous smell of sex in the air, and semen in more places than it should be, honestly, he felt sorry for the man who was unfortunate enough to walk in on them.
“You’re right, I went to see him, just now, I had some stuff left at his and we had another fight.”
“I have loved every day of the past 46 years of having you as my own, Draco, you have made my life incredible and are the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I love you to no end and would spend 5 decades with you over, and over again. I love you”.
“Sit still. I can’t do this if you’re moving”. Draco nodded shakily and stilled himself. He let out a small gasp as Harry cupped his jaw, he was staring so intently at the blond, his eyes filled with concentration. “You don’t really need much eyeliner you know”. He whispered. Draco frowned. “What do you mean?” Hardy paused. “Your eyes are, stunning all by themselves”. He whispered even more quietly.
Montgomery was outside of his chambers when he arrived, a look of misery on his face.
“Well, we’re not having children”. Pansy said pointedly. Hermione nodded in agreement. “We’re far too happy with each other to ruin it with children, but we’ll happily babysit yours!” Hermione giggled as their friends shook their heads at them. “Honestly, what bad influences you’ll be!” Draco joked.
(It’s unfair that you get all the good ones!)
“Are you being serious? How do you know?” He snapped at her, his voice begging for more information.
Draco sat up too. “Yes, but, you can’t just give me a job”
Draco’s heart raced at the sound of heavy footfall that could only belong to Potter. He’d been waiting a good 10 minutes, hastily practicing what he was going to say to the Gryffindor, but now as he looked into the emerald eyes that were heading towards him he couldn’t remember a single word.
with thoughts of the blonde. “I know we haven’t spoken much recently, and you were under a lot of pressure back then,” is she going to give him a way out? Gods he hoped so. “-But I’d really like to try and make us work, Harry”. he sighed. He wanted nothing less, if he was honest with himself. But it was the expectation of the whole wizarding world, and those who he cared about. He nodded quickly, and Ginny kissed him lightly on the cheek before she skipped back into the living room.
“Well he does. You need to go to Ginny and then go back to him again and tell him you’ve finished with her, and that you can be together again”.
“Why are you crying?” Asked the red head cautiously. It wasn’t often that you walked in on your ex enemy crying his eyes out in your front room.
thinking about Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt Harry spell him clean, and then two lubed up fingers breached him. “Mm Harrrrry, just fuck me already!” He begged. The menacing man finally lined up with Draco’s hole, and pushed right into his prostate. He set a brutal pace that released moans from both of them.
“Today’s issue of the Daily Prophet is a special one, and finally answers some of the questions we’ve all been dying to ask. I, Barnabas Cuffe have had the pleasure of being able to interview Mr Potter on his recent engagement and sudden split up”.
The new minister for magic- Malcom Creevey- made the classic ‘welcome to the celebration’ speech that they had every year, adding a few details about the eccentric venue too.
“Feels better when you do it” he moaned, gasping as Harry grazed his prostate. “Obviously”. Harry growled.
Draco rolled out of bed just before 10, and stalked over to his wardrobe to decide what to wear.
“Something’s not right”. Panted Harry as he picked up the pace towards the dorms. “Your cousin is up to something, I can feel it”. Blaise looked concerned. “Potter,” he stopped Harry with his arms. “What’s going on with you and Draco? Why do you suddenly
Kissing Harry after so long apart felt magical, he wrapped his fingers in those chaotic curls and pulled him in for a heart wrenching kiss. He felt one of Harry’s arms wrap around his waist, the other snaked around his neck. Harry tugged at his lip, asking for entrance to which Draco obliged. He could never deny Harry anything.
He made his way over to the box and lifted it into his arms, now just standing there looking at him.
“I hate you, passionately.” Spat Draco as Harry moved his head down in between his legs. “Darling you won’t be saying that in a little while”. And with that, Harry lifted Draco’s legs over his shoulders and buried his face in Draco’s ass.
“I think you’re forgetting who you belong to, Malfoy” said a husky voice near his year. He moaned into his captor as he felt a strong leg push between his own.
“The stable is in shambles, but nothing we can’t fix”. Harry nodded in relief. “Ah look, if it isn’t my favourite girl!” Harry chortled as Hermione made his way over to them. “Yes, well we had a new arrival this morning, Harry. I think you should go and say hello.” Harry was skeptical about the twinkle in her eyes. “Where, in the stable?” She shook her head. “No, in the water gardens”.
look at himself. He’d evened our quite well over the last year and grown a good 6 inches. He was no longer so scrawny, but now had broad shoulders and muscles had formed up and down his limbs. He’d put in some extra work and now had a quite good six pack.
Draco had no clue where he was when he woke up. It didn’t smell like his room, he was wearing a very oversized T-shirt with apparently nothing underneath, but the bed he was in was comfortable, so it was very hard to leave.
It wasn’t even fucking night time. 4 in the afternoon and no one tried to intervene, even when the man started screaming. They kicked at him over and over again, every time he got up they knocked him down. No one did anything, except Harry who raced downstairs and onto the street, disturbing the attackers who finally left a very broken looking Draco in their wake.
“So why did the two of you split up? And why did you propose to your former girlfriend, Ginny?”
“Shut up” Harry smiled, seemingly more sobered up.
“What are you doing?” He asked quietly from the doorway.
Draco stood up and faced him.
to touch. Mine to
“Your highness I strongly advise-“ tried Montgomery.
Draco didn’t fall into the kiss, but he wrapped his hand around Harry neck, as they stayed pressed against each other. Draco’s eyes were scrunched shut, with tears streaming down his face. It took all the power he had to push Harry away from him.
“It’s alright, don’t worry. You’re welcome to it and you’re welcome to stay, as long as you need Malfoy.” He smiled at him again and it sent tingles down Draco’s spine.
Draco must admit he was taken aback. His eyes went wide, and he was rigid against the sofa, but when he had processed what he’d just heard his face broke into a humorous confusion.
“You’ve been drinking tonight, haven’t you?” He asked with a look of distaste.
“His person?” Draco looked at him in desperate confusion. Ron nodded.
His friend looked at him with concern but he just darted off towards the toilets, where he raced into a cubicle and tried to compose himself.
The pair rushed to take their clothes off, both of them riled up from waiting. It had been a hectic month, and they finally had some time alone together as Narcissa was looking after their children.
Sex with Blaise was better than he’d imagined, though it still didn’t compare to Harry. But that didn’t matter right now as he was riding the darker boy, who was obviously in heaven right now. “Fuck, Draco. You don’t know how long I’ve been dreaming about this”. He smiled down at Blaise and rocked his hips. “You’re not a bad fuck, yourself, Darling. I’m sorry I made you wait so long.” He could feel Blaise was going to come. “Fuck Draco, I’ve got you now.” They both picked up the pace, rutting against eachother until, they both came- Blaise with a rather satisfying moan. Draco pulled himself off of Blaise and headed to the bathroom to shower. Blaise turned to him. “What made you change your mind?” Draco smiled. “I told you one day I’d let you fuck me. Besides, I thought it would be rude of me not to, since tomorrow I’m going to get with your cousin.” With that, he closed the door and ran the water for the shower, leaving an exasperated Blaise in a huff.
Based off of a writing prompt ask in which Harry helps Draco- in more ways than one. Contains shmut ;)
“Honestly, Harry! This is so much stuff! We’ll only be in the hospital for a maximum of four days!” Draco said with an exasperated laugh.
“Oh! Sorry Malfoy, I didn’t see you there” He blinked back in suprise and have her a curt smile. “It’s alright, Weasley, it’s no worry.” She smiled back at him and confinued on her way.
But is it better to be in love and in fear, or miserable but in safety? Maybe neither, probably both.
Draco turned to face the other man once more, his emotions bubbling in his throat. Harry’s eyes were stony, but his face was far too expressive. “You really wanted me to stay after a one night stand? You expect me to believe I meant anything more than that to you, and not just another notch on the famous Harry Potter’s bed post?” His words were filled with venom.
“I wish that everyone could be here tonight, those who we lost in The Battle and those who we have lost since; Seamus, Neville and Ginny will forever be in our hearts,”
She looked up at him expectingly, challenging him to push her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That one”. Said Harry with a grin. “I want him, send him up to my chambers immediately.” Draco had a shocked look and yelled out in outrage as he was led away to Harry’s chambers.
Draco Malfoy loves dancing. Not the classical, ballroom dancing he’d been raised on- no, he loved the dirty, grinding up on a stranger type of dancing.
“Is that really what you think of me?” Harry asked with an exasperated expression. “It was never just a one night stand to me. You’re never a one time anything to me, Malfoy, You really think I would have let you into my home, into my bed if it was just a one night fucking stand? I could’ve done that in any club loo in London. But I didn’t, because it was with you. I’d wanted you for so long, and when I finally got you, you just fucking left without any explanation. And then you avoided me, like a coward.”
“Ginny?”  Harry called out as he entered her flat. They didn’t live together, not yet, anyway.
I know we all see Draco as the one wearing makeup, red lipstick and eyeliner etc, but imagine harry in 8th year with painted nails and sharp eyeliner that just makes the emerald sparkle against the black.
No spoilers, but check the Collection Tags for smut warnings
“I’ve got to at least end it with Ginny, haven’t I?” They both nodded at him.
“It’s alright, James, completely not your fault. Mr Potter here and I had just agreed on a final plan, tell Harrison I’ll have the file on his desk tomorrow” The other man nodded furiously before scurrying out of the room.
It seemed like hed been dodging people all day. He could hear the school whispering about him,a few people in his year tried to approach him at lunch, but he darted out of the great hall before they could properly accost him. He just wanted to talk to Draco. Instead, he walked right into his girlfriend. “Harry, I want to talk to you.” Her eyes were a mixture of concern and fear, but he couldn’t face her right now. “I’m sorry, Gin. But not now. It’s not a good time” He scurried into the 8th year common room and up the stairs into his room, so no one else could bother him. He was meant to go and see Professor McGonagall, but he was in a constant state of panic and talking to people made him feel exposed and vulnerable. At least 3 people knew about he and Draco. He was well and truly fucked.
Draco and Harry had only been dating for about 6 months, but Draco knew he was falling in love with the other man, he could feel it. That was why he was screaming at him now in Harry’s flat, as the taller man screamed back with even more frustration.
The blonde courtier snapped a laugh at this remark.
“Hey, didn’t expect you over tonight” she smiled at him as he came into the room.
“Malfoy! Look what you’ve done to my coffee!” She screeched. Trawley just shook his head and Draco found himself holding back tears for the second time that day. Without saying anything he just got up from his desk, wincing at the scolding feeling in his thigh, and left his office. He could hear people calling his name but he didn’t care.
Draco hadn’t even noticed Ginny Weasley until she was about 4 inches away from him. He’d just come out of Blaise’s apartment and was waking down the avenue when she’d caught him.
He came up for hair with flushed cheeks and messed hair, licking the droplet of white off of his own finger with a smile.
𝘍𝘢𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳.”
Ron nodded his head. Harry was engaged to his sister, he’d had no idea how Ron would react.
Furious. Complete fury had wrapped itself around Draco as he’d stormed away from Jacob- who the hell did he think he was? He stormed into his dorm to find a rather startled Blaise watching him. “Are you okay, Dray?” He didn’t answer his friends question but instead reached for the letter in his desk and the bottle of fire whisky he kept in his dresser. He slammed out of the room without another word and made his way to the tallest tower.
“That’s hardly appropriate, Potter. Can we please just-“ Draco heard the whine in his voice.
It took the other man less than a second of hesitation before he nodded frantically, pushing up into Harry’s hand. “Tell it to me in words, gorgeous” Harry chuckled as Draco struggled to keep his composure.
The first man stepped forward. He was shorter than Harry, dirty blond hair and a screwed up nose that made his rather attractive face seem ghoulishly ugly. He bowed before he spoke.
“I want to be there too, you and Blaise will have such beautiful children I’m sure of it”. Said Narcissa. Hermione and Pansy were both cooing over Draco’s belly, willing the child to come out.
Harry is not dealing with his feelings well, and his world is falling apart.
Draco groaned as his side was shook over and over.
“Please, Draco-“
“Hey.” she said softly. He smiled at her. “Hey.”
Harry got up from his seat, the tension in the air was electrifying and he could feel the entire 8th year common room watching them.
His second finger slipped in quite easily and he started scissoring Draco, flicking his prostate as he went. “Hurry up you arse, I want you
As soon as Draco heard the shower start running he opened his eyes. His mind was far too busy to fall asleep. He knew that he could gather up his clothes and run up to his dorm before Harry had finished his shower, but he also knew he’d never do it. It was like a spell had been cast over him, pulling him closer to Harry. He couldn’t leave even if he wanted to.
“You’d be willing to have my kids?” Harry asked hesitantly. Draco looked at him solemnly. “Yes Harry, of course I would. I’d be willing to do anything for you”. Harry smiled at his boyfriend as Draco rested his hand on the side of Harry’s face.
Harry smiled curtly and nodded. “Three should do”.
Harry narrowed his eyes at the blonde, both of them still fully naked. It was surreal that they were having this conversation when Draco could literally feel cum oozing out of his arsehole.
Draco didn’t know what to do. He threw another book at Harry from across the living room. “That’s not fair, Harry! You told me it’d be another year, at least, until you had to back, not a fucking MONTH!”.
“Well then, time to get personal”.
Finally Harry realised that Draco was about to run into a dead end, and if Harry caught up in time he’d be able to corner him.
“SURPRISE!” Came shouts when he turned on the light. All of his friends were there, along with his mother, and Harry was at the front of everyone with his arms wide and a huge grin.
“Yes, shut up and kiss me, Potter.” The dark haired boy frowned before Draco pulled them back together and pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“You taste amazing, Malfoy. Loved eating you. Marking you up, do you miss how it felt?” Draco finally looked up at the other man, determined not to fold.
” She wrapped her arms around his neck as Madame Pomfrey tutted, but left them to it. Ron was next to grasp him in a bear hug, filled with the love he’d felt so many times from Molly. “Mate, you were terrifying back there.” He said with concern. Harry looked away. “It comes over me sometimes. I just couldn’t stop.” His friends looked at him sympathetically and patted his shoulders as Pansy pulled back his curtain.
He ran forward but Draco held a hand out to stop him and he froze in place.
“Bloody hell you two, do we need to buy you matching watches while we’re down there? You’re nearly 10 minutes late!” Ron said upon their arrival, but with a cheeky grin on his face. “Oh do shut up Ronald” said his sister as she greeted him. “Hermione you look simply stunning! We will have to go clothes shopping while we’re out!” Both girls let out excited squeals while their boyfriends just groaned. “Oh do be quiet you too!” Said hermione as she linked arms with Ginny. “Are we about ready to go?” Just as Harry was about to reply he felt a hand tap him on the shoulder. “Excuse me, Potter, but you’re in the same dorms as Draco aren’t you?” He turned and nodded to Jacob. “Yeah, why?” The Ravenclaw sighed. “We’re meant to be meeting for lunch but he hasn’t turned up, just wondered if you’d seen him.” “No, sorry I-“ just then he was interrupted by the sight of the blond behind Jacob, their eyes locked and his mouth watered. “Jacob Darling I am sorry I’m late” the Ravenclaws pupils blew at the sight of his date, as he looked good enough to eat. “It’s alright baby, you’re worth it” He said with hunger in his eyes as Draco kisses his cheek. “Shall we?” And they made their way down to Hogsmeade.
“Gods, please Harry, please!” He didn’t even know what he was begging for as he rocked his hips, meeting Harry’s thrusts as he slammed up into him.
Draco let out and exasperated noise. “There’s no way you could’ve just known-“
He walked away from the Gryffindoor with pain in his heart.
Harry turned towards the table where his husband was beaming up at him.
About 5 minutes later there was a gentle hum of noise in the room as the 8th years read up on some magical battle they were meant to care about. A note came sailing over and landed on the middle of Draco’s page. He paused before pretending to only just noticed the note and made sure he didn’t look interested as he read it.
The third man stepped forward. He looked nervous, and was rather smaller than the others but one key feature was a scar that ran down the side of his face.
Harry nipped his rim as the words tumbled out of his mouth. He was so turned on his cock was fully hard again. He could feel that Draco was close to cumming. He retracted his mouth from Draco’s entrance with a pop, and moved up to his face. “You belong to
Draco smirked and shook his head. “I’m serious, Potter. You’re still convinced you’re
“Thank you for being here today, you will each be rewarded with a thousand galleons for your struggles and may stay here with us as long as you like.” The three men bowed and thanked him before he nodded them off and ran up to his chambers.
He fell to his knees, the rage inside of him turning into terror. Harry sunk down beside him, and lifted the Slytherin’s tear strewn face up to his own, pained face.
He ran his hands down his chest to smooth out the jumper, wondering what Potter would be doing with Her today. He was reasonably sure last night had signified the end of their shenanigans. He added a long overcoat to his outfit and some suede loafers. Yes, he looked gorgeous. It was now quarter to 11 and he was meeting Jacob at 11:30. He had almost an hour to sit about and mope about Potter. Fantastic.
You’re sick Potter!
Ron was uncomfortable, he didn’t really know what to say. But he also didn’t like seeing Draco sad.
My life has not been easy, but every day with him was just carefree and happy. We never argued or got on each others nerves, we just ate muggle food together and watched rubbish muggle television, and he’d lay in my lap and I’d stroke his hair. And we were happy, That’s what I’ve missed the most. I miss his smile and his laughter and the way his eyes would light up when he finished something or got something right.
“Potter! What the fuck are you doing in here?!” Draco’s eyes were filled with schock and anger. “I couldn’t stay away from you, Draco. I need to be in you”. Harry started to move Draco’s legs open but was stopped by a kick in the chest. “Piss off, Potter! You can’t just come in here and decide you’re going to have me!” Harry was gobsmacked. So you’d rather wank over me on your own than have me? Fine! Be alone! I don’t want you anyway!” The Raven haired boy got up with a huff and instantly regretted what he has said when he saw the look on the blonde boys face, so much so it stopped him in his tracks. “Uh, Malfoy I didn’t-“  suddenly the drapes of the Slytherins bed whipped around shut, and Harry took that as his sign to leave. God, why was everything always so difficult between them?!
Harry took his wrists into his hands and held Draco there as he kissed him.
“Harry, Gods please just fuck me!” He moaned into Harry’s hair. It smelt like apples and mint. “As you wish kitten”. He chuckled, but it soon turned into a growl when he reshuffled their position.
“You always were a bit obsessed with him”.
They’d been apart for nearly 4 months now, and Harry still had a box of stuff at Draco’s.
He didn’t know how to answer that.
Draco took the opportunity to try and break away from Harry but the Gryffindor pushed him right back into the wall, causing them to stumble into each other.
“God, Harry please, fuck me” He moaned as they broke apart.
Harry’s tongue dived into Draco’s hole. The rippled skin flexed around his tongue, quivering as he pushed forwards against the resistance. Draco’s moans were downright filthy but his hand in Harry’s curls encouraged him further. “Gods, Harry, please!” He wasn’t even sure what he was asking for.
He woke in the hospital wing, people gathered all around him. “Draco!” He heard Pansy cry and he reached out for her hand. “I’m alright you silly bint, All you seem to do is worry about me” his friends laughed softly. “Only because you give us so many reasons to be worried” chimed in Blaise, Draco smiles at that. “Out, the lot of you. If you’re not careful you’ll cause Mr Malfoy to have another attack, he’s unstable as it is and I need to make sure he’s not in danger”. He heard her try to push his friends away. “D-danger?” Pansy stuttered in a timid voice. She squeezed his hand tightly into her grasp. “But he’s fine, isn’t he?” Madame Pomfrey gave no reply. He heard her escorting his friends out and sighed.
The Gryffindor strode into the room, shirt untucked and tie askew, and walked right up to the Slytherins.
“I was scared, really, a coward. The man I love wanted me to admit my love for him, instead of hiding him, and like an idiot instead of listening to his feelings I completely disregarded them for my own. So instead of telling people I loved him, I just hurt him instead.”
He heard whispers from their guests and a few muffled giggles. Everyone had seen Draco’s gruesome ring, a chunky gold band with a horribly shaped diamond in the middle, fat and angular. It made Draco’s elegant fingers look stubby, which he despised. It made him despise his fiancé even more.
And Draco being dumbfounded at the sheer sight of him, following him with his eyes and his mouth open. And Harry just smirking at him, causing Draco’s jaw to snap shut.
“Darling, it is so good to see you!” She said happily, kissing him on the cheek. He smiled at her before pulling her into a corner to chat.
If you want to chat or have any questions, you can email me at: unconditionaldrarry@gmail.com  <3
.” And with that, he left; not caring if Potter watched him go.
“No, Potter.
“You can’t keep turning up at my place and then falling asleep before we actually have sex every time he hurts your feelings” Blaise said almost cattily.
Draco couldn’t help but feel hurt as yet another article was on the front page about Harry Potter’s surprise engagement to Ginny Weasley.
“Harry loves you, you know. I think he’s probably just scared and so he’s trying to get over you by dating someone else. But you’re his person, I can feel it”. He said matter-of-factly.
Harry’s brain had been all over the place that afternoon, it was a mess. Ginny had come to see him today, and they’d arranged to have a “night in” soon. Like a married couple. It was ridiculous. Stress seemed to be the only thing his brain could produce- it scrambled his thoughts which had only been rambling jumbles of words to begin with. God he wished for so many things to be different.
Draco was pacing around their living room frantically, having absolutely no clue what he’d tell Harry when he got home in- oh god, 20 minutes.
“The Saviour deserves better than you, death eater scum!”
clause in our agreement you’ll be lucky if I ever speak a word to you again. Now get out. I don’t want you here”.
Draco still wasn’t used to not waking up next to Harry, he still had Harry’s coffee mug in his kitchen cupboard.
They finally got to the common room and Harry raced towards the staircase, but the whiskey was taking its toll and he had to slow down. “Potter, are you
Draco made his way over to the Slytherin table where he was met with questioning looks from his friends. He wanted to speak  in French to Pansy but he knew Theodore would understand enough to tell Blaise, who, although cane from an Italian family and spoke decent enough Italian, was completely hopeless at making connections between the two languages. “L'AS-tu fait?” She asked. He nodded. “Nous parlerons plus tard”. She nodded in return.
They all made their way over to their seats as the first speech began.
, and I want someone who isn’t afraid to be with me”.
know why you reacted the way you did.
“Well now I feel like an idiot” he mumbled.
The bossy bottom took charge by straddling Harry properly and grinding their groins together, eliciting beautiful groans from Harry. By this point both men had recharged libidos, panting into their kiss, foreheads pressed together. harry’s grip on his lovers waist was so tight it was almost painful as Draco rolled his hips against Harry’s thick cock.
He could feel his heart pumping, his breaths irregular. Sex with Harry was always electric, it felt amazing when their bodies connected. He felt sorry for any of his future lovers because no one could be as skilled as his 18 year old tormenter.
“Harry, although what Mr Zambini did was
Harry had just stepped through his front door and was thinking about what curry to order in for dinner when he noticed that his living room light was turned on, and he knew he hadn’t left it like that.
Harry sprung up from his bed and yanked Draco up by his waist, and manhandled him back on to the bed. “We don’t talk about him. You stay in my bed until I am done with you, and since you haven’t come I am not, done, with, you” He timed his last words with his tugs at Draco’s half buttoned shirt.
” He closed his eyes and rested against the wall in defeat. “I know you don’t believe that. That’s why you’re not with that git of a Ravenclaw”. Harry replies cockily. Draco shoved him hard. “If you really gave a fuck, you’d leave your lover, and we’d be with one another. But we both know you’ll
“Hello, I’m Draco.” Said the man, with a shy smile. Harry grinned. “Hello, Draco, I’m Harry”. He held his hand out for the other to shake, and they shared a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
When the broke away from each other, arms wrapped around their wastes, they turned sheepishly to their audience, but grinning non the less.
“Take me, Hades”. Harry pulled Drakon into him. “My name is Harry” he whispered.
Blaise snorted.
Harry shook his head. “That’s not enough, he doesn’t want to be kept as a secret”.
“Thank you, Malcom. And what an honour it is to be here- again!” The audience chuckled. “For 50 years, we have lived in peace and unity, strengthening the powers of our magic and our longevity. And for 50 years, Voldemort’s wrath has been over”.
Harry attacked Draco’s neck, and sighed happily into his chest. “I’ve missed this so much, missed you, baby”. Draco whined at his words.
“Draco please, stop running away from me!” He howled as the blonde continued to race off towards the east wing of the school. It was late, maybe 5pm so there weren’t many people around but those who were out in the corridors stared at both boys as they went past.
“If matters to me!” Draco yelled, trying to get out of Harry’s grasp.
This chapter is dedicated to FanFic_Addict1993, who’s comment made me feel so connected to them. I think I’m going to start dedicating each chapter to someone. Hope you enjoy this chapter, it’s a little longer (just over 2k) and it is Harry’s point of view (Hence, Harry’s Chapter). The next chapter will be from Draco’s point of view over the same day, and they will both bleed into the start of the chapter after that.
Harry groaned at the sensation and his hands immediately began to roam up under Draco’s silk shirt, before drifting back down to squeeze and kneed his sizeable rear.
He tried to sort out his breathing, but the feeling of rejection from Harry was far too much to deal with and none of his friends or family were acknowledging him either and it was all so much that he couldn’t help but let out a sob.
“You like that?” Asked Harry with a smirk. Draco could only nod, all of his courage suddenly leaving him stranded. They sat there, grinding down on each other, moaning and panting.
Harry nodded. “Thank you, Monty. I’m going to completely discard all of your advice so we should probably change your title!”
He couldn’t cope with these feelings. They reminded him of sixth year, and he’d promised to never let himself get that bad again. He’d decided he was just going to go home, pray Harry wasn’t there and pack his bag. He’d go to Paris somewhere and just get away from the feeling of being overwhelmed, and come back when, we’ll he didn’t know when. It didn’t seem as though anyone would care if he left.
The final chapter
The room was dark, but Harry could make out the shape of Draco, nearly unconscious, being preyed on by the Ravenclaw. With another roar he dived at Jacob, tackling him of the bed before smashing his fist into the other boy’s face, knocking him out
“Malfoy, fancy seeing you here” The man growled. Draco shook his head.
a weakening charm from Hermione to get him off the boy, and then he’d caused a scene in Professor McGonagall’s office.
Twenty minutes later they were in the labour room, Draco’s contractions having now sped up to once every 7 minutes. A restless Harry was pacing back and fourth in front of the bed, waiting for their doctors to come to them.
That night was the best nights sleep either of them had had in three years.
“Ah, Harry! Did the storm get you badly?” His red haired friend greeted him. “No, thankfully it wasn’t too bad, you?” His friend shook his head.
sorry”. He fingered the Gryffindor’s hair as fucked into him.
“Right, he should be okay if you leave him to rest a while, but he will need to change out of those wet clothes” Harry looked at her blankly, not getting what she meant. “You have to change him out of his clothes, Harry”. Oh.
He hurriedly got out of the bed and pulled on a T-shirt.
“𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘪𝘴,
“Come in!” A sharp voice shouted out to him, and he turned the door handle and strode forward into the room.
It was strange, waking up in Harry’s bed. Even though It’d only been a few years. Draco hadn’t moved that far away- about 90 minutes of you’re driving. He knew Harry had been looking for him, he’d hounded Pansy and his other friends for Draco’s location, but he never thought the Gryffindor would actually find him.
Harry tried to be as quiet as he could, bringing them back in. It was nearly midnight when he got them back so there were still a few people in the common room, and they all stared at Harry as he entered. “Uh, he’s very drunk, so I’m just taking him up to bed” He whispered at the onlookers. They all seemed to accept this and resume whatever they had been doing.
He took the stairs slowly, and noticed Potter’s door was open as he reached the second floor. Draco didn’t really mean to poke his head into the dorm, but he had. Now he was pressed against the door on the closed side and knew he should’ve just gone to bed.
“The last 50 years haven’t always been easy, my coming out breaking the hearts of witches all over the world, the hate me and my now husband, Draco, received for daring to love one another. But now, we are getting to live our happy ending.”
Draco didn’t know what made him do it. Maybe it was the smile on the other boy’s face. Maybe it was how enchanting the green eyes were. But he did it. He lunged forward and kissed him. His hands cupped the other boys face which, for a moment morphed into shock, but then obvious enjoyment. Harry’s arms wrapped around him and the kiss intensified.
When Harry woke up the next morning he was pleased to find Draco was still cuddled next to him. He was surprised to see that the blonde was already awake, slowly tracing his fingers along Harry’s chest. “Good morning” Harry said croakily.
“We can talk more about it in the morning, if you promise to stay with me now?” He tried to stop the fear invading his voice. Draco didn’t say anything, only nodded.
9 tonight. Your room. No fucking about, just fucking.
The First drabble is on the next chapter!
Finally, he too was naked and Harry joined him on the bed. He slid in between Draco’s legs and started to grind down on him, before grasping Draco’s hands firmly and moving his arms above his head.
” He span around the face Harry clutching his neck. “You gave me a hickey!” He yelled, his anger increased by the boy’s cruel chuckle. “Now he’ll know who owns you” He spat with malice, before stalking from the room. Draco was so utterly fucked.
. In fact, his head was practically
He noticed a mug he’d bought for Harry in the top of one of the boxes he was holding. On the side of it it read “worlds best kisser”, a joke between the two of them. Draco had a matching one still in the cupboard.
Pansy joked as the two joined Draco’s fellow Slytherins. “Tout est juste dans l'amour et la guerre”
When night came Draco had no clue where he was meant to sleep, he couldn’t well climb back into Harry’s bed, as much as he wanted to. He couldn’t stifle his next yawn which meant that Harry noticed his clearly tired expression. “Come on, Malfoy, you need to get to bed. I had the sheets changed so it should be more comfortable.”
“So did I, but I guess not”. He sighed, deflating on himself.
, Potter. He’s petrified. He can’t trust Blaise, he screamed and kicked out at him when he was trying to help. Salazar better give me
“The reason I proposed to Ginny was out of convenience more than anything. We’d stopped dating when we were 17, but we’d always been expected to get married after the war anyway. She’d just come back from her European Tour and had also gone through a breakup, so we agreed it could work for both of us”.
“I told you it was a bad idea, Potter!” Said a furious Pansy. “Everyone out, go to the venue and get the party started”. A second later and there were twenty or so pops of apparation and it was just the two of them.
“Never. Ever ever, Draco. I wouldn’t do that to you. Couldn’t. Come here you idiot.” Draco awkwardly rushed towards Harry, knocking them both into the chair opposite Harry’s desk. They kissed passionately, elegant hands rested against a thick beard, whilst calloused fingers ran through silky hair. A slight tug on Draco’s hair caused him to release a moan, and for a grin to infect Harry’s face.
To make matters worse his boss, Tawley, (who is a complete twat!) told him he’d be staying for an extra half hour after work because he had to finish a report that wasn’t due for three bloody weeks! But Draco loved his job as a social worker for magic kids, so he agreed with a curt nod.
Draco felt like a dickhead, but when he woke up in strange men’s beds it usually meant he’d been fucked. But obviously he wouldn’t be to Potter’s tase, the man was straight for heavens sake. Still, one could but dream.
“I only let guys with sm-All aNd W-ee-uh-ak dick fuck me” he giggled. Harry slapped his already red buttocks and earned a yelp. Harry leaned in to Draco and spoke huskily into his ear “Don’t act like you don’t
Draco made a yelling sound deep in his throat before he picked up the ornamental statue from his coffee table before hurling it to the ground, watching it smash.
Harry finally broke away from Draco, panting. “Come on, up. You’re going in the shower because you’re sweaty and your breath stinks, and these sheets need changing”. Draco gasped in fake outrage. “The cheek! Carry me to the bathroom, now”. He pushed at Harry’s arms and Hardy scooped him up and took him into the bathroom. Draco took off Harry’s oversized T-shirt that he’d stolen, and earned himself a slap on the arse as he jumped into the shower with a yelp.
“Mum! I’m so happy you made it on time!” Elated Harry as he pulled her in for a hug. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world, precious. And how is my Draco?” She asked as she headed towards the bed.
“Potter, since my room is free tonight you could always stay with me, I’m sure I could give you some much
Long one boys. Some non Drarry smut so be warned! There’s also the f slur used. This chapter is 3.6k long so enjoy!
“Not here” he chuckled in reply, and that was the only warning Draco got before he felt the familiar tug behind his navel and he was spun into an all too familiar bedroom.
Twenty minutes later Blaise arrived back from dinner. “Blaise, Darling, what are you doing tonight?” He turned to look at Draco while rummaging through his wardrobe. “A Gryffindor. She’s bloody wonderful Draco I tell you, you ought to try women out some time.” He laughed at his own joke but Draco just pouted. “Have fun, though tonight was going to be the night I let you do me, instead”. Blaise stood still, his brow furrowing. Draco lay back and threw open the dressing gown to reveal himself, and Blaises jaw dropped. “Change of plans”.
“What about?” Hermione asked.
When the car pulled up there were photographers at them from every angle, shouting out at them. Justin linked their arms tightly and whispered in Draco ear,
. Utter outrage was all that Harry could feel throughout the day. They’d only ended their little arrangement this morning and Draco had already moved on? It was unacceptable. To top it off, Draco had been ignoring the looks Harry had been giving him
“Bastard! Fucking bastard!” He yelled, scratching at Harry’s back, making sure to leave stinging marks.
He managed to slip out of Harry’s firm grasp without waking him, and crept around the room picking up his clothes as he went into the living room to dress, in the hopes of not waking Harry up.
“Your highness,” he paused to bow. His voice sounded like silk and something mischievous. “I am Blaise Zambini, son of Dutchess Zambini from the Southern Province. I admit I have been touched by a man, but I am no whorehouse and willingly offer myself as a wife to you”.
Hermione giggled a little bit.
“I’m gay. I’m sorry. I should never have gotten back with you, I only did it because I was scared”.
His smile died along with the flames as Draco left Grimmauld Place. Letting Draco leave wasn’t something he’d wanted to do, but they both had to get back to their lives. He ran upstairs to shower and change before heading to The Burrow. The shower stung his back and he hissed, he could feel every mark Draco had scratched into him as he shook his head while he massaged shampoo into his scalp.
He turned back to the living and cleared his throat, catching the attention of their guests, neither of whom who had moved.
Draco’s in the hospital wing, Harry is frantic. Is there more to it than what meets the eye?
Harry was taken aback, Draco was almost frightening when he was angry. When they’d split up he just seemed to deflate.
“So what do you want?”.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh my god! You guys! You didn’t have to come!” Exclaimed Draco, happy to see their friends.
“Don’t you dare fucking tell me how I feel when you’re too much of a pussy to admit your own feelings. Now get the fuck out!”
. And Draco. And I assumed you and he had been a one night stand or something- I atleast expected you to have ended it before you got together with Ginny. But no. It wasn’t just the other night that confirmed it, either. It just confirmed to me that you and he were still going on”. Harry was shaking. He let out a long breath before turning back to his friend. “Hang on, what do you mean it only ‘confirmed we were still going on’?”. Hermione’s eyes widened and some of the confidence left her face. “Draco may have told Pansy. He was stressed out of his mind and had no one else to turn to about his feelings, least of all you, Harry.”
Gwain laughed as he skipped of towards the door.
“What the hell’s that all about?” Asked Pansy, his other Slytherin fellows looked at him with interest. “Not a bloody clue, the git. It’s a good thing I don’t have plans this morning.” With that his friends refocused on themselves and thought little more about it.
Written whilst listening to
Harry shook his head. “We both know that’s not true. We both know you’ve spent these last two years thinking about it everyday.”
Draco was storming away from Jacob who was now clutching at a reddening cheek- and yelling at Draco in rapid French, and it didn’t sound pleasant. Harry watched the Slytherin storm off up to the rooms. “We’d better get out of the way, I’ll see you tomorrow at breakfast” She kissed him on the cheek and left to go to her dorm. Harry had made them leave right after Draco and Him, and he was glad they did. Harry’s jealousy at seeing what he considered to be his out with another man combined with Draco’s tantrum almost guaranteed Harry would be having sex tonight.
(Flashback to 3 years ago)
Based off of a prompt list ask where Harry saves the day, no smut
“Why the hell would you leave that thing out?! What if we had never found him!” Draco shouted, red in the face. Harry’s face solidified and he spelled the cloak into their bedroom, and placed James down into his cot.
The other boy let out a sad kind of laugh. “You didn’t do anything, Potter, you couldn’t do anything wrong if you tried. But you can’t make this right either”.
Very smutty based off of the prompt "stop being cute" so obviously that meant a lot of sex, inspired by a work that will be linked in the foot note.
Draco burst out laughing, actually throwing his head back it was so funny. In his drunk state, Harry absolutely didn’t find it funny and his anger was renewed.
from time to time.
“Yeah, you’re right, but first,” Harry pulled Draco back in for a kiss, smiling into each others mouths.
something was wrong. He could feel it. Draco had been
“I’ve been searching for the past hour, I swear I only put him down for a second but-“ Harry started to laugh and kissed Draco on the cheek.
That had all been promptly thrown to the wind as Harry had proceeded to drag Draco into his private rooms and fucked him
The library was quiet when the trio settled down at one of the big oak tables. Harry sighed as he finally finished his potions essay. There were at least 10 spelling mistakes and half of it was complete shit, but he didn’t care. Hermione and Ron both looked up at him when he started packing up. “I can’t concentrate on anymore homework, guys, so I’m just going to go to bed” Ron nodded and Hermione looked at him pitifully but nodded anyway. “Before you go Harry, if you see Pansy in the common room could you give her this?” She handed him a book that seemed to be written in a different language. “Why can’t you give it to her?” The girls were now roommates, and surprisingly, friends.
“I know, Draco. I know and I’m sorry. Please, please stay and let me love you?” As the green eyes bored down into his, filled with desperation, Draco knew he’d say yes. Like he said before, he could never refuse Harry.
Harry had no clue what to do. He’d managed to carry Draco up to his flat and was now heaving for his breath, still clinging to Draco’s limp body. He lay the broken blonde down on his bed, panicking as he realised he was still unconscious.
“Please don’t” Draco said desperately, walking towards Harry.
“Looking for you, but found Draco instead”. She smiled, and reached out her hand to him.
A surge of energy sent Harry hurtling forward and he was able to trap Draco into the corner, bracketing him in place with his arms.
(All is fair in love and war)
“So, you are an angel, then?” He stood up too, but made no love towards the blonde.
“Get your stuff and get out” Draco scowled, his words sharp.
“Draco! Draco come back here and talk to me!” Harry shouted as he raced down the corridor after his friend. Their friendship had been fragile from the start, but they’d managed.
“Mr Malfoy, I understand you must be under stress for your NEWTS, but you need to take better care of yourself, you gave me quite a fright.. The last thing in the world I would want is for you to go back to how you were in your 6th year”. Draco nodded. “Believe me, neither do I. Though sometimes I wish I had had the balls to go through with it” she gasped at his words. “Don’t say such things! Recovery is difficult, and it takes a long time, but it is worth it. So do not speak like that, I’ll not have it.” He rolled over to face her and groaned. “Don’t you have anything stronger for this? Poor old Voldy damaged the valves in my heart and then died, I don’t really think it was a fair trade.” Another tut at his words. “I’ll go and see what I can find” with that, she got up curtly and left back to her office.
“Is he at Blaise’s?” He asked bitterly.
Draco beamed up at him, nodding softly. “Of course I am, Harry, I love you.”
And that was probably what hurt the most, after 8 months of domestic living, intimate sex and constant butterflies, Harry didn’t love him back.
Draco gets f u c k e d.
“Finkley!” He yelled, exasperated like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
(See the end of the chapter for
about him so much?” Harry looked away. “We got pretty close over the summer, I just don’t want to see him hurt.” Blaise said nothing, but started moving again.
Harry was stunned. He opened his mouth but nothing came out. Draco tutted and turned away from him.
“Of course I do, Daddy. Only for you”. Draco moaned the words as Harry lifted his legs up to extract the thong.
Harry forced Draco’s legs to spread wide open for him as he continued pummelling his prostate with his fingers. “Please Daddy, fuck me already!” He grabbed out for his lover, trying to pull Harry close.
“See the truth is, Malfoy, you like to act as if you’re all high and mighty, sneering down at everyone, but really all you want is a big juicy cock
He stood naked in the mirrors or admiring himself, he really was rather attractive. He was lean but toned, had a wonderful arse (as he had been told many times)- his only let downs were the scars across his abdomen from his 6th year, and the ugly dark mark on his left forearm. He remembered the times over the week he’d stayed with Harry over the summer that his Gryffindor had kissed that mark, told him he was still beautiful. The tears in his eyes as he’d apologised for causing the scars on his chest, how Draco had told him it was alright, because he was here now...he snapped out of his silly thoughts. “Stop acting like a dopey 14 year old girl for fucks sake.” He scolded himself and opened his wardrobe door. He took out a pair of black gingham trousers and a tight long sleeved black turtle neck. He decided on teasing tight underwear for incase he let himself be seduced that evening.
Harry dropped the box next to the fireplace and stormed over to Draco.
all about?!” Said a dazed Ron. Hermione gave Harry a knowing look, but kept quiet. “I’m gonna go see Draco, guys. I’ll see you back up in the common room?” They nodded and turned to leave.
Harry located Draco as soon as they entered the restaurant, and was met with a cold scowl. He’d spent a fortune on Ginny already- mostly out of pure guilt. Ron and Hermione had left them to go back up to the castle so it was now just the two of them- along with 20 shopping bags. “Are you ready to order?” The waitress asked nervously. She’d obviously realised who it was she was serving and was desperate to please. “We’d like another minute or so, please.” She nodded frantically and scurried away. “Harry, is everything alright?” Asked his girlfriend with concern. He looked at her eyes, their deep brown contrasted so much to the shiny grey that had captured his heart. When did he become this person? This complete dickhead who was hurting two people he loved? He shook his head and turned away. “Just not been sleeping well recently, that’s all” His assurance was weak but it seemed to satisfy her. She chatted on to him about who knows what as he got lost in his own thoughts, sneaking glances at the blonde who was obviously actively avoiding eye contact with him.
Draco's suprise birthday- gone wrong. Smut and detailed depictions of rimming.
“Why the hell am I here?” Spat the blonde. Harry just smiled and walked forward towards the blonde, who’s face quickly morphed into fear as he realised harry had cornered him.
He got up in search of his host, the flat he appeared to be in was huge! Finally he crept into the living room where he saw a very tired looking Harry Potter sprawled across a large leather sofa.
I miss our weekends in bed together, eating breakfast in bed and then reading or just talking or just being together. I miss doing everything with him”.
“Right, James, it’s time to go to bed my love” Draco told their son, who sighed in reply.
“I love you, Harry Potter” Draco reciprocated, his tone low and sultry. He pushed himself onto Harry’s lap, wrapping his arms around his neck and leaning down to kiss him.
Not a minute later he heard his curtains rustle. “Draco?” He heard a soft whipser and shut his eyes tight. “What do you want Potter?” The man shuffled forward and stood over Draco. “I was so scared when Ron told me you were in here. Why the hell didn’t you tell me you had a heart problem? And what did she mean by “how you were in 6th year?” The words rushed out of his mouth, and they set Draco on edge.
But there was no mistaking that platinum blonde hair, that had grown out long on top, no longer straight but slightly curling. He was even thinner than at school! Harry was just trying to make his mind up what to do for the billionth time when two men dressed in full black came up and attacked Malfoy in the street.
Harry made his way over to the fire place and had lent to reach for some floo powder when Draco spoke again.
“I’m not going to be coming back to our dorm tonight”
Draco.
Part 12-
“I’m so sorry Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter. It’s just i was sent up by our head of department to check how negotiations were going since you;d been gone so long, your secretary Mr Potter told me she thought by the sounds of it you might be fighting so i thought it best to just walk in, gosh I’m so-” Draco held up a hand to silence the other man.
“Potter Engagement Finished, Says Ginny Weasley”.
“I’m so happy to be here with you all, celebrating me and my fiancé, Draco’s engagement. Babe, get up here with me”. His grin made Draco feel sick to his stomach, and he tried his best to fix his face before joining the slimy man on stage. Instantly he was looking for Harry’s face, spotting it immediately and causing his breath to hitch.
“Well, if you do that to me every night I think I might be able to manage.” The both chuckled and kissed each other again.
“Don’t you fucking speak to me like that!”
“What is it?”
.” She turned and stormed out of the hospital wing. “What the bloody hell was
“Sweet, we have been together for 46 years, married for 43. You’re everything and more that I could have ever dreamed of, and I love you more than anything, okay?” Draco nodded his head and kissed Harry’s lips intensely, whispering an ‘I love you’ to him.
Prompt: "Sometimes I yearn for Harry in eyeliner and Draco losing his goddamn mind."
Draco could feel himself getting dizzy and told Jacob he was going to go and get a water. He knew he shouldn’t be drinking, but he didn’t care. Madame Pomfrey could kill him in the morning if the vodka didn’t finish the job that night. He stumbled up to the bar and nearly fell right into Harry, who had a scowl plastered to his face, but Draco just rolled his eyes. He asked for a water bottle and felt Harry move towards him as the bartender went to the fridge. “Being a slut won’t get you anywhere, Malfoy”.
The crowd let out a unanimous ‘aww’ and started clapping once more, before Harry turned back towards the stage.
body properly, he was not walking into the crappy little cafe and asking for a job, and he was not being turned out barely two minutes later, empty handed.
.” He spat through gritted teeth. Harry wrestled him still against the wall. “I dare because you
“They’ll just get back together again so I don’t care”.
He rolled his eyes at the Gryffindor and stood up, seeking the attention of his Ravenclaw who, he was pleased to see, was already heading over to him.
Harry sighed and held his face in his hands.
They sat in silence together, both watching the flames for her return. Suddenly. the flames started to his and changed to green, and two bodies stepped through on to the rug in front of the fireplace. It was Hermione, who had seemingly pulled Harry through reluctantly with her.
“It doesn’t matter that I love you, I can’t-“
never done you like that” Draco winked as he licked the cum off of the corner of his mouth, then started to get up off of the bed. “We don’t talk about her. Where do you think you’re going? You haven’t come yet.” Draco turned around just as he pulled his silk shirt over his shoulders. “I didn’t think you cared if I came or not, Potter. Besides, I have to get back to my dorm so I can figure what the hell im going to tell Jacob.” That was all it took.
“How personal is the assistance you need?” He said seductively. He leaned in close and straddled Harry. “Uh, fuck, Draco. As personal as you’d like.” He lowered his head to Harry’s neck and started sucking, causing Harry to groan.
Draco shook his head, pushing his arms into Harry’s chest.
It couldn’t be him. Could it? No, Harry didn’t believe it. But he couldn’t stop looking at the cowering man on the street. The rain was pounding, he must be soaked to his skin, and it was freezing even from inside Harry’s apartment from which he was staring down at the street.
“But of course, it couldn’t, partly because you loved other people but also because, you’re gay, is that correct?”
“Ron!”
“You’re a complete joke, Fletchly”. Came a rich, confident voice from the crowd. Everyone, including the confused couple, turned to the speaker. There he was, Harry Potter, sat with a devilish grin on his lips and dark eyes that challenged a rather unnerved, but pissed off Justin.
“Ohhhhhhh!” Draco moaned as he was pounded into Harry’s bed, face shoved into the pillow with his ass up in the air. Harry was absolutely wrecking him. “God, your arse is the reason I wake up in the morning, how are you so
“Please, I’ve been a complete idiot and he’s not been home in two days, you must know where he is.”
Draco’s hand jumped out and slapped Harry right across the face. His wrists were instantly grasped and he struggled against his captor. “I am not just sex, Potter. I am not just holes for your pleasure.
Harry was bored after about 20 minutes and was dying to go and get some lunch but the girls were nowhere near done.
“Your wing, is it alright?” Was all he could think to say. The left wing was dropping and it was obviously painful to move. “It’s broken, probably. They’ll know I was gone”. He sniffed and turned away from Harry.
“We have to stop this”
“Merveilleux! That would be perfect, how about you swing round to the 8th year common room tonight?” He fluttered his long lashes as he spoke. The other boy light up and agreed he’d be round after his quidditch practice. Oh yes, this was going to be
“I missed you so much, Daddy”. He cried as Harry started lifting his hips upwards.
Draco giggled as he walked into the living room to greet his frantic husband. Harry was still in his pyjamas , hair flying out at all sorts of angles as his eyes dashed around the room frantically making lists of everything he had for their time away.
“Harry come here” Draco whined, making grabbing motions at his husband. “What is it, are you alright?” Harry frowned as he rushed into his husbands arms.
It was around five minutes later when the blonde burst in, rushing towards the Slytherin table. He spoke in a hastened manner to Pansy, maybe he was speaking French? She turned and looked right at Harry before turning back to Draco and nodded. She got up and followed him out of the great hall. He looked terrible; dark grey rings under his eyes made his face look hollow, and his hair was a mess. His thoughts revolved around the blonde for the rest of breakfast.
“Mmm” Draco felt the cleansing charm remove his own and Harry’s cum from his body, sending a shiver down his spine.
Harry looked at him sadly but Draco was having none of it. Get out and don’t come back.”
“What? No! You can’t! Draco, please love, stay”. He made his way towards Draco but stopped at the blonde’s raised hand.
“Oh Harry look, isn’t she gorgeous!” Draco cried happily as their daughter was laid on his chest.
If walls could talk, eh? Harry would probably just deny what they said anyway.
He stood up from the table, running a shaking hand through his hair. “I’m gonna pack my stuff, I’ll go stay with Ron-,” no, he could never explain this to Ron. “Or Seamus and Dean maybe I don’t know-“
“Well, maybe not fully gay since you were with Ginny, but, I’ve seen how look at men Harry, hell, you look at me sometimes”. He smiled at Harry and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.
Draco kept his face stony. “Potter. I have a proposition for you from my department, we need help from your team.” He lifted his head to look at the other man, who smiling at him, a sparkle in his too green eyes.
“Yes. I do. I love you so much, Harry”. Draco pulled him down into a kiss, Harry wrapped his arms around him carefully.
Harry groaned.
“Hey! You loved it and you know it!” Draco giggles as the bigger man tickled him and pushed him. Combined with the tangled sheets around Draco, this lead to him falling off the bed with a thump onto the floor.
Of course Draco didn’t have anything at Harry’s, Harry had kept their affair confined in the walls of Draco’s apartment.
Draco felt the tears run down his face as he let himself be kissed once more. Harry rested his forehead against his.
Harry tugged Draco’s jeans open while the blonde did the same to him. “Off!” Draco snapped while tugging at Harry’s shirt, to which he quickly responded. Draco’s pupils blew at the sight of Harry’s gorgeous abdomen and he pulled him in closer. “I need you, like no other. God I’ll never find another like you, Harry”. Draco moaned into his ear as Harry found his hole. Harry hooked Draco’s legs around his waist and he clung to Harry’s shoulders, nails scraping down his back on every thrust. “Draco, I’m sorry, I’m so
Harry swaggered into the room in only his tight grey boxers, that left very little to Draco’s imagination. The mans shoulders were thick and broad, and his chest was layered with muscles. He wasn’t overly defined, but we was fit as anything and it made Draco shiver.
“Does she make you feel as good as I did when she sucks your cock?” Draco raised his eyebrow as he smirked.
“Evening Darling, where’ve you been?” Draco turned to Blaise who took a step forward to Draco and cornered him up against his wardrobe. “What about him makes him so much
I realise now I could’ve made Draco a trans character :( but I didn’t wanna just add it in now as a rush idea, if I’d thought of it earlier it would’ve been a key part in the story so I apologise, I hope it’s okay!
Smack.
“Next step: The Prophet?” Harry said sarcastically.
“You know that’s not what he meant” Hermione said in a reprimanding tone.
He walked over to Draco and lifted him into his arms, kissing him softly. “Sweetheart, I’m so sorry. I should’ve been more careful. I’m so sorry”. Draco sighed and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. Kissing his neck gently.
And he certainly hadn’t fallen in love with Draco, that was for sure.
Draco knew he looked fucking amazing. He’d bought the lingere months ago, originally intended to wear it for Harry one night. He’d gone with a black lace thong and nylon stockings. He pulled his thick black dressing gown on over it and sat on his bed, waiting.
Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
Draco’s face went white, and he closed his mouth, not speaking as the car started to move.
“I am, alright.” Draco closed his eyes.
“Just tell m-“
Harry decided it was time to get ready for bed. He jumped in the shower and lathered himself in cinnamon body wash. He didn’t know who had given it to him, but it smelt delicious. It reminded him vaguely of treacle tart. He pulled on some sweat pants and raised the light in his room. It was a mess. He used his wand to pile his washing into his basket, then to straighten his drawers and his desk. Next, he had his bed make itself as he cast the dust away out of his rug. Now it looked like someone lived there.
“My own lover, Draco, was not on our side. But he saved me, multiple times through out the war, at the risk of his own life. As did his magnificent mother, who I wish could be with us tonight”.
Draco tasted like nothing Harry could describe. He was bitter sweet, his hole was like
Harry felt Draco tense his grip on Harry’s arm as they entered the ballroom, public events still managed to rile Draco up after all of these years. They were instantly bombarded with photographers and dispensary guests, but Harry’s only focus was his loves’ comfort.
He rubbed his eyes as he pulled on a T-shirt, fumbling for his glasses as he yawned. He got dressed reasonably quickly, but dressed casually. Narcissa wouldn’t approve, but he was Harry Potter.
“In here!” She called from the living room.
Within the next few minutes they had been able to find the Order members they had gone to school with, all of them greeting them enthusiastically.
Not beta'd
“Thank you, Neville. This whole pretence gets on my nerves as well, but I admire your bravery. Please step forwards, number four”.
to face the consequences of your actions. The war is
The next morning Draco was nowhere to be seen at breakfast, and harry hadn’t heard him leave this morning. Maybe he was still in bed feeling sorry for himself. He was watching he entrance of the great hall when he noticed Hermione watching him. He turned to her. “Everything Alright, Harry?” She watched him closely. “Yeah just tired”. She pursed her lips but said nothing more.
, he’d stupify them then and there. He set to work sucking on the rim, lightly dipping his tongue through the muscle, causing Draco to release a long moan. “I’d, I’d never let Jacob, fuck me or, uhhh, even touch me like you. I’m yours P-Potter” Draco barely stumbled over his words between broken moans and shaky breaths. He knew how what he said affected Harry.
“Se agapó”.
As Harry raced up the stairs in the astronomy tower he heard Draco laugh, but it ended in more of a sob. He was clearly drunk. “Malfoy? Malfoy are you alright?” He rushed towards the boy who scrambled to his feet. “Piss off, Potter! Why are you even heeeereeee?” He stumbled forwards,  Harry lurched and caught him; pulling him in close. “Go, away Potter, please?” He looked up into Harry’s eyes desperately trying to get harry to let go of him. “Tell me what’s going on, Draco, what happened today?” He spoke softly to the Slytherin. “He uh, made a joke about my father. Said he ‘couldn’t wait to exploit my daddy issues in the bedroom’ I mean what kind of sick fuck says that? So I slapped him. I’d already had this bloody letter, from my father, I didn’t need his shit too. I’m expected to marry into that family, or some other rich family who has a gay son all so I can produce a bloody heir! It’s so tiresome.” Hardy watched as Draco set light to the letter with his wand.
“But I thought you two were getting back together?” Draco laughed sadly.
Harry looked at Draco and his mother lovingly, he loved having them both in his life. Draco had completed him, truly.
“How could he forget my birthday?! I’m his boyfriend! He completely ignored me this morning and, and”. He couldn’t finish his sentence, he could feel tears pricking his eyes.
Draco turned his head before replying. “It was one kiss, two years ago, it meant nothing!”
Prompt: "The diamond in your engagement ring is fake"
Harry stood up just as Draco was tying his tie. “You’re right, this has gone on long enough.” The Slytherin straightened up and looked at Harry.
Harry had no idea what to expect of the men that had been chosen to be his possible wife, but when the four courtiers entered the throne room he was instantly attracted to the striking blonde who was clad in tight black robes and a scowl that could kill a man playing on his face.
Mr Cuffe looked shocked but jumped at the opportunity. “Absolutely, you can have the first three pages of The Prophet, or more if you need it!”
“It’s not a heart problem, it’s a
Watching Draco come whilst shouting Harry’s name was the most magnificent thing he’d ever seen. He’d walked into the room but Draco hadn’t noticed him as he was so lost in himself- and harry was mesmerised. He could feel his erection growing as he sprinted over to the bed to pounce on his unsuspecting lover.
Harry looked over to the blonde and saw his eyes roll.
The next morning when Harry woke the bed was still warm, but substantially emptied. He sat upright and looked around for his angel, spotting him by the mirror, fixing his gown. “Where are you going?” He asked calmly. Drakon turned around and smiled at him. “I have to go back, my love. We’ll be reunited when you’re finished with this life.” Harry frowned. “How can you go? Isn’t your wing still broken?” He was rambling, trying in vain to say anything to get the angel to stay. “Your magic healed it for me, my love”. Harry raised his eyebrow. “My magic? Is that what the kids are calling it these days?” Draco chuckled.
“We need to talk about something”.
, and of course he will be expelled, you
“Draco”. He burst into a grin, the other mans face going white. “How did you find me? What do- why are you here? I told you to go back to her-“
“Like what you’re seeing, Malfoy?” Harry grinned, a hand wrapping around Draco’s neck as he pulled him in for another heated kiss. “Just get on with it Potter!” The blonde yelled. Harry chuckled before shoving two lubed fingers into the blonde.
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat, tears threatening to roll down his face,
Harry sighed, defeated. There’s no way he could explain what he had done. “I’m sorry Gin. I love you, truly I do. But it’s not something I can change and I was so scared of what would happen, if, if I changed my life. But he changed my life. And, well we had a fight, and he told me,”
Draco shot up from his seat and ran a nervous hand through his hair. “How do I look?” He asked, but didn’t wait for a reply before hurrying out of the Dungeons and up the the Great Hall.
Draco let out a wail as Harry slurped at his arsehole, tongue pressing at the tight muscle. Draco had never felt pleasure like it, it ran through his whole body and caused his toes to curl. He grasped onto the bedsheets tight as Harry darted his tongue inside of Draco.
Drakon smirked. “Eager as always, Hades.” Harry didn’t question the wrong name- he’d heard it somewhere before, but he couldn’t think where- and just focused on the fact that he was kissing an angel. An angel who was pulling him out of his shorts and also unwrapping his own gown, to reveal more beautiful milky white skin. He kissed the angel again as their bodies connected, Drakon releasing a moan that set Harry’s ears ablaze it was so sensual.
Harry
“Gin, I’m sorry. But you and I both know neither of us love each other like that”.
“Here’s his going away bag” Draco told her before bending down to grab the bag. “Draco! You shouldn’t be bending down!” Came Harry’s horrified voice. “I’m pregnant, Harry, not elderly”.
Draco’s moans became low and dirty, breath hitching every few seconds. He knew the man above him would be smirking. He felt Harry press his own chest to Draco’s back, whilst one of his hands moved away from Draco’s waist up to his throat, choking him in pleasure. “You’re filthy, so willing to take my cock, aren’t you? Why’ve you been avoiding me for all of these months if you’re so desperate for me?” The charged words left hot breath on Draco’s ear. He heard the anger, as well as the upset in Harry’s voice.
“Show me how you did that.”
“He’s my whole life, Parkinson, your only debt is to him”.
Draco let out an exasperated noise. “And what is it that’s got you so wound up?”
Draco just stared at the headline.
“Sit”. He said, pointing at the chair across from him.
“Alright.”
Harry scooped Draco up into his arms and lead them back into the bedroom. It was different this time. Harry kissed every inch of Draco softly, savouring every second of him.
“What? What do you mean you thought so?” Harry said defensively.
Ginny frowned at him and her smile wavered.
over me, isn’t it? You’ll say anything to get me to let you fuck me, even make me stay and fucking
Harry just looked at him and sighed, but he didn’t say anything’s a he made his way to the floo.
“I don’t want to hear your excuse. You can’t just give me wet-willies.” Draco huffed, shoving his boyfriend backwards.
Draco rolled over to face his husband’s grinning face, and couldn’t help but smile himself. “Obviously not, I still expect you to shag me when we’re 103”. Draco moved closed to the burly man beside him and kissed him softly, but Harry helped the kiss quickly build speed by pulling Draco onto his naked chest.
Draco, on the other hand didn’t work, well, not officially. He wrote novels under an alias that sell like wildfire, but in the public’s eyes he was just Harry’s plaything that lived off of him, however Draco didn’t mind that narrative nearly as much as people thought.
They’d both been so nervous, neither of them knew what to do. But it only took them a couple of minutes to get started, and then they couldn’t stop. Harry has then proceeded to fuck him in the shower, and then again on the sofa. It was a hell of a good thing his mother had moved to France and his father was in Azkaban, as they’d made enough noise to wake the whole of Hogwarts.
“And my beautiful, beautiful daughter Carina Lily, knows she holds the strength of every woman who fought His evil in her name. I am grateful for you all, I am so happy that so many of us are still here, living out what we fought for.”
“I’ve been seeing someone. A man. I’ve been seeing a man.” His breathing hitched, panic setting in as Ginny dropped her knife, staring at him in shock, eyebrows scrunched.
“Wow, Potter. That wasn’t actually half bad”. Draco joked as Harry pulled out of him.
Draco was shaking, he was so scared and turned on by Harry’s display of power. “T-that’s not true”. He stuttered, both of them knowing it was. Harry moved his hands down to Draco’s waist and pulled the man onto his lap. He grasped Draco’s hips tight, grinding their crotches together. Draco let out a trembling moan and grasped on to Harry’s shoulders.
Draco spent the rest of his free period in a haze, dawdling around the school. He had a date with Jacob that evening but he’d decided fuck it, he couldn’t date him when he was so infatuated by Potter. Right then he walked slap bang into Ginny Weasley.
The dark haired boy raised an eyebrow at him in speculation as Draco shifted his way down Harry’s body.
Draco closed his eyes as he heard Harry mumble his address, and then he was gone.
This is a really short chapter guys I’m sorry- it’s just 500 words as an interlude before the next chapter. Light smut and Topless Ginny guys.
“Went to go and talk to Harry, flooed about 20 minutes ago”. Ron nodded slowly. He’d woken up because his wife wasn’t in bed next to him, and wasn’t surprised that she was awake to help a friend.
“Yeah well, none of that matters now, does it?”
things you let me do to you?” The husk in Harry’s voice turned Draco on even more. He shook his head, which made Harry growl. The sound sent a shiver down Draco’s back.
“Harry! Calm down! Listen to me”, she pulled his face into her hands. “You have to be you, no one else can. Be the real you, stop caring about what everyone else thinks, alright? Go and find him and tell him how you feel! Let me worry about Ron, he’ll be angry for all the wrong reasons.” She laughed, smiling lovingly at Harry.
“Goodbye then, Potter.” His word hung between them for only seconds before Harry lurched forward and connected Draco’s lips with his own as he held the Slytherins jaw, whose on hands were pressed to Harry’s chest. Finally, they broke apart, both panting. Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s and sighed.
“Weasley? What do you want?” He asked in shock.
Draco’s sighed defeatedly. Harry moves towards him, embracing him loosely. “How did you know that stuff? About the ring, and him..doing that to me?” he stuttered through his words, looking up at Harry timidly.
“What the hell have I gotten myself into?” Harry smiled up at him.
He let small tears roll down his cheeks as he walked home through the rain (dratted apparation points were flooded and he’d never get in one). He shivered as he reached their apartment and unlocked the door.
Draco had kept it. He’d kept part of Harry. Why had Harry been such an asshole? He felt like a complete idiot as the kettle started to whistle.
“I don’t want anything else but you, Daddy, not ever”. He heard Harry growl at his words, and then the tip of his cock of his cock breach his quivering hole and he screamed out in ecstasy again.
let anyone hurt you again, please I’ve been so terrible to you but I just want to make it right, to be there for you whenever you need me.” The blonde started to shake, all fragility left his face. “What in the
“You crazy bastard! There’s nothing there yet and I’m only about 3 weeks, there’s still a chance we could-“
They leaned up against the sides of two shops that formed an alley, and Ron lit up for them. “So how’ve you been, mate? I feel like we barely see eachother and I see you everyday” Harry laughed. “Yeah it does. It’s been rough but, I’m coping you know”. Ron nodded in agreement. “Me and Hermione are doing really well, we’ve both been offered ministry positions. How about you? Going to accept the offer for minister of magic?” Harry shoved his friend. “No, definitely not. I think I might become the defence teacher, what do you think?” Rons face lit up. “Now that’s a job I could see you going in to.” Just then they were interrupted by a high pitched squeal of a laugh and both turned towards its source, and Harry’s mouth soured.
Neither of them could hold out much longer, so Draco slid down onto his lover’s cock, causing them both to gasp in the pleasure.
“Hear what you bint?” He drawled. Blaise chuckled his way into the conversation.
“I can’t, Potter. I can’t be friends with you, I want to be but I just can’t.” He went lax against the wall in defeat.
The man sat in the chair sat up immediately, eyes wide with a smirk instantly forming on his stupidly handsome face. “Malfoy! To what do I owe the pleasure?”
He decided to just pull on a pair of grey joggers, he didn’t feel the need to bother with a shirt.
figuratively. He has always been captivated by you, Mr Potter. But if you do not love him, I ask of you to stay away from him. You hurting him again could actually kill him. I will not lose my son to you, Mr Potter.” Harry was speechless. Mrs Malfoy arose and started heading for the door. “But what if I do love him?” She turned back to look at Harry, who was shaking lightly. “
Harry chuckled and sat back down in bed, smiling at Draco. “Why not? I’ve needed a new personal assistant for a few weeks now. You’ve got the qualifications and it pays well, so why not?”
the hickeys. He tore up the stairs to Dean and Seamus’ room.
should have let him get close enough to hurt you. I will never,
Harry woke up still in Draco’s apartment, clinging tightly to Draco’s pillow. His scent was fading away, leaving Harry. He knew he had to find Draco or he’d go mad.
“Do you want any more children after this one?” Draco asked quietly. Harry stilled, looking down at his lover. “I think, for now, we’re good with two. But if we ever want more, if you, ever want more. We can. But if you want to stop here, that’s alright with me.” Draco nodded. “I don’t know if I want to do this again,” he indicated to his belly, “but if it happens again, I won’t be apposed to keeping it”. Harry scrunched his nose. “If you do get pregnant again, it’s your choice if we keep it or not. I will not be angry at you if you don’t want to be pregnant again, because I love you whatever. You know that, right?”
“M-more,” panted Draco, his eyes rolled back as their cocks met again.
The whole world thought they’d spilt up, and they had, for almost 3 years.
Alone again.
He scooped Draco up and took him back into their house, slamming the door behind them. Draco clung to Harry as he took them both upstairs to their room.
“You fucking slut” he hissed out. Draco heard him cast a spell and their outer clothes were removed. Wandless magic, how fucking hot.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” He asked, not knowing what she meant.
“You’ll pay for that later, my sweet”. Justin spat in his ear, his grip on Draco’s arm starting to sting. Draco’s confidence faltered. He wouldn’t really hurt him, would he?
“Draco Malfoy”.
Male pregnancy is a complicated thing, the magic involved is very confusing and intricate, and far too long to explain.
“You should leave him! He’s not good enough for you Harry!”
Harry just scoffed at him. “You’re not in love with me, Malfoy, we were barely even together”.
“Sorry to disturb you but I just came to check- oh my god!” Shock radiated through the young code breakers eyes as he stared helplessly at the site in front of him.
They both came happily, and Draco smiled as he slid off of Harry.
“Mr Potter, thank you for agreeing to see me.” He nodded and shook her hand. “It’s the least I could do” he said before sitting down across from her. It felt weird being near her in such a casual setting- last time they’d been this close she’d pronounced him dead.
Draco was rather put out by the obnoxious banging that had started on his door. It was almost 11pm and he had been getting ready to go to bed when the rhythmless racket started.
He gasped as he turned around and Potter was leaning in the door frame, in all of his 6’3” glory. His shirt was far too tight for those bulging arms. “I’m sorry for taking this it’s just so cold I’ll take it off right-“
“Harryyy! Oh gods I’m coming!” Harry smirked, kissing his husband through his orgasm as he sought out his own release which came shortly after.

He got up and started pacing around the room. “Hermione you can’t, tell anyone, okay? It would destroy me.” She frowned. “Harry, I’m not talking to you to save

Harry couldn’t fucking stand it any longer. He and Draco had been together for TWO YEARS and people still verbally and magically attacked his boyfriend for being with Harry. Draco always acted like it was nothing, but it upset Harry to see his love hurt.
” His voice was drenched with venom, Harry’s face blanched at the sight of the tears streaming down the face of the boy that hated him, the boy that he loved. “You think you’re some
“You are going to make the perfect wife”. Harry said with a grin as he pulled Draco back down onto his chest, both of them sighing in satisfaction.
He stops in his tracks before entertaining the Great Hall. What was he doing? Was he just going to walk up to Harry and say “you’re gay too?” And hope something happened? He shrugged to himself, that wasn’t his worst idea yet.
Wow a second chapter the day after I posted the first one? Organised or what. This one is only about 1500 words but there is a fair amount of smut and angst, and even a little fluff! For some reason italics doesn’t work anymore so I’ve used / to indicate when something should be in italics. Thanks for over 350 hits in the first day, it means a lot! (Edit- Italics have been fixed!)
He leant back against the wall and knocked his head back.
about it.
“Of course we did! We wouldn’t miss this for the world” Pansy spoke again. “Some witch tried to stop ya coming in, as if she could”. Scoffed Ron. Hermione and Blaise nodded too.
. He started panicking, pushing lamely at his captor. “
“I HAVE TO GO, DRACO. THERE’S NO GETTING OUT OF IT! I TOLD YOU 6 MONTHS AGO THAT THERE WOULD BE TIMES I HAD TO DO THINGS YOU WOULDN’T LIKE!”.
But oh boy was he not ready.
Then one day Draco just, stopped talking to him. It’d been 4 days and Harry couldn’t bear not knowing what he’d done wrong, and how he’d ruined their friendship.
“Why yes, white easily. I love Ginny, and she loves me, but we are not in love with each other. In fact, we’re both in love with other people. Her, her quidditch coach, and me, a man whom I fell so head over heels for but was too stupid to realise.”
“I’m doing well, mother, much better than with James. But I supposed we’re more practised at this now.” She nodded as she took his hand in hers. “Well, as I said last time, you handle childbirth much better than I did”. She said, squeezing his hand.
“Alright, alright!” They both laughed before Draco gasped as harry pulled his fingers out of him. Harry moves them up to Draco’s face, hovering them over his lips. He raised his eyebrow before letting out a deep moan as Draco sucked his fingers into his mouth. “God you’re so gorgeous baby.” Draco smiled at him and pulled Harry’s face down and kissed him dirtily.
“Don’t even try to deny it, he told me”.
“God your arse looks delicious”. His voice was deep with desire as he surveyed his fiancés body. He was wearing nothing but a silk thong harry had bought him a few weeks ago, and it was making him harder than hell. The thong barely covered Draco’s cock and rode high on his hips, the silk slipped between his arse cheeks and covered his tight hole. “Gonna eat you out”. He said. Draco moaned in satisfaction as Harry pulled off the underwear with his teeth, trailing it down Draco’s legs.
As they entered the party room they were met by a cheer, Draco’s forced smile made his face hurt. He was thankful when Pansy, his childhood friend, rushed forward to greet him, pulling him away from Justin who was being enamoured by twenty other guests.
about this?” Concern plastered the darker boy’s face. Harry nodded. They stumbled their way up the stairs to the sounds of shouts from the Slytherins’ dorm.
“Do you need a job?”
“AAAAH! “ Draco screeched, “What the fuck, potter? Why the fuck would you do that to me?!” A red faced, rather disgruntled looking Draco snapped.
Just then, there was a knock at the door before a mane of red hair joined them in the living room. “Hey guys! Oh I’m so happy for you both! We’d obviously be willing to babysit the new one if they’re anything like James is!” They laughed as Harry handed James off to Ginny.
Blaise walked over to Narcissa and hugged her. “Of course you’ll be there, no doubt my own mother won’t be.” He sighed, Ron stepped forward and wrapped an arm around his boyfriend, comforting him. “Don’t worry, love. When I finally get you pregnant, you’ll have everyone you’ll need there.” Blaise smiles and leaned into his boyfriend, kissing him chastely.
He kissed him with all the sorry he had, he kissed him with all the love he had for him, even if it was platonic, he kissed him because he didn’t know what else to do.
Draco frowned, forcing the tears to stay in his eyes. “Fuck you, Potter” he turned to leave the kitchen.
“What the hell am I gonna do about Ginny?” He sighed.
“Oh fuck, fuck fuck fuck!” Draco couldn’t stop shouting as his skin clapped against Harry’s thighs. The man must really be strong if he’d been able to hold Draco up against the wall for this long.
Harry laughed before pulling his boyfriend on top of him, dragging him down for a kiss. “I woke you up for an excellent reason though,” the former Gryffindor smirked. Draco easier his eyebrow dubiously. “And that is?”
it.” She looked at him from across the desk, an electricity running through her widened eyes.  He took his face out of his hands and nodded.
“Right, because he didn’t make you fall in love with him over those 8 months, that was just a coincidence?”
“I think it’s only fair I return the favour”. Harry’s eyes went dark as he was un tucked from his robes and felt Draco’s devilish tongue on the under side of his cock. “Jesus!” He moaned as his tip was taken into Draco’s menacing mouth. “The name's Draco, Darling, please try to remember”. Harry let out a deep groan as Draco took him all the way into his mouth, bobbing his head perfectly as he sucked the life out of him.
Draco came not thirty seconds later- screaming Harry’s name- with an enraptured moan as his climax hit, and Harry followed suite with a roar. They lay wrapped up in eachother, panting through smiles.
Harry stood up, chuckling to himself. Draco could almost feel the guests holding their collective breath, before he realised he too had stopped breathing. “Admit it, you’re broke. Have been for a while since you spent all your money gambling, and lost it all. There’s barely a galleon to your name is there, Justin. I know that Draco’s father is paying for everything.” Justin’s jaw snap shut, his body physically shaking as Harry made his way towards the stage.
that saved my son, I knew straight away, Mr Potter.” Harry shook his head. “I saved Draco because that’s what any decent person would, Mrs Malfoy.” She rolled her eyes. “You don’t shatter
Draco mewled at Harry’s words and shook his head. “Please, you cant be serious!” He begged as Harry stroked his cock more urgently. Harry leaned down over Draco until their noses were touching. “Say you’ll marry me and I’ll give you more”. Harry growled.
“I’m sorry”. Harry whispered. Draco shook his head.
She laughed at him.
“Boys! you had to miss my party but you caused your own right across the front page of the Prophet!” Draco and harry woke with a start, tangled up in their sheets.
“So I could fuck you again, you idiot, what did you think?”
As soon as Harry stepped through the door Draco rushed up and hugged him, repeatedly whimpering “I’m sorry” into his husband’s shoulder.
“What?”
“They are part of the reason why I cannot possibly be the main man. Just because I was the one to land the final blow, does not mean I ended Voldemort all on my own. Both Ginny and Neville fought bravely then, and Seamus would have probably ended old No Nose in a much more entertaining way than me!”
Draco went to talk but was silenced by a held up finger. “Let me talk, please. I don’t want this to stop. So let’s not stop. We don’t talk about her, and we don’t mention him. It’s just sex. That’s all it has to be. We’ll keep it professional, only fuck at arranged times. We can go on ignoring eachother for the other parts of our lives.”
obvious how he felt for Draco? Who else knew? He wanted to kick himself for being so reckless. He was lost in self pity when Hermione linked their arms and dragged him into an empty charms classroom. “Harry, sit down please. I need you to stay calm, and reasonably quiet throughout this conversation.” He did as he was told and took a seat on the front row. “What is it, Hermione?” She stared at him deeply. “We didn’t see much of you, over the summer Harry. You’ve rushed right back into the world after saving it, and now you’re fucking everything up for yourself.” She said matter of factly. “Right. So what are we talking about exactly?” He shifted in his seat in exasperation. “I came to see you, over the summer. At Grimmauld Place. About two days before you got back with Ginny”. Harry felt his pulse quicken. “So what?” His voice hitched in his throat. “So,
“No, but he was. If you did what was right, I’m sure he’d find his way to you” She room a swig of her wine.
Harry, on the other hand, was rather awkwardly shifting from one foot to the other.
Draco turned his head to look up at Harry. “You healed the hickeys” Harry opened his mouth to speak but closed it again. He’d done it yesterday in the shower, not thinking anything of it. “Uh yeah, well I mean if Ginny sees-“ Draco stiffened up next to him, untangled himself from Harry and got out of bed.
Harry fucked him hard, just as he promised he would. He slammed his hips forward, grunting into Draco’s shoulder that was littered with love bites. He wrapped a hand around the blonde’s neck, who gasped at the pleasure. “I’m close, Daddy please I’m so close” he sobbed at the feeling of Harry’s huge member as it abused his prostate. “Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you”.
Part 11-
The smaller man let out a gasp as his arse was once again ploughed into, Harry’s thrusts deliberate and drawn out. They turned Draco into a writhing mess.
be the pair that had it happen twice,
“Why did you stay, then? If you’re just going to leave again?” He asked quietly.
(See the end of the chapter for
He crept slowly into the bed and wrapped an arm around the Slytherin. He landed butterfly kisses on his forehead, then his cheek, jaw and lips. Draco’s eyelids fluttered open and he looked up at the other boy, a confused smile on his flushed lips. “I thought we-“ Harry shushed him. “I know, but you’re tired. So just stay here with me.” Draco raised his eyebrow but then snuggled into Harry, rest his head in the crook of his shoulder. Harry fell asleep not too long after his lover, his hand still entwined in the soft blonde hair.
“Even if you do find someone, we both know no one can top me” Harry said rather cockily, in a rubbish attempt to stop him leaving.
In fact he didn’t love him so much so that he’d jumped right back into his ex’s arms, not a month after breaking up with Draco.
“Now, if we leave we can still make it to the party in time before the cake runs out” his boyfriend- no, fiancé- kissed him again and again.
sobriety left, whipped out his wand and cast the spell to unlock the door.
Two days later, they were back home in bed, with James tucked up between them as Draco held Lily. James had been enchanted by the sight of his little sister, wanting to know everything about her. The resemblance between them was shocking, although James’ hair was blonde and clearly much tamer than his sisters. Harry couldn’t help but be overjoyed at the sight of his family, still not understanding how he deserved such a wonderful husband, and their two brilliant children.
“Even in your sixties you can turn me on, your talents are infinite”. Smirked Harry. They linked arms again before heading into the ballroom.
Based off of a Drabble request ask, smut entails
The nurse asked if they wanted to let their friends back in, and the couple agreed fervently. Pansy and Hermione bounded into the room first, exclaiming shrilly at the sight of their god daughter.
“Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, Loves Another man”.
His private rooms had probably been one of the main things that spurred them in for so long. The few of them that had returned for their 8th year had been put in a separate tower and only shared a room with one other student instead of 4.
(See the end of the chapter for
Later that evening, Justin was giving a speech, with Draco sat beside him looking up at him with fake adoration, laughing at his unfunny jokes and wishing the gold chandelier would just fucking fall on him- he didn’t know if he meant himself or Jacob, and he really didn’t care.
With another sigh, he rolled over dramatically and shut his eyes, willing for sleep to take over.
Draco would not sleep tonight. Salazar Potter was an ass.
“I hear the Weasley’s quite a prude actually” Jacob gave him a surprised look. “An affair with the chosen one. Wonder who the lucky woman is”.
“Nearly there now sweet, you’re doing so well beautiful”. Draco mewled at his husband’s praise, willing himself to last just a little bit longer.
“And of course, there are those who we lost in the war, and along the way. My sons James Sirius, and Cedric Remus, know they were named after the strongest, most resilient men that died to save me, as vain as that sounds. I value them all so much-“
When Harry’s orgasm had finally finished, Draco unlatched from around his cock and he was met by a very red faced, grinning Harry. “Bet
This is the original tumblr prompt, the timeline will start to make sense soon, I hope.
“Potter, please” Draco’s weak voice begged, wanting nothing more than to kiss and punch the man at the same time. Harry started to kiss at his neck, causing Draco to let out a moan. He felt his arms instinctively wrap around the bearded mans neck, no matter how much he told himself he didn’t want this.
“Ginny”. Stop. Complete silence.
“That was incredible” Draco whispered to Harry in awe as the older man crawled back up the bed and lay beside Draco. “Thank you, glad to see you not scowling at me”. Draco rolled his eyes as Harry pulled him into his chest.
Draco pointed at the chair opposite him and Harry sat down expectantly.
I said I'd have the next chapter up soon, and here it is! I haven't completely decided on how the next chapter will go, but I'll update the tags when it's released. Hope you enjoy!
“Potter”. He said loudly, getting the attention of many of those around them.
They were both panting heavily, Harry rested his forehead against his husband’a and they shared a euphoric smile.
“He’s your person, Harry.” He nodded to himself, and causing a confused expression to take over his friend’s face. He turned back to Hermione and they went upstairs, leaving them to figure it out for themselves.
“I’m going home, Potter.” He said in a bored tone. Harry’s eyes widened erratically.
“Stop calling me that! Stop acting as if you fucking care about me!” Tears managed to escape down Draco’s face and he tried desperately to wipe them away, not looking at Harry.
Harry loosened his grip on Draco’s wrists, fearing he’d hurt him. “But why? What did I do wrong?”
“When I kissed you, that was right after a different boyfriend had hit you, wasn’t it? I’d wanted to rip that one to pieces too, come to think of it”.
Harry tumbled into his room and sought out the switch so he could get changed into more comfortable clothes. He pulled off his shirt and trousers when he remembered that he’d lent his defence notes to Seamus and he needed them back.
“Nothing, Blaise. You’re gorgeous, you
“Okay come off I’m gonna come” panted Harry, but Draco didn’t budge. “You don’t need to, oh god Draco I’m going to-“ his own moans of pleasure cut him off.
Harry turned and nodded his head at Dean, Hannah and Luna who all smiled sadly back at him.
, his beautiful pale skin drove Harry insane, he loved the way his own deep skin contrasted with the milky white of his lover’s. If someone had told him six months earlier that he’d be eating Draco Malfoy out for
“You’re still drunk” he reminded him.
Both Draco and Harry had aged well, neither of them were as physically fit as they had been in their twenties but Harry still had broad shoulders and stocky thighs, he’d shot up to 6’3 so his physique suited him. His unruly hair was still inky black, but was now heavily peppered with grey and white hairs that gave a Harry a very charming appearance, that matched the thick, but well groomed, beard on his jaw.
“Blaise, darling, how is your cousin Jacob?” Draco smiles at his friend sweetly who scowled in return. “He’s no better than I am, Draco. You know I’m better suited to you” Pansy giggled. “Darling, Draco doesn’t want a man who’s desperate for him, he likes a challenge”. Blaise shook his head.
He smiled sheepishly at Jacob as he arrived outside the room of requirement. “Hey, babe. Good of you to make it!” Jacob took his arm and led him into the room. Pansy had really outdone herself, it looked like a proper club, strobe lights and slutty music ensnared the dancers s. He spotted Harry on the other side of the room and scowled as he saw the boy look at him.
“What is it?” She said, sitting down on her sofa.
Harry had forced Draco to stay with him for a week, they’d spent it fucking and laughing and doing, doing things couples would probably do. It made Draco’s heart pang to remember. He’d really been stupid enough to let himself fall for the golden boy.
“Can Lily sleep in my room?” He begged, looking up with pleading eyes at his parents.
“Do you remember, that day over the summer when, you and I cooked dinner at Grimmauld place? And you asked if I was for pudding? You ate me out on a 200 year old table, Harry Potter. And I know it’s pathetic as all hell but that week, that week made me think you might actually love me back, but I realised today that that was never going to happen.” Silence.
“My my, Potter, are you looking for a new partner tonight in that suit?” Harry spun around to see his boyfriend surveying him with a look of lust in his eyes. “Of course not, can’t say the same for you though, God’s I could just eat you up right now.” His boyfriend chuckled as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, snuggling into the crook of his shoulder.
“Because I had to, you know I had to.”
Harry had no idea what to say. Thirty seconds of silence went by between them before Draco finally opened his eyes and looked at him, his face seemed so empty now as if the spark in him had been stamped out.
He thought back to the first time they had done it, first 3 times really. It had been July 8th, Draco remembered walking down to the front door and opening it to a rather shy looking Gryffindor who offered him back his old wand. He’d stepped aside and invited him in. They’d gone to the kitchen where Draco had offered Harry a drink. Who knew the saviour would like camomile tea? They’d started talking about the war, as Harry had spoken at Draco’s and his parent’s trial not a month previous.
The 50th Anniversary of the Battle Of Hogwarts was a fine event, lavished with the most expensive decorations possible and wines with exquisite vintages, all for the star guests, Harry Potter and the Order. Of course, not everyone was still there unfortunately, but still it was important to celebrate what they had achieved, as that kept the memories of their lost friends going, too.
“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open, is something I was once told. And it rings true. Our differences should only bring us closer, not distance us. For as long as we stand together, we stand undefeated”.
“Gods I missed you more, Darling”. Draco leant down and kissed him, his hands clasping the sides of his lover’s face. He adored the feeling of Harry’s beard on his own smooth skin, and couldn’t wait to feel it between his thighs.
His day had been completely miserable though, despite Ron’s certainty. The paper work he’d been asked to finish off was taking far longer than he’d hoped.
Harry sat up.
Not beta'd
Draco used this to push past Harry and walk out into the living room. He noticed that Harry had collected all his stuff up and piled it up against the wall.
Harry’s advisory Montgomery stepped forward to speak.
“Potter, as lovely as it is to have you-“ Justin started, a snotty tone taking over. “The diamond in your ring is fake, Draco”. Harry turned to the blonde, his face expressionless. Draco frowned, wondering how the raven haired man could know such a thing. “That’s preposterous! How dare you!” Sputtered Justin, his ugly face reddening.
Once school had started up again for their “8th year” Harry had told himself it had to end, he and Ginny had taken up their relationship again in late August.
“I love doing that so much, especially with you” Draco sighed, pulling his Harry into a hug. “I love you too, pretty”. This was some of Harry’s favourite sex that they had, full of love and happiness. And he’d missed it a lot, missed spending time together, but now the could spend time as a bigger family, the family neither of them thought they would have- or deserved. But, they did.
day. It wouldn’t stand, and Harry would just have to do
“Thank you, Ginny, really”. He hugged her tightly. “I’ll always be here Harry.”
Harry pulled his boyfriend into him and pushed through the reporters, anger bubbling up inside of him.
“God, you don’t understand how much I’ve wanted this, Draco. Missed being inside of you so much” he growled into his husbands ear as their hands roamed over each other, both of them like horny teenagers once again.
The door was locked, but now the sounds of struggle were apparent. Rage coated Harry who, without thinking, tried to ram the door down with a roar. Blaise, who still had
“There you are!” He grinned as Draco stepped out of the bathroom with ruffled hair and pinked skin. He stepped sleepily into Harry’s arms and snuggled against his chest. “Come on kitten, lets get you into bed”. He lifted Draco up easily and pulled them both into the bed. Draco spread himself out across Harry’s chest and entwined their legs, sighing happily as he nuzzled into Harry’s neck.
“No, baby, look at me”.
With that, she shooed him away and went behind the curtain of Draco’s cubicle. Harry was in shock. In all the time they’d spent together Malfoy had never once mentioned it, nor had he ever seen draco taking any potions. He slipped back into the ward and crept behind the cubicle he had assumed Draco was in, and lay in wait for Madame Pomfrey to leave.
As he waited for the kettle to boil he opened the cupboard to find a mug and was taken aback when his shattered mug was sat their looking at him, small lines visible from where a repairo had been cast on it.
Finally, Harry pulled himself out of Draco with a mutual grown, and rolled onto the other side of the bed before pulling Draco onto his chest, and wrapping his arms around him in a way that would suggest he was scared he’d disappear otherwise. He stroked the blonde’s hair and closed his eyes. He could feel Draco tracing the deepest scar across his upper chest, and he knew there were too many words unsaid between them.
--------------------
Then, the summer had come to an end and Harry had told him very awkwardly about getting back together with Ginny. “I want to try and make it work, Draco” he’d stiffened up and gathered his things, feeling stupid for thinking Potter would ever choose him. “I see. Have fun, Potter.” And with that he’d left and ignored Harry for the 3 days before September first. He’d been so angry he’d blocked Harry from the floo and all the wards, yet Harry had kept trying to get in.
“Brilliant to see you mate!” Exclaimed Ron as he pulled Draco into a manly hug. “Likewise, it’s been too long” replied Draco with a genuine smile.
Harry didn’t know what made him do it, but the innocent look on the other boys face made him want to kiss him, only lightly, but it was worth so much more the the fierce way they kissed when they were fucking.
Harry smiled deeply back at him.
“I’m gay”.
Draco kissed Jacob lightly on the cheek as they said goodbye, he was quite lucky really as Potter was right, it was very nearly the 6th year curfew.
that’s not how I see you, what I think of you. I
and there was something in Jacob’s eye, the way he looked at Draco. He couldn’t wait for Ginny to get back so instead started to make his way out across the dance floor when someone grabbed his arm. “Potter, have you seen Draco anywhere? He’s not meant to be drinking on the potions he’s taking. I need to make sure he’s alright”. Blaise had genuine concern in his eyes, Harry nodded to him and they pushed their way out of the room of requirement.
Ron and Hermione looked at each other again.
He nodded his head shakily, and harry pulled him in for the most passionate kiss the two had shared since their first, all that time ago. “I love you too, Harry. I have never stopped”.
For the second time that night Draco was woken abruptly by sounds coming from his home. He was alone in the bed, his neck ached from the way he has been laid down.
.” She sighed. He steadied himself against the wall. He wanted to cry, scream maybe. “No one will love you less for being
hickeys” Harry turned to face a sultry eyed Pansy and chuckled heartily.
“We all had to make some tough decisions in that war, many of us children still, forced into making hurrendous decisions.”
Goodnight Seamus, Goodnight Dean” Harry laughed at the gasps he heard as he exited the dorm. He wondered when that had happened.
They waited a second and then they heard it, a giggle coming from somewhere in the room.
Not beta'd
Draco smirked at him. Harry just stared.
“No, Potter. This was a mistake, okay? Letting you fuck me was a mistake, so I’m going to leave. Forget this happened, Potter, please”.
“I did! But your incessant moaning must have broken the barriers” The smirk on the idiots face was infuriating to Draco,
Now as a cis man, Draco wasn’t born with a womb, but, during sex gay wizards can create bonds that make them susceptible to pregnancy, which is exactly what happened. It is very rare and often takes years to occur, and very rarely happens more than once, so obviously, Draco and Harry
Harry did his best to calm his breathing. “I know for a fact you’ve had sex with Blaise Zambini since we split up” Harry spat out harshly.
“Obviously I made a mistake getting back together with Ginny. The guy I’d been seeing, wanted me to tell people we were together, and I got scared, so I said no, and I said some pretty hurtful other things too, and I ended it”.
“Of course I can, you always open the door don’t you?”
Draco and Jacob has obviously been shopping too as they both carried at least 20 bags between them- suddenly they were rushed upon by photographers sporting the Daily Prophet logo. “Mr Malfoy! Mr Malfoy! Is Mr Zabini your boyfriend? What about Blaise Zambini- is this part of a family rivalry?” Questions were yelled at them from every angle as they ducked into a restaurant. Harry made sure to note the name in his mind- “La Jolie Fleur”.
Draco had only just left Harry’s room- looking flushed and alert, colour ran across his pale skin from his cheeks down to his chest- when he ran into the Ravenclaw he’d been avoiding. He’d been kissed silly for 20 minutes as he had tried to gather his clothes and regain some of his modesty.
“That’s rather a lot, isn’t it? I’m sure our readers will also feel a lot when reading this. Now, Mr Potter, how do you feel?”
that. But we’re not the right fit for each other.” He rested a hand against the other boys cheek. “So,” Blaise purred in his usual seductive tone, “have you ever thought about us having sex?” A smirk played on his mouth as he asked. Draco rolled his eyes. “I promise that one day I will let you ravish me to your hearts content. But
He decided not to open the letter straight away. He tucked it into his desk draw and would open it...later. He hated letters from his father. They were always filled with hatred.
“I, I lost our baby”. Draco looked up at Harry cautiously. Harry paused and made eye contact with his spouse.
As they came in a maitre dea rushed forward to take their coats and a waitress lead them to their table. “Well, that was unexpected” said Jacob with a grin as they sat down. “Quite. I do hope I’m not just part of a family rivalry though.” He said with an equally sly grin. “Of course not, though you’re still a prize any day of the week”. Said Jacob with a wink before reaching for a menu. As the waitress took their orders- a Caesar salad and chicken breast for him and a medium done steak for Jacob- Draco wondered where Harry would be taking Her for lunch. Just then, his question was answered.
“But right now, sex is not on that list, sorry champ.” Patting Harry’s face, Draco grinned evilly as he jumped up and headed in the direction of their bedroom, Harry stumbling up behind him, obviously unconvinced.
Harry was just finishing his toast when Pansy strode back into the room, this time towards the Gryffindor table. Harry watched as she whispered excitedly in Hermione’s ear, who looked as equally excitable. “Tonight, we’ll go over it all. See you later!” Hermione nodded frenziedly. “What’s that all about?” Asked Ron intriguingly. She mimed zipping her lips and that was his answer.
”. He heard Jacob’s belt opening and his throat went dry.
“I don’t know why you’d even bring this up, Draco” Harry groaned.
He slinked into the bedroom in just his boxers and Harry’s T-shirt from the night before. He got himself settled under the covers and waited for his host.
“You were going to propose...to me?”
“So you love me?” He said softly, almost smiling at Harry.
Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry’s neck as the head of his cock breached Draco’s hole, causing them both to pant. He tried to urge Harry to speed up but the brute was instant on drawing it out. “Draco,” He panted, voice rasping, “You’re so fucking tight and I’m so fucking in love with you”. He cried out as Harry slammed right into his prostate and set a rough, hard pace that made Draco cling to his back, leaving deep scratch marks.
“I’m fine, really. Just hay fever”. The taller man just stared at him for a minute before coming to his decision- which turned out to be wrapping Draco up into quite an awkward, but comforting hug.
“But we’re going to have to use some protection charms, because I’m going to need to make up for all that missed sex before you go getting pregnant again.” They both laughed once more, kissing in between giggles.
Draco let out another gasp as Harry lay him down on to the bed before starting to undress. Draco reached for the hem of his own robes and began to remove his shirt, his hands trembling as Harry watched him, stark naked. The blonde did everything he could to avoid looking at Harry’s cock, which of course meant his eyes flicked down to it every other second.
He felt Harry’s arms wrap around his waist, and then he was being lifted and pushed up into the wall. Harry kissed him fiercely, it was all teeth and tongues fighting each other. “Gonna fuck me, Potter?” Draco spat, digging his fingers into Harry’s neck, causing him to growl.
Not beta'd
He slipped into his dorm as quietly as he could, hoping Blaise was asleep. He was not. In fact, he was lazing at his desk pretending to study- slow jazz playing on a vinyl. “Since when were you such a
“And how did you meet this man?”
“Just do it” he whined.
As soon as they stepped outside into the rather harsh rain, they were bombarded by paparazzi and fans. Harry felt Draco squeeze his hand tightly as the hateful shouts started in his direction.
Harry put a hand to the side of Draco’s face, moving it gently to look at him directly.
He frowned at her before remembering what happened at the start of the war.
“You know, if you can’t sleep, we could have sex?” Harry asked hopefully. Draco let out a shocked gasp and slapped his arm.

“Quiet”. He snapped.
The kiss grew heated, quickly. Draco tangled his hands in Harry’s hair and in turn Harry had pushed Draco up against the wall and had lifted him up on to his waist, griped at Draco’s arse with one hand and using the other to support them both.
Prompt: "Fever"
He mainly went to muggle nightclubs or gay bars, the men there were always enticed by him- his shoulder length hair that seemed to glow in the neon lights, his slim hips that were usually clad in tight jeans that hugged his rather plump arse and a black thong that rode on his hips.
“A drunk mans words are his sober thoughts” Harry slurred, obviously impressed with himself.
because you know you want it too. So stop being a
“Draco I-“ but he was then signalled to be quiet.
“Why you monster?”.
“I’ll buy a better door lock”.
This is the first work in my Tumblr Drabbles collection! Here's a link to it on
“Yeah I am, got something to say about that Malfoy?” He spat out defensively. Draco’s face split into a devilish grin.
“Drakon”. He whispered. They stared at eachother for a moment before Drakon seemed to realise he was still in Harry’s lap and hurried to stand up. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be here. I’m not meant to come to earth but, I couldn’t help it. The storm can be very convincing”. Harry furrowed his brow.
As he trudged up the stairs he could hear Draco’s tired breath, he was obviously almost asleep. Draco was in love with him. Had been for all this time. Harry couldn’t deny that he’d always been infatuated by Draco, but to call it love? He shook his head and knocked on Draco’s dorm door. No reply. Great, Zambini must have gone out again. Harry remembered how in their old dorms their hands acted as the key on the door knob, so he crouched down and, using Draco’s hand, twisted the door open.
He strolled back down to the common room and initially ignored the gasps as people noticed his toned torso. He knew Draco had seen him,
“And now, I will hand over to the main man of the show, Mr Harry Potter!”.
Harry rushed forward to Draco and scooped him up against his chest, checking he was still breathing. His face was all bloodied and Harry could see bruises forming under his thin shirt. Draco’s grey eyes couldn’t focus on Harry, the man was obviously concussed.

Harry’s house was fucking freezing, so he looked through a pile of washing and found one of Harry’s giant hoodies and pulled it on over his head. It smelt wonderful. He pulled the soft material up to his nose to breathe in the aroma that was so unapologetically Harry.
“Mr Potter, I didn’t know we had an appointment”.” Barnabas Cuffe said with surprise as Harry entered his office.
Jacob lay him down on the bed and started to take of his shoes, then his top and his trousers. Draco felt to weak to protest. “Everything going to be okay,
“You were beaten up pretty badly, Malfoy. I saw from my window and came and rescued you, Damsel. I had to put you in my bed because the guest rooms are being remodelled, and your clothes were drenched so I put you in one of my T-shirt’s. Hermione came and healed all of your injuries, so you probably don’t have a single mark on you. You’re welcome to leave if I’ve somehow offended you.” And with that, he got up and left to shower.
Harry stopped still when he entered the gardens. There, standing by the fountain was a blonde, with sparkling grey eyes. He was the spitting image of Drakon, only without the wings. He’d obviously made a noise when he’d entered, the wound man turned around and looked at him with a startled glance. Harry willed himself to move forward.
“Well, actually darling that suit you are wearing is very up to my standards.” Draco purred, winking at his love.
He leaned down and grasped Draco’s throat in the palm of his hand, which caused the boy to gasp and for his eyes to fly open. “I want to hear you say it.” Draco groaned again as his prostate was hit over and over again. “You’re right, God you’re right all I want is your big fucking cock inside my ass!” Hearing those dirty words pour out of Draco’s pretty mouth was enough to send Harry over the edge.
The blonde lifted his head up shakily, his grey eyes puffy from crying. “Ha-Harry has a new girlfriend” he stuttered, wiping his nose with his sleeve. Ron frowned, before stepping closer and joining the blonde on his sofa.
Harry’s scent was still all over his apartment, he still even had a box of his stuff in Draco’s living room.
He was going to be sick. Jacob was pinning him down to the bed and Draco was far too drunk and weak to move him off. “Jacob,
Thak you for reading! Hopefully this made sense and you were able to enjoy it, I always struggle with endings but I hope this one was satisfactory. I know people may have a few issues with this, they on't have a perfect relationship and I genuinely believe Drarry would have rather a dysfunctional relationship, but still love each other. Draco is not forcing Harry out, it is quite common for gay people to refuse to come out out of shame or fear of judgement, but Harry was not in any danger if he were to came out so it was what needed to happen.

“What do you think the man you’re talking about will think when he reads this? How will he feel?”
Prompt: "If you can't sleep, we could have sex?"
She smirked at him before sitting back, knowing she now had the upper hand. “About 20 minutes ago, when Ginny asked him if they could get back together. He’s probably still in the Great Hall now”.
“Sorry to interrupt”. Came a voice from the doorway. There, in all of her glory, stood Narcissa Malfoy. She smiled at her sons as they noticed her presence.
He sent sparks into the fire and rushed the angel to his sofa. Harry didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t well send an owl down to Ron and Hermione, it would never survive in this weather. The man started to groan in his sleep and Harry rushed to his knees at the side of his head. “Are you alright? Can you understand me?” He was full of nerves but the man didn’t scare him, not one bit. The man blinked, and Harry was taken aback by his shining grey eyes.
“I’m so happy you’re here”. Harry said happily as his best friend pulled him into a hug. “So am I, mate. I want you there when we have kids”. Harry couldn’t stop smiling.
Harry walked into the living room to wait for his boyfriend, petting their Persian cat while he waited. Minnie (the cat) was a beautiful grey colour and was the queen of their house, her human parents had rescued her when she was only a kitten, abandoned in a rotting cardboard box. She was completely doted on by both of them, but she loved them both dearly.
Harry knocked on the door and heard a muffled yell from Seamus. “Come in!” Harry watched as Seamus hastened to cover himself. “Alright, Harry?” He said with a flustered face. Harry smirked at him. “Yeah, I just need my Defence notes back”
Draco was upset. Harry was ignoring him, and he had no idea why. It was his birthday for Christ’s sake! They’d been together for 4 years now, Draco was turning 24 but got nothing but a grunt this morning from his boyfriend before he’d flooed without even kissing Draco goodbye. Truth be told it made him feel quite insecure, but he ignored it, hoping it would be resolved.
“Being like what? You left me, remember.” He snarled.
He pulled his want out as he made his way through his flat to his living room and froze when he saw who was sat on his sofa.
.” Draco tried to control his breathing but it was shaken and came out in gasps. Harry scooped Draco up into his arms and Draco’s legs wrapped around his waist almost instinctively.
“Might do” he replied heartily.

“Draco?! Draco where are you?!” A distraughtly ruffled Harry paced into the living room and sighed in relief when he spotted Draco. “I was worried, what are you doing?” He frowned at the sight of Draco’s mainly dressed form.
“Ginny and Neville will be here any minute to pick him up, darling, so now’s the time to say goodbye” Harry let out a sigh at his words.
have gone a little overboard with them. Shrug.
The blonde moved shiftily and sat down with a sigh in the opposite chair, not looking at Harry.
Non con scene. Lots of emotions.
Draco picked up the newspaper from his lap and shook it out, before starting to read the front cover.
“Oh gods, gods that’s good!” Draco sang, riding Harry’s fingers. “You’re so fucking tight, not let anyone else have you since, have you?” Harry questioned. This time it was Draco’s time to smirk. “You really think I have some sort of loyalty to you? I go out clubbing every weekend, I wake up in a new bed, every weekend, Potter. God you’re ridiculous”. And Draco started laughing at him, truly laughing.
Harry thrust into him in one go, both of them moaning in ecstasy, whispering i love you’s to each other through moans.
“I’m coming! I’m coming!” He yelled to the incessant knocker, who continued regardless. When he opened the door he was surprised to find the saviour of the wizarding world, absolutely sloshed, on his front door step.
Harry really couldn’t help but laugh, which seemed to only further frustrate Draco. “You think I care about “virgin purity?” I may not be a “whorehouse” like you, but I myself am no virgin”.
“Not until you tell me why we aren’t friends anymore! I thought we were getting on!” Harry could see the tears edging into Draco’s eyes.
Draco on the other hand was still slim, but had a small gut on him from Harry’s delicious cooking. He felt so blessed every day to have the man as his husband. His blonde hair was now silver, but as luscious and voluptuous as ever.
Fuck is such a rough word. But Draco couldn’t call what they did “making love” as it wasn’t love. It was just sex. Just sex.
Saturday.
“So” Draco sighed.
Just as he was about to reply with a snappy rejection, he saw Potter over the Ravenclaw’s shoulder and a wicked grin enticed his face. “You have Saturday to make it up to me, Darling. I look forward to it.” With a quick glance over to the now staring Gryffindor, he pushed his lips against the Ravenclaws who greeted him with suprise but obvious pleasure. “I can’t wait” Jacob winked at him before making his exit with a skip in his step.
“Only in this life”. Harry’s magic was pushing him towards the angel and then, they were kissing. And it was like he was in the clouds, he could feel every fibre of his body screaming out in ecstasy. He lifted the angel up into his arms, minding not to touch the hurt wing. He lead them upstairs, all while never taking his lips off of Drakon’s.
Someone had sent a paralysing hex at him which, Harry knew from his work as an hour was putting Draco in immense pain.
“Master Draco would like you to know that he is very unhappy to stay-“ he was interrupted by a crash from inside Harry’s rooms, “and would like to be let home- immediately”.
The Slytherin took that as his sign to leave and turned to leave to the common room.
He ended with another extreme bow before spinning on his heel back into the line, smiling sweetly up at Harry.
“Ah, Mr Potter”. The headmistress greeted him, smiling curtly. “Mrs Malfoy is upstairs waiting for you, I have some other business to tend to at the moment. Your teachers have been notified that for the next few days you may not be in lesson, as the Ministry would like you to take a statement tomorrow, alright?” He nodded and thanked her before making his way up the spiralled staircase.
At that moment Harry strolled in for breakfast and was swept right into the arms of the female Weasley. Draco tried no to look up but couldn’t help it, and when he did he found the emerald eyes already boring into him. He couldn’t stand it. He was going to make Potter regret not choosing him.
Harry grasped at Draco’s blonde locks and tugged hard in his gaze of pleasure. “Fuck, I’m so close” he went to pull Draco away but the blonde stayed firmly in place, ready to take Harry’s cum.
He’d heard two of the nurses talking about his mother coming in from France, he was far too unstable to cope with her too but he was relieved to know she cared. Jacob had been taken to St Mungo’s with an oxygen charm coating his chest. He could’ve died- still might. What would happen to Harry then? He didn’t care. Yes he did. But this, this was the final stop. He was done with Harry Potter, the man who’d roared at the sight of someone else touching him. Grief is the price we must pay for love, and Draco had to bury his feelings.
“Ride me” Harry groaned as they broke away from the kiss. Draco nodded and summoned some lube, coating Harry’s thick fingers in the slime.
“Yes! Yes I’ll be your stupid fucking bride and take it like a bitch for you, please just give me more!” He screamed. Harry sucked at his neck and smiled. “Oh you will indeed take it, sweet”. He moved his hands off of Draco’s reddened cock, causing the blonde to let out a whine.
“And who exactly am I marrying?”
His friend moved away from him and towards the bathroom. “Have fun, but please, for the love of all things Slytherin don’t fuck him in here”. Draco threw his head back as he laughed. “I promise. Does this mean you’re over me now?” Blaise turned to him. “I’ll never be over you, Darling, but I have found a rather delicious 6th year Gryffindor to sedate my needs” Draco mocked insult. “Blaise Zambini! We do not do Gryffindors” He chuckled. “I know, I know, but she’s a right little sort and the sex is good”.
“Look at me, and tell me what I did wrong, please.” Draco couldn’t bear looking at the pleading sadness in Harry’s eyes.
“Shut the fuck up, I don’t want to fucking look at you. bend over.” The auror’s harsh words sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. Why the fuck did being treated like just a fuck toy to Harry turn him on so much?
” He started to shout but a hand clasped over his mouth and he felt his eyes start to close once again. “
The whole school was now buzzing with the news of his antics. It’d been midnight but the whole school was awake- many of the 8th years still in the common room had heard the commotion and come up to see what was happening, and then a load of the 8th years had come back from the party. He could still hear Pansy’s scream ringing in his ears at the sight of Jacob’s bloodied face.
“Remember how you screamed, you know. Think about it most nights, very late at night, when I can’t sleep.” Harry growled into the shivering mans ear, putting himself on top of Draco.
“I told her, Ginny, that I’m with you. She told me to stop being an idiot and come and find you, to tell you how I feel. And Draco, I love you, these past months-“ Draco's eyes went wide, frowning at the man on his doorstep.
Harry let out a laugh and shook his head. “God, could you imagine? Good thing we won’t be having another one any time soon, James is barely a year-“ Harry stopped and looked at Draco’s unchaining face.
“Harry Potter is gay”. Pansy whispered, her entire body buzzing with excitement.
“Draco, you’re awake!” He smiled sheepishly up at the blonde before sitting up to stretch. “Would you mind explaining to me as to why I woke up in your bed?” His tone was rather accusing but Harry wasn’t in the mood to take offence.
“Oh right, yeah they’re on the desk over there.” Harry chuckled and the shuffling in the Irish boy’s bed. “Thanks, mate” Harry said as he turned back to him.
The wings in question were magnificent. They were white, smooth like silk and glittering in the rainfall. He scooped the man up into his arms and the wings traipsed over Harry’s arm.
He was abruptly interrupted from his thoughts by a sharp elbow from Pansy, which caused him to put down his now cold toast and turn to her. “What do you want you bint?” She just nodded towards the ruffled looking Gryffindor who was approaching them.
Draco moved softly onto Harry’s lap, slowly lifting himself onto Harry’s hard cock. The other man ran his hands up and down Draco’s thighs as they both sighed at the pleasure of their bodies connecting.
was all Harry could see. It was probably all Jacob could see too, the amount of times he’d crushed his fist into his face. He wouldn’t be so pretty anymore. It had taken Ron, Seamus
Draco had still thought he had taken charge right up until the moment Harry threw him over into his back and ripped off his clothes, pinning him to the bed. “I love seeing you in my clothes, fuck, I’m obsessed with you.” He grabbed at Draco’s arse and devoured his neck.
“Will you marry me?” Harry keened, his eyes full of desperate wanting. Draco giggled, rutting against his admirer.
Harry dropped his cutlery. “When was this?” Ron shook his head as he continued to eat. “Dunno. They found him just after first period so I assume it happened pretty early on” Ron paused and looked at Harry dead on. “Why?” Harry just shook his head and got up, his body jittering. “I’ll see you later mate, let Hermione know I’m on for scrabble tonight”. Ron nodded. Harry raced out of the room and raced down the halls, pushing past people and possibly knocking over some first years.
“You’re a little whore for me, aren’t you, Malfoy?” The Slytherin grinned and nodded his head.
“I have something else you might like to eat”. Draco purred seductively. Harry raised his eyes brow and him. “I happen to be wearing the very sexy underwear a certain gryffindor bought me a few weeks ago, and-“ Another unfinished sentence. Harry attacked Draco’s mouth as he carried him into their bedroom before vanishing their clothes.
I miss how his cheeks would flush when I kissed him or told him that he was handsome, I miss dancing around his kitchen to terrible Celestine songs.
This is the eighth work in my Drarry Drabbles Collection. Link to it on
Finally they were alone again, Draco thought, as he curled up into his lovers arms. Harry had barely left his side, but there had always been someone else they had to deal with too. Not that Draco minded, but as Harry pulled him close and kissed his forehead, he was pleased to be on their own. He had never been happier in his life, and for that, he was grateful.
1 month later-
He didn’t want it to end, he didn’t, he knew he didn’t, but Draco couldn’t bear having the most amazing sex with Potter, and then watch him walk right back to the Weaslette and hate him once more. He was
“I had a go at him for ignoring me, but I guess that was me actually being mad that it had ended, and then he was shouting about me getting back with Ginny, and then, well I’m not sure but it ended with me saying I wanted him back and him saying he doesn’t want me back”.
He grabbed his arm and tried to pull him into him but Harry pushed him away.
Just as they were preparing for another round, their was a brisk knock on the door, and both men were far too absorbed in each other to react before the door opened.
“Isn’t she the most perfect thing!” cried Pansy, ecstatic with joy.
The time neared 8 o’clock when Draco had just finished getting changed. He looked irresistible, and he knew it. The shirt showed of his sharp figure, and the tight muggle jeans (Dolce and Gabbana mind) shaped his assets quite nicely. Just as he was ready to leave, Blaise entered their dorm.
“I know, I am sorry gorgeous.” Harry leant forward with a smile and kissed Draco softly on the lips. “Mmm, Harry. What day is it?” Harry chuckled as Draco wrapped his arms around him, clinging to his sides with his legs. “Doesn’t matter, I’m taking the day off”. He kissed Draco’s cheek, then moved to leave butterfly kisses across the rest of Draco’s face, making them both laugh. “Stop it you tosser”. Harry shook his head. “I’ll never stop kissing you”. Draco put his hand on the side of Harry’s face to kiss him, deeply.

“Draco? Draco wake up”.
“Hey, Ginny, are you almost ready to go?” Harry paced around his rooms as he waited for his girlfriend to come out of the bathroom. They were going to Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione and at this rate they were going to be late. When she finally came out of the bathroom he couldn’t deny she looked stunning. “How do I look?” She asked him with a bright smile. He smiled back at her as he held out his hand. “Stunning, Gin. Now come on or we’ll be late!” She grabbed his hand and they made their way down to the main entrance to meet Ron and Hermione.
Just as he had pushed his way out of the club and was pulling in lungfuls of air, he felt two burly arms pull him into an alleyway, and he knew he was done for.
“Does she know you kiss her with the same mouth you ate my arse with?”
then, I have someone I’m meant to be entertaining.”
“Come for me”  The blonde complied, splattering all over Harry’s and his own chest. A few thrusts later and Harry’s was joining him, emptying himself out into Draco. “God, we haven’t had sex like that in a while. Now, I’d suggest you take a nap while I’m in the shower, because I’ll be ready to fuck you again soon.” Draco nodded and rolled himself into Harry’s sheets, eyes closing almost instantly.
“Alright. It’s a deal, Potter.”
It was nearing midnight when he finally got into bed, and there was a soft knock at his door.
afterwards, but you’ll never choose me. I am done, with you Potter, alright? I won’t let you
Harry hung his head, looking down at Draco through his lashes. “I should have come back for you sooner, and I’m sorry, Draco. Truly. I just hope you’re willing to give me another chance?”
“I take potions to stop this happening.
He paced over to his mirror to
Harry took a deep breath before continuing.
Within seconds harry was throwing his head back and panting. “Merlin that mouth is talented, do you like the taste of yourself on my cock?” Draco couldn’t reply as Harry shoved his head down further on his dick.
Draco made his way over to his own oak desk just as Blaise clicked the lock on their en suite door. Draco froze at the sight of the cursive scripture he had read so many times before. With a stiff hand he reached forward to grasp it between his two fingers. It was from his father.
Harry looked at him cruelly and laughed.
Side note- if you’re early to this update I’ll be editing the last chapter’s italics just after posting this so wait a while okay! Love you all <3
“Lay back and lift your legs up, I wanna eat you” Draco gasped at Harry’s brash words, but complied. “Merlin this arse is taking over my life.” Draco gave him a sultry knowing look. “What?” Harry asked curiously. “Nothing you’d want to hear, now get on with it”.
“Malfoy, we need to talk. It’s important so I don’t want any back chat.” Draco’s mouth soured at being spoken to like a child. “Fine. But not now, Potter. Unlike the rest of the wizarding world I’m not
Hermione gasped and Ron groaned.
But Ginny had come back from travelling in Europe with her quidditch team, and Harry and Draco had split up, so of course they had just, gotten back together.
Hi guys I’m sorry for taking so long to update- school is hectic as hell right now. I’ll be honest with you, the writing in this is atrocious and I’m ashamed I’m having to release it but I hope you can forgive me. I don’t want to spoil the story but I must remind you that the next chapter contains attempted rape- and shit starts to get really tense between our two boys, but it also starts to get sorted out. Hopefully release the new chapter on Saturday or Sunday. Love you all <33
Draco finally looked up at Harry who looked so concerned and ashamed. He hadn’t meant to react how he did but he couldn’t help but cry. “I’m so, so sorry Draco. I didn’t mean to make your day bad, I’m sorry I made you feel neglected”. Draco shook his head and stepped away from his boyfriend. “You know how bad my anxiety gets, Harry. And you still thought it was a good idea”. He said shakily. Harry tried to get close to his boyfriend but Draco kept stepping away.
“Um, I came to get the rest of my stuff”.  Draco pointed to the box in the corner.
Harry was impossibly hard and far too impatient do deal with buttons and flies. He vanished both of their clothes off into one corner of the room and reached for the jar of lube he kept in his bedside draw.
“Yes, although I’ve tried to convince myself otherwise at times, I am. And that is something I should be proud of, rather than trying to hide away”.
Being named the Saviour had meant that Harry hadn’t had to share with anyone else, and had a double room to himself. Draco’s room also happened to be right above Harry’s so it never looked suspicious when they walked down to the common room, even if they did look
Draco finally turned to look at him and his expression was stony, his eyes squinted at Harry.
“Oh we
Dinner was silent. The only noises that could be heard were of their food being moved around the plate, and occasionally lifted to a mouth. The tension between them was thick enough to be cut through.
He turned back to Harry, who had gone very quiet. “Thank you”. He smiled. The Gryffindor’s face broke into a grin.
” He spat his words at a grief stricken Harry who just wanted to stay next to him. He could feel his heart shatter at each word. The tears down his lover’s face were what convinced him to leave, turning his back on Draco’s weeping. “I have
His fingers trailed over his chest, the line of hickeys from the night before still clearly visible. He reached up to his collar bone where they started, and reached down to the waistband of his joggers where they ended. He smirked, oh yes, Draco would know
Harry took a deep breath.
“So I’m alright to tell Monty to go ahead and plan the wedding?” Draco nodded and shifted onto Harry’s lap.
“Draco-“
Hi. I am SO sorry for abandoning this fic and not updating. I lost all the chapters I had written for this fic and I couldn’t bring myself to write new ones, but the comments, kudos and hits made me want to write again, and I’m so much more proud of this fic than my first disaster fic, and i want it to BE something. This chapter is really short but I’m adding another one too so please don’t worry, I’m going to try and keep writing this fic. Drunk me last night outlined the whole thing so we’ll see where this goes...
“I want to write an article for your newspaper”.
“Thank you, Justin. Please step forward”. He pointed to the second man.
“Do you remember what it feels like to have my cock inside of you?”
.” Draco’s breath quickened as he was shoved up against the wall. He wouldn’t agree to it. He wouldn’t wouldn’t wouldn’t.
“It’s not enough for just him to know you love him”. Her expression never broke but he saw an intensity in her eyes.
Harry stayed standing up.
“God your ass is magic, fuck, Draco!” The blonde could feel he was going to cum and tensed up around Harry’s huge member. He felt himself pressed further into the stress as Harry sped up his thrusts.
He paused and went to sit down in his living room, pointing at the opposite chair, indicating Draco should move too.
Draco sighed and rolled his head back against the headboard.
Draco smiled, which caused Harry to blush. “Well, I do have my eye on a rather dashing 6th year Ravenclaw, who’ll be able to top
“You should go and speak to him, Draco.”
He turned back to look at the television, his breathing slightly heavier.
Harry’s movements stilled behind Draco, both of them panting to catch their breath. The tension was like static between the unlikely lovers. If you could call them that. Slowly, Harry removed himself from the other man with a mutual hiss.
When Harry entered his rooms almost everything was out of place, and a very red faced blonde was staring at him.
He meant forward and kissed Harry hungrily, who tried desperately to pull him in, but the angel refused.
Draco made sure he was downstairs early for breakfast. He was going to avoid Potter and he’d be damned if he ever let the boy so much as breathe close to him never mind fuck him.
Dinner with his family was always good fun, Hermione had been staying with Ron and the other Weasley’s and they’d obviously had a great summer, the love they had for eachother practically
The arms pushed him up against the wall and his attackers leg pushed between his thighs, he closed his eyes as he felt sharp stubble against his neck.

Based off of a prompt ask for Ministry gala. No smut.

who the bite marks belonged to.
He didn’t sleep that night. Harry’s words kept spinning around in his head, barely a whisper that meant so much and so little all at once.
“Ótan eímaste kai páli mazí”. And with that, he was gone, vanished into thin airC, leaving a rather dazed Harry in his wake.
“I don’t want anyone else touching you” the raven haired boy growled into his ear. “You’re
Draco wondered if she was on her way to see Harry. His heart twinged. Then it really started to hurt, it was so overwhelming emotionally, it started to hurt physically. The next thing he knew he fell down onto the floor, gasping for air and clutching at his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco turned over into his back and watched at Harry lifted his backside on to a pillow. “You’re so tight and gorgeous beautiful, even though you’re old now”. Harry chuckled. Draco pretended to be offended and and slapped the back of Harry’s head. “Less talking, more-“
“What, after two years of marriage is sex off the table? Am I not good enough for you anymore, Potter? Harry joked.
Jacob, was the 6th year Ravenclaw whom Draco had set his sights on. He looked quite similar to his cousin but his skin was a darker and his hair was thicker and longer than Blaise’s. All in all, he was gorgeous.
“You mean we’re having another baby? Oh Draco you really are incredible!” He knealt down and kissed at his husbands stomach, rubbing it adoringly.
He was sure the Gryffindor let out a groan as he got under the covers, but he turned away from him for good measure.
“The fuck did you just say?” His voice was gruff with anger.
Blaise chuckled. "I’ve got to get up for work, and you’ve got to stop feeling sorry for yourself. You haven’t even looked at today’s paper”.

“YOU DON’T HAVE TO GO! YOU CAN’T, IT’S TOO DANGEROUS! WHAT IF THIS TIME, IT’S THE TIME YOU DON’T COME BACK TO ME?” He was trying to force the tears back, but to no avail.
“Draco? Draco?” Jacobs hand waving in front of his face snapped him out of his thoughts, he’d been thinking about Harry, obviously. But also Ginny. He realised now that he would never be anything more than a filthy little secret to Harry and now his heart was breaking. “Sorry, what were you saying?” Jacob rolled his eyes. “I was asking if you’d like to go back up to the castle now? Before it gets too late.” Draco nodded and they arose- he snuck a quick glance over to the Gryffindor who was laughing at a joke She had told. He turned his face away and busied himself picking up his bags and put on his coat.
“No, fuck you, Malfoy, why’d you have to go an ruin us?” Harry had pressed himself against Draco now, forcing the blonde to look up at him.
Between fierce kisses they managed to make it over to the bed, where Harry pushed them both down into the sheets. They scrambled at each other’s and their own clothes, desperate to be closer to one another.
“I guess we should get back together then, what do you say Gin?” He stuttered over every word. She nodded and smiled sheepishly. He realised he’d been holding his breath when the table erupted into cheers and clapping. The  crowd moved into the living room, but Harry was quickly pulled into the stairwell by flowing ginger hair.
“What?” She replied, almost accusingly.
When Harry’s fingers breached him, he couldn’t help but scream at how good it felt, how good this felt. “Daddy please, oh God” Harry just kissed him, working a third finger into him, stretching him out after so long. “Baby, are you sure about this? You’re ready?” Draco looked him in the eyes and nodded.

“Babe, why don’t you tell our friends everything you love about me?” He asked, innocently enough, knowing Draco was tortured by the question. “Of course, babe. I love the way you treat me, show me just how much you care about me. And I love how confident you are, despite everything, and I absolutely love my ring, it’s not tacky at all!” Draco exclaimed, voice sickly sweet and paired with a shit eating grin.
He’s apologised for the way he behaved, how stupid he’d been. And then Harry was apologising for not saving Draco, taking him with him when they had escaped the Manor. Draco couldn’t remember who had moved first but they were then wrapped up in eachother, and they’d apparated to his room.
Harry spent Thursday and Friday afternoon in a foggy state. His mind, once again, was everywhere and nowhere at the same time; he felt lost. He had loved Ginny for some time, he knew that. But it was the first time he was letting himself think about how he felt about Malfoy. How he really felt. Kissing Ginny felt like nothing compared to Draco- who made sparks fly. He couldn’t leave Ginny, not after everything that had happened, and was was expected of them. Besides, it’s not as if he could come out even if he wanted to. The wizarding world was still very prejudiced, and Harry didn’t feel that they could accept a queer golden boy, as it would make him seem a whole lot less golden.
“No, little one, she has to sleep in her crib for now” Harry told him as he lifted the boy out of their bed. James curled himself around his father, already falling asleep. Draco kissed his son’s forehead before standing up himself to lay their new born in her crib.
“So tight, oh so tight!” Harry grunted into his husbands neck, as he pounded into Draco, who was moaning uncontrollably underneath him. Neither of them would last long, Harry could already feel Draco clenching around him, and his own thrusts were speeding up, Draco’s legs hitching higher over his shoulders.
No. He wouldn’t let him. He’d right in, give the proposition, and leave. He took a deep breath as he reached the door and knocked briskly.

“Oh it is a little bit, to be honest I’d expect no one less”.
Harry, I’m alright, calm down!” Draco reassured him. Harry sat down on the bed and Draco climbed in to his lap. “I’m so sorry, Draco”. He wrapped his arms around his boyfriend tightly. “don’t blame yourself, I love you”. He kissed all over Harry’s faced and started to kiss his neck.
Other than raising his eyebrows at Harry’s unexpected arrival, Draco’s expression remained unchanged at Harry’s arrival.
Harry felt exhausted. Was it really
Draco picked up the frame to inspect the picture more closely. He could see faint lines on the photo from where a reparo had been used to fix the tears. The photo didn’t move anymore, now it was still like a muggle had taken it, the picture had obviously frozen at the point where Harry had kissed Draco. Happiness filled the faces of their passed selves, who probably had no idea what would come mere weeks later.
