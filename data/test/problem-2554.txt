"But Dad!"
"Do you ever wonder what happened to some people after the war?" Her tone was light and careless, but since I've known Hermione Granger for more than a decade now, I knew there was something behind the casual words.
"Fine! It's not as if I want your degenerated inbred sperm, anyway," Harry shouted, red in the face and something burning behind his eyes. Then he Apparated home on the spot.
Harry darkened. "Never will I send a child to bed hungry. Never."
"No fucking way," Harry exclaimed. "I couldn't stand him in school, and he's still an arsehole, as I see it."
Harry took a deep breath and lowered his mouth on the tip of Malfoy's cock and took it in as long as he could. As he gagged a little, he released it again and licked the tip free of pre-cum, the unfamiliar bitter taste filling his mouth. He licked and kissed the silky side of it down to the balls. They were beautiful too. Everything about Malfoy was bloody beautiful and smooth and tasteful. He gently licked his balls as well, and felt his own erection striving to be freed and noticed. He shifted a bit and loosened his right hand from Malfoy's hip and took his own cock in his hand. He resumed to sucking Malfoy's shaft, taking it deeper into his throat and ignoring the gagging reflexes. In a daze, he heard Malfoy's voice, unsteady and breathless, "That's right... Oh, Heavens, yes… So good… Yes…"
Harry just sat there, his arm still stretched out and his glasses a little bit askew. Finally, he lowered his arm and nodded. "We're gonna have a baby, Malfoy," he said. The thought suddenly felt so wierd, so unrealistic, so totally preposterous now that it had happened, that Harry started laughing. He tossed away his glasses and laughed and laughed, tears formed in his eyes and he rolled around in the bed, gasping for air.
Of course, it was Millie bloody Bulstrode who ruined a perfectly fine game of Spin the Bottle, held in the best spirit of House-unity, by shouting, "I'm not kissing any fucking boy!" and thus got everyone thinking and debating… alternative sexual preferences.
"Scorp's dad says it's okay and he'll see even less of him since Scorp has to go to stay with his mum after. All the other boys in our year will be there, and we're gonna have sleeping bags and cake and a fly in the park and..."
"Are you sure, Mr Malfoy?" She seemed reluctant to leave, but tiredness was evident in her eyes.
"Quite sure." He gave her a tender smile. "Go home." He turned to Harry as she closed the door behind her, "She's an absolute gem. I don't know what I'd do without her in this Muggle world." He opened the food cartons and peered inside to identify their orders before handing Harry's over to him.
"Yes."
"I thought you might wanted to know." Potter shuddered his shoulders. "Since I just had the shittiest Christmas-leave ever."
"I need all the help I can get." Harry almost held his breath. This was unexpected. "Would you like to? I'd be very greatful."
The dungeon courtroom was packed to the last row and still more people tried to get inside, pushing in, filling the steps and every empty space available. A large group of reporters and photographers were packed in at the front row, bustling and elbowing oneanother to get the best angles. The noise was overwhelming.
"Nice party, Potter." Harry could hear the smirk in his voice. "Do you all drink like this after every catch you make?"
"No, I just wanted you to know. And I want you to come to the bloody party with me. They're all there, you know, waiting for you. Molly and Andromeda has cooked for days, it seems. There's a big buffet table in the garden under the cherry-trees. Luna has decorated, so don't be surprised when you find carrots on rows among the fairy-lights."
Malfoy bit and sucked at the pulse-point right under Harry's ear, scratching his skin with the light stubble on his chin. He mumbled something incoherent, and the low timber of his voice, the constant teasing of that spot inside, the slapping sound of sweaty skin against skin, the rhythm of Malfoy's cock slamming into him, again and again, was all too much. Harry squeezed the head of his cock and came with a cry. He pressed up at Malfoy's chest and trembled as he pulsed out ropes and ropes of cum between them. Malfoy stilled and shook, and with one last thrust he orgasmed and filled Harry with his release.
"I Apparated away only minutes ago. I have no desire to go back to them right now, thank you very much," Malfoy snorted.
Draco dropped his quill. "What?"
Harry hesitated, but when Hermione smacked Ron to get him to shuffle over and there was room at her side, he climbed in.
Draco had never been any good at deception. His father used to exel in how to never reveal his true feelings, and had worked hard at instructing Draco to never show anything but superiority and confidance, the traits of a true Malfoy. In the past, before everything went to shit, Draco had tried, even when he felt insecure and out of his league.
"That woman is pure evil! Astoria is my former fiancée, for Merlin's sake. I'll have to go over and talk to her."
"You're free?"
He was only in his underwear and with his t-shirt half-way over his head, when the curtain was yanked open. "Not bad, not bad at all, Draco. Wherever did you find him? Buried out on the Wiltshire moors?"
"What is this strange Muggle currency you've been handing out?" He was fingering Harry's Master Card. "I've seen Muggle money before, you know, and it looks nothing like this."
"Well," Draco said and cleared his voice. "Maybe it's time for us to step down, give the new students the oppotunity to shine. I've thought about quitting the team, already,  with the NEWTs coming up and everything." He paused and added more softly. "I only joined because you did. That was always the fun part of Quidditch, chasing you. Maybe it's time for us to grow up."
The last time he'd met Malfoy, before seeing him at Platform 9 3/4, was at the trials after the war. Then he had looked scared and lost, a sickly pale boy with wide frightened eyes. Harry didn't quite know what to think when he looked at him now, the grown man.
"Are you all right?" Harry Potter asked with a frown. He was alone and not accompanied by his sidekicks for once, and the corridor was empty but for the disappearing group of students that were scoffing and sniggering, proud of their successful prank. He turned his head after them, "I saw they draw a wand at you."
"All right, if you say so." She folded her notepad and put down her quill with a frown. This patient of hers was an enigma; he opened up easily on a lot of things and stubbornly clammed up on so many others. "You know," she started tentatively, "I can't say for sure, but it might be a way for you to move on. You could at least explore the posibilities, think about it. If you like, I can make an appointment for you with an Obstetrician Healer. One of the best happens to be a friend of mine."
Harry shook off Malfoy's grip and put his chin out. "As a matter of facts, I didn't really. You
Harry shook, for various reasons. Anger, guilt, shame and weariness ripped through him. But before any of them could say or do anything more, he withdrew his wand from Malfoy's neck and Disapparated. It was only pure luck he didn't splinch himself.
"Helping you to relax. You don't have to clamp up and endure until I'm finished, you know. I could make this feel good for you too, if you want me to. So, spread your legs a bit more." Malfoy's voice sounded muffled and once more he made a wet track with his tongue along Harry's perineum up to that most intimate sensitive place.
"I really don't know why I suddenly fainted," he concluded after finishing the story. "I've felt just fine up to that point and I feel just fine now again."
"Oh, piss off, Zabini," Draco snarled. "It's a party, isn't it? You're supposed to drink and have fun at a party, aren't you?"
"He's over here," she said. And he was.
"Do you recall what happened?" Malfoy chuckled. "You sort of came out last night, Potter. Are you aware of that?"
Harry wished he could have his Invisibility Cloak on. Now there was nothing to hide him from having his picture taken, again and again. He could leave, he had already given his testimony. He didn't need to be there, yet he stayed. It was the last day of the trials against the Malfoys and today the verdict would fall.
There was a surprisingly homey atmosphere in the room. The colours on the walls and the furniture were all modern, and it clashed boldly against the high windows and the stucco decorated ceiling.
"It's a 'Coming Out-shirt'," Seamus crowed and waved another over his head. "We got a whole box, charmed and ready, for everyone who wants them."
Harry grinned sheepishly, red all over now. "Well, maybe I got a bit of help with that too."
"Ages ago, end of September, I think." Weasley turned to the girl for confirmation. Granger nodded and chewed on her lip. "Surely that can't still be in his system?" she asked. "I mean, it's been more than two months since that happened. And it wasn't funny at all," she spat at Weasley, who still grunted a laugh.
Harry put the book down and finally looked at her. Her eyes were sad, her warm brown eyes, usually so full of spite. He had always loved the way her eyes sparkled of life. "I didn't know what to tell him. Do you?" Ginny asked, apparently fighting to keep her voice steady.
She fell silent.
"Things will wrap up soon, anyway. It's a weekday after all. Most of us have school and work tomorrow." Harry bit his lip, but he still asked. "Can I come with you?" Draco only nodded, but Harry felt a great weight lift.
"This is one of my favourite places in London," he said as they climbed to the entrace hall. Harry had waited right at the gates, unsure if they were going inside the large building at all, but Malfoy immediately started to ascend the stairs with long strides.
As in Bisexual? Meaning its okay to like both?
The man at the desk raised his head as Harry opened the door. He was dressed in a perfectly fitted dark grey Muggle suit and the platinum blond hair was neatly cropped at the neck, with a few long strands falling over his eyes. Harry gasped. "Draco Malfoy?"
"I was
"Harry broke Malfoy's nose."
"I wasn't sure. Anyway, are you sure you want to see me?"
done all those things and said what he'd said. He had stomped on Harry's nose, bullied his friends, tried to kill Dumbledore, and been a cruel spoilt brat through all their years together.
Harry stood, a little unsteady and cast him a dark glare. "I don't know of what filth your mind is made of, Zabini," he growled, "but I don't have to stay here and listen to your insults." His heart throbbed at a crazy speed and rivulets of panic clashed up and down his spine, leaving cold sweat in its wake. "Our sons happens to like one another, that's all. I wouldn't go near this place if Al hadn't nagged us about it until he was blue in the face."
They had all been so supporting and understanding, even the Slytherins. Pansy had hugged him until it almost hurt and had said, "If you don't make me Godmother of the little brat, I'll hex your balls off, Harry Potter. I want to spoil this baby rotten."
"You're here, aren't you? What do you want, Potter?"
"So, you want to be with him, is that it? If that is so, why aren't you already?" Ginny's eyes pierced Harry's again.
"It will do perfectly. Who's the writer?"
"Not tonight, Harry. I'm not in the mood."
Potter shook his head vigorously. "Me? Never. You gave me some Dreamless Sleep after... you know, and I've had some more prescriptions during the summer, but nothing since then."
He looked at his wristwatch (a muggle one, in gold) and got up. "I have to get on stage," he said. "Why don't you stay the whole show for once, and we could have a drink together after?"
"You could have done that," Harry beamed. "I don't think I would've minded."
"Perfectly," Flint said. "I'll take little Warrington home as well. He's having a bit of a hard time right now, poor kid." He muttered conspiratorial to Harry, "His mum's just run off with another witch, can you imagine?" He chuckled and winked at Harry. "Pretty disgusting, if you ask me." Harry felt his throat go dry and coughed in his fist.
"Justin, Terry, Michael and Anthony," Ron said, "all very nice guys, but half-bloods or Muggle-decendants, all of them. Ernie MacMillan's pureblood, but last I heard, he was somewhere in America." He sighed and scratched his red hair. "You can't think of anyone you've made friends with in the Auror-corps, I suppose?"
Everything went black. Harry felt his heart's rapid beat in his brain and he couldn't breathe. He was on the floor, gasping for air.
"Here," he said and stroke his fingers over her wet face. "You're safe to cry here. I won't tell." He tried to express himself so she'd understand that he knew how she felt. "I guess it must've come as a shock to you, him liking blokes."
"Please, Malfoy. Please, fuck me harder and faster." That was it, now he had lost that last bit of self-esteem and Malfoy would mock him for it for the rest of his life. But Malfoy put his hand on Harry's sadly neglected cock and started stroking it while fucking him with more determination a nd speed, every stroke nudging and rubbing Harry's gland. Sweat from his torso was dripping down on Harry's back and his hot breath tickled the hair at Harry's neck. Harry could feel his orgasm building, and his arms were shaking and his knees were wobbling, and Malfoy pushed and pushed, and then he murmured in Harry's ear, "Come for me, Potter. You can do it." And Harry did.
"Ah, an act of unselfishness," Harry smirked. "How very un-Slytherin of you."
"What's this?" Malfoy asked. He looked suspiciously at the glossy cover with its un-moving Muggle pictures.
But of course, that wasn't the end of it.
"Harry, darling!" The young dark-haired waitress greeted him with three kisses on the cheeks. "A table for two this time?"
"It's not... I'm not... It's all very new, nothing official," Harry mumbled and rubbed the back of his neck.
"Weasley invited me to a game of chess."
"To say I'm sorry, I guess. I'm sorry I panicked." Harry felt like a lump of troll snot.
"It was a prank! I thought it'd be funny, but then I got shit-scared anyone would figure out I wrote it and get the wrong idea. What do you think I was doing in that blasted corridor? I tried to take it back, but it was too late."
"Maybe you should try addressing me 'sir' when we're in a situation like this." Harry could hear the smirk in Malfoy's tone.
"I... I don't..." Harry stuttered, once again wishing he could summon words to express himself and what he felt. What did he feel?
"Why not any wizards?"
"I have an accomplice, or several as it seems. I'm here to take you to your birthday-party."
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose and took a deep breath. "The thing is... I've not been doing well lately. My Mind-Healer tells me I work too much." He gave a little strained laugh. "Practically everybody I know tells me I work too much, even before Ginny left me." Malfoy's perfectly groomed eyebrows flew up to his hairline. "She told me I should date Head-Auror Robards instead, since I seemed to prefer his company over hers." He liked to tell it as a joke, which is wasn't at the time, but it made it hurt less.
"Mind your language, Ginerva," Mr Weasley frowned.
"No more of that now, Al," Harry snapped.
"Well then, Potter, now that you've made me give up on one of my principals of life, what more do you want from me?" Malfoy said, when he was finished.
"'Couse their only way of communicating is through wands and fists and, obviously, dicks," Ron muttered.
"You don't know shit about what I want," Draco interrupted, his anger suddenly flaring up.
"Well, not exactly..." Harry felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature in the room. He let his forefinger follow his swollen lip. Had they kissed?
"With the Weaslette, I presume?"
"Because I couldn't bear the thought of you in prison, that's why." Potter's eyes were susiciously moist and he panted heavily. "Everything was horrible enough, after the war, with so many dead. I couldn't live in a world where there was no Draco Malfoy."
Pansy turned to him. "Maybe you should go and see if you can find us something to drink. I think we all could use some."
He rubbed his thumb over the outline of Harry's prick through the coarse fabric of his jeans and it immediately twitched by the attention. "Ah, that's much better."
"Look, Harry." Malfoy lifted his hands from Harry's chest to let them rest on his shoulders. "I'm with a client." He squeezed soothingly Harry's neck, searching his eyes. "There's a teashop just around the corner here. I must finish this first, but I'll be there in twenty minutes, tops. All right?"
"May I speak?" Harry asked when she had finished. The Headmistress nodded.
"Just because you haven't been to the pictures since they ran
"You think that's what Harry's there for?" Neville peered at Ron with an unshielded confusion. "A fight?"
"I've asked him already and he was glad to help, but," Harry blushed a little, "since he and Hannah are trying to get pregnant on their own, it turned out to be a bit awkward, to say the least. In the end he had to say no, for her sake."
This man. Harry cursed under his breath. How could he have been so bloody oblivious, with this boy, this man, right there all the time? All these, years being so close and still not realizing what it meant. This was it, this was finally it. What he'd been looking for his whole life. All that he wanted, all that he'd longed for and never thought he would find. This man, with his snarky remarks and loop-sided humour, his haughty airs and all his wrong decisions. And now this new version of him, that had shown such unexpected tenderness. He would never see what everyone else saw, the Saviour, the Chosen One and all that rubbish. He would always see just Harry.
"Get on the bed. Do you have any lubricant?"
Harry turned to his friend. "Really? Seriously, you wouldn't mind?" He felt his heart take a giant leap up his throat.
"I've been thinking about it ever since," Potter said breathlessly, "and I want it. I want you." He fumbled around a little at his bedside table and handed Draco a book. "Ginny got me this for Christmas. She's a menace. It's a spell-book for same-sex couples and there are preparation spells and... lubrication spells." He smiled goofily. "I seem to have lost my glasses, so you have to cast them. I've marked the page."
"This is not the first time that I have sex, no," Malfoy smirked. He was much closer now and his warm breath whisked over the sensitive pulse-point under Harry's ear, giving him a shiver.
appeared to Draco's relief, Potter's black mop of hair peered out.
It didn't stop him from going, though. He wouldn't let it. He kept his head high and his eyes straight forward, and with strides that incorporated all his inherited indisputable Malfoy-confidence, he walked on and tried not to meet the eyes of the by-passers, as he made his round to the various shops. He always apparated in. Once he made the mistake to walk into the Leaky Cauldron to make the passage through the wall, only to be chased out with screams and violent threats. But that was a long time ago now, and so far this day had been without anyone noticing him. A good day.
"In this raucous," Harry waved his hands around. "Who will hear? Or care, for that matter?"
"Good morning, Father. Good morning, Mother," he said with a light bow. No one should be able to accuse him of forgetting his manners, even at a time of inner crises.
I shrugged. "I guess. I sure would like to try sometimes."
"That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard," Draco sputtered. He fixed his eyes on the seaweed again.
Harry was stunned. He hadn't thought at all, as usual. "What do you mean,
It was only a quick peck on the lips, but it was more than enough to make Draco's heart go galloping madly in his chest and his face flush red. He kept his eyes on Lily and her unicorn, trying to calm down before he met Harry's gaze again.
"That's not enough," Malfoy teased, as he slowly pushed inside, making Harry gasp. "Say it."
"Of course, there is," Hermione said. "We read all about it in History of Magic, 5th year. Don't you remember?"
A violent retching sound made them both turn to the boys at their side. "What?" Harry asked James, who pretended to vomit over his plate.
"And your mother?"
"Tell me what's wrong with him, Potter!" Draco demanded.
"You wanna go on or shall we call it a night?" Harry asked and blinked at the sight of him.
"Where're you going?"
I kept coming back. The bartender started to greet me as one of the regulars and remembered my preferred brand of beer. Sometimes men came up to me, but I smiled politely and told them I wasn't avalible.
"Hello, Potter," he said calmly. "You look surprised. Didn't you receive my card?"
I gaped. I felt my chin drop and I sat there and gaped. I'm sure it wasn't one of my most intelligent looks, because Hermione started to laugh for real.
"Being with a woman for the first time comes with a manual?" Draco's eyebrows shot up in mock-surprise.
Harry tried to avoid looking at any of them. "Maybe I should leave too," he said and rose from the seat he had taken at the end of the sofa.
The water was divine. Harry could hear Malfoy place himself behind Harry's head. He dipped something in the water, a sponge, and started to rub circles on Harry's back. All over his back, up on his shoulders, over the arms. The tension Harry felt slowly subsided. Harry felt Malfoy mover around and the rubbing continued on the front, his pectorals, his abdomen, around his crotch and on the upper side of the thighs. Harry yelped and flinched when the sponge reached between his buttocks, but Malfoy hushed him and spread his legs apart.
Longbottom shifted awkwardly from one to the other, clearly struggling with conflicting wills, but in the end he gave Pansy a shy smile and took a few steps backwards.
Harry sipped the hot tea Hermione handed him in his favourite cup. He
"Cocoa?" Harry's eyebrows shot up in surprise.
"Moving pictures of people having… sex. It's Muggle." He dared a glance at the blond beside him.
Malfoy looked up again and laughed. "Oh, trust me, Potter, you know this."
The Pub was crowded when they got there, but they still managed to get a table. Harry suspected it had something to do with him being the Saviour, but no-one mentioned it, so he acted like he didn't notice.
Harry moved fast and silently slipped into the empty seat next to Malfoy. "What are you doing, Potter?" Malfoy hissed between his teeth.
"Narcissa," Mrs Weasley said sharply and let go of Harry. They all stood silent and stared at each other.
Harry shot a glance inside. Now that the room was lit up by the fire and the candles it gave a totally different impression than it had a while ago. The old furniture seemed to have shaken off their heavy layer of dust and stood a little taller. Even the dark tapestry on the far-off wall glimmered with golden threads and shiny silk.
Harry nodded.
Draco studied his shoes and cleared his throat again. "We could try finding it out together, if you like. We could start with this. Are we doing this?" He lifted his left hand, wich had clasped around Harry's, fingers weaved together without any of them noticing.
How do you tell your long-time nemesis that he's to be a father? Father of a child you never planned to have and at first felt as a mistake, the result of a mixture of potions and a longing Harry wasn't yet really ready to admit. That everything's going to change forever. And no matter what happens, there will always be this bond between them.
They were silent for a while, all three of them. Harry cleared his throat. He'd stopped shivering and started to relax a little. "I was... I..." he started, but clapped his mouth shut again.
"Harry, he knows. No point in arguing it, is there?" Draco's grey eyes met Harry's. But Harry had no intention to give himself away that easily.
"The choices we make in life, huh," his best friend muttered as he looked at Harry, nodding towards Draco, who was, at the moment, jumping up and down, waving his hands in the air together with Pansy and Luna.
"She exercises about five hours a day. Maybe you should try that too?" He raised an eyebrow at her.
It wasn't as this was the first blow-job Harry had received. Ginny had been quite fond of it, actually, but Malfoy's mouth was bigger and as he expertly swirled his tongue around the head, sucked and pulled, he could also take Harry deeper, all the way to the root without gagging. Harry looked down at the blond head that kept bobbing up and down on his prick, and it was so good. He felt his stomach heat up and his toes curl and faster than he thought possible, he was getting close. He tried to communicate this through his ragged breaths and ended up running his fingers through the silky soft hair, pushing him away. But Malfoy took a firm grip at Harry's hip and continued sucking and moaning, as if Harry was the tastiest thing, his cheeks hollowed and his lips nuzzled into the dark curls of Harry's groin. Then, Harry came. He felt the force of his orgasm rapidly build, from the pit in his stomach to the mush his brain had become, and he came in Malfoy's warm mouth, with loads and loads, his hips bucking, his hands pulling at Malfoy's hair and gasping for air.
"What if Malfoy wants this baby? How do we know he's not planning to take it away from Harry once it's born?"
0o0o0o0o
"It can't be," Harry said, his voice cracked.
"I feel better." His voice was ragged. "I think I'm all right."
"You mean, apart from all our friends and practically everybody we know?" I deadpanned.
Potter said, and the tip of the wand ignited with a pale amber light that reflected in his unshielded eyes. He held out the wand towards Draco. "I've been meaning to give it back to you since the start of term, but you're not the easiest person to approach. I also wanted to say, thank you for letting me have it. I know I snatched it from you, but without it we wouldn't be here today. None of us would."
"I honestly don't know what I said." Harry looked down at his nervously shuffling trainers.
"As you said yourself, at some point we have to start acting like adults."
"What a lovely surprise." In one swift move he shut his book and came to his feet. He put the book down beside the wine glass. "May I take your coat? And take off your shoes. Would you like some wine?"
"She mustn't go before I see her." Harry shifted in the bed again, his body was sore all over. "But I wanted to see you first."
against him."
Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose and squeezed his eyes shut. "Maybe. I have a couple of demands, though."
as it is, and I hoped, foolishly as it was, that you've actually had grown up, and since we both have saved each other's lives on more than one occation, that you would consider to help me with this, at least talk about it properly, but boy, was I wrong. You still are, and will always be, a perfect
"You can get dressed again," Healer Towler said, and the light-blue projection disappeared with a pop. "Make another appointment with the Medi-witch outside, about three weeks from now. I'm sure she can fit you in some time right after Christmas. We like to monitor magical pregnancies more frequently than ordinary ones, but since you're young and strong, there's nothing to worry about at this point. I'll also prescribe a potion for your morning sickness and another one with all the vitamins and minerals you need, but please, Mr Potter, even if it's difficult, try to eat some more. Both you and the baby need the nutrition right now."
Hermione frowned. "How does it work, then?"
She and Minnie had spent many long evenings talking about him, while drinking the smoky single malt they both favoured; the tragedy of his childhood, how malnurished he was, the apparent evidance of abuse and their exasperation that they could do nothing about it. But he also had such an unbreakable spirit, a remarkably strong magic and an irrepressible ability to love. The-Boy-Who-Lived. To save them all.
"Dad!" Al whined and sounded more like his eleven-year-old self than he probably would like to. "That's only Uncle Ron and Aunt Mione, or someone else of your old school-friends. You never meet anyone new."
"Erm, no, thanks," Harry stuttered, and almost breathlessly he added, "We ended up doing it... the natural way."
Draco picked up the samples. "The wallpaper's lovely, but niether of your colours go with it. They're both too bright. Here, let me." He took out his wand and transfigured the blue more turquoise and the yellow into a much more pastel version.
"I thought about you, I thought that I could make them see the other side."
She shifted to Harry again. "The bloodlines, the Black and Malfoy-bloodlines, they will continue?"
"What do you think, the blue or the yellow?" Potter threw the colour samples on the table. "I've chosen this wallpaper for Lily's room and I can't decide which to go with it."
"Draco!" Harry roared into the green flames, but there was no answer. Draco wasn't there, not in any of the rooms with a fire. Harry started hyperventilating and a cold sweat broke all over his body. He cursed his own reclessness for going alone without any other means of communication. He could at least have brought the mobile phone Hermione had given to him as a birthday-present but never used. He moaned, "Draco, where are you? Get your bony pureblood arse over here."
Harry bit his lip and glanced over at Malfoy, who was sitting with his arms crossed and his eyes at a blank spot behind the Headmistress's desk. The wizards and witches on the wall seemed to be heavy asleep in their frames, though Harry had the suspicion that the snoring sounds were slightly exaggerated. Dumbledore's picture was thankfully empty, but Harry caught a glimpse of a curious piercing eye from the small dark portrait of Phineas Nigellus.
so I broke the engagement with Astoria."
"Does that mean I can come in?" Harry took a few hesitant steps forward.
He lifted his head and our eyes met. "You felt?" he said. He looked rather astonished. "Haven't you realized, that these songs are all for you? How I feel about you? I'm pouring my heart out every week, only for you." He lifted one of his hands, and cupped my chin and tilted my face up a little. "Oh," was all I managed to say, as it dawned on me. Then the world stopped spinning for a while, because he kissed me. The applause and cat-calls from the bar made me surface again, and he threw a quick smile at me on his way to the stage.
Zabini showed him a seat, and after levitating two magically heated teacups, he sat down opposite him, piercing him through with prodding dark eyes. "Now, what have you been up to lately, Harry? Any juicy gossip to indulge me with?" A snidely smile played at the corners of his mouth. "How are things with the Golden Gryffindors? Still in that amiable threesome of yours?"
He got up and stood face to face with Malfoy. "Leave me alone, I just want to be left alone."
"The engagement-ad will be in the Sunday edition of the Daily Prophet."
Harry looked at him in silence. "I can imagine." He took a swig from his beer. "Your go."
"I didn't… He just..." The words stumbled and twisted in his mind and his hands were trembling.
When Potter came up to the Gryffindor dorm a few nights later, Draco could see that he noticed the dip in the bed, where his body laied, covered under the Cloak. Potter kept up some antics with Weasley and Thomas, talked to Longbottom for a while, then wished everybody a good night and eased himself down in the narrow space that was left on the bed. He drew the curtains, cast a silencing spell and pulled the Cloak away from Draco's face. Draco's cheeks were slightly tinged, and his white blond hair fell across the pillow. They looked at each other.
Half an hour later Hermione had Floo-ed over to Ginny and the children, and Harry was seated with Ron, a steady Fire-whiskey in front of him at the table, while his best friend awkwardly patted his back. "It'll be all right, Harry. It's been like this before, but you two always seems to patch it up again."
and placed the hawthorn wand under his pillow. He cleared his throat.
"You're married," Harry stated. "You ask me out and you flirt with me, and you're married."
Harry closed his eyes. His head was spinning, but he knew it wasn't the alcohol anymore. This situation with Malfoy was making him faintly nauseous, but in a totally freaking-out good sort of way. What in Merlin's name could he say about himself that could make Malfoy even the slightest interested? Somehow that seemed crucial at the moment. He cleared his throat and looked up.
Harry was seated right behind him in Transfiguration class, and he couldn't stop looking at that long slender neckline, fragile and unyielding at the same time. His eyes were locked at it and he had difficulty concentrating on the textbook in front of him, when Malfoy lifted his hand to scratch his neck; no, not scratch, he trailed a finger up and down, almost caressing against the grain of the neatly cut blond hair. Somehow this made Harry's blood rush to his groin and a sweat broke on his upper lip. Malfoy tilted his head slightly forward and a strain of the long fringe fell in front of his eyes, and Harry could sense, rather than see, the smirk at the corners of his lips. The bloody bastard was doing it on purpose. He knew Harry was looking at him. Later that afternoon, Harry had no choice, but to assault him outside the boy's bathroom and drag him into one of the cubicles and run his hands all over him.
Malfoy's boot hit his leg. "Are you even listening to me?" He put his glass down and reached for the bag of crisps. "Back to business, Potter. What about you and girl-Weasley? Do we hear the sound of wedding bells anywhere in the near future?"
"I was there today. It wasn't easy to bring him the news and I'm afraid he didn't take it very well, either."
Harry winced. "Worse than Voldemort."
"What the fuck are you doing here, Malfoy?" He surprised himself by uttering the question out loud.
She was, in no way perfect, Neville knew that of course. She had been mean and haughty as a young girl, and during the year when the Carrows controlled Hogwarts she had done nothing to protest against the injustices. She had kept a low profile, but Neville knew she'd been scared, scared out of her wits, scared enough to try to end it all by pointing out Harry that day of the final battle. Neville'd heard later from Harry, that she had come up to him after it all was over and, in tears, had begged Harry to forgive her for what she'd done.
"We knew it was a bloke. Harry told Hermione and me right after New year's, and that it's been going on for a while. But he refused to tell us who. It had to be someone at Hogwarts, and my first guess was you."
The crisp sheet felt cool and smooth against the heated skin of his tear-soaked cheek. It eased all the thoughts that were spinning around in his head. Harry closed his eyes and let the muted sound of the four women wash over him.
"And what about my nephew?"
Harry watched Malfoy move easily between the work-bench and the stove. The kitchen contained a mix of wizarding things and Muggle, like various cauldrons hanging above the stove with the pots and pans, ingrediencies for potion-making together with the spices and herbs on a shelf. Malfoy's long bony hands worked swift as he meticulously chopped tomatoes for the salad, while the aubergines were being baked in the magically heated oven.
"Gryffindor tower," Blaise said. The easiness in his tone was loaded with meaning.
Now Malfoy pressed him even harder against the wall. "Maybe, just maybe you deserve to be punished for that."
"He's a bloody Death Eater, for Merlin's sake!" Her brown eyes turned dark.
They were thrown out. Not in so many words, but a stern looking Ministry employee Harry vaguely knew from somewhere politely informed them, with barely concealed irritation, that the bar was closing and, if they wanted, they could be escorted home by the Ministry's house-elves, as they were in no condition to Apparate or even find their way to the Floos at the Atrium.
Malfoy made a face at the mess and turned his back at Harry while he concentrated on an especially tricky strip of the wall. The house was crooked and no corner was straight. "Ah, that came much later," he said with a smirk. "It turns out I have some rare knowledge about the Dark Arts that not many Curse-breakers have, thanks to my father's persistant training. They owled me about a particulary difficult case, and I've been consulted now and then ever since."
A loud murmur erupted in the dungeon-like hall and Harry dared to lift hid head for the first time and look at the accused. Malfoy's grey eyes searched Harry's the same instant, and in a blink of a second, Harry zooned out and was back at that night of fear and fire. He could feel Malfoy's thin body flattened against his back as they flew out of the Room of Hidden Things, flames of the Fiendfyre licking their boots. His arms that clung to Harry's abdomen trembled and Harry could feel the whiffs of his heavy panting against his sweat-covered neck. Right then, in the briefest of moments, so brief in fact that Harry later questioned if it had happened at all, Malfoy pressed his face at the side of Harry's throat and inhaled. It was over in an instant, and when they took ground in the hall outside, Harry strained himself not to look at him and not to think about it. But he did.
"Oh!" Draco couldn't help feeling a little embarrassed at the thought of Potter... carrying him? Levitating him?
"Oh, come off it, will you," Blaise grunted. "Not everything is about you and Potter, you know."
"Good?" Malfoy asked, a coy smile playing at the corner of his mouth. "I knew you liked Italian, so I thought I'd go for a safe thing, this first time." Harry almost choked. The flirting and innuendos were getting the better of him. Time to come clean about something.
"Calm down, Scarhead. I have no intention of dragging you out in public. Do you really think I'd be that sadistic? I just wanted to check on you and see if you wanted some company. I didn't like the idea of you sitting alone, brooding. Have you eaten?" He turned away from Harry and took something out of his pocket and un-shrunk it on the table. It was a wicker picknick-basket.
"Sorry?" His voice pitched. "You risked your life and the baby's. That was the most foolhardily reckless thing you've ever done." He clenched his hands and was shaking with anger.
"Yes," Harry also stood. "Come for dinner next week. Thursday? The house will be full of children, but I assume that's all right. You know I come with this package deal." They walked together to the hearth. "And come by the Floo next time. It's wierd having you knock at my door."
"Not a bit," Harry grinned. Then he frowned, "I'm really sorry about your nose. I'm not sure it's broken, though. Does it still hurt?"
Malfoy leaned back in his chair and fixed Harry with his grey eyes. There was a spark of glittering silver in them. "Maybe I can help. I work as a Curse-breaker occationally, as a kind of special cunsultant. Gringotts hire me when they have trouble with some Dark Art effects. I can give it a try. If you want me to, that is?"
"We could have prevented this havoc," Robards growled, "if we'd been prepared. Or stopped it all together, if you'd asked me."
Malfoy swallowed hard. "You offer to help me?"
"Harry, I'm twenty-two. Life is supposed to be fun, we're supposed to have fun. Merlin knows, we deserve it after all we went through. But you work
"I kissed you?" Draco asked. His voice was thin and wavered.
"Why not? We've exchanged... other things." Potter bit his lip and looked embarrassed.
"How do you feel? Adam said you were the most entertaining drunk in a decade."
"No," Harry said sulkily. He had calmed down from his adrenaline high and transfigured his robes to Muggle clothes on his way out of the building, but he was still furious. He glared at Malfoy as he went to the counter and returned with a cup.
Harry shook his head. "I tought we might just go to the Leakey."
"Harry here needs a completely new wardrobe."
He put his coffee-cup down and rose to greet him. He wiped a nervously sweaty hand on his jeans-front before he produced it to shake with a sheepish grin. "Hello, Malfoy."
Draco looked at him with eyes wide open. "Are you asking me on a date?"
"That's settled then. Hold out your hands." A silky kind of rope pulled Harry's wrists together. "Lay down. On your stomach." Harry's arms were thrust over his head and secured at something. Hard, but not so hard it hurt.
"No, of course not. I just thought it odd, that's all." Harry resumed the appeasing strokes of his belly, where his boy, their little baby-boy, was again playing Quidditch with Harry's bladder. The little bugger would be grounded for life for the way he was treating Harry's intestines.
"I'm sorry I woke her up," he said and patted his god-daughter on her soft red hair. "If Malfoy hadn't insisted, I would have gone home. I feel fine, you know."
"And you liked it?"
Draco couldn't even fathom what it would mean. He looked down at Potter's abdomen. He had a knitted old jumper on and it strained a little over his body. There was a slight swell there at the middle, the small beginning of a belly.
Malfoy's eyebrows shot up. "Come again?"
"You're very quiet," Malfoy said. "At least for a loud bombastic Gryffindor," he added with a smile.
"Tosser," Harry scoffed at Malfoy on their way back to the bar. Malfoy turned and gave him a shit-eating grin.
"Only if you call me by my name. No more of this Potter-Malfoy nonsense."
"I'm so sorry," Draco repeated.
"It means I'm asexual."
"I couldn't do that. My father..."
"Thank Merlin!" Bill exclaimed. "Maybe we can have lunch now."
"I got news for all of you," Harry said as he scooped up potato-mash on everyone's plates. "We have to get another bedroom ready. Thank Merlin, there's plenty of them in this house."
"Is there anything Kreacher can do for Master and young Master Malfoy, sir?" the elf asked eagerly, still at Harry's elbow.
Malfoy's face transformed; it was like a sunrise over a misty meadow. "I have the most beautiful little boy," he said, smiling. He reached out and grabbed the spoon from Harry's hand. "Give me that pie instead of trying to stab it to death." He took a piece. "I have to get back to work, and so do you, I suppose," he said chewing.
"You can return it tomorrow," Potter grinned. "Now go, before the whole House wakes up."
"You can't tell anyone about this, Blaise," Draco said and put his hand on his friend's shoulder. "Not even Pansy."
"You're doing so well," Malfoy's lips tickled as they moved down Harry's throat and ghosted over his collarbone. "You're so obedient, so pliant, aren't you, Auror Potter?" His hand moved up and down on Harry's cock in slow firm strokes that made Harry shudder and whimper. Malfoy and his expert lips moved further down on Harry's torso and licked and bit at Harry's left nipple while his other hand pinched the right one rather hard. Harry yelped and his breath hitched.
"But if we don't buy the house now, it'll be gone, and it was perfect. It had just the right amount of small bedrooms for the children and that lovely back garden. You said so yourself." Harry put his chin out to make a point.
It was totally unpredictable. Sometimes slow and meticulous, sometimes it was like a race, or even some kind of revenge. I was like a drug Harry couldn't get enough of and was getting more and more dependent of.
A bolt of anger shot through him. What nuisance that boy could be. The quarrel three days ago had been ridiculous, and the things Draco had shouted at him. Preposterous!
Robards hummed and fidgeted with the parchment in his hand. "I know we said some harsh things that day, but there's no need to make such a hasty decision."
Potter made the headiest noices as Draco reached the nest of dark curl that surrounded Potter's cock. Draco buried his nose in them and inhaled, and let his gaze wander up at Potter's face. Potter was biting his lip and holding his breath. Draco opened his mouth and gave the side of the throbbing cock an experimental lick.
"No wonder you're so unsuccessful on your dates."
"Not yet." Ron turned to Harry and grinned. "And I sincerely hope she never will. But that's not the point. If she does, I will understand. If you talk to Gin, I'm sure she'll understand too." His face became serious again. "Unless..."
Ron tugged at Harry's arm and pushed their way through the crowd towards the bar, where they were loudlygreeted by an indisbutably intoxicated fellow-Gryffindor. "Harry! Ron!" Seamus bellowed. "Here, have a drink, you're both much too soberfor this party." He poured them two large glasses of the golden liquid. Harry locked eyes with Ron and with a laugh, they both nocked back their shots in one go. Harry felt it burn in his throat and immediatly started coughing. Seamus laughed and pounded his back.
Others followed. Luna came over with Zabini's girlfriend Brocklehurst from Ravenclaw, and that seemed to be the point where all students, not only the senior years, swapped tables and sat with whomever they chose at the time. Neville could see on McGonagall's face that she didn't really approve, but if anything were inter-House unity, this was.
without him noticing? He gave Potter a furtive glance to see if he was smirking, but his bright eyes were just solemnly fixed on his. "I was a constant disappointment to him," Draco went on. It felt good.
"It's too late, Potter," he said softly. "This can never happen. It was a possibility, when it was only a one-time thing, but we both know it's not, not anymore. And I can't get a divorce."
Draco looked away and he felt his ears go red. Had it slipped, or had he really wanted Potter to know. "I thought it was obvious, especially after Aunt Walburga's outburst that first day. I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable." Draco swallowed, a big lump had suddenly appeared in his throat, and rose from his chair. "Maybe I should leave, then."
"No, no, of course not. My flat is only a couple of blocks away from here, we could walk." He gave Harry a furtive glance. "If you want to?"
"All right," Harry said. "Let's go then. As friends." He smiled at Malfoy. "Choose a bar and we'll have a couple of drinks and see what happens. What about this one? The name doesn't leave you in any doubt, does it?" He pointed at an ad for a club called G.A.Y. "Or this one, it's not far from where we are now."
"She and Andromeda helped me plan. So, will you come?"
"What do you mean?" Harry asked. "What potion?"
I laughed too. "I think I know what you mean." The moon had risen slightly higher in the sky and it shone on his head, giving his hair an ethereal glow. Merlin, he was beautiful.
"Damn you, Potter, I can't marry Astoria now." Draco was still quite out of breath and his heart hammered like mad in his chest.
Ron coughed. "To be fair, mate, it wasn't Seamus's potion that got you up the duff."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb." Harry took a step back at the sight of her and made a move towards his own bed.
Harry watched the two blond women, with their big boobs bouncing, lick and suck the enormous, almost purple dick, moaning and gasping, their bright red lipstick perfectly in place. He usually never got this far, he'd never really watched it before. The sound alone used to be enough to get him off, but Malfoy's presence had a rather intimidating affect.
I worked hard to find a meaning with my existance. I wanted my life to have a purpose, that's why I studied law. I fill my life with work and try to spend as much time with my son as I can. Then there's the nice things, like music and art, good food and a good wine, and sometimes a quick blow-job with a beautiful stranger in the back of a Muggle-bar.
"Maybe I can tempt you with a cup of black coffee instead?" Malfoy snickered. He reached out his hand to help Harry to his feet again, as children do. "I do have the ability to make exceptionally good coffee."
"I have it right there at my desk, there's plenty of time for a little get-together, isn't it?"
"I contacted our old family solicitor at Gringott's and we've filed for a divorce, so that, at least is settled. And we've swapped homes. I'm back at the Manor and Astoria has my flat in London. We thought it was the best for Scorpius, since he already feels at home there and has his own room."
Ginny had refused to live here when they set up home. She wanted something more modern and closer to the Burrow, so it was left as it was. Now, that he was free to do what he wanted, this felt like the most obvious choise.
He didn't know where he was or how he got there.
He turned to address the man, who was sitting in the chair closest to him, with chains securing his hands to the arms of the chair. The man's face showed nothing. He held his chin high and his eyes fixed on a spot somewhere far away, as if what was happening in this room didn't concearn him at all. "Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, known as a Death Eater and acknowledged follower of the Dark Lord Voldemort. I ask the jury to raise their hands if it is believed that his crimes, as presented to this court, has earned him a lifetime sentence in Azkaban."
"How old is he now? This is his first year, right?" Draco asked.
"Yes, I did expect that. That's part of my problem, isn't it?" Harry snapped.
Potter nodded.
"Malfoy, I never meant to..." Harry's voice wavered. He didn't know what to say.
I was hungry and there wasn't anything in the house. I can go out for a bit to eat, can't I? Not that I needed an excuse or anything. I can do what I want. I ignored the fact that I every other day in the week had ordered Take-away.
When Draco's bottle landed on me everyone booed and shouted. I didn't care. I met him enthusiastically in the middle, where our lips clashed. I fisted my hands in his hair and pulled him closer, deeper, and ignored the catcalls and the shouting of, "Get out of here! Get a room, for Merlin's sake!"
Harry was sitting at his side on the sofa. He had his Potions textbook in front of him, but he didn't seem to study anymore. He wasn't watching the chess-players either. Harry had placed both his hands on his belly and had a rather awestruck look on his face. "Hermione," he said slowly, "I felt something move."
He walked into the breakfast-room and paused. The sun poured through the high window, that faced the east, framed with soft green curtains. He closed his eyes and let the warmth wash over him. He could never get enough of sunlight these days.
Hermione Granger and some of the other Muggleborn, had insisted that they all should wear Muggleclothes with a Christmas theme, and he felt quite satisfied with himself when he left the Slytherin dorm in a crisp white shirt, black pants and a dark blue velvet waistcoat, embroidered with silver stars. Not entirely Muggle, but close enough. They had all been in schoolrobes for so long and he knew he looked good, as he entered the room, and that's when he saw him, clad in a pair of lowcut worn out jeans and a green T-shirt with a stupid reindeer printed on the front. The reindeer's nose sparkled bright red and the shirt was a little too tight and a little too short, and it made him furious. Draco sneered at anyone who tried to talk to him and soon nobody even bothered, so he was left alone with a dark frown, in the corner of the sofa, drinking several cups of eggnog and watching the people dancing among the snowflakes. Or rather; he watched someone dancing.
"No," I lied. "Why would I think about him?"
Harry looked from Weasley to Draco, and back again. "I don't… I..." He swallowed.
"Ever since then, witches and wizards has been experimenting with different identifying potions and spells, but no one have been able to help the entire human race. They have only worked on individual basis, like the one I made, which we took, Harry."
Harry thought of the stern snarky man in his black robes at that first meeting in the Muggle café, and the man in his bed this morning, relaxed and giddy, blowing raspberries on Harry's belly, insisting it was time for his son to wake up and kick his daddy. Had it only been a year?
"Well, didn't you?" Draco tilted up his chin.
"It will be impossible for you to work in the field while you're pregnant, of course." Healer Smith furrowed his brow in what he apparently thought was a sympathetic look.
"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you in front of your rightious little friends," Malfoy hissed very close to Harry's ear. "Trust me, I'm not that keen to make my presence known." With that said, he spit in his hand and gripped Harry's cock together with his own and with them aligned side by side, his hand started to move.
Draco kept talking and Potter listened. At some point Potter took Draco's hand, the left with the ugly mark on the forearm. He didn't let go and Draco didn't pull away.
"I believe we could all do with some tea," McGonagall eventually said and clapped her hands.
"You're beautiful, Malfoy," Harry murmured, his voice croaking.
Salazar's mouldy pants!
When Harry stepped inside the restaurant, with all it's familiar scents, Marina grabbed him by his arm and dragged him over to the secluded booths.
"But it was your idea, you thought it out."
"Not his fault?" Granger yelled. "He wanted
"Astoria, naturally," Malfoy admitted and followed a crack in the table with his forefinger nail. "She yelled at me, she never done that before. And she called me a fool."
He streched out as he lay on the worn-out sofa and waited. He'd been there for a while now. He'd sat there and waited until all his fellow Gryffindors had finally gone up to bed. It was very late and still he hadn't come.
"Wow, it's a broom! A real grown-up broom!" Teddy screamed and his hair shifted from bright blue to pink and back again of excitement. "Thank you, Harry. Thank you." He threw his arms around his Godfather.
The noise that met him when he came through the Floo a week later was absolutely deafening. At first, he thought something had happened and that Harry was in danger of some kind. Draco's wand was out in his hand and he was about to run up the stairs, when he heard Harry roar, "That's enough, Albus! Go to your room." The outburst was followed by a loud stomping, accompanied by fierce screams of, "I's not fair!" and the little boy disappeared into his room with a slam of the door. But the wailing did by no way stop at that.
Malfoy dropped the knight he was currently moving and turned to stare at Harry. Hermione, who sat at the nearby desk, studying Ancient Runes together with Mandy, put her quill down with shaking hands. "The baby?" she asked, her voice quivering.
Harry thought it must be a sure sign of Malfoy getting slightly inebriated, the way he started ranting on about some wine-tasing he'd done while in France, of the villa the family owned near Montpellier and how the wine tasted there in the sunny afternoons on the patio. His voice drawled on and on and the melodic sound made Harry sink into his soft chair and close his eyes and...
Harry blushed. "You think so?"
"No," Potter answered.
"Nice to see you again, Harry. It's been too long. How are you?" Her honey-brown eyes gleamed warmly at him, her round cheeks were rosy, and she smiled. She was more beautiful than ever.
"No." Harry played a little with his wineglass and dared to catch Malfoy's gaze. "But there was this time at a Muggle bar..."
That life from now on really held every possibility.
"Oh, there it is."
"You mean, he KILLLED them?" Harry was fuming.
Malfoy let his fingers trail a crack on the surfice of the table, avoiding Harry's eyes. "Well, let's just say that I wasn't that eager on our side winning."
"Well, then," Hermione started counting. "Dean's Muggleborn and Seamus is half-blood." She looked at Ron.
Speaking of the witch, the doors flung open again and a very agitated Headmistress marched in with her robes billowing, her pointy hat askew, and with Minister Shacklebolt, Head-Auror Robards and a few of the Hogwarts staff in toll.
After a while he said, "He never gave me a chance to make my own choises in life." And with a quivering voice, he added, "I loved him very much."
"Mr Malfoy…  Draco," Headmistress McGonnagall started, "I've received news about a recent development, and I can see that your mother has written to you, as I can only guess, about the same matter. Why don't you take a moment here and read your mother's letter?"
"Oh," Potter said as he opened the shirt. His hands shook harder, but he let his fingers follow the welted lines that criss-crossed Draco's torso. "I didn't know it left such scars," he said. "Snape said it would heal..."
"If you don't count that blasted thing Seamus gave you." Weasley gave a snorting sound.
"And that's supposed to be rousing? Muggles having sex?" The astonished contempt displayed on his face was almost comical.
"Well, we always knew he took it, didn't we.?"
Harry did, far too well. But it would be worth it, he reminded himself. And blow over. Everything would eventually blow over.
"None, I'm just Harry." Harry couldn't help but chuckled as he held out his hand to be shaken.
Harry nodded. "Do you?"
"You want us to befriend someone, only so we can say that we're friends with people from all Houses?" The drawl in Draco's voice hadn't changed, and Harry marvelled over the fact that he found it such a turn on.
"Git."
"No," Harry said. "Not like that. Not on purpose." He drank some coffee and tried to collect his thoughts. "Have you heard of the soulmate-spell? Or, as Hermione calls it, the Split-apart spell?" Harry fiddled with his cup, turning it in his hand.
And so, she did, and Harry made pancakes, changed dipers and read bedtime stories. He kissed Ginny goodbye when she left for a tournament, waited up for her when she came home late after a game, and he thought they were both relatively happy and content with the arrangement and their lives.
"Kreacher cannot help," he panted. "But Kreacher can say, sir."
"Imagine what old Lucius would say, Harry," Ron quipped as he extinguished the light. "And I still don't get how Malfoy became affected by a potion you took."
"Mr Potter." Her tone was distant and held a questioning note, but she removed her hand from Draco and held it out for Harry to take. "How kind of you to visit, Mr Potter. Would you like to have some tea? Pipsey," she turned to the elf. "Will you be so kind to fetch another cup for Mr Potter?"
Malfoy laughed. "Naturally. Every pure-blood kid waits anxiously for the day when their soulmate is revealed to them."
Draco made himself ready to walk on, but Potter remained where he was, awkwardly shifting from one foot to the other, blocking his way. "Is there anything else you want, Potter? I'm late for Arithmancy class as it is." Draco kept his voice at his haughtiest, so that the tremor in his throat remained undetected.
and the dim glow fell over their faces. Harry screwed his eyes shut and the shadows gave him a strained expression. "I didn't know it was even remotely possible," he groaned.
"Answer the question, Malfoy," Harry bellowed, but found himself being pushed back through the door by a couple of strong hands on his chest. Janice closed the door behind them with a small apology to the grey-haired man.
He got up and went to the loo and then he pulled on his old joggers before he padded into the kitchen. He filled the kettle with water for a pot of tea and was just about to pull out his wand to heat it, as he used to do. With a small laugh he put the kettle on the cooker and turned the nob. Things were going to be different from now on. Really, really different.
The swirling gut-wrecking Apparition landed them outside the porch of Malfoy Manor. It was nauseating at the best of times, but now the pull took the better of him. Harry bent over the hydrangeas and heaved out the contents of his stomach. On the other side of the steps he could hear Malfoy doing the same.
When the silence had stretched out between them for some time, Draco had to ask the question that kept nagging at the back of his mind. "You honestly want to have a child... with me?"
Draco bit his lip, dipped the quill and started again on a new parchment.
"It's right here." Harry pointed at the vial standing next to a mug.
"Yeah, but posing as one?"
"Well, I live nearby and I don't cook, so..." Harry smiled. He still felt a little embarrassed about the waitress's remark about Malfoy, even more so as he realized she was right. Malfoy was beautiful.
Harry gasped as Malfoy's hand slowly wandered lower from his waist and then, with something that was somewhere between a whimper and a sigh, he murmured, "Oh, Harry."
There is, of course, a background story to all this, these horrifyingly mixed emotions I apparently still felt for him.
Draco turned the little girl around and found a row of strange popping buttons that easily opened. With the dress off, it left the pants and diaper. With Lily now on her back, he took a deep breath and just pulled.
"It'll be your friends there, Weasleys and Gryffindors."
When Harry came down from his incredible high, he was pressed down on the mattress by Malfoy's limp heavy body. Malfoy ran his fingers idly through Harry's hair and sighed contently.
That made Harry's rage boil, and with eyes flashing with anger, he pushed him even harder against the wall. "Watch it, Ferret, are you calling me fat?" It was true, in a way. Harry had filled out these last six months and his shoulders had broadened. He wasn't the scrawny nimble boy anymore, but it was all muscles.
"But, what about the game? There's the House-cup match today." He had no intension to miss the game, locked up here in the Infirmary. "I have to be at the Quidditch pitch."
"If that's what you wish for, then that's what you get." She suddenly rose. "I'm sorry, Mr Potter, you'll have to excuse me. I'm very tired, I'm afraid." She took a step, but swayed slightly. With a crack Pipsey was at her side, holdig her arm in a steadying grip. "I'm going to lay down for a while, Draco. Make sure Mr Potter is comfortable for the rest of his stay here. We don't want him to find us inadequate in our hospitality." Then she left the room with her hand resting on the little elf's shoulder.
"Thank you," he croaked out. The new birch wand he had got after the trials had never felt the same when he used it.
Pomfrey grunted. "Oh, I'm sure it was." She pointed her wand at his face and muttered a spell. With a tingling sensation, his nose seemed to stretch, and the pain was almost gone as well. "When will the two of you stop these childish fights, I wonder?"
Harry stood crestfallen.
"Would that be such a bad thing?"
They worked side by side in the nursery, Harry insisting on putting on the glue with a brush the Muggle way, Malfoy levitating the ready-glued rolls up on the wall with elegant flicks of his wand.
Harry blushed even deeper as he shook his head. "I don't know anything about you really, except what happened at Hogwarts and that you're now a semi-Muggle solicitor." And as Harry still was a Gryffindor at heart, he added, "Care to fill in the blanks?"
It bothered Harry, though. Because he knew how it felt. He'd used to wonder if that white-blond hair would feel as silky as it looked and now he knew. He'd had his fingers through it, for Merlin's sake.
"At Azkaban?"
Draco laughed maliciously. "Why would anything be about something as insignificant as Ginny Weasley?"
"Oh, Ronnikins," Ginny laughed and made a disgusted face. "You're such a sap, always trusting in the happily ever after."
"Immensely."
"Absolutely," Ron stated. "Malfoy, though." He made a face.
With shaking hands Harry removed the last garment on his body and stood completely naked in the center of the room. He felt exposed. Malfoy was fully dressed in a black shirt and black woollen trousers, that clung to his hips. He was sexy as hell; Harry only felt stupid.
appeared on the white front. "Isn't it great?"
"Good night, Harry," Hermione said. "It'll work out fine, you'll see."
Draco gingerly got to his feet. So far, he had counted 7 tripping hexes, 4 stinging hexes, 1 toenail-growing hex (rather imaginative, that one), 1 vomiting jinx and 3 Howlers. Nothing lethal so far, but it had only been a week since he stepped off the Hogwarts Express. He didn't keep record of the taunts and the hissed threats.
"Pipsey will always want to help Harry Potter. Harry Potter was Dobby's friend."
They passed a dimly lit entrance and Harry screwed up his eyes at the colourful lights that hit him in the face as they entered the club. A heavy bass assaulted his ears in the loud surrounding music. As it was relatively early in the evening it wasn't too crowded, and by a miracle a small booth became vacant when two men decided to leave.
"Still, I can't belive I did that."
Draco bloody-arch-nemesis-turned-civil-acting-sort-of-friend Malfoy.
"No, no, he's back," Hermione said and helped Rose climb onboard. "He's moved back at the Malfoy Manor again. I think he's got some position at Gringotts." She jerked Harry's arm. "Harry, wake up. I think your son is trying to tell you something."
"Calm down, mate," Ron said carefully. This was unexpected, but he quickly decided to go along with it. "You don't have to see Gin if you don't want to. Just come with us, we'll help you get what you want."
God damn it. We were at
"Don't be rude, it doesn't suit you. You know I was cleared of all charges."
"The Prophet was making such a big fuss about it, I remember." Malfoy tilted his head and watched Harry. "How you and your childhood sweetheart were oh-so-cosy and very much in love. The perfect match between
"You've never tasted beer before?" Harry smirked.
"Hardly!" Harry snorted. "Did I say I wanted to be your friend?" He paused and put his wand away. "But I'm not your enemy either. Not anymore."
"Why's that, Draco?"
Harry lifted his head and tried to focus on the grey eyes in front of him. He shuddered his shoulders. "I slept bad and I haven't eaten today," Harry said. "Do you want to get out of here before I get thoroughly sloshed?"
Harry shook his head. "It's not me you want for a job like that. Ron's the strategist among us and a better judge of character than I am. Give it to him."
"What?" Draco huffed. "Are we supposed to lay here and exchange confidences?"
"No!" Harry exclaimed. "No, it's just shagging."
"Oh, shall we say… fourth year, maybe." His gaze wandered back to the dark waters of the lake.
"I'd say they're responding very well." Malfoy's head fell back and he closed his eyes. The top buttons of his shirt were open and revealed the long slender column of his throat and the smooth pale skin at the dip of his collarbone. His eyelashes fluttered on his cheekbones as his lips parted and he exhaled a deep ragged breath.
Harry was a bit drunk, but then, so was everyone else in the room. Somehow it had turned into a party for the entire Department. Someone had managed to put on some music and the room was too hot, too crowded and too loud, and slightly spinning.
"Because I was famous?" Harry kicked a slightly bigger stone on the pathway as they moved on.
Ron stared with his mouth wide open. "You haven't?"
"So, you liked me back then?" Harry couldn't help a little smug smile.
Harry looked once more at the note Hermione had pressed in his hand right before he stepped into the Floo. It was late, too late to contact a stranger, but if he had to wait until office hours, he'd never get it done.
"You have Muggle cows?" Harry asked confounded. He stepped carefully not to trip in his borrowed Wellingtons. They were Draco's and at least two sizes too big. Draco could've easily Transfigured them for him, but Harry didn't want to ask.
Zabini shrugged. "Astoria? Smart and funny. Far too pretty for him." He gave Harry a searching look. "You
They walked on, up some stairs. Weasley had both his hands on Draco, to steady him.

"Oh, the usual; blood-purifying the wizarding population, obductions, torture and Unforgivable Curses," Malfoy deadpanned.
Draco forced his voice to sound indifferent. "All right."
came the cheery voice from the bandstand and Malfoy was gone.
"Oh, oh, oh, it hurts!"
As the night went on, Draco lost count on how many times he whispered, gasped and panted Harry's name. With the passion growing, the issue of names became increasingly less important, as primal bodily urges took over. When Draco came violently, with ropes of white cum over Harry's stomach, he cried it, loud and shameless, and collapsed on top of him, pressing him down on the matrass with all his weight. Before sleep took hold of him and he drifted off, he put his lips on Harry's ear and whispered, "I love you too, Scarhead."
Draco sighed. "I honestly can't say. I know for a fact that she never shared my father's faith in the Dark Lord, but she's very proud of her heritage. As I am too." Then his grey eyes glittered as he looked at Harry. "And I will be very proud of my son's heritage, as well. He'll be part Malfoy, part Black, part Potter and part Muggle. What better combination could there be for a young wizard in our times. But for the most, he'll be his own, with his own choices to make, his own mind and his own pride. And I can't thank you enough for giving me this wonderful gift." He stood and faced away from Harry, and with a short laugh he wiped his eyes. "I thought you were the one with the raging hormones. Come, before I make a complete fool of myself and start bawling. Are you up for a tour around the house?"
"You're far too gernerous with that boy, Harry. He could do very well with the broom you gave him two years ago." Andromeda Tonks sipped her tea. He sat alone with her in the kitchen, greatful for a quiet moment after the booming chaos that Christmas breakfast at the Burrow always was. He had spent a long night talking to Ron and Hermione and reconciling with Ginny, not that she'd admitted being wrong, but she spoke to him again and he was content with that.
Harry screwed his eyes shut again and tried to collect his thoughts.
He grabbed Harry by the arm and tried to pull him up from the bench. He turned to Neville. "Nev, will you take Harry's broom and gear, and follow us up to the common room. Seamus!" he spoke more harshly, and the other boy almost jumped at the change of tone. "You'll go with Hermione to the library and see what you can find out about the mix in that bloody concoction of yours."
He paced the office floor and continued. "What will happen when you
"You tricked me, you wanted me to fuck you."
"But… but, you agreed to go look for houses with me." Harry stood crestfallen.
"So, you don't remember this?" Potter said and his lips were over Draco's.
"But surely..." Harry began, but he was interrupted by a loud roar from the crowd at the bar watching the game.
Sometimes it took hours of slow play, of edging, before any of them were allowed to come.
He quickly removed his clothes and got into bed as Potter cast the

Malfoy snorted. "What did you expect? For everyone to fall on their faces in awe as soon as you raised a wand, Oh Chosen One?"
A moment later the clatter died down and all heads turned to the entrance. The Gryffindors had arrived.
He meant to stay out of everybody's way and only focus on his NEWT's, and he'd been scared. But all it took was one look into those mesmerizing green eyes, as they met in the Great Hall the first night. Potter held his gaze and gave a small nod, before he went on his way, and Draco released a breath he wasn't aware of holding, and his confidence returned as he straightened his shoulders.
Harry took Hermione's hand and moved to look at Draco. He was shifting nervously and refused to meet Harry's eyes.
"Syringe?" Malfoy turned to Harry, who went red as a beetroot.
They Side-alonged into the entrance hall and un-shrunk the sleeping-bag and Al's satchel. Al bent his head back and gaped at the high ceiling, the marble staircase and the many paintings in golden frames of disapproving Malfoys on the walls. "Wow!" he breathed.
"What's the matter, mate?" Ron gave me a look, as I agonized. "Aren't you going to put it on?"
"Ha-ha," Draco said and proceeded to throw his belongings back into his bag. He didn't want to face Potter and reveal the flush that threatened to cover his cheeks as well as his ears. "Very funny."
Malfoy tilted his head and his gaze pierced Harry. "Yeah," he said dawdlingly, "but we do that pretty well, I believe." He leaned closer to Harry. "The duels we've had, rather spectacular, don't you think? And the bare-knuckle fights were quite satisfactory too."
"That there was to be a baby, on the other hand..." She shook her head with a dazed look on her face. "Did you know?"
Draco snorted. "You're reading it all wrong." He snapped the card out of Harry's hand.
He looked down on his hands and stains of pink flushed his cheekbones. "I thought mine would come out all blank since I haven't… ever…"
"Can you for once stop being so bloody dramatic," Blaise heaved a deep sigh.
"Thank you. I will find a way and then I call on you, all right?"
Like the night before, they lay facing eachother in the weak light, silent, but in a comfortable silent. After a long while, Draco said, "I can't talk about the war. I'm not sure I ever can."
"Stay where you are, Potter. You're obviously not in the right mood tonight." Draco picked up a T-shirt from the floor and tossed it at Harry. "Put this back on, will you."
He sighed and added tentatively. "Later, after... everything... dating was the last thing on my mind. I wasn't well. I spent some time at a specialist Mind-Healer in Bern." He gave Harry a furtive glance. "It helped a lot, but I still have trouble using the Floo. Reminds me too much of Vincent and... you know, the fire."
"Would you mind if I used your shower?" Malfoy asked as they stepped inside Harry's narrow hallway. He had wrapped his arms around himself, looking a bit lost and uncertin. "I can still feel the prison smell in my hair and clothes." He winced.
"Blaise asked who I thought about when I wanked at night." Harry gave a surprised laugh. It seemed the Slytherins brought this game to a much more daring level. Malfoy gave Harry a sideway glance. "It was revealed that I'd had this crush for years."
