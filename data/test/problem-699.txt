“In the bathroom, babe.” The boy’s muffled voice shouted from the next room. Draco soon walked out, dressed in joggers and a t-shirt with slippers on. “Finally awake?” He walked over to his bed and kissed his boyfriend quickly. “I’m gonna go out into the commons, meet me there soon, alright?”
“How long have you and Pansy been together?” Harry asked seriously and Draco burst out laughing. “W-what?”
Draco watched him go into their connected bathroom, seeing the door swing shut. His lips turned upwards into a bright grin as he felt that familiar tugging in his chest. Maybe he did have a shot after all.
“Didn’t know the word for it, but yes. I’ve never felt any interest in girls and I always found myself getting a little too attached to the male love interests in the books I read when I was younger.” The blonde explained. “Mother always knew as well, she told me that when I came out to her. Father was slightly surprised though. He seemed disappointed for a while since I was supposed to marry Daphne Greengrass. He eventually came around though, somewhat at least. We didn’t really talk much in the last few years so I can’t be fully sure.”
“H-Harry.” Draco groaned, tangling his fingers in the boy's hair and holding his head there. His hips started moving, rocking against him, though their movement was restricted with them both still in constricting jeans. Harry grazed his teeth on the bud, making Draco shudder and whine. He switched to the other and started the same treatment there, one of his hands coming up to play with the other. "Fuck, yes. Just like that, love." The blonde encouraged.
He was about to head to his room when he looked over at the trio. He took a deep breath and walked over to them, all of them giving him looks of confusion. "Hi."
“I’m so sorry for these.” Harry whispered, running a finger over some of the scars. “You could’ve died then, Draco. I almost killed you.”
Draco couldn't help his heart fluttering at the tone used. "Things have changed, we've changed, Potter." Draco stood, holding out his hand. “Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” He recited the words he’d said to the boy that first year. “Though I’d prefer you to call me Draco.”
can’t believe you spent like five thousand galleons ($33,200 or £25,100) on this. I mean three carats, Harry? That’s ridiculous.”
“For who you fancy?” Draco asked, getting a nod from the other. He frowned but the thought was soon forgotten as they entered The Three Broomsticks, spotting most of their year in there.
Draco quickly cast a drying spell and colour preserving charms on his hair before walking over to the mirror. It was nice, a dark green that complimented his eyes just like Harry had said it would. He smiled a little and walked out into their room, seeing Harry on their bed. After they’d gotten together, they’d requested a single queen-sized bed instead of the two full-sized ones that were in their room before. “Finished.” He announced as he plopped onto the bed next to Harry.
“And finally, eighth years.” McGonagall’s voice rang through the dining hall, getting the attention of the few eighth-year students that had returned to complete their final year. The surviving students had three options: finishing their year at home, going to another school, or finishing at Hogwarts. This left their already small year even smaller since some students had opted for the first two options. “You will all be in one dorm, not separated by houses but girls and boys will still be separated. You have each been randomly assigned a roommate and this will not be changed. You are adults now, you will learn to get along.” A few of them nervously looked around, seeing which students they could possibly be paired with. “No dress code for you but please keep it appropriate, there are children here. You will be able to leave the grounds when you please and there will be no curfew but only if you do not cause trouble with these freedoms. I hope you all find comfort and unity in each other this year, we’ve all suffered great losses.” And with that she nodded her head and walked to her place at the staff table, everyone beginning their dinner.
The door jingled again and distracted them. Harry moved away, blushing, then walked to the other side of the store as Draco followed. “What are you getting now?”
"What do you want, Malfoy." Weasley grumbled, getting an elbow to the side from his bushy-haired girlfriend.
The blonde reached under his bed and grabbed the broom, pulling it out. “This? It was from you? But… you said you bought something for someone you fancy.” Harry nodded in confirmation and Draco felt his heart beat faster as he set the broom back down. “I left because I saw Hannah kiss you.” He admitted
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s neck. “I’ve wanted you since first year. I’m so sorry I was such a prat.”
“He’s your father, I understand. You tried to rationalize what he did for a long time because you love him. You can both love and hate him, Draco.” Harry stepped away from him and peeled off his gloves, tossing them in the bin. He returned to Draco and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “All done. Now you just have to wait about forty minutes.”
“That’s literally impossible, Harry. Now go to bed, no more questions. We’ll never get any sleep if you keep up with your ramblings, love.”
“Draco, darling, whatever are you grinning about?” Pansy’s voice interrupted his train of thought and his head snapped up, looking across the table at her.
Draco pulled it out of the box and groaned. “Godric Gryffindor. Here, I already have a bunch of these.” He handed the card to Harry, who placed it in his pocket. They were quiet for a while and the blonde took the time to look around. He soon spotted Neville, sitting with Dean and Seamus. He laughed to himself, he knew that’s who he’d be with. “I’ll be right back.” He set his partially finished drink down and stood, making his way through the pub and eventually reaching his destination. “Hello, Longbottom.” He greeted.
“Yeah, yeah.” The brunette laughed. They fell into silence for a minute before a thought came to Harry’s mind. “Dray? Remember that hair dye that you brought?”
Potter grinned, taking his hand and shaking it. “Well you can call me Harry then I suppose.” He dropped the hand but his smile stayed as he closed the suitcase. “It’s nice, seeing this side of you, Draco. Excuse me.”
Draco smiled a little. “Ideally, I want something that's like… enchanted, I guess? I don’t know what a proper name would be. But I want it outside, an evening wedding, maybe late summer when it’s about to turn to fall. With a bunch of strung up lights and lanterns. White, green, and black as the main colours. Wooden furniture. I want it to be elegant.”
Draco pulled off with a pop and started trailing down further, running his tongue down Harry’s thighs and licking over his hole, watching him tense. “You’ve never shagged a bloke, have you?”’
“Yes.” Draco responded breathily. He removed Harry’s hands and slipped off his flannel, then pulled his shirt off.
“No, you just look nice.” Harry said simply. He was dressed in blue jeans, a black t-shirt, and a red flannel. They sort of matched and the idea made Draco’s heart flutter. “When’d you get pierced?”
“Oh come on, you blundering idiot.” Draco snickered, grabbing Harry’s hand without thinking and starting to walk a lot more slowly towards the pub. “Did you really only go to Honeydukes?”
“Oh goodness!” Hermione laughed out, quickly reaching for her wand and casting dittany. “There you go, blood's gone, now go back to peeling.” It was clearly a tease, but Malfoy got so worked up over it, muttering all about muggle nonsense and stupid apple pies, Harry hadn't really listened.
“I hate you…” he whimpered, the cruel skull staring back at him, back in the day he used to be proud wearing that mark but now it felt like an unliftable curse, always there to follow him till the end of time, his Father wore it, his mother beared it on her skin only for their poor son to follow, to repeat their awful mistakes, so he will be just as cursed as they are, unable to live his life normally ever again.
YOOOO IT'S 2 AM AND I JUST FINISHED THIS CHAPTER BUT I COULDN'T MAKE YOU GUYS WAIT ANY LONGER SO THERE IT IS! I LIKE WROTE 5K WORDS IN ONE SITTING SO THIS CHAPTER IS 9K WORDS THAN THE USUAL 6K HOPE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH GOOD NIGHT
“Where have you been?!” Weasley squealed as he and Potter made their way inside the great Hall, it was already half empty as many students had already finished their breakfast. They sat down the Gryffindor table together earning a couple of looks, especially from Longbottom, who tensed up the moment Draco appeared in the hall. Potter chuckled awkwardly rubbing the back of his head “sorry, I slept over at Draco's” he said, and Hermione gasped loudly, he could already feel the blush creeping up his face, no way to be subtle with the name change but Potter didn't have to be so blunt about it! “Don't make it sound weird Potter. I kindly let you in only because you were enough of a dumbass to almost run into Filch yesterday.” It seems like his excuse (which was the absolute truth and nothing else) didn't land properly, since Hermione gave him a long and knowing look he wished she wasn't giving him. Pansy, who Draco now noticed was sitting besides her, a pair of black eyebrows so high you could barely see them under her dark hair. “You guys made up!” She exclaimed happily, a wave of relief washed over him, at least his best friend wasn't giving him weird looks, someone did though, sitting next to Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom couldn't stop staring him tense glances as if waiting for Draco to leap at him at any moment. When he met his gaze however, the boy turned back to his half empty plate, shoving a piece of fried egg into his throat, nearly choking on it in the process.
“Wait, what project?” Potter asked, looking so confused you might assume he arrived at Hogwarts just yesterday “the project Slughorn gave us last lesson, you're supposed to hang it out in 3 days you know.” Draco said, not even being surprised by Potter's behavior at this point. From their short friendship he had learned that the chosen one is not as clever and amazing as everyone thinks, while he knew this for forever, Harry Potter is nothing more than a huge dumbass. Pansy giggled, looking over Granger's shoulder to look at the boy “you really forgot? You know you're graded for this right?” The chosen one paled, his head quickly jerking towards Granger. “Hermio-”
Closing his eyes tight, it was silent around him, so he hesitantly opened them, seeing himself, a reflection, his gray eyes wet and tired drowning in the dark circles under them, his lips chapped and his skin dry with a slight green tint it it, his hair was a mess similar to his clothes, he wasn't sure why seeing himself like that was so shocking, so familiar.
them you know?” She looked at her boyfriend with sheer disappointment, and then sighed, realizing everyone are looking at her dumbfounded. “Wait, you've never made a pie before? Like, ever?” She stared, Draco felt an uncomfortable twist in his stomach “uh…no?” He said, realizing that he and Potter said that in unison, both sparing a look at each other before turning back to Hermione, who frowned “you mean your mother never taught you how to make apple pie?” Potter grimaced, his gaze dropping to Ron's half eaten plate “er..” he mumbled, and Hermione clasped her hands over her mouth, gasping “oh Harry I didn't mean to- and you Draco?” She turned to him in a desperate attempt to fix the situation, he swallowed hard, noticing Pansy smirking at him. “Um, well, my mother never really used the kitchen...house elves cooked for us…” he mumbled suddenly feeling embarrassed of his heritage, which he shouldn't do, why would he? His life was filled with gifts and chocolates with plenty of money to spare of course they had house elves- his mother is a noble woman, at least she would be still, if her husband hadn't been a death eater and thrown to rot in jail. Hermione's frown turned into a glare, seems like house elves is a sensitive topic for her, Merlin, it's so hard to communicate with Gryffindors.
"If there is a brat between the two of us, that would most certainly be you." Draco cocked his head, keeping his nose high as if to shove his poshness right into his face, Harry would be annoyed if he didn't like the sight of Draco's exposed throat this much. "Yeah?" With a burst of Gryffindor courage, and maybe the desperate need to shut a git up, Harry stepped sideways easily pushing Draco right against the nearest wall. His soft gasp echoed across the empty hall, gray eyes wide with astonishment. "Harry what are you-" he whispered, but Harry didn't bother telling him, he showed him instead. Leaning in Harry pressed his body against the other teen, their lips meeting midway as Harry continued what he didn't get enough of yesterday. It was silent, as if the whole building held its breath, only to be broken when Draco's hands gave way. Letting his books clash loudly at their feet his hands reached to pull on Harry's robes, pulling him closer. From there, it was all but quiet gasps and frenzied movements. Following Draco's lead Harry abandoned his books in order to run his hands all over Draco's sides, feeling his ribcage through the fabric of his button up. It was hot, it was bewitching. As if pink lips against pale skin pulled Harry under some powerful spell, and he didn't even bother try resisting it.
“With needles.” Potter said without skipping a beat. Draco screeched “A NEEDLE?? What is wrong with them?? I would never do such a stupid thing as tattooing myself with- with needles!!”  Instead of saying anything, Potter just gave him a long, long glare. “Won't do anything as stupid huh?” He mused, making Draco snap his mouth shut.
“How can you be so calm about it?!” Draco snapped, his grip tightening “do you know what I've done?!*
Both pairs of eyes wanted him to do something, wanting him to take action and decide. But which will he bear? What will his fragile heart withstand? The green was once cold towards him, full of anger and hatred. And it hurt him, it hurt him so bad. Now when he's gotten to see their bright light, experience their warmth. How can he slip back to what it once was? Yet a gathering storm was blowing at him, swaying him. As his home withered and sank, falling apart into sand right in front of him. Oh how he wishes to reach out, to stop the wing from wailing. To cease it from taking any more from him.
Blushing hard Harry looked around the room to find his clothes, finding them right in the entrance, damn. Blaise had quite the sight when he came in didn't he?
“Is it…how you usually spend your time..?” Draco murmured into his ear, through their way to the kitchen he paled several shades and looked very uncomfortable, focusing all his attention on his shoes than anything else going on around him. Harry smirked “nah, but I do remember a couple of times when I came over for tea when.. well, Dobby was alive.” The last sentence left his mouth with a guilty feeling swirling in his stomach, as hard as he tried not to think about his eleven friend, he just hopped back in to the conversation. When he thought that Draco couldn't look even more uncomfortable, he was surprised to find out that the Slytherin has successfully mastered the art of frowning, showing discomfort of various levels in many different and unique ways, his teeth clenched and he stepped a bit further from Harry, his milky pale hand rubbing at the cuffs of his sleeve. “huh..he died..”
"Full of shit is what you are" Pansy sing-sang. Waving cheerfully from the table as Hermione rolled her eyes. "Tell Draco I said hi!"
“my father saw it, we were visiting him in the ministry that day, Lucious was practically dragged away from his family’s arms..” Harry simply gaped at his friend, Ron was talking softly as if it was a touchy spot for him,his freckled hands tugging at his sleeves “my father hates Lucius Malfoy you know that, but when he saw the look on Draco’s face… he told me: be kind to him, since now he has nothing left”  Ron bit his lower lip, his shoulders rising as he inhaled “it reminded me of us, when Fred was taken away…” his voice broke at that, eyes filling up with tears that for long have been well known “so, i will be kind to him, not because he deserves it you know? he absolutely does not, but… because it’s the right thing to do”  Harry saw fire in Ron’s eyes, he was burning with angering sadness firing him up from inside, helping him grow, a proud smile curled up on Harry’s face, his best friend truly growed.
“Well…. Yeah…” Potter said “things happened.. and we sorta decided to be friends afterwards.”  He pointed over at Draco focusing everyone's attention on him. He coughed, reaching for a green apple in a basket and taking a big bite of it. “Yes. One of the Solus bloomed again”  at that Weasley gasped, jerking his head so fast Draco’s surprised it hadn't rolled off his shoulders, only to be disappointed as he's reminded that he indeed, cannot see the Solus at all. “So now.. two of them bloomed? That's progress! How did it happen?” Hermione asked and suddenly Draco didn't feel like answering. How could he describe it to them? Sleeping with Potter had been really helpful, he was too busy fighting over his blanket than thinking about what happened in the room of requirement, this moment he and Potter shared, Draco hadn't played the piano since it was taken away by the ministry, together with his whole life but then, in that burned down room he found the power to play again. Only Potter had heard him sing, that song from his childhood long long ago, one that followed little Draco through nightmares, which at the time were a monster under his bed and not a worse creature lurking in his house, splashing blood over the walls Draco once used to draw on. Somehow he only wished for Harry to know about such thing, about such details about his life, the ongoing loneliness inside a big house and a crowded school. He felt like Potter could understand him, though coming from a different place, though being a hero in the war instead of a mere coward, Potter didn't laugh and didn't ask questions, they shared a knowing silence together, a silence of two things who know nothing at all. He then took a second bite of his apple, avoiding the question as he chewed. “I went to say goodbye to Crabbe in the room of requirement, in its remains, at least.” He said at last, risking a glance at Neville, who stated blankly into his plate, Draco wondered if he had listened in on their conversation, Potter's words flashing inside his head:
hey guys! i'm sorry it took so long to update, the truth is, i'm not feeling really good lately, also finals are coming aaaahhhhhhh
Draco just gaped, looking at his slice and then at the creature, then back again “I...I think I need to give it to someone.” He muttered, giving Hermione a quick nod before following the creature, who already walked down the hallway. He really felt confused, is it leading him somewhere? Why hadn't it bloomed yet when there's clearly cracks? He carefully pushed through students, trying his best not to drop the pie in the process, only later he realized where the Solus was leading him: Myrtle's bathroom, somehow he always ends up there.
The Slytherin girl opened her mouth and then closed it, confusion shines brightly in her eyes “ and why is that?”
“They bully you” Potter pushed, his eyes locked on the creature on his shoulder which pulled his robe in every possible direction, Draco chuckled “so what are you going to do? You! The all mighty Potter! I bet you're going to laugh!! finally!! Malfoy- the heartless bully gets a taste of his own medicine!” Potter's frown deepened from Draco's words, he visibly flinched “I can help you” he said.
“And you know what's the worst part?”  Malfoy turned to him, his expression so pained Harry himself felt like crying “I thought I deserved it. I thought that that's how it's supposed to be!” His voice broke, reminding Harry more of a hiss than a whisper, one you'd hear from a frightened kitten displaying it's last way of defense in front of a predator.  “I mean- I mean… he gave me all I ever wanted, he bought me all the toys and sent me candy with each Hogwarts letter, he loved me Potter, did he not?” Harry thought he did, each time he'd see Malfoy from across the hall, receiving numerous gifts from his parents on the daily, you'd assume he's nothing but a spoiled child, everyone wished to be loved by their parents like that, but was he truly loved? Harry couldn't say for sure. The Dursleys hated his guts, therefore they abused him, locked him in a cupboard under the stairs, but Malfoy was different, never locked up nor starved, but abused nonetheless. “I.. I don't know..” Harry sighed, did Malfoy really expect an answer? From an orphan no less, but unlike Malfoy, Harry knew his parents loved him, they died protecting him, and while they are still alive, Malfoy never knew if what he received from his parents was true love. “I thought he did.” Malfoy admitted “I was so inspired by him! Ever since I was little I've been told that one day I'll grow up to be a great man like my father, and as his heir, that's all I wished to be… but now? He's locked up in Azkaban for choosing the wrong side in not one but two wars! What a great man he was my ass! now he'll rot there for the rest of his life, and perhaps, if the ministry will feel adventurous, me and my mother will join him soon.”  Harry pushed the Solus off him with great effort, just enough for them to scramble up in his lap, he sat up clumsily, determined to leave them there, not letting their weight return to Malfoy yet.
common room, which is warm and cozy, not like this damn hallway!” Draco spat at him, exasperated to the core. Shooting Potter an extremely ugly sneer he turned around walking to the Slytherin common room with quick steps, Potter just stood there, gaping at him for a second before calling out; “Malfoy! Wait! I changed my mind I'm pretty cold!” Draco ignored him and continued walking. Potter followed him looking like an abandoned puppy, whining like an actual kid. “Oh come on! Draco please~”  he scooted closer, reaching for his hand which Malfoy moved out of his reach swiftly. “Don't call me Draco.” He growled, but Potter, being the annoying Gryffindor he is, didn't waver.
"Like magic?" He looked at her, his mind remembering the image of his father, and how his elegant wand fit in his hands. "That too, you'll do beautiful magic, and play beautiful music with them too."
Also I had a lot of falling offs with my friends and significant others, And the change is so sharp it will take some getting used to.
“Malfoy seems to be quite fidgety doesn't he?”  Ron said during one of their casual breakfasts, without Voldemort around Harry finally got the chance to enjoy the regular school life, with no prophecy nor dark wizard to hunt him and try to take his life he found his days at Hogwarts uneventful, they had their usual lessons, they laid under the tree during breaks, it was nice, Harry really liked it, two weeks flew by without noticing, the now called 'golden trio’ enjoyed their days like they never did before, peacefully.
“Woah you really got beat did you?”  Blaise’s dark skin contrasted beautifully with the white window he was leaning on, his arms folded over his chest, Draco scanned him, his eyes stopping on the green Slytherin tie, Draco looked at his own and smirked before tying it on himself too.
He was falling him, Draco closed his eyes in hope to miss it, the thud of his body crashing against the ground. He wished he didn't hear it, wished that the sounds of piano were strong enough.
“Guess we're not the only ones that noticed” Hermione murmured, tucking her curly hair behind her ear “the crowd really makes the Slytherins look like they don't belong here”
It has been a while since Harry visited the kitchens, ever since Dobby died he tried hard to avoid this place, the guilt swelling up in his stomach each time he remembered his friend running around in these halls, working in this kitchen but not as a slave, but as a free elf. And free he died, buried like an equal near the shell cottage, the soft sand being his bed. Passing through the portrait they entered the well lit interior of the Hogwarts kitchen, swarming with a dozen of house elves cooking and chopping, aggressively preparing for their upcoming meal. The air was filled with all kinds of delicious scents, cooked meat and spices together with the smell of fresh bread just being pulled out of the oven. Hermione breathed in the wonderful smell, smiling widely as she already stepped in approaching the nearest elf.
“Draco..?” His attention snapped back to his friend, who gaped at him, and she wasn't the only one, seemed like the whole great hall stared at him, his eyes locked on a certain someone
With a quick flash of panic Harry considered shoving Malfoy off himself and claim him for abducting him, but then he remembered that he willingly came into his room, even worse,
“Like what?” She spat at him, oh boy, Weasley just dug his own grave, visibly swallowing, Ron looked at Harry for help,who shook his head defensively, he might have dated two girls in his life but it sure didn't help him understand woman, all Ron needed to do is to tell her how much he loves her, something nice, it's not too hard, but again it is Ron Weasley we're talking about.
I also wanted to thank you all for sticking with this fic for so long since this month it became one years since I started writing it, it's always so hard for me to finish stuff and not throwing it away halfway through so I am really proud of myself for writing this fic kinda consistently.
Neville didn't answer,but his eyes were focused, he was listening, so Draco went on. “I.. I tried to come up with excuses for what I did, but the more I thought about it I realized that I was pushing my mistakes on other people… my father might've been shitty, but the one who- who abused you was me.” His words fell heavy, cutting through the silence like a sharp knife with every word, he had never blamed himself for anything, even when he ran away, when he pointed his wand at Albus Dumbledore, he always had someone to blame.
“Hey Hermione?” Not that he cared, it was sheer curiosity, he told himself “have you ever heard about bullying invisible creatures?” she gaped at him, her knowing eyes studying  his expression “nothing I've heard of” she mumbled, chewing on her pie “why?”  for a second he hesitated, but that would be better if he told her “ I don't think Malfoy is just fidgety” he said, “yeah he's just mad” Ron snarled at him, shoving an omelette down his throat “he most definitely is” Ginny remarked, giggling softly, it was nice to see the Weasley's smile, returning to their brother’s grave was especially difficult for them, but it reassured him, seeing those two shades of red sitting down with him in the great hall, Ginny cut her hair short this summer, implying that she's a quidditch  captain now and long hair would only get in the way, but Harry knew she did it because of Fred, trying to process herself that she's stronger now by cutting off the useless locks of hair, being pretty won't bring back her brother, she said, yet Harry thought her beauty could not be defined by hair length.
"You slept like dead mate! When did you return from Hogsmeade?" His best friend stood over his bed with what looked like arms folded over his chest. Ginger head blurring together with all the reds and golds of the Gryffindor house. "Huh? Um.." Harry rubbed his eyes lazily, he really did sleep well, his whole body was thrumming with excitement he hadn't felt in years. "Not too late.. just after curfew I think.." he mumbled, now busy with searching for his glasses. "Now when I think of it..I hadn't seen you at all yesterday" Neville frowned from the room's entrance, one hand already on the door handle.
Draco couldn't ignore the weight climbing on his leg, why are those things so heavy? and why do they cling to Draco? It seemed like Blaise didn't notice them just like Pansy.
“Why all of your clothes are green?” He asked, looking at his sweater suspiciously. Draco just gaped at him, giving him a few minutes so the question would sink in, especially when he's in the Slytherin common room which is (surprise!) Mostly green, before he snarled “why all of your questions stupid?” And pulled his pajamas from under his pillow, suddenly feeling very self conscious. When he originally invited Potter over, he didn't think they would be alone, he also didn't think through the fact that they will have to change in front of each other, he was about to ask Potter if he wants him to leave to for a couple of minutes before getting a flash of bright red boxers, with
“Sorry?! You're sorry?!” Malfoy screamed, pushing more and more creatures onto Harry's frame until the boy couldn't feel his limbs anymore, being crushed up by hideous weight. “Merlin!! I hope you suffocate!!”  And to Malfoy's delight (probably) Harry definitely was, in fact, suffocating.
Who’s intense green eyes glared at him through the whole hall, Draco felt an uncomfortable flip in his stomach,he dropped his gaze, staring at his abused piece of toast “I'm not hungry” he mumbled before standing up and leaving the great hall behind.
"Where is he?" Harry said, a little bit too quickly to his liking. "The hell would I know? I haven't seen him since yesterday, he's probably sulking about Hogsmeade still."
“It will be okay Draco” his mother's soft voice woke him from his daze, Draco's eyes shifted to look at her nape, it seems like their car had stopped, which is funny, since his father would never allow of such disgusting muggle technology, but his father was locked up now, and it doesn't matter what a prisoner thinks about the ones that are free, again, it's funny because after  the war none of them will ever be free no matter if they're behind bars or sitting in a luxurious car like Draco and his mother did, her worries reflected in the front mirror, she looked at her pale son with deep concern while he himself idly leaned on the cold window, he felt like scoffing at her but had no heart to actually do so, his mother has gotten way thinner in the past couple months, the dark circles under her eyes never leaving her, he just couldn't be rude to this woman anymore, nor ever again.
The pride he once had now has been splashed with shame, with blood of his own friends. Why would anyone want to see such thing? Such cruel, hideous thing?
This chapter actually supposed to have way more scenes in it and while writing I suddenly noticed that I passed my 6k mark by 2000 words!! So I decided it's better if I'd divide this chapter and put all the other scenes in the next one, I have officially started my last year of high school?! Hope I won't be too busy and continue uploading as quickly as I can. Also the wordcount is around 60k now?? Which is absolutely insane!! Thank you so much for keeping in touch and reading this fic, it's super dear to my heart! <3
“Enough!” He yelled,his hero persona not leaving him quite yet, and as expected the whole crowd was now gaping at him
With a flick of her wand, two tea cups flew gracefully towards the headmistress's table, landing with a soft thud. “Do sit down, I would like to chat with you” she said, sitting down in her big chair, nodding he sat down himself, staring at his cup of tea Instead, McGonagall took her time before speaking, she casually sipped her tea and then placed it on the wooden table softly
“YOU'RE WHAT?!” The idiot screeched, and Draco was glad he thought about putting silencing charms over them before going with Potter
Harry quickly packed up his things and rushed up stairs, he put on his riding gear which just consisted of different pants a shorter robe and soft leather gloves. First Years weren’t allowed to bring their own brooms and Harry wasn’t the most excited to be using Hogwarts century old brooms, but anything that would get him zooming through the air would have to suffice.
Draco hurriedly breaks apart from Harry and takes in burning breathes. This wasn't what he had planned, his mind raced with things to say, but his tongue could not move to form any words.
“How was your sleep Draco?” Harry asked, spreading some marmalade onto his toast, Draco watched on, avoiding looking at Harrys face.
“This took a lot of persuading from Dumbledore you know, so I hope that you’ll accept the position.” McGonagall said.
Everyone split off to their respective dormitories, Harry and Ron waved goodbye to Hermione and hurried up the stairs with the other boys.
I sighed and rubbed my palms over my face. "No, I don't think that you are incompetent without me, its just were partners and I can't just leave you like that."
The rest of the night ensued with the party and Harry exhaustingly mingling with the others, however it was nice to catch up on with Tomas and Seamus for he had not seen them for a while. Ginny, he mostly avoided as he had not really spoken to her much since they broke up after only a year of dating, however he decided to stop being an arsehole and go and speak to her.
“Potter, may I ask what you are doing wandering the halls this early in the morning?” Snape spoke like there was a constant stick up his arse, Harry thought mildly. But he bit his tongue and simply just shrugged his shoulders.
His dream was once again invaded by the unknown blond. Harry moaned and groaned as his skin caught alit with how softly those lips kissed him. Harrys hands instantly went down to the raging hard on he had, soon his underwear became spoiled. Harry awoke, his eyes groggy. He groaned and shrugged the underwear off discarding them off the side of the bed and falling back to sleep.
Draco sighed again and looked into the aged green eyes of Rosmerta, he knew he could trust her, but he also knew that her tongue wasn't always held. He weighed his options and decided that he really needed someone to talk to about this and Neville or Zabini or Pansy weren't his best options right now. “Harry confessed his feelings for me.” He sighed into his drink, letting his forehead bang down onto the bar.
He had not told anyone yet, he found it slightly embarrassing not being able to go home, he decided to keep it to himself until he could no longer do so.
Harry got out of bed too and tried to think of a nightmare that he could of possibly be having, but he couldn’t remember anything at all. Feeling perplexed he went to Ron’s bed and shook him awake; Ron wouldn’t be impressed if he missed breakfast.
Ron looked away from the window, his face still full of excitement. “Well yeah I’m going to miss them obviously, but I’m more excited than anything.”
Ron gave Harry a surprised look but said nothing against it, so Harry started his way towards the Slytherin table. Some noticed that he was on his way and started murmuring with each other, Malfoy seemed engrossed in something and he had not yet noticed. Harry feeling brave casually plopped himself next to Malfoy.
Harry didn’t want to hurt Draco in any way, but he also didn't want to see Draco as he wasn't sure how he was going to react knowing that Draco was eventually going to reject him. Harry took the entrance down to the kitchen and was generously served with lunch by the house elves. He ate at a table that they set up for him and Harry looked over some work for his next lesson.
Harry turned and watched, shocked that Snape hadn’t tried to make any sort of nasty remark or dig out some sort of punishment that he did not deserve. Harry however thought best to listen to Snape and start heading to breakfast, but then a hand wrapped around his forearm.
“You really have the knack for wandless magic don’t you?” Draco noticed, he had seen Harry use wandless magic quite a few times and it still amazed him, he who prided himself in his magical ability couldn’t master even the simplest of wandless magic.
"Mate, I really think you just need to take like the week off." I sighed and leaned back in my chair.
They made their way to the Great Hall, stomachs once again rumbling with hunger. Harry wandered his eyes over to the Slytherin table to find Draco, which he did, however the table was pretty full and Harry wasn’t stupid enough to go wander over to a table full of Slytherins. The trio all sat together and began piling their plates with lunch.
Harry tried his best to pay attention, he read most of the chapter that they were assigned and scribbled down the details for the first essay that they had to write, but his head kept replaying what he had said to Snape and how much trouble he would get in from Remus if his uncles were contacted. He smirked at the thought of Sirius finding out, knowing that Sirius would find it funny, but then felt ashamed knowing the face of disappointment that Remus would give him. He hated making Remus disappointed.
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, he had never read those books before. “Am I?” He finally said.
"I hope my students will take me well." Harry voiced his concern, he knew his students would like him, however he also wanted to be treated as a professor not as a hero.
Final after a breathes moment, he closed his hand against the cold smooth metal, the snitch fought for a few fluttering moments than became still against his sweaty palm. Elation spread throughout his cheeks as he broke out into a wide smile. He slowed down to an almost complete stop and let himself fall backawards towards the ground, almost freefalling, but in enough control to do a side menavour in order to right himself before he hit the ground.
"Yeah you did." Draco nodded. Draco without realising roamed the taught and muscular figure of Harry. Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco due to the paused silence. Draco realising he'd been caught, quickly looked away, a hot blush beginning to rise up his neck.
Flitwick eyes him with an all knowing look and Draco avoids looking at him for too long. Breakfast ends with Draco having barely touched his food. Draco tries to act normal during his lesson but he can't help but feel off and his mind keeps wandering to Harry and that cold emotionless face.
“Five points taken from Gryffindor, if you aren’t injured you best go to Gryffindor tower where the feast will continue.”
“But wont people get mad about it?” Harry asked, he typically liked to stay away from situations that gave him a great amount of attention.
“Oh that sucks, well we’ll just have to deal with it won’t we.” He nudged him with his shoulder, hoping to cheer him up.
The person did pause and stepped slightly into the room, they seemed satisfied as they looked around so they closed the door and walked away. Both Draco and Harry released their breathe, their hearts were bounding so much that Harry was sure that Draco could hear his. Harry stepped away and giggled quietly, the adrenalin still rushing through his veins, Draco too started giggling and soon the pair were in fits of laughter that they had to try and keep quiet and every time they looked at each other or snorted or made a weird noise they were set off again. Eventually Harrys cheeks and stomach ached too badly that he had to force himself to calm down before he pulled a muscle. He took his glasses off and wiped away the tears that had formed, Draco too was wiping his eyes with his sleeve.
“Thanks.” Harry spoke absently and picked up a sandwich. His eyes still clouded with whatever he was thinking about. Draco wanted to desperately know what was making Harry think so deep in thought that he didn’t even pay attention to Draco, he was usually so attentive to him.
Morning lessons was their first lesson of Potions. Ron complained about it all morning, but frankly Harry was pretty excited, he wanted to see Draco again and he’d always been the most interested in learning Potions when Remus was teaching him. Harry walked into the classroom feeling confident and happy, but when he looked at Professor Snape his mood immediately plummeted, the man looked like he was in the most fowlest of moods.
“Woah you okay love?” Sirius asked, he quickly waved his wand over the water and settled it. Remus chuckled and took the pot off the heat.
"I didn't have a nightmare Harry." My heart races, my mind is screaming at me not to tell him, but my heart is cursing back that I should. Harrys thick eyebrows furrow, he looks at me confused. "Then what did you dream about that made you cry like that?"
"Feel free to sit anywhere." Draco called out, he had disappeared into an adjoining room. Harry sat down onto one of the small but comfortable arm chairs and tried not to make it obvious that he was looking around the room extensively. Draco returned into the room carrying a tray of tea and biscuits. Harry welcomed the tea which warmed his somewhat cold hands.
Professor Flitwick then gracefully jumped down from the pile of books he was standing on and circled around the room, making small comments to students and helping any others that had any questions. Harry found the page and read on the charm, finding it mildly interesting. He had read charms books before and already knew about most basic charms, he was going to answer the question Flitwick had asked, but Hermione’s arm shot in the air quicker than lightning besides he wanted Hermione to have her moment.
Harry when he thought about it, liked that he was influencing Draco to be nicer, he didn’t know too much about Draco’s upbringing. However, for what he could tell so far his parents didn’t do much in terms of teaching him good morals and having equal respect for others, Harry knew that he couldn’t change Draco in a heartbeat and he didn’t want to change Draco tremendously, he just wanted to make him a slighter nicer person.
I awoke with Draco wrapped around my arms. God how I missed this feeling. The birds sang their lullaby outside and the breeze made the trees whisper, the peace of the morning was a feeling that I never wanted to let go of. I looked down to my love, his hair laid across the pillow, his face soft and gentle. Draco was always at the most peace when he was asleep, well at least when he was asleep with me.
Harry sighed as he brushed his fingertips against the smooth stone of the castle walls, hundreds of years of students doing the same had weathered down the stone, very tiny valleys had even appeared, grooves that fit his fingertips just right.
The man looked towards me again. "These birds are hard to tame you see, they don't take kindly to us wizards."
I knew the dangers of him being an Auror, how he may never return home, how he could come home and never be the same again, but I also knew that I would love him no matter what would happen in that Auror world of his.
“Well I guess not, but I thought we weren’t allowed to use magic outside of Hogwarts.” Harry said feeling a bit stupid.
“Yeah, he said I could start reading them now that I’m nearly eleven.” Harry spoke, he shuffled around in the bean bag until he was content with the position he found. Sirius finally found the book and took it out, he opened it briefly and was a little surprised to find how complex it looked.
Sorry for the late update!! Ive got two more weeks left of school until christmas holidays, allowing me to have a more regular update. Hope you guys enjoy this chapter :)
The shop owner waved his arms. "No no no, you don't owe me, take this bird as my congratulations." I started, wanting to fight back but Draco softly took my arm.
Harry went to the kitchen where a black-banded owl was sleeping in its cage. "Wake up Blue." Harry softly spoke, Blue opened its large eyes, his large and very rare blue eyes blinked back at him. "Can you send this to Draco Malfoy please." Blue plucked the letter from Harrys hand and rubbed the top of his head softly onto Harrys hand and took flight out the open window.
Harry mumbled and turned violently in his sleep, Draco knew this was a sign that he was having a nightmare, Draco knew the signs all too well.
Harry sat down at his work desk in his room and tried to force himself to do some work, he had lessons to plan and homework to create. The bell rang for lunch and Harrys stomach grumbled in appreciation. Harry quickly packed up his things for next lesson so he would not need to come back to his room to get it, his room wasn’t exactly close to his classroom. Harry quickly rushed to the great hall, hoping that no one had sat next to Draco yet and he didn’t know if Draco was going to keep a seat for him.
“Yeah we did it Hermione!” They both laughed and continued eating, Ron just looked at both of them quizzically but made no comment.
The days passed and Remus emerged from the bedroom the day after his transformation looking slightly pale but refreshed. Harry soon emerged from the fireplace coughing slightly as some ash got in his nose.
Harry's mouth opens and closes like a fish gasping for air. He doesn't know how to respond. Was he that obvious about his feelings for Draco? Does the whole school know? At that thought Harry's face gushes with warmth.
Harry felt slightly lighter once they finally got the other side of the shore, the castle was even bigger up close, and Harry was starting to feel overwhelmed. Harry being the gentleman he was raised to be took Hermione’s hand and helped her out of the boat, she blushed lightly and murmured a thank you.
Harry packed his bag as the bell rang, the class left leaving the door wide open. Harry sighed, what a weird lesson. His head buzzed, was the whole school really wanting Draco and him to get together? Did he want to be with Draco like that?
Draco would not be returning to the Manor for the Christmas holiday. This statement continuously played in his mind since he received the letter from his mother two days before.
"It's a boy Draco, he's a boy!" He cried, the baby continued to cry, Harry carefully handed him over to me and laid him onto my bare chest, he instantly stopped crying and fell asleep on me. One of the nurses came up to me and patted my hand.
I sighed and leaned back into the couch, rubbing the palm of my hand down my face. The one who was meant to be the complete hot-headed git had made a logical and perfectly valid statement.
“Sorry Draco, I’m just feeling a bit off today.” Harry awkwardly smiled, he really didn’t have any other explanation for why he was acting so weird, he just hoped that Draco wouldn’t get offended.
Harry slowly climbed up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower, looking forward to the Charms essay that he was about to start. Hermione was in the common room working on her essay too, but Ron was nowhere to be seen. Harry plopped on a couch opposite to Hermione’s and sighed.
“Darling, I have been observing people for decades, i can tell that Harry adores you I was just waiting for the day that he would finally confess.”
Harry with no choice now but to follow McGonagall nodded his head and obeyed. McGonagall lead the way and the bell rang.
“What?” Harry exclaimed. Loudly enough that he had called the attention of most of the other professors, and even some of the students closest to their table.
"It's okay, we've almost caught all the runaway deatheaters, however there are still a few that are unaccounted for unfortunately." His eyebrows burrowed, thinking about those deatheaters made him ponder whether or not it was right for him to leave the Aurors.
“Nah they’re just bullies.” Ron chuckled, Harry widened his eyes at Ron, he had expected for Ron to lose his temper with Hermione.
The crack echoed around the empty apartment, Harry stumbled slightly forward, perhaps he had too much champagne. Draco chuckled and pulled him up right. "All right love?" Harry chuckled back and stood up right. "Yeah one too many champagnes." Draco tutted, "Of course you did." He shook his head and made way to their bedroom, Sirius curled on their bed opened one eye to see who was waking him from his slumber than closed it again. Draco sighed, no matter how many times he told Sirius off for being on their bed he continued to sleep there. Draco began to wonder if he was doing it to make him annoyed on purpose, but this night he was in too much of a good mood to kick him off.
Harry shook his head from his stupor, "Draco I've got to meet Hagrid is it okay to meet up later?" Draco nodded his head and stood aside for Harry. Harry smiled at him and rushed off, time was wearing thin.
I slowly took the covers off and slipped out of the bed, I picked up a pair of underwear and slipped them on, I tiptoed out of the bedroom and made way to the kitchen. I quickly began to make some breakfast for the both of us. Tonight, was an important night and I wanted to keep the mood light. The bacon crackled away on the stove when Draco emerged from the bedroom, he only had one of my shirts hanging off his slim yet sexual body, he yawned and scratched his bed hair.
“What you guys are?” Harry looked around the classroom and found that they all nodded their heads in agreement. Harry cleared his throat to try and bring back some professionalism back into the classroom. “Well I really think you shouldn’t be wanting two of your professors to... hook up, now let’s get back to work shall we?” Harry glared at Rebecca especially.
No one knew how to respond to this statement, but Sirius and Remus did not care for how Harry survived, they were just extremely thankful that he had.
“I don’t know why you would even want to try being friends with that.” Ron spoke, his face now less red.
“Can I ask what is so amusing Ms Lostring?” Harry crossed his arms and took a firm stance in front of her desk, the class looked on amused. They really saw Professor Potter this Professor like. “Well I heard some slytherin girls this morning talking how they saw you come out of Professor Malfoys room.” She giggled, her face bright red. The rest of the class then broke out in giggles. Harry opened his mouth to try and defend himself however he saw no way out.
Harry laughed at Rons stupidity, “just talking jeez, what you all happy for? You’re never happy in the mornings.”
Draco skips the morning shower and casts a scourgify charm on himself, careful not to cast it on his face, he’s not so particular about having soap in his mouth this morning. As there still is a few more hours until breakfast Draco tries to find something to do but soon realises that he did all the work that he needed to do last night. He thinks maybe a trip to The Three Broomsticks would help waste away the hours.
“But you couldn’t and I know that Draco.” Harry replied, his heart aching for Draco. Harry knew the guilt that Draco was harbouring and Harry, for the first time in his life felt like someone would understand the pain and guilt that he too felt.
“We had to go back to the tower to grab a quill I’d forgotten.” Ron quickly jumped in, barely saving Harrys neck.
Harry crashed into his room, shrugging off his shirt and shaking on a new one that he picked off the floor, casting a cleaning charm would do enough to clean it. He quickly pulled on his robes that he also cast a cleaning charm on, wandlessly making everything go into his bag, his grabbed the bag that zoomed towards him once packed and he rushed out the door. This time remembering to close it.
Draco looked at Harry and Harry looked at Draco, the air around them almost felt alive with electricity, Harry didn’t know what was making him do it but he suddenly found himself leaning closer to Draco, his eyes not once leaving his. Then a knock came at the door, the moment broke and Harry sprang away from Draco, a small blush brightening the tips of his ears.
"Good morning good sir." He nodded his head politely than his eyes fixated on the owl. "Oh, I see you have found yourself a phoenix owl."
“Ron!” Hermione hissed out, quickly stopping the ink well tipping, than her attention turned to Harry.
Eventually the three had to half run to class, they got stuck on the stairs on the way, this particular stair lead to the third floor corridor and Harry was tempted to open the door and explore, but Hermione reminded him that Dumbledore had warned against it. Harry listened to Hermione but gave that special look to Ron that said they would explore it later, Ron quickly nodded.
Professor Flitwick smiled, “Correct five points to Gryffindor, okay everyone turn to page ten and do the reading on the charm, once you have completed that I would like you to practice the wording and the wand movements for the charm, try not to aim at anything whilst doing this please.”
"We have other things to buy." He said. At first, I didn't pick up on what he meant, I simply thought potion ingredients, however we took a turn, a turn that I hadn't taken before, and posters of babies hit me in the face.
"Its okay Hagrid." Harry wheezed, trying to get the half giant to release him from the suffocating hold.
The elf nodded and was about to leave, but Harry felt bad for the lack of manners so he hurriedly said, “just anything you can get please.” He smiled, sending her an apologetic smile. The elf a little bit surprised by the sudden use of manners smiled at him and popped away.
They didn’t speak for a while, Harrys head running in circles thinking why he felt these weird and confusing feelings for Draco, he had never felt like this for anyone else before and he didn’t know how to make sense of them.
Harry felt like strolling through the halls of the quiet and cold castle, something nostalgic was bubbling in the pit of his stomach, a walk felt in order.
Harry looked up to him, his green eyes swimming in thought. “It’s not that it’s just, I don’t want to be put onto a higher pedestal than I’m already on just because I have an ability for wandless magic.”
Harry awoke with a gasp. His heart was pounding and his whole body was shivering. He looked around feeling disoriented and quickly remembered that he was in the nurses wing.
“Woah there, I wasn’t aware that this was yours!” Zabini held his ground still wearing that smug smirk.
AN* lowkey wanna keep this here as its what we Australians use for ‘skipping class’ adds a little touch of me in it I guess, btw I used this totally unironically I’ve only just realised whilst editing XD
“Hey.” Harry breathes out, he tried to make it so that he didn't sound anxious, however his heart pounding told him the opposite.
"I've been pretty good, training is going good with Pomona." Neville smiled. "come I'll see you off." Neville and Harry walked along aside each other, catching up on the past few years.
“Soo what are you going to do about Ron, because Harry if you haven’t noticed yet I think he might be a little bit jealous of me.”
“Come we better head back before we are late to class.” Harry started to head for the door and Ron followed, they walked in silence, their brains still processing what they had just experienced.
Harry closed his eyes and thought about what Draco had said, once he could think about it, he nodded, his smell smelt really nice.
Draco looked vulnerable and Harry’s heart ached. He knew that he would’ve upset Draco and now he really regrets his stupid and rash decision. “Harry I…” Draco starts but Harry stops him.
“It’s just…” Draco started, Harry gave Draco a small smile, trying to encourage him to continue. “It’s just I feel like everything that happened that night was my fault, I let Bellatrix in, I let the Carrows in, I just… I wish I fought back more you know.” He looked into his now lukewarm tea, not wanting to see the expression that Harry would be holding.
All the first years quickly clambered out of their seat and began to follow the two Heads of Houses. Ron, Harry and Hermione walked with each other, not speaking and just absorbing the castle. Each wall was covered with portraits of wizards and witches, each portrait moved and waved at those pasting. Harry wanted to stop and talk to some of them, but knew that if he did, he would get left behind and become impossibly lost.
Harry took a deep breathe, looked to his broom with a firm determination for it to rise into his hand then said with a clear and solid voice. “Rise up!” The broom instantly shot into his hand.
“No, I don’t think so, I don’t really know a lot about Dragons, but I know what one creature that would love to burn down a city to sleep on a mountain of gold.” Remus smirked.
"Yes Harry of course it's going to be painful, I'm practically growing a new organ." He growled. The pain seemed to have subsided, he stood up straight and slowly made his way to the bed.
"Umm yeah you can come in." Draco moved against the door to let Harry through. Harry gave him a small smile and stepped in. "You can sit on my bed." Harry looked around and guessed it would be the one by the window. Draco watched intently as Harry made to his bed and sat down. Harry sitting so casually on his bed was a sight that he thought he would never see.
"Harry." He shook his shoulder gently and received no response. This time he shook him a bit harder, this gathered a response from him and his eyes shot open, the green in them had darkened with fear. Draco breathed out in relief and took a step away to let Harry correct himself.
Draco chuckled lightly and placed his tea down onto the tray. “It’s getting quite late we should probably turn in.” Harry took this as his cue to also place down his barely touched tea and stand up.
After most of the class had finished, the rest of the lesson was spent just talking. Quirrell didn’t seem to mind the chatter and no one was really interested in him anymore. The bell went and everyone left quickly, wanting to get out of the boring classroom and discuss Quirrell without the fear of being overheard.
Ron soon was sitting with the hat on his head, his eyes squished shut, Harry knew that he was desperately praying for Gryffindor too, his whole family was in Gryffindor. The hat same as Hermione did not take long for it to bellow Gryffindor. Ron beamed and rushed to the table, sitting next to other first years who had already been sorted. His twin brothers rushed over and attacked him with head rubs and congratulatory punches. Harry was now desperate to join his friends.
“Yeah it was mostly gibberish but you woke us all up, except for stone head over there.” Dean said, and Harry turned to the still snoring Ron.
“Welcome to the team Mr Potter.” McGonagall nodded, trying to keep her face professional, but Harry knew that she was elated on the inside.
Pansy snickered. "See this is the perfect opportunity for you." Draco turned to her and glared at her with his Malfoy glare. She smirked at him with those plump lips of hers before Draco admitted defeat. "I'm going to my room." He grumbled before stomping up the stairs, he faintly heard Harry ask them what his problem was, his answer was a giggle from Pansy before she too scampered up the stairs.
Hermione nodded her head, “yeah everyone seems to be, thankyou though.” She said chuckling nervously.
“Was I interrupting something?” He questioned. Harry opened his mouth, but Draco beat him to it. “It’s okay Neville we were just talking, what can I help you with?”
Sirius finally left his study, coerced by the smell of lunch. Sirius smiled up at him and began plating the lunch. The three all ate the table, Harry still enthusiastically asking questions and Remus enthusiastically answering back. Sirius watched on with a soft warmth in his eyes.
“Very well Mr Potter you can head straight back to your dorms, take this note with you so you don’t get in trouble for being out of curfew, but I warn you, you go straight back to your dorm.” Snape gave him a ‘I mean business look’ Harry gulped and quickly stepped forward to take the note from Snape.
"How are you feeling being back in the castle?" Draco asked casually. Harry took another sip of tea to give him time to think. How did he really feel about being in the castle? The feast had really warmed his stomach and warmed his chest, so right now he was feeling okay, but later he wasn't quite sure how he would be feeling.
Moody was the next one to enter the room, words were still not spoken between any of these men, it was painfully obvious would had occurred and no questions were needed to be asked, but then Moody spotted the sleeping baby in Sirius arms, his eyes widened.
"Sorry Harry I warned Ron that you might get freaked out cause we had to break your wards but he said it would be fine." Hermione punched Ron in the arm. "You freaked him out Ron!" She yelled at him.
Ron concentrating on the levitating club nodded and Hermione gushed. Harry turned back to the troll, the troll still angry but now confused by his lack of club looked around, for a brief moment he was confused but quickly he turned his attention back onto the three children.
wow this was fun to write, hope you guys enjoyed this which i pulled an all nighter to write, im going to sleep now XD
Sirius took a moment to think, “hmm don’t think we have hobbits no… but maybe you could ask Uncle Remus when you get back from the Weasleys.”
Harry and Draco walked side by side and Harry soon realised that Draco that was taking him to Harrys classroom. “Umm Draco.” Harry started, Draco did not turn to look at him, however Harry knew that he was listening. “Draco can you tell me what’s up with Slytherin and Gryffindor at the moment?”
“Just do it!” Harry yelled. Ron confused flicked his quickly away from the club, ending the spell. The club now following the laws of physics fell, smashing onto the trolls head with a great, plonk! The troll roared, but it quickly stopped, swayed slightly and started to fall face first, Harry Ron and Hermione quickly ran out of the way or they were to be squished.
Draco laughed, “not my fault you weren’t paying attention, and anyways you didn’t answer my question, how was it?”
“Yeah was just thinking back to when we told Harry about us that’s all.” He said, draining the water into the sieve watching the pasta plop into it.
sorry this is not an update, but i took a break because uni started and i just needed to get all in the pattern of it, but now i’m feeling ready to continue writing this. i also just reread the last two books and am itching to write, hopefully new chapter up tomorrow or the next day! :)
Draco nodded his head and did not continue to speak. Harry sat their in silence, contempt with watching Draco continue his cooking. Draco finally turned around and placed the casserole dish with the pie in the middle of the table, Draco slapped Harry’s hand as he reached for the spoon to dish himself. “You’re my guest and that means i serve you.” Harry grunted and took his hand away, he really hated to be the one to be that had to sit still whilst others did it for you. However, homework was an exception.
“Okay Mr Potter about time that you head back to class, ive held you long enough.” McGonagall waved her wand and brandished out a note for Harry to carry to his professor.
Harry didn’t know what to make of this, Draco finally felt so comfortable and safe around Harry that he let the one thing that was protecting him from physical harm to fall away. Harry wanted to keep feeling this euphoria for the rest of his life. He decided that perhaps he too should stay the night, he wanted to wake up and see Draco’s face first in the morning. Harry cuddled further into the armchair and quickly lowered the fire with a charm. Harry during his time in the Aurors had quickly mastered the use of wandless magic, something that very few could do apparently.
Harry nodded, "sure tea sounds great." Draco almost let out a sigh of relief and opened the door. Harry nearly awed as he entered the room, nothing of it screamed Draco Malfoy, however at the same time it did. Harry really couldn't make it what he was quite feeling looking around Draco's room.
Harry once again nodded his head with understanding, he was beginning to think that perhaps something happened to his tongue or his brain rather because he couldn’t think of a single thing to say to Snape.
Harry looked around but there was no sign of Pomfrey, feeling restless he quickly got out of bed. He didn’t know what time it was, but he felt that it was much past lunch time. Harry grabbed his wand from the nightstand where Hermione had placed it and made his way towards Gryffindor Tower, hoping that Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t be angry that he was taking his leave without her permission.
Harry and Draco did not talk a lot, the most they talked was when Harry returned his wand to him with a blush splotching his face, even when he defended him at his trial they barely talked. Now they had come to a somewhat truce between each other, and not long ago they had begun using their first names to call each other. However, the usual banter and snide remarks still continued, though not as crude and harmful as before.
“Oh, so you want someone to put up with your snooty poshness?” Harry said, laughing and putting the laptop gently on the floor, and sitting up.
“who’s that, harry? He’s looking at you like he wants to eat you” Luna said in her soft, lilting voice, pointing at a figure stalking out of the hall.
It is quite bad. We have been together two months now, and we were seen by a stray wizard whilst on a date in muggle London. We were having dinner at a small east-African restaurant in Brixton, and when I woke up this morning a picture of us was the front page of the Prophet. As much as it hurts to see our fragile bubble burst so expectedly, the photo is lovely. My head is tilted backwards, by face lit up with laughter, and Potter is looking at me with so much affection in his eyes it makes my heart ache. He is smiling his soft smile that is reserved for me, Luna and Hermione. I feel so lucky to rank on that list.
“hello boys! I hope you are ready for a catwalk because I bought Potter some delectable pieces today” Pansy said, motioning to Harry to but the bags down.
He and Harry hadn't had a proper conversation since their first in the sitting room after Sirius had gone, but Harry soon went back to the cool indifference of before, and Draco felt a fool for ever wishing that Harry would want to be his friend. In fact, it almost felt as if Harry was putting even more distance between them, as if regretting ever having a real conversation with Draco.
Harry sent the letter off, and received a short note of confirmation and thanks in return. He wondered what to bake, but ultimately settled on chocolate fudge cake; Ron would find it hard to be angry if there was chocolate fudge cake involved. Saturday came, and Harry was just getting Teddy up from his nap when he distantly heard the floo from downstairs. He yelled “up here Draco” before desperately wrestling Teddy into his outfit. For an infant, Teddy had a powerful kick. He was losing a fight with a near-new-born when Draco wandered in, in muggle clothes again, to Harry’s repeated astonishment. Only now did Harry realise he hadn’t yet changed and was in pyjama trousers with holes in and a t shirt that sported some baby vomit on the shoulder from earlier. His face burned in embarrassment, but he guessed that this is what parenting is. Still fighting his godson, he said “he’s being really difficult, so I haven’t changed yet. Hope you don’t mind that I’m covered in baby sick. Its basically just milk, right?” he chuckled. He was not expecting Draco’s reaction “oh god if he’s sick why haven’t you taken him to saint mungo’s? Harry?? He’s clearly not well!” yelled Draco, rushing behind Harry to look at Teddy, who gurgled at the new visitor. “what? Draco no that’s just a thing babies do. They vomit sometimes its normal. Its technically not even vomit, it’s just milk he’s spat back up because he didn’t want it.” Harry said. He turned to Draco. “seriously, if I thought even for a minute that he was in danger he would have the best medical care the world has to offer.” Harry said, before turning back to Teddy and cooing over him while doing up the poppers on his onesie. “you just like to make me smell of sick don’t you! Don’t you!” Harry burbled in baby-speak, before picking him up and handing him to a speechless Draco. “apologies Harry. I wasn’t trying to be accusatory. I just don’t know how babies work” “it’s fine, Draco. I was terrified the first time it happened too. Can you hold him and just wait in here while I get changed?” Harry gave him the baby without waiting for an answer, before pulling off his t-shirt as he left the room.
“I wanted to ask how I can post things home, and also if it would maybe be possible for my friend Pansy to come up for a weekend? I totally understand if she can’t stay though, I appreciate that I am here to work, not spend time off with friends.”
“Shit, shit wait wait” he says, fumbling in the pocket of his trousers. Harry always wears suits, never robes to these things, insisting that if he’s going he’s going to be comfortable.
“It wasn't the best, but you’re making up for it, and I didn't have many friends back home, I wasn't exactly the nicest person at school, so I’m used to entertaining myself, and there’s a lot of books here”
The floo chimed as he whisked his scones out the oven and Molly came bustling through with a sleeping Teddy in her arms. She carefully strapped him into his highchair, before wordlessly helping to set the table for Andromeda’s arrival. It was at times like these that harry almost forgot that Molly had not raised him since birth. Despite Harry having known Molly for less time than he did not know her, she acted as if she had been there all his life. He smiled at her, boxing up a few of the scones for her to take home. Just as she was about to leave, he decided to ask her about his decision on Narcissa. “Molly. I thought that some familial support might help Andy heal. I uh, I invited Narcissa and Malfoy for tea on Wednesday. Even if Andy wants nothing to do with them, they’re still Teddy’s family and I want them in his life if he’s open to it. But do you think I should tell Andy I reached out, and that she should speak to Narcissa, or ask Narcissa to reach out to her when I meet with them?” he asked. Molly beamed. “Harry you sweet forgiving boy. How lovely for you to extend such an olive branch and think of Teddy in that way. As for Andy, I would maybe mention you reached out to them on teddy’s behalf, but not mention that you did it for her too. Wait for her reaction before telling her to speak to Mrs Malfoy.” Replied Molly, brushing a hand down Harry’s cheek before turning back to the floo. Teddy woke up then, and Harry busied himself preparing his milk and a small bowl baby food, thoughts of the black sisters and Malfoy gone from his head for the time being. Much to his disappointment, not that he would ever show it, Andromeda seemed even deeper in grief when she came over. She was spacey, and even though she held Teddy in her lap, she barely played with him, and responded to everything Harry said with a vague ‘that’s nice dear’. Harry hoped that the topic of her estranged sister would snap her out of her reverie. “I wrote to Narcissa Malfoy.” He blurted. She looked up; confusion written all over her face. “she’s Teddy’s great-aunt, and Draco is his cousin, so invited them to meet him. I want Teddy to know all his family.” He explained, suddenly scared she would see this as a betrayal and not the helping hand Harry intended it to be. “oh. I so loved Cissa when we were girls. We united against Bella’s cruelty as children. I miss her often” she responded, in an airy way that reminded Harry so much of Luna. This was a good sign though, he thought. That she was reflecting on good memories of Narcissa, and using a girlhood nickname. “would you be open to mending that bridge” Harry asked, hoping for nonchalance but probably coming across like an interviewer. Andromeda pondered this, playing mindlessly with Teddy’s wispy hair. “I think, maybe I would. If she would want me back. She cut me out, not the other way round. If she were to express a desire to become sisters again, I would consider it” she said. Harry inwardly whooped for joy. Outwardly, he offered Andy a soft smile. He then got up to put Teddy down for his nap, before leading Andy into the living room for their tea. They chatted idly for an hour, before she left, giving him a soft kiss on the cheek before flooing home.
“Shut up Harry, you know it’s impossible to say no to mum.” Ron groaned. The suit was nice- plain black with a well-tailored jacket. It was only that the shirt was a maroon and green paisley that hurt your eyes if you looked directly at it.
“we look happy” I say instead. He nods, smiling at me as if he knows what I was going to say. it’s too early for love, even if I suspect that I am feeling it.
Shaking it off, determined to enjoy the end of his birthday, Draco tugged Pansy into the kitchen where Sirius was standing, leaning against the kitchen counter with a wine bottle in hand. Upon arrival, Remus, Draco and Pansy were all handed thin-stemmed crystal wine glasses and Sirius poured them each a hefty amount, giving Draco the most.
Draco was fixated by the sweat running down the golden-brown column of Harry’s neck as he sang impossibly high “Galileo, Galileo figaro”
‘oh but she loves, like sleep to the freezing. Sweet and right and merciful I’m all but washed in the tide of her breathing’
“I know, Harry, I know. You did nothing wrong, and she’ll get over it. She’ll be back to school at the end of this summer, and she’ll be out of your hair.” Sirius soothed.
When they had finished eating, Hermione dragged Draco out of the kitchen before Harry had the chance to say anything to her, and back to the cottage, where they went back to getting to know each other a bit better. Draco was learning that Hermione was quite a tactile person, like Pansy. She was always touching him, whether she was hanging her legs over his, or resting her head on his shoulder, or playing with his fingers while she spoke. It was nice. Her touch was reassuring.
Not knowing what to do with himself, Draco walked back to the cottage, where he dramatically flopped down onto the bed and hoped and prayed that today had marked the beginning of some sort of… something between him and Harry. Something that was a bit warmer than the cool indifference of before.
“you have us too, Sirius. Like it or not you’re part of the family now” Ron said, grinning up at Sirius.
Draco looked sweet when he was asleep, thought Harry. He could definitely see the physical attractiveness of the lithe blond. He was somewhat shorter than Harry, which Harry found endearing. Draco sighed against him, a pale hand clutching at Harry’s t-shirt. When harry was sure he was asleep, he slipped out again, and went back downstairs. He was impressed to see Pansy, Blaise and Seamus and Dean getting on remarkably well in the absence of the people that had connected them together.
Any lingering hatred or jealousy Draco felt for the golden trio and the bond they shared disappeared in that moment. How could he do anything but admire a friendship so secure you could hold your best friend’s girlfriend so closely as you both prayed for his safe recovery. Though, he supposed, Hermione was not Ron’s girlfriend to Harry, she was a sister to him just as much as Ron was a brother, and despite the relationship that should have cleaved the three apart, they seemed somehow even stronger.
“I know, darling. That’s the point of it” she yelled back, and he was chuckling as Draco walked into the room. In a tennis skirt. Harry’s jaw dropped.
“Yea, it’s just nice to meet new people, make new mates and stuff” Harry said, before turning and smiling at Draco.
“Ah. Well our Ginny’s nearly as tall as Harry now, and skinny as you, so it’s no wonder they fit. They’ll do you all right while you’re ‘ere, I suppose. Keep them ones on and I’ll bag up the rest for ya.”
That was one thing Draco hadn’t missed. He hated them for their noise, their all-consuming presence. However, weak as he is, he couldn’t help but seek Harry in the throng. His eyes roamed over the mountains of muscle before alighting on their target. He was in baggy, straight legged light blue jeans and a massively over-sized crewneck sweatshirt. He looked as if he had been catapulted straight out of the nineties, and fuck if it didn’t look fantastic on him.
Even if I know that I am feeling it, as I watch Potter drink the rest of my coffee like he does every morning, before kissing my forehead and going to shower before his lecture.
Hogwarts was breaking up for Christmas this Thursday and Harry couldn’t be more ready. He'd played a rugby match each weekend for the past five weeks, and he was seriously behind on homework. The games were wonderful; he was so close with the team, and true to form not a single one had been lost. It was euphoric to be so successful, and Harry couldn’t remember a time of his life where he had ever been happier.
“since when did you have a doorbell mate?” the ginger asked, before looking at Harry and going slack jawed. “what in Merlin’s saggy balls are you wearing Harry?”
Cho and I were together for nearly a year, and then we broke up over something small that escalated to something big, and it just wasn’t working well. It was good while it lasted, though. We were each other’s firsts, and we trusted each other, we just weren’t compatible. Anyway, after the breakup, Cedric was very supportive, always hanging out with me so I didn’t feel lonely, inviting me to their parties so I stayed in the friendship group even without Cho.
“have hope Ron, he could be stuck with Hufflepuffs” huffed Hermione, struggling against him and his considerable strength. “come on Ron, we can’t change it either way so we might as well get it over with” reasoned Harry, walking towards the board. When he got close enough to see, his stomach dropped.
It was embarrassing, and he was now unable to look Potter in the eye. Finally, the group stopped for lunch, and Draco welcomed the reprieve until Potter declared that he was ‘bloody boiling’ and shucked off his t shirt. Draco was thoroughly fucked, and not in the way he desperately wanted. He ate his stale sandwich dejectedly, desperately trying to calm down his raging libido. Distracted by finally being able to have an extended break Draco was reminded of the havoc this hike was wreaking on his body. His thighs burned constantly, and his shoulders back and hips ached despite the considerable reduction in his burden thanks to Potter.
He switched a light on and the room flooded with soft yellow lamplight. It was a very cozy sitting room, with a tiny sofa and an armchair, as well as a little bookcase full of worn books. On either side of the room was a door, and Harry moved towards the one Draco assumed was the bedroom.
And then he had greeted Draco. And Draco had just stared at him. Like a bloody teenage girl with a juvenile crush on a teacher. God, it was embarrassing. And now he had to go and spend an hour and fifteen minutes listening to Harry’s baritone speaking the language of love.  He was really starting to hate year twelve.
“Let me, let me” Harry says, hushed in the cavernous office. I hold my hand and the ring out to him and he slides it onto the ring finger of my left hand. It fits perfectly.
“So... you and Luna…” Draco said, wanting to reassure himself that Harry really wasn’t dating the blonde beauty from the night before.
We stand in unison and he clutches me to his chest, and I feel his tears soak through my robes as surely as my tears soak through his shirt. He rocks me gently as we hold each other tightly, and I never ever want to let go.
“calm down ‘mione, they’re not on a limited time frame, they’ll still be there in five minutes. Can’t a man eat first?” groaned Ron, barely awake with his robes all wrinkled and his tie undone. Hermione’s reply of “you’re always eating Ronald” reminded Harry an awful lot of Molly Weasley.
He stripped Draco into his pants again, before conjuring a bucket and placing it by Draco’s bed. As he made to stand up and go, a pale hand shot out of the duvet and fumbled around, clearly trying to grab Harry’s arm.
“Nonsense. Anyway, Draco is upstairs. Good luck with your homework, and I do hope you’ll be staying for dinner, dear.”
Oh, Harry felt bad that he had made Draco feel as if it were his fault, but also relieved, because he could fix this, without having to face his past too much.
Everyone looked up as McGonagall walked into the eighth-year common room, all noise falling silent. Only around twenty of them had returned. For Draco and Pansy, it had been a condition of their probation, and Blaise had decided to join. Harry and Ron had been strong armed into it by Hermione. Dean, Seamus and Neville were there, alongside Padma. Parvati had stayed at home to help Lavender heal and recover. There were some Ravenclaw’s, and Hufflepuffs, but all in all a very small year.
“116” somehow Harry turned him practically monosyllabic. One-word answers were most unbecoming of a Malfoy. His mother would be disappointed.
“Ah, what a lovely idea. Nicole and Emma will love that!” Harry says and Peterson’s frown deepens. Harry has lunch almost everyday with Peterson and the two secretaries, Nicole and Emma. They all have desks just outside Harry’s spacious office, and he’s told me before how gossiping with Nicky and Emmy- as he affectionately  calls them- is the best part of his day.
He was standing in the cloisters, watching the cars pull in to pick up their sons for the holidays. Nearby were Harry and Ron, chatting animatedly.
“they’re baby jabberwockies” she said when she noticed Draco staring at the creatures that wriggled across her pyjamas. “aren’t those from a muggle poem?” Harry asked, already making space for the girl in his bed. Draco felt a pang in his chest at the knowledge that the three of them would be in one bed, and he would be alone.
“Ah. Be quick about it. Harry’ll be needing the help and then I’ll need you back here not too late tonight.”
“That sounds amazing, and honestly I could do with the help” Sirius said, grinning widely at Draco. Draco grinned back, feeling like a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders.
A few hours later, Harry found himself on Regents street with Pansy on his arm. They were receiving many appraising stares. He guessed they did make a striking couple. Pansy was in a skin-tight leather skirt and silken blouse, and he was laden with bags full of designer clothing that she had picked out. She had even bought him some obscenely expensive items. She said they were a ‘thank you’ for him letting her stay at Grimmauld, and buying lunch the day before. She said the reason she was able to buy clothes at certain shops here was because she had set up a tab that went straight to Gringotts, so she needn’t worry about money at all whilst shopping. Pansy was growing on Harry massively, especially as she had bought for him some stunning silk shirts from the Selfridges.
It stung that the only boys his age seemed to refuse to befriend him, but the rational side of Draco’s brain forced him to acknowledge that to them, he was a rich twat who had barged in on their way of life with absolutely know knowledge of farming at all. His inexperience could come off as superiority, and his clothes probably made him seem pretentious. He resolved to try harder, to prove that he was more than the superficial view they probably held of him.
“Tell me, Harry, is it any of your business who I get with?” Hermione said, and Draco felt her tense beneath him.
Pushing thoughts of his father aside, Draco held his glass out, and hastily threw back the substantial amount he had been given. It burnt on the way down, but tasted unequivocally like money, and Draco settled into his birth right of only consuming the most expensive products on the market, surrounded by boys who had been raised the same.
Oblivious to the sparkle in her eye, Draco grinned and said “I am, mum. He’s really nice, and really good at French. And he likes poetry, and he gets on well with the boys”
“what are you thinking?” asked Harry, voice hoarse and scratchy as he took Draco’s hands in his. Draco took a few deep, raggedy breaths, before saying, “I think,” he said in a thin, weak voice before clearing his throat and starting again, “I think I want to show Pansy.”
“I’ll floo call them, I’m sure they won’t have plans tonight.” With that, Draco left for the floo, and it took all of Harry’s self-control not to follow and eavesdrop. Instead he pulled out one of his favourite muggle cookbooks, and settled on making a mushroom pasta, just in case anyone was vegetarian. Looking forward to getting out of the house for a shopping trip, he strapped Teddy to his chest, grabbed his wallet from the little table by the front door and left. Only once he was in Tesco, he realised he hadn’t actually received confirmation that the Slytherins would indeed be coming that night.
“What’s so funny?” He asks, and I see his knuckles turn white where they’re clutching his pint as he feels mocked.
“you’re welcome to join us Blaisey” said Harry, “But then I would have to bake your balls this morning”
Never mind that they almost always got bollocked for stealing the expensive stuff from their parents, or that at the start none of them had actually liked the taste of wine. It had made them feel rich and important and grown up, and as fifteen-year-old trust fund brats, those were the three most important feelings in the world.
The poshness of his voice grated on his ears, but he didn’t know how to talk like Harry and Ron did, all dropped consonants and soft sounds.
“Whatever will make him suffer” Luna replied just as quietly, and Harry lightly put his hand on her arse, shifting her body closer.
They were half way through their powerpoint, writing about how France’s immigrant population increased massively after the war due to France bringing in men from the overseas colonies to make up for lost manpower when Harry’s phone rang.
Harry could already see he and Ron reflected in another two boys- Dean and Seamus. They gravitated towards each other in between drills, and when they went to the gym for the second hour of their practice, they spotted each other, much like Harry and Ron did. This was comforting, and Harry hoped that the four of them would become friends.
For the umpteenth time that day, Draco had made a fool of himself in front of Potter, and Potter had responded nicely. Potter had never been
Harry reached out and put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, gently turning him to Harry could step in and take Draco’s place. Draco clung to him like a drowning man, and so Harry decided to forgo the stairs and apparate them straight to their bedroom.  Harry didn’t know what to do. These were very much unforeseen circumstances. He started by taking Draco’s makeup off with a wet wipe, gently wiping his face clean of tears and glitter. Then, he took Draco’s top and jeans off, and placed him in bed, before stripping down to his underwear and sliding in next to Draco, and pulling the blond in close.
The first week of year twelve was finally drawing to a close. Draco saw he had French Friday morning and almost dropped his head into his cereal. He had made an utter fool of himself the night before. He just… he hadn’t expected Harry to acknowledge his existence so casually, in front of both of their friends. That wasn’t how the school worked. Rugby boys, by virtue of being good at tackling and getting muddy, believed they were better than everyone around them. They weren't nice to Draco and his boys, and Draco and his boys weren't nice back. That was how it worked, none of this smiling and friendliness. (no matter how much Draco wanted it)
“Right, let's get some tea. The scones aren't as good as Molly’s, but they are good.” Sirius said, setting off towards one of the tea shops Draco had seen, choosing a table outside and lowering himself into a chair, more gingerly than Draco had seen him do at home.
“She sounds like ‘mione. ‘Mione always gives t’best advice,”Harry said, still smiling at Draco, which caused Draco’s stomach to wobble a little more.
“I’d only had it once before coming here. I’m sure Sirius has told you but my family, ah, aren't the most open minded. I’d always wanted to try it again, I’m glad it's properly homemade here.”
“he needs time to process it but also, I think he’s staying away from you because he’s waiting for you to change your mind. He doesn’t want you to comfort him now only for you to turn around tomorrow and leap into Blaise’s arms.” She says, picking at a loose piece of thread on her trousers.
“Where did you get all this muscle you hunk? God you’re like my dream man now” Pansy said when she untucked her face from his neck.
Deciding the fresh air would be good for Draco, and not trusting him not to be sick again, Harry decided they would walk back to Grimmauld. He made the right decision as the walk took over an hour; Draco had to stop every couple of streets to be sick again. Harry was glad he had kept the water he had been given, as it was much needed. They finally stumbled into Grimmauld place and Harry hauled Draco straight to the bathroom. He rubbed Draco’s back soothingly as the boy retched into the toilet, before Draco slumped back into Harry’s kneeling body behind him. Draco messily wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and then turned his head, nuzzling it into Harry’s neck.
Draco felt secretly pleased that he had picked Harry’s favourite, but also a bit worried that Harry might resent him for it. God knows that the individuality complex bred into Draco from years of private schooling made his life hell whenever someone he didn’t know very well expressed interest in something niche that Draco enjoyed.
His eyes flew back open when a strong arm wrapped itself over Draco and pulled him flush against Potter, who turned to lay on his side, then curled his body around Draco. It was a bittersweet feeling at first, knowing Draco could get this close but no closer, but soon the ‘sweet’ eclipsed the ‘bitter’, as the warmth that leaked out of Potter and into Draco, and he relaxed into Potter’s body, feeling safe cocooned in the warmth.
Harry’s face tightened, and he let go of Draco’s hand. “what’s that supposed to mean” he said in a low voice.
“Hello, cousin” the man said as he reached the bottom of the stairs. He had a posh accent, a stark contrast to Remus’ Yorkshire broad. He gave Remus a chaste kiss on the cheek before leading them all into a large spacious kitchen with a long bench-like table stretched down the middle that could probably comfortably sit around fifteen people.
She climbed onto the bed next to him, putting the tray on his bedside and nestling into his pillows, before passing him a mug and taking one for herself.
“Oh, Harry! I didn’t realise you were here. I thought we could watch the second how to train your dragon film?” Draco said, looking up at Harry with such a sweet expression on his face.
Harry was in a large sweater and baggy pale blue jeans, and mismatched socks that were just so sweet it made Draco’s heart hurt.
I close my eyes against the onslaught of hope that threatens to overwhelm me. For the first time in my life, words elude me, and so instead I shuffle backwards and peel back the top corner of my duvet, hoping he gets the hint. He does, and he swings his legs over before wriggling under the duvet and turning to face me.
The only people he would willingly join were Ron and Hermione, and Molly Weasley. He found her maternal presence comforting, and she took him to her bosom much as she had done Harry, coming over with chicken pie and fussing over how skinny they both were and were they eating enough, and did she need to come over to help more and how they should let her look after Teddy more. She was overwhelming in the best way, and Draco could see how she had become a sort of lifeline for Harry while he was still stuck in an abusive household. Draco was surprised to find he was very happy at Grimmauld. He found himself often surprised in Harry’s company. The boy completely subverted expectations. He was a war veteran, a war hero, the saviour of an entire society, yet here he lived, in relative obscurity as a full-time father at just eighteen years old. It was endearing to see how he had healed, how he continued to heal with Teddy by his side. Draco loved it when he woke up late and would come down to the living room to see Harry lying on the sofa, the paleness of Teddy’s skin stark against the darkness of Harry’s as Teddy lay nestled into Harrys chest, as the two watched muggle cartoons on the television. Draco found himself comforted by the bizarre domesticity of his new life. It was so different to anything he had ever known in the best way conceivable.
“Sleep now, yeah?” Harry said, pressing a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips before bodily turning them so he was spooning Draco.
Draco just nodded, unable to talk in his haste to get his laptop and climb onto the bed, desperate for proximity with Harry. Much to his delight, Harry automatically wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders, and Draco settled into his side as they started the film. He knew he was being a bit pathetic, but he was enjoying himself too much to care.
Halfway through the evening, Draco was feeling quite suffocated by all the sycophants, and escaped to the patio. Now he was away from the party, he couldn’t bear to go back, and so he took a meandering walk around the gardens. He reached his mother’s walled rose garden and heard voices. He slipped in, wondering who could be in there so late, and almost screamed at the sight that greeted him.
Draco grabbed his hand back. “god no Harry not like that” he sputtered, looking Harry in the eye in earnest. “not because you’re the bloody saviour boy-who-lived-forever golden prat. Because you’re you. You’re the Harry that sings when he’s happy and is always hugging his friends and is always there when you’re drunk and throwing up and you still play quidditch even though it’s almost killed you more times than I can count. You’re the Harry that was kind to me even though you had every reason to punch me every time you see me because of everything I’ve done to you. You’re Harry who doesn’t speak when he comforts you because he knows words don’t make a difference but being held does.” Babbled Draco, wishing he hadn’t fucked it up before it had begun. Harry relaxed, laughing at Draco’s hungover rambling.
Remus bought them takeaway, and Harry ate what Sirius assured him was his dad’s favourite type of curry, feeling bittersweet as he did so.
“She can come back ‘n visit anytime, lad” he said, the deep cadence of his voice comforting, and Draco was distracted from his sadness of seeing Pansy go by just desperately wishing Sirius and Remus could have been his father’s instead. Sighing, he let Remus gently turn him and lead him back to the car, and they drove back in peaceful silence, occasionally broken by gentle conversation, Remus inquiring as to how he knew Pansy, and what made them such close and strong friends.
Draco made his way to the reception desk to pick up his timetable for lessons, having gotten his dorm assignment the night before. He wondered where the two new boys would be living, and if he would have the misfortune to be sharing any communal spaces with them.
A hush fell over the crowd as the two teams made their way onto the pitch, and Draco got sucked into the drama of the game (watching Harry run and tackle and run some more) and before he knew it, Hogwarts had won. Yet another win in an inexhaustible list of the undefeatable school. Everyone there for Hogwarts students cheered and shouted, and some over-excited dads (and Ginny) ran out onto the pitch to congratulate their sons (and brothers). It was sweet to see the happiness brought on by victory, and Draco supposed he was starting to understand why everyone at his school was so obsessed. He still adamantly maintained that he should have been at the top of the pecking order. The rugby boys (bar Harry, of course) may have been successful Neanderthals, but they were Neanderthals nonetheless.
I fold it up and slide it under his door under the pretext of going to the bathroom. Potter is in the kitchen, sorting out our Chinese, and so he won’t see the note until after we’ve eaten and gone to bed, which is good, and I feel myself relax somewhat. We eat in a somewhat comfortable silence, but I don’t put my feet in his lap, and it feels like a loss. Instead of staying until the end of the film as is our norm, I head back to the sanctuary of my room in the hopes that I will then be asleep by the time he’s read the note.
And yeah, I might be an ex-death eater whose father may or may not have failed trying to escape Azkaban and re-embarrassed our family all over again, and yeah, maybe I am technically unemployed- Harry calls me a gentleman of leisure. Blaise calls me a househusband even though we’re not even engaged yet- but even if I was Satan himself, surely it’s common decency to respect when two people are in an exclusive relationship, instead of people constantly trying to ask Harry on dates in front of me.
Draco spoke of how his father made him spend the Saturdays and Sundays of primary school in extra tutoring, and so Draco never learnt how to make friends. He spoke of how isolated this made him; how, in secondary school, he turned to cruelty because he knew neither how to form nor maintain friendships and he was so jealous of those who could.
“I feel like I never see you anymore, Harry” Ginny said, and Draco detected that tone in her voice that Pansy always adopted whenever she was talking to her new boy interest of the month.
“Honestly, Hermione don’t go to the trouble. He doesn’t need to like me, it's okay. It's not breaking my heart or anything.”
“so Draco wasn’t kidding when he said the three of you shared a bed. Pray tell what kinky Gryffindor antics ensue” said Blaise, looking at Harry as if he wanted to eat him.
Then the dancing. He had to admit, he and Luna were a striking couple as they swirled around the hall, her waist fitting perfectly into the curve of his arm, her head resting on his shoulder as they waltzed, her tulle skirts floating around her. They looked like faerie royalty.
He made it to English, collapsing into a chair at the empty desk at the back, trying to breathe as quietly as possible and not announce to the whole room how utterly unfit, he was. He needed to start exercising.
And then, it was fine, you know? Year ten and eleven were good years. We found our groove as a friendship group, and it was like the three of us against the world, you know? And then after out gcse’s we had a group of Romanian exchange students, and one of them asked me to the year eleven prom, and I said yes because a boy had never shown interest in me like that, and it turns out that Ron had been building up the courage to ask me, but Victor got there first and it turned into a whole thing, really put a dampener on our gcse summer, and poor Harry got stuck in the middle of us.”
“after that reaction, I might have to” murmured Draco, before he turned to the chest of drawers to find an alternative outfit. He settled on a pair of white jeans to go with his pale skin and to contrast Harry’s black jeans and dark skin. He donned a black mesh top, and completed the outfit with platform docs. He looked utterly over the top, and so absolutely perfect for a night out.
“I asked to kiss you, Malfoy, not the other way round.” Said Potter, nudging Draco’s shoulder affectionately. “of course I don’t regret it. I was drunk, but not that drunk.”
Surrounded by his favourite people, Harry put his headphones in full blast and stared wistfully out of the window, reflecting on the bittersweet nature of his last ever train journey on September first. Ron and Hermione bickered fondly, Neville was talking to an overgrown plant and Luna leant her head on Harry’s shoulder, humming as if she too could hear the notes seeping into Harry’s brain. All too soon, they were in the Great Hall, stars twinkling above them, waiting for McGonagall to announce the Eighth year living arrangements. Harry caught sight of Draco across the hall, and nodded once in acknowledgment. Draco nodded graciously in return, and the two boys, two sides of the same coin, felt something warm start to glow in their chests at the lack of animosity, the recognition of great suffering endured, soon to be overcome.
Draco looked up and found himself prisoner in Harry’s stare. Harry grunted, waving his hand and the mess Draco had made disappeared. Trust Harry Potter to be powerful enough to do wandless magic while so incapacitated.
“You feel how you feel, when you feel, Draco. You can’t help it, okay? And if I'm not in a place to talk about it then I'll tell you, but that’s my decision to make, okay? Not one you get to make for me.” Harry said, and Draco felt both reassured and chastised. He hated feeling like he had upset Harry when all he wanted was to do the opposite. Why was he so shit at this?
Sirius showed him around, pointing out the historical buildings and who lived where. They went into some of the boutiques, and Sirius bought Remus a thick knitted fisherman’s jumper, telling Draco he tries to buy Remus something every time he comes to the village. It warmed Draco’s heart to see such easy love between two men. It wasn't something he had ever had the privilege of witnessing, and seeing proof that he would be able to live a happy domestic life without a wife meant more to him than he had ever realised. He even found his eyes pricking with tears a bit to hear Sirius talking about Remus with such love and adoration written across his face.
Draco was hit with a desperate sadness at the thought that Harry was leaving. He really, really didn’t want Harry to go.
“Look. Seamus obviously trusts you if he’s inviting you to first night drinks. It’s an institution. But he and Dean are somewhat of an item, and I will not tolerate any bigotry towards them. I know the reputation private school boys have, and we are not like that here. Understand?”
“shove off Parkinson, I got baby sick on my pyjamas, I’m about to go and get some clothes on” Harry said, feeling awfully exposed.
He believed what he was saying, but he said it less because it was true and more to feel Harry’s green eyes on his face again.
Theo held a massive new years party, and invited Ron and Harry and Hermione, as well as Luna and Ginny. Harry had the time of his life, meeting loads of new people, going to a party with Draco on his arm, kissing Draco at midnight with fireworks in the background. It was the best holiday Harry had ever had.
“Racism” Hermione said with a sigh. “Sirius’ family always disapproved of his friendship with James because of his race, and I don't know if anyone told you what happened to his parents, but eighteen months after Harry was born his mum and dad were killed in a racially motivated attack in a village called Godric’s Hollow, about an hour’s drive away. His mum’s family lived there, and his parents were visiting.”
This year, it would be him, Sirius, Remus and Tonks, and little Teddy. Harry’s new, wonderful family. He was beyond excited. He would miss the Weasley’s, but he was too excited to be with Sirius. They were all going to the Weasley residence for boxing day, though. Harry had to see his found family at least once during the festivities.
Draco just nodded, grinning at Harry who had sighed, rolled his eyes and said “let's get you some air” before manhandling Draco out of the room, down the hall and out into the small courtyard in front of the building.
“Malfoy, you weren’t at dinner, so I brought you some food. I hope you’re okay. I’d like to talk to you, if that’s okay”
“Harry James Potter. Telling someone you have been told to apologise to them is possibly the worst way to apologise, and what have you done since then? You’ve ignored him, and then gotten angry when I choose to spend time with him. Do better”
“he said he would help with the alcohol and lights and stuff. This is going to be great ‘mione. I’m going to have it on New Year’s Eve and invite the whole year before we go back to school.” As much as Hermione knew this would end terribly, she couldn’t deny Harry things like this. She was too happy that he felt capable of doing such a thing, and didn’t want to seal himself off from all humanity. Hermione nodded at him, and his face split into an easy grin. His smile turned impish and he bent down to whisper to her “I know you, ‘mione, and if you won’t party at Hogwarts you better party at home. Invite your cousins.”
Harry snorted, “what an inappropriately older step-brother? Are dubious morals your thing, Blondie?”
Harry nudged Luna’s head away and turned to him. He slowly slid a hand up her thigh and said with as much nonchalance as he could muster,
Harry floo’d to the Burrow with Teddy whilst Draco and Pansy completed their grooming routine, and he watched her fuss over the baby for a bit, before saying that he could stay the night with her, as she seemed to be missing him. She couldn’t say yes fast enough, and he grinned before going back to Grimmauld and floo called Dean and Seamus to see if they were up for a club night with the Slytherins. The two were somewhat dubious about it but said yes as they were curious about Slytherin party habits. Pansy was delighted when he told them, and her and Draco immediately started to plan outfits. Harry had to drag them out of the house to the cinema. Just to take the piss, Harry took them to see the Rugrats movie, which had just been released that year. He found himself enjoying it immensely and made a mental note to watch it again with Teddy. His companions also enjoyed it quite thoroughly. He supposed that after living through war things like children’s films seemed more enjoyable for their innocence and sweetness.
On unsteady legs, with eyes that were beginning to mist with tears, Harry raced back down the corridor, the head of the poor boy being bashed against Harry’s back. The adrenaline started building again, and extra, anxiety-fuelled strength filled Harry’s veins.
“there was a time, in fifth year, when Blaise went through this period of feeling intense jealousy towards Draco. Draco went through puberty first out of all the boys- Goyle, Crabbe and Nott included, and so he was much taller with a deeper voice and all that, which Blaise seemed to find somewhat emasculating. Then Draco and I entered into what was a very fake relationship so Draco could try and dispel his father’s worries that he was gay, and get Lucius off his back about arranging a marriage.
Your grandparents organised my marriage to your father for me. His family dates back to the arrival of William the conqueror, and the Malfoy’s have been aristocrats ever since, and spent many centuries at the right hand of the king. You know my family are landed gentry, and my parents wished for me to find a suitable match for our standing. I had two suitors, actually. Your father, and Mr Nott. I couldn’t bear Nott. He was so restrictive of me, always passing comment on how I dressed and the books I read. I was repulsed, and so I chose your father. My only choice was between the two of them.
“I have to agree. I understand the theory behind it, but it’s too heartless for me to appreciate it.”
“He is gorgeous” his mother said, right before she swept past Draco, opening the door before he got a chance to.
“Well, it was a very convincing performance. Also, Harry, you might want to make it clear to that blond boy- Drake? - that you and Luna aren’t an item. He looked quite upset to see you necking in a hallway” Hermione said, still tucked into Ron’s side.
“the Irish muggle from earlier, Hoozy? Hozy?” Draco was cursing his shit-awful memory when he heard the voice again “oh Hozier! I think you’ll like this one” said Harry and soon a slow, mournful song filled the room;
“not really. I feel relieved, though. I felt a perverse pleasure in watching the earth pile atop his coffin. I'm glad he’s gone.” Harry said, from where he sat on the edge of his bed, next to Draco.
“ I know this is going to sound horribly insincere, but I wanted to apologise to you. All of your friends of course, but you first. Nothing I can say will ever excuse my behaviour, however if you would be so kind as to give me an opportunity to explain it,” here, Harry nodded warily, still not breaking his intense eye contact with Draco. Unable to bear the heat of Harry’s gaze, Draco looked down. “I see now that my father was only sustained by his perceived superiority over others. He was a small and weak man, and I learnt this summer while reading family history accounts that he was also a sickly child who was unloved by his mother and father alike. His pureblood status was all that he had, and it became his lifeblood. He forced these beliefs onto me, perhaps seeing my penchant for femininity and my closeness to my mother, and believing that I would never be a ‘man’ in the traditional sense, and thus that I too would need the security of the supremacy of my blood to be the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning.” He huffed a weak laugh here. “it was, you know, the only thing that kept him living. When the war was lost and he was forced to face his own inferiority, and weakness, he lost his sense of self, his whole identity. He died before he even made it to Azkaban.” Draco looked up now, made confident by the fact that he was yet to be hexed. “I’m not my father though, as much as I used to want to be. I have things that get me out of bed in the morning, and I refuse to let blood-purist ideology and prejudice be one of those reasons ever again. I am so sorry Potter, and I also wanted to thank you for speaking on my behalf; it was undeserved, and I will be grateful for it until my last breath.” Draco closed his eyes now, finally done with the speech he had rehearsed ceaselessly on the train. He repeated his mantra; he didn’t need to be forgiven, free was enough. (and yet… some small part of him ached to hear words of acceptance, recognition of his penance)
Harry felt all the tension drain out of him like someone had turned a tap. He grinned and said “no, no of course we’re okay with it.”
“He’s more than a prick,” Draco muttered before he even thought about what he was saying. He flushed red, instinctively expecting to be scolded, but he was pleasantly surprised when Sirius just laughed.
After lunch, he has a liberal studies lesson in which they were looking at the form and function of the UN, and then a free period. All in all, a great first Monday back, Draco thought as he headed back to the year 12 common room in the same building as his dorm.
Harry laughed. “you look equally ravishing, Parkinson. I would expect nothing less.” She bared her teeth at him in a feral grin, and Harry nodded to Blaise, “Zabini, nice to see you.” The other black boy nodded gracefully, but replied with a somewhat biting “is it, Potter?”
He turned and picked up a camera, charmed to immediately print every photo taken to the printer in Harry’s little study. He took two pictures of Draco with Teddy in his arms, so that Draco and Narcissa could take one home with them. He then settled Teddy into his cot, sent Draco back down to his mother, and ran up to get the pictures.
These words hurt Draco, reminding him of the bottle tucked under his bed, the bottle that was both his weakness and his salvation. He saw Hermione grip Harry’s hand in apology and understanding, before Harry waved his free hand and the lights cut out instantaneously.
