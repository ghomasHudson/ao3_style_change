Theo fixes him with a disbelieving look and says airily, "Oh, don't play dumb with me, Draco. Trying to worm out information from me, when this is working as planned? Introducing treacle tart into the menu two months before your sentence is up at the Ministry?" His tone softens, and he puts his wine down. "No points for guessing the person you're trying to attract. This is your final effort to make something happen, in your own subtle way, before you leave the Ministry and never see Potter like this again. You want more than just greetings and polite conversation shared between acquaintances. You’ve always wanted his attention." He licks wine off his lips. “Old habits die hard, eh?”
“What sort of things?” Harry’s skin heats with the attention.
He takes his usual seat between Filius Flitwick and Aurora Sinistra — they’re not here yet — busying himself with smoothing out his napkin and shifting his cutlery and goblet to his preferred positions. He looks up only when Charlie has engaged Potter in conversation.
“I want to look at my partner’s face when I’m dancing, not the top of his head. Don’t see, Potter.
After Harry left the Academy, he visited Charlie at Romania, just to see if the sanctuary was a possible career option. He met Pork Chop there. In the end, he didn't leave with a job, but a pet snake. She was furious and distrustful of humans after her terrifying encounter, but under Charlie and Harry's patient and tender care, she healed, morphing into this snarky, pork chop-loving, smart-arse snake that they've come to know and love.
“What?” Potter says, shocked.
Draco puts his fork down, pushes the pasta away and dabs his lips with a napkin. He's spent the past few days vacillating between a rollercoaster of emotions: fury, hope, misery, sorrow, more hope
bakery.
"Oh."
Mother had always said that clothes make the man.
behind him. Draco sways his hips seductively as he threads through the tables and chairs, hoping to give the other man a good look at his arse—
Hypnotised, Draco wets his lips and continues to thrust his cock into the circle of his fist when Potter stands up, raises his arms and clasps his hands together, his index fingers pointing skywards in a brief stretch. The waistband of Potter’s pants dip, but before Draco can crane his neck for a better look, he’s already changed position into—
"Then why aren't we fucking right now-"
"And no, Draco's not dancing tonight, if you're wondering," Jacob's voice jolts Harry out of his thoughts — no, he was definitely
It's sunset when they reach their destination, and Draco sees at once why this is one of Harry's favourite spots along the Seine. They sit down on the concrete bank flanking the river.
Harry takes a pull of Firewhiskey.
"It's been three bloody days, Harry. Three days of seeing you mope around the house and floating around looking all dreamy" — Harry gasps, scandalised — "Besides, it'd be a shame if you let it go like that after all your effort," Oliver points out around a mouthful of apple and jabs a finger towards Harry.
After five slow and long breaths, Draco recovers his equilibrium and turns back to the potion. He picks up the remaining dew and ponders over the appropriate spell or ingredient to salvage the potion.
Nudging that entirely pointless thought aside, Draco asks, "You do see the issue with this, don't you?"
“I won’t. I’ll never forget that,” Draco promises. He pulls Potter into another breath-taking kiss, trying to pour all of his emotions — something that he is still unable to put into words — into it. They break apart reluctantly, and the sadness in Potter's eyes melts into something so loving and tender when he looks at Draco.
is looking over them! Must be easy being you, isn't it, life divvied up into black or white,
His lips pushed into a pout, Malfoy rides him, slow and sweet. He places his hands on Harry's chest to brace himself as he bounces up and down, driving Harry wild with lust. “Fuck, that’s good. Like that, Draco, just like that,” Harry says in a strained voice, bending his knees and pushing his feet into the bed. He reaches for Malfoy’s arse and kneads it, before swearing and thrusting upwards.
"He asked me if I wanted in, of course. He knew my history, knew that Death Eaters did some potion and poison trafficking on the side. I refused. He wasn't happy, but he probably saw the novelty in having a Death Eater strip for his club," Draco laughs mirthlessly. "He hired me eventually, but with the additional stipulation of granting me ownership of the club on paper.
"Harry's here already, I ran into Horace on the way here and he told me." Charlie looks at him, his words hesitant when Draco’s lips thin at the mention of Potter. "You'll be alright, yeah? You've always had a... history with him, and more recently, with the whole... Auror thing..." he trails off uncertainly.
Potter grins slyly at Draco as he tugs the blasted maroon shirt on. The minute he straightens it, though, Potter frowns. "Yeah, it's way too tight. I should toss it." He takes it off, and Draco appreciates the rare view before Potter wears his black T-shirt.
Marjorie returns with Malfoy’s red wine. She’s about to say something, but a server arrives with a flurry of orders.
“Where do you go to write your songs?”
Harry closes his eyes, a whirlwind of disjointed memories assaulting him. He remembers blood, fresh and bright red blood leaking between his fingers and his slippery palms pressing onto Ron's side. His healing spells closing the gash on Ron's flesh, and the heat of a curse slamming through the already-weakened sphere of defensive magic Ron had created just seconds ago. Starbursts of pain emanating from his right arm, followed by a strangely cool sensation trickling through his body, his grip loosening on Ron, someone picking him up and a loud boom ringing through his ears, a scream—
He spends some time catching up with McGonagall and the other professors, and when he's ready to retire for the night, most of the school population — both students and teachers — have left. Upon spotting the leftover pork chops at the table, Harry perks up. He transfigures a napkin into a bag, and stuffs a few chops into it — Pork Chop hasn't tasted pork chops cooked the Hogwarts way, and he's sure she'll love it.
"It wore me down, too. Waiting for him to call the wedding off. To tell me that he rekindled things with you.”
It's halfway into the night when Parkinson sits beside Harry. She regards him with curious eyes, a red-tipped finger circling the rim of her champagne glass. "You looked disappointed to see me earlier," she points out, gesturing to the door with a lazy flick of her wrist, the charms of her bracelet clinking. She eyes him from top to bottom, starting from his double earrings on his left earlobe, down his shoulders, biceps and chest. Harry fidgets in his seat and rubs his beard, the force of her gaze disconcerting.
Draco arches his back as his orgasm shatters through his body, his face scrunched in pleasure and ears ringing with his own cries and Harry's high-pitched whines. Leftover pleasure storms in his blood while he continues to touch himself, fingers lazily stroking the underside of his cock, nice and slow, just like Harry always does it after Draco comes.
He's hardly in the state to fuck, but how could he resist? Holding his half-hard cock, Draco pushes just the tip in and slides out, in and out to fuck his come back into Harry. Harry gasps, his hands clenching on the pillow. He arches his back even more, earning a slap on his arsecheek.
Potter has breathed life into Pansy and Draco's design. The harsh, unforgiving darkness of the Mark is rejuvenated with a vibrant firework of colours. Inside the snake's coiling, sinuous body, Potter has tattooed a winding chain of green and silver narcissus flowers—colours of the Malfoy crest—although the flowers surrounding the Dark Mark are in shades of white, light yellow and pale pink, these delicate colours a pleasing balance to the deeper green. Instead of the two hollow sockets in the skull, there are now two golden Snitches, their white wings spread in flight. At the bottom of the tattoo, nestled between daffodils and narcissus flowers, lie a smaller row of pansies, the colours of these pansies matching Pansy's tattoo.
Harry frowns, resentment and irritation cutting through his amusement at Malfoy's jealousy. "Why do I have to justify my actions to you, anyway? You seem rather suppressed yourself. D'you need a mag for your own needs?" he asks, grabbing the mag and dangling it in front of Malfoy.
Malfoy reaches over and taps Harry on the arm, pulling him away to a quieter corner, which is still too crowded for his liking. On their way there, a young girl approaches Harry for his help to snap a photo of her family, and he agrees, relieved that for once, it’s not a stranger requesting for a photo
And that's why George will never tell Malfoy that he saw him on that rainy day of Fred's funeral at the Burrow, standing at the back with his head bowed and a black hood covering his blond hair.
"Hedwig's gone hunting with Humps—"
"Yeah. It usually hurts the most at the start, and then you’ll adjust."
Ron's gaze lingers on Harry's love bites. They fall silent, a long and loaded moment pulsing between them. Harry doesn't know what to say if Ron asks him about Malfoy. He's tired of forming excuses, of hiding his love bites and his feelings.
Weasley, however, bears no interest for Draco. In fact, the only time when Draco enjoys his company is during an engrossing game of wizard's chess. Otherwise, during those rare times when they're alone, Weasley would run off to Hermione, spouting some lame excuse.
Draco's hands resume his tour of Potter's upper body, his eyes and touch absorbing every detail; his fingers dip into the hollows of Potter's collarbones, moving across to the smooth domes of his shoulders, down the flat planes of his heaving chest, to the firm muscle of his abdomen. There's a smattering of healed-over wounds on Potter's skin.
It's raining.
This mutual pining between Harry and Malfoy had started a year ago, when Harry had visited the shop after his first stint of training with Puddlemere. Malfoy had been a fresh hire then, and even though Harry was surprised to see him, that hadn’t stopped Harry from coming over more regularly.
Right, that’s it. He doesn’t want to over-think things any further. He’s twenty-two, for Merlin’s sake, he can certainly handle going up to someone and complimenting his singing. Harry stands up, wipes his palms on the thighs of his jeans and tries to pat his hair flat, although it’s a lost cause. His hand is on the doorknob when the man speaks, and he presses his ear to the wall. The one-sided conversation tells Harry that he’s on the phone.
"He said the past doesn't depict our future, which is ours to make of. So yes, I'd very much like to try, to see where the present leads us to."
“But you were tempted, weren’t you?”
Harry leans into his touch.
"Where are the owls?" Draco asks.
Draco vaguely wonders how Potter looks like without his glasses.
He'll fuck him tonight and leave him in the morning.
“Hey there,” the bartender greets Harry with an easy smile, her curiosity morphing into outright interest. “How are you tonight?”
She's lost not just one, but two sons.
Draco eyes Harry's body with a long, heated look before collecting his clothes and slipping into the bathroom.
"Good evening, Father," Draco said formally to Lucius, who nodded, zeroed in on a glass of champagne and moved away to a corner of the living room.
He simply can't be.
Potter exudes calm and quiet confidence as he works. How would it feel to have that laser-light focus centred on Draco? How would it feel to have those capable hands stroking his hair, exploring his body and tracing his lips? Draco hasn't been touched like that before.
Their friendship was still a work in progress, but they had come a long way from their original antagonising relationship. A determined Malfoy had approached George multiple times when he had been advertising for help in the shop, and George had rejected him every single time.
He takes a step forward.
"Come in then."
Draco's lips part slightly, the microphone catching his exhale. With shining eyes and a slow smile, his body relaxes; the tightness of his shoulders ease, and his hands fall away from the microphone. His palms turn up, towards the heavens. Harry bites his lower lip, swallowing the emotion gathering in his throat.
He wants to make it so good for Potter, so damn good that whenever Potter enters the canteen, he'll always be reminded of this night with Draco.
He will never hurt Draco like that again.
Harry doesn't even know when his shirt became hiked up, his jeans yanked open, the waistband of his pants tugged down. All he knows is that they are. He straightens his glasses, not wanting to miss anything when Malfoy kisses his way down his chest, the heat of his mouth shivering on his skin. Malfoy removes Harry’s shoes and socks. Harry’s breath comes short and shallow, his heart hammering away in his chest when he lifts his hips, allowing Malfoy to tug his jeans and pants down to his ankles, before he kicks them off.
There is even a small play area set up especially for Rose in the corner of his shop for the rare instance when Hermione was at work and Molly was unable to babysit. One time, when Hermione popped by to collect Rose, Rose had been in the midst of waving bye to Draco before her face crumpled up and she burst into tears.
Draco withdraws. "What?"
When they're seated at the table with steaming mugs of tea, Pork Chop curled up on her cushion beside them, Harry motions to the unpacked bags. "Leaving for the Burrow so soon?" Although tomorrow is the last official day of term, Charlie usually packs his things last minute (like Harry), so this means he's leaving earlier. "Everyone's fine, yeah? You're not rushing back 'cause someone's sick or anything like that?"
It's as if Potter is trying to fade into oblivion post-war. After his therapy, he got a job at the Ministry, but not as an Auror. He defied all public prediction and joined the Department of Magical Transportation. The Great Harry Potter, saviour of wizarding Britain, subjected himself to a dead-end, tedious grind of a nine-to-five job authorising Portkeys. He rejected all promotions heaped on him, choosing to remain in his tiny cubicle and pushing papers. It's a safe job, a career with no expectations; a job that Potter settled on after a lifetime’s worth of countless people pinning their hopes and dreams on him.
"You know she will."
Perhaps Potter is reminded of that too, for he looks away and jumps up from his seat, mumbling something about chamomile tea. As he busies himself with preparing Draco's favourite tea, Draco sits down beside his vacated chair, setting his box on the middle of the table.
"Yes. Wrapped up the case today."
"Malfoy isn't the only one lying to himself,” Ron adds.
Two days have passed, and he still can't stop replaying that moment, and the fact that Harry didn't kiss back. Draco shakes his head to clear his mind and returns to his book.
He hears movement in the room. That better be Malfoy, Harry thinks darkly, if not he might just have sex with Malfoy right in his kitchen. He does one last pull on his cock and stops entirely. He's still hard as he switches off the water, dries himself off and swings a towel across his hips. He steps out of the bathroom...
"I'll be waiting," Malfoy says, hovering at the threshold.
"By the way, is it serious with you and Oliver? Because Malfoy was asking me about it."
Harry releases the breath that was bottled in his chest. His stomach flutters with what he thinks is hope, and pent-up energy rattles within him. He takes another gulp of his Firewhisky, relishing the alcohol coursing in his blood. “So… we could work out? For real?”
Draco’s throat thickens with emotion.
That’s a benefit of wearing T-shirts and shorts for most of term — turning up in a simple white collared shirt, slim navy blue tie and well-fitting black trousers for their Sunday date in the swankiest restaurant in Hogsmeade is more than enough to render Malfoy speechless. Malfoy looks like an absolute treat tonight — styled blond hair, twinkling grey eyes, and in a tailored charcoal-grey suit, complete with a white silk pocket square, and…
"Sorry boys. He's off the menu tonight," Malfoy says lightly, but there's no denying the undercurrent of danger lacing his voice.
"So good, yeah? Wanna reward you." He can't see Potter do it, but he can feel him nod his head as Potter continues to suck. Draco reaches for the lube and coats his index and middle finger. Anticipation courses in his blood when he thinks of Potter's reaction.
“Welcome home, Draco,” the old, wise wizard said.
"Yes, Potter?" Malfoy looks up at him, and then smirks. "Potatoes are over there, by the way, and they're roasted, your favourite." He picks up two empty serving trays, and he's got one foot turned towards the kitchens.
Draco stares at the enormous beast, sharp black ridges lining its back and brown scales shimmering under the moonlight. "Why is she here?"
He’s lying down on his back now, his legs bent and his feet pressed onto the mat as he pumps his hips upwards in a steady tempo. With each upwards thrust, his stomach and his chest forms a straight line. Draco wonders how it’d feel like, caressing that tanned, warm skin, feeling the rapid beat of Potter’s heart under his touch as he rides Potter with abandon, the slick slide of Potter’s hard prick fucking into him as he jerks his hips up just like that, with Draco sinking down while Potter thrusts up, going in deep—
Harry doesn’t expect to see Malfoy in his element in the kitchen, out of all places. He’s so engrossed in the rhythmic movement of Malfoy’s bare hands that he starts when he says, “What brings you here, Potter?”
Harry gives a jerky nod. "Yeah. Yeah, that’s what I said." He pulls up a shaky laugh, and then lowers his head, scuffing the toe of his sock on the carpet. "So. Er. Yeah, that's all," he mumbles rather lamely, words directed to the floor.
and giving it a quick skim.
Harry fists a hand in Malfoy's collar, yanking him towards him.
"My, you've got a wicked tongue."
"No." Harry shakes his head vigorously. Draco has to know that he is so very different from Lucius Malfoy— "
It's hardly the same as Draco's hands. Harry recalls Draco’s arms that taper into slim and elegant wrists, leading to nimble and capable fingers that excel at crafting potions, cutting ingredients or giving massages. Whenever Harry had collapsed, bone-tired, in bed, Draco would sigh in fond exasperation and pull off his glasses and shirt. He'd slick his hands up with oil and rub circles onto Harry's closed eyelids, his shoulders and back. Harry would be floating on a cloud of pleasure, as long as Draco's hands were on him.
!" It seems that Potter is too far gone to continue his excellent job of sucking Draco, and he wants more of what Draco's giving; he shifts backwards, bouncing his hips against Draco's fingers.
The service was exactly as they had expected: long, tiresome speeches about Harry and Ron's valiant efforts during the war, lauding Harry's virtues as the Saviour, and how their actions brought peace and stability to the wizarding world. Draco didn't miss Hermione's snort of derision when the Ministry used the opportunity to boost the public’s impression of the Aurors.
He hasn't felt this alone in a long, long time.
"Are you lonely? Is that why you went to the Slytherins? Maybe we should visit Charlie more often. Or d'you miss London? We'll be home next month for hols, and I promise we'll visit Ron and Hermione first thing when we get back." Harry worries his lower lip. "Maybe I could talk to Minerva, see if you can join me in my classes so you're not alone when I'm teaching. I'm sure they won't mind if you stay at the stands during Quidditch practice."
“It’s not a contraction. She’s kicking," Hermione says, wincing.
Unperturbed, Harry scoots closer, wraps the duvet snugly around them and folds Draco up in his arms, dropping an affectionate kiss on the crown of his head. He clasps Draco's hands between his own and presses kisses on his wrists.
With that, Draco promptly kicks both Weasley and Potter out of his lab, rolls up his sleeves and gets down to re-brewing the potion that he had been working on.
Malfoy’s voice jerks Harry from his thoughts. Harry turns to the stage, keeping his head low and tugging the hood of his sweatshirt over his head.
He remembers the day when he signed his teaching contract in Minerva’s office, the ink drying on the parchment as he stared up at Dumbledore, who was beaming at him from his portrait. Beside him, Severus was looking at Draco, his black eyes giving nothing away, but the twitch of his lips was a semblance of a smile. After Draco concluded his business with Minerva, he approached Dumbledore’s portrait.
They wouldn't understand.
And then without warning, they
Draco wraps an arm around Potter's waist, plastering his entire back to Draco's front. Draco cants his hips up, grinning in satisfaction when Potter gasps at Draco's half-hard cock against his arse. His grin fades when Potter counters with a backwards roll of his own hips, grinding his arse against Draco's erection.
Hermione looks up from her book and beams at him.
He places his palms on Potter's shoulders, dipping his head to force Potter to meet his gaze. "Harry," he whispers, using his first name because this is so very important
Draco sits down and pulls his breakfast towards him — a calming cup of chamomile and a warm
Harry's right arm wanders southwards, and his bicep flexes.
Expensive, rare and highly dangerous snakes — both pure and mixed-blood — are being poached as part of an international reptile trafficking ring. Not only are the snakes themselves being traded, snake parts such as venom, fangs and eggs are being sold illegally, usually involving the potion trafficking circles. The Auror office is currently working with the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures on this case.
"Er. Earl Grey, with… with no milk and two sugar cubes."
Anger on Harry's face is something that Draco is very well-acquainted with, but there's something different, a new emotion on Harry's features that makes Draco's heart ache—
"Finally, someone comes along who isn't like a
shirt. “I…” Draco feels drained, as if he has spent the past few hours running an emotional marathon. “It just feels like… we’ve been fighting so much lately. We go to bed angry, and the next day we pretend nothing has happened. How do we move on from this?”
"No need for that," Kingsley tosses a bag at Harry. Harry pulls out a full-length photograph of a tall and
Draco hasn’t said it back to him yet, but it's okay. It's okay, because one day, he will, and the grin on Harry's face will be as dazzling as the one that Draco wears whenever Harry says it.
Although he’s only half in, Harry withdraws.
What does
Draco stares at him, at a loss for words.
Draco loves how Potter's eyes immediately swivel to his arse.
Harry clutches Draco’s forearm. Draco struggles just for the sake of it, and this only makes Harry pull him even closer to his chest. Harry hisses, his breath gliding across Draco’s right ear. “If I let you leave, what’s gonna happen? Will you return a few days later and pretend that this never happened?”
His words spiral up into a soft cry when Malfoy wraps a hand around his shaft, stroking him slow and sweet. He circles a thumb around Harry's slit, spreading pre-come over the head. He rests his left cheek on Harry's right thigh as he fondles him, alternating between hard strokes and gentle, barely-there grazes with the back of his fingers, his lips so close that Harry can feel his rapid, warm breaths ghosting over his prick. Malfoy winks at him and nuzzles his cock, his closed mouth skimming his balls and sliding up and down his shaft.
you-“
"How is it?"
Desire courses in Draco's bloodstream and he swallows. Harry is so warm and so close that Draco can smell his shampoo — mint and coconut. His full-lashed eyelids dip downwards, shooting Draco a sly glance, and his thin lips, a shade of strawberry pink, tilt upwards into a slow smile.
They watch the dancers for a while.
Draco makes a small, dying sound.
And when Potter finally leans in to press their lips together, Draco closes his eyes and shudders. It’s as perfect as he remembers; just like those kisses shared on a backdrop of sugar-swept snow and soft sparkling moonlight on Christmas night.
Yesterday had been Ron's last day as an Auror. His year-long leave of absence had been officially approved.
Harry can’t help but to lean in towards Malfoy, and Malfoy's moving closer too. Their lips are so close... just a bit more and they'll be kissing, but neither of them wants to be the one to make the first move.
Not until after he’s got his tart, of course.
He had misread the situation, but at least he finally had his answer. Disappointment floods his veins like ice-cold water.
Swearing under his breath, he pushes his book off his lap, and with wary eyes trained on Potter, who seems to be content simply sunbathing, he quickly packs his things. When Potter sits up, Draco scuttles behind the trunk, counts to five, and then slowly pokes his head out from the safety of the tree, peering.
It crackles back to life.
Hermione inhales sharply, a shock of pain flashing through her features. Draco tenses at once, ready to Summon his potions and the overnight bag prepared for the delivery.
Harry’s heart thuds with longing.
The castle’s response is a warm breeze surging through the windows, and a further dimming of the fire. Tendrils of moonlight glimmer on the floor, stretching towards the base of the memorial. It is comfortable, peaceful and soporific, and Draco’s eyelids are heavy. His shoulders slump and his body relaxes, releasing the coiled-up tension gathered during his monologue about his House. He could sit here and talk to Potter for hours, perhaps even fall asleep, curled up in Potter’s arms until the warmth of dawn approaches.
He vaguely wonders what Ron and Hermione are doing right now.
“You can. You can do this,” Hermione says, cutting through his fog of misery.
"The thread might stretch. It might tangle. But it will never break," he continues, his heart pounding. "When I heard about this story, I instantly thought of you."
...is a life-sized, fat and fluffy canary flapping his purple and white feathers, along with a pair of round glasses perched on his face.
"Potter!"
Harry switches off his phone, and he pauses before opening the top drawer of his nightstand.
He's been too distracted today to turn out his usual number of desserts. The only thing he's managed is Harry's treacle tart. It had been wonderful, watching Harry eat his treacle tart for the first time — he had taken one bite, moaned in sheer joy and cradled the plate of treacle tart lovingly in his hands with a dreamy expression on his face.
“It’s alright now, although I was slurring quite a bit during my first class that day.”
…towards Draco Malfoy, who raises the glass, nods at Jacob and turns back to another man.
"Should we... do something?" Hermione wonders, thrusting a hand into the bowl of popcorn on Ron's lap.
Harry roots around in his duffel bag, fishing out a clean pair of pants. He regards them for a moment, wrinkling his nose in contemplation. Someone clears their throat, and he looks up to see Hermione at the door. "Someone's here to see you," she says, raising her eyebrows meaningfully and stepping to the side.
"He's looking at you, mate," Ron pipes up, nudging Harry with an elbow. Harry lifts his head, seeing Draco turn around hurriedly and busy himself with packing his guitar into the bag.
he thinks. Before he can stop himself, an image of Potter and him swirling around the Great Hall rises to mind. Draco will lead, of course, as he’s the better dancer, and Potter will follow and they’ll make such a striking couple-
Harry laughs. "Good morning to you, too. Tea's great." He walks into the kitchen, hovering beside Malfoy for a moment. He's tempted to hug him from the back, but he vaguely remembers that they haven't really had a proper talk. Still, he's glad that it's not awkward the morning after.
Draco swallows and nods, grinning. "Have you been doing this your whole life, then?"
Disappointment flares in Harry as he trudges away — it's probably because he's abandoning a delicious treacle tart with his name on it (every treacle tart in existence has Harry's name on it), and not because he's moving away from Malfoy, what a ludicrous idea-
Draco tries another tactic when Potter refuses to budge. "Your old brooms would make some children very happy."
Well, that might’ve been what he said, but Draco is too busy marvelling at the biggest cock he’s seen in the flesh. He’s seen bigger ones in porn mags, but this one is right before his eyes — so hard, so long that it stretches beyond Potter’s navel, sure, he’s hunching against a table, but it’s so gloriously
"You were saying something about food earlier?" Harry asks, stowing his wand away. "We could go to a bistro or pop into a supermarket and get something to go. The view along the River Seine is brilliant."
Harry’s heart is beating fast as he says, "I'm glad you said all of that. I'm so glad you finally said what you're really thinking, but it’s my choice to take the time off. I’ll return to work when I’m ready to, but for now, I just want to be with you."
A pause, full of expectation.
"Blow me," Malfoy demands, pulling away. He flops onto his back and opens his legs. "Suck my cock." Harry accedes to the request at once, slotting between his thighs and sinking down to his elbows.
Harry cranes his neck to steal a glance at Malfoy, who is moving around behind the serving line. "Prize?" he says distractedly. He had started things with just a plain desire for treacle tart, but now, he has so much more.
Draco smiles sleepily, his eyes half-lidded and looking adorably rumpled. "Hello."
A heartbeat of silence passes.
Harry recovers his equilibrium. "My apologies for my manners, or lack thereof. I haven't seen Malfoy in so long, so it's a surprise. Pleased to meet you." He takes her soft and delicate hand, so different from his rough and calloused hand. She is everything he isn’t. Proper, pretty, pureblood Astoria Greengrass, in her dazzling evening gown, expensive heels, long blond hair, perfect make-up and sparkling earrings so long that they graze her neck.
"You still talk too damn much, Malfoy. Shut the fuck up and let me strip you."
Draco agrees to the latter option, and they're off again, scrambling with their hands covering their heads in the short distance from the gardens back to the street. They can’t cast Impervius Charms on themselves, if not the Muggles might get suspicious, but at least most of the way was sheltered.
"Thank you for being so sporting about this," Malfoy says, finger-combing his hair.
Harry's greeting to Father was much cooler as he accepted the wine.
“Draco’s favourite flowers are roses, but not the bright red ones. He prefers subtle colours — lavender, silver, light pinks and blues, for example.” She raises her eyebrows meaningfully at him. “The florist at Hogsmeade does wonderful bouquets.”
“I do not.” Draco is being contrary for the sake of it, because they both know that Potter’s right. Pleased that Potter was sneaking glances at him even when he was occupied with Patil, Draco relaxes into his touch. Potter takes the hint, pressing himself closer against Draco’s back and squeezing his waist.
Harry shrugs his shoulder, and Draco straightens up. Fuck, their reflection in the mirror looks amazing; Draco's pale skin against the backdrop of Harry's tanned skin, his fair hair against Harry's jet-black hair, and Harry's holding him so close, they make such a striking couple—
cock, it's Dan's, and it's fucking weird, wanking with another guy's prick, but Harry can't care anymore 'cos there's Malfoy looking good enough to eat and wanking to
He could lay sprawled like this forever, eyes closed, body completely relaxed, and mind at ease. As he soaks, he lets the gentle swish of the water carry away all muddled thoughts about lesson plans, marking and work-related bothers. Draco sinks further into the tub, his arms floating in the water as he mulls over the term.
He's never seen Potter this vulnerable, this desirable.
Malfoy gathers his crumbs on the table and drops them on his empty plate, hesitating before he answers. “It would be quite hypocritical if I did, seeing that I prefer men, too.”
Something shifts and ripples in the air. Malfoy's looking at him expectantly, yet Harry's at a loss for words. He had no idea that Malfoy was going to share something so personal.
Draco’s filthy mind fills in the blanks — of him fucking Potter from the back, his hands digging into the other man’s hips while he pounds hard and fast into him. Draco bites a knuckle to keep himself from crying out at that delectable image, which morphs into one of him riding Potter when Potter switches position.
Scene 2 "Did you…": Let Me Know
"You said we should talk. But you can't keep your eyes off me," Harry says, lifting a shoulder in a casual shrug. "Hey," he says around a grin, waving a hand in Malfoy's face.
Harry thinks back to his auditions. He's improved by leaps and bounds since then, as proven by the deafening cheers that greet both men when they take the stage. Harry watches as Draco dances first, running his hands down his partly exposed chest — he's wearing a half-buttoned brown leather jacket with nothing underneath. He does a few rodeo rolls that accentuate his hips, and when he's facing Harry, Malfoy locks eyes with him and pops a button off his jacket. It doesn't take long before Malfoy's stripped his jacket off and thrown it into the crowd, revealing his Dark Mark and a simple black leather band wound round his left upper arm.
“Can’t sleep too?” Potter says, taking the proffered seat.
Harry Potter's glasses!" Malfoy calls. Harry's glasses jump off his face, and his world is thrown into a confusing blur of shapes and colours, but he doesn't panic. Without missing a beat, he grips his wand and casts a formidable summoning spell in the general vicinity. His glasses zoom back into his outstretched palm, and he quickly puts them on. Summoning his glasses is second nature, drilled into him by Robards.
would be the one getting me naked tonight," In a flash, Malfoy pushes Harry down on the sofa until he's on top of him, their bodies pressed flush against each other and Harry can feel Malfoy's hard prick through his jeans.
They spend a moment glaring at each other over the counter.
"Why here?! They're not shocked to see me at all! He's doing it on purpose, he just wants to piss me off all over again!" Harry had raged to Ron and Hermione that very day. His two best friends had made appropriate soothing noises, and that was why Harry tried to ignore the customers trickling into Sin, which had increased to a steady stream at the end of Sin’s first week.
Stunned, they stare at each other with wide eyes. Neither of them dares to breathe, let alone move; and they're frozen in place like a scene from one of those Hollywood movies.
"Dada?" Rose murmurs, looking at Draco.
“Hold each item, but not longer than three minutes, and decide by touch if it sparks joy. If it doesn't, it goes there," Draco says, pointing to another one of his bags.
Draco makes a small, dying sound.
“Yes. I would like that very much,” Draco answers eventually, interlacing their fingers together.
"Why didn't you tell me earlier?! I could have done something!" Harry rages, fists clenched. His anger towards Malfoy has retreated, giving way to worry and a different sort of anger directed towards the Ministry.
"Oh yes, I sent a few parcels of clothes, books and kitchenware from the Arthurs to your charities and some thrift shops," Draco says.
Later that night, his parents entered his room, their faces pale and worried.
, if you were a snake — all snarky and sarcastic and witty. I didn't notice it at first, but when I translated his words to Hermione, she pointed that out to me. And he has a problem with Ron too, for some reason," Potter says, wincing.
"They loved me so much, you know," Harry whispered, his eyes sad and faraway as he flipped to a picture of Lily kissing a young Harry's hand and James dropping a kiss on the top of Harry's head. Draco listened while Harry, aided by the photos of Ron, Hermione and Harry, chattered on about the adventures that the Golden Trio had shared then.
Malfoy shakes himself out of his stupor. He sinks down to his knees in front of Harry and begins to unbuckle his belt, undoing his jeans, taking his time to slide them off as if he's unwrapping a Christmas present. Harry's left wearing only a pair of black briefs and a big grin when Malfoy's eyes widen and his lips fall apart, having come face-to-face with the bulge in Harry's briefs. Long fingers trace their way up Harry's inner thigh, tip-toe across Harry's jutting hips before pressing down on his abdomen.
The first few chords of a saxophone — slow, sweet and romantic — start to croon.
"Don't stop, do it just like this, fuckin' perfection," Draco praises. He reaches a hand over to cling to the island for support, while his other hand teases his nipples, rubbing them until they're hard.
Draco lifts his hands from the water to show he isn’t the one doing all this magic.
"Let me buy you a drink," Harry offers, words spilling out of his mouth in a hurried tumble. Anything, anything to stop them dancing, because Harry was at the verge of losing whatever little self-control he had left. "You cleared me for the auditions, and I probably owe you another one too, for throwing my shirt at you."
Draco had had enough.
The both of them are part of something bigger than them, nothing but mere pawns playing on opposing sides of a chessboard.
Worried, Harry hurries over. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean—"
"Not yet. Memorising how you feel in me, every inch, so deep, fuckin' perfection," Harry whispers, the tip of his tongue licking the shell of Malfoy's ear. "This what you expected?"
Draco's throat closes up; it's suddenly difficult to speak over the lump in his throat. He recalls something that Potter told him. "They're always with us, loving us from afar, looking out for us. Like that night in the Forest, when you met your parents, Sirius Black and Lupin."
"I didn't ask for the petals," Malfoy says.
eager to see this mystery man perform. If he dances as good as he looks, then..." Jacob fans himself theatrically and smirks at Harry, before his expression dissolves into one of concern.
"I plan to tattoo over my Dark Mark before I leave," Draco says.
Harry throws his head back and laughs, his laughter rumbling joyfully in his chest.
The dragon whines in distress and shakes its great head in confusion, its snout thrashing wildly in the air. It snorts and huffs, black puffs of powder whooshing from its nostrils and mouth.
He has to tell Potter.
Malfoy coaches him through seven chords — C, D, E, F, G, A and B. When Harry struggles with the F and B chords, Malfoy is surprisingly patient, offering an easier version of the chords. After some practice, Harry is able to play all of the chords, although the transition between them isn’t smooth, with him taking an embarrassingly long time to change his fingering.
, Draco, I’m all in, fucking balls-deep, I’ve never, Christ, Draco, I’ve
"So close," Draco murmured and pushed his erection urgently into Harry's hand. Harry didn't know if Draco meant the jogger or his own orgasm.
His head still hanging, Draco extends his left forearm — so clenched that his biceps are as taut and rigid as cords — showing a faint black mark. The skin around it is scrubbed red and raw, and Draco turns away from the mirror as he jabs his wand at his arm and utters another spell.
Harry smiles back at the couple, who seem satisfied with his photo-taking skills. He returns to Draco's side, taking the proffered ice-cream. He licks happily at his half-eaten chocolate chocolate chunk. "Dunno. Maybe I have an approachable face." He flashes Draco a mischievous grin. "A face that you like, by the way."
"It's happened. It's finally happened!" Filius squeaks, clapping his hands gleefully as he looks at them.
"How about you go undercover too?"
Harry's face falls when Draco pulls his hand away.
"Glad you like it," Harry says, mirroring Draco's grin.
Charlie says — but he can't fall for Potter again without knowing that he returns Draco’s affections, until he's sure it doesn’t revolve around sex.
His heart drops like a boulder. He had hoped his feelings for Potter would fade with time, like pencil marks scribbled on love letters, but—
Pomona adds her money to the pile, sighing. "You two did take surprisingly long to sort things out, what with the riveting amount of unresolved sexual tension."
"So, you're here to sort things out," Potter says, gesturing to his house.
"Potter!" Malfoy hisses, scandalised.
Malfoy glances away, muttering, "Always saying what's on your mind." He looks down at his lap. "He's stable and resting at home. I wouldn't be here if his condition was critical. Mother cancelled our subscriptions to the papers, for the sake of Father's health."
"Oh!" Draco exclaims, alarmed when her eyes flicker open, revealing blue irises. She fidgets in her cocoon of blankets, prompting Draco to tighten his grip. He looks to Hermione for help, and she chuckles.
"Stop it! Stop forcing us to—"
"Yes?" Theo asks as he slices open the wrapper around the book.
After paying, they head home, eating as they walk. Harry tears away the top edge of the paper. He bites into his roll; the chicken is tender and full of flavour, while the sauce is rich with spices.
Sighing, Harry holds Draco by the wrists and pries his hands away from his face. Draco finally looks up at him, his eyes midnight with sadness.
After a few moments, they break apart. Potter’s eyes are glazed over in a daze, and his lips form a giddy half-smile. Draco wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and smirks.
Harry's grin fades, and he straightens up. He pushes the stroller with Draco treading beside him.
"It's Harry and Malfoy, they've always had a bloody round-about way of doing things," Ron huffs and shovels another handful of popcorn in his mouth.
Harry doesn't know how long he's been standing there in rapture, drinking in the sight of Draco like a castaway in the desert gulping down water.
"I need time, Harry," Draco says eventually, heartache scrawled all over his eyes. Upset, he backs away and turns on his heel.
Draco grabs his things from Potter, cutting him off in mid-sentence. "Would love to stop and chat, but I'm in a bit of a rush. See you tomorrow."
“Okay.” Harry sees himself out. Before he closes the door, he looks at Malfoy, slumped on the sofa and his back turned towards him.
Harry slows from a sprint to a brisk walk, his heart racing in his chest. He hides in the shadows behind a nearby tree and peers around it.
“You want to know why I left the Academy,” he murmurs.
Harry grunts when a pint-sized, squealing fireball of red hair and bunched-up fists launches herself at his legs.
Potter always knows how to push his buttons.
He's already burnt this image into his memory.
"No. He's not exactly what you'd call a friend," Malfoy murmurs silkily, his eyes studying Harry.
"I didn't hear anything from you! And I thought we were friends!"
A large and luxurious wingback bed, complete with plump pillows, silver satin sheets and a thick fluffy duvet, is the centrepiece of the Room. On the nearby table, there is a big, steaming pot of minestrone soup and a large plate of chips. Draco looks down at his empty plate — they've been munching on chips as they trudged around the castle. Tucked to the side is a door, no doubt leading to an en-suite.
Harry snorts in amusement. "What's that supposed to mean? I gotta… slay a Hippogriff and present it to your parents or something like that?" He jokes, chortling.
He's reminded of Mother tucking him in bed as a child, the warmth of her touch and the love in her eyes as she stroked his hair and tugged the covers up to his chin.
Sharing one bed.
He pulls away, serious. “I can’t promise you anything, but I would like to get to know you better.”
“I’m going to get married to Harry Potter,” he whispers.
for you, but this don't change anything, fuck no," Malfoy turns over and misses his pillow entirely — instead his body ends up sprawled diagonally across the bed, elbows balanced precariously on the edge of the bed and his head leaning over while he continues to wank, and Harry's eyes instantly latch onto Malfoy's bobbing arse that's so ready for
Yeah, it's still a long way to go when, or if, that happens, but well...
"Yeah, I understand," Harry says, eager to change the subject. "We've never had a conversation like this without fighting or snogging, so I get what you mean."
"Crystal," Malfoy grits out, and Harry barely has time to pull the Ears back and make sure he's still secure underneath his Cloak before Malfoy yanks the door open and storms out. Harry tries to peer inside the room before the door closes, but all he can see is a shock of white-blond hair, a stark contrast to the darkened surroundings.
"Hey," Harry croaks, looking up at him. He slides his palms up Malfoy's thighs, his touch grazing the soft hairs. He reaches for Malfoy's arse, squeezing his cheeks. Just the thought of what they’re gonna do tonight, bloody hell…
him all over again, but it's different this time, not any less mind-blowing than the hot, desperate kisses that they had shared just two hours ago, but
“What d’you want? You’ve been knocking for the past two days,” Malfoy mutters, huffing out a loud sigh, his exhale lifting up his fringe briefly. “You’re like a damn Crup without a bone.”
"Wanna be so good for you," Malfoy mumbles. He lifts his head, eyes half-lidded and dazed.
"Nothing! Just thought I'd... er... stop by and say hi," Harry says, while stamping hard on the Popper to put it out. He tilts his head up, and after a quick scan of his surroundings, gives George a dirty look when he spots him. In return, George merely winks and gives him a thumbs-up. The last thing George hears before retreating to his office is Malfoy saying to Harry, "I heard you were back in town."
"I'll miss you so much," Hermione says, her face crumpling in sorrow and her words dissolving into tears. She lunges towards him and pulls him into a hug. He wraps his arms around her at once, inhaling the minty scent of her shampoo and the feel of her curls against his cheek. Behind her, Ron nods at him.
“Well, it’s obvious they enjoyed football,” Draco says, hoping to smooth over the sudden tension.
Malfoy unfastens Harry’s trousers and works his hand into his pants. Harry rests his forehead on the other boy’s shoulder, his own hand stroking Malfoy’s hip. They’ll get each other off yet again, with Malfoy's touch overpowering Harry's rational thinking every single time. They'll pretend that there's nothing between them, but with every encounter, Harry's aching heart says otherwise, and he doesn't know how much more he can take—
“No!” Potter growls. “It’s you. Don’t you fucking get it, Malfoy?” He draws up to his full height and advances towards Draco, bath water cascading down his chest. Draco flattens himself against the side of the tub. “I was missing something important, not having you to push against, not seeing your face every morning in the pantry, duelling with people that didn’t present half the challenge you did.” He scrubs his face with his palms, sighing. “It’s you. It’s always been you.” These last few words emerge so quietly, as if they were meant for Potter himself.
A grinning George crouches on the winding staircase of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, concealing himself behind the banister. He glances down at Harry, who is lurking behind a shelf on the first storey of the shop, before lighting the miniature version of a Whizz Popper and lobbing it down a safe distance beside Harry.
He bottles up the memory of Draco, wrapped in his Gryffindor scarf and looking up at the moon, using it like one of Draco's healing potions to soothe his grieving heart.
"It was just that one night-"
Annoyed, Draco pulls out and drives in,
Feeling especially cheeky, Harry winks at Malfoy and drags his tongue slowly across the bottom of his upper lip, all the while locking eyes with Malfoy. Harry feels a hot surge of annoyance as Malfoy's face doesn't change. Snarling under his breath, Harry strides across the stage, his steps matching the rhythm of the song. The music's picking up now, both in volume and speed, and Harry syncs himself to the change — head thrown back and nodding to the beat, eyes closed, fingers buried in his messy hair, bottom lip popping out between teeth in a playful pout, wandering palms pressed against hips moving with increased urgency, almost of their own accord —
Ignoring Bacon's warnings, which are increasing in frequency and volume, Harry continues working furiously on the charms, and it isn't long before he's unearthed a safe-
Draco recalls Hermione's perceptive remark about Potter living with too many ghosts. He's tempted to ask him about it, but it's too soon for that. "Was this Granger's idea?"
"Oh bloody hell. This means that I'll have to get used to having the ferret around when they eventually do get together, don't I?"
Yes, they certainly are very well acquainted with each other’s bodies, but they’ve never gone all the way; it’s clear something is holding Malfoy back.
“I may be living like a Muggle, but I’m still a wizard,” Malfoy drawls, ducking into a quiet alleyway. “I Apparate home from here, but I’m rather peckish. There’s a place near my flat that I like.”
Malfoy makes a sound of impatience, rolling his hips once and giving an eager wiggle of his arse. Harry snaps into action and positions himself behind him. He squeezes Malfoy’s arse and presses his thumbs onto pale skin, exposing Malfoy. Harry lowers his head and releases a puff of air at Malfoy's entrance, so he knows what's coming. Malfoy tenses, before stretching his legs backwards and relaxing. Harry gathers some saliva on the tip of his tongue, and then touches his tongue to Malfoy's hole.
Scene 7 "It's raining": RM & Yuiko - Umbrella
Potter blinks, the hesitance fading in his eyes. “Yeah?” A playful grin forms on his lips. His right hand forms a loose fist that encircles his prick, and he begins to stroke himself, his thumb smearing pre-come all over the head. “You sure?”
Harry can’t answer for the others, but he spent it falling in love with Malfoy.
Harry’s body is trembling, his chest is heaving and he’s clenching and unclenching his fists. “Do you… do you know how long I waited for to get those tickets and to make all of the arrangements?”
It's four in the morning when they exit the pub.
Sin and Sugarcoated are no longer safe; that's why they're here at the Leaky for refuge.
When the show ends, he kisses the top of Draco's head. Draco mumbles something. He slowly lifts his chin, rubbing his eyes and blinks up at Harry.
When Draco has a rough day at work, Harry makes a strong mug of tea for him and leaves him alone for a while. Then he'll ask him if he'd like to talk about it. If he does, Harry will listen as he rants. If not, Harry will give him space and just be around, whether he wants cuddles and kisses or someone to watch the telly with. The next day, Harry will turn up at his workplace, bearing a bag of his favourite chocolates and a reservation to a nice dinner place.
He will not let his past mistakes cloud the true significance of what, or who, is important to him.
Draco pockets the letter and leaves the house. He Apparates to the destination, and after a quick check of the address, knocks on the door. He folds his arms and taps his foot on the ground as he waits.
Draco recalls Pansy’s uncertainty at the sport, although he can’t imagine her kicking a ball around the field, either.
," he says, and Harry knows immediately that he has to sneak into the room as soon as possible and get his hands on whatever
Malfoy laughs, a lovely, bright sound that makes Harry warm all over. "Only if you return the favour, Harry."
Malfoy hits that spot again, eyeing Harry closely.
Harry nods fervently, his cock stiffening further at the memory. “You were gagging for it.” Malfoy threw him down on the Slytherin table and sucked him off with so much enthusiasm that Harry came in record time. Malfoy eyed his spent cock, made a desperate sound and swallowed him again, ignoring Harry’s surprised gasp and sucking him for what felt like ages until he wrung another orgasm from Harry.
Malfoy moves to the back of the class, looks at them, and then mimics their position. He bends forward at the hips and lowers his upper body, hands gripping his right shin.
Swallowing, Draco guides Potter to the longer section of the L-shaped sofa to stretch their bodies out. When Potter's settled down with his head resting on the low arm-rest of the sofa, Draco climbs on top of him and sprinkles a trail of kisses from Potter's lips all the way down to his belly.
"You're the one who kissed me, you idiot," Harry growled.
"You'll know when the time comes, you prat."
"I wanted the kids to live somewhere happy." Harry shrugs. "We practically had to tear half the place apart during the re-modelling. Even now, I think there are still some rooms we know nothing about."
A noxious cocktail of jealousy, resentment and disappointment flares in Draco at the memory of opening the paper and seeing details of Potter’s love and sex life splashed on the gossip pages. Whenever he saw it, he would storm into his room for an angry wank.
Draco stands rooted to the ground for a moment, before they move down the long driveway, Harry’s presence giving him strength.
With that rational thought lodged firmly in his brain, Draco goes to the loo to splash cold water on his face and give his dick a quick rinse in the shower.
"You said you prefer British men. The last time I checked, you can only get them in Britain." Potter shrugs and fiddles with his earring—a single black stud—on his left earlobe.
The war, along with its consequences, is still something that they tiptoe around, an issue that they will not address overtly, at least not at this point in their friendship. George still averts his eyes from Malfoy’s Dark Mark, and Malfoy still hides his left forearm behind his back whenever he catches George looking away.
Harry offers the bottle to Malfoy, who shakes his head. He replaces the water and grabs the lube. “Ready for another go?”
They exit the stands, and Weasley and Theo take their leave after a round of goodbyes.
They walk in strained silence, and when they turn down another corridor, Harry recognises the furnishings of the area. He knows his way back, but he keeps quiet, wanting this private moment with Malfoy. The question, bubbling and simmering inside him for years, is poised at the tip of his tongue. He knows it's way too early for this landmine of a conversation, but he can't bear it anymore.
He wants Harry to belong to himself and no one else.
Draco should retreat, but memories of Potter being a recluse, taking time off work and messing about with his guitar all day when the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts looms; when a helpless Hermione confides in Draco about Potter’s grief when birthdays of the deceased approach, and those long hours spent at the graves of war victims—
It’s bloody ironic that Malfoy got mad over Oliver, because Harry made up his mind then to go after Malfoy. That night, Harry rejected Oliver, and the older man merely removed his hand, took a long swig of his beer and asked,
Malfoy blinks — it's as if George's words have snapped him out of some sort of spell. He slips on his professionalism like a cloak.
"This is it, then?" Ron had said, coughing a bit at the dust.
"But that is a mere technicality! You forget that I know
The question is unexpected, and it takes a while for Draco to marshal his thoughts after getting over the surprise of Potter calling him emotionally mature. "I learnt some things along the way as I tidied people's homes. They tell me stories, new perspectives. Behind every sentimental item lies a story. Most of them I forget, but some... some I remember." Like a breath of fresh air amidst the monotony of clearing clothes and books, there was a time when a grandmother talked fondly about her late husband, and another occasion when a Muggle lady reminisced about her son who passed away in the military.
"Well, it worked!" Pansy cheers. Both Hermione and Pansy raise their pints, beckoning Blaise and Ron to do the same. They follow, albeit rather glumly.
"Weasley. Granger... see you around," Zabini murmurs, nodding at the both of them. Hermione tilts her head curiously at the spark in his smile and the twinkle in his eyes. She watches as the Slytherins hurry across the street.
!” from the other side of the door, it reminds Draco of—
Harry steps back, stunned. He wouldn't have put it past Malfoy to vanish for a much-needed holiday or a particular bad bout of the flu, but the Ministry?!
. Harry opens his mouth, wanting to tell Draco how good he looks, how lucky he is to have someone like Draco, but he knows that no words can ever express his feelings. All he can do is show him...
"I still have Ron and Hermione, yeah?" Potter says, looking at a photograph of his friends in Hagrid's album. The sorrow in his eyes melts away, and something in his demeanour softens. "Friends that care about me, almost died for me." He runs a hand through his hair. "It's just that..." He sighs. "I dunno, thinking like this makes me feel so bloody selfish. They're getting married. They'll start a family, and…" He trails off, eyes downcast. "And I'll be alone."
"I do it only 'cos you like it," Draco flashes him a silky grin and trails his hands up and down, and then back up Potter's bare chest. Squeezes his shoulders, sucks on his neck and earlobe while his hips sway in full figure eights to the music. Draco moves to the front, smiles and regards Potter with half-lidded eyes.
Draco's still staring at the tape recorder while the sound of Harry pulling off his underwear crackles through the recorder.
on his figure.
He thinks of lazy Sundays spent in bed with Harry, of burnt toast and scrambled eggs and rained-in days. Despite all their fights and arguments, Harry's changed his heart into a star that would never dim; Harry's untangled the knots in his heart and the jumble in his head with just one touch, one word when Draco gets too lost in his nightmares of their past.
To his credit, Malfoy respected that. Although things had got rather heated that one night when Harry had kissed Malfoy up against the door of his flat, his fingers grazing the waistband of his pants, Malfoy grinding his hips up encouragingly, so Harry's hand went down, down...
Apparently, Draco isn’t alone in taking advantage of the pleasant weather.
They've got so much baggage between them that it could fill up an airport — all their childish schoolyard fights and their blood-stained history wedged between them like a third shadow — and it seems impossible to craft a relationship out of this, but-
"I'm glad that you like the view, because you know what, Harry?" Draco's voice drops, and Harry pumps his cock faster. "Because I love sucking you off, too. I love having your cock between my lips. I love it when you tangle your fingers in my hair... when you make me take it even deeper, every single fucking inch of you in my mouth. I..." Draco moans. "I... love it when you hit the back of my throat and I'm still— oh
The incantation wilts on his lips when a cat Patronus bounds into his room. Its mouth opens, and Minerva's voice, calm, yet laced with urgency, emerges. "Teachers, your assistance is required at Charlie Weasley's hut. If you see any students on your way, send them back to their dorms at once. Heads of Houses, order your prefects to keep the students indoors. No one is allowed outside under any circumstances. Please hurry."
"Hello," Malfoy whispers with a seductive smile, his lashes fluttering.
“That’s sweet,” Potter says, tucking a lock of hair behind Draco’s ear. “But it’s not that.” He undoes his jeans. “Quite the opposite, in fact,” he says in a rather resigned air.
“And what about you?” the vendor asks Harry, as he pulls a flatbread towards him.
Harry was hoping that things would end differently, but…
Harry nods amidst his confusion. Parkinson throws him a strange look as Neville leads her away. He watches as they hold each other and rock to a slow, romantic song. The other couples in their group are dancing too, lost in their own world of two.
shoulders, the frantic snapping of Potter’s hips, and when his cock pushes against Draco’s prostate one more time—
Malfoy, bearing two Firewhiskys, settles down on the sofa beside him. Harry takes a deep gulp of his drink, grinning when grey eyes swivel to his throat, down to the dip of his collarbones and the vee of his T-shirt.
Draco has never seen him look so vulnerable before.
“No, not at all! It’s brilliant hearing this from you. That’s what I feel too, although I probably can’t express it as eloquently,” Potter says, and his earnest tone makes Draco look up.
"Not this one," Harry whispers back.
"When were you going to tell me?!" Draco snarls between furious kisses and the urgent tussle of limbs. Potter's kissing him hard, hands clawing at the buttons of his shirt and grabbing his arse
All of Harry's attention had snapped to that single word.
"Yes."
The thought of leaving London, leaving Potter after they've reconnected, is entirely unbearable. There will be time later tonight when Draco will lie in bed alone and gaze longingly at Potter's tattoo, but for now, he desperately needs his touch again.
Draco has never held a newborn baby before, so he hesitates when Hermione holds Rose Granger-Weasley out to him.
Taking that as approval, Draco closes his eyes and swirls his tongue around Potter's rim, circling it in a steady pace. It's Potter's extremely good luck that he's especially skilled at rimjobs, having had lots of practice to prepare his previous lovers for his cock. Since he's already fucked Potter, he's loose enough for Draco's tongue to go slightly deeper, but not too deep as he'd rather his fingers do the work later.
Harry's self-righteous annoyance deflates, and he goes to Draco's side. "Yeah. We should.” He hesitates, before wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist and squeezing. Draco stiffens for a second, and then he hugs Harry tightly, his apology trembling in his touch.
“You believe me, because you know he’s back. You know he’s back because your father was there in the graveyard. Your father watched and laughed as Voldemort tried to kill me, a sixteen-year-old boy! I almost died, Draco! Would you have even cared if I had
“What if I saw some bloke leaving your place? What if you chased me away?” Draco lifts his chin and pushes his shoulders back, a steely determination glinting in his eyes. “I don't regret not asking you to stay, because what would have become of us? I wasn't in the right frame of mind to take this further. I want you to get the best of me, because that’s what you deserve. I want to get better for myself."
"I was drunk! Don't you say weird shit when you're drunk too, Malfoy?" Potter throws his hands up in frustration. "I can't believe you've got it wrong all this time! I'm not chasing you for the sex. Yeah, sure, I wanna shag you, you're fit like hell, I'm not gonna deny that, but has it ever crossed your mind that I might want other things besides sex?"
Both men freeze and stare at each other, their eyes wide with trepidation and horror.
Draco sinks back into the pillow and picks up his book. His eyes loop over and over on the same paragraph. It's no use, his mind is drifting away to the kiss again: Harry's slightly chapped lips against his own, the scent of his shampoo and the warmth of his body.
Ron pauses in forking a mouthful of Yorkshire pudding. He puts his fork down. "Course not. He did look at me all shocked for a bit, but I just shrugged, said something about you being stressed lately, and paid for our meals."
Harry, the cheeky little shit, simply shoots him a winning smile and says in a smooth glib tone, "If it'll make you feel any better, I'll make up for
"Of course," Harry mutters. He steps to the side, a heavy sensation pooling in his belly.
"You're infuriating, you know that?" Draco snarls. Even before he's finished with his sentence, he's sliding in again, because any second that he's not inside that tight, welcoming heat is agony—
"I also did not expect Muggle jeans to be so... tight," she murmured, much to Draco's horror when he realised that his mother was checking out his father's
Yes, he's got many things to do, but you know what?
Potter's eyes flutter open and he mirrors Draco's weak grin. "Fuck you, Malfoy. Reckon it's time to call me Harry since you've got your prick so far up my arse."
He's a fool, a lovesick fool for Malfoy.
He misses Harry.
Draco clears his throat. "May I have the pleasure of your company in France on your birthday week?"
Potter grabs his hand under the table. "So, I'm gonna keep him close to me from now on," he finishes, the uncertainty of his shifting eyes giving way to a mischievous spark of a smile when he looks at Draco’s heated cheeks.
And then, a voice — melodic, clear and strong — rings out in an a cappella, cutting through the noise of the pub and going straight to Harry's heart.
Harry gasps and struggles against Ron, who is also Disillusioned. Ron is so close that his stubble rasps against Harry's cheek. With his arms locked around Harry's waist, Ron grunts and lugs Harry further away from Draco.
, you know," Draco points out while he fiddles with the collar of his oversized white shirt.
Ron and Hermione understood the enmity; they've got front-row tickets to the punches and insults and kicks that Harry and Malfoy hurl towards each other. But what they don’t understand is that they fight now not to hurt.
Now that Draco’s got his answer, he can start the process of finally getting over Potter.
Harry wandlessly Summons the most recent acquisition to the wall. It's a photo of Draco, Hermione and Rose enjoying a picnic lunch at the park — the same park they visit every Christmas. Draco's throwing his head back and laughing — Harry can imagine his lovely, full-bodied laughter — with Rose in his arms, while a smiling Hermione alternates between reading from a children's book in her lap and holding Rose's hand.
his hateful words salting the air.
"You kinky fuck."
and presses further. "What sort of bloke does he fancy?"
But they can't stop.
— making Hermione spill ink all over her notes. He chucked the entire paper into the fireplace, hurtled to his kitchen and spent the entire day with chocolate.
Harry blinks at his rapidly retreating figure. "Damn it, Malfoy. Stop running!" He catches up to the other man and whirls him around by the arm. "We were one week away from finishing, and everything was alright, but you just upped and left without any warning! One day you were there, and the next, you weren't. Robards said you left, and... and my owls to you kept returning unread. Where did you go, and why? Why couldn't you tell me?"
" Jacob immediately falls silent when Malfoy raises his eyebrows at him meaningfully. "Oh yes. Long, rich tradition of asking good-looking new strippers to the pub. Club unity and all that," Jacob says and wipes the counter down, fighting to keep a cheeky grin off his face.
The two goons share a look, glance at the general vicinity where Bacon and Harry are huddled up and shrug. They follow Malfoy out of the corridor.
Draco picks up his quill and writes down something from the book onto a piece of parchment. His posture is relaxed, easy. There's a plate of jam roly-polys and a cup of chamomile (Draco's favourite tea) steaming gently in front of him.
"What are you begging for? A blowjob, or me to get naked?" Draco asks as he turns to face Potter, his shoulders and waist moving to the music. He flings his arms out and drops his hands to his head, catching his fingers playfully through blond hair. Under Draco's sexually potent look, Potter's hands squirm under his tie and his hips wriggle on the chair.
"Let me take you to a holiday in France for your birthday," Draco says, surprisingly nervous. He thought about it last night while Potter was snoring away. He hasn’t proposed anything like this to his previous lovers (which weren't that many, to be honest). He reckons their travelling styles would be rather different — Potter is definitely the outdoors type and keen on everything, while Draco prefers to stay inside in a good cafe or a museum.
Scene 4 “Cabo da Roca”: Jungkook - Euphoria (Piano Version)
"Harry, I don't think you understand." Malfoy's tone is cool, collected and controlled, a coquettish smirk winking on his lips. He presses two fingers, his index and middle finger, right in the middle of Harry's chest, and then slowly walks them up to the base of his throat. He leans forward, his lips pressed below Harry's earlobe. He whispers Harry’s name, a sound like liquid sex that goes straight to Harry's cock. “You can do anything you want to me,” he purrs, his voice as light and seductive as molten chocolate wrapped in luxurious silk.
It's too dark to be St. Mungo's.
Draco. Hold tight, alright? We're gonna Apparate," Harry says, shaking Malfoy.
"Imagine my luck when he told me that you were in charge of this. If it had been any other Auror, they would have locked me up in a heartbeat. I can't leave London, not with my mother in this condition, but neither could I stay, so you were my best bet. I helped you, and you, in turn, will help my mother get treated at St. Mungo's," Malfoy smirks at Harry, angling his body towards Harry. "Never knew that Gryffindor integrity would end up in my favour one day."
mocked at for my scars! I've paid by having the Mark branded on me, my family name dragged through the mud, and
He brings Harry’s hand up to his lips and kisses the back of his hand. "I saw your paintings, and I was so close to dropping my Glamour and approaching you, but I wasn't ready. I went back to Florida, and after a while, to London." A long pause. "To Horizont Alley."
"Yes," Draco lies. Relief floods Potter's face. Draco hauls Potter's left leg up from the back of the sofa and rests it against his chest. After making sure that Potter's comfortable, Draco begins to rock his hips, being extra careful to not fuck Potter with his whole cock. Although it's only half, it still feels so damn fucking good...
"Full day of training, late session with some Ravenclaws in crap weather, stayed back to pack up," he mutters. "Am grumpy, tired, cold and dirty, and won't be good company until after a shower and some food. But you can come in if you wanna, you'll have to bear with me for a bit.”
It's strange how Ron and Hermione had acted when he told them about The Umbrella Incident — Hermione had been rather adamant about Harry visiting Sin to return it, while Ron had that constipated look on his face as if he wanted to tell Harry something really, really badly.
that some of it reaches his shoulder blades.
Draco smells freshly-brewed coffee before he enters the kitchen. True to his word, Potter's at the stove making breakfast.
A dizzying gust of anger storms through him.
“Didn’t think you could be this romantic,” Draco teases as they tuck into his favourite dishes.
"Fuck, Malfoy, your cock," Potter marvels and tilts his head to admire it from all angles, his hand descending to squeeze his own cock. Draco knows he's supposed to be pleased at Potter's reaction, but he knows how things usually end: he's had men with similar reactions, as if Draco's cock is Merlin's gift to wizardkind, but the minute they tried to fuck, it was either too thick, too hard or too long, or worse — all three.
But that would never happen, because Potter hates him and as a result, Draco would always be on the outside looking in. With that sobering thought lodged in his mind, he scowls, slams the last of the dessert labels in the display and goes to his kitchen. He doesn’t want to be anywhere where he can see Potter's face.
Malfoy squeezes back, his half-lidded eyes smoky. He sets his guitar down, props it against the wall and turns back to Harry. "Hi," he says, rather breathlessly. A breeze flutters his fringe. Malfoy takes a step closer, and Harry mirrors the movement. Moonlight glimmers on Malfoy's earrings, grey eyes dip to Harry's mouth, and Harry quickly licks his lips, hoping they're not too chapped. Malfoy's breath catches, eyelids fluttering closed, and Harry leans in too. His heart is hammering at this culmination of the inevitable, inexorable pull between them—
Eventually, Harry clears his throat.
It’s Malfoy — familiar and provocative, yet different and intriguing, and it’s bizarre how much Harry wants to know more about this Malfoy, wants him to grin at him like that. Harry’s drink is neglected, his hood pushed down, and he has scooted forward in his chair as he enjoys the sight of Malfoy in the spotlight, mesmerising the entire room with his music. It’s brilliant how expressive his singing is — his voice as low and intimate as rustling bedsheets for love songs, upbeat and cheerful for happy songs, yet poignant and emotional for ballads.
"Potter, you come back right now so I can tell you I like you, you...
"I've got a few friends in the Ministry," Harry says, unfazed. He pulls out his mobile phone and taps on the screen. "It's four in the afternoon now. We'll spend the evening there, and I can have you home before midnight." He pauses, looks at Draco and chuckles. "It's almost as if you're Cinderella."
George grins mischievously to himself.
"Now who's the kinky fuck?" Harry growls, to which Draco pulls off, flashes a silky, self-satisfied smile and dives back in.
"Just me. Only me." Malfoy grits out between clenched teeth. He bats Harry’s hand away and releases his cock, only to rest his elbows on either side of Harry’s head, trapping him. They're grinding now, each heated push and roll of their hips increasing their pleasure to a fever-pitch as they chase their orgasms.
“Nature? Somewhere with nature?” Harry interrupts. “Central Park?”
Harry turns.
With his face suddenly engulfed in a hot blush, Harry bows and practically runs off the stage back to the dressing-room, where he strips off the thong and pulls on proper clothes. His ears are still ringing from the music and excitement's still fizzing in his bloodstream as if someone's popped open a bottle of champagne in him.
"You look so good," Draco praises. With that, Draco rises up to his knees, opens his mouth wide and
And he gets a wild,
and Draco hated him but wanted him all at the same time-
George doesn't know whether to bang his head against the nearest solid surface in frustration or to dissolve into fits of laughter. He quickly composes himself and strolls around the corner with a nonchalant air.
"Did you see what Binns did?"
At the loss of Harry's touch, Draco's nerve endings heave their shoulders and sigh in disappointment.
"Oh, you know how it is. I go home for summer, she cuts it, I go to Romania and then back home, she cuts it again, I grow it out during school term, and there it goes again." He huffs in exasperation. "You'd think she'd lay off, seeing that I'm already thirty-five." He looks at Draco. "Speaking of mothers, how's yours?"
"Fuck!" Harry cries out, his nerves singing with the sudden sensation of being engulfed in Malfoy's velvety warm mouth. The head of his cock hits the back of his throat, and Malfoy moans, triggering a gasp from Harry.
The kitchen is clean, the cleanest that it has ever been because it is hardly used these days. The fridge hasn't seen a slice of treacle tart in months. A Gryffindor mug, thoroughly scrubbed, sits on the back of the rack of cups. Beside the cups, there's a repaired yellow teapot engraved with sunflowers. If you look closer, you can see that strangely familiar crack between two sunflowers near the spout, as if to preserve the memory of someone who was very important in this house, but was no longer here.
Marjorie looks to his right. “He’s coming this way, so why not ask him yourself?” She winks at him, and then turns to Malfoy. “Your usual?” she asks. He nods, pulling up a terse smile. Marjorie raises her eyebrows at him, before moving away.
within Harry snaps
It's Draco's first Christmas without Harry. No matter how busy either of them were, they made sure to spend Christmas together. Well, there was that one year when Harry had been posted to Birmingham during the Christmas week. Draco had all but given up hope of him coming home on time, but Harry had tumbled from the Floo at eleven o'clock on Christmas night with a lopsided grin, bloodied robes and a rather crumpled present under his arm.
Malfoy rolls his eyes without malice. "I'll be in my lab if you need me," he says in a curt voice, although something in his expression softens when his gaze falls on Harry. With that, he turns on his heel and leaves.
He can still remember how he had fisted Cedric’s shirt — stained with dirt and blood — in his hands; the hard and heavy thump of his lifeless body on the ground and the taste of his own tears in his mouth, tears that fell right on Cedric’s chest — a chest that no longer housed a beating heart; Amos Diggory’s howls of sorrow renting the air like the echoes of a gun-shot-
"Malfoy, Potter clean-up on aisle two!" George hollers against Malfoy's closed laboratory door.
Throwing all caution to the wind, Draco straightens his back, wraps a hand around Potter's waist, closes his eyes and kisses Potter.
Before he knows what he's doing, Harry's undone his own jeans and pulled his cock out. It's not
"You alright?" Bacon asks at once. Harry nods, closes his eyes to recover his equilibrium and lets the snake crawl up his body so they can Apparate home.
"I need a shower," Harry pipes up. "Coming?" Without waiting for an answer, he gets out of bed and pads towards the bathroom. Upon seeing Harry's limp and an accompanying wince, Draco hauls himself out of bed and picks through the crashed lamp and the toppled dresser to retrieve the flask of golden potion before following Harry.
They enter the drawing room. When a screech of laughter rings from the rooms upstairs, Harry closes the door behind him.
"I returned to the office after you tried to break in, and sure enough, the security spells had been tampered with. That's how I knew that you had discovered the safe and needed the key-code."
She blinks at his AC/DC T-shirt, raising her eyebrows at the crumbs. Harry hastily wipes them off, looking at her attire—a sleeveless blue blouse that brings out her eyes and black jeans. Her make-up is light, and her hair is tied up into a ponytail. She's prettier like this, someone that Harry can imagine seeing at the grocery store or a café.
He's Dan Felton, not Harry Potter. That thought hits him,
"Just leave me alone, please," Draco mutters, his good mood rapidly dissipating. He makes to push past Potter, but the other man catches his elbow and yanks him closer.
“You’re doing so well,” Potter whispers, his words ending in a sigh as he eases in. “So good, so tight for me.” He gazes at Draco’s face, searching for any signs of discomfort. His arms are trembling with the effort of holding himself up, careful not to push harder than necessary.
Fuck, Harry can't decide through the flood of lust storming in his system. Images of sex with Malfoy tumble through his mind — bending Malfoy over the sink in the bathroom and fucking him while they lock eyes in the mirror, their cries echoing off the walls; or being fucked by a panting Malfoy slamming into him over and over and over again — proud, controlled, neat, stiff Malfoy losing all control because of Harry's body-
Draco pushes down the overwhelming wave of emotion rising within him and shuffles his chair nearer to the bed. He accepts the baby and holds her close to his chest. She's swaddled in a thick blue blanket embroidered with yellow ducks. There's a faint dusting of red hair on the crown of her head, and he can't help but grin when he grazes his finger down one of her chubby cheeks. Her fingers are so, so small—
They exchange soppy grins for a moment, and then Potter grabs his jeans.
"Going back to school nicknames again, are we? Let's see about that, Scarhead!” Draco grunts when a fist slams into his shoulder. He regroups quickly, hauling Potter close and hissing, “You couldn’t have missed me much, could you? All of your fucking conquests in the
, could walk in," Draco manages between gasps when Harry pushes his trousers and pants off his hips and starts to fondle him.
Halfway into the song, Harry shifts his chair so that more of his body is tilted towards Draco. He rests an arm on the top of his chair, and pillows his head on his arm, a dreamy smile on his face as he gazes at Draco in dark-eyed rapture. Draco mirrors his smile, desire and longing turning his voice low and intimate.
"I thought that maybe... you wanted to do something right?" Harry tries uncertainly. Apparently this isn't the right thing to say at all, for Draco's eyes flash angrily.
," Harry sweeps his arm out and announces grandly in a rather mangled French accent, making Draco snicker. "You wanted somewhere quiet with a nice view, and I remember you like colourful things. This should fit the bill."
"Turn over. I want you on your chest," he orders. Harry obeys, his mouth dry as Malfoy gets on top, straddling him. Malfoy's fingernails scratch against the bowl as he scrapes up the remaining chocolate and drips it from the base of Harry's neck — Harry shivers — down the delicate knobs of his spine, all the way down, down the arch of his back, and when his fingers ghost over his arse — Harry's legs fall apart at once and Malfoy chuckles.
—wearing nothing but the tiniest pair of pants Draco has ever seen.
Draco sniffs. "I do not gobble, thank you very much."
Harry rubs his cock roughly,
Harry lifts up his head at the sound of Draco’s voice. Draco is standing in the living room and pulling his coat on. Harry puts his glasses on and nods. They Floo to Ron and Hermione’s. When they hear Hermione’s shrill voice and the wails of a toddler, Draco swears under his breath and hurries to Rose at once.
“What’s in it for you? I know you well enough to know that you don’t have a habit of sacrificing your time and effort for nothing in return,” Potter says, his gentle tone soothing his words. He’s stopped eating, and the full glare of his attention is slightly disconcerting for Draco.
Harry knows he lives alone and is British, going by the accent discernible even through his singing. He’s definitely a wizard too, as this is a magical building — unlike the Ministry of Magic, MACUSA places strict restrictions on the residences of foreign wizarding folk in order to reinforce the separation between wizards and No-Majs. There’s also a high chance that he’s gay too, as Harry chose a gay-friendly location (although he did run into a straight couple at the lift yesterday).
Draco hauls himself out of bed and hurries out of the room.
Draco is sitting on their favourite park bench at the edge of the market, a small smile playing on his lips as he soaks in the festivities. There's a towering Christmas tree in the middle of the market, complete with glittering baubles, sparkling tinsel and a cluster of gifts around the base of the tree. The market is heaving with families, couples and last-minute shoppers. He had not been in the mood to lose himself in the hustle and bustle of the crowd, choosing instead to indulge in a mug of mulled wine to chase the cold away.
"Swear you'll owl me once you've settled down at home," he whispers, stealing another brief kiss. "Don't run away again. Not this time."
"Have you been listening? I've spent the past ten minutes telling you how we came this close to having a shouting match the first time we’d spoken in years."
Harry's breath hitches.
Harry normally did the shopping. Last Sunday, Draco had removed the shopping list written in Harry’s handwriting from the fridge and added to it. It was strange entering the shops without Harry, but he had made his purchases without breaking down at the treacle tart aisle.
"I wasn't wrong then, was I?"
The students cheer, and they retreat to a safe distance, settling down on the stone benches lining the courtyard.
Yep, still looking good and
“How do you always know where I am?” Draco asks, his pulse racing at the sight of the other boy. That’s something he’s always wondered about ever since their… arrangement, which consisted of Draco waiting in an empty classroom at night and Potter turning up unerringly in said classroom.
With that thought lodged firmly in his brain, Harry turns and runs.
Harry plops down on the bed, his eyes roaming to the variety of jars and tubes of lubricant on the nightstand. He twists open a red jar, sniffs it and gags at the cloying scent of strawberry. He flicks through the selection, finally settling on a tube of clear, non-scented lube and putting it on the bed.
A pause.
Harry's entire being lights up with longing.
Harry switches off the small lamp beside him, pushes his easel away, and pads over to the side of his own balcony, his heart lifting at the sight of Malfoy looking adorably rumpled — hair artfully tousled, top of his black shirt unbuttoned, revealing a teasing glimpse of collarbone and chest. He's wearing dark-grey trousers, and his feet are bare, just like Harry. He must've returned from a show, which means it should be rather late.
Potter's eyes sparkle with amusement. "She said you hide loads of things well, but when it comes to me, you’re rather bad at it. She told me not to waste any time, and I reckon she's right. I mean, I've almost died twice, so... seize the day and all that," Potter says, shrugging his shoulders.
Outside, the sky shifts in colour as the dawn of a new day chases away the shadows of the night.
The older man fixes Harry with a stern look. "He's my friend, too. I won't have you hurt him." Harry doesn't have time to splutter in protest before Charlie continues, "I would advise you to go home and have a proper think about it during the holidays. Maybe you're feeling like this because you're cooped up here and seeing him every day, as if life is constrained to within these four walls. You might think better with a clearer head back in London. You know how impulsive you can get at times."
"Friends?" Malfoy snarls, pushing Harry up the wall right in the middle of the Ministry, his hands fastened on Harry's wrists to keep him in place. Hellfire dances in grey eyes, and Harry gulps at the proximity. "Friends?!" Malfoy repeats, incredulous. "Trust me, Potter. I've never seen you as a friend. When I said I like you, I meant it in a romantic way — in a... I want to hold your hand and kiss you and spoil you rotten and do things to your body that friends would never think of doing. I've wanted you, wanted this for so long you wouldn't believe-"
— enters his lair, stopping a few steps away from Draco.
", earning a shush from Harry.
"Fuck yes!" Harry howls and circles Draco's rim with a finger. "So tight for me-"
Minerva used sentences like "colourful, turbulent history, as I should know, having seen your fighting when you attended Hogwarts yourself, Professor Malfoy," and "grown out of such things," and "no longer a student now, but a very distinguished and competent member of our faculty," all the while peering at him over her spectacles, making him feel very much like a student.
"Mama!" Rose says.
They had their first dinner in Japan at Harry's favourite
Draco licks his lips. His heart is racing in his chest as he places his cushion away and slides closer to Harry.
"We can't stop, don't you understand?" he chokes out, peppering Harry's face with kisses so delicate and light that Harry wishes he could bottle each one up and lock it forever in his bejewelled box of a breaking heart. Each kiss is like an apology, and Malfoy's nails sink deeper into his skin, his craving for Harry trembling in his touch. "I can't stop, Harry."
Harry feels Bacon's sinuous body clench briefly around his arm, shoulder and upper back before he slides away, almost collapsing on the ground.
Enough.
“Shall we go to the park?” Draco suggests. Harry agrees. When Rose lets out a soft cry, Harry bends down to hush her, while Draco fishes about in the bag, retrieving a soft toy in the shape of a whale. He passes it to Harry, who places it into Rose’s hands. She gurgles in happiness and settles down, poking the whale with a pudgy finger and hugging it to her chest.
Malfoy lifts his shoulders in a casual, elegant shrug. "I like watching you paint. Like how you like to watch me sing," he says, drawing a chuckle from Harry. Malfoy cranes his neck, eyes flicking to the canvas. "Are you working on the High Line?"
of a cock.
At the sight of a stirring Potter, Pork Chop quickly uncoils from her basket at his bedside, revealing a medicated bandage around her healing mid-section. He hisses something in worry, his frown deepening at her bandage. She drapes her head and neck on his chest, as if taking solace in his heartbeat. As they talk, Potter looks at his healing injuries — burns, especially on his arms, and cuts and bruises inflicted by his fall. Draco's cushioning charm and Minerva's
Malfoy turns away, frowning. "So… you don't like chocolate anymore?"
The question lingers on the tip of Harry's tongue, but he can't keep putting his pride away. He finishes dressing and tucks his wand into his pocket, forcing a breezy tone, even though his heart is crumbling in his chest. "You know what, Malfoy? Maybe it's best that we end it here. The only thing you like about me is my dick, anyway. Besides, we're leaving school soon, so now's a good time, yeah?" He shrugs, looking away from Malfoy's hurt expression.
It's been two years.
“No,” he says, his voice hard and authoritative. He’s using his teacher voice on Harry, and that’s mad sexy. Malfoy leisurely unloops his tie from his collar, trailing the silky material over Harry’s throbbing cock, triggering an excited gasp from Harry. “You do not touch yourself when I’m with you.” He unbuttons his shirt, his demeanour calm, but the trembling of his fingers reveals his nervousness and eagerness.
flirting!" Harry hisses, stabbing his fork into his chicken. "I was... exchanging pleasantries, like what you were doing!"
These were treats that would fit perfectly in Mrs. Weasley's kitchen.
out in a mocking tone.
"That's it! Stop,
Draco blinks rapidly, his mind catching up with Potter's words.
Grey eyes gaze up at him intently as Malfoy hooks his ankles behind Harry’s back and lets his hands fall to the bed. Malfoy nudges the pillow under his hips, and they gasp at the slight change in angle. Harry exhales, his arms trembling with excitement and the effort of holding himself up.
“C’mon, Malfoy—
The Manor is like he remembers it.
And most distressingly, he heard a hush descend over the audience, before breaking out into excited chatters
“Have you been here before?” Malfoy asks.
"He's been saying things are piling up at home, and I suggested you. He considered it for a bit. Do you know his address?"
Hogwarts, where Malfoy is. The pieces of Harry’s broken heart are shouting at him to stop running, turn around and let Malfoy hold him. They could still salvage the situation, if Malfoy would only—
how much he wants to-
! There you go in your fancy Auror robes and your perfect life and perfect friends! No one spits at you when you walk down the streets, no one refuses you service when you're at a shop. You can get any job you want, but you've signed up for a life of catching criminals and locking them up, oh I'm
When Draco holds her and kisses the top of her head, whispering apology after heartfelt apology, she cries even harder. He offers a small smile to Blaise and Greg. Blaise nods at him, and then turns to Harry.
"Thank you," Malfoy murmurs, giving Harry a chaste kiss on the cheek and turning away. Harry can't help but feel disappointed — Malfoy doesn’t like cuddling, needing his space after sex (which is completely in line with his personality), unlike Harry, who loves snuggling after shagging. He likes holding someone cherished close to him, showing how much he means to Harry with his touch.
