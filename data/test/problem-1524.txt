“Seems that way,” Sam replied. “As if you’d been born a girl. You’d look like one, sound like one, even bleed like one. Got some puppies out of the crups three months back. Seem like normal puppies.”
“I just want to be able to look in a mirror without hating what I see,” Draco muttered.
She pinned him with her gaze for a moment longer. “He’s offering me a job at his shop,” she said. “I didn’t write to him. How does he know I’m looking for a job?”
It seemed to take him a very long time to answer. Eventually, he rolled over onto his side and gathered her up against him, pulling her into the curve of his body. “How many times do I have to tell you? Yes. I just want you to be happy.”
She hummed in agreement. She hoped he’d be up for using the engorgement charms again in the future. She’d liked it.
Harry rolled his eyes up to glance at the clock on Hermione and Ron’s living room wall. “Half six?” he suggested. “Is Indian okay? I don’t think we actually have any food in.”
Draco liked to complain about the silly mugs.
“You should be horrified at all this,” Draco insisted.
“No, you don’t,” Harry said softly. She heard the blankets rustle as he got up from his perch on the bed. His hands settled on her waist. “You look lovely.”
She rolled onto her back and stretched. “What do you mean?”
Draco was fast asleep again by the time Harry had changed into pyjamas and climbed in beside fully-clothed Draco. Within moments, Draco had curled against his side like a heat-seeking missile, pressing icy feet against Harry’s calf. Draco’s feet were always freezing. He muttered something. “Hmm?” Harry asked, not able to make it out.
“Do you think we should wake her?” Harry asked. “She looks… calmer.”
“So we can get you some you like better. If you want.” Harry’s light tone belied his fear; at any moment, he was waiting for Draco to confess that actually, those things had belonged to some witch he’d shagged, and that this was all a cover-up. But Harry was determined to call his bluff. If he had cheated, well then, Harry would go along with the cover story and see how far it went. See if Draco really would get done up in suspenders and a bra. And still Draco’s words last night niggled in his brain- had he really said that he wanted to be a girl, or had Harry misheard? Was it just nonsense sleep talk?
“I don’t think I understand,” Harry said. “What do you mean?”
She grinned back. “Do I look different? I sound different.”
“Yes.”
“Should we take her to St. Mungo’s?” Harry asked.
A few minutes later, he slammed two mugs of tea down in front of Harry and Draco, hot tea slopping over the sides and onto the coffee table. “It should be bloody illegal. They can’t dictate what people are!”
“Hmm?” Draco was deep in concentration as she ensured the perfect ratio of brown sauce to chips. “What healer?”
Harry drew patterns in the condensation that had gathered on the scarred pub table. “I gave him the chance. He could have come clean- maybe if he’d just come clean, we could work on it. But not this rubbish about liking women’s underwear.”
Draco nodded.
Dumbly, Draco nodded.
Draco stared into the swirling, moving depths of the potion Sam had provided, hypnotised. It looked innocuously small, barely bigger than one of her daily essence potions. “It’s what I want.”
“Yeah,” Draco said softly. She stared into space, her eyes fixed on the wardrobe but her vision somewhere else entirely. “But I can’t have them. There’s no way for me to carry them- I don’t have the right organs.”
Harry propped himself up on one elbow, watching her get up. “I think you should tell people,” he said.
“About work?” Draco asked. “I can’t work at the Ministry- I’m barred.” It had been a condition of her release. Harry had spoken at her trial, after the war, and it was his testimony that kept her out of Azkaban. Nevertheless, she could never work at the Ministry. The job at the Prophet had been well below her academic ability, but it was a job.
Draco grabbed his hand. “No,” she said. “Stay. Please.”
“Me?”
Draco tried again, a little louder. “It’s mine.” He swallowed hard. His head was swimming, making him dizzy. Reaching behind him, he grasped blindly for the chair and used it to support himself. He closed his eyes to try to shut out the swaying world around him. “I bought them. For me.”
“Yeah. We've already talked about that.” She looked up at Harry. “Will you still love me?”
“Yes. I ran around in a blind panic, not knowing how quickly to respond.”
Draco rolled to her side again, tucking her head onto Harry’s shoulder and breathing in the scent of him. “That it was a phase.”
Draco didn’t even seem to hear his warning. Her eyes were shining. She looked like she was about to cry, and Harry had no idea if they’d be tears of joy or rage. “I think we need some time to talk about it,” he told Sam quickly. “Can we get back to you?”
Neither Ron nor Hermione missed the pronouns. Ron went pale and dropped his fork. Hermione took a delicate bite of korma, her eyes fixed on Draco. Neither said anything. “Draco?” Harry prompted.
“Just because some of us actually have table manners,” Draco muttered darkly as she pushed some curry around her plate with a piece of naan.
Harry had left the pile of underthings in a heap on the floor. Suddenly, Draco hated them. He snatched up the lacy knickers and garter belt, the tiny, barely-there bra that sagged against his flat chest and the soft silk of the stockings. Only yesterday, he’d sat touching them, enjoying the feel of the silk and lace under his fingers. He’d been considering putting them on when Harry had come home early from a case. Flustered, Draco had shoved them under the bed instead of putting them away under a concealment charm behind the books in his bedside table. Stupid.
“Wouldn’t you rather work for George?” Harry wheedled.
“I shouldn’t…”
“But I’d be female, all over,” Draco pressed. “Inside too?”
She finally put the bacon in her mouth. Only when she’d carefully chewed and swallowed it did she answer. “No. Shop work?” She shuddered. “It’s beneath me.”
Draco charmed the bag so the name of the shop didn’t show as they wandered Camden Market. They’d always liked it here- Harry had thought it was because they certainly weren’t the only gay couple there, but now he wondered if Draco had liked seeing people who might have been male, but might have been female too. You got all kinds of people in Camden Market.
“Oh,” Harry looked disappointed, and Draco loved him for trying. “I’d hoped- you’re supposed to be the best.”
“I want to be here when she wakes up.”
Silence stretched on for long moments. Draco wondered if Harry was waiting for him to say more, but somehow, he couldn’t bring himself to. He waited for Harry to tell him to pack his things and go. Harry struggled to get his thoughts in order. Eventually, he asked, “Since when?”
Draco gasped like a fish out of water. His heart pounded in his ears. “It’s not like that!” he wheezed. “I never… I would never cheat on you!”
“Yes,” Harry muttered. The reply might have been facetious, but he’d been deep in thought about work. With Hermione due to have her baby in a matter of days, he and Ron had been temporarily relegated to desk duty to make sure Ron wasn’t out in the field when she went into labour. Desk duty made Harry itchy. He hated shuffling paper. He always thought he’d forget something.
“Ron,” Hermione called over her shoulder, “do you want to go to Harry’s for tea?”
She considered the question. “Really odd,” she said. “Everything feels weird.” All her bones felt like they’d been ground down to dust and glued back together again. Every muscle and ligament ached as if she’d run a marathon the day before. Her guts felt tied into beautiful sailor’s knots. She winced a little as she brought her hand up, cupping it against her much-expanded chest.
Healer Jack (“Oh, no, first name terms! None of that stuffy ‘Healer Jenkins’ nonsense.”) listened as Draco haltingly explained her predicament. He asked questions, so many questions, and Draco forced herself to answer them even when they seemed irrelevant. How long had she felt like she was a woman? What was her childhood like? How did she feel about the war? Did she have women’s clothes? Did she ever wear them? Just inside the flat, or outside too? What about her name- was that the same name she’d always had?
“He’s mad,” Draco said firmly. “Completely and utterly mad. I hadn’t realised.”
“I know,” Jack soothed. “But it’s hurting you too much.”
An owl tapped against the windowpane “Fried, please,” Harry said as he went to let the bird in. It took wing again as soon as it had taken the owl treat from his hand. “Here,” he said, holding the folded parchment out to Draco. “It’s for you.”
“Well, maybe it’s just an act.” Harry knew he sounded sullen. “Maybe it was all an act.” He drained the rest of his pint. “God, I don’t think I could stand the sight of him at the moment. Could I kip at yours tonight?”
Her face had filled out, fleshing over her cheekbones a little, but she still had a knifeblade of a nose. Her jaw was still ‘strong’ rather than ‘delicate’. Her adam’s apple still bobbed in her throat when she swallowed. She met Harry’s eyes in the mirror. “No more boy in a dress,” she said, her voice cracking. She winced and took the potion, gulping it down without hesitation.
“What’s fame for, if not for making people bend the rules?” Harry asked.
“Maybe it takes a while,” Harry said.
Draco flinched.
“No!” she snapped.
“Okay, that’s what I thought.” Ron frowned. “Merlin’s balls, that’s bloody mental.” He took another shovelling mouthful of curry, deep in thought as he masticated. “Does that mean you’ve got a cock or a pussy?”
“I did. I told you.”
“Draco?” Harry murmured, shaking her shoulder. “Draco, love. How’re you feeling?”
“How do you know it’s rubbish?” Hermione pressed. “Has he ever done anything else to make you think he might be cheating on you? He’s devoted, Harry, anyone can see that.”
“Even though it’s not what you fell in love with?”
Hermione let out a sigh. “Honestly, Harry, how do you two actually function? We’ll see you at half six. And we’ll bring the food. You always get the spicy stuff, and the baby’s not keen.”
“You’re already transitioning, though,” Harry said. “Why go for something so untested when you’re getting there anyway?”
“No… talk now,” Draco mumbled, his eyes sliding shut again. His head slumped forward. “Just… need to wake up…”
“Why did you have them, then?” Harry asked. “You like to wear women’s underwear?”
Ron scoffed. “‘Course not. But that’s different. He’s Harry. And he’s not gay, strictly speaking. He likes witches too.”
“Just… do you? I’m curious.”
“I want to do it. The chromosome thing.”
Draco stood in front of the mirror, stark naked. She turned this way and that, appraising her reflection. “Do you think my breasts have grown?” she asked Harry.
Light streamed into the bedroom, bathing the woman lying across it in warm spring sunshine. Harry looked appreciatively at Draco’s new body. The silk dressing gown she wore hid most of it, but the curve of her breasts and hips were obvious anyway. Propped up on one elbow, she smiled at him. “Like what you see?” she asked, a hint of the coquette in her tone.
“No, Harry. Sorry. I wish I could tell you otherwise, but no. There’s no potion nor spell that can do what you ask and give someone reproductive organs. If it was, the infertile witches would be queuing ‘round the block for it.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, smiling through his distraction. “I’m going to stay up a bit longer if that’s okay?”
If someone had told him he’d share the flat, and a bed, with none other than Harry Potter, he’d probably have cried, because one of his most closely guarded secrets would have come out. He was in love with Harry Potter, and probably had been since Harry had refused to shake his hand, way back in first year.
“But things might change, right? Maybe in a year or two, there might be new breakthroughs?”
“A risk of blood clots,” Draco said quietly. “Possible drop in libido. And...” she trailed off.
“Alright, love.” Herry moved one of his hands to cradle the back of Draco’s head and brushed a kiss across her lips. “If I get it wrong, if I get anything wrong, please tell me? Thwack me over the head or something. I wish you could have told me years ago. I’m sorry for not knowing.”
The wizard who entered the nondescript meeting room was short and mousy, nondescript in himself as the room was. A classic Unspeakable, Harry thought. Couldn’t pick him out of a crowd. He nodded to Harry and then to Draco before turning his wand into each corner of the room, flicking shielding and privacy spells into every nook and cranny. Only then did he turn back to them. “Potter. Malfoy. I’m Sam. Granger told you what I’m working on?”
“Would you call Harry feminine?”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Harry asked.
“Well, I’m honoured for the accolade.”
Ron called back something incomprehensible. “I think that was a yes,” Hermione said. “What time.”
Ron found them on the sofa when he flooed in. “Oh!” he said. “Sorry. Just coming to check you were okay, Harry. I’ve put in the incident report.” He peered down at Draco, tear-stained and puffy-eyed. “Erm…” he said hesitantly. “Um, what’s wrong?”
Draco thought about it for a moment. “I don’t know,” she said eventually, grinning wolfishly. “I think I’ll need more experience to make a decision.”
“You were right,” he admitted. “Draco wasn’t cheating.”
Draco had tipped his head back to look at the uninspiring white ceiling. “Knickers don’t fit right when you have a penis,” he said, his voice quiet. “Bras don’t fit right when you don’t have breasts to put in them.”
“Bed,” Harry said firmly. He had no idea what came over him, but he bent to scoop up Draco, blanket and all, and carried him through to the bedroom. He wouldn’t have been able to lift Draco before Auror training, but he’d done enough weight training now that carrying an extra person was no big deal. Draco clung to his neck, burying his head into Harry’s shoulder.
“You sound like you’ve been screaming,” Harry told her from his perch on the end of the bed. “You did scream a bit.” She spared him a sympathetic glance. He was pale, with dark shadows under his eyes. His hair clumped as if it had been soaked in sweat.
Harry shook his head. “Just kept thinking,” he said. “God, Hermione, I love him. I thought he loved me. How could he do this to me? Couldn’t he have done me the credit of telling me, not going behind my back?”
He’d become used to the softening of her body over the last few months. The hard planes of the Draco he thought he’d known had slowly melted away into the slight give of the body she wanted to have, her chest rounding slightly and her hips filling. The softer places were more now, though her ribs seemed too protrudent, her spine too knobbly. “It feels like she’s thinner,” he told Jack. “Like, really badly thin.” Like Harry-in-the-cupboard-under-the-stairs thin, but he kept that thought to himself
Harry slid the eggs onto the plates.
Sam held out his hands, showing he was unarmed. “Sorry,” Harry murmured, putting his wand on the table in front of him. “Professional reflex.” Even if Sam didn’t know him, or of him, he was wearing his Auror robes.
“I tried to tell her once,” Draco said. “I was little- maybe twelve? Pansy had just had her first monthly. God, I was jealous. She got to have the pretty clothes, then she got to be this amazing fertile being. She could make life. All I made was trouble.”
Ten minutes later, Draco rolled onto her back. “Are you asleep?”
“Yup,” Jack agreed. “You’ve done your homework. Has Harry?”
The soft cups sat empty on her chest, the fabric tenting up over her nipples. She squinted down at her chest and promptly shut her eyes again. “It looks stupid.”
“But you used to not mind so much?”
Harry went through to the kitchen as soon as he got in, shedding his robes on the sofa and his shirt on the kitchen threshold. He’d pulled down the box of healing supplies he kept in the top cupboard before he realised Draco was home and following him. “You’re hurt!” she said, spotting the clumsily applied dressing on his arm.
“Ah,” Xenophilius said, looking just a little lost. “Ah.” He looked at Draco again, his face lighting up. “Yes. Of course! I hear you’ve been let go from the
Draco broke the seal and read it as Harry cracked two eggs into the pan. “It’s from George Weasley,” she said in surprise. She glared at Harry over the top of the parchment. “What did you say?”
Harry just smirked, raising Draco’s hand to kiss it. “Aurors are never really off duty,” he reminded Draco. “After we’ve eaten, we should go shopping.”
.” Her skin felt tight, stretched. He repeated the spell again on the other side.
“In appearance?” Draco asked.
Hermione pursed her lips. “I think you should hear him out, Harry. You’ve been together, what, nearly three years- don’t you think you owe him the chance to explain?”
With quick movements, Harry scooped the bacon out of the pan and into two sandwiches. The plates clattered as he set them on the table; Draco had barely moved. “Sit down,” Harry said, his voice sounding gruff in his own ears.
“Yeah. Go back to sleep.”
Harry hissed as the air hit the angry red slash on his forearm. “He did. No point bothering the healers. They can’t do anything. Not the first time I’ve had a cursed would, love. It’s not even that big. It’ll be gone in a day or two.” He used his uninjured hand to gather up the cleansing potion, uncorking it with his teeth and slopping it over his arm. The potion hissed and bubbled, burning away germs and impurities.
Draco was still frozen in place. “You… want to buy more?”
“Yeah.”
“Yeah. Look- do you and Ron want to come for tea?” he asked.
“We, er, sort of got rid of the spare bed, mate,” Ron said. “Had to make room for the cot and the other baby stuff.”
He pulled out a seat at the kitchen table, watching Hermione as she added sugar and cocoa to the milk. She had to reach over her round belly to stir. She seemed to sense his eyes on her. “This baby likes to turn somersaults in the middle of the night,” she said. “Ron says it’s going to be a seeker, but I think it’s more likely a beater if the punches and kicks are anything to go by. Possibly a boxer, to be honest. A warm drink tends to put them to sleep.” She reached up to pull two mismatched mugs from the cupboard, carefully pouring the hot chocolate.
“You… don’t think they should have fired me?” Draco asked cautiously.
Jack picked up her wrist and took her pulse. “Her heart’s going fit to bust.”
“Not really,” she admitted. “How do you want your egg?”
Draco grumbled incoherently. “I think we should let her sleep a little longer,” Jack whispered. “She should wake naturally without the spell keeping her under. You should go and have your breakfast.”
“Cheating, of course!” Harry didn’t think that needed asking.
“I saw Luna last week,” Harry said, snatching back his hand from Xenophilius’s clammy grip. He wondered how on earth Xenophilius had their floo address. “What can we do for you?”
“Yeah,” he said. “They have. Come to bed, love.”
his brain chanted at him.
. “‘We cannot allow our employees to represent us by dressing for pantomime.’”
“They shouldn’t. Not when they know.” Harry rubbed his face, then glanced around at the empty corridor, making sure no-one was around to witness their conversation. “You need a different healer,” he said flatly. “You need one that has some respect for you.”
“They’re alive?” Harry asked. “None of them died, or got any extra limbs or anything?”
! She’d always avoided using that term in her head, forcibly turning her internal monologue to male pronouns, male terms. She’d always been far too afraid that she’d slip up, somehow out herself.
“Is that okay?” Harry asked, barely above a whisper.
“So, what did the healer say?” Harry wanted to know.
“Harry…” Draco panted, struggling to keep up with Harry’s strides as he hurried down the corridor. “Harry, shouldn’t we-”
, Draco.” Harry didn’t doubt Draco anymore. There was no way anyone would go to these lengths to cover up an infidelity, and if nothing else, Draco’s utter despondence confirmed it. “I wish you could have told me.” He sighed. “I suppose that’s why you don’t like me looking at you?”
Harry snorted. “Thanks, Ron.”
“What did you say?” Harry asked, sure he’d misheard. But Draco was asleep again, his arms locked around Harry’s own arm.
A niggle in her mind told her that this couldn’t actually be real. At any moment, Harry would announce his disgust and go, her brain told her.
“He said it would start quickly!” Draco whined. She huffed as she looked into the mirror.
“What?” Harry asked, his voice hard and clipped. “I can’t hear you.”
Xenophilius waved the concern away. “Luna wants you. Good enough for me.”
“Will anything be developed?” Harry pressed. “New spells and potions get made all the time. Why not something for this?”
“Do you want to see?” she asked, her fingers fretting at the knot in the dressing gown’s tie. He knocked her shaking hands aside to disentangle it, but did not pull the fabric apart. That was for her to do, he decided.
She turned in his arms, bowing her head to rest it on his shoulder. “Oh, fine,” she said. “Just to make you happy.”
“I don’t know, Draco. I never considered measuring them. Come to bed.”
They found Draco at the kitchen table, sheaves of parchment in piles around her as she put together the next edition of the Quibbler. Somehow, in just a few issues, Harry could see a change creeping into the publication. The crumple-horned snorkack sightings had been pushed to the back pages to make way for an exposé on Gringotts being used to facilitate Muggle money laundering. Hermione dropped into a dining chair like a stone. “Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” she demanded. “I’ve been in the testing labs all afternoon. I’m parched.”
Harry considered Hermione’s words. Yes, he had to admit that he wouldn’t have been utterly surprised, or, to be honest, utterly against the idea, if Draco had told him that he liked to wear pretty, lacey women’s underthings.
Harry took the potion bottle from Draco so he could grip her hands. “They fired you because you’re changing your sex?”
Harry sighed. “Go to bed, Draco. We can talk tomorrow.”
Harry clutched Draco’s tense body a fraction closer as she whimpered in her sleep. “Well, that’s something.”
Draco didn’t seem to be paying attention. “If he’s mad,” she mused, “he might not mind about me being female. Maybe he wouldn’t even notice. It’s perfect.” She let her fork clatter onto her plate as she sprang up again, rushing to the roll-top desk in the corner of the living room. “I’ll ask him the terms.” She paused, a roll of parchment in her hand, and finally looked back at Harry. “Or am I being too eager?” she asked. “Should I make him wait a bit, so I don’t seem desperate?”
Harry felt his cheeks heat as he remembered. That had been the first function they’d attended as a couple, and they’d spent a happy half-hour in the storeroom behind the curtains. They could hear the chatter from the ballroom even as Harry had emptied himself into Draco’s delicious arse. He’d stumbled through his speech, half-hard again just thinking of his come still inside Draco. Luckily, he wasn’t known as much of a public speaker anyway, so he didn’t think anyone really noticed the difference
She barely slept on Tuesday night. Tomorrow, Jack was coming back with her potions. By the time Harry pulled himself from bed on Wednesday morning, she’d cleaned the living room and kitchen (twice), and was making him a full English.
Draco couldn’t move; couldn’t speak. He gripped the back of the chair to keep from falling as his heartbeat pounded in his ears.
“You’re a man who wants to be a woman?” Sam confirmed, squinting at Draco, long-haired and wearing a pink blouse.
Her eyes glittered. “Editor, Harry!”
She gestured at the empty cups of the bra, her face twisting. “What’s the point?” she asked. “I don’t have anything to put in this.”
The healer’s mouth tightened like she was sucking on lemons. “Unlikely. In any case, that’s a conversation for a long time in the future. If Mr Malfoy can manage to live as a woman- and that’s an if, not a when- we can discuss the next steps.”
She stared at the face staring back at her from the mirror- utterly familiar, and yet, somehow utterly not. It was a bit like looking at a much younger Draco, she thought, but all wrong. Round, pink cheeks, a delicate nose and a narrow pointed chin marked out the highlights of her face, though she could see that she did look too thin. Her mouth was a little fuller, she thought, but her eyes were the same. Her hair was a birds-nest mess. Jack cleared his throat. “If I were you at the moment,” he said, “I’d be wanting to use that mirror to take a quick look at other bits of myself.” He stood. “Private bits.” Clearing his throat again, he gave Harry a pointed look.
Draco didn’t seem ready to answer. “Draco, love, can I tell him?”
Draco tried to shake his head, but Harry’s grip was too strong. Tears were threatening at the edges of his eyes again. “No,” he whispered. “I’d never… I only want…”
Draco sat.
Draco’s movements were uncoordinated and sleepy as she pressed herself back up to a sitting position. She slumped bonelessly against Harry’s side. “So?” she asked. “Am I mad?”
“For what, clothing a house elf?”
“That’s a bit rubbish,” Harry said, looking up to see Draco’s sad eyes. “Why do we even have magic if we can’t use it for stuff like that? If we can have polyjuice, why can’t we have something that makes you look exactly how you want?”
It was only when Draco was carefully winding a bandage around Harry’s arm that Harry glanced at the clock and realised that it was far earlier than Draco would usually be home. “Why aren’t you at work?” he asked.
Hermione nodded. “Yeah. They’ve changed the sex of a mouse. Well, several mice. And they’re looking for human trials.”
“I wanted you as
“Just because he cares about his hair doesn’t mean he’s not a bloke,” Harry riposted. “He’s definitely a bloke, Hermione. I’ve seen the bits to prove it.”
“It wasn’t always like this- sex in the dark with the curtains shut. We used to get it on anywhere, anytime. Sex with the curtains open. Sex in the shower. Sex in the storeroom at the Ministry. But then, you stopped wanting to. Why?”
“Sit down and eat something,” Harry said, pointedly looking at Draco’s plate of food, cut up into little pieces, but not actually any less than it had been. “Yes, I’ve met him before. He’s crackers.”
“They’re your friends,” Draco mumbled in the general direction of her plate. “Why don’t you tell them?”
“We can transfigure the sofa if you want, though,” Hermione offered. “You’re always welcome, Harry- anytime. Just because we’re having a baby doesn’t mean we’ll ever not have time for you.” She reached across the table to put her hand over Harry’s. “But I really think you need to sit down and have a proper talk with Draco tomorrow, when you’ve had a chance to calm down and think things through.”
“Nope, not even Harry,” the healer said. “Just us.”
“Let me just get my robes,” Ron said, already trying to shove his right arm in the left armhole.
She didn’t have the heart to deny him. “Fine,” she teased, rolling her eyes again. “You can wear a skirt the colour of my eyes if you insist.”
“Never mind?” Draco arched an eyebrow, but her voice trembled. “I should never have told them. I should have just carried on as I was!” She tried to stay calm, tried to control her emotions like she saw Harry do so often, but she couldn’t. For the third time that day, she broke down in tears.
“Fame’s gone to your head,” Draco grumbled, sitting up. “Eurgh. I need to shower.”
“More,” she said, reaching for his hand to bring it back to her breast. “Just… gentle. It’s sensitive.”
“Oh, love,” Harry sighed. He shuffled along the bed until he was behind Draco, pulling him back against his chest and kissing his temple. Draco sagged back against him as if all his bones had been vanished. Then the tears came, great wracking sobs that eventually gave way to hiccoughing little cries. Harry pulled Draco into his lap and rocked, shushing with nonsense noises. He kissed Draco’s head again and again, smoothed the wet blonde hair away from Draco’s scarlet face as he sopped up the tears with the edge of a blanket.
“Me?” Harry asked, pointing the chewed feather-end of his quill at himself.
Harry interrupted. “Shouldn’t the potions come first?” he wanted to know. “Wouldn’t it be easier to live as a woman if you look like one?”
Harry gave up on breakfast. “Where are the… the things?” he asked, not really sure what to call the underwear.
Draco nodded sharply, her cheeks stained pink. Harry spoke for her. “Yeah,” he said. “I think that’s a good idea.” Maybe they could figure something out. He hadn’t thought of a surrogate. Maybe they could have one kid with Draco’s sperm, and one with his. Maybe there was some way to mix them up, magically.
“I know. I was there.” They’d discussed it for hours. They’d even met the crup puppies. They were going to adopt one, just as soon as they were old enough to be separated from their mother.
“My new toy?”
“Yeah. If it makes you happy, then yeah. I don’t care what you wear, Draco. If you want to wear a spacesuit, I don’t mind. You can wear whatever you like.”
“It took you three days to owl back!”
“We can buy more,” Harry repeated patiently. “From wherever you got them. It’s Saturday: maybe we could go out into muggle London. No one would know us there, so we can buy what we like.”
Draco nodded.
“No, I’ll be fine,” she muttered distractedly, reading George’s letter again. “Go to work. He said he wanted to talk to me alone anyway.”
Draco finished off the bandage with a spell to weave the ends together. “I got fired,” she said quietly.
“You’re no fun,” Harry grumbled, his tone good natured. “I want to buy you something. Something you’ll like.”
The bed transfigured from Ron and Hermione’s sofa was comfortable. It really was. He couldn’t blame a bad mattress or not enough blankets for his sudden insomnia. He got up when he heard someone in the kitchen. Ron’s borrowed pyjamas pooled around his feet as he walked- he hadn’t bothered to transfigure them into his own size.
Jack laughed. “No, Draco. Not mad at all. I can see that this ain’t just some passing fancy, too.” He fiddled idly with his wand, drumming it off his knee. “I’ll need to get a few calculations done- I’ll need your weight and height and so forth. I’ll need a blood sample- and I’ll need to see you at least every month to begin with to check that the dosages are right, but I reckon I could have a supply of essence potions with you by next week.”
Draco cringed in on himself, waiting for the inevitable explosion. “I want to be a woman. I don’t just want to wear the clothes- I want to actually be a woman.”
But then, there were other considerations. Over the last year or so, Draco hadn’t wanted to make love with the lights on. Harry had given up trying. Shower sex hadn’t happened in a good while, even though they’d done it almost every day when they first moved in together. Harry had thought that maybe it was just them getting over the new relationship honeymoon phase. Maybe it was something else. Oh God, just how long had Draco been sleeping with someone else before Harry had noticed? Or was there something changed in Draco himself?
Draco flushed a delicate pink, making Harry smile. He reached across the table to brush her cheek. “I love it when you blush,” he said, his voice slightly hoarse.
“Here. This one,” Harry said. She turned back towards him to find him holding up a silvery-grey skirt in some sort of silky, flowing fabric. “It matches your eyes,” Harry said, and Draco thought she could detect just a hint of shyness in his voice.
“I didn’t say anything to him,” Harry insisted. “Maybe it was Ron?”
Draco struggled against the blanket Harry had just tucked around him, clumsily sitting up. “No. Harry. I’m sorry.” His voice was heavy and slow with sleep. “I should have told you. I’m sorry. I understand if you want to...”
“Yeah, but, ‘Mione, he’s gay. He’s hardly going to be manly.”
She was jolted out of her reverie when Harry tugged on her hand. “What do you think?” he asked, and she realised he’d pulled her over to a stall. He was holding out a gaudy pink and turquoise peasant skirt.
Draco fiddled with a loose thread on Harry’s sleeve. “Maybe. I thought you thought I was weird for this. You don’t even like me much.”
“Yeah,” Draco said from the depths of Harry’s shirt.
Draco trailed him as he went back to the kitchen for more tea. “I’ve never actually spoken to him before,” she said. “I thought it was an act to sell his silly paper.”
Healer Bewick stood too. She held out her hand. “Of course. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy…” Harry ignored her outstretched hand, all but pulling Draco from the room.
Draco shrugged his hunched shoulders. “Thought you wouldn’t like it,” he muttered. “It doesn’t matter. They’re gone now.”
“By what?” Harry wanted to know.
He took her hand to press it against the very solid lump in his trousers. “Yes,” he told her. “I’m hoping you might be kind and share your new toy with me.”
Draco always did prefer to be the receiving partner, Harry mused. He loved his long hair, his colourful, blousy shirts. The flowers he always bought for the kitchen windowsill… that hideous pink crup teddy that sat on his bedside table- Harry had won that for him when they went to the funfair. But that was just Draco, wasn’t it? Harry loved him for it, no matter how much he rolled his eyes when it took Draco forever to get ready to go out. And so what if Draco used hair removal potions to take away every last body hair, even though they were so pale you couldn’t see them except in the brightest sunlight? Harry had found that a bit odd at first, but now he’d just come to love it as one of Draco’s quirks. So what if Draco did like some things that might be stereotypically feminine? That was just Draco. He’d have told Harry if he was into women’s clothes, wouldn’t he. Wouldn’t he?
“I talk about everything with Jane. You know that.”
Stubbornly, Harry shook his head. Jack sighed and folded himself into the chair he’d transfigured by the bed to wait it out.
“Of course,” Harry said. “But we can adopt. You know that. You don’t need to go through with this just because of children, or some societal expectation.”
Harry and Draco both looked in surprise at the bearded man sitting in their living room. He grinned. “Didn’t expect that, did ya?” he asked. “I’ve been taking essence potions for, oh, nearly twenty years- I was a bit younger than Draco when I got my mitts on them.” His tone turned more serious. “There’s some surgeries we can do, to make an approximation of a vulva and vagina if you want it, Draco. No need to decide yet- there’s no expiry date on that offer, and maybe best to take it a bit slow, yeah?”
“Harry!” Draco protested, glancing around. “We’re in public!”
“Then get on with it,” Draco’s gasp drew out into a long moan as Harry cupped his hand over a breast. Clumsily, she reached for her wand to close the curtains, plunging them into murky twilight.
“Of course,” Harry said. “I don’t care what you look like, Draco. I care about you.”
Harry tipped her face up, pulling her out of her hunch and brushed a kiss over her lips. She opened her eyes as he pulled away, letting herself get lost in the greenness of his gaze instead of thinking about her body, with all the wrong parts in all the wrong places. “May I try something?” he asked.
Overcome by an unexpected moment of tenderness, Harry pulled one of the blankets Molly Weasley had knitted for him from over the back of the sofa and tucked it around Draco’s sleeping form. Draco started. “Harry?” he muttered sleepily.
She faced away from the full length mirror as she stripped out of her clothes, shedding trousers and shirt and boxers and socks in a pile. When she reached for them, the silk of the knickers felt almost illicit beneath her fingertips. She was shaking as she pulled them on, trying not to fall over as she hooked them round one large foot, then another. She closed her eyes so she wouldn’t have to see her big, male body against the delicate scrap of clothing, and so she wouldn’t have to see Harry, watching her. She could still feel his eyes on her.
“Couldn’t sleep?” Hermione asked with a kind smile.
“It’s not right,” Harry muttered. “We have magic, we should be able to do this stuff. If we just tried harder...”
“Sure. I don’t see much point in waiting about for you to get used to being called a woman first; your mind’s pretty clear. Now, it’s still not a quick process,” Jack warned. “It’s not an overnight thing. Might be a year or two before you’re happy with what you look like, and there are some things we can’t ever change- you’re always going to be tall- but it’s a start.”
“Hmm?”
Harry didn’t want to give Draco time to change her mind. Whilst she was in the shower, Harry flooed Ron and Hermione. Hermione answered, kneeling awkwardly in front of the fireplace that currently housed Harry’s head. “Harry!” she cried. “How are you? What happened with Draco?”
“-wanna be a girl,” Draco repeated.
After they’d eaten, Harry persuaded Draco to go shopping, though she insisted on apparating out to Camden to make sure they wouldn’t run into anyone they knew. Draco refused to try anything on, but blushing, picked out another set of underwear like the one she’d burnt. Harry bought it, and three more in different colours. “You look amazing in blue,” he said to quiet Draco’s protestations. He snuck in a pair of pale pink socks with crup puppies gambolling about on them at the till. He thought Draco might think they were funny.
“I tried really hard to hide it,” Draco whispered.
“Oh, I suspect I’ll be discussing it at length with Jane,” Harry said mildly. “But I’m not horrified.” Draco tried not to feel discomforted at that- she should have expected it. Jane was Harry’s counsellor- it might have taken two years after the War for Hermione to cajole him into talking to a professional instead of trying to find solace in a firewhiskey bottle, but now he wouldn’t give up his sessions with her for anything. They’d gone from weekly to fortnightly to monthly in the intervening years, but his therapy afternoon was block-booked in his calendar at work. If there was ever a time Auror Potter was truly off duty, it was when he was in Jane’s cosy office. “Look,” Harry said. “I think you should make another appointment with the healer. I’d like to come with you, if I can. Maybe things have changed in the last few years- maybe there are better potions now.”
“I don’t know!”
Harry wheeled to face Draco, taking her by the shoulders. “She shouldn’t have called you Mr,” Harry told her. “That’s not right.”
“Not the ones where we only messed with chromosome 23,” Sam said. “The other ones… well.” He spread his fingers, his meaning clear.
Draco’s breath caught in her throat. “They can have babies? I could have babies?”
“That’s rubbish, mate.” Ron was Harry’s field partner with the Aurors when they were on-duty and best friend in perpetuity. He pushed a new pint towards Harry.
“Are you talking about him sleeping with someone else, or wearing women’s things?”
“Only because you spelled them!” Draco snorted out a choked laugh. “Doesn’t that sort of behaviour get you in trouble when you’re off-duty, Auror Potter?”
Harry had very little chance to ask questions or complain at the high-handed treatment as he was practically frog-marched to the floo by a very pregnant Hermione, who still waddled the corridors of the Ministry at a surprising speed. People scrambled out of the way before her impressive prow.
“But what are the effects?” Draco wanted to know.
Holding up the bag hanging from her wrist, Draco arched an eyebrow. “You already have.”
His thumb was gentle as he brushed it against the flesh at the top edge of the cup, but she gasped anyway, the contact sending little shockwaves into her. He pulled away.
The muggles didn’t notice the subtle notice-me-not spell Harry cast, nor the
Harry kissed her nose, then turned off the lights. “Patience, love.”
“Yes,” Harry said with a glance at Draco. Draco looked calm, so Harry figured she’d known this before. If she was fine with it, he was fine with it, he decided.
“What about the other ones?” Draco asked, gesturing to the twenty-two other squiggles. “What do they do?”
His thoughts were interrupted by Hermione. “Would you really mind if he was into it?” she asked. “I mean, it’s fine if it is a big deal to you, but is it a big enough deal to end the relationship?”
“You okay with that, Draco?” Jack asked.
“And he just expects me to believe that he likes wearing women’s underwear!” Harry complained, staring into the dregs of his pint. “Like that’s more likely than him having a witch in our bed!”
“It was more like groaning,” Jack told her. He reached over to the top of the chest of drawers and handed her a small mirror. “See for yourself.”
“Please.”
“Yes, you. Are you done for the day? Good. Then we can go back to yours.”
Harry brandished the pile of lacy underwear. “Oh? Really? Then what on earth is this?” he asked. His tone was calm, even, but Draco could hear the barely-controlled anger just beneath it. Harry had tried so hard to manage his anger over the last few years.
“Please,” he murmured into her hair.
“It’s a multi-stage process,” Healer Bewick told them, her flinty eyes fixed on Draco. “It’s not something to be taken lightly. First, you have to prove that you can live as your preferred gender. You should wear female clothes, go by a female name. Your family and friends must accept you as female. If, after a year dressing and acting as a woman, you still want to continue, then we will provide you with potions that will suppress your male hormones and mimic female ones. At that point, you’d start to see changes in your body- you won’t grow facial hair, there will be a redistribution of fat into breasts and hips. Your voice might lighten a little.”
Ron bounced up from his desk as Hermione waddled into the Auror’s office. “‘Mione! he gasped. Questions tumbled from his lips. “Is everything okay? Why are you here? Do we need to go to St. Mungo’s? Is it time? You should have sent someone to fetch me! Here, let me get a chair…”
Jack put his wand to her temple and muttered a spell for sleep. Harry expected her to relax, but she didn’t. “Didn’t it work?” he asked.
“Not you. Just Harry,” Hermione sighed, rolling her eyes ceilingward. “You can go home and start the tea. I’m starving. Come on, Harry.”
“Me,” Draco said at the same moment Harry said, “She does.”
“Next week?” Draco squeaked, unable to contain her excitement. Harry felt a broad grin plaster across his own face. He squeezed Draco’s hand tight. She’d have what she wanted.
“They aren’t paying attention,” Harry said. “We’re just that couple that comes in every few weeks. We’re not interesting any more.”
“Do you want me to set up a meeting?”
She dipped her head, but couldn’t hide her smile. “I don’t deserve you.”
“I know,” Harry told her. He curled protectively around her, a parenthesis around her body. His sponge left a damp patch on the sheets.
She poked at her testicles. “And these… are they a bit smaller?”
“You’re sure this is really what you want?” Harry asked. “Because there’s no going back.”
Jack smiled at them. “Good plan. There are a few other possible side effects, but you’re healthy. I’m not expecting anything untoward. I’ve got a full list, I’ll leave it with you. Now, Draco, you’ve got a supportive partner, and that’s really important, but no one else knows yet, right?”
“Draco’s fine,” Draco said, glancing up at Hermione, and apparently liking what she saw in her face.
A couple of days later, Draco and Harry waited in one of the Ministry meeting rooms on the atrium level. Visitors couldn’t go into the Department of Mysteries, and even with the weight of Harry’s Auror clearance, he suspected that they were nervous about having Draco in the Ministry at all, let alone poking around whatever the Unspeakables did.
“But I don’t have the money for it! The Malfoy fortune was seized!”
When Draco got in from work, he found Harry sitting in the living room, idly staring into the fire. “Hi,” Draco said, hanging his cloak on the hook in the hall. If, eight years ago, someone had told seventeen-year-old Draco that he’d be living in a smallish flat on one of the courtyards off Diagon Alley, he’d have laughed. Back then, he’d thought that the future held either glory at the Dark Lord’s side or a cell in Azkaban. Not a job as a clerk at the
Some time later, both of them content and replete, Draco lay in Harry’s arms as he traced lazy patterns across her side. She swatted his hand away as he ventured too far onto her ribs and tickled. “That was amazing,” Harry mumbled into her hair.
Draco just gripped her knees tighter to her chest and sobbed as the cramps wracked through her body. Through clenched teeth she eventually muttered an “okay.”
“Well, what about this one?” Harry persisted, swapping it for one in black with huge white flowers.
Harry reached over the table to grip Draco’s chin firmly in his hand. He forced Draco to look at him, his eyes searching his boyfriend’s. “Did you sleep with someone else?” he asked roughly.
“Hey!” Harry scrambled to his feet, pulling her into his chest. Her skin was cool and smooth against him. “Stop that! You’re not broken. And Ron won’t be nasty.”
“I suppose it crept up on me. And, well, then I kept getting reminded that I was a man.”
“Maybe,” Draco said, but she didn’t sound convinced.
She gave Harry the Mini Egg mug. Harry had the same mug at home- he and Hermione had made it a running tradition to give each other muggle easter eggs with novelty mugs since they’d left Hogwarts.  She had the Smarties mug; the first one he’d bought her.
Harry shrugged a shoulder. “That’s okay. But they’d be okay with it too. I’d better go and clean up the breakfast dishes before Hermione declares us both slobs and says we can’t be trusted not to poison ourselves.”
“It worked,” Jack said grimly. “She’s still in pain, just doesn’t know about it.”
“Yes.”
Draco arched an eyebrow. “It’s hideous,” she said.
“You scared?” Jack asked.
“They can’t make me forget it, not without serious brain damage. And changing… it takes a long time. Years. Lots of potions. And when you invited me out for dinner… then when we came back here, and went to bed… I thought having you was more important. I thought having you would be enough to make it not matter.”
“Huh?” Harry asked.
That woke Harry up as effectively as a bucket of ice water. “Draco, love, it’s completely untested,” he said. “You’re not a mouse, or a crup. Who knows what might happen?”
“No! Bloody hell, no. It’s got nothing to do with your work- last I checked, you could typeset just as well in a dress as in trousers,” Ron snapped. “You should bloody sue.”
“If you want the option of having kids with Draco’s sperm, you’ll need to get that put under a stasis spell before you start the potions,” he warned. “I keep a facility for that at my clinic, if you want. I’d recommend it. You could always use a surrogate somewhere down the line.”
As the clock crept closer to six thirty, Draco hummed with nervous energy. She kept leaping up to pace the room, casting her book aside. Even when she was sitting looking at it, she didn’t turn the pages. Her eyes kept skimming over the same paragraph, unable to take in the words. Harry pretended to watch television, but if he’d been asked the plot of the murder mystery, he couldn’t have answered. He kept an eye on Draco as she flinched with every crackle of the fire.
Harry shrugged. Over the last couple of hours, he’d run over imagined scenario after imagined scenario. Maybe he’d go home to find Draco in their bed with the witch. Maybe it would be better just to go back, gather up his stuff and leave...
“You’re in too much pain, love,” Harry murmured into her neck. “Let him help. Sam said it would be okay if we needed to.”
“What should I call you?” Harry repeated. “Do you have a girl’s name you’d prefer? And shall I use ‘she’ and ‘her’ instead of ‘he’ and ‘him’? I don’t know how to do any of this, love. You’re going to have to help me.”
Jack grinned. “Hormones. Nightmare.” He leaned down to take a stack of pamphlets from his satchel. “If you’re going to start taking the potions, you’ll need to tell people,” he told Draco. “People will notice the changes. Friends, family, work. I’ve got some stuff here with advice on how you might do it. Some people will be fine with it. Most won’t understand. Some will get angry. Be prepared for that. You might lose friendships, but you’ll find out who your true friends are.”
Hermione swirled her lemonade around in her glass. “Why is it so unbelievable?” she asked. “Draco’s never been, well, the most masculine of men.”
“Surprisingly. I was expecting Weasley to explode.”
“Please don’t hide anything else?” Harry asked. “I want to know. I love you, Draco, no matter what you look like. I didn’t fall in love with a penis, I fell in love with you.”
“No time like the present,” Jack told her cheerfully. “You go ahead and lie down on that sofa and get comfy. It’ll feel weird, but remember; I’m a healer, and I’m bound by my vows not to tell anyone about what I might see in your head. Between you and me, alright?”
Harry sighed. “What’s this about, Draco?”
Draco froze, bent over to retrieve his (very male-presenting) boxers from his drawer. “What?”
Harry kicked her under the table. “Draco’s a bit nervous,” he explained. “She’s got something she wants to say, but she’s scared you might not be supportive.”
She knocked the bottle out of his hand, sending it spinning across the bedroom floor. “No potions,” she hissed through gritted teeth.
Draco swallowed hard.
“It won’t last long,” he said by way of apology. His fingertips danced lightly over her chest, then, carefully, he dipped one below the edge of the cup to graze against her nipple. She groaned low in her throat, and then Harry’s hands had reached behind her, undoing the clasp of the bra and letting it fall to the ground. “As pretty as that is, I will always prefer you naked,” he told her. Pressing her back until her knees hit the edge of the bed, he tumbled her onto it, branching himself on his arms above her. His dark head dipped, his tongue laving gently over her engorged nipple. It sent a clenching need straight into her belly even as she hissed through her teeth.
“We can adopt,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s hairline and being rewarded by her tipping her head up so she could see him. “I always thought I might like to adopt a kid or two. Give them a good childhood. Better than I had.”
She snickered. “I didn’t say he wasn’t, and I don’t doubt you know it very well,” she said. “I’ve seen you two sneaking off before- I can’t believe how brazen you were about it at that ministry ball. You practically missed your speech.”
Draco took in a sharp breath, her nose wrinkling, then made a conscious effort to relax.
Draco shrugged. “It doesn’t work like that, I suppose. That would be too easy.”
“What?” he asked. “You said you’d tell them. Why bother waiting?”
Draco had half-finished her tea when she frowned and put a hand to her belly. “Something happening?” Jack asked, eyeing her appraisingly.
A shrug rippled through Draco’s shoulders. “I didn’t want to think about my body. Didn’t want to see it. Didn’t want you to see it. ”
Draco licked suddenly dry lips. “Okay,” she agreed. “When?”
Draco’s tone was mocking as she answered.“‘This is a traditional newspaper with traditional values, Mr Malfoy,’" she parroted in a parody of the head clerk at the
It wasn’t Jack who stood on their hearthrug. Instead, it was a slightly stooped wizard in lime green robes, his fluffy white hair straggling onto his collar. “Mr Lovegood,” Draco said coolly. “Can we help you?”
Harry decided he must have misheard.
Alone in the kitchen, Harry worked to get himself under control. His eyes fixed unseeing on the abandoned sandwiches, the full coffee cups on the table as he turned the new information over in his head. By the time Draco finished in the shower and returned to the bedroom, a towel wrapped under his arms, Harry was sitting cross-legged on the bed. “We can get more,” he said to Draco’s back.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, his back to Harry. His long blond hair was still wet, plastered against his back. “It’s… it’s not just the clothes,” he said, his voice very small. “I mean… I did wear those, a couple of times. But I hated how I looked in them.”
Hermione smirked a little, just the way she always did when she was right. Ron called it her ‘cat with the cream face’. “I knew it!” she crowed. “I knew he wouldn’t cheat on you!”
“But I want to!” she insisted reaching up to clasp his hands. “I do!”
“No idea,” Harry said. He glanced up. “Are you actually considering working for Xenophilius? Putting together stories on wrackspurts and crumple-horned snorkacks?”
The healer calling Draco ‘Mr Mafloy’ grated on Harry. He stood. “Thank you,” he said, forcing the words through gritted teeth. “Come on, Draco. We need to think about this.”
“I’ll call for you,” Jack promised. “You’ll only be in the kitchen.”
needs an editor. My Luna’s been on at me for years to get someone to help. Bit of a nightmare, really. Spend half my time putting the damned thing together. No time to go exploring. Reckon you might be just the one for the job.”
She wrapped her arms around his neck to keep him there and began to kiss him in earnest.
Awkwardly, she tucked her penis back between her legs, but the narrow gusset of the knickers couldn’t hope to contain both it and the testes that went with it. Giving up on that lost cause, she reached for the bra, squinting her eyes open to find it on the bed. It was the smallest cup size they’d had available. She knew from his last foray into bra-shopping that even her narrow chest was large for a typical woman, which made it harder to find anything to fit.
Draco haunted the flat for a week, sending out letters of enquiry for any company she thought would be likely to hire her. The owl came back empty-clawed from every missive.
Sam’s eyes roved constantly around the room. “In everything. As if you’d been born a little girl. It’s on the genetic level. I’m using muggle knowledge and magical means.” He moved suddenly, lunging forward to the table where Harry and Draco sat. Harry had his wand out in an instant, pointing at Sam.
Jack nodded to her chest. “I reckon that looks like a pretty respectable B cup,” he told her with a grin. “Nothing to be sniffed at. You’ve got some eating to do before you don’t look like you’re on the verge of starvation, though.”
and a small flat with big windows overlooking the grassy courtyard.
It took a long time for Harry to work up the courage to ask his next question. It had been bothering him for months- if truth be told, ever since Ron and Hermione had told him that they’d be having a baby. “Do you want kids?”
Harry went over to kiss her soundly. “Leave it a bit, think about it,” he advised, murmuring the words into her hair before he tucked a strand of it back behind her ear. He was sure that she was just over-excited about Jack bringing the essence potions- when she had time to think straight, she’d realise that she didn’t want to work for Xenophilius.
“Come and have a cup of tea,” Harry suggested. “Just… get dressed first. I’d rather not have Jack looking at you in all your naked glory.”
, but Draco did. “So,” Harry asked, spearing a grilled tomato, “will you go back to the healer?”
He tipped his head to the side to appreciate her from a new angle. “Of course it’s what I fell in love with,” he said. “I fell in love with you- all of you. Not just the shape of you.”
Draco hardly ate. She shuffled with nervous energy, glancing at the clock every few seconds. She leapt up when the floo chimed with an incoming visitor, knocking the table and upsetting Harry’s (thankfully empty) Crunchie-themed mug. Harry, too, spared a glance for the clock. Jack wasn’t meant to be here for another half an hour. He followed Draco into the living room at a more sedate pace.
“It’s what everyone’s always called me,” Draco said.
Pressing down the scream that was building in his chest, he hurled the lot into the fire, then collapsed down onto the hearthrug, the wool tickling his nose as he sobbed like the world was ending.
Draco hitched one shoulder in a shrug. “Yeah. And some people at work too. The things that their bodies could do that mine was too useless for. Mother wrote to me about a year ago, telling me I needed to settle down and get married so I could have an heir.”
“Yeah. It’s like legilimency, but more general. I’d like to see where your head’s at.”
Healer Bewick looked at him over the edge of her spectacles, reminding Harry strongly of Madam Pince. “This is not a process to be taken lightly, Mr. Potter. Some of the changes wrought by these potions are irreversible. It must be taken slowly, to give enough time to allow the patient enough time to change his or her mind before things become permanent. After a while on the potions- anywhere from six months to two or three years, depending- then we can talk about more permanent changes like breast augmentation and changing the appearance of genitals.”
“No, Mr. Potter,” Healer Bewick said baldly. “Not even magic can manage that.”
Harry and Jack took it in turns to sit with Draco as she slept. On the second morning, Jack squinted at her when he came to send Harry to get his breakfast. “She’s smaller,” he said.
“I think it’s a lovely name,” Harry said. “You can be called whatever you like. But you do want to be ‘she’, not ‘he’?”
Sam hitched his shoulders. “Boys are girls now. Girls are boys. Seem happy enough. Can’t talk to them to ask. Haven’t been able to crack the talking to animals yet.”
“She told them at work,” Harry said. “About going on the essence potions, being a woman. They fired her.”
“Draco,” he said carefully after another few minutes of comfortable silence, “what changed?”
“What?” Harry upset the open bottle of cleaning potion when he started. Draco snatched it up before too much of the potion could escape, using the dishcloth to wipe up the spill.
She didn’t want to disappoint him. He was so sweetly excited about their purchases. “I want to see,” he told her. “Please, don’t be shy. I want to see what you look like in them.” He held out the sky blue underwear set he’d liked so much, his green eyes wide and pleading.
Sam squinted at his inky messes as if they were a foreign alphabet. “Everything,” he said. “We’re trying to pin down magic. Haven’t been able to yet. Seems to thread through almost everything. Except that last pair. X and Y- they’re the same, no matter what we do. Muggles and wizards have just the same X and Y.”
Peeling back the covers, Draco climbed in next to Harry. “I just want it to be quicker,” she admitted. “Some days I think loads has changed, but some days, I just feel like a boy in a dress.”
Three nights later, Harry woke up to moonlight falling across the bed. The curtains open, spilling the light of the full moon and the streetlamp across the sheets. Draco wasn’t beside him; she was on the floor at the foot of the bed, her knees drawn up to her chest as she leaned her back against the footboard. “Draco?” Harry muttered, sitting up.
“Did you bring her here, Draco? Did you fuck her here- in our bed? Because why else would her underwear be here?”
He grinned. “Thanks, ‘Mione. You’re the best.”
“Why did you never tell me?” Harry asked. He reached out to touch Draco’s damp shoulder. “You never said anything.”
They didn’t talk about it, though. After they left the room, they had lunch in the Ministry cafeteria. After that, the silence on the subject seemed too thick to break. They didn’t mention it at dinner, either, or during the time they sprawled on the sofa watching television. For a while, Harry held his breath every time Draco opened her mouth, wondering if she was about to mention it. She didn’t.
Draco stared at Harry, who shamelessly stole one of Draco’s chips. “I’m still waiting for you to panic and run,” she said. “You’re… you’re being too calm.”
Draco’s mouth opened and closed like she was a fish. Harry moved to wrap an arm around her shoulders. “It’s a big decision, Mr. Lovegood,” he said carefully. “Maybe Draco could get back to you soon?”
She laughed, low and throaty. Her voice was deep, for a woman, Harry thought. Lighter than it had been, but it still sounded like Draco to him. He was pleased. “Just… be gentle?” she asked. “I’m a bit sore.”
“Say he had come to you and said he wanted to wear women’s clothes- what would you have done?” Hermione pressed.
He dug into his meal with gusto, piling his plate high. A few mouthfuls in, he glanced around the table. “What’s wrong with you?” he asked his dinner companions. “Are none of you going to eat?”
Draco didn’t hug often, but she almost knocked Hermione off her chair.
“Me transitioning?”
She looked at him, her eyes catching the silver moonlight and reflecting it back. “I’d be the test,” she said. “Someone has to be. Maybe they’ll call it the ‘Draco process’ or something.”
“Morning,” Harry said quietly.
“I… I think I still just want to be called Draco. I’ve always been Draco. It’s not too masculine… or do you think it is?”
Hermione waved off Ron’s questions, and the chair he sent floating over to her in advance of his rapid approach. “I’m fine, Ron. The baby’s not coming. I’m after Harry.”
“Hermione. They’re coming over in an hour. They’re bringing dinner.”
“Then it makes you a woman.”
A week later, Harry and Draco sat nervously in matching chairs in front of the healer’s desk, in her office on the 18th floor of St. Mungo’s.
Three hours later, Draco sat up in bed, propped up by a mountain of pillows. “How do you feel?” Jack asked.
“Very much.”
“You should tell her.”
“There are side effects to the potions,” Jack warned. “I guess you know that already though, yeah?”
“What did your mother say?”
The press of the fabric on the over-sensitised skin was almost too much- just below the edge of pain, but somehow delicious too. She peered down to see that the cups of the bra no longer hung empty, but filled with swollen flesh. Her swollen flesh.
“Have you tested it?” Harry asked. “I know you lot. You make stuff that you don’t understand and leave it lying around.” He could almost feel the creepy aura of the veil even being near this unspeakable. He shuddered.
Draco winced at the flatness of Harry’s tone. “Why on earth would I want to sleep with a woman?” he whispered. “I’m not attracted to women.”
Draco looked up in surprise. “What?” His voice was rough from tears.
“No,” Ron said. “Just… about stuff. She always says the Department of Mysteries has the best library there is. If there’s anything about changing your, you know-” Ron blushed and gestured vaguely about his own body- “it’ll be there.”
“No, really. Look.”
He didn’t think that deserved a reply. Of course she did, and she knew he thought it too.
“Coffee,” Draco said. Harry closed the bedroom door after him. She took a deep breath before she pushed the blankets back and pulled her knees up. She screwed her eyes closed as she shoved the mirror down between them. She took in another lungful of air and held it as she opened her eyes to see what that part of her looked like now.
Jack looked to Harry, his eyebrows raised in a question. Harry nodded. Jack brushed the sodden hair back from Draco’s face. “Draco? I’m going to put you to sleep for a bit, honey,” he told her.
The floo chimed again a few seconds before Jack stepped through. Draco bounded over to him. “Do you have the potions?” she asked.
After a while, Jack sat back against the armchair, one ankle resting on the opposite knee. He steepled his fingers in front of his lips and just looked at Draco for so long that she started to squirm. “I’d like to do a mind scan,” he said.
Harry didn’t think he’d sleep, but he was lulled by Draco’s deep, even breaths beside him. When he opened his eyes, sunlight showed around the edges of the curtains, and Draco was nowhere to be seen. Luckily, it wasn’t hard to track him down. Harry followed the smell of coffee and bacon to the kitchen.
“It’s mine.”
“So, do your bits turn inside out, or what?” Harry asked. He pretended to be very interested in his fried egg. “Sorry, that sounded a bit crass. I’ve just never even thought about this stuff before.”
Draco pulled back. He let out a long breath, the panic rising inside him. “Harry, I can explain!” he protested. “Please, let me explain.”
Jack nodded. He lifted the sleeping spell.
“Since forever,” Draco admitted. “I went to see a healer about it, a few years ago. Just before we, well, got together. To see if I could change. Or if she could make it stop.”
Sure enough, blood was staining the field dressing, the healing spell he’d used unable to knit the wound. “You’re supposed to have healers for this sort of thing,” Draco admonished, taking over the removal. “This looks like Weasly just slapped it on in the heat of the moment.”
“He never mentioned pay, or anything,” Draco said, spearing a piece of bacon and getting it halfway to her mouth. “Does he know, do you think? About why I got fired?”
Draco tucked her hand into the crook of Harry’s arm as they wandered the stalls. She didn’t try to hide her grin. She thought that this was possibly the happiest she’d been in years-
Her cock spang free of its confines, the little knickers unable to contain it as it too engorged with blood. She canted up her hips to yank them off, the elastic digging uncomfortably into her rapidly growing erection. Her hand brushed against the placket of Harry’s trousers, where his own erection strained against the fabric. “Fuck, Draco,” Harry said hoarsely. “I really, really want to fuck you.”
Harry squeezed her hand. “It doesn’t matter,” he said. “We’ve already talked about that part. It’s covered.”
She put her head down on his lap and stretched her legs across the remainder of the sofa. Her sock-clad feet hung off the end. She was wearing the socks with crups on them. He smiled. His fingers petted at her soft hair. “Alright,” Jack said, his voice low and soft. “Just relax now. Try not to fight me.” He put the tip of his wand to Draco’s temple.
“Vaguely,” Harry said. He knew better than to tell an unspeakable that you knew what they were up to. It made them twitchy. Well, twitchier. “You think you can change someone’s sex.”
“Are you sure you’re okay with the physical changes too?” Jack was frowning. He’d reluctantly given the course of treatment his grudging blessing, but he insisted on staying, if only because he was determined that a trained healer should be present. “Periods, for a start, and all the mess and problems that might come along with them? Contraception? Childbirth, if you choose it?”
Draco put her hand on Harry’s arm. “No, Harry,” she said. “Stop. This… this is fine. It’s better than what I’d have had from Bewick. The world isn’t ready for the ‘Harry Potter charitable fund for transsexual research’.”
Jack spread his hands. “Harry, Draco… you’ve gotta understand. This ain’t that common. There are only six healers in the world who’ll oversee this sort of thing, and we ain’t overrun. Most of them don’t specialise. Hestia Bewick- she’s a gynaecologist, a lady parts doctor. This ain’t her bread and butter. Only me and Healer Ashraf, in Pakistan, specialise completely. We don’t see no other patients except those that want to change their sex, but the other four? It’s just a sideline. There’s not the interest in research for new potions and spells.”
Harry looked at the blob of ink spreading out over the parchment from Sam’s quill. He’d understood barely one word of that. What did these squiggles have to do with being male or female?
“Editor?” Draco squeaked. “I was just a clerk at the
“They took it well?”
He followed her to the bedroom, leaning against the door frame as she shoved her new underwear back into the bag and thrust the bag under her side of the bed. She pulled out a fresh pair of boxers and grimaced at them. “You can wear the pretty stuff if you like,” Harry said softly. “You could wear the skirt too, if you wanted. They won’t mind.”
Draco had never been able to hide blushes. It was one of the things Harry loved, and, he realised now, that he’d missed the most. In the dark, he couldn’t see the crimson spread across Draco’s cheeks when Harry hissed dirty words into his ear. Now, though, Draco wrenched his face away from Harry’s hand, turning his cheek to try to hide his flushed face. “I wore them a couple of times.”
Sam nodded. He fished in his pocket and pulled out a card. It was inscribed with only his first name, followed by a Ministry floo address. “Let me know,” he said, and left as abruptly as he’d arrived.
Harry picked up a glass from the draining board, filled it, and handed it over. “What’s going on, Hermione?” he asked.
Harry sat in the quiet of Ron and Hermione’s kitchen a while more before he couldn’t bear it any longer. Torturing himself wasn’t helping anything. He had to know.
“And what happened?”
With a frown, Jack felt her ribs too. He waved his wand in a complicated movement over her body. “I think she doesn’t have enough body fat, so her body’s pulling too much to redistribute,” he said. “At least her bone density still looks okay.”
“You didn’t know that Xenophilius Lovegood was mad?” Harry asked. “How could you possibly think he was sane?”
As it happened, Ron and Hermione arrived by way of the front door and not the floo. Ron bore an armful of plastic bags stuffed with takeaway containers. “Don’t worry,” he said by way of greeting, “I didn’t let Hermione just pick korma and butter chicken. There’s some actual curry in there too.”
“Can somebody explain what the bloody hell’s going on for muggins here?” Ron asked. “Because I think I might know, but I can’t wrap my brain around it.”
Her whine reached a crescendo as she shook her head. “No potions. You said no potions! Sam said no potions.”
