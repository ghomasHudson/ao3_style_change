It’s actually helping a bit, he thinks. A few more minutes pass as he allows himself to be lulled by the rhythmic, repetitive nature of the task. It’s soothing, allowing him to concentrate on the work of revealing the wand’s shape. It’s like slowly undressing someone, peeling back layer after layer until—Harry curses his traitorous mind and refocuses on what his hands are doing. It’s just a chisel and a wood block, there’s nothing weird about it. It’s just the repetition of long, careful strokes against the hard, firm wood and—
“Oh, it is,” Ginny said seriously. “But it’s also for you. Like Pansy says, everybody should have a therapist.” She looked past Harry for a moment and waved; Harry looked behind him and saw Blaise Zabini, Ginny’s other significant other, making his way through the crowd, drink in hand. She had started dating him a few months after getting together with Pansy, and their triad was a regular feature at Gryffindor pub nights. “Even Blaise has got one, haven’t you dear?” Ginny said, shifting over to make room on the bench as he reached the table.
Tran made a noncommittal noise. “And what leads you to believe that you won’t wind up here again in a few months when it starts getting intense again?” she asked. “Or told to leave the Aurors entirely?”
Draco stopped abruptly in the doorway as his eyes were drawn to the patient lying in the bed. It was unmistakably Harry Potter, and Draco felt his stomach lurch, but his professional training kicked in immediately.
The long, drawn-out minutes he spends detailing the wand are absolute torture, especially since he occupies himself telling Draco what he’s going to do to him first.
In the end, Draco finished going through his side of Harry’s desk first and had to watch anyway. In Lord Fauntleroy’s defence, the paperwork was more or less together, despite the mess it existed within. Harry let out a shout of triumph as he discovered a witness information sheet; skimming the page, it looked like it contained a transcription of one of the Diagon shopkeepers’ statements about the early thefts. He handed the page to Draco and pulled the rest of the parchment stack closer to him so he could flip through its contents more easily.
Ginny looked surprised for the first time. “Oh,” she said. “Well, before he left Ron was saying things about you and Malfoy spending quality time together today, and I remember what you were like about him in the past, and then you showed up here together… I guess I just assumed you and he were—”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at that. Malfoy lit a cigarette and took a long, slow drag from it. “I know I should quit,” he said once he had finished blowing a cloud of smoke into the air. “One of these days. Maybe if I go back to school.”
“Draco,” Harry interrupted, “the suspense is making me one hundred times more uncomfortable right now, I promise.”
“Oh, Potter,” Draco said, and he had such a fond look on his face that Harry thought he might actually melt. “I have wanted this for… well, much longer than I should have, really.”
Harry grimaced. “Sorry,” he said. “I don’t want to rant at you all night. We can talk about something else.”
Harry waved him off. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he said. “You’ve done your part. You’re free now; go enjoy an actual holiday for the next couple days.”
Three days later, Harry is on edge as he waits for Malfoy to arrive. He has spent the intervening time looking through the Hogwarts library after receiving special permission from Headmistress McGonagall, but he hasn’t found much that’s useful. The collection is light on wand lore, and Flourish and Blotts strictly sells what Ollivander used to derisively call “light reading” on the subject.
They ambled out of the entryway and into the living room, where they found Bill and Fleur chatting with Arthur.
“You always have a choice, Harry,” Draco said, suddenly gazing at him seriously. “I wish to be very clear on this point.”
A knock at the workshop door pulls Harry out of his thoughts. He leaves his stool and goes to the door, takes a breath before opening it; Malfoy is standing there, proud as ever, but Harry thinks he can detect a tension about his lean frame.
He allowed the reading to wash over him, listening to the rise and fall of the priest’s voice and the cadence of her sentences, content to simply exist for a few moments without other cares. He found himself wondering what Draco thought of all this, whether visiting this church was only a Christmas tradition for him, or if he regularly attended on Sundays as well. Given how tightly Draco hewed to structure and order in his work life, it didn’t seem particularly likely that Draco would just turn up to any old church for the religious equivalent of a one night stand. Then again, Harry no longer felt confident that he knew his partner as well as he had believed he did. Draco continued to surprise him.
Harry smiled to himself. It was a classic Draco non-apology - acknowledging his involvement in whatever transpired, and a vague sentiment of regret that still cast him as the party on the correct side of the issue. Harry used to find them frustrating when they had started working closely together, but as he had grown more accustomed to Draco’s personality, he had begun to appreciate them almost as an art form.
Having no idea where they were going, Harry allowed Draco to lead. They walked in companionable silence down the street, past the alley where Harry had first arrived, before Harry felt compelled to say
wasn’t at all like he had expected, but to his surprise, he realized he was enjoying himself. “I'm at your mercy.”
“I’m quite calm!” Harry realized as he said it that he was raising his voice, but it was only because the volume level in the Leaky was getting unbearably loud. He tried to tone it down a bit. “I am! I was just taken by surprise, that’s all.”
“Focus, Potter!” Draco said sharply. Letting go of Potter’s dick, he reached out with both hands and placed them on the other man’s arse. It really was a fine specimen, he thought. It fit wonderfully in his hands. He gave a little push against it, forcing Potter to thrust his cock into Draco’s mouth and eliciting a hiss of pleasure from him. “Or do you need some more encouragement?” he tried to ask around it. “Perhaps you’d like to fuck my mouth?” The words came out a bit garbled, since he still had the length of Potter’s dick to contend with.
“Malfoy,” Potter said, and the sudden dread in his voice made Draco stop and look closely at him. “It’s here. The cloud.”
“I’m coming in there, alright?” Draco asks, and he waits until he sees Harry’s slow nod, his eyes closed once more as he swipes at them, before he starts removing his pyjamas. Sliding the cubicle door aside, he steps in behind Harry and under the stream of water. It’s practically scalding, much hotter than Draco prefers, and he quickly reaches out to twist the knob that will temper the heat a bit.
“Well,” Draco said, quite at a loss for words at this new development. “That’s quite alright. Here I am, anyways.” He wrenched his eyes up to Potter’s face, away from that indecently muscled abdomen and the small thatch of hair peeking out— “You wanted to talk about something?” he hazarded.
“I’m going to start guessing,” Harry threatened. “I can read your face and figure out if I’m right. I have all the latest interrogation methods at my disposal.”
“Why are you really assisting with the class?” Harry asked as he carefully resumed deepening the indentation in his clay. “And don’t give me that pat answer about ‘somebody needed to do it.’ I just want to understand why.”
“What are you playing at, Potter?” Draco finally asked, sounding annoyed, after he pushed his chair back in order to stretch his legs only to discover a full-size Christmas tree blocking his path.
There’s a look of surprise on Draco’s face as he touches the wand for the first time; Harry notices it but pays it no mind. He’s closing the space between them, repeating the words “Draco, please,” over and over. Just as he reaches Draco, overwhelmed by the possibilities of what they can finally do together, Draco’s face hardens and something changes.
“Potter, what do you remember about after you finished eighth year?” Draco asked. He had a terrible suspicion that the answer was about to make his job more difficult.
go through them. She was Teddy’s age, and I kept thinking… Anyways, the new test results came back. There was swelling in her brain. Nobody was arguing we should send her home anymore. At least we could treat it.” Harry turns away from Draco, sort of flopping on his back as he lets out a sigh. “It just… hit me, how young she was. How it could have been so much worse if we sent her home. If I wasn’t there.”
“No, Potter,” Draco said. “I’m going to tell you all about it; only then will you learn the error of your ways. You can ask whatever you’d like.”
Giving it his best attempt at looking like a regular, every-day person out for a walk in the neighbourhood at 8:00 in the morning on a Saturday, he sauntered past the front door, pausing at the studio window to press his face to the glass and look inside. To his surprise, he saw Malfoy sitting at a wheel, working away at a piece that was tall and narrow, and made of sinuous curves.
A week later, Draco rounded a corner in Diagon Alley and tripped face first over Harry Potter’s terrible professor shoes.
“I think you must be mistaken,” Draco said. “The two of you haven’t been married for years.” It seemed like as good a subject as any to prod at to provoke a reaction from Potter. Maybe being reminded of how things turned out would be shocking enough to kick them back to the world outside Potter’s uninspired head.
Harry flipped two fingers at him good-naturedly. “Pass me that,” he said, motioning to the mug on Draco’s desk.
“First of all, you can go fuck yourself,” he gasps. “Second, you’re a Veela, and you need to stop whatever it is you’re doing to me right now.”
“That could work,” Harry said after thinking about it for a moment. “But I should probably be the person to go and convince Evidence to let us look at their records. You may have already burned that bridge.”
“Oh,” Malfoy said, and Harry could swear there was a flash of disappointment on his face before he turned away to blow out another cloud of smoke.
Draco looked where Harry was pointing and sighed in exasperation. “Merlin, tell me we’re not going to drink a passable Firewhiskey out of mugs, and dirty ones at that. I should have known better.”
Harry pondered his options. Draco hadn’t told him where he was going tonight, but he had certainly implied earlier that he wouldn’t just be at home. Harry was pretty sure he knew where Draco lived; there had been a drinks night a few months earlier after a big bust, and when Draco had decided to leave that evening Harry had been chatting with him next to the Floo. Draco had grabbed some powder, then looked around before meeting Harry’s eyes for a moment, then tossed the powder into the fireplace and saying an address that Harry
“Jealousy,” Malfoy muses, and his fucking hand is just sitting possessively at the base of Harry’s neck and it’s all Harry can do to refrain from rubbing himself against it like a kneazle in heat. “Do you think your theory was correct?”
Maybe it’s just the pleasure of watching Malfoy beg for Harry’s help, acknowledging the power that Harry holds over him and how he fucked up, but Harry’s feeling slightly better about this encounter. Maybe he’ll hear the git out. “Broken how?” Harry asks cautiously.
Beside him, Ginny snorted. “Merlin, you sound like Dad. And yes, Pansy is honestly a delight when you get to know her.”
Harry imagined himself as an Auror in another four years. It made him feel tired just thinking about it, but that was fine. Tiredness could be managed. His mind rebelled when he tried to contemplate forty years in the Aurors, but surely Mr Weasley had been working for the Ministry for that long. That was normal. He would just have to grit his teeth and bear it.
“It’ll be fine,” Harry said. “If you just take that half of the piles, I’ll take this side, and we’ll find it in no time.”
At some point, he found himself rubbing his eyes and squinting out the window. “Lord, how late is it?” he asked. A quick
“Bring Malfoy along, then,” Ron suggested breezily. “Have some tea and cakes, coo over your new jumper from Mum. It’ll be fine.”
As soon as Draco’s chest was freed, Potter leaned forward and placed his hands on Draco’s pecs, then allowed himself to slide backwards and forwards where they were joined at the crotch. They both moaned at the sensation, a delicious, sinful sound from Potter and something that sounded like a dying animal coming from Draco.
She usually broke first and asked one of her questions. That seemed to be her favourite defensive move when she encountered his implacable silences. She’d start in on another annoying round of “What was something that made you feel frustrated this week?”, and then he’d give her one of his reassuring smiles and say something like “Oh, I don’t really know,” and glance at the clock on the wall to see if it was time to leave yet. It never was.
“But if you don’t try the same dish from all the different restaurants, how will you know which one is your favourite?” Draco persisted.
“I’m sorry, I’ve got to go,” he said quickly. “I’ve got a—there’s a thing.” He shifted from one foot to the other uncomfortably, trying not to look at his shoes.
Draco felt it begin in Potter’s thighs first, as they clenched around his chest. Draco was as hard as he’d ever been; he thought he might actually be in danger of coming, too.
Draco’s first instinct is to reply with something a little bit cutting about Harry’s need to flagellate himself, but something about Harry’s demeanour seems more fragile than usual. “Must have been quite a night,” he says instead, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist, and he feels Harry lean back into him in response. He’s tense, but when Draco gives him a bit of a squeeze out of habit he feels Harry shudder a bit before leaning more of his weight against Draco.
“Um,” Harry said, his heart suddenly beating faster. He fought against the desire to look down and stared at Malfoy instead, trying to remember how to blink. “Sure, ok.” The weight of Malfoy’s fingers on his wrist vanished as quickly as it had arrived, but the sensation lingered. He slowly began to move his hands back towards his wheel; the distance they had to cover suddenly felt vast without any ability to see where he was moving them.
“Don’t let me get in your way,” Malfoy says, and he takes a step aside to allow Harry to pass, maintaining eye contact the entire time that is honestly far too intense.
Harry was getting very close to the end of his paperwork when he suddenly felt his shield charm wink out of existence. He immediately turned and dodged an
“Let’s make it three,” Harry says, thinking about all the books on wand lore and magical creatures that he needs to dig through.
Draco was left speechless for a long moment as Potter busied himself with more useless shifting of papers. The audacity of Potter’s dream-brain to insist that Draco’s son would be a Gryffindor named Albus Severus… to be fair, Draco wouldn’t have minded naming a child of his after his godfather, but really, this was going too far.
Draco waits to see if there’s more. “Are you finished?” he finally asks, and Harry nods in response. “Harry, it’s been actual, literal years since I paid any attention to your estimates of when you’ll be home,” he says, propping his head up on his right arm. “You are wildly optimistic about how long it takes you to do things, so I make sure that our plans are flexible.” Harry snorts, shakily, but doesn’t interrupt. “None of this is news to me. I made my peace with our situation a while ago, and I. Am. Fine with it. I know how important it is that you continue saving every member of the wizarding world-”
“We’re still technically partners,” Harry pointed out. “I haven’t finished my paperwork yet. That means you’re, how did you put it— ‘giving the appearance of respecting law and order, until it no longer benefits you to do so?’” He smiled widely. “Interesting, isn’t it?”
Draco waited until Potter was level with the highest shelf. Given the way the dream had gone so far, it seemed the likeliest place to find Potter’s missing memories, tucked away somewhere difficult to reach. “Ok, now read off some titles that you see,” Draco called up to him.
She gave him a level look across the table. “Come on. Therapy’s not something to be embarrassed about. I’ve got a therapist; we usually only meet a couple times a year now, but I used to go more often.”
Jenkins immediately reached out and cast a diagnostic charm, but Draco could already see Potter’s eyes beginning to flutter open. “He’s waking up!” Jenkins announced, unnecessarily, as Potter yawned and stretched.
The rest of the evening passes quietly, as Draco rattles around their large flat looking for things to keep himself occupied. By the time it’s quarter to eleven, Draco is sitting in Harry’s armchair and reading a book. He always takes advantage of Harry’s absences to sit in his chair, or sleep in his side of the bed. There’s a look that Harry gives him when he realizes that the cushion indentations are slightly wrong, and Draco always pretends he has no idea what Harry is on about. Now Draco finds himself rereading the same page over and over, and his blinks are gradually growing slower. There’s been no further word from Harry, so he finally hauls himself off to bed. He rolls his head around on Harry’s pillow a bunch for good measure before switching off the lamp and drifting off to sleep.
Draco comes to alertness in the middle of a snore. He grimaces, rolls over and adjusts his pillow, and is surprised to find no trace of Harry in his usual spot in the bed. That's when his other senses kick in and he realizes that he can still hear the shower running.
in a dark alleyway, feeling his stomach twist as the sensation of Apparition left him. Looking around as he exited the alleyway, he saw a mixture of darkened shops and houses, and further down the street the imposing facade of a church. The church’s doors were closed, but through the windows spilled warm, golden light and Harry could hear the strains of an organ from inside as well.
“I’m just helping the experiment,” Harry says innocently, appreciating the sight of Malfoy’s lips drawing together into a thin line. They’re nicer lips when they’re fuller and pressed against Harry’s of course, but he’ll take whatever pleasure he can get from this afternoon.
They crept through the darkened halls of the school. Draco caught sight of the darkness out of the corner of his eye a couple times along the way, but he was careful to focus Potter’s attention on other things. He made wry comments about Potter’s rule-breaking tendencies, or how it probably wouldn’t even matter if they were caught because of the special treatment that Potter would undoubtedly receive. The other man invariably began to snipe back at him in whispered tones, and when Draco checked again he could no longer see any sign of the cloud.
“My office?” Harry asked, sounding uncertain. “Is that another change for eighth years? Why can’t McGonagall just give us a normal school year?”
Under other circumstances, if he weren’t trying to craft a wand under the waxing sex magic of a one night stand that he’s having trouble getting over, Harry might be tempted to lie. At this moment, however, he’s powerless. “I made that up,” he says. Malfoy hisses quietly, and it’s like someone has cast a warming charm on the room. Harry’s palms feel clammy on the chisel. “It was just something to get under your skin. To test my theory.”
The next twenty minutes passed in a blur as Harry found a rhythm. He had the cheat sheet that Draco had made for quickly decoding the intern’s shorthand, and he no longer allowed himself to get distracted by how pretty the lettering on the page was. He was able to make good progress on his stack of papers, but he knew he was in trouble when he looked up and saw Draco already emptying his second-to-last desk drawer. Draco was definitely going to finish first if they both kept up their current rate of progress.
“The course listing disagrees,” Harry said eventually. He looked up and met Malfoy’s eyes, looking relieved. “I only teach Defence Against the Dark Arts.”
“Robards told us to track down that new brewer,” Harry said slowly. “He said it was vital; he needed our skills in the field, not filling out forms.”
“Like I said earlier, I don’t actually know how to do that,” Draco says drily. He looks conflicted. “Are you sure this is a good idea?”
"Yes, well, that’s hardly a surprise,” Draco said drily, but as they passed under a streetlight, Harry noticed that the tips of his ears appeared pink. Harry smiled to himself, feeling pleased.
Potter pulled a face at him. “Do you really still care about Slughorn’s assignment?” he asked. “Aren’t there more important things to think about, like how there’s an evil cloud devouring the school?”
It sounded like a rhetorical question, but Harry felt a bit punch drunk after his confession. “The way your hands feel like a flobberworm sneezed all over them?” he asked.
“Very well,” Draco said, closing his eyes and stretching in a way that caused an indecent amount of neck to be exposed. Harry looked away. “Good work today.”
“Harry!” Draco says urgently, and Harry realizes he’s closed half the distance between them, and Draco is actually looking slightly alarmed. “The wand!”
“Well, if it’s things that wake me up,” Harry continued, and then trailed off with an inexplicable blush. “Er,” he said. “It’s… never mind.”
“Five minute break!” Melanie announced, interrupting Harry’s reverie. “It’s always a good idea to stretch your legs and move around a bit to keep the blood flowing!”
Harry paused. Their conversation after the church service was top of his mind, but that really wasn’t something he felt he could share, given Draco’s secrecy around it. “Oh, nothing specific,” he said, trying to deflect. “Just bits here and there. You know how it is. There’s just more there than I think I ever realised.”
“I’m not here with—” Harry glanced around; he didn’t really want to break the statute of secrecy by accident. “You know, work. This is unrelated to that.”
Harry couldn’t stand the quiet any longer. “So,” he began nervously. “If you were trying to get your box back just now, it doesn’t seem like that was very effective.”
Hermione pursed her lips consideringly but chose not to press the point. “If you say so,” she said. “Come on, the others will be mad if I monopolise you and you’re only here for a little while."
“Yes, Albus is not doing as well in my class as I had hoped, to be honest,” Potter said, pulling another piece of parchment out of his disaster of a desk and glancing it over. “He had a very promising start this term, but he has not handed in any of the three most recent assignments. I suspect it’s the company he’s keeping, but he won’t explain why he’s not turning anything in.”
“Did I hear you right?” Malfoy asks. He sounds amused. “You’re going to make me a wand while I do everything in my power to seduce you?”
“It requires a very complex web of blackmail and mind control magic,” Harry said. “Honestly, it’s exhausting keeping it up. I’m thinking of turning myself in.”
Tran was eyeing him again, and Harry realized that his polite smile had faded as soon as he’d stopped thinking about it. He sighed. This was going about as well as most of his appointments so far. He reached out for the paper on her desk, just for something to do with his hands.
She shifted her position, swinging one muscled arm up along the top of the booth. “Is that like when people who are dating say they’re taking a break?” she asked with a grin. “Because it sure sounds familiar.”
Harry sighs. This is getting into new territory for him. “I need to do some research. Consult with some people. You should come back later this week. Maybe try not to make anyone fall in love with you.”
“I think the cloud is the way your unconscious mind is trying to make sense of something that’s happening in your brain,” Draco said. He was honestly just thinking aloud at this point, but as a theory it explained quite a lot. “Something very real is stealing your memories, and your dreams are trying to incorporate it however they can.”
He was saved from having to come up with an answer by another knock at the door. Potter frowned. “Not a moment’s peace around here,” he muttered as he went over to open it.
“There was so much paper by the end,” Harry said, frowning. “He spent days compiling it all. I remember he worked right up until the end of his internship while we focused on tracking down the brewer.”
“Slughorn said…” Draco wracked his brain for something that could catch Harry’s attention. “He said the book we need might be tucked in between some other unrelated books. And you may feel a slight tingle when you touch it.”
As his eyes adjusted to the well-lit interior, they were drawn to a large colourful sign across from the doorway that declared: “Welcome to St. Michael’s! All are welcome (especially you)!” A grey-haired woman was standing nearby the door holding what looked like programs, and she quickly spotted him and ushered him inside with a smile. He reluctantly stepped into the building; it felt like it would be rude to refuse the invitation.
made Malfoy dart a glance towards him, for some reason, but he quickly looked away again and scrubbed a hand through his hair. “Merlin,” he said. “I’m just trying to offer a fucking olive branch here. Yes, maybe in a formal class setting surrounded by other students you
Robards looked meaningfully at the chaos that reigned on Harry’s desk. “Didn’t you have some kind of New Year’s resolution about reaching inbox zero this year?”
“I don’t actually know if I can control this,” Draco says against his neck, and Harry tries to concentrate on the words rather than the sensation of Draco’s lips on his skin. “I’ll go. We can find some other way.”
underground brewer we had to track down,” Harry said. “And Robards was like, ‘This is your top priority!’”
“Everyone, a quick announcement!” Melanie called. “Draco here will be assisting with our class, so feel free to ask him questions as he circulates.”
In any case, to Draco’s relief they arrived outside the library without further mishap. He felt like he deserved that win; not only had Potter turned out to be more resistant to Draco’s attempts to steer the dream than he’d anticipated, but there was also the mysterious cloud pillaging Potter’s memories. If they escaped this dream intact, it could make for a compelling paper in the mind-magic research community.
“Yes,” Harry says. Everything feels weird between them now that Harry knows what he has to do. “Well. Come in, then.” He steps back and allows Malfoy to enter the workshop.
“Interesting,” she said, which Harry thought was a very weird reply. She was being very therapist-like right then, which he supposed meant she was good at her job, too. “It’s just that most people I talk to who want to go back to work try to follow my instructions. ‘Jump through the hoops,’ as you put it so eloquently in our first session. You just glare at me and barely even go through the motions. Why do you think that is?”
Casting the partner locator spell once more, he felt a strong pull down the street in the direction of the church. “Huh,” Harry said, taken aback. He made his way slowly towards the church, checking the spell every so often, but there was no change. He tried continuing past it, but the locator bond abruptly changed directions as he began to move farther away from the building, tugging insistently to his rear.
“Er,” Harry said, realizing that he was staring again. “Well. Next time, then. Don’t let me keep you!” As he turned back to his own paperwork, he saw Draco give him a little curious look and panicked slightly. He hoped he hadn’t overplayed his hand by inviting Draco out, but the fear that Draco suspected kept bouncing around his head as his partner put on his coat and left for the day.
Harry was so bored. It was almost time for the second break, and despite the mysterious and very suspicious sudden appearance of Malfoy the class had not actually become significantly more interesting. Harry had honestly tried to work on his bowl, but the whole thing felt a bit hopeless. He kept accidentally creating holes in the bottom, or ruining the outer structure by pulling it towards him unevenly, or coning down off centre and ending up with a piece that was impossible to work with as it flew around the wheel. The teacher said this was normal, but he was sure he could see the judgement in her face when he still had no success after the first hour. He dutifully started again after each failed attempt, pushing the clay back into a ball and starting from scratch, but he noticed that none of the other students seemed to have the same kinds of struggles as he did.
Harry smiled as Teddy’s face lit up. “Let me go get it!” Teddy said excitedly, and he ran back towards the house, his small legs pumping madly.
Harry progressively made the rounds of his chosen family. Percy wished him a productive new year with many opportunities for advancement. George swooped down on a broom to high five him and ask if he was up for some gnome racing later, and Charlie and his boyfriend tried to convince Harry to take a vacation and come visit the Romanian dragon sanctuary they both worked at. Harry spotted Pansy a few times, usually sticking close to Ginny, but by the time he reached them, Pansy had gone back into the house to refill her drink.
All eyes in the room swung to Harry. “Wait, you mean this was… an attack or something?” he asked, eyes wide. “Why?”
Draco interest was piqued by that detail. “Your wife?” he asked innocently. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that you were married. Who’s your wife?”
Harry notices a pattern though. Whenever he gets bored, he finds himself taunting Malfoy, trying to get a rise out of him. It seems like the slips in his magic are related somehow to Malfoy giving Harry his attention. Harry can’t help it; he finds himself craving that little spark when he can get under Malfoy’s skin, even though he feels a bit bad that Malfoy can’t really go anywhere else. He keeps telling himself that he’ll be professional, but then Malfoy gets in his own dig at Harry in return, and that competitive spirit urges him on.
to say that I like how many times I can fuck up a piece and it never matters. I can start again from the beginning, or I can try to salvage it and turn it into something else. But there really is no limit to the mistakes that I am allowed to make, and I find that… surprisingly freeing.”
Malfoy tossed him a casual middle finger as he pushed off the wall. “See you inside,” was all he said, though, before he pulled open the studio door and went back in without another look.
shouldn’t be focused on how gratifying the other man’s response was, but honestly, who could blame him for it?
Harry lets out a shaky sigh of relief, and their faces are close enough together that Draco feels some of his hair shift in response. “I love you so much,” Harry says, and he presses a kiss against Draco’s lips. Draco returns it, and it’s sweet and gentle, and then Harry shifts a bit and their bodies press against each other and suddenly it feels like it could turn into something else at any moment.
“Nice to see you,” Harry said. He felt tension leaving him that he hadn’t realised he was carrying; he missed spending time with his closest friends. “Happy Christmas Andromeda!” Turning to Draco, he said: “Hermione and I will just be over there, ok?” He immediately pulled a surprised Hermione away with him, and he saw Draco give him a slightly panicky nod in response. Andromeda didn’t even acknowledge Harry’s greeting; she was busy looking Draco over, who firmed up his back and returned her gaze resolutely.
This time, Draco breathed lightly on the skin on the side of Potter’s neck as he moved his hand across Potter’s jeans, just brushing his crotch. He could feel a bulge forming, and Potter hissed at the sensation, thrusting a bit to force more contact with Draco’s hand.
Draco was confident that his plan wouldn’t work if Potter wasn’t involved in choosing the book. As the non-dreamer, Draco had very little ability to influence the dream’s actual content except through his suggestions to Potter. Potter’s mind was the source of the environment and the objects within it, so he needed to be the one to conjure up the book that he would then be able to find. Draco just needed to nudge him in the right direction.
“Too late, I’m already on my way,” Draco said as he began climbing up the ladder. It shifted distressingly under their combined weight the higher he went, but it remained in position.
want to break the statute of secrecy. “You left your, er, special stick in the office, and I was worried you wouldn’t be able to get into your flat and might think you’d lost it.” He patted his coat pocket and raised his eyebrows meaningfully.
Malfoy lifted his fingers away, hovering them just over the wheel without touching the work in progress. There seemed to be scant millimetres separating them from the clay, but Malfoy kept perfect control and never let them touch. “Sometimes I take stock of what I’ve done so far,” he began. “Then I try to visualize what I will do next. For me, pottery is about being deliberate, about making choices.” He moved his hands above the indentation he’d previously made, held them there once more. He lightly ran one finger along the rim, not making an impression, just seeming to enjoy the sensation. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of the sight.
Draco cradled Potter’s dick in a loose fist, wanking him slowly. “Do you think a blowjob would help your concentration?” he asked, his voice light. “You were doing so well, after all.
It began as a game to annoy Draco. When Harry was feeling overwhelmed by the paperwork, he would take a small break and bide his time until Draco was deep in concentration. Then he would introduce some new magical Christmas decoration around them, as carefully and silently as he could.
“And then convinced Robards to assign the trainees to rotate through as round-the-clock observers, yeah,” Harry said. They’d spent days poring over the list of prior thefts, looking for any kind of theme or modus operandi to predict what might be hit next. Eventually, Harry had suggested they resort to brute force, and Draco had reluctantly agreed. They were only able to sell it to Robards as a training exercise, who had initially baulked at the cost of maintaining constant vigilance on the shops at Diagon Alley.
“I do appreciate your saviour tendencies tonight, Potter,” he said. “Thank you for bringing me this.” He tucked his wand into his pocket and gave Harry a small smile.
“Healer Malfoy,” Draco repeated, trying not to roll his eyes. “I’m the Healer assigned to… Mr. Potter’s case. I specialize in mind-related ailments. Are you the one who brought him in?”
“This isn’t about me, Potter,” Draco said. “This is about me tormenting you until you’re half out of your mind.”
Potter’s breath caught at that. “Oh,” he said. “Yes. I think that will work.” He got onto the bed, kneeling down and facing away from Draco submissively. “Like this?” he asked. The only sign of tension in his body was how tightly he was gripping the book of memories.
Nothing in Draco’s life was ever easy, he decided. Even enjoying a dream romp with an attractive childhood nemesis turned out to have life-or-death consequences attached to it. “Your problem, Potter,” Draco began, “is that you think too much.” He reached out and unbuttoned Potter’s trousers, then glanced up to confirm that the other man was watching his actions. “May I?” he asked, shimmying further down the bed underneath Potter until his head was just about level with Potter’s crotch. He palmed Potter’s hard cock through his pants. “I think I can help with that.”
“And yet,” Malfoy said, sounding triumphant, “you admitted earlier you needed to be here. That implies you were sent. So which is it, hmm?”
“Ok,” Harry says. “You’re going to try to make this stool hover with each of these wands. If it works at all, I want you to maintain it and see if the same problem occurs.”
“Remember?” Potter asked. He appeared baffled by the question. “I’m going to join the Aurors. It’s why I need my NEWTs.”
“Oh, that’s all, is it?” Harry asked. He felt ridiculous for how readily he gave in, but the challenge appealed to him. His mind felt alive like it hadn’t in days, his body thrumming with potential. “I think I should get to ask you some questions too,” he said. “It’s only fair.”
Draco chuckled drily. “You’re right,” he said. He took a deep breath, then: “This is my last case that we’ll work on together. I’m leaving the Aurors.”
Draco grabbed Potter’s hips as his cock pulled back across Draco’s lips. He held Potter there, the tip of his cock bobbing just beyond the reach of Draco’s mouth, and Potter began to strain against his grip, desperate to continue his interrupted rhythm.
touched by Potter’s faith that he would be able to save them. He nodded brusquely. “That’s right,” he said. “Let me know when you’re finished.”
There are several chopped garlic cloves, some plum tomatoes, the spice mixture that he’s already prepared for when he’s ready to start frying, and an unpeeled onion; he prefers to leave that for last because of the painful way his eyes react to the fumes as he dices them. There’s a finely chopped red chili that’s a compromise between his own tastes and Harry’s, who grows more and more enamoured with heat with each passing year. The basmati rice is already in the rice cooker - since it turns itself off when it’s ready he always starts it immediately to avoid forgetting about it in the bustle of pulling a meal together.
volumes one through twenty,” Harry answered. “They’re all massive, too. I don’t know what you’re expecting to find here.”
“God,” Harry said, suddenly miserable. “If only.” He suddenly realized what he had just admitted and felt his cheeks heat. “Please don’t tell anyone about—”
Harry chuckled as he accepted the mug and poured another measure into it. He would definitely miss winding Draco up on a daily basis. “Here you go,” he said, handing it back once he was finished.
“But…” Malfoy begins, before trailing off. He looks uncertain for once, like his whole world has shifted. “What do I do? And why is this only happening to me now?”
Robards harrumphed, but he was clearly too taken by the holiday spirit to press the matter. “If you say so,” he said. “I don’t want any overtime this year. No repeats of last year’s budget disasters or Kingsley will have my head.”
Several knocks on his workshop door interrupt his thoughts. He frowns; he’s not expecting anybody today, and his previous special commissions have been arranged by mail. Harry peers out the window, trying to make out the figure standing outside, but the angle’s not quite right. He gets up and wipes his hands on his apron, trying to brush away the worst of the wood shavings and sawdust, and pulls open the door.
“Oh, that’s right,” Draco said. “He had the most elegant quillmanship, and he wrote so slowly as a result.”
Hermione gave him a sympathetic look. “We know this is difficult for you, but she may have a point. This hasn’t really been much of a break for you, has it?”
Malfoy shrugged and returned his attention to his own work. Harry watched his hands glide across the rim of the pot that he was working on, smoothly revealing a rim that was slightly folded over itself. It was like watching magic, and it was infuriating.
Harry flicked some water at Malfoy; the other man jerked backwards from it, but his smile seemed a bit wider as he looked down at his own wheel again. Harry found himself mirroring it as he started his clay spinning. The morning was going nothing like he had expected; in fact, the whole thing was rather odd, but not in a bad way. Suddenly feeling decisive, he resolved to start with a small bowl. Perhaps things were looking up for him.
Harry’s entire body reacts violently to this notion. “No!” he exclaims, and he reaches back and grips Draco’s arms, keeping him in place.
“Teddy, this is Draco,” Harry said to the suddenly shy boy. “He’s an Auror like me. He’s actually my partner. He’s also your, um…” Harry paused for a moment as he tried to work out the branches of the Black family tree that separated Draco and Teddy.
Draco looked at Harry dubiously. “If you had ever cleansed your palette in your life, you would know how ridiculous that sounds,” he said. He kept looking at Harry’s curry, though, and Harry would swear he could see the debate raging inside his head. “Fine,” he said abruptly. “Half my sandwich for some curry. And I’ll take the spring roll, too, since you offered.”
you’re trying to be a gentleman about this, now of all times. I promise I’ve enjoyed myself; just come on my fucking face already!”
“You already do so much,” he murmurs. “Let me take care of you.” Taking Harry’s shoulders in both hands, he leans down a little bit to press a kiss to his forehead. He feels the remaining tension in Harry leak away as he leans into Draco’s embrace, and they hold that pose for a moment before Draco pulls back to resume his efforts. He proceeds along the length of Harry’s body in a workmanlike fashion, briefly skimming over the nipples, delivering a dispassionate brush of soap along the length of his cock without pausing to gauge his reaction. He can’t stop his own body’s response - it’s basically pavlovian when he’s on his knees in front of Harry these days, but he ignores it and focuses on completing his own task instead.
Harry’s heart stuttered. “I, uh…” he said, stalling. His mouth was suddenly dry. “I don’t think that I can answer that while we’re staring at each other like this. It’s not… it doesn’t have a nice answer like yours.”
was his home. It had certainly felt like Draco was letting him in on a secret, and the memory thrilled him still.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “So eloquent, Potter,” he said. “No wonder you’re in such demand as a public speaker.”
“Really, Potter?” Draco asked. “Everyone knows you evaluate a Thai restaurant by its Pad Thai the first time you eat there.”
make something, just out of spite, since Malfoy clearly wasn’t going to be of any help. He wandered over to the wheels that were clustered in one corner of the studio, out of the way, and picked one up.
think that, although it had certainly crossed his mind as a possibility—but Harry still couldn’t figure out why Malfoy had invited him in the first place. It was an itch under his skin, a riddle that needed solving.
“Good morning,” he said. It didn’t even come out harshly, but Harry still suspected that he was being judged for his tardiness.
Harry looked over at him, feeling conflicted. “You’re just going to stay here and keep working?” he asked.
“You have a visitor,” Draco said. He stepped aside to reveal Ron, who was looking approvingly at the office decorations.
Draco groaned. “Now it’s all coming back to me,” he said, putting a hand over his eyes. “We just ended up warding every cheap and small item in the stores that hadn’t been hit yet.”
Molly finally released him and beamed at Draco. “Well, it’s nice to see that Harry’s happy and he’s being looked after. Happy Christmas to both of you.” Draco blinked, unused to Molly’s way with hangers-on at Weasley affairs, but Harry just laughed indulgently.
Harry had also heard from his friends about personal letters that Draco had sent to them, which contained similar sentiments. Mostly these were received with wariness and some bafflement, but as time went on people in Harry’s life seemed to accept that Draco’s name would occasionally come up in conversations and it was no longer an object of scorn.
Draco hears the bathroom door close, and listens for the sound of the shower turning on. He casts a tempus charm, wincing as it informs him that it’s just gone 3 o’clock. Harry’s home a full 10 hours later; they must really have needed his help in the end. Tomorrow’s going to be bad, since Harry is still expected to start his regular shift in five hours. Draco pulls back one of the blankets on the bed since Harry always runs hot at night, then flips his pillow over and lays there as the pipes in the house make their familiar gurgling sound. It probably wouldn’t take much to go back to sleep at this point; he would just have to turn his brain back off and let his tiredness overtake him once more. On the other hand, it would be nice to wait for Harry's comforting presence beside him in bed. Harry's an efficient shower-taker, unlike Draco’s self-indulgent, luxurious affairs, so it shouldn’t be too long before Harry joins him. He stares at the ceiling, listening to the sound of running water and willing himself to stay awake for a few more minutes.
“You read that book that we risked our lives to retrieve,” Draco said. “I’ll think of a plan while you do.”
The room itself wasn’t particularly large. Various shelves situated against the walls held rows of bowls and cups and other creations, and there was a sink at one end of the room that had seen better days. There were eight students including Harry, and along with their desks, they took up the rest of the studio space.
“How did we get here, anyways?” Potter asked, looking around them. “You can’t Apparate inside Hogwarts. Hermione tells me that all the time.”
They were in a room that Draco had to assume was the Gryffindor common room this time. He had no personal experience with the other houses’ common rooms, of course, but this one featured an abundance of sofas and an enormous portrait of Godric Gryffindor on the wall above the fireplace, so Draco was pretty confident in his guess. The fireplace wasn’t actually putting out any warmth, despite how close Draco found himself standing to it; it was just one more unimportant detail to the dreamer.
Harry couldn’t figure out how he ended up on the receiving end of relationship advice from his ex-long-term girlfriend, but to his horror, her suggestion was now firmly implanted in his head; the desks at the office were the perfect height for those sorts of tension-relieving activities. His desk wouldn’t work, obviously, due to the piles of papers on it, but Draco’s had lots of available space on it. And the ministry was empty over the holiday…
Harry had his own emergencies to deal with—he kept tearing chunks out of his rim or collapsing the wall of the bowl when trying to repair the holes, and one time, he even tried to cone up too aggressively and ended up ejecting a bunch of clay right off the wheel. He still refused to raise his hand, however. It was one thing to be non-weird about Malfoy being in the same studio, helping the other students and generally not being a complete arse of a person. It was another thing entirely to contemplate waving him over and explaining that Harry was a complete and utter disaster at novice pottery skills. Harry gritted his teeth and forced himself to concentrate on yet another unblemished solid lump of clay that spun round and round in front of him. He would make a successful bowl if it was the last thing he did.
Potter huffed, annoyed. “This is the most ridiculous assignment,” he said as he gazed around them. He paused as he looked down one aisle in particular that Draco hadn’t paid any attention to. “What about that one?”
“Or the assistant is just crap at assisting,” Harry interjected. He was pretty sure that teachers weren’t supposed to tell their students that they were bad at something.
“Oh, er, I’m sure my lower extremities are fine,” Potter said quickly. “You should probably start at my head instead.”
“I do appreciate the thought, Potter,” Draco said. “I actually intended to leave my wand behind, however. I’m not sure why, but it feels strange to me to have it in there.”
“So the strokes can be quite rough right now,” Harry says. He’s aware that his distraction is slowly growing the longer the process takes. He’s desperate to break the silence between them; despite the sound of the lathe and the scrapes of his chisel against the block, it feels like there’s something dangerous in allowing it to continue indefinitely. “The lathe turns the wood so quickly that I can just slide the chisel along the length of the wood without a lot of care and it still comes out rounded afterwards.” He scrapes a series of lines along the block to demonstrate, peeling long strips of excess wood away from it.
They’re lying in bed, silently, and Draco’s the big spoon pressed up against Harry’s back. There’s a sliver of moonlight coming in through the window which paints a line across Harry’s dark shoulder and Draco’s right arm, which is wrapped around Harry. Draco’s starting to doze off again, he can feel it; it’s almost gone four in the morning at this point and he’s only human. When Harry starts to shake a little bit, though, it startles Draco out of his stupor. Then Draco hears a sniffle, and a little hiccough, and he instinctively squeezes Harry tighter.
“That’s just how I am,” Harry said. “I hate feeling like I’m wasting my time. I’m ready to go back; what’s the point of delaying?”
“With an invitation like that, how could I refuse?” Harry said. “Look at all those years of pureblood etiquette lessons paying off.”
“Git,” Harry muttered, but he found himself smiling. He chucked a ball of paper at Draco just for the spirit of the thing.
In what Draco takes to be an encouraging sign, Harry nods and reaches out to turn off the shower faucet. They both stand there dripping for a moment before Draco says, “So, did you happen to grab a fresh towel before getting in here? Because I put yours in the wash earlier.”
“Merlin,” Weasley said. “That’s too wild.” He stared at Potter’s slumbering form as the man’s chest rose and fell for a few breaths. “Alright,” he decided. “It sounds weird, but I’m sure you know what you’re doing.” He gave Draco a nervous glance. “You do, don’t you? You must, if they let you work here.”
“I know what I’m going to do,” Harry said, unconcerned. “You can make your own choices.” He opened the bottle and sniffed the contents, then poured a generous measure of the amber liquid into his mug as Draco watched. Without breaking eye contact, Harry took a small sip, then smacked his lips appreciatively as he swallowed, feeling the drink draw a warm line down the inside of his chest. “That’s quite nice,” he said.
The final stage of the wand creation process involves the fine detailing work on the surface of the wand. There is more to this than mere aesthetics; the grooves help shape the flow of the magic over its surface, and a poorly detailed wand will make it harder for the caster to direct their spells. Unfortunately, this also means that Draco’s Veela power must be present in the detailing as well, otherwise the same interference will reoccur when he attempts to cast with it. Harry detaches the wand from the clamp; he stalls for time by looking carefully at it, rolling the wand over in his palm and searching for imperfections in its surface.
Potter’s gaze travelled up and down Draco’s body in an open appraisal that made Draco’s mouth go dry.
“It seems that back in the 1600s there was a Malfoy who was a bit of a wild sort,” Malfoy says, now trailing his fingers along Harry’s lathe. “He married a woman who was half-Veela, and he was nearly disowned before his new wife demonstrated her value to their social standing through intimate dinner parties.” He glanced at Harry, his mouth turning up at the corners. “Probably nothing sordid, mind you. It just turns out it’s easier to be a socialite if everyone who comes in contact with you is naturally disposed to want to… please you.”
It was worse than Harry feared. After the first morning of staring at beautiful but inscrutable words on parchment, Draco had tried to find someone from Evidence to help them decipher the contents of the paperwork. Unfortunately, the department two floors below theirs appeared to be a ghost town; all the employees had cleaned out their inboxes and taken off for early holidays.
“You should probably check on the wand,” Draco says, and he sounds subdued. Harry checks over his shoulder again and sees Draco has moved back against the wall, arms crossed. Whether it’s the difference of the extra few steps, or the lack of physical contact, or something else entirely, Harry finds it easier to think now.
Something changed in Malfoy’s face; Harry wasn’t sure if he could pinpoint it, but the silence between them abruptly felt charged. Malfoy leaned a little bit closer, and Harry felt like he was being pulled towards him.
“Yeah, who’d ever think that?” Ron asked. “What a loon. She obviously doesn’t listen to you on pub nights.”
Harry turned back to Ron. “Sorry, mate,” he said apologetically. “You know I’d love to, but I can’t bring myself to leave Draco here. It’s too depressing to work here alone over Christmas.”
Potter yelped as he presumably made contact with the book once more. “I’ve got it,” he said, sounding exasperated. “
Malfoy’s hand darted out, and he laid it lightly on Harry’s wrist before Harry could snatch his hand back from the wheel. “Allow your fingers to explore,” he said intently. “Get to know the shape of the clay before you start working it.”
“Your way with words never fails to astound me, Potter,” Malfoy said drily. “‘That’s nice,’ when I’ve just bared all my secrets to you.”
“This is Draco Malfoy,” he said curtly. He consciously reminded himself to moderate his tone; he may be disappointed by how the interaction with Potter concluded, but it wasn’t something he needed to take out on others.
“Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it?” he hazarded. “I think the castle is looking out for us.”
Taking matters into his own hands, when Draco wasn’t looking Harry cast a wordless levitation charm on the box that his partner was using to store his belongings. Harry quickly guided the box over to his own desk and hid it in the space where his legs would typically go. This forced him to sit further back from his desk than he usually would, but that was a small price to pay for victory. He resumed his paperwork, listening impatiently for Draco to notice the missing box.
Harry swallowed. Contemplating revealing the truth of why he had to see a therapist was certainly easier without having to look into Malfoy’s eyes while doing it, but knowing that Malfoy was standing behind him… there was a tension in the air. He wasn’t sure how far away Malfoy was actually standing—he could be right behind Harry, barely not touching him, and Harry would have no way of knowing. He shivered.
“But we work so well together!” Harry blurted. “It just feels right, you know? We complement each other.”
Draco gave Potter a lascivious smile, refusing to break eye contact as he moved his mouth steadily closer to the head of Potter’s cock. The other man’s breath quickened until Draco was vaguely concerned that he might hyperventilate. Draco darted out his tongue, licking just under the tip and around the glans. Potter groaned, long and drawn out.
The image that conjured in Harry’s head was far, far more unprofessional than the previous ones he had been concerned about, and Harry swallowed. “Er,” he said, attempting to get a grip on himself. “Yeah, I’d reckon. Should we be getting back, then?”
Potter stared at him for a moment. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he finally said, frostily. “But I think you should leave now.” A swift rapping at the office door dragged his attention away from Draco. “Ah, that will be Ginny,” he said, getting up from his chair and striding over to the door. “Please don’t let me keep you.”
Harry’s heart immediately began to hammer. Had Draco noticed his unprofessional glances? Was this going to be one of those conversations where he would try to let Harry down gently? Was he making Draco uncomfortable? Or… maybe Draco had noticed the glances, and this would be one of those conversations where they sorted out how they felt about each other and what it meant?
“Merlin,” Malfoy said, sounding vaguely annoyed. “I swear, if you ruin the one activity I enjoy… No, I was
“That’s a challenge for you to overcome,” Malfoy said lightly. “Before we go on, I just want to make clear—if at any point you don’t feel like answering my questions, like you’ve had enough of my… unusual methods, all you need to do is turn off your wheel.”
Hermione pursed her lips but didn’t pursue the argument. The silence hung between them for a moment before Harry relented.
“His head was laying next to his computery thingy,” Weasley offered. “That thing with all the letters on it; I can never remember the names. I don’t use the things myself. George is keen to hook us up to this new WixNet thing, but we’ve got along fine by owl post as long as I’ve been alive. Don’t see what the fuss is all about, really.”
Draco’s heart sank. Trust Potter to make the connection immediately. “Oh?” he asked, feigning nonchalance. “Really?”
Harry tried very hard to ignore Draco’s pacing and muttered spells over the next few minutes as he frantically filled out forms. Every so often there would be a short, sharp sensation as Draco would attempt a new way of burrowing through his shield. Harry was glad they were in such a small room; it meant that the usual technique of simply bombarding a shield until it collapsed would risk damaging the rest of the office, a fact which worked in Harry’s favour.
“I just transferred to Evidence last month,” she said, “And they told me to keep an eye on the archives to make sure that no keen-eyed Aurors come in and mess up the filing system.” She eyed them shrewdly. “So no, I wouldn’t say so.”
“Yes, well, perhaps a high-profile victim could make a compelling argument for some reform,” Draco said. “Do think on it; I’m sure the press would love to hear your story, Potter.” He ran his gaze across Potter, checking for any other visible signs of injury. Potter’s cheeks flushed again under his scrutiny, which was… well, gratifying. He could admit that in the privacy of his own head. “In any case, you seem to be out of immediate danger, and no longer require my particular skills. I will leave you in the capable hands of my colleague, Healer Jenkins.”
“For a moment…” Draco says, looking back at the wand. “It felt different. But it just feels like the rest now.”
A small frown appeared on Draco’s face. “Well, if you insist,” he said. “But I still need to clean out my desk, since I don’t plan on coming back.” He looked at Harry’s stack consideringly, then back at Harry. “Race you?” he asked slyly.
, Harry mouthed mockingly at Malfoy as soon as he wasn’t looking at him any longer. There was nothing keeping him at the studio; he could leave any time he wanted. But Harry decided that he
“Oh,” Harry said, rubbing his eyes as he adjusted to the solidity and brightness of the non-memory world. “Yeah, this was all Draco. It makes today kind of bearable.”
Harry supposed he should actually reply. It was an invitation, even if Malfoy hadn’t even made eye contact or looked in his general direction while issuing it. “Why?” he asked bluntly. “I’m crap at this. You want me to give you a private show?”
Harry was twenty-five minutes into failing to make his first bowl when he heard the studio door open and a half-familiar voice said “Sorry I’m late.”
With a yawn, Draco pushes back the covers and pads down the hallway to the closed bathroom door. The shower is still the only sound he can hear, and Draco has visions of Harry asleep, or maybe even passed out under the falling water. He knocks on the door and calls “Harry?” quietly. There’s no response.
“Your hair,” Harry says. He feels like he’s trying to convince himself, as he finds himself running his fingers up along the shaved part of Draco’s head. Draco purrs as Harry’s hypersensitive palm makes contact with the short, bristly hairs, and Harry’s knees just about give way at the sensation. He forces his hand to continue up into the longer hair on top of Draco’s head.
“Harry, I will do anything you want,” Draco says quickly, and Harry’s hindbrain lights up at this. He tries to pin Draco to the wall, but Draco sidles neatly out of his reach. “But only if you finish the wand first!”
“Potter,” Draco said. “I hope your long nap was refreshing. You’re in St. Mungo’s; there’s no need to be alarmed. I was asked to perform a special legilimency operation for you.”
Harry decided to lead with the least incriminating fact. “You left your—” he began, then looked around quickly. He didn’t
“Actually, I want to try something different,” Harry says. He walks over to his bench and pulls out what he calls his test wand—instead of a permanent core, it’s got a removable panel he can use to insert different materials into it if he wants to quickly check the efficacy of a particular one with a spell caster. “I’ll need one of your hairs.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Do you want me to guess how that sentence ends, Potter?” he asked wryly. “Because I can imagine a lot of different ways that could go.”
“Slughorn said it would be obvious,” Draco said. This plan would only work if Potter were the one to find the substitute for his missing memories. “See if anything catches your eye.”
“Are you sure?” Draco asked calmly. “I am quite certain that you are supposed to teach Potions this term. My son says you have missed every class, and it’s nearly the end of term.”
Just like that, the old Malfoy is back. He gives Harry a smirk. “No promises,” he says, and Harry’s knuckles turn white with how tightly he grips the desk behind him.
like a perfectly serviceable wand—made from aspen, with some of his best surface etchings to date, and a core built on strands from the tail of a Hogwarts Thestral, but when he holds it it just feels inert. Lifeless. Like a block of wood with some hair trapped inside of it. It’s the latest in a series of wands he’s made while attempting to broaden his repertoire of techniques and materials, but it doesn’t feel like he’s making much progress.
“The same Robards who kept insisting that there was no room in the budget for any overtime?” Draco asked drily. “Yes, I’m sure he’ll be very responsive to that request.”
Harry had been prepared for mocking, or maybe even something like “don’t be bad at it”. He wasn’t expecting metaphysical questions. “What?”
“You go ahead and get into bed,” Draco says briskly when they’re both more or less dry. “I’ll deal with your robes.”
Continuing his ministrations to Potter’s dick, Draco took the opportunity to sneak a glance around them. The outlook was... not good, he decided. He couldn’t see what was happening behind him, but the cloud of darkness appeared to have cut off any potential exit behind Potter’s back. The bed they were using would eventually be isolated from everything, one small point of light in a sea of darkness; tendrils were already sneaking along the floor towards the legs of the bed.
“Well, you’re lucky that I took notes today, in that case,” Draco said. He liked the direction this was heading. Potter was actually responding to the power of dream suggestion for once. “Maybe I’ll let you see them if you actually do what I say.”
“Slytherin?” Potter asked. “Oh no, he runs in a pack with his housemates. The Gryffindor Gang, they’re called.”
Taking a moment to compose himself, Harry turns back around to face Malfoy. “Even if you’re not a Veela, you're still doing whatever it is that Veelas do, so it amounts to the same thing,” he says, more calmly than he feels. It’s like being in the eye of the storm, knowing that whatever he was just experiencing could reappear at any moment.
“All the better for us,” Draco said, chivvying Potter ahead of him into the main room. “That way there are fewer suspicious glances as we try to find the book we need.”
going on, then, Malfoy?” he asked, and it came out low and a bit dangerous. “I know you’re keeping secrets from me. Tell me what’s happening, or I’m leaving.”
“Thank you,” Draco said, performing a stiff but respectful bow with his head. “It is gracious of you to include me.”
“That’s perfect,” Draco said, joining Harry on the bed. He knelt just behind him, not quite touching any part of the other man’s body. He reached out and trailed a finger down Potter’s neck, tracing the line of a shoulder blade. Potter’s breath caught, and his body responded to the touch, arching towards it.
Draco sighed. He had no plan, no idea of what to do, so he resorted to the truth. “You’re right,” he said. “You are dreaming. Not only that, but you’re actually trapped inside this dream. Your body is in St. Mungo’s and I’m trying to wake you up through legilimency.”
“Well then,” Harry says, and attempts to head off whatever is passing between them by walking over to his blocks of rough wood and considering them. “You should be happy to learn that all you need is a new wand that won’t get tangled up in your new Veela powers.”
Harry only missed two and a half hours of last year’s; he came home grumbling about how the on-call healer would have handled it fine. They had only called him in because it was the wife of a big donor who was giving birth and the St. Mungo’s administrators got cold feet. He and Harry had ended up ordering take-away from the Indian place at the bottom of the street, since it had been late enough that Draco didn’t really feel like starting to make dinner at that point.
They made their way over to the bed, Draco trying not to let on how nervous he suddenly felt. He told himself that it shouldn’t feel any different than picking someone up at a club. It was a transaction; they both knew what they were getting out of this. That Draco had always felt a certain attraction to Potter shouldn’t make a difference. If anything, it should have made the whole thing that much better.
“No, I don’t need help with the assignment,” Draco replied. He took a seat in the chair that sat on the other side of Potter’s desk as he gave himself time to think. Potter left his doorway and came and sat across from him. Draco decided to go for the most likely avenue for shocking a professor, in hopes that they would be kicked out of this dream as quickly as possible. “It’s about my son. He’s a student in one of your classes. Potions, actually.” He smiled to himself at the notion of Potter teaching Potions. What an absurd concept.
. “And I found Pansy along the way and had a chance to make my displeasure with her clear. Have you successfully reassured your family that I’m not holding you hostage at the Ministry?”
“That’s right,” Blaise said easily, even though there was no way he could have any idea what they were talking about given the noise levels in the pub. “It’s enormous. Women love it, men fear it. Hello there, Harry! Thank you for keeping Ginevra out of trouble.” He sat down in the space that Ginny had just vacated and gave the side of her head a kiss; she punched him gently on the arm.
Surprisingly, Potter actually transferred the book he was holding to his other hand that was gripping the ladder, awkwardly stretching his now-free hand down towards Draco. Draco reached up to grab it, and found that Potter’s grip was strong; their palms fit together perfectly, like pieces of a puzzle. He didn’t allow himself any more time to consider the matter, however. “Now, we jump,” Draco commanded, and he stepped off the tall ladder, dragging a shocked Potter with him.
“Ronald!” Molly said, turning her attention away from Harry and Draco in order to point an accusatory finger. “Don’t you dare touch anything! I’ve counted, so I’ll notice if any go missing!”
