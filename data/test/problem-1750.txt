“I won’t moan for him,” Harry says. “We’re just friends.”
And now it’s time for Harry to just agree so he utters an okay. He gets it. He wants to find Pettigrew too and hurt him for all he’s done to this family. “We’ll do it together,” he says.
“But we had lessons in first year,” Harry says. “Everyone learnt to fly in first year.”
Well, I’m sure you will understand that Draco’s father wasn’t all too happy about that. That afternoon Draco got a very long letter from his father. It went on and on about how Draco was ruining the Malfoy name and that he should be ashamed of himself for showing these feelings to the world. He should know by now that even though he might think he loves me, that he will marry a good pureblood girl one day to continue the Malfoy name. Draco was really upset about the letter. He still pretends he doesn’t care what his father thinks of him and that he hates the man. But I can see that it’s hurting him when his father talks to him like he’s the biggest disappointment ever.
At that moment Headmaster Dumbledore walked in and Draco started to beg him to bring him his wand. But the headmaster also didn’t listen to him and he just ordered professor Snape, the Minister and even madam Pomfrey to leave. He wanted to have a word with me and Hermione. I tried to explain to him that Black was innocent but he just hold up his hand and I stopped talking. He said we could still save Sirius tonight, that our word wouldn’t be enough, but that we could save him if we just had a little more time and that three turns should be enough. Hermione nodded like she understood what Dumbledore was talking about. He wanted to say more but Draco interrupted him, saying there was more than just our words to support that Black is innocent. The headmaster asked Draco what this was and Draco explains how he started a recording spell with his wand. That the entire conversation with Peter Pettigrew is stored on his wand.
“There was an old memory of him in that diary,” Harry says when Draco falls silent. Draco had never seen his father in that state. It was the first time he’d witnessed the Dark Lord’s anger and his twisted mind.
It was after his father got arrested that Draco got his wish. The Dark Lord offered him a place at his table, marked him as one of his own and gave him a special mission. Draco was to kill Dumbledore, the most powerful wizard alive.
“Uncle Remus, I need to,” Harry starts. He tries to step back again, out of Remus’ hold.
Draco and I also visited Hagrid this weekend. He was all dressed up and even tried to tame his hair. Draco joked later that maybe I should go over more often and maybe try to braid Hagrid’s hair into something decent. I told him my braiding skills were only for him and that resulted in a nice kissing match. But back to Hagrid. The Skrewts had started to kill each other and for a moment Draco was hoping we’d be done with them. But Hagrid had put them in separate boxes, so there still like twenty of them. Hagrid made us some lunch and we had a good time catching up with him. When we left his cabin, Madame Maxime (the headmistress of Beauxbatons) passed by and Hagrid was blushing. He looked at her like he looked at his baby dragon and it’s clear that he’s smitten.
“Fine, I won’t snug Hermione all the time anymore when you’re around,” Ron shouts from behind them. “Just take your tongue out of the Ferret and let me apologise. And Ferret, I hope you like chess, because we are playing tomorrow as I have to be your friend now.”
“I told the principal that I’m taking time off after this week,” Harry says.
“Draco didn’t leave you, did he?” Ron asks. Draco bites his lips. Of course that is the first thing on Ron’s mind when Harry looks like shit. Draco most have done something wrong, something to hurt his best friend. And he’s not wrong. Draco gave Harry the one thing he wants more than anything, only to destroy it a couple of weeks later.
After another while, I decided that since I would already get expelled I would just use some more magic to bewitch the trunk to make it feather-light. That way I could tie it to my broomstick, cover myself with the invisibility cloak and then fly to London to get my money from Gringotts and start my life as an outcast. I opened my trunk to look for the cloak when I felt like someone was watching me. I looked at the black alleyway behind me, even used a Lumos to see it better. And that is when I saw it, a hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. It scared me to death. I stepped backwards, I hit my trunk and tripped. My wand slipped out of my hand and then there was this massive bang sound and I was surrounded by blinding lights.
I did get my Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map back. Sirius convinced Professor Lupin that they belong to me, that you, dad, would have wanted me to have them. I did have to promise Sirius I won’t use them if it could put me in danger. But I could do all the pranks I want with them, saying you would be proud of me dad for not following school rules. I get the feeling you and Sirius were up to no good more often than not and I look forward to learning more and more about you and mom from Sirius.
“What’s wrong with you?” Iris asks as she sits down next to him.
Harry doesn’t hear what Ron says in response. His ears are ringing as the words of Hermione plant themselves in his brain. There is no way Malfoy hasn’t heard them, just like everyone around. Tomorrow it will be in the papers how the ‘boy who lived’ has the hots for his nemesis, the Malfoy heir. Tomorrow the entire wizarding world will know he’s gay.
The first day back to class was hard. It seems like everyone knows what I did and Nott and Crabbe make fun of it every chance they get. Draco told them to shut up, but they don’t really listen to him. I told him it’s okay, but Draco gets upset when people talk about what I did. I think I scared him and I feel bad about that. I never thought he would care about what happened to me. I hate that his father had forbidden him from even looking at me the wrong way.
Back in my room I first went for my trunk to put on some clean clothes, only to discover that someone had rummaged through it. I sat down on the ground in front of it for a long time. They were gone, my notebook and the cloak. I couldn’t believe it. Not only had they beaten me half to death, they also took the only things that mattered to me. Right then I wished they really had beaten me to death. At least then it wouldn’t all hurt so much anymore.
You wouldn’t believe the relief that washed over me when Draco knelt beside me and took me in his arms. I grabbed his hand and won’t let go of him. I didn’t know how to speak, to tell him how sorry I was for almost leaving him forever. I won’t repeat everything he already told you yesterday. Just know that I was shaken and scared, but also happy to be back with the people I love. Sirius and Draco made sure I got to the hospital wing. The supposed Professor Moody was with us. He questioned me. When Sirius and Draco both fell asleep, I knew something was wrong. And then Professor Moody called Voldemort the Dark Lord. And I remembered that Voldemort had said he had a spy at Hogwarts, one that had put my name in the goblet of fire.
“What do you mean?” Harry asks. “Why wouldn’t he?”
Draco does his silent chuckle. The corners of his mouth lift for a second and his eyes drop a little. Then he looks back at Harry. “I’m sure you did fine,” he signs.
“Harry, you want us to take you to the hospital wing?” Neville asks. He pushes Harry upright and looks at him with a weak smile. Harry should say something. He should move and go on with his life. Only he doesn’t know if he can.
Another two weeks pass. Harry keeps up with the notes. They are in Divination when Malfoy crumbles up one of Harry’s notes and throws it back to Harry. Harry opens it, but Malfoy hasn’t written down an answer to his offer to teach him sign language.
Draco shakes his head and pushes his parchment to Harry. This was too much, too difficult for Draco to follow. So Harry writes down what he just told him.
“She has to,” Harry says.
It’s then that Professor Lockhart spoke up, saying that it seemed that he wasn’t needed. I had completely forgotten about him. Ron turned towards him and pointed his wand at him, saying Lockhart could go first. He protested, but we had both our wands pointed at him, so he hadn’t a real choice.
Harry shakes his head and walks out of the room. He takes the stairs and makes it to the beach. There is only one other person out this early. A young woman walks with a baby in her arms up and down the coast. Harry stares at her. His chest aches and his vision blurs as tears start to form. Fuck, he thought he was doing better. At least Draco isn’t here to see it. He needs Harry to be strong for both of them, keep them standing in the middle of this shit storm.
“Yes, we can start with the basics this holiday,” Hermione says while she pats Ron on his head. Ginny laughs until Hermione looks at her and she realises that she will have to start with a BSL crash course too and she groans.
“I’m fine, Teddy. Just a little stomach bug,” Draco lies. He’s pretty sure this isn’t a stomach bug, more a ‘you’ll be feeling like this for the next eight months or so and by the end, you wished you started those birth control potions sooner’ bug. But it had taken three years after Lily before Draco even got pregnant again. How was he supposed to know his body suddenly figured out how to fall pregnant within a heartbeat?
“No, but I think dad is already on his way,” Neville says. “He’ll be here shortly. You know how he is.”
Hermione opens her mouth to say that the creatures don’t exist, but Ron stops her by placing his hand on her mouth. “That’s great, Luna. I hope you will spot one too,” he says. Then he throws a small piece of parchment at Draco to get him to look up from his essay. “What are your plans for Christmas?” Ron asks.
Friday 1 April 1994
Harry places his arm around Hermione. “It won’t. He likes you too, you know. It’s why he was so upset you went to the bale with Krum.”
Harry James Potter
“It’s probably a Slytherin, nicely tucked away in the dungeons, like a real vampire,” Harry concludes.
“I pushed Pansy away, Blaise and Greg. If it hadn’t been for me, they would have never been on the wrong side of the war.”
Harry laughs. He never thought about it like that. But yes, he will be part of a minority when he comes out. And Hermione does love to stand up for good causes when it comes to minority groups. “I should tell them,” he says. “But not now. I just want to have a fun day out.”
“We’ve got the champagne,” Seamus shouts as he follows Draco into the living room. He starts to hand out glasses and rushes everyone to gather. Harry slips his arm around Draco’s waist while he holds out his glass for Draco to fill with the champagne.
“But what I was about to say. I’m here to ask a favour from all of you. As you might have heard, as nothing ever stays a secret in this school, our champions will have to retrieve something from the Great Lake tomorrow. These somethings are the person that they will miss the most,” Dumbledore explains.
Harry reads the sentence and then shows Draco how to say it. Draco repeats the movement and then nods. He gets it. They both smile at each other. Only Harry’s smile drops as the question sinks in.
Neville and Harry look at each other. “We have no clue,” Neville says. “That’s the whole problem.”
We slowly walked down to the dungeons. I told Draco about what was said in the small room, about what Moody had said, that maybe someone put my name in to get me killed. I mentioned my dream from last summer wherein I’d heard Voldemort plotting my death. Draco stayed silent next to me, he just held my hand while I talked.
Harry treads down the stairs and picks his wallet and keys from the little bowl next to the front door. Draco left his key at the bottom of the bowl. Just the key. He took the fluffy key chain that used to decorate it. A gift from Harry when they just started dating. Harry doesn’t know what he should think of that. He left all the pictures, the furniture they bought together. He only took his clothes, his expensive food and the stupid key chain. Won at a fair. When they still remembered how to have fun together.
Harry just smiles and grabs some toast. Ron called Draco their friend. It’s official now. He’s part of the gang. And that’s the best feeling ever.
“James Scorpius will work,” Draco says. Not that it matters. That boy of their dreams is long gone, taken away before he even had the chance to live.
“Non non,” Nathan babbles.
The kitchen door opens again, and Harry walks in. “What is taking you all so long. Seamus is about to explode, afraid he won’t get his glass of champagne in time for the count down.”
Draco was proud of me for not bringing it up. We talked a little about it, how it would be like if one of your friends would betray you like that. What if Hermione or Blaise would do that to us? I would be so hurt. So I think I won’t bother Professor Lupin with it, it’s obvious he’s still hurting because of it.
“He doesn’t like me,” Draco signs when the others stare at him in disbelief.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says.
“No, I’ll be fine,” Draco tells them. He just needs to get out of here. It would have been better if the Aurors would come to arrest Draco. Then he wouldn’t have to face the Dark Lord in a couple of days and hope his occlumency holds up. Draco walks out of the Great Hall and lets his feet guide him up the stairs. One foot in front of the other. Silently. On his way to the spot that was once theirs. The place where he and Harry could share their hopes and fears. Where Draco could just be himself.
Harry doesn’t know if Malfoy has any friends. He always seems to be alone. But now that Harry is his friend, Ron, Neville and Hermione will soon follow. They will get along with Malfoy. And Ron and Hermione will learn. Harry doesn’t doubt that.
Nobody complains when Draco doesn’t want to go to Hogsmeade but prefers to spend the day in with Harry. They kiss and wander around the castle. In the evening they stroll around the lake and Harry’s heart burst again when Draco tells him he loves him.
“We’ll get through this,” Harry says. “We’ve fought so many battles together and came out stronger. We can beat this too.”
And that is how my dance lessons started. First just in our dormitory because I didn’t want anyone to see me struggling to get my two left feed doing the right steps. Draco took it on him to figure out what kind of dance the first dance would be, so we could start with learning the steps of that one. I have no idea anymore how it was called, just that it took me forever to get it right. After the first week of practising, Draco said it would be better if he would be the lead during the dance, that it was easier to follow. And he was right, we switched roles and everything seemed so much simpler. And we nailed it during the ball. We were on the front page of the Prophet the day after, dancing and smiling at each other. I cut out the picture and put it up next to our bed.
They are both quiet after that. Harry stares at his hands. They are clasped on his lap, just as Draco’s hands when Harry just woke up.
The Dementor is right in front of them and Harry’s insides freeze. He shivers and looks up at the empty hole where the Dementor’s face should be. “We’ve done nothing wrong,” Harry says. A faint scream echoes in his head. His mother’s screams from long ago. The agony she went through when Bellatrix Lestrange tried to torture her to death after Voldemort had gone. Harry blinks away a tear. He hasn’t remembered that night in ages. The nightmares about it left him before he could properly remember. Only to return now, as if it happened yesterday.
‘I want to,’ Harry pens down. ‘The weekend after the game we can go out to the field and I’ll show you what it feels like to fly.’
“Of course, he does,” James says. “But does Ginny fancy him? I know she worshipped him for years, but I feel she stopped doing that some time ago.”
“What is his name?” Draco asks.
The next thing I know is waking up here in the hospital wing, Draco next to me, his trembling hand in mine. Marcus, Adrian en Miles from the team were also there, just like Hermione, Blaise, Greg and Daphne. I fainted again and had fallen to the ground. If the headmaster hadn’t slowed down my fall I might have died. Draco won’t leave my side at the moment. Even Madam Pomfrey has given up on trying to make him leave. He slept here with me last night. He had another nightmare about me dying. He’s really shaken up. I haven’t told him that I also saw the Grim, I think it would only upset him more.
“Yeah, who are you looking for?” Harry asks. He pulls his bag up from the floor and searches for the map.
“Mr Malfoy, could we have a word?” Lily asks before they are out of earshot. Harry could hug his mum. She’s amazing and Harry will do whatever she wants him to all summer if she will be able to give him the possibility to properly say goodbye to Draco.
* * *
“You and Neville keep saying that, but you won’t explain,” Hermione says. “What ways does he have?”
Their lips meet and Harry forgets all about London. That night he dreams of Draco’s hand on his, of the promise to spend the next night together on the astronomy tower. The night will be special. Draco promised. Something about the new moon and how much brighter the stars will be. What Harry didn’t expect is to find a blanket surrounded by flying candles. Pillows soft and comfortable to sit upon, a picnic basket filled with fruits and snacks. Draco holds his hand and caresses his neck.
‘I’ve never known them, so I don’t miss them,’ Malfoy writes. He bites on his bottom lip again. Harry finds it cute when Malfoy does that. It causes all these weird feelings inside Harry’s stomach that Harry doesn’t know what to do with.
And yes, I haven’t been sleeping all that well. I keep having dreams of Draco walking away from me and then falling over the castle walls. I run to the edge and when I look over the bannister he’s gone. I don’t know what it means, or why I keep having this dream, but it wakes me up sweating all the time. After that, I never can get back to sleep. I just stare at Draco’s drapes, hoping he’s still sleeping behind them. And I want to open his drapes and crawl into bed with him. Just to hold him and make sure he’s really there. I know it’s stupid since it’s clear he doesn’t care about me.
“Oh, no, don’t tell me that was the Malfoy boy,” James says.
Harry shakes his head. He knows that Iris will be fine. She’s an independent girl. And too smart for her own good. But this year is different. There is a real treat now. It’s not the same as first year when the enemy was close but unable to touch them. And it’s different from last year when the Basilisk terrorised the school. No, this year, Neville, Harry and Iris are the targets. The reason why the enemy is here. And no matter how smart or clever Iris is, she is an idiot when it comes to understanding the danger she’s in.
Harry James Potter.
“Sure,” Harry agrees.
A distraction sounds good. Harry nods his agreement. He would do anything to forget about the pain inside of him.
Draco's eyes open and Harry takes his face in his hands before he can turn away.
“Draco, I know you’re struggling. You’ve been sick this entire pregnancy. Not to say your emotional state. We all want you to be okay, so let's make sure you will be after our little third miracle is born. We’ll have four beautiful children and I want to enjoy them with you, not just by myself.”
“Keep you silly gift to yourself. I don’t need them and I don’t want them,” Harry shouts.
“Draco,” a hesitant Harry says from the doorway. “What happened?”
There was a boy that was sentenced for the same crime. He begged Mr Crouch to believe he didn’t do it. He called Mr Crouch his father. But this didn’t stop Mr Crouch to sentence him to Azkaban for the rest of his life.
Harry almost laughs. He has no clue how to dance. But it’s too late to tell anyone that now or try to find someone who can teach him. Malfoy will have a good laugh when he sees Harry struggle to not step on his date’s feet all the time. Harry is sure that Malfoy is an excellent dancer. Parkinson will be flying over the dance floor all evening.
Harry looks at his hands that still hold his lemonade glass. The drink hardly touched. “I don’t think he wants to date me,” he says. Tears build up in the corner of Harry’s eyes. He tries to blink them away. He’s shed enough tears over Draco.
Draco shakes his head. “A great friend he was. He is one of the Dark Lord’s followers.”
* * *
Harry leans into his dad a little more. “I hate that he doesn’t know that I miss him,” he says.
Draco shakes his head. He can't show Harry his pain. He'll stop, and that can't happen.
He must have drifted off at some point, because it’s way too soon for Harry to be back in their room, showered and dressed and ready to start the day. Harry opens the curtains and Draco groans.
* * *
“As you should be. You gave him purpose,” the Dark Lord says. He stops in front of Draco. His finger pushes Draco’s chin up. Draco has no choice but to look into the red eyes of the man he hates. “Now, show me how you killed him,” he says.
Cho stands next to Cedric now, looking in love and happy. Harry thinks he should feel something about it. But the trued is, he doesn’t care. He’s glad that Cho is happy with Cedric. She would have been miserable if she would have to go with Harry. Harry is nothing like Cedric. He’s just a small little boy, with hair that never wants to stay in line and an ugly scar on his face. He will never be as handsome as Cedric, with his long legs and his dazzling smile.
Before the exams started Hermione was unbearable. She had much more studying to do then me and Draco and we were already struggling to cramp everything we learnt this year into our heads. And her exam schedule made no sense, even though she said she’s been to all her exams so far. I got a glimpse of it last weekend and it said she had two exams at 9 on Monday and two at 1. I asked how she was going to sit for two exams at once, but she didn’t want to answer. Draco told me to leave it. He was getting annoyed with everything because he was afraid he would fail his exams. I know he wants to do good to impress his father. He says he doesn’t care about what his father thinks, but I know that’s not true. Even though they hate each other at the moment, he’s still his father.
“Yeah,” Harry confirms as he stops in front of Draco. “I thought it was appropriate, as I’m about to kiss you.”
Ron pats Harry on his back. “Yeah, that didn’t convince anyone that you’re going to drop this,” he says.
“What are you on about?” Ron asks.
Love you both.
“You still jealous?” Hermione asks.
Harry turns away from Neville and spots his wand. He runs towards it and ducks to grab it. Behind him, he hears Pettigrew shout Avada Kedavra. Harry’s breath gets stuck in his lungs until a bright green light flashes against the books above him. Harry turns and is ready to jinx Pettigrew. Only Harry can’t. The only thing he sees is Neville laying on the floor. Is he dead? Did Pettigrew get out two killing curses? Harry only heard the one Avada Kedavra. Neville can’t be dead, can he?
“Bloody Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry says. “That you haven’t lost it until now is a miracle.” He again moves his hand along with his words and Malfoy watches them move. His grey eyes glitter a little. Harry wonders if it’s because of the tears that had fallen from them just now, or if it’s because Malfoy is fascinated with the way Harry tries to communicate with him.
Teddy agrees and takes Draco’s hand. Together they walk back to Teddy’s bedroom where Draco tucks the boy into bed. He kisses him on the forehead before he leaves the room. Harry is right about one thing, Teddy is their boy, no matter who his birth parents are, and Draco would do anything in his power to make sure he knows he’s loved and safe.
By Wednesday Malfoy started to call me Scarface all the time. He joked that the lighting scar was the only pretty thing about me. Since I have horrible black hair that looks like a raven landed on my head. And my eyes are so poor that it’s a shame the glasses don’t hide them any better from view.
When the clapping had died down a little, headmaster Dumbledore started a small speech, only to be interrupted by the stupid goblet that can’t count or something. Its flames had turned red again and another parchment came flying out of it. The headmaster seized the parchment and stared at it for a long time. And then my life turned into a nightmare again when he uttered the words ‘Harry Potter.’
Draco looks at his mother. She sits up straight. Her head held high. She never shows any fear. Not around others. But Draco knows better. His mother is scared. Just as scared as Draco. Scared of the antics of a Lord with an unpredictable temper. His anger is deathly. And there is no hiding from it. Not in this house. Not now the one promised to defeat him is dead.
Draco’s face splits into a smile. Harry lightly shakes his head and grins at Draco. Neville is safe. Draco made sure he wouldn’t go after Pettigrew alone. And he cast a spell successfully. He’s brilliant. And so fucking beautiful. And Harry loves him.
“I know this is not the news you wanted to hear, and I will answer all your questions. But let's let Draco put his clothes back on first, make it a little more comfortable for him.” Draco doesn’t know how this can get more comfortable. His heart has just shattered into a million pieces, and there is nothing that will make this comfortable, not even some stupid clothes.
Neville sits down next to him. “Maybe you should go and write out everything the teachers say and hand those notes to him,” he says.
“Please speak up,” Shacklebolt says.
Professor McGonagall left me alone in the headmaster’s office and I was sure I was going to get expelled. What else could they do? Everyone was certain that I was the one behind all the attacks. And now, I was again found on the scene of the crime. After just standing there, looking at all the amazing things in the headmaster’s office I heard a strange, gagging noise behind me. I turned out I wasn’t alone in the office. Headmaster Dumbledore has a bird, a very special bird, but I didn’t know that at first. So I yelled when the ill-looking bird burst into flames. And then the headmaster stepped into the room. I gasped, that there had been nothing I could have done. But headmaster Dumbledore just smiled and said that it was okay. Fawkes is a phoenix, and they burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. We watched together until a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird pokes its head out of the ashes. Headmaster Dumbledore assured me that he is normally a very handsome bird, with wonderful red and gold plumage. He also explained that they can carry immensely heavy loads and their tears have hailing powers.
A healer goes over the wounds on all the victims. Harry tries not to listen to the words spoken. He can’t stand to hear in even more detail how Draco had suffered in his final days.
“I love you too,” Draco answers. He lets his weight drop against Harry’s body, rests his head on his shoulder. Harry places his arms around Draco and hugs him. It helps a little with chasing away the demons in Draco’s head. But they won’t disappear, they keep nagging at the edge of his mind.
“You want to kill us too?” she shouts.
Talking about Quidditch. You remember me telling you that Draco was fighting with his hair the entire match. Well, Daphne showed me how to make a French Braid around the sides of his head so the shorter hairs won’t pull out of the ponytail so easily. And ever since then I’ve been braiding Draco’s hair every morning. First, it was just to practice, so it will be perfect by the time we have to play our next match. But now it’s more because I like doing it, and Draco loves it when I touch his hair and brush my fingers lightly over his head. Daphne says it’s sweet and Greg just thinks it’s a weird gay thing he will never understand.
Harry doesn’t hesitate and runs down the stairs. He turns to his left and then stops in his tracks. Draco stands in the middle of the hallway, with his wand in front of him. Neville lays on the floor only a couple of meters away from him. He isn’t moving. Is Harry too late? Is Neville already dead? And is Pettigrew still here? Is that why Draco has his wand out?
Harry leans in and places a soft kiss on Draco’s lips. A blush spreads over Draco’s cheeks and Harry smiles. Draco is so beautiful when he blushes. Harry wants to kiss him all the time just to see him blush.
“Being a prick?” Neville asks with a raised eyebrow.
But the weirdest thing that has happened in the last couple of weeks is the way Professor Moody is trying to get on my good side again. He hasn’t said a nasty word about Draco in class ever since I talked to Professor Snape about him. And just last night he pulled me aside because he wanted to talk to me. He said he had seen that I had been studying dragons and that it was clear that I had figured out the first task. And then he went on to give me some general advice because he doesn’t show favouritism (it appears he only shows favouritism when it comes to people he doesn’t like). His advice was to play to my strengths. I told him I was good a Quidditch, and braiding Draco’s hair, but that I couldn’t see how any of those would help me get passed a dragon. I might be good at flying, but I wouldn’t have a broom on my, only my wand. And then Moody said: ‘My second piece of general advice is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.’ So ever since then, we’ve been practising summoning charms, so that I can summon my broom on Saturday to get past the dragon.
Today my therapy started up again. Miss Davis wasn’t all that impressed with the notes I made during the holidays. When I was still at the Dursleys I really tried to fill it all in, but once I was at the family Tonks I never thought about it again. I was just having a very good time. There was no lingering in bed because I had to show up dressed for the day for breakfast. Also, I was always busy, either with homework and chores or fun stuff, like helping Mrs Tonks with her research or grooming my broom.
“How bad is it going to be for him?” Sirius asks.
“Are you in any pain?” Hermione asks. “Madam Pomfrey said you might still hurt. I can go get her so she can give you some pain potion.”
“But you didn’t give up when she first rejected you?” Harry asks.
“They shouldn’t have boarded the train,” Remus says. “I’ll have to inform Dumbledore about it once we arrive at Hogwarts. It’s already bad enough that the creatures will be protecting the grounds this year. I just wonder why they went after young Mister Malfoy.”
Only moments later the door opened and headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall came in carrying what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall went to get Madam Pomfrey. It seemed there had been another attack and this time it was Colin Creevey, the Gryffindor first year that used to follow me around at the beginning of the year. He was also petrified, still holding his little camera in his hand. When headmaster Dumbledore took it and opened the back a jet of steam hissed out of the camera. The inside of the camera was melted and I wondered what that mend. I still need to tell Hermione; maybe it will help her in figuring out what is attacking everyone.
Harry’s heart stops. He just died in the library and this is heaven. He goes completely still with his arms hanging loosely at his sides.
Draco shakes his head and then pulls his reusable parchment from under his books. He starts to scribble and Harry waits. When the paper is pushed into his hands, he can’t help but laugh.
Harry hates the idea that Pettigrew is still on the loose. It’s been months. James had promised they would have him back in Azkaban in no time at all. And even though James never meant to break that promise, it happened anyway. Harry is angry. His dad is supposed to keep them all safe. That’s why he works for the Auror department. And what does it even mean that they still haven’t found Pettigrew. Are they all incapable of doing their job? Or is Pettigrew that smart that he can stay out of their sight? Did James tell his colleagues that Pettigrew can turn into a rat? Or is he keeping that a secret to protect Uncle Remus?
“And what is that?” Harry asks. He places his free hand on the table and leans a little forward. Draco wants to pull him back into his seat, wants to tell him it’s all useless. There is no way a Muggle treatment can solve their problem. Nothing can.

"I'll drop him off at the Burrow this afternoon. And then he can go home with his grandma afterwards," Harry says. That was the plan all along, that he would spend most of his holiday at Andromeda's. It is better that way. The boy just gets upset when Draco hardly interacts with him, which is most of the time by now. Draco just disappears inside his head, and Harry has no idea how to get him to snap out of it.
So we missed the train and Ron almost panicked because he thought his parents would now be trapped on platform 9 3/4. I calmed him down a little, saying they knew how to apparate, so they would be able to get out. And I just felt my heartbreak. What would Draco think when he would discover I wasn’t on the train? I still wouldn’t be able to find out why he never wrote to me this summer and why he ignored me in Diagon Alley. I didn’t care at that moment that I missed the train to school, I was sad because I won’t be able to see him now. I was so stupid feeling like that. It is better not to see him than to see him avoid me and hang out with Pansy and Daphne like they are his girlfriends now or something.
Malfoy shakes his head and his eyes darken again. ‘And you are going to make things better?’ he scribbles. ‘Do you even know what you did last year? I had to get by without help because you thought you had to make things better.’
“Be glad it was during a match,” Madam Pomfrey says. “If Dumbledore hadn’t been there to slow his fall, I don’t think we could have been able to save him.”
It’s then that I noticed that Professor Lupin was still there and he gave us both a big piece of chocolate. He explained that the thing we saw was a Dementor, one of the guards of Azkaban. Then he told us to eat the chocolate, said it would help, and then he left to go have a talk with the driver. Draco then told me that I had gone rigid and had almost fallen off the seat. The only reason that didn’t happen was that Draco had still been sitting on my lap. It seems that Professor Lupin had told the Dementor that none of us was hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks, and when that didn’t work he used some kind of spell to chase it away. Draco said he felt really cold like he’d never be cheerful again.
That evening during dinner Draco and I got into a fight. Blaise was coming up with all kinds of ways to get passed the age restrictions for the TriWizard tournament and I’m not even sure anymore what happened but it ended with me and Draco shouting at each other. I think I said something nasty about Draco’s parents and he got really upset saying he didn’t want to see me anymore. I yelled back that he didn’t need to and turned around to leave. Blaise later said that Draco was crying by the time I had turned my back and reached out his arm to grab me, to stop me. But before he could reach me there was a loud bang and someone roaring: ‘Oh no you don’t laddie!’. I turned around to see Professor Moody walking towards us, his wand pointing right at a pure white ferret that was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, right where Draco had been standing. Draco was nowhere to be seen. I took me two seconds to realise what had happened. Professor Moody had turned Draco in a ferret.
“Not guilty,” he says again.
Normally, Harry would push his dad away from him as soon as possible. But today is different. His dad needs to hold him for a bit. And Harry needs to be held. He almost died and left them all behind. But he’s still here. Alive and done with keeping his sexuality a secret.
“That’s the spirit,” Remus says. “Now, turn around and go get dinner before Ron has eaten it all.”
I’ll keep you informed of how my holiday is going and will let you know as soon as I know how Draco is doing.
After we’ve all gotten our money we split up and agreed to meet again at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy our schoolbooks. I, Hermione and Ron strolled off toward the broom store. Here I bought the new Nimbus 2001. It’s black and silver with revolving stirrups. Because they pivot they should be more comfortable while slitting in different positions on the broom. The shop owner told me it’s the fastest broom in existence and already ordered by all the big Quidditch teams. Ron is very jealous about it and has already asked me if he can try it out tomorrow. I’m sure I’ll let him after I’ve taken it for a spin myself. I’m looking forward to flying on my own broom. It should be better than the brooms I’ve flown up until now.
“He wasn’t nothing,” Draco answers. “I didn’t know him all that well, but he was good on a broom. A great Quidditch player.”
“Thank you,” Draco says. He feels new tears in his eyes, and he’s glad that Harry has returned with the wine and places an arm around him.
Harry feels his blood boil. “His father is an idiot,” he says. “Malfoy has been struggling in school for two years because that man thinks nobody is allowed to know that his son is deaf. Malfoy needed extra help, and nobody gave it to him. Teachers just thought he was a difficult boy who doesn’t want to study. But he’s not. He studies harder than any of us. Even more than Hermione, and that is saying something. Malfoy’s always reading school books and uses all his free time to learn more. Mrs Prince said he’s in the library almost every day. She noticed what was going on with him. So why did nobody else?”
“What you’ve got there?” Hermione asks from across the table.
Harry looks up from his hands. James gives him a reassuring smile. “You already know, don’t you?” Harry asks.
Harry rolls his eyes and then writes: ‘You’re evil.’
Dear mom and dad,
“I’ll go find Uncle Remus, he can help,” Neville says. He runs to the other side of the carriage and then he’s gone.
Harry snaps his head towards Ron. “I…” he starts, but he’s not sure what to say. They never talk about this. Yes, they do discuss girls when Hermione is not around. But Harry never really gets it. Cho is sweet, and amazing on a broom, but Harry doesn’t feel like kissing her. He doesn’t dream about her, like how he dreams about Cedric and Malfoy. But that’s his secret. Nobody should know it.
Sorry for that, mom and dad. Draco needed some attention. He’s off fetching some food from the Great Hall right now, he won’t bother us again. Let’s get back to my gifts. Mrs Weasley had sent me a slate sweater with a golden snitch on it and a dozen home-baked mince pies. Hagrid has sent me sweets and Hermione gave me more books to read. I also had gifts from our other friends. Blaise had sent us a book about gay sex and how to stay safe with a note to say we were not allowed to do any of it while he was sleeping in the same room. Greg had gotten me some new polish for when I get a new broom and Daphne gave me a book on braiding techniques. And Luna had sent me a magazine about Dementors and how to protect yourself from them. It’s called the Quibbler and Draco said they only publish nonsense. Still, I appreciate the gesture.
The smile on Harry’s face won’t leave him. It follows him all the way to breakfast on Saturday morning. All his homework is done and Malfoy has agreed to learn sign language. Harry’s weekend can’t start any better.
For a short moment, I was afraid Draco would turn around and leave school and that I would never be able to say sorry to him. But he just looked furiously at Hagrid and stayed.
Harry lifts his wand. He wants to hurt Pettigrew. Make him pay for all the pain he caused. By his betrayal. His sick idea of what the world should be like. And all because he couldn’t stand it that Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus are gay? Is that truly the reason why Pettigrew turned on his best friends and gave up the location of Neville’s parents to the Dark Lord? That just makes it worse. It makes it personal.
“Oh, come on. I’ve known you since you were five. And there is only one reason why you show up uninvited and can’t wait till you can get me alone.”
“I go try to have a normal conversation with Malfoy if you go and tell Ron that you like him.”
The warning never came, but the insults from Aunt Marge continued. And then yesterday, just after dinner when Aunt Marge was hammered from the wine she turned on me again. Told me I had a mean, runty look, just like some dogs. And then she told us that she had Colonel Fubster drown one of her dogs last year because it was weak. I looked down at my hands when she continued, small tears falling from my eyes. She went on, explaining it all comes down o blood and that Aunt Petunia’s sister was a bad egg. That she was stupid to run off with a wastrel and that I was the result of that. She then asked what you did for a living, dad and Uncle Vernon said you were unemployed. And then Aunt Marge just went on, saying you were a no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger and I just snapped. I pushed my chair back, stood up and screamed at her that you were not. She laughed at me, joked about the tears I was shedding and then she suggested that you died because you were driving drunk I couldn’t take it and yelled that you didn’t die in a car crash. This made Aunt Marge angry, she, of course, doesn’t know the truth and still believes you dying in a car crash is the trued. She called me a nasty little liar, an insolent, ungrateful little something. She couldn’t finish her sentence, her body was swelling, her face expanded, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech. Then the buttons from her tweed jacket burst. She just kept swelling. I knew I was doing it, but I couldn’t stop it. I was so angry. I’ve never been that angry before, it scared me a little.
Draco nods and forces himself to stay put. He plasters a smile on his face and hopes that his voice will stay steady until he can get away. “Thank you, Adrian. It was the least I could do to please the Dark Lord.”
Draco knew something was bothering me, but I told him I would tell him later, where not everyone could hear. Draco agreed and we eat in silence. Hermione joined us later with the cloak hidden underneath her robes. Once dinner was done we hid away in an empty chamber off the Entrance Hall until the coast was clear. It was a bit tricky to all fit under the cloak because we’ve all grown a bid, mostly Draco, but we managed. Draco pulled me close to him with his arm around my waist and Hermione pushed into Draco’s other side.
Harry nods his head and Draco closes his eyes before he speaks again. “For as long as I can remember I’ve been told that I’m special, that I’m better than others. Because of my blood and my name. But I’m not. I know that. Have known that for some time now. But I still believe our way of life needs to be protected. I hate it that traditions slip away because of half-bloods and muggle-borns who don’t understand them. It’s why I believed that the Dark Lord would make things better. He would protect our way of life. But he’s not, is he? He’s destroying it. Tainting it with blood and murder. Our way of life was never about destroying. It was about protecting our ways. And I don’t know how to protect them anymore.”
Dear mom and dad,
“That’s just twisted,” Neville says.
“Yes, Lupin, I’m sure,” Snape snaps. He’s back on his feet and moves out of Harry’s view.
“Yes, he is,” Neville tells her. “Got a problem with that?”
Oh, I also made Hagrid cry. He came to visit me while I was still in the hospital wing after everything that had happened with Professor Quirrell and Voldemort. He thought it was all his fault because he had told the evil git (his words) how to get past Fluffy. He felt horrible that I could have died, and only because he wanted that dragon egg. He promised to never drink again. I don’t think he will hold up that promise, because he likes to drink once in a while. But at that moment I was shocked to see Hagrid like that. He was shaking and great tears were leaking down into his beard. I comforted him, telling him that Voldemort had found out one way or another and I offered him one of the many chocolate frogs I had gotten.
“I know, Harry. But this is good news. It may not feel like it, but it is. You’re both healthy and able to conceive. That is more than most male couples we see here.”
“That’s enough, Theodore,” Remus says. He waves his wand and the Boggart vanishes back into the cupboard. The lesson is over and the class is dismissed.
Hermione had been waiting for us outside the staffroom. She wanted to make sure we were okay before she went off to the library to do her homework. Her schedule is a mystery to me, she has so many classes a day, I don’t know how she does it. Somehow she goes to Divination but also talks about her lessons of Arithmancy, which is weird because those classes are at the same time. She has no free periods at all because she somehow is following all subjects. I already find it hard with the two extra classes and the massive amounts of homework we have. Oh and even now that Ron and she aren’t a couple they still fight like one. Daphne let slip that they both yelled at each other at lunch after our first Divination lesson. She asked Dean about it and he said they were fighting about divination and if it was real or not. I don’t think they had a normal conversation since.
“I was too late,” Harry says in the end. “I found him too late.”
From that moment on Draco, Hermione, Ron and I have been looking up hexes in the library or practising the Stunning Spell. Draco says he doesn’t mind, but I don’t like stunning him all the time. He always falls in the wrong direction and misses the cushions. Ron suggested to kidnap Mrs Norris and stun her. Hermione and Draco both agreed that was just a stupid idea, that we don’t need Filch to come after us for hurting his cat and that Ron could be my test subject for some time. He didn’t last long, complaining his back was killing him from falling onto it.
In the end, Harry gives up and just goes downstairs to grab a cup of coffee. He needs to get his energy up for what he’s going to do.
“Harry, I’m going if you don’t say what’s on your mind right now,” Ginny says.
Draco took my hand and pulled me into the woods. When I looked at him he had tears streaming down his cheeks and I stopped him when we had just passed the first line of trees. I could hear children crying, anxious shouts and panicked voices all around us, but at that moment I only had eyes for Draco. He muttered he was sorry and I took him in my arms, told him he had nothing to be sorry for. And then he said that he had, that his father was probably one of the people torturing those muggles. I didn’t know what to say to Draco at that point. I don’t blame him for what his father does, and I hate how it hurts Draco, but he was right. Draco’s father was most likely the one organising the masked parade.
Harry runs out of the Great Hall and down the stairs, He stops in front of the Slytherin common room and says the password. Some younger students look surprised to see Harry step inside but nobody says a word.
But that’s not even the best part. Fred and George showed me the seven secret passages into Hogsmeade. Filch knows about four of them, one is caved in and one has it’s entrance below the Whomping Willow. But there is one in the third-floor corridor that goes straight into the cellar of Honeydukes. So after Fred and George had left I wasted no time to get to the third floor and find this secret passage.
“Oh, that,” Lily says. She rolls her eyes. “And you two are willing to destroy our savings and give up on holidays overseas for the coming five years or so?”
“Oh my god. Did Potter just kiss Malfoy?” Justin says. Harry can hear the disgust in his voice. Before dinner starts the entire school will know that Harry tried to kiss a boy. And was turned down. Tears well up in Harry’s eyes. He can’t deal with all of that right now. Not now his heart breaks apart. Draco moves further and further away. He passes by Neville, who’s still motionless on the floor. And then he turns and runs. Harry wants to go after him. Wants to stop him and tell him he’s sorry. Tell him he won’t ever do anything like that again. As long as he can keep Draco as his friend. Only Harry is frozen to the spot.
“Why?” Draco asks.
Well, that all for now. I’m going to brush my teeth and get ready for bed. Got lots of schoolwork to do again tomorrow. I’ll let you know who will become Hogwarts Champion when I write to you again.
People stare at Harry as he walks through the common room. Whispers follow him when he makes his way down to the Great Hall. Heads turn when he sits down next to his friends. Harry ignores them and grabs some sausages and toast. With dread, he looks towards the Slytherin table.
“I could go sit next to him so he can read my notes during class,” Hermione says when it’s clear that they all have agreed that it’s Hermione that will supply the notes. “That way he might even come back to DADA, as he doesn’t have to guess anymore what’s expected of him,” she says.
“I need to go,” Harry says. He stands up and blinks with his eyes. He won’t cry in front of the entire school again. “I’ve got Quidditch practice.”
It will happen tonight. The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than ever he was. Tonight before midnight the servant will set out to rejoin his master.
I’ll try to get some sleep now.
“I like it better when you just let it be,” Harry says. Draco looks at him through the mirror and raises his eyebrow. “Your face becomes hard when you slick it back like that. When it’s all soft and flowing, it just looks better,” Harry continues with a slight blush on his cheeks. It is a good look on Harry and Draco has to force himself to look back at his face and finish his hair.
They go to the Quidditch World Cup final. The game is amazing and Harry has a great time. He spots Lucius Malfoy with his wife. Harry’s heart speeds up while he searches if Draco is with them, but they appear to be alone. Harry is disappointed, but when the night turns into a riot and the Dark Mark appears in the sky, Harry is glad that Draco wasn’t there to witness it all.
It was a beautiful sunny day when we got on the train back to London. Draco and I sat alone in a compartment by ourselves. Blaise, Luna, Greg and Daphne said we should rest and that they would be just across the hall. Draco took me in his arms and I soon fell asleep against his chest. It wasn’t until after lunch, when Hermione and Ron came looking for us that I woke up again. Draco had some sandwiches for me, not that I was hungry. But he forced me to eat something, said it was no good to stop eating.
“Fuck,” Draco says. So the man was innocent. Harry had claimed it before. When Black was on the run two years ago. Back then Draco thought it was funny. Now he understands what it means. Someone wanted Black out of the way, and they managed to do so.
“Hermione, please,” Ron begs her.
Harry shakes his head. “You know what it was like for Uncle Sirius when he came out. His family kicked him out. Draco comes from the same family. He won’t be okay with me being gay. And then to add that I’m head over heels for him. I can’t tell him.”
Later that day I was allowed to go to the end-of-year feast. Madam Pomfrey had held me up with her fussing, so the great hall was already full when I got there. It was decorated in the Gryffindor colours of gold and scarlet and a huge banner showing the Gryffindor lion covered the wall behind the High Table. For the first time in seven years, Slytherin hadn’t won the house cup and people still blamed me for it. I could see it on my housemates’ faces when I walked in, so I silently slipped into a seat next to Draco. He had saved me a place on his right side, and as soon as I sat down he grabbed my left hand with his right, so we would both still have or dominant hand free to eat. He smiled at me and I just had to smile back. I was still alive, and even after performing the body-bind curse on Draco, he was still my friend.
It’s in the paper the next day. Draco stares at the picture of Harry on the front. It’s the one they used over and over again last year during the TriWizard tournament. Draco had thought Harry wouldn’t survive the first task. But he’s made it all the way to the final and even survived the Dark Lord. So why couldn’t he survive a silly little accident? Why did he have to die now? Now that Draco had fallen in love with him? Life would have been so much easier if Harry hadn’t come back from the graveyard. Draco would have never know what he’d lost.
Because that is what happened. We both have to serve a detention later this month. Ron even almost got expelled because he was talking back to Professor Snape when he told us we had done considerable damage to the very valuable Whomping Willow, but luckily for Ron, that decision could only be made by his own head of house Professor McGonagall and she didn’t think expelling Ron was necessary. She and Professor Snape made us explain why we had taken the car, so we told them about the barrier. They asked us why we hadn’t just sent an owl and I felt so stupid then. That had been a much more sensible solution. We also had to explain everything to headmaster Dumbledore and I hated how disappointed he sounded. He was going to write to our families, but I’m not concerned about that, the Dursleys would only be disappointed the Whomping Willow hadn’t squashed me to death.
“Nothing. And I’d like to keep it that way until I’m old and grey,” Ginny says.
At the welcome feast, Hermione and Luna had to part with us to go sit at their own house tables for the rest of the evening. Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean greeted us when they came into the Great Hall, soaked because Peeves had been throwing water balloons in the entrance hall. But their state was better than the first years who looked like they had swum across the lake instead of sailed. The hat sang a song about the founders and then the first years were sorted. I seemed to go on forever and Greg was complaining that he was hungry and that the hat should hurry up.
“Ah, Draco dear, good to see you,” Molly says. “I don’t have any wine for you here. I believe Ginny took all the good stuff with her to the living room.”
“He’s gone mental,” Ron says.
“Okay, I understand. Let’s get this over with. Draco, could you take off your trousers and pants?” Burke asks.
Draco shakes his head. He doesn’t think he can talk now.
When Lucius reaches them, he doesn’t greet any of them. He just grabs Draco by his arm and starts to pull him away. Draco looks at Harry and he lifts his free hand to his chest and circles it over his heart and then points at Harry. Harry repeats the movement with dread in his heart. He knew Draco’s father wouldn't approve of their relationship, but having to say goodbye like this for the entire summer is hard.
Neville and Harry smile at each other and then both take a large bite of their chocolate bars.
We did win the match by the way. In all the commotion nobody had noticed our Seeker catching the snitch, but he did and we won.
Next, we had Defence Against the Dark Arts. I had really been looking forward to this class, but the lesson was a bit of a joke. The classroom smelled strongly of garlic and Professor Quirrell didn’t really tell anything interesting. The only good thing about the lesson was that nobody paid attention to me.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Harry shouts after Ron.
“You want to tell me about him?” Narcissa asks. Her hand rests on Draco’s side. It’s comforts Draco, and frightens him at the same time. Everything is just so messed up. And Draco has no idea how to fix it.
“I thought you would be sad to have him be away so much,” Draco confesses.
Harry laughs through his tears. “I’ll try. But not on this. I won’t let him hurt Neville or Iris. I promise I’ll keep them safe at school. You won’t have to worry about us.”
Harry shakes his head. Ron is right. Harry is so used to just sign with Neville when they think a teacher is being ridiculous. Uncle Remus will understand it all. And he won’t hesitate to call out Harry and Neville when they do.
“Yes,” Draco says. “He’s the only other person I told besides you and father. You don’t have to worry. Nobody else knows.”
“Let them,” Harry says before he puts the last of his eggs into his mouth.
The next day Nott followed me around the castle and I was afraid to go to Myrtle’s bathroom to talk to her. She was the only one left in the castle I could talk to. Isn’t that pathetic, Hermione is away for the holidays and I’m left with only a ghost of a dead moaning girl to hang out with. Nott tried to hex me all day and I used the Expelliarmus charm on him a couple of time with success, stopping him from tripping me with his leg-bind jinxes.
Oh, and something is up with Draco. He seems very disturbed about what happened to Mrs Norris. And that’s just weird because Draco hates cats. He has kept to himself all day, hiding away in his bed, writing in this little notebook he has. He even told Nott to get the hell away from him. I wish I knew what was going on with him. I hate seeing him like this. He looks paler than usual and he didn’t even bother to style his hair today. I think something is bothering him. But I’ll probably never learn what it is since mister “I pretend you don’t exist Harry” won’t speak to me.
He wanted to know how I, a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent, who even wasn’t smart enough to kill himself properly, managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How had I escaped with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort his powers were destroyed? I asked him why he wanted to know and he told me he was Lord Voldemort. That it was the name he had fashioned for himself, a name he knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when he had become the greatest sorcerer in the world.
I haven’t told Ron or his brothers that I’m bent. They still joke about the fact that Ginny likes me so much and that she’s acting all shy around me since she normally very chatty. I feel kind of bad about not correcting them when they joke I could marry into their family one-day thanks to Ginny. And that it is not their sister that gives me butterflies, but that thinking of Draco makes me feel that way. I don’t know if they will understand or if they would start treating me differently if they know. And I like that they are all so nice to me right now.
Draco is acting weird since the first day off school. Harry doesn't understand. It's like last year didn't happen at all.
“Really, Harry, you can’t leave a vase like that empty. It’s made to hold flowers,” Draco had said.
“What did he say?” Ron asks.
“Let’s get back and get pissed then,” Harry says. He takes Draco’s hand in his again and starts the trek back to the cottage. And Draco is sure now. 2002 is going to be the best year ever.
Other students enter the Entrance Hall, and one of them runs into Harry. “Sorry,” the boy shouts as he moves towards the Hufflepuff common room. It shakes Harry into action. He waves at Draco and then walks up the stairs. When he’s halfway up to the first floor he turns and watches as Draco makes it down the stairs. It hurts watching him go. “Fuck,” Harry mutters and then he continues his tread to Gryffindor tower.
“I’ll write to Narcissa,” Sirius says. “Try to convince her to let the boy stay with his new favourite uncle for some time this summer,” Sirius says.
“Fuck, Harry. I’m sorry,” Angela says. “And here I’m being upset about a silly joke.”
I think that’s all for now. It’s been a good couple of weeks and I’m doing much better than before. I write again soon.
“Don’t eat too much, you might fall off your broom again,” Parkinson jokes. The people around her laugh. Harry just shakes his head and continues his breakfast.
Sunday 24 October 1993
Draco is telling me I still need to finish my paper on Vampires for Lupin and that he would like to go to sleep soon, so I guess I’ll get on to that. I’ll write to you soon.
Harry sighs. “Thank Merlin,” he says.
Draco raises his eyebrows. Does he mean Sirius Black? And why is he important? Harry told Draco about his godfather, during one of their nights alone on the Astronomy tower.
“Just one more thing,” Neville says. Harry stops and turns around. Neville looks up from his bed with a grin on his face. “Next time I wake up I expect you to sit next to my bed holding my hand because you are worried about me, not snogging Draco’s face off.”
Draco brings the cup to his mouth and takes a small sip. “It’s hot,” he says.
“And this is why I didn’t tell you. I knew you would be like this. Just because you can’t have a child of your own. Really, Draco, I would think that by now you would have learnt that the world doesn’t revolve around you!” Pansy screams.
He took us to headmaster Dumbledore’s office. Draco’s parents were there and it was clear that his mother had been crying. She took Draco in her arms as soon as we entered the office. Headmaster Dumbledore was also there, just like Professor McGonagall. The headmaster made Draco go to the hospital wing to get checked out and his parents went with him. And then they asked me to tell them what had happened. I told them everything, up till the moment that Professor Snape found us in the bathroom.
We had to take a little cart over railway tracks to the fault. It was very cool. I had hoped to see a dragon. Hagrid had said they have dragons at the bank. But I didn’t see any. I think I did see some fire, but no dragons. Hagrid also retrieved a package from vault seven hundred and thirteen. He didn’t want to say what it was, secret Hogwarts business.
‘That explains why you are so lousy at every subject that is more difficult than Divination,’ Malfoy writes
“Pettigrew is in Hogsmeade,” he says. “He’s been spotted there this week.”
Harry lets out a heavy sigh. “I could be the youngest professional Quidditch player of the century,” he says without meaning it. They both know that won’t happen if he drops out of school now. He’s too young to be on the radar of any of the scouts. They won’t start paying attention to him before he takes his OWLs.
“I’m okay, I promise,” Harry says. He pulls the picnic basket towards him and checks what’s in it.
We had a Hogsmeade weekend the weekend after that. We first went out with our friends. It was one of the first good days of the year, weather-wise. The sun was out and it was fun. Daphne went on and on about how annoying Pansy is getting. It turns out that Pansy and Nott have started dating and that Pansy won’t shut up about her boyfriend and how great he is. How much better he is than Greg, how much smarter and with more potential for the future. Hermione and Luna helped her to come up with ways to annoy Pansy.
“He said he’ll catch up later,” Hermione says.
They both burst out in laughter and Harry almost drops his glass. “I don’t know,” he blurts out. “Because it’s the biggest Quidditch tournament ever. And because it’s our favourite sport.”
“Is it because of the banner at the neighbours?” Harry asks. His voice closer now, just behind Draco.
When I was secured professor Quirrell turned back to a big mirror standing in the room. It was the Mirror of Erised, the one I had discovered during Christmas break. Quirrell was examining it and I tried to distract him from it by saying I had seen him and Professor Snape in the forest. Quirrell told me that professor Snape was onto him by that time and that he tried to frighten him. But that it hadn’t worked because Quirrell had Lord Voldemort on his side.
The last weekend at school was the best of the entire year. On Saturday morning Draco had to participate in an impromptu Quidditch match against Gryffindor. I went to watch it with all my friends and it was very exciting and fun, having both Gryffindors as Slytherin friends around me, screaming at each other in a friendly manner over the game. Ron and Greg are both very enthusiastic about Quidditch. Hermione and I just laughed at them half of the time for their crazy accusations of foul play. Blaise didn’t seem to be interested in the game at all and was talking with Daphne about summer holidays plans. Halfway to the game, Neville, Seamus and Dean joined us on the stands and joined in with the cheering for their house team.
The restricted section of the library is scary. It really gave me the creeps. The books there are old and most of them have titles in languages I don’t know. There was even a book that looked like it had a massive blood stain on it. And it sounded as if a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew I was there. But I was determent and decided to take a book from the bottom shelf. It was a very heavy black and silver volume and when I opened it a piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence. The book was screaming at me. I snapped it shut, but the screaming didn’t stop. I ran from the library, passing Filch in the doorway. When I stopped running I didn’t really know where I was, but Filch had managed to catch up with me and he was talking with Professor Snape and they were coming my way in the narrow corridor. I backed up as quietly as I could and was very happy when a door to my left was ajar so I could hide in that room. I was very relieved when they passed the door without noticing me.
We reached the third-floor corridor door and it was already ajar. So Snape was already there and he had left a harp next to the trap door. I took out my flute and started to play. Fluffy’s eyes dropped closed. It didn’t take long before he was fast asleep. Ron warned me not to stop playing, while we crept toward the trapdoor. We had to step over Fluffy’s legs to reach it and Ron went first. He opened the trapdoor and told us he couldn’t see anything and that there was no way of climbing down. We had to drop down. I gave the flute to Hermione and then I climbed over Fluffy’s legs. I lowered myself through the hole and then I let go. I fell very far down but I landed on something soft. It felt like some sort of plant. I screamed at the others that it was okay to come down. Ron and Hermione jumped and landed next to me.
Harry looks around the Great Hall. It’s still early for a Saturday, but Harry’s sure that Draco is in here somewhere. He scans over the Slytherin table and spots Draco at the back. He sits alone, a mug with juice in his hand on his way to his mouth, while his eyes are fixed on the book in front of him. A smile forms on Harry’s face as he moves towards Draco and sits down next to him. Draco looks up from his book, smiles and then continues to read. Harry grabs some bacon and eggs and plants them on a piece of toast. Then he pours himself a cup of coffee.
When the recording ended, the Minister apologised to us all and said he would make sure this evidence was stored and Black cleared of all charges. He then hurried off to stop the Dementors kiss.
Neville laughs. “They are more like them than they realise,” he says. “Did you hear Ron talking in his sleep last night?”
Harry’s head spins. All the crazy gifts were tokens and Draco wants to marry him. His hand slides into his pocket and holds onto the little piece of fabric hidden inside. It comforts Harry as it has done for the last two months. He hardly listens to Ginny and Zabini’s conversation. He needs to tell Malfoy that he accepts, that he wants to see where this goes.
“I’m fine,” Harry says. “I just want to go.” He wants to disappear. He can’t stand the thought that the entire school will know soon that he’s gay. He doesn’t want to see the faces of disgust and lose some of his popularity. Harry never thought it meant anything, but now that he’s about to lose it, he realises he loves all the attention. He likes being popular. And now he will be an outcast. An outcast, who just lost one of his best friends, because he fell in love with them.
Saturday 5 September 1992
After that Hagrid and I ate ice cream and bought parchment and quills. I also bought this notebook and ink that changes colour when you write. I didn’t tell Hagrid why, but I liked the idea that I now don’t have to look for little scraps of paper to write to you. It makes it so much easier to tell you about what I do and everything. We also bought school books, a cauldron, scales and a collapsible brass telescope. And then Hagrid bought me an owl as a birthday present. She is really beautiful, she’s a snowy owl. I’ll have to think of a name for her. I’m sure I’ll come up with something before I write you again.
Remus looks at the Willow and then smiles at Harry. “Sirius will take care of me,” he says. They moved into a little cottage in Hogsmeade a couple of days ago, so they can be together on most nights and during the weekend.
‘You will?’ Harry asks. He had expected more protest. But it seems that now that Malfoy has decided that he deserves some extra help, he is fine with receiving it.
And then the scariest thing of all happened. Quirrell was talking to himself, questioning the working of the mirror, even asking his master for help. But how was Voldemort supposed to help him, he wasn’t here. But a voice answered, and it seemed to come from Quirrell himself. The voice said to use me. Quirrell clapped his hand and the ropes that still bound me fell to the ground. Quirrell made me look into the mirror, and I was going to lie about what it would show me, I would never give the stone to Quirrell.
Harry laughs. “I did have a small crush on him at the beginning of the year.”
Draco shakes his head. “Don’t apologise. I know this hurts,” he says.
When I came home from school, Sirius told me more about him and Professor Lupin. I didn’t ask him about it when he was still at the school, but I had been wondering. It turns out that they started dating in fourth year and had been together until Sirius was sent to Azkaban. I think Sirius still loves Professor Lupin or Moony as he calls him. But they are not together now. Sirius says that too much has happened since then, that they are both different men than they were before you died. They are still friends and maybe one day they can find the love they once had again. But for now, I just think it’s sad to see how much Sirius misses Professor Lupin. He was really upset when he heard that Professor Lupin had resigned because word had spread that he is a werewolf. Went on and on about how unfair it is. I feel the same, Professor Lupin was the best Defence Against the Dark Arts professor we’ve ever had. Even though we didn’t always see eye to eye, and he really screwed up with the Boggart lesson, but he tried his best after that to make sure nothing like that ever happened again. Draco even feels a little sad to see him go, and that is saying something.
Draco looks up at the boy and nods his head. “Just be quiet,” he says.
The piano has to go too. There is no way Harry can keep it. Not after all the nights he found Draco sitting in front of it, his hands on the keys producing the most amazing sounds. Harry could sit at his desk all night, trying to get work done, but being mesmerised by Draco’s singing voice. A voice Harry will never hear again.
Draco pulls out of the kiss and stares over Harry’s shoulder. His eyes light up when he spots their friends. And maybe Harry can be kind. It’s their last day at Hogwarts. Their last trip to Hogsmeade this year. And it’s clear Draco is going to miss them all. Not just Harry. So Harry turns and waves for them to join them. They all sit in a way that Draco can see them easily and that brings a smile to Harry’s face. They’ve all adapted to Draco being deaf so quickly, and without complaints. Hermione and Ron are even learning how to sign. Hermione is making progress, but Ron is a disaster. He can’t seem to remember what he should do with his hands. Draco shakes his head and at one point even takes Ron’s hand in his to make him stop.
The tests were horrible, by the way. I don’t want to talk about it too much. First, they did some diagnostics with us just sitting there. But after that, they hurt one of us in a different room to see if we would know. I screamed at them to stop and Draco told he didn’t do much better. Madam Pomfrey gave us loads of chocolate when the tests were done and told us that we’d done well.
“Then why are you leaving me alone? What other reason is there to let me go if it’s not because you hate me?” Draco shivers. He’s thought it a million times and saying it out loud makes it even more real. Harry must hate him. There is no other way this can end.
The article was very mean, calling Hagrid brutal and saying students were scared of him. And they said that his mother was part of Voldemort’s army of giants that killed many muggles. And Nott and Crabbe were mentioned in the article, saying Hagrid wasn’t able to stop his Hippogriff from attacking the students and that he’s torturing them with his new Blast-Ended-Skrewts. If Professor Grubby-Plank hadn’t called for attention I’m sure we would have ended up fighting with them.
“Leftover from Teddy’s fall,” Draco answers. His voice sounds so hollow, as if it doesn’t matter. It sounds like the Draco from sixth year when he was high all the time and didn’t care what happened next. Harry lifts his head and looks at the man in front of him. His eyes stare past Harry, into the distance.
Hermione narrows her eyes at Harry. “But it’s not just one essay, isn’t it?” she asks. “You hardly do any of the work. If you keep this up, you’re going to fail your exams.”
“We need to get Longbottom to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape says. Harry looks to the side and sees that Snape sits next to Neville. “It’s nothing serious, just a powerful Stunning Spell. He’ll have a nice headache for a couple of days.”
Harry blushes and looks back at his plate. His parents haven’t said a word about Harry’s crush on their extra house guest this holiday. Not since they got home only two hours ago. Harry is sure his dad will pull him into a private conversation before they are due back at Hogwarts. But for now, they are behaving. Even Sirius only gave Draco a questioning look before he returned to Lily to tell her that he’s making the pudding for Christmas dinner.
“How come Snape knows sign language?” Harry asks.
I love you and I miss you.
Harry stares at the empty space where Draco and his dad just stood. It’s done more often, people Apparating from the station. But this seemed a little over the top.
Love you,
“You knew he was courting me?” Harry asks her.
Harry closes the book and makes his way to their usual table. Malfoy will be there, and Harry wants to show him this book. And tell him that they can go and practice BSL in the DADA classroom. Uncle Remus told Harry they could use it as a place to practice. That way, nobody will be able to see what Malfoy and he are up to.
I’d forgotten all about the prediction Professor Trelawney made, about the servant reuniting with his master until Draco and I were in a compartment alone in the train on our way to London. He asked me what it was that had upset me before I came to find him that evening. I told him how Professor Trelawney went all strange and the message she gave me. Draco didn’t believe that Professor Trelawney wasn’t such a big fake as he had thought all year. I asked him if he thinks I made it happen by saving Pettigrew’s life. That if I had let Sirius and Professor Lupin kill him, he couldn’t have returned to Voldemort and then maybe Voldemort won’t be coming back. Draco told me not to worry, that Pettigrew owns me a life debt and that the Dark Lord would never want to have a servant that is in debt like that to Harry Potter.
Draco signs the word ‘what’ and Harry looks back at Draco’s face.
“So, what now?” Harry asks. “There must be something we can do?”
Dear mom and dad,
“Hermione, you are brilliant,” Harry tells her. He leans over Ron and gives Hermione a peck on her cheek.
When I left the platform Uncle Vernon, who is still purple-faced with that ugly moustache of his, was waiting for me, with a terrified-looking aunt Petunia and Dudley standing behind him. They hurried me out of the station and we drove back home. As soon as we got home, uncle Vernon locked all my schoolbooks, my wand, robes, cauldron and all other school supplies in the cupboard under the stairs. I have no idea how I’m going to make my homework this way.
We joined the others, who were just as surprised to see me, they all paid for their sweets and then we went into the snow. Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card. The little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow, holly wreaths hung on the doors and strings of enchanted candles decorated the trees. We walked around the town a little until Draco said we had to get inside. I had forgotten my coat and was really cold. Draco had his arm around my waist and pulled me close to him while we walked, but I was still shivering.
Harry looks at their friends again. Ron seems to be losing. He’s covered with snow. Malfoy seems to be able to dodge most snowballs. His coat is still mostly black. His cheeks are flushed. He’s beautiful. Harry swallows as his hand moves up to touch his lips.
Within seconds, Harry is pulled back against Remus’ chest. “Don’t you listen to that man for one second,” Remus says. “He’s wrong. He was scared and a coward. He still is. He would have faced us by now if he wasn’t. He needs to tell himself something to make right what he did. But nothing he says will ever be true. He was our friend, and for years he didn’t mind that Sirius and I were together. It’s not our fault he fell for Voldemort’s lies. It’s nobody’s fault but his own.”
“Of course, he does,” James says. “His mother was the same. Nobody could keep secrets from her.” James looks away for a second. Harry wonders how much his parents still miss them. They were all friends before it happened. Both hidden away to try to save their children.
* * *
A tear slips from Draco’s eyes, and he turns away from Andromeda. “She will just say I deserve this. She made it pretty clear what she thinks about my life choices.” Draco swallows and wipes his tears away. “I don’t know why I even care that she knows.”
Malfoy also makes fun of me every morning when I don’t receive any mail, reminding me that I don’t have any friends or family that care about me. He receives daily packages from his home with sweets and other treats that he shares with the others, except me of course, because I’ve not earned them.
Pettigrew looks towards Neville again. His nostrils flare and colour flushes his face.
“Fine, I’ll do it alone then,” Harry says. He puts down his half-eaten sandwich, stands up and gives Hermione a begging face. She always wants to stand up for others. Harry doesn’t get why she isn’t already forcing the school to start teaching BSL or something. Only Hermione just shakes her head and doesn’t come to the rescue.
After all that Mr Crouch gave us the instructions for the first tasks, which aren’t useful at all. The only thing we know is that it is to test our daring and courage. We are only to take our wands with us. The only good thing they told me was that I was exempted from end of year exams.
Professor Lupin was a bit surprised when he saw that Draco was with me during this lesson. He chuckled a little and mumbled something about it being a miracle that Snape was right for once. And then we got down to business. Professor Lupin had brought a Boggart, sure it would turn in a Dementor because that is what I fear the most. He told Draco to stay behind me at all times, that there is no need for the Boggart to turn into his biggest fear again. And I completely agree with that, it’s no fun to see your own dead body on the floor. I still haven’t forgotten the last time and how upset Draco was for days after.
“Don’t interrupt my boy,” Harry says. “You can eat once he’s told us his news.”
And then he’s right in front of Harry.
“Not a club I wanted to be part of,” Draco counters back.
Harry raises his shoulders. He doesn’t care what Neville and Ron think about this all. Aren’t they curious about Malfoy? Why doesn’t he want any help? Did Harry do something to him, and is that why he doesn’t want to be seen with them? Is it because they are in Gryffindor and he’s a Slytherin? Harry just needs to know. He needs to find out why Malfoy’s grey eyes are like thunder clouds when he spots Harry looking at him.
Dudley also asked me why I was staring at the hedge, and I made up a lie, saying I was thinking of the best spell to set it on fire. Dudley stumbled backwards at once and started stuttering that his dad will send me away and that I have nowhere else to go because I don’t have any friends. And that just made me angry, so I started saying nonsense words pretending to do magic. Dudley ran back inside to his mom and she made me do work around the house all day. I wasn’t to have anything to eat until it was finished.
Harry turns so he can look at the Shrieking Shack. “No, I don’t think they ever considered that friends could do something like that,” he says. Wormtail used to join them on the nights Remus needed his friends. He was one of them. He was supposed to fight on their side and help keep Neville and Harry safe. Harry will never understand what could have made Pettigrew betray all his friends and side with Voldemort. Nothing is more important than friends and family.
The house fills with Death Eaters again as the day goes on. Draco keeps to himself. He doesn’t talk to others and stays clear of the Dark Lord as much as he can. But the inevitable moment comes just before dinner. The Dark Lord calls Draco to come to stand next to him.
“Were they here for Pettigrew?” Harry asks.
Healer Burke just makes a note on the file and smiles at them. “Okay, well there isn’t anything else I can do for you. Well, maybe there is. There is this test Draco could take once a week to see when he’s most fertile. I could prescribe that, to help you both pinpoint the moments the sex will be most effective. But I must warn you. This can put a strain on your love life.”
“Ronald Bilius Weasley,” Hermione states as she stands up. “You fought with Harry on the day of the task because of his crush? Are you insane?”
“I love you too.” Draco chokes on his words. He wishes it wasn’t so, that he could just get up and leave. That way, Harry wouldn’t have to choose between his family and Draco. Then Harry would be able to find someone that can give him that perfect family he deserves.
“Can we try this again tomorrow? I promise not to cry like a baby again.”
Hermione was also afraid of the flying lesson. She had tried to learn all about it by reading a book called Quidditch Through the Ages. She gave me tips that might help, like how to hold the broom and what not to think about when in the air. And never look down when you’re afraid.
Why did Pansy have to name her son, the child she never wanted anyway, Vincent? Doesn’t the bitch know that it will hurt Draco even more? Draco knows he hurt her when he turned her down in fourth year, but did she have to make it her mission to torture him for it for the rest of his life?
“I know you’re talking about me,” Hermione says. Her hands struggle to keep up with her words, but she’s trying. Even Ron has started to sign some small words, like yes and no. It will take time before they are all fluent, but it’s a start. And it helps Draco to feel included.
“Don’t,” Harry stammers. “He’s got nothing to do with this. He isn’t like me.”
“I know what I’m going to tell you in a moment isn’t going to sound like good news, but I have to stress that it is, in fact, good news,” she tells them.
“I know,” Draco answers. “I didn’t want to get your hopes up for if I was wrong.” Draco knows how important a family is to Harry, how he wishes to have multiple children one day to love and cherish. He would have been so disappointed if it had just been a silly flu that made Draco so sick and tired.
“Look how tiny she is,” Harry says. He looks up and smiles at Draco. “What do you think, Draco?”
“Yes, you need to make the broom hover,” Harry says. “That’s the hard part. You control the broom with the movements of your body. You lean forward when you want to speed up, or backwards when you want to slow down. It’s easy.
Harry shakes his head. “No, dad. He said I was his best friend. I’m just his best friend,” he says.
Draco says hi, by the way. He’s busy writing in his own little notebook. He says it holds the memory of a student that lived here in Hogwarts like fifty years ago and that the Chamber had also been opened when he was here. A girl died back then. I asked him if he could ask this Tom more about this girl and what had happened to her, but Draco doesn’t want to bring it up to him, because they seemed to have had a fight about who was responsible for it. This Tom also thinks Hagrid did it. But I’m sure he hasn’t. Hagrid has a good heart. He might like dangerous creatures, but he would never want to hurt anyone. Not on purpose anyway. I hope Hagrid is okay, being stuck in Azkaban. Draco told me about that place and it sounds nasty.
After some time we heard footsteps behind us, but nobody was there. Draco called out a hello, but there was no answer. And then someone shouted a spell that made Draco shiver next to me. A vast, green light erupted from between the trees and flew up into the sky. It formed a colossal skull with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. In seconds the woods around us erupted with screams and Draco was squeezing so hard onto my hand it hurt. I whispered to him to ask what it was and he told me it was the Dark Mark, the sign of the Dark Lord. We stood there frozen searching the woods around us for the person who had conjured the mark until wizard appeared around us. We only just ducked in time before they all started shooting off stupefy’s. And then Tonks screamed at them to all stop, that it was Harry Potter they were aiming at.
“I’m sure he’ll be there,” James says. He doesn’t need to be told why Harry’s mood changed and Harry loves him for it. “The Malfoys have made sure they have tickets for a private box,” James says.
* * *
Hermione slaps Ron on the back of his head forcing a laugh out of Neville, Ginny and Iris. Harry rubs the back of his neck and then turns towards Draco. Ron is right. It’s just for a short while. Dinner will be in an hour and Draco will join them. And tomorrow classes will start again and they will be able to spend more time together.
* * *
“Yeah, fine,” Harry says. “I’ll remember next time.”
If it hadn’t been for Myrtle showing up and showing me the way, I think I would have stayed on that spot and died there as soon as the Gillyweed stopped working. She led me almost all the way into the Mer-people’s village but had to turn around just before because she and the Merpeople don’t like each other. I continued by myself until I found Draco. He was tied to a statue of a Merman, and I sped towards him. I took his lulling face in my hands and just wished for a sign he was still alive. I hugged him and told him I was sorry, only no sound came from my mouth, just bubbles. I cried into Draco’s shoulder. I had found him, but he was still gone, the whole inside me was still there.
Ron and Neville laugh. Harry shakes his head. “Small chance,” he says.
“I know,” Draco agrees.
They both laugh and the tension is gone. “It would have been nice, to have a girlfriend,” Neville says. “Maybe then Lavender and Parvati will leave us alone.”
Professor Snape rushed towards me, making sure I was alright. But all I wanted to know is what the bastard had done to Draco and if he was fine. Professor Snape understood and he smelled the tea and then checked Draco. He promised me it was just a sleeping potion, that Draco was fine, and that he would wake up once the potion had set its course.
I love you and miss you so much right now.
The topic of conversation switches back to Ron’s holiday to Egypt after that. Wood stops by at some point to tell Harry Quidditch practice starts this Saturday at eleven since their first game will be against Slytherin. There will be no time to relax into the season, and Harry is fine with that. The amount of Quidditch he gets to play is the best part of being at school.
‘You got it?’ Harry writes. Malfoy nods his fist and they both smile.
“Nothing serious,” Neville says quickly.
“Why do you think I did something stupid?” Pansy asks. She twirls her glass of wine in her hand.
Hermione rests her head on Harry’s shoulder. “I think you’re wrong. The way he stares at you, and wants to be close to you all the time. He might feel the same as you,” she says.
Neville lifts his shoulders. “Don’t know. He won’t tell us,” he says at the same time that Harry sputters: “Am I not allowed to be in a good mood?”
Malfoy stands up, pulls his blanket tighter around his body. “I thought you were a Gryffindor, but turns out you’re an even bigger coward than me,” he says before he turns and walks away.
“Stay with me forever,” Draco says.
On my way out of the castle, I couldn’t stop thinking about how Professor Snape had said that all was okay, that there was nothing to worry about. I got so angry, I wanted to hurt Snape. He lied to me. Nothing was right. All was wrong. Once I left the castle behind me I ran towards the lake, spotted Snape and confronted him. I screamed some horrible things at him. I think Snape tried to calm me down, to tell me it really was okay, but I didn’t hear a word of what he said.
Granger looks at Draco likes he’s a fool. “I’m not his girlfriend,” she says.
I made up a silly lie when Quirrell asked me what I had seen and he started staring into the mirror again himself. I tried to walk away, but the voice was back, screaming I lied. And then it said it wanted to speak to me. I was rooted to my spot while Quirrell reached up and unwrapped his turban and turned around. I couldn’t make a sound, I was so scared. There, on the back of Quirrell’s head was a face, the most terrible face I’ve ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. It whispered my name. I tried to take a step backwards, but my legs wouldn’t move. The face started talking, telling me how it had stayed alive and then told me to give him the stone that was inside my pocket.
There are sounds in the distance. Harry sits up straight when he hears Remus shout his name.
When Professor Moody came into the classroom he told us to put our books away and started to explain curses to us. Talked about how we needed to see the curses that could be done to us to learn how to defend ourself against them. He asked us if we knew which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law. None of the Slytherins rose their hands, but some of the Gryffindors did. Moody pointed out Ron, asked him if he was Arthur Weasley’s son and smiled at Ron. Ron named the Imperius Curse. Moody said that most student in our class would know about it since a lot of their parents apparently were victim to it. Then he took out a spider and put the curse on it, he made it do funny things at first and most students started to laugh. Until he explained that he now had total control over the spider and that he could make it do terrible things to itself, like jump out of the window or drown itself. And then the trouble really started. He talked about that years back a lot of witches and wizards were being controlled by the Imperius Curse and that this made it impossible for the Ministry to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will. He continued on with saying that he knows who’s parents were not under its control, even though they had claimed to be. He walked right up to me and Draco and looked at Draco and said: ‘Most of them should be in Azkaban, but somehow they are still free and respected. Don’t think you will get any freebies in my class. Most of you will fail my class, I’m sure of it. Most of all you, Mr Malfoy. You don’t fool me with, just like your father wasn’t able to fool me.’
Harry smiles. His heart beats in his throat. Draco doesn’t want him to die. Because he calls Harry his best friend. The smile falls from his face. Harry is just Draco’s best friend. Harry can’t tell him what he feels for Draco. It will ruin their friendship. Draco just said it. They are just best friends. Nothing more and nothing less. Harry is gay and falling for a straight boy. But he’s gay. There’s no doubt about that. Harry has known for a while, but now he’s a hundred percent sure. Because his heart has just shattered into a million pieces. He’s only Draco’s best friend.
“Don’t, this was not your fault,” James says. “I already yelled at Dumbledore and together we yelled at the Minister. Can say, it’s kind of cool to be able to yell at the big boss for once,” James jokes.
“He’s down the stairs, to the left,” one of the girls stutters out between her laughs.
Pansy looks up with wide eyes. “I thought we said we would never mention that again,” she spits.
“Some people like being alone,” Neville says. “Not everyone loves being the centre of attention.” He waves his hand towards Harry.
I had been there for three days. The stone has been destroyed. It means Nicolas Flamel and his wife are going to die, but the headmaster assured me that for the well-organized mind death is but the next great adventure. He said he was just glad he was in time to save me. It seems I had come very close to dying that night. And then he said that Draco and Hermione would be very relieved to know I had come round because they had been worried.
“Why did you have to go?” he screams at the floor. “Why did you leave me?”
Draco bites his bottom lip. “Hasn’t worked before,” Draco signs.
Harry nods. It doesn’t make it better. Harry wants Draco there with him. To enjoy the game together. To share the experience.
“You always say that about everything. And you know it’s rubbish. You’re a quick learner,” Draco says. He pushes a key and the sound fills the room.
After that, he moved on to the second curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which Neville had mentioned. Moody enlarged the next spider and then muttered Crucio. The spider’s legs bent in upon its body, it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. And over time the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently. It was then that Hermione shouted at Moody to stop it. I looked at her and saw she wasn’t looking at the spider but at Neville, who’s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white. Later Ron told us that Neville’s eyes had been wide and horrified. Moody shook his head and stopped the curse and put that spider away. Moody said that this curse was once very popular too, that Mr Malfoy’s aunt liked performing it and that he hoped that he could teach young Mr Malfoy one day how it feels. I hated the way Moody was picking on Draco, but I didn’t know what to do against it.
Dobby hadn’t only woken me and Draco on Christmas morning. Draco’s screams woke Blaise and Greg. Blaise asked if we could please put up some silencing charms, that he didn’t need his Christmas ruined by our filthy habits. And then we could here Nott. He sounded angry about the fact that Draco and I were sharing a bed and he stormed off to go tell Professor Snape. I expected Crabbe to follow him, but he just said ‘can’t believe it took him this long to figure out that the lovebirds never stopped sleeping together’.  Greg and Blaise laughed and for a moment I thought that maybe we could all become friends one day again.
It had been beautiful. Harry wishes he had recorded it so he could listen to it one last time, the song Draco wrote just for him. Instead, the piano disappears and Harry falls on his knees on the empty spot.
Harry takes Draco’s face in his hand and kisses him. Draco opens his mouth and their tongues entangle for a second. And then Draco pushes Harry to the side as he sprints out of bed in the hope he will reach the toilet in time. Harry follows him and gives him a glass of water when Draco sits up against the bathtub.
It’s because of that stupid duelling club that Professor Lockhart tried to start up last week Wednesday. Hermione and I thought it would be fun and useful. Learning how to duel might help with keeping the bullies at bay. It’s not as bad as last year; it’s mostly just Nott saying mean things. But Hermione is right, and now that Draco isn’t teaching me defensive spell anymore I’ll have to learn them somewhere else.
“I know that we’re lucky that Draco is capable of carrying a baby. We’ve got friends that aren’t that lucky. They’re both half-bloods and both not capable. But it should have happened again, shouldn’t it? He got pregnant in only a couple of months that first time. I don’t understand why it isn’t happening again.” Draco hates the hesitation in Harry’s voice. Hates himself for causing all this pain.
* * *
* * *
“I’m selfish? You get angry at me, just because I’m getting something you want but can’t have. Do you have any idea how hard this has been for me? The father doesn’t want anything to do with this child. I'm in this alone. And as much as I dreaded to tell you because I knew it would hurt you, I wanted you to be a part of this. You’re my best friend, for fuck’s sake. Start acting like one for a change.”
Oh, and Hermione is on a roll. She’s looking into all the ways Rita Seeker could possibly be able to listen into private conversations. It’s taken her mind of the whole free the Elves business, so that’s nice. I suggested that maybe she had used Muggle bugs. But it turns out that electricity and radar and that kind of stuff goes haywire around Hogwarts. And then she complained that we should read Hogwarts, A History. Ron kissed her on the cheek and told her that there was no point because his girlfriend knows it by heart and he can always ask her. Hermione was blushing and pushed him away.
For days Draco expected it to happen again. He fears that one day it would be too much, that his mother’s body wouldn’t be able to take any more and that she would pass on. Taking the punishment Draco deserves.
“She loves you. Already said it about two years ago, that you might be. She’s a smart woman, your mum,” James says. He gets that dreamy look that he gets more often when he thinks of Lily.
The other students in the common room all started blaming me for everything when I came back. They said that the other houses hated them even more now because all of the victims had been from the other houses. And that everyone was sure that it was all Slytherins fault. Some had even heard others saying that Slytherin house should be chucked out. And they all blamed me.
That is when I knew I had to try to survive somehow. Even with all the odds against me, surrounded by laughing Death Eaters. (How am I going to tell Draco that his father was one of the loudest laughs among them? It will hurt him to know that his father wishes me dead.) When Voldemort gave me a breather, I ducked away and hid behind the headstone.  I could here Voldemort coming closer. He was taunting me, saying he would finish me. And deep down inside I knew there was no way for me to escape death. I cried as I made a choice. I was not going to die like a coward, hiding behind a grave. I was going to die standing proud, just like you dad. So I whisper a goodbye towards Draco and then stood up. I stumbled around the grave to face Voldemort and the end. I fired off the only spell I knew would give me a small chance of survival. My Expelliarmus left my wand at the same moment that Voldemort cast his Avada Kadava.
They pulled the bars from my window with their flying car and then George and Fred came into my room to pick the lock so they could get my school stuff from the cupboard downstairs, while I collected my stuff in my room. We almost made it out without Uncle Vernon waking up, but I had forgotten Hedwig and she let out a loud screech to remind me of her. That woke up uncle Vernon and he came into my room when I was passing Hedwig to Ron inside the car. I climbed the chest of drawers and tried to get into the car, but Uncle Vernon had grabbed me by the ankle. Ron, Fred and George took hold of my arms and pulled as hard as they could, pulling me out of Uncle Vernon’s grip. When I was in the car, they stepped on the gas and we flew to the Weasley’s home.
“I deserve a break after watching you drool all over Draco the entire break,” Neville says.
Ron Weasley was also at the campsite, together with his brothers, his little sister, his father and Neville Longbottom. Fred and George greeted us with big smiles on their faces and Ginny was all shy around me. Ron said that she worshipped me still, even though it was clear I would never love her back. But more interesting were the older brothers, Bill and Charlie. Bill is a curse breaker with long hair and earrings and Charlie works with Dragons in Roumania. He’s got tattoos and burn marks all over his body. I think Ron didn’t like that we had more attention for his brothers than for him.
And yes, you read it right, I said painting my nails. It was a little after the second tasks that Draco, Greg, Daphne and I were sitting at the same table in the common room. Draco, Greg and I were doing some homework while Daphne was painting her nails. And for some time I wondered what it would look like if I would paint my nails. Not in the bright red’s and purple’s Daphne paints them, but in Slytherin green, or something else dark. So I asked Daphne if she had any dark green nail polish that I could borrow to paint my nails. She didn’t, but she got Millicent involved who did have darker colours of nail polish. That night Daphne and Millicent tried to teach me how to paint my nails, but I’m rubbish at it. That’s when Draco pitched in and let Daphne and Millicent show him how to do it. Ever since that night, he takes care of the paint on my nails as I take care of his hair. So each morning I braid his hair and once a week he fixes my nails. Millicent showed us where we can order the kind of nail polish I want to wear. Some other students think it’s stupid that a guy wears nail polish, but I like it. And Draco says it looks good on me, so I don’t see any reason to stop.
“Fuck,” Harry says. He turns around and then spots Neville on the floor. The next fuck that comes out of Harry’s mouth is softer. Slowly he crawls towards Neville’s body. Please don’t be dead is all he can think. Mum and dad will kill me if you are. So please, don’t be dead.
“Master Harry, please. You need to go now. The task is about the start,” Dobby repeats. He pulls on Harry’s robe and Harry starts to follow him out of the library. Ron doesn’t say a word. It feels like Harry has just lost his best friend. But he can’t think of that right now. He has a task to perform. Apparently, he has to go and save Malfoy from the mermaids. He’ll have to save the thing he will miss the most.
Ginny plods back to the sofa and pulls her legs under her butt. “Well, be quick. I’m meeting Luna in a bit to go on a hunt for Nargles.”
I don’t know what happened to Aunt Marge after that, I ran out of the room towards the cupboard under the stairs. The door burst open before I reached it. I think I did that too with my magic. I took my trunk out of the cupboard and then raced upstairs to grab the pillowcase with my books, letters and birthday cards. I sprinted back down and placed the pillowcase in my trunk. At that moment Uncle Vernon came into the hallway and ordered me to come back and put her right. I don’t know why, but I wanted to hurt Uncle Vernon at that moment. I grabbed my wand and pointed it at him. For a couple of seconds, I wanted to jinx him, to hurt him and punish him like he used to punish me. And then I thought of Draco and how disappointed he would be if I wouldn’t show up at school because I was in jail. And I thought of you, knowing you wouldn’t want me to hurt anyone. So I just opened the door behind me and left without saying a word.
“Okay, fine,” Neville says and then he turns to Ron. He makes eye contact and his eyebrows pinch together. “Ron, you can’t tell a soul,” he says. “Not even Hermione.”
And even though I first didn’t want to go, it was beautiful above the clouds. It was like being in a different world, with the sky a bright, endless blue under a blinding white sun. But after a couple of hours, it became less fun. It was warm and we had nothing to drink, and my glasses kept sliding down my sweaty nose.
“Yes,” Draco signs. “You’re mad?”
Tuesday 4 February 1992
“Hermione, how long does it take to get a bottle of champagne?” Draco shouts while he walks into the kitchen. “Fuck, I didn’t need to see that,” he continues when he spots Hermione, who sits on the counter, her legs wrapped around Ron’s hips. Ron’s trousers pushed down to his knees, his face panting in Hermione’s neck.
I also received a card from Greg. His family didn’t go on holiday, says they haven’t for years. Not since his brother died anyway. I still need to ask him about that and tell him I’m sorry. My trying to kill myself brought back a lot of nasty memories for him. He told me he’s been to visit Draco once this holiday and that Draco looks to be doing okay. He only talks about me all the time now I’m not around him. Greg begged me to tell him to stop obsessing about me so they can talk about Quidditch and stuff.
Ron claps his hands together. “I’m so going to win,” he says. The topic forgotten and replaced by the thrill of the chess game.
“Not what I was told during the DA meetings,” Harry laughs.
Harry vanishes Draco’s coat, his running shoes, his broom. The sweater left on the stairs. Harry’s favourite sweater that he never got to wear.
Harry takes Draco’s hand in his as soon as they sit down in Burke’s office. Draco doesn’t look at him. He’s focused on healer Burke who sits down in front of them. She takes out their file and Draco looks down at it. Only Burke doesn’t open the file. She just places her hand’s on top of it and looks at Draco.
Harry scrapes his throat. He looks out at the stars and a small tear falls from his eye. Draco reaches out and wipes the tear away. Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
After breakfast I took Hermione apart and told her about the voice I heard during detention. She doesn’t know what it is and that I shouldn’t worry about it. That maybe it was just me being tired. That he hadn’t been sleeping well, and that it was probably nothing. And maybe she is right, but I don’t know. It sounded real. And I don’t want to go crazy. Life is already hard enough without voices in my head.
“I still have to finish this essay,” Hermione says.
“So the rumours are true then?” Ginny asks. “Malfoy is a poof?”
It was a large, dimly lit wizard’s shop where I had ended up. But not one with supplies for Hogwarts. In a glass case nearby stood a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye. There were evil-looking masks on all the walls, some bones on a counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. And I was sure that the dark narrow street outside was not Diagon Alley. I was sure if I got caught here that I would be in big trouble. So when the bell at the door clanged, because someone was coming into the shop I hid inside a large black cabinet, leaving the door on a small crack to peer through.
The prefect gave us some simple rules, like that only Slytherins, are allowed to go into the common room and that boys and girls are not allowed to go to each other’s dormitories. I share my dormitory with Malfoy, Zabini, Nott, Goyle and Crabbe. There are no windows in the dormitory and the place is lilted by a green light hanging from the ceiling. The beds are four-posters hung with Slytherin green velvet curtains. Our trunks had already been brought up and placed by the separate beds. Mine is straight across of Malfoy’s bed. I had to wait until all the other boys were done in the bathrooms before I could go to brush my teeth. They didn’t want me in there with them. Zabini gave me an apologetic look when Malfoy forbade me to follow him. After I brushed my teeth in silence I quickly put on my pyjamas and went to bed. I closed the curtains and tried not to think of how mean the boys were being to me.
“Where is the woman?” Draco asked. He was sure he’d heard a woman scream this afternoon. But there was only a man in the small cell.
They walk on in silence for some time. Harry wonders what Snape could say to Malfoy to get him to go to all his classes. Malfoy hasn’t been all that happy with Snape of late. Not since Snape started to sign in class.
Hermione is back at school and that makes everything a little easier again. I still hate it here, nothing else has changed. Everyone still avoids me or looks at me like I’m going to hex them if they come to close. In the classes I don’t share with Hermione I sit alone, at the back, so no-one can look at me. Even the teachers ignore me. Only Professor Snape tries to include me in his classes. But that just makes it worse since I usually have no idea what the answers to his questions are supposed to be. So it ends up with me saying the wrong thing, having Nott and Crabbe laugh at me and the rest of my house angry because I lost them house points for not knowing the answers.
The Astronomy Tower is empty. Draco sits down at the edge. The one where he found Harry on that first night back after the summer holidays. He lays his hand on the spot where Harry would normally sit down beside him. Draco closes his eyes and thinks back to all the times when Harry would bend his head so it would rest on Draco’s shoulder. All the times their fingers lingered next to each other, both too afraid to take hold. Those nights had been perfect. Even the ones where they screamed at each other for all the hurt they conflicted on each other over the years, the ones where they were too scared to admit that the Dark Lord had returned and would always stand in between them, and the ones where they shared their tears.
“Ron, we’ll have to cancel dinner. I’ll explain why later. I don’t want to tell you over the floo. Just, you and Hermione can come over tomorrow, and I’ll explain.”
“Oh, don’t get me wrong. I will miss the little bugger. But it’s better for him. I’m getting too old for this. I won’t be able to play with him as you and Harry can. And he will still be here every other week. It’s not like I have to give him up completely.”
For my glasses, Miles knew a nice trick. He used Impervius on them so they would repel water. And then we were off again. It was still cold and wet, but at least I could see more. Lighting started to strike around us, and I was desperate to find the Snitch and be able to go back to the castle and crawl into a warm bed together with Draco. And then I saw it, the Grim. It was sitting at the topmost row of the stands. It freaked me out a little and I almost slipped off my broom. When I looked back up the dog was gone and I had to race towards the snitch, that was hovering in the space between me and Diggory.  I zoomed towards the snitch and then the entire stadium went silent. I was like I was suddenly deaf. And then a cold swept over me, inside me. When I looked down there were at least a hundred Dementors beneath me. And then I heard the screaming again. It was a woman, pleading: ‘Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry! Take me, kill me instead.’
That same day I also got my hands again on my Firebolt. Professor Snape told us that there was nothing wrong with it at all and that I have a very good friend somewhere. I couldn’t believe it when it was in my hands again. Draco was stroking the twigs at the end, just as in awe as me. We took it down into our common room. The moment I stepped inside I was flooded by people wanting to see my Firebolt. Marcus asked if he could just touch it, to know that it’s really real. Adrian was sure we would win from Ravenclaw now with no problem since they are all on Cleansweep Sevens. It took forever, with the Firebolt being passed around and admired from every angle by the crowd before Draco and I could get to our dormitory.
“What, why?” Ron asks. “Can’t you get the parchment by yourself?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asks.
When we got back to the tents everyone had settled around a nice fire and we eat some amazing sandwiches that Mrs Tonks had prepared for us. Sirius and Tonks were having a loud discussion about who would win the match and Draco and I sneaked off to the woods behind the tents to have a nice little snug fest. Before we got back to the tent again we bought some omnioculars, very fancy magical binoculars that can replay, slow down and have flash up play-by-play breakdown.
I thought of Draco, far away at the Hogwarts grounds. He would feel the pain and despair I’d lived through during the second tasks. He would be incomplete for the rest of his life. And I would do that to him. Tears fell from my eyes, knowing I would hurt him more than anyone could ever do. He would be alone and broken. I wished I could have held him one last time, kissed his lips goodbye and watch him sleep next to me.
“Doing my homework with Malfoy and practising BSL with him,” Harry answers. He won’t be able to keep it from his friends and Hermione was right. Ron and Neville won’t make fun of it.
Harry follows him and sits down at the table in front of Malfoy. He takes out the note he scribbled last night. Well, the fourth or fifth one he wrote. They all sounded so lame. So, Harry has gone for simple in the end. Just the words: ‘We’d like to help. You can copy Hermione’s notes.’ No elaborate explanations about how Harry understands because his uncle is deaf. Because the truth is, Harry doesn’t understand. He doesn’t get why Malfoy’s situation isn’t known with the teachers. Or how he got by the last two years at school. And how does Malfoy even communicate with his parents? It’s all so confusing. The only thing Harry does know is that he can’t stop thinking about it and that he needs to act. He needs to do something.
“Are you ready to tell me why you couldn’t come with me to pick up Teddy?” Harry asks.
Lucius sits down next to Draco and nods his approval. Draco’s deed has put him back into the Dark Lord’s good books. He will be forgiven for losing the diary. Draco still doesn’t understand. What was so special about an old diary that it would anger the Dark Lord in the way it did? Draco told Harry what had happened last summer. How Lucius had been tortured and wasn’t able to stop shivering for days after, all because of that one diary.
I’m confused. Something happened on the train back to London and I don’t know what it means. I wish Hedwig wasn’t locked in her cage so I could send Hermione a letter and ask her what she thinks. Because I think it means he likes me like really likes me. As in he wants to be my boyfriend likes me. And I don’t know if that is what I want. I like hanging out with him, he makes me feel safe. But does that mean I like him too? I just don’t know. And what if I’m wrong? What if it just means we are good friends? I can do that. I think. But it’s different with him than with Hermione. I want to be close to him whenever I can. And I don’t miss Hermione as much as I miss him. Mom, does that mean I like him more than just friends? I just don’t know. And I don’t know what to do. I wish you were here to help me figure this all out. I miss you both so much.
When I had finished I was sent upstairs, where I had to pretend that I wasn’t here. Only there was one little problem. When I walked into my room something was sitting on my bed. It was a little creature, with large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. It were the same eyes I had seen in the hedge earlier that day. As soon as the creature saw me he slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its nose touched the carpet. He said it was an honour to meet me. He told me his name was Dobby and that he was a house-elf. And everything went downhill from there.
“You’re coming, Harry?” he asks.
Harry James Potter.
Professor Snape had already informed Sirius the night of the Halloween feast and he’d written me a letter back straight away, which arrived the next morning. He’s also worried and he said he would see if he can come and watch me at all the trials. He’s afraid that Moody might have a point about somebody wanting me dead. He told me to stay clear of Karkaroff, that he’s a former follower of Voldemort and that he might have ill feelings about me. Draco laughed at that, said that it wasn’t me defeating the Dark Lord that made Karkaroff hate me, that he had a bigger problem with us being a couple and kissing right in front of him.
“Shit, man. I can’t believe they attacked you,” Neville says as he sits back down. “You had some chocolate?”
Harry turns and looks at Hermione. She has her book closed on her lap and watches Harry with narrowed eyes.
“The Dark Lord will return,” Pettigrew says. “You will see how right the world will be when he does.” Pettigrew bends his head to the side. His front teeth stick out of his mouth. He’s got a pointy nose and small dark eyes. He’s not only a rat in name and actions. He’s also a rat in his looks. A disgusting rat.
“Oh, Harry, don’t be all bothered,” Hermione says. “You know why I think it’s stupid. Not because it’s a bad plan, but because I don’t think Malfoy wants our help. He’s not going to copy my notes,” she explains.
Draco smiled and looked back at the potion. He would have loved to have seen how the potion works. For a moment he was tempted to get a spoon and feed it to the man in the cell. But then his father and mother would know he’d been down into the forbidden rooms. Draco let it be and made sure he would follow his father down when he would continue his work.
Only the match never happened. Professor McGonagall came onto the field before they could start, holding an enormous purple megaphone. She announced that the game had been cancelled and that all students must make their way back to the House common rooms, where our Heads of Houses will give us further information. I had just left the stands when Professor Snape walked up to me and asked me to come with him. First I thought they suspected me again and that I would sure be expelled now. But it was much worse than that. Professor Snape didn’t take me to his office, or headmaster Dumbledore’s office. No, he took me to the hospital wing. He explained that there had been another attack and when we entered the hospital wing I could see her.
James shakes his head and then closes the door behind him. He takes one of the desk chairs and sits in front of the boys. “Neville, I understand. I hate him too,” he says. “Because of him, we lost some pretty awesome people. Fuck, we almost lost Sirius. He’d been my friend for years. All through school and then in the few years after. I want him dead. It takes a lot of effort not to just go after him and put myself in danger. But I don’t. Because I’ve got both of you, and Iris and Lily. And Sirius will hunt my ghost down and torture me even after I’m dead if I do anything that stupid.”
“Okay,” Hermione says. Her brow furrows and her jaw is set. She makes eye contact with Neville. “We’re going to catch that rat as soon as possible.”
Harry doesn’t look up from his broom when James sits down on the bench.
Draco is telling me not to worry, that we’ll be off to Hogwarts soon and that the Dark Lord is terrified of Dumbledore so that we will be safe as long as we are at school. And that he’s hungry, so I should stop writing and make him breakfast.
Draco pushes Harry away. “Stop,” he signs. “You’re making me blush.”
Malfoy looks up from his book when Hermione sits down next to him. He raises his eyebrows and closes his book. Harry pushes his note toward Malfoy quickly before he stands up and finds a new spot to sit. Malfoy picks up the note and reads it. He looks at Hermione and then at Harry. Harry smiles at Malfoy in the hope he understands that they just want to be friendly. Draco clenches his hand around the note and he shakes his head. With force, he pushes the note back into Harry’s hands. Then he grabs his bag, stands up and walks to another table.
Draco stares at her. She said ‘kill them too’. Does that mean that it’s over? That all hope is truly lost?
And then they arrived. Man in black cloaks and masked. They approached Voldemort on their knees and kissed the hem of his robe, calling him master. Then they would back up and stand. A circle formed around Voldemort, with gaps in between, like more people should still come. But Voldemort started to talk. He was not happy with the Death Eaters. Went on and on about how they never went looking for him and help him. One of the men asked for forgiveness and was punished by receiving the Curcio curse. Voldemort told them they should all serve them for thirteen years before he would even think of forgiving them. He then rewarded Wormtail for his help by giving him a silver hand that took the place of the hand he had chopped off.
“I don’t want to go,” Draco signs.
Draco forces the meat into his mouth and chews slowly. He can’t show his despair. The other Death Eaters will eat him alive if they ever find out that Draco is a traitor in their midst. The meat is prepared perfectly. The elves know who to prepare a good meal. Draco used to love their cooking. Now it’s a shame. He can’t enjoy it any longer. Everything is tainted by the Dark Lord.
Later that evening I told Draco that even though it was horrible to hear the last moments of my parents replayed inside my head, that it was also the only time I had heard your voices since I was a very small child. Draco kissed me and told me I shouldn’t chase their echoes, that it won’t bring them back. And I know he’s right, but I kind of want to hear you both again.
The red light slams into an invisible shield in front of Harry. Draco sits on the floor, Harry’s wand in his hand. He smiles at Harry and then he turns around. He faces Pettigrew. He’s going to stop him. Helpless Draco, the boy Harry thought he had to protect and save. He’s going to be the one that saves the day. The one that captures Pettigrew. It’s so unlikely, and so amazing at the same time. Harry wants to kiss him again. He knows he can’t. And he won’t. But he wants to, so badly.
Harry has no idea how long they fly around. It goes slow and they stay low to the ground. Draco does venture a little higher after a while, but not far enough to experience that true feeling of freedom that Harry gets when he’s on a broom, high in the sky, with nothing but the wind around him.
Harry blinks his eyes. The room is filled with light.
This Saturday Draco and his mother met Mrs Tonks and me in Diagon Alley to do all our shopping for this school year. I wrote to Hermione and she promised to come as well. Our first stop was Quality Quidditch Supplies. Draco had told me about the new broom that came out just two weeks ago: the Firebolt. We went to go take a look and had to manoeuvre around other people to take a good look at it. It’s a beautiful broom and has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds. The Irish International Side is going to use them this season. I wish I was bold enough to buy myself one, but my Nimbus 2001 is a perfectly good broom. Draco begged his mother for one. I’ve never seen Draco beg like that before. He really uses all his little tricks, teary pleading eyes, promises of studying hard and buying his mother the best Christmas present ever. It didn’t work though. His mother told him he just got a new broom last year that will be just fine. Draco was a bit cranky after that. But not for long after I pulled him into a little nook and give him a proper kiss, he was smiling again after that.
What happened next was sickening. Wormtail brought out a cauldron and started a fire underneath it. He then took the bundle of cloth and took out a creature that looked like a small child, but it had a face with bright red eyes and a snakelike nose. Its arms and legs were thin and tiny. It looked horrible and I knew it was truly evil. My scar hurt again when I looked at it. Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron and I wished it would drown. That would have been so much better than what really happened.
Blaise’s eyes stay on Draco, and Harry feels grateful knowing he's not the only one concerned about Draco's wellbeing. And it’s a legitimate question. One Harry has been asking himself for weeks now.
“And who makes you smile like that?” James asks.
And then, out of nowhere, something hit Draco hard across his face, knocking him off his feet, landing on the floor beside me. Neville and Hermione also got hit and we all ended up on the floor. I lifted my wand and made light come from it to see what was happening. It turned out we had moved to close to the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking and whipping around to stop us from getting any nearer.
The Auror’s wife looks at Draco, and then she tells her husband to stop talking and let it be.
“Don’t talk about him like that,” Hermione says.
James gives Harry a knowing look. “The Quidditch World Cup? Why would you want to go there?” he jokes.
Iris’ eyes widen and Harry puts his arm around her. “It’s okay, he won’t hurt us,” Harry says.
“What, just look at him. He’s pale and unresponsive. Clear signs of going mental,” Ron says.
“I don’t want to be alone,” Draco stutters.
“Yes, fuck, of course, I’m angry. I was told our baby will never get born, and then they tell us we have to sit around for another week just so that they can cover their asses. So yes, I’m angry,” Harry screams.
Draco looks confused, unaware of the terror raising inside Harry. He blinks but doesn’t say a word. Harry wants to slap him, wants to hurt him for doing this to them. He said he would never take them again.
The smile forms completely as Malfoy writes again. ‘I was afraid of that. You do know I’m in Slytherin, don’t you?’
“Please, Draco, I don’t want to die.”
‘I should go,’ Draco writes.
‘You can never do that again! If it wasn’t for Headmaster Dumbledore you would be dead. And I can’t lose my best friend. I already lost one before. I can’t do that again. And I haven’t even shown you the sign I came up with for my name. I need you to learn to say my name.’
“He’s dead, mother,” Draco says as he sits up a little straighter. He reaches for his wand and closes the door. The silencing wards go up and then the wand drops to the floor. Draco watches it roll against the bedside table. The dark wood almost invisible on the wooden floor.
“Harry, please tell Hermione that it’s my job to worry,” Ron says.
“What does that mean?” Harry asks.
Remus looks up from the work on his desk when Harry walks into his office.
Last week, Draco and I had to come to Professor Snape’s office for a short talk. Nothing to worry about, he just wanted to make sure that we are both doing okay. I think we scared him good with almost dying a couple of times. He complimented me on my good marks for potions. And then he brought up our sleeping arrangements. It seems that Nott has been complaining. We had to promise Professor Snape that we would start using our own beds for now. We promised, but haven’t really kept to that promise. Now Draco just waits for everyone to fall asleep before he makes his way over to my bed. I’m glad he does that. I just sleep so much better with his arms around me.
“Thank you, Uncle Remus,” Harry says.
Another soft kiss lands on Draco’s forehead. “I’ll get him,” Harry says and then he’s out of bed. Draco can hear him on the baby monitor, suiting Nathan as he takes their little boy out of his crib. “Daddy isn’t feeling great right now, so you’ll have to do with me,” Harry tells Nathan. He says more things, but he moves out of reach of the baby monitor and Draco can’t hear it. He does hear Harry walk down the stairs and he signs. He’s not been this sick since he was pregnant with Lily. Nathan was a ride in the park compared to her. Probably also because Draco wasn’t scared all the time that it would go wrong and that he would break Harry’s heart again. But the lack of nausea was a big bonus too.
We went to the Apothecary to replenish our store of potions ingredients. Draco helped us to pick the perfect ones, told me off when I just pick the ones on top without inspecting them. He loved helping me, hanging over me and touching all the time. Hermione wanted to know all about my troubles during the holidays with my family and was amazed I wasn’t expelled. I told her I was too, that for a little moment I was scared I would be sent to jail for what I did. This made Draco laugh, joking that it would make the news if the Boy Who Lived would be incarcerated. After that Draco asked Hermione how France was and she told us all about the interesting wizard history there.
“Why do you need parchment and a quill?” Ron asks.
Ron bumps into Harry’s shoulder. “Just remember you can’t make fun of this teacher with Neville without him understanding.”
Remus’ face snaps towards Harry. His eyes are wide and dark. “What do you mean?” he asks.
Harry closes his eyes and shakes his head. He doesn’t have a crush, he’s in love. It’s different. More painful than he ever thought it could be.
Burke goes over what will happen, explains what it would look like and asks them to call once it is done to make another appointment for a check-up scan. Harry asks if this will be done with magic instead and Draco is glad to hear Burke confirm this. Draco doesn’t think he can survive another scan like this. He wants it to be over so that he can go on his holiday to Greece next week. Not that it will be a happy holiday, but at least he will be away from London. Now that the Auror in the waiting room figured out that Harry and Draco have lost an unborn child, it’s sure to be in the Prophet tomorrow. And that will bring the letters and cards, the good and the bad all mixed up with each other, just like after the wedding. Draco is not sure if he’s up to the attention. He just wants to grieve in peace, preferably with Harry’s arms around him.
In the afternoon we hat Magical Theory for two hours. And since the only empty spot in the class was next to Hermione when I came in after hiding in the bathroom all of lunch I was saved from getting bullied during this class. We went and did our homework in the library again. I waited till almost eight to go down for dinner and I was happy to see that my classmate had already finished, so I finally had a decent meal. I cried myself to sleep that night. I felt so alone. Mom, I don’t understand why they have to be so mean. Is it just because I didn’t want to shake Malfoy’s hand during the train ride to Hogwarts?
“Good job,” Lily says. If Draco would be awake he would roll his eyes now and then point a finger at Harry, saying it was all his fault for letting his teacher side slip into their daily lives with a smile on his face. Harry never realised how often he says things like ‘good job’ when talking to his children, or his students even, until Lily started to repeat everything he says. Kids can be scary mirrors sometimes. Not that Harry would ever want to live without them, he loves his little once. Even Teddy, who only agreed to go to Hogwarts after Harry fire called the headmistress to make sure he was allowed to come home when his little sister would get born.
The next day, Professor Snape asked me and Draco to come to his office. He wanted to talk to us before we went home. He said that he had to take up a role for the resistance that would put him in a dark light. Draco asked him point-blank if he was going back to following the Dark Lord. Professor Snape assured us that he would never, that he would do anything in his power to protect both me and Draco, and his other students. But he would also have to do things that he won’t always be able to explain and he asked us to trust that he will never betray us. We talked about it later, back at home, where nobody could overhear us. We think that Professor Snape is spying on Voldemort, by pretending he’s still a Death Eater.
Malfoy smiles at Harry. His fist comes up again but now he shakes it. Harry gives a huge smile back. He’s proud of how Malfoy is using the signs Harry taught him. It stirs something inside Harry. It gives him the urge to lean forward and kiss Malfoy. But he can’t do that. Not now they’ve just become friends. Harry needs to do this the right way. He needs to talk, to find out what Malfoy likes. And then maybe, if Harry can find that Gryffindor courage again. For now, he just takes a deep breath. He has something to sort out first.
“Okay,” Draco answers. He wants to look away from Harry’s eyes. Away from the love that shines through. Somehow this little question made Harry forget all about the fight they just had, and Draco doesn’t understand. Just like he doesn’t know why he hates Pansy so much right now. Pansy who just had a baby boy.
“She wasn’t kidnapped, Weasel,” Malfoy says from Harry’s other side. He sits next to Harry, their hands close to each other. Malfoy’s pinkie on top of Harry’s below the blanket that falls around them to keep them warm.
Off course I got a lot of other presents. Hermione gave me a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland (which Draco is reading right now), Sirius got me a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot, Hagrid had sent me a box of all my favourite sweets. Ron and his mother had gotten me a sweater, a green one with a dragon on it. Draco also received a sweater from Ron’s mother with a little note that said he would always have a home at the Weasley’s if he ever needed one. But the best present was from Draco. When all the others had left the dormitory he gave me a small box that contained a ring which beard the Malfoy crest. He said he wanted me to have it since I was his family now. As you might understand, that ring hasn’t left my hand ever since I put it on. Daphne joked it looked like we were married already, but that she still expects to organise an elaborate wedding party for us one day.
The answer is simple. Draco signs: “Dad.” And then he looks away and out of the window. Harry follows his gaze. The sky is black and the lights reflect in the window.
“Well, I’ve never seen a blue cow. And I’m sure that if they exist, that no Muggle has ever seen them. You should ask Luna the next time she’s over if there are blue cows. I’m sure that she will know.”
But it’s time now for our little study meeting.
At once, the cup is back on the table, and Teddy whispers that it’s not allowed. He turns towards Harry and asks him to hand him his tea. Harry stands up and gives Teddy his hot cup of tea. Once it’s safe in Teddy’s hands, Harry places a kiss on top of his head. Teddy blushes and a smile forms on his face.
“Ron, what did you do now?” Harry asks.
“I think I’m ready to stop with the birth control potions,” Draco says.
“I’m going to see if Molly made her famous lemonade,” Draco says.
The blasts from the commotion came closer and closer and Draco took out his wand and light it up. I tried to get mine, but somehow I’d had lost it. We looked around with the light of Draco’s wand but couldn’t find it. It made me feel vulnerable and I was glad Draco was with me, knowing he would protect me if it was necessary.
Harry shakes his head. “I like it here,” he says.
“He’s glad you try, but he can’t understand you,” Harry translates.
Harry James Potter
And now all I have to do is wait for the 1
Mom and Dad,
“Hermione doesn’t fly?” Draco asks.
Draco and Neville search the map. Harry wants to join in, but that will mean he’ll have to lean over Draco. And no matter how much Harry would love to do nothing else, it’s too dangerous. What if Harry does something stupid? He can’t control himself if he tempts faith. Instead, he picks up a sandwich and eats and just watches as Draco and Neville pore over the map.
“With magic bubbles?” Teddy asks. Harry nods in conformation. It’s all that is needed to get Teddy out of the room, already running up the stairs to the bathroom.
“I like that,” Harry says. “James Scorpius Potter.”
“I love you. We’ll be down in a couple of minutes, and then we can all have some hot chocolate,” Harry says, and then he’s gone. Draco looks at the mess he made. He waves his wand around to clean up all the glass that is covering the floor. And then he pulls a blanket over himself and hides away from the world.
Love you,
“He doesn’t understand signs,” Harry informs Remus.
Draco and I had a fight. About a week ago, a notice went up to announce the first Hogsmeade weekend for this coming Halloween. Draco wants to stay in the castle with me, and I told him not to be stupid and go with our friends and enjoy the day away. He thinks it won’t be any fun without me. And to be honest, I would like him to stay behind with me. I hate Halloween. I’m sure you understand why. But I don’t want to take away this experience from Draco. He deserves to have fun with Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Hermione. We didn’t agree on anything, just yelled at each other and then both sat on different sides of the common room until it was time for bed. For a little while, I was afraid Draco won’t come to sleep in my bed, but after a couple of minutes, he came anyway. He said he was sorry and that he loves me. I told him I was sorry too.
Harry jumps from his seat and hugs his dad. “Thank you, thank you,” he shouts. He can’t stay still. He lets go of his dad and walks up and down next to the bench. “We’re really going?” he asks.
"No, he's not, " Harry says. "And he won't, he's hurting but he's not stupid." Harry doesn’t know if he still believes that himself. Every time he goes to work, he’s afraid he’s going to come home to an empty house. That Draco will be gone to find a potion that will make him stop feeling a thing. Or find him high, or dead in their bed, as it looks like Draco doesn’t care at all anymore.
“And what if it still doesn’t happen? Are there any other options?” Harry asks. He still sounds so hopeful, so determent to make this happen. Draco doesn’t have that hope now that it’s clear that this is all his fault, just like he thought. He doesn’t believe there is anything left to say. He wants to go home and crawl back into his bed and forget this conversation ever happened. At least then he could still pretend that this wasn’t his fault. Now he knows for sure. Not that he will ever tell Harry. He can’t stand the thought of losing him too.
It doesn’t take long until Draco stops biting his lip and a smile forms on his face. Harry smiles with him. Draco is flying. He might not be able to get a broom to fly yet, but he can fly on a broom given to him by someone else. They fly close to the ground, but they do speed up a bit. They circle around the pitch. At some point, Harry lifts a little higher, but Draco shakes his head. He’s not ready to go higher, so Harry moves back to his level.
“It’s about Malfoy,” Harry says.
“Harry, have you even started on the Charms essay?” Hermione asks.
Harry rubs his fist over his chest. “I’m sorry,” he says. And then he pulls the parchment to him again. ‘I’ve done something behind your back that I should have talked to you about first,’ he writes.
“Are they boyfriends?” Iris asks.
“Are you even listening to me?” Harry yells. “Bloody hell, Draco. We don’t have to have a baby. I don’t want it. Not like this. I know I always said I wanted a family, children of our own. But not like this, not if it means I lose you in the process. You are my world, and I love you. I will always love you, no matter what.” As soon as Harry says it, he knows it’s true. It’s not like he suddenly doesn’t want to have children anymore, but he knows for sure he can give them up if it means he gets Draco back.
Before we knew it the time to go back home had come. I packed my trunk thinking Hogwarts had become more my home than Privet Drive. And I was right. This place doesn’t feel like home anymore. Draco said he would write to me as often as possible. I didn’t think I would be able to write back to him, because I was sure Uncle Vernon would lock up Hedwig as soon as I would come home, just like he had done before I went to school last September. Draco had a solution for that. He said I should write the letter, and then, when his owl would deliver his letter, I could attach my letter to his owl. And now I’m scared his letter will arrive and I won’t have anything to send back to him, because I don’t know   Well, I’ll get to that in a bit.
Ron, Draco and Harry pull Neville back to the table. Neville plants his hands on the surface and refuses to sit down.
“You’ll have to wait until he shows himself,” Neville says. “He’s our only friend in Slytherin. And there is no way any of his housemates are going to let you in their dungeon.”
“Are you okay, dear?” Andromeda asks. Draco shakes his head and Andromeda puts down the decoration she was just about to put on Teddy’s cake. Her arm slides around Draco’s waist, and she pulls him close. “I know, you don’t have to explain,” she says. Draco lets her touch and soft words comfort him. “I used to look at Ted and Nymphadora like that, hoping against hope that our family would grow sooner than later. I hope your story will have a happier end then mine,” Andromeda finishes. Draco puts his arm around his aunt's shoulders and whispers a thank you in her ear.
Ron walks into the classroom and stops next to their seats. “Why is Hermione not next to Malfoy?” he asks.
“Draco’s mum finally wrote back to me,” James says.
“You tensed up,” Draco signs.
Lucius’ head turns red and he raises his fists. “You are disgusting,” he spits. “You will be no son of mine if you continue like this.”
“Oh, this is fun,” Luna says. “We’ll all be able to chat without Draco feeling left out.”
Inside the house, I ended up in a room with boarded-up windows. There was a chair, a giant snake and that traitor Wormtail. A cold, high-pitched voice spoke to him. Told him he was lucky, that his blunder hadn’t ruined everything. He still got tortured, but I didn’t felt sorry for him. I hate that man. He’s worse than the Dark Lord for betraying the both of you. But I did feel his pain as my scar burned on my forehead. I screamed until I heard Draco’s voice, screaming my voice, telling me to wake up.
Draco shakes his head. “I don’t mind,” he signs.
Tuesday 22 November 1994
“And he’s deaf, Harry,” James continues as if Harry hadn’t even responded. “That is. Well, it makes things even more complicated.”
Harry looks at the piece of fabric that has fallen from the envelope. It’s just a piece of fabric. Harry looks into the envelope again. There is nothing else in there. No explanation or even a note of who it’s from.
“No,” Draco says without looking at Harry.
“Harry’s sperm count is above average, and the little buggers are active. There are no indications that anything that happened to you during the war had any effect on your fertility. And for Draco, his blood tests were all clear, and as we’ve seen in previous scans, his inner organs all look healthy, and there are no signs of obstructions. This means there are no clear signs of why it isn’t happening,” Burke continues. Draco only listens with half his mind. He knows why they couldn’t find anything wrong with them. It’s not his body that is blocking this; it’s his karma or whatever you want to call it. He brought this on them, with all his stupid decisions during the war. There is no other explanation. And once Harry will figure this out, he will leave to find someone that will be able to give him the family he so desires.
Dear mom and dad,
“Hi Harry,” Remus says. “You want to go for a walk around the grounds?” Remus points out the window. “It’s a beautiful day, and I’ve been stuck inside all day.”
“Go,” Remus says with a wave of his hand. “Go talk to Malfoy and let me know what he wants.”
Well, maybe they have a chance this year. Harry was stupid enough to fly into a massive rain cloud to catch that Snitch and almost die in the process, allowing Zabini to win the game. Wood won’t shut up about it. It’s not that Harry planned to be cornered by Dementors and fall off his broom and almost die. Fuck, he only flew so high to catch the Snitch. Wood shouldn’t complain. He should be proud that Harry risked his life to win the game. It’s not his fault that Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw will be easy victories. Cho is good, but her team is lousy. She needs to catch the Snitch before they fall too far behind in points, and Harry will make sure that won’t happen. And Harry only ever lets the games against Hufflepuff go on longer than necessary so he can enjoy the view of Digory on a broom. And no lady, or gay man, would be sad about that. The guy is fit. Not as beautiful as Draco, but still hot as hell. The only issue is that Slytherin will also be able to beat them with ease. Even with Zabini as their Seeker. Draco will be happy about it. His house will win this year if Digory can’t get his team to beat Slytherin.
And Draco is staying at the castle this Christmas holiday to keep me company. I’m really looking forward to having the dormitories to ourselves. Nobody to complain that we snug too much or should stop being so obviously in love. The other students are leaving on Friday.
“Calm down, Nev, I’m fine. We both are,” Harry says. He doesn’t want Malfoy to run away. For some reason, he wants to keep him close and make sure he’s truly fine.
“What do you think? You ready to get out of bed? I’ve got your coffee ready downstairs,” Harry says.
“Do we have any white in there?” he asks.
Hagrid let us out the back of his cabin after that because Dumbledore, Minister Fudge, a committee member and the executioner were already on their way to his cabin. Hermione had put Scrabbers in her pocket and Draco pulled us both close again while I threw the cloak over us. We took one last look at Buckbeak and then hurried around Hagrid’s cabin. Hermione whispered that she wanted to hurry. Tears were falling down her face and Draco pulled her even closer. We could hear the door open behind us and then we heard men’s voices while we hurried up the path. The men behind us went silent and then we could hear the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe. Both I and Hermione hid our faces against Draco’s shoulders and he pulled us both even closer against him. I was really glad he was there with us, otherwise Hermione and I had just ended up sitting there on the floor crying in each other's arms.
Or maybe staying awake is better.
“You will do what I tell you to,” Lucius shouts. He stands up and his lips tremble.
Wednesday was a little better. I woke up early again and went outside to fly my broom a little. It was nice to fly, even though it makes me miss Draco even more than I already do. It’s weird to see his drapes open at night, his bed perfectly made up. I miss the sounds he makes at night. I even miss his crying. Isn’t that pathetic of me? He doesn’t want to do anything to do with me and I still miss him now that he’s not here. After I was done flying around I landed on the other side of the lake and just sat there looking at the frozen water. I don’t know how long I sat there, but I was freezing when I made my way back to the castle. When I got to the dungeon Nott and Crabbe were nowhere to be seen, so I changed a quick shower to warm up. That was a big mistake. They came back while I was under the shower and they stole my clothes and my towel from the bathroom and had to walk back to our dormitory naked. Pansy thought it was very funny. I don’t know what they did with my clothes, I haven’t gotten them back or found them anywhere and that makes me sad because it was the sweater Mrs Weasley had made for me last year. It was so comfy and Draco also liked it. He said it looked good on me. Probably because it was one of the only clothes I possess that fit me. All my other clothes are old clothes of Dudley and they are too big for me.
Neville laughs. “You’ve got it bad. You can’t keep that from him.”
“Okay,” Draco signs.
“And when will you catch up? How long will you keep me waiting?” Harry says while he takes a step closer to Draco. They are only inches apart. Draco can feel Harry’s breath against his skin, feel the warmed of his body close to his. His pulse races and Draco swallows away his nerves. Harry’s eyes look down at Draco’s throat for a split second before he looks back into Draco’s eyes. The same intensity that Draco feels shines in them and it all the encouragement he needs to lean forward and place his lips against Harry’s. Draco hadn’t expected Harry’s lips to feel so soft. They always look dry.
Neville shakes his head. “I would have saved her even when I wasn’t the Chosen One.”
Everyone was very excited to learn more about this Chamber, but professor Binns said it was all nonsense. That the school had been searched and that no such chamber excited. I didn’t really listen to all the questions the other students threw at professor Binns. I was more worried about Draco’s pale face. He had been looking out the window since the chamber had been brought up. The whole subject made him feel uncomfortable and that worries me. What if he knows something about all this? What if he’s the one who wrote that message on the wall and petrified Mrs Norris? Would Draco really be capable of doing that?
Harry just shakes his head as he uses all his force to keep Malfoy’s first inches from his chest. Harry doesn’t feel like having to visit the hospital wing on his first night back. He can already envision the letter he will receive from his mother once she hears.
