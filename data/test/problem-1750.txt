The kitchen is painted a pale robin's egg blue. Neatly affixed on the wall is a chore chart, and Draco's name scribed between his two roommates. Underneath, Eltanin's name glows red.
"No! Er, I mean. Shouldn't you offer me tea instead? Isn't that what a polite host would do? Make tea?"
Draco’s world inverts when Harry saves his life. “Pay it off,” Father hisses from behind bars, so Draco tries. He forces his way into the Aurors, onto Harry’s missions, into any possible opportunity to even the scales. But instead, Draco’s debt only grows when Harry saves him so often that Draco finds himself transforming, morphing into something of Harry’s making. Like in breathing on borrowed time, he’s become something to own.
"I'll. I'll just—" Harry really should leave, but he can see the outlines of a living room behind Eltanin's silhouette. The walls are a creamy canary yellow, the floor the kind of lamination that does a decent job pretending to be hardwood. The couch is a lumpy moss-green fabric monster strewn with tangled fleece blankets and mismatched pillows.
It is a windswept day, and the sky bleeds grey into the sea. Harry thinks his time left is like a blowsy yellow, warm as Draco’s hand. He wants to tell Draco to never let him go, but what’s the use in that?
“How long is this going to last?” Potter asked Pansy when he dropped Draco off again the following week.
Harry considers it. Most of Ginny's secrets tumble out sooner or later. He could handle waiting. But Malfoy…
"You're certainly taking your time," Draco says when Harry catches him watching. Draco's shirt is half-open, and the top button of his trousers is undone.
In his trunk he found his Hogwarts texts, quills, robes—straight to the fire. His father's letters and ring—burned as well. His mother's favourite novel:
Then it's Saturday night at Nylon, and Malfoy's already there at the bar with his shirt off and his tats on display. Malfoy catches sight of Harry looking (of course Harry is; as if he could look away from that inky dragon crawling up Malfoy's back) and waves him over.
"Oh, shut up." Draco chuckled. "Are you going to demand tea again? I could do with a break from the quill."
Fill me up with the good stuff. Ice cream and peaches and ribbons of whipped cream lace. Apple pie and oven-warm mitts round and around my waist. Blueberries boiled down so they’re thick again. Four or five plates, then a few more of those little dishes for sugar and butter and melty chocolate flakes, to taste. My taste is more like a space than sense. It wants to take up room. It tells me, fill me up with the good stuff. Swallow up your love and keep me company where it’s dark inside.
There's a new wreath at the front of his house made of dried branches and autumn leaves. Miniature Snitches weave in and out of the foliage, humming sweetly when Harry pulls open the door to see light streaming down from the newly installed skylights. Harry drops his car keys in a shallow ceramic dish that Teddy moulded during art class at school. The giant lightning bolt painted across the bottom flashes once in cheeky greeting, too lemon-yellow to remind Harry of his scar.
Draco snorts. "The whole block knows that, Granger." He casts his gaze out the window before turning to look Hermione straight in the eye. "But do you?"
. You've got a billion-Galleon idea locked up in your gym. And you built it, what? Over the weekend?"
They’ve been pushing ninety-nine in a sixty-five. Harry can’t explain why he keeps wanting stupid things like this, like Draco. He should slow down or put his foot down or go and have his meltdown at home or something, but he’s too stupid on want to do anything except keep his hands on the wheel and his eyes straight ahead.
Harry pulls out the last remaining robe he has left in his closet, the one he wears to trials and memorials and traditional weddings. It's black and crimson with a lion's head embroidered on the lapels. He remembers loving it when he first bought it—the most expensive garment he's owned in his life—but the magic has washed out with time, and the lion roars in a languid, drunken way.
Harry took the bag. It crinkled under his fist, crackling like lightning down his spine. Desperately, he missed the quiet behind the door.
"He's like a vengeful sex demon after he's lost," Harry confesses in the privacy of Hermione's kitchen. "A lustful, bitter jackhammer."
“Alright, I won’t,” Draco said, and let the words clog up thick in his chest. He looked at his hands. To them, he asked, “But, am I? Surprising? Do I surprise you?”
Wax drips down the walls to the dungeon. Inside the mirror, I see what I desire most desperately. But Potter is not as lovely as the mirror claims. Shadows carve across his face as he turns to me, fingers white over the edge of Luna's cot. There is something so lonesome in his eyes that I, well. I start seeing myself.
“I wouldn’t touch that,” I call from halfway up a ladder, my right hand pressed against gold-threaded book spines, searching for a title that slipped my mind the moment my ex walked in.
Harry casts a cautious glance down at Malfoy's face. "I get that a lot," he repeats slowly. "But not usually from you." At least not lately, anyway. What happened to all that talk about what Harry deserved? "What did I do this time?"
. Can't imagine what that'd be like. I reckon he's no fun at all, just cries over how nobody cares about old Voldy anymore."
“That’s what they were like,” Draco defends with a tiny growl, though he knows he’s taken the metaphor too far. He’s always doing that, roping people in only to buck them off when he rides too fast. Like a bloody American bronco.
Harry silents him with a weak spell, magic dissipating quickly in the wind. He smoothes a thumb over Draco’s lips in apology. Draco never understands. Still, Harry tries.
They were having breakfast like they always did: Draco carefully cutting the crusts off his toast, Harry upending half the sugar into his tea, Pansy snapping at every noise that distracted from her paper. (Pansy wasted no time in setting up house rules now that she was an official resident, though there was only one item on the list: keep the bloody toilet seat down after you flush.)
Harry keeps rolling off the bare mattress on the floor of his bedroom throughout the night, waking in a tangle of limbs with creases on his cheek from the floorboards. He does a lap around the barren townhouse and clocks an hour on the BroomBod. He snapped off the ugly industrial shower head in his bathroom last night, so he's forced to turn a wand on himself to get clean.
Harry recalls the boys in the office, red-faced and squirming in overstuffed chairs; their glue-on moustaches drooped pathetically over gaping mouths. He can’t help but laugh.
The room tilted, and Draco found himself on Harry's lap. "I think I'm in love with you," he sighed, draping his arms over Harry's shoulders and tucking his face into the crook of Harry's neck. His fingers brushed the toilet lid, the cold porcelain bringing an unwelcome splash of clarity. Fuck. What was he doing? He'dd been
Malfoy's wearing charcoal-grey joggers and a tee that rides up his stomach, his hair half-fucked and sleepy. Harry knows an opportunity when he sees one. He lowers his voice. "You want to come in?"
It’s a beautiful day outside. The sky is an endless expanse of blue, and Harry’s dizzy marvelling over how big it is, all of it. It’s hard to imagine that people have ever died on these grounds; not when the now is so bright, Harry can barely open his eyes.
The silence gets deafening after ten minutes. Harry jumps up and down in the entryway, trying to distract himself from the utter stillness around him. It doesn't work, so he changes tactics, turning up the Wireless as loud as it goes, which is not nearly enough because he can still hear himself breathe.
I’m finishing up a cup of tea in the living room with Hermione when an eagle drops a letter into my lap.
Encased is a vivid portrait of a slumbering house-elf, scribbled in the broad strokes of a cheerful child.
"I can do, um," Draco says. He waves his wand weakly, and the walls splash with the bright blue of a perfect day for Quidditch, the clouds forming over the ceiling in swirls of eggshell and ivory white.
At best, the universe is perfectly flat and expanding at a constant rate toward the edge of infinity. Tonight, I can almost see it, shifting over my eyelids: the faint shape of a body; the familiar smell of ink.
It’s hill magic, I think. The way it takes your mind and winds it back to birth, back to when everything was new, and every thought blinked curiously awake, half-formed and simple in its incompleteness. Emotions come without names or definitions, and love comes effortlessly, like birds singing nestled between the knolls and I with my hand in Harry’s, walking beside them.
The fight was over Lucius Malfoy. He’d sold Harry to the papers, again, and Draco had done nothing to stop him.
Draco crossed his arms, his eyes cast down the hall. "I don't know." He floated down to the floor and wrapped his arms around his legs, resting his head on his knees and staring at the door glimmering darkly under moonlight. "Have you been in there since?"
It’s late enough when you find me that the night’s shattered into a million shards of mirrored glass. You’re a familiar reflection when you see me, at last—a fragmented brightness in the dark, whole though broken; warm when I expect the cold. Do you know, I look for you too?
It's true. He's sick of playing the same game with the same friends he's known since he was eleven. Harry could've ended the match in the first five minutes the last time he flew. But instead, he let the Snitch flutter higher and higher until it was lost to the sky. Where do lost Snitches go? Is there a flock of them somewhere high up in the clouds, where nobody can bother them?
"Merlin," Harry muttered, a wet laugh prickling his throat. "I miss you so much." So strange, how people change. They'd once walked down this very corridor as enemies, but now Harry didn't want to imagine a life without Draco. He couldn't. No, he must. Draco was dead.
"Nice house," Harry said. He had a finger looped around a fraying belt buckle, and his jeans were ripped at the shins, though his glasses glinted gold and new. Kohl lined his bottom lashes.
For Scorpius: wizard chess set (charmed against breaks, for when Uncle Ron gets a wee too enthusiastic).
Draco moves to block her view, but Hermione's already out of her stool and walking toward the photos for a closer look. And of course, there it is: evidence of a secret she's long suspected since Harry started begging off dinners to “go home and relax."
Hermione bangs into Harry's bedroom at eight-pm when he misses his dinner with her. She presses a half-unwrapped granola bar into his hand, her voice vibrating with disappointment. "You're such a baby," she says. "It's like Voldemort died, and you've been trapped under Stasis ever since. Your kitchen is fucking disgusting, by the way. I couldn't even walk in from the swarm of fruit flies."
"Order it off the internet, probably," Harry said around a mouthful of biscuit. "Shouldn’t be too hard for her; it's super popular, so there's a million reprints of it." He doused his tea with milk and added a sickening amount of honey before guzzling it down, Adam's apple bobbing with each swallow. "What're you reading now?"
Residual condensation starts to cling into nebulous puffs, cleaving to the ceiling. The BroomBod was a mistake. Merlin, how he hates his celebrity. Harry lies down on the floor and closes his eyes, waiting for the conjured clouds to fatten up and begin pouring down on him. Might as well save the water on a shower; Hermione will praise his efforts.
“What can I do for you?” Draco asks under his big straw hat, his smile shoreline-wide and gleaming at the messy-haired tourist that Draco realises too late is Harry Potter.
"Sure," Draco laughs. "But not like me. Last time, we broke up over a toilet paper roll. Couldn't take a shit without him nagging about how I never replace it."
“The chicken scratch you pass off as quillmanship is abominable, by the way,” Malfoy continued, “you’re lucky I could even parse it at all. But after I’d put in all that effort into reading it, I thought—why not? I’ve earned it, haven’t I?”
"Yeah. We all thought it was for show, but he started showing up for a lot of shit. Voter owling, postering, you name it. And he's like
Ginny's practice is running late; Neville's at a reading for a book he'll never even open. Hermione says it's
at us.” Nearly his whole body wraps around Harry’s arm; Harry’s practically dragging them down the street.
"What?" Harry snorts. So what if he's picking out all the crab? Ron doesn't even like shellfish. Says it's like chewing on sea spiders. "I'm doing you a favour," Harry says, popping another bite in his mouth.
I learned that summer how eager parchment is to die under flame. Five, ten seconds to dust, then swept into the wind with a casual hand to become nothing until it is everything. That is how I love you. You, benevolent you; every lick of mercy a cleansing fire to my sin. Please, won’t you hold my arm and burn the rot away? Burn me down to dust and breathe me in until I am everywhere in you.
“It’s only eight, Draco. We’ve got time.” Harry’s words rumble through him like the dull roar of an ocean wave, lulling Draco back down the depths of sleep.
Sneaking into Potter’s home is not hard. Grimmauld Place recognises Draco as family, and he pays his tribute in blood, palm slashed and dripping over every door. He finds what he’s searching for under the basement trap door, suspended over a pedestal of black haze in a room with mirrored walls. Draco walks toward it until he sees clearly the deep crimson of the Resurrection Stone, and within it, the swirling image of Potter’s face, mid-scream.
Neville Longbottom was the first person I killed who I knew well. Hermione had been complaining about him for a full half-decade. He wanted to uphold every pureblood tradition there was, right down to regressive marriage laws, and I was bloody sick of him. Funny how people change once they leave school. They take the train back to their fancy estates and reconnect to the rotten roots of their upbringing. School may have mixed us all up, but the sediment settles down to the distinctive layers in the years after, and we go back to the parts we were born to play.
"He says we're not good together," Harry says. "Said I didn't see all of him, but I don't know how, since I've already seen him naked several times over. You don't think he means, like, x-rays? He's got a dark artefact lodged in his kneecap?"
It’s the Year of Yes, and Yes starts with this Quidditch jersey, Yes, the one with your old number on the back. Yes, they’ve taken a photo, and Yes, the rumours are true, it’s been five years or forever. I’m warm in worn crimson & gold, and Yes, Harry, I’m saying Yes.
One day the potioneer refuses to take his galleons. The potioneer says, “Potter, I won’t let you kill yourself this way,” in a plummy sort of a hiss, like a jewelled cobra, or maybe a dragon.
"Nonsense," Draco says. There are still clothes hung up, which Draco unloads onto Harry's bare mattress with a single tug of his wand.
"It's a good deal." Ron's thick fist wraps around the stem of his wine glass. "All you have to do is roll out of bed and ride a broom for thirty minutes to make more money than my dad does in a year."
“I thought we were in a hurry.” Draco chews on his lip, his leg jittery like it wants to escape the rest of him.
Draco brought out two plates and two forks. “We came around to Grimmauld plenty of Christmases,” he said once, months ago. Maybe years. It was hard to know how long it’d been when the clock only spoke in hours, minutes, seconds.
Harry half-expects her to hang up. But she lets the static roll long enough between them that the silence turns apologetic. Familiar.
“Mm.” Potter leans in, the metal snaps of his coat sleeves clinking over the glass countertop. His hair is its usual curse-swept mess, his uniform wearier than his face. From close up, I watch his mouth stretch the barest millimetre wider, and something tugs in my chest in return.
Harry bites it out of her fingers. "Disgusting," he agrees, but he swallows it anyway. It's rather tasty, actually. "Can we get back to my issue?"
“You’re the one who insisted on wearing dress robes,” Harry whispers back. He waves at a portly guy sitting on his front steps. The guy gives him the finger in reply.
Draco raises a brow. "Of course you can't. We'll buy you a dresser. One that folds garments up as soon as you drop it in because Merlin knows you won't do it yourself." He lifts his wand, and like that, the last closet in all of Grimmauld Place disappears.
“Isn’t that a bit much?” Harry protests, despite knowing better than to undermine the Headmistress’s authority when he was a faculty member himself.
"WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE," Harry yells sometime later in Ginny's ear, their bodies sweaty under neon lights pulsing heavy to the bass. Harry doesn't remember moving to the dance floor, doesn't remember
When Harry pulls up in his car later that night, Malfoy is sitting on Harry's doorstep wearing jeans and a jumper so threadbare it might've belonged to Dudley at some point.
Harry gathers his thoughts and begins to speak, his words slow to come. "I think what Hermione has mixed up is all these plans to fix things. Don't get me wrong, I would be dead several times over if it weren't for Hermione's plans, but plans also change. The people want someone who can see things through and do what's best for everyone, no matter what. Someone who they trust will sacrifice everything to do what's right. That's definitely Hermione, but she never says it like she believes it herself. She always says she'll keep working even if she loses, but that isn't the same as saying that she won't lose. Which I know she won't."
," Draco whined, lurching toward Harry until he stumbled and fell to Harry's feet. He reached for the slice.

I hope you enjoy!
Draco’s Muggle flat is a hotchpotch of three oddly-shaped rooms that sum up to about twenty-seven square meters total in living space. The kitchen table is a fire hazard rammed up against the oven door, but Harry sits at it gamely enough, his legs squished between cans of beans and a box of instant ramen.
The problem with going out is that Harry drinks, and when Harry drinks, his Glamours slip. And when his Glamours slip, he's inevitably
Hermione burst into the room, a heavy scroll in her hand. “Harry, Malfoy, I’ve discovered—oh fuck it.” She walked back out. “C'mon, Pansy, let’s just finish this one off ourselves.”
He kissed me after the next one. Took my hands, still caked with another man’s blood, and pressed his lips against them like a benediction. Then he sucked my cock.
"Daffodils are a variety of narcissus. Father used to buy them for Mother's birthday every year. You didn't know?"
It's a wonder how easy it is for Harry to get drunk on Draco, to jump down his well of being and drown with his eyes closed and no concept of days or weeks or months. Harry never does anything in halves, a trait Hermione says is residual from their school days on the run, though Harry disagrees. His father was rash before the war, and his mother reckless enough to get in the thick of it with a baby in tow. Not that Harry really knows how they are. It's only, he
"Yeah, yeah. You too," Ginny says. She yawns, stretching. "Alright, I'm off to bed. Don't call me unless you're literally about to die."
Pansy laid a hand over Draco's for a soft second. Then she slapped him across the shoulder, mouth morphing back into a smirk. "Well,
Harry’s nauseous, queasy in his heart wondering if Draco feels the same. Like he’s smoked too much love and has no choice now, but to throw it up.
“They remind me of headstones,” he says, hollow as though they were closing in on him. Cold and suffocating even in death.
Up went shelves on every wall. Shelves pushed beside the fireplace mantle. Shelves lined up the stairs, behind the toilet, under the beds. Shelves spaced neatly between windows, shelves under the tub! All the space for all the lives he could have lived. Draco would have covered every inch of the house in shelves if the house didn't refuse in the end, spitting out a mouthful of nails to clatter at Draco's feet.
The longcase clock read five-thirty-five. It always did when Draco stopped by. Some evenings, Harry suspected Draco was a mechanism of the clock itself: a ticking, geared thing; cold and impersonal and relentless in its precision.
“I… well, I’ve always preferred my mother’s. They’re a very pale blue, like the sky when the cloud’s so thin that it streaks. My father's… it’s not pleasant to speak ill of the dead.”
Harry doesn’t recognise him at first. But here he is, standing in the back of his Care of Magical Creatures class—Draco Malfoy.
Seams fray at the edge of days. Draco is easy to pick out because everything is easy with practice. He fishes for the plums that Harry forgets to buy and settles for Harry’s hand instead… ripe and sticky to the touch.
"Right," Eltanin smiles wryly. "Of course you did. Well, I suppose now that we have a pen, we can get on with the signing."
Harry reached over and swiped the crumb off. Then he took a bite of cake and imagined muddy trainers and the forest soaked through under rain, though he tasted nothing.
Pansy pulls out her wand from her Birkin. “So you’re telling me that you went on a date with Potter because you wanted to hold hands with him.”
When Harry awakes that morning, he sits up with a start, his heart half-torn from his chest. His alarm rings and rings and rings in alarm: Panic! Cry! Despair! There’s been a storm thundering through his mind all week. Draco Malfoy stands trial today, and he’s worse than dead if Harry doesn’t do something about it. Harry’s never liked Malfoy much (stupid prejudiced bully with even stupider pretty hair), but he’s going to save him anyway. It’s what is right.
"Wait!" she says. "It's about BroomBod. Our reports say that you've taken it offline. Can I speak to you for a few minutes about—"
“Invaluable. Everything has a price,” Malfoy scoffs, his composure tempered despite his choked words under Harry’s fist.
What happens next, Molly will never know, because her Harry's large arse is obstructing the bleedin'
The thing about love were the things you took for granted. Harry could run fingers through Draco’s hair, or he could slip a hand beneath Draco’s trousers, or he could press Draco up against a wall and slide to his knees, and none of this would come as a surprise.
"It's hard for me to explain. It's...it's something like...I like the idea of always having an answer an arm's reach away."
Not much, his cock mumbles under his jeans, despondent. Harry's about to shove off when one of them asks Harry if he really went to Hogwarts with Dennis Creevy, who dropped out of Hogwarts to be a bigshot movie director after his brother's death.
Malfoy pushes Harry harshly back. Harry stumbles, his vision temporarily lost to vertigo. By the time he can see clearly again, Malfoy's pulled up his trousers.
"Okay, fair," Hermione laughs. "My odds against Greengrass are loads better than yours against an immortal dark lord." She smiles down at her egg salad sandwich. "I like this side of you."
Harry watched Draco step down from the train. He saw first his bag, which was a green leather one that he didn't recognise. Next was the brown fur coat, the cigarette in his hand. Then Draco saw him too and stalled, his mouth parting like he wanted to smile but couldn't because he also wanted to cry.
A server brings the man at the counter a plate with seven strips of bacon. The man says something, and the server laughs, red curls shaking as she pours his coffee.
Harry buys a round for a stag party and coaxes his new friends back to Nylon. One of them suggests that she's never had bottle service before with a coy glance at Harry, so Harry gets them their Dom Perignon and their Cristal, and he gets a lapful of arse as thanks. The arse is tight and the mouth hot, but that isn't saying much, is it?
Harry sees, for a moment, the bloody corpse of a naked, mangled soul. A train whistles by. “There are fates worse than death.”
." His fist was still twisted in the front of Harry's jersey. Harry wasn't fighting back—he looked bored, that bastard—so Draco let go and backed up. He crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco's wearing a thin Quidditch shirt, slightly untucked, soft and worn over his chest like something that Harry wants to bury his face in. Draco must've changed out of his work robes before coming over—there's no way those pastel high-tops would've passed corporate muster—and there's a smudge of weariness under his eyes.
Harry licks a streak of spilt coffee from the rim. "Yes? So what if I am," he smirks, nearly coy if it wasn't directed at Draco.
“No.” Harry grits his teeth, narrows his eyes on the road marks blurring beneath them. The car strums wild under his palms, and he feels it straining to break free like a beast chained to his own chest.
The first man I killed was Anton Dolohov. That was easy. He'd been a Death Eater for years. He killed Muggles. Maybe he murdered my friends, who knows. I went to a lot of funerals after the war.
“Portraits won’t take up seats,” Harry says, blurry-eyed from a mere glimpse of the seating chart. It reminds him of the Marauder’s Map, with all the names scribed in tiny print. He doesn’t recognise most of them, but he spots his next to Draco’s, at the end of the room.
move,” Draco says. “The wrist-flick at the end, like casting a warming charm. It’s good, isn’t it? Gives the whole embarrassment of having to fix your hair in public a bit of a flair. God, I should get it patented.”
"Shut up," Harry says. It's hard not to laugh, but he manages. "I eat plenty of it. I'm going to eat it now, yeah?"
"I'll tell you what he was like," the dark-haired bloke lounging across from Harry says with a conspiratorial smirk. "Got the low-down from a hookup last week. Called himself Draco Malfoy."
Harry steeled his breath, his shoulders stiffening in resolve. Enough with being selfish. Harry could do this for Draco, because what Harry required above all was for Draco to be happy, even in death.
"You've seen mine," Draco repeats, still panting, but he's treading water now, his head barely breaching the waves. He spits again, clinging to Harry's shoulders as he gives up trying to do it on his own.
"I'm bi," Harry throws out on the table alongside the plate of chocolate cake and raspberries, the after-dinner apéritifs.
Harry set off in a punishing rhythm. Draco gritted his teeth, but it was too late for him, his hips were stuttering and he was coming. Harry shifted, pulling Draco’s cock out and stroking him as he came on Harry’s chest. A jet of cum caught Harry along his cheek. He swiped his tongue and caught it before it dripped down his chin. "God," he said. A strange look passed across his face as he pushed his hair out of his eyes. He coughed. "Not bad for a first try."
"It's not. You're right. Sorry. I don't know why I called. I know I've been shit to you, and yeah. I don't want to be shitty, but you know. Shit is shitty."
His words sound strange to him, dreadful in their heavy despair. He’s mortified by how hateful they are, and he wants to take them back.
"Why?" Harry crossed his arms and leaned against a bookcase, his back slouching as he smirked. "What would you do if I was?"
Draco looks down at their shoes, his voice taking on a disaffected quality. "Mum's death day was yesterday. Nobody knows that. The grave marker says it's a week later, but that's the day we took her off life support. I don't count that. It was yesterday. How did you know to bring narcissus?"
"Yeah. Um...it wasn't very good. Pansy has terrible taste in Muggle arts and culture. She'll watch anything with attractive people in it."
refracted red over my desk. Something about it pleased me, so I sat down to write my mother a letter. I signed and sealed it with my thumb, which burned, but I had salve. Then I put the letter away in a drawer with all the other envelopes. Some were starting to yellow.
"Mountains of Diet Coke," I sneer. "My honey, lines of aspartame, fake sugar to the brain. Wanting is a wasting sport, Potter. Cavities. Rotten teeth. Rotten apple."
"I don't even play Quidditch anymore, and they want me doing sponsored rides on that monstrosity like I'm some sort of pro," Harry complains to Ron later that night. They're sitting at the bar of a fancy restaurant that's Dean's new baby, or so Ginny says, as she's not getting pregnant anytime soon.
"That's the only one I'm afraid," Ariel said. "For now. If I get any more embarrassing stories, I'll be sure to share."
The room was small, smaller than she expected. His walls were lined with books and jars filled with slimy things while a giant bed dressed in black satin blankets sat, almost expectedly, in the middle of the room while a cauldron simmered quietly in the corner beside a dark wooden desk and a dark gray curtained windowed silhouetted the half-moon which appeared to stand in the window for their pleasure alone.
A deadly silence penetrated Diagon Alley as a stand-off ensued between the lone woman and the remaining Death Eaters. Ariel unhinged her jaw and bellowed out an ear-shattering roar that rattled the buildings, blowing brick and mortar asunder. Debris fell onto more death eaters and squished them out of existence in a second. When the dust settled, Ariel stood there, defiant and glaring at the rest of the witnesses, daring them to try again. None of them did. They scattered like ants. Ariel went to turn but before she could a high-pitched woman's voice yelled out, "Petificus Totalus." Her body planked and crashed into the stone ground, unable to hold her own hands out to break her fall. She landed hard. When she tried to get up, she was horrified to discover her body and her mouth were bound still.
"You never asked," Ariel said with a sly wink as she dipped her head to steal a sip from her teacup. "Besides, you were way too young to hear about my pirate days."
He didn't look at her though. He was squinting and smiling ahead at the purple lagoon where six languishing mermaids gossiped, arguing, antagonized, and talked over another with their angelic voices. He felt drunk with joy. To him, this was the pinnacle of his career in seeking immortality: Conversing and enjoying the company of real immortal beings. It was nearly giddy, thinking soon I will be one. But for now, he got to be in the company of goddesses and that was more than enough.
"It happened at Diagon Alley. There was an ambush…Rudolfo, Yemo, and the Beckles Brothers are dead."
"I don't know how you want to handle this," Voldemort began after an awkward pause floated between them. "But if you turn her down, I highly recommend doing it away from a body of water—"
The shopkeeper eyed Ariel's body with a quick vertical glance through before she turned on her heel, disappeared into the back and returned, minutes later, brandishing a plain pale pink long-sleeved dress with an asymmetrical hem that hung above the ankle. "It's fairy-made but the bottom was torn up by feral goblins so that's why it's eighty percent off."
Harry looked at Ruth then Ron, shaking his head. "She's such a mean drunk." He whispered at Ron, playfully.
Voldemort started to laugh. “‘Shrine boy’. Merlin’s Beard,” He leaned in and told her conspiratorially, “You know, until you came, I thought about hiding the shrine while he was away at school. That way I could watch his face as he tried to find it without asking anybody if they seen it because how was he going to go around asking people if they’d seen his…” His sentence ended in a fit of snickers.
But then he blinked and he gave her the oddest, closed-lipped grin. "Oh," His voice rumbled with mock scandalization. "Gross."
Draco fled to the soundproof master bedroom's bathroom to avoid hearing the familiar sounds that follow defying the Dark Lord: the pleas for mercy, the killing curse, and a loud, heart-stopping thud.
"No it grieves me to report that there have been no changes since I last spoke with you, my Lord. Albus is still dying—" (Voldemort laughed) "and still desperately searching for the location of your Horcruxes." ("Good luck.") "He and Potter remains as ignorant as ever of your true plans. And, from what I know, Draco hasn't made any more attempts on the old man's life."
She opened one eye and discovered a glass of water floating in front of her. To the right, in a chair in the shadowy corner, sat Voldemort.
"They've already met Severus?" Tom asked teasingly. "I didn't realize you two were getting so serious."
"Oh, nothing much," Ariel replied. "Kinda drifted around for a while, excavating sunken ships, making potions. Other than getting my legs back, the most exciting thing that's happened to me in the last six decades was getting one of my recipes published."
"I thought—" Fenrir choked out but Voldemort interrupted him with a Cruciatus Curse, sending an electric current of agony into the werewolf's body, unlike anything he had ever felt before.
He found it two minutes after Narcissa took Draco to Platform 9 3/4s tucked into an old shoebox and hadn't found the time to actually sit down and finish it. So today was going to be that day. He butchered an elf first thing for Nagini and left the kitchen for his bedroom (aka Lucius and Narcissa's old master bedroom) with his reading material in hand ready to indulge in some long-awaited reading time.
Tom rolled his puffy eyes, bashfully, though he never tired of her affections. Even if the voice in him that despised vulnerabilities told him to.
"Wow," Tom blurted out, impressed but sick with jealousy. He read in a magazine recently that the average age for most people nowadays was a paltry 58. "I hope I live that long."
Ariel chuckled. "Have you lived under the sea? It fucking sucks. It's cold. I'm never warm. You're always getting chased by something that wants to eat you or fuck you or just plain kill you. You have no idea how easy it is to accidentally swim into a predator's mouth. And—it's never been home to me. I never felt at home when I was in the ocean. Even when I was with my family. But those few days I spent on land…those was the happiest days of my life. I felt like—like myself when I was on land. And I would give anything just to be happy with myself like that again. Even for a second."
She laughed a little but then she got visibly sad as her thoughts inevitably drifted to her mother, who she never knew and only knew through the stories she heard, for Athena died when she was very young, and, who she realized then and there for the first time with heart-shattering horror, she'll have outlived for nearly two centuries, more years than her mother ever lived.
"Thanks," Ariel said sheepishly as she took a swig from her cup to dull the pain in her backside from where she fell. She glanced around their new location and knew at once Narcissa chose to start the tour with the in-home laboratory. Her eyes widened with delight spotted shelves upon shelves of jarred ingredients all of which were kept labeled, alphabetized, kept evenly apart, and, most impressively, completely dust-free. "Oh, my cod…Your lab is…gorgeous." Ariel punctuated her awe with a sharp gasp for her blue eyes found a giant golden cauldron sitting against the corner. Her heart nearly exploded from her chest as she drew closer and discovered, "Oh, my fucking COD! Is this the Deluxe Circe Self-Stirrer 5000?!"
"You might as well start on the kitchen," Voldemort said flatly as he handed Ariel a teacup full of dark purple wine. "After that, you can leave."
He dropped his wand immediately. "Sorry, I thought—" he held his head suddenly slammed by nausea "Fuck me."
Classes became pure agony for all he did was wait for his jailers, listen for his classmates' and teachers' scorn, struggle through exhaustion migraines and flashbacks of nightmares and the voices in his head that sounded a lot like Voldemort that told him "I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you."
He chuckled, relieved for the distraction. "I doubt it." Though the more he thought about it, the less he was sure. His mom never talked about her parents and when she did it was to point out his grandfather's bastard-ways and how it was the "family curse": for the women in their family to fall in love with bastards and for the men to grow up into bastards. "Although, I can't say for sure."
The dank, old wizard's bar with the sticky floors covered in hay and trace amounts of goat feces was, unsurprisingly, dead. With the exception of Harry, Ron, and Hermione of course who walked into the seedy establishment hours ago, providing that grubby bar with the welcoming sight of profits.
Voldemort stood back up and looked at Draco, who was doing his best to not look like he wasn't scared shitless. He cleared his throat threateningly.
Tom listened to her speech, his mouth fluttered open, looking so torn and anguished by her declarations. He drew his hand out of hers, flung his arms wide, and coiled them around her, declaring, "I'll always love you, Ariel."
He was still holding her arm when their bodies dissolved into grains of sand and transported them back to Spinner's End.
"Know this," He said, hanging his head above Greyback's terrified eye line, his face dark with guaranteed violence. "From this day forth, you will serve me. With nothing less than absolute devotion."
She looked around, expecting to see Voldemort or Nagini but found herself alone beneath a gossamer sky and a lukewarm September sun.
"Good morning to you, Lord Voldemort." He returned as they shook hands and headed to the living room to conduct business. "Though I can see, you are having a great morning already." He let out a knowing laugh then asked. "How much did that little chew toy set you back?"
He was quiet for a moment, heart racing with the excitement of finally hearing what he was dying to hear, before he remembered who he was and he added, "You should be."
"Uh, forgive me, My Lord, but aren't you...always...going on about how 'i have to be the one to kill Harry Potter'?"
Greyback could only whimper submissively as Voldemort lifted his weight from the man's throat. Greyback gasped, coughed, trembled, then gaped as painful oxygen rushed to his bruised lungs. Voldemort crouched down, slowly, relishing the fear and agony that surged within the werewolf's face as he desperately, but ineffectively, tried to thank the Dark Lord for sparing his life.
Snape said nothing while the Dark Lord sawed off the wizards head with his wand and after enough blood poured out the wizard to fill a bathtub, picked up the severed head, studied it for a moment with a vague smile, then kicked it into an empty corner where it bounced off the cobwebbed wall and landed, upright, with a loud squishy like thud that would haunt his dreams for the rest of his life.
"Fuck your entire fucking life, Malfoy!" Harry howled but his words were met with the sound of the establishment's door slamming Draco inside. He turned to his best friends, nettled and shaking. He could feel his wand sitting in the pocket of his coat, begging to be used.
"But you have a much prettier reading voice than I." He argued as they got up from the table to relocate into the living room.
"Aw, sixteen. You're so young... Well, anyway, when Tom was a little younger than you are now, I took him to meet my friend who wrote the song I just sang. Well, my friend Sebastian is this little crustacean." She demonstrated his diminutive size with her fingers. "Little tiny creature this big. So, I took Tom to meet him and—you know Tom—he's such an arrogant asshole to anyone he thinks is beneath him. And I forgot what he said but he said something really rude to Sebastian about his size. My friend flips out. He takes his little claws and makes a sound so loud it scares me a little." Ariel demonstrated the loudness by bashing the blade of her knife into the cutting board. "This little crab made a noise so loud it scared the literal shit out of him."
"Well, I got an even bigger treat for you," Ariel said. "Because I happen to know for a fact that one of this magazine's editors works with you."
At last, to Ariel and Voldemort's visibly increasing delight, Snape appeared before them and took his bows.
"It's my favorite magazine." She explained off-handedly as she kept flipping through the pages trying to find what she was looking for. Then she paused her perusing long enough to lift her head and tell him excitedly, "I even got to contribute to one of their issues." She let out a giddy squeal, adding, "I still can't believe they published one of my potions."
"Yes, excellent work, as usual, Severus." Voldemort praised. "Once again, you've proven yourself to be one of the most talented wizards of your time."
Voldemort let out a hearty laugh that filled the whole cave. One that bounced off of the high ceiling and carried away by echoes and latched onto Ariel who joined in with her own hiss-like snickers. Then the laughter died and was topped with more comfortable silence.
"You would hope so," Bellatrix said with bitter disappointment. She thought of all the times (19 since she got out of prison to be precise) she had thrown herself at the Dark Lord only for him to rebuke her, again and again, and again. She unfolded then refolded her arms, too agitated to stand still but too stubborn to move from her spot. This was torture. Only this worse, because she actually liked being tortured. T
Ariel smiled then shot a look towards Snape who orbited to the side as Draco and Narcissa shared a goodbye. Her mind drifted to the other night and a carnal fire was reignited in her.
"Shit," he hissed. He looked at her, expecting her to scold him for his potty mouth but she merely blinked at him with unconcealed amusement as she slowly swam towards the shoreline.
Ariel crinkled her nose at him with mirth then glanced around the room. Half the Death Eaters were already gone and others were in mid-goodbyes. "Is that why everyone keeps leaving?"
Then, the glorious epiphany entered her mind with the same dazzling brilliance as the coming dawn. It sent her flying out of the warmth of her bed, accidentally waking Severus in the process.
Nagini was close enough for the mouse to recognize its own reflection within the pair of shiny black eyes when it made the desperate decision to run for its life instead of waiting to die.
A small, surprised wind left her throat when he introduced himself not from the insane fear of standing before the cruelest, most powerful wizard to ever live but because it finally dawned on her how they knew each other. His face disappeared, morphing into that of a little chubby-faced boy with black hair and intense eyes. "The boy from the cave," she said with a soft incredulous gasp. Voldemort nodded, looking thrilled that she remembered him. "Holy shit…it's been—"
She almost dropped the bottle when she saw him but Ariel swiped it from her trembling hands with the unconcealed glee, saying, as she walked by the stunned witch, "Yoink!"
"No, he has ice blue eyes like his aunt," Adriana argued, gesturing from his eyes to her big blue eyes with pride. "Ariel's eyes are more of an ocean blue."
His mouth quirked like he was struggling not to cry. "Neither Tom nor Voldemort would ever hurt you."
He ended his speech by clapping Ariel on the shoulder while the room applauded. When the applause died down, took his hand from her shoulder, looked down at her, and said, "Did you want to say a few words?"
"Oh." He started but then stopped himself. He told her smiling, "That? That would be easier to just show you."
And so Nagini maneuvered her twelve-foot-swamp-water-and-oil-colored body out of its loose coil and headed off to do what she damn well wanted.
"Yes. We're both potions geeks. We're both for the criminalization of the Amoretia and the legalization of the abortion potion." Ariel said. "It makes no sense why the ministry is okay with teaching witches how to make a date-rape potion but throws a conniption any time you try to teach young people how to create their birth control."
Look at you, a voice in his head said. A piece of shit like you actually did something decent for once.
Eventually, Snape was dismissed. When he went home he found Ariel was reading in bed, eagerly waiting for his return.
"I was almost worried if we stayed any longer, the effects would've worn off right in front of them," said Tom as he pulled off his muggle clothes and got back into his robes. "Could you imagine?"
"No one was talking to you," snapped young adult Tom. To Voldemort, he said, "Ask her if she's proud of us!"
"Told you it's not that hard to break out of Azkaban," Ariel said with a bratty smile as she laced her fingers with Lucius's and reached for Bellatrix's hand.
"We're going to go pay the Ministry of Magic a visit, Severus," Voldemort replied as he began the process of shredding his clothes into that of a tattered dress. "You're going to sit there and pretend to be catatonic while I am going to feed them sob stories about how I," he straightened and started sobbing on cue, and in a mask of anguish and suffering, said, "'He-Who-M-Must-Not-Be-Named kept me as a sex slave and—and—and he used to brag about how he's going to blow the Croatian Sea Organ on May 2nd'."
Ariel bent down to collect her seashells and carefully placed them back in her messenger bag. When she stood back up, she was stalled by what she saw. While his nakedness didn't startle her in the slightest, what she saw on his back made her stomach knot with alarm: A symbol she knew to be the Deathly Hallows took up the entire canvas that was his back. At first, she thought, this is simply a tattoo, done by some heavy-handed scratcher of an artist, but the longer she traced over his back with her eyes did what she saw made her blood run cold. The symbol looked as if it had been carved into his back. The lines were thick, raised and mangled-looking like an old scar of a brutal attack.
“IN THE LIBRARY!” Hermione yelled back, and Malfoy winced. It had taken Harry and Hermione a while to get used to how loud the Weasleys could be, but it had become second nature.
“Potter! The Salem Ring was returned!” Moreau could not contain her excitement as she passed a steaming mug to Harry.
Draco gently grasped his chin to drag Harry’s attention away from the sunset. Grey eyes stared down into his.
I curl up under the covers and pretend to sleep.  Harry comes in and molds his body around mine, the warmth of his chest against my back like a furnace.
Would painting a heart be too cheesy? He bit his lip, then sipped nervously from his glass. Wine would be his liquid courage.
Harry grasped the bottom of his shirt and jumper and pulled up, letting Draco’s hands roam over his chest and moaning as his fingers tweaked one nipple then the other. Harry tugged on the hem of Draco’s top to show that he expected the same access.
He’d asked, “Have you considered Quidditch? We’ve got tryouts coming up soon at Puddlemere, and our first-string Seeker just retired.”
Harry’s fantasies had rewritten what happened next several times over. His personal favourite: Malfoy smirking and walking over to take a bite out of Harry’s cone before kissing him. Then, they’d apparate to Harry’s apartment for a night of loud and passionate hate sex. Not that they hated each other anymore, but former-enemies-now-acquaintances sex just didn’t have the same ring to it.
Too soon, Harry pulled away, and Draco’s teammates piled on to congratulate him for a match well-played. Even when a Chaser not-so-subtly offered that he could “seek” other things with her, he barely registered their words.
“Is this what happened in that book? The one my basket recommended to you?” I ask, fully knowing the answer is no. I’ve read that book cover to cover repeatedly ever since he told me about it. I’ve memorized every scene and there’s no flirting on a stairway, nor in a museum/library.
It’s after midnight when I stumble through the Floo. I’m not exactly drunk, but tipsy enough not to risk Apparition. I’ve given Harry enough shit for Apparating after a night at the Leaky, so I feel the need to set an example.
Draco started when Harry stretched and settled his arm around him. The movement killed the former Slytherin’s ability to concentrate on the storyline — his entire body hyper-aware of the hint of warmth where their bodies touched.
I want to say more but Teddy whines that he needs to use the loo in the next five minutes or he’ll pee his pants so I rush them into the library, which was supposed to be the first stop on our tour anyway.
Harry opened the door and gestured for Draco to enter first. The maitre d’ immediately recognised the pair, eyes lighting up as he came over to greet them.
Draco looks ready to bolt, his face paling several shades again, and his fingers tremble as he smoothes his hands over his trousers.
Everything about Boston so far has been unexpected. Not the Muggle tourists in Red Sox gear or the insistence of everyone I’ve met that I need to order a clam chowder. But everything after meeting Draco Malfoy at the bookstore has been like a fantasy come to life.
They spent the morning in the company of Pedro, sipping on sugar-heavy cafezinhos and learning about his work. The department aimed to make Muggle-borns feel comfortable during their studies at Castelobruxo, the local school, and as they transitioned into careers.
Harry lets Draco pull him into his arms, burying his face in Draco’s neck. The hint of posh cologne always grounds him. He savors the comfort, worried that his husband’s perception of him might change in just a few moments.
As soon as the unknown wizard took a step in, Harry had hit him with a Stunner. Either it was a trap, or they had barely beaten VILE to the cathedral.
In just a few minutes, I’ll leave to run to the T to meet my family at Copley. And somehow Harry is taking up these last moments, just as I know he’ll take over my thoughts on the Green Line. As though he hasn’t taken over my life enough.
An unknown owl dropped a letter in the middle of the ledger he was working in, then looped around to rest on the windowsill. He eyed the ivory envelope suspiciously, battering it with all the Dark magic detection spells he knew. After the war, he had received countless death threats (and a couple of unhinged marriage proposals), but they had mostly died down. The owl hooted as if insulted on behalf of its owner at the barrage of spells.
Wooden signs hang from brownstone facades. Every building is connected, and many have separate stores on the ground and first floors. There are stairways leading to basement shops, and the occasional sight of a doorbell and keypad indicating entrances to apartments above the storefronts.
“So no more dinner dates. You know... Blaise and I really love trying new activities together. We went to a paint night just last week!”
Draco heard Harry mutter something that sounded suspiciously like “rich people,” but he didn’t get a response to his question. He put on his smock and passed over the one he had bought for Harry.
“Well, we can’t eliminate the task force immediately, but public sentiment is against it because there has been no progress and all artefacts but one were returned. I was going to downsize it anyway and reduce funding. If anyone gets caught though, my hands are tied,” the Minister’s deep voice rumbled.
He had called in multiple favours to get a table after Harry read the Prophet article about the opening and called the concept “intriguing.” Blaise had suggested he choose a date that showed he listened to Harry, and that’s exactly what he was doing. Except, for some reason, Blaise was stifling a laugh.
“Then I’ll be heading home. The T stops running soon, and I live on the outskirts of the city.” Okay, so my train doesn’t actually stop running until 1 AM, and it’s only 11 PM, but tourists don’t know that.
Draco moped for a few days before responding to them and visiting Hogwarts to discuss things in person. He was still too embarrassed to have a written record of the bungled dinner.
Harry reached for Draco’s hand. He tried to pay attention to Blaise’s explanation, but all he could think about was how big the world was and how little he had seen.
“I’ve been to Seville before, so even though it’d be easier with a Portkey and is a bit far, I could Side-Along Harry. Even if they’re expecting me, they wouldn’t be expecting two people,” Draco theorised.
He wanted a family, and I gave that to him, but he could have and should have chosen a better partner.  A partner he could walk down Diagon Alley with and not feel oppressive stares.
He couldn’t believe he had agreed to be here. Neville insisted he needed to try new things and meet new people, so Harry had begrudgingly relented. He had assumed “a night of dancing” meant going to a bar or a club. The dancing where you only need to move your hips to a beat, hoping that someone attractive will join you and match your movements.
Harry eventually stopped dancing with the man he’d originally left with, but he’d also danced with three other men and one woman before coming back to the table. Draco had counted, unable to tear his eyes away. He kept reminding himself that his jealousy was unwarranted and that Harry was just enjoying his birthday.
Harry locked eyes with Draco again as he pulled off his cock with a pop, then smiled cheekily before leaning forward once more, slowly and deliberately flicking his tongue to lick away a drop of precome. Draco’s hands tightened in Harry’s hair, pulling at the black strands.
Wanting to take care of Harry, Draco rolled over to hang off the bed and fish his wand from the pocket of his discarded trousers. “Let me clean you.”
My hand itches to confirm that it’s really him. That this is real, tangible, a night to remember. I want to reach out and run my hand through his hair, mussed from sleep and from being pulled tightly last night.
I want to respond, but I don’t want to betray that I’m awake.  I can’t face him and lose my nerve.  There’s a reason he’s the hero, and I’m not.
Thinking of former Slytherins reminded him of his undeniably attractive Hogwarts rival: Draco Malfoy. As time had passed and Harry had finally accepted his sexuality, he could admit to himself that he had harboured a crush on the blond for
My fingers trace yet again over the address in my hand. Hermione’s minuscule handwriting spells out:
Three songs passed before his friend came back to his side. Then someone came to speak to Neville, so they didn’t get to talk about how much Harry wanted to try it and how nervous he felt.
He looks so small as he pulls himself together. Almost frail. He looks as lost and miserable as he often did as a child, and I feel the need to protect and comfort him.
I can already hear the roar of the crowd. As the home team, the patriotic chants of “USA” drown out the cheers for Britain. I don’t mind. The energy is palpable, and it feels like magic is swirling all around us, rushing through my body as my heart pumps in rhythm with the chants.
He felt even more clueless as Pansy’s entire body shook, and a few giggles escaped from where her first pressed against her mouth. His ego prevented him from asking what he was missing.
It’s not enough for me to tell him I love him. I have to show him too. Words are not enough for Harry, who’s had so many people—important people—tell him one thing, but then do something else.
“I can’t watch, and I can’t look away. It’s not Schrödinger’s cat anymore. It’s Malfoy’s crush,” Ginny added.
The familiar circular frames were pushed into his hand. Putting them on, he could see the furrowed brow and down-turned lips on Draco’s face. Concern, his mind registered.
Draco wasn’t sure what he expected, but clubbing with the man you’re in love with? Horrible idea. Terrible. Awful.
The moonlight glinting off blond hair brings his awareness back to his husband. Has Draco ever looked more beautiful? His silver eyes glazed over, thin pink lips soundlessly forming curses, angry red circles criss-crossing his chest. His hand loses its rhythm on Harry’s cock and his eyes widen and Harry wonders what’s changed.
The chair squeaks as I push back from the table. I leave the note where it is, staring at me like an accusation. I have a sour taste in my mouth and no appetite for dessert. Mousse is supposed to be shared, anyway.
“Fuck off,” Draco grumbled, even though he knew his friends were right, and he was pathetically pining for the perpetually late member of their group. “Look! I’m going to ask him out. Tonight. You know the new restaurant in Slater Alley? I got us a reservation.”
“We used them before for the DA, but they have a Protean Charm so they’ll warm when someone updates the location and date of our next meeting. We can come up with a better solution, but it’ll be easier and safer than sending owls,” she explained, demonstrating how to add text to the side of the coin.
He took a swig to prove to himself that he was awake and grimaced as the hot, bitter liquid burned down his throat. It sounded absurd, but he was definitely awake.
of her skill — she was so famous she didn’t need a last name. Furthermore, as an abstract artist, she could help them focus more on the process of creation.
, I correct. Between work, family, and friends, it feels like our lives are over-scheduled. I should go to sleep, cosy up beside Harry, and make the most of the few hours left. But I fancy a cuppa, so I head to the kitchen.
Draco only became aware again when Harry slipped off his lap, his body collapsing on the bed with a loud thump.
I kiss his forehead, and I can taste the salt from my tears on my lips.  I look back down at his confused face.  He’s probably scared and has no idea what’s going on.
We’ve spent a few days of drills perfecting our carefully choreographed lap. Half the players fly in one direction, and the others go the opposite way. It took hours to determine the spacing so we can fly near full speed and not collide. Even if it’s a useless show, it’s damn impressive.
It was light, tentative, and tasted like the açaí they had eaten. It was a warm press of the lips and then over all too soon.
During bath time, I grab the wrong shampoo, and it makes a mess.  Reg starts screaming that it’s in his eye.  He keeps howling and splashing, and the water just keeps sloshing over the sides of the tub.  I try to be gentle, but he keeps wriggling out of my grasp.
I mostly went to tryouts on a lark because really… who just drunkenly decides to become a professional Quidditch player? But as soon as I’d mounted my broom, I was brought back to the simple joy of discovering flying in first year: the exhilaration, the adrenaline, and the smell of freshly mown grass.
“Draco... sure, Harry seems oblivious as fuck, but what are you going to do? Take him on a honeymoon and skip the whole dating and marriage steps?”
“Hey!” Harry strolled into Draco’s flat with the usual morning coffee and pastries, putting them down on the counter. He then came over to the blond to give him a light kiss before throwing himself down on the couch next to Draco, as he always did now.
Blaise insisted on the couple visiting his flat in Florence since Draco and Harry were trying to lay low. He was restoring an old estate in the Tuscan countryside and wanted company since Neville couldn’t leave Hogwarts.
“Granger. Potter. Fancy running into you here,” he greeted in what was most likely the most cordial tone he had ever used with them.
He had also wanked a lot, but he stopped when the faceless stranger took on Potter-like qualities every time. Pining after the man who wanted to arrest you was seriously pathetic.
He didn’t know if he had a chance at anything more than friendship. They had flirted at the wedding, but a lot had changed since then. It definitely was not the right time to start anything serious, but would a casual relationship cause more problems? Draco didn’t think any relationship with Harry could be casual given their history, anyway.
And sure enough, not ten minutes later, after talking to both Li and the coach and begging off work for the day, he’s nowhere to be found.
While he still saves the world on a daily basis, I sit at home to write stories and draw pictures.  I love my work, I really do, but it shows me the vast difference between us.  Most days, it doesn’t bother me, but today when I can’t even work from the migraine, I feel useless.
“I… Wow. I knew he was seeing someone, but… blimey.” Draco’s smirk widened as the tables turned, and Harry was now the one at a loss for words. Some of the tension had left the black-haired man’s body—finally, a positive sign.
Noting the time, he left the bath, drained it, and then returned to his bedroom. The side of the bed he didn’t sleep on was covered in folders as though an extension of his desk from work. He already could feel his neck tense up again.
Harry impatiently made the decision for him, pulling away from Draco’s fingers and stroking Draco’s cock below him... once... twice... thrice. Then Harry shifted, guiding the tip and letting it brush against his rim before he sank down on the length steadily, enveloping it with his body.
.  He cried the first time he saw the scars on my chest, and I couldn’t find the words to express that I’ve never blamed him because I would have done the same back then.
Preferably in the next month or two? Draco stared at the couple. The situation was worse than he had thought: his friends probably had money riding on his success or failure. He debated if he wanted to know who had the least faith in his dating skills. Or was it just a lack of faith in Harry’s ability to see the obvious?
I didn’t think I could cry more after earlier, but I was wrong.  The tears roll down my cheek, and I flee to our bedroom to curl up on Harry’s side of the bed.  I inhale the aftershave.  It comforted me earlier, but now I feel regret.
My fingers tap against my leg as I stare at the map, mentally counting down each stop as though it’ll make the time pass faster.
His confidence wavered when Harry came in for a quick hug as they met at the entrance to the restaurant.
“For Britain!” I cry out, turning to face my teammates with the grin that’s been on my lips for the entire tournament.
I tell him that Daddy’s just... lost.  It’s a true statement because I will do whatever it takes to get my husband to see sense and come home.
“We won’t have a detailed map of security, but we won’t be entirely blind. We’ll likely need two trips in: one to see the room, and one to take the chalice.”
He had planned on taking after his father post-Hogwarts: marrying an appropriate and family-approved girl and having a son to carry on the family name. It was his duty; his family had reminded him since he was born—an entire life dictated by tradition.
’d caused that unravelling. Finally, for the first time that night, the niggle of anxiety in the back of his mind was gone.
“You’ve seen me at my absolute worst and have always been there for me. I’ll be there for you no matter what.”
Harry’s impassive face shifted. Draco felt a niggle of guilt for outing his friends, even if they had told him he could tell Harry. His current amusement outweighed that guilt.
Draco had thought of it and was about to agree when he felt a hand on his arm, and an irate Harry rose.
In short, I can’t look away from this new, professional Harry Potter who looks ready to talk to the press at any minute. Because, by Salazar,
Quidditch has made me more than Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived Twice. Now I want to be Harry Potter, Quidditch World Cup Champion.
Everyone had agreed that after Malfoy had been injured in Bulgaria, they would need a stockpile of remedies and salves. To avoid suspicion, Draco would have to brew them himself.
His eyes focused on Harry at another table, talking animatedly to Marcus. The older wizard was more subdued but was responding with actual words. Draco was used to grunts from his own interactions with Marcus, and he wondered if there was mutual interest.
The time finally came for Hermione, designated by her professional experience in arguing, to make their case. She had brought a Muggle binder full of notes to answer questions on the spot with evidence. Their preparation paid off as even Kingsley, who had the most thorough and difficult questions, eventually nodded his assent.
He couldn’t believe how wrong he had been just a minute before when he wondered if the man was pants at gift-giving.
He wished he could talk to Hermione. While he loved Ron, he was less objective when it came to Malfoy. Hermione would be impartial and help him formulate questions to dig out the truth in Malfoy’s words.
? The maître d’ owes me a favour.” Mother and my friends will last a night or two without me. Harry shouldn’t have to beg for my attention.
The whole night, Draco’s every action was intentional. Draco read the signs of his body intimately, reacting to any sign of discomfort and not pushing any limits.
After an hour more, Pedro had to return to his office, so he gave recommendations for tourist sights and nightlife.
If not for the reference to yesterday, I’d think it was a trap and that he was kidnapped and forced to write it.  That he didn’t mean any of the heartbreaking words written.  That he knows his worth.
I stand in front of the toilet, with the faint pressure of my headache returning.  I try to focus as I fumble for my prick to relieve my bladder.  I can’t even see what I’m doing with my belly in the way.  I can’t tell if I’m making a mess.  I can only listen for the sound of the stream hitting porcelain.
“Since no one is here, I’ll be the lookout, and you can see if there’s protection charms,” Harry whispered, casting a Muggle-Repelling Charm on each of the entrances.
Harry nodded.  He was deep in thought while picking out the acrylics, contemplating each choice before tentatively grabbing a tube. Some he’d silently re-hang after a few minutes.
Caught between relief and regret, Harry can’t forget. Not when a reminder of his deepest, kinkiest fantasy was right there in front of him. The one thing Harry desperately wants but fears asking for. Not that Draco isn’t… willing to try things. He is. But the Giant Squid?
Neville’s eyes shined, and his voice softened as he spoke about Blaise. He also had brought up the very question that Harry had tortured himself with: was Draco the sole reason the diadem was safe in a vault now?
“Blaise and Neville said we should try a new activity together and even suggested the paint night idea,” Draco whined, trying to ignore Pansy wiping tears from her eyes.
team) and played against me back then. And yet, he doesn’t know I play professionally, much less that the World Cup happened in his own backyard?
be serious!” Malfoy interrupted as he stood up, terror in his eyes. Blaise said nothing, but Harry glanced at him quickly and could see that his knuckles were white as they sank into the sofa below him. Neville’s hand moved to fully cover his.
When you’ve nearly been murdered multiple times by seventeen and then actually, legitimately murdered, it’s impossible to fathom a normal lifespan.
I can’t resist the temptation to steal these few moments for myself, where the world and time itself seem to hold their breath with me before Harry wakes up.
I go back to our bedroom.  My entire body is tense with the desire to run back to the room.  I tap Harry on the shoulder, and he puts his work down to tell our son goodnight.
“What about a spot for a Keeper?” That was Ron, slurring his words. I nearly fell off my chair laughing. It was such a momentous occasion, and what I remember best was Ron’s idiocy.
I hear a rustle of the wind outside, and it brings me back to my purpose.  I have to protect my family.
If he hadn’t fixated on Harry, he could have enjoyed the night, but now he just wanted to return home and lick his wounds in peace. (And maybe wank to the memory of Harry’s arms around him.)
Sometimes, I still find it hard to believe that Harry Potter is my boyfriend and that we live together. We were rivals at school, and nearly hexed each other into oblivion during the first week of Auror Training. Truth be told, I’ve always provoked him (on purpose) because having his attention, even when fiery and filled with contempt, was always preferable to the alternative. During the second week of training, after an intense sparring session, something between us snapped. We ended up in bed together, and it turned out things were just as fiery between the sheets. I assumed (feared) it was a one off, but Harry pursued me relentlessly thereafter.
was physically affectionate with his friends in a way Draco was unused to, but would that extend to a sex partner?
He was determined—the seduction would be slow and steady to build the anticipation for an unforgettable night. Pity it couldn’t go beyond that. He couldn’t risk getting caught.
“Oh,” Harry said when he saw his and Draco’s room, “Er... they must’ve made a mistake. There’s only one bed.”
“He seems okay, but meal times have been rough.  All I can make is cereal and toasties so that’s what we ate. I cut the bread vertically, and he was upset that it wasn’t cut in diagonals because he says it tastes better that way.  I knew I missed a lot in his life, but I hadn’t realized just how much Draco knew that I didn’t,” I whisper, so the kids don’t overhear, but also because I’m realizing how useless I am without my other half.
It’s nice to see Daddy as he usually is again: smiling.  Dad doesn’t smile much, but he does when Daddy smiles.  Everyone does.  That’s just how great his smiles are.
“We missed out on a lot of incredible sex by waiting so long,” Harry teased, his hand tracing random figures on Draco’s chest. Inside that chest, Draco’s heart leapt and filled with love.
They hadn’t been entirely forthcoming with their full plans with the other three. It wasn’t a question of trust, but they wanted to be cautious in dredging up past traumas from the war. If, as Hermione and Harry hoped, they were to revive the Order to fight a new evil, it would mean a return to secret meetings and danger.
Draco’s hands trembled. He appreciated that Harry took the initiative because he wasn’t sure if he had the courage to make the first move. He struggled to keep his nerves in check. What if they weren’t sexually compatible, or what if he embarrassed himself and came too early?
Harry looked away as the couple kissed. Despite their differences, they looked like any other couple in love.
Draco pushed his magic towards that mental image, forging a path between the hotel room he was standing in and the nearby museum. He could feel his body heat, and sweat formed on his brow as he continued deepening and strengthening that connection. He used to hate the squeezing sensation of apparition, but the stretching of this new and exhausting type of transportation was worse. Still, it was the only truly untraceable option.
“Didya see that, bro? The red glow’s gone!” The voice was a few feet away, and it took Draco a few of his precious extra seconds to process the heavy Boston accent. When the final ward fell, the man paused and swore, “The fuck? Ya saw that glow too… right, bro?”
It’s not like anyone expected anything of a Death Eater like me anyway, and no one will be shocked that I could abandon my family.  Everyone’s been waiting for me to fuck up their Savior’s life.
Horrified, I tear the page away from her.  I don’t want to know how well she can read or how many of those words they understand.  They’re too young to internalize how and why Draco is so scared.
He and Harry had grown closer because their friends were dating, but they were only recently spending time as just the two of them. He wracked his brain for an activity that was uniquely special to them and wouldn’t dredge up hard memories.
We go to the Ministry of Magic, where Dad works.  Sometimes when I have a half-day at school, Daddy and I visit Dad’s office, so I’ve been before.  Dad clutches my hand tightly so I won’t get lost, and while I sometimes want him to treat me like a big boy, today I don’t mind.  Daddy’s lost.  Dad can’t worry about me getting lost too.
He heard about the incident, even though I thought I was careful when I mentioned it to Ron and Hermione.  I wonder if I could have been better about reassuring him last night because I did see the signs that he’d been crying, and I did nothing.  I wonder if I missed some other indication that he was unhappy because I thought it was just pregnancy stress and hormones.
The empty bottle of champagne I’d poured and licked off Draco’s naked body still lies where it carelessly dropped to the floor last night. The crisp white sheets that every hotel room has are haphazardly falling off the bed.
After a while, he asks. “Are we going to discuss how your charm chose for me a ‘rivals to lovers’ story? That’s clearly not a coincidence, and I’m sure you trust your own magic.”
Both were panting as Draco stood up to grab his wand and divest Harry of his clothes magically. Harry instinctively tried to cover himself as Draco stared down at his naked body, at his scars, and at the wild hair on his chest. If he had known he’d be shagging someone tonight, he would have groomed himself a bit more.
“Bulgaria. In 3 weeks. There’s a wedding between two of the country’s oldest families, and the bride will take out her family’s diadem to wear. It hasn’t been seen in public in 60 years since her own grandmother wore it, so there’s only a brief window when it will definitely be out of the family vault.”
Very happy to have you visit. Pedro Oliveira,” he introduced himself and shook Harry’s hand enthusiastically. He then turned to the blond with a noticeably more subdued reaction.
“See you then. I’m disconnecting. I’ll be busy all night and…” Blaise trailed off, and Draco heard a quiet voice in the background but could not make out the words. “I take that back. We’ll be busy all weekend. Don’t bother us.” Draco’s nose wrinkled at the not-so-subtle implication and took his earpiece out.
I wonder how the loving father, the man that has surpassed my dreams, can see himself as nothing when he is my
“It seems that VILE has at least another business. They call their company Vernon International and Local Exports. As expected, it seems to be the portion of the business that sells products and stolen artefacts. There are likely other side businesses, but that’s the one detailed here. Anyone involved only sees a small portion of the organisation, so even if someone like you gets their hands on some records, they wouldn’t have enough of the pieces to see the big picture.”
I go down the stairs slowly, using and lifting a nonverbal cushioning charm for each step, so I’m not overheard.  I leave the note on the kitchen table.
Twenty minutes before the end of my shift, and he’s still here. He’s the very last patron at the bar, and somewhere between his third and fourth glass of wine, his lopsided and affectionate smile has become permanently affixed to his face. (Because, of course, I had counted and noticed. That’s just being a good bartender.)
He’s so close, he swears he can hear the blood rushing through his body as his heart pounds. He barely hears the request, “May I?”
“Why wait for tonight?” I say, and it takes a moment for my words to sink in. His lips part, as though he’s about to ask if I’m sure, but I don’t let him. I do what I said I’d never do (I suppose some rules are meant to be broken). I crowd into his space and claim those kissable lips. It’s been too long. His hands find my hair, and I pull him tightly against me with one hand on his shoulder and the other on his arse (his pert, grabbable arse). He sighs, and I deepen the kiss. I can feel him vibrating with need, with yearning.
Draco had never been close to his former captain; after all, they were years apart at Hogwarts. Back when he’d first joined the team, he had used his father’s influence to buy Nimbus 2001s to ensure he’d secure the position as Seeker. He didn’t regret it and he didn’t mind using the same “generosity” now with Marcus Flint to get this opportunity.
And if I need to chase after him to get to know the new Draco Lucius Malfoy, so be it. That’s what I’m good at. Hell, I won the bloody Quidditch World Cup with those very skills.
. The animosity had been intense on both sides, but hadn’t some of it bordered on flirting? Harry wasn’t sure anymore.
Embarrassingly quickly, even though Harry doesn’t seem to mind.  More embarrassing is how he cleans me, forgoing any relief for himself because I’m already dozing off.
“Eighteen years ago, apparently. Some people remember meals or people from their travels, but she remembers bookstores.”
“Unfair to say it’s easy when my arse is physically on the line while you sit on a beach with a Mai Tai,” Draco retorted, trying to keep his voice measured and strong.
Draco fought to keep his eyes open, relishing the sensations, but trying not to come from the erotic sight of Harry’s mouth and hand working in tandem. He lost the battle to Harry’s skilled mouth. He groaned and Harry ran a teasing finger over his bollocks.
Nothing can ever really happen between us beyond the walls of this hotel room. After all, Wizarding Britain would lose its shit if we are ever so much as
“Do you think I would give subpar chocolates? I’d only buy the best of the best.” The tips of Draco’s ears were red at Harry’s incredulous tone.
After the wedding, he had been cautious, trying to sort out his feelings and decide how much he could trust the other wizard. The tension was still there, but neither had stepped over the line of being partners against VILE.
Harry had briefly seen Hermione to return the diadem through Krum. He stated simply that he had got away with it but not caught the thief. Harry felt almost Slytherin with the half-lie, but he knew Hermione had seen him stumble on the word “caught.” He might have spilled it all if he hadn’t seen that Viktor’s pyjama bottoms were backwards and Hermione’s shirt (clearly borrowed), inside out.
Which brings me to now: pulling on my leathers for the World Cup finals, and affixing the bracers over Britain’s brilliantly white shirt. I’m standing next to the man who still looks like a fit angel in his own white outfit, even though I’m not drunk on anything but adrenaline.
The trio always met Tuesday mornings at the same café so he could sate his caffeine needs, even though Ginny always claimed he was a heathen for not ordering tea. Once in a while, Harry joined them, but usually, it was just Draco third-wheeling the couple. Would that change if he and Harry started dating? Would they have double dates instead?
Harry’s lips were clamped shut as though he didn’t want to emit a sound. Draco hadn’t anticipated just how tightly Harry kept control of his body, even when it came to sex. He felt emboldened by every sign that he was wearing Harry down with his seduction.
A few weeks earlier, he had visited the museum to see the Salem Ring in person and to take in the room.
I have not worked at all on my book today.  I couldn’t take care of my son when he asked for me.  My husband has been taking care of me all day.  I don’t even have the energy to even see friends.  How am I supposed to give birth and add another child into the mix?  I’m already useless.
I finally see a good opportunity to talk, as Hermione suggested, about places Draco might have mentioned lately.
Draco’s eyes slid to Harry’s face, looking for any reaction to the word “relationship” instead of “friendship,” but there wasn’t one. No eyes widening in surprise, no upturn of the lips in excitement, and no frown of disapproval. Nothing.
He wasn’t sure what reaction to have. Frustrated? Hopeful? Hermione clearly attempted to disguise the real purpose of her letter. Surely she wouldn’t put in the trouble if she wasn’t considering his cause? He remembered how he had mocked her back in second year (or was it third?) when she had become an activist for house-elves. Now his future rested on her taking up his cause.
Draco jumped at the voice and spun around, nearly dropping his trunk on his foot. A weird metal door in the wall had opened up to reveal a tiny metal room. Out of it stepped - was that? No.
Unable to contain his affection, Draco moved on instinct, leaning up to kiss Harry’s forehead, nose, and finally his lips again.
“Right now, we’re enjoying a nice day at the library. Looking at art. Which I really know nothing about, but you can teach me.”
He trusted Neville with his life, but that didn’t extend to Blaise. Merlin knows Harry himself had dated some bloody awful boyfriends. But talking to either of his friends would have to wait until tomorrow.
Harry lost track of time as they practiced together, as he lost track of where his body began and ended. He’d never felt so connected to another person before, and he wondered if it was the style of dance or his leader. Sex had never felt so intimate, so all-encompassing, and he pondered what else he was missing out on in life.
His raven hair is messy as always, but his outfit is sleek — similar to the one in the picture that I inspected this morning, as though I couldn’t draw every shadow and line from memory. Those tanned forearms are on display in a light blue shirt with, of course, rolled-up sleeves.
A blond brow arches at the obvious lie, even though Draco would have been able to see through him anyway. He’s always been able to. But today he doesn’t push it.
He would never admit that the teasing was just what he needed to stay calm, but his best friend knew. They both had grown up in households where any sign of weakness was punished, and it had created an unspoken bond between them.
too early to admit Draco also didn’t want Harry fully clean just yet. He had learned so much about Harry in the span of a few hours and couldn’t wait to learn more. He leaned over to kiss Harry’s forehead just because he now could.
Draco’s brow furrowed. Did that mean his actions had no real value? That every action he had taken, despite his good intentions, was all for nought?
Home. He had heard stories of people associating the word with freshly baked biscuits or warm hugs. He, however, associated it with the smell of his mother’s roses and quiet. Most of the portraits in Malfoy Manor preferred to reside in the frames that hung in the family portrait gallery, having each other for company instead of waiting hours to see if any of the three living family members would walk by.
Everyone took to the air. Draco basked in the light breeze that cooled his body as he hovered, looking for a streak of gold.
I reach over the bar to pour myself another glass from the opened bottle of… something red. I can’t be ignored forever and speculating about Draco Malfoy is infinitely more entertaining than just getting pissed on my own.
He walked determinedly to the far edge of the room towards a specific target as Draco reached for the nearby string of an emerald balloon.
I would do anything for our son.  I would die for him.  He’s my pride and joy.  It’s why this is the last time.  For him.
Finally, we settle in for storytime.  I start with Babbitty Rabbity because it’s a classic, and it was my favorite as a child.  I try my best to do the same voices I always do, but my voice cracks a few times and ruins the effect.
Draco reviewed the words on the letter from the Magpies’ Chaser as he waited for Harry to arrive at the pitch.
His friends had been supportive and encouraged him to ask Harry to dance. They did dance briefly, but Draco hadn’t been able to stop overthinking everything (hand placement, not getting hard against Harry’s bum, etc.) It was awkward, instead of romantic.
“Look, Pot-Harry, we had a delightful night. Really, we did. But that’s all it was…. Fucking hell! What the fuck was that?” A loud tapping on the window startles me and I whirl around.
“Circe’s tits… Draco, we didn’t come for small talk. You said you think Potter saw you in Egypt,” Blaise interrupted.
Out of sight of the librarian, he pulls me to him in the middle of a landing. His thumb brushes along my chin to my lips, tracing lightly, awakening every nerve ending.
Still, she hasn’t been in years and isn’t particularly knowledgeable. She’d last visited with her parents the summer before first year, but being Hermione, even though years had passed, she insisted on writing me a guide to American culture and Boston history. It isn’t even my first trip across the pond, but I couldn’t bring myself to refuse her help.
on this new life. Perched on a high top chair, Harry Potter looks deliciously rumpled as he sips his wine. His hair is unruly as ever. Stylish blue acetate frames have replaced ill-fitting round glasses, and he is wearing an expensive navy wool suit that clings to his body in a way only adequate tailoring can achieve.
James’ expression went strange. His eyebrows knitted together and his brilliantly green eyes were fixed on Draco in an intense stare. He looked like he wanted to say something, but then the moment passed and what he said instead was “Here, let me help you carry this to your room.”
“It is, but our counterparts in Boston and Paris haven’t found new witnesses, even through Muggle channels.”
This wasn’t the path Harry Potter was supposed to take after the Final Battle and testifying on my behalf. He should have become an Auror, marry Ginny Weasley, and pop out three kids with names in honor of his heroes — something sappy like James, Lily, or Albus.
I pull myself together as best as I can for Reg’s nighttime routine.  For a child that usually talks about everything under the sun, I’m surprised he doesn’t bring up what happened earlier.  Instead, he talks about how Hugo’s school went on a field trip to a local park, and he found a four-leaf clover.
An unknown voice joined in the background, “Tell Little Dragon to bring you to us so we can talk more in person when you’re done.”
The first store was only a block away. Blaise strode to a rack of swimming trunks and picked out a few, shoving them at Harry and Neville. Before they could argue, he guided them to the fitting rooms. Draco guessed Neville was used to his boyfriend’s antics since he just laughed and let himself be pushed around the shop.
Flying and Portkeys aren’t advised for pregnant wizards, so he probably had to apparate or take Muggle transportation.  We’ve taken trains before, of course, but not planes.  If it’s apparition, it has to be a place he knows, can mentally picture, and is not too far.  That limits the list of places further.
Their tentacled partner pulls them from the still waters near the shore. Neither can contain their moans as their cocks rub together as they are jostled. The friction sends shockwaves of pleasure through Harry’s body. As the water grows more turbulent, his arousal heightens. His anticipation grows. He could come
How repressed was he that with one brush of the hand, which was most likely accidental, he was already aroused? He would have to buy Hermione a box of her favourite truffles as a gift for taking the hint to leave him alone with Malfoy.
The covers were older and worn. Draco noticed the same spiky handwriting throughout one as he quickly flipped through it—a diary then. As he thumbed the pages, he read a few sentences here and there when the acronym “VILE” appeared. Whoever the original owner was, they were either well-informed or involved.
arrest you,” Harry warned. There was no sign of the man who had blushed under his touch, just an auror staring at a suspect. Draco was glad at least that in his anger, Harry seemed to have recovered from the nausea-inducing transportation spell.
“I don’t know. A few years ago, the only name I remembered was James. So that’s what everyone called me. None of the specialists could explain what had happened, but then… oh Hermione and Ron, how are they doing? What happened to them?”
The realization hits, and it’s more painful than the migraine that was splitting my skull open earlier.  Without me in the picture, they could have a normal life.  Reg might grow to hate me even more, but it would be for the best.
"I knew it! You all owe me 10 Galleons," Pansy cried out, leading to a chorus of sighing and swearing before the congratulations came.
“You should let Gra–Hermione know you’re safe. My Portkey back to England leaves in the morning. Afterwards, can we meet with Blaise and Neville?”
Draco now lived for Blaise’s visits. His friend would update him on discussions with Hermione and Harry as they looked through his great-uncle’s research. All contact had been through Neville and Blaise, which Draco thought was a little unfair given that Blaise fit the definition of an accomplice. The visits always ended with Draco gaining a modicum of hope; after all, he hadn’t been arrested yet.
They walked as casually as possible through the nave. Draco stopped every few steps, pretending to look more closely at a chapel before moving on. Most of the Muggles focused on the tomb: a large raised platform topped with four men hoisting a sarcophagus on their shoulders. Few explored on the side rooms.
“Did we get more info on the other unidentified men that entered the premises in Boston? They reached the room after the Salem Ring was stolen.”
“Daddy and I looked everywhere for you because we love you.  Daddy’s lost now and because we love him, we need to find him.”
“Malfoy! Yes! I heard about your new foundation. This year Durmstrang had its largest class of Muggle-borns yet. Let’s stay in touch so I can help.”
The explosions thoroughly absorbed his attention, even if he didn’t understand all the technology that caused them. He had grown up believing that wizards could easily defeat Muggles, but clearly, Muggles had their own ways of being destructive.
Everything felt surreal. He had thought he knew Harry well after years of friendship, but he hadn’t known or even imagined that this side existed. He barely heard his own ragged breaths as Harry’s voice came out as a torrent of curses, as though a dam had broken.
Obviously, he had to show Harry an unforgettable gesture of his affections so the auror would choose him. After all, one date did not a relationship make. Draco already had a solid basis of friendship. What did Flint have? Fame? Riches? Muscles? Well, Draco had one of those things too.
She set down a small, beaded bag on her lap, pulled out some books, and restored them to their full size.
The motorcycle slowed to a stop and Draco realized they’d gone back to the school. They both clambered off the machine and James leaned against it, crossing his arms. “So what do you think?”
“You can keep calling me Potter, or if you want to be more formal, Auror Potter or Mr Potter are also acceptable,” Harry sassed with the best snide tone he could muster, testing the waters.
Before I head upstairs, I add a line to the post-it, because the calendar seems to be mocking me with just the two stars on the page among a sea of appointments, events, and general responsibilities. I know it’s not going to go over well, but I need to write it down. Open communication, and all that.
“Where the fuck did you sleep last night?” The words tumble out of my mouth because I’m concerned (he’s a very light sleeper), angry (he left last night), and frustrated (with myself for not waiting to talk in person... not that we’d have time since we don’t even have time for a quick fuck).
My favorite panel, Judgement, depicts the weighing of souls to determine their fate. I’ve been drawn to it ever since I first saw it a decade ago, new to the city and desperate for redemption after the War. Back then, I was acquitted with Harry’s help but I didn’t think my soul would have been judged to be “good.” Now, I hope it’s a little lighter.
They walked for five minutes without saying anything. It was a companionable silence following the exhaustive planning of the preceding hours.
He vaguely remembered a conversation a year earlier, when Neville mentioned a trip he had taken to the Everglades to study the local flora. Harry had then excitedly explained to the group about the Muggle concept of magic and Disney World. He’d even forced them all to watch children’s films about true love and poisoned apples.
Harry failed to muffle a groan when Draco’s hand continued its trajectory, tracing over his perineum and finally, circling his rim as an invitation.
Sure, love was powerful. The entire Wizarding World had seen that with Harry’s survival. But, Draco didn’t love Jame-Harry (not yet, at least), and they certainly weren’t meant to be. Movies were just movies.
A picture falls into my lap. It’s not one of the many he’s sent me. (Although I’ve kept every one.) Instead, it’s a Polaroid from Pansy with “I can’t take his pining for you, anymore!!!” scrawled in Sharpie along the bottom. Not that Harry looks like he’s pining away for me as she claims. On a loop, he pushes his hair back casually and he laughs while he rolls up his sleeves, the top of his fitted white shirt left open to expose a hint of chest hair.
And finally, at night, I love how he holds me tight in his arms and kisses me on the forehead when he thinks I’ve nodded off before he has. Of course, I also love other things he does…
He also loves Paris.  Which arrondissement did we stay in the last time we went?  The fourth?  I write it down.
I can’t bring myself to say the words to explain, so I just leave it at, “We have to find Draco.”  I let them read the note for themselves — or at least, whatever few words are still legible on that parchment.
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry blushed, and Pansy victoriously took the offending article of clothing to show her wife “what an utter twit Harry is.”
Willing himself not to look for Draco Malfoy, he kept his eyes fixed on the jewellery for the entire ceremony. He let the words wash over him.
When they had finalised the best plan possible given the time constraints, Draco left to gather and pack his gear: earpiece, coat (which he kept red because it reminded him of Harry, even though he would never admit it to his boyfriend), and hat. Harry, meanwhile, went to grab his Invisibility Cloak and the notebook he had used for all his cases as an auror.
For a moment, he stood there, listening, his mind blank of all thought, his face slack from enchantment as he indulged himself with her singing.
She led him into the next room where a red-headed woman hovered remained bound and silenced hovering above the polished floor. Underneath her shadow laid the contents from her bag scattered around by Bellatrix. Garbage mostly. Magazines, forks, dead flowers, mini vials, seashells, bottle caps, driftwood, an old black robe, and an unremarkable amount of money. He turned his attention to the woman and discovered—he knew her face.
Insomnia came yet again and he did what he usually did to combat that terrible beast: masturbated, and when that failed, he went on a long stroll.
He looked at her hand and when he looked up at her his face had hardened. He tugged his hand out of hers and said, his voice clear and hard as diamond, "This isn't about Potter. This is about removing witches and magical folks out from the rocks of oppression shadows of muggles and mud bloods. This is about making sure they don't burn any more of our kind at the stakes. This is about—"
Narcissa was in one of the guest rooms, nursing a bottle of vampire wine while she laid in bed and stared dejectedly out the second-story window when her bedroom door opened with a bang and from the doorway stood Lord Voldemort.
For a while, they merely held each other. Until Tom pulled himself out of her embrace and asked, somewhat sheepishly, "Will you sing to me?"
A silence drifted between them. Their eyes veering away from the other, too embarrassed by their impotence and self-loathing to be able to offer assurances. Until, Snape broke the quiet by asking, "Do you want to be a human?"
Voldemort beamed at her, like it was the only thing he’d ever wanted to hear. “Great.” He said with a breathy laugh. “Let me clean all this first and,” (he looked down at his blood-caked robes) “Myself. And then, we can do…breakfast?”
The room was silent except for the sounds of cooking. Soon, pleasant smells filled the air, teasing the starving young man who felt dizzy waiting for the meal to be done.
He could see a ghost of his boyhood self huddled against the end of the couch behind Ariel, watching them with attention-starved eyes. If only the kid knew, he thought. All those years of dreaming. How often he prayed, back when he was young and foolish enough to think Gods listened to prayers, he would wake up in that piss-soaked cot to Ariel's beautiful voice telling him, I'm taking you home with me. The two of them living in some crummy home, like Spinners End, ending each day together with a bedtime story. Oh, little Tom, those desperate prayers may have fallen on apathetic ears but they weren't the pathetic cries of an orphan with a pipe dream. You just didn't know it was all a part of a contingency. You can have everything you want out of life but some things had to come first. Maybe there never could be an Ariel without there being a Dark Lord first. How would there have been a Bellatrix to bring you back to me had there not been an army of Death Eaters first?
“Leave the boy alone,” Ariel said, listlessly. “You know, I had a marble statue of my crush in my treasure room when I was his age.”
"Look what the catfish dragged in," observed Adella with her honeysuckle lilt as they swam to the edge of the waters to greet the pair. "Where's Severus, baby sister? Don't tell me you've already traded in one human for another."
"I was a princess." Ariel corrected, taking the crown from her head. "But then I turned sixteen and I was so desperate to be a human that I sold my soul, got married to the first guy I met, was promptly cheated on by said man—"
He sighed heavily once the warmth flooded over him dropped his head back into his comfy office chair, and told Snape, "Send that poor unfortunate soul my deepest thanks."
He slapped his breast pocket and felt the tiny vial. He then quickly uncorked it and reached forward to pour the contents down her throat.
But the burning in her chest, nausea in her blood, and the stabbing pain in her hand told her otherwise.
"And, as it turns out, we are both of the same minds," She continued dropping an open issue onto his lap with the pages flipped to an article that he wrote titled, 'The Exorbitant Cost of Unhappiness: How The Potions Industry Profits From Lack of Mental Health Resources in the Magical Community', "That mental health potions should be low cost and free to all."
The old headmaster gave him a tender eyed smile, his face glowing with endearment. Then he tilted the neck of his bottle towards Snape and asked, "Will you drink with me now, Severus? As per an old dying man's request?"
"You know, I didn't think celestial creatures like yourself concerned yourself with the lives of witches."
The news of her death came in the form of no news. After that day, she was never mentioned again by the Dark Lord as if she had never existed to begin with.
He held the meeting in a rundown castle on the outskirts of Brasov. When Snape found him, the Dark Lord was standing before a dark almond-shaped window watching the midnight sky.
With that, the Dark Lord waved his arm and on cue, Ariel emerged into the room out of the shadows looking so ridiculously out of place in her pale pink dress and her bright red hair amongst the sea of darkness. Draco felt the room balk at the sight of her. He looked to gauge Snape's reaction but all he saw was the back of his head as the man turned himself in his seat to give all of his attention to his master and the new guest.
Narcissa smiled at her, then at her sister, then back at Ariel. She extended her hand to the pseudo-siren, giving her a cursory shake as she said, "It's a bet."
"I don't know," Narcissa admitted, nearly speechless. She wouldn't have believed it if she weren't seeing it for herself. At first, when she came back from her daily four-hour excursion to the liquor market and had a distressed Bellatrix explain the situation, she thought her sister was exaggerating. Bellatrix was hatefully jealous of any person who seemed to curry the Dark Lord's favor. It didn't matter the Dark Lord had the mood swings of a dictator or that being his "favorite" often meant inevitably getting pushed off of a higher pedestal. "This is weird."
Ariel stuck out her wet hand and Tom eyed it like a venomous snake before he took it and gave it a shake.
Voldemort scoffed. "Bout time that boy did something useful." He muttered as he slowly settled into his chair.
It was such a bizarre concept to the former mermaid, whose species, as her people liked to joke, were considerate enough to turn into seafoam once they died, thus sparing the bereaved the responsibility, and torment, of having to care for the dead. She couldn't imagine her corpse spending the eternity, entombed, in the cold ground like that. But even in her unease, she found the custom fascinating. "Wow…"
Ariel watched him then turned her focus to the venomous snake who was wriggling its way back towards her. She watched the predator slink onto the back of the couch and stick its blink-less face into her own, expecting praise. Ariel, fearing nothing, raised her hand and lavished gentle affections onto the viper.
They fell into a small stretch of silence before he asked, "Where did Tom—" He amended himself. "The Dark Lord go?"
"You're welcome to have some, but sadly they haven't invented an allergy potion yet that gets you drunk," Tom lied after another gulp.
"When am I ever anything less than polite and well-behaved around you?" said Tom with a mawkish smile.
She held his gaze then said, "You don't have to do this." She grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. "Please. Let the boy live, Tom, please. You don't have to be this person. You're better than this, Tom."
The exhaustion of the day fully hits after I finally have a plan in place for tomorrow.  My eyes start fluttering shut, and I tighten my hold on our beautiful Regulus, letting the smell of his shampoo comfort me.
Draco blanched as he realised that if they hit it off, they would have only met again because of him. Fuck.
“That’s the spirit, Little D! We’ve run through it hundreds of times. In. Out. You have a window of 10 minutes before VILE arrives.”
“Hey Draco! This is such a cool idea! I’ve never really painted since art class in primary school and that barely counts,” Harry beamed, giving him a quick hug after stepping out of the Floo.
His court-mandated muggle uni enrollment was supposed to ensure he turned over a new leaf. Draco rather thought this was the perfect new beginning.
Malfoy’s hair, usually perfectly coiffed, was a mess, and he looked terrified. Of Harry? Of Azkaban? Then the blond’s expression suddenly shifted to relief.
“Just think of it as skinny dipping, with the potential for extra fun,” Draco murmurs hotly against Harry’s ear, before playfully pushing him into the water.
"No reason!" Ginny yells back, but the darting look she gives Harry tells him that whoever this woman Ginny wants to desperately "hold hands with" is, she's mad rich.
We were at the park because no one wanted to work—we being the three of us and Harry, who didn’t work anyway. “Working on my life” was the official stance. “Working for free” was closer to the truth, though I learned to keep my misgivings quiet. Everyone had something to prove, which was why I worked fifty hours a week at St Mungo’s, and Harry “worked” a benefit a night for his boyfriend’s political aspirations.
it. Maybe he showed me things that I hadn't considered before, but all that unlearning, all that change came from
"There ya go," the florist says, presenting the bouquet with a flourish. "For your boyfriend or girlfriend or bae or soulmate or whatever you kids call your loves these days."
Pansy’s flashing her tits on stage, and all Draco can do is yell, “THAT’S MY BEST FRIEND! THAT’S MY BEST FRIEND!”
Draco glances down the hall and imagines Harry dressing behind the closed door: soft cotton smoothing over firm abs; swimming trunks riding up his thighs. The plan was to get coffee and egg bagels on the road to the surf shop so they’d make their lessons by eleven.
Eltanin leaves Harry at the entryway to get a permanent marker, leaving Harry to take his shoes off alone. There are easily a dozen pairs of shoes messily piled on the shoe rack. Harry recognises Draco's pastel high-tops, the ones he wears with sweatshirts and stonewashed jeans, and guesses that Draco is still at work.
Ron takes them to Thestral & Gold and tells Harry that it's his third time back already. "The ladies love it," he says. "And they don't skimp on the margs. Good value."
There’s a commotion at the door. Draco twists in time to see Potter entering the saloon wearing a cowboy’s hat and chaps and boots and generally looking very rugged.
The pounding started at dawn and didn't cease until Draco, resigned, trudged to the front door and creaked it open an inch.
"Uh-huh." Harry wonders how long he should indulge her because there's no way she's only here to "check in" on him. She's too selfish to swing that kind of visit. Not that Harry minds. Actually, Harry likes that she's too self-absorbed to dig into Harry’s shit.
“I did not —” Draco shoots Pansy a look. She taps her square-tipped nails against the back of Draco’s mobile-Floo, smirking.
"No," Harry says. He watches Draco leave. Then he has another drink with Eltanin at the bar, waves good-bye to the others, and leaves as well. He doesn't know why he liked Nylon so much before. Clubs are—well, they're nice to look at, full of all the things he could want. It’s like browsing through a catalogue: a blond valet one night, a brunette yoga instructor the next, imagined next to his bed and his wardrobe. But now, he goes home to the welcome mat that Draco picked out and opens his door to the not-closet that Draco slashed away with his wand, and knows that it's Draco who he wants in real life.
Harry's orated many times, but the audience has never been as enthusiastic as they are tonight, sustaining their applause even as Draco ushers Harry off the stage away from the blinding lights. They push against each other between the velvet curtain folds. Harry's forehead is beading with sweat, which Draco wipes off with a linen handkerchief.
"It was in self-defence," Ginny insists, crossing her own arms in mirrored protest. "There was a particularly aggressive woman who kept stepping on my brand-new heels to get closer to Harry, and—"
Harry steeped tea on the bitter side of mellow and poured it into painted tea cups more suited for a child's play set than daily use. He served chocolate frogs instead of biscuits, and he didn't have a single bookcase in his house, though the coffee table was piled high in old issues of
"Old things have a way of making their way back home," Pansy said, giving Draco an odd look before turning back to the cupboards.
Harry leans in. Can there really be too much of a good thing? A million nerve endings, and they're all puckered up for him.
It is a half-tone day; the world washed out and left to dry. The sun rises behind shades, and Draco sinks deeper into the miasma that has become his bed. Eventually, his stomach grumbles, but nausea subdues the hunger, and a numbing chill sweeps over his skin. He stills, his breath shallow in half-breaths, half-life as though himself half-there, suspended in a translucent, catatonic consciousness. Quiet so that he can see through his guts to the back of his spine.
, the bagger assured me, but could I trust him? I didn’t know what plastic was, but paper, I knew my whole life. Then, curiosity bit me again, and I said plastic. But my apples were already bagged up.
Malfoy says that Harry should patent the weather system then sell it to BroomBod, or manufacture it himself. "Though it's probably too much work to do it all by yourself," he says as he towels off his hair. "You're better off selling it to BroomBod. They already have the brand and the marketing team. They can build out the integration for you in three weeks. Then you can live off the royalties for the rest of your life."
I gave a lazy stroke of Potter's dick. As if Potter could be just anyone to me. Years spent fantasising, and now—
Draco laughs, voice warbling a little hysterically. Harry loves that he's responsible for the smile. Like Draco's wearing a part of Harry.
"I know that," Draco mumbles. But he's helpless to the gnawing in his heart. He's tired. He wants to give in, to settle down with who he really is, and live in his own bones. It's not so bad. He's not so bad a person, even if he never thanks people for their kindness.
"Eager," Harry says. He presses two fingers together and fucks them in and out of his arse, groaning at the burn. Draco's mouth is open when Harry looks up.
"Chocolate. Nice," Hermione says. She lifts one to her mouth and bites the Malfoy crest neatly in half. The sweetness spreads across her chest to her hand. She wriggles her fingertips.
They've wandered back into the kitchen to pick at the edges of their destruction, still spread over the kitchen island. Malfoy pops olives in his mouth with the Statis unpeeled and says that it gives them an extra crunch.
They want me to say things like, he’s grey eyes, a pointy nose; frost-blond hair and a smirk as cool as moonlight. I want to tell them instead of the naked affection he wears when he sees me stepping down from the train. The way his shoulders seem draped in devotion, his eyes tender and trusting. I love him so much, it’s like I see him inside-out.
"Did you make a reservation for this place?" Harry asks. He doesn't bother with the menu; Ron will order for the both of them, forever Harry's tour guide to the world of magic and unfamiliar foods.
Harry makes eyes at a woman at the other end of the bar. He leans back and jabs his thumb toward Ron, who, for some goddamn reason, is staring at the laminated cocktail menu with his pinky out like he's at a wine bar instead of a sweaty warehouse where people get drunk off vodka Redbulls and search for intimacy against the porcelain of a bathroom blowjob.
Draco takes her hands. He runs a palm over her eyes, nudging them closed. “Breathe,” he says. “Feel your heart. Then let the music sweep it away. Where does it go?”
"This is…" Malfoy takes a moment to inhale the sweet citrus of a sunny breeze. "This is impressively constructed. Nearly lifelike simulation. Where did you buy it from?"
Ron's hair is uncombed. His stubble is two days old, though his jumper is newly knit from the week he spent at his mum's. The skin under his eyes is purplish, bruise-like when he squints. Hermione sits across from him and pets and pets and pets as her eyes fill with dread at what comes next.
Draco rather agreed with Pansy’s assessment, but still, Potter came by, week after week, neverending with his questioning: “Black or Malfoy? Are there any records? What species—” as though Draco’s condition wasn’t so hopeless as long as he didn’t stop trying to change it. As though, after all these weeks and years, Draco could still change.
Draco takes a step back to admire the spread. "Is this where you take all your dates out for dinner?"
"Don't you? Obviously, you don't like, own the deed to it or anything. You won't get custody of it in court. But don't you feel responsible for how it's going?"
"Professor Malfoy, though." The Third Year gulped, a tremor in her jaw. "I—I thought he died happy. I thought—"
"Ink," Harry said. He blinked once, as though stepping out of a trance. Then he rubbed said ink off and showed Draco the black mark smeared over his thumb before backing away to scrutinize the file cabinets.
Gravity. Magnetism. Force. Attraction. Words to explain how things come together, even if you don’t fully understand the why behind them. Harry’s not really even into skateboarding. He just likes watching Draco move — in the sky, on the ramp, against him.
"So are you." Harry can smell the sweet souring of wine on Malfoy's breath. He imagines Malfoy out with the other campaign volunteers, probably celebrating at someone's flat if how Malfoy is dressed is any indication. If he doesn't do anything, Malfoy will leave and go back to having fun with people who aren't Harry. And then Harry would be alone again, lying around in bed watching the dust collect over his eyes.
Draco put away the book and walked back down the stairs. He reheated the water and poured them two fresh cups of tea. Then Harry came back, and they drank them together with biscuits with little bits of hardened treacle chips.
"It's not smart to mix your hard alcohol. You'll get drunk faster that way," Ron says when Ginny calls for a round of vodka.
"It's Draco's technically, but I use it a lot more. It's okay. Good in a pinch when I'm too lazy to get dressed for the gym," Eltanin explains as Harry feels across the broom for a spot to sign that minimises the chances of Eltanin rubbing his balls all over Harry's name.
From the sky dropped brooms, the Ford Anglia, a half-giant on a motorbike, twisting, curling magic, and still, their lives stretched taut, untouching, eyes forward, one foot after another, the future a green point of light ahead, precisely between the eyes.
Sunlight filters through a gnarled cherry tree outside the kitchen window. Harry imagines Draco taking his morning tea across from where Harry's sitting now. Would he have a book in his lap? Would he reach across the pine table for Harry's hand, for comfort?
to," she wheedles. "Harry only meant to throw his drink. But you know how his magic is when he's drunk—"
until a few days later since Harry dragged him out for a pickup Quidditch game. They'd gone to the pub after, and all thought of reading went out the door.
"He's okay," Draco concedes, his fingers tapping over his glass. "Can we talk about something else?"
"Thanks," Harry says, trying not to cringe at the mention of Draco's new boyfriend. Is it already that serious?
Harry's an hour early to Hermione's rally. He's been going through revisions with her speechwriter all week until the parchment practically shone from ink. Hermione's staff stations Harry at the door to wave and shake hands as supporters file into the auditorium. Harry signs a few Snitches (why do people always ask for that? He's not nearly as good as Ginny) and kisses a few babies before he's ushered back again for final makeup.
"What about me?" Harry asks. He ducks his head back down, tracing another slowly past Draco's ribs, his tongue flat against Draco's chest.
The windows in Harry’s bedroom start from Draco’s knees and sweep up to the curtain rods, hitting just below the ceiling. They’re curtained now, but haphazardly so, with lazy strips of light falling over the bed, the blades of Harry’s shoulders. Draco squints at the light, trying to guess at the time. Just past ten, probably. Harry likes to sleep a lot, maybe ten or eleven hours most days, sometimes straight through on the weekends. Draco doesn’t sleep as much, maybe seven at most, but he always pretends that he does. “Can’t make it, don’t know how long I’ll lay in til,” he’ll tell Pansy when all he’s planning on doing is pushing himself up against Harry’s chest and wrapping Harry’s drowsy arms around himself until he feels warm again. It never takes long.
"I've only worked at Nylon for three months," Eltanin laughs at Harry's mortification. He pats Harry on the back. "It's fine. Honestly, I did think you were a bit of a dick at first, but Draco kept on saying you were going through a hard time, and, well. After a week, I could see that. You were the saddest puppy at the club."
Draco's hands ball up in Harry's shirt, his breath puffing hot over Harry's face, and Harry, he wants, he wants—
Draco leaves the perfumed invitation on his bedside table half-folded in a paper doily, pink ribbon unknotted and crumpled to the side, the morning light a hot slice of summer lancing across the front.
Harry wakes up this morning with a vaguely empty head. It’s as if someone walked down the halls of his mind while he slept and locked up each thought separate from the rest. So when Harry wakes and sees that the hour hits ten, he doesn’t:
"No, um. Well, we don't really talk." It's probably better that they don't, given how weird it got with the confusing conversation over worth and what Harry deserves.
In the morning is half-brushed teeth and jumpers pulled inside-out on the stumble to the Burrow. “The things I do for a Molly Weasley breakfast,” Draco pats his stomach lovingly an hour later. His words are drowned out by Rose’s wild squeal as Scorpius catapults a runny egg to her open book. Harry considers the ramifications of scolding his son over Christmas breakfast and instead smears a cinnamon roll over Draco’s face. Time blurs by then—one chest-aching guffaw after another—and not just because he breaks his specs on a whole quiche flung at his face (Ron’s fault). Molly only pretends to scowl, because messes don’t matter so much when everything can be put back together with a lazy swish of a wand.
He excuses himself. I wait an hour, two. Three, and his soda's gone flat. But I know where to find him.
It's not the first time he's dragged Malfoy into his delusions, though Harry would be the first to admit that Malfoy isn't even particularly fit—he's slender as bones, and Harry bets he can't give a blowjob without slipping some teeth—but that's not the point. Harry's bored of hot, perfect sex with models who know how to keep their arses tight and their mouths shut. What he can't get is someone to hate him. And Malfoy has no trouble doing that.
When you say my name in my dreams, your voice is as small as the hours dark, and the Rs curl under your tongue, fond. Under the moon, the skin above your wrist is milky white and washed of its usual meaning. You say it still stings, but not in the ways that matter.
Harry wakes to an eyeful of Draco's collarbone, a warm arm tucked around his waist. Draco blinks awake not two seconds after—a light sleeper; fussy, as Harry would expect—and they're kissing again, Draco rolling over Harry to grind their hips together. Last night was good—great, stupendous, amazing—and this morning looks to be more of the same.
things. And yet, the book wasn't in the attic. It wasn't behind the shower curtains, wasn't baking in the oven; wasn't waiting for Draco under his mattress. It wasn't anywhere, his favourite book, the one he needed
I am eighty now, and I have been the Master of Death for many years longer than my godfather walked this earth. I keep a quiet existence, my cottage small and my winters mellow, but even the Cloak cannot hide me from Death when it summons me as Witness. “Watch,” the beast commands, and I obey because to master Death does not mean to conquer it; only that I see it for what it is: King.
It's a whole week before Harry sees Hermione again, the days going by like years, transfiguring marble into brick and gold into walnut and adjusting the lamps so that they give off a soothing yellow glow. Harry's a new person by the end of it. He's full from change, languid in progress, content cataloguing all the new things in his house, the things he can call his.
Draco had the tea steeping and was plating biscuits when Harry reentered the kitchen and declared that the book was nowhere to be found.
“Fine,” Harry surrendered, wondering not for the first time how he ended up as the Minister of Magic. He couldn’t help but think that he wasn’t meant for his life. Sure, people listened to him, but only because he’d killed Voldemort. Even his Quidditch victories never felt like his own. He could fly, but he never would’ve made “youngest Seeker in the century” if he hadn’t been so small—if he’d been fed proper meals and his mum’s treacle tart for dessert.
Legilimency was Draco's idea. They'd botched another mission as junior Auror partners, neither trusting the other to have his back. "Get it together, or you're both fired," Robards said behind his desk, his fingers steepled like he'd planned it all along. The Death Eater and the Saviour with Unsavoury Opinions, out of his way with only themselves to blame.
The Floo rang then, and Harry made an apologetic face, excusing himself for the moment. Draco took the opportunity to creep up the stairs, his curiosity getting the better of him.
In Little Whinging, what Harry remembers are the driveways rolled out before every squat house, lawns mowed flat, a stretch of sidewalk so straight that you could measure with it. What Harry remembers is trailing after the fumes putt-putting from Vernon’s dull-grey car as it took Dudley to school and Harry behind it, too-big trainers scuffing on the pavement in a meandering, unrushed lethargy, the sky a uniform blue all over, as though filled in with a single button-click.
"Oh, shut up, Potter," Draco says. "I know you're trying to goad me into letting you in. Come on up then. I'll make you your bloody coffee."
It was as though, at the age of one, the slingshot of prophecy had launched him forth, and he’d been scrambling to stop ever since.
"You take care of yourself, okay," Dean says when it's clear that nobody's coming to throw them all back behind bars. "Maybe drink a little less. Your mum worries—"
I don’t like how you say my name when I’m awake: the P spat, the Ts whetted, and every word circling, painful in their civility. In the day, you say my name, but it’s not yours or mine. Others take my name, people who learn it from the papers and use it like their own.
You don’t know much anymore, at least not in the way you did before, but you smell the worry percolating on his neck, so you follow the scent of lemon and soap to the sink where your hands drip blood and dirt down the drain until they run clear as rain. Draco stinks like relief behind you, and you think that maybe you are like a tide caught between the push and pull of the moon.
, I getcha." Ginny makes a cha-ching sound and winks, pointing her fingers at Harry. "Well, he's not wrong. I mean, you did save the world. So, in a sense, it's yours now."
," Draco murmurs, his ear against Harry's heart as he reaches around a hand and slides slick fingers back into Harry.
I waited one day before I came up behind him on the street and shot him twice. Just pressed the barrel into his wool coat and pulled the trigger. Then I caught him around the waist and moved his body to the side to watch the light die out of his eyes. You know, to make sure I’d done the job right.
“You’re lucky that I’ll let you have my move,” Draco says, his hands over my shoulders. “You can have everything I have.”
Harry stops Draco's wand with a hand on his wrist. "You keep doing that," he says. There's a soft, confident grin on his face.
It was one of those days when the sky hugged so low that I wanted to take a broom up through it and stir it up. “You could drown in a cloud like that,” Draco said, so I told him I’d be fine; I’d drowned in his eyes and lived.
Harry heaves him inside and levitates the vase to the entryway table before pressing Draco against the door. He groans into Draco's mouth, his hands riding up Draco's shirt to paw at his stomach. Their position is the same as the first time, but Harry's fingers slide slower over Draco's chest while his heart beats faster and faster. Even the door itself isn't the same, solid walnut replacing the tacky gilded beast that guarded the entrance prior.
Scorpius takes a step back. “My father warned me about this,” he mutters, jostling Albus with his elbow.
If time and time again serve true, then there is no reason for Harry to be at St Mungo’s that Monday. The Healer marks his scrolls and smiles his smile and says that Harry is dying and nothing can be done, the same as the week before.
Clouds build over lilac skies in mounds of pale peach and cornmilk, piling up like suds in a bath until Harry’s saturated, soaked through in hues.
Harry showed him out to the backyard after, and they did lazy laps in the metres above his garden, swooping in and out of the glint of the sun and chasing a good feeling in the wind. Joy squeezed too-big in Draco's chest. It was hard to breathe around it.
Maybe it’s because Draco’s not used to Potter on the field, or perhaps it’s because he’s always been hung up on Potter’s every move, but no one else seems to notice how Potter never takes a day off, never so much as scrapes a knuckle during missions. Draco’s heard of such sorcery before, but it’s Dark Magic, locked away behind heavy wards and shrouded in cautionary tales of damnation and destruction for all who seek its powers.
"I'm going to miss the leftovers," Ginny says around a mouthful of boneless chicken wings, her fingers coated in honey mustard. "I mean, I get that this is, like, your transformation montage. But are you sure cleaning off this table is
Harry gets up after Draco and watches his robes billow around him as he leaves. It reminds Harry of Snape, except it doesn’t, because they’re a deep cerulean, with silver detailing. Ravenclaw colours, on a Slytherin. Except Draco has never looked so good.
I’m alone when I sink into the Pensieve at last. I see myself in my mother’s arms, my name rolled off her tongue for the first time, her eyes like twin omens of death.
Draco adjusts the baseball cap over Harry’s eyes before dropping his hands onto Harry’s shoulders. Draco’s eyes are a crisp, intelligent grey, his mouth thinned in thought.
Harry signs the BroomBod. It's in the living room, cramped behind the squishy sofa and a stack of board games, five circulating fans pointed at it in a vain attempt to stay cool.
Harry holds a hand to the wall. Solid. He presses his ear to it, knocking, and nothing echoes back. A little giddy, Harry steps back and surveys the new blank space. Maybe he'll put up coat hooks and a mirror, a shallow dish for things he'll need on the way out the door. He should write that down, though he has no idea where to procure coat hooks. He could Transfigure them, but… no, he wants something more solid. Permanent.
“It’s fine,” Harry says. He reaches an arm around and tugs Draco to his chest, their pillows already pressed together.
"I'm sick," Harry says. "Not terminally ill. Just — magic sick. Like my magic's… disappearing. I dunno exactly how. Nobody does, anyway; St Mungo's says they've never heard of it before. Also, I think I'm gay."
Except I do. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a biro-hating, old-fashioned Pureblood now than I ever was. But there is something about a man who, in a fraught, new world of instant gratification, takes time out of his day to write out his love to you with his own hand. I don’t reciprocate in kind, mind; I’ve not the patience. But I love him, and I love that he does.
"Oh, I dunno. When's the last time you asked about me? I don't mean to guilt you—just, you were out of sorts for so long, and now finally…now finally...I mean, who knew Draco Malfoy would be the one to—"
No, you can’t. No, you must. No, that’s wrong. No, that’s right. Draco’s favourite word is No, and Harry knows this because they’re Auror partners so they share the same office and the same suspects and sometimes even the same plate of chips, or the same bed. In bed, Draco is even worse, a near litany of Nos. No, we can’t. No, we shouldn’t. No, not like that. No, I’m ready. No, go slower. No, faster. No, don’t leave, please don’t leave.
"The numbers say there's a chance. Even when the odds are one in a million, there's a chance. Do you need me to do anything?"
"Oh, Harry," Hermione whispers. "I'm so sorry I made you feel that way. But you'll always have me." She climbs onto his bed and takes him into her arms as sobs bubble up and foam in his throat. She misses her Wireless interview the following day, but it's fine; she says it's fine.
His skin is made of eggshell, his eyes of marble grey. Too lovely to touch but smooth, you imagine, and you would be wrong.
Harry slides his cock up the cleft, his zipper catching against Malfoy's skin. "Let's get out of here," Harry whispers into Malfoy's perfectly-shaped ear. When did Malfoy get so fit? His arse has never felt more slappable.
"Lube me up," Harry said. "Like you did with Neville's gloves last week. Poor bloke dropped every last Quaffle—"
. But of course the Saviour would be blessed with nothing less than perfection. That was what you won when you were a winner: the girl, the fans, the washboard abs.
Draco swings his legs over and slides into Harry's lap, his arms hung around Harry's neck. "Getting close," he murmurs, breath tickling down Harry's spine. "Merlin. Please."
It was hard to see Mother’s face behind the shadow of her black veil. I squinted at it though I knew that behind the veil was another mask. Mother’s face was of granite and ice. It had lied to the Dark Lord. And I was just a boy who should have known better, so I never stood a chance.
"I can't leave my clothes strewn over my mattress all the time," Harry argues without much heat, his eyes still trained on the closet door in anticipation of its undoing.
I killed Neville in the toilets at Rosamunde's, though of course he didn't see me until I let the Invisibility Cloak slip to my shoulders. Then he started begging for his life. But it was too late; he wrote his fate the moment he took campaign money from Death Eaters. I was just carrying out the ruling.
“He didn’t say much about you,” Draco said. He stood in the middle of Harry’s bedroom wearing trousers and a clean linen button-down rolled up to his elbows.
"I'm on my way out. I've only stopped by to—to tell you off, because you deserve it, with how you've treated me, you
Harry doesn't know what to do after Ginny's gone, so he makes himself a drink and watches the people walk by outside his townhouse until he's so bored that he can't think clearly anymore, as if a scarf's been wrapped around his brain.
In the weeks that Harry leaves, Draco stays behind and talks with the trees, who never talk back except with the wind (soft rustlings, or sweet murmurs of agreement). He tries not to worry about Harry, but of course, he does, in a burrowing sort of way. Draco thinks that he can wait forever, by the lake. He can pretend Harry is eternally on the verge of coming home.
Harry gets off his broom and casts, winds and mists and the wet smell of grass uncurling under a purple sunrise erupting from the tip of his wand. He gets back on the broom and watches the number of co-riders climb to a precipice: one-thousand, two-thousand, three-thousand. Ten thousand join in the last five minutes, and then the screen goes black. Harry pants, thoughts of terrorism or anti-magic bombs leaving him out of breath and panicked. But then the screen lights up again with the words: "Sorry for the inconvenience."
Harry doesn't ask why Malfoy's doing this because he doesn't want Malfoy asking him either. "Because you fucking hate me" isn't something he wants to confess aloud, even if it is the truth.
"It's like we swapped places," Malfoy laughs after. "You're alone in the last relic of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, and I've got two roommates and a Victorian terrace in a Muggle part of town."
The potioneer’s words sound like a threat, and when Harry responds back he sounds dangerous too, or angry, at least. Harry says, “Piss off, Malfoy. I’m less dead than I was without it. It’s the only way I want to live.”
I’m not sure why I didn’t kill him the moment he started asking questions that had me second guessing my truth. Sometimes you don't know these things until you pull the trigger. And I don't want to do that anytime soon. Not when there’s Augustus Rookwood to murder instead.
“I’m not hungry anymore,” Harry decides, and Draco nods, his eyes drooping once more, dreamy as though he never woke up. They leave the pomelo on the counter, for later.
Harry opened his eyes. He pulled the door shut and smoothed down his robes, his eyes sliding once more over the worn, brass knob.
Pansy dumps the bag on the counter and counts out her coins. She can hear Draco breathing from the other end of the line, but she's back on the pavement before he speaks again.
," Ginny ploughs on, rolling her eyes. "Someone's got to do the dirty work, and Slytherins are so naturally attuned to it. Something about their personalities… I mean, not all of them, obviously, but Draco has the experience to stomach it. It's no coincidence that so many of them are in elected offices. Merlin, as much as I make fun of Hermione, I don't envy her either. Politics are so damn
“I’m sorry. I know you wanted to try surfing,” Draco says. There’s sand kicked up on the back of his legs, and he’s starting to sweat, the sun beating down heavy with guilt.
The room has no windows, no furnishings. There is no light except the single candle that melts the minutes by in drips.
, which is crap because Tuesday is as good of a night as any for going out. So it's only Ron and Harry tonight, and Harry's been trying to lose Ron since they pulled up to Nylon. Nothing's duller than a goody-two-shoes cling-on when Harry's dying for anything, anyone unexpected.
Inside Harry's mind is an ocean and only an ocean. "Thought minds were all like that," Harry says, treading water and holding Draco up until he stops choking on seawater.
"The wallpaper goes last," Draco says. "Call Pansy at the number I gave you, and she'll help you figure out what else to get."
And yet, why had others, who had not the slightest inclination toward numbers, known with such certainty?
Ginny has a contemplative glow to her face. She polishes off the popsicle and starts chewing on the stick.
Harry runs a finger down where Draco’s handkerchief rubbed raw and recalls when Draco kissed him last night and said that he was in love with him. Harry said there was no use in loving a dying man, to which Draco replied, “we’re all dying,” like dying comes in one colour for everyone, and that colour is grey.
"I don't want to be rich," Harry says, then laughs over how stupid he sounds. Not rich! He's no more than a line in a history book if he isn't also rich.
“Shut up,” you say. You pull me in by the collar and cut your tongue against my fangs. Your blood burns, trickling down my chin. “Shut up,” you say. “Shut up and let’s go.”
“This our little secret,” Nana whispers at the station come fall. Draco nods and squeezes his eyes shut until the spinning stops, and there is Mother again, and socks, and cake cut into tiny little pieces so small that Draco forgets what they used to be.
So, when Draco Malfoy builds a budding career in Muggle skateboarding, of course Harry Potter is going to notice even if Draco grows his hair ragged and inks his arms up in tats.
Ginny pinches Harry's cheek and pulls until it hurts. "You're really quite ordinary," she says. "I don't understand the fuss."
His watch says five-pm, which means it’s one, here. In his mind, he sees Harry swing his leg over a broom and surge toward the setting sun. Draco soars behind him, arm outstretched, just out of reach—like a monkey grasping for the moon.
"That's kind of hot," Harry said. Harry's dick was already dripping—Merlin, Draco wanted to lick it so bad, his cock jerked.
They make a sweep of the kitchen, the bathrooms, the bar. Then Draco takes them back through the parlour to the closet in the entryway.
A woman dressed in a striped mauve power suit waits at Harry's doorstep when he gets back. "Mr Potter. It's so good to see you. I love what you said at Hermione Granger's rally tonight. It was tremendously moving," she says before he can tell her to fuck off.
“You can’t drop me in medieval Merlin-knows-what dressed up like some wicked witch and expect me not to — mmph!”
Draco turned eighteen, and, along with the trust, inherited a house from his late great-aunt. Renovations were an easy distraction at first, though the exterior required little more than a fresh coat of paint. The original entryway, with its pink granite steps and scallop-shelled columns, retained much of its youthful charm, and the frieze only needed a thorough dusting before it galloped brightly between floors.
“The only perk is that I don’t share,” Draco says, which is a lie because Harry can see two kittens peeking out from a stack of magazines under the nightstand/coffee table.
"You better put the kettle on, tea lad." Pansy rapped the paper over the table and stood up, swinging a black purse over her shoulder. "Off to work for me, then. Don't burn the house down."
When Harry confronts him about it with his fists clenched and his face blotchy and red, Draco says, “Can’t you see, my life’s finally begun,” and wishes Harry believed it too.
The light is dim when Harry wakes again—not dark enough to drink, but too late to do anything else. Harry is bored again, so he picks a bar at random and watches the bartenders prep while the cleaning crew mops up the last of yesterday's puke. Ron joins him for a drink at ten but begs off after an hour for "a date".
"Why?" Draco crosses his arms, but the wrinkle in his brow spells more concern than pity. "I'm not questioning your decision, but why don't you want to?"
Harry brushes a thumb across Draco’s mouth to quiet him. Then he tells the barman to bring them another round.
"Look at you," Draco sneered. "All dressed up in your Headmaster robes with not a single hair out of place. Did you even grieve at my funeral? Or did you spit in my grave."
Sure, he forgets things, but Harry’s figured out a system. The potion comes in waves, leaving troughs of lucidity in the morning for Harry to jot down agendas for himself. The rest of the day follows easily as 1-2-3. One, shower. Two, work. Three, the apothecary. Every day the potioneer’s brows raise higher and higher, but he never speaks, because they’re not friends, or so Harry thinks anyway, he can’t remember why. Maybe they dated before, and it didn’t work out. It’s a shame, because the potioneer is really devastatingly attractive, with his crisp angles and flinty grey eyes, exactly Harry’s type, and Harry is lonely enough to want even through the fog of forgetfulness.
It’s ten when Draco stumbles toward the bathroom. Ginny catches him on the way back and asks if he wants breakfast.
The toilet flushes in the adjoined loo. Harry waits for Draco to turn on the shower before reaching for the invitation despite knowing full-well its contents. Lavender and Parvati were his friends first, though he already prepared his excuses. Their wedding, only three years prior, was a pastel lace fantasy, the air so thick with strawberry bubble butterflies that Harry coughed up suds for days. He isn't sure he can stomach a repeat performance for all the fruit wines in the world.
"I'm a good lay. Considerate," Ron likes to boast. But if that's true, then his fry-ups must be shit because none of his hookups ever stick around for seconds.
The man grins, his canines flashing. "You know him? Bit of a screamer, bit of a biter, that Malfoy. They all come out of Hogwarts that feisty?"
"Give me some fucking credit. Potter doesn't go handing out forgiveness like some sort of clemency Robin Hood. I bloody
"This is exactly why we won't work. I just think we're better off as friends. Or acquaintances, whatever you want. Please, Harry. I don't want to end things on a bad note like this."
Inside was an entirely different story. Draco's great-aunt lived during a century when every activity required its own room—dining separate from cooking, billiards separate from entertaining, and so forth—dark, cramped rooms with little light and four corners of cobwebs—that it was easier to knock the walls down than replace the moulding wallpaper.
