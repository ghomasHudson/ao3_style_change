Draco’s mouth was held open by a steel ring wrapped in silk that was large enough for Harry’s dick to fit snuggly into. Instead of the expected hole, Harry discovered a clear crystal phallus-shaped dildo entertaining his Pet’s tongue. Two leather straps firmly tied behind his head kept both the ring and dildo in his mouth.
Fifth was the irrefutable proof that legends concerning magic and her guardians were, in fact, not legends at all, but truth. Sixth was the sheer brutality in which Granger was disposed of, closely followed by Looney Lovegood’s act of sacrifice at point number seven. Numbers eight, nine and ten – to the surprise of none – involved the appearance of the Weasley twins the deplorable act of the Ministers Ex-Undersecretary and the twins’ actions of turning said woman into a being that she despised more than werewolves.
“Now, as your punishment from us due to you doing something illegal is that you are not allowed to go anywhere without either your mother or myself and there is no hope in hell and beyond that you will be going anywhere NEAR that red-head. And if you know what is good for you, you will distance yourself from him at school as well.”
Tobias was listening, taking Draco’s words to heart. “Is … is that why I’m angry about the fact I was forced into it, but not scared to let another touch me in that way, like muggles are?”
Sally-Anne smiled. “I know I didn’t but I wanted to. If anyone deserves to be happy it is him.”
“Open your eyes,” Neville ordered, almost leaping with joy when the red head’s eyelids opened to reveal eyes still glazed in sleep. “Close eyes,” he said instead of giving into the urge.
Tobias nodded. “Go get one of them and meet me in the floo room in five minutes.”
“Some believe that the behaviour that the bearer – or mother – exhibits reveals the nature of the child. I know that in Sal’s case this was true – but in many it wasn’t.”
“You have our acceptance youngster. It has been far too long since someone has been able to beat him in a verbal confrontation.” She smiled. “Am I right in believing you are one of our heirs?”
“What gave us away?” Fred asked with a roll of his eyes “The multi-coloured owl, the parchment that burst into glitter, itching powder and water droplets when lit on fire or the two distinct hand writings on the envelop?”
“Now I’ll show you what the only thing you are good for, Freak.  And guess what?  No-one is going to help you, because no-one wants a freak like you around.”  With that he pushed his dry fingers deeply into the boy’s anal passage, making the Raven-haired youth scream.
“I can’t find a way for Ateria and Ateros to break the marriage contract to the Patil twins without them losing all the respect they have earned for themselves. I’ve looked and I can’t find a way out for them.”
Severus disappeared through the door and before it shut Draco heard Rowena say, “Oh dear. I think the hormones have revealed themselves.”
“Good answer,” a familiar voice said, making Tobias relax slightly.
“I have a job for the two of you,” Tobias stretched. “First I will tell you the rules, then you will say if you accept, then I will tell you what the job is. Are you interested so far?”
“Pateras?” Tobias asked in confusion.
Tobias pushed back and moaned. “I can’t wait.”
Hearing a yelp of happiness, he exchanged a grin with Tobias. It seemed that two of their pack members missed their two younger pack-mates more than the rest of them. He chuckled when one of the wolves raced out to meet the two girls racing toward them.
“I’m with you there Brother,” Fred replied with a scowl at the papers before them, “but we need them to ignore us so we can get information from them. Tobias said he is working on this newest problem for us.”
With that, Harry rammed two fingers into the tight hole, his moans of pleasure at the tightness around his fingers getting drowned out by the shriek that tore out of Draco’s throat as he was forcefully violated.
They chuckled softly as he nuzzled sleepily into Draco’s side. No one was surprised when a table filled with food appeared in the middle of the room. They were surprised by the twin growls that came from Tobias’ and Luna’s stomachs. Both of them looked down at their stomachs and blinked in shock. Ginny giggled softly when the two of them poked their stomachs and a look of awe came over Tobias’ face.
“Oh Gods I want you ‘Bi. So fucking badly. I want to lick, kiss, suck and bite my way down your body before I sink into you slowly, claiming your depths for me and me alone.” He stopped so he wouldn’t whimper and started to push his groin into Tobias’.
“Every morning for the next week that design will be cut deeper and deeper into your flesh. At the end of the week, it will appear as if it had never been done, but the deeper muscle will need to heal naturally, so it will hurt until it heals. Magic cannot, and will not, heal it. This is your first warning, Severus. To make sure this lesson sticks, you are forbidden to see Lykos, except for times when you must. This is for three weeks. That means no hugging, kissing or mating. Do I make myself clear?”
The woman disappeared, followed closely by the two daemons. Hermione sighed in relief before looking up right before a large white wolf slammed into her. The last thing she heard was her own terrified screams.
Where were you studying?” he asked, looking at Neville suspiciously.
Madam Elisabeth Greengrass
Seeing that their charge was asleep and seemed to be inclined to stay that way, the three men separated. Tom to his rooms, Severus to Snape Manor, a frantic werewolf and a sulking blonde youth and Lucius to Malfoy Manor and his wonderful wife.
“You are extremely powerful, and that dangerous that there is recorded evidence of my father admitting to being terrified of you. Even your own father is careful not to piss you off too much – Even though I have to admit that it is funny watching you with house-elves.”
“I don’t know,” Draco sighed before growling at himself in frustration. “Tobias is not acting like himself and while I get that it is due to his pregnancy, I don’t understand WHY he has changed so much and when I asked his Healer about it he answered but with so many terms and words I don’t know or understand that I feel more confused than before!” By the time he had finished, Draco was panting slightly and as he slowly calmed himself, he became aware of the soft chuckles coming from the portrait. He scowled at the painted man who raised both arms in surrender.
Warnings: Top!Harry. It is also rated M for a reason people. I will state that even though some sections may seem like non-con, Draco is a very willing participant in everything he gets.
“Oh no! What time is it?” Ginny asked.
You see colors no one else can see
“I can’t wait to see his face when he gets the reply from this letter,” Fred chuckled.
“I do not know what my Pack members will encounter,” Tobias stated. “No matter what they encounter through the day, once they are ready to end until the following day, they are expected to use a potion that will leech damaging components from their systems. At the end of each week, however, I wish for them to have a deeper cleansing.”
Everyone turned to see twin female houseleves standing behind Dobby.
Severus smiled, nearly killing all students and most of the teachers in the hall. “Congratulations, Tobias. And welcome to the family.”
“People like what?” Remus asked, bringing both Professors’ attention to him, Tom, Lucius and Narcissa.
Tom groaned softly and rose to his feet. Before he left the room, he stopped and turned to face Severus.
My Fair Lady.”
In the blink of an eye, Draco had somehow managed to change direction so he was before Tobias with one arm around his waist and the other resting on the back of Tobias’ head. “I wanted to spend the evening with you, honestly I did Love, but Father dragged me from the dining Hall and stuck me to as seat when I tried to leave after hearing he wanted to talk about things that could wait to be done tomorrow. I’m sorry baby, please forgive me.”
“George,” Tobias asked gently as he ran a hand through the too silent man’s hair. “Do you disagree with the contract?”
“It’s gotten to the point that the money we get from our contacted investors is pocket change. We could last about eight years if we stopped taking the money they provided us – including what we get from the product sales and just used our share of the money we made selling our pranks from last year to now alone.”
“It’s enough to give you a toothache, isn’t it?” Theo asked, amusement written all over his face as he watched the married couple.
Chuckling, Tobias and Draco walked to their place under the banner, where they ate, seemingly oblivious to every eye in the Hall focused on them.
“Even though there seems to be a lot of work,” Ginny mused.
When the teacher dismissed the class, Draco fled. He had a raven-haired Adonis to snog the breath from.
Amelia chuckled ruefully and gladly tossed the potion back. She let out a sigh of relief. “Almost over,” she muttered softly to herself as she too headed into the tent she was using. This last group was even more difficult to manage then the other years combined seeing as it was this year level’s students who were the reason for them being there. Add to that the fact that The Pack, as she had started to think of them, had to be split between Healers and Algernon insisted on getting the reports of each of the individuals, as was his right as their personal healer. He also state that he, and only he, would insect Tobias.
“I think I may have an alternative solution for the two of you,” Minerva smirked, “at least for Mondays. I have my fifth year Gryffindor/Raven claw class first up on Mondays followed by my sixth years. Tobias can sit in on that lesson and do either homework or anything else he feels like doing – as long as it is quiet.”
“How do you know?” Draco asked seriously, suddenly wide awake.
“Nothing much,” Blaise returned, stretching. “We have all completed the work set for us by the professors, as you already are aware. It is too late to begin anything new as a group today because over three-quarters of the day has already past and we have a meeting scheduled for tonight – unless you plan on re-scheduling.” At Tobias’ shake of the head Blaise continued. “There isn’t much else to do until then.”
“What do you mean, Harry?” Hermione asked sounding as if she believed that what Harry had to say was just made up. “There has been no Death Eater activity this summer.”
Chapter 37
It was almost dinner time when the twins arrived in the rooms under the Chamber. They sat as one on a spare seat each and sighed in relief as the welcoming magi of The Pack relaxed them of their tension.
“Are you sure …”?
The Daemon chuckled – a sound remarkably similar to the rumble of a rockslide. “Tobias, Draco – Akzant’tra, what have I told you both about doing that?”
“Remus had an idea for how to get him to relax enough to sleep for the night. I hope it works.”
“What happened?” Severus asked quickly, looking ready to run out of the room.
She froze at the look on Tobias’ face and the angry growls coming from the youngsters that were now surrounding her.
“Didn’t you feel the magic that was attacking our wards, Draco?” Lucius asked, shakily. The two boys looked at each other, blushing slightly. Remus started to sniff the air around them, before growling.
As one the two of them rose and handed in their third paper each. With a slight nod to the other, they walked into separate booths for their third practical.
“You need a re-sort Sir. And might I add that I hope this time you will allow me to put you into the correct house?”
Luna grinned at the older male. “I knew there was a reason I allowed you to join me here!” She then turned serious. “Are you ready for Phase two?”
Pansy nodded. “Both your parchments are the same. The two of you are to focus on your jobs. If anything else pops up, just add it to the list and send a message to either Alpha or Skoteinos outlining what it is about.”
“My advice, should you wish it, is to allow yourself this time to sort everything out. Listen to your body. If you need sleep, then sleep. If you need to scream, scream. If you need to make Lucius look like a prude, then jump Draco at dinner time.”
Draco nodded, speechless at the pure emotion coming from those green eyes. A soft noise beside them made Draco jump. To his left was a centaur; his horse parts black with rust socks and light brown hair and tail. Behind him was a youngster who was obviously his foal. The foal held a tray with two green crystal cups and a pitcher of some chilled liquid. His Sire held a tray with covered plates and cutlery.
“I think that means that they’ve made their choice, Luc,” he announced into the shell-shocked silence that once more prevailed.
Tom sat in his favourite chair with a cup of tea in his hand, listening to Remus, Lucius and Narcissa discuss what had to be done now that there was a baby on the way when a cold chill ran up his spine. His jaw dropped when he saw four owls with smoking red envelops heading towards his manor.
“Once a full room has been completed in its entirety – that is, everything has been removed and stored for the girls and the boxes have been gone through by me, the six of us who are dealing with this will come in for a full day for a complete magical check and magical detox for foreign magic. As payment, we will donate all of the magic that is leeched and, depending on the amount that has been leeched, a maximum of five percent of our own magic to power the wards of Gringotts.”
“I think you are right,” Tobias said with a soft chuckle so as to not disturb the younger students who were working on their worksheets. “Do you mind me sleeping here?”
When the class was working to his satisfaction, he started brewing himself. His attention was shifted to the class when he heard a slight whining. Looking up, he found Tobias’ longing eyes on the potion he was making. Sighing, Severus indicated for him to help him with the remaining steps. After the potion was complete, a steaming goblet of it was placed into Tobias’ hand.
“We don’t know,” Seamus answered. “We were woken by a scream and came out here to find her like this.”
Tom looked Severus in the eye. “I trust you implicitly Severus. More so than anyone else with the exception of my son. This is the only way I could think of to relay that trust. So may I?”
“Before you go,” Lord Patil said, standing. “Can you give this to young Mr Malfoy-Black? It isn’t important enough for him to handle it immediately, but it does concern the topic he and I discussed earlier today.”
“Before we leave … would you be willing to submit these memories as evidence?” Zleva asked.
It was time for the games to begin!
George had requested that his Alpha come since it was vital that the two of them have a chaperon. Tobias had agreed and Draco had invited himself along so he could take Tobias for lunch when the couple was with Padma’s father.
Minerva nodded her understanding and raised her cup to her lips.
“With this group studying the way it has, not only have we tied with Granger in all classes already, the younger years have started to copy us in our revision timetables. Due to this, Slytherin is in league with Ravenclaw for most time spent in the Library this year,” Blaise added.
Severus nodded and before thinking, he pulled the boy before him into a hug. “Thank you Bi. Thank you.” Almost running, he headed towards the Headmasters office to make his excuses.
“Then follow us, its dinner time,” Draco started, gently helping Tobias to his feet when he started blinking sleepily.
“We, Mr Weasley, did nothing but get him away from the muggle’s house while they were under a Death Eater attack. Draco, Severus and I are members of an organization that is dedicated to the eradication of the Dark Lord. We – unlike the over-cooked chicken club …” The sixth year Slytherins smirked, knowing that the senior Malfoy male had taken that wording from Tobias. The members of the Order of the Phoenix all shouted out at the same time.
“Perfectly,” the Healer said through anger clenched teeth, glaring at the two people who had dismissed her as unimportant. She would show them who was unimportant; after all, her father was one of the top people at St Mungo’s: No one would dare fire her for fear of losing their own job. She smirked at that thought and left to tell her ‘boss’ that the frigid bitch wanted to see him.
“Fred and George! I’m going to get you for this!” Ginny yelled from her perch on Fred’s shoulder.
“Many of the Ravenclaw students are starting to believe that there is something going on behind the headmaster’s closed doors. They’ve figured that you have always listened to him all the time in the past and so he must have done something to alienate you. Don’t be surprised if more Ravenclaws watch your actions more closely. Many of them will join us if asked, but they will ask for information in exchange.”
“If you are talking about the cub arriving, then yes it is,” Neville replied with a small grin, even as he winced at another screamed yell of pain.
“I’d like to know that too.”
Neville frowned thoughtfully. “I think I will watch. Nothing you do will make me look at you differently. We are all members of the same Pack and your talent makes no difference to that.” He placed a hand on her shoulder. “We all are loyal to our Alpha – even if we show it in different ways.”
“And my ex-friends say they hope my stay at my aunt’s and uncle’s place was safe enough for them, and they expect me to keep wearing their ‘gift’ until I am back at Hogwarts, where all the teachers will be on hand to keep me from getting too out of control. I am also expected at the Burrow for the last two weeks of the holidays – gods keep the wind beneath my wings and iced water in my heart. They’ve also become a couple. What’s the bet that Granger’s preggers? Oh, and you’re going to have Ron in your potions class, Sir. It seems someone pulled strings and so he got an E. Granger brags she got O’s all the way through and makes it sound as if I couldn’t have passed as high as they did because I was an uncontrollable monster last year. I haven’t opened my O.W.Ls yet. I was just about to after I finish this. What is this anyway? It’s good!” He took another mouthful form the bowl and Severus laughed.
Tom just looked at him levelly. “So you are the one responsible for everything that has happened to my son. I will give you a warning old man. You come anywhere near MY son – particularly while he is in such a delicate state – and I will show the world just how dangerous I can be – muggleborn or not.”
Lucius laughed harder than he’d ever done before at the look on his son’s face in that moment. It wasn’t until he fell on the ground holding his ribs that Draco could get Tobias to calm down and let him go. By this time, the Slytherins had lost their fight to stay aloof.
A trial
“Yes, Lord.”
“They need our permission because we are the entrance to the rooms, Sal,” Godric tied to reason with his angry mate. Salazar huffed and left with Godric following him.
Draco looked down at Tobias, still shocked at the tone he had taken.
“Combination short soup with venison, pork, prawn, mushroom and chocolate wantons and garlic, chilli and coriander juice.”
Draco grasped the appendage and placed a soft kiss to the back of it. Almost instantly Tobias collapsed onto the mattress in relief as most of the pain left his body.
“Now where was I?” he mused out loud.
Neville smirked once he had his back to the room. Last night was FUN!
“Pateras! What in the world are you wearing?” Tobias asked between breaths.
The reporters surrounding him tittered with fake amusement.
Everyone turned to look at the two on the bed to find Tobias beginning to rub his head along Draco’s jaw line. Within moments the two boys were back in their room at the school thanks to Thanatos.
My Fair Lady.”
“I accept young Lord,” Luna said just as soft and she removed one of her arms to hold a hand out to grasp his extended hand. It wasn’t until after Vince had planted a soft kiss to the back of her hand and was standing that the twins released their hold on the girl’s waist. Vincent caught her as her legs gave out on her and silently carried the petite girl back to his seat at the Slytherin Table.
Tobias’ voice answered. “By the time Drakontas and I die, Pateras, Zog and Booph will have out-lived the time for them to serve the Mother and Father. When we die, we will be taking over from them.”
“Last but not least, our light mage, Epikindynos – Dangerous,” Ginny stepped forward, “and our torture expert Kyria – Lady.” Ginny and Luna removed their cowls, smirking at the crowd.
“And lastly, do you, Hermione Granger, promise to stand by any and all punishment – no matter what it is – by the hand of the one who was Harry James Potter?”
“Professor Snape?” he asked politely, “What potions are we doing this week?”
Tobias shook Achalendra’s hand and gave an exhausted smile. “I’m glad we could sort everything out today. I hope to have the chance of working with you again in the future.”
“I am disappointed in everyone here. When I ask for someone or something and I cannot get it myself, I expect you all to see that it gets to me when I ask for it. Is that understood?” Everyone nodded silently. Tobias nodded and looked at Severus and Remus.
Ginny watched with sadness in her heart as she watched how her friend and Lord were being treated by the youngest of her elder brothers. The list of things he could do were down to four. Eat, sleep, breath and go to the bathroom.
“It’s the Potter boy, milord,” Severus answered, succeeding – just – to keep his voice calm. He turned back to Lucius. “If we don’t do something now, he will die.”
“I remember when Susan’s mother was pregnant,” she answered the unasked questions. “You did not get between her and  her cravings, her and her bath or wake her when she wanted sleep if you not only wanted to live, but keep all your limbs as well.”
Tobias looked at Draco as if he wasn’t using his brain.
“I wanted the soup,” Tobias replied whit a whine.
Everyone was silent as the two bounced words off the other as they walked up the centre of the tables.
First, she explained to him what he had done wrong and told him to not expect any member of The Pack to want anything to do with him until they had discovered for themselves that no physical harm had occurred to either Tobias or the baby and not to worry if they didn’t warm up to him until after Tobias forgave him. She also told him that it was the hormones that drove Tobias into such hysterics, stating that if he weren’t pregnant then the boy would have just told him where to shove it and walk out.
“How do you know he had been wrongly assured that you had been trained?”
“I remember when Susan’s mother was pregnant with her. Most of the family had to look away in disgust when her cravings hit. I didn’t think they were too bad if I’m honest. The worst it got was blood ice-cream with cockroach clusters mixed in.”
Albus smiled malevolently. His plan was complete; it was just a pity that he would have to wait for a few months to carry them out. He was disappointed that he couldn’t harm the brat due to him being the Founder’s Heir, but he could hit him hard by attacking that which was most important to him. A knock on his door had him quickly hide the parchment containing his plans.
“A moment before you continue with your morning,” Minerva called out as she stood. “As classes are cancelled until further notice, your Professors will spend today setting a list of things each year level will need to cover by themselves. I will also be setting aside time in my day for each year level for a tutorial if anyone needs aid. I believe your other Professors will also do the same. You are all responsible for picking up those worksheets and guidelines yourself AFTER you are through your appointment with the Healer.”
Tobias gaped, making Severus smirk. “Yes, Neogennito, I know you have eaten only a few times since the first time you had to leave your father. As the only godfather of yours here, it is my duty to make sure you eat, make sure you take the right potions and to tell your father that you’ve not been eating. Do you really wish for me to be on the receiving end of your father’s cruciatus?”
Severus sobbed into an exasperated Remus’ shoulder as everyone else in the room glared at him. He had just finished telling the four of them what had occurred and none of them – least of all Tom – was happy with him.
Draco smiled and nodded. “Well, half the reason. You’ll get the rest of it later. I contacted the Malfoy house-elves and ordered a special celebratory dinner for the two of us.” He smiled charmingly. “We haven’t yet celebrated your pregnancy and I thought that we should do so tonight.”
“A tea service for The Pack please,” Tobias muttered. “Don’t forget Lykos, Nona, Nonos, Anadochos and Pateras. Can I have a soy chai latte? I need something sweet.”
“Melody,” Tobias said, looking up for the first time since she had been placed in his arms. “Melody Rue Malfoy-Riddle.”
“Draco Lucien Severin Malfoy the third! What the fuck did you do to me? How the fuck did you do it to me? Give me a reason, give me just one gods-be-damned reason why I shouldn’t hex you where you sit!”
Without a word, Draco managed to get Tobias’ semi-limp body to lay face down so he could access his back. He smiled to himself when his husband’s body relaxed far enough to allow him to drift into slumber. Even with his husband asleep, Draco continued to massage the cream into his skin – being very careful to keep himself firmly seated in Tobias’s passage like he had been asked.
She stopped and sipped at a cup of water that Amelia poured for her. “Both letters were addressed to Albus and it was obvious they hadn’t been opened before they got passed on to me. I signed the correct forms and the port keys that had been given to them went off. I got a report from the Healer stating that it was vital that a few precautionary steps be taken to ensure Tobias’ health later in the pregnancy. One step was him needing a certain type of chair for extra support.”
“This goes for your behaviour towards your fellow student as well,” Xing Wu stated from his spot in the line. “Each group will hold at least one student of each house. If we even suspect that someone was attacked in any way due to the house they were in or because of something equally stupid, then you will be punished by one of us. Several members of upper and lower years have already been given the times for their punishment.”
Pansy took a sip of water to moisten her mouth and throat. “Skoteinos and I have Madam Greengrass on our parchment as well as Pack duties for when Alpha and Beta cannot make it – much like now. Madam Greengrass’ parchment will be placed on the opposite side of the Founder’s portrait for everyone to read and contribute too. The differences between Madam Greengrass and the rest of our targets is that we are actually only watching her and keeping her away from Alpha. She will only be a target if she gets too close to where she doesn’t belong.”
Tobias and Draco exchanged smirks as Severus scowled at Ron, Hermione and Seamus. It was finally Friday and after this double lesson, Severus would be free to see Remus for the first time in a week, so he was a just a tad more impatient than he normally was – which meant that the lesson was just that much more enjoyable for the Slytherins.
“And the other?”
Ron whimpered when sections of brick started to tumble out of their places in the bridge and into the water that, while closer, was still far below him. “MUUUUUMMMMMMY! He yelled as the bridge section he was attached to fell. He screamed as he saw the spiders’ web full of newly hatched spiderlings speed towards him., no longer paying attention to how many times a verse was repeated and by whom. He almost fainted in relief when the now familiar voice of salvation started to sing.
“Why is it unsafe to use his real name?” Lord Patil asked.
“These are most of my pack. Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Neville Longbottom, Ginevra Weasley and Luna Lovegood.”
“That is correct,” the goblin agreed.
Draco Malfoy – Drakontas [Dragon] - Beta
He sighed softly. He knew that there was nearly three weeks till their bonding and that for two of them, he and Tobias wouldn’t be allowed to touch, speak or see the other. He was worried because neither of them had slept alone since the night they were announced to the Death Eaters. He would be staying at Prince Manor with Severus, while Tobias stayed at Riddle Manor with his father.
Minerva frowned thoughtfully. She knew that something had occurred over the summer to drive a wedge between her three favourite students, but she didn’t know what. Hoping to get more of an idea of what happened, she sat across from the girl. “Tell me about the argument and I’ll see if I can recommend some texts to you.”
“The third time you fuck up, I will slit your throat and watch as you half drown in your own life’s blood. I will then kill you in the most painful way I possibly can. I am no longer the Harry Potter that you, Granger and the old bastard collared and sent home ready for abuse. I am more dangerous than you can possibly imagine, Weaselby. And I’d keep that in the fore front of your mind from now on and remember it before you think to speak to me and mine again. I’m not even going to tell you who you need to be watchful around, maybe it will mean that you will start thinking before opening the claptrap you call a mouth.”
Neville laughed half-heartedly. “Don’t I wish it were with a girl. Truth is I was trying to get ahead on the charms and potions homework. I gave the both of them up as bad jobs at about one, then had trouble getting to sleep due to dreams of drowning in barrels of armadillo bile and horned toad sperm.”
“QUIET!” He moved deeper into the room and collapsed gracefully into the seat he normally sat in and put his head into his hands. The room stayed silent while their Prince gathered his thoughts. “Is everyone in the house here?”
Tobias stretched. “I have divination, Astronomy and Transfiguration to complete. I half did them this morning before talking to Nonos. I say we have a break now and for about half an hour after the trolley leaves for us to eat. That way we have roughly four hours before we have to pack up.”
Tobias rose, looking down his nose at the older blonde male with disdain. “A house-elf represents the family he or she serves. If the Master or Mistress is happy with their elf, it shows in how that elf appears to others. The will be neater, less hyperactive and will have better control over their spoken grammar. There are many upsides to this: The biggest – to me as an expectant Mother – is that my child will compare Dobby’s speech to those of his fellows and see that I expect him or her to uphold the standards that our household has set. My child will NOT be learning bad speech patterns through the family help.”
“Yes, Nonos. That was the Basilisk responsible for the petrification of all those students in my second year. That was Slytherin’s Monster – and the guardian of the Founder’s Sanctuary.” He sighed and pulled a fang as long as his forearm from the bag at his feet and handed it to Lucius. “You keep this, Anadochos. It is the fang that almost killed me at 12 years of age. All the venom is out of it, so it is no longer dangerous. There are plenty of other fangs there that can be ground.” Tobias left the room as everyone stared at the fang.
“The bond between the two of them isn’t a creature/soul bond – but it is similar. Akzant’tra and his mate are soul mates and they have been since before Merlin’s time.” Booph glared at Remus, who had opened his mouth to ask another question. “The ‘creature’ part of the bond is due to something that occurred when we first took him to see The Mother. Only two people know what happened that day, but all of The Mother’s and Father’s minions know the result.”
I apologise for missing out on posting last night. Family came down for a few days and one of them stole my computer table to use as a bedside table. I will admit to this being my favourite Luna chapter :3 I hope you enjoy reading it just as much as I did writing it.
Draco nodded his agreement. “Are you ready for tonight’s meeting? I assure you that it is going to be a show not to miss.”
The only splash of colour in the bathroom came from the burgundy strips on the large bath sheets and the large vase of red carnations situated on the vanity.
“Both DA, Muggle Studies and History of Magic.”
You will be wearing gloves as you have to do this without magic. The boxes themselves will have a lightening charm on them, but you will both need to carry the box from the room. The furniture that is easy for you to move with only the two of you will need to be moved into the same room I will be setting aside for the boxes. I will tell one or two other people about what you are doing and they will be there for the items that the two of you cannot handle on your own. Once a room has been completely emptied, you are to stop until I say to continue. This will be so that I can sort through the boxes and furniture that have been removed and make records of everything before deciding what to do with it all – whether it be keep it, destroy it, restore it or give it away. I will also be doing my own reports on each item.”
The rest of The Pack and the three remaining adults looked at the two of them in awe. They had all felt the strain the wards had been under to contain the magic leaking from the two before them. Tom ended up admitting that they would be best in the place the Daemon’s were talking about.
“That is why we agreed to let you attend that school in the first place,” her mother cut in. Hermione nodded.
Now that the two were together, Ron got a good look at the two of them. The girl came up to the middle of the boy’s stomach and both had brown hair that held a hint of copper in it. When their eyes opened, he caught sight of a flash of deep brown before their lids closed again.
I apologise for not posting last night, I had no way of getting onto the site before I had to go to bed.
Tom swooped down and hugged his son in all but blood tightly – not caring that he had lost his fight with his tears. “I love you son. Next time you have a dream like that again, I want you to tell me, Lucius or Severus. After you are bonded, I will take you shopping for a snake. I know you have Thanatos, but when it comes time for his burning day, he is not very helpful. At least you will be able to talk to a snake.”
“What do we do if we find something that is too heavy for either of us to move?”
The two of them padded over to the side of the room where several camping beds had been set up. Without discussing it, they headed for the same bed, climbed onto it and curled up together. The last thing they did before falling asleep was send a soft pulse of energy to the rest of their Pack. As they were falling asleep, they felt a responding energy pulse and they fell asleep with smiles on their faces, much to the amusement of the Slytherins and bemusement of the Ravenclaws.
Tobias smirked. “You’ve never really gone through the library have you? If you had, you would have realised that amongst all the muggle books were some absolute gems.” Humming slightly, Tobias arranged five thin books on his father’s desk. Seeing Tom’s questioning look he grinned.
Hogwarts knew that the heir was close. She always knew, but until recently she had been forced to ignore his presence. This year she would not have to. He was close enough for her to be able to read his emotions. She chuckled to herself as his plans for the year were transferred to her. She had never liked that Dumbledore man, even when he was a child in her halls. She would do her part, as would the sorting hat. She liked this plan.
“This will bring a bit of interest to us in our lessons today Love,” Draco smirked, patting the butt of the intrusive object, making Tobias mewl. “Let’s get cleaned up and meet the others before heading to the hall for breakfast. Remember that we have a meeting with your Father tonight and you need to get our reports ready for that.”
Ginny and Luna lowered their quills in perfect synchronization on their last exam with a large sigh of relief. They had worked as hard as they could in the time frame they had been given. They were onto their fourth day in the room and they had finally gotten through all eleven exams and their practicals that went with them.
“What have you done to me!” she screeched as she tried to stand. “I demand you return me to normal right this instant!”
Characters: Harry, Draco
“Tobias, you are going to go into my office and work on the assignments I have written on the desk. I will ensure that every student will be properly cleaned of potion fumes before leaving here.”
“Maybe you should have told him about us before the meeting, Alpha,” an eerie trance-like voice said.
Draco rushed to his husband’s side, feeling slightly ashamed of how he had handled the situation before pushing it aside. He might not like it, but sometimes you needed to be blunt to get through his husband’s stubbornness. He silently picked his shaking husband up and carried him from the room, followed by an equally silent Pack.
“Mother? Father? Sev? What happened?” a concerned Draco gasped.
The Sorting Hat chortled. “Oh yes, I can see that you are most definitely theirs. Not that it is much of a surprise, what with the way you manipulated me in your first year. You, my lad, are Slytherin’s through and through.” Gasps could be heard throughout the hall. The Hat and Tobias ignored them.
“I am only asking because I overheard something the few times I was allowed near Dumbledore’s Order. He has been trying to convince the Weasley’s to petition for permission to marry them to Fred and George. I don’t know if it has been done, but if it has, I am telling you something that they don’t know. It will be ME that you will be going through if  the papers come in and can’t be reversed, not the older Weasleys. Fred and George are in my Pack so I know them best. Their parents have no say over ANYTHING.”
Booph and Zog tilted their head to one side at the same time. “They’re ready for you now. We leave in five minutes, so say your goodbyes.”
“The house-elves only gave us bubbly water, so my Sire allowed me to add the juice of crushed redcurrants in it. I hope I didn’t insult you by doing so, MaSirra.”
Tobias kept his eyes closed. “If she was here, she would hit you across the back of the head for teasing me about my lack of ceremony when you know all I care about at this point in time is being close to my mate until we are bound to the other so tightly physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually that nothing can come between us, or has it been that long since you’re bonding night that you can’t remember it?”
Taking it into a small room off the dining room, Harry curled up on a chair to eat and read. This is where Severus and Remus found him half an hour later.
Pansy shrugged. “I don’t know, Bi. I think The Lord just has a flair for the dramatic.”
Neville Longbottom – Skoteinos [Dark] – Tobias’ Second
The three men jumped when a house-elf popped in. “Master told Binky to get him when young Master is finished in his work room.”
Tobias groaned softly as awareness hit him. He felt very stiff and – for some reason – very gritty. Grumbling slightly, he stretched and blinked his eyes open.
As usual, please tell me if you find any mistakes :3 for anything else, enjoy XD
Lucius turned a very pale shade of green. “N-no thanks. I’ll be fine with my tea.”
Chapter 35
“That’s true,” Fred grinned as both he and George perked up.
Amelia opened her eyes, shocked at seeing herself face-to-face with Lucius’ son rather than falling like she was expecting.
“Tobias and I are going to have a nap,” Draco nodded towards his husband who was sleepily drinking his mango lassi. “You six can either join us or continue with the exams, you are free to choose.”
The lady smiled and ran a loving hand through the soft black hair it rested on before striding towards the terrified female.
Narcissa stood and hugged Tobias to her. “He can’t hurt you anymore, Bi,” she whispered.
The faces of the four teens almost glowed with delight at the small gesture. Laughing to herself, she indicated for them to head downstairs before her. Just as Neville was about to leave, she placed a hand on his arm.
A house-elf popped into existence before them. “Dinners is ready Sirs!” it squeaked before popping back out.
“Luna on the other hand is quiet the quandary. She reacted well to the healing spell, but the blood replenishers I give to her aren’t working all that well. I don’t know if it is because she has built up immunity to them or if she is allergic to one of the ingredients in it. Neville and Pansy have taken it upon themselves to write Xenophillous and inform him of what has happened and ask about her reaction to the potion. At the moment, she is comfortably wrapped in Tobias’ arms, deeply asleep.”
Fifteen minutes later he returned with a large plate of cold turkey and pasta salad. Ginny, Narcissa and Pansy giggled at the hum of appreciation that came from him. Remus chuckled when he noticed that Draco couldn’t keep his eyes off of his husband’s face.
“I wouldn’t miss it for the world – Now, help me wake Sleeping Beauty there so he can have something else to eat and drink before you leave for the Mansion. I’ll organise for everyone else to get there an hour before the meeting starts.”
The man held out two cups containing a thick green liquid. Tobias gleefully took one and started spooning it into his mouth. Draco looked between the other one that was still in the healer’s hand and his husband suspiciously. “What is it?”
“Beta? What’s wrong with Alpha?” Luna asked as he laid his head back. The room was so quiet you could have sworn you could hear the water in the lake moving.
Lucius blink twice before fainting. Severus chuckled slightly. Looks like today was going to be full of the unexpected.
Draco felt his jaw drop when a soft, slow sensual tune came on and Tobias was bathed in fae-light. His eyes widened as the dark-haired man started to dance in time to the music, slowly running his hands from thigh, over stomach to chest. When Tobias removed the outer section of his robe, Draco realised that he had planned for tonight to live up to Draco’s expectations, and as he watched the sensual sight before him, he vowed to make tonight just as special for Tobias.
“I apologise. Thank you Mr Malfoy-Black for silencing everyone so ... Efficiently. If they had waited a few moments longer than they would have understood why we are doing this.”
Draco tried – unsuccessfully, he admitted ruefully – to not laugh at his father and godfather as they sat in their seats, dripping with nutrient potion.
Severus sighed dejectedly. “Yes gios ek Skotadi,” he answered dutifully. “Longbottom, Lovegood. Please find a place to sit.”
Half an hour later both boys arrived with arms full of the now changed moonflowers. Together, they waked around to all the guests and thanked them personally before giving them a crystal flower to take home with them. All the guests looked at the flowers in awe, having seen what they had been like before the ceremony. When they go to Lucius and Narcissa, Tobias flushed slightly.
Mr Patterson exhaled in defeat. “You may go Mr Potter.”
The Pack organized themselves around their Alpha and Beta once again as the couple drifted off to sleep. Blaise smirked as his Grandmother moved from the room, shamefaced. It was evident that she had forgotten who her boss really was. He would bet a large amount of money that she was hoping this incident never got reported to The Lord – but it would, because his loyalty now lay with his Alpha and the rest of his pack – not with the humans beyond it.
The Mother smiled. “Normally I do make the two successors first bathe then eat, but it is not normal for us to have a mated pair as our chosen. For mated pairs, the rule is for them to eat then bathe, then meditate so there is no need for them to speak between bathing and meditating – less chance of temptation.”
Severus placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder and then sat on the mattress next to him, noticing but ignoring the slightly hesitant way his touch and presence was received.
“His plan was to have me destroy you and then for him to destroy me, or have us destroy each other and have him deliver the killing blow to the survivor, as a mercy stroke, of course.”
“What the Hell are you doing, Minerva?” Albus hissed. “That slut shouldn’t have ever become pregnant until after he killed Voldemort, then he would have been sold to the highest bidder! It still could have happened had the bastard growing inside him been terminated early enough!”
Pansy nodded and gave both rolled parchments to the girl in question. Luna took them with a serious nod before moving back to her place in the hemisphere surrounding the table.
George leapt forward and grabbed hold of the back of Dumbledore’s neck, his nails, still in their claw-like state, dug deeply into the skin with ease.
Both Severus and Tobias were shocked. Neville was the only being other than themselves that knew what each of the four ‘sweets’ did – and he was volunteering to eat them? Tobias looked deep into his second’s eyes and realised this was a silent apology to both him and Draco – a way of punishing himself with shame and embarrassment. Tobias nodded and handed the bags to Severus, who had moved to his side during his inspection.
* * *
“Granger, Weasley, the twins, Ginny, Dumbledore and my O.W.Ls,” Harry answered Severus’ raised eyebrow. “Ginny and the twins are checking to see if the muggles are treating me all right and to complain about Percy, Molly, Arthur, Ron and Hermione. They’re also saying that if I need a place to get away, I can stay with the twins in Diagon Alley. The old goat is reminding me that I cannot leave the muggle’s house due to the protection of my mother’s blood,” Harry snorted.
Tobias smiled. “Thank you, Pateras. I needed to hear that,” he admitted sheepishly.
Three hours and four calming potions later, Tom was seated in his office chair looking around in awe. The room looked much larger now that it was cream and tan in colour. The window was clean and open, letting in fresh clean air and natural light. All of the chairs found in the room were all cleaned of all stains and were comfortable to sit on. The book shelves along his walls were empty, but had been polished and each shelf had the topic of the books intended for it burnt into the front of it. The desk … Tom felt his breath catch every time he looked at his desk.
“Please Master, oh please!” Draco begged piteously as he tried to thrust into the hand on his dick and impale himself on the tongue that was gently lapping at his entrance.
“This house and everything in it is mine by right. I know what Sirius’ will said, and I now own this building. You can use it for your headquarters still, but understand that anyone who touches anything will be hexed, thrown out or cursed in accordance with rule 298 of the Wizard homeowner’s Law in this country. Have a pleasant life.” He smiled sweetly, then walked into the already green flames and disappeared.
I knew about that,” she barked before sighing in frustration. “I was in St Mungos for the entire summer. The newer blocks were added while I was there since my heart was giving out. I have started having the bonds on my magic removed slowly so my heart is strengthened slowly by my magic and a potion our resident Potion’s master makes for me.”
“As do I, my friend, as do I,” Minerva stated seriously.
Ginny smiled. “I’m positive they would be thrilled that you thought of them in your time of need,” she giggled softly.
The boys looked at the other. “ Um ... would the first of January be suitable?”
“Give me one damn good reason for me to not hex you until you can’t move tomorrow,” Draco hissed, his eyes narrowing dangerously
“Oops,”” Hani said with a smirk as the people in the room turned and glared at her. “Sorry about the door Little Lord,” she continued, focusing on the relieved look on Tobias’ face. “We only can to deliver a wayward husband after he was wrongfully removed from his station.”
Vincent Crabbe – Dynamo [Strength] – Guard; best with bladed staff
At the Slytherin table, a barrier of three empty seats had appeared around The Pack due to the angry growling that erupted from their chests. Tobias and Luna, who had fallen asleep with her head resting on Vince’s shoulder, frowned and fidgeted slightly which stopped everyone mid-growl.
Severus nodded, numb with shock. He started unblinking as Tom gently raised the sleave of his left arm and stroked the mark softly hissing. Within moments, the black mark disappeared leaving unmarked skin behind. Severus swallowed the lump in his throat as a thick platinum chain with a pendant that was the perfect blend of the Riddle and Slytherin coat of arms was placed in his hand.
With a sharp nod, The Pack – minus Tobias -  turned and gathered around the still slightly dazed Ravenclaw who had her head resting on Ginny’s lap while the red-headed girl hummed softly and ran her fingers gently through the blonde’s hair. With everyone’s attention on either Luna or Ginny or on the  retreating back of the feared potions master, no one noticed the dark eyes filled with pain watching every small movement that came from the girl.
Remus laughed.
Tobias nodded. “It is very useful, but a pain in the arse. I love Rowan though. And Helga is lovely. Hey Pateras? I think I know why you used to act like a Gryffindor with your plans, at least where they concerned me …” Tobias quickly ducked the hand sent to swat at his head. Chuckling, he turned to him. “Can I be blamed if we both have mixed Slytherin/Gryffindor blood in us?” he smirked as his father froze. “Yeah, Sal and Ric were bonded. They had at least two kids together too. You are descended from one, mum and I from the other. No wonder we are both fucked up. We are Gryffindors with Slytherin tendencies … or is that Slytherins with Gryffindor tendencies?”
“Need backing in.”
“’Bi apologises for not having owling anyone for the last week,” one of the twins murmured, making it look all the world like they were handing out testers. “The old fart has had Ron and Hermione stick that close to him that you’d think they’d been magically stuck to his arse. He wasn’t even allowed to talk to any of us.”
“Tell me how it reacts when you use it,” she said with a slight smile. “Once you use it, it will only respond to you.”
“Did you really see the Chamber of Secrets?”
“Maybe I should be the one to explain,” a deep, gravely voice rumbled behind the group. At the sound of the voice, both Draco and Tobias fell to one knee, head bowed in respect.
Tom flushed. “In my seventh year, my partner told me he was pregnant. The Transfiguration Professor overheard and convinced him to go to the nurse for a check-up. The next day, he turned up childless, in tears and hating life. Two weeks later I found him stone cold on his bed. He’d committed suicide. That was when I went insane. We were engaged and we couldn’t wait to start a family – That was why he had decided to take the potion while we were still in school. I am NOT going to allow him to do the same thing to MY son.
“You eat what Dobby brings you and you may have what you feel like for snacks,” was his reply.
Lucius caught his son’s eye and walked to him. “Alright, Draco?”
The oddly fitted couple had a very unique relationship and though it was difficult … and oft-times impossible … to see just which one of the two wore the pants, no-one could deny that the two loved each other and their two cubs dearly.
Both Amelia and Grapplefang gaped at the teen.
Two hours later, Vince and Greg escorted Draco to the lake. Draco wasn’t sure if he could believe it. Neither boy had left him at any time during the two hours, except to allow him time to shower and dress. They hadn’t even left to have their own food.
*looks around the corner of the building* Good news is ... I'm still alive ... bad news? I don't think I'll be able to hear much after this chapter for a while, so remember to talk really really loud
Minerva looked confused at best. “Ok, Miss Granger. Start from the beginning – I want the full story and don’t leave anything out. I don’t understand what you are talking about.”
“Please follow me to the Lake.”
Draco watched his husband as he dozed in his spot. Slowly, so not to disturb him, he manoeuvred himself so Tobias’ head was on his chest.
“We hear that congratulations are in order,” Remus stated with a smile. “We are here to make sure you are okay and to celebrate. After your last lesson, meet us in the entrance hall. We’re taking you out for dinner tonight.”
His thoughts were interrupted by a soft moan of enjoyment coming from his neck.
Draco quickly tied Tobias’ hands to the beds head and chuckled darkly. “You look perfect like that. You only need one thing ...” He thrust in as deeply as he could, causing the two of them to yell out in ecstasy. Almost immediately Draco set a fast, punishing pace, allowing neither Tobias nor himself to recover from the entry.
Tom glared at him for his interruption before turning back to his followers. “There is one thing I am going to say before we start on the reports. No one – and I meant no one – is to go anywhere near my son without being accompanied by one of the people you see on the dais, or a member of his Pack. There will be a celebration when I announce it as well to celebrate the new life growing inside my heir.” He smirked at the sharp intake of breath from the congregation. “Yes, my son and his partner are expecting a child in around 7-8 months, so don’t annoy either of them or you will be left to deal with a hormonal teenager with an itchy wand hand.” He smirked at the mass shudder that occurred due to his announcement.
“You look comfortable there, Akzant’tra,” a silky voice purred.
The Minister blushed slightly and cleared his throat nervously while indicating for the Aurors and Snape to go before him. As they passed Tobias and Draco, Tobias touched Severus’ arm and allowed a little of his magic to trickle down to the cuffs – which vanished.
Before he could react, Tobias was in the bathroom and in the shower. Chuckling, Draco followed him into the shower and revealed to him the pleasures of having someone scrub your back.
“The Raven is already in there, waiting for you, but before I allow you entry, I need to explain something to you.  The willow is the centre of the garden and it responds to The Mother and her chosen ones. The only times anyone enters the space beneath its canopy is to strengthen the wards and to add their magic to it. The magic you can see around the Willow is what will absorb the magic the two of you will be releasing. The strength of the wards after tonight will be the indication of how long the two of you will be serving after your ‘deaths’. The majority of the magic you release will not be used in the wards until you pledge yourselves as our defenders.” The Father smiled. “Now go and see your mate”
“You always prided yourself on being the ‘smartest witch of this generation’,” Neville stated incredulously, “but is still didn’t occur to you to research what was happening all because someone said it was for Tobias’ own good?”
“Come on ‘Bi,” he said as he stretched out his fingers to get rid of the cramp, “Time to head upstairs and eat.”
As he’d spoken flames had started to lick at his body. Dumbledore visibly gulped.
Severus sat as the scratching of quills on parchment filled his room. Gods he loved his life at the moment … or he had until a certain black-haired green-silver eyed teen somehow started to purr as Draco’s right hand stroked soothing circles on his left.
Severus snorted in amusement as he pictured his blonde friend lying on the floor throwing a temper tantrum with yelling, screaming and kicking because he didn’t get his own way.
He decided that he would head home and put that memory into a vial for Severus to watch. He would get more amusement out of watching Tom poke Ronald Weasley with a Potion Masters tool than anyone else.
Bill raised an eyebrow, “When?”
She glared at the gaping idiots around here, “The Slytherins only attacked us when we provoked them. My fiancée was a Slytherin and he got KILLED in an attack that was labelled ‘a prank gone wrong’. My niece’s mother was a Slytherin and she was the sweetest person you could ever hope to meet. Now, I don’t care if you are Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, Gryffindors or Slytherins, you are going to stand in line outside the tent you have been assigned in the order I called your names and you will NOT open your mouths to complain, swear, argue or anything that is not yawning, sneezing or answering questions. Anyone who goes against this will be undergoing punishment from this Council due to you endangering other students, us and yourself as well as wasting the time we have in this investigation.”
“Our guard detail, Bouno – Mountain,” Millicent stepped forward, “Dynamo – Strength,” Vincent stepped forward, still covered in the spy’s blood, “and Skia – Shadow.” Greg moved forward and they removed their cowls as one. When Millicent’s father’s hand shot out to grab her, his eyes widened. He had a dagger at his throat – courtesy of Greg – a bladed staff at his groin – courtesy of Vince – and a curved one-handed sword at his chest, right above his heart – courtesy of Millicent herself.
“You are marrying into a goblin-friend’s clan young lady,” Grapplefang replied with a grin, “It was my pleasure to answer it.”
Both adults exchanged wide-eyed looks when his words registered in their minds. They had just received confirmation on who the ‘Silent Partner’ the red-headed devils admired so much. In silent agreement, Amelia sat back in her chair as the Lord of the English branch of the Patil House rose and left the room in search of Lucius, Draco or Severus so the young man that was currently sleeping on Amelia’s lounge could be taken to his own bed and, presumably, worried family. For that, Achalendra realised, was what the group who called themselves ‘The Pack’ was – a self-made family of people who had, in some way or another, been dismissed as unimportant by the majority of the people around them.
“Well, Lykos, the problem is that you and Nonos decided to have your private dance lesson in the sitting room that we were scheduled to arrive in. Now that isn’t a bad thing, but you both fell asleep before you could use a cleaning charm or get dressed and/or covered. Good thing none of us are prudes in this house and as much as my Pack is enjoying the view, I don’t think it is appropriate for men of your age to appear like that for dinner.”
Tobias shrugged. “I guess I wanted to be able to rant and insult everyone in a language they wouldn’t understand. I couldn’t find anything to teach me Elvin or Dwarven and I liked this language, so I choose it. Instead of insulting others, I now use it to name those closest to me.”
The mother smiled at her Raven’s mate. She understood his silence. Her Raven would be the same as his mate if her consort were here and not she. The young man impressed her.
“As I was saying, the last sweet is the smallest and was named by Sev, who was unfortunately – for him – the unlucky man to discover its effect. The name is actually what he said when it happened. Neville? Are you ready?”
Neville grinned maliciously as he turned and made his way to the seventh floor. He couldn’t wait to see what Luna did to the red-headed twit next.
Voldemort stopped dancing and released his victim, I mean dance partner. “Yes he did! Isn’t it amazing? I wouldn’t be surprised if the boy proposes soon!”
“After we leave here, we will go to the rooms you will be staying in until your schooling starts again. We will be transporting you to the train, so you have nothing to worry about, so if someone will take their things, that will be appreciated. You will have time to organise the rooms to your liking before you are taken to the Garden. There you will speak to The Mother and Father. Once that is complete, you will be led to the Sacred Lake where you will bath. Then you are given a light meal of the Mother’s choosing. Then meditation time, then it will be time for you to consummate your relationship.”
Remus grinned and left. Tobias put his book to one side and stretched. Standing and muttering to himself, he kissed Draco on the cheek and left, leaving behind a room of amused men.
With a nod, Amelia turned to the two people in question. “Do either of you disagree with the marriage contract?”
“I expect at least one and a half months per room. If it takes longer that is no problem, but I will be worried if it takes less time,” Harry turned thoughtful. “I hadn’t really thought of the hallways, but yes, I would like for you to do them as well, but maybe wait until all the rooms on that level have been done before doing the hallways. Kitten will be able to reveal any secret rooms or areas that need to be done, even though she may not be aware for much of it.”
Harry laughed bitterly. “I’m too young to know? I’m the one who has to off the bastard, and I’m too young to know what little information of him you actually have?” No one noticed the smirks on Severus and Remus’ faces at the fact that Harry had just sounded like a Malfoy.
Various voices from students in Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin made sounds of agreement at the statement.
The Death Eaters were silent as they watched the head daises. Their Lord had a sleeping teen on his lap and his fingers were running through the teen’s raven hair. They watched in silence as the teen was gently woken and place onto the chair beside their Lord. They sneered in disgust as their Lord’s heir said something with a pout and tear filled eyes.
Harry nodded without hesitation. “It is dikos mou lykos. I need some stability in my life, and Pateras is the most constant thing in my past, so it stands to reason that he will be my stability now I’ve lost Siri.” Harry smiled at Voldemort. “Just keep me away from Wormtail and Bellatrix. I owe them both a death sentence. Bella for killing Siri and talking to me as if I had her intelligence,” his eyes glazed over as he remembered something. “But I do have her to thank for me learning Cruciatus, so maybe I can reduce her sentence to showing her how proficient I am at it now.”
Draco stretched, almost purring in delight as his muscles stretched. Silently he followed the Father to the centre of the garden, where he found a large Willow tree that was fully encased in magic of the most pure he’d ever seen. The Father stopped and turned to face him.
Tobias smiled sleepily as Draco carried him to their bedroom. They’d had a wonderful bath with a very tender love session half-way through, which Tobias knew he’d have trouble forgetting. He jumped slightly when Draco placed him on the bed.
To Ron’s horror, the bridge he was tied to started to crumble. Slowly at first then in larger quantities and in faster time as the verse was repeated another two more times. Soon, he was screaming as he fell into the ravine, hitting the jagged sides hard enough to bruise. He gulped deeply when the stranger’s strong tenor took over the song.
“I love you Draco Lucien Malfoy. You are now and always will be metalleio kardia, metalleio psychi – mine heart, mine soul. We are bound by magical bonds to spend the rest of our lives together. Tonight, I wish for it to be official. Would you, Draco Lucien Malfoy, do me the honour of becoming my fiancé on this night? Will you be the death to my darkness?”
Draco lit a fire in the corner and placed what looked to be two pokers into it. “You should have long enough to get the man who is dealing with her punishment here and talk to him about the terms. He can take her after the application.”
birthday to a student two years older than her who wants nothing to do with either her or the child.”
Before he could try again, firm but gentle hands attacked the knotted muscles under his skin. He moaned softly in relief as the muscles relaxed under the strong fingers. After several moments, he hissed as his shoulder blades cracked with the release of tension. The hands stopped and Neville turned to face the person, only to find his Grandmother smiling down at him.
“Alright everyone! Who has what left to complete?”
Chapter 13
The morning of the start of the investigation found one Hermione Granger curled up in her bed, hiding from the other girls in her dormitory. The news that she had been branded had spread like wildfire through the school and not a single person wanted to be seen with her. If she was to be honest with herself, it wasn’t the being alone that bothered her – after all, twelve of her seventeen years alive she has been alone. No, it wasn’t being alone that bother her at all; it was the fact that the pure-bloods had been correct. As a muggleborn she had no rights. Everyone treated her as if she had leprosy – all because of something that had been forced onto her.
The Hall was completely silent as the inhabitants struggled to comprehend everything that had occurred in the past twenty-four hours. First the Headmaster had been denied access to areas where there were students. Next the school nurse had been transported to St Mungos in hysterics when her examination discovered several obliviates, a tampered vow and a suspicious cocktail of potions in her system. Third and fourth was the truth behind why there was no longer a Golden Trio and why the boy-who-lived turned his back on the Headmaster.
“Oh hush, all of you and let the young ones speak. Yes, Helga, they are cute and if I’m not incorrect they are also highly amused. Now hush.” The elegant lady turned to face the group. Tobias bowed to the four founders.
Suddenly he stopped, his pupils dilating until they were pin-spots. Harry growled in his throat as his phoenix re-appeared, a doe gripped in his claws. As the phoenix dropped her to the ground, Harry transformed until a pure white wolf with golden-green eyes stood in his place. For a moment time stood still – then the doe caught the scent of wolf and she ran with Harry right behind her. Within minutes, Harry’s fangs were around her throat and those closest to him had their robes spattered with blood. Harry growled with pleasure as the taste hit his tongue, his face drenched in her life’s blood.
The Pack smiled as the couple sat and Tobias curled into Draco’s side. It was the most relaxed they had seem the both of them in a long, long time. Everyone was half asleep when a black flame appeared, dropping a letter on Tobias’ lap. All The Pack waited while he read it.
“Question: what is a bezoar and where would one be found? Answer: It is a market found in India … what does this have to do with potions?” He stopped to wipe the tears from his eyes, watching his father’s shoulders shake with suppressed laughter. “It gets better, Pateras.”
Everyone had eaten at supper while they watched Harry slowly eat a small bowl of noodles in broth, then a small piece of grilled fish with a small side salad.  He had refused all liquid bar water and pumpkin juice, much to the amusement of all around him.  Moving to the sitting room, Severus once more offered him a glass of alcohol – a good scotch this time, and once more he refused.
In some odd way, he half hoped that his daughters and the Weasley twins agreed to wed – or at least court in an attempt to see if they were compatible.
“That was one of the effects of The Pack mark, I’m sorry to say. We have a long weekend ahead of us and tonight we will be binding The Pack together as such. Tomorrow night we are taking our rightful places within Pateras’ group. There will be threats, there will be curses and there will be death – none of it for me and mine, I can assure you.”
“Sev? What’s the matter?” he asked sleepily.
“Gios? What was that potion you sent me and why did it affect me the way it did?”
Severus raised his nose snobbishly. “Liver is for peasants. You look like a slab of beef to me.”
“How you have a job is beyond me,” the older red-headed twin said. “I will say this once and once only … you DO NOT speak to either of us in the way you just did. Going by your lack of knowledge you are either a muggleborn, half-blood with no experience in the magical word or a pure-blood with sub-par intelligence, put mediocre study towards your devotion to your chosen field or a mix of the lot of them.”

Not that I don’t think he couldn’t have gotten it, but at that stage in his year, it was surprising he even managed to do as well as he did. I saw what he really got, and it was a high Acceptable.
