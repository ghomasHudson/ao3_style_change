‘Ron, we’ve talked about this before Harry went and testified for him.’ Hermione started. ‘I know how much he hurt me, but
‘I suppose, but now it’s Friday and we have to finish this house before we get to go home and then we’ll have to write our reports on the weekend. Now
‘That sounds good.’ Harry looked down at his clothes. ‘Are you going to make me change?’ He grinned as Draco flinched. Since Draco had taken Harry to get “proper, adult clothes” he had really toned it down on the constant complaints about Harry’s fashion sense. He would still comment when Harry made what was, according to him, bad combinations, but his tone was more gentle. Like he was actually trying to
‘-he is just the most frustratingly amazing person ever, how does he even do that? How does he manage to make me want to strangle him and just, fucking, be around him all the time?’
As thirty minutes stretched into an hour, Harry got worried. An hour was too long, where was he? What was happening? Harry had to grip his desk until his knuckled went white to stop himself from getting up and marching into Robards office. Draco was
‘Of course not, let’s go.’ Harry grinned at him. He didn’t mention that he would have gone right to the Manor with him if Draco wanted to go there. He was
‘Show you what? These essays? They’re pretty terrible to be honest. Even you could pick out all of the mistakes, easily.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
‘I- Yes. I do. I have thought about it a lot since Potter suggested it and, well, I would like to help. I know how much damage has been done by people-‘
‘We don’t know how long this will take, Harry and I’ll be under more scrutiny than he was.’ Harry could feel his heart squeeze at the thought of Draco going undercover for a
‘Come on, I’m hungry.’ Harry started walking again. He couldn’t stop himself from smiling. He was just… happy. It was his day off, he’d gotten his first tattoo, Draco was here, the sun was out. It was a good day.
‘Yes and yours is Lucius.’ Harry rolled his eyes. ‘That’s not the point. The point is, I think I would be cool.’
. Maybe they just needed his expertise on a case. If this was about some complicated potion, Harry would be useless, it would be logical to leave him in the office to do something productive while Draco did his thing.
‘Thanks.’ Harry just said instead. That was vague enough, right? Harry forced himself to sit down after he’d poured himself a cuppa. He had no idea how long this might take, hell he didn’t even technically know if they were even bringing him back here.
‘What in the actual bloody fuck is going on with you Harry?’ He hissed as they got to the corner. Several of the others looked over at them funnily.
‘And it’s breaking free, right? Your dragon?’ Draco seemed to like it that Harry called it “his dragon”.
They waited as mother and daughter both sobbed and spoke in half-sentences for a few minutes. eventually the mother wiped her cheeks and picked up her daughter, setting her on her hip as she got up from where she’d been kneeling on the ground.
‘Yeah, I was awake anyways, figured I’d come see if there was anything I could do.’ Amelia smiled knowingly.
It was like every other time apart from Draco holding his hand now when he flinched at the sting of the magic at the bottom of his spine. Missy didn’t comment, but she did grin at him and wink before they headed out.
‘She didn’t feel comfortable just walking into the Auror’s offices and also, she is technically still on house arrest, so.’ Malfoy said. He did actually shift away from Harry, but only to turn so he could face him, leaning one elbow on the back of the booth. Harry shifted around to go sit in a similar position, it was much more comfortable than twisting his neck. Harry had already undone the top few buttons of his shirt, but he started working on his sleeves now. It was warm in this place. He rolled them up to his elbows.
‘Yes, yes, Kreacher can heal Master Harry’s bleeding friend before he gets blood on the upholstery.’ Kreacher nodded, his big ears flopping back and forth.
‘-so, I think that they should let you make the robes green. You’d look so good in green, and what does it really matter?’ Amelia said with a high, tinkling little laugh. For some reason it made Harry’s shoulders go tight.
‘So, uh, I didn’t see your mother at the graduating ceremony.’ Harry said, shifting in his seat a little. Now that there was so much space in the booth it felt a little weird to be sitting so close to Malfoy, but putting space between them now also felt weird. So Harry just stuck to wiggling his leg and turning his beer glass between his hands.
Harry was dragging Draco to dinner with Ron and Hermione. If they were going to let Draco’s friends know, they were also letting Harry’s friends know, but not until they had that conversation about the whole Auror thing.
‘You were poisoned.’ He could hear that Draco’s jaw was clenched, even if he couldn’t really see him. ‘The stuff the suspect threw at you was a poison, it got in your system. You can’t move your arms because they had to restrain you. You were fighting the Healers, screaming bloody murder and throwing punches. They’re investigating what exactly was in the poison now.’
The normally calm and kind Auror looked positively furious and send a nasty Stunner over her cover in the general direction of an enemy. Ron’s eyes were closed and Harry’s heart stuttered until he saw Ron’s chest rise on an inhale.
Amelia Frost who was very capable. When you first met her, you’d think she was too sweet to be an Auror, but Harry had seen her in practice interrogations and she could be vicious. She’d been a Hufflepuff back in Hogwarts and as Harry had learned pretty quickly, badgers were
), it had been at Hogwarts where there was the Yule Ball or Hogsmeade weekends. With Ginny it had just kind of… happened. Ginny hadn’t expected much and there had been
‘Is that so, mister Malfoy?’ Minister Shacklebolt asked. Harry could feel Ron’s tension next to him. Oh Merlin, Harry had really wormed himself into a tight corner now.
All that hatred and war were good for was destroying lives and Harry had seen enough of that for a lifetime. He just wanted to put it behind him.
Harry knew his silence was a big red flag. He just couldn’t let himself bite out the first thing in his head which was a resounding “
‘Well, you two are like, together, right?’ She shifted her feet, but there was a sparkle in her eyes that made Harry feel like she was enjoying this now. She definitely also had a little bit of a Slytherin vibe.
‘They didn’t want to let him do the test?’ She asked, Harry could hear her social justice tone, but Ron clearly didn’t.
Draco looked like he was debating if he was going to try and hug another pillow. He’d collected about five of the small pillows that had been on Harry’s couch and was now cuddling them. His long, slim arms were wrapped around them, he had lost his fancy silky shirt at some point, claiming Harry’s apartment was like a furnace and he’d been left in his white undershirt. Harry was occasionally distracted by the dusting of almost silvery hairs on his arms.
that he realized Draco had been gone for a while. He checked the clock. He’d been gone for thirty minutes, nothing too crazy for a meeting or briefing, but too long for a simple conversation.
He drank his tea, but he didn’t taste any of it. He started jiggling his leg somewhere around his second sip. Amelia, to her credit, didn’t say anything about it. Harry cast his fourth wordless, wandless Tempus. He was really restraining himself. He’d been there for an hour. It was fine, everything was fine.
‘I wanted to thank you for what you did for my friends, since some of them are too proud to say it themselves.’ Behind her Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘I hope you know that we appreciate you trying to… help out Slytherin’s reputation out a little. It’s truly a shame you never ended up with us,’ she grinned. ‘it could have been very interesting.’ Harry wasn’t sure what to say to that, so he just went with:
‘It’s a talent?’ Harry offered and Malfoy looked at him, horrified. ‘Look, Minister, in your own words, I am an expert in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Malfoy is an expert in the Dark Arts. That could be very valuable, no? Or is there anyone else in the department who could give you the information he could?’ Harry asked innocently. Several mouths dropped open and Shacklebolt’s eyes narrowed.
years old and forced into the service of a madman. I believe that when it came down to it, Draco Malfoy did his best not to choose any side. Now while some might argue that is just as bad, there’s also such a thing as self-preservation. I personally don’t know much about it, I’ve been told that is my Gryffindor idiocy,’ there were a few soft laughs in the room. ‘but I can’t blame someone for trying to save themselves and their family. I have lost people that I cared about and I would have done some extreme things to save them if I could have.’
‘Probably not. We couldn’t risk being seen together.’ Draco said softly. ‘It would only put me in danger.’
Eventually Draco had gotten fed up and he’d just moved all of Harry’s stuff into his room. It meant a longer walk for Harry from his classroom to their room, but he was willing to deal with that. He scratched absentmindedly at his chest as he headed for the peace and quiet of their rooms near the dungeons.
am allowed to decide whether I want to hold that against him or not. I am tired, I don’t want to spend energy on holding grudges, I have better things to do.’
‘There’s two things we need to talk about mate.’ Ron said. He’d already emptied his plate and picked it up. He headed to the kitchen. ‘Eat the rest of that, we’ll be right back.’
‘Not necessarily.’ Cryptic, but also not a hard no. ‘I’ll head to the Ministry. Please sit down and drink something.’ Harry nodded, but he also knew he probably wouldn’t, not until he knew if Ron would be okay. Draco gave him a look like he knew exactly what Harry was thinking, but he did leave.
So yes, Gaulding gave Draco and Ron something to bond over, their shared hatred for the guy trying to steal their best friend/partner. Also, Ron was starting to grin more as he bickered back and forth with Draco. They were polar opposites in so many ways, but they seemed to share a love for snarking at each other and to be honest, Harry was just really glad neither of them had tried to hex the other at any point.
‘Right, and it had nothing to do with the fact that they’re most likely bringing Malfoy back with them?’
‘Harry.’ There he went again, saying his name like that while looking at him like that. Why was this making Harry feel so unsettled?
‘It’s pretty.’ He traced a finger along the green, gold scales of the snake. As it slithered around his wrist a little further, it made its scales shimmer and shine. He looked up at the student. She looked unimpressed.
her own place right now, he also knew Molly was almost desperately holding on to her daughter, her last child living at home. With Bill travelling all over the world for his curse-breaking job, Charlie in Romania, Percy practically sleeping at the Ministry these days, George burying himself in the joke shop and Ron making long hours as an Auror, Ginny was the only one she could still keep close beyond the mandatory monthly Sunday dinner. Ginny was humouring her, for now, but sooner or later she’d want out.
and it was wonderful. Harry flexed his hands and rolled his shoulders. He turned so he could properly see Draco. He looked very blank, which meant he was probably upset. ‘Was it bad?’ Draco rolled his eyes.
laughed when he’d been prancing around the Auror offices with blue hair wondering why everyone was snickering behind his back. He hadn’t gently pointed one particular Junior Auror in the direction of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. He hadn’t, because he was an
‘Missed my sparkling personality, didn’t you, Potter?’ Draco asked with a grin but Harry didn’t laugh. He didn’t see the humour. Draco noticed pretty quickly. ‘Okay.’ He said drawing the word out.
‘If you make me a ginger I will hex you.’ Malfoy decided on and when Harry laughed he swore he saw the corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirk up.
‘I have it together.’ He snapped back before forcing himself to take a deep breath. ‘Look, both of us are much too recognizable, we need to do something about that.’
5 experienced Aurors were supposed to come give them a talk about protecting yourself in combat and how to know when your foe was weakest.
Harry worked on his paperwork for a while. It was perfectly boring as usual. It wasn’t until he finished his report and dropped it in his outbox where it disappeared with a soft
‘That’s gross, Potter.’ It was delivered in Malfoy’s usual haughty tone. ‘Just because you could have been a Slytherin, doesn’t mean I won’t know when you’re trying to manipulate me.’
Everything finally went into focus and Harry just had time to register two pale hands pulling away from him with familiar long, slim fingers. Draco.
Things were not as simple as Harry hoped they would be once they became Junior Aurors. They kept most of the pairings they’d had before, keeping Harry paired with Draco. Robards may have suggested that was so that Harry could “keep an eye on” Draco. It was stupid. How many more times would the guy have to prove himself before they believed he was not a danger to anyone except the bad guys?
‘Thank you Kreacher.’ He made it as clear of a dismissal as he could. Kreacher disappeared with a nod.
Ron was still looking at him like his universe had just been tilted slightly to the left and he hadn’t quite adjusted yet. Hermione had sat back down and looked… well, like she wanted to shake Ron a little. Ginny looked bored, but then again, she’d had her revelation months ago, no wait, years at this point. Shite he’d been really damn blind hadn’t he? Had it really taken seeing Draco shirtless and tattooed and
‘Sod off, Malfoy.’ Harry said, but it lacked any heat. Huh. Banter. ‘I’m serious though, this is impressive. What are you going to do with these?’ He waved the parchment at Malfoy. His face sobered immediately. His smirk disappeared and his face went tight. He shrugged, a sharp little gesture. Every little bit that he had relaxed was gone now.
With the quiet moments the paperwork was so tedious and boring it made Harry go cross-eyed. His focus would drift and drift and drift until he had been staring at the same page for ten minutes and hadn’t registered a single thing that was written on it.
He remembered everything, which was both good and mildly horrifying, considering that he’d said some
Draco was… not quite the same. The differences were subtle and those who didn’t know him like Harry did and didn’t spend as much time with him as Harry did, probably wouldn’t even notice, but Harry
‘I missed you too.’ Draco said, before clearing his throat. ‘I should go turn your couch into a bed. Goodnight, Harry.’ Draco was already disappearing down the hall when Harry managed to get his voice to work.
Harry woke up feeling like Death and like something had died in his mouth. He felt around on his bedside table for his glasses.
.’ Harry ordered setting his hand on Draco’s knee. Draco glared at him. Kreacher appeared next to him with a bowl of water and a few towels.
‘I don’t know.’ Harry shrugged. ‘I bet Hermione has a theory. Wanna grab some takeaway and ask her?’
what my problem is?’ Draco whirled around, coat clenched in his fist. ‘That’s rich coming from Harry “I’m fine” Potter.’ Before Harry even had time to process what he was saying he was already out of the room and he heard the front door slam.
‘Do you want a countdown? Should I put on some music? Or are you just going to show me now? I’ve had to wait a day longer, I get to see first.’ Harry decided. Draco didn’t seem to want to argue. He started unbuttoning the pale blue shirt (a gift from Harry) and Harry just leant against the back of the chair to enjoy the view.
‘That’s sweet. Already bickering again.’ Harry turned to find Amelia leaning against the wall just outside of the breakroom. ‘Mind if I welcome him back too?’ She smirked at Harry. He rolled his eyes and stepped aside. Amelia gave Draco a quick hug. ‘Welcome back.’
The Atrium was bustling as usual, but Harry didn’t stop to look around. He just hurried towards the elevators, keeping his pace brisk and his eyes forward, daring anyone to try and stop him. He headed down to where the Wizengamot was.
‘Would she be in danger?’ Harry asked as he fumbled with the golden button, trying to fasten his coat properly.
‘Oh, sorry. If I’d known you actually hadn’t realized I would have been more sensitive about it.’ Ginny said with an apologetic look. Harry raised his eyebrows at her.
‘I know.’ Harry assured him. ‘Go.’ He said just as a Bombarda hit their cover and it shook dangerously. Draco bit out the command for the Portkey to take him to St Mungo’s. It was almost like those steely grey eyes stayed behind a little longer just to stare at him threateningly.
‘Would you just please be a little more careful?’ He sounded so earnest for a second. Too bad he ruined it by following it up with: ‘The St Mungo’s hospital gowns are not a good look on you.’
Malfoy had always looked pointy. Pointy nose, sharp chin, sharp jaw, sharp cheekbones, thin lips. Pale complexion. Sharp, pointy words in that stupidly sharp and posh voice. Harry had spent enough time staring at him (trying to figure out what he was up to, obviously) to know this, but when he’d showed up to the same hall as Harry for his Charms NEWT, Harry had noticed immediately that he looked worse than the last time Harry had seen him. Which was almost impressive considering the last time Harry had seen him he’d just been in a holding cell in the Ministry for over a month awaiting his trail.
He trapped his one hand under his leg and tangled the other back into his own hair so his treacherous fingers wouldn’t reach out and do it. They’d been doing so well in the friends department, the last thing Harry needed to do was something stupid while he was feeling the hum of the beers.
I have to admit I am beyond nervous to post this. Drarry feels very much out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to try something new, so here I go.
‘I can pay attention to details.’ Harry argued. ‘Potions is just tedious and some of the instructions are far too specific.’
He was beyond happy that Ron and Amelia knew about the plan. Proudfoot, Dawlish, Robards, Ron, Amelia and Harry were the only ones who knew within the department. Proudfoot and Dawlish because it was their case, Robards because he was the Head Auror, Harry because he was Draco’s partner and Ron and Amelia because she’d come up with the idea initially.
‘Well, I know this might surprise you, but he was a good father. He didn’t treat me badly and I never felt pressured, not until the Dark Lord came back.’ Draco said. ‘He was never the warmest, but I know he loved me. He loved me and he loved my mother and I think he didn’t ever feel like he had much of a choice either.’
They ditched their shoes and bags in the hall. Hermione appeared in the living room the second she heard their voices.
‘Okay first of all, keep your voice down. Second, we’ve been over this okay. You want to hold on to Hogwarts rivalries, you’re allowed to do that, but I don’t want to anymore. I want to try and get along with him because for Merlin’s sake Ron, haven’t we fought enough?’ Harry said in a low tone.
‘You have to be a Slytherin here Malfoy, you want to be there, so be there.’ Harry said as he shrugged his coat on.
And it was a good lunch. Draco insisted on paying and Harry only argued a little. He’d visited his vault the other day (the goblins still didn’t like him much after the whole “destroying their building while escaping on a dragon” thing) and he pretty much had more money than he really knew what to do with. Especially because anything that the Ministry had taken from Sirius had been returned and given to Harry, since he’d been falsely convicted.
‘I will need to take down the wards, you should not try to go through them they would hurt you.’ Draco said firmly.
Harry poured them both a cup of coffee and they settled at the kitchen table. The tension hadn’t quite left Draco yet, but it was a little better. Harry ducked out to get dressed quickly, opting for his oldest pair of jeans and a well-worn t-shirt. They mostly worked in silence for a while, both starting on a different case. Draco was working on the Death Eater safe house and Harry was working on their paperwork for the kidnapping case. They only asked each other questions occasionally.
.’ Draco snorted out a laugh, something Harry had never once heard him do when he was sober. He kind of liked drunk Draco. He liked sober Draco, of course, but drunk Draco was loose in a way his sober counterpart never was.
‘Mate! Wasn’t that super weird?’ Ron immediately asked. ‘It was just an interrogation, how is that supposed to tell them if we’ll be good Aurors or not?’
‘Oh um, that bad?’ Harry just gave him a curt nod and he flinched a little, but he did move further into the house. Dawlish came down the stairs, looking stoic.
‘Are you okay?’ Draco asked and Harry turned to face him. He looked slightly better, still tired and weary, but less nauseous.
‘Are you really going to risk someone else taking the credit for this. Come on.’ Harry said, motioning for Draco to move. ‘We can tell them once we get there, they’ll have to let us help. Plus, taking these wards down would be easier for you, right?’
Harry pushed himself to his feet, slowly. He didn’t want to give the impression that he was going to launch himself at her. He wouldn’t. Just like Malfoy, she had just been a kid when the whole thing went down. Somehow it was harder to remind himself of that with her.
‘Hello, sorry. I was awake when I got Dawlish’s message. I figured I’d drop by.’ He made that sound far more casual than the whole affair had been. He also barely looked at Proudfoot, his eyes had already zeroed in on Draco, who was walking over to them, next to Dawlish. They’d been talking like old friends, comfortable.
Young immediately agreed that Harry and Draco should go back to being partners. It might partially have been because Robards himself was in need of a new partner. She saw an opportunity and grabbed it with both hands. Draco had been the one to suggest that she could be Robards’ partner. Later, he’d grinned at Harry and told him Young was a former Slytherin, so that he’d been sure that would work. Harry had rolled his eyes to hide his pleased grin.
‘I’ll get Draco to take Ron.’ He assured her. He did not feel safe letting her take Ron with the state he was in. She seemed to agree, well, with some of it.
‘Are you saying I should bring Malfoy to one of your games for an as-of-yet undetermined pro-Quidditch team?’ Harry asked, also sliding himself from the booth.
Luckily, the day was over now and he knew Draco had to be finished as well. So he headed to their rooms.
‘You are free to go, mister Malfoy.’ Minister Shacklebolt said. ‘You have been given a second chance, do not waste it.’
‘Drink.’ He ordered. Harry rolled his eyes, but did as he was told. The cold water was admittedly very nice and it actually made his mind feel a little clearer. When he’d downed the glass, Malfoy took it and replaced it with a big mug of tea that smelled like… well, kind of like a warm hug.
‘Oh yes, very interesting.’ He wasn’t quite sure what was going on exactly. So he just sort of smiled and said:
‘I think it’s sweet, the two of you.’ Harry thought about correcting her, but was it really worth it at this point? Was Harry not trying to convince himself not to throw himself into Draco’s arms the second he saw him again?
‘I was just doing the right thing. I meant what I said in there.’ She studied him for a few more seconds before a thin little smile appeared on her face. It made her look years younger.
‘Fine, suit yourself.’ Harry shrugged as he headed into the communal lounge. The coffee there was terrible, but there was something about that that felt comforting. Plus, coffee was half the reason Harry managed to stay awake when he wasn’t running on adrenaline.
Behind him stood Pansy Parkinson. The one who had tried to convince the students at Hogwarts to hand Harry over to Voldemort. She looked as put together as she always had at Hogwarts, but Harry could see the tension in her shoulders and the nervous flicker of her eyes.
‘Merlin knows why.’ Draco groaned as he turned the corner. Harry walked at a brisk pace and that’s probably why it took him a second to realize Draco had stopped walking. They’d been moving past a tall hedge and Harry hadn’t noticed anything, but Draco clearly had.
‘No, that’s fine.’ Harry said, unable to stop himself from keeping her in his sightlines as she herded Draco towards a different door than the one they’d come in through. Harry sighed. The room was very nice, very Malfoy, very expensive. All dark wood and silver and green accents. A lot of thought had probably been put into the interior and Harry was most certainly not fancy enough to understand the intricacies of it.
‘Well of course you can.’ Ginny pushed herself out of the booth. ‘You could even buy a ticket for you
‘Malfoy is not that bad.’ Defending Draco was like second nature to him by now. ‘He’s really changed.’ Ginny hummed.
The character and aptitude tests felt a little bit like an interrogation. They circled back to the same questions several times and put more and more pressure on him, trying to get him to admit he was lying or holding something back. Harry could feel his temper flare, but he bit his tongue as he knew that was exactly what they wanted. He managed to be only mildly sarcastic and he managed not to laugh at some of their more stupid questions. When he stepped out into the sunshine (him and Ron had agreed to go grab some dinner before heading home), he found himself squinting. It wasn’t sunny very often in London and Harry was glad he’d taken off his robes before he stepped out, because the sun actually had some warmth to it.
‘I will see you in seven days.’ Harry nodded sharply before hurrying out of the house, away from the smell and the blood and the death. Draco was waiting for him at the door.
The fifty or so witches and wizards dressed in plumb coloured robes were intimidating Harry and he wasn’t even in the chair. He couldn’t imagine what that felt like. The High Wizard, Kingsley Shacklebolt (who also happened to be the Minister of Magic), stopped in the middle of a sentence and looked over at Harry with raised eyebrows.
a Black, maybe? Harry really wasn’t sure how pureblood stuff like that worked). Harry had given the landlord his notice on his apartment a while ago and he’d continued to clean and revamp the old Black house. When he’d first graduated, being in the house had been too painful, everything had been too fresh, but he felt calmer now and the house made him feel closer to people that had been important to him.
‘Draco might think your complete lack of care about your appearance is endearing, but unless you’re planning on spending the rest of your life with Draco, you might want to make an effort. How else are you going to convince a girl to go on a date with you?’
When nine months had passed and Harry looked in the mirror after dragging himself out of bed, he barely recognized himself. The dark circles under his eyes had grown to epic proportions, his face had definitely gotten slimmer because he hadn’t been eating enough. He knew that if he took off his shirt he’d be able to count his ribs. He wasn’t dressing in his fancy clothes anymore because they just reminded him of Malfoy and he just really couldn’t be bothered.
‘I’ll join you guys later, okay? I want to see if I can find some of the others from our year.’ Harry said, giving them a reassuring smile. Hermione looked like she didn’t believe him, but that was okay, she wouldn’t call him out on it. Hermione (thankfully) subscribed to the idea that Harry needed to work through things differently than she did, she worried about him, clearly, but she did also trust him. To a certain extend at least.
Sure enough, he found Narcissa Malfoy just outside of the doors, two Aurors flanking her, but with her arms wrapped firmly around her son. He was as tall as she was at this point, but he still managed to hook his chin over her shoulder and look approximately twelve.
Harry paused near Malfoy’s chair. No one had told him to go straight back to his seat and it wasn’t like Malfoy could do anything even if he tried. Malfoy was still studiously looking at the floor. He seemed to be using the tactic “if I ignore him he might go away”, Harry personally loved that tactic. It wasn’t going to work though.
figured that out?”? What are you on about Ginny?’ Ron asked, his horrified tone settled a pit in the bottom of Harry’s stomach. Ginny rolled her eyes at her brother.
‘What do you know? Is it bad? Is he okay?’ She pushed herself back, frantically trying to push her hair back behind her ear where it had sprung free from her tight bun.
They got promoted a month after they solved the case of the missing little girl. Robards grumbled about it, but Harry didn’t listen. They were the first of the Junior Aurors (apart from Baez) to be promoted to fully fledged Aurors and Harry was proud of it.
to finally drive home that maybe his feelings towards Draco weren’t entirely just friendly? Apparently.
‘I think it went good, but it was pretty weird honestly.’ Ron shrugged as he put the takeaway bags on the coffee table. Harry headed into the kitchen to grab some plates and cutlery. He could already hear Hermione asking a million and one questions about what exactly the assessors had asked them and if he thought he’d be accepted to the training programme.
Malfoy’s worries had not been unfounded. The second Malfoy had walked into the little office to sign up for the tests, the head Auror, Robards, drew his wand. Harry was so glad he’d gotten there early. Malfoy, to his credit, froze immediately.
for research than Harry did, he was more methodical. Harry would argue he had better instincts than Draco did, but for what they were doing now? Draco was a better fit.
‘Woah, woah, wait what?’ Harry asked, suddenly just as confused as Ron looked. Ginny looked at him like she wasn’t quite sure if he was serious. He totally was.
. Draco’s eyes widened to a comical size and Harry motioned for him to put the girl down. He quickly did and she sprinted towards her mum as fast as her little legs could carry her. They followed her at a more subdued pace.
‘Okay, I can disguise you and you can do me.’ Malfoy was making a valiant effort not to snap at Harry again, judging by the colour high on his cheeks. He cleared his throat.
a tight fit. Still, there was something in the way that she was looking at him that made something uncomfortable bloom in Harry’s stomach. He focussed on not dropping the beers and setting them down gently. Ginny had pulled up a chair and Ron allowed Harry to slink past him back to his old seat.
‘I’ll miss you too.’ The words were as earnest as anything that came out of Draco’s mouth. Harry pushed himself off his desk and stepped closer to Draco. He didn’t miss the way his breath hitched, but he ignored it.
smiled at anyone else, but he smiled at Harry all the time. He would never have gone out of his way to get an owl for Ron for a
‘Well yes, I wanted to talk to you about Mirella, but instead I found Harry Potter.’ She said with a tilt to her head that Draco seemed to read like a question.
‘No, but, seeing yours, I might want one.’ Harry’s hand automatically reached up to try and flatten his fringe. ‘I kind of like the idea of
‘Passed all of them. Four O’s and two E’s.’ He said holding the parchment out to her. She handed hers back to him in a trade. Sure enough, Hermione got O’s in Charms, DADA, Herbology, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes
‘Awesome. Congrats Ron.’ Harry said as Hermione threw herself at Ron with an excited squeal. Harry turned to Neville when Hermione kissed Ron on the mouth, that was not something he needed to see. ‘What about you Neville? You got an O for Herbology, right?’
. He usually did, but there was something about the gold with Malfoy’s skin colour that made him look silver.
‘Why the hell didn’t you take Weasley with your Portkey?’ Draco snapped, sending a Bombarda over their cover. Harry glared at him.
He knew getting Narcissa Malfoy off the hook completely probably wouldn’t work like it did with Malfoy junior. Unlike her son, she had not been a minor and so she didn’t have that going for her, but he was fairly certain that he could keep her out of Azkaban. He was so glad to be proven right.
‘Oh shite, I didn’t even think about it.’ Draco hurried back towards Harry. ‘I’m so sorry, Harry. The inside is completely redone, I promise.’ Harry swallowed thickly.
‘I don’t think Robards would agree.’ Malfoy said, his voice was smooth as always, but there might have been something uncomfortable under it. Or maybe Harry was imagining it.
‘And they want you on it because you’re our resident potions expert.’ Harry sighed but flopped down in his chair and flipped the file open. Harry hated the potions cases. ‘This is the one downside of working with you.’
‘I know, but Hermione did some research and she said it’s possible for it to switch back if the wand is returned to the original owner. So,’ Harry pushed the wand a little closer. ‘take it. I have no use for it anyways.’
‘Mister Potter, we have to take Mrs Malfoy to the Manor now.’ One of the Aurors said. Harry was pretty sure that was Robyan.
.’ He took a deep breath before continuing. ‘We’re even on that and if those are the things you want, I will do it.’
‘If you’re going to kill him, let me know. I’ll be your alibi.’ Young said after she’d closed the door. ‘Or if you need help, I’ll help, we can be each other’s alibi.’
‘I’m sorry mister Potter, the trail has already started and you are not on the registered list of witnesses for the prosecution.’ The Auror said. Harry smiled.
So he got paw prints walking up his right side for Sirius and the Whomping Willow that would actually change seasons on his right shoulder blade for Remus. He got them both in one sitting and on the last day of his break. It just felt right to have them with him as well. They’d been so important to him growing up, both in their own ways.
‘Well, I would assume the Aurors are professionals and if he qualifies, would put themselves past that, but otherwise,
‘I’s will do that.’ Kreacher disappeared. Draco was struggling to get his shirt off while trying not to pull on the apparent wound in his side. It looked like some kind of slash, it was bleeding quite a lot. Harry got tired of watching him struggle pretty quickly.
‘It’s tea, Potter. You look like death, drink it.’ Malfoy sat down in the seat next to Harry, smiling sharply at Ron as he made an annoyed noise before worming his way between two other seats to get to the one on Harry’s other side.
‘They’re just-‘ Draco made an annoyed face. ‘They hide your eyes.’ Harry tilted his head in confusion. ‘Your eyes are actually very nice and the glasses make them harder to see.’
The nights were the worst. After that last case he only seemed to be capable of sleeping in short stretches of about an hour, maybe two. Hence the sleeping, eating, sleeping some more. There wasn’t even a specific nightmare or anything. His dreams were just a whirlwind of death and destruction and the people closest to him getting hurt. Sirius was in his dreams a lot, so were Ron and Hermione, Ginny and Neville and Draco. Oh Merlin the ones with Draco were some of the
‘It was, but the Wizengamot extended it by another six months.’ Malfoy said with clear distain in his voice. ‘Apparently they’re not convinced she’d been fully “reformed” even though she hasn’t put a toe out of line since she was put on house arrest.’ Harry frowned.
The two assessors called the first Auror-hopeful inside and Ron immediately grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him to a corner slightly away from everyone else.
‘Yes. These safehouses often have curses all over them.’ Malfoy was using his long legs to gain a speed advantage over Harry so he had to jog several paces to keep up with him. Harry didn’t complain like he usually would.
‘Are you agreeing with Malfoy?’ Harry asked, because he knew that was a sure-fire way to get Ron to do a 180. Ron narrowed his eyes, like he knew exactly what Harry was doing.
‘Yes, I’ll get you some of the leftover pasta. Sit down, Harry.’ Harry flopped down in the nearest chair. It had been years, but he still wasn’t inclined to ignore something Hermione told him to do.
‘Yeah.’ He nodded. ‘From my hip to about my belly button.’ She pulled on some very Muggle looking rubber gloves and clapped her hands together.
Harry had heard the whole “the work of an Auror is never done” but he had never really understood it until now. It had been almost five years of his work as an Auror and the endless stream of death and destruction and darkness was starting to wear on him. He understood now why Aurors who had been doing this for decades were so jaded and paranoid and angry all the time.
‘That’s professor Dray to you.’ Draco said in response, but he was grinning, so Harry didn’t take him seriously.
‘Thanks Gin.’ Harry said with a sigh. ‘Anyone else want a refill?’ He asked, shooing Ron out of the way to get out of their booth.
actually cut his hair too, Harry hadn’t realized it before because he’d been focussed on other things.
‘And he wouldn’t do that.’ Harry added, drawing a laugh out of Ginny. He realized with a start that he’d missed her. He’d missed her no-nonsense approach to him. He missed her sharp eyes and her brutal honesty. Even though it had become clear very quickly that they weren’t going to work out as a couple, Harry was so glad they were still friends. ‘How has Hogwarts been?’
‘Of course. I missed you.’ Draco nodded slowly and bit the side of his bottom lip in an uncharacteristically emotional gesture.
‘Yes, you obviously weren’t telling me the truth with your whole “it wasn’t that bad” and “I’m fine” routine, so I went to your friends-‘
They’d had another bad case that week and it most certainly didn’t help with the tension already between them.
‘I thought her house arrest should have been over by now?’ Harry asked, trying to do the math in his head.
remembered that he couldn’t pay with his wizarding money everywhere. Harry had been tempted to let him try so many times, just to see the faces of the poor people in whatever place they were in, but he’d resisted so far. One day though, one day.
they wanted to stay in the same rooms. That was just too awkward. So they spend their first few years teaching alternating between their rooms during the night.
‘So, this Amelia, how do we feel about her? She was clearly flirting with Malfoy. God knows why, but I don’t think he was interested, even though she is pretty.’ Now that Ginny mentioned it, Amelia
‘Ronald?’ She asked. Ron had only just opened his envelope and Harry felt his stomach squeeze with nerves for his friend. Ron looked up looking relieved more than anything.
‘Yes and no. I really want to go see her, but also, you know she’s going to either launch into a hour long lecture or she’s going to dive head first into research.’ Ron said as he started heading down the street. There was a great Chinese place only a few blocks away that Harry had introduced Ron to (technically he’d introduced Ron to Chinese food in its entirety, but those were semantics), so they headed over there.
‘Would you have?’ Ginny was a lot of things: a bloody good Quidditch player, a stellar dueller and a terrible chess player, but she was not sensitive.
Malfoy to pay him back for anything, that’s not why he had done it, Malfoy was already off. His shoulders were back again and he looked poised, ignoring all of the distrustful looks and the whispers that followed him as he headed to the elevators as a free man.
He tried to flinch away from the bright light. He wanted to bring his hand up to his face to cover his eyes, but he couldn’t seem to move them. What the fuck? There was a pitiful groaning noise that he recognized to be himself. The lights dimmed though, so whatever he did, it worked.
‘So, um, what species is it?’ He handed Draco the shirt and to his credit he didn’t comment on it, but just pulled it over his head.
invited. Harry tried to argue, but Draco quickly shut him up and shoved him into the briefing. It happened like that twice more before Harry put his foot down. Nine months after they’d started officially working as Junior Aurors.
will have to get a good night’s rest, sorry Potter, I don’t make the rules.’ Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
Their next week was tense. They’d had minor arguments before, but most of them had been about cases, not about… them. Harry just didn’t really get it.
They had already had a Junior Auror practically running out of the location while looking green and honestly, Harry was about three seconds away from doing the same. The wizard that lived here had been a very disturbed individual. There were, for lack of a better word,
So he went and found Robards and just told him straight up that he needed a break. Robards looked at him up and down and nodded.
‘This idea that the two of you seem to have that you suddenly have to feel bad for Malfoy.’ He shook his head. ‘I don’t get it. Are you forgetting everything he did to us, to
This chapter is a bit of a jumbled mess, but I'm not sure how to make it better so you'll just have to deal with it.
‘Are you okay?’ Draco looked a little shellshocked. Like he wasn’t entirely sure what just happened.
was gone. Harry clenched his jaw so tightly he felt something crack. Luckily, Robards wasn’t very impressed and the Junior Auror that was Harry’s replacement partner wasn’t intimidated by Gaulding and she told him to “bloody well stop trying to steal her partner or she’d hex him”.
, Ron.’ Harry said. ‘And again, I’m never going to tell you that you have to forgive him, or that you have to be his friend or invite him for dinner, but you can
‘It works the same in Charms though, or Transfiguration. Except when it comes to magic, you can will those subjects into submission, you can’t do that with Potions.’ Draco had a small smirk on his face and it made Harry narrow his eyes.
‘Ugh, I am dating a Gryffindor, this is going to be an adventure.’ Draco sighed, but he looked immensely pleased with himself.
It was on his back, and Draco generally wore layers, many layers. They’d been working together for actual years at this point and Harry had never seen him without a shirt, he’d rarely even seen him in short sleeves. That might have something to do with the ugly black mark on his forearm.
‘What would we even do, if we weren’t Aurors anymore?’ Harry asked as Draco draped his arm over his shoulder.
‘I am thanking him for keeping me and my friends out of Azkaban.’ She flexed her hands at her sides. ‘Now I’m leaving before your
‘I’m sure you did.’ She said before tilting her chin up and walking off, having the Aurors trail behind her like they were there for her protection, not the protection of the others around her. As alien as their behaviour felt to Harry, he admired their ability to appear in control of the situation no matter what was happening.
thought him and Draco were more than just partners? Young had just, accepted that. Like it was no big deal? The conclusion she’d drawn from it was just that he liked blondes? He did not have the energy for this right now. They had a bad guy to catch, he had an uncooperative Gaulding to work around. He didn’t have the mental energy to think about what that meant too much.
‘Wait, shouldn’t we let the others know first before he head there?’ Draco was stood turned towards the door, but with his hand still on the map, like he’d taken a few steps and then stopped himself.
Since then they’d been to Mister Robins whose fence had been broken by a murderous creature trying to steal his pumpkins (a fat, golden retriever that had bashed into the fence while trying to fetch a ball). Ms Hartley who was convinced her cherry pie had been poisoned by Pixies (it was not, she’d just used milk three months past it due by date). The Shawling family, whose pet toad had been kidnapped (it was found by the pond in their backyard) and little Helena who was six and had her child sized broomstick stolen by Goblins (the twin boys of her neighbour). Now they were admittedly little shits, but not exactly what Harry had in mind when he’d decided to become an Auror.
It was very strange to take a test outside of Hogwarts. Harry had decided that pretty early on. During his later years at Hogwarts he had never expected to be sitting in a large hall in the Ministry, waiting for the results of his NEWTs. Sure the professors were there, McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout, but there had also been a few unfamiliar faces to observe their Potions, DADA and Care of Magical Creatures NEWTs. It send a flutter of discomfort down Harry’s spine to be in a Potions type environment without Snape lurking around. It just didn’t feel right without his constant sneer.
Harry sat with that for a little bit as he shovelled the last of his pasta into his mouth. He came to the conclusion he wanted to spend a little time simmering on this. He needed to look at his normal interactions with Draco with this knowledge in the back of his head. So what he needed right now, was a subject change.
He started heading in their general direction. He wasn’t trying to approach them per se (except he really was), he would just casually pass by them on his way to… Padma who he was pretty sure he’d seen somewhere in the hall. He didn’t have to figure out a way to casually start up a conversation with them (luckily because he had no idea how to do that), because Greengrass spoke up when he came near them.
‘Uh, no, no, there is not going to be a next time.’ Harry said with a stern point. He dipped one of the towels in the lukewarm water. ‘Here, get the blood off.’ Draco took the towel and actually started on his hands. His hands were covered in his own blood. Harry hated it. He meant what he said, if he had anything to do with it, he would never see Draco’s blood again.
‘Just- just don’t die, okay Malfoy?’ He wasn’t sure why he suddenly slipped back into the last name habit, but he did. Distance. If Draco was really leaving for months, maybe a year, Harry needed distance. He’d lose his mind otherwise.
‘Hello there.’ George said with a lopsided grin. Harry hadn’t seen that grin much since- since Fred. It was good to see. ‘So you’ve been dragging our little brother through his training, huh?’ He asked.
Harry moved into the small conference room so that he could spread the map out on the big table in there. The office was fairly quiet, Ron and Amelia were out of the office today searching through the ingredients that were found in an illegal potions lab. He didn’t know where Gaulding and Blueroot were, probably off somewhere doing paperwork. Baez was out with her Senior Auror partner. She’d been immediately moved up to them on the account of her prior experience.
‘Hey there Millie.’ Harry said with a grin as he approached her. There were tear tracks on her little round cheeks, but she wasn’t actively crying. Draco was holding her a little awkwardly, but securely. ‘Are you hurt anywhere, sweetheart?’ She shook her head as her bottom lip wobbled. ‘Okay, that’s good to hear. Should we go find your mommy?’ She nodded so hard one of her braids slapped Draco in the face. He blinked twice but didn’t say anything.
Also, Harry thought he’d seen a lot during his years at Hogwarts, which he had, but there was so much more darkness out there in the world that he’d had no idea of. He’d seen so many more ways of wizarding folk hurting each other than he ever thought possible and some days he was just so tired.
Thank you so much for reading! I'll be back on Wednesday. If you want to see the art that I am basing the Auror uniforms off it's this: https://boaillustration.tumblr.com/post/158822344785/i-read-a-lot-of-auror-case-fic-recently-and-wanted
‘What? Yes, I’m fine. All good. Do you know if Amelia has family?’ The words came out painfully sharp and actually a little panicked. Why the hell was he panicking
And they were good at it too. Very good. Draco and Harry quickly gained the reputation of being a great pair. Draco was the more cautious and calculating one while Harry was the better in stressful situations. They complemented each other, but they were different enough to make it so that they had different views on cases. They both had a different expertise, a different way of looking at the world. They just worked.
‘Also, my collarbones.’ Harry said, aiming his bottle at Draco. ‘On one side, a Snitch and on the other side, lilies.’
‘Now see, that’s not right. Look at those.’ Harry said, pointing in the vague direction of his NEWT results. Malfoy did and then in a truly horrible mocking of Harry’s voice he went:
They closed case after case and filed paperwork after paperwork and before Harry knew it, they’d been working as a Senior Auror duo for a year.
The only reason Harry didn’t go and complain to Robards about it was because he knew it wasn’t exactly his choice either. He’d basically lost an Auror duo because now he always had to assign both Harry’s team and Gaulding’s team to the same case and they didn’t even work well together.
It was strange, he’d never really thought about doing anything besides become an Auror, but he hadn’t anticipated the amount of paperwork that was involved in what they did.
‘His sparkling personality, obviously.’ Draco must have caught the tail end of the conversation as he came sauntering back into the room. He looked perfectly fine, so whatever his mother had wanted to talk about probably hadn’t been bad. ‘Pansy, you’re early.’ He approached her and kissed both of her cheeks.
‘Well you don’t have much room anymore on there, but I’m going to guess torso. Left side.’ Harry grinned. He might have been keeping that spot open deliberately and Draco seemed to have noticed.
‘Was there some kind of Sleeping Draught in this?’ Harry asked, motioning with the mug as they headed from the room.
‘Passed all of them.’ Ron had decided to opt out of the Creatures NEWT, but otherwise he’d taken the same as Harry.
‘I do remember her mentioning something like that. Do you mind?’ He asked. Amelia glanced at Malfoy.
It started with the suddenly borderline nervous expression on Draco’s face, which made Harry pause. Draco normally didn’t really do nervous. He had to look twice as Draco slipped his shirt off entirely. At first he wasn’t sure if he was even seeing it right.
go.’ He wasn’t embarrassed to admit he was pleading now. He needed to get both of them out and then him and Robards could decide to either fight or get out of there themselves. Draco stared at him for a second with a clenched jaw and then he deflated. He swiped an annoyed hand through his hair and dug his hand into his inside pocket. His Portkey was a weird little statue of a goblin and he grabbed it tightly before shuffling over to Ron. He tucked his wand away and grabbed Ron’s hand forcing it onto the Portkey.
‘That is the least crazy thing you’ve said so far.’ Ron leaned forward, setting his elbows on his knees. ‘What off?’
‘Good.’ She turned in a flurry of dark hair and a sharp smile and then she was gone. Harry breathed out, releasing tension he wasn’t even aware he’d been holding. He was almost a little annoyed with himself that he couldn’t talk to her like he could talk to Ron or Hermione or Neville or Ginny. Their history was exactly that: history. He vowed that he’d ask Draco if he could join them for another Saturday lunch soon.
think so, but we’re not.’ Malfoy snapped. ‘It’s not a “stupid Pureblood thing”. You did not just keep me out of Azkaban, but my mother and my friends too. You made sure I knew I could take my NEWTs, you gave me an idea for a job and then you helped me get a fair shot at the tests, you keep helping me, and you wanting nothing in return is nonsense. The world doesn’t work like that.’
‘Find Weasley and Frost and get them the hell out of there.’ Robards said sharply, stopping at the small door. Draco and Harry nodded in unison. Harry could feel the adrenaline rush through his system as Robards blasted the door open. Harry was in the door first and he immediately had to cast a Protego. A stunning spell ricochet off it and exploded a crate sitting near the wall. Harry found cover behind a pallet filled with heavy concrete blocks and he surveyed the scene.
The green substance that he send flying at Harry’s head smelled like death. Harry only just had time to raise his hands to stop the stuff from getting in his eyes, but he could feel some of it splash against his mouth and against bare skin.
‘Oh crap, it was the labyrinth wasn’t it.’ Ron asked softly. ‘Shit mate, I should have known that would be bad for you.’ Harry waved him off.
‘I am Head Auror Robards, I would like to know how my people are. Aurors Frost and Weasley?’ Robards stepped up to the Mediwitch behind the counter, doing a great job at sounding important and firm. Kind of like the tone Draco could do very well too. The Mediwitch seemed to want to let Robards in but she glared at Harry and Draco so sharply, he didn’t think his name was going to get him past her. So he let Draco guide him away a little as Robards was let through the door. Draco’s hand on his upper arm was soft and Harry just let himself be led away as he kept his eyes on the door.
. It had amazing silvery-blue scales, with tiny blue flames coming from its nostrils. It looked wild, with long, nearly silver talons. It had a collar around its neck with a chain attached to it, its head tilted towards the sky, up over Draco’s shoulder blade. In a loop it would bare its teeth, tense its body and break its chains. Harry couldn’t figure out if some parts were actually coloured for the tattoo or if that was just Draco’s skin.
Harry found himself standing in a room in a house on the outskirts of London. It had looked abandoned at first and once you stepped through the Glamours, it honestly didn’t get much better. Just more bloody. It had to be one of the worst locations they’d been at.
‘Sure, I will see you on Monday.’ Malfoy said before turning around and heading out of the bar. Harry was startled out of watching his partner leave by a body bumping into him from the left. He turned to see who it was and he caught a flash of ginger hair.
That wasn’t important right now. He tossed the shirt on an empty chair and went back in for the plain white shirt Draco had been wearing underneath. It was a little trickier to get off and he ended up making Draco lean forward while he peeled the shirt off, Draco’s breaths were coming in short little gasps because of the pain so he sat up quickly. Harry only caught a glimpse of his bare back. He registered that there was something there other than pale skin, but he was pretty distracted by the gaping wound in Draco’s side.
‘Okay, but if I take a break, you’re taking a break too.’ He wasn’t about to get rest while Draco did the work for the both of them. Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling.
Thank you so much for reading! I think I'll post the next chapter tomorrow! Keep the posting days the same, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday.
But, he and Draco handled it all with grace (Draco more than Harry) and patience (Draco more than Harry) and a sense of humour (Harry more than Draco, finally
Maybe he should have just been a Gryffindor and asked him out, but every time he opened his mouth to try, nothing came out. There was still a tiny sliver of doubt in his mind. This tiny voice at the back of his mind that said “but what if he doesn’t like you like that, do you really want to risk losing him entirely? He will ask for a different partner” and that filled him with so much dread he choked up every time.
In that year, there had been minor injuries on both of their parts. Scrapes and bruises, a few bumps and the one memorable occasion where Harry had broken his wrist tripping over a walking coffee table.
‘Here.’ Harry startled so bad he nearly threw his coffee cup at Draco’s head. His other hand went for his wand, but he managed to stop himself. He forced himself to put his cup down and turned around.
That was true. In the years they’d been doing this, they’d never taken a single holiday. They had the weekends off, mostly, if they weren’t wrapped up in a case. Maybe a little break wasn’t such a bad idea.
‘Okay, I can give you her information.’ Judging by the look on Draco’s face he could tell that wasn’t quite all Harry wanted.
‘You look much better.’ The same could be said for Draco. He’d finally lost the dark circles under his eyes and his skin overall looked less translucent.
‘Okay, sure.’ Draco’s eyes widened minutely, like he hadn’t expected Harry to agree. Was- was this a test? Well, that only made Harry more determined to make this successful.
Shawna Baez, she was an American witch who had moved to London after a falling out with her parents. She’d worked for MACUSA (the American version of the DMLE) before she moved to London and she’d completed the Auror training programme with little difficulty.
what you meant?’ Harry narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms. When Draco didn’t cave, Harry switched tactics.
‘Well, this is technically still Dawlish and Proudfoot’s case, they’re just bringing me in. You’ll probably have to work with a Junior Auror for a while.’
‘Congratulations.’ Harry grinned at Malfoy as he shimmied onto the bench to sit next to him. It had become a habit of his to form a little barrier between Malfoy and the others. Amelia usually sat on his other side.
‘It’s been years, Ron. Are you still not over that? Your best friend likes him, get over yourself.’ Ron gaped at his sister. Harry felt a little bit like someone had taken the rug and pulled it out from under him. He knew his… interest in Draco hadn’t always been exactly normal. Even back at Hogwarts he was probably more obsessed with what he was up to than technically reasonable. It was just, he’d never even thought about this being more than just a friends kind of thing. Did he actually want to kiss Draco? Was that something he wanted to do?
‘Oh come on Harry, it was a prime opportunity to get a Slytherin to swallow their pride, I can’t pass up on that.’ Ron grinned, unbothered.
‘I think we’ve found the girl.’ He blurted before Robards could start ranting. ‘There’s an old Death Eater safe house only just around the corner, it’s warded to the high heavens. Malfoy is looking for her right now, he can pass through the wards because of the-‘ Harry waved at his left arm. ‘He is the quickest option in there.’ Harry said, holding his hands out in a placating gesture.
‘What are you on about, Potter?’ Malfoy asked. His shoulders were still pressed against the wall, but Harry could have sworn he looked a little less tense.
It had already been dark by the time they managed to de-boobytrap the whole house. Harry had learned a scary amount of ways to boobytrap a house with curses. Death Eaters were creative.
‘Oh please, once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin.’ Harry sighed again, looking to Hermione for help. She gave him a look.
your partner and not me.’ Harry rolled his eyes at Ron’s petulance. If anyone ever dared to say that Gryffindors didn’t hold grudges, Harry would happily point them towards Ron.
knew from his own experience that for most of the things he’d done, he’d been so young and so stupid and he regretted a lot of what he’d done. Especially the stuff he’d done in his sixth year. He’d thought he knew so much and that he was so mature and ready for what was out there and he couldn’t have been more wrong. No one was ever ready for war.
His chin seemed pointier, probably because of his slightly sunken cheeks. He had dark circles under his eyes and his hair had gotten longer. He almost looked a little like his father, which send an involuntary shiver down Harry’s spine. Instead of the proud, Malfoy strut he was used to, he moved around the room like he was begging everyone to pay as little attention to him as possible. Like if he could have, he would have put on his strongest Notice-Me-Not charm. But Harry did notice. He’d spend years making sure that he knew where Malfoy was at all times and that hadn’t just stopped because they weren’t technically on opposite sides now.
‘It’s amazing.’ Harry didn’t want to assume anything, but Draco didn’t take his tattoos lightly. ‘I should probably show you mine.’ Harry threw his robes over a nearby chair, earning him an unimpressed look from Draco. Harry ignored him and pulled off his shirt. Draco’s eyes dropped to his chest. Harry could see the exact moment he picked out the new tattoo.
in fact put thought into this. A lot of it. All of his life he’d had people look at him and then their eyes would dart up to his scar. Ever since he was a baby he’d been marked with something he had no choice in. He had never gotten to
‘Not per se, it’s just…’ Draco seemed to consider his words carefully. ‘mine. It’s mine.’ Harry titled his head and tried to read between the lines.
‘We could go get some drinks after work, unwind a little?’ Young offered. Her tone made Harry stop pacing and look at her. She looked uncharacteristically… nervous.
Despite their little hiccup at the start, they’d worked together pretty seamlessly. They’d come up with the plan together, executed it together and they’d made it back, seemingly before anyone else.
‘Please.’ Ron said and Ginny made a motion Harry interpreted as “I’d like one of my own or I’ll drink yours again”. Malfoy and Amelia didn’t reply so Harry shrugged it off and went to get three new beers. It wasn’t until he started to make his way back, floating the beers in front of him (seriously Ron, magic?) that he noticed how close Amelia was sitting to Malfoy.
‘It’s fine, there’s nothing you could have done anyways.’ Ron looked like he wanted to say something else, but the last of their group of trainee-Aurors came hustling in just before their lectors for the day. There were seven of them left by this point and with them almost being done, it seemed like they would be the ones making it to Junior Aurors.
‘Like a date? But I thought if I asked you out you’d kick me in the nuts?’ Harry had fled into the office to get some reprieve, but now he was just feeling even more off balance.
. I can be professional, it’s just a little crush anyways-‘ Young was bright red at this point. It reminded Harry of how Ron could blush.
Harry felt himself relax once Robards came to tell them that the Auror duo would both be perfectly fine. There had been some spell damage to Ron, but the Healers had dealt with it fairly easily and Amelia had also been patched up. They were going to release Amelia in about an hour, that was also when they’d decide if they would keep Ron overnight or let him go as well. Harry nodded in thanks. Robards headed back to the office to update everyone else.
She said something that might have been “give me a minute” as she headed to the kitchen. Harry looked at Ron.
‘Yes, of course.’ Harry took a step to the side to let them pass, but she paused before walking past him.
‘I should go home.’ Harry stared at him for a few seconds as Draco put his beer down on the coffee table and started heading for his coat.
anything, they’re just fun. Molly loves buying and/or making me pillows, so I guess I collect them now.’ Harry shrugged as he put the glasses and the bottle down, pulling the coffee table closer so that he could sit on the couch and reach it. Draco looked a little horrified and mostly confused.
‘I don’t think I can do that.’ Harry said and he had to swallow down the near overwhelming wave of emotions. Draco nodded slowly.
‘Well, that seemed like it went well.’ Neville remarked before holding his hand out to Harry. He helped pull Neville to his feet. He brushed off his pants. ‘I am going to head home. Let’s get together at some point because I’m still not quite sure what I’m going to do with these.’ He waved his parchment with his NEWTs around.
He hoped that time would help him get better. If he had known this was the price he’d have to pay for defeating Voldemort, he would still have done it, of course he would have, but at least he would have known what he was getting himself into.
‘Uh.’ Harry cleared his throat. ‘Sorry, sir. I suggested Malfoy could try and see if he could become an Auror.’ Harry fidgeted with the sleeve of his robe. Robards’ eyes flickered to Harry.
He’d gone into the week prepared to investigate his own feelings towards Draco and he’d come to a pretty simple conclusion, fairly quickly: he was an idiot.
‘You’ve really adapted well to this whole thing.’ Harry motioned around their new office. They’d been moved from their little cubicles to their own office, with a
‘My lunch with the others.’ Draco said after rolling his eyes. ‘I did say you were my friend now and on Saturday’s I have lunch with my friends.’
‘Bye Neville.’ Harry waited until his friends had left the room before turning to see if Malfoy was still there. He was, but he wasn’t alone anymore. Daphne Greengrass had joined him. He’d always thought of her hair as blonde, but next to Malfoy’s it was almost brown. Her robes looked expensive and she seemed the most calm out of any of the Slytherins he’d seen today.
‘No, not me.’ Before Harry could ask why Draco motioned at the inside of his left arm. ‘The magic recognizes the Dark Mark, that’s why it was much easier for me to find.’
‘Excuse me sir, you cannot go in there.’ The first person to try and stop Harry was an Auror placed at the door to the courtroom.
It was probably because the nightmares with his old friends were familiar by now. He knew what to expect, but with Draco, his dreams were new and his mind was
‘I mean, I guess I’m not blonde enough. I just thought you know, I needed to prove myself, but you’ve been really nice and respectful and you’re a
‘Your partner, Amelia? Back when we had your graduation party, she was totally flirting with Malfoy and Harry was totally jealous.’
‘Down the hall second door on the left. Don’t forget to take care of those bruises.’ Harry motioned at his face again. Draco disappeared down the hall and Harry quickly changed into his pjs. Technically he’d already been in bed before he went to greet Draco, so he could go back to bed now. He was sitting on the edge of his bed as Draco came back from the bathroom, his face now clear from the bruises. He seemed to hesitate in the door opening.
‘It is the worst I’ve seen, and I’ve seen a lot.’ Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest, pulling the red coat taut over his shoulders.
Harry did absolutely nothing for six days out of his week. He didn’t do much except sleep, eat and sleep some more. He missed Draco like something fierce, but he wanted to test how long he could go without him before he drove himself mad. Apparently, he could handle a week.
‘Afternoon.’ Sure enough, Draco’s voice drifted over from the living room. Harry kicked his shoes off and headed to where he’d heard Draco’s voice. He was sitting on one of the loose soft velvety chairs, looking serious and more… soft than he’d looked in a while, his hands folded under his pointy chin.
‘Potter.’ He looked over at her, she looked both apprehensive and annoyed at the same time. Like she was annoyed at her own apprehension. ‘Do you have a second?’ He made sure to smile at her.
her. She’ll leap into your arms, it’ll be fine.’ Harry tried to reassure him. ‘I will go run back into the town and get Robards so that he can yell at me as I take him here and you can get the kid.’ Harry tried to move away, but Draco grabbed his sleeve.
Harry glared, but downed the potion. It tasted bloody awful, but the effect was immediate. Harry’s stomach stopped rolling every time he moved, his limbs didn’t feel like lead anymore and his head stopped pounding. The headache didn’t go away completely, but it was leagues better than before.
‘Yes, just that one today.’ Harry nodded. The two of them had exchanged a few messages talking about what exactly Harry wanted and somehow he’d ended up with ideas for far more than just one. Draco seemed surprised by this.
‘If she is not there, I am putting you two on desk duty until you’re thirty.’ Robards growled out before marching towards Harry. He took at as his clue to lead them there.
‘There’s something I wanted to ask, but I didn’t want to ask in front of Missy.’ Harry said and Draco glanced at him. ‘Do you miss your parents?’ Draco’s steps faltered for a second before he managed to find his rhythm again. He didn’t immediately snap at Harry.
‘Harry!’ Hermione’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts. She looked frazzled and scared. Harry hated it when Hermione looked scared. It had been so long since he’d seen that expression on her face and he hadn’t missed it.
When they all headed back to their own places, Harry found himself happy he went. It was always good to make more contacts, especially in places where he otherwise wouldn’t have contacts. Daphne and Pansy were hellbent on trying to convince him to get new glasses but, he found he didn’t mind all that much. They weren’t being nasty about it, in fact, they were almost funny.
‘Yes, I got that.’ Harry bit out before snapping his mouth shut and forcing himself to breathe. ‘Polyjuice?’ He started to pace between their desks.
‘Fine, I’ll think about it.’ Malfoy still looked unsure, like he thought there was no way it would ever work out.
drive me to-‘ She cut herself off, snapped her mouth shut. She turned on her heel and walked away. Harry sighed.
‘How did it go?’ She asked, wringing her hands together. Her hair was in a messy bun on her head and judging by the dried ink on her fingers, Harry would guess she’d spend her day researching.
‘I thought you already had a tattoo for your parents?’ Draco took a long drag from his bottle, his arm resting on the back of the couch. Harry wanted to launch himself at him. He didn’t. He just sighed.
‘Thanks for staying with me and everything, but you could go home and get some rest. Technically our day is over and since Robards was there, he can do the paperwork for this one himself, right?’ Harry offered with a grin. Draco looked at him.
‘Oh,’ Harry blinked at him a few times. He hadn’t even realized he’d called him that. ‘I didn’t realize. Do you mind?’ Draco seemed to consider that for a second.
hair, but you did that plenty of times.’ Harry was kind of proud he kept the bite out of his voice. ‘So, what did you get?’
‘I don’t miss how it was in the end.’ Draco said, looking straight ahead. ‘But, I guess I do miss how things were in my childhood sometimes.’ He swallowed and a wry smile spread over his face. ‘It wasn’t perfect, but my father wasn’t a bad man.’ Harry wasn’t sure if he agreed on that, but then again, how well had he known Lucius Malfoy? ‘He really changed after our fourth year.’ After Voldemort came back.
‘Well- I mean- kinda?’ Draco rolled his eyes, but he smiled Harry’s favourite smile. The quiet, exasperated, fond little smile he’d only ever seen him smile for Harry.
Draco was “fired” very publicly. Harry wasn’t allowed to throw a fuzz about it, people had to see that he was on the side of the Ministry, to make it believable. Harry hated every single second of it. Draco played it like a champ. The confusion bleeding into indignation bleeding into cold fury. He stormed out and Ron had to put his hand on Harry’s arm to stop him from following.
Harry really didn’t know what to expect, but he didn’t feel particularly nervous. He had been thinking about becoming an Auror for so long and people had always just assumed that’s what he would go on to do (if he survived the whole Voldemort business obviously) he just kind of expected this to go well. He felt like this had to go well, because, what else was he supposed to do? Fighting against the dark was what he had been expected to do since he was a baby, it’s what his parents had done. It’s what he would do.
‘Yeah, it’s partially why Mione is so emotional right now.’ Ron said, a grin overtook his face. ‘Moine’s pregnant. We’re having a baby.’ Harry wasn’t even sure what his face did in that moment, just that whatever it was it made Hermione smile (even if it was a little watery).
made plenty of stupid decisions when I was sixteen, I didn’t know what I was doing, I still sometimes don’t. Should he really be punished for mistakes he made while he was barely legal?’
‘I told you so.’ Daphne just grinned as she held her hand out to Blaise while he dug around in his pocket and fished out a Galleon he handed to her. Greg just kind of shrugged and kept eating. Millie barked out a laugh and said: “get it Draco”. Harry could feel his cheeks heating up, but he was sure his blush was nothing compared to Draco, whose cheeks were practically scarlet.
. After my House Elf healed a giant fucking hole in your side.’ Draco pushed himself up off the couch. He still moved a little gingerly and Harry hated it. He also hated how
He knew, intellectually, that he had to eat and Ron and Hermione tried, but they weren’t with him all day every day like Malfoy had been. They didn’t see the things Harry saw. He ran out of the stash of Dreamless Sleep that Malfoy had left him and he just… didn’t get new ones. So he started sleeping even less.
‘I know that. He was just always the one to remind me to eat and then I’d make us go home at a reasonable time because I wanted to make sure
He spotted two bright red coats on the other side of the room. He recognized the figure laying motionless on the floor immediately. There was no mistaking that hair.
‘Yes, ma’am and this is my partner, Draco Malfoy. He’s the one who found Millie.’ He smiled at the girl as he said it and she nodded her head vigorously. The mother blinked a few times, she clearly also recognized Draco’s name, but then she smiled carefully.
His eyes were drawn away from Neville’s slightly embarrassed smile, to the blonde dressed in black trying to melt into the shadows. Malfoy wasn’t too far away from them so Harry could see how tightly he was gripping the parchment with his scores. Harry hoped he got what he wanted. He was surprised to find that he wanted to go over to him and find out.
‘Good.’ Her smile turned a little calculating. ‘I heard you had lunch with Draco the other day, on a weekend?’ Ah, right.
something has changed.’ She took a deep breath. ‘But things are better as well. The houses are actually more kind towards each other, even Slytherin, although that is a work in progress, what you said has really been taken to heart.’ She smiled at him.
‘Oh Merlin, is this what it’s going to be like? The sappy, disgustingly sweet sentiments?’ Harry laughed and laughed and laughed until he had tears rolling down his cheeks.
someone to try and attack him. Now, if they went out after dark, he would look over his shoulder from time to time, almost like he couldn’t help it. During daytime he’d sometimes flinch at loud, unexpected sounds.
They fell back into silence for a while. A few times, Harry tried to make himself say that they should go back inside, but the words wouldn’t come. He didn’t want to go back, he wanted to go home.
that I said something in there?’ Harry asked. ‘They were being unfair. I would have done that for anyone.’
‘Oh please. In case you didn’t know,’ Harry put on his most self-important, annoying voice. ‘I’m Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived Twice. And I have quite a lot of sway with the Headmistress, she was my Head of House, you know.’ Draco’s smile turned into a full blown grin.
‘No thanks.’ Warmth bloomed behind Harry’s breastbone when Draco quickly smiled back at him and then disappeared from the room.
‘Sorry.’ Malfoy’s voice was low and a little scratchy but he looked miles better than Harry felt, which was unfair. He held out a bottle to Harry, it looked like a potion. Harry made a face. ‘Hangover cure.’ Malfoy clarified. Harry was reaching for the bottle before he’d even properly got the words out of his mouth. Malfoy grinned at him.
Ron dragged him along to the couch at the back of the lounge. He flopped down on it and pulled Harry onto the cushion next to him.
‘Of course not.’ And he did what Harry told him to. He handed the other pieces of clothing off to Harry as well and he tried not to marvel over how
‘That’s amazing.’ He managed. ‘Congratulations.’ He hurried forward and nearly tripped over the coffee table in his haste to get to them. He hugged Hermione first and then Ron.
‘I still don’t like it.’ Ron crossed his arms and pouted. ‘I hate the idea of you being in that apartment all on your own.’ Harry sighed.
‘Yes, I suppose I’m done for the morning. I should head off soon.’ He sounded like he almost regretted that. That look turned into something calculating. ‘You could always come with me.’ Harry blinked at him stupidly.
He ended up Flooing back to his apartment near eleven feeling warm and calm and happy. He had learned though, that no matter how calm he felt before going to bed, he needed to take his small dose of Dreamless Sleep anyways, because the nightmares would come not matter how he felt before going to bed.
‘Let’s make sure it’s there first.’ Harry said and Malfoy sighed but he started leading Harry down a street.
‘Oh that’s good.’ Harry could feel the awkwardness creeping in. They’d been fine while they’d been in a bigger group, but now he didn’t really know what to say. Luckily, Parkinson seemed to have had lessons on this, maybe in pureblood school or something.
From what they understood, the wizard had become sick, and when no Healer could help him he’d turned to making sacrifices. He had convinced himself that killing all of these innocent creatures would heal him and they’d only figured it out when he kidnapped a young wizard to be his final sacrifice.
‘Yes well, I was putting off telling you.’ He looked mildly concerned. ‘You’re not going to like this part.’
‘It’s five o’clock on a Monday, let’s not get into technicalities.’ Harry walked over to him, he seemed to be correcting essays. There were rolls of parchment neatly divided into two piles. When Harry checked his students’ essays it usually ended in organized chaos, but not Draco. He ran his hand through Draco’s hair. He made a faux-frustrated noise, but he didn’t attempt to get away from Harry.
Draco was right. Beyond the grandeur of some of the rooms, the Manor really didn’t seem all that familiar to him. There was nothing he recognized about the small sitting room Draco lead him into.
doing it!’ They all turned towards the yelling voice and found that it was Zabini who had snapped at Malfoy. Malfoy straightened up, drawing himself to his full height, for the first time since the trial he looked like himself. Whatever Malfoy hissed back at him was too quiet for Harry to catch, but it didn’t look friendly.
Harry shook it off, Draco hadn’t done anything bad and if there was a case, Harry would have been invited too. Maybe Draco had just decided to get them some coffee while he was out.
‘Mister Potter, I don’t know what exactly your motivation was to do what you did, but thank you.’ He could tell she was not used to thanking people.
Finally! I know it's taken ages, but they finally figured their shit out! Only one more chapter to go, it probably won't be super long, but I do really want to wrap the story up nicely and show you where the boys end up and how they're doing!
spotted most of the Slytherins from their year. He supposed they were just hoping not to have to go back to Hogwarts ever again, he would assume that wouldn’t be pleasant for them. Harry had spotted Zabini, Parkinson and Greengrass during his Herbology NEWT and he’d seen most of the others during his Charms and Potions NEWTs. It seemed like they were keeping their distance from everyone else as much as from each other. It couldn’t be easy for them, suddenly not knowing where loyalties laid.
‘We will now deliberate.’ Minister Shacklebolt said before casting a Imperturbable Charm around the Wizengamot.
‘Why are you being nice to us?’ Malfoy asked, his face twisting at the word “nice”, earning him a sharp look from his mother.
‘Of course not, by all means.’ Minister Shacklebolt said, even if he did look a little confused and suspicious. Then again, he looked like that quite often, he had even back in the days of the Order. Harry took a seat near the isle.
‘You’re acting like a dismissive arsehole again. I thought we were done with this?’ Harry said with as much bite as he could muster. It wasn’t a lot. The look on Draco’s face seemed blank at first, but Harry could see the tightness around his eyes and the downwards pull of his mouth. He was angry. Harry just didn’t understand why.
‘Okay, lunch is at the Manor this week so you can Side-Along with me.’ Harry ignored how his stomach clenched when he realized what Manor Draco was talking about. He was going back to Malfoy Manor for the first time since the war.
.’ Robards snarled before any of the Junior Aurors trailing after him could even try. If the Junior Aurors were not allowed to come that meant it was serious. Robards turned the alarm off just before they excited the Auror offices.
‘-he’s helped me out when I needed it. I would not have passed the Poisons and Antidotes course without him. He’s actually
‘Hello Blaise, Draco invited his good friend Harry Potter today, isn’t that fun!’ Parkinson grinned. Zabini didn’t look like he thought it was “fun” at all. Not even a little bit, in fact. Only a few seconds later Daphne Greengrass walked through the doors. She was the first that didn’t look absolutely shocked at seeing Harry in the parlour of Malfoy Manor.
‘I didn’t really know what else to do. Once I got older, everyone just assumed I would become an Auror. Fighting against the Dark is kind of what I’ve been doing since I learned about magic. It seemed like it was just what I was
Harry cast a wandless, wordless Tempus and was shocked to realize they’d been here for nearly two hours. When did that happen?
Draco nodded in approval when Harry came from his room again. They headed out of the apartment and Apparated to the Manor. Seeing it again, after such a long time, looming over him made Harry stop dead in his tracks.
‘I know that, you more than any of us.’ Harry didn’t really agree on that, per se. ‘I’m just- I’m worried about you mate. You spend all of your time with Malfoy and you turn your back on him now without even thinking and at least once a week you come in looking like you didn’t sleep a wink and I just want you to be okay.’ Harry chose to focus on the first part.
‘Now see, they’re not as good as mine. Look at those.’ With a wave of those stupidly pale, slim hands. Harry rolled his eyes and did.
Harry lead them down the side street and made sure to pay close attention so that he wouldn’t miss the hum of the wards this time. He stopped when he felt them.
The Ministry, at least Dawlish would be there at some point. Harry shot into his clothes. Jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, socks, shoes, wand. He barely even got himself outside of the wards before he Apparated. He didn’t run through the Atrium, but only because he didn’t want to make someone think that there was something wrong. There was something very, very right. Draco was coming back. He was
‘Yes, miss Haywood?’ She straightened the sleeves of her robes, which usually meant she wanted to ask something she wasn’t sure he was going to answer or something she thought he would say no to. Like that time she asked if he’d take them on a night-time trip into to Forbidden Forest.
Slytherins, or maybe it was just these Slytherins. Parkinson seemed to find all of this immensely amusing and Harry just didn’t quite get
‘You chose it because it fits your colour scheme?’ Harry offered with a slight smile. The corner of Draco’s mouth quirked up.
As far as Harry could tell, he’d stopped brewing potions for his own pleasure. Where, from what Harry understood, it had previously been a therapeutic thing for him to do, he seemed to have lost that. At least for now.
‘I’m just being honest.’ Draco said in that faux-haughty tone before he turned serious again. ‘I’ll go home when you go home.’
‘I will admit he didn’t say a single nasty thing to any of my family while he was here.’ She pursed her lips. ‘But I’m not convinced. Ron has a conspiracy theory that Malfoy is hypnotising you or has you under Imperius.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
‘Okay, okay, fine.’ Harry made a shooing motion at him. ‘Alright, I’m going.’ Draco took a deep breath before stepping forwards towards the bushes and disappearing.
‘Well, then do something about it.’ He made an impatient motion with his hand. ‘We do not have time for this.’ Harry rolled his eyes and pictured Ron’s eyes.
Harry tried to ask about it, but it was pretty clear Draco did not want to talk. He’d always brush Harry off with a borderline snide remark. Saying he was fine. That Harry needed to stop babying him. That Harry was not his mother. That he should mind his own business.
‘Yes. We all did things during the war we’re not proud of. I know I did, but I’m Harry Potter so no one judged me for it. You deserve better than what they were going to give you.’ Draco stopped walking. Harry stopped and looked back at him. His face was blank but his eyes were searching Harry’s face.
‘Dreamless Sleep. Not too much because it makes me feel like I wouldn’t wake up if… something were to happen, but enough that I at least get a few solid hours.’ Harry said and Draco nodded slowly.
He was so caught up in pretending not to notice anything that he nearly ran in to someone. He sidestepped at the last second.
‘I haven’t decided.’ There was a challenging lit to his voice now. Like he wanted Harry to argue with him. ‘It’s not going to be easy to find someone willing to employ me with that whole deal.’ He motioned towards his left arm. Right. The Dark Mark, a permanent reminder of the war, of what he’d done or hadn’t done.
he recognized me’ Harry turned his eyes to Malfoy, who was studiously looking at the floor. ‘and yet he told them he wasn’t sure, that he didn’t know. He bought us time, which eventually allowed us to escape.’
‘I think you need a break. We’ve had a lot of rough cases lately. Talk to Robards, take a week off.’ Draco said. ‘We haven’t really had any time off since we started.’
‘Well thanks. It’s good to see your lovely face as well. With the bruises and the dark circles.’ Harry made a few exaggerated motions at his own face. Draco rolled his eyes, but the gesture was so familiar Harry didn’t even really care.
Spells slammed into Harry’s Protego, but stopped once Draco fired back a rapid burst of Stunners and Exploders of his own. Whoever these attackers were, they did know what they were doing. After a dead out sprint, Harry skidded to a halt next to Amelia.
‘What, no. I would never do that. You’re a good Auror and Gaulding is an arsehole.’ Harry tried to reassure her. It was genuinely not even something he had considered an option.
‘Did you see the cut on Amelia’s forehead? Or how she was clutching her ribs? She wouldn’t have been able to cover you properly. Now get your Portkey and get Ron to St Mungo’s.’ Draco’s head snapped towards him from where he’d been peering out from behind their cover.
. He was sure Malfoy would hex him to all hell if he knew that Harry found the trial to determine his future boring, but what he didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him.
Malfoy would snap at Harry if he tried to throw himself head-first into a situation and Harry would push Malfoy to be more daring. To not always stop to consider if something was the most beneficial move to make. Sometimes you needed to act.
‘Like…’ Harry let his sentence trail off again. He felt a little off balance, not knowing exactly what was going on here.
Draco told him about the case as Harry read. It seemed fairly easy, they just needed to find who the ingredients in this warehouse belonged to. It
They started heading down the street, Robards marching ahead of them with a slightly less murderous expression on his face. Harry knew exactly when the mother spotted her daughter.
And so they got ready for bed. They stumbled around the apartment and the singular bathroom. Harry loaned Draco some sleep pants and a shirt. The pants were hilariously short on his long legs and Harry was still snickering when Draco closed the door of the guestroom in his face with a huff. When Harry’s head hit the pillow he was asleep almost immediately.
‘What in Merlin’s name is the problem here?’ He asked. ‘Robards?’ He prompted when no one immediately started to speak.
And finally, Grant Blueroot, who was a bit of a strange fellow, smart as a whip, but very quiet. He’d been paired with Gaulding for most of his Auror training (after Gaulding’s first partner had ran screaming) and he mostly let the loudmouthed wanker walk all over him. Malfoy compared him to Goyle, but smarter.
‘What can I say, I have terrible impulse control.’ Draco rolled his eyes and murmured something that sounded suspiciously like “bloody tell me about it”. Missy laughed and turned to Harry.
was gone, he realized how bad it had been. How wrong it had felt not to be on good terms with Draco.
‘I’m planning on speaking for your mother as well.’ He said and Malfoy’s head snapped up. He was quiet long enough that Harry had almost accepted he wasn’t going to say
‘So, I’ve been thinking, right? About getting another tattoo.’ Harry said as Draco came back from where he’d been getting both of them a refill from the kitchen. Draco pretty much acted like he was at home now in Grimmauld place (technically he
‘I was wondering about your tattoo.’ She gestured at his right wrist. He’d rolled up his sleeves earlier in the class and apparently she’d spotted the one on his wrist. He lifted his hand so she could get a better look. The little snake curled around his wrist, wiggled around a little before settling down again.
‘I know.’ Harry said. ‘I was there.’ That was a little sharper than necessary, but he did not need to be reminded of that day, he remembered. ‘The problem here is the question whether or not Draco Malfoy had a
‘I love it.’ Harry said with a smile. Harry shrugged off his own dark grey jacket and held it out to Draco. ‘Do you want to put this on before we go back to the office? We need to make sure the others know that they know we’re after them now.’ Draco looked at his ruined shirt with a forlorn expression.
‘Oh gosh!’ Ginny suddenly said loudly, interrupting Amelia in the middle of a sentence. ‘I just realized we haven’t even introduced ourselves. Ron! This is your partner right? Come on, introduce us.’ She demanded. Ron seemed confused, but did as he was told. Good call.
‘Ron used his yesterday to transport that young witch to St Mungo’s and mine was in my jacket.’ She nodded at a smouldering pile of shredded red fabric a few paces away from them. Harry immediately dug his hand into his inside pocket. He found the keychain shaped like a London taxi and shoved it into Amelia’s hand.
‘They were taken by Healers, they told me I couldn’t go any further.’ The annoyed tone in Draco’s voice was pretty clear. ‘I’m interested to see if you two get the same treatment.’ Right, that
His latest addition to his collection of tattoos was a pretty special one. Well, all of them were special, but this one certainly was as well. When he’d told Missy of his newest idea, she grinned like she knew something he didn’t. Which was true.
‘That’s not a very Slytherin thing of you to ask.’ Harry tried to joke, but Malfoy didn’t seem to be in a laughing mood, which was fair. ‘I am not “being nice” I am doing what’s right. What am I supposed to do with this?’ He gestured with the wand. ‘It’s of no use to me, you’re here, I’m giving it back.’
, so he’d gone back down the rickety stairs careful not to touch anything and now he’d been standing near the front door for the last few minutes, trying to decide if he was walking out of there or not.
‘Are you saying you couldn’t afford a new shirt if this one is “ruined”?’ Harry asked with a smirk. Malfoy rolled his eyes and pulled up his nose.
deciding how I want to mark my body.’ Draco’s smile softened, he twisted his arm so that the Dark Mark was a little more visible.
Gaulding had decided he was going to be Harry’s friend, if Harry liked it or not. Also, he had decided he would like to trade his current partner, Blueroot, for Harry.
Harry walked into their office, knowing she’d shut the door behind them. He still wasn’t used to Malfoy’s name not being on the door anymore.
‘No, Robards even pulled his wand on him.’ He said with a small laugh. ‘It’s like the start of a bad joke: A Death Eater walks into the Auror offices-‘
‘Well that’s good, because Robards was just here and we have a new case.’ Draco nodded at the file on Harry’s desk. ‘Hit Wizards found a warehouse full of illegally acquired potions ingredients.’
‘That’s right.’ Draco said with a smile. ‘Water is the element of change. We can adapt to the situation to get us the optimal outcome.’ He motioned at Harry. ‘I realized immediately you were going to drive me insane with your fidgeting and your tapping, so I cast a silencing charm on your desk and chair. I can still hear it if you speak to me, but the tapping against the desk or the wiggling of the chair doesn’t make any sound to me. I foresaw an issue and I adapted.’
nearby, sometimes fellow trainee’s or even fully-fledged Aurors would take the opportunity to make snide comments at him. Now Malfoy acted like it didn’t bother him, but Harry preferred to prevent it anyways.
Harry got accepted to the Auror training programme. So did Ron and apparently, so did Malfoy. Of the approximately fifteen witches and wizards that had been there for the assessment, eleven seemed to have been accepted to the actual training. According to Robards, probably only half would graduate. He did also point out that this was the biggest class they’d had in years. The programme had been shortened because of the losses they’d suffered during the war. They needed new Aurors. Several of the recruits were from their year, they’d fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and that seemed to be pretty much a guarantee that they’d at least let you start the training.
