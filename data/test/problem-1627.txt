"He's not insane anymore, is he? Why would he want to kill a child who has no impact on the world? And even so, why would he frame it like a troll attack?"
He had left the knife too, so he simply removed his clothes, jumped in the shower and got ready for bed. He fell asleep with a smile, kissing Belladonna's head. She told him she was proud.
Severus turned sharply, "You are giving me the impression that you have seen mister Malfoy beneath his underclothes, and a deeply hope that your haven't. I may have to seperate you."
T: Harry no. It a difficult curse and it could backfire on you. You have to mean in when you say it. Want to cause true pain.
Meanwhile Harry was writing in his diary, talking to Tom, who was giving him some much needed information.
Draco and Ginny got along very well, and Narcissa planned on doing a mental evaluation on her, because she showed to be at similar levels to Draco when he was regressed. Narcissa assumed it was the trauma, but she wasn't sure how the girl would cope when Draco went back to school.
"You are normal, Harry. The world's perceived notion of normal is not a correct one." He looked up, placing his book down, "I know you're struggling. We all are, and I know you can be a little mad sometimes," he shot up a silencing charm, and a strong one at that, "but I also know you're a caring boy. You act much too old, but I can't imagine what goes on in your head. You're full of love, but you're also traumatised. And well, also a little bit insane, but your family still love you. We are your family now, Harry. Things are hard, but know that I will stand by you. The Malfoys, Tom, Severus, me, Ginny and Kode, we all love you. Just warn me at least next time you plan on murdering someone, got it?"
"No. You shall not do it alone." His voice was wavering, but only slightly. Narcissa got up, telling her husband quickly that she was taking the children home. Lucius nodded, and Draco was dragged away with the other two.
"Tom wouldn't ask you to murder a poor eleven year old girl." His tone was bland, and Harry felt genuinely guilty for upsetting him so.
He had a small chat with the prefect and just as he was leaving he heard his name being called, "Ah! Professor Snape, before you leave may I have a moment of your time?" The too awake raven haired Slytherin asked.
He looked at Dudley's watch, and just as it reached midnight he said: "Happy birthday Harry." Just as there was a loud banging on the door. Uncle Vernon came down, holding his rifle in is chubby hands. Then a man, (could he call him that?) Knocked down the heavy door, and came in holding a pink umbrella.
Harry was awoken by a small tapping on his shoulder, and when he blinked his eyes open he saw Draco standing at the side of his bed. His hair was sleep mussed, his two friends and blanket clutched under his left arm and his dummy lazily bobbing between his lips.
They made small talk, which neither boy nor man was used to, but it seemed to work. Harry was a child Severus didn't hate. He almost acted grown, without the snobbishness that came with it. He was a mix of child and adult that Severus could deal with.
A few seconds later he popped back in however, "Also, make sure Draco has his teddy." And then he left again.
Narcissa took to the stand, and began speaking with a clipped tone, "I was the Medi Witch asked to test Karkoden Black, previously known as Ronald Weasley, for any relations to Bellatrix LeStrange. The test came back positive, proving that someone was working at fault. Molly reacted in a violent way, which lead to Ginny Weasley coming into mine and my husband's emergency care."
T: Now, now Harry I know you wish for a parental figure in your life, but lets not have it be such a degrading muggle name, shall we? Try father.
"Dumbledore. During the first war, he formed a group of people called the Order if the Phoenix. While Molly and Arthur weren't a part of it, they still followed Dumbledore. He found out Bellatrix had a child, you, and tracked her down. They attacked her while she was alone, and stole you away."
The potions shop was the one they spent most time in, unsurprisingly. Severus shrunk both their belongings as they were leaving.
Later that night, when he had been dropped off at the Dursleys and relocked in his cupboard, he relayed it all to Tom,
She screamed some nonsense, and was removed from the room. With that, the seven children found themselves being escorted to a back room.
The court room was silent, before minister fudge nodded, and called Lucius up in her place, with a word of viewing the memories and physical proof after the hearing.
At approximately 2 am, after the boy awoke from nightmares and the sheer pain of his injuries, he found an old tattered book on his bed, centimetres from his head. He picked it up as cautiously as a five year old could and opened it, but it was blank.
Percy and Severus got along quite well, and after eating excused himself so the two could finish their conversation. He wandered the halls, delving into his mind. He found Voldemort to be good at keeping him company.
Both boys nodded, Percy speaking first, "She hit me- but I always assumed I was taking the brunt for everyone else. She would get angry at the twins, and then hit me. All the emotional stuff was there too."
Harry relaxed in the silence, Draco curled up to him with his thumb bobbing between his lips. He brought himself into the dark folds of his mind, searching for what he assumed to be the voice. His mind was neatly organised, something he'd done while locked in his cupboard.
He nodded sharply, "That's the reason I'm chained. Before I was just trapped in the darkness. I used so much power doing that, that your mind protected one of us, I'm not sure which. Probably both. I can now do nothing. I could probably change a thought if it was already bad, but nothing more. I've chipped away at your sanity enough now, that you won't need as much nudging."
H: Perhaps, because they blocked him like Bella's baby, that's why he's so bad at magic? They blocked him too.
"No one is darling, but at the end of the day, he has chosen the many he wants to follow, even if it is years too early. I'm just wondering how long it will take for Harry to mark him, if he hasn't already." Narcissa spoke, subconsciously running her hand over her own mark.
He received a nod, to which he opened it and got one out, muttering a sanitisation spell. Thank Tom for his extensive knowledge on strange things.
"Of course," he nodded, and after a few seconds had a small pot of whitish salve in his hand. Narcissa took it and applied it to the girls ear, wiping at the blood.
He quickly noted Harry was causing the disturbance, staring intently at the animal with wrinkles creasing his forehead.
It was in pretty cursive writing, and harry struggled with the last word, but figured it must mean book or something alike. He tried to find one of Dudley's old pens he didn't use that Harry had stolen, or rescued as he put it, to write a reply, Aunt Petunia used to make Harry write apology letters every day when he was four, and still did now if he had nothing to do, so he was a decent writer for a five year old.
They finished their drinks, mostly talking about school. They walked back towards the Leaky Cauldron, and to the apparition point. Soon, they were back at Hogwarts.
"He simply didn't know, I suppose. The other pieces must of realised that I was removed and assumed I'd died. I'm insane on my own, but with the rest of my soul I shall be normal again. Lady Magic did not destroy me, thankfully. I can hear bits and pieces, but the diary tom blocked all contact with other soul pieces, unless he was talking to them. He blocked me, but as he thought I was dead it wasnt as strong as the others. I know little bits."
"Right, well unless you want me to give you a shower I suggest you get in right now." He said and the small boy huffed, and started unbuttoning his night shirt, getting more and more frustrated with it by the second. "Here," Harry sighed softly and finished undoing the buttons and pulling the shirt from him. "I understand you're emotional and distraught, but come on. You gotta help me too." He tried, he received a teary eyed Draco and a meek, "I want my daddy." Before he started crying again.
Harry nodded, "Is there a chance you could be adopted? I'm not trying to upset you- but Ginny had to be due term when she was both in order to survive, and that's impossible with you."
"Harry," the professors voice was hard, "he is a dangerous man, and not one to be messed with. Whatever you have gotten yourself into, you need to get out of. I don't want you getting hurt."
"He is, sort of. He split his soul. I keep in contact using the diary he trapped part of himself in."
Once the great feast was finished, a sixth year prefect lead all the first years to the first year common room, telling them all the password was 'pureblood'. How unique of them, Harry thought, smirking. Once all the first years were in a line, the prefects started talking, Professor Snape standing in the background.
Harry nodded, respectful of his superiors, but couldn't help a sarcastic, "Yes, my lord." As he walked past.
And this, my friends, is where I stopped writing. Maybe I'll pick it back up one day, maybe not. Thanks for getting this far in my absolute mess lol
She hit the ground with a thud, her face frozen in terror. Harry sat by her, and dragged one of his fingers down her cheek. "Sorry, professor." His voice was dead as he drive the knife straight through her chest. He twisted the knife, so the wound was more open.
Draco was confused because he had gone to the bathroom just before History- and so did Harry, if he remembered correctly.
Tom snarled, once again, and stepped down. "Out of my sights. We will continue this later, young man."
Harry nodded, "I'll calm myself. But I'm going to make them pay." His eyes were darker, and Tom stared into them, "I don't doubt you will, my child."
Draco nodded happily and Harry made quick work of tucking his shirt in. Neither were in uniform, but Harry still wanted to be presentable. Draco was wearing black trousers and a green silk shirt, white Harry was wearing grey patterned trousers and a white shirt. He debated about a waistcoat and eventually decided to go with it, leaving the suit jacket off.
"I feel awful. I thought the evil part had died; but Harry was carrying the burden this whole time."
Harry smiled at the concern, "Don't worry Sir, all is well and I am safe. Now," he redirected his attention to Draco, "let's go back to our dorm, shall we?"
Karkoden had pulled some chocolate from his pocket and was nibbling away, partially blocking out the conversation.
"He wasn't all bad. He was intoxicating. He was a man fighting for lesser rights, essentially," Severus cleared his throat, "he was a good man once. A man who turned sour through war. None of us, his followers, recognized him. He was... A different man. Insane, even."
"Does that mean I get to do prefect rounds with you?" Harry skipped to keep up, pressing to Percy's side.
As they were walking down the street, a sickening voice sounded in his head, "Off for a little stroll with a filthy half-blood, are we?"
Harry had took in his options, and ultimately decided he'd like to work alongside Lord Voldemort, but had no wish to become a Death Eater. That when Tom told his with slight relief he was on the Dark side, too. And in fact the one and only Voldemort.
There was a knock on their dorm door, and it was pushed open in a second. Draco froze but Harry blocked the intruders view with his body, pulling his wand, just to see it was their head of house.
"I can read minds professor. Peoples darkest desires are above their heads, surrounded by blinking lights. I know everything."
Harry smiled at the small boy, noting the black blob a bit behind the Harry drawing, "What's this, sweetheart?"
"I-I'm sorry." He hiccuped, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. Severus stepped to the side, "I got S-Sev'rus cause you was hurted a-and," another small hiccup and a quiet sob, "I din' wan you t-to be hurted."
T: Yes, it is perfectly safe. Mostly. Getting back on track, after the fact we will need to gather all of my other Horcruxes. We will need to break Bella out of Azkaban to get one from her vault.
"What are you doing?" Tom hissed, but Harry nonchalantly waved his hand at him, effectively silencing him. Once Harry was done being stupid he dragged himself and Tom out of the room, locking it again.
"So how was it?" The ginger boy asked, knocking and walking in to Severus' rooms. The man was currently patrolling, but Percy was awfully polite.
"Can you go to sleep for me? You need it." Harry complied, nodding off quickly. He was tucked up on the couch, when Tom disappeared and Quirrel slumped against the sofa.
Once they were out of the magical alley, Harry perked up a bit more. "Can we sit in a diner, professor? I'm getting hungry."
He rested a gentle hand on Harry's shoulder, and shook his slightly, "Harry, can you wake up for me?"
Going to the ice cream shop was the best part of the day. All seven children sat around the largest table, the three adults sitting on one slightly to the left. Percy had vanilla, the twins shared a large bowl of cookies and cream, Harry had chocolate mint, Draco with salted caramel. Karkoden had butterscotch, Ginny simply having banana. All in all, a good meal.
"Well, minister, growing up in an abusive household it's quite easy to spot the signs. I did some digging, and found out that Koden and Ginny's birthdays were too close together- I heard Draco mention in passing about his cousin who had been stolen from his crib. The birthdays matched up, so I took a long shot. And I was correct."
Harry scoffed, and scuffed his shoes against the stone hallway. The rest if the evening was uneventful, and Harry sat with Atlantes. They devised a plan, and Belladonna had finally joined them.
T: I understand, and he will. Get through these few days, figure out where Dumbledore is hiding that blasted stone and I will tell you how to bring me back to full health. Then I will take you from them and you will be my heir. The heir of Slytherin, Gaunt, and Riddle. Now, straighten yourself up.
Narcissa sighed, "I suppose we'll have to go to the courts. But I promise all of you will go somewhere you want to be."
"Well- not with my real mum, if that's what you mean. I remember being really little when Gin was born- but that's it. Mu-Molly wasn't overly nice for a while, mostly mean to me, things like, forgetting to feed me or locking the door when I was in the bathroom, but it got worse when I was about four."
"Dumbledore, if you attempt to disrupt this procedure again I will take you to court on the base of perverting the course of justice."
"Blowing up part of the castle could become a hazard. We'd still be going to lessons, there would just be more watchful professors because they would know it was a student. It would just cause more hassle. Plus, I'd never want to destroy this beautiful place."
Since the boy went through his cleansing, his true looks came to seep through. His hair curled, and was growing darker, his freckles faded and eyes glowed in a way that was true to the Black line. He lost some pudge, and shot up about four inches. He was still slightly recognisable as a Weasley, but Narcissa said his old looks would be gone by the time he would go back to school, if he wanted to.
"So, who do you think is going next out of us two?" Fred asked, mouth half full of sandwich, whilst motioning to his twin.
Harry smiled weakly, "I'm sorry, can Draco and I have some time alone? I need to... Ah, confide if you will,"
"Come along, Ginny." Molly's tone was harsh, and the girl cried harder, "No! I don't want to!" She sounded almost hysterical, and turned her wet sad eyes too Narcissa, "Please don't make me go,"
The Tom in the diary mentioned doing something else, like figuring out what was below Fluffy. Harry said he'd do it at some point.
"I'll leave you two to it. I'm going to do some extra potions work with professor Snape if you need me." Harry waved his goodbye, and Ron got a sour look on his face.
Harry was all too glad when the lesson came to an end, and Draco was fidgeting in his seat. Harry took the recently drawn and coloured pictures, folded them up, and placed them in his pocket. The fidgeting continued even as they were walking to their next lesson - history of magic - so Harry decided to take a quick detour to the toilets.
Harry quickly decided he was never letting evil Tom loose in his mind, "But what was that, when you spoke in my head? Were you controlling me?"
"At midnight she checks the bathrooms by the great hall. Can you get there?" After receiving an affirmative reply he continued, "So you'll just get her then. I'll be able to cover everything up." Harry rubbed the large snakes head, "Do you need any form of payment?"
"Yes, and they viewed me as the best candidate for watching you. I'm not exactly sure why, but I'll take it with stride. Plus you get to hang out with me, what isn't to love?" Percy was smiling, now aware of the twins following them.
Ron looked confused, wondering why Harry was telling him this. Harry knew he would figure it out soon, and so he sat back and let him.
Tom spoke up, "It never was clear. From my inner circle, three. Karkoden, Zachariah and a little girl named Thea. She was Pansy's big sister, four when she went missing. Sadly, we found her body about six months after fact."
"You don't know anything, get out!" Still Severus refused to budge, and Harry reached for his wand, pointing it at his professor.
"Well, write something along the lines of 'The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened.' on the wall in her blood."
Charlie and Bill were nearby, and Harry nodded. The twins were quite excited, but before they knew it, they were in a private court room, away from them.
"Nev, can I call you that?" At a nod of confirmation, he continued, "Trevor is a toad and he really needs a good life outside with lots of space. I'm sure he loves you, but being handled and indoors must be making him sad."
Draco looked confused and the three adults shared a wary look. Harry sniggered, "Alright Draco, we have to get going. Professor Snape has to go to lunch soon and Dumbledore might get wing of your parents magical signature soon so they have to go." He said rather clearly, and Lucius agreed. "Yes, you'll be okay, wont you Draco? I could just pull you out if you'd like-" He started, but was shortly cut off, by his wife, "No you cant Lucius. The poor boy will go no sense of self if you continue to coddle him. Let him be a child, he isn't your baby anymore." And Lucius slumped, "Whatever." He muttered and hugged his son to his chest, before handing him to his friend and flooing away with his wife.
Harry turned his head to the window and said, "Don't do dark arts, kids!" He then stuck his thumbs up and turned back to Tom, a bored expression on his face. Tom scoffed, "You're so muggle." And Harry nodded, "I know dear. Now, what are we doing?" He drawled, leaning back in his chair, "Well, we know where the stone is, but a rather large amount of traps are being set. Baring in mind a two year old could pass them, but I need to know what spells Dumbledore has placed on it. Quirrels magic is too weak to do that level of spell casting, and while I could, I cant risk Dumbledore getting my magical signature. Plus, using that amount of magic when I'm not whole could be dangerous."
"I will have contacted your parents by this afternoon, I will run by with the dates after dinner. Good day children."
"No I didn't tell him your names - Oh! Harry has like weird magic. He like, knows everything about you by just looking at you for thirty seconds." Draco explained messily, nuzzling into his fathers robes. "Legilimens at such a young age?" Lucius asked, but this time Severus responded. "No, he knows every inch of my life more or less and I felt not one prod at my shields." He said, and Harry nearly laughed as all four of them looked at him with bewildered looks, "Its.. its a muggle thing." He sniggered. This talent he had, (he called this the Sherlock Holmes talent) he had since he could remember. This was something that bewildered Tom, and had dubbed him a rare type of Seer.
Hagrid bought Harry a snowy owl as a birthday present and he had encountered Draco Malfoy, how wonderful. He went to the Apothecary to get his potions ingredients, got his robes, books and finally his wand. The experience had been... one of a kind.
With the newfound tragedy it was easy for Harry to sneak around the school. He shone his torch down the trap door, eventually, to see that it was in fact devils snare. He hadn't gone down, just in case there was no way out. It did look rather deep.
After Harry and Neville had pulled away from the others, they found a secluded alcove away from the other students.
"Harry! There you are. Come on, I've got to keep an eye one you. Let's go." Percy grabbed his hand, twisting on his heel and walking back in the direction he came.
T: Yes, child. You may find she wants to coddle you- she could never have children, no matter what Narcissa tried. She did have one child, a little boy. Probably around the same time you were born, actually. I can't remember exactly. A little boy with a head full of crazy Black hair at only a day old. Something happened, though. The aurors raided our base, we didn't know how they found us. Bellatrix was detained, and we had to break her from their clutches, but her poor baby was never seen again.
Harry made his way back to Snape's office and knocked before walking in an seeing the feared look on Draco's face, he smiled politely and sat down in his previously occupied seat. "That didn't take long." Draco mused before turning to his smirking friend, "Why are you smirking? What did you do?" Draco said, suddenly concerned. Harry chuckles, "That's for me to know and your parents and Professor Snape to find out. In a few months." And he stared at his left forearm, as if checking an invisible watch.
A small voice in his head said, and Harry schooled his features. He felt his diary vibrating madly in his pocket, and could feel Quirrel-Toms anxiety and confusion through the door.
Karkoden Thomas Black shone in bright green light, a shining line if white leading to the Name Bellatrix Black, in the same white. Her family tree was glowing beneath her, faded.
He had also acquired himself a snake. She was very beautiful, midnight scales with flecks of blue and purple. She was venomous, Harry knew that. She said her previous owner only wished too breed her so she bit him, he wasn't a speaker after all.
The boy was deflated, he rather enjoyed reading when he got the chance. The book had a name on the back he noticed; Tom Marvolo Riddle. However what he hadn't noticed was that he'd pulled on the small cupboard light, that seemed to get brighter the more intrigued he got by the book, it was almost like a normal lightbulb now.
"I care for you too." He replied, the sound muffled as his face was now moved into the robes of the other.
"Yeah. Your guys mum is going on trial with Dumbledore in a few days, and dad has built a case against her, so he think she'll be going away for a very long time. Ginny wants to be adopted by us if that happens. So she'd be both our sister! And they said you could be adopted too, but it is up to you."
Draco and Karkoden both grabbed on to Percy and walked towards the dungeons, presumably to talk about their time at Malfoy Manor.
"Well, once Percy gets here, I plan on giving her a diagnostic scan, I can't do it with her on my lap. They Severus I'll need your help if anything is severe, but she shows signs of abuse. I'll need to talk to Kode as well, see if he was subjected to it as well or just Ginny." Narcissa finished, "Actually, do you have a quick salve for me to put on her ear? I don't want it to get infected."
"Hi guys!" He grinned, "this is my new friend Neville, and his toad Trevor. Neville, you might know Percy, but this is Karkoden and Draco. They're my other friends."
He was still in pain from his beating a few days ago, but hid it well. He had a barely noticeable limp and his grimace was hidden so well you couldn't tell it was there.
Harry nodded, "Right, so-" He was quickly pulled from his mind, a warm wetness pressing to his thigh. He sighed down at Draco, shaking him awake. He awoke in an older headspace and shuffled along to the bathroom with a bright red face, muttering apologies as Harry cleaned his bed.
The boys were going to go to class today so after a spot of breakfast they found their way to the defence classroom. Quirrels stutter was giving Harry a headache and Draco was struggling to keep up with what he was saying.
"Miss Ginny Molly Weasley, please come to the stand. You may also bring someone for comfort, not permitted to talk."
He was sat against the stairs, he'd left his snake, (who he had named Bellona, with the help of Tom, he explained Bellona was a Goddess of war. And the name Bell means beautiful, thus giving the snake the name. She had a tongue for pain and war, yet was beautiful, it only fit.) and the diary in his cupboard for the day.
Voldemorts eyes seemed ever redder, and glazed over. "McGonagall. Get rid of her, and I'll be fulfilled. I'll even help you with things he won't."
Harry shook his head, he had other things to do for now. He turned his attention back to his newfound lover boy.
Inside the darkness, was a man chained to a chair. He was dashingly handsome, with slightly curled locks of chocolate brown hair and blazing red eyes, a sadistic smile on his face. He was gaunt, skinny and sweaty. His clothes hung loosely and his feet were bare. Despite this, Harry found himself weak at the knees.
Harry's plan was officially in action, "Wh-who's there?" He was pleased with how his voice sounded; small, pleading and scared.
The two older boys got to pick, not that Harry cared. They went everywhere when Dudley suddenly goes, "Mummy, daddy, I want to see the snakes! Now!" And with a few strange glances, the five made their way to the reptilian area of the zoo, much to Harry's delight.
"He hasn't hit me bad for years, though. Well, there was a couple times, but he generally stopped when I was bout eight. There was a few times, but nothing too severe. My aunt stopped talking to me when I was eight, too. She can't stand to look at me."
Harry had sent the letter off three weeks ago, and Lucius had come almost immediately. He got all the information, and sorted it in a way as to not make it look like it came directly from the dark lord. He soon went and spoke to the minister, who decided it would be looked forther into before accusing the Weasleys of anything.
Tom was ecstatic to teach him, yet nervous. He hadn't wanted the boy to become overrun with power like he himself had. But he always put that down to the fact he never had a tutor, Harry did.
Harry shook his head, "No sir, we were given this book on our list." He pulled out a pristine book, a little bit smaller than the dusty one in front of him.
Everyone sat with bated breaths as the blood soaked into the parchment, but soon the truth came forth.
"Why, of course. She is around here somewhere. It is safe to look." The snake sounded almost posh, and Harry almost asked if Tom gave him etiquette lessons.
After a small conversation with Tom, the plans were changed. Instead of Harry and Draco being in the hall when Quirrel ran in to moan about the troll - which was the original plan - Harry would deposit Draco at the dorms and run in with Quirrel. The plan was practically foolproof. Draco agreed with it a bit more anyway, once he was told he could have ice cream in bed.
"Of course. Do you know who I am?" The boy couldn't help asking; according to his father, this little boy should be spewing insults and cursing his name.
"I have always been here, chipping at your mind. I was never strong, I would never be able to do anything unless you let me. I can change your thoughts, here and there. I can persuade you when you're in a bad mood. But I have little control over much."
When Harry gently slipped his hand into Draco's, he was met with a smile and a slight squeeze from the other. He took this as a positive and laced their fingers.
A week had passed, and Neville was accepted into the group rather quickly. The Malfoys had agreed to start the cleansing after they had some more proof, but with the Longbottoms insane, it would be a bit harder.
D: That sounds funny. And it doesnt surprise me much either. But I have a question, if you dont mind?
Severus sat beside him, "I won't ask questions, I'd just like to give you a look over, see of I can reduce any scarring," he spoke quietly, and Harry nodded.
"Until I need to no longer." Harry replied, and pulled Draco into a hug. "I'm sorry for upsetting you so," he kissed Draco's head,
Quirrel-Tom stood and joined him, redressing the turban. The two made their way to the third floor corridor. Harry opened the door with a flick of his wrist, earning an impressed smile from his mentor, who was currently fronting. The red eyes were a giveaway.
When he was looking up a ginger boy opened the door, "Excuse me? Can I sit here?" Harry wanted the world to swallow him whole. He groaned, "Sure, but sit over there, my snake wont appreciate being sat on." He motioned lazily at the galaxy themed snake by his book he was reading.
After reaching the dorm, and getting himself and Draco into pyjamas, the two sat cuddled on Harry's bed, with Mr. Teddy squished between them. It was calm, and quiet, and soon enough Draco was sleeping, again.
Draco sat with his mouth agape, "That book is the dark lord?" He gasped, voice rising to a higher pitch. "Yeah, do you want to talk to him?" The pale boy nodded dumbly, his eyes glistening in the light that reflected through the lake. Harry opened the book rather quickly and grabbed his quill,
Fluffy was there, drooling. The two looked for clues, well, after they got over their shock. Harry was in awe of the oversized dog with three heads for a little while longer. Once Tom spotted the trap door the dog awoke.
Harry nodded, almost. "Death Eaters have specific times for having children. All married death eaters that could were due to have a baby in 1980. They figured this out, and realised you would be insanely strong just because of your mother, and who they assumed to be your father. They were smart. They didn't know who your godparents were if you had any, but they knew if they finally imprisoned all the death eaters, Lucius Malfoy would get away, and you'd go to live with them. They couldn't risk it, so they took you from your family."
"You grew up in a muggle area, and still own the house there however you refuse to reside there and prefer to stay at Hogwarts. When you were eight, you met a girl, a muggleborn witch, she was-" Harry stopped for a second, before shaking his head and continuing, "She was eventually sorted into Gryffindor when you attended Hogwarts. Going back to you, you didn't have a pleasant home life and thus enjoyed being outside and trying to make potions with whatever was laying around. You were quite fond of the park, and had a den set up under the slide so you could stargaze with your friend. When you went to Hogwarts, you were bullied, and because they were precious Gryffindors, they were never punished. Leaving you to wallow in your self pity, with no one to help beside your friend." Harry coughed lightly, "I think I'm going to stop there, professor. It might make me cry." Snape nodded in understanding and Harry laughed sadly, standing up and stretching, casting a wandless tempus.
He looked like he was having an argument with himself, and Severus was a little worried. Before he could utter his concern, though, Harry snapped his head up to him, "I'm fine professor. Let's continue shopping."
Harry, who had stayed adamantly quiet, smiled and pulled the smaller of the two into his chest. "Thank you for explaining, Draco. You can be small again, if you'd like. I apologize for pulling you from your headspace."
"You say that Tom, but how much has he been learning from the small occupant in his mind?" Severus asked, sitting straighter.
Harry woke up, at six am sharp, to a wetness pressed against his thigh. He simply sat up, and gently shook Draco awake so he could get him into the shower, ready for the day. He called for a house else to sort the bed, and found a pouting Draco on the bathroom floor still in his wet pyjamas. Harry stripped both of them and then got into the shower himself, leaving a naked Draco on the bathroom floor.
As soon as they were located, the four were going to head back to the castle, however Harry did notice a little chubby blonde boy, looking slightly lost.
After stepping up, he spoke quickly, "I don't particularly know what allegations are being made against my mother. She always seemed perfect to me." His voice was full of confusion, and Molly half heartedly smiled at him. He was off the stand as quick as he was on.
Harry was shaking, "How are you so calm? These are innocent children, who have been murdered by a man pretending to do the right thing!"
Tom was ultimately amazed at how fast the boy could learn, he was talking, or at least writing, like a proper fully formed pureblood should.  More advanced for his age, and from what the boy described he had a perfect blank mask, and he had near no fears. He learnt how to control his emotions and he, apparently, had a glare that could send shivers down anyone's back.
He seemed to be nervous, and looked down, "Well uh, me and George always got everything together, so.. so she'd yell, and hit us, and stuff," he side eyed his mother, who was struggling against her restraints and looked to be yelling. "Like Perce said, we thought we were taking physical abuse for Ron and Ginny. Oh uh, Karkoden. Sorry. And she liked throwing things, especially knives. Not sharp ones, but it was still pretty terrifying."
Harry was eleven now, and would be leaving for Hogwarts in a matter of days. Tom was disgusted by Hagrids entrance, and due to Hagrid, Harry had had a terrible punishment. That whipping and carving of the skin was the first punishment since he was seven to make him shed a tear.
Ron was getting mildly upset, "I suppose. Makes sense as to why they don't live me as much as everyone else. Why do you care, anyway?"
"What's the plan, Voldy?" He asked, strutting into the black cloud. The man looked even more sickly.
He was on his way back to the tower with Draco now, as Snape had dismissed the class to clean up the mess.
Draco, soon enough, was told by Harry to stop paying attention because it was stressing him out so. Harry handed Draco a few sheets of plain paper and a box of crayons, while he took notes for the both of them.
Christmas had been uneventful. He only got Draco a present, but had left it at Hogwarts. A necklace holding an emerald. It was simple.
Koden nodded, and Harry patted his knee, "Do you want me to come up?" And at his friends quick nod, they both walked up towards the stand, Harry standing as proud as the three adults previous.
Harry bit his lip, when he came across an equation he couldn't answer, "The lizard saliva would cancel out the poppy seeds do the calming draught would have no effects at all, leading the consumer into a state of panic, unless... unless you added root of elder, but it would stop it barely, and the consumer would still be in a state of unsure panic, possibly boiling in a golden cauldron but that could counteract the wild mushrooms, turning the entire potion into a deadly poison." Harry mumbled to himself, growing more frustrated as he went. The other two looked at his strange,
Both children squeaked, but quickly settled, "I'm Ron, Ron Weasley." The ginger boy said, rubbing the dirt that Hermione had pointed out from his nose. "Pleasure." The darker haired child mused, reading his personal potions text. "Why are you reading? We aren't at school yet." The boy asked, "Knowledge is power, and silence is gold. Now shut up and leave me alone." He replied dryly, flipping the page. The boy snorted as Hermione pulled out a book, too, and the ginger boy huffed, crossing his arms.
Once they were far enough away from  the hall, Tom room control again. "Severus, we ought to take Harry to your rooms. I have some questions." He hissed, and Harry silently sobbed.
Narcissa had spoiled Ginny, excited to have a little girl, even if it was temporarily. The girl had clearly never had the best of things, and Narcissa decided she deserved it.
All he was met with was a nod and kiss on his head, "Thank you for trusting me. I promise to never let anything happen to you, my sweet."
Once he was rounded a corner and gone, Severus turned his attention back to the small blonde boy now clutching his robe, and pulled him into his office.
In fact, very mad. But the boy simply told him it was fine and that he was tired. So he closed the diary and went to sleep. Tom was upset, however the boy apologized for it in the morning and all was well.
Harry nodded at the mirror, hoping Voldemort would be able to see. Harry washed his hands, before pulling his wand, "Mundut Tactus," he casted over the room, and was happy with his work. He casted it over himself, before leaving, sneaking back to his dorm. He left the sewage grate open on purpose.
The man laughed, "I am trapped here, and you are having a large effect on me. I was weak and almost dead for many years, curled up almost as a foetus. I sent out bad signals as much as I could, and it's almost as it some of the bad trapped in this fraction of soul, is now part of your soul, not mine. I was worse than he told you when I had my own body."
Severus was all too glad to feed them. Percy didn't know everything, but he did know that Severus was working in league with Voldemort, and he thought that Harry contact with him too.
"Well, she'd throw things, like everyone else said. She liked hitting the side of my face with her spoon, or scratching me. Sometimes she'd pinch me until I bled."
Once Harry was settled in his own bed, practically asleep, he felt slight movement around his feet. He peeked up, to see Belladonna.
Harry simply stood up, and dragged Draco into the bathroom to go toilet and brush his teeth before tucking him in. Draco spent the next two hours getting out of bed, and going over to Harry's bed, just to be out back in his own bed.
Harry straightened his back at that, as the tall and mysterious man stepped up, eyeing all the students and stopping on Harry. He quickly came back to himself, "Welcome to Slytherin. I do no longer have a magnificent speech, as over the years, the prefects have taken the most important bits and made a rather short speech, which has been graciously passed down. I am open to discussion, if any of you have any worries or woes, do not be afraid to come to me. I may needlessly say, none of the other professors would be willing to help, they never have before this point." He said, and Harry's hand shot up, and Snape raised a brow.
He ran his fingers over a few jumpers, popping them into his basket. They were a variety of colours, mostly light. Considering Harry's other clothing, all dark, he couldn't help but think they weren't for the boy.
Harry kissed the side of his head, "Anything for you, my sweet. Now," Harry reached across to the bedside table where Draco's dummy was, and handed it to him. "Why don't you sit here, hm? So I can talk to Severus."
Harry was eight now. Tom was eager to meet him, the boy had only grown stronger and was itching to get his wand, to hurt everyone that wronged him. Besides Tom of course, because he helped more than harmed him.
Everyone stilled, and Draco continued. "Hermione Granger? That was him. I knew immediately, but I kept quite. I eventually let my anger bubble over, and demanded a response. He usually replied with 'motives' which is why that was our codeword," Draco sat on the floor, Harry sliding down beside him,
With Draco and the rest of the students around him sufficiently distracted, Harry pulled out the diary and began talking to Tom.
T: No, and I would like you to work with Quirrel to bring me back. Don't worry, I will still be me. This is my strongest and most human form, therefore I will bring this one back and absorb the others. I am tired of living a half life.
After that was done they arrived at their lesson, taking a seat at the back. Draco was asleep within five minutes and Harry got tired of waking him just for him to fall back asleep.
Harry re-entered with the snake, and eye brows were raised. "This is Belladonna, she slithers off most of the time. She says hello."
Draco had gone home with his parents for Christmas, and so Harry was the last Slytherin left in Hogwarts. He spent most of his time following Percy around, and despite there only five students left in the school, Percy still had to do his prefect rounds. One Ravenclaw student and the twins were all he was really looking out for, as Harry usually completed the rounds with him.
They ate a decent meal, and Draco got talking to his friends. He told that he was severely homesick, to explain his childish behaviour. They bought it.
Harry had done some thinking. He had overreacted, and really ought to say sorry, but was too prideful. Instead, he took off to find Percy. The students were due back soon, in a week's time.
After Harry had stopped crying, and had lessened his hold on Draco, the boy sat up, "'Mon, you need naptime," the smaller boy spoke behind his dummy, and Harry simply nodded, both getting up. Draco lead Harry to a bed, and sort of shoved him on. Harry flopped, and soon he had a blanket, Mr. Teddy and Straw placed around him, Draco cautiously petting his head.
Severus nodded, "The only rule is we must go on the trip before the other students return. I must request that we go sooner rather than later."
"I'd gathered as much. And yes, you can always visit. Now, is that why you're currently here?" He bounced Draco, and the small boy kicked his legs.
When their uneventful knock landed on the door, and Dudley rushed to open it, Harry felt a sudden urge to let his magic loose, so he did. It enclosed the whole house soon enough and everyone stood stock still, looking around for this unmanageable source.
"What did you do to her?" Molly screeched, and Narcissa stared at her husband for help, right as Molly reached out to slap Narcissa.
"I will collect you at ten in the morning. Have a good evening Mr. Evans, I shall see you at dinner."
Harry, too tired to fight with obnoxious Gryffindors, shoved past them and continued down the hall. An annoyed, "Oi! Watch where you're going mate!" Was yelled after them but Harry honestly didn't care.
"I know sweetheart," Severus swung open his office door, and made quick work of making his way to Draco's dorm.
"It's fine. I knew you weren't light, I knew what I was getting myself into." He mumbled, gripping onto Harry.
Harry pulled out the strange book, standing on his knees as it was less painful. He opened the front cover and was tracing the date in the corner he hadn't noticed, "Mus' be a diary then," he guessed quietly, his voice shaking unevenly. Slowly, one by one, his tears cascaded down his already tear stained cheeks and onto the old paper.
"Well, that will happen when you go around murdering people, Harry. Now come along, let's go to the library yes? Severus has ordered me to watch you, and Lucius is working with the ministry to have me be your, ah, guard if you will. Not that any of us think you need it." He chuckled, and Harry nodded.
Once the two boys were ready they both sat in the common room, Draco slightly cuddled into Harry's side. Other students were staring, and when Professor Snape came in to check all was in order he raised an eyebrow, but quickly dismissed it when he saw Harry reading a potions text.
He can't take me away, I promise. You're stuck with me forever. You have to do as I say. Give me some magic in case I need to step in.
The blonde boy let Harry put his tie on as he kicked his feet, humming happily. Harry didn't force his jumper or robe on him and put his shoes on, handing Draco a comb so Harry himself could put his shoes on and tuck his shirt back in.
"I think he was exaggerating some, he realised he fucked up and back tracked. Tom, that part of his mind was weak. As you said, it feels dead. There is no way it could of possessed Harry to murdering someone and leaving that message on the window, in her blood." Severus pointed out, and Tom nodded.
Harry nodded, "You could kill with with a flick, I know. But Quirrel can't, and I rather think I could beat him, while both using your mind."
Harry grabbed an apple and ate the entire thing greedily, he had to eat the core also, hide the residue. Next was a cheese slice, before he couldn't stomach anymore. When he told Tom of this, he was quite mad.
Draco looked up, "I don't know what to do." His lip quivered, "What did you say about wetting the bed, Draco?" Harry asked, and the boy in question flushed bright pink, "I still wet the bed, most nights." He squeaked quietly, looking down, more tears welling up. "Hey, its okay. How about, I set my alarm for six, then I can get you up and the elves will deal with your clothes and the sheets, you have a shower. Then nobody will know. But you wont get much sleep tonight."  Draco nodded solemnly. "Okay, but I still want my dadd- I mean father, and Mr. Teddy." He mumbled the last part, flushing at his mistake.
Harry's heart ached a little at that, because he knew the truth. Your real mother would treat you like the king of the earth.
Harry was ten now, and had less than a year to get away from this prison. He had mastered the levitating spell, wordlessly. It wasn't even wobbly anymore.
Harry pulled his shirt off just as he was in front of the mirror, not taking much notice. He happened to glance at himself, and something peeking above his trouser line caught his eye. None of his scars bothered him, besides this one. Well, possibly the one on his forehead, but not in the same way this one did.
Harry grinned, "'Course, sir!" As he sped off into the shop, Severus dawdling behind. He got a few odd looks, but otherwise no one really cared. Harry asked his opinions on things, but he didn't have much input.
The ghost looked confused and picked up an old book that looked like it hadn't been opened in at least thirty years. "We are." He spoke a bit clearer and floated over to Harry to put the book down on the table.
In the morning he woke up with an aching back, but the half giant who Harry held large feelings of dislike for, was cheery and grabbed his coat, turning to leave. Harry was shocked awake by the cold air hitting his body and the loud voice asking for him to follow. Well, demanding more like.
Tell him about me if he corners you. Make it dramatic and sad. Make him feel bad for you, like you're a victim. Do not let him know you did it off your own will.
"Well, you have me there. It was worth a try. No, it's not. But he did play a big part of it. Having an insane mass chipping at my mind does have it's affects, you know? Anyway, I know more than even you remember Tom, which makes me a double threat." He gave a cheeky grin, splaying his legs out.
The blonde nodded excitedly, and Harry leant down and grabbed one, with a pack of crayons, from under his bed. A quick charm later, and the book was floating in front of Draco's face. The charm was modified so Draco could turn the pages and draw in the book without accidentally pushing it away from himself.
Harry didn't think he could become any redder, "No! How- how would that even work? We're both blokes."
Harry was too close to tears, his eyes 'leaked' as he was jolted forward, his uncle obviously had enough, "Now you, boy, will stay in here until I unlock the door. You wont be leaving. No meals tomorrow, and extra chores on Monday." The whale of a man grumbled, practically throwing Harrys small frame into the confides of his cupboard.
Harry let him explore for a moment, before he noticed his fingers reaching for the closed packet of dummies. "Do you want one, sweetheart?"
Ron sobbed, and sobbed. It was too much. He had a family that loved him. He couldn't care less if they were death eaters or not.
While Severus was talking to Tom, Harry decided to spend some time with Draco. The little boy was all to happy to see his best friend approaching.
He was disgusted with himself, and had explained how he felt to Tom, angry tears burning his cheeks as they ran down his face. His hand was shaking,
He stuck his thumb in his mouth, and once they had gotten back to their dorms Harry handed Draco crayons and some parchment. The crayons took awhile to transfigure, but Harry knew he needed to up his skill anyway. So with some pointers from Tom, he started transfiguring different things. Mostly for Draco, as they would be most practical.
T: Yes, I believe so. We all thought your mother would be out of action for months after your birth and would want to stay with you, but with the help of my dear Severus she was up and running within a weeks time, it was in fact your father who stayed behind and looked after you. He brought you to a few meetings, and your mother dubbed it an annual time for everyone to play pass the baby. It was rather amusing. Although I must say Lucius looked more tired than the rest of us and we were running around setting villages on fire and such.
Ron was finished soon, and the two were walking out the hall, shoulder to shoulder. "So, not to be rude or nothin' cause I'm dead pleased, but why do you want to be my friend?"
Severus couldn't help but smile a little bit as he noticed the boys excitement, the little excited bounce he did as they entered the bank.
Harry was happy to hear that they got along, though. Karkoden was happy to help the younger two, and rather enjoyed playing the big brother role.
"She's lying! She obviously faked it! Charmed the knives!" The woman was shrilly screaming, and both children were crying at the commotion. Narcissa worked on calming them both, while Dumbledore and the minister were defusing the situation.
"Harry," Severus realised this was a lot worse than what he was prepared for, "I need to look at your scars. If you relatives-"
He slumped against a wall, his eyes half lidded, tired with the energy it took to stay inside his mind. Suddenly, he caught movement out the corner of his vision, in the deepest corner of his room, and his mind. He always ignored it. It never seemed like anything; just emptiness. But now, it seemed very interesting.
Harry was overcome with curiosity, and stepped in, cringing at the water splashing over his shoes. He trudged on downwards, further into the tunnel.
"Then I met you. I had never felt safe around anyone else while being small, and then you were there, and suddenly I was small in front of the entirety of Hogwarts." He finished with his head in his knees, that had been pulled up to his chest somewhere through his explanation.
"I was thinking Mother Care, actually- Don't look at me like that!" Harry was immediately flustered at the mans raised eyebrow,
Harry shook his head, "There was a few times, when he was overly angry. My cousin never stopped, but all they really did was kick me, and cause bruising. He never caused me severe pain." Harry stiffened slightly, "Besides, right after Hagrid took me to Diagon Ally. He was really angry after that."
He avoided Filch, and within half an hour he was gently knocking on Quirrels door. It was opened, and he was welcomed inside. The turban fell and Harry was left face to face with his so called father.
With everyone filing out to rejoin in half an hour, Percy stood hugging Lucius. It was a sight to see, and Lucius wouldn't usually show such a display of affection in public, but the boy clearly needed it.
Many of the students were crying, even a few of the Slytherin's. Harry really did wish that he could pretend he didn't care, but Draco was one crying.
They soon entered a shop, and both relaxed, "I thought you were supposed to be brave?" The professor said, a small smirk on his face, showing he was only poking fun.
"There is no dark and light, Draco. The light is just as evil as us, but in different ways. I personally would benefit more from the dark side, and I despise the light side because of what Dumbledore did to Tom and me. There is murderers on both sides. At least all of my killings have a motive."
"Oh no. He is chained up in here," Harry tapped the side of his head, "but he talks. I dream of things, that only this half knows, meaning you have forgotten them. For instance, I know wjere your spell book is. Do you, Tom?"
"The first witness statement please, Mrs Narcissa Malfoy, nee Black, step down to the witness stand."
"I'm assuming Bill and Charlie are your older brothers?" At that Percy nodded, "They'd have to be interviewed first, made sure they weren't in on whatever your parents had going. Now, Karkoden as well, did your mother or father, ever hit you, berate you or purposefully make you feel unworthy?"
"Yes. Please do not kill me. Tom has asked me to visit you, and I also am on a quest to find my young snake, Belladonna."
"I'm not sure how to explain it, really." He started, "When I was younger, something awful happened. And since then, as I've grown, I found myself slipping to a younger age, in my mind, only sometimes. From before it happened. I originally went to father about it, and he thought it was adorable. He encouraged it."
The voice was almost welcomed, and Harry escaped into his mind, the black smoke like substance in the corner clearer. He walked through, and saw Tom sitting, still chained in his chair.
"How could muggles know such magic that not even we know of?" Narcissa asked, "Well you see, its not magic. Its a very high level of logic. And you have to be very smart to acquire the gift. Many people are born with it, but few learn how to control it. And the few that do control it, hide this gift, as they are tended to be used." Harry explained as simply as he could. The two Malfoys nodded, and Snape shook his head. "You really are extraordinary, aren't you?" Snape chuckled, sitting up.
After a few seconds of wringing his hands, the minister spoke, "Take your time, Mister Weasley. If you would like to have a small tea break, that will be amendable."
Harry felt panic rising in his throat, when he saw Draco's plan devising above his head. Harry was glad he could trust Draco.
Lucius scoffed, "Honestly dear, I do know how to look after children." She gave him a side eye, before leaving. Harry burst out laughing, clutching his stomach. Severus also smiled. He had turned down the offer of ice cream, but now he was almost regretting it.
The four adults continued their conversation, and little did they know two boys had been listening in.
Ron's face lit up, "Course! I'm just gonna finish my breakfast." Harry nodded, waiting for his newfound friend to finish eating. He could feel Dumbledores pleasure at the head table, and he couldn't help but sneer to himself.
Harry was quite amazed at how the magical court differed from the muggle. Instead of all the intricate rules and regulations, with lawyers, it was simply listen to the evidence and vote, and check the memories if need be. Of course, only an adults memory's could be tested, which could make this a tad harder, although everyone was hoping Charlie or Bill would step up and offer memories if the situation turns sour.
Harry did so, and Draco looked at him expectantly, "Go on kid, he's waiting." Draco took the quill from Harry and began to write.
"Well, I don't fancy killing Percy or his brothers. The Ravenclaw student? Although I feel like that would extend the break. I don't feel like he deserves it, either." Harry sat down on the floor, thinking things over.
"Sort of," he murmured, "I call it logic, Sherlock Holmes logic, but really its magic. If I lock onto anything, really, that had recent contact with a living magical being I can read parts of their mind or past. Mind shields or not. I call it Muggle because reading Sherlock helped me understand it, and get a better grasp of it because you were clearly useless on the aspect. Also it protects me, so people don't hunt me because I know some form of mind magic."
"I'm here to help you." Severus could already tell this situation was going to turn sour, but still, he kept his voice soft, but stern.
The morning came quickly, Harry had a shower and got Draco situated. Luckily he was in an older headspace so after they finished lunch Draco wandered back to the dorms and Harry left with Severus.
The boy nodded, "So, what, we just go and check it out?" To which he receives and sort of backwards nod. He jumps up, "Alright then, let's go. Filch is on the seventh floor currently."
Draco explained he had a nightmare and got scared when he couldn't find Harry after a lot of coercion. Harry held him, and promised he wouldn't go anywhere without telling Draco first again. Soon they both nodded off to sleep, Draco with his thumb bobbing happily in his mouth.
"I care for you a lot, Draco." He spoke, his voice low. Mentioned boy smiled; he brushed his hair out of his face to leaned up and kiss Harry's Jaw.
Karkoden turned to where he was looking, after giving Percy a hug, "Oh! That's Neville. He's the other boy you mentioned, remember?"
Ron shrugged to that, "Oh it's alright. My mum does that too. Pisses me off. It always seems like she targets me, you know?"
His cupboard door was open and his uncle reached in and grabbed him, dragging him by his aching arm, banging his head on the door frame on his way out, "Owwie!" The small boy whimpered, his eyes shooting open. He could hardly see his uncles face in the pitch blackness of the hallway, but Harry knew he was angry, very, very angry. And of course it was Harry's fault, it always was.
Harry sighed and looked between the little boy on his lap and the concerned professor at the foot of his bed, "Yes, I'll let Severus help me, love."
However, he found he was unable to grasp it now he was awake. He glared at his sleeping snake, and grabbed his diary, muttering a quick lumos.
First, of course, he went down to the common area. He located the mentioned snakes, hissing to them, "Can you tell me of professor McGonagalls route, for tonight? If she goes anywhere with no windows, or frail windows, and at what time?"
"You aren't a normal Wizard. Bellatrix couldn't have children. Lady Magic granted her with a single child, you. You are incredibly strong. You are perhaps the only direct link from lady Magic since Merlin."
Severus sighed, "I will talk with professor Dumbledore. You may need permission from your guardians, and will need to be escorted."
He popped it into Draco's mouth, and cuddled him. "Now, I have some other things in my bag. You don't have to wear them if you don't want to, but I think they could help you. Do you want to see them?"
"Let's get you changed, hm?" Draco nodded, quickly shuffling over and laying on his bed. Harry laughed and made quick work of getting Draco dry, waving his complex cleaning charm over the wet garment. Harry didn't trust the house elves, and thus was very adept at cleaning charms. He could go his entire life without using any cleaning product and still be the cleanest child in Hogwarts.
Charlie was next, of course, with a similar instruction. He stood slightly nervous, "I was aware our mother was not the nicest at the best of times, but I was never subjected to any form of physical abuse. I am willing to supply memories of verbal abuse, and the ways she spoke about Ro-" he coughed a little, before continuing, "Pardon me, Karkoden." With a nod, he left the stand.
A week had passed and the students were finally coming back to Hogwarts, so Percy had walked Harry down to where the carriages were unboarding, to meet Draco and Kode.
Harry, thinking quick, grabbed his wand and shot up the only protection spell he could remember over the Slytherin side of the class; praying it worked.
Harry had explained what was happening today to Draco once he had woken up 'small'. He explained that Draco had to stay with the Slytherins, but Harry had to leave. Draco pitched a fit, and a huge one.
Percy nodded, following along, "Now, Karkoden will come into my and Lucius' care as I am his biological aunt, but is there anywhere you, Ginny and your other brothers can go?"
"I believe you call me... Tom? Yes, that is my name. Although I do have a feeling you also call me something beginning with a Q. The lines a bit messed up."
He looked around, the bones mostly that of small creatures. Rounding a corner, he spotted a rather large snake skin. He was frozen in fear, "Belladonna really wasn't kidding." He whispered, stepping forward.
H: No, and the boys sound like the people at my school. Did the people who were meant to look after you mean as well, like they never believed you? And I don't understand what you mean, sorry.
"Ginny!" She reached for the girls arm, but she let out a scream. Narcissa spun up, the little girl in her arms, one arm under her legs and the other on the back of her head.
"Draco, love? I have something for you." The bright sparkling eyes looked up at him, and when he showed the dummy he broke out in a grin, his thumb dropping.
Nothing seemed out of place; nasty memories stored in locked jars and happier ones in book form on a shelf. He paced around, pieces of his life sorted about the room.
Uproar was the initial reaction, after Quirrel fainted (with Harry checking his pulse and such). Once Dumbledore had calmed everyone and sent the teachers on their way to the dungeons, Harry and Quirrel escaped to Fluffys room, to do more investigating.
Snape looked slightly taken aback, and cautiously replied, "First off, you are most welcome, second, I do not think there is. And thirdly, how could you tell that so simply? None of the others were aware, I wasn't even aware there was three muggleborns." He asked, "I am a great observer professor. You have to be when you live with my family. Always think ten steps ahead, just to make sure you aren't hit over the head with a frying pan or something." He shrugged, "I suppose figuring people out came along with that, to see if I should avoid them or not. I have figured nearly everyone out standing in this very room." He said, almost as if it was nothing, and people were gaping.
Here little Harry sat, tears staining his cheeks. He was only five, but his uncle had giving him a beating a grown man would complain about. But Harry knew if he started complaining from the safe, dark confides of his small cupboard under the stairs his uncle would come and grab him by his hair for round two. So he stayed quiet, silent sobs that shook his entire being barely escaping him.
"I wouldn't do that, professor." His eyes were dark, and Severus was a little intimidated. He was sure he'd seen that look before, but not on the likes of Lily. On James perhaps? But no, it was too dark even for that toerag.
Ron agreed, "It's like that with me too, but with all of my siblings. It's almost like I'm the child they didn't want."
She often did, disappearing for weeks at a time. They had agreed that she would stay at Hogwarts over the summer, as she was quite safe here.
T: Since thirty seconds ago, now sleep. I have thinking to do. Coming back to full health - with a body - may be easier than expected.
"When can I see daddy again?" Draco piped up, and Harry turned to him, "I'm not sure dear, I'll talk to professor Snape and see, okay?"
T: We assumed they taken him and had him killed, but Bellatrix knew he wasn't. When a special baby is born, a baby who was born under unseen circumstances for instance, they have a bond, a magical bond. Bellatrix could not have a baby. Her eggs were all infertile, there was no cure, Muggle or magical. She was so distraught that, we believe, Lady Magic gifted her a child, because one day there was a bump. We were overjoyed, and while the pregnancy was sickly, we were happy to bring another baby into the world. He was her pride and joy and they took him.
"Try me, old man." Harry snarled, getting up. He was twitching at the fact that he couldn't see Tom's thoughts.
After getting over his shock, the professor led the student out with card and galleon pouch in hand.
Harry sighed softly before looking up at four worried faces, "I have business to attend to, but I shall be back soon." He says politely, bowing and turning for the door, when Draco said, his voice concerned, "Will you be safe?" And without looking back Harry drawled with a smirk, "Safe? What does that mean?" And he whisked out the door, following the weak link that was Tom Riddle's magic to Quirrels classroom.
Tom shoved Harry down on the sofa, "What the fuck did you do?" He was practically shaking, and Harry was glad it was physically Quirrel and not the real thing. Tom only swore when he was seething, so Severus took a step back.
Just as they swished out of sight with the green flames, Draco's lip started quivering,  and Harry sighed, "Now, don't cry. Come on, its lunch after this period, then straight after we have potions, then we can go straight back to our dorm." He explained clearly and took the smaller boys hand, leading him to their common room. Draco nodded solemnly, hugging a white teddy bear to his chest, which adorned a black tie and top hat.
The two looked around, and Harry asked if they could pop into a little clothes shop. He didn't care for the name, but Severus agreed. Harry grabbed some things for himself. Resizing his pyjamas and wearing his uniform even on the weekends was getting old.
"No. We were in hiding, war and all that. She was born on the floor, and a healer came by the day after. Said she was fine."
The small boy looked up with watery eyes, "B-but you were angy- I dun w-wan you be angy at Sev'rus."
"Snape. He berates us for not getting something perfect, but gives his Slytherins extra lessons." He was slumped, and Harry chuckled a little bit.
Percy walked Harry back to his room, "I'm not on rounds tonight, so you have to go to bed on time. Goodnight Harry."
"Oh Perce it was amazing. There was enough food for everyone, and we got presents!" Kode started blabbering, "Oh! And Uncle Lucius let me help him set up my mum's new room for when she gets back, so she can get better."
"I haven't heard of that spell yet, it isn't in the first year curriculum. Are you a first year? Oh, I'm Hermione Granger by the way." Harry felt like letting Bellona have a go at her, as she took the seat opposite him. "It is in the fourth year curriculum, I am a first year and the names Harry." He didn't feel like giving away his last name.
He barely listened to Dumbledore bumble through telling the students that McGonagall was dead, although when he sat down to state the fact Harry perked up some more.
She spoke with Severus, and got her a dreamless sleep and calming draught. They got her the correct amount and had her take both, with her falling asleep in minutes.
"I'll resize them at Hogwarts. That was one of the first charms I learned, resizing. Very nifty." He murmured.
He then pulled the sweets out, and set them in a pile. Draco was handed a box of Muggle chocolate, and was eating it at an alarming rate.
His Aunt Petunia was getting wearier of him by the day, she had even stopped making him do chores and doing them herself, just to save herself from seeing him. He preferred his cupboard anyways.
"Words are quite hard to cover over, because of their distinct shape. I can try, though. May I ask, what tool was used to create these scars?" He began working through his medical bag, pulling out various potions and salves.
"I think I'm gonna sleep now." He said with a yawn and Harry smiled, "Me too." He set his personal alarm and went to sleep. That night started the blooming of a most precious relationship, a one of a kind
Harry closed the diary and pocketed it, just as Draco cracked open an eye, "Harry!" He called, sitting up and greeting the other boy with a hug. "Welcome to the world of the living Draco, it's bedtime." He smiled, and the other boy greeted him with a pout, "But I just woke up!"
"Well, find some blood, write 'the chamber has opened' on the wall, and then leave them all in suspense."
The man seized at the boys words, "How do you know his given name?" He asked first, avoiding the question.
When lunch was starting, the two boys took a little stroll towards the hall. Harry lead Draco the long way, just so he could marvel in his beauty for awhile longer.
"He eventually told me, about the voice in his head. I didn't believe him at first, but he got hysterical. So I did, and he explained what was going on, and who the voice was. I was confused, but supported him. We agreed that if he ever had the need to murder someone again, he'd come to me. I would try and talk him out of it, and if that failed, I would, ah, join him."
Narcissa casted some necessary scans, and thankfully it wasn't the worst abuse case she'd seen, but still considered abuse.
Draco let out a small smile, "Mother agreed that it was a good coping mechanism. She called it age regression, if that helps you understand any. So I only became small around my parents. Father was scared, when I came to Hogwarts. He thought I wouldn't cope, because I had never been in my correct mind for more than an afternoon, so I acted older and stronger for him. Mother never agreed with him coddling me anyway and she said Hogwarts would be my lesson. My way to grow up."
Severus chuckled once again, and Harry decided that he liked the sound, "We are approaching mother care, and if one woman asks me when my child is due I will use your for potion ingredients."
His letter came today. The 24th of July. He stuck it up his shirt and gave his uncle the rest of the letters before the old man banished him to his cupboard. Harry was ecstatic. He ripped it open, reading the contents quickly. He stuffed it under his pillow and opened his diary,
T: Yes. And she isn't that deranged, it's just for show, mainly. Although I'm not sure what her mental state shall be like after we get her out.
Harry followed the prefect to the great hall, Draco discreetly holding onto his sleeve. When they got to the great hall, everyone was staring at him as if he just proclaimed aloud he was lord voldemorts son, which, he wasn't far from being if he may say so himself. He made sure Draco was seated before gracefully seating himself and urging the boy to eat, as he was as well.
Harry read the first three letters with ease, and eventually the last six too. Although he was severely struggling with the middle name. "Mar.. Ma'vo...Ma'volo!" He managed eventually his mouth stretching into a small smile, as his eyes glistened.
"We want to know why Potter needed you. Anyway, what were you talking about? Why do you need to watch him?" The two switched with talking, and stood tall. Harry saw Percy weighing his options.
"You mentioned Tom yesterday, on a tense that meant you have contact with him, and what you insinuated makes me believe it was not a child from your home town."
"There is many ways in and out. She is sleeping in one of the drainage pipes." He hissed helpfully, and Harry searched around for her. He couldn't find her, and supposed she was in one of the higher up ones.
"Uh, w-well, she uh, she wasn't nice. She'd yell and throw and hit me. Her nails scratched me a lot." Narcissa gave a comforting squeeze, "I dont- I didn't have nice clothes, and I didn't know how to clean myself. She'd yell at me for not doing things that she never taught me how to do."
"Someone who will cause an uproar, but not keep classes cancelled for much longer. Even I want you to get Zachariah in with the rest of you death eater children."
Halloween came around soon enough. Nothing particularly eventful had happened, Harry seemed to keep the peace between houses. Dumbledore had tried his luck with Harry, but Harry wasn't having any of it.
T: I remember the first time all of my followers killed someone, some were stricken with glee, and they made me sick, others cried, one particular man didnt show up for nearly six months afterward. I started to loose my sanity, about six months before my demise and now I'm stuck as a book. The light side twisted my doings, and said i was out for muggles and muggleborns, which was true, but is no longer. I did see them as lesser, and did not want Muggle raised at Hogwarts, and that is still true in some forms. I hate the fact that muggle raised are bringing such filth to Hogwarts and extracting it from its roots. Dumbledore is not a good man, however by any means. Shall I go on? I can sense that youre tired.
The snake circled him, "You did not disturb me, it has been decades since I've spoken to a human. I was under the impression Tom was deceased." The snake finally settled his head by Harry's side, and Harry sat down. Even the snakes nostrils were high above his head.
As much as he hated muggles and Muggleborns who brought dirt upon their world, he liked their clothes.  Wizards were too old fashioned.
"Yeah well that was when I was trying to convince everyone I was an innocent child. Clearly, that didn't work." He huffed, shoving his hands in his pockets.
"Karkoden, really, you think I learned all this from a book? I'm a death eater child. Sort of. Now come on, we have a letter to write."
"My name is Atlantes. Of course I would." Atlantes tone almost sounded sultry, "Would you like to scare the rest of the school with me?"
Severus was grinning, sort of. He chuckled in the back of his throat, "I assumed you knew. I'm sure Lucius won't mind my sharing, you're bound to find out. Most Malfoys are born with open uteruses. Or, should I say, most Malfoys are intersex. Born with both genetalia. That's why most are flamboyant, they're all legally male for the extra privileges, but they are biologically both genders."
Harry, still exhausted, ended up being half carried by Severus. He noted the aurors guarding the bathroom, which woke him up completely, although he acted as if he was still tired. Severus sat him next to Percy, and Percy instantly pulled him close. It was clear to Harry that the prefect had already been told.
The two were seen walking down the hall, Draco clinging onto Harry for dear life and skipping slightly.
"She does?" Percy asked, one eyebrow raised. "That sounds quite lovely. Get the childhood she never had,"
"Anyone else?" Harry asked, and many people were sorted through. Everyone growing more impressed, "Do professor Snape." Someone suggests, and Harry objected, "I would-" But then Snape thought fuck it and gave Harry permission, eventfully cutting him off. Harry nods. "I'll try to keep it as non personal as possible," to which Snape nodded his thanks,
"I got a new chess board! And a really nice blanket, and some books that are easier to read. And a new wand, and clothes, and everything!"
"So I'm just stuck with you telling me to kill people, then?" Harry was growing to enjoy this man's company- he usually took to calling him Voldemort. He was completely seperate from his Tom.
T: Okay, there may be a Slytherin chamber that houses a basilisk. He's friend's and won't attack unless a parselmouth instructs him so.
Harry and Draco worked quickly and efficiently, ignoring the jarring words the Gryffindors were throwing at them, like the other Slytherins. Harry felt Bellona wriggle from where she was wrapped around his waist, and he cursed lightly, Draco looking at him with slight concern, "Not to worry," He half smiled, and Draco nodded, going back to their potion just as the Longbottom boy blew up his cauldron.
"It does. I'm unsure of sleeping arrangements, but I believe I'm to go to Slytherin tower with you." Percy turned on his heel, once again, to the twins who stopped dead in their tracks.
"Sounds great. Okay so I need to kill McGonagall." Harry leaned against the big snake, running his hands over his scales.
"Children," Narcissa spoke, "I'm going to pick some shopping up, I'll be no more than thirty minutes. Please dont make too large of a mess while I'm gone."
Percy nodded, a sad smile. "Well I'll make sure to tell them thank you. Is there any word from my older brothers?"
He was abruptly thrown from the car, dragging his trunk behind him, and somehow, in a blur, made his way onto platform 9 3/4. He boarded the train, and claimed an empty compartment as his own. He leaned against the wall, a little behind the window, when he saw the initials T.M.R carved into the wooden window pane. Harry never thought Tom (his father?) to be one for graffiti, if that's what you could call it.
H: I didn't run too far, I got bored and stopped. They got bored pretty quickly and left, but when we got back Uncle Vernon was mad I didn't let Dudley "play" with me.
"What the fuck was that?" He hissed to him in the snake tongue. He received a confused look in return. Harry left for the Slytherin dungeons, gripping his diary with white knuckles.
He pulled Bellona out from under his oversized, ripped t-shirt and let her bathe in the sunlight, making small talk. She quickly fell asleep and Harry decided to talk to Tom, when a girl with bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth opened his compartment door,
S'okay, 'Arry." He nodded, and slid to the floor. Draco sat by him, hugging cautiously. Harry gripped onto him tight.
"The dog - Fluffy - is Hagrids. He's meant to be protecting something but I couldn't see what. I need to pay a visit to Hagrid, I think." Tom nodded, slightly bewildered.
T: Why of course, I've just transfigured myself into a book! No you silly child. I am but a diary, once a person. But a person no longer. Tell me, boy, are you a wizard? I am assuming you are.
Harry pulled his legs up onto his chair and crossed them. Tom raised a nonexistent eyebrow and started in his smooth tone, "Dumbledore has not told us much. We know he is hiding the stone, and he needs the professors help completing the traps. I doubt they will be too hard as he expects you to grow into your hero complex and take on the course."
"Dont worry, I'll talk to professor Snape and I'll get in contact with your daddy." Harry smiled, and Draco flushed even more, "Don't tell anyone I still call him that please?" He whispered, rubbing his eyes. "I won't. Now, onto the subject of Mr. Teddy." Harry said, and Draco nodded. "Is he at Hogwarts?" To that Draco shook his head, "I didn't want to be made fun of." Harry scooted up so he was sitting next to the boy, "Its okay, lots of the people in our house have comfort items. Some similar to yours, some a bit stranger, and some even more child like. Our house is full of diverse people, Draco. Having your teddy would be okay." Draco looked relived, and he nodded. "If you get in contact with my dad will you ask him to bring him?" He whispered on a meek voice, to which Harry nodded too. "Of course. Now, I can't bribe your father to stay Jere with you every night, but I think you'll be okay. And if you ever get too scared I'm always here." Draco nodded and laid down.
"I don't have to prove myself to you, boy." Tom snarled back, and it became clear to Severus and Lucius that they should probably evacuate.
Narcissa stood up, "Thank you, Mister Weasley. Please may you sit down with her?" He nodded and sat with her on his lap, "May someone tell me what is the matter?"
It was now December, and soon after the incident, Molly Weasley was charged with child neglect. She was sentenced to five years in Azkaban, although Lucius wanted her to go for more. Dumbledore got off unscathed, much to everyone's annoyance. Arthur was sadly still admitted to St. Mungos, and they were looking in to see who had been drugging him.
Draco went to the bathroom and then sat on Harry's bed to do homework with him. They spoke of minimal things, mostly just Draco asking questions and Harry jotting down bits in the weird book of his, or, his diary.
Draco came out of the bathroom with a grin on his face and took Harry's offered hand as they headed down to the Great Hall. Once seated, Harry felt Quirrels eyes on him as he filled both plates with healthy food, ignoring the blondes unhappy whine.
Lucius looked pensive for a moment before tilting his head, "I'm not sure, but more than likely you as it's alphabetical."
T: Well, you would need to take the stone to Quirrel firstly. Bring the diary along with you. The potion is complicated, so we may need Severus for that, but I don't doubt you. The soul in my book would need to be added first, and then the soul from Quirrel. This one needs to be added first as its most human.
Even though the boy understands all magic at NEWT levels now, he still had yet to perform any, and one night when he was so hungry his vision started to blur, he willed the locks on his cupboard open, and they did with a soft click and he scampered to the kitchen, not caring about being subtle.
Naturally Harry went into the sweet shop. Severus huffed and followed behind; he was attempting to discreetly buy himself some chocolate. Harry wondered if the man was aware he could read minds.
"No, Harry's sad and I don't know what to do. He was crying at the mirror, and he has lots of cuts. I think he's hurt but he never goes to the hospital wing."
"We can talk about that during Dumbledores trial. Is that all?" Harry could feel Tom's anger, and sometimes feelings transcended.
Harry flopped onto his bed with Draco, and they simply laid in each others embrace for a small while.
T: Eventually she stopped screaming and collapsed. We, naturally, rushed over to see if she was okay, but she was inconsolable. We later found out that whoever had her baby had blocked his magical bond, which filled her with a little but of hope because that meant they weren't going to kill him, and possibly get adopted out. But then a new craze set in, and that's when she lost her first ounce of sanity. Someone had her baby and she had to find out who and get him back. But we never found him.
"What is that book, Harry?" The small boy asked softly, peeking over at it. "It's a diary." He said curtly, "Have you finished your essay yet?" He asked, snapping the book closed after he wrote something. "Uh, no." He mumbled, "Chop chop, back to it." Harry smiled, and pet Draco's head, as he finished his own essay.
"Are you okay? You look a little lost." The concern was very clear in his tone, and the boy slightly shook his head.
Harry leant down and grabbed a bag from the floor, pulling it towards the bed. "Nappies. Cloth nappies, to be exact."
"You know, despite you being the insane bit, you're still surprisingly like Tom. I feel like he exaggerated things. You don't seem that bad, and quite considerate."
Harry closed his book, scooting closer to Ron. He cast the spell, and Ron looked up, about to ask what he was doing.
H: Okay so different topic, I really want to find Bella's child. Just for when she's coming back, to maybe help her?
"Harry?" The nervous boy asked, his toad struggling, "Do you... Do you think Trevor likes me?" He looked down, the frog eventually breaking free.
"Mister Evans if you have impregnated mister Malfoy or he has impregnated another, I will string you up by your toes."
"It's normal to not understand. I don't know what will happen, but just know, I'll cover for you." Percy grinned a little, and went back to his book.
"Now, Karkoden Thomas Black, previously Ronald Billius Weasley, will you please take the stand. You may bring up a friend or adult for comfort, but they are not permitted to talk."
"Today we are gathered to view the cases against Mrs Molly Weasley nee Prewett and tomorrow, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. First, Mrs Weasley." He nodded to the guards, and they placed her in a locked chair, not speaking.
"For me?" He gestured wildly, wiggling in his spot. Harry nodded at pressed it against his lips. Draco accepted it happily, and began suckling. He visibly relaxed and thanked Harry multiple times. Harry relaxed back onto his bed, Draco colouring once again.
Just as Narcissa stepped through with Ginny, Draco grabbed Harry's collar, tearing him off the seat. His cup clattered to the ground, smashing.
"You fucking owe me one, big time." Draco growled, "How did I do, though? I hope I didn't fuck anything up."
Severus stood up and back, momentarily reaching for his own wand, when a little cry was sounded out behind them.
"A young girl has been murdered," came the shaky voice of McGonagall. Gasps erupted from the students, although Harry already knew. It was all part of the plan, he noted. It was sad that the girl had to die, but they didn't need any of her kind around here anyway. Shame she held such Muggle beliefs, really. She was a smart girl.
"Alright kiddo, you go to the bathroom when we get in, and then we'll do our homework. Got it?" Harry spoke quickly, and Draco nodded with a small noise of acknowledgement. They, luckily, didn't run into anyone on their way through the dungeons besides their own house. And when they got in, and walked the corridor to their dorms, they did as planned.
The man had also acquired the boys last name and then went on to explain how his parents actually died and what happened. Harry wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to Tom after that, but the man promised as long as Harry didn't end up becoming Dumbledore's pawn, he wouldn't try to kill him.
Harry noticed the man stare down the dark alley, the one he knew to be Knockturn. Tom had told him he would take him down there, but to never go without a heavily trusted adult. It was dangerous, especially for children.
But right now he was quite lonely. Severus spent most of his time with Quirrel, and Dumbledore was happy that Severus had finally stopped being so hostile.
"Well, I helped set up their rooms. Koden wanted to do the cleansing ritual quite quickly, so after he was settled and had clear health my mum cleansed him of unwanted magicks. We all hung out really, tool them shopping. Just, kid stuff."
Harry was a little teary eyed, "Well, they really told you everything, huh?" He received a nod, "And thank you for everything you said. I guess I never thought of it as family. Just.. people I cared about, I suppose."
"He always did put writing anything to the back of his mind, it's not purposeful. Come along, should we head to the library?" Percy held out his hand; despite Harry acting older, the ginger boy still treated him like a child. Harry wasn't averse to it, and almost liked it.
Lucius nodded, "Of course," He stopped himself abruptly and it was clear to Harry and Tom of the 'My Lord' that almost slipped out, "What is this other investigation you wish to launch?"
The crying stopped and Harry heard rustling, meaning Draco was wiping his face. "S-sure." He croaked and Harry pulled back the curtain, sitting down on the rustled sheets. "Whats wrong?" He asked softly, after all Harry still had a heart and he still cared. "Nothing.." The boy denied, fiddling with his fingers, a nervous twitch Harry instantly picked up on.  "Its okay, you can tell me. I wont tell anyone. I swear on my magic." Harry said even softer, moving to cross his legs and sit facing the boy. They both knew the promise wouldn't do anything, but it was fun to pretend, and it set Draco at ease too.
They climbed into the dingy boat and Hagrid used his umbrella to make the boat go faster. Harry was confused, but let it go. They climbed onto a motorbike and whizzed off.
Harry and Draco rejoined the adults, and they slipped into easy conversation. Harry inquired as to what was to happen with the other Weasley children, and Lucius spoke up, "Well, the ministry is organising a court date. Molly has been placed in a watching cell in the Azkaban prison, and was charged five years for child neglect on the spot, but obviously we have other things against her. She will be removed from her cell after Christmas for a full scale investigation. Each child will be interviewed, including the two oldest. And then, if Arthur is unable to take care of his children, we will see as to where we can place them for care. Koden naturally comes to us, and as Ginny has been placed in our emergency care, we would be first on the list for her home."
Ginny immediately looked up, bursting into a new bout of tears. Percy rushed and grabbed her from Narcissa, and he calmed her within five minutes.
"So, so I didn't know how to talk very well. Cissa has been really kind and taught me a lot. C-can I go sit back down now?" She was clearly shaking, and with a nod, Narcissa swooped her up and walked back towards the seating area.
In the morning, Harry acted cheerful. He went to breakfast, but made an excuse of finding a new book he wanted to read. He once again entered his mind.
Either way, Snape was walking back up to fight the troll. Harry let out a sigh of relief and pulled Tom from the room behind him.
Luckily, Draco rounded the corner so Harry didn't have to reply. "Harry!" He exclaimed, "Morning." He nodded to Ron, and the ginger boy looked perplexed.
Now Narcissa looked, she could see the obvious signs. "Of course minister, I'll have her for as long as needed. I'll start on medical scans in Severus Snapes rooms."
Tom hugged Harry, and Severus, then the adults and Harry had a conversation regarding the trial. Tom had seen parts, but not all of it. Before they knew it, the children were all passed out on random parts of the floor, sweets and chocolate around their mouthes.
Severus, much to Harry's confusion, placed one hand on Harry's elbow, pulling him around to the man's front. The hand let go of the elbow and in stead wrapped around his shoulders, leaving him half pressed against Severus' chest.
"Ah, I do believe you are right. Draco does seem to love dear Harry, doesn't he?" You could hear Tom's smirk, and Narcissa did start laughing as Severus started bluffing.
Draco fiddled with his shoes, finally getting them on. Happy that Harry wouldn't see him leaving, he trudged out the room. He was on a mission.
"Now," All the attention was back on the minister, "Mrs Molly Weasley is going to say her piece. After that, the children will be moved to a back safe room and every one who is not a voter or myself will leave for the viewing of memories."
Harry took this opportunity too look up and make eye contact with Quirrel, he broke off quickly to scribble bye and put his book away. He maintained eye contact until the food appeared and Quirrels eyes flashed red as he nodded to Harry's plate and started to eat himself. Harry got the memo and started eating.
"That's understandable. Now, it's nearly dinner time. What do you say we see where Harry and Neville have gotten to, hm? Also, Karkoden you are going to be resorted by Professor Snape."
Once in his dorm room and he had picked his bed, the overly smart boy changed quickly. When all the other boys were asleep, he heard quiet crying from Draco's bed. Harry instantly knew what it was and made his way to the blondes bed. "Hey Draco? Is it alright if I open the curtain?"
After Severus, Bill was called up. All the adults seemed to be going before the children, although the way he was called up was somewhat different, "William Arthur Weasley, please come to the stand and discuss your experiences with your mother."
"Mr. Potter? Where are you?" Her voice was stern, and Harry motioned for the large snake to get ready. He kept his eyes strictly ahead.
Harry decided he'd stay out of his mind. That was weird, and he didn't like it. Perhaps Tom would have a cure. For now, he grabbed Draco some clean clothes and set them in the bathroom for him.
T: She believed I helped her get him, by being a direct connection to lady Magic. She was a wonderful woman and mother on her own, but she worshipped me like no other. I was Godfather, and she would of been godmother to any of my children.
Tom was enraged when one night Harry was in so much pain that Tom could feel it. He had politely forced the boy to tell him, and that's when he told him how to control his accidental magic, and how to stand up for himself the muggle way.
"Are you small, Draco?" He asked, lifting Draco off the wet sheets in order to dry them. He received a small noise of affirmation and decided it was time to indulge the blonde, and spend some more time with him while regressed. After cleaning the bed and the boy, Harry passed him Mr. Teddy and made their way to Severus' quarters.
True to her word, Narcissa was back half an hour later, purse full of sweets to snack on once they were back at Hogwarts.
At this Harry looked up at Quirrel, who was bent over the table in a way so nobody could see his face. Harry assumed it was because Tom was fronting.
Draco nodded, and Harry stood up, turning and placing Draco in his previously occupied spot. He found the discarded colouring book and crayons, handing them to the small boy.
T: Severus, I became a father. You can too. If we look at it technically, you are Harry's father too.
"Ah, is there anything we could do, so Karkoden could see her? It's clear he wants to." Harry stared over at him for a moment before turning back to the adults.
T: She did, and I loved her. But I loved her as I would a sister, or a close friend. There is only one man who owns my heart, and I fear he hates me.
So Harry was used to it. He went limp as his uncle dropped him to the ground, whisper yelling at him, not that Harry was listening. His uncle had obviously asked a question or something, as now he was angrily stripping the boy, grumbling about insolent brats, and as Harry was shaking himself back to reality, a sharp crack was left on his already scarred behind, making him audibly squeak and jump, which again caused his uncle grab his hair and yank his head back.
Harry was instantly alarmed. He could not afford to go insane. "Why didn't Tom tell me you were here?"
After an awkward encounter with a too stuttery professor Harry was in Diagon Ally. He was very Happy to say the least. They went to Gringotts to get money and the rest is history.
When he opened his eyes, they were blazing red. The fire and anger was evident deep within, and he was met with four sharp intakes of breath, before blinking once again and having his bright green back. "Back to the task at hand, yes?"
"No, they won't. But we'll get her out, and once she's better you can bet she'll never let you go again."
Draco was surprised he was going, but he had to stand in and confirm his parents weren't lying. Harry had to go because he was the one who originally found it out. Everyone else was rather self explanatory.
Percy wrinkled his eyebrows, "Charlie would probably take the twins, and Bill might take Ginny at a push, but I don't know about me."
Harry tensed, "Well, I may have slipped up. Yes, I have contact with the Tom we both know. It is nothing bad, and I do not wish to discuss it further.
But, unlike they expected, Severus replied, calmly, with, "I am afraid, Mister Evans, that this was not my doing. Professor Dumbledore required all Slytherins and Gryffindors be partnered up to sort house rivalry, and all Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs partner together because they could learn valuable lessons from one another." Harry turned sharply on his heel and stalked up to the head table, "Are you trying to kill your students old man?" He sneered, "All of you know each class will end in some sort of disaster, and there will be at least four people in the hospital wing a lesson." He said, his voice getting progressively louder and more threatening.
Harry put his shoes back on, but took off his robe, so he was only wearing his shirt, which was neatly tucked into his trousers, his shoes, socks and tie. Draco stripped to his boxers and put on some silk pyjamas and slippers, then Harry grabbed his wand and they walked down to Professor Snape's office, and knocked. A drawled, "Enter." was heard, and the two boys walked in to see a blonde couple, and Draco's face broke out in a grin and darted at his father, as Harry assumed. His thoughts were confirmed when Draco let out a squeal that sounded far to similar to, "Daddy I missed you!" While the blonde mad was cuddling his son, he noticed the tall, slim boy in the doorway. The blonde man coughed, and looked at the boy, trying to shrug his son off, "Mr Malfoy, please hug him to his hearts content. He has been crying since he got here." Harry drawled, leaning against the door frame. "I have not!" Draco scoffed, his cheeks reddening as he turned on his fathers lap to face Harry.
Lucius was patient, but still annoyed. Finally, after two weeks of painful waiting, the ministry officials were sent in to question Ron. Harry had told him how to act, and he had it down to key.
"We are a united house, do not expect anything from any of the other houses. They see you no better than the scum on the bottom of their shoe. We maintain calm in the public eye, any quarrels between dorm mates must be sorted and kept within your dorm rooms, or, by extension, the common room. There are only three rules within Slytherin, one which I have already covered. One, is we stick together, two is we must maintain the highest spots and three is that we dong get caught. Is that clear?" The girl got no reply, so she nodded. "Good. I shall hand you over to Professor Snape."
Harry explored the chamber with his new found friend, and soon it was time for dinner. Harry grew giddy the closer it got to midnight, and was practically skipping to the hall. He once again sat with Percy, his grin widening. "I got lost in the dungeons. I'm starving."
Harry was seven now. This is when Tom finally gave in to the boys begging, telling him all about the Dark Arts, the theories behind it all, the cruel details and the fascinating ones. Its beauty yet its danger, and how it made you feel powerful, power that light magic simply cant portray. Harry was more intrigued now, which Tom saw the resemblance, between this boy, and himself at eleven.
Harry nodded, "So, what possible charges would we be looking at?" Draco had slipped away and sat with the other two children, as the conversation was not for him.
"Sort of. Charlie said he's gonna come down, for the twins, but Bill hasn't replied yet. They think he has something to do with the abuse so they're going to forcibly bring him down either way. Charlie is going on trial too. Dad is gonna send you a letter cause you may have to speak as well."
Once inside, they were met with Arthur, Molly, Dumbledore, Ginny, Minister fudge and two other ministry officials. A few moments after getting situated, a tall woman stepped through the fireplace. She was wearing all white, her hair pulled back neatly. It was Narcissa. She smiled warmly at her nephew, and opened her medical case.
"Draco?" The tone was soft, buy soon turned harsher when he looked at the other boy, "Weasley, what is the meaning of this?"
Tom, instantly calm, dropped to his knees to be at eye level, "I'm sorry for yelling love, who's in your head? Can you talk to me?"
"Of course professor. I would greatly appreciate you talking with the headmaster." He gave the teacher a pearly white grin, and turned on his heel, Draco following suit.
Harry nodded, "Thank you, Tom. I've left some excess magic in here for you, grab it when you are weak. I won't give you any more."
"Well I'll come back later. Which is the quickest way out?" He heard Atlantes move, and walked alongside him.
Harry pulled out two rings from his breast pocket, displaying them on the table. Severus' eyebrows shot up, taking in their appearance. They were plain black, but he could faintly see the engravings, and the magic seeping from them was obvious.
He tugged the front of his trousers down, just enough for the full scar to be visible. Well, scars, really. Five of them. Five letters, that make up one painful word. Freak.
While Draco was sleeping, Harry decided to go for a shower. He gently moved himself from the small boys grip, standing up and stretching. He noted the boys unpadded bottom, but didn't want to risk waking him. He would deal with the wet bed sheets.
And so Draco started listing everyone off, pointing to the obvious ones first, "Thas me, and mummy and daddy, and thas Sev'rus next to daddy. Next to mummy is auntie 'trix an her little boy. He doesn't have a face yet cause dunno what he looks like." He stuck his tongue out the corner of his mouth, "Thas you, next to Sev'rus."
Severus headed off to find the twins, and Tom pulled Harry aside. The two had been working on opening the bond, so Tom may be able to watch through Harry's eyes.
He walked over, reaching for his wand, (which wasn't there- he had to remind himself he was in his own mind and not his body). Once he reached the darkness, it seemed to absorb him. Harry would be lying if he said he didn't panic for a small while.
"That alright, darling?" Harry asked once he'd tugged Draco's pants back up. The boy nodded, his dummy still bobbing in his mouth. Harry lead him into the bathroom to brush his teeth before tucking him up in bed.
There it was - the nickname - again. Harry fell asleep with a smile on his lips and Bella wrapped around the diary in his grasp.
Severus creaked open the dormitory door, Harry's snores evident from across the room. Severus gently set Draco down, and made his way to Harry. He was still shirtless, and Severus' heart plummeted. He hoped what he was hearing was wrong, but it wasn't. He just hoped it wasn't too late.
The diary, Tom, explained everything, from blood supremacists to the last wizarding war, which both sides were explained. Before Tom told Harry about his parents or his part in the war he asked the boy one very important question:
Tom knew why, it was the same when he was nine, when he would hurt the other boys for hurting him. Harry didn't hurt them but scared them, scarred them mentally. Like the other children had done him.
Harry nodded to that, "I sure as hell know that feeling. It's like, to my aunt and uncle my cousin can do no wrong but I'm the scum of the earth."
The plan was originally to have to troll find her, but the teachers caught it before it could cause any damage. So Harry just had to step in. It would mess up the whole plan, otherwise. Her cries were pitiful, really. This, of course, was only part of Harry's plan. Tom needn't know it wasn't an accident.
Snape was speechless, and the blond ponce spoke up, "Go on then, figure me out. Prove it." He smirked, and Harry scoffed, "I figured you out from the five minutes in the robe shop. Rich, and rather spoilt, but kept in check by your mother. Surprisingly, it is your father that insists that you must be spoilt, leading me to believe you are loved and cherished by him no matter what people say about his shady past, which he easily got out of. Which then makes you believe your daddy owns the world. There are other facts, but I do believe they are too personal, even for the Slytherin common room. Am I wrong?" The entire room was silent, and Malfoy squeaks out a tiny, "No." And everyone gasped, leaving Snape to be very impressed.
As the four walked down the hall, Ginny was still crying, "I wa-want Percy," she sobbed, and Narcissa bounced her, "Is that your big brother?" She asked, and the small girl nodded, "Does he go here?" She nodded again and Narcissa kissed her forehead, "Okay, I'll see if I can get Percy for you."
"So, you have a younger sister?" Harry asked, finally decided to start on the subject that had been the reason for this friendship.
Harry once again agreed, before speaking up once again, "Did Dumbledore not ask my guardians permission?"
Harry did have to jog to keep up for a small while as Severus had left without him, but they were soon at the marbled entrance. Harry, despite looking all evil and brooding, would always be excitable at the sight of the magical alley.
Draco gently shook his head, "I don't feel small anymore. And you didn't really pull me, I was teetering anyway, because I'd been small for so long."
Harry laughed "No." He replied, before realising, "Well, sort of. I was adopted by Professor Snape's lover. Or previous lover, but I do believe they are working on their relationship again."
Snape was astonished, and watched as Harry read the time, "Blimey, I think I best go to bed." The time read half one in the morning, and he nodded to them all, "Off to bed. Boys on the left girls on the right. Goodnight students." The professor received an array of replies and everyone was in their dorms.
"It is impossible for you to sort a child from that distance." Dumbledore began, "Can you not feel the power radiating off the child? He is stronger than the Riddle boy!" The hat fought, Dumbledore motioned for the sorting to continue and he watched the boy with interest, as he puled a diary from his pocket and started writing. It was strange how he sectioned himself from the students, not daring to even go near them. There was something very, very strange about this boy.
"I don't know how I can do it. It's unsettling and strange. I can see memories pop up, they're faint. I can ignore them usually, and I dont pay much attention. It was a gift so that I could avoid my uncles brutal throws when I was younger, but now it's more of a curse. It is still lovely, but now I know it would end up in my enslavement. I can delve deeper. Watch peoples lives in thirty seconds. Everything is fast and nothing makes much sense. Recent memories are stronger, and if I poke around I can know the things you recently thought about."
Severus, understandably, was a little shocked, but they continued into another clothes shop. Harry bought some more things, while Severus followed him slowly. People were still looking on in concern, but Harry made sure to include Severus in conversation once he could sense someone about to call a security guard.
"Excuse me, Griphook?" Mentioned goblin turned to the boy and nodded, "Is there anyway to get Muggle money? From my fortune already, I mean."
Harry knocked politely on the door, and he was met with a stuttery reply of 'enter'. So he did, he sauntered into the room and there sat Quirrel. He raised an eyebrow and sat in front of the man, "Evening Professor." He said smartly, crossing his legs. Quirrel shook his head and let his turban fall, turning on his chair, "Merlin, you're ugly." He said to the unimpressed snake-face of Tom Riddle. "I am aware I look terrible, this is specifically why I am using my diary self." He drawled, "Oo you sound like a snake." He said, "Why are your eyes red?" He asked, leaning forward on his desk, "And where's your nose?" The snake-faced voldemort snorted, "I am aware I sound like a snake, I have red eyes due to all the dark spells and rituals I cast and perform, and many body parts had to be sacrificed so I could live on Quirrel and not be noticed." He explained.
Once they were back in their dorm, Draco had flopped onto his bed and grabbed his dummy, two stuffed animals and blanket, before climbing into Harry's bed.
He acted clueless, but spoke in an incriminating way. He mentioned Ginny's strange birthing times, and that was checked over. It was seen that there was no way Ron and Ginny could both be the Weasleys biological children, and so were both due to be given blood tests tomorrow.
"Harry Severus Riddle," Tom was so angry he hadn't realised the name he'd used, "What have you done?"
T: Oh by the way Harry, I split my soul a few years before I was killed, by you, and I keep in contact with my other pieces of soul.
With Draco preoccupied, Harry pulled out an old notebook of his, writing down all the names of the male students in his year-
The snake blinked, if you could call it that. "I killed a girl so he could put himself in that diary."
Then, as if by magic almost, words appeared on the page, and the child rushed to put on his too big glasses.
Harry smiled, "It's okay, darling. You don't need to put all of your daddy's friends on there. You said it was just family, yes? And thank you for putting me and Tom on there, sweetheart."
Draco had, in fact, fallen asleep without a hitch. Which Harry was very grateful for. This made sneaking out very easy. He kissed Draco upon the head one last time and left down the stairs and out the entrance to the common room. It was much too easy, honestly.
"No, he's resting." The shorter man gasped, his own eyes rolling back on an attempt to sleep. Severus handed him a blanket and went to his own room for some much needed rest.
"Do stop staring Harry, it doesn't do well for your image." The man drawled, his body limp but still radiating power.
Harry worked on channeling magic to the Horcrux, already going back on his earlier word, while tears gathered in his eyes. He had to make this believable.
Harry brought Ron up into the Slytherin dorms, and sat at his desk. "Neville is Rabastan LeStranges son, I'm not sure of his mother. His real name is Zachariah. I am biologically James and Lily's son, but have been, ah, adopted."
Rounding a corner, Harry spotted the tell tale Gryffindor cloak swishing around a corner, and he jogged to keep up.
Harry took strides with Draco skipping alongside him, and soon they were sitting down to eat with variations of fruit on their plates. Draco was more unsophisticated than his taller friend, but Harry thought it cute anyway.
The Malfoys were awarded custody of Karkoden, and Narcissa started the cleansing soon after. He was bedridden for two weeks, which brought us to now. Ginny had gone into emergency care with the Malfoys, and they planned on talking to her about adoption. The twins and Percy were so far undecided.
Harry used to deal with the smaller kids at school, he was only mean to the people that were mean to him, and he liked children anyway. And right now Draco was reminding him of a very fragile three year old. He cautiously pulled the smaller boy into his chest, and stroked his hair, "Its alright, come on, let's get you out of those wet pants. They gotta be itchy huh?" Draco nodded still crying and Harry pulled his boxers and pyjama pants down in one. He lifted the now naked boy out of them and into the shower, which was charmed to be the perfect temperature.
"I can confirm that Ronald Weasley is in fact, Bellatrix Blacks son." The minister announced, and that is what set Molly off.
But instead of ushering Draco or himself into a stall, he slid down onto the pristine floor. Draco naturally sat next to him and rested his head on the tallers shoulder.
Harry was nine now, and his aunt was sufficiently terrified of the boy. Harry didn't know why, he was never bad. Just scared Dudley's friends a bit. And the kids at school.
Lucius strode with power, and stood tall. At a nod, he recalled a story much similar to his wives, "I was not present during the initial meeting, as my wife was. After the incident I was called to Hogwarts to help with the situation, at which point my wife was conducting basic medical exams. Through their stay with us, both children have shown severe signs of abuse, with my nephew confiding in me. I am willing to show those memories in a private viewing, for the members of court only."
"You know, you're a lot smarter than anyone gives you credit for. Your name is Zachariah LeStrange, and you are the lovechild of Rabastan and a witch who is not mentioned. It is believed she passed away."
After showering he tied a towel around his waist and all but dragged Draco into the shower, letting the water spray onto him, his tears getting mixed in. Harry washed him gently, humming softly. Soon enough they were clean and Harry got Draco and himself dry and dressed, ready for classes.
"If you haven't noticed, boys, our head of house was murdered, and it appears to of been an attack by someone who follows you-know-who. Harry is prime target, so he has to be protected. That's what we were talking about. Now, off with you. I have to report anyone who shows suspicious behaviour regarding Harry, and I wouldn't want you two to be the first on the list, no?" Percy walked away, and the twins didn't follow.
Narcissa came back with tea and snacks, with all the children sitting down to eat. It was mostly quiet for a few minutes, Percy moving closer to Harry, who had since closed off his connection with Tom.
"A professor. Kill a professor. Make it look like an accident, and break wont go on too much longer." His eyes were dark, and downcast.
Harry couldn't understand what he was seeing; the future, perhaps? But he supposed that if this were to show the future it would show something a little more drastic. Perhaps the future he wanted? Harry did want to just be happy, after all. He summed it up to that and vowed to come back when he was less exhausted.
Tom had told him all about the half giant, like how he got him excluded for opening the chamber of secrets when it was in fact himself. He zoned out the entire conversation and only noticed when Hagrid held out a plate of sausages for him, which he took gratefully. Harry took the chance to look about and noticed that his entire so called family were white as a sheet. And his uncles gun was bent in a complete circle. Fascinating.
Binns pushed his imaginary glasses up his nose and looked over the book Harry handed him. "I have never seen this book before in my life, young sir. I shall talk to professor Dumbledore about it, providing you were given instructions to get the same book?" He spoke out to the class.
Draco spluttered for a moment, "I don't believe you could be a cold blooded murderer. You always have a motive, for everything you do."
"Hermione Granger," the old woman continued, a single tear on her cheek, "it appears that the troll found her. We are all in sorrow at our loss, and children are welcome to go home until the legalities have been dealt with. If you wish to stay, counseling will be available and classes will be cancelled."
Harry fell into an angry sleep. He had left Tom and Bell in his cupboard, not realising they were going so far. He hoped he got to retrieve them.
H: Okay, so, possibly unveiled a death eater child, just the wrong one. When Neville gets back to Hogwarts I'll try and talk to him, because he must remember something?
H: I thought, perhaps, the Longbottom boy? His parents were tortured to insanity by her. Maybe she found out he was hers and went to get him back?
They learnt about the goblin wars and their strategies, and how they failed both times. Harry, having read the book, realised this was not in it; he decided to bring it up to the professor.
