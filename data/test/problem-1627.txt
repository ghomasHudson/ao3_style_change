"Don't be so sure Potter, I am not a virgin like you are, I still have needs-" Draco froze when panic glowed in Harry's eyes and the body in his lap went still and the glass in the room shattered. "I won't touch you without your permission Harry. I'm not a monster." He felt outraged that Harry would think such things. "Why would you ever think I would do such things!?"
"You aren't leaving this room until you tell me why y-"
"We will continue this later, we need to fix the clauses to Imperious, potions, force and add a clause that I believe is needed.
"Harry Potter!" The slightly smaller man of the two gushed had been a while since Harry had met an adult who was in awe of his moniker. "It is an honor to meet you!" The man shoved his hand forward to grasp the young boy's, shaking it roughly without blinking for several moments.
"T-Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, I greatly appreciate the offer." As Harry spoke the words, the man came over to stand behind him, one hand on his shoulder. Professor Snape packed all of Harry's things with a few waves of his wand. The young Gryffindor stood close to both the older men he had grown comfortable with. When two men, both older and completely unrecognizable to Harry, approached him with excitable grins, Harry felt himself step back, directly into the blond's body, pressing himself even closer when the men didn't pause despite Harry stepping away from them.
Hermione turned her head and refused to answer.
Draco and Harry raced to a stall, locking it just before the door opened and footsteps entered the room. Draco placed a finger over Harry's lips, eyes closed as he listened in on Hermione and Ron's conversation.
"Harrison James Potter." Draco pulled back and pulled Harry with him, both of them coated in snow, their clothes a bit disarray from the tickling and rolling on the ground.
"Ummm..... I got into an argument with Draco and......" Harry looked to Severus who sighed softly.
"Floo us."
"The guys in the dorm talk about those things and it scares me the way they talk about it. They don't care if their partner wants it or not. Dean even mentioned that once his Muggle friend has drugged his girlfriend and did things and everyone else - besides Nev - said they wanted to try that." He felt ashamed for telling but he felt something deep within his chest urge him to tell Draco everything. "And I grew up with Muggles. Magic hating Muggles and they weren't above hurting me to get what they wanted."
"It was weird." Harry frowned. "The twins, Dean and Seamus, and Neville were all talking about the positives and they were supportive but...."
The room was silent as Fudge called the trial into order and swore himself in. Amelia immediately stepped forward, eyes hard as steel as she gazed at the redheaded girl before her. The first few questions were slow, Ginny answering with insults to Madam Bones and Barrister Malfoy. After a vote, a truth serum was forced down her throat. Harry hid his face in Severus' chest, attempting to block out most of the questions and answers, he didn't want to hear her excuses, no matter her reasonings he raped him, he would never forgive her.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, everyone was on the edge of their seats when he closed it again and shook his head silently. He stood and went to turn away only to be yanked back and forced to sit. Sharp nails dug into his arm and he winced. "Hiya Harry!" Ginny's voice pierced the silent air that hung in the Great Hall like thick drapes.
"Father, Harry and I have some news." Draco took Harry's hand, glad that his father had already set up wards around the table.
Then his luck ran out. Harry was in the process of giving a pint when Draco stormed into the room, anger rising when he saw the scene before him. "THIS IS WHERE YOU'VE BEEN GETTING THE BLOOD!" Draco roared.
"Hagrid said that too, he said he thought I would look like my dad?" Harry frowned. "I don't know what he looked like so I don't know what's wrong with me."
-----
"That is all in the past now. We have time to relax now." It was a Friday and classes were over for both of them.
-----
"Soon...." Harry answered unsurely. "I mean I want this over quickly but I don't want them to plan things out to get off and I don't want-"
Harry quickly met Draco in the front room, startled by the smell of alcohol on his fiance's breath and the overall disheveled look. "Draco are you-"
"Father please I-"
"NO!" He clutched the closest thing, Snape's robe, "please don't send me home." He wouldn't be able to deal with the Dursley's. He'd barely been at school two and a half months.
-----
"Until next time." Draco kissed Harry deeply, leaving Harry panting heavily. With a flick of his wand their messes in their pants before smirking. "You know, those bruises are fetching on you." Draco teased with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
"You will tell me Harry Potter or I
"At the hospital-"
"Why not?" Neville asked curiously. "They aren't that bad, I mean they are pretty good compared to a lot of other contracts out there. Whoever made it obviously wanted you two to be in a healthy relationship. There is no possibility for abuse, no cheating, no manipulations, he will care for you, protect you, provide for you! I mean I wouldn't be concerned. He loves his magic too much to not follow the rules." Neville blushed when he realized everyone was looking at him.
-----
"H-" Harry went to say 'hello' but was cut off by the blond boy.
"Go on to lunch," Professor Snape waved them away, but Harry didn't budge. "Harry?"
"You'll be staying here. Uncle Sev will come by after you relax a bit to help you set up a password."
look me in the eyes when I talk to you Mister Potter," Snape demanded and Harry let out a nervous, emotional exhale before meeting the eyes of the dour man, gasping when he felt something that he could only describe as someone poking his brain. A second later, memories began to flash in front of his mind and much to his horror the memory from the night before started to play in his head.
"Uh, yeah, sure. What is it?" He made room for Dean to sit with him.
“Resist him, Harry,” Dean encouraged, giving him an easy smile before turning his full attention back to his boyfriend. It wasn’t that easy, though. Feeling what Draco felt made it impossible to resist him. Harry couldn’t stop how completely in tune he seemed to be with the Slytherin.
“Oh,” was all that Harry could manage.
“Of course, she is! Why wouldn’t she be? Why would she ever agree with the guy she actually agreed to go on a date with?”
The next morning, Harry was exhausted as his friends were getting ready for breakfast. He pushed his glasses onto his face and took a deep breath before getting out of bed. Ron, who was already dressed, sat on the edge of his bed to put on his shoes.
Harry pulled his coat tighter against him as he walked against the wind. It was early December, there were only a few weeks until the Yule Ball. He hadn’t even gotten to the lake when he was hit with a jinx, falling back on his ass as he wildly looked for the source, and who should he see but Pansy Parkinson. As he tried to stand, he heard another bang and was pushed back into the snow. She made her way in front of him, hands on her hips, her wand still in her right fist. “I am getting so fucking tired of you, Potter,” She yelled, her voice not nearly as loud in the wind as it was coming out. He went to reach for his own wand, but her foot stomped on it as he went for his pocket. He could kick her, easily, but then he could see the tears leaving streaks along her frozen cheeks. “Why couldn’t you just leave him alone?”
“Want to talk about it?”
His eyes adjusted to the dark quickly and he wasn't sure whether to calm down or panic more when he recognized the dark face in front of him. Draco radiated calmness, though, allowing Harry to relax. When the Slytherin was certain Harry wouldn't yell out, he removed his hand. "What the hell?" Harry hissed, keeping quiet in case Snape were to walk by and hear him. He'd be the one to get in trouble.
Harry spent a good half hour wandering the more abandoned parts of the castle before he finally came face to face with the Fat Lady, muttering whatever nonsense password had replaced the last. When she swung open, he immediately returned to his dormitory, not wanting anything to deal with anyone. But, of course, someone had to already be in the dorm. He sat down, silent, and dug out a book about Quidditch, in hopes that his dorm mate would remain silent if he started to read. He got less than a page in before he was interrupted. "Everyone knows Rita's a liar. The Slytherins aren't even having fun with it anymore." Dean kicked off his shoes and sat on his own bed, trying to reassure him by saying, "By tomorrow, everyone will have forgotten."
When the portrait swung open, Harry was immediately relieved to see Ron and Hermione sitting together on the couch. Harry sat on the ground in front of the couch, next to Hermione’s legs. Straight ahead of him, Dean sat, studying, with a couple Gryffindors he, himself, had never really spoken to. Dean gave him a worried look, as he had left quite some time after Harry had, yet Harry got to the common room quite some time after Dean had. Harry just smiled and shrugged, and Dean returned to his work. “What happened to you, Harry? I thought you were right behind us,” Hermione asked, nudging him with her knee softly.
They were both smiling, and Harry felt exactly as Ron did. There was no way that their friendship wasn’t written in the stars, or whatever Trelawney would call it. It was no accident that the only empty seat Harry could find was with Ron. “Thanks, Ron.”
“No, I’d like that… I just can’t believe you’d be willing to. Especially after you got quoted turning me down.”
Harry could feel pain in his chest, but it wasn’t his own pain. His eyes met Draco’s as he looked up, the blond shaking his head quickly, trying to tell Harry that Draco did not say any of that. But Harry already knew, and he weakly smiled at the worried boy. Ron was seething, pissed off that Malfoy was calling his girlfriend (though it wasn’t official, Ron was waiting until he was allowed to call her that) a mudblood, pissed that that bitch Rita would publish that, even with the poor excuse of censoring. He nearly leapt out of his chair to fight Malfoy when Harry grabbed his arm.
Harry had a lot to think about while lying in his bed. He tried to think about every person he'd ever had a crush on. He really liked Cho, but why? She made him feel good about himself, sure. So, were the feelings actually romantic or just because of her kindness? It was the same with Ginny, too. Was he only into girls who fueled his ego?
“Dear readers, I have the official scoop on Harry Potter’s attempt at getting
“I have no control of it. I’d make it stop if I could,” Draco said honestly, minutes after the original question was posed.
"Wonder what Malfoy was up to," Neville whispered, nodding towards the blond who was only now sitting down. "Nothing good, I bet." Harry kept his mouth shut, for the time being, not wanting anyone other than his closest friends to know what Malfoy was really doing. He was glad he got out of that room before anything really happened. He didn't know Malfoy's true intentions, but he didn't figure he wanted to find out.
In an attempt at humor, Harry offered another question, “If you hate Pansy so much, why do you keep her around? Every time you’re with her, all I can feel is your irritation.”
“Don’t go out alone. If she gets the chance again, you know she’ll take it,” Draco finished as he added their final ingredients. As he stirred, Harry looked behind him to look at Pansy, who was giving him the most disturbing smirk, as though she was imagining killing him. The programs Dudley watched on the television taught him that girls were uncontrollable when they were upset, but he thought that was an exaggeration because he’d never experienced that fear until his eyes met Pansy’s.
Harry remember Hedwig’s note, after the chaos had died down. Ron and Hermione were too focused on each other to notice Harry rip open the envelope. Scrawled on it in neat handwriting are the words, “Sixth floor disused boy’s lavatory, after dinner?” Harry tucked the note in his robe pocket, looking forward to their next meeting.
“Go to the Yule Ball with me,” Draco said suddenly, looking at Harry’s face for some indication of how the comment made him feel. Harry was completely taken aback.
“Let’s make it a night to remember, shall we?”
“That’s what I was doing, too. I didn’t realize you’d come out here.”
Pansy Parkinson, and even if I wasn’t, I have standards. Standards that he could never
“Ha, yeah, thank you. What were you doing out here, anyways?”
"I'm sure you've heard the whispers about you with Draco, right?"
Back at the common room, Harry was greeted only by Hermione, who sat by the fire, working on her seventh page of an essay that was only required four pages. “Ron’s been dragged off to test some of Fred and George’s newest creations. And I mean dragged.” Harry could already imagine the torture Ron was enduring at that very moment. “Are you okay, Harry?” She asked, noticing how off his normal attitude seemed off in a way that she couldn’t put words to.
“I took a walk. Thought it might help me clear my head,” Ron admitted, removing his scarf from his neck now that they were indoors.
"For how often you do that to me, one would think that you are the one pining for me rather than it being the other way around. What do you want from me, huh? Want me to give in so you can tell Rita how Harry Potter kissed you? How disgusted you were that you pushed him away and ran to tell everyone how terrible he is?" Harry rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest. "I'm not that easy to manipulate." Before Draco had the chance to say anything, Harry was out of the room.
“He’ll get over it,” Harry said bitterly, shrugging his shoulders.
“All right, you’ve worn me down. I’ll be your date,” Harry teased.
"Hermione's probably waiting to walk with us," he said as Harry worked on getting dressed. He didn't reply as he buttoned his shirt, pushing his shoes on at the same time. Ron looked uncomfortable, to say the least. Once Harry was ready, the two of them walked down the staircase. Hermione jumped from where she'd been sitting, smiling wider than necessary. "Morning, boys!"
“I heard about what Pansy did. She told me her father taught her an unforgivable curse… and she planned on testing it on you. I’ve tried talking to her, telling her that out friendship has nothing to do with yours and my,” Draco hesitated, trying to find an appropriate word that wouldn’t imply anything Harry might not be ready for, “situation.”
"What was that about?" Harry was shocked and confused. Never once did he 'act like they had something.' Sure, he'd liked her, but she was his best friend's sister. He shook the thoughts from his head and looked to his friends for help.
"What did Dean give you?" Ron asked, searching through his bag for his Divination homework.
Ron’s eyebrows furrowed in anger, standing suddenly before storming out of the dormitory, leaving just before Dean Thomas entered.
"He was being a git," Harry muttered, hoping she was only talking about angry looks the two had shared before she was dragging him away.
“Who said I did anything?” He asked, laughing with Harry, though.
It occurred again, after the first of the Triwizard Tournament task. Draco baited Harry once more after he passed the first task, pushing him hard as he tried to leave the forest. They were in each other's faces, throwing insults as usual, when Harry got that urge to kiss his opponent. For a second, Draco thought it was going to happen. Harry pushed him back against a tree, something between hatred and lust seemed to hang between them. Harry's face was inches from the Slytherin's, but instead of kissing him, he just rolled his eyes and turned away from the blond. Harry swore he heard a whisper saying, "What a tease."
“I know you think this is a bad decision, but… I don’t know what happened, Hermione. You’re going to think I’m crazy, but I can feel what he feels. Something… changed. I can’t justify any of his past actions, but honestly, Hermione, I think he’s just been looking for attention that is for him, as a person, instead of from him being part Veela.”
"It's because he's part Veela, it's got to be."
"Harry, Hedwig was looking for you. I promised her I'd give it to you. I didn't want it to fall into the wrong hands," Dean slipped a folded piece of parchment into Harry's hand as he passed by. Harry nodded in thanks, tucking it into his trouser pocket. Dean was a good friend, there was no denying that. The two had gotten closer since they became aware of the whole Malfoy ordeal. Dean was the only one who believed him and felt the same way.
“I already told Hermione. She’s on my side, Ron…”
“I asked him about that after he asked me—”
Hermione wasn't the only one who couldn't forget about their face-to-face. Whispers went through the hall about the way Harry Potter was looking at Draco Malfoy, not with contempt but something that could be seen as positive-- admiration, maybe. Draco enjoyed the teasing Harry got, feeling better about the rejection.
“Oh… Well, lucky I had been there before she did something she’d regret.”
"It's Rita Skeeter--her latest article, Harry; It's about you. " Neville handed him the Daily Prophet, trembling slightly. Harry snatched the paper, needing to know what was going on. Right on the first page, Rita's article glared at him. Famous Harry Potter is Taken with a New Student at Hogwarts.
"But I've never really thought about it. I've always pushed those thoughts aside." When Dudley was younger, Aunt Petunia would call her son a lady's man. While being quite untrue because there was no way Dudley had ever dated anyone (or would ever land a decent woman), it imprinted on him that boys being with girls was the only option. Whenever the television talked about being gay, Uncle Vernon would call it a disease. He'd say they needed to be put down because they were sick. Him being with a man hadn't really seemed like an option.
Harry frowned, seeing how serious she was. "You're right, I guess..." She wasn't right, but he didn't want to argue or admit something he wasn't sure of yet. The books were pushed away into Hermione's bag and the two walked back to the Gryffindor common rooms, meeting Ron along the way. You could tell just by looking at him that he was jealous, but neither Hermione nor Harry said anything to reassure him. They'd tried too many times; it would only fall on deaf ears. The three of them entered the portrait together.
"Can I talk to you?" Dean asked, leaning over the back of the couch to look at Harry.
"Try to keep your distance for a while--from Malfoy, I mean-- if he can't get close to you, he can't do whatever it is he does. If you can't get away for whatever reason, focus on something else. I, uh... I focus on Seamus. It helps me remember who I actually like," Dean grins sheepishly. "Don't tell anyone yet. He's not ready for it to be a public thing. Especially not after today." The article made him worry about what kind of attention their relationship would get, but Dean didn't mention that.
a date to the Yule Ball! Everyone has been curious about who the Boy Who Lived
He narrowed his eyes at her, leaning closer and talking in something just above a growl, "I highly doubt he's yours anyways. If the stick up his ass is any indication, he has high standards. Standards that you could never meet."
“So now you’re worried that Ron will freak out because he hates the Malfoys more than most,” she said, knowing Ron’s thoughts on Draco and Lucius more than anyone, and he nodded before she continued, “I can’t help you, but you have to tell him before it becomes public. He’ll be hurt if you don’t tell him.”
“He asked you?”
“I’m sorry that Draco said no,” she said sadly, like she knew the feeling of rejection all too well.
“She basically quoted something I’d said to her… “
meet. Pathetic, honestly. I hear he can’t even go with that m-------d, Granger,
Telling Ron was much easier than he’d expected, but his reaction still wasn’t what Harry had hoped for. Disbelief he expected, but it was obvious that Ron genuinely thought that he had gone insane.
"Snape sat down a couple minutes ago. Where were you?" Ron asked, taking a bite from his dessert, as Harry had been forced to arrive so late. Hurrying so that he'd be able to eat, Harry piled food onto his plate and started shoveling food into his mouth. He waved off the question, hungrier than he'd been since he came to Hogwarts, leaving behind the abusive Dursleys. Before, he was used to only eating enough to survive. With daily feasts, he was never truly hungry anymore. His friends sent him food via owl during the summers now, too, so he was hardly hungry at, what he was forced to call, home. It was a better life, after knowing Hogwarts. Everything was better, really. Nightmares of the closet under the stairs still haunted him, but he was no longer forced under there. What if he hadn't been accepted to Hogwarts? Where would he be now? Harry forced himself to focus on the conversations around him instead of thinking about the Dursley's and the hell they put him through.
"Yeah, I've heard. That's what this is about? I'm not in love with Malfoy like everyone seems to think."
“Are you listening to yourself? Why don’t we see what Hermione thinks?” Ron was under the impression that Hermione would fully agree with him. Harry hesitated before setting him straight.
Let’s hope he can find a date soon. Can’t have a victor showing up alone, now can we?
“How’d you know it was her?”
"But?"
"It?" Ron asked.
“Ron was muttering to himself as I walked by.” Dean laughed and shrugged, continuing, “I mean, go for it, man. If you think that it’s possible that your feelings aren’t directed related to him being a Veela, I don’t see why it’s a bad idea. I mean, I do, because everyone knows that you two are like rival enemies or something, but if that’s why you want, don’t let anyone stop you.”
without consequence."
because she’s already got a date with his best friend.” Of course, we had to censor the
When Harry laid down that night, nothing seemed to be fixed. In fact, his head felt like an unsolvable puzzle. The more he thought, the more scrambled things became. The only thing he was sure of was that completely straight people didn't have to reassure themselves that they were straight. He wished this was like another class, with information he could get from a book. There were no books to tell him how to feel or what to do. He'd experiment, but he just wasn't that type of person. He didn't want to risk more rumors or the possibility of hurting someone who actually liked him.
"Why didn't you stop Ginerva Weasley after forcing Harry to take the potion?" Amelia asked she had been surprised by the previous answer. Maybe Ronald wasn't as involved as the others.
"Was this a one-one t-time thing?" Harry asked shyly, embarrassed and a little scared that everything would go back to how it was before and he didn't want that. He wanted more, more with Draco.
Harry ignored Ginny's call, he pushed past Hermione who was trying to get his attention and he shrugged off Ron's appendage that grabbed him. He slipped under his covers before silently sobbing into his soft pillows before slipping into a restless sleep filled with Draco's stinging words and the near death looking blonde.
"They certainly will. Now I need to know who you want to know about this. How quickly do you want the public to know because they will find out, and how soon do you want me to take it up with the Minister himself?"
"I-" Harry tried to say something, he didn't know what it was going to be, but Ginny interrupted.
"Merlin Harry! I swear you've never been such an asshole!" Ron growled. Harry just stared back at them unresponsive. "See! All you do is stare and say nothing!" Ron took a threatening step forward but Harry just sighed softly.
"I've never been with-" Harry hung his head, no longer able to look his soon to be Dominate in the eyes, especially after that speech. "I've never been with anyone. I don't think we will ev-"
"I don't know where you got that idea, Miss. Weasley but Heir Black and Malfoy have had a marriage contract between them since before either of them was born." Lucius' smooth voice drifted over all the teens as he walked past the Gryffindors and towards his son. "Draco, Harrison Potter, are you both ready for the lunch we have planned?" He lifted an eyebrow at his son and nodded when Draco offered an arm for his boyfriend? Sub?
"But-" Draco smirked, pecking Harry's small frown, "I have enjoyed you far more than I enjoyed the others," Draco admitted, playing with the soft raven hair, surprised by the content feeling that welled in his chest.
"Very good, now we have more important things to focus on." Severus gently prodded Harry's shoulder until he startled awake.
"Yes." Severus nodded before turning back to Harry, who was sleeping peacefully.
"Severus..... Potter." He spat distastefully. Severus glared at the man with all the anger he had felt that day and wanted to smirk when the blond flinched only slightly. He pulled Harry into a standing position, one hand still resting on Harry's shoulder.
"What!" Harry shouted, eyes wide and his mouth agape. "How? Why?"
-----
"Still ignoring us?!" Hermione put her nose high in the air and slapped him, the sound was sharp. "Well?!" She screeched. Harry just at unresponsive, his eyes looking up to make eye contact with the pale blue eyes of the blonde vampire who stared back. Something tight constricted in Harry's chest.
"I'm sorry," tears and snot covered the boy's face, his voice thick with emotion as he sobbed, body hunched and chained. "I didn't know, I'm sorry!" a calming draught was gently tipped into Ron's mouth. It took a few moments for his cries to settle to sniffles and for his body to stop shaking. An Auror stepped forward and gently magicked the snot and tears from the boy's face.
"Ah, Lucius, what can I do for you?" She waved him into her office, sending stern glances at those paying attention to her guest instead of their work. She closed the door before sitting at her desk.
"Mr. Potter, you are welcome to make use of Malfoy Manor for however long you need." The offer caused some surprise to show on the faces of many adults.
Still, his smaller friend was silent. Recognizing the need for some peace, Draco sat down on the couch and gently coaxed Harry into a cuddle. Breakfast started in little over an hour and classes an hour after that, so they had time to decompress and soak up some comfort before Harry was, metaphorically, sold to his abuser.
Severus sat with George at his side while Fred pulled Harry into his lap. Severus nearly laughed at the cooing, glad that his husbands got to see their longtime friend again.
"What are- are you
"I could ask the same Potter." The blonde stayed on the ground, panting heavily, sweat drenched his robes and he looked pale - er than normal - and he was shaking like he was freezing.
Ronald's apparent manipulation by his family and Albus Dumbledore was also resulting in outraged exclamations from many witches and wizards. The Neutral side was most sympathetic, a majority of the Light blinding themselves to the truth because of their faith in Dumbledore, and some of the Dark wanting any reason to put more of the Light family out of commission. However, there was a good chunk of Light and Dark that empathized with being manipulated or lied to, the boy's tears hurting them enough to hope for only a fine on the boy's behalf.
-----
Harry felt like he should
"Ron.... He's str-straight." His words were slurred as he drifted between awareness and darkness.
"We want to fulfill the contract." Draco was hesitant, he was more than aware that his father was not a fan of Harry nor was their Lord.
"How often?" Draco felt dread drop in his stomach like an anvil.
"PROTEGO!" Fred and George shouted at the same time, shooting up to stand at Harry's sides.
He thought in embarrassment, turning around an scooting out from under the sink, standing unevenly as he continued to laugh humorlessly, tears still staining his cheeks.
"Lucius Malfoy."
"You will feed no one but me, you will be on a strict diet, only certain foods, no desserts-"
"Oh, because people
"Hard day, Severus?" Lucius inquired, surprise in his eyes as he gazed at his old friend.
"I would like to ask the court for permission to perform the pregnancy confirmation spell," Malfoy spoke, secretly amused when the Weasley girl hissed in rage, eyes burning as she shook in an attempt to free herself of the chains. The court voted in favor of his request, Lucius was pleased he could get an answer for the child in the gallery.
"No!" Harry was mentally screaming at his body to move to the door but it was refusing to move, he just stood still, his body shivering as a cold sweat broke out over his body. "Please don't make me talk about it." He was close to weeping in shame.
"Distract itty bitty Ronniekins." Fred grinned evilly.
"It's a blood quill. Usually, I only have to use it three hours but it was four tonight." He answered automatically.
"That is, if she
"Child?" Harry was tugged back to reality by the gentle voice.  "Child, we must go now." Snape let his hand fall to Harry's shoulder blade and calmly pulled Harry into the fireplace before flooing them to Malfoy Manor.
Harry held his hand tightly, hissing curses under his breath as he stumbled down the staircase. The detention was brutal that night and an hour longer than normal. He felt lightheaded and fell against the stone wall for support for at least ten minutes. Time seemed to escape him as he closed his eyes, mind swirling and eyes swimming so much he couldn't see straight.
“You act like that could’ve ever happened without magic.”
They walked into the Great Hall, hand in hand. For the first time in his life, Harry didn’t care about the staring. He squeezed Draco’s hand, appreciating the warm wave of affection he felt come off of his date.
"Try to focus on what you feel towards everyone you see. Don't push it down anymore," Hermione replied just before they were dismissed. The three of them left together, and Harry did as Hermione suggested. As they walked, he paid special attention to anyone who caught his eye. Luna, with her bright pink headband with some sort of creature on top, was just too difficult not to notice. Then his eyes found Ernie Macmillan. He wasn't unattractive, they were sort of friends. Ernie smiled at him before ducking into his next class. Did he feel any way towards Ernie besides friendly? Harry didn't think so, but then it seemed quite hard not to think of all the nice things about his friend that he might be attracted towards. He had soft-looking hair, a sweet smile, kind eyes. Then he saw Cho and, as usual, he's heart sped up. She waved at him as they passed, and he tried to figure out why she made him feel the way he did. She was pretty, no doubt about that. She made him feel appreciated. She was graceful in the way she waved her wand, and the way she carried herself. But was there more than that? He didn't know much about her, on a personal level. They hadn't had many conversations; he didn't even know if she had siblings. Maybe it was that she was obviously into him as well? The idea of it being possible for them to end up together was what made him so nervous. With other crushes, it was always one sided. Sure, Ginny was majorly in love with him, and maybe he liked her a bit as well, but the idea of them together was laughable. The Weasleys were his family, Ron was his best friend. There was no way the two could ever date.
-----
"So-So cl-close! Draco! Pl-Please." Harry moaned out, digging his fingers into Draco's shoulders as he rutted hurriedly against Draco, his climax only just out of reach. "Dr-Draco pl-please-oh like th-that, please." Harry whimpered, kissing Draco desperately, moaning into the kiss and rutting like a cat in heat.
Green and silver throw pillows were placed on the couches.
Submissive choose to do so.
"Not that either." Draco licked his bottom lip and Harry nearly lost all of his self-control.
"I am going to ignore that insult Potter, don't do it again, and I do but you won't like it."
This image is what greeted Professor Snape when the man came to check on him.
"Severus! I need blood replenishers!" Draco's voice called out. Harry slipped in eyelids closed and what could have been seconds or hours later he felt a vial at his lips. He absentmindedly opened his mouth and he felt a large, warm, hand massage his throat to aid the cold liquid down his throat.
"Ron ripped the cloak you gave Harry because Harry chose your date over Ron speaking to him and he's crying in the tower and I know y-"
"Come, Harry, we have a busy man to meet."
"Do you need help?" The boy asked, gesturing to Harry's trunk in front of him. Harry blushed in shame, embarrassed that he wasn't strong enough to lift the trunk himself. "No need to feel embarrassed, I couldn't even get my trunk onto the train without help in my first year. I was a twig and I'm not kidding."
He fell into a restless sleep, his body curled up around his still flat stomach.
with you just because you don't look like your dad. If anything you look like the boy version of your mum. I've seen a picture or two of them in textbooks. She had red hair and green eyes like yours." Cedric offered with an encouraging smile. "When did you run into Mr. Hagrid? He's the gamekeeper here."
"Yeah?" Draco prompted. Curious about what bothered his Sub.
What did you guys think?
"I don't understand....." Draco whispered, tears falling to the floor.
"Were you getting anything out of the situation?"
"That's good news Harry, I thought you wanted children," Severus asked confusedly.
"With me." Draco closed his double doors behind him, dimming the lights with his magic.
"Answer my questions and you can," Draco responded, sitting up straighter, his hold looser than before.
- and seemed to think before speaking again. "We can have it sent at breakfast and you can make it a scene before storming out. I will have to follow as I will be dominant in the relationship and I will be forced to comfort you in your distress as it will state in the contract."
Harry is taken to Malfoy Manor to talk to Lucius Malfoy via Severus Snape and it just so happens to be the weekend that Draco comes home because he misses his parents.
?" The blond asked in astonishment, a snort of amusement forcing its way out.
The Gryffindor was straining to keep her mouth closed, face red in exertion before the words exploded from her mouth. "Professor Dumbledore said Harry wouldn't live to graduation! There would be an accident." Tears quickly rolled down the girl's face, shame overcoming her at exposing the man's plan she had promised to keep safe and hidden.
"Thanks?" The bashful response provoked a smirk from the blond. "When you're not insulting me you look nice too....." The raven-haired boy quickly turned away and went back to his book before Draco even had the chance to move his lips.
The bell rang, and Harry took his time to pack up his belongings, tensing when Ron virtually dragged Hermione out of the room to get to lunch faster. Neville walked out with Dean and Seamus, a curious glance cast at Harry as he went. No doubt, the shy boy had wanted to ask why he had been absent from the tower for the weekend but had kept quiet throughout the class for fear of taking his attention off the Potion for even one second.
Harry dreaded Potions class. The last four years had been him dreading Potions class. Perhaps if they cycled through Potions professors as they had Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, he would actually have a chance at being good at with potions. Instead, he was stuck with a professor who hated him and his father, and who take every chance he could to make Harry look like a fool. Harry and Draco were partnered up once again, probably because Snape thought that it would ruin Harry’s day. The two got to work, working silently until the room was too loud and confusing with so many discussions that it was safe for them to talk.
"Mr. Malfoy! Perfect job," Snape praised, before looking at Harry. "Can't say the same for you, though, Mr. Potter. Work more diligently next time."
It wasn't for another week and a half that he had an encounter with a certain blond git. It was just a simple shoulder bump in the halls in between classes. He wouldn't think twice about it if it wasn't for the overwhelming ache that seemed to be in his heart. He had to lean against the wall for a minute just to catch his breath, it felt like he'd been punched in the chest. The only thought he could come up with was how he needed Draco more than air. When Ron grabbed his arm, asking what was wrong, he couldn't even form words. It wasn't until they were in their seats in Divination that he was able to tell Ron that he had just gotten a little dizzy because he hadn't had time to eat lunch. It was a poor excuse, but it was enough to stop the questions. He hardly was able to pay attention to class, but that was nothing out of the ordinary, he never paid attention to that class. It wasn't long before Trelawney predicted that something bad was going to happen to him, and he couldn't help but think that she was right.
The Gryffindor common room exploded in cheers when Harry walked through the portrait hole, and the party didn't die down until nearly one in the morning. A few remained spread out on the couches and chairs, not ready to sleep yet. Harry and Dean Thomas were among the who had yet to retire.
As he stood much too close, Draco's sneer turned into a smirk, as though he could tell what Harry was thinking. He probably caught the quick glance Harry cast towards his lips. He was able to push away the thought, not knowing if it was his own conscious thought or Draco's will. He had maybe considered what it would be like kissing the blond before, but never while under his charm, though he would deny any allegations. He couldn't tell if the look on Draco's face was shock from him being able to resist or just his normal irritating look of pride, like he was too good for Harry to even be in his presence. Hermione grabbed his sleeve and dragged him away. "What was that about?" She asked. Of course, she wouldn't know about Draco, she couldn't feel his powers radiate through her when they were close. She probably didn't even notice the dreamy gazes others gave him.
Harry stood up quickly, clenching the paper in his fists. Hermione grabbed his arm in an attempt to stop him from whatever he was planning, but he pulled away and made his way to the Slytherin table. This time, the entire Great Hall was silent as Harry approached Draco's usual group. Pansy stood up, hands on her hips. "You can't have him!" The table erupted with laughter and jeers towards Harry.
“Don’t act so shocked. As I was saying, I asked him, and he told me that he didn’t have anything planned, he was just hoping that something would happen between us before it became obvious that it was an empty threat.” Hermione accepted the answer but didn’t tell Harry that she would be keeping an eye on Malfoy as long as they were involved until she was certain he did not have any other motives.
“I don’t hate her. She’s my best friend, even if it doesn’t seem like it. Whenever you’re around, she paws at me like I’m a toy she refuses to share. I hate that, not her,” he answered, and they sink into silence. It would probably feel uncomfortable to Harry, if not for Draco’s relaxation. If someone had told him a month ago that he would be sitting in an abandoned corridor with Draco Malfoy for any reason other than to hex him, he’d laugh and tell them that’s impossible. Then, suddenly, Harry could feel the thought of kissing Malfoy crawl into his mind. When he turned to look at the Slytherin, who was already looking at him, Harry rolled his eyes and couldn’t help but laugh at the hopeful look Draco wears. “You know… Instead of making me want to kiss you, you could just kiss me.” And that’s all it took for Draco to eliminate the space between them, the pale fingers an extreme contrast to the dark jaw that they skimmed as their lips tentatively met. Even as it was Harry’s first kiss, he knew that the way it felt wasn’t normal; that feeling of being washed in warmth had returned, more intense than ever. It took them quite a bit of spending time together before Harry would realize that the warm feeling was Draco’s own happiness. Draco wouldn’t admit it for a long time, but that feeling Harry had, of wanting to kiss him, had nothing to do with his magic.
The process repeated a total of ten times before Harry could finally think - and see - clearly. He blinked slowly before he took in the room he was in. Plush white carpets covered the floors. Two black couches - one he was sitting on - and a matching armchair were placed strategically around the room so that it looked warm but professional. A calm fireplace warmed the entire room.
"He does, I believe he and Narcissa dueled for a bit, two hours I think before she was too exhausted to continue."
"That was the effect of your words," Severus said with a clipped tone, pleased when all Draco could do was gape with wide eyes.
"Legal, Mister Potter would like to press charges." Severus looked at the small child and wanted to scoop him up and hold him and keep him away from all prying eyes and away from the public.
Harry quickly got to his feet and trailed silently behind the tall man, finding immediate comfort when he entered the office.  He relaxed immediately, his shoulders slumping and he sighed, relief flooding him. At first, he didn't understand why he was so relieved but after a few seconds of thought, he realized it was the first time he had felt safe after the night before. The dorm was like the murder scene, the common room just filled him with anxiety. In classes, he was forced to be next to the people who helped someone hurt him in the worst way possible. The Great Hall was full of anxiety because of his - former? - friends watched him closely and tried to talk to him while the Headmaster seemed to bore into his soul with criticism and disappointment.
and will do whatever in his power to soothe the worries.
Harry let out a moan of pleasure as he felt his dwindling supply of blood drain even further. Only seconds after the blonde started feeding did he stop, licking the wound closed quickly. He still looked sickly as he shakily stood, dragging Harry up and down the halls.
"Flattery will get you nowhere Mister Malfoy." Harry blushed as he moved past Draco in the narrow aisles. "I'm never going to eat all of those," Harry whined playfully when he felt Draco's arms wrap around his midsection and pull him back gently, laughing gently in his ear.
"I don't know! Apparently, there was a marriage contract between the Malfoy's and the Black's and I'm Heir Black? I don't know about the last part but Malfoy said that all contracts are approved by Gringotts and according to them I'm the Heir, I don't know how." Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously. "He wasn't very happy with the terms."
-----
"Get a room!" Harry and Draco turned to see a large group of people. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione. Next to them were scowling Slytherins, Theo, Blaise, Pansy, Daphne, Crabbe, and Goyle.
"Can I sit here?" A warm, kind, voice asked from the left. Harry turned to the compartment door to see a tall boy with a perfect smile looking at him questioningly.
Attempted line-theft and conspiracy to murder were both charges that required a closed session, so press and anyone not important to the case, or a member of Wizengamot, was not allowed in the courtroom. Lucius was questioning the suspects on behalf of Harry and, therefore could not be the adult sat in the gallery, having his pick Harry choose Severus Snape, the only other adult he trusted at the time.
- The Submissive must bring forward his concerns to his Dominate.
Ron was released quickly and lost another twenty points from Poppy Pomfrey while the Medi-Witch fussed over Harry.
"Lucius, stop scaring him, Harry, come here my darling." Narcissa smiled lovingly at both her husband and her soon to be son-in-law if what her son told her a few minutes ago was anything to go by.
doing anything that will affect the Submissive's life in any way, shape or form.
"What Longbottom?" There was still distaste but no disdain.
"I am anything but gross Po-Harry, and I am a little more than displeased by that accusation. I am more than well versed in pleasure and as much as you've experienced I can assure you that I will be the best, no matter what the Weasel of yours thinks he can do." He growled lowly, wrapping his arms possessively around Harry's waist, pulling him closer.
"Or something else-"
"I-I'm so sorry!" Harry sobbed.
"Wh-What?" Harry blushed, turning to him as he closed his book, a bookmark - where had he gotten that - marking his page. Their faces were close as Harry had been leaning up against Draco's chest, his arm around the other. "What happened to me being a half-blood scum?" The Gryffindor asked nervously, cheeks burning.
He understood now that if he had grown up catered to by elves and was taught that they were less than him and his own servant was freed from him by the kid that had killed the one man that could kill and torture his family he would have been pretty upset too. "I want to press charges," Harry admitted pitifully.
Several minutes later and Harry's magic settled, his voice cracking before finally giving out. His nails were caked with blood and his magic was tired. He let himself be pulled into a chest before he promptly fell asleep,
"What was that?" Draco asked, awe clear in his voice.
"Fine. I don't care that much anyway, with my luck Umbridge will kill me before the year is over." Everything after the first word was muttered quietly but Draco still heard but he didn't comment.
Harry saw Draco walk out of the Great Hall. He quickly shoved two forkfuls of mash potatoes into his mouth before standing. "I forgot my Potions homework, I'll meet you guys there."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Father I-"
Harry swayed slowly, not noticing the worry in both the pale blue eyes and the deep pools of onyx that watched him closely. He was silent for a total of five minutes and Severus was about to ask again. "I had a detention with Umbridge. She was really man today so she made me write lines an hour longer." He answered slowly. He continued his rapid blinking, not wanting to fall asleep.
"He can't do that Ron, it would be a violation of the contract, Harry is the Submissive." Neville voiced from where he was reading a tome on Exotic Plants on his bed.
Draco was stopped from leaving the Ministry by his father's eagle. Draco summoned a treat for the bird before deciding to visit his mother and father instead of reading the letter. He quickly apparated to his home, confused when he found his father already waiting for him.
"When he was brought under control, I would get money and books from the Potter Vaults." Her response caused some exclaims for her wand to be snapped from some of the members. Line-theft was one of the most series charges to be brought forth to the Wizengamot, all members had their own House to care for, and the idea of someone stealing it always caused anger.
To know that those he had truly believed to be his family had only been after his money, something he would have given all away for a real family was too much, he young child felt his tears overflow from his eyes, and he excused himself and quickly found himself alone in a bathroom.
"No, Dad, I did. I let him here, I purposed to him when all he wanted was our money." Draco growled.
Immediately Harry came alive when they entered the library. He took to wandering the aisles, a smile of mirth on his face as he walked deeper and deeper into the library. Draco followed, watching as interest overtook the previously sad face. He pulled all the books that Harry even showed the slightest of interest in off the shelves and levitated them behind himself until Harry grabbed his own book and sat down on one of the bay windows.

It was a blessing that he only had two classes that day, a Double Potions in the morning, and a Double Transfiguration in the afternoon with a free period after lunch.
give up his tart.
"Okay." Harry shifted his weight slightly before leaning forward and resting his head against Draco's shoulder, letting himself relax. "Can we take a nap? I don't want to be tired when we have astronomy later."
"Mother?! Too exhausted?!" Draco couldn't help but be dumbfounded.
"Ginny Weasley," Harry whispered like he was afraid that even saying her name would summon her to them.
"Yes!" She hissed heatedly.
"If the clauses aren't in the final contract then I will lose my magic." He stated evenly, ignoring the look of shock on the Gryffindor's face.
"Glad you could join us Mister Potter." Snape drawled, the doors slamming against the stone causing all the students in the room to turn and look at him. He saw Ron glaring at him, cheeks red with anger. Hermione looked disappointed in him and a bit angry, she turned up her nose at him and turned away with her arms crossed over her chest. "Would you like to explain to the class why you are fifteen minutes later Mister Potter?" His voice was quiet and slow but Harry heard every word.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry..." The man sounded so sad and worried that Harry broke down into tears, falling into the man's chest as his shoulder heaved with his pain. "Shhhhh child."
"It seems father and mother created a new one before I was born." He hissed, glancing at Blaise who was leaning over Theo's shoulder and talking with him quietly.
"That would be Rape Uncle Sev," Draco answered timidly, glancing at Potter with sad eyes. "Is that what happened to him?"
"Why were you-"
"Hey, Potter!" Draco's voice shouted and Harry paused in the corridor. A quick scan of the surroundings made Harry aware that no one else was around to witness anything that Draco might do.
"Pensive...." Harry closed his eyes and tensed when he felt the tip of a wand against his temple.
"He's the one that picked me up from my relative's home." Harry smiled happily at the memory. "It was amazing! Uncle Vernon was pointing a shotgun at him and Hagrid just grabbed it and folded it like it was nothing!"
Harry walked up the steps after Hagrid, he was quiet, no one around him seemed to notice him or they didn't want to talk to him. He stopped when the stern-looking witch started talking. He tuned it out, instead, he looked around him at the giant stone walls, the talking portraits and the murmuring classmates around him. Before he knew it the woman left and the noise increased.
"Rape."
He sat down next to the smiling teen, a fond smile on his own face when Harry quickly snuggled into his side before turning his attention to the book in his hands.
"I will buy you gifts, things to prove to you that I'd do to show you that I would be a good husband. Courtships usually go on until the couple breaks up or stops once the engagement is sealed completely."
Harry yawned as he rolled off of Draco and spelled his shoes to the ground. Draco rolled his eyes and transfigured their clothes into sleepwear and kicked his shoes off as well before climbing under the sheets and pulling them over both himself and Harry.
"You know you don't have to say things like that, no one is even around." Harry panted softly, his nose a little red from the cold.
"Who?"
"You are my everything Harry and I want everyone to know." Draco pulled out a box from his coat, opening it slowly and presenting it to the silently crying man in front of him. "Will you be mine Harry, in name, soul, and love?" Draco asked, holding his breath.
"Oh, it's a muggle thing that kills people. You put bullets in them and you point them at people and pull a small trigger - kinda like a switch - and the bullet flies out and it can go through skin and bone sometimes. If the bullet gets stuck you have to pull it out and that hurts a lot. Anyways during wars, Muggles used them to kill people."
"And your proof?"

"Oh, well muggles have lots of wars. I learned in primary school about World War II-"

"What about Ron?" Draco asked instead, leaning closer until their noses were a hair away from touching.
"What?" Harry asked, slowly slipping off of Draco's lap, letting himself be pulled up and pulled back to the parchment that was covered in glass.
"Come stay with us for a few days, I don't think you going back to your apartment is the best thing right now. The twins and I have more than enough room. We can work things out from there." Severus offered and after a few minutes of arguing Harry agreed.
"You know her?" Draco asked, walking over to sit next to his Sub.

Harry just about fell to his knees and screamed when he felt Draco's hand wrap around his dick and stroke quickly. Harry bit into Slytherin's outer robe, a silent scream caused a fleeting moment of pure bliss. "You look so sexy like this, all desperate and needy. And you can't even make a sound, lest you friends find you, with the enemies hand wrapped around your hot, thick, and oh so virgin cock." Draco whispered into Harry's ear while Ron and Hermione argued about Parseltongue and if it can even be taught and/or learned.
"It is done. Would you like to view them with me, Harry?" Lucius asked politely before nodding when Harry shook his head. "Severus, if you would come with me, I'd like to view them in my personal office, I would like to talk to you after about what the Blood Traitors and the Old Coot are guilty of."
"You have no reason to apologize child." Harry didn't know why being referred to as 'child' was comforting to him while being called 'boy' made him a little irritated and angry.
He felt when Lucius joined them in the sitting room, he could feel his presence.
"She is of Prewett blood; they were always very fertile." They both paused. "However you are right, if Harry is as miserable as you say, no doubt more than even you would have noticed, I cannot justify keeping him in such a state to avoid some favors. I will talk to Amelia tonight, tell Harry that he should expect to be taken out of school before classes start, I will be there to invite him back to the Manor formally, his lack of talk about family concerns me, I don't believe he wants to be with them."
"That's great Harry! You've always wanted your own kids!" Fred bounced Harry gently.
Harry shook slightly, leaning into Severus' side as the frozen body of Ginny was settled in the chair and the chains wrapped around her like snakes.
Ron and Ginny are brought before the court.
"I just thought that after one night Harry and Ginny would be together, I knew Ginny liked Harry and Mum told me after they fell in love they'd get graduated and-and-and that Harry would forgive us for forcing him to drink that potion because he would fall in love with Ginny." The ease at which the words flowed proved the fourteen-year-olds compliance, the shuddering shoulder, and great heaving sobs genuine as the serum made it impossible for the boy to even lie to himself as to the reasonings he had been telling himself as the guilt ate him up since that fateful night.
Walking into the Great Hall took Harry's breath away. He was in awe of the floating candles, the charmed roof and the thrum of magic.
"That would be rape Father," Draco answered meekly.
over the world either sent troops of people to help and almost everyone was involved. Anyways there was a man, he believed that everyone who was Jewish - Jewdism is a type of religion and if you practiced it then you were Jewish - should die because he thought they were below him. He wanted perfect people to breed with perfect people. He didn't want Jews to breed with other humans so he built armies of soldiers called 'Nazi's' and they gathered all the Jews into concentration camps where they were forced to do manual labor if they were physically well enough and if they were they were sent into what was basically a giant oven and they were burned alive.
When the morning dawned for the trials Harry had waited for Professor Snape to floo over so they could all leave together. Lucius had made his way to the courtroom while Professor Snape guided Harry to the check-in desk, after checking their wands the woman gave them tags and gushed over Harry for a few minutes before Snape snapped at her to do her job. After finalizing their check-in the two made their way to the courtroom and was quickly ushered to the gallery.
-----
"We won't ever get that far Potter - Harry, I should start calling you Harry - but if you ever want to seek pleasure I am the ideal partner-"
The Governors and Aurors followed Snape out of the hall, the second they left the hall burst into noise.
"What is your problem, Harry! You've been ignoring us all week!" Hermione glared daggers at her first friend.
"Can't you put Harry's name down as a victim?"
Please be patient with me
Harry noticed Ron, Ginny and Hermione freeze and look at each other in panic. "What Muggle-born pamphlets? I didn't get any."
"How do you always know everything?!" Ron exclaimed in awe, staring at their friend in the way that made Harry's heart pang.
"Not until after Harry took the potion." The answered surprised Lucius who stepped closer, slightly amused when the boy glared at him.
"Yes." Potter sighed in defeat. "And he's straight and fancies 'Mione."
"You don't understand! I can't go back there, don't make me-" How could he sleep in that house? In the bed, he had been assaulted in, next to the people who had aided his rapist. Knowing that those he had called family wanted a thirteen-year-old girl pregnant with his child so that he died and her family could take his money. He didn't understand how anyone could even consider the idea.
"Wh-Why do you have so l-little blood?" The vampire asked as he pulled Harry into the dungeons.
"Oh, child." Snape lifted his hand to pet Harry's hair consolingly. "I know you are going to dislike your options but you have very few left. Professor Dumbledore is a man that doesn't like things that inconvenience him, this would put his plans to a halt so he doesn't want anyone to know about it. You have two options, tell Madam Bones about your situation and press charges or tell Lucius Malfoy who will press charges for you and bring her to trial."
"I've made a mistake Draco." Lucius felt like everything he knew was falling apart around him.
The next few minutes were noisy as the court deliberated; a few minutes later, the vote was called. Almost unanimously, Hermione Granger was voted Guilty. She was stunned and carried out of the room, back to her cell until all the trials were over and done with, at a later time, Cornelius Fudge, Lucius Malfoy, and Amelia Bones would decide on a punishment for her.
He easily slipped out of the Great Hall through the Teacher's door, nodding to Snape who nodded back. He rounded the corner and waited. Only moments later he grabbed Harry's wrist and twirled the small teen towards him, into the dark alcove and away from prying eyes.
be brewing as you have lost too much time while having tea with the Headmaster. So Mister Potter you will write me a five-foot essay on Poison Antidote." His voice was thick with thinly veiled hatred and contempt.
"He is very smart, almost beating me in Potions." She sniffed in the haughty way that always made Harry cringe.
"The memories were fake. I-I thought that that was all he wanted b-but Draco I-"
"Mr. Potter, I know you've been through a traumatic experience, the Board of Governors, and I believe it would be in your best interest if you took a break from school, saw a mind healer." Her voice was gentle, but the words caused a panic in Harry.
His mind argued that it was his enemies' blood and he should rather die than sink to drinking it but he couldn't agree. Not then. How could his enemy be his enemy when said enemy provided him what he needed to survive. When the enemy willingly tried to give the last of his blood to keep Draco from starving.
"I got this today." Harry pulled the contract out of his bag and handed it over to Hermione and Ron.
"I'm pr-"

"Mister Potter is wishing to press charges against three members of the Weasley family and Albus Dumbledore," Lucius stated professionally. He wasn't against telling his son about his cases.
"Yes, sir?" Harry asked nervously, head still hung as it had been the entire classroom.
the Malfoy's but his entire world had been thrown into a dryer and everything was seen differently. He thought he had loved the Weasley's. he thought of them as his family but at least three of them - Molly, Ron, and Ginny - had purposely aided in raping him. His only experience with Lucius Malfoy was when he freed the man's elf.
for you!" Draco breathed heavily through his nose.
"I don't want to work through it! I want him to hurt the way he hurt me!" Draco shouted, standing up and pacing angrily.
"Where do you want to go first?" Draco swung his and Harry's hand happily, blissfully unaware of the beetle reporter that flew around them.
"You are, unfortunately, correct. I will go seek out that men-" He exhaled sharply through his nose. "I can't even bloody well insult him!" He glared at everyone as he strode out of the common room in search for Harry.
"Wizards can have children, you knew that right?" Fred and George asked at the same time. harry shook his head, he hadn't known until Draco had told him.
"You've no reason to apologize. You were hurting, are hurting, and it is okay to just feel and let it out." Draco continued to drape his arm over the smaller one's shoulders. "Come on, I will give you a tour of Malfoy Manor." Draco walked Harry out of the room, pleased that his appendage hadn't been removed from where it still laid across the shoulders of the slightly younger teen.
- The Dominate must stay faithful to his Submissive under all circumstances.
"Yessir!" Dobby snapped his fingers to pack everything before he apparated them to the Hospital. Frantic minutes later and Harry was sitting in a hospital bed, two Medi-witches fussing around him, one checking the baby while the other checked his condition.
The next day, on their way to Charms class, the trio passed Malfoy and his gang. Besides an angry glare and a quick thought to get on his knees and beg Draco for forgiveness, the effects of his passing were minor. Pansy, who was carrying Draco's things, stuck out a tongue at them before grinning and getting closer to her 'boyfriend.' In Charms, as Flitwick watched them do their summoning charms, Harry and Hermione chatted. "So... Malfoy? You're into," she leaned closer and whispered, "guys?" Harry just shrugged. He still wasn't completely sure. He was into a guy, but also multiple girls had caught his eye. He brought the quill across the room to him, getting words of approval from the Professor.
he leads on [Hermione] Granger. Even when she's at his side, he's looking at
“Sure,” she sighed, picking around at her food, somehow feeling worse knowing that Harry wasn’t hurting like she was. Sure, that was selfish, but she felt like he had led her on. She wanted him to know that same awful feeling.
Harry took the time to eat another dinner roll, slowly, pulling it apart with his thin fingers before popping the pieces into his mouth. He could feel a new emotion—awe. Harry’s head turned from listening to Seamus talk about the broom he grew up with to look at Draco, their eyes meeting. The Slytherin didn’t even look away to pretend he wasn’t staring, but he did look surprised that Harry seemed to sense that he had been staring. To Draco’s right, Pansy was fuming over the fact that her “boyfriend” wasn’t paying any attention to her. Her head turned to Harry, too, but she simply stuck up her middle finger before pulling on Draco’s robe sleeve, whispering something in his ear. Once again, the feeling of aggravation was strong, so strong that Harry had to look away. Once the feeling was gone and his gaze returned to Draco, Pansy was storming out the doors. He jumped at the feeling of a hand on his bicep, turning quickly to see who had touched him.
“Flawless as usual, Mr. Malfoy,” Snape complimented as he peered into their cauldron. His smile turned to a grimace as he faced Harry. “Good job, Mr. Potter.”
"Harry, the only people who are pulled towards Draco are the ones who aren't, I mean... We're all, uh... into guys..."
“Why are you making me feel your emotions?” Harry asked, getting straight to the point. When he didn’t get a response, his gaze moved from the floor to Draco’s face, which was etched with confusion.
She stared at him as she waited for him to elaborate. He was thankful that Ron wasn’t around so he could be honest with her; he felt bad that he was excluding Ron, but he had to figure out a way for him to tell his friend.
“We’ll prove them wrong. Pans had no right, and I think Rita knew it wasn’t me; she had to have, honestly. This will make them both look like fools.”
about, but I don't like that Potter thinks he can have whoever he wants
"Whatever it is he does. When Fleur gets close, you get this feeling, right? She makes you want her. Malfoy does the same thing, guys." How much was Harry going to explain?
Since the first time Harry laid eyes on Draco in the robe shop, he hadn’t been able to shake the feeling of immediate affection. Even when they’d actually been introduced and their attitudes towards each other became unpleasant, to say the least, Harry still felt enchanted. It wasn’t until his fourth year, at the Quidditch World Cup, that he understood. The pale hair, the sharp but elegant facial features, and the look some of the boys got when he passed led Harry to believe that Draco was part Veela. As with Fleur, boys and girls stared and wanted to do Draco’s bidding. Only certain boys were attracted, Harry noticed. Some, like Ron, were utterly disgusted when in the presence of the Malfoy boy. It was no wonder the hall was filled with the glowing ‘Potter Stinks’ badges, as Draco had convinced those under his will to wear them. Every time Harry got near the part-Veela, he had to fight the urge to become submissive to Draco. It was like the unforgivable curse that forced the person to do as their controller wished. He was washed with warmth, as though he was bathing in the sun, whenever Draco got too near. In the warm haze, he felt compelled to kiss Draco as he stood too near.
“Forget I said anything.”
"I know."
She hated the pity that dripped from his words, her wand pointed at his face, a look of pure hatred covered her face. In a flash, Pansy was on the ground and Ron was on top of her. Ron saved him from whatever Pansy had planned for him. It wasn’t long before Professor McGonagall had the two separated, reprimanding them both for their behaviors, but the glint in her eye suggested that she knew that Pansy was the main problem. She sent her to talk to the head of Slytherin, which meant that Snape would probably high five her and tell her she did a great job. She let Ron and Harry go without even dragging them to her office.
“Yeah, I figured I should cool off before I messed up our friendship.”
have given me the official scoop on Harry Potter's love life. Pansy
“It’s fine. I mean, I hate the jeers and laughter, but I grew up with that, so it doesn’t bother me as much as it should,” he said, in reference to the way that Dudley treated him.
"Some of us have noticed... urges, as well. Things we wouldn't normally do, but we want to when Draco's around." Dean looked nervous at admitting it.
“I have a date to the Yule Ball, but I don’t know how to tell Ron… I’m kind of nervous how everyone is going to react, honestly,” Harry confided, sitting down next to her as focus left her assignment.
“You’ll tell me I’m insane just like he did.” Harry knew Dean wouldn’t understand either. He was fully aware that Draco was part Veela.
Parkinson, from Slytherin house, had this to say, "It's really awful the way
“Sorry, Seamus started talking, and I didn’t want to leave while he was mid-sentence. I guess I sat there longer than I thought.” He looked behind him, at Ron, who grinned widely as Hermione told Harry, “Oh, all right… Well, we had a pleasant walk, anyways. Ronald asked me to the Yule Ball.”
“I’m not happy about it, but… Harry, I’m going to be by your side no matter what. Ever since you sat next to me on the train, I’ve known that you were the best friend I was ever going to have.”
“What was that about?” Ron asked as they walked back into the castle.
Hermione had to go to the library; Harry followed along, as Ron was forced to go with George and Fred to sneak into the kitchens. If he hadn't been dragged away, he would have definitely joined them to make sure that Harry wasn't trying to get with Hermione. He struggled with the number of books in his arms as he helped carry half of them, following behind Hermione to check them out. Once they were seated in the very back of the library, Harry opened up to Hermione. "That day when Malfoy was getting in my face, do you remember that? You pulled me away from him." When Hermione nodded, he continued, "Well, I'm convinced he's part Veela."
“She’s pissed that Draco isn’t in love with her, and she thinks that’s my fault, I guess.
Harry knew as soon as Draco walked into the Great Hall, he could feel the anticipation and worry. Worry about whether Harry would want to meet up and if he was upset over the article. The Gryffindor watched him as Draco sat next to Crabbe and some girl neither of them had ever spoken to, going right past Pansy who called out, “Draco, honey, I saved you a seat.” Once seated, he finally looked across the hall at Harry, who gave him an incredibly subtle thumbs up as confirmation to their meeting. So subtle, in fact, that both Ginny and Ron asked him what the hell he was doing.
would be taking to the Ball! Well, folks, here’s an exclusive interview with Draco
"I had to get you alone without your faithful companions ruining everything." Draco wiped his hand on his robe, keeping up the appearance of being disgusted by Harry. He used, what Harry called, his charm on the angry Gryffindor. He glared at Draco, shaking his head as though to clear the thoughts.
“Why would you w—Oh, Harry,” Hermione’s tone went from confused to dejected for Harry.
"There wasn't a single person there who would say that -- encounter was out of anger. " Damn.
“Maybe because he’s being a git about this whole thing!”

The thought of doing this for another week was too much; he started sobbing again, barely breathing as he stumbled out of the room and into the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet before he threw up the little lunch he had managed earlier. Falling back against the tub, Harry was miserable, face pale and tear-streaked, significant, and deep bags under his eyes from little sleep and substantial stress. Hair was a mess, and his slight body seemed all the smaller. Exhaustion pulled the body into unconsciousness.
"Shhhhh, Sub, you didn't do anything wrong. You chose me, my beautiful Sub, you are perfectly fine." Draco kneeled next to Harry and pulled him close, pulling out his wand to place privacy wards around the Dorm.
"What did you believe would happen before Harry took the potion?"
"The ones that bound him were his two closest friends. If Blaise and Theodore can bound you would you expect them to drug you, and keep in mind he was not in arms reach of a wand, to begin with, and has had no prior teachings in wandless magic." Severus didn't let up on his glare until Draco answered.
"No, if he kissed me I don't think it would even compare to the one that we shared in the class- Mmmmm." Harry almost moaned when Draco's tongue swept between his lips. "Dr-Draco?" Harry pulled back a bit, breathing in heavily. "Does this mean that we are..."
"I thought the Malfoy and Black contract was fulfilled when your mother married your father?" Daphne questioned.
"Mister Potter calm down and tell me wh-"
However, his absence from meals would need to be taken care of. If the brat had skipped Potions, he would make sure Severus was in a horrible mood before watching over the boy's detention, that should bring the boy back to his friends, looking for comfort.
"Being such public figures, Dumbledore and Harry, the trial may be in a few days, I have my case, we will have to see their defenses. With Harry's memories and my push for Veritaserum on Molly Weasley and Dumbledore, I hope for a quick trial." Seeing that the conversation had come to an end, Severus said goodnight and flooed back to Hogwarts.
comfortable where he is.
"Is there anything else you would like to say to the court?" Amelia asked gently, she was conflicted. She was still fuming at what this boy had done to the child in the gallery, however, her maternal instincts she had developed since taking in her niece were in overdrive. She knew this redhead to be genuinely remorseful, to have been mostly manipulated to play his part in the play, yet she knew his actions could not be taken back, they were heinous and unforgivable.
Neville ran out of the room when he saw Harry crying, clutching the fabric to his chest. He raced down the steps, into the common room before jumping out of the portrait hole and skipping down the stone steps, looking around for the blond Slytherin. "Malfoy! Malfoy!" Neville almost tripped over his own feet when he spotted the Slytherin.
He kept his head down but answered clearly. "I was in the Headmaster's Office." Harry felt embarrassment burn his cheeks the longer the silence stretched.
Harry was a bit overwhelmed. He wanted to know why, how long had they been planning, why now, what had they meant by 'accident,' did they truly want him dead, why now when he was fourteen. "Uh, why now?" He took in their confusion as a sign to continue. "This was planned, so why now? Weasley is thirteen. I just don't understand."
"Draco doesn't know does he?" Severus asked, thinking that Harry was just emotional that he thought Draco wouldn't want the unborn child.
"When he wakes we will collect memories and I will examine them and make a list of charges I could charge them with and begin putting a case together with the help of Mister Potter and Severus," Lucius commented, a little more relaxed than before. "Draco, what if someone had had you under Imperious, would that be rape if they forced you to do something sexual?"
Those words caused disgust in many Wizards and Witches, to know the chit had tried to seduce the poor boy before and had taken to rape after being rejected made many of them want to call for the girl's head.
"Why can't I be the dominate?!" Harry asked in outrage, the idea of being a submissive wasn't that bad but he wasn't going to just bend to Draco's will.
"Will you, my lovely Sub, let me take you on dates, buy you anything you wish for, kiss you whenever we want, make love to you in the future and fulfill this contract that my father made for us?"
"Innocent!" Hermione called out, smugness curling her lip, no doubt not knowing memories would be provided. The trial was quick and brutal. Amelia Bones started by asking where the girl had been that fateful Thursday evening. "I was in Gryffindor Tower."
"No, you are free to tell your friends-" Draco's voice rang with disgust. "-About the contract but under no circumstances will you state that it is fake." Harry could feel his magic tingle at the command.
"Mr. Weasley, did you knowingly drug Harry Potter?"
"Can we just look at the contract?"
"It's a better alternative than turning into one of you."
"No, no, my dear, sweet, innocent, Potter." Draco chuckled, rocking them back and forth as if dancing along the stone halls.
"You, there, little blonde snake." A dreamy voice floated into his ears. "You should seek the wall across from Barnabas the Barmy on the seventh. Thrice pace and you will find what you seek." The blonde Ravenclaw smiled at him dreamily.
Severus was a bit worried, not that he'd admit that to anyone, but the child seemed to be drifting out of reality. He realized it might be a coping mechanism, detaching himself from reality as to not deal with the trauma and pain that settled itself on his mind but it was unhealthy and as much as he hated to admit it the past few hours had changed his opinion on the teen. He no longer saw his enemy's son, he saw a small child, broken and damaged from life, and he felt a kind of kinship that he felt with Draco.
"Give it back to him Ron, Malfoy probably gave it to him as one of the courting gifts and asked him to wear it to their date today. You're overreacting." Neville was a bit annoyed with how Ron was acting, hurting their friend because something happened that he had no control over.
Harry cried, sobbing into his hands while fearing for his unborn baby's life. After a few seconds of quivering on the floor, he shakily stood on jelly legs and quickly summoned his belongings, again falling and crying before calling for Dobby.
"They
and most importantly, if you even
"What are you suggesting?" Lucius leaned forward, he understood a lot of Muggle things, having been raised to learn them because his father had a lot of Muggle connections high up in the government.
"Yes!" The redhead was sulking, his eyes hard but wet, his fear of what would happen after the trial was evident in the way his body shivered, his twitching hands, and the way his eyes darted around in hope of a supporter or a friend. The increasing anxiety went far in showing how scared the boy was for his future.
"Oh." Harry was embarrassed that he was still a virgin - was a handjob enough to take that title away - while Draco had so much experience.
The day for the first trial dawned bright and early. Hermione Granger sat in the Ministry holding cell, hair still wet from her wash, body draped in large robes that all suspects wore, it made it impossible to hide any weapons or second wands. Molly Weasley, Ginerva Weasley, Ronald Weasley, and Albus Dumbledore sat in their own cells, Albus Dumbledore with an extra rune carved necklaces stuck around his neck to prevent wandless magic and his ability to call his Pheonix to him.
"I want to touch you, Potter, I want to touch
"Fine." Draco reluctantly added the last part before adding the situations up to the 'faithful' requirement. "Are we agreed?"
"What about Blaise?" Harry asked, his voice soft as he stared up into Draco's icy blue eyes.
"You are not intruding, I would not have offered if I hadn't wanted you here." Draco transfigured their clothing to sleep wear simply to get into bed faster. He slipped under the covers and pulled Harry in after him.
with him!" Ron was red with anger and while Harry wanted Ron to oppose the idea he didn't want it to be because it was
"Very well, do come in, we all have more important things to do." Severus closed the doors with a bang with the swish of his wand glaring at the students that stared at them with open mouths. "Back to work!" Harry sat behind Ron and Hermione, head down, tensing when he felt Professor Snape right behind him. His cloak brushed against Harry's back and his hair tickled Harry's ear. "You will
I care about enough to chase." Draco crowded into Harry's space again. "I wasn't planning on seeing anyone else. Just you." Draco promised, gripping Harry's hips and picking him up and pushing him against the stall, grinding into Harry's hips after Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's hips.
pregnant, they are both very young." Severus dearly wished the little chit wasn't pregnant; Harry would be devastated no doubt if the worst moment of his life brought forth an everlasting product.
"Many pure-bloods marry without love, Draco." He paused. "And even if Harrison had wanted to leave he offered many advantages to our name. He is the Heir to the Potter and Black Lordships and maybe others."
"What lead to the blood loss Mister Potter?" Severus asked voice worried.
"What do you want to do to me?" Harry asked softly, digging his nails into his palm to stop himself from leaning forward and closing the space between their lips because the Slytherin lips seemed to glisten, and Harry wanted to know if they tasted like the strawberries he knew Draco ate less than ten minutes ago in the Great Hall. "Torture me?"
"Harry.... Call me Harry." Harry could have slept right there, in the arms of the vampire he had been trying to feed.
Wondering around the castle lead Harry to the boy's bathroom on the third floor. He was curled up under one of the sinks, barely fitting due to his recent growth spurt, - even if he was still too small for a fifteen-year-old - wiping away his silent tears.
He stood before the fireplace, and the flames were tall but gentle, Harry didn't think it would be possible outside of a magical home. Snape was behind him, one hand on his shoulder. Draco had already gone through. Harry had hesitated so long the once green flames were back to orange and red hues. Lucius was somewhere behind Severus, waiting for the others to leave so he could lock the floo. "I don't think I can do this," his voice wavered. "No, I know I can't do this, please don't make me go back!" He backed up further, only making it two steps before he was unable to more anymore, blocked by the Potions Master's body.
"Do you have to see them?" Harry asked, shrinking in on himself as his cheeks were radiating heat.
He covered Harry's mouth with his hand to stop the small squeak he
"I can't believe you're going on a
-----
He could only nod, relaxing minutely now that he was alone with Professor Snape and Draco.
His floo flared, and the Frudge's voice called through, he sighed.
"She's a friend, after she told me how to get here she said she had to find a blonde snake. I assumed she meant you." Harry blushed under the look Draco gave him. "What?" His voice was shy and nervous.
"Why haven't you told anyone?!" Severus felt rage burn in his chest.
"Severus Snape please." Harry fell limply back into the bed, tears brimming his eyes again as he was left alone in the room. He curled into a ball, wrapping his arms protectively around his stomach as he silently cried into his pillow.
- The Submissive will do whatever he can do to comfort and/or soothe his Dominate's
Parseltongue Ron!" Hermione sighed in exasperation.
"Because I refuse to be the submissive, it is this or Ron will marry that Muggle-born." Draco taunted the idea in front of him had tears immediately burned his eyes.
Harry was confused by the personality change in his Professor but he wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. He curled up in a ball on the Italian leather couch, shaking only slightly as silent tears on his cheeks. He tried to forget the night before but the blatant dismissal by the Headmaster was a cut to the already bleeding heart.
"Lucius, we have business to discuss. Harry here thought you'd be a better option to consult with to Madam Bones with this particular situation." Severus watched interest spark the silver/pale blue eyes of his long time friend.
The courtroom was full; every Wizengamot member present counting to about sixty men and woman. Hermione Granger was sat in the chair before the whole court, chains wrapped around her. The stupify was canceled, and she sagged in the chair. Nervous air radiated out of her every pore. She glared hatefully at Lucius Malfoy, who was stood leaning his hip against a table that had a file, and some notes are strewn across it.
"Want Dumbledore to pull strings and get off or a lighter sentence?" Severus offered, frowning when the small child nodded, tears streaking down his cheeks. "Oh, child." Severus sat down next to the small child, turning him so they were facing. "They will pay for what they've done." He thumbed away the tears, ignoring the small voice in the back of his mind that argued that the action was ruining the reputation he had built up for years.
A few seconds later and Harry's fingers inched up from his chest to wrap around Draco's shoulders, his forehead falling and resting on Draco's shoulder. Draco felt the hunger grow the closer and longer he stayed next to Potter. He felt his fangs elongate and he dragged the across the warm flesh, smirking when Potter shivered and goosebumps trailed down his shoulder.
-----
Harry sighed before standing and nodding his thanks to Snape before calmly leaving the room, his anger washed away as tears slipped down his cheeks. He slowly made his way into the Gryffindor common room, thankfully everyone was already asleep so he easily walked up the stairs before he slipped into bed, welcoming Morpheus' embrace.
Once back in school Harry had realized that he had grown too dependent on those he viewed as his saviors. He pushed for alone time, isolating himself so no one could hurt him again. The time alone was horrible, it made Harry realize that he needed people he could trust to help him heal. After returning to the Malfoy Manor Harry had deeply missed his new blond friend. Instead, he spent the next three days waiting for the trials with Lucius Malfoy, he would sit silently in the Library near the man, or in the man's office, to read and ask questions on the man while he worked diligently on the paperwork that Harry never looked at.
He was a little surprised when he found that calling Harry 'child' felt natural and smooth, wiping away all the past to start anew. Severus was a little more than relieved that Harry had yet to ask him to stop calling him that.
to give the Dominate more children if both the Dominate and the
Harry and the occupants of Malfoy Manor talk about the near future of Harry's life.
"Are you sure?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow at the girl, he hadn't thought she would lie, but he should have expected it. He truly thought she would just say what she had done was 'for the greater good' like the man she was working with would have.
"See in Muggle science there is genetics. If two people who have brown eyes give birth to a child with blue eyes and no one in their family does then it's 90% sure that that kid isn't biologically from both of those parents."
"Where am I sleeping?" Harry yawned, rubbing his eye tiredly.
He sniffed pathetically, flashes of red hair and a freckled smile taunted him as his heart seemed to ache in his chest. He was too preoccupied with his thoughts that he didn't hear the door open or the sound of shoes on the tile.
"Child neglect and accessory to rape for Albus Dumbledore. Child endangerment, aiding and abiding rape, attempted line theft for Molly Weasley. Accomplice to second-degree assault and conspiracy for murder for both Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. Rape attempted line theft and conspiracy for murder for Ginerva Weasley." Lucius watched the anger and horror etch itself into the lines of Amelia's face.
"I know we are asking a lot of you, Mr. Potter, but I'm afraid we cannot keep you from school any longer." Lucius stepped forward to meet the child's eyes. They were wide in fear; the once bright green shadowed.
Harry was holding his head in his hands, his fingers digging into the skin painfully. He let the dam break and crumble away as all the pain, anger, sadness and every emotion that had built up since the night before out. He screamed his throat sore. His magic thrashed around him, attacking any and everything. The only things he could hear were the words from the Headmaster and the moans from Ginny, the disapproving words from Hermione and the anger from Ron.
“What about his threat? About things getting worse?” She asked, needing to know that Harry wasn’t in any sort of danger before she could accept that there was something between the Slytherin an Gryffindor.
Malfoy! “Yeah, Potter asked me. I said no, I’m already going with my girlfriend,
“It was fake. Just an attempt to make me look bad. Thank you, though.”
"Then why doesn't it bother us?" Ron didn't think it made sense. That was okay. Hermione, on the other hand, looked at Harry like she finally understood. They weren't attracted to him, therefore he didn't bother them. The look of pity returned.
As though they didn't have the same cauldron... To make things even better, the professor asked him to stay behind to clean up a bad spill that was burning on the floor. The person responsible didn't have to do it because she was a Slytherin and all Slytherins are exempt from duties they'd otherwise have. He had to do it because his work was "distracted and irresponsibly done." He told his friends that he'd catch up with them at the Great Hall. By the time his Professor was happy with his cleaning, dinner was already started. Snape was working on grading the last of their assignments on Wolfsbane, so he stayed at his desk when Harry was finally allowed to leave. While pushing his potions book into his bag, not really paying attention to where he was walking, he was pulled into a dark closet he had never known was there before. His eyes were wide with panic, but before he could shout or curse his assailant, a warm hand was pressed over his mouth.
"You could have told me, you know... I would- I would have gotten over it," Ginny mumbled, her eyes and nose red like she'd been crying.
The Yule Ball arrived faster than anyone was prepared for. Harry had no idea what to expect, he’d never been to a ball before. On the walk to the Great Hall, he ran into his date. Harry had barely even processed that Draco was there before their mouths were connected, Draco’s hands holding his hip, pulling his close. He wasn’t sure if anyone else had been around and seen, but he couldn’t find it within himself to care. Neither could Draco, although he was the one with powerful, hateful parents, the one who should be worried about them even being seen together. There was no question that Lucius Malfoy loathed him, probably as much as Pansy did, but for very different reason. Harry felt a bit dazed at the sudden, and unexpected, kiss.
“That’s great, Hermione! You said ‘yes,’ right?” He teased, nudging her knee back. She nodded enthusiastically and leaned closer to Ron. Harry was glad for his friends, but the thought of Ron and Hermione both having dates for the Yule Ball, while he didn’t, made him panic a bit. The obvious choice was Draco, but he knew that was unimaginable. He wouldn’t even let himself think about dancing with Draco, swaying to the music as they hold each other closer than they’ve ever been.  No one would be accepting of that plan. He was sure Draco would ask Pansy, which meant that Harry absolutely had to find a date. There were girls constantly asking him, only because he was “famous.” Perhaps he’d take one of them, both of them using each other in their own ways.
"I don't know, Hermione. I mean, I've been thinking about a date to the Yule Ball, and they've all been girls. I've noticed guys, too, but..."
Harry made up some bullshit excuse about studying up for the next task, which made Hermione incredibly proud to think that Harry was actually trying to be prepared. When he got to the lavatory, his first thought was a joking ‘how romantic.’ Draco had been sitting against the empty wall, but stood as Harry entered, hesitating before pulling him into a tight hug, mumbling, “I didn’t know she’d do that,” as though it wasn’t apparent by his change in demeanor towards Parkinson. Draco’s feeling of guilt surrounded him, but there was something more there, too. Hope. Harry sat next to the spot Draco had been sitting, which he occupied once again.
“Obviously. It’s not because I’d like to dance with you or be close to you, and it’s definitely not because the idea of you being with some girl bothers me, especially because you have every right to go with some girl because you don’t owe me anything.” The sarcastic snark made Harry laugh, shifting just enough so that their arms were pressed together.
The next day, Hedwig dropped off a small note, while everyone else got yet another Daily Prophet with his face on the front. The source cited for the article was none other than Draco Malfoy.
Harry went to bed first, telling them that he needed to spend some time thinking about the next task. It was true, he did need to; the only thing he thought about, though, was Draco. He still had on a dorky smile when Dean entered the room, holding hand with Seamus, who dropped his hand as soon as he saw that they weren’t alone. Harry pretended he hadn’t noticed, but felt bad for Dean, having to hide his love. Seamus sat on his own bed, and Harry made a mental note to himself to distract Ron and Neville so that the two could have some privacy for a while. Dean, however, came to Harry’s bed, sitting on the edge. “I left right after you, Harry. You gave in, didn’t you?” He asked, nervous for his friend, not wanting him to get hurt by Slytherin with the worst reputation of anyone currently at Hogwarts. When Harry didn’t respond, Dean just nodded. “I’m not going to say anything, because you look happy, happier than I’ve seen you lately, but be careful. “
Classes were very difficult to pay attention to. People were not-so-secretly laughing at him and his failed attempt to get Draco to go to the Ball with him. They’d believe anything in the Prophet, sadly. The laughter sucked, but nothing bothered him as much as it would’ve if it hadn’t been Pansy making up stories. Ron was still on edge but was no longer ready to throw curses at the next person to piss him off, so that was an improvement. It seemed to take forever, and he noticed more ‘Potter Stinks’ pins than ever, but dinner finally came. For the first time since she had blown up on him, Ginny sat down across from Harry. He said a soft greeting, not wanting to say too much in case she wasn’t over Rita’s article yet.
Normally, the Golden Trio would’ve left the Hall together and walk back to the Gryffindor common room together, but Ron leaned over to Harry to whisper to him, “I need to talk to Hermione. Alone. Mind hanging back for a bit before coming to the common room?” Harry was offended at the idea of Ron and Hermione sharing secrets, potentially about him, until Ron broke out in a smile. “I’m going to ask her to go to the Yule Ball with me.” He didn’t say it, but Harry could feel that there was more to that sentence; as Ron tensed up after the confession, he could almost hear the implied, “If that’s all right with you.” Harry returned the smile and nodded, giving him an encouragement of, “Good luck!”
“He didn’t leave me alone, Pansy…”
“I don’t hate you. I had a lot of feelings towards you, but hate wasn’t one of them. I do hate your stupid Veela magic, though,” Harry said, after realizing what moment Draco had been referring to. He didn’t realize that he’d come to love that stupid Veela magic, feeling Draco’s emotions course through him and intensifying every interaction between them. The blond just laughed and shrugged, nudging Harry’s shoulder with his own. Harry panicked when he realized that he was supposed to rejoin Ron and Hermione. What if something happened that left them upset, and Harry was here kissing the guy he assumed was his enemy (until now)? Harry touched Draco’s knee, smiling apologetically. “I have to make sure Ron isn’t heartbroken.” Unlike Ron, Hermione was difficult to read. He could never really tell if she held romantic feelings for the ginger. He stood, offering a hand to help Draco up. Once they were both standing, Harry turned to leave, but Draco didn’t let go of his hand.
“So, what you said in the Great Hall, when the Prophet came out…” Draco started, not sure how he wanted to end the sentence.
other student—other boys. He'd been eyeing that Weasley girl all
“Wait,” he said, pulling Harry in for another quick kiss, hardly anything more than their lips lightly brushing together, but as Harry walked back towards the common room, he couldn’t shake off that warm feeling (not that he wanted to).
“I don’t expect you to understand it, Ron, I’m just hoping you’ll deal it.”
"Ten rotations, Potter. Trying to ruin our potion or are you just daft?" Malfoy sneered, taking the spoon from Harry. Where the thin fingers had been seemed to burn. He rubbed at the spot, a frown on his face.
“Couldn’t help myself. You look amazing, Harry. Are you nervous?” Draco gave Harry’s hips a light squeeze, the pressure reassuring. Harry could feel Draco’s own anxiety, but he was doing a good job at hiding it.
"Draco Malfoy is a Veela. I know it doesn't make sense to you, Hermione, but he is. He even hints at it. I think I screwed up, though. He cornered me earlier, after Potions, tried to get me to make a move. The thing Dean gave me was a note from Malfoy. He said he's going to make it harder for me to ignore."
"That doesn't mean he's a Veela! I mean, you must admit, he isn't unattractive, Harry. It's natural for girls, and some guys, to be interested in him. "
“Is that the only reason you want to go with me?” Harry asked, fidgeting with the note that still remained in his pocket.
“The Boy Who Lived has turned into quite a womanizer! Hogwarts students
foul language, but I’m sure you can guess what he called that poor muggleborn girl.
The two got a lot of suspicious looks, acting so chummy as though the last partner project hadn’t been full of sarcasm and annoyance. They even left for dinner together, laughing about Merlin knows what. As they entered the Great Hall together, every single eye from the Slytherin and Gryffindor table was on them. They parted to go to their designated table, Harry rejoining Ron and Hermione. Ron looked as though he could be sick, but still faked a smile for Harry’s sake, but Hermione looked genuinely happy for him, less because of Draco and more because of the smile that hadn’t gone away since they’d parted. Yeah, rumors were bound to spread, but neither of them cared.
“It wasn’t him, Ron. Look at what it says. The last time I spoke to Pansy, I told her that I doubted Draco would date her because he had standards that she could never meet. It was Pansy, Ron.” Ron put his hand on Hermione’s, frowning. He wanted to defend her honor, but he wasn’t about to hex a girl, especially not one with so many friends. The last time he tried to hex someone for calling Hermione the M-word, he ended up puking slugs for hours. Hermione smiled at Ron and covered their hands with her other hand, hoping it’d calm him down. She didn’t care what the paper says. She was not ashamed of who she was or who she was going to the Ball with. She would have been worried about Harry, about the blatant lie that Pansy had posted, but he seemed completely unbothered. People were staring at the three of them, and at Draco, but Harry didn’t care. Pansy was being immature, and he wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction. Though, he smirked as he noticed she had tried to hold Draco’s hand, but he pulled away from her and moved down a seat. He did feel bad for Malfoy at the same time, as his best friend was unintentionally hurting him.
"Why-Why would muggle's need those?!" Cedric asked in alarm. "I thought they were kind, understanding creatures."
"The only downside is that it's Malfoy." Seamus shrugged his shoulders.
"What kind of friend are you when the enemy cares more about him than you do?" Nevill glared at Ron who was fuming in his seat as he watched Malfoy fly up the steps.
"Ever hurt him we will hunt you down and destroy everything you have, had or will ever have." Fred finished.
The sound of stampeding feet signaled the end of dinner and all the students racing back to their dorms.
Harry couldn't help but to arch his back at the feeling, he let out airy pants and breathy moans every other second. He clawed at Draco's shoulder blades. He gasped for breath and whined when the arms around his waist tightened like coiling snakes. "D-Dra-Draco!" Harry shouted, gripping the cloth between his fingers until they went numb.
"I want a trial," Harry said immediately. "If people were forced to vote on charging Dumbledore they would vote in favor of him." Harry continued, voice only slightly wavering. "I don't like the idea of those memories being put on a show but it is needed - and I know that - if I want them to pay for what they did to me."
Amelia Bones, a group of Aurors, and the Board of Governors arrive at Hogwarts to collect those they seek.
-----
With some reflection, Harry didn't fully understand why he was so incapable of keeping his opinion or thought to himself when in the magical world, he grew up quiet, never saying anything, in the Muggle world for fear of punishment. If he said anything to get the trial known to Dumbledore before the trial was announced to him by the Ministry, then he would have time to call in bribes to get himself and his partners off easy.
"We should be getting back to our dorms." Draco made no move to leave.
He ignored the Hat song and instead looked at all the other students. He found Cedric who smiled at him with a little wave. He waved back shyly, blushing when the people around Cedric looked at him oddly.
"They hurt you?" Draco paled at the admission, anger, and frustration drained from him in less than a second. At the small nod, he felt dread in his stomach. "Have you told anyone? Why do you keep going back there?!"
Harry blinked when the hat was taken off his head. He smiled at Professor McGonagall before walking toward the cheering table. He glanced around and saw glares and shocked stares from the rest of the school and even the staff. He hung his head and went to sit down at the end of the table only for the blond boy from earlier to pat the seat next to him, glaring at the brunette girl to move to make room.
"Yes or no, Harry. Are you going on the date?" Ron was holding the cloak limply.
"You're so adorable when you giggle like that." Draco teased, pulling Harry flush to him by his hips, smirking at the startled yelp Harry let out before laughing heartily as he wrapped his arms around Draco's shoulders.
