Draco was nervous, but he knew he shouldn't be.
A quick touch up to his hair should do the trick, even if it didn't really change anything, and Harry was ready to answer the door.
Harry’s playing was by far not good, it was pitchy and not in the slightest smooth. He hadn't thought that he would be brilliant at it in one go, but he had thought that he would be decent. He was only hitting a few keys here and there making a racket of annoyingly loud sounds.
Draco was convinced it was something to do with Harry being an auror. He hadn't seen the boys before they went to sleep, so maybe Scor thought he wasn't coming back? He listened to Scorps' explanation though, after he let Harry go and snuggled into his chest.
"I'm not sure. What's a fun fact?" Maybe the fact that he lacked a will to live was a fun fact. Or the fact that he drowned his self pity in alcohol and isolation. "I guess I can do a headstand."
"It's okay, we're okay. Why were you in the woods." Malfoy said calmly, Harry was still fighting for his ability to speak.
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
"Thanks, Professor. You're the best."
After Madame Pomfrey healed the slash on Malfoy's shoulder, Mcgonagall came to explain.
"Malfoy." He shook him. "'Malfoy, wake up. It's just a dream." Groaning.
"Sorry."
"Hagrid?"
"Could have been an animal."
"Damn, she was fit. Do we know her?" Pansy half whispered, half laughed. Malfoy guffawed quietly.
"I guess so."
"Really?!"
"They've changed, Ron." Harry muttered.
"Good to see you too! How's life treating you?"
"Nothing. Just heard a man's voice and was a bit confused." Malfoy smirked.
"Professor Potter?" A voice said from across the library. Kids these days have no respect of quiet places. He almost giggled at himself.
"Fuck." He groaned.
"Harry, is that my fucking wand?" Harry choked to find words. First of all, Malfoy just called him by his first name and he didn't know what he was feeling about that, and second of all, yes, it was his fucking wand. How do you tell someone you've been using their wand for years?
"You do?"
"You're gay?!" Harry said before thinking.
"Bugger off, Malfoy. At least my hair isn't-" Harry started but soon trailed off as he finally noticed Malfoy's hair. It was longer, collarbone length, and slightly shaggy while still looking perfectly manicured. So high maintenance. It looked so soft and silky, though.
"Er... Dr- Malfoy?" He walked back in through his own front gate, visibly red with exertion, sweat rolling off him, and breathing heavily. It was still half dark.
"I'm scared." He whispered in Harry's ear.
Harry began, but Draco gasped.
Harry spun round, but Draco was just standing there, beside the bed, holding his belly (which Harry thought did look ready to pop, if he was honest). Coming round to Draco’s side he noticed the puddle on the floor, which must have been the water from Draco’s womb. Harry opened his mouth only for the words to die as he realised there were tears streaming silently down Draco’s lovely white face.
Draco snorted. "Obviously, Potter. I have a very well-rounded palate, thank you very much." And with that, he stalked into the next cubicle, where his emergency muggle-mingling outfit was waiting for him.
"Harry?"
"Fuck, Malfoy." Potter choked.
And then it all made sense. Draco had been feeling sick all week and had finally thrown up this morning. He was pregnant. They were having a baby. Draco was having his baby.
"Draco," it had been just barely a whisper in the busy corridor.
Harry looked up from the broom sheepishly. "It's - er - I just thought it would be good to have. For when they're old enough. So we - we can all fly tog - are you
“Okay then.” He swallowed. "Okay. It will be okay." He was fighting awfully hard to keep his tone even and soft. The last thing Draco needed right now was to be reminded of the awful incident with the rogue Death Eater who had managed to avoid imprisonment at the end of the war.
"Fuck," he breathed.
Draco took a deep, steadying breath, which only caught a little bit at the end. With eyes squeezed shut he whispered slowly as though the words might break him.
"It's unreactive, Potter, I wouldn't worry your tiny head about it." Draco started to arrange his things on the shower shelf right beside Potter's - his favourite, stolen - stall. There was an urge to march back in there and demand Potter give up the shower instead, but frankly Draco couldn't bear to give the Auror any other reason to suspect him of anything, being so clearly an object of Potter's professional focus already.
Draco admonished himself.
"I read your research by the way. Your diagnostic spellwork has some incredible implications for interpreting magical signatures. Did you ever test it on people?"
"Surely you are aware Terry Pratchett is wizard, Potter. No one could produce a volume of work that massive in a muggle lifetime."
Potter shook his head. "Malfoy, there are
Harry spoke first, his arms still holding Draco's waist.
"Draco, you're shining!"
When Draco apparated to the front step of Harry's place he wasn't expecting Harry to have already been for a run.
He demonstrated.
He hadn't counted on Granger being an up-and-coming. He successfully avoided her for the first hour, opting instead to consume enough aged whisky to make the edges of the room blurry.
Draco was curled on his side, nestled among a mound of pillows, watching another muggle documentary about exotic birds or lost tribes, and there was an (empty) ice cream tub on the coffee table beside a banana peel and -
Harry scrambled out of bed, trying to clear his thoughts which were whooshing round in his brain, colliding with each other.
“Draco,” Harry felt as though his heart would break, looking at the gorgeous man in front of him.
it, I’m just not really feeling… aroused? No, it’s more like I feel unarousable.” Draco gave Harry’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “I’m sure it won’t be long now. A couple of weeks, max.”
No, going forward, he would conduct all his experiments at home, in the well-stocked and eternally spotless potions laboratory at the Manor. It was a plan that was preferable to his current situation - sharing a lab and cauldrons with Merlin knows who, and Merlin knows what potions - twofold, because not only did it afford him privacy and confidence in the sterility of his equipment, but it would also take him far, far away from the prying eyes of Harry-
“Hmm, looks like someone’s been feeling left out, aye Potter?”
Draco folded his arms and waited. "Well which was it, no, or not really?"
Draco's mouth fell open.
erection, that Harry-fucking-Potter could
Harry got very suddenly redder, and his eyes flicked away from Draco like he'd become a Basilisk.
Potter was watching the floor, his eyebrows furrowed in a sort of angry confusion.
"What the hell is that?"
erection was pressed up against the taut brown skin covering Harry-fucking-Potter's exquisitely sculpted abdomen.
“Now, I think we’d best get down to St Mungo’s before your contractions start.” Harry grabbed a bag, and packed it with Draco’s favourite emerald pyjamas, his silk-encased pillow and a lavender and honey scented candle.
It had fallen to Harry to spend months - years, even - convincing Draco that although he felt like a boy now, he was also in no way 'incorrect' for a girl. Hermione herself had explained to Draco that Clitoromegaly in premature babies usually only lasted a few weeks at most.
If a naked Harry-fucking-Potter was a sight when he was wet, he was something else dry, in Draco's kitchen. Draco's double-crossing hands reached out and rested on the bloody bulging muscles of Harry's chest. Dragging his eyes away from the chiseled sculpture of Adonis in front of him, Draco looked up into Harry's dark eyes. They were practically glaring at him again, and Draco wondered if he was trying to devour Draco with his eyes.
, it was for the baby
Draco continued to muse over the shortcomings of his fellow students as he stacked up his last remaining set of clothes: an emergency muggle-mingling outfit; and his shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and facial cleanser on the shelf beside his favourite shower cubicle.
“Draco?” Harry felt his heart stop beating. Something was going dreadfully wrong, he could tell. Draco was frozen in place, arms wrapped tightly round himself beside their king-sized four-poster. “Are you - are you okay? Are you sick? Has - has something happened?” Harry took a step forward, reaching out to grasp Draco’s arms.
Oh. That would explain all the tears then. Feeling Draco’s sobs racking his slim body, Harry pulled him closer.
Draco thought, pursing his lips momentarily.
"Yes, Potter, I really want it." Draco demonstrated by leaning towards the deliciously warm and wet cock.
, you're lovely," Draco buried his face in Harry's shoulder, and held him as close as his bulging stomach would allow.
"Potter! What in Merlin-"
Gasping for breath and release, Draco looked down at where their cocks were being methodically wanked off together. Potter's penis was broad and dark, though Draco's was not much smaller.  As he watched, Potter's emitted a dribble of pre-come and suddenly Draco was thrusting into the hand, come spurting all over Potter's magical fucking fingers. The hand kept going, and with each thrust Draco emptied himself onto Harry-fucking-Potter. He was almost done when Potter shoved his other arm over Draco's shoulder to brace against the wall, his body shuddering as his cock erupted next to Draco's spent one.
"Mmm," Draco busied himself taking down a couple of glasses from the cupboard across from Harry.
Potter.
"Get out!" And with that, Potter gave him a gentle shove back the way he had come.
Once he’d outgrown his healer’s robes, which were more than capable of adjusting to fit up to a certain size, he’d decided to simply start his maternity leave from St Mungos early, and had busied himself writing up the research portion of his Healer’s Mastery, which as far as Harry understood was a very detailed examination of several cases of quite common potions interacting unfavourably with other treatments, including potions and spells, in patients with chronic and untreatable magical maladies.
"I want to fuck you."
?" he gestured between them.
Harry knelt and offered Draco his arm, which Draco used to pull himself into a sitting position. "This is ridiculous. How long were you planning to just leave me here? I've been busting forever."
Draco gulped. His heart was jumpy again and his head felt fuzzy.
“Erm - should we - should we go? Do we - do you - do you need - er - things?” Harry yanked a sock on and flung yesterday’s clothes off the armchair in the corner, hoping he’d left a clean-ish hoodie lying around somewhere. “Draco?”
"I'm serious, Potter. You also left your hoodie here last time, which I have obviously had to wash. I'm really too busy at work to have to return your things, and it's becoming inconvenient. You practically move in every time you come here."
"What?" Hermione's brow furrowed and she leaned in.  "Did you say Harry's magic is out of control?"
"So, just to be clear, you're not in love with Harry Fucking Potter?"
"Look, darling, I'm not saying that you are." She leaned back on the chaise lounge. "All I'm saying is that he's fucking fit,
“Do you have any lube?” Harry asked from somewhere over Draco’s shoulder.
"What does it look like, Malfoy? I'm trying to take a shower!" Potter seemed to have noticed he was thoroughly exposed, and his hands scrambled to cover himself, blushing like a school girl.
He did. It was his own fault for encouraging the behaviour he supposed, but what could he say? Potter was a phenomenal fuck, eager to please and full of enthusiasm. Generous was an understatement. He was fit, undoubtedly. You'd have to be blind or straight to not realise that, and Draco was unfortunately neither. Harry wasn't just fit, he was gorgeous. The man looked like a greek god, for fucks sake. Chiseled muscles, a pleasing angular jaw and high cheekbones with that straight nose and the dark skin.
"What?" Draco demanded testily. Trust Potter to come here after a disappointing day, hoping Draco would help him lick his pathetic wounds.
"You fuc-" Potter's hand was in his mouth. His fingers tugged on Draco's cheek, and Draco followed the fingers to glare at Potter's smug face.
"Some," Draco lied.
Running his hand of the polished handle, Harry couldn't help remembering the first time he'd flown at Hogwarts, when Draco had hurled Neville's Remembrall and Harry had gone after it.
Harry looked up from Arthur Conan Doyle. "Um. What?"
what time is it?”
"Draco," Harry began questioningly. Draco flicked his eyes up to where Harry (still shirtless....
“Oh, fuck, Malfoy,” Harry didn’t need this, he was ready, very ready, aching to sink into Draco and love him. “What would you like to do - where do you want me?”
When Potter's lips parted at his earlobe and left a quick bite there, a small breath escaped Draco's tight chest. Potter seemed to take it as encouragement, because he grabbed Draco's head in both hands and brought their faces crashing together.
Latin. Plus the little bit of Spanish my mother made me learn."
you," he hissed. "You fucking imbecile."
"Over."
"Of course, Draco, it's okay. You'll be a great dad, and we will do it together, we'll manage - "
"Well, Potter, I have some reading to do, since I have no idea what the hell was in my cauldron to make it explode and get us into this mess. I'm sure you can find something to watch on television that will keep you entertained. I believe there's a children's channel, which would be appropriate for a man of your... intellect."
"Harry's virtually burning up with magic. I'm sure any of the suitable spells would show his signature as unnaturally large."
"Oh. Right." He rolled himself up into a sitting position, blinking blearily at Draco. "That was good."
She pounced on him just when he'd ordered his fourth, and cornered him at the bar.
The whole place was a circus, frankly, and Draco couldn't wait to be rid of them. He'd write to the Potions Masters supervising his project and inform them he'd be working from home going forward as soon as he'd washed off the residue coating his entire body and robes. He glanced down at the once-black robes now drenched with pale-pink slime. Scratch that, he'd write to them as soon as he'd made it home and changed out of these ruined robes.
"Roll over, Malfoy, I want to fuck you."
Harry was planning to come back. He was always planning to spend more time at Draco's apartment, and he'd started leaving stuff there to use the next time he visited. Draco hugged himself tighter.
. "Where the fuck does he get off, telling me he loves me? We're fucking, not fucking dating."
Blaise was on his way out.
Pulling away from Harry’s hands, Draco flopped onto the bed, still with his long arms wrapped around his slender middle as though trying to hold himself together.
The first finger took Draco by surprise. Harry had certainly not given him any warning, and suddenly his finger was stroking Draco’s arsehole and there were sparks of pleasure flickering up Draco’s spine. The finger pressed softly, angling inwards and then it was inside Draco, stroking gently.
Leaving the plates to wash themselves in the sink, Harry retrieved the shopping bag from the front hall. It was silly, he knew, but how could he not? It wasn't really for the baby
"Pansy. I'm not fucking in love with him." She just sighed.
Draco nodded, looking devastated, though he seemed to ease under Harry’s hands moving in steady circles on his back.
"Your turn?" Draco asked, because he was apparently delirious, and for some reason had decided that Harry-fucking-Potter shirtless in his kitchen was a sight he needed to see
"I did not. But certainly some of them would show traces of dark or intense magic," Draco barely stifled a laugh, "You could try them on Potter to see what makes his magic so out of control."
Grabbing yesterdays robes from the armchair by the window, Draco dressed as quickly as he could and fled downstairs, shooting a final look of murderous rage in Potter's direction before he swept from the room.
"What are you doing now?" Draco said softly into the pillow, still enjoying the sleepy bliss that follows a good orgasm.
Draco sighed.
Potter looked appeased and rose back up to meet Draco's waiting arse. He rested on the rim, bracing Draco's hips with his stupid strong hands. "
"You know what I mean, Draco," he said, in the same sleepy voice. "I love you."
"Oh sweetheart," Harry enveloped as much of Draco as he could. "Oh my sweet, sweet darling. This baby is not its father. Just like you are not your father, this baby is its own person, and we will love it because you made it. You.
If Harry had looked surprised before, he now looked absolutely flabbergasted. "You eat curry? From muggles?"
Draco just nodded, breath caught in his throat, marvelling at the sensation of being stretched by Harry’s warm, thrusting fingers.
Draco sniffed. He thought the whole thing sounded ridiculously Gryffindor: dangerous, completely unrefined, and totally fool-hardy. Nothing like the incredibly intricate work accompanied by a 150 thousand word discussion that had recently earned him his own Mastery in Charms.
"Arse."
“But what if?” He begged.
Draco ducked under Harry's arm and grabbed a towel which he now realised was probably Harry's and should have been a dead giveaway that his preferred shower was in use. "It's a very simple potion, Pothead, just go home and it should wear off in a few hours."
"Obviously."
"Potter, if you don't fuck me right now, I will-" Draco never figured out what he would do to Potter as punishment (the insufferable git would enjoy being fucked by Malfoy just as much) because Potter pulled his cock mostly out and slammed it back in so hard Draco understood the term 'seeing stars'.
before a massive sob ripped from his mouth and he started bawling in earnest.
," he added. His own cock was trembling from the mere sensation of Potter's pre-come on his arse.
It wasn’t exactly how he’d predicted his evening would go, but then, Harry Potter had been ruining his plans since they met in Madame Malkin’s Robes For All Occasions.
A meeting was called when the new tent was finished, and again, Dumbledore asked his questions…and again got nowhere. He knew when to cut his losses, but he was deeply troubled. The fire could have been an accident, but he knew it was not. Someone, one of his family, had deliberately burnt the Malfoy's tent and whether planned or not, had nearly killed not only other family members and animals, but innocent members of the public; that someone he knew and loved could do such a thing was hard to accept.
& & &
When the last quivering falsetto had echoed through the venue, the steel beams in the walls thrumming, Harry crushed his plastic cup and sat up.
He was beautiful, Harry had to admit; pale blond, dark eyed, with thin lips and a narrow face. Given his basic features, he shouldn't have been so pretty – but he was. Maybe it was the makeup that made the difference between rather plain, even slightly pinched features, and flat-out gorgeous. His name, Harry discovered, was Milo. Huh. He didn't look much like a Milo, but Harry supposed that if all names were made to fit people perfectly, his would have to be changed to Disheveled Drunk – maybe he should look into it. Let people know what they were getting, as it were. The singer had no last name listed and didn't need one; like Beyoncé or Zayn, Milo seemed an entity unto himself.
"Chose to lie." Harry paused, fighting down the tears. "You lied to me instead. You let me think you understood, that you could empathize, that you knew how I felt!"
It was, as they said, sweet – very sweet, indeed.
“Yes. June 18th.” Harry was staring at him, and it unnerved him.
"No, I was awake. And now, I’m very awake, if you get my drift."
"You sound tired, like you need sleep. I bet you have circles under your eyes."
"Potter, please. Harry."
“Only one way to tell!" Charlie looked down at his smooth skin and smiled approvingly.
"It's way too long, Malfoy, and it’s driving me mental." Harry sighed. He rather hated it, it was in his face and in his eyes, but it did get him stroked and petted and he did enjoy that – he had to just hope that Draco was off this hair kick soon.
Harry looked up with that "skrewt caught in the headlights" look that he was rather known for, and blushed. "Molllllllyyyyy!"
"Yes, I do. It's quite nice, actually."
All he could do now is hope that Harry would understand when he finally revealed himself.
Harry nodded; he'd thought the same thing. "You should go back and check on the animals, calm them down in your special Hagriddy way." Harry tried to smile, but it faltered.
Harry took a couple of steps back until the back of his knees hit the sofa and he sat down hard. He stared at Draco, who looked back at him with all the calm he could muster.
Draco had learned from his mother. He had spent hours, days and sometimes even weeks trying to perfect piece after piece. It was an outlet for him, one that he could turn to when sad, happy, afraid or stressed and he would just float off into his own world. Disappear from reality.
Now, though, he was half asleep on Draco’s shoulder. Just listening to the blond play the song they had been learning and rocking to the movements of his arm. It was quite peaceful, Harry will admit. Just listening to the person he loves the most forget everything around him, but love Harry enough to bring him along.
———————
Harry chuckled. “Love you”
The commotion must have awoken the older blond as Harry felt a hand on his leg, he looked down to find another pair of silver grey eyes looking back at him questionly. Draco leant over slightly so he was looking at Scorp and then back to Harry as if asking what was wrong without speaking. Harry brought his hand up to rub Scor’s neck and mouthed ‘nightmare’ over his shoulder to his husband.
Scor pulled his stuffed toy giraffe up to under his chin and pulled his space-themed duvet around his shoulders, sinking further down. Scorp didn't know what time it was, so he tried going back to sleep.
Over the next two hours Harry had managed to play half of the song with no mistakes. It had taken a while, he will admit but Harry was quite pleased with himself.
“I had a dream, a bad one. You and dad were at the bottom of the stairs, there was rice, you were counting it. Someone stood behind you that could kill you if I breathed because the rice would fall. So i couldn't move. It was scary and I don't want you to go.” Scorpius siad, getting quieter as he went on.
Now, though, Harry wanted to learn how to play too. After the first time Draco played he had played many times before, it even helped Harry go to sleep sometimes, so Harry thought it was a good idea for him to learn.
Though, the minute the boy closed his eyes he could see down the stairs, see his parents at the bottom. They were counting rice granules. There was also someone standing over them in a black hood, Scorp couldnt breath, because if he did the rice would fall and his parents would have to start counting again. They were crying and begging him to stay still.
Harry looked up at his boyfriend and reluctantly moved over so that he was on the side of the seat. Draco sat elegantly down beside him. The seat was big enough that their elbows didn't clash, but small enough so their thighs were in contact.
Draco cracked his knuckles, just for the show of it, and turned in the seat to look at the Gryffindor. “Right, i have no idea what you were playing-” a frown invaded his eyebrows and he tilted his head slightly “-or what you were trying to play. But let's start off with the basics, shall we?”
Harry had heard this one before. Draco had told Teddy when he was younger too, Ted still came into their room if he was really scared but it had calmed the youngster for the most part. Draco had explained that his mother told him this useful piece of information when he was a boy, it works for kids' dreams that they find scary and the sort, but it wouldn't and didn't help with ones about the war. That's why he hasn't told Harry, he just went a different way of calming him when he got a nightmare.
“Yes!” Harry stated, “exactly like what I did. Except this time you're gonna help”. Scorpius grinned widely at the thought of helping his daddy beat bad guys. And Harry didn't miss the small smile that invaded his lover’s face either.
Harry looked up at his husband and then back down to his son and ruffled his hair. “We won't be leaving. Ever. we promise, right dad?” he looked back at Draco who was nodding, “right” Draco reassured.
Draco poked his son’s side and made him giggle and sit up in between his fathers. “Ya’know” he said, “dreams are pretty cool things, they're all up there”. He tapped his finger to the side of his head and then reached out to tap the side of Scorp’s. “Which means, you can change them if you think about it”.
Harry moved his head to rest on the bottom of Draco’s chest, looked up at him and groaned. “Yes, but you know how to play. Why shouldn't I?”. Even after all the years that the pair had been together their competitive streak towards had not died out. If anything it had grown along with the love for each other. So, maybe, playing the piano for Draco wasn't the only reason he wanted to play.
Harry saw the small pout on his son’s lips at the thought of sleep but he quickly said, “you can sleep here with us if you want”. That pout quickly turned into a big grin as Scorp snuggled into his dad’s arms.
Draco had worn his grey pressed trousers and a blue button down, with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and two buttons open, just for a tease.
Harry got back under the covers and pulled Draco up to rest his head on his shoulder as Scor wiggled himself between them. Harry rubbed his husband's back and his son’s hair at the same time as they drifted off to an unknown world.
A stray cat jumped from the neighbors roof to the Malfoy-Potter’s one and Scorp was up and out of the bed in a flash. He could be a big boy another day, today though, he just needed his daddy to hold his hand and tell stories while he snuggled close to his dad who rubbed his back.
Harry had simply just invited him for dinner, they had gone out on dates before and they have had dinner together all the time. But they haven't had it in Harry’s house before, it felt kind of intimate?
Harry wrapped his arms around the boy’s neck and looked over at Draco who had an eyebrow raised and was rubbing their son’s back. “Ok, Scorp. I won't leave” said Harry, “but can you tell us what happened?”
Harry sighed. He had been living with Draco long enough to know when to drop a conversation. “Yeah, i guess you’re right”. Harry went to get up off of the piano chair but the hands on his shoulders held him down.
Scorpius then turned his attention to Harry, who was onlooking his two favorite blonds in the world. “Did dad tell you that when you had bad dreams?” the younger blond asked. Harry grinned at him and nodded once. “Oh yes, he told me all the secrets for dreams” he said, “Like, when you see the rice on the stairs, you slide down it like a slide. Then you can save me and dad and get rid of the bad guy together.”
Scorp’s eyes swelled with unleaked water as he remembered the please of his fathers to stay still. Scorpios stayed still, not breathing or blinking for a second before giving up and opening the bedroom door.
Scorpios managed to stay awake for about ten minutes, just thinking, before his eyes started drifting closed. He was tired, but the rice and black hood that laid behind his closed eyes scared him too much to close them.
Harry turned and beamed up at him, and Draco might have just melted on the spot. “Yeah, yeah! I did, didn't I? That was so cool!”
Sitting in the far corner of the cozy living room was a piano, an exact replica of the one he had played on. This must have been the one his mother was talking about. A huge grin spread across his face as he ran his fingers over the keys. He placed his half full glass of wine on the body of the instrument before he sat on the piano’s chair.
“Hey buddy, what are you doing up?” Harry asked quietly.
Scorp looked up at draco with innocent, trusting eyes that he definitely learnt from Harry and still seemed to melt his heart. “Really?” the boy asked innocently. Draco nodded harshly “really”.
Harry woke with a start. He could feel something touch his face and the distant sound of a voice but he was too tired to tell from where or who. He slowly cracked an eye open when the noise or poking didn't go away.
Harry had gotten off early from work at the aurors office, he knew that Draco would be another hour or so longer so he would use the time. He hung his robes on the hook at the front door and went straight to the sitting room.
No, he couldn't go back to sleep. Maybe he could just wait it out until the sun rose and he could wake up? Yeah, he could do that.
That night, Harry fell asleep to John Legend’s All Of Me.
“Uhm, okay” Harry hesitantly placed each finger down where they were meant to be. Harry sighed at the sound that came out. It was all blotchy and sounded hasher to what Draco played which had been smooth and quiet. “I don't know Dray, it seems kind of hard”. Harry looked up at his boyfriend at the sound of a snort.
He looked up at Draco who had a confused but amused expression. “Whatcha doin Har?” he asked.
“Harry James Potter, since when have you ever given up? Hmm? You’re not going to get it on the first try. Look-” Draco moved his hands over Harry's again and placed his fingers down with Harry. “-all you need to do is make your hands flow with the music. Don't think of a beat. Just the second one finger lifts up, place the other down and it will be smooth”. Draco moved his fingers in time with Harry’s so they made a smoother version of the piece of music. “See! Look! You're already getting better”. He said after he lifted his hands. Draco couldn't help but be a little bit proud.
Scorpious emditly shot his eyes open, gasping for breath. Tears were rolling down his pale cheeks and he was holding the blue fluffy giraffe so tightly that his small hands were trembling. Scorp knew he couldn't go back to sleep. If he did, the bad hooded figure might come back and make him hold his breath until his chest was tight and eyes sore from tears.
Harry dropped his hands to his sides and sighed, how was he meant to figure this out, he wasn't even remotely good. Harry drooped his head onto the keys of the piano making it chime out from the contact. He took a deep breath in and let it out steadily.
Draco moved his head to nuzzle in the crook of Harry’s neck. “Takes one to know one,” he said tiredly.
Scorpios jumped up away from Draco and leaped onto Harry, wrapping his arms around the brunette's neck. His heart was beating a mile a minute. “No! No, p-please. You can't leave”. Scorp couldnt let his dad go, what if he didnt come back? Would he find him at the bottom of the stairs begging?
Thinking of those nice things he liked, Scorpios grabbed his blue giraffe and, in onesie padded feet, walked over to the door and opened it. His bedroom was at the end of the hallway, opposite Teddy’s. Scorpios needed to get to his parents room, one problem though, their bedroom was right beside the stairs.
“All i'm saying is that you probably won't be better than me. But that doesn't mean you can't play at all”. Draco removed his hands from his lover’s shoulder and walked over to the couch where he discarded his suit jacket and rolled up the sleeves on his white pressed shirt. The blond walked back over to Harry and shoved him lightly on the shoulder. “Shove over will you?”
Once he made it over to the bed he looked down at an unconscious Harry laying on the bed with his arm under Draco’s body. With the arm that wasn't clutching onto his teddy, Scrop readed out and poked his daddy in the face. He didn't know how else to wake him. “Daddy…..daddyyyyyy” he whispered as he continued to poke.
It was raining in England the very night Scorpious Malfoy-Potter had a nightmare. The rain was belting down on the roof, making the sound echo throughout the house. Scorpius woke in a cold sweat, breathing like he hasn't in years and sat bolt upright. It wasn't unusual for the small blond to have nightmares, especially if his daddy wasn't back from work when he went to bed. But nothing had scared him as much as this one had.
Harry was just finishing up the dishes when he heard the faint sound of music. He placed the tea towel down on the counter and set out to find where the music was coming from.
When he opened the door though, he was momentarially shocked. Draco just looked so...perfect. Harry suddenly felt kind of self conscious of his jeans and tight fitting t-shirt. But Draco seemed to like it, if looking him up and down counts as anything.
"You suppose correctly." His voice was tight and he stopped and sighed. "Sorry Pans."
"Aaron, I'm sure it is." Harry sighed. "I'm sure he's wrecked over it, but to show you that, well, it would give you power, wrong as that sounds. If he lets you see what you've done, that gives you power. You've made him feel terrible; he's cried, he's ranted and probably thrown things, but I know, for myself? For the first month, I was feeling like "I'll be fucked if I let Draco know what he's done to me, how he's made me feel like shit, worse than shit. I mean, you know what I even did one night?"
Harry turned and smiled at him warmly, leaning over to kiss his lips lightly. "Going to see what they're going to do to Ginny; Lucius is, apparently, not going to press formal charges since no one actually got injured, but Ginny's still being sent away."
Trelawney wasn't always off. In fact, sometimes she was pretty damned on.
Around him, girls were screaming Milo's name and, as expected, flashing him their chests, stomachs, and in an extreme case, below deck, as Oliver Wood used to say. Harry barely noticed – his eyes were fixed on Milo.
That smirk made him laugh and the strength seemed to return quickly after that.
"Harry changed his," said Draco glumly. "Totally just to spite me, too."
"Stay with me tonight?" Draco's voice was low, meant only for Harry, and Harry nodded. Together, they left the tent, and when Draco reached for his hand, Harry wrapped his fingers around Draco's and smiled.
Draco rubbed his forehead. Well then.
“I’ll never grow up and I’ll live here in Neverland forever!” Honestly, the child was woefully undereducated in some of the most important subjects.
Harry bit his lip for a second, then grinned. "Both? A mortal enemy who became someone very, very good."
"No, no, no, you moron! If Draco goes to one of those places, finds Potter, all he'll do is make it worse! Especially if he
He made it to the door and pulled it open; he'd forgotten to lock it again. Good thing there were no zombies roaming about, à la Shaun of the Dead, or he'd be toast. He leaned against the door frame. "What want?"
The first performance of the Magical Mystery Tour featuring the Marvelous Malfoys was deemed a rousing success, and the cash flow from that night – including merchandise sales – was impressive. Dumbledore left Minerva clacking away on her ancient calculator like a madwoman, a broad smile on her face and stacks of galleons surrounding her.
Harry looked her over; it was true that she plastered with eyeliner and lip gloss, was spilling out of her tank top and that her shorts seemed to be showing some cheek, but…"I didn't know they were supposed to be revealing on purpose, Gin - I thought you were just getting fat”
"Oh, fine then." Darcy turned away, and for the next half hour, he did a very good job of ignoring Harry entirely while he re-painted his toenails, touched up his eyeliner, looked through a magazine, cursed out a pair of new black lace hose and applied a wonderful-smelling body lotion to his legs and shoulders. Meanwhile, Harry snapped away, soft clicks in the background, shooting an entire roll of film of Darcy alone, fascinated by the way he moved and the expressions that crossed his face when he finally did forget that Harry was there.
"No, it wasn't, Harry," he whispered, huddled in a miserable ball against the door of the stall. "I never wanted to break the heart I treasured so much."
He stared at the picture of Draco Malfoy; Draco the Dragon with his perfectly straight, perfectly groomed blond hair, with those grey eyes that always looked disdainful, with those lips that looked made for kissing and biting and licking and all manner of other good things. A moment later, his blankets sprang up with alacrity and Harry glanced down. Hello there!
"Not really. It's a stress-free life, and after the rather tumultuous adolescence I had, stress-free sounds pretty damn good to me. And you haven't answered my question, either. How did such a Muggle-hater wind up fronting a band full of them and being worshiped by thousands more?"
God, he sounded so normal.
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, regretting it almost immediately as he coughed. Fuck it – if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. He lit a cigarette and ran a hand through his hair, taking a sip of his drink, until a very distinct tingle caused his head to snap up. A tremor along his spine, a sudden feeling of "Right there.”
"I bet you do, too." Harry handed over three hundred Euros.
loved Harry Potter, green-eyed git extraordinaire.
He tried to walk backward so he could talk to Draco more, but he found that he fell a lot that way, so had to walk facing forward. He still kept up a steady stream of chatter the whole way back and only stopped when he deposited the Malfoys at Dumbledore's office and then struggled his way to the guest tent with the luggage.
"Well, what did Potter do to look so different?" Pansy raised an eyebrow, and then took out her mobile, punching a number in from memory. "Hello, Paul? Pansy! I know, darlingest, it's been what, a week?"
"Draco." Blaise sat down beside him on the chaise lounge he kept in his dressing room for, well, lounging. "Tell me something; you had a boyfriend who loved you, was in love with you, did what you wanted him to do even if he hated it, who, by your own admission was fabulous in bed, and just basically perfect otherwise. What in the hell possessed you to go and fuck that up with whores who'd been had by Christ knows who? I don't understand."
"Yeah, like going out and enticing my boyfriend back by not being me but someone he might like better." The whole thought was depressing, and Draco swiftly downed another whiskey.
love, possibly because Harry was the only person he ever
"Thanks." Draco looked around and then pulled up another drum and sat down. "No one's owned up, huh?"
Dumbledore offered the use of his tent, and Lucius accepted, for once not having a snarky comeback ready. The two Malfoys were gently shepherded off and the rest of the group wandered off in twos and threes, leaving only Harry and Hagrid still there at the scene.
She disappeared again and now Draco blushed. "Is she always this mental?"
Head thrown back, neck arching, mouth open in what Draco knew was a long, drawn out moan of pleasure. Harry's hands would be in the other man's hair, his hips bucking shamelessly, and his eyes - Draco knew the eyes would be wild and dark.
& & &
The show went well; the new clown routine had been refined and the crowd roared with laughter in all the right places. Bill and Ron had created and worked out a new jump that was almost enough to stop your heart, and was greeted with wild applause. Harry hit the target on the first try, and Filch actually counted to four this time. The Not-Quite-Human Pincushion performed a one-man skit with a nail gun that was a huge success, and the Octo-Sapien created a lovely sushi sampler from his tail. Dumbledore debuted his new Ringmaster costume, which borrowed heavily from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and the Malfoys were a sinuous vision in red silk.
THAT was living. This was existing, going through the motions.
Once everyone was out, more or less safely, then the water and smothering spells could be cast, and the fire was soon extinguished.
Harry stood and looked him in the eye. "I'm doing what *I* want from now on, get it? And even better, I'm telling you now, not hiding it or waiting for you to find out by accident!"
The amount would have made even Draco blanch in any other circumstances; if this was routine for Pansy, he hoped Nott kept making money and invested it wisely, or his wife's expensive tastes were gonna land him in debtor's prison. But he handed the man his Gringott's card and added a large tip to the amount, signing off and leaving the salon, Blaise beside him, close, a silent show of support.
His breathing quickened as he felt his orgasm build, and Draco strained against the knowing hand on his cock, wanting more friction, demanding it, even as he pushed harder and harder against Harry, their damp skin slapping wetly together. Draco was squeezing the back of Harry's neck, the other hand clawing at his back through the thin fabric of his T-shirt. His head was thrown back against the cement and he was sure he would be bruised all up and down his shoulders and back.
While Potter was busy sipping away and studiously not making eye contact, Draco took note of his surroundings. The décor consisted of papers and magazines, take away containers, several 'dead soldiers' and at least three overflowing ashtrays – and that was just in the living room. He didn't dare consider what the loo or bedroom might look like. Potter was a lush, apparently, and it didn't look like anything had been dusted or vacuumed in eons, and nothing looked particularly cared for or about. The air was saved from being unbearable only by the fact that every window seemed to be open, or else Draco was sure a fog would settle over the room as well.
Harry Apparated and Draco stared at the space where he'd been.
"Is it to be Dutch tonight, after all?" There was that husky voice, but it didn't seem particularly masculine. "Aren't you afraid of misspeaking? Perhaps you might ask me if I play the sitar or know how to dance in the Spanish style."
When the DJ finally called a break, Draco made his way to the downstairs bar, fighting his way through throngs of men, some of whom would normally would have caused him to stop and stare or flirt outrageously until a frustrated Potter would drag him away. But tonight, he saw only Harry.
While it was mostly the younger Weasleys who attempted the most daring moves, the elders were no slouches and on the ground, Lucius Malfoy had to grudgingly admit that the rather stodgy appearances of the parents belied their strength and grace. And while the daughter had a rather large posterior, it hadn't affected her ability to fly through the air with the greatest of ease, as it were.
Draco nudged Harry over onto his back and lay next to him, his head resting on Harry's chest, his fingertips stroking the dark hair there.
& & &
Once inside, the door shut and locked and barred against the rest of the world, Draco turned to Harry and asked simply, "Now what?"
Harry had been half-listening, but now snapped to attention. "Sexually inadequate? What's that supposed to mean?" He looked down at his crotch reflexively – Harry J. appeared to be pouting, and Harry scowled in sympathy.
"You're actually reading a book?" His surprise was evident. Harry raised a brow. "What, you think I can't read?"
Alone?
"Harry, Simons is a known toadwort addict; you can't take his word on anything."
One, when there should be two.
Harry's stomach grumbled, an almost threatening sound. Draco laughed. "You better get on with your breakfast then."
Draco smirked. "Maybe it is, or maybe I'm just happy to see you."
Draco laughed. "That could be arranged."
The old Milo had loved the road; the new Milo tolerated it. The old Milo had bedded any and all of those who caught his fancy; the new one had eyes for one person and one person only.
"I didn’t want to be caught!" That was not what he meant to say, at all. He tried to fix it. "I wanted to talk to you about it, all of it, but you wouldn't even give me the time of day! You went out, changed everything about you to spite me, and now won't even talk to me about it!”
“Well, I wasn’t there of course, but let’s see…you discussed Quidditch all morning in the “office” with Weasley, went to a booze-soaked lunch on an expense account with some eager sponsor, then spent the afternoon touring the Specialty Broom Shop under the pretense of finding the best new series for the team next year, then had tea with Wood, listened to him blather on about his fabulous new contract with Puddlemere United, then came home utterly exhausted.”
Harry hadn't missed the stammer. "Sounds like you aren't sure what the status of your relationship is."
"Yes." Harry had found the page he wanted, where Surly explained the major rules of wizarding investigation.
Harry was pulling on his jacket and sliding his wand into his pocket. "Ron was here; he came in to tell me the news and say sorry on behalf of the family, which is rubbish, cause I don't blame any of them, ever…and then he saw you there and had a fit of temporary hysterical blindness. He'll be all right though, in time." Draco had to laugh, and got up as well, dressing quickly. He wanted to see this.
Harry shrugged and stubbed out his cigarette. "I like your band; the music is pretty good, even considering that you sing it. And I do occasionally get out of the house. Scotch, cigarettes, and food don't appear on their own, you know?"
As the crowd dispersed, he watched Charlie lead a somber Lucius away and could only hope that a night of debauchery and scanty lingerie were in the offering, because his son's narrow escape from Death had apparently affected him more than Harry would have thought. Charlie, too, looked serious, but wouldn't for long; it wasn't in his nature.
"Hey, what are you doing still up? Did I wake you?"
Draco had expected this, sort of. "I know that it looks that way."
Draco had reflected in that moment that if there really were a hell (well, one worse than having Voldemort randomly killing Muggles on your formal dining room table) then his own personal one would be to have to relive these small moments when he knew for certain how his actions had affected Harry – and forever and ever, he would have to see the hurt in those eyes, hear the uncertainty in his voice, see the shadow pass over his face when he spoke about the night he'd found out that Draco had cheated on him and how afraid he was that Draco really didn't want him anymore.
Harry snorted. "I should be so lucky. The way my life goes, he'll fall for…I don't know, Percy or someone."
“I hope not; I don’t know.”  Draco felt a cold kiss on his cheek – then Harry was gone and he was alone in the shadows of the dead.
The Guardian was quiet on a Monday night, and it was not hard to spot the dark head in the last booth near the wall. Harry walked over and reached down, taking Draco's arm. "Come with me."
Draco had scowled briefly, out of habit, then sighed himself. “Think he’s there, Sev?”
Harry nodded and took a sip of his drink. Draco continued. "He thought things were fine between us, and so did I, actually, but I…" He bit his lip. "I did something phenomenally stupid and he found out and left me."
"Maybe people need incentive to get through the rest of their work week."
"I know, right? And, erm, Happy Hemelvaartsdag."
"God yes; he's all I've ever fucking wanted in this life. We shouldn't even BE together, given the shit we've lived through, but I love him."
"You're doing a bang-up job." Draco sighed. "Look, Potter, I came to give you back your jacket and to …"  To do what?
Perhaps he and Draco both, finally, deserved some of those.
"You're on."
Charlie grinned. "You really think so?"
On Saturday, Draco found himself feeling decidedly antsy. He couldn't concentrate on anything except seeing Harry, having drinks or dinner or whatever with him, in a place where you didn't have to scream to be heard and where they could, finally, talk - about the situation, about them, even though Draco wasn't supposed to be Draco.
Underneath the date was a picture of a smiling Sirius holding a baby, surrounded by a woman with red hair and a man who looked suspiciously like the one who shared his bed.
Harry's heart was pounding, and he couldn't tear his eyes away from the man standing just mere feet from him, his eyes sweeping the crowd.
If he was extremely lucky, Harry would turn on his back as he slept and Draco could watch his face, watch the black lashes flutter as he dreamed, watch the lips part slightly as he breathed. Harry smelled like alcohol and cigarette smoke and sometimes cologne which may or may not have been his; it didn't smell like anything Draco had ever bought him, and he'd never known Potter to buy his own.
His name.
He turned and made his way back to the eating tent, making the cook very happy by having not just seconds, but thirds of everything.
Draco stared morosely into his drink, his cigarette burning down between his fingers, until Blaise sighed and reached over, taking it from his hand and taking a last drag off it himself before stubbing it out in the ashtray that already had far too many butts in it. "Draco, look, stalking Potter isn't going to help matters."
Harry was picking frosting out of his eyebrows. "I figured that out, thanks. Where was your sage advice five minutes ago?"
Christ, he really needed to not smoke so much; he sighed as he thought of Draco and how the air in the flat the past two or three weeks had been stale and dead. Draco was smoking like a chimney and Harry knew that he was the reason why. He didn't know why in hell he’d picked up the habit, except that it seemed the thing to do in a bar or club, and sometimes you just needed something to do with your hands.
They left the bar, ignoring the amused glances of several patrons as they exited; the bar had filled up while they were occupied, and apparently, they hadn't exactly been quiet.
“I wanted to be with you.”
going away and he really didn't want to be dancing the itchy-itchy jig when Draco "Why Yes, I Am A God" Malfoy showed up.
He finished the brownie and his coffee, then folded his hands. "You know that whore I told you about? It's Draco. Darcy – that's the name he used – is Draco."
& & &
Harry looked up briefly, then went back to his mail. "No, we don't. I understand, Draco. We've been together a couple of years, it's gotten routine, I get it. You want variety, and so you've been looking elsewhere. It’s fine."
Draco turned the photo face down on the bedside table - he’d been staring at it for hours and it had finally become too much for him to take. Watching himself smile as the ring was placed on his finger, then glancing up at the person who was holding his hand tight as his other hand tilted Draco’s face up for the sealing kiss…then watching Harry’s grin light the picture up as he turned his face towards the crowd of friends and loved ones in respond to the “It’s about damn time!” shouted by one Ron Weasley, who was already three sheets to the wind, thanks to an early arrival and the well-stocked open bar. Harry had laughed at that and held up Draco’s hand with the gleaming gold band on it in triumph.
And finally, lying with his new husband in their bed at the extremely posh resort in the Bahamas, he had looked down into them and knew that he would never want to be anywhere else than wherever Harry was.
"Ginevra Weasley!" scolded Molly who was never far from her erm, adventurous daughter. "The last thing you should be doing is fantasizing about some young man's posterior. It's very unseemly."
More than he ever loved you.
"You'd do me anyway, you slut." But Draco turned to the mirror and nearly passed out cold. His own shoulder-length pale blond hair was a memory - what he had now was far shorter and much darker blond with selective lighter streaks artfully placed here and there, twisted and waxed at strategic points. "Holy shit!”
Severus sighed. “It’s Tower Hamlets, in Southern Grove.”
She nodded, then looked to the other whore. "He's looking for Darcy, right?"
He spotted Aaron walking down the street from the other direction and wondered briefly where the other man lived. They reached the door at nearly the same time and gave each other a warm smile.
Lucius glared back. "It's imported velvet! And gold Italian trim!"
For someone who made his living tracking, pursuing and capturing bad, bad people, Harry had a rather terrible sense of direction and couldn't tell where he'd already been, but wasn't worried. He had time.
"So, did you get all your pictures? Are you satisfied with the pictorial of my life so that we can go on to have some fun?" He stood, Onyx jumping off his lap, and moved over to Harry, touching his cheek. "I have a feeling you're a brilliant kisser – are you?"
"Oh for Christ sakes, Draco - you own the bloody company! You could go to the office in a gorilla suit and no one would dare even flinch. But this is perfect - you look nothing like you, really, but still, so hot. When Harry spies you he will be so hard for you that he will just …”
He made his voice cold, thick with hurt though it was. "No. And if you're never going to fucking let this go, Harry, then why come home at all? For more barbs? More snide comments? You must have had time to think up new ones; I'm surprised you haven't owled me with them, or are you saving them up to welcome me home with?" Inside his stomach twisted and he felt sick.
Draco waited.
"Great." He was still trying to steady his breathing. Panic, anger and an average of a pack and a half of cigarettes a day was not helping him catch his breath.
Draco sighed and took another long drag, letting the smoke settle in his lungs. "I shudder to think exactly what you two have in mind."
"Mmmhmmm." The older women stretched out her leg. "Damn, I have a run in my best stockings. Oh well. In a few hours, the men will all be drunk, and won't notice anyway. Makes me wonder why I still bother for them, the sots."
"I know the feeling - I'm going through that myself." Harry sighed and lit a cigarette, offering the pack to Draco, who took one as well.
Harry had leaned against the table, shoving a hand through his hair, which had grown out a bit over the past weeks; Draco had been oddly pleased to see that when they were together, Harry was much more casual, much more like the Harry he'd fallen in love with years and years ago. While Club!Harry was hot, no mistake, he was also removed and unavailable. This Harry was warm and present and funny and kind - and sexy as hell.
"He's her darlingest, Draco, weren't you paying attention?"
It wouldn't be any less than he deserved.
“I will.” Draco turned from the fireplace and sighed. He hated cemeteries on principal – it was his belief that if not disintegrated by magical means, that bodies should burn on stone pyres like kings of old. Burial seemed unnecessary and open caskets barbaric.
"I've apologized to him, though, you know? I've said I was sorry, said I was wrong, said I would do anything to make it up to him, and he doesn't want to hear it." Draco had forgotten momentarily that he wasn't supposed to be talking about them, but about Aaron and Harry's respective boyfriends.
He realized his mind was wandering and tried to focus on the big black man sitting across from him, flipping parchment like he was sorting and collating it. Maybe he was – budget cutbacks and all.
"Sure, yeah - how about The Guardian at 6 pm? It's a nice place; not formal but not a…"
Draco had turned to watch Harry, feeling like he was watching a stranger. "I didn't have any plans, really.”
Harry had a laptop – he'd bought it in a rare moment of thinking he should really get his shit together and get a life, and a computer. Computers had something on them called the internet, and people with lives were on the internet – of this he was certain. When he had relayed that thought to Hermione, whom he'd called to come set up this electronic miracle, she'd snorted. He hadn't asked why, and a year and a half later, he still knew nothing of the internet, other than that video poker was often a really bad idea. And there was porn –  lots of porn. By the grace of God and a credit card, any kink you had could be viewed, paused, rewound, and viewed again. And again, and again, till it was imprinted on your corneas for life.
The door swung shut and Draco opened the stall door and moved over to the sink; his eyes were red and his lids puffy. He splashed water on his face and re-did the glamour, fiddling with it until he was satisfied before going back to the table.
"I'm sorry, but could I possibly bum a smoke off you? I'm all out and this place, well.”
He reached into the bag and came up with three pieces of popcorn, which he let lie in his palm. "The person who let the Graphon out was eating popcorn at the time. They had a box of it after their performance, as is their habit, and they were still eating it when they went to "Keep Perce company." Then they waited for the performance, and when they realized it wasn't Draco out there, they became angry and let the Graphon loose. The Graphon knew its target because part of Draco's torn costume from the sticking event was tossed into his cage."
He wasn't the only one who did.
& & &
Lucius clapped a hand over Draco's mouth before he could say anything else, and shook his head. "No, Harry - that will be all."
Draco sighed. "I guess," he said slowly. "You survive being shot out of a cannon by a moron four times a week after all. What the hell is up with his inability to count?"
"I can't," Draco hissed back. "I can't move."
Then he moved the few feet to the bed and crawled into those waiting arms.
When he could breathe, he began to walk shakily towards a spot he could Apparate from, but a slight movement in the windows that lined the street made him glance up.
Harry snorted a bit. "I do. Maybe I'll skive out early, come home, take a nap."
A moment later he was back, looking flustered. "Shit, Zabini, home! I can't go home looking like this -  the game would be over in a hot minute.”
Dudley had seen him off with a clumsy hug and a baggie of green stuff and since then, Harry had managed to keep himself supplied – he figured it was better than booze and less expensive than designer potions, geared for the old-money set who were now out on their collective butts, armed with only whatever they'd been able to hide before the Ministry seized their assets. The potions were cheap, with substandard ingredients badly mixed and Harry had seen them cause more trouble than they were worth.
He didn't know, but before he could ride further on this train of thought, the light in the window behind him came on and he turned to see Darcy reclining on her daybed – his daybed, rather, looking a bit tired, but lovely as he remembered. Harry swallowed hard, and walked over to the window.
Lovely.
And for the first time in his life, Draco Malfoy didn't care who heard him cry.
Several games - and several ales - later, they were both royally pissed and had to occasionally prop themselves up on the other in order to shoot. "Thishh," said Harry finally, "Ish dangerous. Gonna put an eye out here."
"It really is," agreed Harry. "It's kind of odd; I've missed quiet. My uhm, friend is away on business, so last night I stayed in. I cooked all the stuff I like and he doesn't, and almost watched some telly, but then I decided to just turn everything off and just listen to nothing. It was really peaceful, oddly enough."
Draco was breathing harder now, his voice raspy and hoarse. "You'll let it all slip away and not give a damn at all!"
This, right now, was the perfect time to say simply, "I don't," then get up and walk out the door. It was the opening of a lifetime. Draco knew what had happened to Potter now, he was sufficiently disgusted by his surroundings, and this was the best possible time to pull his superiority blanket around him like a cloak and stalk out of Harry Potter's life. One couldn't ask for more.
For some reason, that made Harry laugh and laugh and then finally Draco had to as well - then Harry had pulled him down onto the couch and made love to him, again and again until they were both exhausted, mentally, emotionally, and physically.
They both recognized each other's signs and didn't have to do more than mutter before they both came, at very nearly the same time, both of them straining and pulsing against each other, and to Draco, the sweetest sound ever heard was Harry gasping his name.
"Possibly," Harry agreed. "But, you know, I know you have your escorts when you're in need of "participation," so I'm sure you're…"
Harry thought for a moment; drinks were not a commitment, he wasn't cheating this way, right?
Harry nodded. She tilted her head. "You two would be darling together; do feel free to come back when you acknowledge your feelings for each other."
"For now." The clerk handed him his key. "We do try and present a distinctly Muggle façade, so if you'd keep the Apparating, spell casting, charming, hexing, cursing or Unforgivables to a minimum, Management would appreciate it."
He almost, Harry thought, almost sounded like Draco Malfoy. His voice didn't have the same sneering undertones, or the tinge of bitterness that he associated with Malfoy, but there was something about it nonetheless. And Milo was blond, too.
- are telling me to man up? The man who was distraught when his purple velvet hostess gown was wrinkled?"
Hermione's expression changed, became thoughtful, and then she sighed and shook her head. "You'd left England for training in the US by the time this happened, and it probably slipped by you, afterwards, but Draco, along with Greg Goyle and a few others, were part of a Ministry experiment, I guess you'd call it."
"… virile man like yourself shouldn't go and sow his wild oats, yes?"
need?”
How Draco managed to get through the rest of the show, he never knew; all he could think later was that he obviously had a hell of an auto-pilot, because his band mates congratulated him afterwards on an over-the-top show. He himself remembered nearly nothing, save for the one pair of eyes he had stared into for too long a moment, seconds after he came on stage.
The act was somewhat abbreviated, but had gone on well enough, and then it was time for final skits and such. There had been no attack, not even the slightest sign of danger, and Draco found himself breathing a sigh of relief. Obviously those other two incidents had been just coincidental…terribly bad luck, granted, but happenstance only.
He was hanging around the tent flap trying to look casual – and failing utterly – when the Marvelous Malfoys emerged, Lucius looking calm and Draco resentful. Harry immediately latched on to Draco, which did nothing for the other boy's mood. "Have you eaten? Do you need to? Do you want me to show you around? “
"Why everyone? That seems a little wide-ranging, Potter."
"You have to! I'm losing all sensation in a place," and here, Lucius' voice dropped even further. "That I can ill-afford to!"
"What a dump," Draco said succinctly, and Harry bristled a bit, then sighed. "I'm sure it's not what you're used to, Draco, but you are a wizard and I'm sure you will find a way to make this suit you."
"That's because you smell like skrewt shit most of the time," she hissed, the first words she'd said through all this. She turned her eyes to Harry. "Fine. I did it, I did all of it. Happy, Mr. Detective?"
On the street, Draco pulled up his collar. "My bloody neck is freezing, Zabini."
Harry was barely awake when the knock sounded on his front door the next day; he hadn't fallen into fitful sleep until somewhere in the vicinity of five AM, and he'd been so wasted that he had never made it to his bed, but had tumbled off the couch into a pile of laundry that needed folding. It was comfortable enough down there with the pajama bottoms, t-shirts, towels and the like, and it was there he remained until the banging on his door caused him to blink, raise his head, and then rap it smartly on the table.
The search was immediately fruitful, as the band had its own website, complete with pictures, biographies, tour dates, and links to download their latest CD. Harry read it all, taking a particularly close look at their lead singer, the possessor of that brilliant voice.
"Kind of congested, stuffy, hoarse."
“In two hours - think you can keep it in your pants that long?”
The cool night air was welcome, and Draco leaned against the building, the damp of the bricks seeping through his thin shirt. He took a deep swig of Grey Goose and let his breath out in a long sigh.
Maybe you bored him senseless, but his stupid Gryffindoric loyalty kept him with you until you fucked up and he could flee. Maybe he likes this life, loves it, even.
His camera.
"Sets off your eyes, along with the darker hair, which, despite your bitching and moaning about it, does look hot." Blaise handed him the clothes. "Get dressed and I'll do the glamour."
"It's my wand."
"Harry?" Draco had cleared his throat twice before managing to call his name; his mouth was dry and he kept licking his lips to wet them.
Before Draco could debate that, Sybill Trelawney emerged, waving her thick glasses about. "Ah, hello boys! Here to divine your future? I'm offering a two-for-one special in light of these awful events, as people are understandably, quite anxious."
He clicked it on and scrolled through the numbers called for the last month. There it was.
"Yep…and I'm happy to see you." He grinned in return.
Very anxious, if the state of Draco Malfoy's three centerfolds were any indication.
"Did," Harry replied. "Whores don't kiss on the lips I'm told, so you actually got more than your money's worth with that one." He smiled slightly and moved past Draco, his beer held loosely in his fingers. "Do I have mail?"
Or, right, Draco. Fuck. Harry wasn't with it enough yet to figure out if he could play cool or not, but knew that Malfoy wouldn't leave till he opened the door, at least.
"Either way it packs a punch; three of those and I'm on the floor somewhere or against the wall and won't remember a damn thing afterwards." He gave the shot glasses to the bartender. "I'll be sticking with tequila for my shots, thanks."
"Yes." Darcy turned his head to brush a soft kiss over Harry's palm before moving his hand away. "A lovely memory for a lovely man."
"Excuse me," said Harry, and oh, God, that voice.
Harry had to try a couple of times before he could speak, but when he could, he murmured "Yes – cocoa and hemp is one of my favorite ways to get my daily recommended dosage of relaxation."
Harry snorted. "Yeah. Ten minutes and you'll have wanked and will be asleep."
Harry, for his part, was enjoying himself; he'd found he really liked to dance, and blamed his former reticence entirely on 4th year and being traumatized by McGonagall and Patil. He doubted he'd ever waltz again, but fortunately his current lifestyle didn't entail many ballroom moves other than an occasional dip when Draco decided to get romantic and put on soft music before bed, but since that kind of dancing led invariably to shagging, he was okay with it. Come to think of it, so did this sort of dancing, for some people, at least.
is not about you? Ever? This is about me, how *I* feel, what I'm doing, but of course, nothing is ever about me, it’s all you; how stupid of me to forget that!"
& & &
"What would Potter possibly want in a fetish bar?"
He went to bed early that night, and dreamed of icy-eyed blonds and soft fingers touching his cheek - and other places best not mentioned in mixed company.
"Sure, I mean, it's not like we ever planned on being exclusive or committed, and it's not like we're in love with each other." Harry's voice was expressionless. "You like me, I'm fond of you, but that's about the extent of it, so yeah. I'm fine with it." He drained his beer. "I just came by to check up, say hey, and pick up a change of pants." He looked at Draco, who appeared stunned. Harry smiled. "Close your mouth, Malfoy. I am going out tonight, though, so you know and won't worry."
"We didn't have sex, he just, uhm, pleasured me orally. And damn, he was good, too. Amazing, in fact; you should see his face when he does this little thing with his tongue that makes me want to …”
Harry had spent the day thinking about Draco; he had pulled out photo albums and looked at them; saved notes; invitations addressed to them both, everything that reminded him of their life together. He'd replayed their fights in his head, and then the make-up sex later. He wondered what he was doing going out with someone else, even in the most casual circumstances, but he told himself that he wasn't looking for anything from Aaron; they were both in fucked up situations and were just a couple of blokes crying into their beers, right?
"Mhmm," nodded Hermione. "Lucius died there, but Narcissa's still inside."
"Good."
His voice had gotten small and Harry swallowed. "And all this time when you were gone, I thought you had found someone else. I fucking tortured myself with the images and fears and all the time you were there, and you heard them and you could have said, "Harry, it's me, I'm here and I love you.”
Harry nodded. "So, do you think your partner will come back to you?"
"All valid points." Draco took a sip of his vodka before racking up the billiard balls to give himself something to do. "Are you looking forward to, or dreading, this talk with Draco?" It felt very odd to say his own name, like it had nothing to do with him.
"Come on Mum…have you seen Malfoy's arse? Either one of 'em? They're pretty damn sweet." This comment came from Charlie, who was taking this time to spangle his newest costume with bronze sequins, to match his eyes. Molly sighed.
"Harry?"
Darcy let out a short laugh. "Is anyone truly happy in their life?"
The resulting kiss earned another chorus of wolf whistles and applause and Draco had had to restrain himself from dragging Harry into the nearest bathroom and ravishing him soundly.
Harry tugged Draco into the loo without any further words, and shut and locked the door behind them before turning, tossing his glasses onto the sink and with one fluid move pinned Draco to the damp and slightly sticky cement wall. And before Draco could speak, Harry's mouth crashed down onto his, covering it and kissing him hungrily. He forced his tongue between Draco's lips and plundered his mouth, seeking and finding all the hidden spots, sliding his hot tongue along the roof of Draco's mouth.
Unlike Hermione, Ginny, Fleur, Gabrielle, and Merlin knew who else, who all found him obnoxious when he was high, the female residents of Amsterdam seemed to take him in stride. Either they were extremely tolerant people, or, as Harry suspected, they all partook in various calming herbs as well, for they listened to his stories, applauded his impressions and cheered him on in karaoke. He thought his rendition of "Rocket Man" was particularly impressive, and no one told him any differently.
"Thank you, Galadryoda." Harry stood up and brushed off the crumbs, then retrieved the mangled bun for the baby hippogriffs and set off for the cafeteria once again, still scrubbing at his unruly-under-the-best-of-circumstances eyebrows.
He watched Darcy bite his lip, then nod again. "Goodnight."
"…there isn't anything left. Right. I'll get my stuff together and move out tomorrow." Harry made his voice flat, cold, pushing it all down.
Draco's life wasn't quite – all right, not at all – what he had planned, either, but he was happy enough. He enjoyed dressing in leather, wearing eyeliner, and looking down into a sea of adoring fans. He liked going on tour, interviews where his every word was hung upon, and the plethora of free goodies that came his way. He liked taking a different pretty boy or girl to bed every night and then turning them loose the next day with a smile, autograph, and a promise (never kept) of looking them up the next time he was in town. He liked not having any ties.
A million feelings were spinning through his head as he took Draco in. There had to have been a glamour, true, but the face wasn't that different. How in hell had he not known? How had he not seen Draco underneath?
Severus had shaken his head in despair when he had floo-called him to find out where Sirius’s grave was. “You’ve been married a year, together for how many before that, and you don’t know something as important to Harry as this?”
Draco wrinkled his nose.“Hmmm, that my husband chose this day to be a prat to me when I come home, tired and wanting nothing more than to be cuddled and…”
Kingsley cleared his throat. "And I see that you haven't taken a vacation in four years. In fact, you barely have more than two days strung together, and you're way overdue. I think a break would be good for you."
What the hell? Draco found himself looking at the spot where Harry had been a moment before, then got up and looked around helplessly, until something caught his eye.
Finally, it was time for their act…well, not
She ignored him completely and yanked him down the street. "Do keep up, Draco, for Merlin's sake."
Cheered, he went back to his office, which he shared with another Auror, the aforementioned Adams. "I'm going on vacation, Sam," he told him. He enjoyed the irony of the name, as Adams was a rabid teetotaler, hence his deep need for coffee. "Apparently, I have a lot of time, and Shacklebolt is afraid I need a break from the rigors of work."
"It's been weeks!"
"Well, this is an improvement – now you're actually calling in the morning and not in the middle of the night. And you addressed me by name and said you had a question. AND you have on pants. Good job."
Pansy was nodding as well; "It really does, Paul - we're brilliant! You're brilliant! Draco, look."
Tequila? He and Harry had had that only once, at George Weasley's wedding, and Harry had, at Seamus' urging, swallowed the worm and been absolutely loony and delusional for the next three days. It had been alternately hysterical and worrisome as Harry claimed the toast was quoting Shakespeare to him, and that his soap on a rope was really Draco's dead father speaking from the grave.
He gave Harry a small smile. "When you go back to whatever world you live in the rest of the time, that is."
Harry and Draco looked at each other and shuddered in unison.
It was at times like this when Draco cursed not only his upbringing, but his tendency to take the person he loved most in the world for absolute granted.
"And I was sorry, but you didn't care, you were having a piss fit!”
The lights were hot and he tossed the kernels on the ground before wiping his face. "I didn't think much of you and Ron tossing stuff off the upper catwalk the other day; I figured you two were just passing time, and Ron was. But you were seeing how fast something would fall, and you made sure that you were on that catwalk before the show, "testing the ropes," when what you were really doing was cutting the anchor wires on the lamp, leaving one to fray. When the cannon went off, the vibrations shook the last remaining wire, so that it would drop momentarily. You figured one way or the other, someone would get hurt. "
He rapped his wand on the wood to call for order – a signal that went largely ignored. He sighed. "Silence!" he called, his voice lost in the babble. He then shook his head and pulled out his wand, casting a Sonorous charm. "SILENCE!" he boomed. This time, the room quieted, until the only sound was the Fat Lady trying to cross her legs…it sounded much like two rubber rafts being jostled together in the back of a very small wagon. Finally, she managed, and folded her arms, staring at Dumbledore. He stared back for a moment, before turning his glance to the rest of the assembled folk and decided to dispense with preamble and pleasantries. "You have, I trust, all heard the rumors that the Tour is to acquire a new act."
He rolled over on his side and looked at the man stretched out on his stomach next to him.
Draco didn't even have to think. If he was going to sit down anywhere in Potter's sty, he needed liquid courage. "Got any brandy?"
Lucius was in the center ring, and his raised voice could be heard above the din. "This is the last straw, Albus! I demand that something be done about all this! My son is being targeted by someone in your organization, and twice, they've come very close to killing him! Not just hurting, which would be unacceptable enough, but killing him!" He took a breath. "I don't give a damn about our contract; I'm taking myself and my son out of this shabby, second-rate little…"
This was the point, he thought, as he watched two of the burlier clowns lead Ginny away, where she should shout "And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids!" Or where Surly O'Sullivan would tap the notebook closed with his wand, extinguish the lights in his office and go to the pub and get hammered while pondering the human condition.
He managed to nod and exited the club first, waiting in a shadowy alley to make sure Harry came out alone too and made no side trips to say, the loo or a back room, but Harry came out, pulling up his collar against the cold breeze and Apparating as soon as he got to a suitable point. Draco then went home, crawled into bed with Harry's sweatshirt and dreamed of waking wrapped around Harry.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the smell emanating from the other boy; it wasn't rose cologne that was for sure. "What do you do there? Clean up bear shit?"
Draco pushed his tongue against those lips, which opened for him, slack, while Draco slid his tongue around Harry's mouth; his breath was scotch and cigarettes, and tasted nothing like the Harry he knew.
“Don’t say that if you don’t mean it, Draco - making changes out of guilt alone is never a good idea.”
"That's him. He makes a hell of a girl, though. Acts like one, too, which isn't saying anything good. He's shallow, selfish, greedy and manipulative. Yet he gets all the business he can handle, the bitch." The younger of the whores shrugged. "He makes the rest of us work harder, just to keep up."
"Two PM."
"Do ya…uh…"
"Do I have to?"
Pansy had caught up with them. "Now for clothes!”
The afternoon stretched long as they lay tangled in each other, and there were few words spoken, because there were so few words to say.
Next to Molly, Draco shuddered, and Harry noticed that Lucius had taken a spot beside Draco, and Charlie was sitting behind him, braiding his hair. It had to be love.
"Yes. It's sort of the stock in trade of geniuses, I guess." Harry scratched his neck. Christ, there was still frosting here and there, and he's washed as thoroughly as he possibly could. That stuff really was spackletastic.
"I just wanted to go to sleep; it had been a night where everything had crashed in on me, I'd had a horrible time out, felt guilty, all that shit. I felt him slide over to my side and wrap his arm around my waist and start touching me. And no matter what else I'm feeling, he knows how to touch me. We started having sex, and I had to push it all down and pretend it wasn't my Draco, that it wasn't the person I love more than anything stroking me and kissing me, but I finally did it. Then I looked up at him and saw his face and had this sudden thought of how many other guys have seen his "come" face?"
"Good, we have something in common then; I also don't mean anything to you." Harry wrenched his shoulder away and went over to the closet, grabbing his jacket, ripping it off the hanger with a sharp twist.
“Spare me the discourse on my lack of empathy; I’ve been kicking myself for the last hour as it is. Which one is it?”
Harry looked up at Draco, who was standing opposite him at the table, his hands gripping the curve of the chair. "You got me there - I don't know what the fuck, Malfoy." He went back to his paper, a moment before it was ripped away from him.
"The Graphon was a tricky one, though, Gin…I have the popcorn and I have the bit of Draco's costume, but the keys?"
The groundskeeping shed was nearby, and he was able to retrieve a small gardening trowel, which he used to carefully dig around the footprint, lifting it out and balancing it on his palm. "Nox," he whispered, and carried it back to his room, laying it on a piece of parchment and sliding it under his bed. He washed his hands and face and slid into bed, his mind whirling.
Draco never begged; he shouted, he screamed, he slammed things down and threw things, but he never begged or pleaded. And somewhere in the back of Harry's mind, he knew this was costing Draco everything to say.
"Great." He sighed. "Sorry, Blaise – it’s not you, I appreciate this, really. It just all feels so fake. Why can't he talk to me? Why won't he accept my apology? Why? I don't get this! I've tried over and over and I want to tell him how much I love him and miss him and he doesn't even want to hear it." He bit down on his lip.
Grumbles ensued and he coughed loudly to restore order.
The crowd roared and waved, and the family waved back before going into their first drop, one so sudden and so unexpected, that it always caused gasps, as it did this time as well. Bill flipped over three times before his brother Ron caught his hand and pulled him up, only to fling him at Charlie, who rolled over him on his way to the other side.
He looked up at Ginny. "And you, Ginevra, will have to face the consequences of your actions -  in the morning. You will spend the night, under house watch, with Minerva in her quarters."
If – no, when. When. Draco was not about to let this go.
Draco let go of Harry’s hand and moved it up to turn Harry’s face firmly to his. “I have been an unbelievable prat and things are going to change – I promise.”
"There's no time for niceties, Malfoy." Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out a battered book. "I was reading last night and…"
"Four feet."
Hot on the heels of astonishment was anger. "You lied to me."
"My Draco.” Harry paused. "My Draco, by my count, fucked about 24 men in a month -  one or two were repeat visitors, and this in addition to still fucking me, the randy bastard."
"I wasn't planning on being anything but nice." Harry set down his camera on a rickety vanity and let the cat sniff his fingers, then rub against them, then allow him to pet him. Darcy looked surprised.
Draco rolled his eyes expressively. "Most people do. God only knows why; he's a snotty bastard, but some people find that charming. There's just no accounting for taste."
loved. The schoolboy crush had never faded, never gone stale or sour, never even flagged in its intensity.
Draco shook his head. "No, nothing, just talking to myself I guess."
"Harry.” Draco struggled to stay calm. "It wasn't you, I can tell you that. It was all about Draco."
Harry swallowed and tried to look cool. "So."
In the past.
"No, none." Draco set down his glass and looked Harry over. "You're mangy, Potter; you're unshowered, unshaven, sweaty, you reek of stale smoke and I can smell the scotch wafting out of your pores at a hundred paces. You're a fucking disgrace."
"I really wish you hadn't cut it all off," said Draco sadly. "I loved your hair."
Bill looked disdainful. "That wouldn't take much; I think all that hot sauce is growing hair on your chest."
"Right – the children of Death Eaters, the ones no older than we were, were given a choice. They could either stand trial, risk Azkaban, or they could agree to be "reassigned." Essentially, they were drained of their magic, Obliviated, and relocated to different parts of the world with no knowledge of each other, no memory of what had happened, of what their parts in events were, or of their families. It was the Ministry's attempt at a new start for those who might not have had any choice in their actions."
"Not that I know of; that usually doesn't happen till Tuesday." Harry smirked, and Draco, unwillingly and rather unexpectedly, smirked back. He reached out and touched his cheek, startling Harry.
"Not really. I lived without it for eleven years, used it for nine, and then put it away again. It's fine, really."
He started his stroll on the Monnikenstraat, walking slowly and surveying the wares; it was odd to see that the older whores were just as proud of their bodies as the younger ones, given the way they dressed and posed – even when the merchandise was clearly marked down due to wear and tear, and in some cases, an apparent fire sale. He was all in favor of flaunting it while you had it, though, so he waved to them and kept walking.
Paul nodded. "And you, Draco, are you on board with this? You look slightly less than enthused."
God, he was beautiful, and Harry couldn't remember the last time he had found someone beautiful. But Milo? He
"Theo will be, soon enough; then he'll come to you for a loan and you can have the fun of making him beg, the git. Now go."
like Draco."
Harry pushed himself off the wall. "I should get going – it was a good show, Malfoy. I am impressed, really; you've found your calling. Take care." He walked away quickly, not waiting for an answer, and at the corner, hailed another cab; his legs felt rubbery from the effort of being social and from pushing his attraction for the other man down and away. He was exhausted.
The book was out of place on the bookshelf - it was askew, and a corner of a yellowed piece of parchment was sticking out of one corner. Draco went to the shelf and tugged the book out, turning it over in his hands and looking at the cover.
She furrowed a brow. "Of course, and so should you, considering you testified at a bunch of them. Why?"
She rolled her eyes. "Yes. I'm here every night, all night. Are you interested or just looking for a chat-up? Because charming as you are, idle chit-chat isn't a luxury I can afford, off the clock. So…?"
At half five, a thump off to his left made him look up, only to see two blond heads emerge from a cloud of dust. "Honestly, Father, a port key? Out in a field? What's the matter with Apparating for God's sakes?"
"Dive?" Harry laughed. "I know the place, my mates and I have gone there a few times. It sounds great."
"Dark blonde with streaks; come on, make the best of it."
Draco surrendered completely to the kiss, and sank his hands into Harry's hair, using it to pull him even tighter against him, wanting to swallow him whole; he could feel Harry's cock pressing against his thigh, his fingers digging into his arse. His lips grew suddenly cold as Harry's moved off them but before he could protest, the lips were back, trailing along his jaw and moving down to his neck, latching onto the sweet spot, the deep indent between neck and collarbone and sucking; Draco moaned and it was a damn good thing that Harry had him nearly immobilized, else he would have slid down the wall, limp with pleasure.
Hermione was annoyingly logical for this time of night. Harry had been brooding for several hours now, and was also stone cold sober. The latter seemed to add insult to injury.
The day seemed interminable, and when five o'clock came and they still hadn't showed up, Harry moped off into the field just beyond the cluster of tents and climbed a tree to pout - and also to hide from Ginny, who seemed determined to snog him today. They had to be coming, right? Dumbledore wouldn't lie. Well, actually, he would, but generally not where funds were concerned. All the performers in the show answered to him, but he only answered to Minerva. Frankly, Dumbledore was less terrifying.
Harry was not an aerialist, but rather performed various odd jobs around the circus – he often acted as the straight man for clown jokes and had gotten hit in the face with more pies than Chaplin. He helped dress the dancing bears and once in a while, stuck the needles in the Man Who Felt No Pain. But by and large, he was most known for his unerring ability to hit a target when shot out of a cannon, hence the moniker, "Cannonball Harry, the Hardest-Headed Man in Britain."
"She deserves a raise." Draco started to rub his face, but remembered the eyeliner at the last minute.
He rubbed his face with his free hand. "I've looked bloody EVERYWHERE for him; where the hell is he? Where does he GO?"
Harry wondered briefly if this was a trick question. "Draco is gorgeous, Gin; what else should I have done?"
Never mind that Draco was the 'strange man' in this scenario. Where had his Harry gone?
Another long pause. "Uh, when are you coming back?"
The sarcasm had turned bitter. "At least then I could have said "How can we fix this? How can we make it better? I could have told him I loved him and I wanted it to work. Or I even could have said fine, fuck you, asshole, I'm out of here -  but no. He kept it secret till I found out one night, and then the fucker had the balls to tell me it meant nothing, it was a diversion!” Harry's voice had risen. "Breaking my fucking heart was a bloody
"His name, yeah." The young girl propped her door open wider and inspected her purple toenails. "He's pretty enough to be a girl, though – prettier than me, dammit. But when you hike up that chemise, the dick kind of gives it all away."
Ginny looked annoyed, but sniffed. "I don't smell anything."
"But Draco, when Harry sees you he'll know that you're Aaron. Is that what you want?"
"No." Harry was firm. "No, I just want every day you."
Harry scowled. "You know, just cause you're gorgeous doesn't mean you have to be a complete and utter ass."
"Tell me about it," grumbled the Bearded Lady as she walked by. "More than four times a week too, by my reckoning."
"Me too - I need you."
He wrested his attention back to the situation at hand and cleared his throat. "I plan to expose the perpetrator of these incidents, so if you will all direct your attention here," he indicated the bag. "We can begin."
"But I want him to be happy - I just want it to be with me." Harry's voice had grown small. "And he wasn't then, so why would he be now?"
“Is this a quiz? Should I have studied? Are there notes I could look over?”
"What the fuck, Potter?"
"I am. If Draco thinks, or ever thought he could find someone to replace you?" Aaron had shaken his head. "Then he would deserve to be fucking miserable for the rest of his life."
"It usually is, especially on Tuesdays for some reason. You'd think later in the week would be worse, but nope.”
Pansy smiled. "On a good night, yes he would be; and that might be exactly what he's looking for."
"I have been, I've been frantic, called everyone you know and we know and just, fuck. I've missed you." Draco came over and ran his hand over Harry's hair, threading his fingers through the long, thick locks before crushing his lips against Harry's.
Draco looked like he wanted to snap at him, but nodded instead. "Probably."
"I look like a rentboy - an expensive one, yes, but still, fuck, Pansy, I still need to go to work every day!"
He'd sit and stare at the lights on the river Seine, thinking until the thoughts drove him insane and he drank a bottle of wine so he could sleep. This went on for six days.
Last night, in that one, brief moment, he had known the secret Draco carried, just as Draco had known his. And if that moment hadn't been enough, he'd found Draco; found him as though he had known all along where the other man would be. Harry no longer used magic, but he could still sense it, still follow it, and knew that magic was comprised of many things, most of them unexplainable.
"Thank you. Now, the purpose of this little gathering is to get to the bottom of what's been going on, before we're all out of a job, a home, and attending a funeral."
Draco laughed aloud. "Can I come in?"
"Ugh. Yes. Glad to find someone who likes it; you can take the fucking bottle with you."
"Goodnight, then."
He stood up, clad now only in a thin pair of purple silk panties. "That was a nice start, hmm, Just Harry? What shall I do to you next?"
"That'd be a plus - would Saturday around 6 PM be all right?"
"Luck – pure, unadulterated luck, is all. And the flounder is not fictional. I saw him with my own eyes." Harry scratched in places only men felt comfortable touching in public. "Ask Simons, he was there."
A few feet away, a match struck brick and a brief flare of light illuminated the face of his unexpected companion.
"Slut?" supplied Ginny helpfully and her mother shushed her. "But yes, Charlie, a slut."
The stylist was waiting expectantly and Harry mentally shook himself, instead thinking of how completely pissed off Draco would be to see him now. Good.
"Okay," said Harry, pushing up his glasses on his nose. "This is what we've learned." He handed the paper he'd been scribbling on all day to Draco, and watched as he read.
Harry managed to stand, his head spinning in a most unpleasant manner. He had long since moved past hangovers – or so he thought – but this feeling promised a real winner of one.
At all; his body felt frozen in place, and frissons of tension were starting to explode along his spine.
"Yes."
“How did you know where to find me?”
It was a dismissal, and pleasantly high though he was, it still stung, and he moved several steps back, standing there for a long moment until he turned and walked away.
Draco swallowed. "Is he the boyfriend?"
He squeezed her hand again and let go. "Okay. You're right, and I'm overreacting, as usual. Thanks for being the voice of reason."
Harry's brow immediately furrowed – Ministry "experiments" had abounded after the War, some with disastrous results. In public, and at state events, Shacklebolt was fond of saying that you never heard about all the good results, only the bad. Harry had always been quick to point out that it was because, as the saying went, "When she was good, she was very, very good, and when she was bad she was horrid."
"That is not true! I care, I cared! You didn't! You didn't say, “Hey, Harry, you fucking bore me senseless in bed, so I'm gonna call out for sex.”  You let me find out the good old-fashioned manner of everyone who's ever wanted to be caught!"
"And you're sure because..."
Late one evening, almost a month ago, Selwyn had caught up with Malfoy on his way home from St Mungo’s, where Draco had nearly finished his healer training. Draco had stumbled into the flat he shared with Harry much much later than he’d been expected, tight-lipped, bruised and bloody. Worst of all, he had a hunted look in his eye that Harry had noticed stuck around for most of a week, and still now would reappear if Harry startled him or was in any way rough.
The real trouble had started after they had ordered the curries. Leaving Harry on his couch, Draco had just gone into the kitchen to collect some drinks - even Harry-fucking-Potter couldn't prevent him playing the scrupulously hospitable host - plates, and cutlery when his chest had felt a sharp pain. Or more like the echo of a sharp pain. It had startled him, and he'd gasped, which of course had had Harry running into the kitchen, nearly bowling over Draco in the process. The pain faded quickly, but Draco allowed Harry to continue rubbing his back for a moment longer than necessary, because his huge hands were warm, and because Draco hadn't been with anyone since Pansy practically forced him into a snog at a Slytherin party in fifth year, and it felt nice for fucks sake.
“Harry?” Draco was standing next to the bed, face ashen.
grew this baby, and
“Oh sweetheart,” Harry spread a broad dark hand over Draco’s slender pale ones where they were resting on his belly, and wrapped his other arm round Draco’s shoulders. “It’s not too early. All the healers said you looked further along than your due date, that’s why we painted the nursery weeks ago. You’re ready for this. We’re ready for this. Plus the healers know they need to be careful, no one is going to make any mistakes this time.
The rocking slowed, and Potter leaned forward over Draco. With a muttered incantation Draco spelled away the sticky come from the sheets under him and lowered himself into the pillows.
"Then I expect we'll need to visit Granger at St Mungo's."
- Troye Sivan,
They’d cleared all the extra staff from the room including the gruff healer who seemed to have been in charge, and there was just one healer left, who appeared to be weighing blankets in the corner. Draco was propped up on the bed, pale except for a residue of flush, and was smoothing his hair back, grinning.
"I - No, I hadn't noticed. How did you notice?"
Afterwards, Harry lay curled around Draco, one arm draped over his beautiful fecundity, and felt slightly affronted. “You really didn’t come?”
"Have you done this before?" Harry asked, tone light and conversational, as though he wasn't asking his arch-nemesis if he'd ever been fucked by the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
He could blame the Ministry all he liked. They certainly weren't going to fix this.
"It was twenty minutes, love, at most. I will never leave you." Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's ear, as he gathered himself to his full height. It required a bit of effort these days, for Draco to walk. Harry watched as his slim and lithe boyfriend, normally so sophisticated, waddled - yes,
“Er - yes, top drawer.”
As predicted, it didn't last long. Potter's cock brushed Draco's prostate and he tightened with the thrill of it. That tipped Potter over the edge and he picked up the pace, driving into Draco with great smooth thrusts. Draco came first, but within seconds (come still pulsing from Draco's cock) he felt Potter shudder and groan.
Hermione paused, peering at Draco with some kind of worried look that bordered on pity.
"Mmm." And finally, Potter was easing into him. Potter was not his first, but still, after several months of this, he found Potter's cock particularly difficult. It was big, for one thing. Not quite as big as Blaise's, but an easy second largest Draco had ever experienced. It was somehow hotter too. Potter's cock seemed to double as a heating iron, he figured Pansy could use it to curl her hair if she ever changed her mind about being a lesbian. Draco figured the excess heat in both his cock and the rest of Potter's body was tied to his over-powered magic. Every movement of Potter inside him sent shivers up Draco's spine, and sent tingles through his own penis.
he thought before stepping into the flames.
other showers in here you could have used. Get out!" Draco felt his mouth drop open.
Potter leaned in and started pressing kisses up Draco's neck. Which was exposed, because Draco had rolled his head back to get away from the damp smell of Potter's hair,
. "I mean, you can. But you can also... not."
But he was in love, with Draco, and finding out Draco was androgynous was honestly quite exciting to Harry. Harry had released a while back that he liked men as well as women, and he'd realised long before Draco came along that he also liked men and women who chose not to conform to gender stereotypes. He was massively into long-haired men, and buzz cuts on women. He loved a men's shirt paired with breasts and short skirts on hairy thighs. He loved the contrast of masculine with feminine and he loved confidence. So it figured that Draco with his sharp yet delicate features and his contradictory elegance and androgyny and his sheer, unrelenting arrogance would be just Harry's type.
"Better?" Harry was still smirking at him.
Draco sighed. "What, Potter?"
In the lounge, he straightened his robes enough to cover the essentials and threw a handful of Floo Powder into the grate.
Swallowing the last of his whisky, Draco placed the glass back on the bar.
Draco felt heat prickle on his cheeks.
“Oh, I’m not - "
"Mmm."
And I could already feel your kiss
Draco closed his eyes. He couldn't look at Harry-fucking-Potter right now. Not after what was possibly the best orgasm he'd ever had. Not after Harry-fucking-Potter had just given him the best fucking orgasm of his entire fucking life.
"I love you."
Harry leaned in, closing the space between their chests and pressing his hips into Draco's. Draco found himself pressed right up against the kitchen counter behind him, Harry's hands still pulling at his hips. Draco's heart thundered and he inhaled sharply as he felt Harry's hardness through his trousers. His own cock was half hard already, and it throbbed enthusiastically at the contact.
“What are you doing?” Draco hissed, though not crossly. “I’m huge!”
Merlin. He hadn't fantasised about Harry this hard since Hogwarts. Not that he'd fantasised much. Just after Quidditch games. And after they'd argued. And if they'd come to close to touching in a corridor or classroom.
One of Potter's broad, calloused hands retreated from where it had been groping Draco's bum and took hold of Draco's rock-hard, already-leaking cock. The hand gave a firm tug, and Draco moaned into Potter's mouth. Potter was obviously responding to some primal instincts because this threw him into more of a frenzy, and his own cock joined Draco's in the tight grip of Potter's hand.
Another whimper escaped directly into Potter's hot, ravenous mouth as his tongue forced its way into Draco's. Potter's broad, strong hands travelled down Draco's back, as if to pull him closer, as if Draco hadn't pressed every fibre of his being into Harry-Fucking-Potter the moment their lips met.
Draco nodded, and pushed forward into Harry's chest, knocking a bit of the breath out of him.
"Well, Pansy and I came up with a couple of looks that would be amazing on you, so if you want to pick one?”
Finally, as the room grew overwhelmingly crowded, Draco rose and grabbed the bottle of vodka in front of him, making his way through the crowd and out the door, down the hall and out a little-used back door.
"That would be lovely," Kingsley managed.
"Yeah, that's Ginny." Harry scrubbed some frosting off his nose. "Have you had breakfast yet?"
Harry had dragged Draco to the center ring and still had his hand firmly on his arm. "Mr. Malfoy, I know you're upset and rightly so, but this has nothing to do with the circus. This is personal and engineered by one person, and I'm about to expose them."
act tonight, but whatever. He watched with barely contained amusement as his father and Harry appeared, dying a little at his father's face when he discovered the switch. He'd never known Lucius could turn that shade of red – it was actually rather becoming.
"I am someone else now, Pansy." He'd settled for water, desperate to do something with his hands, since his secretary had banned him from smoking in the office. Maggie rarely got fierce, but when she did, even Draco caved. "I'm not who I was."
They chatted – well, yelled softly – for a bit, then danced some more. Harry was approached by at least three other men, but smiled his no to all three, turning back to Draco. In turn, Draco brushed off two men, not having any interest at all in anyone save Harry.
He sighed and Arthur looked at him sympathetically. "Never mind his language Molly; Harry, if you would?"
"Maybe you could pencil me in for 11," replied Harry, stretching. "You know, in your super-planner. And I'll be up in a bit; I want to check email one last time."
"Honestly, Gin," Harry said rather softly, his voice carrying, nonetheless. "That was careless. Other women in this group might wear high heels, but not on a regular basis. And not when committing arson on a damp night; you could have gotten stuck in the mud, fallen and broken your ankle. Not smart."
It was only Blaise's hand on his shoulder, his fingers digging into Draco's skin that kept him from jumping up and doing fuck knew what to the man waxing rhapsodic about Harry - HIS Harry. Pansy looked down at him. "What was his name?"
But all in all, it was a pleasant walk, and he enjoyed the scenery, human and otherwise.
Before Harry could answer, however, Charlie broke in. "How could he not? Malfoy is choice. Those lips, those eyes that arse, that flowing hair…" He trailed off and sighed happily. Harry looked at him askance. "Are we looking at the same Malfoy?"
“What the hell kind of day do you think I’ve had?” Harry had looked incredulous and angry as well.
"Use more of that rouge stuff and quit the complainin,'" muttered Filch, stalking away. Harry had to admit that Filch had a point…quite the accomplishment, for him.
Harry arose at half four, after a genuinely lovely nap. He freshened up, changed his shirt, realized his underwear was still disreputable, and solved the issue neatly by going commando – with any luck, he wouldn't be wearing pants soon anyway.
& & &
Shit. Where would Harry have gone?
She nodded. "Yes, if that's your thing."
The next day was another performance day and that morning, the tent was bustling; the Fossors were checking the larger dimensions against their choreography, the non-dangerous animals were busy sniffing their way around the perimeter, and high above, the younger Weasleys were testing the new ropes and wires. Far above, on the new catwalk, Ron and Ginny were apparently conducting some sort of scientific experiment by dropping various objects from the walk to the ground. Harry looked at them and shook his head. Whatever made one happy. He dodged a cabbage and winced as it splattered, but Bobo was overjoyed and had himself a fine feast. He watched Draco enter the new tent and look around; he hadn't spoken to the other boy since the fire and his cheeks still burned as he remembered Draco shaking him off. He decided to wait for Draco to come to him, if he was going to.
Lucius looked mildly amused. "Well of course you are. Who wouldn't be?"
He lay on the sofa where he had fallen right after he threw his mobile across the room where it hit the fireplace and shattered. He lay there, not even knowing he wept until the tears soaked the pillows when he turned his head; he let them dry into salty, tight tracks on his face. Only the risk of soiling himself and the sofa finally made him move to use the loo; as he passed the window he saw that the sun had set and the streetlights were casting long shadows on the pavement outside their flat.
"It's crowded as hell in here." Hello Captain Obvious, thought Draco with disgust. But Harry smiled.
Against his better judgment, Harry stood and walked over to the table where he and Draco generally dumped their pockets when they came in the door. Draco's mobile lay on top of his wallet. Harry picked it up and looked at it, lying in his palm.
Kingsley bit his lip so as to not laugh - it was better to not encourage Potter these days. "Have you partnered with many pixies in such a state?"
"I would never try to force you, Harry." Kingsley was far too calm, given the game. "But you do have a lot of time accumulated, so I see no reason why a young, healthy …"
"Good boy. Come round in the mornin', a'right?"
& & &
For the first time in many months, Harry had not only showered, but shaved and attempted to make his hair do something other than stand on end. He was wearing clean clothes, even, and God help him, cologne.
& & &
Harry took a deep drag off his cigarette. "It's nice to see you too."
"Yeah, that would be great. I'll be right out, okay?"
like this. Or hadn't since school, anyway.
Harry shook his head. "No, and I hate that."
Paul laughed. "That's descriptive. Yeah, this guy told me he used to be pants at dancing, but he'd been coming out for about a month and finally just gave in and went with the beat - good call on his part. And the other thing that was incredibly sexy? He has this tattoo of a dragon on his back; I saw it the night the air conditioner broke at Goo Lagoon, and everyone was stripping. It was a huge dragon that curled around his spine and had some writing circling on it in gold, very cool."
"Oi," said Draco, resting his forehead on the table. "Pans, Blaise - you don't really think he might…?" He trailed off, not even wanting to say the words.
Harry turned even redder; goddamn Charlie anyway – he was going to kick his arse the next time he saw him
But now, In the half-light, the rows of stones looked like sleeping soldiers, moments away from awakening, crouched forms ready for battle. He shivered.
They both stood up and moved out onto the floor, finding a clear space and beginning to move; Draco tried hard not to dance the way he normally did, but that proved impossible. He loved dancing, was good at it, enjoyed the freedom of moving without thought, without plan. Harry though, he noted, was even better up close than from an aerial view; when the hell had he learned to move like that? He decided that if he and Harry managed to work things out, he was going to make him come out dancing at least two or three times a month.
Harry. Draco closed his eyes and fought the urge to turn and throw himself on the other man and pin him to the bar; he counted to five and then opened his eyes and made himself turn very casually towards the man beside him. No leather pants or mesh shirt this time, but faded, ripped jeans, so tight as to be nearly obscene and a black fitted t-shirt that clung to every ripple and muscle. Jesus, had he been working out?
Harry snorted a bit. "He's probably not sure how to talk to you about it, and frankly, it probably hurts him too much to even broach the subject."
"Got that already," Harry nodded. "I don't know if my winkie could handle six weeks of that kind of abuse though. Plan B?"
The next night, the show was sold out; not only was the show still getting rave reviews, but a certain segment of the population was in it for the potential morbidity of the situation - the general opinion seemed to be that something would happen, since the culprit had not yet been caught … the only question seemed to be what, exactly, it would be.
Ginny's face was scarlet and he wondered momentarily if she was just pissed off or choking and pissed off. Fortunately (or unfortunately), it turned out to be the former. "Harry! You should not be lusting after men! You should be lusting after girls, specifically me! Why do you think I wear these revealing outfits and makeup? For fun?"
The lady looked him up and down. "Nr, maar ik kon een partij in uw broek beginnen, baby," she purred. Harry wasn't sure what that meant, and out of curiosity promptly whipped out his wand to cast a translation spell and caught the clerk frantically waving at him. Right. He casually scratched his neck with his wand and stuck it back into his pocket.
"It was brutal." Harry's tone was flat. "I've never been much of a liar, but I rose to the occasion that one time – and I won't ever forget his face when I said it. Draco's not - he's not an open person. He makes getting to know him work. It took me two years to crack that shell of his, I thought I knew him, thought he knew me, but for the whole last month we were together, he was ordering up sex like takeaway because I wasn't enough anymore, apparently."
If not for him, then for whom?
Draco stared at the phone in his hand – he wanted to cry, but his tear ducts were empty, his eyes dry and head pounding.
But no.
Harry watched, completely entranced, and tried not to think about how, erm, limber Draco was and how beautiful he looked as he bent and swayed. This was something no mere picture could convey…not even a wizarding one. This was…well, magic. And he was resolutely NOT thinking about how flexible Draco must be in other ways. He wasn't. At all.
"For Ginny, it's a fate worse than death. It's even a Muggle fat camp. No conjuring chocolate, no transfiguring pudding." Harry was still chuckling and Draco shook his head then turned to cup Harry's face in his hands and kissed him soundly.
Her eyebrows shot up. "You're sure?"
Blaise, meanwhile, was advising Draco to go and check them out, drag Potter home and then make him see reason with his cock, and if all else failed, toys. Big toys. Big, lifelike toys.
“Oh, sorry dear," she said absently, darning a sock of her husbands. "But is it better?"
"That does sound rather nice – if you're sure you can handle things around here without me." He watched his boss' face turn a lovely shade of eggplant - really, a fascinating color -  then got up and shook his hand warmly. "I'll send you a postcard from wherever I wind up, yes?"
Harry kissed him back briefly, then let his lips still as Draco kissed him. After a moment, Draco pulled back, puzzled. "Hey, kiss me back?"
Leaving the coffee lounge, he was very, very relaxed and thought he just might like to stay around here for a good long while. And since he was now in a frame of mind to, perhaps, engage in some interpersonal communication, he thought he might take a stroll back through the District and see if anyone caught his eye. Or if
"I think a decaffeinated Adams can handle them. Truly Harry, go – go someplace exotic, someplace remote, some place where trouble doesn't come knocking every ten minutes. Someplace you can relax."
"Not that much, surely," said Harry, zipping up. "All the men you fancied had much shorter hair than mine was." He moved out to the hall. "Night." And he was gone - again.
"No, we
Draco raised his glass, thankfully only saw water spots on the rim, and drank. It was good stuff, Courvoisier, and must have been a gift. When people were reduced to just giving you booze on special occasions, it meant no one knew you well enough anymore to give much thought to your interests. Or maybe it meant that your friends did know your interests, and therefore gave you booze -  he suspected Potter's situation was the latter.
Draco had been taken aback by Harry’s tone and had tried to make a joke. “The fucking you part sounds good…assuming that the “you” means “me” and means that you will soon be fuc…”
Around him, their road crew, girls from the audience, and other hangers-on were flooding the room, and Draco mechanically accepted congratulations, pats on whatever part of his body people could reach, and many kisses on the cheek. He thanked them all in a monotone, but no one seemed to notice.
Before Draco could spit out a snappy rejoinder, Pansy broke in. "Well, love, our Draco is a choice piece, I know, but you see, his boyfriend has essentially left him and just…" she waved her hand, "…started going out without him. So, Draco wants to find him. But the boyfriend - let's call him Harry…"
"No problem." His throat felt dry as dust and he sipped his vodka to moisten it. Harry didn't move away, just turned his back to the bar as well, surveying the crowd.
Pansy ignored him. "Harry has started going out without Draco, which upsets our boy here. He wants to find him. But Harry will no doubt either ignore him or leave if he should attempt to, mmm, connect with him. So, we thought that if Draco could look much, much different, then maybe he could chat Harry up and things might progress, you see?”
"We're so sorry!"
"Draco was never the man you 'ought he was."
That morning, Harry slammed the door behind him and hurried after the figure walking away.
He was finally broken out of his trance when he realized how late he was. He hurried down to the great hall as to not miss breakfast and slid into the last remaining seat, besides Malfoy. Makes sense that not many sat by Malfoy. He wasn't quite a crowd favorite.
"Harry!" Hermione wrapped her arms around him.
"I'm very surprising, aren't I?"
"Where have you been?" Harry finally blurted.
"Merlin, Ron! I'm practically stark bollock naked!" He gestured to the single towel hanging around his waist.
"Left door?"
"Well, Potter, that was surprisingly pleasant, but I have to get ready for my class."
"Hermione! No!" Ron chided.
"Rainy Winesap. Slytherin!" Clapping.
"What can I do for you, Lola?"
Harry had taken up the habit of sitting by Malfoy at breakfast. He's not sure why, the only thing that happened was insults being thrown back and forth.
"Rainy is not one to act on impulse. I think there is a good chance it's nothing, but a great chance it's something."
That night, Harry stared at the moon. Unable to sleep.  He could hear the clock ticking. Suddenly, he began to hear small sounds a destress. Then they got louder. Moans, groans, and whines. They sounded as if they were coming from Malfoy's room. Was that arse jerking off? It kept going and Harry listened for what felt like forever. Then the sobbing came. Okay, Malfoy was definitely having a nightmare and Harry couldn't sleep until he got over it, so Harry would go wake him up. He got up and pulled pajama pants over the boxers he was sleeping in and headed out to the hall. He stood there, staring at the door for quite sometime. Finding the courage or something. But Harry just about busted the door down when a scream came from inside. He found Malfoy tangled in sweaty sheets with tear rolling down his face.
"Great. Night, Potter." Malfoy said with a curt smile. And then he was gone.
"Of course." He smiled as she handed him the paper. He began to read through it. "I like the way you organized your fact to opinion ratio."
"Fine." Harry went to his cabinet when he heard Malfoy hiss in pain.
"Oh, you know, it's going good! What about you? Ready for the year?"
"Sod off, you're the show off. We both know it." Harry winked. Why did he wink?! That's so awkward.
"You did not!" Harry laughed.
"....okay." Harry poured the potion into the only two glasses he owned.
"Spanish. Because of my mum."
The two professors set off into the rain and down to the grounds in determined silence.
"Harry! So good to see you!" Neville said, sliding into the chair next to him. He had taken on Professor Sprout's job after she retired.
"Really, really!" Harry leaped over to give him a bear hug and they danced around his living room whooping and hollering.
"I know it is quite nice. It was mine."
"No, like since the war." Harry cut him off. "It's been five years and I haven't see you in the papers since, well, the trials."
"Perhaps I shall have to report you to Mcgonagall for harsh language. You're a professor, Potter." Malfoy drawled. Harry scowled at him and Malfoy's lips twisted up into a smile. Malfoy flopped, elegantly, down onto a cushy chair by the window. Harry and his collected books sat at the nearby table, facing the cushy chair. They sat there working on their separate duties. Working studiously in parallel universes. Or at least Malfoy was probably working studiously, Harry was thinking a mile a minute.
"None of your business, but if you must know, I get cold."
"Do it!" A boy bellowed. They all began to cheer and chant. Harry grinned and plucked off his glasses. And did a headstand. They all cheered, he grinned harder. At least he made a somewhat good first impression.
"Hello, Harry." She surveyed him with a suspicious eye and a sly smile. "Did you have a good night?"
"Potter?" Malfoy practically moaned his name in a scratchy voice, looking up at him with teary eyes. "Kindly get the fuck out of my room."
"I dunno. Everything."
"At least your hair isn't what?" Malfoy's drawl cut through his thoughts.
His first day back. Back at the place where he grew up. Back at the place that traumatized him so deeply. Back with the memories floating in the air. But this time, he was teaching.
"Anytime."
"What type of noises?" Mcgonagall said as she appeared beside them. "Harry, take Draco to Madame Pomfrey, please." Harry nodded and extended a hand to Malloy. He obviously didn't take it and got up on his own.
"Sorry I'm coming without notice."
"Mione! I've missed you. And that future babe of yours." He patted her stomach and felt quite like a cliche adult. Ron laughed and they all sat down. Conversation broke out suddenly and easily, like they were back in the common room. Everything that could come into their minds they talked about. That wasn't quite true, He left Malfoy out of the conversation. Ron and Harry had downed a few fire whiskeys and Hermione chugged some juice and everything felt so perfect.
"So he's... changed?"
"Damn, Malfoy. And I thought I was oblivious." Malfoy crinkled his brow in obvious confusion. Now it was Harry's turn to smirk.
"You can, er, have it back."
"Why did you wake up?" Harry groaned.
"You talk to Malfoy? Yeah?"
"Thank you, I will! Oh, and one more thing. I need your advice"
"Could you look over my essay real quick?"
"Problem?" Malfoy growled. That man could turn nasty fast.
"Mate, I'm so bloody happy for you two. Give 'Mione my love."
"Draco, Harry!" Mcgonagall beckoned them over. Great. "As the two new teachers, you have not yet chosen your rooms. Any preferences?"
"I did."
"Rainy and Lola went into the Forbidden Forest!"
"Exactly! Loads of pride."
give me some ideas or scenarios that i can add to go along with the main plot <333
"You would need another teacher to do it with though, I was thinking it would help with house integrating if it was not a Gryffindor. I was think Professor Malfoy. But I need to know that you two will not be a problem. Can you promise me that?" A groan sounded from the corner of his room. McGonagall raised an eyebrow. Guess who decided to wake up and walk over to the door? Malfoy, of course. "I'm beginning to think it will not be a problem in the slightest." She said.
"I don't want to be in the dungeon." Malfoy piped in.
"Of course not! Just surprised."
"You've always been a horrid liar." Hagrid laughed.
"Why not do a good potion and a good essay?"
"Harry! Harry! Great news! Big news!"
"Ian Zeller. Ravenclaw!" Clapping. Finally, now Harry could eat. He had forgotten how delicious the hogwarts food was. Truly to die for. Malfoy barely touched his. Must have already eaten, the idiot. By the end of the feast, the air was warm and bubbly. It would be a task to get the bouncy students to bed. But that was the prefect's problem. Harry needed a bed to pass out on. A comfy couch would do. Even the floor.
"We're adults." So with that, Harry crawled in next to Malfoy.
"You're okay, you're okay."
"What do you need?" Harry said with a grin.
"I forgave you a long time ago." Malfoy said with a tight smile. Harry smiled back, awkwardly. They walked down to breakfast and ate in silence.
"She's that Slytherin who was about 3 years younger than us." Hermione provided.
"Pipe down. Do you want a hangover potion?"
"Is that who I think it is?" Ron grumbled. Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson had just walked in. Shit.
An uneventful week of lessons passed by quickly. He spent more time with Neville. Walks beside the lake and never ending classes. He kept his eye on Malfoy. So he wouldn't get into any trouble, of course. Harry was trying to find peace in the mundane and within himself. He had been banished to Hogwarts to heal and he was failing at even that. It's not like he was getting worse, if anything he has had a pretty good few weeks, but bad days happen. That's life. Right? Everyone struggles. He just struggles a tad more than most.
"Sounded like you had an interesting morning." Malfoy glanced at him over his goblet of pumpkin juice.
"Merlin, Potter, I didn't think your hair could get any messier, but I guess you have once again proven me wrong."
"Alright there?"
"Hiya." He grimaced as he opened the door. Not all the way. Not to where you could see the blonde hair in his bed.
"Get into the bed, you lunatic."
Mcgonagall had not said anything about Malfoy and him. It had only been a few days but still. Harry didn't know what he was expecting, though. He had finished up grading a stack of papers as the sun sunk down below the outline of the Forbidden forest. Suddenly, heard a pounding on the door next to his. And then a pounding on his door. Harry threw on his coat and flung open the door. Malfoy was already there, accompanied by a soaking wet Ian and Jasper.
"See you at breakfast, Potter." Malfoy smiled.
The morning sun shone through his window as he got out of the shower when suddenly a crack sounded and a redhead was in his living room. Ron, actually.
"What? That would make sense!"
"I have a new one."
"When did you become friends with my friends without my knowledge?"
"Don't be sorry! Yer always welcome!" Hargrid poured him a cuppa and got out his box of biscuits. "What's on yer mind?"
"With her parents. We'll come see you Hogsmeade weekend, but for now Mcgonagall made an exception." He grinned.
"I'll start!" A girl with raven black pig tails cried out.
"Sleep in mine."
"I was in muggle France."
"Lumos." Malfoy whispered as they got engulfed in the dark. They approached the woods without hesitation. Harry led the way as they began the search. They slowly creeped between trees, listening and watching. The half moon shone through the dark clouds, giving them light, and the forest was a symphony of sounds. Insects chirping and leaves rustling, he prayed he would be able to hear the girls.
"I can and I will. I would like to sleep in a bed tonight."
"Well, this morning I ate breakfast in the great hall, then I had a few classes, then I went to have tea with Hagrid-." Malfoy mused.
Draco nodded. "Yes."
A passing beer vendor caught his eye, and he bought two, figuring that would keep him for the next half hour, until the guy came through again. Beer was like water to him, and he regretted not bringing his flask – or hell, given this crowd, he could have poured scotch into a Snapple bottle and called it iced tea. Fuck of a time to think of that now, Potter.
"I just wander around, usually," Harry replied, fighting back images of Draco in spandex. "I like to check in on people, see what's new, hear the gossip, see what's new with the animals. I keep busy."
Draco really, really hated his conscience; he'd grown one only with extreme reluctance, and only because Harry had made him. Now all it did was fuck with his head and make him question his own actions - constantly.
"No, it wasn't." He felt suddenly weary. "Whatever else you think was meant to be, it wasn't us." He looked over at Dumbledore. "That's all I have, sir."
"Twenty-seven months," answered Kingsley dryly. "But I think a month, six weeks, might be good for a start."
," he continued. "I was reading my trusty investigative guide, and this all is too coincidental. We need to find who's doing this, and why."
"How'd you get her to agree to this?"
Word had spread about the Malfoys, and the tent that night was packed to the brim with people; Minerva was in seventh heaven at the ticket booth, and even Hagrid laid off his usual grumblings about putting his "poor creatures" through their paces.
"Same here.” Harry looked at him again. "I'm sorry to stare, but you remind me of someone. I'm not sure what it is about you, but you do."
He nodded. "Always."
Draco stopped in his tracks and looked Harry over. "Do you always wear your food?"
"Potter.” Draco caught his arm before he could leave. "You're staying, right? Here?"
Harry too was finding this all a little hard to take. He had seen the imprint and was pretty sure he knew who's it was, but he still didn't want to believe it. He tried to put it all out of his mind and was mostly successful. Mostly.
He'd pull on some boxers – it was a challenge to find clean ones, and he was often reduced to turning already-worn ones inside out – and sit back down on the edge of his bed, lighting a cigarette and staring and smoking for the next five to ten minutes. Some people pulled out a prayer mat and faced Mecca, some folded their bodies into origami in the name of enlightenment, and some chanted while incense burned. Harry Potter sat on his unmade bed in tatty boxers and smoked Marlboros. It worked for him.
The edge of the spot was curling up, and he carefully tried to peel the spot away; a small bit came up, and it had small specks of something familiar and white in it. Harry held it up, then carefully wrapped it in his handkerchief. It went under his bed with the dirt clod and he was left with much to think of as he extinguished the light in his tent that evening - but not before reviewing some very important reading material.
And when Milo was in front of him, and looked down into Harry's eyes, Harry felt a shock like a hex – or more likely a curse – shoot through him.
In Harry's drunken mental meanderings over the years, he had even wondered what had happened to Draco – if he was now the entitled, spoiled, petulant Lord of Malfoy Manor, instead of the entitled, spoiled, petulant heir to said Mansion. He'd not bothered to keep up with wizarding society once he'd bailed out of Auror training for a life of sloth and vice, so unless Hermione fed him some juicy news on her increasingly infrequent visits, he was out of the loop. And he liked it that way. It kept him out of trouble, and kept him from thinking too hard about things that shouldn't be thought of at all.
Harry shrugged, forgetting Draco couldn't see him. "Clubs are always the same."
Draco stared at the spot where the tent had been and had to bite back tears; Malfoys never cried. Harry had caught his breath when he saw the ruins and hesitantly placed a hand on Draco's shoulder, which was rudely shaken off. "I don't like to be touched."
Entrancing. Jesus, when was the last time he'd used that word? Exactly never, was when. But it seemed the only word he could find in the morass of his mind to describe this sound.
Draco looked down at the book. "Surly O'Sullivan's Guide to Nailing the Perp?" he read, and snickered. "Sounds like porn."
"No, Draco, where do you start? I can't go with you; it would be a dead giveaway. And I like how I look, thanks, and plan on changing nothing. You need to go alone."
Draco's lip turned up at the edge. "Good." He looked around. "So what do you do on days when there are no performances?"
"Ah. Sounds fascinating."
"Ah, anyone good or a mortal enemy?"
He finished his bottle of rum, and crawled into bed, sleeping until the streetlights outside his un-shuttered windows woke him. He sat up, ran a hand through his hair and tried to figure out what exactly he needed. It took him a moment or two, but then he knew.
He thought about the rest of his life with no Draco in it - and only then did he finally break down and cry himself to sleep.
This afternoon he decided that nine viewings of the Fawlty Towers episode where all the guests were shagging each other (and Manuel, to boot) was enough, and flipped to a heavy metal station, coming into the middle of a song he'd never heard before. He listened, entranced, to a voice that was partly a sober Ville Valo crossed with Chris Isaak on acid, and tossed with a bit of Keith Richards. Whether Richards was sober or not in this mix was debatable, but the fact remained that while the song was rather unremarkable, the voice was, well, entrancing.
Draco nodded back and made his way back to the loo, shutting himself in a stall and trying to control himself.
"I can get it up just fine, thank you. Is that all?"
"Some things, there's just no help for," Harry agreed, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
It was Draco, and he was standing right in front of him. "Thank you," he said softly, and before Harry could answer, he was being kissed, warmly and firmly, and arms were around him, hands sinking into his hair. He responded fully, kissing Draco back…and it was just like he'd always dreamed it would be.
Everyone was now staring openmouthed at Ginny, sweet little Ginny Weasley; she squirmed inside her gray sweatshirt with "The Winged Weasleys" on it.
Girls and boys alike sighed over the oldest boy, Bill, whose actions were often reckless and impulsive; Charlie, the second oldest, whose costumes were a tad revealing; and the twins, Fred and George, whose feats in the air were nothing short of extraordinary. They often assisted Ringmaster Dumbledore in the main ring as well, and their constant patter was a source of much amusement to the crowd, as were the illusions they seemed able to pull out of thin air. Ron, the second youngest was the anchor of the group, his extreme strength holding many of the most difficult feats together. The youngest, Ginny, was the flirt of the group, and owls had finally been banned from the Big Top, when one too many met its end in a mid-air collision with one or the other of the Weasleys as it attempted to deliver her a message of undying love.
"What are you doing tonight?" He asked idly, checking his pockets for stray scraps of paper, change and the like.
Owned and operated by Albus Dumbledore, a renowned wizard in his own right, the circus was a draw to all, big and small, old and young; as the saying went, there was a little something for everyone.
More rapping. "Jesus, all right! Give me a moment."
She slid her spectacles back on. "Harry dear, are you all right? You're quite flushed."
"Yeah, should…ya gonna be a'right here, 'Arry? You've your wand with you?"
"I was scared," he said flatly. There was no way to make it any more or less than what it was.
"I don't know, Draco love, but if you've looked everywhere else?" Pansy shrugged. She was glad that she was so marvelously adept at keeping a straight face, because honestly, the thought of Potter, all dressed up and looking even hotter than usual, in a gay bar? Well, it made her feel all sorts of squirmy and damp in places her husband couldn’t even buy his way into anymore. She casually smoothed a perfect eyebrow as Draco lit his umpteenth cigarette of the afternoon.
"Uhm yeah, I guess he goes to Skin City sometimes too, but if it makes you feel any better, Draco? He doesn't stay with any one person. If they ask for his number, he just smiles and says no, and if they push it, he walks away. Drives people crazy; he's got this huge mystique - this incredibly hot guy who seems so far away."
He stopped as the man at the window turned and took a few steps toward him. "I live here - I kind of have access." Draco bit his lip and looked Harry in the eye. "Hello Harry."
>Dumbledore watched approvingly, having had a talk with Filch about the need for accurate counting down when firing boys out of cannons. So it was with great confidence that he introduced Harry, and as he waved his wand grandly as he got to three, the cannon went off, and Harry went hurtling through the air.

He surveyed the crowd, then reached into the bag, pulling out what looked like – and was – a clump of dried mud. "The first incident was the intentional torching of the Malfoy living tent, which resulted in the mostly unintentional destruction of the main performance tent as well." Harry paused, letting the phrase "mostly unintentional" sink in. "Now, since magical means were used to create the fire, normally there would be very little, if any, evidence present unless one could somehow trace the wand's magical signature. This manner of identification is only truly viable if one can be at the scene within five minutes of the spell being cast, and of course, due to the pandemonium, no one was able to discern the initial site of the fire till later."
He barely made it to his flat, stumbling in and slamming the door till it bounced open on its own.
Paul was nodding. "I can see both sides, myself. You ideally want to be open and honest, but occasionally, you must go another route. And this isn't exactly dishonest - you could change your look for any number of reasons."
Draco was having a hard time breathing, and Pansy sat down beside him. "Breathe, darling, in and out, in and out.”
Potter had come to see him. Never mind that he thought Draco was Milo – names were nothing. They were a place-holder, that was all. He had obviously spent time staring at Milo's face, memorizing it, dreaming of it. He had seen the familiar look on Potter's face moments before he recognized him – it was the look of wanting someone. Potter had wanted him, and when Draco had seen the eyes that haunted him still, whether asleep or awake, his own desire for Potter had been unmistakable, too. That's why Potter had been out there, Draco knew. The exit wasn't well known; it wasn't the stage door they'd normally leave by, and unless Potter spent time at Underworld often, he wouldn't even know about that alley. Somehow, some way, Potter had known to go there, known how to find him.
"I said," he called, more loudly this time, "to settle down!"
Harry sighed "Maybe a little of both? We all deserve a second chance, I guess, and although this isn't a life I think he would have chosen, he seems content enough." Harry rubbed the back of his neck. "I took pictures," he added. "Pictures of her, of him, to find out why I was off, to figure out why I felt something I couldn't explain. Now I know. I know where I saw that smile, all those years ago. The one time I ever saw a real smile from him, that day in the robe shop."
"Around six PM; I thought maybe I could be there when he gets home from work."
"Of course, you didn't." Blaise shook his head. "No way of knowing. So, Harry goes to Goo Lagoon, huh?"
"This is what you get when you wake me up at – what time’s it?”
Harry shook his head and winced. "Noo…down tha street a ways. Whole parlor thing there. Meet, like, the corner?" He pointed vaguely out the door. Draco nodded. "K."

Something had to be perfect in this world; it might as well be Potter and Malfoy. No one he knew deserved it more.
"Harry, Jesus, what the hell are you talking about?" Groggy though he was, a sick feeling was starting to churn in his stomach; Harry never used that tone of voice on him; sometimes, when they spoke about the past and the parts they'd played, it would show up, but only when speaking of the Enemy.  He never talked to
"Well then…" She looked up at the clock. "It's nearly time."
Harry looked down at the kernels. "These look like any normal kernels, don't they? But on two of the kernels, there is a smear of pink lip gloss. Diamond Dragon, I believe it's called, isn't it Ginny?"
At first, it had been an act - 'cool', uncaring Harry, up for random encounters of all times; he'd had to force himself. But one night it had become more. One night he had been dancing and looked around to see desire on more than one face; desire for him. Realized that men waited to ask him to dance, or buy him drinks; realized he was wanted. It was a heady feeling and lost and alone as he felt, he'd embraced it. But no
"They're so harsh," another one, Jacobus, complained. "Washes us out!"
Despite his fears, he had laughed. "You sound so completely certain of that."
Or had he just stopped noticing his lover's body about the time he started taking the man who inhabited it for granted?
In another part of the arena, the Weasleys were powdering their hands and preparing to fly through the air with the greatest of ease. Charlie had prudently covered his "altered" outfit until it was too late for his mother to do anything about it, and as the spotlights swept around the ring, there were cheers and whistles as Charlie smiled and bowed with a flourish, exposing a bit more skin than anyone expected. Ginny had just finished her pre-dinner taco, and wiped her hands on Ron before slapping Charlie's ass. "Niiice."
Draco came a moment before the words had a chance to register, but when they did register, he gaped, taking a second to comprehend. "Obviously," Draco answered, his voice curt, the hurt evident. "Sorry to keep you up."
"Wow, thank you - how'd you know what I drank?"
As the rest of the performers seemed to freeze in horror – Harry included –  Hagrid tried frantically to head the beast off with a red cloak, matador-style as Percy hid behind a post. At what seemed to be the last possible moment, Dumbledore raised his wand. "Petrificus Totallus!"
"Draco, you need to get over that, honestly." Pansy was looking at him pityingly and he scowled at her. Paul took his arm. "Come back here and let's decide what to do to you, okay?"
Harry stretched then, and Draco saw something small and gold flash in the lights; but then it was gone again. "Do you - I mean, are you a regular here?"
Blaise smiled. "She hates to see you sad too."
Harry scowled. "Maybe you aren't reading the right magazines."
The words were coming hard to him now… Harry didn't get it. He was looking for reasons to reject him. "You…I…I tried Harry! I tried but you were angry and hurt and didn't want to hear it, and by the time I realized why I'd done what I did, it was like you had moved to another fucking continent, emotionally! What the hell else was I supposed to do? Body-bind you and make you listen? No! I wanted you to listen because you cared and wanted to know why I was an asshole. And if you would only listen to Aaron, then you would only listen to Aaron! I did this…" he swept a shaking hand up and down his body. "For you! To get inside your head, to understand how you felt, to, God, fuck, to be with you, Harry. I love you."
Harry nodded. "They are." He bit his lip and then touched his face gently. "You're happy in this life, aren't you?"
And he WAS right there, beside him, almost touching, asking the bartender for a "…short scotch, no ice, thanks."
The fight had taken them both by surprise.
The next morning found him longing for coffee, pastry, and weed, and not necessarily in that order, so he dressed and left the hotel, finding another shop that appeared to exist merely to cater to his special needs; specifically, his need for Irish coffee, which was a fabulous way to start the first day of the rest of his life.
The "little rascal" was a hybrid of alligator and platypus and he didn't look, to Harry, as though "petting" was high on his agenda for the night. Thinking of petting made him think of Ginny and he grimaced. She had recently decided that she had a "massive, earth-shattering, life-altering" crush on him, and had taking to following him about, making suggestive remarks. He wasn't sure how to tell her that he a) thought of her as a sister b) had a thing for blonds and c) that the corndogs she favored were going straight to her arse. That last was of some concern because even Ron was having a tough time pulling her back up out of some dips and he worried that someday she'd pull him off the swing and down they'd go, arse over teakettle. He envisioned Ginny in a body cast, unable to follow him about, and smiled.

Sometimes he substituted a pill or tab of something for his customary shot of alcohol – didn't every musician? Oh, but he was not a musician, no. He was a Rock Star, and nobody had better forget it. Musicians could play instruments, compose and read notes on a staff, craft melody and pretty words; Draco's sole job was to alternately scream or croon lyrics into a headset or standing microphone, while swaying and writhing on stage, locking smoldering eyes with some young thing, and signing autographs. That was his job, and he did it so damn well that his complete lack of congeniality was tolerated – even rewarded.
When everyone was present and accounted for, Dumbledore ordered everyone to take a look around and check their quarters for anything suspicious. Knowing the Weasleys would scour their home, Harry decided to go with Draco and Lucius to check their quarters, which proved to be difficult ... because they were gone, burned to a cinder; nothing remained of their tent, or their belongings.
Harry nipped at the base of Draco's throat, leaving marks and not caring; he licked at the last one, then raised his head to bite Draco's chin before stepping back, stooping swiftly and pulling down Draco's trousers and pants, stopping to squeeze his balls and give a quick swipe of his tongue up his cock, swirling around the tip and sucking, pulling off with an audible pop and smirk as he stood back up, shoved his own trousers down and slid his arm under Draco's arse, effectively lifting him up and holding him against the wall. Harry reached backward and fumbled for the soap dispenser, filling his hand with liquid and rubbing it hastily between his fingers before sliding his hand under Draco and inserting one, then two slippery fingers into him, scissoring him, stretching him.
“You’d be surprised. Had a few insights into mine too.”
"No choice? You don't think they had a choice?" Harry's voice was incredulous, and he stopped and took a breath, then another bite of brownie. "You're telling me Draco Malfoy had no choice? He bragged about being a DE, showed people his Mark!"
He fell asleep with a wide, silly smile on his face.
And it was so fucking worth it – every last bit of it.
Draco pulled back and Harry gave him a small smile and turned his head to look out the window as Draco slid two fingers into him, stretching him. He did arch a bit when those slick fingers pressed down on the rough bump of nerves, and when Draco's cock slid into him, but while he was being thrust into, he stayed inert. He changed position slightly once, and just before Draco climaxed, he turned his head back to meet Draco's cool gray eyes. "You gonna be done soon?"
"Er, no."
"Are you okay?"
"You're just saying that, Professor. I want criticism."
"Merlin, are you blind? Look at me! My mum knew since I was a kid."
"Right, Harry?" Hermione said
"Together? Potter, please."
"Says the one who put his name in the Goblet of Fire."
"Still no. I'm not making you sleep on the couch."
"Fuck no, Potter."
okey dokey next chapter. i need criticism like Lola
"Were you and Pansy ever..."
"Very cool. Who's next?"
"Definitely not ready." Harry chuckled.
"Uh, yeah." He smiled, having no clue what she said. She smiled back in a knowing sort of way. There was nothing for her to know though. Obviously.
"Well, I lost mine. And the Elder Wand. Your wand is quite nice."
"Been looking for me, Potter?"
"You're impossible."
"Wonderful, we have two available rooms in the left wing? If you boys can handle being that close together, that is." She said with a small smile.
His class was starting. His class that he was teaching. Woah.
"What do you want to know?"
"Oh." Their footsteps echoed in the silent halls. The arrived at the little hallway with the two rooms side by side.
"Me too." Malfoy requested.
"Bollocks!" Harry cursed, quite loudly. He had dropped the stack of books he was  carrying with a thunk. He knelt down to collect them.
"We'll be fine, I guess." Harry told her. Malfoy nodded.
After two weeks, Harry settled into a routine. Teaching classes that were actually pretty fun, getting to know the kids, and having tea with Hagrid and Neville whenever he needed a break. He also wrote to all the Weasleys (including Hermione) on a regular basis. Although, he was missing Teddy quite a lot. Harry had became quite fond of the first years, especially the Slytherin, Rainy, and Gryffindor, Lola. There were also these two boys in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff who always cracked him up. Jasper and Ian were crowd favorites. Once, he saw Mrs. Norris chasing Jasper down the halls and couldn't help but think of his own days of mischief. That's the thing about coming back to Hogwarts. It was like coming back to your childhood home after escaping it all. Good and bad come out of it. Dumbledore's portrait was always somewhere near Harry and Malfoy's little hall. To be honest, he hadn't seen much of Malfoy. They crossed paths occasionally, exchanged an insult or two, and went on their way. It was best like that. He didn't deserve Harry's attention.
"Night."
"What did you think was going on?" Harry teased.
Either that girl was somehow already comfortable around him or she just simply did not give a shit, Harry liked her. Honestly, Malfoy would probably like her too, even if she was "finessing" him. Merlin, kids are weird.
"They haven't come back yet!"
"Tell me something about you." Harry  turned to look at the blonde next to him.
"I mean I guess so." Harry looked Malfoy up and down. Malfoy was pretty fit, quite honestly.
"Well, you could add more explanation to paragraph 4, it's a bit weak, but really, above and beyond work." He assured her.
"Harry! My boy!" Hagrid boomed as he clapped him on the shoulder. Harry finally broke the staring contest with Malfoy to grin at the large man sitting down next him.
"Rubbish! that's my thing!"
"Go tell her. We'll go find them." Harry assured them as he patted his waist to make sure his wand was secure.
"At least my hair looks good. Unlike yours." Harry finally finished. Draco scoffed.
"Malfoy. Are you okay?" He matched Malfoy's pace.
"'Mione is pregnant!"
"Fucking bollocks." Malfoy swore as the got up to their rooms. "I lost my key." His hand dropped to his wand.
"So, my wand?" He drawled as soon as they were out of earshot.
"Hope so."
Hogwarts had been restored to its full glory after the havoc of the war, it even had some new touches. Harry had some new touches as well. He had longer, somehow messier hair, slight stubble on his chin, and a closet of muggle clothes. He would pick blue jeans and a jacket over robes any day. Still had the same glasses though.
"For what?"
"Interesting." Pansy grinned. The night progressed. Everyone started to get a little more comfortable. Harry kept drinking.
"Hey, do you have a morning class?" Harry said as breakfast ended.
"Muggle France?"
"Then mediocre potion and good essay."
"I've been in France."
"Once in about fourth year, Pansy dared me to jump into the lake nude. And I did."
"Which do you want?" Malfoy muttered.
"What about you, Professor? Tell us something about yourself!" Lola asked.
"Hmm, yeah."
"I'm Rainy Winesap and I am bilingual."
"Want to take a walk?" Malfoy raised and eyebrow at that. "To the quidditch pitch or something."
"She's a raging lesbian and I'm gay, so no it would not make sense." Malfoy chuckled.
