“Poetic, Harry. I know he’s not gay, but if he was he’d be giving off serious mixed signals. Like the other night, when we held hands on the way back from the pub. It was a joke at first, sure, but then he didn’t let go. Just held my hand for an hour while we spoke about nothing. He’s always been tactile, I guess. It’s not new. It’s my own fault for getting confused. Pity he only does it when he’s drunk, now.”
Harry rushed through his shower and then set about the kitchen, still whistling. Hermione pottered in a few moments later, hair still wet.
It was a fine night, the very last traces of September warmth making it just possible for them all to sit outside. Blaise was complaining at length at the indignities of having to go to lectures –
want to. But I have to, don’t I? I helped save it, and now I have to change it, and I’m terrified of these three years being over before they’ve begun because this is the only chance I’ll ever have to take a break and figure myself out, so I can’t slow down, I can’t, because if I don’t do it all now then when will I ever?”
“Don’t lie. I would have been terribly helpful. I’m only a bitch because it helps gets everyone’s emotions out into the open.”
“I hate it,” he said to Finnegan, who was apparently avoiding Thomas again. There was less open shunning going on, and more a bewildered sense of what-the-fuckery that followed the two of them about after Thomas’s little breakdown. Luckily, it meant that Draco still had someone to drink with who wouldn’t invite Harry bloody Potter. “I was under house arrest for a year. How the
“Start what? I’m not saying it was wrong, Harry. But it’s fine for me, but not for Seamus? Why doesn’t he get consequences for his actions?”
“Yes. Shockingly, I do know a little about bigotry. You unlearn this stuff. It takes time, but you get there eventually. Your friends know you’re working on it.”
Michael was off, pulling himself along with his hands as he struggled to keep his knee elevated. Harry stood next to Blaise and watched him vanish round the corner. His heart was beating wildly. He turned to talk, but Blaise was grabbing his hand and apparating them.
She had, unfortunately, entered with Draco. Harry pushed through the mingled people towards them, desperate to avoid more Ronologuing. Hermione was looking gorgeous in a backless black velvet dress, her hair piled up on her head with a golden pin. Draco looked – his mind briefly turned to static. He bumped into Hannah Abbot.
“Accio beer,” he said, and the whole case came flying into his hands. “Well. That quickens things. I’m sorry about Pansy.”
“You don’t have to buy friendship. No one’s been a prick to you tonight, have they? Anyway, in case you missed it – I won’t tell them.”
“When did I turn you down? You were – I was – “ She hung her head. “I heard what you were saying earlier about me, ok? It doesn’t have to be awkward, we can still be friends – “
He grimaced. “Overcrowded. But the summer in New York was the best. Here, let me get that.” He picked up her bag and slung it over his shoulder with no trouble at all, despite the fact that it was full of heavy tomes. Maybe he was windlessly lightening it, but he was also just very, very well-muscled. “Which are you?”
She tried to put everything she was thinking about into those three words. That she’d been wrong, every time she’d looked at Lavender and just seen frills and flirtation and girliness. That there had always been bravery in her, even in the moments Hermione had written off – that it was brave, actually, to throw yourself at the sports hero in the middle of the common room and hope for the best. That everything she’d ever thought about Lavender, and Parvati by extension, had been more about herself than the two of them. That there were more ways to be brave than she counted.
“Yes. Don’t worry. I know it’s ugly.” He was tracing the lines of it with his fingertips. “Ugly mind, ugly body as my mother always used to say.”
“Well, Potter, I’d like to say something about how being freed from the restrictive standards applied to pureblood wives allowed me to discover my own taste, but honestly it’s just to piss off my parents.”
“Huh.” Draco shook his head, not in disbelief but more like a dog trying to shake off a fly. “Well. I suppose she knows I can’t bear to hear about the weasel. Thank you, Potter.”
“I’ll come too,” said Draco, and he busied himself around Hermione’s room, shaking out blankets and lighting candles and plumping pillows while Harry sat on the floor with Hermione and held her hand. After a while Parvati came in, and the two of them curled up together on the bed.
“I’m just bekow you,” she said, opening her book again. Which was – odd. Because that was not an answer.
“You’re so good at this, mate,” said Seamus. “Look, Harry. There’s so much good stuff about to happen. Let’s not focus on the bad shit, yeah?”
Harry waited, and drank Blaise’s wine because he needed it. He felt like ripping Michael’s face off his skull. Was that too violent?
Anyway, this chapter requires a trigger warning for sexual assault. I have not tagged this fic rape/non-con because the actual act doesn't occur, and nothing happens 'on screen.' But this chapter does contain a description of someone using manipulation and emotional coercion to force someone into sex. As you've probably gathered if you're still reading this story, it's based heavily on my own uni years, and this issue was so prevalent and common that it just wove itself into the story.
getting comfy with his flatmates. They all barely tolerated him, anyway. Probably they had only been showing him kindness because Potter seemed to favour him. Probably they were all out there in the kitchen right now, laughing at him for thinking that anyone would ever look at him and
“Fine,” said Draco, because Potter’s eyes were ridiculous and probably a war crime. “I will come, on the condition that if anyone tries to read their poetry to me I get to Crucio them while you look the other way.”
“She really can,” said Harry. “Look, if you’re going to say something horrible about her being a lesbian at any point, get it out of the way now.”
“No.” Draco’s eyes were impossibly lovely and sad. “When you did it – I felt relieved. That’s a horribly fucked up thing to say, isn’t it?”
And he fled back into the party, trying to avoid anyone’s gaze. He found Susan and Blaise in the corner, and settled in next to them. They were safe. They weren’t doing anything confusing, like throwing Harry’s clearly set ideas about them after eight years down the drain.
“Why not?” Dean’s tone was a marvel. He had drawn himself up to his full height – not inconsiderable – and was staring Seamus straight down. He looked polite, questioning, a little confused, as if someone had just presented him with the wrong dish at a restaurant. Only his eyes and his voice were hard as ice. Harry uncomfortably remembered that Dean had spent most of the war living underground, on the run from the government, and was perhaps not quite the affable chap that Harry remembered.
“I have a terrible secret,” said Draco, pacing in front of the assembled Council of Slytherins who had gathered in Pansy’s flat. “And I need you not to hate me for it. You’re probably going to hate me a little bit, and I’m sorry, but there’s nothing really I can do about it. Oh god, wait, I can’t tell you. It’s too terrible.”
Harry should have had a family waiting for him on the other side of all this. He should have had Sirius, and Remus, and a house they would have cleared of ghosts together.
McGonagall hadn’t. Hermione had, storming up to him while he was considering trying to teach the Giant Squid to play catch and dropping a bunch of prospectus’s in front of him.
“Harry and Draco were having it out, and then we came along, so they ducked in here,” said Ron. “And then you came along, so we ducked in here. And then Dean and Seamus came along, so – well, you know.”
The party had finally died out around five in the morning. The sky was blood-red at the edges of the east, and Draco was kicking his heels against the kitchen cabinet and drinking a cup of tea.
“Oh for crying out loud, Blaise,” drawled Draco. “You wouldn’t be trying to suggest that our saviour would be anything other than straight as a ruler?”
it was all those things and so much more. It was her teeth growing over her chin and children in the playground yanking on her curls and saying
“Does this sudden flush of love mean you’re going to start talking to him again instead of generally running around like a lunatic?” said Blaise, examining himself in the mirror. “Also, does anyone think my hairlines beginning to recede?”
Draco didn't need the reminders of him. He had enough memories of Harry in his mind to remind him on a daily basis of the Boy Who Had Lived.
"Tomorrow," muttered Hermione to herself. "The 30th. Yes, why didn't I remember that? You're a day older than Harry."
"What Ron? It's not like I haven't seen you both naked before!" commented Ginny, a sly smile spreading across her face. She caught Harry smirking at her through the corner of her eye.
And after Harry and Ginny had broken up, he never left his place. The press had had a field day when word got out that the golden couple from the war had called off their engagement. The break up had been mutual and they had even released a statement saying so. But that didn't stop the Prophet and every other garbage news outlet in England to product rubbish about them. They had all attacked Ginny, of course, blaming her for breaking The Chosen One's heart.
The Weasley finished off her article and sent it to the editor via owl before getting ready and she Floo over to Hermione's flat. The two girls had agreed to have a quiet evening in together of take-out (because both of them were terrible at cooking, despite Molly Weasley's numerous attempts at teaching them) and a bottle of wine or two. It was Friday after all.
Ginny said something underneath her breath as she threw another dirty look in Pansy's direction before turning her attention back onto Hermione.
," huffed Pansy. "Plus I thought you had a crush on him." She gently nudged the Weasley with her shoulder and flash her a shit-eating grin. She loved to tease her friend about her interest in the former Slytherin.
Hermione couldn't help but smile broadly at the former Slytherin. Never in a million years did she think she would be inviting a stuck-up pureblood Slytherin to an event she was hosting, however, all those old feelings were behind them.
"Then count me in!" He flashed her a charming smile before finishing off his drink. Blaise was down for any gala or event where there was an open bar. "I'll even get Malfoy to come."
He had long ago put stupid schoolhouse rivalries aside. He no longer saw anyone but Slytherins as the enemy. That was all childish crap. He was a grown man now. He accepted that a person was something more than their Hogwarts house or blood status really. Draco before the war would not be caught dead in muggle London, let alone in a muggle cafe. But Draco after the war was a different person entirely.
"Don't worry, they didn't tell me." injected Ginny as if reading Harry's thoughts. "I just sort of figured it out." She'd seen them leave a muggle bar hand-in-hand once when she'd been out with her coworkers once. They hadn't seen her though. And then Hermione and she had gotten extremely drunk right after her split from Ron and told Ginny the whole thing after she'd just asked how Harry was doing.
Tearing his eyes away from the tent he reached blindly out for his wand on the nightstand and did a quick spell. His wand flashed it was just past 1 am. He was officially thirty. Dropping his wand beside him, he reached for his glasses and sat up further in the bed. He kicked the sheets to the end of the bed as he did so. He was wide awake now. He'd been hoping to get a good night's sleep tonight, but it seemed like that wouldn't be happening.
"I remember the invitation. It had been pink and filled with glitter," Harry made a face as he remembered how the glitter had seemed to stay for days afterward even though he had used a strong cleaning spell after it poured onto the floor after opening the envelope.
"Harry's 30th birthday party. Mum has gone all out this year!" explained Ginny quickly as she shoved a forkful of pad thai into her mouth.
"What do you want Pansy?" asked Ginny as she slipped her hand out from Blaise grip and looked over at the other woman.
"Well. He's mine," replied Hermione as she sat up a little straighter in her seat and glared at the Slytherin. "And I won't bet on him."
Ginny was surprised that Pansy had picked the tired muggle bar over something more flashy and trendy. But a sense of nostalgia washed over her as she sat back against the worn red leather of the booth and sipped her cocktail. The place reminded her of The Three Broom Sticks in away. The redhead hadn't been to Hogsmeade in what was probably a good three years or so.
"Nothing," replied Harry after a moment had passed. "You know that Gin." His green eyes stared into her brown ones. "He just came up for a visit. It doesn't mean anything." Yes, they had gotten drunk off of some elderberry wine that Neville had brought with him and slept together. But that was their routine. They both did it more out of comfort than anything else nowadays. Sure it had been hot and heavy the first few months when they'd both been discovering that side of themselves. But then Neville met someone, a wizard from France, and their little thing came to an end. Harry had been happy that Nevile had found someone. And Harry had gone one to find someone for himself a few months later. And when both of those relationships fizzled out a year or so later they reunited like nothing had changed until someone else came along.
Because up until that point, he had only known himself with having a part of Voldemort inside of him. He didn't know this new Harry Potter. This Harry didn't have to worry about evil and death. Who had this whole new world of possibilities ahead of him? He should've felt relieved and apart of him had been. But a majority of what he'd been was fear. Not fear for his life like he'd during the war. No, fear of freedom. Fear of having to choose what he wanted this new start to be about. He'd never had the choice before. His life had always been mapped out for him in some way. Growing up with the Dursley's he'd always done what was told of him to do and the same went when he came to Hogwarts and learned more about Volatmore. He had always been programmed to fight. No one along the way had ever asked him- Hey, Harry, what do you want? Do you want to fight?
Harry had never liked to be the centre of attention, but he never got anxious about it until after the war when he couldn't escape it. Where ever he went, the attention followed him.
"Well, my research ended in Wales," began to explain Neville a slight blush creeping into his cheeks. Despite the war, making him into a stronger man, the shy eleven-year-old sometimes made an appearance, especially when he'd been drinking.
However, the outside might look abandoned and broken, the inside was a different story. Harry had had the energy to make the inside liveable and cozy. It was made up of exposed brick walls and whitewashed paneling. The floors were a warm walnut colour. There were rich splashes of colour here and there. It was all very Harry like. He'd never been one for interior decorating. When he had first moved into Grimmauld Place, he had attempted to fix it up a bit himself, but it had taken Hermione and Ginny to really make it feel like a home and not some Black family haunted mansion.
Ginny's eyes followed in the direction of where Pansy had gestured too. Her eyes fell onto the Neville and Luna dancing. She knew that Pansy was interested in Luna for a while now, but despite oozy confidence was surprisingly shy when it came to the blonde.
Ginny opened her mouth to say something but before she could the back door opened and Harry stepped through.
Harry took a swing of his beer and looked away from his two friends. He wanted to give them some sort of privacy. From what? He wasn't sure of. It just felt right though.
Blaise was silent for a second as he studied the redhead's freckled face before slowly nodding his head in agreement.
No, Draco kept more to himself because he just was a private person. He only kept a handful of close friends nowadays; Pansy, Blaise, Theo, and the Greengrass sisters. They were the only company he needed. Maybe a few years ago, he would've thought differently. Two years ago to be exact when there had been a chance to have more when he'd thought there had been more but had been greatly wrong.
Hermione frowned slightly at Ginny's insult of herself. The feminist inside of her rowed in protest. She hated when Ginny or anyone of her female friends insulted or put themselves down. However, no matter how much she wanted to say something, she held back. She didn't want to start off the night with fighting with Ginny.
"Come here!" murmured Ron after an awkward moment had passed between the two ex-lovers and he smiled that lazy smile of his at her. He held open his arms wide for Hermione to step into.
He knew his anxiousness wasn't just because of the party later on today. It was about the rest of the week in general. He'd promised Hermione that he would attend her stupid S.P.E.W gala charity event thing on Friday and which had led somehow to him promising to stay in London for the week leading up to it. He was staying overnight at the Burrow after the party before returning to 12 Grimmauld Place. The property was still in his name. He hadn't had the heart to sell the old Black family house in the end. Instead, he just let it stay, gathering in dust only using it when in town and not even then. Kreacher the house-elf was still alive and living there, always keen to help his master when needed.
After the war, he had been expecting to make a career as an Auror. And he almost had. What else was a hero like him to do? Fighting dark forces and evil was all he knew how to do really. However, in the end, Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived-Twice, hadn't had it in him to except Kingsley's offer to join the Auror force at the Ministry. Despite his best friend, Ron Weasley doing so.
Ginny began to sing along to the new song playing from the radio as she untied the small roll of parchment from the owl's outstretched leg. The owl hooted before taking off into the open window, disappearing into the London cityscape.
Ginny and Luna held back, just a few feet away as the two former Slytherins embraced and air-kissed both cheeks. Hermione had gone to the bar to get them a couple of drinks.
"You're ghastly late, Zabinni," commented Draco as he waved a hand to get the waitresses attention. "I've been waiting here for over half-an-hour like some poor fool who has been stood up by a date."
bloody years after the war they had tried. But it just wasn't meant to be. It wasn't that they didn't love each other. They just had some point had fallen out of love with each other. They were just much better off as friends than lovers. Not that the sex hadn't been great. That had never been an issue for them either. Let's just say it was complicated their past relationship.
"What time is the party?" she asked. Molly may or may not had invited her but she was bloody well going to go anyways.
"I don't know if bringing Malfoy will be a good idea…" frowned Hermione picking off a stray thread from her dress.
For a weird moment, Harry was filled with nostalgia as he sat back on the old iron rod porch swing with Ginny's feet on his lap and looked over at where Ron was seated on the steps of the porch with an arm around a very sleepy Hermione. For a second he forgot all about the years that had pasted and was transformed back to a simpler time. Well maybe not a simpler time. It had been the summer after the war. He had Ginny had just decided to get back together again and try. It had been around his birthday too. Ron and Hermione had just started dating. They were all in the blissful honeymoon phase of their relationships and had the whole world at their feet, or so it felt like. That was when Harry's nightmares had been at their worse, fresh, and painful from the war. He barely slept then, still didn't really sleep much to be honest. Coming outside and looking up at the stars was the only real comfort for him at the time. Ginny, who just wanted to be with him, would sneak out and join him on the porch swing. Ron and Hermione shortly after. They had nightmares too.
At three on the dot, Harry and Ron emerged from the room and headed outside to the back where the main event was going to be happening. Since Harry had arrived the back garden which overlooked the orchid of the Weasley property had been turned into a party area. There were clustered of round tables and chairs spread out along the lawn. There were poles extracted along the edge of the yard where strings of fairy lights and lanterns hung. There was a big banner stretched over two that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY! Harry was both touched and a little embarrassed about the fuss the Weasley's had made with transforming the yard just over his birthday. It all kinda reminded him of Bill and Fleur's wedding, even though there was no giant tent this time.
Neville once again blushed and looked down into the confines of his empty glass. He didn't know why he was acting so coy. He blamed it majorly on the three glasses of Firewhiskey he'd had prior to the girls arriving. "I...well I came home to visit Gran. I always come to see her on my birthday…"
Hermione just shrugged at this. She was sure there was a perfectly good explanation of how her invitation had gotten lost in the post. She took a sip from her wine before letting out a sigh.
He took another drink from his glass before placing the now empty crystal tumbler down on the coffee table in front of him. He pinched his nose before letting out a deep sigh and slumping back against the armchair.
"If you win, I'll make you fulltime writer at Witch Weekly. You will no longer have to write about stupid pointless Quidditch matches. You can have your own column!"
"Get the fuck out of here then!" he cried in outrage. "Me and Harry are trying to get dressed here!"
"No. No. Bloody hell. It's not that!" Hermione looked up from her dress and over to Pansy with a genuine look of hurt in her eyes. "It's just that Harry will be there."
"Fine," huffed Ginny. "What do you want to be then?" Her brown eyes flashing towards Pansy, eyebrows raised, waiting for an answer.
"That sounds too easy," injected Pansy. "Plus, when is it just about the two of you? I want in! And I will not sleep with any of you." Pansy, who was openly gay had no interest in sleeping with any of her friends. No matter how pretty Ginny looked tonight. Her interest lay elsewhere in the room.
No one would suspect the savior to the wizarding world would be living in an old abandoned-looking farmhouse in Wales.
Neville knew the reference was vaguely from a popular muggle song, but that was it. He looked at his friends perplexed but soon his embarrassment and confusion weathered away to happiness. A sheepish grin spread across his face as a sudden wave of warmth filled his chest. He was no longer shy about it being his birthday as he lifted one of the shots in front of him. "Cheers!" he cried before draining it in one go. He closed his eyes as the liquid burned down his throat.
"Are you seeing anyone? I know you are busy training owls and what not but there must be some good looking wizard or witch off in Wales that has caught your attention!" she teased slightly. She didn't ask because she was jealous. She just thought that Harry was too good looking and nice not to have a special someone in his life.
Except there wasn't. It was the middle of summer and England was currently going through a heat-wave. Only a complete idiot would have a fire going in the middle of summer like that. The blond wizard was too hot in his own skin anyways. But he still missed the comforts sounds of the fire going as he continued to sit there in his living room.
Now, when she looked back at them as a couple, she just saw it as going through the motions of an actual real relationship. Harry had been searching for some sort of normal after the hell he'd gone through with Voldemort and the war. She had wanted to be that normal for him. Her seventeen-year-old self had wanted to make her eleven-year-old self come true by being with Harry Potter. But like most young love that had developed out of the ashes of the war, it eventually came undone. Love that had been passionate and fiery at the start burning out months or a few years after. All the upperclassman of Hogwarts had just been seeking out something that made them feel alive and good after so much death and decay.
The morning dew on the long grass brushed against the bare skin of his calves and made the rubber of his trainers squeak with each step as he walked towards the barn. The farm used to be a working one with horses, pigs, cattle, and chickens. The muggle who had sold it to him had informed him. However, that had been decades ago. It had fallen into disarray since then. Harry who had purchased the farm two years ago had not bought it to return to its glory working days. He'd simply bought it because he liked the bones of the old farmhouse and it was so different from his previous place in London. In a way, it had reminded him of the Burrow, minus the Weasley family of course.
Harry suddenly got out of bed and shook his head, trying to get rid of the thoughts of what the day would bring. It was too early to be thinking about all this. Plus he was a grown-ass man. He shouldn't any longer feel anxious when it came to this stuff. And it hadn't been a real issue until after the war. Growing up, Harry's birthday had never felt special, until he came to Hogwarts and he met people who actually loved and cared for him and wanted to make a big deal of his date of birth. He had enjoyed his birthdays and parties than between the years at Hogwarts.
He sold off all his owls to shops and people across the UK and Europe. He did this all under a different name of course. He didn't dare to let the public world to get wind that the famous Harry Potter used his time now to train owls. Only his closest friends knew what he was doing up here in Wales, besides living a quiet life away from the wizarding world.
As he waited for the kettle to boil a tawny owl appeared suddenly at the open window. He recognized the owl as one of his own.
Harry hadn't been seen in the public eye in over a year. Ever since two years ago, he made it a habit to stay out of the limelight and out of London as much as possible. He only now made the odd appearance at a charity event, usually one of Hermione's. After the war, he had tried living his life as normal as possible. But it had been difficult when everywhere he went he was bombarded with people from the press or fans wanting his autograph or a picture. For the first few years, he had put up with it. Figuring it was his duty not only as a war hero but because he felt guilty. So many people had lost their lives because of him. The least he could do was shake a stranger's hand and take a picture every now and then he thought. It was a small price to pay in comparison or so he told himself.
“Jesus,” said Draco a few moments later. “Ok, get out of this bed right now, before it ‘never happens again’ again.”
Blaise looked apologetically at Harry. “I’ll get him to bed. You go calm down Hannah. The girl’s had quite a fright.”
And him hard as fuck, moaning as Harry just took him, just took what he wanted. Thinking about how lucky it was that he got to see this, how lucky he’d been if his whole shit-waste of a life ended up with him here on the bedroom floor making Harry come.
“Dibs on Hannah,” said Seamus, grabbing her arm and twirling her as she giggled. “Maybe you can have Morag, Harry.”
“Ok, and I’m realising now that maybe you didn’t realise that half the Ravenclaw boys have had a crush on you since fourth year?”
She shrugged. “I don’t know what you want me to say, Harry. Hooray, Malfoy’s changed? What does that change for you?”
“Stay quiet,” muttered Blaise, moving swiftly. There was Michael Corner, sitting at a sad table at the back alone and downing what looked to be his third whiskey.
Draco got up to piss, and then he came back to bed and tossed them both off with one hand straining around the combined width of them, cock rubbing slickly against Harry’s, while his other hand sunk into Harry’s hair and pulled his head back. The noises he made were filthy and incandescent.
“Did you see Blaise do the splits?” said Harry, trying to land on a safe topic, and luckily Draco laughed.
Blaise sighed. “Oh, this is going to be difficult. Harry, did you know that Hermione went to the cinema with Anthony on Monday?”
“Of course, you won’t have as much as a problem with difficult customers with this one. One word from him and they’ll be scurrying out the door. Just make sure he doesn’t bring any of his old friends around, you know?” He tapped the side of his nose conspiratorially and winked, as the barman looked between the two of them with his jaw open. “And then – “
about you. Obsessing over you at school, getting more and more frantic with every scrap of attention you poured away from me and towards the war. Doing my NEWTS at the manor and cutting out each press clipping, burning inside and wondering if you were thinking about me at all, or if you were too busy enjoying your victory. And then this year you had the audacity to actually – to look at me –“
“Good luck, mate,” said Harry, and pulled his head out of the fire. He sat down heavily against the stone of the fireplace and looked around his room. He should really get to unpacking. He really should. He would, any minute now. It was just –
“I blame my mother,” he said, over coffee with Harry and Dean. “If she hadn’t been a paragon of the social graces, Blaise would never have asked me for my help. Oh, how I long to go back to those simple days of selecting the most elegant centrepiece. She always sent a message, that woman.”
“Enchanting,” said Anthony, threading a hand through Theo’s with mock-earnestness. “Delightful. Delicious.”
“Not good,” said Dean, leaning heavily on Harry’s shoulder. “Cause of the Malfoy bit, not the boner for boys bit. Rock on, Harry. Wait, while talking?”
“Um, all right. Won’t you be a bit of a third wheel though? I mean, they’ll probably want to, uh, you know.” Draco pulled back sharply. “What? What did I do?”
She shut her eyes and leant back on the dew-wet grass. “Do you remember when you apologised to me and I asked you if I was attractive?”
Snape had cared because of his mother, and Sirius had cared because of his father, and Dumbledore had cared because Harry was a weapon. Maybe only Remus had cared for Harry himself, and in the end it didn’t matter because they were all dead, dead, dead.
“Ok,” he said carefully. An anxious Ron was a little like a Hippogriff - best to approach with extreme caution. “What’s it about?”
She gave him a furious look from under her hair. “Please, Harry. We don’t have time for denials right now. I’m having an emotional crisis.”
“I hate you,” said Pansy. “I hate you so much, and I’m going to tell our future kids that you said that about their hypothetical noses.”
“I’ll just – er – I’ll be back in a minute, ‘Mione.” Pansy was tugging on his sleeve with surprising strength.
“Right,” said Harry through his teeth. “I’m possibly bi now, so apparently I need a whole basket of condoms. I’m probably shagging the whole town, right?”
“Oh, he’s a horror. He’s – “ Draco’s face went soft, and Harry suddenly flashed back to Blaise saying
Pansy Parkinson stood alone in the rain, her hair slicked to her face like a skull cap, shivering in her inappropriate clothes. Her face was a terrible blank.
“Ta very much, Granger, have fun tonight!” He was always running away from people these days, it seemed. He had been invited to the Halloween party upstairs, which surprised him, but he knew Potter would be there being drunk and open and fuckable. He kept being invited to pub nights too, which surprised him. What surprised him more was how much he wanted to go. It wasn’t even about Potter. He’d just become – surprisingly – used to people.
Ron turned towards them, his face lighting up as he reeled Harry in and pulled him into a bear hug, like everything was normal and Ron wasn’t drinking with the Slytherins.
Harry nodded, hoping to keep attention off him, and thankfully it turned away. Pansy dared Daphne to lick the table, which after much gagging and mocking she finally did, and Dean laughingly confessed to having released all the animals he caught in traps during his year on the run because he felt bad for them, and a red-faced Theo had admitted to being the actual mastermind behind the slogan “Potter Stinks” – “because Draco was going on and on about finding the perfect thing that would emotionally crucify you, and I just couldn’t take it anymore.”
“Great!” said Blaise, bounding away. Last night he’d had to be carried in by two strangers, neither of who knew his name and one who didn’t speak English. Harry was pretty sure he’d slept on the kitchen table. The man was a marvel.
Dean leant against the railings of the balcony, and idly considered throwing himself off into the river.
Nobody noticed when he left the pub. He moped along, barely even feeling when it started to rain. Ron would know what to do. Ron wouldn’t throw him over for someone new. Except Ron had his exciting new auror life now. And Pansy. He’d been drinking with Draco too. He’d probably tell Harry he was being ridiculous, and that he needed to get over himself.
Susan was gaping. Her hair was plastered to her head, and her dress shirt was sticking to her skin, and even if Harry didn’t like women that much, he could appreciate that she was beautiful.
Except Malfoy apparently preferred to bankrupt himself rather than admit defeat, because he just lifted his chin and started taking orders, and then announced that a round of shots for everyone seemed to be quite within the spirit of the night to general cheers and Hermione’s protests. He headed off to the bar, his face grim, and Harry couldn’t help himself. Bloody saviour complex.
Whatever. He would bang on every door until he found him. He was on a righteous quest for his god-given, well-owed apology.
Susan whirled around at Blaise, her eyes sparkling. “I want you to leave me alone, Blaise, because I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough of you following me around everywhere, with this joke flirting and this over the top chivalry act. You think I don’t know what you’re doing? You think I haven’t had this before? Do you want to know how many times I got asked out as a joke? How many times I heard “Oi Susan, my mate fancies you” just to hear a chorus of ewws and giggles? You all think it’s funny, don’t you. Flirting with the fat girl. Oh, how sad, she thinks someone actually finds her attractive. Well, I’m not tolerating this bullshit anymore, and I haven’t fallen for it in a long time. I’ve spent my whole life wishing that each one was true, that maybe someone had bothered to look past their instinctive judgement that any woman over a size sixteen isn’t a person and discovered that I’m funny and intelligent and kind – and sexy, too, I’m hot as hell and I’m a lay and a half. I don’t need your jokes, Blaise, and I sure as hell don’t need your pity flirting. I do not need to be grateful for the scraps of attention the world gives me as some kind of charity for being fat. I’ll find someone who likes me for me, and if I don’t I’ll die alone happy as a clam and still loving myself. So you – you can fuck off.”
“You know what?” Seamus stood up, pushing himself into Dean’s space. “Maybe I should. There’s lots of things I don’t need to see.”
“We were drunk,” said Hermione. “When I snogged Malfoy. And then he told me he was gay. And I was crying when I snogged Harry. And then I told him I was gay.”
“I’m going because it will be a boost to my reputation. And because…” He trailed off. Why was he going? He’d been very clear with Harry – just sex and friendship. Well, he’d been clear on the sex front, the friendship was more implied. It was nice to have Potter looking up at him so eagerly. For so long, there’d been Potter’s face in his head, turning away as Draco offered him his hand. Now, whenever the bad nights came and he could feel Nagini’s breath on him as real as life, there was another memory – Potter underneath him, shaking like the world was ending as Draco fucked into him – that he could pull around himself like a golden blanket to ward off the dark.
She sniffed. “Cedric wouldn’t want me pouring peach puree over a surface in his memory. We must honour his wishes.”
“Ugh.” Hermione took a deep drink. “Kill Michael. He’s smart, but he’s just so immature. And I get the sense that he likes that I’m smart, but would prefer it if I was just smart enough to follow what he’s saying but not smart enough to sometimes disagree, you know? You know Ginny broke up with him because Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw?”
Except there had been a million moments that Parvati could have made a move if she wanted to. She hadn’t. Because Hermione had strange teeth and an odd face and didn’t know how to talk to people. Because she debated too fiercely when they spoke about books. Because she was short and dumpy and she’d never been pretty for twenty-four consecutive hours.
“I get it,” said Parvati. “Even though you won in the end, there will always be this memory of the time you weren’t enough.”
“Best to make sure,” said Harry, and Blaise finally drew his wand and threw a stinging jinx across Michael’s back.
“So. Virtue ethics. You pick something to venerate – bravery, intelligence, patience and loyalty – and you decide whether an action is right or wrong based on how well it measures up to those virtues.”
“Nothing doing, I’m afraid. As you pointed out, I’m all alone in the world now. I do need to ply a trade somewhere.”
“Is that what you want, Bones?” Theo’s voice was calm and soothing. “I think that sounds nice, don’t you?”
“Don’t be a berk, it’s not silly,” said Ron. “Seems like yonks ago it was just us three vs the world, doesn’t it?”
He’d thought that actually fucking might be some watershed moment, but it wasn’t. It was more of the same, more of them – this frantic need for each other’s bodies, the shared bewilderment that both of them could like this so much. The way that Draco would look at him like he couldn’t believe this.
He peeled a strip from the label of his bottle, examining it in the reflected light. “I’m considering it. Might give them something else to talk about.”
“Imagine,” said Dean, with a theatrical flourish, “imagine if someone had, I don’t know, asked me to draw a portrait of you – “
She dragged Hermione onto the dancefloor, red dress against gold as she looped an arm round her waist. It was confusing and dark and she couldn’t dance, and then Parvati put her hands on her waist and suddenly she could. They moved against each other, red against gold. Hermione had a feeling she couldn’t place, and then she could. It was the same feeling she’d had when she and Harry and Ron had reunited after getting the Philosopher’s Stone. A sense that she was part of a set. Belonging.
“Because honestly? You probably could. I’m fucking needy. I’m a mess. I can’t survive dating. I should have done what Molly said and settled down. I would only be a tiny bit unhappy.”
“Who’s jumping me?” said Neville from behind him, and Draco went bright red. Harry was laughing so hard it must have hurt.
“Look,” he said, as soon as Harry opened the door. “If we’re doing this, it’s going to be a secret. I won’t have my good name sullied by having sex with the likes of you.”
“Probably up to something,” said Ron, trying to keep a straight face. “Better make a magic map of Royal College and track him on it.”
“I left my card in his room,” she whispered. “I guess Seamus is asleep? I could go stay with Susan.”
Dean grimaced. Seamus was no longer a persona non grata, but there was still an edge between the two of them. “Fine, as ever. He apologised to me, again. Properly this time. Apparently your man Malfoy set him straight.”
Just as she stood there, frozen at the cusp of decision, she caught a pale flash from the corner of her eye. There was Ron watching her, mouth open. His hands were clenching limply by his sides. Ron, who she’d abandoned because she needed to find herself, who hadn’t deserved any of her tangled mess. She couldn’t do this to him, or herself. What had she thought, that going to university would un-Granger her? She would always be better at books than people, and everyone who wanted her now just wanted a phase she was going through.
Harry leant over and traced the long slashes of Sectumsempra across his chest. There was another one, high on his bicep, which he guessed was from Buckbeak. “And the body they’re on. Does this one still hurt?”
“Are you and Draco all right?” Dean asked him a few days later over a post-lecture pint. He had a smudge of blue high on his neck that Harry wasn’t planning on telling him about.
“Mate,” he said, interrupting another future catastrophe that Ron was painting in exquisite detail, “if you were shagging someone, and then they stopped because they were pissed off at you, and then you made up, could you start shagging them again? Hypothetically?”
Hermione, queen that she was, had managed not to fall into a confusing friends-with-benefits situation with Anthony after sleeping with him one time. They were still flirting and going out for coffee, but so were she and Terry Boot and she and Michael.
“Then show her in your own way. Do something that you do well, for her. Just let her know that it’s all for her.”
“Harry, dear, I do understand that you think I am an evil Slytherin Death-Eater sympathiser, and I do see how our interactions at school could have given you that idea – I am, after all, a Slytherin, and I’m probably not
“Oh no, Harry, that’s too bad. I thought for sure when he apologised to me – “ She covered her mouth. “Whoops. Oh no. I wasn’t meant to say that.”
“I was thinking more for as long as you want. I mean, you’re a Black. It is kind of your house too.”
Harry looked at Dean and Seamus, but only Seamus returned his “please-help-me” look. Dean was happily sliding into the seat next to Blaise, with Seamus taking the place on his other side. Harry took the empty seat in between Draco and Ron. Now that he looked, he saw that the majority of Slytherins had been crowded around one side of the table, with Ron on the other side almost like a job interview.
“There, there.” Ron patted his shoulder, his fingers tangling with Hermione’s curls in the process. “Don’t worry, I’m sure life will still be terrible in small ways. I mean, your boyfriend is a raving lunatic who’s currently arguing with Padma over colour palettes, and Hermione’s girlfriend has an evil twin, and Pansy is – “
“That’s all right,” said Luna. She still sounded kind of airy, but mostly she just sounded drunk. “You should go and dance! You’re free now, Hermione. Everyone free should dance.”
The door opened, just a crack. Harry saw a small, white face, and then it slammed shut again. Dean made another lunge for the door as it closed, but Blaise had him tight. They struggled together for a while, and then Dean just collapsed, shaking into Blaise’s arms.
Blaise was settling next to Michael on the bench, throwing one arm round his shoulders and Harry, who privately thought he might have been having a stroke, took the chair opposite.
Plus, Harry didn't believe that the break up would last forever. He knew the two still slept together occasionally when they got drunk at the same party or where just feeling lonely and bored. They had both confided him numerous times after it had happened and they both immediately regretted taking advantage of the other. Harry didn't believe in fate and all that crap, but he did believe that Ron and Hermione were meant to be together.
"Ok. Ok," replied Ron at this sister before getting to his feet and heading over to the small dresser in the room. As he pulled open the middle draw and began to roughly around for a pair of socks, he looked over his shoulder and gave Ginny who had taken a step further into the room and was about to take a seat on the edge of Harry's bed.
"So sex? If you get Malfoy into the same room with Harry, you get to sleep with me?" She tried not to sound too hopeful of the prospects. It had been a few months since she'd been with anyone.
Most of the adults had left or gone off to bed, leaving the kids to themselves. Well, technically they were all adults, but the older ones (Molly, Arthur, Bill, Fleur, Percy, and his wife, Penelope) called it a night. Leaving, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny left. Seamus and Dean who had come together had left together shortly after George and Phil. Luna had fallen asleep at one of the tables. Neville hadn't stayed long after arriving at around five. Hannah had left with him.
He listened to the creak of the backdoor opening and closing before leaning back on the swing and looking once again up at the stars.
Pansy just smiled smugly at the redhead lost of words. Ever since Ginny had inquired if Blaise was single from her, she'd meant to set the two of her friends up. However, Blaise was always traveling and was never in London it seemed. However, tonight he was and Pansy had mentioned how he should come along. Of course, Blaise being a typical man hadn't given her straight yes or no. However, she had a good feeling that Blaise, one of her oldest friends would come through tonight.
Ginny let him go and listened as the two chatted away, ignoring the perplexed looks from Pansy and Blaise. Even after the decade that has passed since that night, Neville was still embarrassed about it. It was ultimately what broke Ginny and Harry up. For the longest time, Neville blamed himself for the golden couple's split. However, Ginny had reassured him countless times that it wasn't because of him they had ended it. It had been years coming to the break-up, it just happened to take that night to put it all into perspective. That he and Ginny wanted...no desired different things.
Harry groaned as he stared at the tent of his boxers. He debated with himself if he wanted to finish it off or not. If it had been any other person from a past relationship that had caused the erection, he would've jerk himself off in a heartbeat. But that fact that it had been Draco fucking Malfoy, his once nemesis turned lover turned ex was causing him to second guess about having a morning masturbation session.
“And then there’s our glorious saviour,” said Blaise, and Harry shrank into his chair. He really, really didn’t want to be snogged by Blaise Zabini. For one thing, Ron, and for another thing, Draco. “So dashing, so handsome. Who wouldn’t want to swoon in his arms? And Weasley, of course – another hero, and with the biceps to match. Pans – “
“That’s me,” said Daphne, with an enchanting giggle. She leant forward, a cloud of perfume and silk and breasts. Morag focused heavily on her breathing. “Draco says you’re a lesbian. That must be terribly exciting.”
Finnegan scowled into his drink. “I don’t want to believe all that shite. I don’t – not in my head, I don’t. You ever just repeat something so much that even when you know it’s not true, it’s still inside you?”
“Morag Macdougal,” said Dean, shuddering. “She’s terrifying. I duelled her once in the DA. Almost lost my eyebrows.”
Before he really knew what he was doing, Harry was out of his seat and storming over. He was half considering punching him, but then Malfoy turned and saw him and his expression was so cold that Harry immediately changed tack.
Harry privately thought that another inch would have made it a belt, but he decided not to say that. Which left them all standing around in silence, until Ron elbowed Pansy, who elbowed him back. The two had a very intense conversation that seemed to involve mostly eyebrows, winks (Ron’s) and scowls (all Pansy’s) until finally she sighed.
Draco slung an arm around his shoulders. “We’re in the same boat, you and me. Horrible fuckers, both of them. We’re better than that.”
Harry took the hand that was offered him, and stood up. Draco was only a few inches away, and it was a weird rerun of earlier – as if all the crazy stuff that had happened in between had meant nothing, it was just a sideshow that they had to get out of the way before they could get back to this moment.
It wasn’t hard to figure out what was causing it. It was hard to figure out what wasn’t, actually. All the people in his life who he loved where so very fucked. Well, Hagrid was probably fine. Though come to think of it, Harry hadn’t heard from him in a while. God, maybe the curse had got him too.
He’d bared his teeth. “Just talk? Bit rich from the girl who’s been bitching at Ron Weasley as foreplay for three years.”
Seamus was laughing again. “I wish. Oh I wish it was. It’s funny, really. The least funny hilarious thing in the entire world.”
“Wouldn’t miss it.” She straightened her skirt. “I should get going, I’ve got a lecture in twenty. Ta for the waltz, Zabini.”
to understand why she tried to give me up. I really would. Because it would be better than knowing that sometimes people are just cold, selfish
“And their hair is so long and nice. And they’re really kind, and they always get you. And they just smell so good.”
Down below them, two figures were coming up towards the flats. There was Michael, with Susan hanging from his arm. Their date must have gone well. She felt a pang for poor Blaise.
“What are you trying, then? Another notch on the Zabini bedpost? Surely after all those European princesses and pureblooded high-born bitches – “
“IfIcouldinviteMalfoy,” said Harry, all in a rush. “Seeing as we’re inviting the whole flat. It just feels a bit unfair to leave him out. And Blaise and Nott. I mean, it’s cool if not. Totally cool.”
“Shut up,” hissed Pansy, releasing him as they rounded the corner into the corridor. “All you men, why can’t you just – shut up!”
But I would like to point out that I was not on Voldemort’s side, my mother was not on Voldemort’s side and I actually left the country in seventh year because I was so very much not on Voldemort’s side. Now we’ve done the obligatory “which side where you on” dance, would you care to come and get pissed?”
Of course, the person coming out just as he went in was Malfoy. Who Harry hadn’t seen in the queue, which meant that he’d pushed his way in, the arse.
“Come here,” said Harry, and Dean hugged him, burying his face in his shoulder. “You’re going to be all right, you know?”
“Exactly,” said Draco. “It was foul. Anyway, it was – I can’t sleep, Blaise. I can’t eat. I can’t listen to music anymore. I keep on trying to go to bars and find someone else, but it’s like all men are ruined for me now.”
“Actually, I was looking for your girl there. But I see I’ve been beaten to it.” Terry gave a gracious half-bow, carried with just enough good humour to make it seem less ridiculous. “I’ll catch her some other time.”
Susan raised an eyebrow. “No. I’m going to take a piss. Do try and contain your disappointment, Blaise.”
After Blaise and Susan had disappeared into her room, and Parvati and Hermione had settled into a corner to kiss and whisper, and Theo had stormed off to his room, Harry looked around for Draco and found he’d disappeared. So had Seamus. Dean was outside, sitting in the outdoors cupboard with the door open, distinguishable only by the lit tip of his cigarette. Harry went out and sat opposite him.
“I can’t believe you two saved the world,” said Dean. “I mean, bloody well done and all that, but, you know, wow.”
“I’m nervous,” he said, running his thumb over Draco’s hole. Draco was laid out on the bed before him, hips pushed up with a pillow. Harry had opened him up with his fingers – he wasn’t quite ready to use his tongue yet, no matter how good it felt when Draco did it to him – and he thought he’d done a pretty good job if the way Draco swore in triplicate was any indication.
“When you just suspected, when it was this unspoken thing between you, it was safe. When he came out, suddenly you were worried he might try and openly acknowledge what was going on with you. And let’s not forget that once he was out, he might have the audacity to go and actually shag men rather than engaging in some Victorian love-that-dare-not-speak-it’s-name roleplay with you. And the fact that I can tell that your actions were motivated by self-preservation rather than disgust is, quite frankly, the only reason I am still prepared to talk to you, because I’ve been in a similar place. But Finnegan, love, listen to me very carefully. Your motivations do not matter. You hurt him as much as if you’d been a straight guy who did this because you were a little bit icked out by gay people. You hurt him more.”
He showered quickly, dressed himself in a nice pair of robes. It was only Sunday, but he’d been allowing his standards to slip. Padding round the flat in just his pyjamas, thinking of it all as his
“Wow,” said Draco. “Well, ok then. I really do see what you mean about love being unexpected.” His grin turned wicked. “So, want to get out of here, Potter?”
“If you’re sure you’re all right,” said Dean, but Blaise just waved him off. He made his way back to the dancefloor. He couldn’t see Seamus, but that was all right. He’d promised. He wouldn’t go back on that. He wasn’t in the part of the dancefloor he’d left him in, but maybe he’d just got pushed around by the dancers. He would be here. He had to be.
“Well, it gave me an appreciation for good table manners, and a bundle of neurosis that Blaise assures me make me charmingly unpredictable.”
Dean and Seamus went scrambling towards the cupboard, yanking it open and stopping dead when they saw the assorted huddle.
“Oh gosh, I’m so sorry!” She buried her head in her hands. She did remember, actually. He’d shaken her hand afterwards, with patches of his fringe still smoking. “You were very gracious about it.”
Malfoy’s face was stony. He took another drag of his cigarette and flicked his eyes up and down over Harry, but apparently didn’t feel the need to speak. Harry took a deep breath and tamped down the simmering anger inside him that Malfoy always seemed to bring out.
“I gotta go,” said Ron, breaking Harry’s miserable reverie. “I’ve got an essay to write for Friday. A bloody essay, Harry, in auror training. Bet George wouldn’t have made me write essays if I went to the shop.”
“No!” Hermione actually stamped her foot, something Harry had assumed people only did in films. “I need to say some things first, and you’re not going to like them, but now I want to say another bunch of things that you also won’t like – oh for god’s sake, I’ll just number them. Number one, I do not appreciate the sentiment that you know what I’m about to say, ok?”
Harry’s face crumpled. “I don’t know. What if he wants to talk about how it’s all been a horrible mistake? What if he starts talking about dating someone else?”
“Speaking of Slytherins,” said Draco smoothly, “where are Blaise and Susan? And, well, everyone else? I do love your London flat, Parvati, but we’re going to need more than the six of us to fill it.”
“But you,” said Blaise, stepping forward. “You are real. I tried to hide from it for so long. I wrapped it up in jokes and tried to sell you my cheap charm. And you wouldn’t take it. You made it clear that nothing except the entirety of myself would be enough. And I still tried to cheat you, tonight. I hoped that wish a little glitz and glamour and flowers I could sway you. I should have known.”
“What?” he’d said, when Hermione looked outraged. “I’ve already died twice. I’m probably unkillable at this point.”
He looked at Neville. It was still a shock, to see how handsome he was now. Always there’d be that afterimage of little chubby Neville with a badly-tuned wand, trying to hold back tears. He wondered if it grated on him.
Theo still looked suspicious, but he gave them a nod and went on his way. Harry waited until he was out of earshot before looking back at Malfoy.
“If we went by her count the family reputation would have more lives than a kneazle. It’s kind of nice to be the son that isn’t fucking up for once. Anyway – George, nightclub. Will you come? It would mean a lot to him.”
“Oi,” said Harry. When the two of them started, they could go on for a while. “Hermione, bastion of knowledge and best friend in the world, you wouldn’t happen to know who’s in our flat, do you?”
“I cannot believe I’m missing that,” said Draco mournfully. “God, shall we start sending him obnoxious patronises? ‘Blaise, come quickly, the strippers that you suggested demand to be paid in illegal potions’? ‘Blaise, I’m having a bondage disaster and only you know how to untie me right’?”
Blaise waved a hand. “Oh, I’m pretty sure she put down the last wizard she was married to on the birth certificate. But she told me the truth, and even the most cursory glance over by the Ministry would have revealed it. My official father died ten months before I was born, and even if you wanted to argue I was overdue, he was one-hundred-and-fifty-three at the time. No, my father was an Irish muggle called Phil who was in a band, and who was apparently the great love of my mother’s life for about two months.”
Blaise waved a hand. “Oh no no, inner circle only. But it’s going to be dazzling! I’ll decorate, and expand the kitchen, and we can have a proper bartender – and a band, Harry, let’s have a band! Dancing is the most romantic thing in the world. It is lovemaking in clothes, as my mother always used to say.”
Screwing Potter achieved none of those things. It was interfering with his studies, if the public ever found out about it they would doubtlessly hunt him down and execute him, and while it might piss off his father he wasn’t quite prepared to do
“Fat lot of good it did either of us in the end,” she said, raising her tea-cup, and he clinked his against hers.
"No. I just know you well," she chimed in with a smile. They held each other eyes for a second before Ginny reached out and took Harry's hand. He looked down at their hands together before looking back up with a perplexed look.
And maybe that was why he kept his distance from Hermione and the other Gryffindors. They weren't his friends and could never be. He wouldn't allow it. They were his ex's friends. They all reminded him of Harry.
Harry turned. Hermione was indeed snuggled up next to Anthony, perched on an overturned Tesco trolley. Anthony was trying to put a traffic cone on her head as she giggled and batted him away. She saw Harry looking and waved at him, and he barked a “be right back” at Dean and bounded over.
“She’s a terrible auror. I’m pretty sure she just took this job so she could hinder any criminal investigations into Blaise.”
After his second orgasm of the morning – the first one had been a bit of frantic rutting against each other, the second a wickedly long blow-job that had Harry screaming – they settled back into their original positions, sides swapped.
“So go find Pansy,” said Draco. “She loves to stand on the sidelines and very conspicuously Not Do Parties. And yeah, I know she’s mad at you, but just – “
“You bought me fucking chrysanthemums! And I’m not interested in an atmosphere, I am not here for the Blaise Zabini seduction special –“
“I’m not ready to be out,” he said, his breath tickling Harry’s ear. “I mean – out-out, to the world. I know it’s kind of an open secret, but I need a little more time. Can you live with a little bit of cowardice from me?”
“That’s the problem with virtue ethics. Goodness and bravery are all very well, but who decided those were the virtues that you should measure yourself up against? Dumbledore? The Weasley’s? That bloody hat?”
“So I found out why Malfoy’s parents cut him off,” he said without preamble, interrupting another of Blaise’s stories.
“My aunt and uncle.” He took the bottle, drank deeply. “For a while when I was little, I thought that was why they hated me. Then at eleven I found out about the magic and it was almost a relief, you know? Like – ok, it wasn’t about race, it was always about magic. Then I got older and realised it was about both.”
“Yep,” said Hermione, trying not to blush. “I just think I need to focus on my studies.” It was technically true.
“We thought you’d had a moment of self-actualisation,” piped in Pansy. “We were all very excited. And anyway, Greg’s wrong, not since third year.”
Draco grimaced. “Please, Pans, there was enough drama going round without you deliberately stirring any more up.”
Michael was hunched over Susan in a way that was wrong. He was whispering something in her ear, and she was shaking with bleary eyes.
“We’re sick of it,” she had hissed, blocking the way from the Slytherin boys dorm. “All you do is drop cryptic comments and then storm off. Stop the sulking and just talk.”
“Hanging out with your friends isn’t exactly an original concept, Dean,” said Hermione. “Anyway, none of them know anything about Muggle pubs, so they’ve ended up at a Weatherspoons.”
“Blowback,” snickered Morag. “I blame you for that one, Parvati. After you introduced it to Padma, everyone in Ravenclaw turned into proper pot-heads in sixth year just for an excuse to nearly make out.”
“ ‘M here,” said a very, very slurred voice, and then Seamus was stumbling towards them, being held upright by a giggling Hannah.
The assignment was to examine the pros and cons of three broad ethical theories – deontology, virtue ethics or utilitarianism – in seven hundred and fifty words. Harry had written seven –
“You do! You’ve got a crush on him and you’re having sex with him! Oh my god. Is it going to happen again?”
Dean’s face was shutting down. His expression went from triumphant to carefully neutral. “Sure,” he said, and pushed himself up, the two of them making their way out the back to the beer garden.
Parvati took a hit, turned to her left and beckoned Seamus over, doing the same to him. And then Seamus took a hit, and turned to Dean, pulling him closer by the collar. Dean’s eyes were wide, his mouth falling slack. Seamus kept his eyes open, staring straight at Dean, as he pushed his mouth closer. The smoke curled between them, gentle. And then Dean took a hit and, instead of turning towards Harry, pulled Seamus in with one hand on the small of his back. Seamus’s eyes were closed this time.
“Lovegood?” said Terry. “Sure.” He looked dubious, but he’d come around. Hermione left the coffee shop feeling like her good deed for the day had been done.
Hermione spun and pointed at him. “Exactly! You think repressing your emotions and not talking openly about stuff makes you strong, but you’re wrong. It just makes you difficult.”
“Generally a nightmare,” said Hermione. “I mean, she’s nice to me now she knows I’m not trying to steal you, but she did once try and murder me in public.”
“This is fun!” said Hermione, clutching her drink closer. She’d bought her own bottle of wine, and was keeping it in her handbag. “Isn’t this fun, Harry?”
It should have been a nice kiss. It really should have. But her lips were wet, and it reminded him of unpleasantly of Cho Chang, and it felt weirdly medicinal. He gently pushed her off.
Blaise grinned again, his expression wolfish. “Is that how it is? All right Thomas, what’s your poison? Wait, don’t tell me. I pride myself on being able to find a drink for every occasion.”
Harry considered asking questions, but decided against it. For one, Blaise looked terrifying, and for another, leaping before he looked was kind of his thing, and following very angry people who woke him up late at night for secret missions had always turned out roughly ok for him. He followed Blaise, a few steps behind him, as they stalked silently through campus and then out of the university grounds.
Overall, October was one of nicest periods of Harry’s life. Blinding orgasms every night, love in the air for all his friends, horizons expanding – what could go wrong?
“Look,” said Blaise. “I understand I’ve been a cock to you in the past, both deliberately and without realising it. But Susan, I am standing here in the rain with a bundle of horrifically tacky flowers that I had to buy at a Muggle supermarket. Does that not suggest, in any way, that I might be sincere? Reject me because I’m a terrible person, reject me because you don’t trust me, reject me because you don’t fancy me. But please, god, at least reject me. I am…” He screwed his face up, “ – I am confessing. Which I have never done before. This is not me attempting to net you for some game. This is me saying that you, Susan Bones, are full-blown fucking astonishing, and none of the things I used to do for fun are fun anymore because of you, they just feel like some sort of consolation prize because I can’t have you, and if I can’t then that’s fine, that’s your choice, but I’d really like to know because the uncertainty of hope is ripping me open.”
"You have to write a feature on why Slytherins are the best and I want you to set me up with a certain someone…" The former Slytherin's eyes sparkled as she gestured with head towards the far end of the bar. She didn't dare to same the name out loud, Ginny knew who she would be talking about.
"All I'm suggesting is that I think that I can get Malfoy and Potter to be in the same room together," explained Blaise slowly.
What else were two former Slytherins suppose to do with their inheritances but put it towards clubs and booze? Of course, they were only private investors in the clubs. But it kept them busy non of the less and gave them free excess whenever they wanted.
The Weasley family had never quite gotten over that break-up. Even though it had been ten years since then. And it had been mutual. The Weasley's didn't see it like that, especially Molly. She knew her mother was still holding out hope that she and Harry would get back together. Or as Molly puts it-
Ginny's stomach twisted with both hot annoyance and arousal at seeing this beautiful specimen of a man looking all too pleased with himself.
"BLAISE! DARLING!" cried out Pansy a genuine grin spread across her features as she cut through the crowded bar towards one of her oldest and dearest friends.
Like any other young witch, Ginny felt the pressure from her family to settle down. Well, not all her family, just really her mother, Molly Weasley. See, Ginny had grown up in a family of boys. Being the youngest out of seven and the only girl, she thinks her brother prefer if she stayed single. They all had a bad habit of being overprotective of her in some way or form when she did have the nerve to bring a guy home to The Burrow to meet her family. Not that it had happened many times.
Pansy just rolled her eyes while Ginny and Hermione just stiffed a laugh more so at Pansy then at Luna. The two Gryffindors were us to the blonde's strange behavior. Pansy wasn't, even though the four unlikely girls had sought out each other friendship for over two years now.
Ginny glared at him for a second before tightly her head back and letting out a deep rasp of a chuckle. "Merlin! You sound like Molly Weasley!"
"I think you missed counted," observed Luna in her dream-like voice as she counted the number of shots on the tray to the number of people at the table.
No one spoke a word as Ginny and Hermione continued to silently communicate, Blaise drummed his fingers on the table impatiently waiting for his drink, Pansy huffed and looked away from the group in annoyance. Luna and Neville weren't at the table anymore. They were dancing to some old Weird Sisters song playing from the ancient jukebox in the far corner of the room.
"With Potter and Malfoy, of course," snarled Blaise at the redhead. Did he really have to explain everything to them? He thought bitterly to himself.
The sun was up high and hot against the back of Harry's neck as he finished his work for the day. He wiped the sweat from his forehead as he walked back towards the farmhouse. Although he'd been living here for two years, the house was in pretty rough shape still. Not that Harry hadn't tried to repair it. He had. He just wasn't good at that sort of magic. He, of course, could learn. He wasn't completely stupid. He just didn't have the energy to restore the house. Plus, he kinda liked the worn-out look of the place. Even though he had wards on the land, the abandoned falling- apart look of the farmhouse kept people from coming here.
"What gala?" A perplexed look came over the blond wizard's face at this. He crossed his legs and shifted slightly in his seat, his eyes peering into Blaise's. Malfoy had made it a habit to keep on top of all the latest events and charity balls. He always in attendance of them, making a generous donation in the Malfoy name.
Ginny picked up her wand from the coffee table and aimed it at the small radio in the kitchen. The small flat immediately filled with the sounds of a popular muggle pop song. She began to sing off-key to the song as her hips swayed along to the beat. The redhead preferred muggle music over wizard music. Muggle music seemed to have more variety and was way more catchy than that of the wizarding world.
Blaise just smiled and shook his head before taking a sip from his tea. He'd planned on going home with the Weasley girl but then the bet had happened and he restrained himself.
"No not really," replied Hermione through a mouthful of food. "I mean like I owled him about the gala, but I haven't heard back yet."
"It's a deal," he whispered before sticking out his free hand and holding it out for Ginny to shake.
"Aren't you going to ask me?" teased Blaise as he sat back in his seat and dabbed at the corner of his mouth with his napkin. His brown eyes danced with mischief as they locked with Malfoy's grey ones from across the table.
And it had only seemed to have gotten worse, the social anxiety over the last two years when he had decided to cut himself off from the wizarding world and people in general and escape to Wales. He still saw people, but only a select few and when he wanted too. He guessed also spending a majority of his time around owls who didn't talk back to him also didn't help with the issue. He'd managed to miss his last couple of birthdays, despite Molly Weasley's attempts of throwing him a party. But this year, she wouldn't hear of it. Apparently making it to thirty was a big deal or something? Apparently no one thought he would live this long. And he guessed they were right in thinking that. Especially since he'd been on death door more times then he liked to count.
"I'm sorry. There was a blank outside my flat," explained Luna in a dreamy voice. She blinked at Pansy and gave her a soft smile, oblivious to Pansy's anger.
Just as Hermione was finishing off her tale about a gruel experience with one of her college, Luna appeared in her usual Luna Lovegood fashion.
Draco was unimpressed with the whole thing but listened to Blaise's story anyways. He was a little disappointed that it had not ended with anyone getting wasted and hooking up. So very unlike the Slytherin house parties back in the day where orgies would suddenly break out.
"Do you think there's enough food?" asked a very worried looking Molly Weasley as she looked around at the cramped kitchen of the Burrow. There was not an inch of counter space that wasn't covered in some sort of dish or plate of food. All of Harry's favourites.
"Since…"Hermione's voice trailed off. She thought everyone knew what had happened between the two former enemies they had last been in the same room together, two years ago. She looked around the table in hopes the other would step in and help her out. She forgot that Pansy hadn't been at the 10th Anniversary of the end of the war two years ago at Hogwarts.
"Neville mentioned that he went to visit you," explained Ginny slowly not wanting to appear nosey. Neville was a bit of an awkward topic between them He was still both of their friends, but he was kinda the reason they had broken up well not the main reason. But he was the one who had kinda made Harry realize he liked guys as well as girls and wanted to explore that side of himself.
Draco took a deep sip from his drink and stared into the empty fireplace, imaging that there was a glowing fire there.
Harry scowled down at the letter, recognizing what it was immediately. It wasn't just a normal letter from Hermione. It was an invitation to one of her charity galas. He looked down at the neat cursive of his name on the front of the envelope for a second longer before discarding it on the kitchen island.
Luna and Ginny began to chat away about something, while Hermione continued to kick herself for not remembering her friend's birthday. She made it a point to remember all her oldest and dearest friend's birthday, especially those who had fought in the war. She blamed it on the ridiculously amount of work she had to deal with this week and the alcohol of course. She would surely make it up to Neville tomorrow by sending him a cake from her favorite bakery. Yes, that's what she would do first thing in the morning. She made a mental note to herself as she drank the remainder of her butterbeer.
Blaise just laughed at the other man's reaction. Draco looked up at Blaise darkly before pushing back his chair and rising to greet his friend properly. The two friends hugged before pressing their cheeks together.
Another hour passed before the four friends were leaving the rowdy muggle bar and headed towards the beloved old Leaky Cauldron. Pansy had made some excuse saying she was craving for a butterbeer, when in reality it was there she'd told Blaise they were meeting. She knew it was sneaky of her, but she was a Slytherin after all. Ginny, she knew would be pissed at her at first, but would thank her in the end.
After ordering in Thai food and finishing off their first glasses of wine, the conversation soon turned to important matters. The two friends had already discussed their days and workweek.
Both Blaise and Pansy raised an eyebrow in interest on what that was all about, but Ginny ignored them and pressed on about the bet.
"Cheers!" they both spoke as they clinked the necks of their beer bottles together before taking a drink.
?" He knew that Ginny was just as bad as him when it came down to relationships. They both hadn't dated anyone seriously in a while. They were both enjoying sleeping around too much to settle down really.
"I don't know mate!" commented Ron with a slight shrug as he came to stand beside Harry and twisted off the cap of his own muggle beer.
Harry looked up at this and gave her a look. No one really knew about him and Malfoy or so he'd thought. Yes, he assumed his friends suspected something had been going on between them, but they hadn't exactly announced it to the world. It had been a secret. The only people who really knew were Ron and Hermione. And he'd only told them after it had all fallen apart.
"Where's Hermione?" Harry couldn't help but ask as he twisted off the cap of a muggle beer and looked around the not yet crowded party. Even though the party had just started, Hermione wasn't one to be late. He knew it was weird for him to be asking Ron who was technically Hermione's ex on where she was. But it was an old habit. And it wasn't like Ron and Hermione weren't friends still. They'd been together way too long not to still remain somewhat friends. It would be too weird if they didn't keep in touch.
Frankly, Harry had just been tired. Tired to the bone of everyone expecting him to be this great figurehead that he just wasn't. He felt like he'd aged. In that one year of hunting Horcruxes, he had gained ten years on his life..or so it felt like. When he looked in the mirror, it told another story. He still had looked like an eighteen-year-old wizard. Hermione and Ginny had tried to convince him to go back to Hogwarts with them, but that didn't seem right either. He loved Hogwarts. It would always be his home in some way. However, after everything that had happened there, the events were too fresh in his mind that he could not un-see them. Even after all the work that had gone into repairing the castle straight after the war. Harry had helped quite a bit on it too. No instead, Harry took time for himself. To find himself some would say.
Ginny just laughed before rising to her feet and heading out of the room. She'd actually meant to stay in the room. She just liked to ruffle her brother up like that just a bit. And the easiest way to do that was to bring up her past relationship with Harry.
Neville's cheeks once again flushed a deep red at the sudden attention on him. "Yes. My. Birthday," he hissed. His eyes shifted around the table, pleading with his friends not to make a big deal of it. He didn't like to be fussed over. That's why he never really had birthday parties. He usually just spent the day with his Gran at her flat in London. They had tea and cake. It was quaint. He enjoyed it.
"Things are good," stated Harry as he threw himself onto the other bed in the room and smiled over at Ron. He couldn't really complain. He had a simple life, but it suited him well.
"Mum. I don't think Harry needs my help with finding his room," commented Ron, his mouth filled with a cookie.
"Just now. I apparated in." She answered back, not breaking apart from the hug like Ginny had earlier, Hermione buried her face into Harry's neck taking in the familiar scent of him. "I've missed you!"
"How are you?" she asked sincerely. Her brown eyes sparkling with warmth towards Harry. She felt like she hadn't gotten to really talk to him all night.
"Okay. So you bet that they love each other and by the end of this gala night thing you think you can get them to confess this...to you...to each other," spoke Blaise slowly, trying to make sense of all this.
Hermione couldn't help but laugh at Ginny's attempt at being anything but subtle Her eyes shifted briefly over to Pansy who just shrugged and took a sip of her drink.
"You're one to talk!" teased Harry, trying to bring back the lightness of the conversation. "Don't you want a
Harry petted the back of the bird's neck as he made his way over to where he kept the owl treats. He gave one to Barney before untying the letter from his leg.
The two held each other eye for a second in an intense sexual stare before Ginny was blurting out, "Fine! I'm in!"
A few moments passed before they were all seated around the table; Blaise back in his old spot, Nevile and Pansy sitting on either side of him, Ginny was seated across from Neville, Luna to her left and Hermione on Luna's right. They were all sharing a pitcher of Butterbeer. Despite the sexual tension between Ginny and Blaise and the awkward tension between her and Neville, the conversation remained on an upbeat note. They talked about their school days before the war, their boring adult lives now, and everything in between.
Ginny made a face at this. "Are you kidding me? I look like a cow!" complained the redhead as she threw herself down beside Hermione. Ginny hadn't bothered to get properly get ready. She'd just changed from a pair of ratty old sweats to a nicer pair of sweats before coming over her. Her long hair was in a high ponytail and there was no makeup on her face.
However, Harry had never been good at taking time off work. In over the two years that he'd lived on the farm, he'd been gone more than a day or two. He didn't like to leave his owls for too long. He didn't know how he would survive a week really.
After placing their orders, the two friends launched immediately into a long discussion about the business. The two old school friends owned a small firewhiskey distillery, called Jake David's. It was a play on the muggle American whiskey brand, Jack Daniel's. The distillery only made a small batch size a year. It was not available to the public for sale. It was only sold at only the most elite wizarding clubs in London. Two in which Draco and Zabini both had their hands in.
"And why would you go and do a bloody stupid thing like that?" asked Malfoy with a frown. He had nothing against Granger. They had become somewhat civil over the years, especially now that Pansy insisted on being friends with the girl. However, he knew that Granger's events always meant that there was a good possibility of running into Potter. He would simply just write Granger's charity a cheque and send her a note with his apologies of not being in attendance. It's what he had done in the past two years since that horrible night. He didn't see why this would be any different.
A blush crept into her cheeks as Harry cleared his throat and realized that the hug had gone on longer than she had anticipated. She smiled apologetically as she immediately removed herself from him.
Molly looked over at her daughter at this and sighed before giving her a soft smile. "I guess it's quite a lot." she then worried her bottom lip and looked again around the kitchen. She'd made quite a lot of food. But she always did attend to go overboard with the cooking. She just never wanted her family to starve. And that hadn't changed since they had all moved out. It had seemed to have gotten worse. She was more worried now that they weren't eating enough and that their own real proper meal was here when they came to visit.
"Say, what are you doing next Friday?" asked Blaise as he put down his tea and leaned slightly over the table.
Hermione gave the younger witch a smile before padding into the small kitchenette of her flat. Like Harry, Hermione did most things still the muggle way despite living in the wizarding world over for almost two decades now. She uncorked a bottle of red wine before pouring two glasses generously full.
Both Hermione and Ginny exchanged a look at this. They knew that Blaise had a point. Harry was a grown man and was perfectly capable of handling his affairs without the help of his best friend and his ex-girlfriend. However, the two women couldn't help themselves when it came to protecting him. Especially since that day two years ago when Harry ultimately disappeared from the wizarding world. Well not the whole wizarding world, just that of central London. He just enjoyed a more quiet isolated life now. That was all.
Hermione's eyebrows shot up in surprise at hearing the former Slytherin's name. However, she didn't latch out as Ginny had. Hermione was past all that childish house rivalry stuff. She pursed her lips slightly but didn't say anything else as she took a long sip of her wine. She knew vaguely of Ginny's sharing smog with Blaise on New Year's Eve.
And there he sodding was Blaise Bloody Zabini sitting, looking as smug as ever at a table at the back of the pub his arms stretched out on the back of two chairs like he owned the fucking place.
She had a steady job as a freelance quidditch journalist. Some of her past work could be found in the Daily Prophet, Seeker Weekly, Quidditch Times, Which Broomstick?, Witch Weekly, and more. She'd a promising quidditch career playing for the Holyhead Harpies, five years prior before a nasty injury had caused her to retire early -
The shock of that one word snapped Harry out of it. He looked around, back to his table of friends – Seamus red-faced and clutching his mouth to stop the giggles, Dean looking like he’d been in a car-crash, Hermione furious, Parvati texting. Malfoy had gone pale and was staring at the floor angrily. With a little movement, he wiggled out from under Harry’s arm.
“Now there’s a twist I didn’t see coming,” said Blaise. Next to him, Ron had switched from red to white.
“If it helps, I told the guy behind the counter that I made it all up.” He had, actually. That had been a horrifically awkward conversation, and only Hermione’s frosty glare from their table had made him go through with it. He thought that might help but Malfoy just rolled his eyes and groaned.
“Blaise has no taste, Theo tolerates me only through prolonged exposure, and I have dirt on Pansy. Everyone else in Slytherin liked me because my father was powerful. Now I’m – I’m nothing.” He sighed. “But if you’re serious – thank you, Potter. I insist on getting the round of shots though. That was my stupid idea.”
“Fair enough. But – but yes, it was good. Very good. I didn’t know I could come that much – stop making that face, Harry, you did ask.”
“To be fair, I wanted to kill Ron for most of the last seven years.” It was only a half-truth, but it was worth it for the way Parvati laughed. They fell silent for a few minutes, and then Hermione looped her fingers around Parvati’s wrist.
If she were a better, stronger person she would have pulled away. But she didn’t. She couldn’t. The dancefloor was shitty and tiny and far too light for her to feel comfortable dancing, but she did it anyway. Let herself be wrapped up in Parvati, hands skimming each other’s hips. Let their legs tangle together. When she looked up, Anthony’s eyes were on her.
“I don’t. I was disapproving. But you’re all right now. I missed you. You’re – “ He waved his hands around, trying to encompass the whole university. “You’re part of this. What did you mean,
“Stupid name. They will live terrible, boring lives. And we will be glorious, and brilliant and great.” He grabbed the bottle, drank from it and lifted it to Harry. “A toast to us. Bisexual and biracial and undesirable and alive.”
“Don’t let it get you down,” said Ron, elbowing him. “Anyway, now that Ginny’s off the table, is there anyone there who catches your fancy? I know Susan’s not exactly wank bank material, but Hannah’s quite fit, and Parvati – well.”
“Anthony Goldstein?” said Pansy. “You jammy bitch. He was at the same schul as me. Honestly, the summer he filled out I nearly went into palpitations.”
He reached for Draco as Draco reached for him, and they collided in a mess of teeth and lips and rain. And possibly tears – Draco was snuffling against his mouth. His fingers were clawing raggedly at Harry’s sides. It was so much worse than their kiss before, and so much better. Harry felt rabid, unhinged. Draco bucked like a wild thing beneath his hands.
“It’s always a pleasure to be beaten by an accomplished opponent.” He smiled, and shifted her books. “Sorry, I should let you get on with studying. Knock on my door if you want to grab a drink, yeah?”
“It does?” said Pansy. “I thought you wanted to talk to me about that very private thing, you know –“
Harry considered. Considered whether it was actually a come-on, or he was just drunk and projecting.
“She’s having a really tough time of it. We have to do self-defence classes, and unless I’m paired with her they don’t hold back. She’s coming out of them way more hurt than she should be.”
“Steady on. Look, you were pretty good to me when I was ostracized, and you had no bloody reason to, so I’m going to give you advice even though I think you’re being a wanker again. You should just talk to Harry. You miss him, you miss everyone, just say whatever will get you through this weirdness and go back to being everyone’s friend.”
Parvati gave her a stern look, and disappeared, re-appearing a moment later with three bottles of gin and a case of tonic water levitated behind her.
“Right,” said Pansy, and the atmosphere dropped around five thousand degrees. “That’s quite a change for you, isn’t it?”
“Virtue ethics determines an action’s rightness or wrongness depending on whether or not it aligns with a particular set of virtues,” she said, ignoring him completely.
She looked up at Parvati and had about ten different realisations at once. She could kiss her, right now, and it would be wonderful. Parvati’s lips would taste of bubblegum and smell of cherries, and her breath would be sweet from cocktails and bitter from vodka. Her hands – those careful, delicate hands that smoothed Hermione’s hair and brushed colour across her eyelids – would wrap themselves around her. They’d feel so good inside her. Parvati might put her mouth between her legs and smear that purple lipstick across her cunt. She wanted it, just as fiercely as she’d wanted Anthony and Ron. Wanted it more. Except –
Susan was wobbling as she walked. No – not walked. She was being dragged by Michael, and that arm around her was looking more like a choke hold.
They bought a bottle of vodka and a bottle of coke, mixing them in the bottle and sharing it in long swigs. Harry bought a packet of cigarettes too – he’d quite liked smoking while drunk, which seemed a little dangerous, but they felt thematically appropriate. The walk home was about an hour, but it took them through some of the prettiest parts of Windsor Great Park, and it gave Dean time to get a proper buzz.
It was his own room, for the first time in his life. His own room, where he could retreat to and be himself when he needed to, with no Dursleys bursting in and none of Neville’s magical plants spilling over the windowsill and trying to eat him and no faint smell of burnt Seamus and none of Dean’s drawing spread up on the wall and no Ron –
“It’s all right,” said Terry, standing and taking her arm. “I’ll walk you to her room.” He guided her out gently. He was all right, Terry. Strange and old-fashioned, but with that came ideas about being a gentleman. It would be quite nice is Hermione picked him.
“Ok,” said Harry, after Malfoy had rattled off the orders. “I know what I’m about to say is going to make you hate me. Hate me even more. But let me get this round.”
After midnight, after Parvati had kissed her breathless as the fireworks burst around her and above her and inside her, Hermione tapped Harry and Ron on the shoulders and led them outside to the balcony.
Somehow during various people going to the Loo, Ginny found herself seated beside Blaise. She tried her best to ignore the close proximity to his body as she rested her chin in her hand and tried to pay attention to what Hermione was talking about. Blaise had his arm casually draped over the back of her chair. She could practically feel the heat of his body against the back of her neck, but she ignored it.
At that time, he thought he would be married to Ginny by thirty and have two or three kids of his own to take care of. Ron and Hermione too. And he had almost had that life too. But he had gone down an unexpected path instead. He used to feel guilty about it. Thinking he had somehow lead Ginny on, but she'd reassured him that he hadn't. They just weren't meant to be that was all. It still hurt Harry to hear that but he'd long ago expected that the redhead was right.
Despite going out the night previously, Ginny and Hermione agree to meet up for dinner. Ginny felt guilty over how she and Hermione had ended things that night. She knew that Hermione was upset that she had made that bet with Blaise and Pansy and she wanted to make things right.
Ginny laughed at her mum's pinched face at this. "Mum! There's enough food here to feed all of Hogwarts for a year!"
"Who are we waiting for?" asked the Gryffindor as she took a sip of her wine and glanced over to the empty seat beside her. She'd received the same owl that Ginny had received earlier. Pansy was always vague about who was invited out for drinks. It was usually the same crowd but sometime like tonight she liked to mix it up and throw someone randomly in like Blaise.
"Well, it was a rather interesting night," continued to explain the dark-skin wizard, ignoring what Malfoy had just said. He didn't really care if the blond wanted to hear about it or not, he was going to tell him anyway.
"Don't worry! Harry will love it all!" Ginny smiled at her mum warmly before placing a soft hand on her shoulder. Growing up, she'd hated all her mum's fussing and doting she'd done but now she found it sweet and missed it slightly. She knew she was lucky to have a mum like Molly Weasley.
Now I know what you might be thinking why would a former Gryffindor be socializing with a Slytherin? Pansy had become one of Ginny's close friends when she had started writing for Witch Weekly, who at the time was also a writer there. Pansy now, however, was the acting editor of the magazine.
He dried his face roughly with a face cloth before walking out of the bathroom and headed downstairs to the kitchen. Harry's hard-on was gone now as he busied himself with making a cup of tea. He didn't bother to use magic as he took the fire red kettle and filled it was water from the sink. As he set the kettle on the stove to boil, his eyes fell onto the invitation for the gala. He'd read it twice already but he couldn't help but read it over again. Not that there was much to it. It looked like all those other invitations to the numerous charity events he was invited too over the years.
However, none of his friends seemed to care as they began to pound on the surface of the table loudly, all looking at him as they chanted- "
A blanket of silence fell over them for a moment or two longer before Ginny found herself asking what she most wanted to ask.
"I hope you know what you're having," said Draco sharply before greeting the waitress. "Hello there!"
"Wales?" echoed Ginny. "Did you see Harry?" Despite the years that had passed, she couldn't help but ask about her ex. She was still very much her friend. They'd been through a lot together, stuff that people didn't know about.
Hermione blushed and looked down at her feet before looking up again and smiling at Ron and stepping into his embrace.
"Come on Ronald!" spoke Harry as he lifted his rucksack off of the floor and swung it over his shoulder.
Ginny furrowed her eyebrows together at this question. There were two other Malfoys she knew in fact, however, both had died so it seemed pointless to bring them up now. She knew that the beautiful dark skin man beside her wasn't really looking for an answer to his question.
"Nothin'," replied Ginny a little too quickly. She gave Heriomone a tight smile before throwing daggers at Pansy who was innocently sipping her own drink, oblivious or pretending to be of Ginny look. Pansy was the only person who knew about Ginny's said crush on the wizard and she wanted it to stay like that. Not that she didn't trust Hermione, she did. It was just that Hermione might let it slip to her brother, and she didn't want to have to deal with him. Despite everyone else having the sense to grown up and move on from former house rivalries, Ron was a little slow on the matter.
He then busied himself with taking the kettle off of the burner and preparing the french press. Although Harry was accustomed to using wandless magic for pretty much everything, he still found comfort and joy in doing things the old-fashion muggle way, e.g. making coffee. Harry had tried other coffee machines and gadgets over the years, but his favourite way was with a french press. He began to hum to himself as he put two tablespoons worth of coffee into the bottom of the press before filling it with water. He gave it a quick stir making sure all the coffee grinds were mixed in properly before putting the plunger on and waiting another four minutes.
"I don't. But if I tell him about the bet, he most likely won't show up for the gala. I would kinda like to see him." Ever since Harry had moved away, Hermione didn't get to see her best friend a whole lot. Of course, she still saw him at Christmas or at his yearly charity event he chose to go too and they firecalled at least monthly. But it wasn't the same. When he'd still be living in London the two of them would hang out nightly. Especially when Ron was still in the picture. Hermione didn't go to the Burrow anymore where Harry went mostly when in town.
Harry didn't say anything as he continued to look down and focus on massaging Ginny's foot. He knew he had nothing to hide or be embarrassed about in front of Ginny. But he still felt guilty about what had happened all those years ago now.
Barney the owl hooted softly at Harry in greeting as he came into the room and landed on Harry's shoulder. The owl hooted again before nipping affectionately at Harry's ear. Barney now belonged to Hermione but the owl remembered his trainer well.
"New Year's. It was at Pansy's party. There were a bunch of old school mates there from all different houses. It was fun. You should've been there. You would've liked it." Ginny knew that Pansy had invited Harry, along with Ron knowing that they were not only friends of hers but of Hermione's as well. Ron had ended up working that night and Harry...Ginny wasn't sure why he hadn't gone. She knew it wasn't because he wasn't in town. He had been. He'd been at the Burrow the next day for the annual New Year's Day brunch.
"So Neville," began Hermione as she lowered her glass and looked over at the former Gryffindor. "What are you doin' here in London?"
"Harry!" cried out Ginny as she rushed to her ex and old friend. She threw her arms immediately around his neck and buried her face into his neck. She usually tried not to make a big deal of seeing him, especially around her mum who she knew was thinking about what could've been. However, she couldn't help herself now as she allowed herself to get lost in his familiar scent of sweat, cedarwood, and something spicey. Since she could remember, Harry had smelt like this. It was like he never thought to change his brand of body wash sticking with the same one since he was a teenager. Ginny knew this to be true for a fact because she'd pointed that out to him when they first had lived together and asked him about it. She'd once even gone out and bought him a different kind of body wash, which he had used to just please her but in the end, it had felt right. He no longer smelt like Harry, Her Harry.
Hermione frowned at this. She knew it was Harry's birthday. But she hadn't been aware that there was going to be a party. Harry wasn't the biggest fan of birthdays and being the centre of attention, but she knew her best friend put up with it to make Molly smile. Despite, breaking up with their daughter, Harry was still very much a part of the Weasley family. However, the same treatment had not been extended to Hermione it seemed. In the matter of a year, Hermione had gone from receiving owls weekly, sometimes daily from Molly to nothing. This hadn't really bothered Hermione, up until this point when parties were planned for her best friend without her acknowledgment. Yes, she and Ron had broken up after being together for almost eleven years if you count that brief year when they'd decided to take a break and see other people. But, Ron was still her friend and so was Harry.
The intense moment of silence was broken as the waitress returned with Blaise's drink. All three girls watched as he flirted with the waitress, giving her a generous tip before disappearing back to the bar.
"Oh." Malfoy might be a changed man, but he could care less about the rights for house-elves. There was still a number of them employed at the Manor.
Now Draco wasn't best friends with any of the Golden Trio like Pansy was. Or any former Gryffindors or Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff for that matter. However, he did make an effort to act civil and polite and almost friendly when he ran into anyone from school. And it wasn't because he thought he was better than anyone like he'd during his youth or it being a stupid pureblood thing. He was overall that bullshit he'd been fed as a child about blood and needing to keep the Malfoy lines pure and blah blah blah.
"You're really going to bet on Harry just so you can get some?" asked Hermione in disbelief that the younger woman would stump so low to get laid.
"You don't even know the rules yet," added Pansy a sudden interest in her voice. "What are we exacting betting on...that Draco and Potter will hook up or something?"
"Fuck! That's taste like acid!" he muttered as he slammed the empty glass down and whipped his mouth with the back of his hand.
Draco even owned a muggle flat just off the Thames in central London. He had grown to like muggles and their non-magical ways. Plus, it was in the muggle world, a former death eater like himself could blend into a crowd. Even though the war was twelve years ago, and some wizards and witches still thought he should be rotting away in prison. But Draco had paid the price for his past mistakes as a child. He had been on house arrest for the whole summer after the war before being forth to return to Hogwarts to finish his education. Draco was still set in his ways on some matters, but he liked to think he had changed and grown as a person over the last twelve years. He no longer cared about bloodlines and the Malfoy legacy. He did though still care about appearances though and surrounding himself with nice, expansive things.
Harry either didn't notice Ginny come into the room or didn't care as he stripped off his t-shirt and revealed a muscular and tanned torso before beginning to pull things out from his bag. He had used the same enchant spell on the rucksack that Hermione had used all those years ago on her purse during that year they had searched for Horcruxes
The redhead was so absorbed in her solo dance party that she did not hear the soft tapping at the kitchen window over the loud music and clacking of the typewriter. It wasn't until the small break in between songs that Ginny noticed the owl at her window. A broad grin spread across her features as she moved quickly towards the window and opened it. The great grey owl hooted in annoyance before flying into the flat and taking perch on the back of a kitchen chair.
"Since the anniversary, two years ago," injected Ginny, seeing the panic look in Hermione's brown eyes. The brunette mouthed thank-you to her.
He didn't know what he was going to do for a week in London and he was regretting making the promise to Hermione. But it had seemed like a good idea at the time. Hermione had fire-call him late last night after he'd responded to her owl about the party. She'd been going on and on how she missed him and wanted to spend more than a few hours with him. And he'd felt guilty about this. His decision to move out here had been a little rushed. He'd given no real warning about moving until a day before. But it had felt like the right thing to do at the time. So he'd promised to come and stay in London for the week. Luckily, Harry had an apprentice at the moment who was more than willing to look after the Owlery for the week. The apprentice's name was Jeremy and reminded Harry of a young Hagrid. So that was one last thing he had to worry about.
"Good. Ask. And maybe I will consider attending," spoke Draco. He gave Blaise a tight smile before glancing down at the time on his watch.
Ginny reached out and took a cookie from the plate in front of her watching as her brothers and their partners came into the kitchen one by one like a train, greeting Harry warmly.
"So how are things mate?" asked Ron as he closed the bedroom door behind him and took a seat on his bed.
Harry was greeted by the comforting sounds of cooing as he slid open the vast red barn door. He had turned the barn into a little Owlery. It turned out that he had a natural talent with training owls. He'd never thought that this would become his life after Hogwarts. After losing Hedwig he hadn't even wanted to look at another Owl or own one for a number of years. Shortly after moving here, he'd discovered an abandoned owl's nest that contain three eggs. Harry hadn't meant to raise the eggs. He knew nothing about what newborn owls needed. However, in his heart, he couldn't just abandon them either. So after doing some research at the local Muggle Library in town, he got the basic knowledge down. And the rest is history. He became an owl dad and ultimately an owl trainer. He trains all young owls to become post owls.
Harry held her eye for a moment before looking away and shaking his head. "No," he answered in a whispered.
Also all mistakes are my own, I don't have a beta currently so please be patient with me as I might have missed some mistakes.
Blaise turned his attention away from his tablemate, mid-conversation, and smiled broadly at the petit brunette as she approached the table. "Pans!" was all he said in a quieter but equally cheerfulness as Pansy had.
"Do you think they'll get back together properly? Or continue this dance around each other?" asked Ginny turning her attention back onto Harry.
"No, it hasn't passed. It's tomorrow. I dunno….I'm not a fan...please don't make a big deal of it…"He begged as Blaise suddenly rose from the table and headed over to the bar.
"Oh. No. What happened?" sighed Heriomone as she placed her glass of wine onto the table and slide into the booth opposite.
"Luna! How are you?" asked Hermione as she moved her purse on the bench of the booth to make room for Luna to sit.
"I don't know if I want a something, but there is a someone I want," Ginny replied after the laughter had died down between them. It was her turned to act shy as she looked off into the distance and thought about Blaise. She didn't know if she wanted a real relationship with the wizard or just some fun. But she did know that ever since that little kiss at Pansy's New Year Eve party, she hadn't been able to think about anyone other than him.
Hermione smiled at her two friends before throwing her arms around Harry in a hug. "When did you get here?" asked Harry into her ear as he hugged her back.
He still couldn't believe that after spending a portion of his life fighting evil forces that he could finally relax. Even though it had been twelve years since he'd fought Voldemort, it still took him by surprise at times. He wasn't entirely over survivor guilt.
Hermione frowned as she continued to look between the two women in front of her for a second longer before letting out a deep breath and reaching for her drink. She knew the truth would come out eventually, it always did with Ginny and Pansy.
Neville groaned as he opened eyes and looked down at the two bright green shots in front of him. This wasn't supposed to be happening. Yes, he'd agreed to meet Blaise for a drink. But he wasn't supposed to be getting drunk, especially on a Thursday night.
There was a genuine interest in her eyes as she pulled away and met his eye. Neville, who was a herbologist always seemed to be out of town, doing research and studying plants all around Great Britain and Europe.
This was not the first time he had woken up with a full-on-hard-on after dreaming about his ex. He hated after two years that his body still responded to the thought of him like this. Harry felt betrayed by his body. He didn't want to think about Draco Malfoy like this. He should be over it by now...and he was or so he thought. But it was the quiet moments like this at night when he was alone in his bedroom, with his guards down that memories and old feelings came floating back.
Harry could feel his heart racing but he ignored it as he pushed his way into the small adjourning bathroom and flicked on the light. He stared at his reflection for a moment in the round mirror above the vanity before pushing his glasses off and splashing cold water on his face.
"I see your date finally chose to show up," teased the waitress towards Draco. She looked briefly over at Blaise who flashed his perfect movie-star smile at her.
Barney gave another hoot before taking off yet again. Harry would send Hermione a reply later, even though he knew there was no point.
Harry shook his head violently from side to side as if to erase these old bitter feelings away. There was no point in dwelling about the past and what had been done to him. It was just that, in the past. So much had happened since the war. So much had changed. And he had moved on. But sometimes, in the quiet moments like these, old feelings crept back in, like a thin veil over the eyes, blinding him.
Ron murmured something again but Harry couldn't make it out as they left the kitchen and climbed up the old twisted staircase to Ron's old bedroom at the top of the house. Despite being grown men, the two old friends still shared a room when at the Burrow. Even when Ron and Hermione had been together. Molly wouldn't let any of her children share a room with their partners unless they were married. So that really only really allowed Bill and Percy. They were the only two Weasley children married at the moment.
There were still a few hours to go before he was due to Portkey over to the Burrow. He wasn't looking forward to it. He loved the Weasley's and always enjoyed his time with him. They were his family. However, Harry wasn't looking forward to the big fuss that he knew they would all make about it being his birthday, his 30th too! Harry felt a wave of anxiety just thinking back to the mayhem that had been Ron's back in March.
"Lovegood! What took you so fuckin' long? I said 8!" complained a slightly tipsy Pansy, flashing her right wrist at Luna, where her watch was. It was now quarter to nine, Luna was almost an hour later and Pansy was already three drinks in. Ginny was on her second and Herimones was still nursing her first.
A little noise escaped from Hermione's open mouth before she closed it and looked away from Ginny. She crossed her arms over her chest and didn't dare to look at the redhead for the rest of the night. She knew that Ginny had spoken the truth. She did use Ron as more of a boy toy than anything else nowadays. The two former Gryffindors hadn't been a proper couple in over a year or so. Despite breaking up, they always seemed to end up back in bed with each other. No matter how many times they said it would be the last time. It was like Ron had some sort of magnetic pull on her.
"No. But I can ask." Blaise knew this was a lie. And that Draco would most likely kill him once the truth came out but it would be worth it, he thought as he thought suddenly of Ginny in his bed. Plus, Draco had been mopping around these last two years. It was time that the two former lovers were in the same room together.
"Yes, he is," admitted Harry with a small smile. He hadn't seen the wizard in a year or so, not since that one time he'd come out of a club that he and Neville had been going in to.
Harry was due to attend his yearly charity gala. He had already missed two fo them this year. He knew that Hermione wouldn't allow him to miss a third one.
The two friends then began to chat away about a Quidditch match from a few days ago until there came a soft knock on the door.
Draco Malfoy skimmed the muggle newspaper with amusement for a second longer before loudly shutting the paper closed and throwing it carelessly onto the empty table beside him. He glanced down at his watch before beginning to drum his long fingers impatiently against the edge of the table.
The rhythmic clickety-clack sound of her charmed self-operating typewriter filled the space as it typed away her latest article. Some writers still liked to use parchment and quill to write their articles while others used a muggle invention called the computer. Ginny was the rare one, who chose to use a typewriter for her writing. She found her hand cramped easily with using quill and computers were just too foreign for her, even after a long-winded lesson from her muggle-born friend, Hermione.
He hated how he was thinking about Harry and he knew it wasn't just because of the date. He'd been thinking about the wizard since yesterday when Hermione's owl had come with the invitation to the gala on Friday. He knew Blaise had warned him, but it still didn't take the surprise away.
There was a certain wizard on his mind. He always thought about Harry on this day. It was practically embedded in his mind now that July 31st was Harry Potter's birthday. He'd grown up knowing the date, years before he ever set foot in Hogwarts. The papers always made sure to print some sort of story on The Potters' boy back in the day when they were all wondering where he was. And since the war, July 31st had been made into Harry Potter Day. It wasn't an official holiday but the prophet made it out to be. Despite other events or news on the day, Harry's picture and name always made it to the front of the page every year. And this year would be no different. Probably worse, thought Draco to himself. Harry was thirty. They were all thirty this year, he thought.
“You look nice,” said Seamus, swaying a little. He’d wrapped both arms around Dean’s waist, pulling him in closer. It was almost like they were slow-dancing. Seamus’s eyes were blue-green and wild. “You always look nice. You pulling any girls tonight? Or boys? Don’t pull Blaise, though.”
Hermione had survived her first real heartbreak, hadn’t she? And it wasn’t a heartbreak, it was just – the best sex of his life, and an unexpected friendship, and then both of those things had just stopped. At least he had the friendship back.
because I ran into him last night, and it’s very clear that it’s not something he wants to hear yet.”
“Potter, the choice of drink was a dig at your obvious unsophistication, stop enjoying it. Pansy – “
“Don’t you bring up the Hannah thing like you were so cool and understanding, you were furious about that.”
Why was Draco always making him feel confusing things? And why was it always when he was in the queue for the loo? You shouldn’t have big emotional realisations when you needed a piss. Or to throw up. A man could only deal with so many things at once.
“So you were trying to be nice?” said Morag. “You should tell her that. Immediately following a heavy and grovelling apology, of course.”
“Like, embarrassingly,” said Padma. “She wouldn’t shut the fuck up about you when she came home for Diwali.”
“I think half the Ravenclaw boys are. Michael Corner tried to invite her to some poetry thing tonight, and Terry Boot wanted to have breakfast with her this morning.”
Harry smiled. “I’m sorry about all the times I was blatantly Dumbledore’s favourite. I know that must have pissed you off, trying so hard to win the house cup. God, it seems like forever ago that that actually mattered, right? I’m sorry about that time in the Forbidden Forest, in first year. I’m not sure
Harry had shot him a look over Granger’s head, fond and amused, and Draco had smiled back as if they were the kind of people who did that, stood together and laughed at the rest of the world.
“Look,” said Blaise, leaning over. “I’ve got a baggy of something in my pocket that might just help you relax. Why don’t we head outside, have a little and then send Potter home while we scout for some more receptive beauties?”
Blaise laughed. “Duly noted. I just – I couldn’t have done it alone, Harry. Thank you. I’ve never been brave. Never. I don’t even know how I got the courage to do that back there. It’s just – Susan.”
Susan was on a date with Michael right now, which meant Blaise’s sighs were 20% more despondent. Harry had started to work out a system for them.
“I’m so sorry,” said Hermione. She was pretty sure she was near crying, but in a nice way, a cathartic way that came from just loving everyone so much. “You’re so nice, and so brave, and I was really mean about all the things you believed.”
Goyle eyed him thoughtfully. “Yeah. You always did strike me as a screamer, Draco. Not – not that I ever thought about it. No offence. I like birds.”
It was getting dark, but the warming charms were keeping them all toasty. She leant back into Anthony’s hands and saw Theo doing the same, settling against the opposite shoulder.
Blaise stammered. “I just – I didn’t believe in fairy-tales. I thought the world was all nuance and manipulation. My entire life, I’ve ducked away from anything real. All I am is artifice and charm, and I thought that was enough.”
“Boys!” Blaise burst into the room. “And Granger. Hallo, did you know that I’m Harry approved and definitely non-evil now?”
Dean relaxed. “No, I – I needed to say that to him myself. I didn’t know he thought like that, you know? Especially since – “ He stopped. “Do you think like that, Harry? It’s not actually Malfoy being gay that’s bothering you, is it?”
Neville shrugged. “Sometimes nice is enough. But then in South America - I dunno. When you’re out there with just the plants and the animals it’s really freeing. Sometimes I’d stand in the jungle and just start screaming.”
as he tugged on his balls. He’d go out with Blaise and start chatting to some extremely handsome stranger, and suddenly they’d tug on their hair and he’d think
“What’s wrong with how you’re acting? Mostly it seems to just involve a lot of staring and occasionally sighing.”
Harry grabbed the bottle, drank, raised his fists to the sky. “Bisexual and biracial and undesirable and alive!”
“I want you so much,” said Seamus, staring him down. He was poised on the balls of his toes, arms outspread like he was commanding the rain. He looked like a dare. He looked like a broken man. “I want you so much that it’s almost killing me. And I have tried to destroy it but I can’t. Because – here’s something fun for you, Dean – my mum wouldn’t just feel uncomfortable, and make award jokes about me being gay, or stumble over the word partner. My mum would never, ever talk to me again. My dad neither. I would be dead to them. I’m not bi, Dean. I’m not, so I can’t just hope to end up with a woman. Do you know how absolutely blitzed I had to get to shag Hannah? But I can’t be gay, because then I’d just be broken. So I’m nothing, Dean, I’m nothing except this great big pile of hatred and want.”
Blaise sat down, heavily. “People… I wasn’t trying to… I mean…” He put his head in his hands. “Oh, fuck. I just… I’m just used to people liking it when I talk like that.”
The alcohol and the music and the general air of bonhomie worked to reduce Harry’s mood, but he couldn’t quite shake the Malfoy incident, so he waited till Susan had gone to get a new drink and Dean and Morag were distracted by arguing over the music – Dean wanted to put on Mariah Carey’s latest, Morag was championing something called
“That’s funny. I don’t really remember us being friends. I don’t think I like you very much, actually.”
“Well, you should still apologise. Go hang around one of those Ravenclaw boys. Go hang around Thomas to make him stop looking like a wet blanket. Or, you know, hang around with me. Your oldest friend, guy who actually wanted to have fun with you this evening?”
“Yeah. Can’t say I’m surprised – he always did like to party. Mum is furious, of course. Thinks this is going to be the death of our family reputation.”
“Hermione,” said Anthony. He was looking at her again, cool yet friendly. “What an unexpected delight this is.”
“I just meant – “ Hermione’s face was hot. “I just meant that me and you, single girls, it’s fun. If I was actually dating one of them he’d always be around, hanging on, and we wouldn’t be able to go out and flirt with random guys anymore. I’d be there on the side lines, worrying about having a boyfriend and probably having to text him every five minutes.”
Not that things had been stellar in eighth year, even with Ron there. Harry had felt like he was limping through school, trying to work out what he wanted to do with his life, standing on the edges of Ron and Hermione’s drama.
“Why do you always have to make things so difficult?” Harry shouted, and Draco cackled with his head thrown back.
“Draco. Darling. When you first began this absolute skull-fuckery, you promised me that it was just sex.”
“That’s not why people liked you,” said Harry. “Blaise still likes you now, doesn’t he? And Theo. And Pansy is still your friend, presumably.”
It wasn’t even that Draco was handsome – he’d known that for ages. He’d probably known that since he was about twelve years old and noticed that Pansy Parkinson wouldn’t let go of him. It was that Draco was ridiculous. Possibly actually bonkers. It was that he would run himself ragged trying to give his friend a happy ending. It was – and this could not be over stated – because he wasn’t a fucking terrorist anymore, and therefore just Draco.
It was the day after the Yule Ball when everyone had gone back to not looking twice at her. It was –
“The only reason I am not breaking your nose right now is because you’re my friend,” said Anthony. “And because I want to believe that you’ll regret this. Leave. Now.”
“It’s because I’d forgotten how to be a good friend,” said Harry. He was looking very earnest. Hysterical laughter would probably not be an appropriate response.
and he still missed him. Not even the sex – well, no, he missed the sex but that wasn’t it. He missed Draco’s mean comments about his hair. He missed Draco’s histrionics, the way he turned his feelings into an unbelievable drama to try and undercut their sincerity. He missed laughing with him about something, and then turning his face towards Draco’s and catching them with the same look in their eyes –
“Yes, but that was the terrifying loneliness, not anything to do with me. And tonight I’m all made-up and wearing some glorious dress from Padma that I’ve probably ruined. Of course someone might want me tonight. But she – she looks this good every day. Her hair is like actual silk. She doesn’t wear eyeliner, you know. Her eyes just look like that.”
Pansy and Greengrass whooped and cheered. Theo groaned and put his head in his hands. Fuck it, Harry thought, and joined in on the cheering.
“It’s like, what, I’m not allowed to mention it?” he said over drinks at the London Stone. Everyone was there except Draco (ignoring Harry), Seamus (shunned forever) and Theo (responded to all invitations with a blank look until the inviting party left). “Sure, get mad at everyone who ever mentions your past. Let’s see how well that goes for you in life.”
me, the way I’m planning to ignore you. The way I was planning to ignore you last night, until you came up to me and decided to remind me that I was a shit-for-brains Slytherin who didn’t deserve a thing in this world. You
“She thinks we’re in competition,” said Hermione airily. She wiped her eyes. “She doesn’t know she’s welcome to whatever she wants.”
Harry tipped his head down and groaned. “I think we had the least friendly sex it is possible to have.”
“I was just looking for the loo,” said Harry. Since when had Seamus called him Potter? Not since fifth year, when –
“I’m guessing I… shouldn’t have? I’m sorry. But Ron gave me one of the promotional leaflets, so it looks like it will be classy rather than tacky. And I’ve never been clubbing before, I think it could be really exciting. So say you’ll come? Please?”
“So, Malfoy,” he said, and Blaise sighed. Harry refused to be put off by this. “Is he going to be coming over a lot?”
“Here,” said a calm and familiar voice, and then there was a cleaning charm slashing through his mouth. He wriggled his tongue, feeling minty fresh.
“I’m down. What time is it? I probably won’t have worked off this hangover by then, so who cares if I get a new one?”
Nott did come, which slightly freaked Harry out, thinking about what he might have seen last Sunday morning. Not that there had been anything to see, because nothing had happened.
“Great. I just need to go talk to Charlie about moving to Romania,” said Ron, and ran out of the pub.
“Perhaps you can show me,” said Daphne, stepping closer and – was her hair twinkling? Her hair was definitely twinkling. This was such a bad idea.
“Harry,” said Blaise, cornering him outside the library with Susan appearing at his other side. “Me and Bones have decided to do something about your crushing loneliness.”
“So – “ He felt like he’d just been struck with a large battleaxe. “So none of you hate me for my shameful Gryffindor fling?”
Parvati smiled into her drink. It was a reflex smile – the kind you did so that your face didn’t do anything else. “Well. We were probably more like – I don’t know.”
He fled upstairs, looking ruffled (ruffled for him just meant that his walk was 10% less smooth, of course). Morag raised her eyebrows.
Harry looked between the smile, the finger, and the bit of page it had landed on seemingly at random.
“Did I take a strange powder a muggle offered me in a grimy bathroom? No, Potter. Do you know how they take this horrible stuff? They roll up a bank-note and inhale it into their nose, and then they pass the bank-note on for someone else to shove up their nose. I thought I was going to be sick.”
“Well, I suppose we’ll just have to make the best of a bad situation,” said Hermione, flipping a pancake with far more force than necessary. “I certainly plan to. I have many, many plans for this party.”
But he didn’t want to be easy with Draco. You had to be brave, and a little bit stupid, when you were in love.
It sounded terrible, saying it like that. Ron and her had had sex. It had been nice. Good, in fact, once the first few times were out of the way. She’d wanted to have more – but that was the problem, she’d wanted to have sex with other people. Date other people. The horrible scientist part of her brain had sat up and said
“Not like that, you know. I just thought you were very cool. Should have known, really.” He took another drink. Behind his head, Anthony caught her eye and mimed rolling a joint. She shot him a surreptitious thumbs up and watched him slip into the kitchen.
“Weasley was your best friend for seven years. You’re not going to find something like that instantly.”
“Oh fuck you,” said Dean, grabbing Seamus by the bicep. “Why do you care if I do shag Harry? It’s none of your business who I fuck.”
“I’d love that,” she said, before a bright idea struck her. “Though if you have another dancing friend, perhaps we could bring Luna along? She told me everything free should dance once, so she’s probably love being thrown in the air.”
They settled into the kitchen, Blaise uncorking the champagne and pouring them glasses and keeping up a steady stream of patter that almost disguised the awkward silence coming from all three of them. Eventually there was an awkward pause, and Harry realised, seeing as everyone was staring at him, that Blaise had probably just asked him a question.
The bar was violently pink, hideously crowded and swelteringly hot in its single underground room. They were currently sharing a table with eight other people. There was a sign by the staircase that read WELL BEHAVED WOMEN DON’T MAKE HISTORY in neon letters, constantly surrounded by girls squatting for pictures in front of it.
“It’s a bit weird to find out too late,” she said. “I mean, I spent most of my teenage years thinking that no one fancied me – though I guess that’s was probably because I only really hung around with Gryffindors.”
“No,” he said, sounding a little desperate. “But I can’t tell you the reason why, and I’m trying really hard not to lie to you in this conversation, so
“We went to school together,” said Malfoy. “He was just leaving. I’m sure he has better things to do than hang around here, watching a private moment.”
“There’s one person,” she admitted, because she was drunk and stupid. “But I don’t – I can’t talk about it.”
“Or doing anything – anything at all – that isn’t talking about Malfoy, before Morag puts us all out of our misery and Kevadra’s you?”
“I still haven’t come out to him. I just don’t have the words to do it, you know? We haven’t really spoken about the things he said at the party. We each said we were drunk and apologised for being bitchy, but I think we both know it’s a topic we don’t really want to touch. Every time I try and bring it up, he just starts talking about something else. I get the impression he does know, and he doesn’t want me to say. Like he thinks he can convince me to stay in the closet for the rest of our lives so he won’t have to deal. The worst thing is that I think – I think I might actually do it, if it was for him.”
“I’m irresistible to English girls because of my atmosphere of European sophistication. Scottish girls just think I sound like a twat.”
Blaise cracked an eyelid and pushed himself up on the bed. “Are you telling me that I should try and dazzle my way into her heart, Harry?”
“That one, yes. Look, this will come as a shock to you. It came as a shock to me. It’s pretty much – well, a complete reversal of everything I’ve ever – “
“Ah yes,” said Blaise, pouring again. “A certain Hufflepuff ice queen. Another!” And he repeated the whole show again, Michael copying, struggling and spluttering by the time he came back up.
when they fucked him in that sneering tone of voice that sent sparks right down his cock. Somebody else who sucked him harder when her curled his hands in their hair and called them
Morag reached over and ruffled his hair. “Not what I meant, but it’s refreshing to see that you’re still the same post coming-out, Harry.”
After five minutes of bitching about their various acquaintances, whether Pansy’s mother was really having a spiritual awakening or just having another affair and whether Theo and Daphne had finally called off their sham of an engagement, Pansy finally asked how Draco was.
Malfoy pulled his arm back, and Harry wondered for a wonderful second if he was actually going to punch him in the face. But instead Malfoy swung his hand down, his finger landing on top of Harry’s reading, a triumphant smile on his face.
They arrived at a dingy street corner, disturbing a couple who were very clearly about five seconds away from shagging. They scattered after a harsh look from Blaise. Harry thought about asking questions, but Blaise was tugging him along, through the alleyways and into a dark doorway that turned out to be the back entrance of a bar. A really, really dodgy bar. Not that Harry had much basis for comparison, but a place this grimy and miserable only attracted customers who valued discretion on the part of the staff above clean tables and nice beer.
“They were shits,” said Harry. “Shitty, shitty shits.” He drank again. “And they didn’t even get what they deserved. The war ended, everyone got what they deserved, except for the people who tortured me the hardest and for the longest. You know why they didn’t die? Because I protected them. Because I found them a safe place and told them to stay away. What did I get for that? Fuck all. I don’t think they even know that I survived. They certainly haven’t asked.”
“You have a very bright aura,” Luna said dreamily, skimming her arms over Greg’s shoulders. “Have you considered a career as a mind-healer? I imagine your presence would be very calming.”
Harry burst out laughing. “Oh fuck me, yeah. That weird grin he does when he’s trying to pretend he’s fine with something, and you can just see the anger twitching under the surface – “
“Cobbled it together? Draco, this is the best bit of magic I’ve ever seen!” He grabbed Draco’s hands. “You’re bloody amazing, you are.”
“Granger,” said Pansy Parkinson, wearing yet another fuck-you-dad ensemble. “I need to steal Potter here.”
“I’m applying for a job,” said Malfoy between gritted teeth, and Harry stretched his grin wider and made sure his voice carried.
“I did.” He stood up quickly – not angrily, but with finality. “The problem is that you and Granger have completely different studying styles.”
Dean was up, stalking down the hall. Harry followed him – he had a doom-y feeling building inside him, and these feelings were rarely wrong.
He snorted. “Rebuilding his life? Why the fuck does he get to do that, Hermione? After everything he did, after everything he did to you – “
“You know, Susan,” she said one night, once she’d been able to tear herself away from watching Parvati head to get more wine. “What I’m going to say might sound awfully presumptuous, but I just want to head off any potential awkwardness.”
Wonderful. Now he had nobody as his date, and the newspapers would definitely print something about his crushing loneliness. Blaise and Susan would probably give them anonymous tips, the fuckers.
Maybe he could still marry Astoria Greengrass. He could picture Potter naked in exquisite detail if he was required to seal the deal. He was penniless, true, but she hated her sister
“Morag’s a lesbian, Scottish and can hold her liquor, leaving her immune to my charm on all fronts.”
“Of course,” she said, “and you too.” She was still smiling as she closed the door behind her and threw herself into her books.
I’m sorry for there, but you were eleven and scared and I don’t think I was very nice. I’m sorry about that time me and Ron polyjuiced into Crabbe and Goyle – “
All the Muggles here are on it. It makes them near unbearable. Somebody offered it to me in the loo when I went to clear them out at the end of the night.”
You didn’t notice Dean was handsome until you did. He had these gorgeous soft eyes, and dimples so perfect that Harry couldn’t quite believe they were real.
“Sorry,” he said. “Sorry, it’s just – we’re all going to be happy now, aren’t we? I’m being such a pillock. But, you know, two years ago I was all good with dying and I wasn’t sure if either of you were still alive, and now – “
“It’s that fucking Granger,” spat Michael, and Harry would have leapt up if it hadn’t been for the warning press of Blaise’s foot against his leg. “Treats everything like a moral crusade.” He downed another glass of wine when Blaise handed it to him with considerably more ease. “All those bitches, twittering together about how awful I am. And Anthony letting Granger ride rough-shod over him, because he’s too cunt-struck to think for himself.”
The arm-holding lasted until they arrived at the street outside Eclectic and the sparkle of flash-bulbs lit up ahead of them. There was an honest-to-god red carpet next to the queue inside, and Harry had a horrible feeling he’d be expected to walk up it. Draco jumped away like he’d been burnt.
“I wasn’t mad that you were copping off with a bloke. I was mad because I thought that was the reason you split with your parents. I’d begun to think well of you, you know that? I got all excited, thinking you might have actually changed, and then you told me you hadn’t, it was just your sexuality.” He took a deep breath. “And then
“Her name was Charity, Blaise, and she seemed quite cheerful when she was making us pancakes this morning.”
“It’s going to be spectacular!” said Blaise, who grabbed Harry outside his last lecture. “The stage is set. My outfit is picked. I’ve adjusted the lights so they’ll show off my complexion at its most delectable. The music will be soft and low and romantic. I have everything – fuck, I’ve forgotten something.”
“Fine,” she said. Closed her eyes, forced herself to be calm. “Fine. Sorry. I suppose that was rather odd.”
And then suddenly it dropped on him like an anvil. “Dean, when you were talking about straight boys, were you – “
“Oh how funny you know that. Is this what all those Draco Malfoy fact-finding missions were about? You creating the perfect atmosphere for me to be overwhelmed by gratitude to you for saving me so I could fall into your bed?”
Blaise was leaning against a wall with Michael. No, that wasn’t right. He was holding Michael upright. Michael was giggling hysterically, in a way that was harsh with hysteria.
“Because telling people how you feel is important, Ron! Take this as a piece of advice for the next poor girl you date – you need to just – just – “
They stood there on the pavement, smiling like idiots, and Harry couldn’t for the life of him think what to say. He just wanted to stay there, in the late-October sunshine, looking at Draco Malfoy be happy.
“And she does so much to shock people, you know?” Ron was saying. “And she used to do it to me, too – I mean, she still does, kind of – but now when she wears microskirts and see through tops or makes a joke about the Dark Lord or whatever, she’ll give me this look like she knows I’m in on it. It makes me feel – I dunno. Like I’m smarter than I am or something.”
There was something gluing Hermione to the spot. It was rage. White hot molten fury that welded her feet to the floor in Michael’s path.
“Seamus.” Dean grabbed his shoulders. “I do. Because he’s my friend. That’s all. But stay here, ok? Please, don’t go anywhere. Please.”
There was a long silence, in which Pansy stood in the rain, a sodden stick figure in black. And then Seamus sneezed.
“Ugh.” She released Parvati and flopped back onto the bed. “You know how I don’t know how to do girl things?”
And then the second – or maybe the third, or fourth, who was counting now – domino fell. Dean pulled away, teary eyed, and the door behind them opened and Draco walked out. Harry had a brief, violent out of body experience as he saw how the whole scene looked – Dean inches from his face, and Harry holding him close, and then he watched Draco’s eyes track up, up, up, Harry following him until he saw the mistletoe above his head.
“Don’t. I don’t think this will take long. Nice and friendly, right?” he said, and his voice was so warm and open and honest she could have wept. “We’ll still be friends.”
“Fuck them,” said Dean, grabbing Harry’s shoulders. “Fuck them, Harry. Fuck everyone who said we shouldn’t be here. We are alive. That means we win. We’ve won, and they’ve lost, and they’ll be shitty and bitter about it for the rest of their lives. Those people, your family – “
“I take full credit,” said Pansy. “Do you know how hard it is to get this one to dress properly? He has a hideous collection of Muggle t-shirts that I blame you entirely for, Potter.”
“Malfoy!” He flung an arm around his shoulders, in a bad impression of drunken friendliness. “What are you doing here? Me and Malfoy went to school together,” he said to the barman. “Is he drinking you out of house and home over here?”
Harry shot him a look, considering whether to be annoyed – he’d thought he and Malfoy were over all that stuff. But there was less of an edge around Draco’s tone, and he was almost smiling. He didn’t sound like he was trying to put him down, more just suggest a general atmosphere of boredom and disdain. It was a surprisingly good look on him, actually. With his lean face and general air of dissatisfaction, he looked rather like he’d just dropped out of an Oscar Wilde novel, or the first half of Brideshead Revisited – and then Harry realised that that line of thought was actually pretty gay, and stared straight down at his pint instead.
“Seamus seems in a bit of a grump, doesn’t he?” Harry turned. He hadn’t realised that Draco was watching them too.
“No I mean – this group, they aren’t my friends. They made their own thing during university, and it’s great, it’s all about forgiveness from the war and no longer hurting and getting over differences and all that great big moral stuff. But I’m not part of it. And it’s ok for you – you can just slip right back in with Hermione and Harry. But I can’t do that. I had a – a role. As the only person on Draco’s side. And it’s gone.”
“I don’t know. If you had a secret from Ron, one that would mean he would never talk to you again – would you tell him?”
“Great,” said Harry, as Hermione muttered “Spectacular” under her breath, stealing a piece of Harry’s bacon. “What are you doing down here?”
“I wouldn’t be seen dead with any of you tossers,” said Morag, shoving her hands in her pockets and strolling off up the red carpet of doom, pausing only to flip off Rita Skeeter.
They’d lost the others, but it didn’t matter. You only needed one good friend to make a night, and Hermione had the best friend a girl could ask for. They leant against the bar, laughing when boys came up to dance with them until they walked away, confused. Terry and Anthony were there for a bit, buying them shots and dancing with each other when the girls refused to general hoots, but then they disappeared to find Luna, who was apparently also here. Luna herself appeared later, looking ethereal in a dress made of feathers, and hugged Hermione when she ended up having a long, rambling confession about how she hadn’t liked her through school.
“Yes, Michael Corner. He’s told me he wants to ask you out, and I know that sometimes there’s a patriarchal assumption that girls are territorial over men they’ve previously dated, and I just wanted you to know that I wouldn’t be like that.”
“Oh, shut up,” said Parvati. She stepped into the rain and wrapped Hermione up into a long, passionate kiss. Blaise’s mouth dropped open. Susan poked him in the ribs.
Draco made an angry little noise. “Because this was a terrible idea, Potter. We hate each other, remember?”
Harry drifted away. He considered going back to the group, but Dean was happily schooling Morag at pinball (the machine now fixed) and everyone else was getting up to dance. He didn’t really want to dance. He wanted Ron, who would have happily listened to him bitching about Malfoy and suggested a few of George’s finest to use on him. Maybe he should go home and firecall him. That sounded like a good idea.
“I just – “ She put her head in her hands. “He’s got really big shoulders. Really big shoulders, Draco. And big hands. And he should be cocky and obnoxious, with a body like that, but he isn’t – he does these little movements, sometimes, these little gestures, and they’re so gangly and awkward and sweet. And he really is brave, and good, and strong, and – well, he’s such a fucking Gryffindor, but it turns out I’m kind of into that. And when I’m mean to him, he apologises. He doesn’t just go, “oh that’s Pansy, she’s kind of a bitch”. He actually wants to work out what’s wrong, and he tries to cheer my up in these stupid hamfisted ways that actually totally work. Oh fuck, Draco. I want to have his babies. Our kids would be so ugly.”
She trailed off. Parvati was smiling at her politely, and Hermione suddenly remembered why she didn’t
“Maybe I do.” Seamus’s eyes were fierce. “Maybe I fucking do, maybe I don’t care how wrong it is – “
There was a moment where he seemed caught – the pleasant, polite mask on his face trembled. And then it fell away. His lip curled with feral hunger. His eyes darkened. Before there had been Michael, her friend, confused as to what was going on. Now she could see what was underneath, and it was hatred.
Hermione exhaled. “I didn’t run away because I saw Ron with Pansy. I ran away because Ron saw me with Parvati.”
“I’m good!” He raised the shot to his lips, but made the mistake of inhaling before he drank. Nope. Not happening. He slammed it undrunk back onto the table, taking deep breaths.
“Don’t be. It’s occurring to me that after a lifetime of being trained in the ways of social artifice, the one thing I am unprepared for is – Well. Mother would be furious if she knew how I was acting.”
There was silence for a long time. Harry watched Malfoy carefully. Watched him bring his arms in to wrap around himself and shudder, just for a second. His eyes were so lonely. Then he drew himself upright and smirked at Harry.
Parvati’s legs were against hers. There was a warm thrum in her stomach, the same as when Anthony had – oh.
Harry looked around and agreed. The flat was lovely, with a wide open-plan space that would make a perfect dancefloor and a beautiful glass wall with a view of the river, but sitting around like this with all the food and drinks laid out untouched made him feel a bit like walking through the house right before Petunia had a dinner party, with all the nice things he wasn’t allowed to touch.
“There’s always going to be an exception to that rule,” said Malfoy. “I can’t think what it is, but I just know it. Think of Umbridge.”
“Well, thank god for that,” said Susan. Her voice was flat and narrow. “Thank god the great Blaise Zabini is deigning to fancy me.”
“George is opening a nightclub,” said Ron. They’d managed to meet up on a Saturday, Ron’s auror training finally giving him a bit of room to breathe, and were camped out in The Leaky. Harry had spent so long in Muggle pubs that seeing drinks bobbing through the air had taken on a bit of novelty again. “He’s inviting most of our year to the opening, I think. Wants to make it a paparazzi event.”
“I looked at the university code of conduct. The regulations around – this kind of thing are vaguely worded enough that we could –“
“Um,” said Harry. Perhaps now his brilliant lying powers would show up. “I had to convince him that – that – uh – that he couldn’t win you back?”
The shots leant the evening an edge of unreality, and the rounds system broke down as soon as Susan got too pissed to keep track properly. A DJ started blasting top hits from a decade ago, which meant Blaise screamed “this is my
There’d been a day at the Burrow, with Molly making teasing comments about when Ron was going to ask Arthur for one of his grandmother’s rings. Arthur had leant over and clasped his wife’s hand, and Molly had leant into his touch, looking at him like he made the sun rise.
“Oh god,” said Harry, looking around at his unpacked things. “Is this about Hermione? Because, you know, break ups are hard and all that – “
“So was I,” said Blaise. “Want to know why? Because I was fifteen and wanted to win the house cup and didn’t like you, none of which makes me a terrorist.” He leant forward. “Look, I’d like it if you stopped going on at both Nott and Malfoy, but I accept that it is – inevitable that you and Malfoy will have your – thing.” Harry wondered whether he should attempt to interpret those pregnant pauses, but decided against it. “But leave Theo out of it. I’m not going to give you the full story on his deeply disturbing childhood, because it’s not mine to tell. But he never wanted to be on either side of the war, and he did his damndest not to be. The only difference between me and him is that my mother smuggled me out of the country, and his father burnt him with lye if the Carrow’s reported he hadn’t tortured enough Muggleborns.” Blaise drank again. “And the only difference between Draco and Theo, by the way, is that Theo always knew his father was a monster and Draco made the mistake of loving his. Make of that what you will.”
“Of course we do!” keened Hermione. “Because that’s all I am! Potter and Weasley and an ugly jumper!”
keep being free therapy for all these fucked up men. “Hannah liked you, didn’t she? Maybe you could ask her out?”
“So she says,” muttered Draco. “Well, the lest said about that the better. Your cock is poking me in the back, Potter.”
“Oh, it very much is. The twinkling lights and the Christmas spirit have gotten to you, and now you want a bit for old times’ sake. Don’t worry, you’ll be back to your senses by New Years.”
The last time they’d gone dancing, Hermione had trodden on his toes eight times and broken another dancer’s nose.
“Blaise is having fun,” said Hermione redundantly. Blaise Zabini could have looked like he was having fun in a hole in the ground. He certainly looked so now, surrounded by a group of people who were bellowing laughter at his stories. They were probably all fake, thought Harry bitterly. Maybe he was just too old for this kind of thing. Maybe he’d missed his chance to be the kind of person who liked getting drunk and snogging strangers. The thought was depressing, and he decided he couldn’t get through this sober.
Their block didn’t have a garden, obviously, but it did have a small tarmacked square that was accessible only through the ground floor of their building, hemmed in on two sides by them and two sides by the science block. When the pub had kicked them out last night they’d all ended up in Hermione’s flat, and Parvati had gone out there to smoke, Harry going with her.
“I’m sure you’d look devastating in yellow, Bones. Anyway, you can’t denounce a dress based just on the colour. Look at the girl leaning against the sound system. What a bloody mess. Oh, colour-wise it’s fine – “
Harry opened his mouth, remembered that telling Ron that Malfoy had sucked his dick would probably lead to Ron’s untimely death, and shut it again.
“That’s a quibble, Harry, and you know it. I’m going to have a nice, stern talk back at him. Honestly, who does he think he is? He needs to move on, Harry, else he’ll be there mooning around looking gloomy at my wedding. God, what if he objects?”
Malfoy smiled. “Granger? Have you ever heard of a Muggle called Kant? Personally I think he’s bloody inflexible, but then so is Granger. All right, I’ve helped you out enough. My teeth practically hurt with all the altruism. I’ll see you around, Potter.”
“I don’t know why we have to have the party here,” Hermione was saying when he went down to see her for breakfast. “It’s Blaise’s thing.”
“What she said,” said Hermione. “I can’t believe you, I thought I was your friend and you’re turning me into some kind of joke – “
“Because a chain of dominoes falling is an orderly event, Blaise,” she would say with an air of infinite weariness. “And it doesn’t even
“Huh? Oh, the thing you saw with Anthony? I’m just exploring. I don’t want a relationship. Parvati and I are having too much fun being single women right now.”
“Just looking for Terry,” said Michael. “I’m kind of at a loose end, you see. There’s this open mic poetry reading I want to go to tonight, and I’m trying to find someone to go with. Say, Hermione – “
“Get out before I hex you,” muttered Malfoy. Harry grinned and got out of the room, before he did any of the very odd things he wanted to do, like brush Malfoy’s hair back from his forehead, or kiss him again.
“Oh god, I’m going mad aren’t I? Madness runs in the Black family, you know. Mother always worried about me. Is that what it is, Blaise? You can tell me, you know. I can take it.”
“Make them like me more,” said Malfoy. “Do you know why I suggested that round of shots? Because I am well aware that I’m currently having to buy friendship. It’s just like second year all over again.”
“What?” Draco’s eyes were expressive things, now that he looked properly. For one thing, the rest of his face was completely calm while his eyes were very, very
“Probably? Not to mention it dramatically increases the potential for miscommunication, which is – “
just mean Potter’s persistent stalking, which he’d apparently gotten better at since Sixth Year. It also meant in Draco’s mind. His dreams were uncomfortable prickly things, Potter sitting on his cock and whispering
Michael tried to push himself up to his knees, but Blaise’s foot only pressed down. “You won’t get away with this.”
“Well, unlike certain nouveau riche horrors I could name we haven’t had to marry into half a dozen families just to gain a bit of legitimacy.”
“I don’t know what right and wrong is anymore,” he said an hour and a half later, pouring over the notes he’d managed to take in the lecture (mostly question marks and the occasional name). “I knew, Hermione. I knew and then that man broke me.”
“Yeah, well, life doesn’t always tie up the loose ends.” He flicked a ball of label out towards the Thames. “I’m going to move on. Starting now, I think.”
“A lot indeed. Seven, to be exact. And how many years has my mother spent in prison? You can chime in too if you know the answer, Corner.”
Unfortunately for Draco, love seemed to have left him in kind of a daze, so he didn’t make his escape in time when Potter dropped into the chair opposite him in the library.
“Is Thomas all right?” Harry expected some kind of sarcasm, but Draco looked like sincerely concerned. Harry sighed.
“Hmm,” said Malfoy. He was looking at Harry side-ways, like he didn’t quite trust that he was real. “I’m not sure the risks are worth the reward. I will
“Since second year, I’d say,” she said. “After the whole duelling club fiasco. Admittedly, I didn’t realise that’s what it was till fourth year – “
“Because I didn’t care!” Malfoy threw the remains of his water into the sink with a vicious flick. “You are
or they’d stretch a little and it would look like the movement Potter made after getting fucked, and he wouldn’t be able to follow through.
He resolved not to think too hard about Malfoy all night. There were fourteen of them, he wouldn’t need to interact with the git. He was just helping along his rehabilitation, that was all.  And if Blaise and Nott were invited, it would have been rude not to invite him too. Unfortunately, he seemed to be in the corner of his vision every time he turned around, chatting to Morag or whispering to Nott or scowling at one of Blaise’s jokes. Even the barman looked a little bit like him – a short version of him, who clearly thought he was too good to serve anyone drinks. Harry commented as much to Hermione.
People were rapidly careening towards that kind of too-fierce drunkenness, propelled by social awkwardness, that could only possibly end in sex or a fight. This was not a place for making friends. This was a meat market, and Harry didn’t want any meat. Well, maybe the nice tasty bacon of a date, but not the whole sausage – and now he was getting off track with his metaphors.
“I have finally conquered Potter! I have achieved my lifelong dream! I can die a happy man now. Perhaps I’ll have a commemorative plate made up, with a picture of me drowning him in  a vat of tequila – “
“Flattery will get you nowhere, Malfoy,” she said, smiling a little before she remembered who she was talking to. His face shuttered.
“I don’t know,” Harry said. Ron currently felt a bit distant from him. They’d kept on floo-calling regularly, but it was difficult now their worlds were so different. And Ron kept talking about Pansy – apparently the
why she slapped me. I normally understand. Because I’ve kissed their sister or declined to get engaged or not succeeded in adequately shocking their parents. I’m not grabby, you understand. I’m a horrific arse, but not that kind of arse. We were slow-dancing, I moved in slowly, she had plenty of time to just say ‘thanks, Blaise, but I’m not really in the mood.’ This wasn’t a rejection this was – fuck, I don’t know. A histrionic attack.” He took his whiskey, drained the glass. “I’ll try her again later. Apologise. You’re a good man, Thomas. Go back to Seamus. It looked like something fun was happening.”
“Such a shame,” said Blaise. “Well, Corner, if you promise me that you’ll disappear I suppose I’ll have to take your word as a gentleman.”
“I do every day,” he said, winking at her. She blew him a kiss. “All right, you horrific harridan. Which one’s whiskey?”
“You know something?” Pansy’s voice was bored, idle. “I almost thought you’d changed for a second. Wouldn’t that have been something, Hermione Granger actually being interesting? But no, same old same old. Potter, Weasley and a chunky sweater.”
“And then – when he asked me to come back to his room and I said that I didn’t want to have sex, he got so offended. Kept asking me why I would assume that he was after that. And then he said – he asked me if I’d never been on a date before. He said the nightcap was kind of traditional. He seemed like – he was implying I’d be rude if I didn’t go with him. And he’s just Michael, right? He’s our mate. And he was right, I’d never –“ She turned her face to the wall. “And then on the walk back, he started saying all this stuff. Asking me if I liked it when he spoke like that. I just felt like I couldn’t back out once I’d agreed. Whenever I pulled away he told me to calm down and stop being so anxious. Anyway, it wasn’t – it wasn’t a
“Sounds horrible. Have you been speaking to Granger again? That woman is an unmitigated menace, and she doesn’t have a leg to stand on. Honestly - “
“- and the fact that their ancestral forest homes are being turned into summer houses for rich pure-blood wizards is disgusting, Zabini.”
“Slytherin girls love me. And Ravenclaw girls too. I even dated Katie Bell one summer. It’s just these bloody Hufflepuffs I can’t charm.”
And then the table descended into awkward silence until Dean, hero that he was, pulled out a pack of playing cards and asked everyone if they wanted to see the brill drinking game that Blaise had taught them last night.
“I’m fine,” he said. “Honestly, I’m fine. I’m just going to – check on Dean,” he finished lamely, as Hermione was ignoring him now in favour of Anthony’s mouth.
“Worked on me,” said Draco, his voice heated. “Maybe you just need to tell him to fuck off in a really loud voice. Might shake an apology out of him.”
“It’s fun, that’s all,” she’d told Harry, when he’d mentioned Blaise’s future-fist-fight theory. “They all know it’s just fun. I think Terry actually has a point-scoring system for them. He’s taking me swing-dancing, which I’m dubious about.”
“Course. Though, just as an addendum, you don’t have to come out to your parents. I more meant, you know – “
“He told me himself. I’ve spent all this time running through the reasons they’d do that, and it’s just because he’s queer.”
“Ugh, fine.” Pansy gave a theatrical groan. “Ok, Potter, Ron says that if I don’t apologise to you I’ll feel bad on my deathbed or something so here we go – I’m terribly sorry about that whole giving you to the dark lord business. And Granger – “ her voice softened. “I really am sorry about everything I said to you. I was a little bitch, and a bigot to boot, and I was trying to tear you down to build myself up. I’m sorry.”
Draco rested his head on her shoulder. “It’s wonderful, being loved. Love to have that happen someday.”
“No, Ron,” she said sweetly. “My revenge will come when I watch you tell your mother you’re dating Pansy Parkinson.”
He held his breath. Whatever the answer was, he wouldn’t let it get him down. They’d only been officially dating for two weeks anyway. It was crazy to ask someone to move in with you that early. And if Draco said now, there’d still be time for them to build a home together after uni. One where Draco left his expensive shirts lying around because he wasn’t used to life without a house elf, and Harry cooked and Draco critiqued every forkful while gobbling it up. Where their friends would drop in and out every day through a door that was always open to them, laughing and telling stories and growing old and dull. There might be children running up and down the stairs where Sirius had been so miserable, and a fresh coat of paint in Buckbeak’s bedroom. One day Harry would take their hands and lead them to Godric’s Hollow and tell them about a war that wouldn’t matter to them, that they’d never be able to understand. He’d show them a picture of a handsome man with a cocky smile and a woman with firebright hair and tell them that they would have loved each of them very much. And he’d smile at Draco through the tears and know that they would have loved Draco too. It didn’t have to happen now, but it would, one day. He could feel it, the gravity of the future tugging at him.
“Thank you, Zabini! I mean, there’s two sides to every story, you know? No one’s interested in my side. It’s all oh, he’s a man, he must be evil.”
There was a beat, and then the corner of Draco’s mouth wobbled. He started giggling, trying to push it down with a hand over his mouth, and Harry laughed far too loudly for a library.
Seamus started laughing. It was a horrible sound, cracked and wild and crazy. He stalked over to the wall and kicked it as hard as he could. Then again, and again, and then he was driving his fists into the wall and laughing and crying and Dean was pulling him back, holding him as he thrashed wildly.
“Intelligence can be used to do bad things to,” said Harry, feeling bizarrely like he might be having
“Don’t say the word. Please. Sorry. I still have – I just don’t think I could hear it. Coming from you.”
It was harder than Harry had expected to keep a secret. For one thing, he’d never been entirely secure in his Muffling charms and for another, people suddenly seemed fascinated by his love life. Not just
