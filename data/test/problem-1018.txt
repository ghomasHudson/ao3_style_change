Who would have the bloody audacity to
With a sigh, Theo spoke. Unfortunately.
"What about Potter? " Theo inquired, gaze never wavering. "Were you planning on telling him?"
“He probably won’t ever get to hear that though,” the words hit Theo deep, but he did nothing but stare at the ground angrily.
speaking.
"Nott left Malfoy in the bathroom with the troll!" Hermione rushed to say. The adults slowly turned their heads to Theo, who had suddenly gained an interest on the floor.
He hesitated.
"What in the name of Merlin happened to the poor boy?!"
" screeched Harry. Eyes piercing as he directed his anger at Theo, who was looking at him with confused eyes. "What kind of friend are you?! How could you leave him alone with something that could crush him in less than a second?!"
"So," Harry started, "Why are you still out here? And where's D-Malfoy?"
Not noticing Theo's smirk at his retreating back
Deciding to not take any chances, Draco went up the stairs- not to his room, however. Taking one quick look back to his father who was now-
Malfoy some how drawled,
Frustrated, he dropped the-boy-in-pain's arm and began to grip his wand. That is until, a centaur came barreling in and took care of the thing. Damn.
Speaking of Potter...
After getting his laughter out the way, Draco gave a thumbs up and a wink to Potter, which smacked the blush right back in his face. Not giving himself a chance to think about it, Draco went back to his compartment to go and look for Granger. It was surprisingly easy, as the girl was still miraculously looking for the two missing boys.
Time seemed to stop.
had the chance to get a word out, Theo was immediately on her. He spat every derogatory term he could think of, never taking a breath in the middle of his sentences. Hermione did not blink or falter once, and Theo ended up being the one to go down when she punched him across the face. He went to the floor with a thud, cradling his bruised face in his hands. This somehow did not convince the boy to keep quiet. Theo started to groan on and on about “Mudbloods being scum of the Earth, and how they all act like deranged animals”. Looking away from the distressed boy, Hermione turned her brown eyes toward an indifferent Draco. She blushed when he raised an eyebrow and stuttered out, “Um.. D-Draco..?”
.” Lucius snarled to the young children. Though he was technically speaking to the both of them, he subtly directed his words to Theodore, knowing Draco wasn’t foolish enough to try anything.
"then why didn't you post on the 18th"
Draco looked up from his Charms paper, which only needed a few more paragraphs. Not even trying to cover his eyeroll at the sight of the bandage, he stared at Theo, noticing how his eyes were averted and posture slumped.
to try and take his book that he, slapped her hand, closed his book, pulled it to him, and gave her the dirtiest look known to man kind.
When Draco woke again, it was because of the shaking and light slapping from an insistent boy he
"Draco!"
Harry tried to act fast, he yanked the arm he still had a grip on, but underestimated how
. Narcissa, knowing that this wasn't normal child behavior, set him up a playdate with Theo Nott.
As in, grabbing Draco roughly and tugging him everywhere.
McGonagall knew she started aging quicker right there and then.
Draco is going to kill her.
“No...” Ginny replied cautiously.
Probably because there was a silencing charm on it, but they didn't need to know that.
Never once saying a thing.
"You were mumbling and shifting around a lot… as if you were having a nightmare- Draco you look
The sight of Harry Potter and Rot Weakly in a
Draco was, rightfully, uncertain. He had a conflicted look on his face. Stepping back, he avoided looking at Theo.
"Take it. Free me from the horror that lies inside of this box."
Ron looked eager to agree with him but Hermione’s elbow had him schooling his face features. Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and forced him to sit down.
“I... what?” Harry asked, confused.
, Harry thought with a small smirk.
defund the police, black lives matter, fuck jk rowling, and PLEASE be safe out in this cruel world
The seriousness that radiated off of him was extremely concerning, as one would usually describe him as slightly wonky but clearly a very wise man. Draco opened the box to see a black, slightly crooked wand, nestled in red velvet.
amount of sense. There’s no way he could even confront him though. After the Incident, Draco has been avoiding Potter like one would their mother-in-law. And it’s not like Potter would need to Confund Draco! Draco would do anything for him in the drop of the hat, whether he realizes that or not.
Sneering at Harry, he grabbed Draco's arm and tugged him to the Slytherin table. Well, he tried to, before Draco yanked his arm free with a sneer himself and strode to the table. Embarrassed, Theo looked at Potter with pink cheeks to see a smug expression on the Chosen Boy's face.
For someone who took a nap for literal months, Draco was
“HARRY!”
Draco thought he was going to burst a blood vessel from this annoying stubborn Gryffindor, yet Potter stood there, hip still stupidly cocked and expression smug.
Theo has never been so offended, he turned pink, glared, and spun around to leave.
“No, I wasn’t trying to attack you!” Harry pleaded, eyes desperate.
As Draco was walking back to the Slytherin common room, resenting how much he has to pack, a shadow of a person caught his eye. He turned and was met with Theo staring back at him. There was a tense silence as they stared at each other, neither knowing what to do. Draco was ready to turn away, as this awkward encounter was not helping anyone. He stopped, however, as a sudden realization came to him. He was
But Harry didn’t know of the situation that Draco was in. If he did... maybe he wouldn’t have been so disappointed.
It was lunch yet Theo still hadn't shut up about how "his" plan had failed.
H u h?
Ever since the 'incident', Harry and Co. could be seen with Draco and Theo more often.
Draco would refuse and the higher years would shrug and say "Your loss".
Draco didn't even bother to hide his eye roll.
that was keeping it closed. This resulted in no successful attempts for getting the curtain open, so they resulted to yelling through threats of suspension, owling his father, but nothing seemed to get through to him.
Both Theo and Hermione turned their heads around at the sound of running feet and heavy breathing. Ron and Harry stopped in their tracks as they saw a trembling Hermione and scowling Theo.
Draco turned to look at the kind faces of the Trio, and then into Theo's anger filled face. He looked down....
"Why don't you talk?"
His silence should have been expected, yet it only made the patrons even more worried.
He offhandedly listened to Granger’s lecture the boys most likely hadn’t gotten a word of. He decide to be a little more helpful that day and gave handy-dandy-very-readable subtitles for the long and wordy rant. Panting heavily, Hermione stuck her huge frazzled hair back into the compartment and gave a thanks to Draco.
Harry started spluttering while his face turned red, “
He went back to the manor and told Lucius he didn’t remember what happened, Lucius told him he couldn’t read the subtitles fast enough and to speak verbally to him. Draco was very much not vibing with the idea and decided he was going to cause an earthquake. He was sent to his room when he stopped, and Narcissa and Lucius were like ‘????’ And that was it 🙈
The wing was frantic, Pomfrey, McGonagall, and Malfoy Sr. crowded around his bed. All frantically waving their wands at an attempt to help to no avail. Theo was off in a corner. Shaking and whimpering as he took in the sight before him.
Draco has been dancing around this topic for ages, whether or not he should tell Nott the truth about what's going on. He's talked about it with Tom and he seems against it. Their main issue is that Nott may get a big head that he is friends with the heir and start running his mouth, which is a huge issue he wouldn't be able to escape. So, he held off saying anything. However, seeing Nott here, hands still on his and spewing those kind words… Maybe it's not such a bad idea.
Draco was in the big 3’s compartment and it was awkward as hell. He thought he should go back to Theo (🤢) but everyone (minus 💞ron💞) was like nooo, so he didn’t 🙈✨💫
However, at the same time, he knew.
"Shut up! You would never understand our friendship! Isn't that right, Draco?"
I'm so sorry for posting so late, a family emergency came up that had to be fixed for quite some time. Again, really sorry for the wait.
Draco barely suppressed an eye roll when Potter’s face shown with pride and determination. He wasn’t even half aware of what he was saying, so it’s best if he wraps it up. Draco took a step back Potter, now aware of how close he was leaning. He turned his head toward the locked door, ready to leave.
Thank Merlin he doesn’t know this is a diary.
Gray eyes burned into black as he answered each precisely.
Draco turned to Harry and stared at him for a few seconds. He eventually nodded at him, snorting at the full blown beam he got back. Draco twisted around and left with an even more dramatic flare than his fathers, striding out the bookshop with impressive grace for a twelve year old.
There’s a beat of silence.
Draco skipped classes for the rest of the day.
lmao never said i was making draco smart 💀 how do y’all feel abt the poem?? rate it for me lol 💃🏾✨ and also plz comment!! i love ur comments so much! ❤️
Potter blushed and looked away. "You seemed upset, so I beg- er- ASKED Madam Pomfrey to let me leave." There was a pause.
Unbelievable.
The professors couldn't focus on the gossip because they were too busy panicking over the fact that Snape was stuck in the hospital. Snape was supposed to help them brew the Mandrake potions required to un-petrify the students, but now since he is...
There, like an absolute mad-man, stood Draco. Wand clutched at his side to the point it looked like it'll snap and eyes bright as he took in the sight before him.
“Wha-,” Harry spluttered, smug look replaced with a distraught one, “You just told me to do what my heart wants!” He retaliated.
"Uh… Draco?" Theo hesitantly asked. Draco jumped a foot into the air, slamming the book shut and aiming a hot glare in Theo's direction.
Oh Merlin. This year was going to be hell.
He was so focused on the Mafoy Lord, he didn't even notice the fuming McGonagall until, however, she made it very hard not to.
It would never be that way again.
Draco was fed up. He wanted to go back to sleep.
"Where are you going?" Asked Theo, scrunching his nose as a nasty ass smell filled the air.
of this diary. Then what the hell was
And then there were two.
All he got was a raging migraine.
Draco was mad, extremely, but he couldn't for the life of him leave the crying child there. He walked up to Theo and nudged his shoulder softly until he was met with wet brown eyes.
Harry felt dread creeping up his heart, he should have left when he had the chance. He struggled to think of answer, (though it was right in front of him) and squirmed under Draco’s waiting gaze. “The uh- uh person! The person wanted me to do that- erm to you. Yeah. I didn’t want to- but they were basically begging me! And you know i can’t turn someone down! Haha!” He chuckled out nervously, digging himself a bigger hole. Harry could tell from Draco’s expression, that that piece of information was not welcome.
He saw sympathy.
"My name is Theodore Nott, and this is my best friend Draco Malfoy," Theo gestured in his direction, turning to beam towards him.
Draco gave a flick of his wand and the feather was in the air. People were in an outrage. Did he even say the spell!? But Flitwick was gobsmacked. Could this
Draco couldn't help thinking while rolling his eyes.
in the dungeons. What are we supposed to do?!"
Harry must have sensed his agitation and tried to quickly back pedal. “I’m sorry! You probably don’t like speaking about it much, because it was, er,  pretty traumatizing to be honest. Which you probably already know! ‘Cause it happened to you and all and you would know whether or not it was traumatizing, unless you don’t think it was! Then I’m sorry for-“
Draco jumped back with a shriek, clutching his cheek.
The first time someone had said this, the gray-eyed boy was
Oh hell no.
times, most likely still guilty over the...“incident”, as he likes to call it. It made no difference to Draco, who steadily ignored the brunet each time he came over. The summer was really, a disappointment.
"Thank you, Mr. Nott," sneered Snape before opening the door.
Draco glared at the person who dared to wake him up. Of course, it was Theo, who was shrinking back from the sheer force of his glare.
Snape was somehow twenty-times paler, and McGonagall looked like she was going to join Quirrel on the floor.
In a second Draco's eyes were on the guilty redhead. His eyes flashed, promising a painful death. Ron went pale, as if he ever knew what was going to happen to him if he were to be left alone in a room with Draco.
of them while entering a forest he didn't deserve to be in
Well, it’s not like Hogwarts would want to risk owls flying out, right?!
“The name sounds kinda familiar,” Theo said, smiling when Draco agreed. “Do you think he goes to Hogwarts?”
"Hannah Abbott!"
¹ Soooo important! Like, y'all have no idea!!!!
And with those partings words, the dwarf flew off, most likely on its way to terrorize another poor student, not even caring about how his actions traumatized Draco for life. He stood, frozen in the doorway, mouth agape and eyes bugged out. If his mother saw him he would be getting a sharp reprimand. But it was just him. Him and...
are sneaking glances at him and Draco is ready to tear someone's hair out. Unsurprisingly, Potter opens his mouth first. Draco looks at Theo with the corner of his eye. Coward.
He continued walking however, but with something
However, the only reason Draco believed it wasn't Potter, was because he knew who was behind it all. When Potter told him about the voice in the walls, Draco knew Potter was referring to the Basilisk Tom was letting loose in the pipes, but just shrugged it off when asked about it. He told Tom about Potter confiding in him, which lead to a conversation Draco was hoping to put off for longer.
All petrified and stuck in the hospital wing.
Silence. Then absolute chaos, people were screaming, crying, and Draco smelled the faint smell of piss.
"Hi, Hogwarts too?" Theo spoke these words to a nice, albeit raggedy, looking boy. He chatted about how his father was going to buy him a racing broom, while Draco silently watched the exchange. He wasn't really surprised that Theo didn't catch on about how this boy was uninterested but, of course, refrained from saying anything.
Draco decided to just take a sharp turn towards the Slytherin table. There was no clapping, just whispers and terrified glances as Draco took a seat at the very end, looking uninterested throughout the whole affair.
Leaving Theo alone, with a lump in his throat and a small sting behind his eyes.
Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa never wanted a child in the first place. However knowing they had no choice,they said to hell with it.
"Why do you care?" Theo winced as the question came out his mouth. That question even got Ron looking appalled.
Draco weighs. Draco’s forehead knocked against Potter’s nose, causing both of them to hiss out in pain. With a snarl, Draco ripped his arm out of Potter’s grip, and glowered at the embarrassed boy.
"Erm, hi. My name is Harry Potter. It's nice to uh, meet you." Stuttered Harry, ignoring Theo, who didn't seem to mind. Draco only stared at him, making no move to acknowledge his introduction. It was only until Harry started to go red that the words appeared.
At first they didn't say anything. Just stared into each other's eyes. One that's cold and dead, and one that was quickly becoming frightened.
Draco, however, was trying to get a hold on Potter and drag him away. It's a good thing they were a nice distance from the scene as Draco was getting no where.
Theo snapped his head up to look into the cold, unforgiving eyes of Lucius Malfoy.
i just wanna say sorry for taking actually forever to get this out. I was so uninspired i had no idea when this was gonna come out. But then i realized that I had comments that my email didn’t send me for some reason??? All of you guys were so kind and understanding it blew my away how much u all actually like this story!! Thanks so much for 12000 + hits! love u all! ❤️
Mrs. Norris
What would be Theo’s reasoning to
“And I’m really glad you don’t like Nott-!”
Draco picked it up and
Harry's face shadowed and you could see his bright green eyes glaring menacingly. "How
”Can you even tell me what Nott has done to you?!”
i’m SO UPSET BECAUSE I WANTED DRACO TO HAVE A LARGER TEXT SIZE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THAT ON AO3 AND I TRIED LOOKING IT UP BUT IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKSKINS AND I TRIED BUT THEY DIDNT WORK IM SO SAD 😩😩
"Ho-how could you d-do this to m-me?" Theo 'sobbed'. He had become somewhat of an expert because he did it constantly whenever his parents didn't get him something.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
Draco was shocked into silence. Where did this new found courage come from? But, Draco didn't kick the brunet out, surprisingly. It was a change from their usual interactions, but a welcome one.
Draco blinked, what was that?
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
“Get. Out.”
Draco felt like exploding. He had to deal with
Draco paused, his quill hovering over the notebook page. He's forgotten... He got so worked up at the thought that every mudblood and blood-traitor would be rid from his life, but failed to remember that Potter would be going with them. This...didn't seem like the greatest idea anymore.
Was he screaming? How he could he not be.
Right, back to the present.
What made it worse was that Draco was not near his side.
Which Draco would normally think if there was no special green-eyed git that roamed the halls of Hogwarts. Potter was determined on defending Draco’s honor every time Lotterybart dared to make a remark against him. This made the students talk, as each and every young soul wondered why the Savior was so passionate about defending someone who looked to be the next Dark Lord. But of course, the one most confused was Draco.
What in the
Flushed, the hero stuttered out, “S-so how was your, uh, summer?! I can only imagine how tiring it must have been for you, because, er, the whole, um,
(See the end of the chapter for
People still gave the pair dodgy looks as they sat down for the Halloween feast. Theo was talking Draco's ear off about Merlin knows what when Professor Quirrel came bursting through the doors. Draco feels dark energy whenever he's in DADA, giving Quirrel flashing eyes that clearly say
He walked to Theo, let him grab his wrist, and
. Not bad.
“And by the way,” Harry panted, hunched over while trying to catch his breath after running back and forth. “I still want to be friends!” He finished standing proud and tall.
Life is good.
“You don’t have to,” the Healer faltered, “But I just want to make sure everything is alright with your throat and vocal cords.”
Draco must have said the wrong thing because all it did was ignite a fire in Potter’s sparkling emerald eyes. “If that wasn’t an actual word,” He crossed his arms and jutted his hips out to the side. Draco‘s eye twitched. “Then... I didn’t give you a real kiss.”
"I pity her for having to be in Hufflepuff. Poor girl." Theo mockingly cooed. People turned around to glare at him, but they only got a snarl in return. Theo was in a sour mood ever since Potter rejected his friendship.
He looked up and cried harder, the black had expanded, now fully covering Draco's eyes aside from a piercing red dot acting as the pupil.
"What does it take to get rid of them?!" Theo asked Draco with a pout.
Moving closer, he gripped Draco's shoulder with strength that was sure to leave bruises. Draco couldn't do much about it, because even if he had his terrifying exterior and attitude, the bloke was just skin and bones. While Theo wasn't exactly going to the gym everyday, he still had more meat on him than Draco.
- but before he could finish his sentence, his own entry disappeared before his very eyes.
Flipping her off probably wasn’t the best option, but right now, Draco has no fucks left to give.
The thing didn't notice them yet, still engrossed in the unicorn it's devouring. Oh - oh no. It stopped. It's head began to slowly turn up, it's body rising with it. There were a few tense moments of silence, where Draco stood wide-eyed, Theo, who was right next to him, was as pale as ever and slightly trembled. Finally, Harry, who was on his knees, still clutching his scar, took withering breaths as the figure stood still before them.
He went to speak to Borgin at the counter, robes billowing behind him. Theo and Draco shared a look with each other. Immediately Theo went to explore, ignoring the elder Malfoy’s demands. Draco rolled his eyes from where he stood, though he made no move to disobey his father’s orders, he did give everything in the store a scrutinized glance.
"Thank you," Theo smiled a small one at Draco, chuckling slightly when Draco gave a
His stare was cold. Any warmth that could have been there was replaced with ice. Draco stares into the eyes of his father, holding his breath for the inevitable.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
my favorite thing is Draco does not know who anyone's name is,, I'm sure y'all can figure them out lol
Harry rubbed the back of his neck as he averted his eyes from Draco.
The problem was said boy is now walking towards Draco and this is
∆°∆°∆°∆
Again I'm very sorry😔
But Draco was too busy thinking about his situation to even consider listening to Theo.
Some say it's Harry Potter, who was apparently a parseltounge. Right after the incident with the snake inside the dueling club, Justin was found petrified on the floor next to Nearly Headless Nick. They say Potter was angry at him for not being more grateful, and that Nick was just an unlucky bystander. When Colin was sent up to the ward, the school went in a uproar.
When he went inside, however, the store was swamped with reporters. Several cameras flashing, adults pushing over children to see whoever was causing the commotion, questions being shouted left and right that were most likely never going to be answered- just absolute
Probably because Potter is inside of the room with him watching him write and think about who might have
Draco was currently watching Theo butcher any type of friendship he could've had with Potter.
The look of rage that encompassed Theo's face was frightening. Nott let go of their joint hands as he tightened them into fists. He looked down unable to meet Draco's eyes as he shook with fury. Draco thought he was angry because the topic was brought up again even though Theo was trying to move on, but that line of thought was quickly squashed as Theo looked up with tears in his eyes.
Draco said as he turned back to Hermione. She glared at the boy, ready to start reprimanding him when her wishes were granted. Hagrid thankfully stepped in and managed to stop the fathers from killing each other. Prying them off was surprisingly hard, even for the half-giant.
∆°∆°∆°∆
He was met with Theo's enraged face.
Draco’s arms went to the edge of the windowsill, and with all his strength he tried to lift the window open. However, the blasted thing didn’t budge. It was either because it was designed not to open, or Draco has a severe case of noodle arms
"Well, Mr. Malfoy?" He drawled, not repeating the questions just so he can see Draco flop. Hah.
"Oh? I would say that was a shock but, we both know it's not." Theo stated snobbly.
The blond boy’s head flopped backwards and his whole body went still. Is it over?
”Draco! How can you still sit in the same compartment as him after what he did to you?” Harry shouted. Draco’s face was burning; he strangely never thought he would be on the receiving end of Potter’s spats.
It was the last thing he said that really set Potter off.
Theo sounded as if this was the most preposterous idea known to wizard kind.
Then, it started to move.
. Quirrel always avoided his eyes for this reason. However, him having a reputation of a coward, and Draco of a psycho, this wasn't strange to anyone who noticed.
After Pomfrey checked him over making sure his vitals were good she asked him how he felt.
McGonagall watched them with a sharp eye, hands on her hip and looking absolutely threatening.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
He did, however, notice Draco raising his hand once more to give him another slap.
Quirrel threw up and fainted.
¹Will this show up again??
That I called you that
Draco is conflicted on whether or not this was a good idea. He is currently in an empty classroom, in his black silk pajamas, simply...sitting there. For at least an hour or two.
Ok. No, no he could not.
Draco was seconds away from
Draco properly adjusted himself so he was no longer on the side of his bed. Theo climbed on next to him, closed the curtains, and proceeded to make himself comfortable.
“Cunt,” Lucius snarled, obviously giving up from being any kind of civil towards the orange family.
Draco was...
“I do
"You're all done deary!" Theo jumped down and said goodbye to the secretly annoyed boy. He grabbed Draco's hand and dragged him out the shop. Never noticing how Harry's eyes were trained on Draco.
Draco registered the threat, but didnt think anything of it, as his brain was too mangled from the tears streaming down his face at a rapid speed.
I hope y'all didn't think this was gonna be happy
It seemed like it was already was, for when the blond boy managed to get a glance at Lockhart, Potter was there standing next to him, looking like a right fool. They caught each other’s eyes, his raised eyebrows caused the other child to flush brightly and, somehow, escape from Lockhart’s clutches.
Ugh sorry for being late y'all!
Speaking of Draco, the boy dropped to his knees, circling his arms around his abdomen. He coughed.
After some time he opened his eyes.
Theo threw up red sparks in the air. That's probably what they do.
s h i t
"No wait I'm sorry for that too! It was just really scary and I wasn't thinking! Please Draco!"
So, obviously, he confronted Potter. Just like before, he snatched Potter away from his group of idiots and threw him into an abandoned classroom. Draco locked the door with a swish of his wand, grabbed the poor flustered boy by his necktie and yanked him close. They were
Theo was sorely disappointed to see that Potter and others were
Potter's day!"
Standing straight, Lucius turned to Nott and glared a glare that could freeze the sun.
He took a step towards the hat.
And with that Draco went back to reading.
👁   👁
But everyone knew that Potter only has two brain cells.
Which he doesn't have time to do because of his detentions...
Theo, who went on and on about ”If you just said something, this wouldn't be happening to you!” It seemed as if no one was on his side...
Or at least... he tried to.
"Fine." Theo snapped before huffing off to bed.
life is not good draco, read the room 🙄
and- UGH!
" The raven haired boy yelled and was preparing to lunge at Theo. But he didn't see Draco slow down as he took in the sight in front of him, so mid-air he let out a shriek and dropped, clutching his forehead.
regarding the small blond boy. Mr. Malfoy was the first one to move.
Despite being clearly miffed at Draco's behavior and obviously wanting to talk about it, she noticed how Draco was seconds away from biting her head off and restated her question.
" He shouted as blinding white pain filled his body – he crumpled. Writhing on the floor as Draco seemed to float over him. When did he move?
Yeah, that's what he thought.
Draco looked up from the book on hexes he was reading when Theo came bumbling towards him.
Theo had the audacity to look annoyed.
Back on the god awful track, Draco decided that he needed answers immediately.
She wasn’t acknowledged as Draco finally succumbed to sleep.
Ollivander came back with a slender obsidian box. He beckoned Draco forward, and like he was asked, he did.
And Draco...said nothing. He - stopped listening a while ago actually.
, Draco thought,
Theo took a step back from the whole display but soon scoffed and turned to Draco, "Hah, did you see th-" He stopped.
It shouldn't have come to much of a shock to him, but it did. It hit him like a ton of bricks in the middle of Theo's hundredth rant that day.
All eyes, despite the majority of them not being Malfoys, were on Professor Flitwick in an instant.
His eyes went briefly back to his father, who was not so quietly arguing with Mr. Borgin about not wanting to purchase anything, for he’s only here for “a professional business transaction
has to put you in your place."
Theo was thrown so off guard, as if he thought Draco was the one who took it too far.
Potter’s face was flushed, his eyes seemed to be everywhere but Draco’s face. They both stood there in silence, Harry twitching and fidgeting about- but most importantly-
Draco, however, was met with nothing as no one was in the fucking Hall. Almost screaming in frustration, Draco turned around sharply only to be face to face with the Chosen One himself.
Don't upset me Theo. The last thing you wanna do, is upset me
"Why… why not?" He sounded small and fragile. Draco couldn't look at him anymore. He laid back down, facing away from Nott. He put the sheets up to his shoulders.
This is not going to end well.
Life was not good and Draco was a fool for ever thinking so.
“What in Merlin’s beard was that?!” Lucius was in shock, what he thought was going to be a sad display of a panic attack turned into something much more concerning.
And stared back into glowing green eyes. Neither made any thought to move, simply looking at each other. They gathered a crowd even though neither had any intention of fighting each other. Finally Draco took a step forward. It earned a gasp from the crowd, many had their hands hovered over their wands. Some, already pointing theirs at Draco.
Bewildered, Draco took a look around the wing, stopping when he met his fathers eyes.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
Harry was hyped. He had seen Draco and Nott avoid each other like the plague and knew this was finally his chance to get to, properly, speak to Draco. He was practically vibrating in his seat in the Great Hall, waiting for Draco to walk through the doors.
But Draco's eyes we're focused on Harry who could say the same for him.
"Mr.Malfoy," Snape stated feebly. He went unheard, as the club continued to ruin(almost) everyones day.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
So Draco left the hall with anger churning in his stomach and a pair of green eyes following him.
Theo's face crumbled as he started to cry. Draco looked worst by the minute, while the Golden Trio sneered at the crocodile tears.
It burst into flames.
All of Draco’s thoughts came to an abrupt holt.
"11 inches, ebony wood. Its core consists of thestral tail hairs. Slightly flexible."
"The troll is in the bathroom too!"
Theo then took the orb and just started saying a bunch of shit, that somehow ended up in a duel??? Draco wasn't paying attention to be honest. However, when Theo announced that Draco was his second, Draco snapped back into reality real quick. There wasn't anyway out though, because McGonagall put a stop to everything.
Draco scoffed, it was making much more sense now. Obviously, Potter would never feel anything like that for him. Haha... yeah. So that comment about the parents really was absolutely unnecessary. Whoops...
”Come to my compartment; I'll force Ron to behave.
Tears were streaming harder on the boy in faults cheeks, accompanied with small hiccups.
Draco gaped at the smoking red letter, not making any move to open it, so it burst open, spilling his fathers enraged thoughts.
Asshole.
Didn't stop actually.
Apologies flowed out of Theo's mouth in a constant stream, yet the man never batted an eye.
Hermione paused in her struggle from attempting to leave Theo's arms and whipped her head around so fast, Theo got a mouth full of hair.
Draco rolled his eyes and tried again, now realizing that he probably shouldn’t be distracted them from the...”road”. Ehh, too late.
Which he has because of Theo's relentless torment.
” Fred said, an arm around George as they made kissy faces at each other, “Looks like Nott’s got a crush on Malfoy!” George finished, the both of them cackling. The family joined in and Theo’s face could only get so red.

"Draco?"
, Draco thought.
He got off of the abandoned desk he was sitting, only now realizing that this was the same classroom the incident happened. Fighting down a blush, Draco strutted over to where Potter’s lanky body sat. He stood in front of the other, trying to be subtle with his posing.
“You may be very uncomfortable with this request, but... would you mind saying something for me? It’s strictly for medical reasons!!” She added when Draco got an enraged look on his face.
So now, Draco is sitting in his bed contemplating on what the hell to do now. He clearly won't be spending more time with him, why would he? But how would he get that through Theo's head? Theo. Who has gotten
Draco stared back gobsmacked,
Draco turned his attention back to the window, thinking about what the brown-haired girl had said. Where could Potter have gone? And the other one of course. His thoughts strayed towards Potter, unanswered questions popping up. Why was the Chosen one of all people so...
She looked as is she was going to continue, but paused when the boy on the bed started to stir. The whole room was silent, Pomfrey seized in her wand waving as they all watched the blond boy slowing rise from the bed.
Draco couldn’t help but feel so ashamed of himself, he actually started believing what Potter was saying to him. He should have listened to Theo when he said that all the supposed “Savior” was. Nothing but a bigoted ass.
“You spoke!” Potter accused.
Frantic, Draco made an attempt to escape and move to another part of the bookstore when, the utter
Draco was covered in blood from head-to-toe. More blood splatters him as the club bashes the trolls face in again, but he never flinches. He stands eerily still as he watches the trolls face become more and more deformed.
He never said he was good at avoiding people.
. He would have no help to the rough treatment he was getting, unless he did something he was uncomfortable with.
The first time he heard this, he was
Draco gave a shrug where he was seated, he learned to deal with Theo’s antics, they didn’t really bother him as much as he made it seem.
McGonagall's face thundered, but Draco was too angry to care. He only continued to stare at the still crying child, hatred running through his veins.
There was a faint blush on the blond boy's cheeks, his head was tilted down, but he looked up at Harry through his platinum eyelashes.
He returned with a weak thumbs up. Harry beamed at him and made his way out the door again, this time in a much more proper fashion. Draco went to open up his journa-
“You had the Nott boy tied around your finger. He was weeping all over the hospital ward, truly a pathetic sight. What did you do exactly to get him in such a state?” Lucius asks, sitting down and sipping a glass of brandy Draco swears was not there before.
Next up was Potter.
Theo cried, and cried some more, hoping that this wouldn't fail him.
that you would know more about Mr. Borgin, if you weren’t a pathetic little-“ it’s... it’s not important.
“Draco you’re... hanging off the side of your bed,” Theo pointed out. “You didn’t even try to hide yourself. I’ve been watching you scribble in that book for a while now.”
Draco gave a sigh. The things he does for other people. He turned back to their worried expressions and asked:
He didn't say anything, simply staring at the ground with his fists clenched. He didn't say anything when Theo was escorted to the Hospital Wing with gental touches and soft spoken words, nor did he say anything when Snape landed a boney hand on his shoulder, informing him that they were going to tell his parents about this ordeal.
Draco and Tom have been talking on and off for days now. Despite the fact an old man could possibly be at the other side of the journal, Draco has been feeling a strong connection towards it. He would scowl when Theo attempted to take it away, panic when he couldn’t find it; he revolved his entire world around the diary. This was fine at first, despite what Theo told him, until the blackouts started to hit. He would wake up disoriented in the strangest places, and he couldn’t for the life of him remember how he got there. He would ask Tom, frantic:
"So, uh, why don't you like to speak? " He asked. Theo was on him at once, "You can't just ask him that Potter!" Theo shouted, "Didn't your parents teach you any etiquette? Oh wait- no, no they didn't. "
.” He made it sound as if Harry was talking to Voldemort. Before Harry could get a word out, someone answered for him.
He opened his mouth, to be honest, his mouth did feel a little dry. Maybe it’s because he just came out a long ass sleep and hadn’t been offered any water yet.
Draco twitched. The club went still, seconds away from hitting the troll once more. Draco twisted his head to look at her, eyes still bright.
"Hey, Draco," Theo turned to the boy in mention, narrowing his eyes when Draco moved out of his touch.
"Argh!" Theo shouted, and yanked Draco back in his seat. However, instead of Draco looking scared and intimidated, he just had a look on his face that said 'really?'.
He stared some more.
Theo and Draco met Amy at Ollivanders. "We're here to get our wands!" Exclaimed the only 11 year old actually willing to speak. Ollivander heard him, but it didn't look it as he continued to gape at the silent child with wide eyes. He swung around and marched to the back of shop. Theo was confused as to why he did that but refrained from commenting.
The only person who didn't believe it was Draco, was Harry. He felt grateful that Draco stood by his side, when even Ron and Hermione began looking at him differently ever since he started talking about the "voice in the walls".
The doors of the Great Hall swung open to reveal a calm and collected Draco Malfoy.
"Draco you're a genius!" Yes, we know.
"What do you mean no?! I thought we were friends! Unless..." Theo changed his tactic and adopted a sad look on his face, " We really arent?" He stared at Draco, knowing this is where he would yield.
Theo looked down before muttering the words, "I'm sorry. But, please could you help me with this?"And despite Draco's obsession with blood and death, he did have a soft spot for his friend. So with a silent groan he got out of bed. Theo beamed, moving to throw his arms around Draco, which he successfully ducked out of. Theo huffed and followed Draco out the portrait, both still in their pajamas.
He opened the door, and inhaled the scent of rotting corpses, moldy earth, and the coppery smell of blood. He firmly closed the behind him, locking it with a flick of his wrist. Yeah, maybe he could do wandless and wordless magic. However, Draco fails to see how that’s anyone’s business. Draco didn’t have to look for long, the mirror was in the middle of the room. He walked closer, no matter how many times he enters the room, it never fails at sending shivers down his spine. He ran a slender finger down the mirror’s frame, he stared at his reflection, but it didn’t stare back.
Theo was moping around the castle, when suddenly a hand shot out at him and pulled him into a dark alcove. He was suddenly face to face with the one and only Harry Potter.
liking where this was going.
“No dear, a simple hello would work.”
Draco sincerely regrets writing what he did in that diary, because now, Tom was pestering him non-stop about it. Draco was ready to throw and all of its contents in a Fiendfyre. However, he cracked one day, and ended up spilling information he didn’t even know! Draco remembers as if it was yesterday. Because it was.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
There were piercing screams from everyone in the shop as Arthur brutally pummels Malfoy Sr. to the floor. The smaller Malfoy turns his head, embarrassed to see how badly his father was losing. His unbothered attitude was apparently rather distracting, because Granger turned to him and frantically said: “Why are you just standing there?!”
”Hey, ” he said to Potter, ”You can't just barge in here and take the people you want!”
Theo couldn't stop a little snort, which was fine because he wasn't the only one. "Tell me Potter, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
. Draco needed new eyes.
Draco was seething, he didn't deserve to be here. Theo had pleaded and begged for forgiveness but was, ironically, met with silence. So, now Draco has to wander off into a forest with Merlin knows what inside. Well the giant is explaining everything but Draco is much too busy sulking to pay any real attention.
The silence was straining, so Theo tried to break it.
. If this was the life he was going to live, then so be it.
The thing took stuttered but fast steps as it approached them. Potter wasn't doing anything useful, just moaning and groaning on the floor - thanks for that Harry! Theo wasn't doing anything useful either! He dipped!
Theo hauled the boy onto the hospital bed, looking around for Poppy when he realized she wasn't inside.
. And Draco found why when a sign caught his eyes.
He didn't notice that Hermione had stopped talking and was looking at him in a disapproving manner.
Potter and Theo finally came to an end with their screaming match, only to turn around and realize that the whole school was staring at them. When they both caught Draco's eye, a single brow raise got both faces red.
"Well, request expired, " Theo muttered to himself, dismissing Draco's look, "Just because you're the
Draco, you won't believe this!"
“Are you mute of choice or was it something that you were born with?”
Draco and Theo were locked in an intense staring contest. Draco opened his mouth.

There was a lot of talk in Hogwarts ever since that little feather incident. Everywhere Draco and Theo went, whispers followed.
With a flaming face, the platinum blond boy tried to keep up with the conversation, but that was almost impossible for him. He quickly got bored and went to take a seat. He had just noticed that people were starting to gather up inside. How he didn't realize this when he was in the entryway, he wasn't sure.
Potter! It just had to be! Well... no it really didn’t, considering the You Deserve Better speech he
The brown haired boy was terrified, knowing he pushed Draco over the limit.
"Draco!
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
"Why are you here, Nott?"
Theo, of course, also heard and immediately stepped in to defend Draco. He slandered the Weasley name. Insult after insult until he offered Harry his friendship.
Draco's face contorted into sadness, his body crumbling down as he put his knees up and covered his face with his hands.
“Draco Malfoy? I have a poem for you.” The gruff voice of the cupid spoke to him.
That last rumor was especially popular, so it made everyone piss their pants running when Draco fixed a hard stare on them.
With a sigh he plopped down on his chair and called Dobby to get him a bottle of brandy, ignoring his wife’s pestering.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco thought futility. He straightened up and rubbed his eyes with the heel of his palm, because there was no way what he was seeing was real. But, no. Even after rubbing vigorously at his eyes, the sight before him remains.
He only got a snarl back as the Chosen One asked what happEnEd ttTTtO Dr acCcccccccCco-
Snape continued to ask him stupid questions, while Draco stared straight ahead. Not taking in the interrogation. His back was awfully straight, hands clasped in front of him. It wasn't until Snape called his name that he finally snapped out of his small trance. Snape looked at him in an annoyed way, clearly noticing his lack of attention.
Theo whipped his head to McGonagall so fast he's sure he got whiplash. Snape had a thunderous look on his face but refused from commenting. The Professors made their way to the loo when Theo's voice stopped them.
Draco said absentmindedly, mind focused getting out of there,
Draco would say he doesn't remember the last time Theo has been so inarticulate, but that would be a damn lie.
Oh. And Draco of course.

When he awoke again it was to Granger’s tap. They’ve made it to Hogwarts and the Professor on the train helped guide the boys safely to the school, where they were receiving the mother of all lectures.

Draco didn't hear him though, he wasn't paying attention to his surroundings, dark thoughts about how easily one could poison everyone in the Hall were swirling in his mind. Soon it was Draco's turn to be sorted.
Draco couldn’t remember his summer for the life of him. It was all a blur, his father’s “subtle” glances towards him, his mother’s indifference. Really it was just as if nothing tragic that could have resulted in his death happened at all. Theo came to visit

Draco thought. As the two continued bashing the Weasleys, Draco looked down to the book in his hand. Turning it over, it looked like a normal leather bound diary. The front wore the initials, T. M. Riddle, and Draco couldn’t for the life of him remember who that was. Distracted by his thoughts, he didn’t notice when his father turned his eyes to him- or rather- the book in his hands.
He stopped his musing when his shoulder was softly hit. Harry looked up to see Draco smiling softly at him.
And with that, Draco left.
Harry and Draco turned their heads to see Theo staring at them. Well, staring at Draco, he seemed to be avoiding Harry's eyes.
Where is he going? Well, he's trying to figure that out too.
*looks in mirror*
Draco shook his head as he willed the traitorous thoughts away. This was no time to start doubting Tom, not when so many bodies have already made their way to the hospital wing. Draco didn't think so many was necessary though.
Theo was silent, guilt prominent in his eyes. The animagus, however, was not finished.
Speaking of Draco- the other half of the school say it's Draco Malfoy. His nonchalance when he saw the words written in blood on the stone wall.

expelled, but instead glaring at them heatedly from their side of the Hall.
“But Drac- M-Malfoy,” Hermione tried using Draco’s first name, but after the glare he gave her she realized he hadn’t quite forgiven her for the stunt she pulled in the library.
Draco felt his arm being pulled and turned his head to the source. Theo's eyes were wide and he seemed to be shaking. "We
"Er," Harry began, "What's this all about."
After wandering and still not managing to find his father and friend, Draco decided to trek to Flourish and Botts to get all his necessary books for the upcoming year and some other books... about other things.
Theo glared, “I didn’t want to waste my breath on her!”
“You’ll be needing this,” he said as he dropped Ginny’s book back into her cauldron. He turned with a flare, beckoned Theo and Draco to follow, and left the store without a second glance. Theo followed after him like a pathetic little lapdog.
Draco shot back.
I turned 15 on the 18th :)
Draco was done with the world, Theo has avoided him ever since the forest incident. The only reason he is alive is because of a centaur named - Firenze? Fenrir? He wasn't listening. But that's not important! He almost died and Theo is choking on his damn pride! So Draco is not in the best of moods, and his luck only worsened when he was confronted by some ugly witch while reading in the library.
"Mr. Malfoy." Despite her attempts her voice was still wobbly.

And yea I'll post, I don't even know why the hell I took so long :)
Malfoy faced the exit once more. And this time, he wasn’t stopped from leaving.
Draco paused on the staircase...why was he thinking about Potter of all people? Shaking it off, he turned the corner, walking pass his room and he ventured further down the West Wing. He’s been warned never to go pass the black door with the golden knocker, but as that door quickly fades from his peripheral, he feels something he hasn’t in a while. The feeling that lies deep in his chest, only growing stronger as he meets his destination, the Red Door. He comes closer to the wood, inhaling it’s familiar scent. He raises a finger and scratches the blood off the door revealing the black underneath. Draco will most likely never hear the Red Door’s story, but that doesn’t stop him from fantasizing. Grasping the doorknob, he ignores the sudden rush of despair coursing threw him and twist it open. The air was salty, causing his eyes to water, but Draco plunged on.
Hearing that from Theo was nothing, but from ones own father hurt like hell.
“Do you,” started McGonagall, “remember what had happened to you?”
Draco took a shuddering breath and pressed his quill back to the paper.
"He set the whole class on fire! They barely managed to escape alive."
"I won't."

”Person, ” Potter corrected. He gently took Draco’s hand, and they both left without any more objections.

He was met with silence until someone who Theo swore was not there before spoke up and said:
The sight of the trolls club, beating it's owners face in repeatedly.

“What did you do to him?”
use that phrase around others because you are a Malfoy and we can afford anything. Just go to your room, I’ll have a talk with you when I’m sober.”
She strode over to Theo, who thought he was not at all old enough to die. She stood over him and asked, with the most terrifying voice possible:
💖Last Chap Recap💖
He added in for good measure, still highly enjoying the scandalized look on Nott's face. But, Nott stayed by his side which earned a raised eyebrow.
lots of italicized words,, but that’s how i roll 😎
Theo had know idea as to what's happening, too focused on the excruciating pain coursing through him. Suddenly, his hair was yanked so he was forced to meet Draco's eyes. He was slapped.
Oh Draco... You idiot 🙄
He took a step forward, forcing Draco to step back. He continued this until he was in front of the doorway.
The hair was dropped, the room stopped shaking, and the pain was blessedly gone.
” Harry shouted back, eyes squeezed shut and fists clenched at his sides. The two boys glared at each other, chests heaving with their newly released anger. “Draco... no matter what you think, no matter what you’ve done..” Harry was getting closer now, taking soft, slow steps as if he was approaching a frightened animal. He set a hand on Draco’s arm, lightly squeezing when he was showed no resistance. “You deserve to have someone who actually acts like your friend.” They stood in silence, neither daring to say a word. Until Harry dared to do what Draco thought was the impossible.
“How can your parents be fine with this? Don’t they notice how he treats you?”
This diary belongs to Tom Marvolo Riddle.
"Oh so you finally grew a pair huh, Draco?" Theo sneered, out of his seat and looking down at the gray-eyed boy.
Harry had somehow managed to forget that he came with the Weasleys, Grangers, and Hagrid. Judging by the expression on Draco’s face, he must of figured out who shouted that as well. Turning, Harry met the incredulous faces on the red heads.
, shouted out his name in the middle of a bookstore filled with sodding
Draco questioned himself as he looked at the retreating pair. The boy turned back to the family, who were staring at him with varying looks of wariness and confusion, probably as to why he didn’t run off with his father. Draco ignored them all and looked at the Wesley girl, who was staring at him with a dangerous sneer. He stepped close to her and she immediately backed up, her family protesting loudly. Draco rolled his eyes and dug in her cauldron before she got the time to move away again. He held up a brown leather diary with a raised eyebrow.
He turned in his position to face his attacker, who looked down at him with concern in his eyes.
I took the hint
Draco to notice him put the book in the cauldron. So that way Draco would take it, start writing in it, and then Lucius would sneakily take it to read in on his secrets! But, that still doesn’t explain who this Tom Riddle guy is!
The two stared at each other, not knowing how to proceed.
As Draco walked back to his dorms, he was met with frightened stares, small screams,and disgusted glances. So, nothing new really. But, Draco didn't register anything, keeping his head held high, he met everyone's judging stare with a glare of his own. He stopped.
He turned and made his way to the door, but was stopped by a cry “Wait- no!” and again, another arm yank. Before Draco could get out some serious reprimands, and possibly a couple of good hits, he was interrupted by a wet smack on his cheek.

uh ohhhh back again 😎
Theo had to spend the rest of the year with Filch and Hagrid for his detentions. He was sneered on in the hallways ,because news of what had happened somehow managed to spread throughout the castle.
Draco says : shut the hell up
"As I was saying," Theo spoke with a slight growl, "I have a great idea on how we could absolutely
Draco was confused, Theo avoided the topic of Potter every chance he got, yet now Theo's bringing him up willingly?
Harry was going to keep the look on Nott’s face in his mind forever.
Nelden Lottbong.
Why would his father have this in his possession, just to give it to the Wackly girl? Is it of no value? Then why have it in the first place? It made no sense! Finally, Draco braved to open the book, only to find it...blank? The clogs in Draco’s head were turning violently. What could this possibly mean?! Draco gave it a couple more thoughts, when finally something that made a
"How dare you say such a thing, boy! 100 points from Slytherin, and year long detention!" The Professor shouted.
They exchanged another look and talked about something. Draco waited like the fine gentleman he was for their conversation to be over. His mind wandered to how Theo still was not back to the compartment and that Draco may have managed to scare him off for goo-
That was when he locked on to those electric green eyes. Even from the water in his eyes he could see how vivid and bright they were. The sheer intensity from them made him unable to look away, lost in those glowing green orbs...
!” Theo snarled, actually stomping his foot. That only seemed to spur everyone on, now clutching their bellies as they chortle at his expense. Harry wiped the tears from his eyes to try to see Draco’s thoughts on this. He was pleased to see the pale boy checking his nails and looking disinterested, though of course he heard, who didn’t? However, as the children were having their spat, the grown ups were involved with their own. It was quickly brought to their attention as Arthur Weasley tackled Lucius Malfoy to the ground, the two men engaging in a violent brawl no one saw coming.
*retching noise*
Theo whipped to the source of the yelling, Draco took this chance and pushed the boy away from him, scowling hard when Theo glared at him, and trying to ignore the wetness in his eyes.
"HUFFLEPUFF!"

"SLYTHERIN!"
Before this all started, Draco would've said something much harsher. Maybe:
That made the brunet leave his bed with out another word.
Theo beamed and dragged Draco outside. Chatting excitedly on all the fun they could have. Draco went along.
Draco put a hand on his forehead at an attempt to stop the pounding. At this point, he wasn’t sure if he was going to make it out alive. How can something so small be so talkative- Merlin! He angled his face back to the other one, who was squirming from underneath his hand. Draco removed his hand from Potter’s mouth, and gave a sharp glare when he took that as an invitation to keep going.
Theo's head, however, was held up high so his smug expression could be shown to the world.
started.
:)) hope you aren't mad at me for taking so long to post.
After wearily eyeing the book in Draco's hand, (and catching his breath) Theo told Draco everything he witnessed in a much clearer way.
"Detention." McGonagall told them. Draco glared hard at Theo with tired eyes, wishing he could've stayed in bed instead. Huff, he just got out of detention with Snape too. The fact they
"Aren't you going to attempt the spell?" Flitwick asked, not taking laziness from anyone. Draco lifted an eyebrow and raised his wand.
Draco looked up from his ruined essay, iris' no longer shining silver but a chilling black.

Even with the kinder comment, the brown haired boy immediately got red in the face. He shoved Draco with the hand still on his shoulder. The corridor was completely empty, as class had already started, but Theo had no problems about being late.
However, now there was no way those could sail smoothly.
"Let's have a seat." Theo said and when neither made any move to sit down, his jaw gave a little twitch.
“So what’s up with the book? I saw how what you wrote disappeared and then the other persons entry appeared. That’s actually pretty cool!” Theo exclaimed, before he must have realized something that’s caused his face to grow somber. “So. Who’s on the other end of the journal?”
towards him? All the conversations they’ve had Draco could count on one finger. Plus, Potter hates Theo, but is so calm and relaxed to him. Well- not calm and relaxed. The git’s a stuttering, blushing mess. Draco has seen him speak coherently (not that he’s watching Potter), but Potter can never do so when he’s around Draco. It didn’t make any sense.
“Well, naturally, you can’t control —”
“Up,” Harry commanded when he felt a building pressure in his groin.
“I know, I’ve been terrible.” Harry laughed, wrapping his arm around Hermione’s shoulders. “I’ve missed you two. What have you been up to?”
“No, I-well, I just would prefer something more private. I can ask McGonnagall if we could have permission to work in Hogsmeade maybe?”
“My son admired you more than you could have ever known, Mr. Potter.” Narcissa admitted.
He knew he was out of luck when the sounds of scuffling and a soft noise echoed from somewhere further in the house.
“Why does it fail to surprise me that you would do that?” A voice, somewhat familiar, says from the shadows.
“Er – we asked no one to be down here.” Ron said, lightly scanning the room. “We just thought it would be easier.”
Harry gives him an hour before he goes to look for him.
“Do you read often?” Harry asks, pushing his glasses up further on his nose from where they’ve slipped down.
“I don’t know, really. Just poking around for some memories, I guess.” Harry remarks, sitting on a trunk by the edge of Draco’s bed and gazing up at the portrait. Viewing the picture is making his heart twist painfully in his chest. And even if the kid’s voice is several octaves higher than his Draco’s, it is the same voice nonetheless.
The group, sparing Malfoy, clinked their beers together, and some foam dribbled down the sides. Harry thought he could get used to the familiarity of all this. He desperately loved Ron and Hermione but wondered what it would be like to have a group of guy friends of his own. He wouldn’t mind it, especially if they all were as pleasing to look at as these were.
“Please,” Draco snorts. “Imagine the luck of the poor person who would get me, not only a Death Eater but also a drug-addict. What a package deal. At this point, I’m glad no one has me.”
“I think there’s a lot to talk about,” Draco said, approaching Harry at the counter until they were only inches apart.
Clove came closer, resting delicate fingers atop the side of the bed. Draco knew It was the closest gesture of comfort she could offer with his mother at his side.
The bedside lamp is turned on low, casting long black shadows across the room. Harry comes to sit beside him silently.
Harry shrugs. “I prefer the beef.”
Hermione’s eyes widened, but her mouth remained shut in a tight line. “Ron, I don’t think he is kidding.”
Harry cocked an eyebrow. “So you think I’m charming?” he said to the empty room.
Harry followed Zabini out into a short hallway at the far side of the room. He took a sharp left, but Harry was still at his heels as they approached an ornate black door.
“Hello,” Draco says, breathless, as though he’s forgotten that they’re actually together. Sometimes, Harry doesn’t feel like it’s real.
“More flowers?” Harry laughed but felt warmth blossom through his chest at the thought of the Honeysuckles. He had put them in a vase in his room immediately, though he knew he would have to explain that away at some point. Maybe Neville would cover for him…
He was shaking as he searched for Draco’s wrist, but his fingers closed around open air. Draco’s hands clasped together behind his back, as if he was afraid Harry would touch him at all. His face bore every sign of regret, and Harry wanted to curl into a ball and disappear.
Harry was immediately uncomfortable, wishing he could put space between the two of them. Still, he postured, hoping Draco wouldn’t sense his nervousness heating the room. His hopes were dashed, of course.
“Right this way, Mr. Potter,” she says brightly, leading him down a hallway just as sterile and empty as the waiting room. In a strange way, it reminds him of King’s Cross Station on the night of the battle. All white.
“Thank you,” Harry says, looking down. “For letting me in.”
“I would be more surprised if it didn’t,” Harry says quietly. “But this is a good thing.”
“It’s not fair.” Hermione shrugs, pity layering her tone. “You’ve sacrificed so much, and now this too. I can’t imagine how you feel.”
“You’ve done an amazing job with all this. I’m sure Draco loves it.” Ron grinned, holding onto a neatly wrapped present, which Harry received warmly. Hermione must have chosen it.
“You wanted to get away from me,” Harry said slowly as he parsed out the words in his head. He wasn’t surprised, and it didn’t hurt like it should have. “I don’t know what I’ve done to make you hate me so much, but —”
They’d Apparated to an alley of some sort in a Muggle area. It had been a short and relatively painless trip, meaning they couldn’t have been far from Knockturn at all. The eerie silence of the street and a gentle yellow glow from the streetlights indicated they were in a residential neighbourhood.
“I’m not at liberty to discuss it,” Harry says, although the Ministry’s words are the ones spilling from his lips. “Official business.”
“Well, if you would care to focus and stop fidgeting every five seconds, you might actually be productive.” Malfoy muttered, moving his magazine in front of his face so that his view of Harry was obscured.
“So now that this is all cleared up,” Hermione narrowed her eyes at Ron and fixed a prudent gaze upon Harry instead. “Are you and Malfoy together?”
“Oh boy, Harry...” Neville dragged his eyes down to the flowers and back at Harry, “you’ve got it bad, haven’t you?”
Draco seems to be scuffling his feet, knocking his knee into Harry accidentally. “I don’t think whoever I have would want to know either.”
Harry finds himself blinking away tears, and Narcissa does the same. He knows what she poses is not a question. She removes a handkerchief from her coat and offers it to him.
Ron lets out a loud, infectious laugh, and Harry can’t seem to match it as he usually would. It disappears quickly, though, as the delight on Ron’s face turns into confusion.
“Me and Malfoy?” Harry struggled to get the words out, but he knew what Ron was talking about now. Their lips were about to touch when Ron had walked in on their private moment. And he’d been hanging out with Draco for weeks, unconsciously avoiding his two best friends.
“Don’t lie to me,” she gritted out. “Is everything okay, you know, with him?”
Harry laughed, digging for the remote between the cushions and extracting it with an “Aha!” Draco was not wrong. Televisions were not exactly pleasing to the tasteful eye.
“Harry, my darling,” Molly croons as soon as she catches sight of him.
“They listen to you because you’re a war hero,” Draco says.
Harry thinks about it for a moment. And while he’s usually ravenous in the morning time, he feels nothing but a slight, disinterested twinge from his stomach—thoughts of the night before still rattle around his head like loose marbles. A part of him desires to crawl back into bed. To rest his aching joints and pretend he hadn’t lost his partner in the violent exchange. But there’s Draco, in front of him, with eyes that are shining too beautiful to be considered something so drab as grey. Draco who cleans his wounds and offers him breakfast. Who lives in a big castle, all by himself.
It’s not that he’s stingy with his money, because he doesn’t really need to be considering the state of his Gringotts vault, but Tesco is just so much cheaper than the places in Diagon Alley, and infinitely more convenient to the Ministry than the hassle of a Floo. It still begs the question as to why Draco’s hanging around around the dairy aisle, picking up cartons of milk, inspecting them carefully for a moment, before putting them right back.
Hermione barely glanced at Harry and Ron as she led Delaney from the room. Her mind was, rightfully, elsewhere.
“Does that make you sad?” Harry asks, the words tumbling from his lips before he can keep them in. He curses himself for getting tipsy enough to loosen an already loose filter.
He’s unsure of why the statement bothers him so much. Draco might be his soulmate, but Harry barely knows him. He shouldn’t feel the need to take care of Draco like this, but something in him pulls him to do so. He doesn’t want to leave him alone.
“It would definitely have to be filed under culture, Potter, er, Harry.”
“Bloody hell. We just made up, so I’m just going to pretend not to be mad.”
“I thought we could eat together today.” Draco leaned his briefcase against the door and made his way to the couch, sliding down exhaustedly against a cushion.
Harry laughs joylessly. “Nope.”
Draco stills next to him, ashing his cigarette in the soil.
“I should just knock on the door and ask for Narcissa to take me to his room?” Harry asks incredulously. “I can’t just do that!”
This is how I'm lookin right now:
He scowled and turned away.
Last chap Harry and Draco get into a little fight about how deserves some real friends which results in Harry planting a WET one on Draco’s cheek
Draco began checking his nails at this point.
Draco explained slowly, text on the top of his head appearing word for word instead of it being a big block of text like usual,
Maybe it was the vulnerability in his voice that made Hermione nod her head and scramble to get up. They both ran out the door, right as Draco began to raise his wand.
∆∆••∆∆••∆∆••∆∆
"Why on earth were you so violent with it?! Yes it was attacking me -and you only wanted to help! - but you could have handled that situation much better."
he got rid of…
"Say something to me."
The ones that continued to stand by Harry was half the school who thought he wouldn't dare, his friends, and all the professors.
With a blush and a snarl, Draco removed his wand from his robes and pointed it to the window. He ignored Theo’s mad dash out the door, fool probably thought he was planning on blasting it open. Draco sharply swished his arm up, and the window followed the movement. Proud of himself, the grey-eyed lad stuck his head out of the train.
"UNBELIEVABLE!" She shouted turning red, "You made this young man suffer, at the expense of what may I ask?!" The professor's arms were cross, with her foot tapping on the ground repeatedly. She stared at Theo as if actually expecting an answer to come forth.
, he thought himself. He had to admit, it was nice book. Boring yes, but classy. That’s when he caught the words on the front.
Granger.
of running away. He needed to get this over with now.
Draco looked down and continued writing his essay.
³ you already know what I'm finna put
, Draco couldn’t help but think. He made the boy cast a silencing charm before they continued.
It was cute that Harry has such big faith in Malfoy when he had such little interactions with him.
Tetris Booth from Ravenclaw.
Harry couldn’t help but think how nice his bum looked under his trousers.
"Isn't it funny," Theo started, startling Draco, "how we've been friends for -what? 7 years now and you still haven't spoken a word to me?"
After he had asked his question, he noticed Draco getting antsy and internally scoffed. But then the ground started to shake and Draco’s eyes were turning black and he was feeling sick all of a sudden and-- it was just too much.
Last Chapter Recap: Lucius, Theo, and Draco went back the manor, where Theo and Lucius bash the Weasleys. But then Lucius sees Draco with the diary and tried to do something about it but just ends up being an alcoholic. Draco left the pathetic scene to go to a very mysterious red door. The room inside the door is not good ✨ Draco dreamt of werewolves, metamorphogi, and The Grim.
Draco was only a couple steps in his common room before hearing the portrait door swing open and shut again. He turned around to wonder who the hell had to be so loud to see Theo. The brown haired boy put all his weight to one leg, crossed his arms and refused to look at Draco.
Draco had a plan.
to omit a threatening aura along with one of aloofness, when there's this big buffoon with stupid glasses staring at you! Like!! Can't you see he's trying to be mysterious?!
Got a new phone so all the chapters I had saved got dead!! 🤠
Harry ran out with his tail between his legs.
He could though.
The students were holding their breaths, none of them have heard him speak the whole time he was here.
A small, round faced girl with pink cheeks stepped up and sat on the stool.
"What are you children doing here!?"
Theo always knew there was something wrong with his friend. Always knew Draco thought about death and torture, getting a disgusting glint in his eyes. Because of this, Theo immediately knew he had to grab Granger and get the
You ever cross your damn lines again, I will beat the living shit out of you, revive you, and I will not stop until I am satisfied
Look me in my eyes when I'm talking to you bitch
A hand much nicer than Theo's could ever be.
Draco was not taking anyone's nonsense today. So if she was going to be rude, he was going to tear her apart.
“You know, you always were weirdly interested in Draco. What? Wittle Potter got a cwush??” Theo mockingly cooed. Then scoffed. “Wait until he hears about this.” The thought seemed to hit Harry the same time it hit him.
Draco simply could not do seven more years of this.
Draco thought and went back to his original seat, ready to relay these events back to Tom. But the hurried sounds of footsteps coming back stopped him in his tracks.
It's not like Theo's being subtle about it, he would do it in a common room full of people. A higher year would step in, tell Theo to knock it off, but would only help under one condition...
Potter looked dumbfounded, rightfully so. Was he really expected to read his books over the summer?
Of course it isn’t.
Girls gasped, scandalized. The boys jaws dropped, wide eyed. Flitwick turned his bug eyes to Draco, who he realized with a start was staring at him for quite some time.
The boy turned and went up the stairs, not looking back but focusing intently on the eyes following him on his way up.
His back arched off the hospital bed in an inhumane way. There is no way his body should be able to bit that type of angle. Each arch gets more an more intense until you could hear the pops of his vertebrae.
“Why,” Lucius started, barely able to get the word past his clenched teeth,”Do you have that book, boy?” The fury in his face was so terrifying, Draco wasn’t sure if he would leave this interaction unscathed.
“They’re so...so...
"I can choose the wrong sort for myself, thanks."
. He always showed an indifferent attitude towards Theo, but he
He sits silently in the train compartment while Theo rattles off about every little thing he did over the summer. It’s as if nothing crazy happened! No fights, no hospital visits, nothing! Draco gazed tiredly out the window, wondering what this year will bring him. His thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the compartment door. Before Theo can say anything the door swings open to reveal a frazzled looking Hermione Granger.
Harry was so incredibly red as he finally caught up on how much he was
“But you don’t mean that do you! You’re smart, Draco you must have already caught on! I’m sorry if my feelings toward you make you feel uncomfortable- it’s just that I think you are really cool, and nice to be around even if you wish Hogwarts went up in flames! So... um what I am trying to say is Draco-!”
Harry didn’t know he was so passionate about this, but the more he spoke the more he realized how much of a terrible situation this was. Harry thought he should back away before he ended up giving Nott a spot next to Draco, but he just had to get his thoughts out.
Theo nodded hard, please just let him go.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was awake in the Hospital Wing with a worried nurse hovering over him. However, no tar mixed with blood came out of his eyes, (his condition worsened over the days) no spine breaking that could have left him paralyzed from the waist down, nothing! The only thing that’s currently happening is the ever growing scowl on the blond boys face.
Ron sent a scathing look to Theo, then sent an apologetic one to the only witch present. They stared at each other before Ron sighed, cheeks tinted pink, and muttered a small apology. Hermione huffed and flung herself at him, hugging him tight.
Emerald green eyes seemed to swirl like honey behind those
Hm. Weird.
"Oi!" Theo exclaimed, grabbing Draco's ink bottle and pouring it all over his essay.
Of course, a trip to Knockturn Ally was very much in order.
Rage filled Theo's face, Draco flinched.
“Leave Harry alone!” A squeaky voice called out. Everyone’s attention was averted to the youngest Weasley, who was standing in front of Harry with a fierce scowl on her face.
A pause.
"You're… " Theo whispered, looking at him. There was no more admiration. "You're the one behind all of this?" Draco doesn't know why, but when it was put like that it made him feel guilty.
|§|§|§|§|
One day, Potter was there to witness it.
Draco cleared his throat to get his attention.
“No,” Harry deadpanned, voice hard, “Why? Did you want it to be him?”
Despite Theo being the one who shouted that, everyone was on Malfoy's case immediately. The students, the professors, even the ghosts steered clear of him. Well, the ghosts that still had a chance to that is.
Draco stood there gobsmacked, the crying asshole did this several times to him, day and night, but the ONE time Draco retaliated, he was getting life??
...his arm.
I don’t have any feeling regarding you! I already told you that! Well- unless you’re talking about me wanting be your friend- then yeah I do have feelings for you...” His face was red and his mouth wouldn’t stop moving. During his little tirade, Draco’s feeling were all over the place. He doesn’t have feelings for him, but he does at the same time? Draco was starting to think this wasn’t worth the effort. Hand gestures still all over the place, the green-eyed child continued his rant.
He thought Theo cared for him too.
Draco doesn't like the fact that he sounds like he's whining in his own mind.
Theo and Hermione were waiting outside the bathroom after locking it safely and scrambling back. Hermione was still shaking slightly, but if she thought Theo was gonna offer her any comfort, she was gonna have to live up to that "smartest witch of her age" title and knock that thought out.

"Huh?!"
“THAT’S MY
the power surged through him. Lights shattered, wand cases were thrown, the walls shook. Draco's eyes began to roll into the back of his head. It ended as quickly as it started. The occupants of the room stared at Draco in shock. How could so much power come from such a little boy? Draco wasn't paying any attention to them.
Later that day, the castle was already spread with rumors.
Draco put the diary underneath his pillow, with out really knowing why, and drifted off to a dream full of green-eyed orphans.
He was in a coma. Eventually waking up only to repeat the process of spitting out tar, breaking his back, and passing out.
, it’s because he finally thinks it’s time to surround himself with... less poor people.” It was as if he was trying to soften the blow, but then decided against it.
!!” Lucius spat, grabbing a bottle of red wine and taking three huge gulps.
student apologize and leave.
Theo quickly pulled her back as Ron and Harry panicked. "What?! What is it, what's wrong?" Ron asked, frantic.
There was a pause.
“Why,” Pomfrey huffed, “You would think as his father he would be the most outraged out of all of us.” She turned to Draco, who was paler than ever and still had small amounts of tar leaking from his eyes. “What a peculiar boy.” She mumbled and went to go clean him up.
Harry would budge his way in between the two, while Ron and Hermione would cover his other side, making Theo frustrated beyond belief.
Draco stared at him for two seconds before deciding he had better things to do, he turned on his heel, ready to go up to his dorm before he was stopped by Theo's call of "Wait!"
'ello gov'ner
"TROLL," Quirrel screeched, "TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! Thought you 'ought to know." Then he fainted like a loser.
Draco left the store, only to realize his father and Theo were long gone, leaving him in the streets of Knockturn Alley.
"What did he do to you?! Is this why he's friends with you? Because you bully him if he tries to leave?"
( which Draco didn't think was possible) and worst off, being
Harry’s face turned cold and expressionless, such a quick demeanor change it gave Draco whiplash.
The silence in the compartment was deafening, Ron’s red face stares out the window, refusing to acknowledge either boy in front of him. The two boys sitting next to each other couldn’t keep up a conversation, as it seemed that Draco wasn’t interested in any topic Harry chose. Hermione also didn’t seem to make an effort, she seemed content with just staring long and hard at the blond boy.
at the moment, they need to find a capable enough Potions Master to fill his role, but everyone knew about the situation happening inside of Hogwarts. Rita Skeeter managed to find a way in Hogwarts and wrote articles after articles as to how the school was falling apart at the seams, much to Dumbledore's dismay. So now, people refuse to enter the school, including any sort of Potion Master.
Draco's reputation between him and Potter... but... he strangely doesn't care.
Draco swung open the bathroom door right as both Granger and Theo shrieked. There was the big ugly brute, swinging his club like an
"No need to be so rude! And we shouldn't be using that type of language! Honestly. I'm Hermione Granger, that witch you saved from the troll. About that troll..."
"Which means we have to catch them in the act!" The brown haired boy stated 'wisely'
Theo was shocked at the turn of events, barely registering the shove he got which slammed his back to the door.
He opened his mouth and a small noise escaped it before he realized what he was doing and quickly shut his mouth. Looking away, the words appeared on top of his head,
When Harry saw that white-blond head of hair his heart soared!
"For someone who doesn't talk you sure as hell have a lot of sass." Pouted Theo. "Draco! We have to catch them in the act! They deserve to have points taken off for this because I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to stay out past curfew."
"I -I uhh," Theo was at a loss as to what the hell he should say.
He got a raised eyebrow at that but just shrugged. "You just seemed like you needed someone to talk to. Or-er-, " His blush was starting to deepen, "Not that I'm trying to say I'm here to force you to speak, i-it just seemed like you needed some company- or not! You know if you don't want me here, I can, uh, go back to... Madam Pomfrey..." There was a frown on his face as he thought about how that interaction might go. So busy in his thoughts, he failed to notice the small smile on Draco's face.
He looked at Ollivander and with almost black eyes. The words appeared.
Me realizing how many italicized words I have 🙄
Rot Weakly ✨
The day has ended and Draco sat on his bed, curtain closed, and only his headache to keep him company. He glared at Theo with an intense amount of anger when he had tried to join him.
(See the end of the chapter for
guilty but refused to waver what-so-ever. Clearing his throat, Draco asked his question:
there are always so many things i wanna put in the notes but i always forget 💔
"What do you mean what? The duel is today!"
However, something that would stick to Draco forever, was when he, his father, and Theo all went to pick up their supplies.
And just like that, happiness overtook Theo as he launched himself into Draco's arms. And they stayed in that position as Draco relayed the events of what happened from the start of the year. The journal, Tom Riddle, petrifying people, killing roosters, the whole nine yards. How he didn't have any energy due to the fact Tom was using him as a source, the plan to get rid mudbloods and half-bloods alike, so this disgrace of a wizarding world could finally be pure again. When he finished, he pulled back expected more looks of admiration and wonder but instead he got a pale face and wide eyes. Theo was not looking at him, but to the side as he attempted to process what he was told.
The boy's face hardened, his eyes frosted over as he continued walking, he avoided seeing Harry's face, not sure if he would like what was on there. Unable to resist, he took a glance at the raven haired boy.
Draco is
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?!"
Preferably Theo.
Taking Draco with.
Draco's face shut down into a cold mask.
"Mr.Malfoy."
Draco paused. There's no way these were actually their names. He shrugged it off, unbothered. Despite trying to reassure himself, Draco did not reach for the journal, wanting to catch some rest. Tom had to do what was necessary, but damn was Draco tired. He fell into an uneasy sleep. Dreaming of red glowing eyes and screaming blond boys.
He started when a hand found it's way to him, pulling him gently.
anyway chile,, have draco bullying voldemort
Right, so, back to the present.
Draco saw Granger hunched up in a corner, shaking and crying. He turned to Theo and said,
year old boy do
"Look, I now know that how I've been treating you was not very nice. So, I'm sorry." He peered at Draco expectently.
Merry Christmas!!!!
๑•́ㅿ•̀๑) ᔆᵒʳʳᵞ
As he exited out of the Hospital Wing.
"So interesting you say that, really."
If the world could see him now.
Theo rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, in disbelief of what has come over his best friend. Again, his eyes roamed over the small boy. His pillow was propped up against his headboard, knees tight against his chest and shoulders dramatically hunched over. His sheets were thrown off to the side leaving him shivering in the cool air of the Dungeons. He was wearing pajamas that Theo realized he's been wearing for days straight. Even underneath his robes. The brunet shuddered, realizing that Draco must have been skipping showers.
hey... 🧍🏾♀️
Draco looked at him smugly, but knew he wasn't finished. While Theo was distracted, he pulled the boy to him and delivered the mother of all back hands.

Justin Flint-Fletchley
He didn't know why he asked, the dog looked like a coward. His suspicions were confirmed when Hagrid said so. Theo was immediately next to him and though he really wanted to scoot in the other direction, Potter occupied that space for some odd reason. He's sandwiched between imbeciles.
Draco’s eyes were fastened on his clasped hands in front of him, but managed to shake his head. The witch’s gasp rivaled his own. Everything was turning blurry fast. His head pounded, he barely heard the screams coming from... someone. He also barely registered the black tar coming out of his ears... and nose and mouth and - Merlin above - everywhere.
Now Theo looked hurt. For some odd reason, the fact he wasn't going to tell Harry Potter he was the Heir
The name looked oddly familiar.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
Theo yanked his arm out from the grasp and snarled, “What do you want?”
Draco vaguely gestured to the side of his face, cursing his pale skin as he felt it heat up.
Y’all need this summary cuz I didn’t even remember what happened last chapter 💀💀
Draco’s scream will haunt the dorm forever.
Draco stood there in silence, wondering why this was happening to him of all people.
The mute boy sat down with a sigh and melted into the cushions. It felt good to not do anything.
Draco was in a depressed state for days. He went to the rest of his classes the day of the incident, but with a blank mind and barely seeing eyes.
Draco mentally counted to five.
"I heard he was You-Know-Who's son."
Harry did not. His face shone with happiness and a grin was spread wide against his features. He should probably tone it down, but he couldn’t be bothered.
WHÅt haPpenEd tTtOoOoo DrrrrRrrRrraâācCçœœ MMmmMma
y’all i hated this month r u kidding me 😐
Theo was still up in the hospital wing, milking every drop of attention he got. People who would sneer at him came up and wished him a speedy recovery.
§|§|§|§|
. For a couple of moments, all they did was stare deeply into each other’s eyes. Harry taking in the molten silver that swirled in the blond’s irises, and Draco, staring into the jewels that must have been stabbed into his head. Snapping out of it, Draco pushed him back, causing Potter to stumble back over a desk. Draco felt
Me shaking: ÄÌñ'† ñÖ†HÌñG ßÚ† Ä HÈÄR† ÄÇHÈ
The look of pure loathing on Snapes face was worth the detentions.
His lack of expression when Theo shouted next to him, "Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
Why was this not working?!
"Why don't you talk?" A bushy brown haired girl demanded.
Confusion was evident on every face in the Great Hall, Draco's robes have turned green. He...he didn't even put the hat
Draco lied. It was clear that Theo didn't believe him, but, astonishingly, he didn't push the topic. "Draco, " Theo said slowly, softly grabbing his hands and staring straight into the blond's eyes. Bite mark on display for the world to see. Draco was stunned from the adoration that swam in the brown irises. Never in all his life has Nott looked at him like this, and it made him wonder what the
"You never want do anything anymore! It's always 'We should leave him alone' and 'Why do you care about him so much Theo'," Theo shoved Draco until the boy was firmly pressed against the wall,
After losing quite a number of points, the Slytherins were even more adamant in not helping Draco with the Lawnmart problem,
...is that his name? Whatever.
(See the end of the chapter for
that is not true! There's no evidence! Clearly you are just as scared as everyone else and it's taking a bigger toll on you!"  His hands were gripped tighter and Theo's voice took on a stern note, as if he was accusing himself. Well, technically, Draco is blaming himself because he is the heir of the Chamber of Secrets. But, Theo doesn't know that.
"Put the club down."
McGonagall still made a hand gesture for him to come over, although hesitantly. In all of Hogwarts history, this has
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes when Potter couldn’t give him a straight answer. Why anyone would choose him of all people was beyond him.
So, basically, Hogwarts is in a deep load of trouble.
They were leaving the Great Hall, at least, that's what Draco thought. But then Theo took a detour to the Griffindor table and stopped in front of a timid looking boy holding some type of orb.
His hair was tugged harsher, making him cry out.
Draco didn't give an answer at first, looking at Harry to give off an "I may have dragged you here but you're wasting my time" look.
Ron, Harry, Hermione, and Theo moved away from the bathroom, taking in one look inside and had decided they didn't want nightmares for the rest of their life. Why they hadn't left at this point is baffling.
He just said the spell with such little noise and lip movement it gave the illusion he didn't say anything.
"It was me," Theo states, looking down, wincing at Pomfreys scandalized gasp, "It was me the whole time. I pushed Draco into hitting me the other day. He snapped under all the abuse I put in him, yet he was the one to get punished."
How could he when the greatest thing was in his hand?
Harry turned to where Lucius Malfoy stood proud. His hand nested on Draco’s shoulder, next to him stood a sneering Theodore Nott. The boy was busy giving everyone a nasty glare but, when his eyes met Harry’s, he hastily looked somewhere else.
"Every, single, detention Mr. Malfoy has to serve shall be transferred to you – and there's nothing you can do about it," She added when he stupidly tried to protest.
Draco joked, trying to make Theo feel better. All he got was a blank stare.
Draco fell asleep. He dreamed of
Sending angry glares to the guilty boy doesn't do much either, it just makes him blush and look away.
" Exclaimed Nott, moving closer with worry in his eyes and a hand stretched out, as if he wanted to comfort Draco. Not only does Draco look like he's a part-time dementor, but because of his recent fight, he was sporting several bruises. The boy in question was confused- didn't they just go over this? Why would Theo come back just to spout the same nonsense as before?
to Draco and Merlin he most likely thought Harry was such an
Colin Creevey
McGonagall, however, was on a different mission as she sought out the boy trembling in the corner. Her glower could have rivaled a Basilisk’s.
Then he proceeded to shut the door.
"Draco,
Everyone stopped in their tracks as they took in the sight of a fuming McGonagall, seething Snape, and terrified Quirrel barreling to them.
Draco was
He sprinted to her and grabbed her arm. "We have to go, get up." Hermione wasn't listening, her mind was fastened on the troll in the room. "Granger! Get up!" Theo was getting irritated, and, quite frankly, terrified, knowing Draco won't care if he has an audience.
² what about this one,, will it?
Draco was sure he got whiplash from how hard he turned his head to stare at the two. His sudden movement caught their attention. Draco felt the stare of Potter but was too busy gaping at the Healer at the foot of the bed.
Theo only preceded to shuffle around with a blush on his face, successfully irritating Draco.
"ANSWER!"
"SILENCE!" Boomed Dumbledore. "Prefects take your house to your dormitories."
The boy had to recover first, for he expected backlash from his father. What, was the Howler simply a prank? He continues to stare at his father, searching for a hidden meaning in the praise but finding none. He notices his father getting impatient and quickly replies.
Draco needed to get it through the boys head that he has to cut it out. So, he pulled him from Charms, the last class before lunch, and took him all around the castle to find an empty classroom.
“Do not
Holy shit, it was
Draco turned around, annoyance clear on his face.
Theo was really struggling to not burst out laughing right there and then. Who even
“You seem to be fine.”
...Draco would have to speak.
Draco stood in a flash, startling Theo who was watching him with a careful eye. “Draco, what is it?!” He tried to invade Draco’s space so he could look out the window as well, but Draco pushed him back, eyes still trained on proof of the lack of brains inside Gryffindors.
Too many questions arose. Questions he couldn’t ask without being labeled as suspicious.
Sorry for not posting, and for leaving on a cliffhanger. 😋
“Narcissa, come out. You have always had trouble with keeping your pig nose out of things.”
Sandwich Fishing from Gryffindor…
People kept staring at him wherever he went, which was nothing new, but there was an underlying feeling to it that made dread settle over the boys shoulders.
Neither Malfoy acknowledged the mad scramble he made to the floo, as he vanished in a flash of green. They looked at each other, neither knowing what will come next. But then Lucius dropped with a heavy sigh.
Questions came from the raven-haired boy like "Where are we going?", "What did I do?", and "Did you have to push Ron so hard?". They were annoying but Draco managed to remain from snapping...
sooooo, first year is over now. how's y'all quarantine been?
Draco couldn’t help thinking. His thoughts strayed to the missing brunet that had yet to reappear.
Draco was tucked away in bed, scribbling away in his book as always, shadows deep under his eyes, cheekbones sunken in, and already slender body looking like skin and bones. The attacks around the school made the professors wary of students going out, even if it was the weekend. This both benefited and hurt Draco. It helped him because the extra time in his bed let him waste his days away talking to Tom, telling him secrets he wouldn't even admit to out loud. However, because of these protection laws, it was getting harder to fill out Tom's requests without looking suspicious. So, now, instead of using his Saturday to finish homework or purposely ignore Theo, he is strategizing with Tom and accidentally ignoring Theo. And because he was so involved in his planning, he didn't notice the fidgeting Theo standing before him. Not until he finally decided to speak out, that is.
There was a break where no one moved or even took a breath. The club raised again, slammed itself into the poor things face, and stayed still.
of sense popped into his brain.
Knowing, how that was such a stupid fucking idea.
“I’m sorry.. what? You’re asking me who it is?” Harry was baffled... there’s no way right? Draco was just pulling his leg...
“Those
He opened his mouth once more.
Harry just stared at him, disgust proud on his features. He made his way to the the door before;
. It was only when he saw the small smile on his face that he relaxed. This was going better than he thought-

is going on with you?!?" Theo hissed, astonishment quickly turning into anger. "All you do is write in that stupid book! You don't even look at me any more!"
“Yeah, sure of course...” Ugh. They both knew where this was going. “
THAT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
Then out of nowhere, shattering everyone's peace.
, you think you can do whatever you want without consequences. Psh.
Draco gagged, disgusted. You couldn’t trust these useless half-bloods to keep nasty images out of your mind.

word. I don't wish for you to die. I don't! " Nott shouted as doubt clouded over Draco's face. The tears were steady, but he didn't let them hinder his speech as he continue to say apology after apology. It was only when Draco showed no sign of forgiveness did he finally start sobbing. Not for long, however, as Draco placed a hesitant hand on his arm. And when he looked up, it was to a small smile.
He snapped back into reality when he realized the owner of the eyes was waving his arms, trying to gain his attention. With a blush he nodded, signaling that he was focused on him this time. Potter put his hands around his hair, they were a good 6 inches away from the actual thing. He mimed fluffing it around and about, sort of like an afro. Desperately searching Draco to see if he understands, he sighed and dropped his hands when confusion was evident on the blond’s facial features. He brightened up, though he did look more red in the face. He repeated the motion again and before Draco could get irritated, he did something new. Potter took fingers and made fangs with them in front of his mouth. Though, instead of placing them where fangs would normally reside, he put them near the center of his teeth. Weakly seemed to shout his name in surprise and Potter got more red. Finally, Draco understood. Big bushy hair, rat like teeth?

"Come with me to tip off Fil- nevermind! You've already helped so much!"
oh and they did the thing!!!!!! kiss!!!!!!!!!!
Theo's face turned red.
"You're so rude! I was talking you know!"
Draco snapped his mouth shut as a groan was heard from further in the room. He snapped his head in the direction and there he spotted Harry Potter. Draco felt instant shame in himself at his stupidity, thinking that this was a trap the whole time. He glowered at Madam Pomfrey who went to hover over Potter, not taking any notice at the now hurt and offended blond child.
“Go to your room,” Lucius finally spoke, “We’ll send Mipsy when dinner is ready.”
Because he cares for Theo.

happened while he was asleep.
"BITCH!" Theo screamed as he fell back, hovering his hand over his busted lip.
That's it. Draco didn't feel the need to say anything further. Harry was clearly very puzzled at what just happened. Theo spotted the confusion and jumped to help, "Oh Draco doesn't like speaking, so he doesn't." It was an acceptable answer right? It was correct even. So
...and gently pried Hermione's hand off his arm.
He turned to see Hermione looking at him with sad eyes, guiding him to where Weasley and her were standing, while the Golden Boy continued to scream at Theo.
While Draco was thinking, Potter was busy yapping about how “Yes I was absolutely a messenger” and “Yes I do need to get some dignity” and “Yes the only feelings I have for you are friendship feelings haha!”
, Draco thought as he panted, grabbing his heart through his uniform as it beat rapidly,
He turned away ready to fall asleep when the words that were being spoken caught his attention.
"Potter
Whoops teehee 🙈 at least year one is over!
"What were you dreaming about anyways? I couldn't get you to wake up for ages… " Theo questioned, making his way onto the bed and throwing the covers over the both of them. He reached to closed the curtains and turned back to Draco, waiting for his answer as if he didn't just make himself feel at home.

It's getting frustrating and annoying to be sitting in the back of the class,
Zucchini Smoth from Hufflepuff.
To see why he's always staring at him all the damn time.
“Harry,” Arthur started cautiously, “What are you doing talking to...
my brother broke my ipad, mom went into shock(she’s fine), someone almost broke into our home, AND a death in the family??? y’all wtf.
∆•∆•∆•∆•∆
“That’s because yours and Nott’s business was Nott bullying you! While no one else did anything about it!” Harry snapped back, standing up right and glaring into Draco’s soul, “I don’t know why you’re so upset with me helping you!” They stood staring at each other until Potter took on a concerned expression. Oh jeez.
"Were you going to tell Potter? " Theo repeated.
“Good job, Draco.”
Could he never escape Theo? For all the times Theo had ranted and complained about the early mornings, the crack of fucking dawn doesn't seem to bother him.
She released the breath she was holding when there was no objection to the use of his given name. Straightening up, she continued, “Have you seen Harry or Ron on board? I can’t seem to find them anywhere.” She deflated when he gave a shake of his head, and turned around to leave. The moment the door closed behind her, Theo shot up from the floor and immediately began cursing her name from hell and back. Again.
The bloody fool Lodbark has made it his personal mission to get Draco to speak. The only other thing he talked about during his Defense lessons (other than himself) was how Draco must be insecure of how his voice sounds and “There’s no need to be ashamed Mr. Malfoy, you may be a little young but, puberty hits us all in its own special way!”
Theo looked past Potter to stare hard at Draco, stupidly thinking that he was going to whole heartedly agree.
Neither had anything to say to that.
Draco managed to enlarge his font and capitalized his words just to be safe. He saw two impressed faces (though one was more reluctant than the other) and Potter even gave him a thumbs up and a bright smile. He tried not to preen hard enough for the both of them to notice. He placed the scowl back on his face and spelled out another sentence.
Theo bristled at that and sat up more in the bed, moving his face closer to Draco’s. “Well it could be a professor!”
This cause Pomfrey to frown.
Abruptly, the food on the table vanished and Theo realized with a sinking stomach (literally) that he ranted so much that he had forgotten to eat.
“Aww, how cute,” Theo mockingly cooed, “Potter’s got himself a
Moving back to Draco, he tried to carry the boy. The bleeding still going, regardless of the unmoving child. Theo tried to maneuver Draco in a way that won't stain his robes, but eventually resigned to the fact that that was near impossible. Carrying the child, he noticed the lack of weight he felt and a wave a guilt passes over him. He knew that Draco was skipping meals because of his work...
"Sit. Down."
The compartment was once more silent, Ron’s red face stared hard at Malfoy as his fists clenched at his side. Hermione looked down at the floor, refusing to show her tears. Harry wasn’t exactly sure how to feel. But, he knew that this was just part of the few layers he’ll have to tear down from the mystery named Draco Malfoy.
“Isn’t it time to drop the subtitles act with me, boy? When I speak to you, I expect to hear a verbal response.” Lucius admonished.
"You really shouldn't go inside." His voice was serious as all hell, face hard and weary.
The blood, however, waa as thick as tar. It was getting caught in his throat, making it more difficult to breath. After a couple minutes of coughing, he dropped to the ground, unconscious. Theo scrambled away, ready to start screaming for help, before memorising the words said to him only moments before.

Draco wonders,
Who does Theo think he is? On the train he was defending his honor for not speaking, now he a little bitch??
After most the whole class chanted back, they began to get to work. There were many pitiful attempts to make a simple feather float. Gray eyes surveyed the room in disdain.
"GRANGER DAMMIT!" Finally her eyes snapped to his, wide eyed and brimmed with tears. His voice slightly shook as he continued speaking, "We have to leave.

Draco went back to observing everything when a strange glint from a cabinet caught his eye. Not thinking, Draco crept forward towards it, his hand outstretched to pull the door open waiting to see-
The ground shook so hard Theo was barely able to stand up straight
Draco asked again, crossing his arms and staring adamantly at Potter, wait for his answer.
Theo wasted no time at all to start bawling. He wailed and wailed for Draco to get away from him, using this opportunity to push Draco away a little too hard.
He dropped into his chair, looking dazed as he tries (and fails) to stifle a large burp. Draco stared at his father in horror and dropped his sandwich back on his plate, appetite disappearing in a flash.
Draco began hesitantly. He nodded when Potters mouth snapped with a shut. Uneasy, he continued.
y’all i’m so sorry for how long it took to post this and how short this chapter is. all the protesting has been getting to me as a black female myself and it hurts me to see everything that’s going on. it was very hard to focus on anything at all as more and more black lives are joining heaven’s gates. i just have a few things to say. the whole blue whale thing disgust me. don’t open the messages delete them immediately if a account named jonathan something with a man dressed as a deformed goofy for a profile pic messages you DELETE IT.
So was Draco's essay.
.” Theo ‘discreetly’ glanced at Draco (really everyone saw) to see if he laughed at his oh so hilarious joke, only to find a thunderous expression on the blond’s face. Deflating, he turned back to Harry who was watching him with a smirk.

And socked Theo in the face.
And if a sleazy looking passerby heard a twelve year old boy let out a string of impressive curses... no he didn’t.
Eventually after what seemed like hours, (and maybe even was) Draco had passed out from the exertion. The room was silent for no one knew what to say
Theo began to fidget. He asked, "W-would you like to go outside?" Draco didn't say anything. He continued to look at Theo with dead eyes, and watched two red spots appear on Theo's cheeks. Before finally, one black word appeared above his head.
not to touch anything,” Lucius spat, words barely escaping his gritted teeth. He leaned in closer, snarling, “I would have expected this from Nott’s boy. Not you.” He let go and strode out the door without another glance back. Draco broke free from his shocked stupor to look at Theo, who had the audacity to cross his arms and shake his head at him. The traitor left to follow his father, nose higher than his ego. With a sigh Draco followed after, pausing to gaze back at a weeping Borgin and the strange cabinet.
"If you look directly into his eyes, he can kill you!"
“It’s the last day of school you poor boy, hopefully you still be able to make it to the feast.”
Draco wanted -no
No matter how bad Theo treated him, Draco would stay by his side. Always.

The way the blond boy was fuming would make any
Theo nodded his head, somehow undisturbed by the disgusting display.
Since Potter was no where near telling him who this admirer was, Draco would have to start thinking about it himself. And one person immediately sprung to mind. Oh no...
Draco truly did not want to be Theo's friend any longer.
With them seated, Dumbledore cleared his throat, and his speech began.
Winter Holiday has passed and Draco is still cooped up in the Hospital Wing.
“Wha-“ Immediately, Malfoy slapped a hand to his mouth, and for some idiotic reason, Potter did too. This interaction was just getting worse by the minute.
Draco shot back.
Caught, Malfoy turned slowly to Harry, his expression carefully blank but shoulders awfully tensed. Harry stopped in front of him wide-eyed and frazzled, it was most likely at this moment he realized he had no idea what he wanted to say.
He slowly turned around and was now eye to eye with him. Potter stood there shaking, color drained from his face and eyes wide and terrified. He tried opening his mouth, but no sound came out. Yeah... Draco wouldn’t know what to say either. He spoke, and Potter seem to flinch on instinct as the black words appeared in the air.
“You are vile and there is no way that Malfoy would ever go back to your sorry ass. Because Malfoy maybe the son of Voldemort,” Harry didn’t bother biting back his smirk when he saw Theo flinch, “Or maybe a Death Eater in training,” ‘Whatever the hell that is’ Harry thought, “But he in no idiot. And only idiots would go back to you.”
Draco's parents were flabbergasted. Never experiencing this when

"100 points from Slytherin."
Draco didn’t know that this was going to be so nerve wracking.
"I'm so worried about you. You walk around like a zombie and you don't eat anymore. The whole school thinks you're the one who's behind this but I
omg... 2100+ words!!!!
Wind howled in his ears, causing his eyes to water and stray strands of hair whip around wildly. So, Draco was not hallucinating like he had originally hoped. Really out in front of him was a flying car with two very stupid idiots inside. The pair of children spotted him, and actually had the audacity to wave. Well- Potter did. The orange one just turned red and closed his eyes. Which sent Potter into a panic because he was the one
Harry doesn't falter. He takes the steps two at time as Theo ventures back out into the sitting room. Pansy is curled protectively around Draco, whose eyes are closed, but is breathing heavily enough to indicate that he’s awake.
“I’m pretty good at that,” Draco says with a sigh.
Draco’s gaze snapped up, eyes searching Ginny’s for more information as to how she even knew. Had Harry really told everyone?
“Get him on the couch,” Harry commands Theo, passing Draco swiftly over like he’s a ragdoll. “I’ll get the kit.”
Harry began to protest as an older Healer all but threw them out the door. The room was quieter after Harry had left it.
“What do you mean?” Harry says back, his voice low. “I have the resources. She doesn’t have to live like this.”
He felt a wet heat press against his hole, and he let out a slow whine.
He walks forwardly slowly, like someone would approach an animal in the wild. But Draco doesn’t respond to him, and the toilet is almost sparkling clean. There’s a sheen of sweat slicked across Draco’s forehead, and his eyebrows are knitted together in discomfort.
Draco was still silent as he took a few more tentative bites of fish. Harry cursed himself for prodding at another wound but was eager to know the answer to his question anyway. “Can I ask you something?”
A moment of silence endures between them as Harry applies the last of the potion. The air in the room is charged with electricity, thick with unfamiliar tension.
“What?”
“I hadn’t really thought of that either.”
Two plates of some kind of roast appeared on the table in front of them, they smelled heavenly. Eventually, because of the temptation of food, Harry sat at the table. He still hadn’t spoken a word into existence, afraid of what provocation they might start. Malfoy was being polite, and Harry had no intention of ruining that. Yet.
Harry took a breath, grounding himself firmly into reality and extracting himself from a tangle of resentful thoughts that threatened to drown him. “I know that.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “I know I shouldn't blame Ginny for being a good friend.”
It doesn’t take them long to get to the landing with Draco dazed and pliant in Harry’s hands. Harry finds himself surprised at how okay he is with having Draco in his arms. How nice it feels to just touch someone like this, and care for them. The door to his bedroom is already open, streaming soft yellow light from inside. Harry takes him to the bed, pulling back gauzy curtains to reveal an unmade bed. There’s a tray in the middle of the sheets, with hardcover books stacked on top of one another. Harry pretends not to notice the baggies.
“Ah, well, no. We apparated there, but it was late, and these blokes were playing football, and it all happened very quickly after that,” Harry rushed out, still evading both of their gazes.
“Just stay...please?” Harry finds himself saying, his voice breaking just a bit in the process.
Draco thought of his mother sitting in the Manor’s sunroom on any given Saturday morning with her Kneazle splayed out in her lap as she sipped gently at a steaming cup of English Breakfast. Narcissa was quite like Luna in that way. Introspective, insightful, and a lover of animals.
Ron makes a face as Harry leaves the office. He’s glad to be walking a bit because his stiff limbs feel better when they’re moving. He’s noticed since seeing Draco that he’s physically feeling better. While his mood is nowhere near where it usually is, still, there’s something about his body that feels like it has somehow bounced back. He’s hungover, but he feels healthy and strangely complete for the first time in a bit.
“I’m not sure,” Narcissa says. “He’s not exactly in a state right now to be focusing on such things. That, I am certain of.”
“What do you think my mother is doing tonight?” Draco asks, leaning back against the headboard. His hands are in his lap, where he’s tracing patterns across the spine of a novel.
This man was much different than the shopkeeper Harry had encountered in Knockturn Alley that day. Where that man was quite reserved and notably sycophantic, this one was wild and manic. Almost unhinged in a way that made Harry want to turn and run from the room.
Harry clears his throat, taking another bite of stew. “Just fine.”
He had wanted to keep their terrible years to himself anyway, but in a strongly worded letter, he told Harry he would do so only if he sought out the help that he needed. It was clear the Imperioserum hadn’t only affected Draco’s mind.
Harry reached a hand out, placing it indifferently on Draco’s knee. It tightened as the seconds ticked by.
A few preset charms to the tent had banished noise from the other room and the commotion outside. Silence and tension were laden thick in the air.
Draco wanted to hit himself across the head with a solid object and searched the room for an item of his choosing. This was neither the time nor place that they usually conducted that sort of business. It was true that he often sprang sex upon Harry when he was in the mood, but it was always a quickie, and it was rarely in the comfort and intimacy of their sleeping space. Draco looked at the sunlight streaming through the window and winced. It was too bright in their room for sex anyway.
“Cats do love her, I don’t know why you expect any different,” Harry replies as they step off the elevator onto the department floor.
And though Harry can’t help but worry, he trusts Draco to be right.
Things were definitely not okay at home.
Harry felt his blood curdle at the thought. “So how has it been affecting me, then?” He managed, breaths growing ragged.
“You don’t want to do this,” he said, voice deadly calm.
“You did what?” Ginny yelps, tossing a coat in Harry’s direction. “Oi, shoes off the bed!”
“Draco,” Harry says.
“Who else would I be talking about, you idiot?” she snapped, but there was no bite behind her words. Genuine concern and worry spread across her face instead. “He’s not forcing you to stay, is he? I swear —”
“See, you’re dancing,” Draco whispers into his ear. “It’s that easy.”
Pansy shakes her head. “I did earlier this morning. I think he just wants to be alone.”
“Harry —” she muttered.
It’s enough to make Harry consider telling him right there, but he holds himself back.
Harry thought back to the recent month in which things had taken a literal turn for the worse. He’d been uncharacteristically aggressive toward his husband, so much so that his friends had begun asking questions. They worried about his presence in a room entirely. Draco always had a terrified look in his eyes, and it prodded at something deep and primal in Harry’s gut that he
Harry sucked in a breath, but Pansy was thankfully focusing attention elsewhere. “What do you mean?”
“No,” Harry said, his tone resolute and unfeeling. “This is lunacy, all of this is. Why were you even following me tonight? Something is wrong, Draco, but it’s got to do with you —”
“Okay, fuck, well what are we waiting for?” Theo asks.
Clove shook her head, clearly hiding amusement. “I’m saying that milk thistle could be extremely beneficial in your recovery, and I think there’s no harm in giving it a try.”
Harry frowns, looking down at his hands. “Maybe you should stop, then.”
Ron shrugs sheepishly. “Maybe. I mean, I’ve never been to one, if that helps.”
“Alright!” Malfoy stood abruptly from the table, kicking his chair back violently. “I’m feeling tired, I’m going to head back.”
There were also the deceptive qualities of glamours and Polyjuice to consider. Quite literally, no one in Knockturn could be taken at face value.
learn quite a bit, and I am confident in this. The class you will have refashioned will run as scheduled during our second and third terms.” McGonagall paused, as both Harry and Draco looked as they were about to interrupt, “You wouldn’t doubt my decisions, am I correct?”
Ron fiddled with the handle of the cup uneasily. “Draco was leaving you. He was going to go to Ginny’s, all that.”
wants to publish the story for tomorrow morning’s headlines, so we have to be quick.”
Someone had once told him that the most dangerous kind of man was one in denial.
“The what?” Harry was feeling increasingly removed, but Malfoy only continued. He chatted as if they had been familiars for years, and Harry’s discomfort only grew.
“Only the look on your face when you understand.”
The chilly autumn air nipped at their skin uncomfortably, turning the very tip of his Draco’s nose a soft red. Harry found himself wanting to reach out and poke at it but decided against it at the last minute. This was likely a wise decision because Draco was glowering once more into the shadowy distance. He took Harry’s elbow gruffly and apparated them with a crack to the outside of the entrance hall.
