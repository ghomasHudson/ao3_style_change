The thought of seeing Malfoy again today made a huge lump appear in Harry’s throat. Last night was different. Malfoy had chosen to visit Harry outside of work last night. It would be impossible to separate his poised healer from the ticking time bomb that he had dinner with last night. Who snogged him senselessly against his sofa cushions last night.
“Earlier today, Potter.” Malfoy’s spoke through slightly gritted teeth. To the normal eye, Harry surmised that Malfoy was the picture of composure and professionalism. Though it appeared Harry had been given a looking glass that allowed him to see beyond the illusion. Malfoy was nervous. He could tell by the flush that rested on the back of Malfoy’s neck, almost completely hidden by his jumper. His eyes were focused on the clipboard, but they were not moving, he was just staring at it.
Harry covered his face in his hands and groaned. Another sharp pain travelled through his torso as Harry tried to lean forward to adjust his position. Immediately knowing this was a bad idea, he leant back to his previous position with his spine against the metal railings of his headboard. “I brought up people from his past and blamed him for their actions. Not my proudest moment if I’m honest… He has every right to be angry with me.”
wandlessly sent a spell hurdling towards Harry’s chest. Harry braced himself for pain as the spell hit its mark, but felt the opposite.
Harry couldn’t see who was inside the room yet, but something in his brain clicked as he observed Kreacher’s behaviour.
Ginny’s giggles began to die down as she looked at Harry again. She watched Harry laugh fondly, a gleam sitting within her eye. “Draco has lost the plot Hazza. You’ve scrambled his brain like a bowl of eggs.”
Harry’s eyes snapped open and his face burned crimson. Malfoy stayed perched on the edge of the sofa with hugely widened eyes. His mouth was hung open in what Harry could only surmise as shock, and his wrist was still pressed against Harry’s crotch.
The hands slowly trailed down the ribcage, Malfoy still chanting the incantation, coming to rest on Harry’s waist. Harry wetted his lips, unable to regulate his shaky breathing. All too soon, the enchanting stopped, and Malfoy took a step back and Harry immediately noticed the absence of his touch.
The moments that followed Harry’s desperate release was always the same. The running of the water seemed to roar in his ears as Harry would pant with his eyes shut. He chest cavity would fill with the sudden, strong emotions of shame, longing and emptiness as his cock returned to lay limp again.
Harry pulled his hands away from his face to scowl at the witch. “That’s all you’ve got? The git won’t even touch me with a ten-foot pole now.” Harry’s pout deepened as he took a swig of his tea.
The rating of this story will go up when I start writing...  More age appropriate material if you catch my drift...
Draco agreed, clearly hoping for a chance to converse with him about Potter. And probably his task, he had not yet even tried to accomplish. It was for the better, for any plan he could come up after only two weeks was surely faulty.
Theo holds him back, before he can. As good as Draco is with his body, his gab has never brought him any plus points. He chimes in, murmuring almost tenderly. “He is right, Harry, let us take care of you. Relax, all is right. And you can stop it at any time. Okay?” When Potter hesitates, he gives him another reassuring look, adding a tiny sting: “You should manage at least as well as Finchley-Fletcher, should you? He was a bit anxious too...”
“How...” Draco started, interrupting himself then with a sigh. “A lot. But I was lucky. It could have been a bite from Greyback instead.”
The other Slytherin waves his hands softly, does just the tiniest of shrugs, not to disturbs his sleeping bed mate. “I know, Theo, I just... lost it, when the magic hit me.”
On the other hand: perhaps Poppy had been wise enough not to share the whole extent of Potter's ordeal with anyone, nor the fact that this of all things he could not have brought upon himself. For Minerva it might have seemed prudent to assume another of Potter's follies had led to this situation...
Suddenly all he wanted was leave Potter, leave the room to get away from this terrible sadness. It would have been irresponsible though. Potter might very well do something stupid. “You will get better soon enough” he said and it was almost a reprimand.
“You could take your chances. Try to escape the fate, take an easy way out and hope, your death sets it right.”
He's so responsive, so helplessly ill-equipped for their onslaught. Tries to remain silent, and can't, a constant stream of groans, whimpers and swearwords falling from his lips. And they haven't even properly started...
With a few angry steps, the robes billowing behind him, Severus bridged the distance between them. “Is that it? You are giving up? Rolling over to die?”
Voldemort's eyes narrowed, telling Severus, he fell further into disgrace, not despite but because he was right. The Dark Lord still nodded pensively, throwing a mock-disdainful look at the boy. “Very well.” He did not even fully look at the small figure as he threw the killing curse.
Then again the whole matter was somewhat a relief. With all this at stake and clearly coming to a conclusion before Draco's own time ran out there was now a chance he could leave all of this mostly unscathed. Shaken perhaps. Bare of his “first love”, but alive and well.
Their attempts on brewing the assigned potion of the day proved futile in most cases, when even the famed Ravenclaws could not be bothered with the intricacies of potion brewing. It left Severus plenty of time to brood over the problem of how to introduce both patient and companion to the prospect of spending time with the other, without jumping at each other's throats.
Potter took the book from his lap, closing it and putting it away, then stood up and faced him directly. “Pain, nightmares, occasional weakness, nausea, vertigo.” The dry tone of his voice was a first challenge after weeks without and Severus welcomed it.
Potter shakes his head. “That's not it, really... It's just...” He breathes out, leaving all his explanations to imagination. They might talk later... Once he can trust, they won't tell. It will be okay. For now, it is more important to get him back on track. “Want something from me?” Theo can sound quite seductive, if he just wants to. And with Potter still looking reluctant, insecure, he just massages his shoulders carefully, breathing soft kisses over his chest, smiling all the time, until Draco is back too.
His wand not being among them, would cause serious a problem, Severus would need to solve soon, but at least the situation was not as forlorn as Potter assumed. New wands were not easy to come by: their resonance with the wizard commonly lacked the natural feeling of the first wand. But they would serve the wizard nevertheless and judging by the deep and profound change of the young Mr. Potter in comparison to the child he had been, another wand might truly serve him better these days.
Harry asked, just an hour ago, would have declared the prediction, he might like anything like that insane. But now that it actually happens, it makes him awake and free and real. Pain doesn't bother him, pain is just part of his life, but the jolts of intensity, of sensation are too perfect to be anything but a dream, too primal to be anything but real. He didn't feel himself getting hard, but now, when Malfoy is moving, he can feel the friction and it hurts in all the best ways. He loses control over his breathing, if he ever had it in the first place and shivers, screaming, panting, crying for what Malfoy does to him. He doesn't even find it him to protest, no matter that he should, really, really should. Instead, he begs for more, groans in pleasure, when Malfoy's heavy body presses him down, his chest pulling uncomfortably at the shoulders through his bound hands, his legs tangling into Harry's his hard cock pressing against his already abused hole.
He does notice the hands, slipping down, parting his cheeks though and freezes, stumbling over his own breath. “Hell, Malfoy...” He barely manages the words, so out of breath is he, the inhales and exhale coming in nervous little gasps.
Severus shrugged. “I told you a lot of things. But you weren't listening. No matter what you want, no matter what you decide in the end, it never hurts to have a good view on your enemies. And to keep in mind that you can be stabbed from
And Severus knew he would. They had repeated the plan so often all of them could dream it in their sleep. All Severus had to do now was prepare the stage for the final act of the tragedy to unfold. Steeling himself against all sentiment he went towards the boundaries of Hogwarts and apparated, reappearing at Malfoy Manor as expected.
Things rarely happen like they are supposed to. You might think of this as the climax and end of the story. And in a way it is. If that was, what you are after, all good ones alive and such... here you are. But I would hope, you bear with me and read on to get the whole story. I promise, it will still be worth your while.
“I'll handle it. Just keep Minerva and her annoying lions out of my way.” He knew it wasn't enough to appease the old wizard,so he added, if disgruntledly: “Potter might well be the Dark Lord's downfall sooner than we expect.” And wasn't that bitterly true?
And Severus not been on the receiving end of this quite enough to know how it felt? How destructive it could be? Revisiting, what he knew of the past years he understood more and more, so had Potter.
He started to study the parchment the prim teacher handed him and found little need for corrections.
He extended the same offer to Severus, who gladly took it, for it gave him what he most needed now. Peace and quiet and time. To think, to recover, to figure out, what to do now.
Minerva shrugged, obviously relieved not to take responsibility for the catastrophe bound to happen, Poppy seethed in silence, and he... started to plot. He had three days to arrange for an incident, rendering all these considerations useless in favor of a more sensible path.
To her honor she did not bat an eye, when he entered, asked no questions, when he ordered everyone out, who was unwise enough to require medical attention this early in semester. She did, however, gasp in shock, when he revealed his fragile charge, laying him out on one of her beds with utmost care to cause no more damage than already done.
He cannot help but smile, when Potter's head falls back dreamily, though the smile goes certainly smug, once the Gryffindor winces, as he feels the soreness of his body. At least, he isn't all messy anymore. Draco cleans bed mates quite thoroughly... He does take some pity however, grabs his wand and runs some simple healing spells, they learned, just for this occasion. It certainly helps Potter back to better mood.
And thus time collapsed into a focal point when he was called again. This, this was the moment of truth. Ignoring tears and cold sweat, moans and whispers, he finished his preparations, then turned to leave. “When Draco is called, be ready.”
It was to no avail as Potter lost his fight for composure bit by bit. Making himself sick, he inevitably leaned onto the cot heavily, swaying. Some kids in that state responded well to a well-placed slap. The sudden shock pulled them out of their stupor and made them responsive again, willing and above all
First he stepped behind Potter's back, relishing his nervous tension, and ran his hands contently over the smooth skin. He liked the way, muscle after muscle twitched under his fingers, and chose not to comment. Instead, he circled to Potter's front, slapping him in the face, once, twice. “Is this, what you want?” He scoffed. “Do you really believe, it will prepare you for anything?” He underlined his last word with a jab to the stomach that would have had Potter bending over, if not for the tied hands. “Answer me.”
With Potter blushing even harder Severus knew it was pointless to make Draco see. He knew already the chances were non-existent, but found his strength in fighting for them anyways. In a way he, this..., felt more adult than Severus had ever given him credit for.
The edges of the picture he did not quite see still irritated him. Swollen lips and bright eyes. Dark smudges near the collar. Whispers and gasps just inside his earshot. Hands and eyes locking.
No. That was exactly the mindset that had caused this situation. Albus' belief to do the right thing, his ultimate conviction that the ends justified the means.
With only two fingers, standing back as far as possible, he threw the door open and was subsequently hit with a stench that more than made up for its weak warning. It was harsh and bitter and dirty. It smelled of blood and death and things Severus desperately tried to forget. Somehow it was made worse by the fact that he could not see much with what little light reached beyond the open door.
Severus understood if involuntarily. For the time being it probably felt as if his return had only continued his suffering. “What have you seen then?” he distracted the boy.
Uneasily he sat down on the bedside chair and stroked the still unwashed and stiff hair until the tension in the boy's body dwindled and the harsh breathing stilled. He could not caress away all the shivers nor the horror in Potter's eyes, but at least he ensured, the boy wouldn't hurt himself further in the false pretense of danger.
He pondered over it while eating, then headed over to Potter's room after banishing the dishes back to the kitchen. It was not unexpected anymore to see Potter with a book, the new wand tugged safely against his stomach as if he was scared of losing it too. On Severus' entry he looked up, hiding his anxiety behind a mask of disinterest as soon as he managed. “Professor?”
It's not, what Theo would have wanted to hear and it most certainly isn't what Potter wants to hear, as he goes stiff as a stick, swallowing harshly and trying to turn nervously.
“Or we figure out a combination of spells. We have to assume he made more than just you and the diary. We can bind them all together and destroy them at once.”
Severus saw the quick swipe of his fingers over Potter's arm, soothing, reassuring, but he doubted anyone else would have noticed. Voldemort certainly didn't. “Rise, my faithful servant,” he commanded with radiant glee, his eyes all but devouring both boys with predatory intensity.
The Dark Lord fell to the ground, and an uproar began, screams and shouted spells flying around the room. Bellatrix fell to the floor, weeping “my Lord, my Lord” before gazing at Severus with unrestrained hatred. A stray curse stupefied her before she could do more.
In the meantime, dividing his time between teaching imbeciles and checking on a patient, who, if he opened his eyes at all, only stared at the ceiling, and confiding with Poppy on their path forward, Severus found a surprising solace in his tasks. As if the disgraces of his daily life shrank to insignificance in the light of his own shortcomings and dark regrets. Better to think of Longbottom's abysmal potion, which to everybody's astonishment didn't blow up, than of a broken body found on the floor of a locked cupboard. Better to recall even the dullest of recipes than the memory of a body too light for what he was meant to weigh. Always too light, always too small. For years.
The Dark Lord had always had his favorites for this kind of torture, who were both unlucky enough to fall first and lucky enough not to stay fallen. Long ago, there had been Regulus Black and until recently Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father, but the first had been dead for ages and the second was now imprisoned in Azkaban, leaving both of them severely unavailable and rendering this game even less predictable.
Potter shook his head impatiently. “There is nothing else? How very creative...” His eyes met Draco's and for a long moment neither spoke as they fought a silent duel. Green against grey.
But this can't wait. If Potter disappears, they will never again have this, have him. Or anyone really. It is all a question of honor, and if they screw this up, that's forfeit. So he doesn't hesitate but slips through the slightly ajar door, searching the outside, lying in the faint light of the moon, until he sees some movement.
Potter huffed and unfolded his body and legs into a more dignified position. “Really? You want to hear more of that?” It was no wonder he very well remembered when he had had no one else to speak to, quite in contrast to Severus. “You want to hear how I left you behind, knowing I could do nothing more for you?” He sounded angry and sad and inexplicably guilty as he looked directly at Severus with a determination he had never shown before, not even when he had still been “Hero Potter”.
Potter's hands fell down and he rubbed the chaffed wrists. “Perhaps we... could try the bed, next time?”
A few days after Harry's sixteenth birthday people got nervous. Three weeks after his birthday they began to ask questions. One month after the date everyone felt, something was completely wrong. One month and a day it became painfully obvious: Harry Potter had not returned to Hogwarts. The boy who lived was missing.
“Very simple. No outside rivalries, house or personal, we are here for fun, after all. No fighting, no insults, no politics. And above all: no blabbing about it. Secret neutral ground.” He smiles encouragingly and takes Potter's hand, dragging him softly forward. Hesitantly he follows, swallowing in excitement.
What? Theo frowns, looking at Draco in confused irritation. He had felt something building, after Potter's climax, but “magic hitting him” would not have been a fitting description, even when exaggerating matters.
Severus tsked, showing no signs of anger or forgiveness. “It is advantageous to have you both present for the time being. I won't have to explain things twice.” He halted watching both Draco's frown and Potter's hopeless anticipation.
A sudden loud hiss made Severus turn, and with him everyone in the room. Voldemort's gigantic pet snake Nagini rose from the ground, seizures running along the muscular body. They forced it up and down, back and forth in mockery of a sensual dance, as the same runes Severus had so carefully painted appeared on its skin.
But that's beside the point. The moment, Potter fully relaxes, is out of this world, he can't help it anymore. “Are you out of your mind, Draco?”
She did not find the right comparison, and Severus helped out: “As if something is robbing his strength away?”
Theo looks him up and down thinking. “I check the grounds, you do the floo. You have a better connection to Snape, just in case.” And it is safer to run outside, anyways, in case any teachers are still around. Draco can rely on his father to be kept out of trouble. He... can't.
“It's probably better then, that I didn't end up in Slytherin, after all... I am far too trusting still.”
From time to time he tries to reciprocate, his hands sliding over their skin, his mouth soft and wet and hot on their skin, but he isn't prepared for them. Again, a pleasant deviation from the expected path of the evening. Again a hint, something does not quite add up.
“What is of such ultimate importance to justify the insolence you presently show, Ms. Granger?” he asked leaving no doubt whatsoever, he would accept no excuse for her disturbance short of immediate doom.
The thing he had not, could not have calculated was Draco's tendency to defy anything not playing out in his favor. Severus could have sworn he was at least as stubborn in his insistence as Potter himself. “I refuse to believe that. You are Harry fucking Potter. You have defeated him as a toddler. You have defeated him at what... eleven? You can do it again. And better now!”
“I fully understand your need to punish misbehavior. But is the boy really worthy of your attention? When no one but your faithful servants who need no more demonstration will ever know?”
If all the constant fuss about Potter had not been enough to anger him, this was perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back. Sending Severus Snape to some muggles to straighten the great savior out and trim his ego. At least, he was well-fitted for the task.
That was one way to put it, and so typical for his usual dismissal of anything unpleasant it made Severus even more furious than he already was. Funny that now Dumbledore benefited from the restraint, Severus had learned to face his opposing counterpart. “Clearly Potter is not ready for a normal school day again” he said bluntly, omitting: “And never again will be.”
Severus came to the conclusion that it was rather lucky, this had happened at the start of the semester, before those stocks of potions could be depleted. It still left him with a lot of work, both to replace the used potions and brew new, more specialised ones to avoid sepsis, strengthen the body and give rest to both the vulnerable physis and frightened mind.
Potter gave him a nod and a forced smile, though Severus saw clearly he was just indulging him. Potter knew. Not precisely, like in how it would happen or by what kind of magic. But the strength he fought for so hard each day dwindled, despite his body's returning health. Severus was impressed Potter chose to face the truth instead of lying to himself. Most would have wallowed in comfortable ignorance until it was too late.
“I will make up for it as soon as I can.” She hesitated, the next words clearly leaving her worried. “He should be stronger by now. It's unsettling. As if...”
Lucius had never been light on his son, but even Draco had no answer to that. “I got to go” he announced detachedly and fled the room, relieved to see his godfather waiting for him. “Good night, Severus.”
With Gryffindor courage and little grace, Potter pulls robes and shirts over his head, not bothering with separating it from the undergarments. The worn out edge, Theodore notices tells a lot about the why, although the conclusions again, do not fit his picture of the perfect Potter. It's nice though. Somehow, it makes him more relatable. As does the sheepish, jerky motion, when he pulls his pants down and balances on one leg to pull them of the other, socks and all. The low lighting compliments him, creates shadows on his skin, leaving everything to imagination and creating the wish to explore with fingers, what the eyes can't make out. It's a pity he slips between the blankets with abashed hurry.
On instinct Severus grabbed his wand, pointing at the slowly reviving body. Suddenly, stirring Draco from his grievous stupor, the boy raised his hand, the right unblemished one, Severus noted. “Don't...” he pleaded, the voice warm and soft, but with hoarse edges, that would never leave him again.
He got up again and, totally ignoring Severus continued presence, left the room towards the kitchen. There Severus found him leaned against the hearth, trying to absorb its warmth. “When he asks...” Potter didn't mention a name. Did not need to. “Tell him I died.” It sounded suspiciously like “I soon will”.
So instead of lashing out, Theo just grins. “One would think, we were a little more substantial than a dream...”
The problem, Severus soon realized, wasn't to cause just any incident. Potter, though physically stable enough, if not forced into long walks or, worse, flying, was anything but that mentally. The silence, common in Severus' rooms, had rarely been broken, the boy treading lightly in his every move, waiting for the next strike. Even after weeks in Severus' care, trust was hard to come by and the smallest of provocations made him seek cover in the storage room, not to be seen again unless forced out for the meals.
In passing their eyes met just for a split-second, and for the first time since his death. Potter stumbled and paled, averting his eyes with near-panicked hurry. Severus' hand shot out and grabbed his chin, forcing him back mercilessly. “What is it?” he asked, emphasizing every single word.
The headmaster strolled in, greeting with a nod. “I was informed the visitations of Harry went less than ideal...”
“Time for your potions” he eventually stated calmly and unstoppered the bottles. It almost hurt to see the boy turn resignedly, the eyes already wide in fear of the pain to come.
When he opened the door, though, he was surprised by some unexpected noises from the storage room. Silently he sat down, willing himself to first listen.
The boy shrugged, oscillating between some kind of amusement, worry and relief. “Right into the topic, Professor? No. I haven't. The obvious aside.” He was by far more comfortable talking about this then the other part of the news yesterday brought.
Draco nodded and stood up, meeting his gaze only shortly, before looking away lest the Dark Lord found the spark of hatred and disgust in his grey eyes. “I live to serve, my Lord.”
She confirmed it. “Of both kids. “She handed him the files, uncomfortable with talking about it openly when everyone could walk in at any time. “It was more mortifying than dangerous this time.” She spoke softly and added: “There might however be still a lot of bone splinters we don't know about and which might get dislodged at any time.”
Draco's eyes shoot up towards his own, undecided, if they should look impressed or disgusted. “You hate him.”
“That won't work, Potter, and you know it. That's just pain and you can handle pain. That's not the fear, the helplessness, the shame, you would need to endure.” Draco licked his lips nervously , unsure, why he was even still part of this conversation. Then again, a sense of foreboding, of strange anticipation settled in his chest.
Unsurprisingly it was Malfoy Manor, where the Dark Lord had taken quarter over the summer. Unsurprisingly, too, he was not in the best mood, or maybe he was, for it never seemed to get any better than that. One way or the other, it was going to be a wholly unpleasant evening, an impression he clearly shared with even the most fearsome attendees, Fenrir Greyback and Bellatrix Lestrange, though they weren't prone to show it. Rabastan Lestrange and most of all Pettigrew, this pathetic excuse for a human being, placed themselves in the background immediately to stay on the safe side. Severus chose the middle ground for himself, knowing that at times, Voldemort's greatest pleasure seemed to be to drag those out of the shadows, who thought they were hidden best. Since his rebirth and bodily reincarnation as part snake, it got even worse and Severus wasn't fond of being on the receiving end of the Dark Lord's curses.
Severus gagged and tried to breathe through the mouth, while searching for a light switch, failing to find it and then casting a Lumos instead. The moment, he was able to guide the light into the small room, he lost his concentration and it flicked out. He frantically tried to suppress the urge to vomit. Perhaps, in his days as a death eater and spy for the Order of Phoenix he
Theo actually rises to study that sight some more, still doubting his eyes, as that was something he never believed to happen. Potter half draped over Draco, the eyes drooping, the body melted into full relaxation, and his friend protectively closing an arm around the dark-haired boy. It pretty much sums up, what Theo knew that neither of them would ever, ever admit, even to themselves.
Just like the distorted mirror image of Dumbledore who also only acknowledged what he wanted to hear Voldemort grinned, the snakish lips spread impossibly wide. “I shall test your promises and reward you befitting to their outcome.”
Severus shook his head, giving a sideways look towards Potter she could not misunderstand. “Nothing new but...” He raised one eyebrow in worry. “He's been in pain and there is something. In his eye.” It took a lot more of his restraint than usual to remain impassive.
The Potter boy pleaded with his eyes, but offered no explanation. “You'll see, when you get them. They are under the floor boards, where... where I...” He could not say it, and Severus understood.
Draco and Potter... Of course he knew of Draco's preferences. Who in Slytherin wouldn't after that Zabini-incident. But as per usual for their secretive House, things had been handled in all silence and both parties had been sworn to more subtlety. Potter was quite a different matter. He had only dated girls if at all as far as Severus was aware, which wasn't all that much frankly. In truth the boy had never been a particularly active participant of the school's rumor mill, which was remarkable given his popularity. Maybe this was the reason.
“I don't think this is a good idea, Severus,” he said. “I hate Potter. Potter hates me. What do you hope to achieve?”
Theo knows, Draco swings that way, likes it to be in charge, likes it to make all the decisions, likes to add a little pain, a little power. But he has never broken the unspoken rule before: never without discussing the deal first. Never without safety net. Granted, this is Potter and Potter has always been a bit of a sore point for Draco. But falling so completely out of their rule-set is unlike him.
Draco wouldn't hear it. Cupped his cheek in one desperately possessive gesture, leaning in to take the kiss Potter would not give him.
Instead, he decided, that beating Potter would result in nothing, and settled for something quite different, that most men found much harder to deal with. He let the cane fall, then mock-tenderly slipped one hand against Potter's jaw and into his hair, his other arm pinning the resisting body to his own. When he ran his tongue along the earlobe and dipped it in then, leaving wet traces in its wake, Potter's breath hitched.
Of course, Blaise compensates, pointing Potter back down, halts to gain back his bearings, which is exactly, what Theo was waiting for. With a simple movement of his wand he points down too, making Potter glide to the ground slowly.
And isn't he right about that one... Pity really, if he would have got messed up too early for them...
This Potter used what little strength he had for study, the face always worried, the eyes dull and hollow, the demeanor meek.
Blaise tries to create a good balance, keeping Potter at the same height all the time, so for the time being, Theo pulls him up. Not to much, just a little bit, so that Blaise does not realize yet, he messes with him.
seen worse, but neither so suddenly nor on a living person, and very especially not on the one person, who should have been kept safe for his importance in beating the Dark Lord.
Potter wouldn't know, but Severus could hear the lack of sincerity, when Draco feigned exasperation. “Fine. I have no classes. But I need to work.” He stopped shortly, adding then,in an afterthougt: “Potions essay.”
Until he was summoned, that is. Severus contented himself with the fact that he had been wise enough to plan ahead, but did not like the plan any better for it. Draco alone with Potter, giving him the damn potion at least once. But the Dark Lord's call left no time for considerations. He put an enchanted note for his godson into his room and went to leave the grounds of Hogwarts as soon as he could, apparating to where the Mark called him.
The latter leaned against the wall with a sunny smirk and not even the slightest hint of embarrassment. Quite in contrary he had no intention to hide his eyes still almost devouring the other boy's neck. “I brought the homework...” he practically dared Severus to call him out.
Kreacher's voice faded as Potter touched his face with terrible gentleness and pinned his gaze. “Yes...” Potter whispered, the tone so tender like speaking to a sick child. .”I'd thought you'd prefer that.” His hands, acting almost on independently from the rest of his body now, caught Kreacher's fingers and stroked them softly while the house-elf, unused to such treatment, stood petrified. Potter planted a soft kiss on Kreacher's forehead as he spoke again. “I hereby task you to take care of Lucius Malfoy as soon as he returns from Azkaban. You will tend to his needs as he will need you but I will be your Master. I am from now until the day you die.” With a strangled, shivering sob he stood up again and left the house-elf's proximity, the movements jerky and wooden, the grace lost.
It was hours later, when he first returned to the Infirmary, both to check on the boy and hand over his first successes. Poppy wasn't present, but Minerva sat beside the bed, tight and stiff as a stick. When she saw him, she nodded, not bothering to hide the harsh lines of concern in her face.
This of all things at last produced a reaction, a small mischievous smile, barely covering more than the eyes, but still too valuable to dismiss. “I appreciate your efforts.” The corners of Potter's mouth twitched. “I'll leave the Floo open for you. One never knows.”
Of course, and it was always like that, Severus could not remain undisturbed. He was barely starting to dive deeper into the matter when someone knocked at the door. Annoyed he covered the most obvious hints of what he was working on and marked the pages of all the books with a wave of his wand before returning them to their places in the shelves. Getting up he then unlocked the door, facing the probably least appreciated company for the moment. “Albus...”
All three share a silent, knowing laughter, but it is Draco who answers as Harry still rarely ever speaks when there is nothing to say, nothing to see. “Tell them thanks, but we are quite busy as it is.” And they are. He knows. Between their own kids, caring for abandoned or mistreated wizarding children, both pure-blood and muggleborn, and campaigning for decent protection laws, the rest is fully dedicated to each other. And he is happy for it. One can't hold a grudge forever.
Theodore is surprised by that.. One would think, Potter has had really everyone, with blatant exception of the Slytherins. Well, maybe he didn't dare try that particular kind of pastime before, what with his image of being the spearhead of morality and jolly goodness. A screwed world view, but then... these times everything is screwed. “You ok?”
The answer, shivering and so low, he considered another Sonorus, wasn't quite what he expected. No anger, no resistance, nothing at all but only: “Water... please...”
“Gentle...” Potter said dreamily. “Soothing. Calm.” Unmistakable longing soaked his words. Now at last he looked up to Severus. “There is no pain.”
Severus had a good idea on that but did not tell him, in part because he really couldn't. Grimmaulds Place 12 was his first bet as it lay abandoned ever since the dog had died and the wolf moved out to flee from the memories. It was no good place for Potter and it would be a worse place even for Draco. Until the Fidelius was undone however, he had the best excuse to keep him away. Draco threw him a wary look. “You know something.”
Then Severus went on to speak with his godson who was clearly in need of some directions. The earful he wanted to give him withered away though when he entered the room and recognized how miserable Draco looked, sitting by his desk, hunched over the papers. He didn't even look up, when he breathed out: “I can't do it...”
Severus would need to correspond with Olivander on the matter and force him to swear complete confidentiality. The rest of Potter's things, the sentimental value aside was easily replaceable. He would make sure to order in sufficient amounts on behalf of the school to conceal the actual usage, sure that Albus would not refuse this. He was just as keen on keeping this secret as Severus. And should he be more stubborn than expected, Severus would not refrain from blackmail either.
Severus was used to suppressing his feelings and did not want to change that now, but still felt the distinct urge to destroy something. Something expensive with a nice sound preferably. Instead he shook his head and prepared himself some tea. He would not be able to continue his work any time soon and could not risk stupid mistakes due to a lack of concentration. So he forced himself to relax, rest, do some well-needed self-preservation. He was fully aware this could not go on for much longer for it was wearing him down. It did the same to the boys who were much less used to this kind of pressure. Merlin knew when they would crack. Somehow he wasn't worried though. They had managed to this point, the would manage the rest. If only he played his part.
Potter nodded, his nervousness finally getting the better of him and his voice therefore failing. Slowly, hesitantly, he removed his wand from his pocket and placed it on a nearby drawer. Another nod served as signal to begin.
Still the boy didn't move, unwilling or unable to stand up immediately, and only nodded in silent approval.
“Potter is a danger to himself and others as you should be fully aware by now” he spit out without preface.
“Any advice?” It sounded desperate and young, reminding Severus he was still dealing with two boys, not grown men.
“Yours...” It was a squeak, boyish, pained. A sign that below his cold composure and his returning health the boy was still breaking down bit by bit.
Poppy grimaced. “I am no auror, Severus. It was dark. That is all I can say.” She looked at him apologetically. “Should I have involved someone more proficient?”
“Yeah yeah, we’re coming. Merlin, you’re needy, you know that?” Draco complained, stepping on the dead troll to reach Neville. Ursa stepped on the troll right after Draco did, and just before she could jump down from its back, there was a scream from the door.
“It wasn’t meant to be insulting,” Blaise started, “I grew up with Draco, his folks weren’t around much, so he kind of clings. Being affectionate is how he specifies something is special to him, he’d do it with toys and books so I wouldn’t take them. And Ursa doesn’t seem like she gets affection at all, I mean for the first couple weeks at Hogwarts she flinched whenever you waved a hand at her. I think she’s just enjoying having someone give her that, like Neville said it doesn’t mean it’s romantic.”
“Yeah, and now we both have detention for two weeks,” Draco scoffed, starting to pick at his food, “At least we have them with different teachers, I think I’d kill myself before spending that much quality time with Weaselby.”
“Alright, just sprint into that brick column, it’ll feel weird and every instinct is going to tell you to stop before you collide, but ignore it and go anyway,” Draco instructed, waving a hand in the direction of the aforementioned column.
The Yule holidays were soon approaching, and unlike her fellow peers, it seems as though Ursa will be confined to the castle for a couple weeks. She seems the only member of Slytherin cursed with the lack of responsibility or drive to return home, as all her classmates eagerly discussed their Yule plans with each other. She didn’t mind, though, while she enjoys the presence of Neville and Draco, and the budding companionship of Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Susan Bones, and Padma Patil, she wouldn’t mind the break to just read and wander around. It’s been awhile since she truly had time to herself, maybe this break will be good for her.
“What is with you today?” She finally broke, standing up, “Going to ask me why I wore a sweater instead of a parka, or perhaps you need to know why I like blue more than yellow?”
“That bad?” He asked, and she looked past the tip of her book to see the potentially content expression from a minute prior gone.
“Thought I’d find you here,” an older man’s voice rang out, easily disrupting her already distracted thoughts.
“Miss Potter! Mr. Malfoy! What do you think you’re doing?” Professor McGonagall looked like a heinous crime was committed in front of her.
History of Magic was a let down of let downs. When Ursa heard a ghost taught the class, she was excited like the rest of her class, stupidly thinking that they’ll have a first hand account of what history was like. Instead, they received oblin war after goblin war. Binns doesn’t even mention what war, it’s just a goblin war. Ursa pulled out a history textbook and started taking notes from that instead, while Draco and Neville followed suit. The three played games like hangman and tic-tac-toe in the margin of her notes’ parchment to pass the time.
She dutifully followed beside him, carrying books he pulled from the shelf and forcing herself not to sneeze when dust violated her nostrils. It was clear he’s the only one who knows these books exist, as the layer of grime built up had to be several decades old.
“Uh, my grandmother wants me to go into Gryffindor,” Neville went a little pink with attention on him. Draco informed Ursa of Lady Augusta Longbottom’s personality when they briefly ran into her in Diagon Alley, and now Ursa felt a little pity for the boy.
Susan got her a cute owl stuffed animal, that looked remarkably similar to her own owl, and a large bag of candy. Ursa is going to have a cavity by sundown. She sent Susan a gold necklace adorned with yellow rhinestones, as well as matching drop earrings, and a flower brooch she thought the Hufflepuff would like.
After class, Draco complained about how the school got rid of Samhain in favor of the more muggle friendly Halloween while the two walked to the Great Hall for the holiday dinner. Neville left to grab a book from his dorm and use the bathroom. Ursa would’ve gone with him to grab more ink from her trunk, but the thought of going to the castle dungeons made her want to vomit for some reason.
“What contrast?” She asked, innocently. Draco's mouth twisted into a scowl, and she felt immense delight.
noise of her feet on the dead, stone floors reverberated off the ornate walls, no body to absorb the sound and no soft chatter to join its waves. Returning to her bedside she inspected the tall stack of wrapped boxes and decorated bags, all addressed to her wishing her well. She wasn’t expecting them, truthfully, and it’s taking time for her to work up the courage to open them. A part of her didn’t want to touch them, preserve them in the state she found them, but she knew her friends would kill her for not seeing what they got her, and she would feel worse not respecting the effort they put into finding something for her.
“I wonder what the greenhouses look like,” Neville said, on the other side of Ursa. She vocally agreed with him as a fellow Herbology nerd. Ursa enjoys gardening, Aunt Petunia’s backyard bed being her pride and joy, so therefore gardening mixed with magic
At dinner, Neville and her were doing Herbology work while Draco read against Ursa’s side. He was livid. While Ursa didn’t care for Snape’s pettiness, she wasn’t that affected by it other than this one detention, so usually when class ended she got over it quickly. Until Snape permanently disfigured the skin behind her ears due to a rush to straighten her hair before a show, he had nothing on Petunia. Draco, however, has been stewing in an unrelenting resentment for his godfather’s behavior. He apparently thought the older man was better than that, and hoped that he would treat his friends better. She didn’t bother Draco, just occasionally bumped his shoulder with hers to remind him that they’re there. They had finished eating when Professor Quirrell approached us.
“I’m a teacher, Ursa, but I’m not too fond of kids. I enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge, but not somehow keeping Mr. Finnigan from decimating my classroom with his adolescent pyrotechnics,” he deadpanned, and smiled hearing Ursa snort, “So, I usually keep a couple handy in case it’s been a rough day and I run into Severus.”
Draco found an empty compartment in the Slytherin section of the train, his father insisted they sit there. Ursa let Edgar roam free, having snuck the smaller crow in the train via large pocket with the command to be quiet. He perched on her knee and fell asleep while she read a book on hexes and jinxes. Draco sat across from her and reread his first year potions textbook, his feet propped up on the seat right beside Ursa, close enough she could use his left foot to prop up her book. For a solid twenty minutes it was quiet, Draco and Ursa giving each other the silence to read, when a knock sounded on the door. Ursa looked up to see a cute, honey-blond haired boy who was a tad on the heavier side with a red face in the doorway. Draco and her shared a look before looking back at the boy with raised eyebrows.
“Boys! That’s enough,” Madam Hooch hollered, “When I blow this whistle, you are to kick off the ground while straddling the broom. You will hover a couple inches, and then you will lower to the ground again, is that understood? Good, three, two—“
“Wow, that’s actually an improvement, what a shame,” Draco sighed morosely, but couldn’t contain a smirk seeing a vein throb in Weasley’s temple.
“Now you know why I don’t assign essays often,” he sighed, dropping the parchments in frustration and opening his desk. He pulled out a vial and swallowed its contents quickly.
“If you’d like me to, I’ll go to the Hospital Wing with you to get a pepper-up potion,” Draco reassured, starting to mess with the hem of Ursa’s robe sleeve.
“I’ll tell you a little about my childhood, then, since everyone and their mothers seem to think they know yours. My mother was a pure blood, who had a rather unrequited affair with a muggle she seduced with potions. He left and she had to give birth to me alone, but she didn’t survive the ordeal. I grew up in an orphanage where the children hated and feared me. I was lonely and ridiculed, avoided at all costs by the children who had any semblance of self preservation, and bullied by the children who didn’t. Those children didn’t last long, however, and eventually their bodies would be found mutilated somewhere on the property grounds,” the professor took a deep breath, “So, I’d say we’re able to understand each other.”
“From someone with a muggle background, I understand why muggleborn students would prefer muggle holidays—if you don’t want to celebrate the holiday then don’t, just respect the wizard culture,” Ursa struggled to put her thoughts into words, and she feels like she didn’t quite hit the mark.
“I didn’t think that old fool would order Slytherins back to the dungeons. I apologize, kiddo,” Quirrell’s voice was soft and reassuring.
“There’s my uncle, Severus,” Draco pointed out to the other two, partially as a distraction for Neville, and Ursa followed his line of sight to a rather sour looking man. His face was pinched in what she could only guess was a mixture of pure, unadulterated exasperation and frustration as he eyed the trio. Draco had expressed his idolization of the man many times, and she knew that he’s the reason he wants to be a Potions Master. They didn’t dwell on Snape’s clear disapproval much, as the sorting had begun, but Ursa mentally clocked out after “Abbot”.
also apologies for the standard, in your face, out of nowhere character description in the beginning of the chapter, it will definitely happen again
had, without the tough skin to protect against the spell, it had the intended effect of destroying whatever it hit by essentially disemboweling it. The bone didn’t provide much protection, and the shattered skull fully exposed the jumbled, bloody mess that used to be the creature's brain. Ursa suddenly felt lighter, the image before her took a slimy weight sludging through her veins away and she nearly started skipping, if it weren’t for the yet lingering discomfort of being in the dungeons.
“W-well, what d-do-do you m-me-mean?” He’d asked, seeming curious while several other members of the class laughed.
“Miss Potter I think there was a criminal error in your sorting,” Professor Quirrell sighed, exasperated, but he was still smiling and he seemed genuinely pleased, “I do believe Ravenclaw’s house would benefit greatly from you.”
The fish continued to swim in their lake, while Ursa made her own in the third room down the second hall on the right.
also im sorry to people who love ron and hermione, i love them too theyre just the easiest to bully here lmao
“Alright then, come with me, my parents gave me directions since they’re busy and couldn’t make it.”
“Eat dung, Malfoy!” Weasley shouted back, his face turning an ugly maroon with their classmates’ attention on him.
The word lit a fuse at the Slytherin table, and in no time flat the explosives went off. The table inhabitants were practically screaming, and she heard two boys angrily shout “They got Potter!” from the other end of the hall. A malicious smirk took hold of Ursa’s lips, a sick form of pleasure came from disappointing so many people, and in such a splendid fashion. She took her seat between the two boys, and listened to Dumbledore’s speech before food appeared on the previously empty plates. Students helped themselves at Dumbledore’s behest, but Ursa only ate a little soup before turning to talk to her companions.
“You two are such dorks,” Draco sniffed. Ursa gave him a nasty look and he snorted, unaffected, but at least the exchange got Neville to smile a little, easing his nerves. Neville doesn’t like boats, the other two figured out.
there are two wolves inside of me. one wants to write angst for the drama. the other wants pure fluff to satisfy my trust and commitment issues. I am mentally ill.
Ursa’s alarm blared like a wrecking ball smashing through a poorly put-together wall of plastic cups that was unconsciousness. She cast a
“Neville Longbottom,” he replied, and Draco nearly snorted before Ursa gave him a sharp look. A Longbottom sounds useful.
The cold, teal light of Ursa’s dorm washed the room in a detached sense of wonder, reminding her of when she stood in front of the city aquariums the one time the Dursley’s brought her along. The lake cast rippling and warping shadows across the floor and bed, and Ursa sat down on the cold stone to look out the window, her lone, distorted shadow the only thing marring the empty room’s surface. She hummed a random tune while she watched fish swim past, their shadows briefly joined hers on the floor before vanishing. Something felt tight in her chest, and her stomach turned into a flock of blue jays. Nothing felt real yet. There is only a bed, a desk, and a chest of drawers, all of them a dark oak wood with silver and green accents, and it’s the most Ursa could ever call her own. The same, small room every girl in Slytherin house has and her wand are the most personal things ever given to her. It felt like too much. Her stomach feels leadened now, the acidic taste of guilt lingering in her throat.
“Why did I feel so miserable?” Ursa asked, looking up at Professor Quirrell, quite content that he could answer any question she asked him.
look better off, and you were raised by muggles,” Draco said to her as they dissected their future classmates, whispering commentary to each other if there was someone particularly eye-catching. Ursa gave him a withering look, she really had tried to dress as nicely as possible, a black turtleneck, a gray/black tartan skirt, some black tights, and a billowing, silk black robe with silver accents over top everything. She’s developed a love of dark clothing, sue her. Draco’s dressed in black slacks and a dark green blouse, with a similar robe to hers, and Ursa thought to herself that they complimented each other well. Even though what Draco said was slightly insulting, she couldn’t help but think there was the smallest of compliments within it.
“Got it.” Ursa’s guts were coiling and condensing in her torso, and she had half a mind to expel them via vomiting just to be rid of the feeling. The thought of the dungeons mixed with her fear for Neville’s safety stewed in her stomach, the volatile combination making stars appear in her peripheral but she refused to let herself faint in front of all these people.
Ursa Potter?” Neville asked, shocked, “Not to be that person, but I ask because from what my grandmother has told me, our parents were really good friends and we share a birthday!” Neville’s smile was sunny, the crooked teeth honest and the chapped lips genuine. It was the most sincere smile Ursa thinks she’s ever received, and she decided then that she’s keeping Neville, whether Draco likes it or not.
Ursa spent the morning reading a book she took off a shelf in his office, comfortably splayed across the chair at his desk while he worked.
“R-Remember the ink bottle in charms?” Draco shouted, paralyzed with fear but forming a Hail Mary plan in his head.
“Up!” Ursa shouted, envisioning the broom leaping into her hand, and lo and behold, it eagerly rose to her welcoming grasp. Draco’s broom beside her also met his palm instantly. Neville’s broom, surprisingly, also jumped into his hand on his second try, which further added to the mystery of his lack of casting prowess. Ursa looked up from Neville’s broom, and noticed Weasley glaring, Granger beside him was yet attempting to get her broom to do more than dance on the grass.
Keeping a routine of maintaining that pageant appearance was familiar, and Ursa regretted realizing she was using it to attain some familiarity while at this new school. She quickly washed her face of everything but mascara, and forced herself out the door before she could reapply the twenty minutes worth of makeup she had on. Aunt Petunia wasn’t here.
“While I applaud you for thinking that far ahead, you can have friendships based purely on liking a person, you know.”
“Of course, Professor,” She smiled at Snape, wanting nothing more than to ignite a trail of oil leading to his greasy hair.
“Good morning, sir,” Ursa greeted Professor Quirrell as he nimbly maneuvered around chairs and tables to reach hers, tucked all the way in the back against a window.
“That’s because Gryffindor is the best house, and Slytherin is full of dark wizards and death eaters,” Weasley tried again, “Of course Dumbledore wouldn’t like you.”
“N-Now now, Severus. Fro-From what we’ve h-heard, they stumbled o-on this troll h-here and-and defended them-themselves,” Professor Quirrell challenged, and it was clear he and Snape were going to fight over this. Ursa thanked Merlin for Professor Quirrell.
“Because Pansy doesn’t look like she wants to commit murder every time she applies mascara,” Draco threw his arm over the back of the lounge, and Ursa hesitantly sidled against him and under his arm.
“I think this person just dipped their owl’s talon in ink and dragged it across the parchment, I genuinely can’t read this scratch,” Ursa complained, squinting at the hieroglyphics in hopes that eventually some of it might turn into a closer approximation of the modern alphabet.
“...But I want to,” Ursa shrugged, glaring at him for getting far too comfortable with her mattress.
“I didn’t really have anywhere to go,” Ursa shrugged, watching the nostalgia pull up at his lips as he absentmindedly flipped through the yellowed pages.
“Ursa, I really don’t think you should call yourself that,” Neville spoke up, and she quickly fixed his hold on the knife before he continued, “I mean, look at poor Lavender Brown over there, you’re scaring the school to death.”
“You scare me sometimes,” Pansy admitted, “I forget you’re quiet because all you do is people watch, you creep.”
“It’s pretty, isn’t it?” Draco asked beside her, for once not sounding condescending, she’d even be so bold as to say he was equally as bewitched as she was.
“I’m sure it’ll be easy, Professor Flitwick wouldn’t make our first practical lesson that difficult,” Ursa reasoned. The feeling of crippling dread left the second she exited the dungeons, but she didn’t want to tempt the illness again by eating.
Sometimes, if Ursa looked close enough, she could see every crown, ribbon, trophy, or sash she had won hanging on Petunia’s bedroom wall.
“What’s the problem?” Draco looked up, returning to earth after zoning out, and then noticed Weasley’s staring, “Oh, there it is.”
I did not mean to take almost three months to update this, but some lovely things came up in my life which sucked both my motivation and bank account dry :) also I genuinely rewrote this chapter like four times, so if any parts seem like they don’t quite flow, it’s because I’m tired and I write exclusively between the hours of 12am-3am
“I agree, honestly I blame poor education, true if you wanted to learn you could buy a book about it, but if we have Muggle Studies offered why can’t we have Pureblood Studies or something similar offered? My theory is the Ministry wants the traditions to die,” Ursa offered, and took a bite of food now that it was Draco’s turn to talk.
“The Girl-Who-Lived has a name, Granger,” Draco threw over his shoulder, rolling his eyes at their moronic insult. It would only hurt if he actually viewed them as valuable to society.
“What started the fight?” Ursa asked, casually, seeing how pleased Draco was over his perceived victory made her want to continue the conversation.
The first on the stack was from Draco, whom she sent some silk, dark green-black, subtly iridescent robes she heard him sigh over not too long ago, as well as an enchanted ring fashioned to look like a dragon eating its tail. She is well aware of his love for dragons, and she thought the tail consumption was a fitting reminder for him, as sometimes him eating his own foot is more beneficial than him talking. Charms were put on it for protection from mild spells. He had gotten her a silver necklace with a crystal fashioned into it as well as matching earrings, a note in the parcel explained that it’s for protection, and the jewelry itself has countless charms and such within it. She put them on immediately. He had also sent her a magically preserved, rare flower encased in a glass orb, and she couldn’t stop from smiling when the sun’s rays struck the glass and refracted over the room in stunning, colorful specks.
“That’s certainly an option,” Quirrell remarked, “But come, let’s get you back to your dorm so you can sleep, your magical signature is suffocating in here, so I assume you put quite the draining punch behind your spells.”
“Sorry,” Ursa apologized, insincerely, turning to face Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Professor Flitwick, Professor Sprout, and Professor Quirrell, the latter looking very conscious, “Neville was in the bathroom when the troll announcement was made, we thought he ought to know.”
The two continued grading for another couple hours, Ursa staying a little longer than needed to continue their scattered, low impact conversations. She’s taken to just hanging around the Professor whenever she can, and if he had an issue with her clinging to him like a lost puppy, he never mentioned it.
“Oh,” Ursa was surprised, not because of the knowledge that her favorite professor let a troll in, but because she didn’t care all too much that her favorite professor let a troll in, “Can I ask why?”
“LEVIOSA!” Ursa heard Draco scream, and turned around quick enough to see a large chunk of marble that might have resembled a sink not twenty minutes ago flying at her, “Launch it!”
Potions was a mixed bag. On one hand, Ursa finally got her wish of having practical lessons instead of lectures, but Snape was about as pleasant as an itchy mosquito bite. Truly, she wondered how Draco’s parents, who seem quite lovely, could stand being around the man enough to trust their son’s well being with him should something happen to them. Ursa and Neville were the only two Slytherins he disliked, and Snape made it painfully obvious in the most passively malicious methods he could. Greengrass, Parkinson, and even Goyle got points for breathing right, but she was lucky if he managed to look her direction without appearing nauseous.
“Shut up,” She rolled her eyes, her muscles going slack against him once he straightened his spine again, doubled over from a swift elbow to the gut. Comfortable once more, she turned back to her book, reading in warm silence, while Draco read over her shoulder. Hypothetically, he could just stand and grab a book for himself, but Ursa kept him grounded.
“Pretty quiet, Professor Quirrell kept me company and gave me books, so I wasn’t too bored,” Ursa shrugged.
“They broke the rules and separated from their classmates, actively hunted a troll, and ruined school property,” Snape complained, and Ursa’s opinion of him sank even lower. Ursa decided it was time to find out just how flammable his oily hair is.
She got Blaise an old, official looking tome on magical creatures, since she heard him once mention he would like to study them when he got older, as well as candy and an obsidian colored wand holder that reminded her of him. He got her chocolate and the wizard equivalent to a gift card for a witch’s clothing store on Diagon, with a note apologizing for being bad at picking out gifts.
“What’s wrong, professor?” Ursa asked, while Draco and Neville chattered to each other on their way to the dorms.
“And what dominates the Ministry? The Light. More and more muggleborns work for the Ministry, and muggleborns are always light, which wouldn’t be bad, if it weren’t the fact that the brainchild we’re developing here is probably correct,” Draco rolled his eyes, “Hey, where the hell is Neville, I need to know his opinion on th—“
“We have potions with Gryffindor, Uncle Sev hates that house so it’ll be a fun class. For us, of course. Sev has and will make students cry,” Draco looked sadistically gleeful, and Ursa found herself smiling with him, even though guilt burned hotly in her stomach for being unable to eat the food Draco’s dumped on her.
“How lovely to see you, Ursa, you look slightly less beggard-like then when we last talked, congratulations on the minimal effort,” Draco started with a charming smile. He was given the filthiest look Ursa could manage, she spent a lot of galleons on robes more befitting of a wealthy witch, and even set up a subscription for a monthly delivery of vanity potions at the recommendation from his mother.
“Obviously,” he rolled his eyes. He jogged towards the pillar and she watched, transfixed, as the wall seemed to just… swallow him. The brickles rippled where his mass met the wall, and in seconds reversed to its original state, completely undisturbed. Now intrigued, Ursa ran after him. A moment of darkness led to the most brilliant sight after Diagon Alley. Harmless spells being cast colored the air, laughter of children and exasperated admonishments of adults joined the bellows of train engines. The train itself was beautiful, a bright, reflective scarlet red, and Ursa wasn’t entirely convinced there wasn’t a spell on the locomotive itself to make it shine.
Draco grabbed her by her wrist and started leading her through the mansion once again, beyond happy for the excuse of simple contact. He looked over his shoulder, saw her impatient eyes, and smirked, breaking into a sprint that would grey his mother’s hair. Something about the presence behind him, the familiarity of her fingers and the calm tilt to her eyes, a confidence trailed like lit oil from her hand to his, and he was laughing as his heavy footfalls reverberated against the walls. Ursa laughed as well, matching his pace easily and watching the way the splintered light hit his profile whenever they passed a window, reminding her of the hypnotic, hanging lightbulb in those spy movies Aunt Petunia loved. Their shoes tilted the rugs and disturbed the curtains, but Draco hadn't felt so weightless in his own home, and Ursa was content to watch him smile.
“DEFODIO!” She screamed again, getting more panicked now. She wasn’t sure that spell would work, it was meant to carve stone and steel, but it was the first backup her mind spit out while cowering in the corner of her head. It did more damage, miraculously, it took off the tip of a finger, but that just made the troll angrier. Ursa quickly realized that
“But, I could just as easily levitate someone more than six feet off the ground and cause serious injury,” Ursa pointed out.
“No,” Blaise interrupted, “Draco isn’t affectionate, he’s possessive, and Ursa is like a puppy receiving attention for the first time and soaking it up.”
“Slytherin!” Was shouted after a minute or so, and Neville looked like he’d pass out from relief now that attention wasn’t on him anymore. The snake’s table applauded, shocked but not ungrateful for another pureblood, while the other three houses politely clapped.
The troll fell, finally, the room shook when its carcass hit the tiles. Draco and her stepped closer, and she grimaced seeing the effect the
“Wonderful!” Draco exclaimed from beside Ursa, and it didn’t escape her notice he was trying to subtly slide food onto her plate, not satisfied with whatever she’s already eaten.
Ursa put on her school clothes: a puffy, white, silk blouse, a Slytherin green tie, a black skirt, and black tights along with some cute black flats, her robes, and her bag. Ursa ran down to the common room five minutes before breakfast, running a hand through her hair in slight distress, a fleeting moment of joy and amusement passed when she felt her already wild hair stick up and fluff worse than usual. She immediately flattened it again, horror-struck that she had the audacity to tempt perfection without a mirror nearby.
he had a stutter sometimes. He started off stumbling and fumbling over consonants and vowels, but after Ursa asked a question on the purpose of the class, his voice was smooth, calculated, and surprisingly deeper-sounding.
“I don’t think so, no,” Ursa lied, “Though I haven’t been paying attention, admittedly.” Ursa had seen several unnatural ripples and bubbles, likely something from the deep curious about the boats and student’s chatter. However, Neville is looking rather green.
The three decided to ignore the professor, and now that that was out of the way, as well as their nervousness from earlier, the emotional vacuum left made room for crippling reality checks. The rest of the meal passed with nervous breakdowns and an intervention. Neville had a small crisis when it sunk in that he’s Slytherin, something his grandmother won’t be happy about in the least. While Ursa rubbed Neville’s shoulders, his head in his hands, Draco and her passed a piece of parchment back and forth discussing what things they can throw together for him by the time a howler might come in the morning. First years got escorted to their common room in the dungeons by the prefects, and the Slytherins obediently followed behind the intimidating upperclassmen.
“I don’t know, you had me convinced,” Ursa shrugged, but couldn’t keep a straight face when his eyes shone with offense, “Now that you mention, your hair does look a little red in the light, maybe you have a common relative.
“Ursa, help help help, oh Merlin—“ Neville tried leaning forward to grab her again but ended up launching himself through the air. He screamed and tried to pull back, which only gained him altitude, and Ursa rushed after him on foot, ignoring anything Hooch said after her.
“Good job, now hold still,” She said, and reached up with one hand to hold his face, and used the other to cast similar spells to the ones she used for Neville earlier. Draco’s eyelids fell shut as the purple marks faded to yellow, to pink, back to the flawless alabaster of his complexion. Ursa made sure both large bruises were gone, turning Draco’s face around in her hands a couple times, not wanting to deal with his pissy attitude about his ruined face when the joy of beating Weasley wore off. Draco’s head leaned into her hands, and she couldn’t help but snort.
Please let me know what you think of this story! Your comments and feedback mean the world to me, and honestly comments make me feel more encouraged to continue with this story and update quicker!
Ginny shook her head, forgetting the rest of the examples Blaise had used.  “He… Oh fuck it you get the point.”
Harry’s brain was in a whirlwind. He turned his head over his shoulder and watched his Healer leave the room, taking the rest of his sanity with him.
“Wait I’m confused. Did you fight? Did you break his nose? Oh my god imagine if he had to be admitted as his own patient-
The trio made their way steadily towards the double doors at the end of the corridor. Eliza held open the door as Hermione started to guide Harry through. He looked back over his shoulder as he walked, and what he saw made his heart bleed.
to apologise, Potter. An apology is done by actions. I contacted her, and spoke with her professionally about your condition-“
Malfoy did not react to Harry’s attempt at humour, or embarrassing cough, which made the heat grow hotter on the tips of Harry’s ears. Malfoy’s steel eyes did not leave the chart. “I need to give you a quick examination Potter, to check the extent of damage. Are you wearing clothes beneath your Auror robes?”
Eliza grinned brightly, tucking a loose lock of blonde wavy hair behind her ear. “It sounds much too grown up doesn’t it. Call me Eliza.”
The butterflies in Harry’s stomach caused his insides to churn violently. He had tried his best tonight to look perfect for Draco. His long, usually unruly hair was tied back into a (mostly) neat knot at the top of his head, with shorter, soft curls loose at the front to frame his face. Harry had partnered his gifted emerald shirt with black, tight fitting trousers and dark brown loafers. He wore a small, gold hoop earring in his right earlobe, subtly visible behind his curly black tendrils. The coat he wore was a long black winter coat, lined on the inside with black silk – a gift from Hermione when he completed his Auror course.
“If you’re the representative of Gryffindor here then my opinion of the lions has sunk even lower, and I thought that would be impossible but you’re a fountain of discoveries Weasley,” Draco applauded, turning and deciding to talk to Zabini, as Weasley no longer interests him.
“I’d like to thank you for yours as well,” he lifted his arm, letting gravity drag down his sleeve enough to show the wand holder she got him.
“Neville, calm down, breathe, you’re completely fine, just breathe—“ Ursa started, only to be interrupted by Hooch yelling at Neville to land and stop messing around.
“Y-you bring up an amazing point, actually,” the Professor has started, “Dark Arts are defined as any spell or ritual that are considered dark, i.e. requiring the user to be able to use dark magic to perform.”
Neville and Ursa headed back to the Great Hall to join the others for lunch. Neville was content with wearing a cast for a day, Ursa’s quick aid prevented him needing it for a week. The two walked into the Great Hall laughing, but Ursa immediately sobered seeing the state of Draco’s face.
. It was like a dull pressure constricting her heart and lungs, exceedingly uncomfortable but not painful. Her limbs felt leadened, a metallic lump took residence in the pit of her stomach. She could feel anxiety marching in her blood, the minuscule spark of adrenaline making her constantly feel unnerved. She wasn’t sure where any of this was coming from, but it almost made her stay in bed all day.
the conversation in DADA was *heavily* inspired by “The Rise of a Dark Lord” by Little.Miss.Xanda on fanfiction/.net, it’s an amazing story and got me into my specific Harry Potter tastes lol
The Slytherins started clapping again, just a little bit louder this time. He went and sat next to Neville, happy.
“Greetings and salutations to you too, you prissy peacock, I’d compliment your hair gel but I think the greasy look is a compliment to you enough,” Ursa retaliated, her sweet smile was ungenuine and venom dissipated from every pore of her words.
DADA was… interesting, as the first day established. Everyone walked in, the three, led by Draco, sat in the front because Draco knew Ursa was excited for this class, and Neville was content to follow them wherever. Immediately Ursa knew this class would drain her, Professor Quirrell’s stuttering was comparable to someone’s heavy handed attempt at running their nails down a chalkboard: inconsistent, but sharp and disorienting when nail actually caught board. He seemed to almost…
“Did you straighten your hair when you were younger too?” He asked, “That must have been difficult for a child to do.”
For several minutes the three were quiet, appreciating the serenity of the peaceful, rocking boat under a crystal clear, star-filled night sky, Draco played with a loose strand of Ursa’s hair, only remarking once that she needed to tame her stubborn locks. Draco doesn’t concern himself with personal space, Ursa figured out.
She counted the spots in the ceiling’s texture. At one hundred seventy-three, she cast another tempus and violently cursed under her breath as she saw twenty-two minutes passed, leaving only half an hour to get ready. Probably more than needed, but Ursa wanted to be sure she was decent looking.
“Actually, I think I know what’s going to go wrong, I’m going to mess up somehow hiding your cold, dead body,” Draco shot back. Ursa snorted, mildly distracted from her illness. Neville joined them then, the three walking to breakfast together while discussing a recent charms essay.
“Would you like to head back to the manor?” Draco asked, partially because his feet were tiring, partially as a way to forcefully rip himself from his thoughts, “We can just grab an early dinner.”
The Malfoy estate was as beautiful as it was grand, and in that week she’s been there, Draco has already given her two tours, insisting one wasn’t enough to commit to memory.
The two walked and commented on each other’s choice of school-preparation. Ursa admired his impressively sized falcon, casually mentioning it’s rather intimidating, and after a few seconds of Draco looking too physically pained to compliment Edgar, he remarked that his understanding of phonetics is commendable. They also discussed books, both having bought a surplus of texts relating to potions. He wants to be a Potions Master like his uncle, but from what Ursa has read, being a Healer sounds more to her tastes.
The next package was from Pansy, whom Ursa got the latest line of some expensive makeup brand, as well as some equally expensive chocolate frogs, Pansy’s favorites. Pansy had gotten her a book on vanity and daily life charms, as well as an enchanted hairbrush that would fix any hair knot. Ursa glared at the brush, wondering if Pansy was trying to tell her something.
‘In case those books in the library weren’t enough, but remember: you didn’t get these from me—Quirrell’ said the note attached, and Ursa gasped as she felt something electric buzz through her arm as her hand grasped a book. The feeling reminded her of thunderous weather on a dark, chilly day, watching lightning soar through the clouds from a tear-streaked window in an equally dark room. It didn’t feel warm, or bubbly, or any happy thing, but there was a terrible rightness that exuded from the leather-bound spines. She picked up the book and read the ancient, beaten cover, Darke Magick, and understood the need for Quirrell’s secrecy, and also understood the correctness she felt when her fingertips brushed stained paper. The other books, similarly old and decrepit, were of the same topic. Offensive and defensive dark magic, blood magic, curses that would definitely garner Azkaban time, and surprisingly a book on how to make poison from magical plants, Ursa smiled knowing he remembered her Herbology bias. Unlike the books in the library that are carefully worded to not provide any spells or rituals used by historically significant, morally ambiguous wizards, these books would fill in those blanks.
“And you’re McGonagall and Dumbledore’s favorite, my sincerest apologies for having one teacher who tries to give us points,” Draco said very insincerely.
The first years all gathered back at the school once the boat ride over the lake finished, and as a group collectively ignored the three sopping wet members among them. Ursa, Draco, and Neville were thoroughly soaked and left a snail trail of water throughout the school to the Great Hall.
“Help?” Neville asked, still under the stall door, apparently some rocks pinned a little bit of the door down and he was stuck.
“W-Well, I say twenty p-points from Sly-Slytherin for disobeying the rules,” Professor Quirrell started, “And tw-twenty points f-for bra-bravery and s-skill.”
“I didn’t say you can’t want it, I’m worried you want it for the wrong reasons,” He shrugged, relaxing his neck and bathing his face in the sunlight from the window. The slightest tensing of her shoulders against his side told him he’s diving into dangerous water.
“I’ll stop when you’re done, so I’d hurry up then,” He smiled pointedly, more pleased that she’s referring to the belongings in the guest room as her own than her admission of almost being finished.
His hands clenched, at the memory of a light body, more befitting a child than an adolescent boy of sixteen, making this show of care all the more hypocritical. “I have no intention to continue this pointless conversation nor listen to the surely abundant accusations you have at your disposal. I suggest, you take your unmistakably enormous concern to those, who feel compelled to listen to it.” With that, he left her standing and headed back towards the potions lab.
Draco's hand closes around him, completely out of sync with his last, hard pushes, closing painfully as the blonde spills. Harry feels tears welling up, from the fear, the pure panic to be left behind. But there is no need to. Draco, with the last of his strength holds himself up, working Harry's cock, sweat and precome mixing on his hand, as he pushes and pulls, pushes and pulls, until Harry arches helplessly, coming a second time, his come spilling over Draco's hand and stomach.
Potter was better now, to the point that he got up regularly and was allowed to do some reading instead of being restricted to listening, though he still tired easily and was still too frail to be allowed more than a trip to the bathroom. The danger of a relapse was simply too high, with a body that was mostly still held together by magic, spit and good wishes. Besides, his extensive potion regimen needed constant attention.
Soon the body lay bare, the extent of damage open to the eye; it was devastating. There seemed to be no bone unbroken, no part of skin intact, no pain spared. From time to time tremors ran over the muscles and pressed out more thick sluggish blood. The worst though, the very worst were those injuries unexplained by “just” a beating. The throat raw within, the lower intestines damaged, the skin of the stomach pierced. From the insides. Poppy could not make heads or tails of that, but Severus knew. He had seen it before, though he shoved the memories into the darkest places of his mind, as far away from attention as possible.
It distracted him in such ways that he not only failed to punish all visible misdemeanors, but also found himself faced as suddenly as unpleasantly with the infamous and inconvenient Ms. Granger.
Another layer of red tinged Potter's face. “I don't know, I... had to try.” He looked down and flinched, when Draco's palm slid under his chin and forced it back up.
With a fast flick of his wand Severus conjured a splash of water and steered it into Potter's face. That did sheer wonders. Some deep breaths, then the boy straightened up and rasped almost coherently: “'M sorry, sir...”
“It was just...” Draco interrupted, trying very hard not to sound like the whining boy he had been so often in the past years.
Almost tenderly Severus touched his jaw, forcing him to meet his eyes, letting him feel, hear, see, how he cast the spell. “Legilimens.”
He did however head for his storage room, once he entered his quarters, checking, if everything had gone according to his directions. As expected the bedside lamp threw a soft light over the room. Potter did not handle complete darkness well at the moment and fell into panic attacks more often than not, if left alone in a room without light. Unexpectedly though, Draco was not sleeping in the spare cot in his bedroom as he had suggested, but on a chair at Potter's bedside. One hand lay on the cot, with Potter almost coiling around it, the fingers wrapped into his own.
For a moment he pondered choosing one of Potter's insolent deviant friends for the task, only to recoil from the idea. They, too, had turned a blind eye on it. Gracing such mockery of care with the privilege of access to his quarters was out of question.
But Theo would not be a good Slytherin, if he did not have a few good ideas. He hides in the shadows of the door and pulls out his own wand. Just a whispered “Wingardium leviosa” and he can screw up Blaise's spell quite nicely, distract him. Slow him down.
Severus could not find peace on that. Each time he tried to sit down in his favorite armchair after only a few minutes nervousness got the better of him and forced him up again. He needed to study the contents of his own library once more. He knew it well enough, but maybe...
Severus sat the glass down and closed in on his protege. “I want no such thing. You have your task and stick to it. Leave the games for those able to play them.”
Bringing his revolting guts back into control, Severus relit the Lumos and determinedly moved into the room, squatting down to assess the situation thoroughly. In almost gentle motions, not to cause further damage, he loosened the boy's face from where dried blood had glued it to the floor and carefully placed Potter on his equally bloodied back.
“I know, it doesn't taste very good. But it helps. Mother had the house-elves prepare it for me, when I was ill.” Draco seemed extraordinarily talkative.
Though disappointing this was a valid point but it was one easily amended. “Kreacher?”Severus asked and clicked his fingers demandingly, summoning the grumpy house-elf instantly, if with a series of of quite impolite grumbles in tow. He gestured to Potter who rose from his seat and walked over, kneeling down strangely silent, otherworldly.
Draco nodded suspiciously compliant and guided him outside. Although Severus severely doubted his sincerity he went with it. Draco's report would give him an overview of the situation and then, with no bad conscience whatsoever on his part, Legilimency would give him the details. He was protecting something important here. It was necessary to put an early stop to anything inappropriate.
“I know! But I don’t want to be sneaky with Ursa and Draco, I feel like I’ll come out of it crying and with significantly shorted self esteem,” Neville moaned.
“Ye-Yes, when S-Snape men-men-mentioned the inc-in-incident, an-and the de-detentions, I off-offered to take-take over yours, sin-since he’s s-so busy I’m-I’m s-sure, s-should you wi-wish to have it w-with m-me,” He said, and she nearly cried from gratitude.
“Not to interrupt this long awaited quiet time, but did either of you see something move in the water?” Draco asked after a while, his voice sounding nothing other than bored, but caused Neville’s anxiety to skyrocket.
“Weasley kept running his mouth, and decided to resort to primitive measures after I spelled his hair yellow,” Draco shrugged, “Apparently McGonagall was watching the class from her classroom office, noticed Weasley’s hair change colors, and rushed down to separate us.”
“Don’t even, I swear to Merlin,” Draco moaned and leaned his head back, and Ursa cackled, her contagious laughter startling the others who soon joined.
“If I wasn’t, do you think I’d be standing here like a lost child? Just show me the way and gloat on the train, I know you’re dying to.”
“What was the mark on your last potions essay Weasley, hm?” Draco called out, inspecting his nails for dirt, “Because I can guarantee you that you don’t have a place to be commenting on anyone’s intelligence here.”
And Severus played his part, the words burning like acid of betrayal on his tongue, even when he just said what he was supposed to say. “My Lord, I have been able to locate Harry Potter for you. He was hidden in Hogwarts the whole time and with the help of your other... asset there I have been able to secure him.”
to do. At all. The only reason, he did not intercept, did not stop his mate right there, was the fact, that Potter fell into it, so easily, so softly that dragging him out again, would have done more harm than good. Granted, it was a sight to behold too, arousing and tempting and impossibly good.
The headmaster had chosen to turn a blind eye on the neglect and mistreatment of a child, as much as he had; leaving it to him now would only lead to continued lack of much needed care and support. He was doomed to see this to an end, no matter what, or he would never be able to forgive himself knowing Lily would never forgive him either.
Potter sagged, the pained tension in his body flowing away and leaving the only peace fate would grant him.
Strangely, all he can hear is praise, none of the usual scathing remarks from his best enemies in years. And oh, that feels good too. Has he ever been praised, really and truthfully? For something, he actually could influence? Ever? He moans in response, tries to speak, is soothed by the same, warm, almost proud voice. “Relax, don't worry, I take care of you. You take it so well...”
so half the reason this took longer than expected is because im at a busy point in my life, the other half is because spent 8 hours in a sordid, on again off again affair with the art for the chapter
The older Malfoys weren’t present, Draco suspected for some new development in their evil scheme to dominate Magical Britain. Or whatever else adults do, he figured. They only mentioned to him in passing that an old business partner wishes to rekindle their friendship and loyalty, and he couldn’t be concerned enough to prod further into it.
“How did they ‘stumble’ on a troll? They defied the single order we gave them and thought they were powerful enough to bring the beast down, arrogance at its finest, typical for a Potter,” Snape scoffed.
“Think he’s still around here?” Draco asked as they slowed down a second to breathe. Ursa was fine, but Draco was wheezing like one of Aunt Marge’s dogs. Ursa readied a reply, but before the words could leave her mouth they heard a sharp shriek. They didn’t hesitate to start running again. The corridor was a blur as they ran, and when the bathroom approached they looked at the busted doorframe in horror. They subtly slunk through a sizable gap in the shredded wooden door, and Draco shrieked as they ducked under the club of a troll before it shattered a stall. Dust from the marble was floating through the air, water was rushing from broken pipes, and there Neville was in the corner, hunched over and hiding under a broken off stall door.
“Granger is just using her intelligence to prove she belongs at Hogwarts, it’s a mutual feeling for many muggleborn students and I don’t blame her for fixating on school work,” Ursa sighed, “While she’s annoying, lots of people are more annoying for worse reasons, I think it’s more sad than anything.”
“Sure,” Ursa shrugged, opening her eyes and Draco was nearly winded when this malevolent voice from deep within his subconscious pointed out how pretty the color was, “I’m eager to read these new books.”
“So magic is dark if I want to hurt someone with it?” Draco joined, quick to back up Ursa and support her argument.
“Good evening, sir,” She smiled, turning away from her work. Despite the stutter, Ursa really liked Professor Quirrell. His class was pretty tame but he didn’t have the same bias towards magic that other teachers had.
funny story: I read this when I first started reading fanfiction, like this was the first thing I came across that looked interesting to me, and my feeble lizard brain didn’t understand that “maybe something more” in the summary meant like, romantic, so I read the story and got super invested, realized what was going on halfway thru, but had to finish it anyway and now I’m obsessed with the dark harry trope and harrymort ship because of it. check the story out if you can! (I’m not sure if it’s on ao3 or not)
“Uh, hey Draco, who’s the creep beside your uncle?” Neville asked, and Ursa turned and noticed what must’ve disturbed Neville: the unrelenting stare of a professor in a turban, centered almost entirely on them and them only.
“Morning, thought I’d give you some reading recommendations, since reading seems to be all you’re doing,” He laughed, and Ursa visibly perked up at the thought, “Would it kill you to come down to the Great Hall to eat, at least?”
“Is this even English?” Professor Quirrell asked rhetorically from beside her, the two grading papers together. Ursa got a detention from Snape again for being a distraction, in reality she was just asking Pansy and Blaise for clarification on the potion process, but once again the DADA professor took her detention off Snape’s hands and saved her from unimaginable torture and misery at the greasy man’s hands.
“Run over there, quickly!” He shouted and Ursa started running towards the far corner of the bathroom, hoping she could get there before the giant, albeit slow as molasses, troll pushed its way through the obstacle course it caused and reached them.
“What?” Neville asked, on the opposite side of the table. Ursa glared at Draco for being a mother hen, and he glared back for Ursa eating like a newborn chick.
“Merlin, he’s stupid,” Weasley laughed, the laughter of many Gryffindors joining him after his two friends left, and Draco idly thought he’ll kill the both of them for abandoning him with such idiocy.
Their cauldron started smoking, a hissing noise alerted the rest of the class that something wasn’t right, and Snape rushed to the back to banish the liquid before it could explode.
“Merlin, his persistence is creepy,” Ursa whispered to Draco, Ronald’s gaze made her uncomfortable and she stepped closer to Draco.
“Still, an excellent opportunity to show up Weasley, and that bookworm Granger,” Draco scoffed, tired of Weasley insisting that school grades don’t define his magical prowess, that he’s just a bad test taker, etc., and Granger’s holier than thou attitude to academics. Draco grabbed a second plate with some fruit and a bagel and put it in front of Ursa. Ursa once again banished it.
“I will eat your books,” Draco hissed, and made a grab for her charmed pouch that housed today’s purchases, and she jumped back in retaliation. When Draco lunged again, Ursa took off down the hallway. Draco laughed, adrenaline consuming him as he chased his petite classmate, shouting directions when she reached the end of a hallway. Eventually they did manage to come by a library, after a couple flights of stairs and too many similar hallways for Draco to discern. Ursa turned around and sighed, still smiling, but the second Draco stopped, his knees almost gave in. Swallowing air at an alarming rate, he couldn’t help but admire Ursa, who barely looked winded.
The estate was too much, it felt as though she was trespassing in the scene of a painting, tainting what made its eerie, untouched stillness desirable in the first place. They had peacocks in their front lawn, for Merlin’s sake.
“Why would they chase you around? Is it that muggle game, uh, tag?” He asked, leaning on her until his heart settled.
“I think the student had the wrong assignment in mind, look at this,” He gestured, and Ursa leaned over and saw poor Gregory Goyle’s lackluster attempt at explaining the major distinctions between centaurs and fauns, when he should’ve been discussing the factors behind unicorn extinction. Ursa couldn’t help but chuckle at some of the unfortunate wording of his essay, joined by Professor Quirrell who also pointed out some other particularly humorous essays for her.
Ursa Potter, by no fault of her own, was horribly, irrevocably, and inextricably lost. Dappled light filtered in from the glass ceiling of King's Cross, and it struck her hand as it wound its way into her equally lit up curly mane of espresso hair, turned a rusty gold by the sunlight. She stood still among the bustling adults, half their size and seemingly with half their wit, unable to think of how to get to Platform 9¾. Panic ebbed in her chest, Hagrid abandoned her with no clue of where to go and that muggle officer denied the existence of the platform entirely. The whistles from surrounding trains sounded ceaselessly, and that annoyance combined with her crow’s antics served to put her in an even worse mood than the morning.
Speaking of Quirrell, she needed to thank him. She had sent him some expensive potions to help with frustration, headaches, and anger better than the calming droughts would, as well as a black, scaled wand holder she thought he’d like. She knew he was in Slytherin, and he’s mentioned he favors snakes in terms of tolerable animals, so she thought a wand holder fashioned after a snake would be appreciated.
“Yes yes, give me a minute, you child,” She grumbled, but he was placated by the affection curling her lips into a grin, “And would you stop tossing my pillows everywhere? You’re messing up my bedding.”
“How was your guys’ holiday?” Pansy asked, sporting a new, luxurious sweater and earrings. The group was sitting at the end of the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, their Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw friends joining them.
“A diversion, that was the plan at least,” Quirrell sniffed, “Dumbledore has something hidden in the castle--that he shouldn’t have here in the first place--and I need it. I didn’t think he’d send students back to their common rooms, and while I may not be a very good person I wouldn’t dare let children be at risk of being some trolls’ meals.”
“Very good, Mr. Malfoy, Ms. Potter, Ms. Bones, would you mind helping your surrounding classmates?” Professor Flitwick asked, Draco and Ursa shared a look of mutual disinterest and instead used the charm to toss an ink jar back and forth to each other, the one who let it drop first has to carry around the other’s school supplies. If Professor Flitwick had an issue with their antics, he didn’t express it.
“Well, my mother and I had fun, she tried to cook something fancy but it went up in flames so the house elves had to fix it,” Blaise laughed.
do it doesn’t mean they need to,” Ursa shrugged, watching his pallid brows scrunch, perplexed, as she folded a pair of trousers.
“Alright Professor McGonagall, the kids are yours,” Hagrid announced, the group coming to a stop in front of a large set of doors. Luckily for them, the previously mentioned curious creature was the school’s Giant Squid, harmless by all accounts, and it wasted no time snatching the three shrieking children from the dark water and dumping them on the shore.
“You only do well because you’re Snape’s favorites!” Another voice joined, and Draco couldn’t be bothered to see who it was.
more of a filler chapter, just something to flesh out Ursa and Voldemort’s relationship, and try to establish the dad-ness of Voldemort
“REDUCTO!” Ursa put as much power as she could into the spell, and tipped her wand slightly to the right. The chunk of marble collided with  her reducto, and the explosion, aimed slightly to the right, propelled what was left of the chunk at the troll, nailing it in the temple. The troll stumbled, had it been a larger piece of ammunition it would’ve gone down, and Draco immediately picked up on that.
Ursa nodded, the pressure on her stomach, heart, and mind lifted, and the relief made her light headed and weightless.
All it took was four more chunks of stone and marble and the troll was completely disoriented. One sizable piece had a sharp, broken-off, exposed pipe that did a significant amount of damage to the temple, managing to smash a small amount of the ugly creature’s skull in. If Ursa had to guess, it couldn’t see straight but was too stubborn to fall over, so she aimed her bone-white wand at the tiny, gorey hole in its head that her and Draco created and shouted, “EVISCERATE!”
Neville’s package was a little larger, and that almost worried her. He got her an Aglaophotis for her dorm to help ward away illness, as well as a more advanced textbook on magical plant care. It seems they thought very similarly, because she got him two advanced books on magical plant care and a Rashovnik, an herb whose roots can open any door.
“Boring, father had to leave early but otherwise it was uneventful,” Draco drawled, and Ursa spotted the ring on his finger as he waved his hand around.
“Yes, take what you need, your loyal service deserves reward,” She responded as warmly as possible, and handed him the container of roots.
“Hm, oh, I think that’s Professor Quirrell? I’ve heard some things about him from Uncle Sev: apparently the man’s an incompetent coward who stutters more than he teaches,” Draco shrugged.
Draco, Neville’s in the bathroom,” she whispered, “He doesn’t know.” Her stomach sank to her feet, and her heart traveled into her throat, attempting to beat itself out of her mouth.
Slytherin house, like Ravenclaw, was a quiet house, the students’ used their time to study or plot more than converse. It was well regarded in Slytherin that too much expression could result in nasty consequences for the eager oversharer, so it wasn’t a surprise that the house was full of introverts who would hold close to a small group of trusted confidants and scorn the rest. Silence was expected because you couldn’t trust that someone with good ears and a generational grudge wasn’t near. Typically Ursa rather liked the gentle atmosphere, while it was every man for himself there was a unique, mutual pact between every Slytherin as the house of Hogwarts’ underdog that kept students from bickering, reluctant to dent the united front they had to present to other houses. Slytherin was not too dissimilar to a lazy cat, edging a glass towards the end of a table, but stopping before gravity could take hold in a silent reminder that while it has the power to knock the glass off, it won’t.
“That’s impressive,” She noted, ignoring Draco’s confused look at her plate, and then the nasty look thrown at her.
personalities are all over the place, ngl. I want to make them seem like actual kids, ya know? and also show slytherins as more then just quiet, emotionless husks that get good jobs and are good at everything. I'm going to work more on establishing more concrete personalities with recurring habits, ticks, quirks, and tells that will make them into actual people.
kind of a filler, but we’re tackling emotions because I am vicariously tackling my own trauma teehee
“My cousin and his friends liked to chase me around,” She answered, seeing his confusion, walking over to make sure he’s alright, “I just became a pretty decent runner from it.”
“We have Defense Against the Dark Arts with Gryffindor, too,” She pointed out, that was a class she was looking forward to. While currently Ursa’s goal was to be a healer, she’s fascinated by the ”Dark Arts”.
Draco grinned, hugging her pillow to hide his expression. Ursa has never gone into depth concerning the treatment from her guardians, but the odd scar he glimpses behind her ears, on the sliver of stomach occasionally exposed when stretched, or marring the skin of her shoulders doesn’t leave him with thoughts of a pleasant household. If it takes him the summer he’ll welcome the change, but Draco is determined to get Ursa Potter more properly conditioned to being taken care of and spoiled with positive attention.
“They are simple to better contrast the handsome features of the wearer,” Draco said, smugly, and Ursa didn’t appreciate the implication of that statement.
The warm, orange toned, morning sun filtered through the window and illuminated the free falling dust surrounding her, like specks of gold from a crown not yet formed. Her head was angled towards the book on the table and her elbow propped to support her head, looking the perfect student. Tom Riddle exhaled, and watched a younger version of himself gently turn the page, its significance to the library microscopic but the importance of the book to her, and every book on that stack he gave to her, made it priceless. He leaned back in his chair, and started reading his own book, careful not to let his shadow block the light she needed to read. Something about the scene felt sad, the naive resemblance of their personalities made his heart feel heavy. The library remained silent other than the occasional scratch of a quill, its user desperate to retain the knowledge given to her through these books, and by extension her favorite adult. The only words exchanged in this period was when it ended, the professor mentioned it was time to eat and she followed him to the Great Hall.
“Kind of,” Was all Ursa offered. Draco grabbed her wrist again and walked between the labyrinth of shelves, this Minotaur of emotion between them ducking behind books as they floated, unaware, to the single chaise lounge before a window. The shelves were tall and imposing, but the large window, stained orange by the evening sun, warmed their sides and their shadows became less cold. Draco sniffed, noting the dust polluting the area in front of the window, determined to speak to a house elf about it.
“Slytherin is where Death Eaters like you belong,” a boy in Gryffindor muttered, but the whole class likely heard.
Professor Snape curtly handed them schedules with no words shared, and the three eagerly looked at their classes.
“I don’t have a crush on some dark witch bitch!” Weasley screamed, returning quickly back to that angry burgundy in the face. Now Draco’s blood started to boil. Glaring hotly, he drew his wand and spelled Weasley’s hair neon yellow.
“I got a marriage proposal over break, ugh,” Pansy gagged, and Ursa laughed with her, “How was it here at the castle, Ursa?”
“An-Any witch or-or wizard co-could u-use dark s-sp-sp-spells, ke-keep that a-attitude an-and one m-might use a s-spell o-on you,” the professor said rather threateningly, and the boy simply turned pink, crossed his arms, and sunk into his chair, pouting a little.
the intended outcome. You may not want to hurt someone with a levitation charm, but you certainly want to hurt someone with a bone-breaking curse.”
“Thank you, my liege,” Draco said dramatically, making her cackle again, and every heave of her shoulders made his ego increase that much more, her cackling evolved into a mixture of laughter and snorting when he attempted to bow while seated at the table. For once, Draco doesn’t care if he looks stupid, or if Ursa looks stupid, he just likes hearing her warm, ugly laugh.
Quirrell walked her back to the Slytherin common room, telling her interesting scandals and gossip from his days walking these halls as a Slytherin, and she hung onto every word. When he left her, sure that she was safe and had no injuries from earlier, Ursa idly wondered if this, in its smallest fraction, was what having a real parent felt like.
also I’m going to try and work on responding to comments better, I typically don’t because while I appreciate them more than anything (seriously I love seeing that you all enjoy my brainrot), idk it feels like I don’t deserve them so I struggle with replying
“Why is it called Defense Against the Dark Arts?” Ursa had asked. He introduced himself and the class, then decided he’d spend as much time as possible answering questions about the course, so she raised her hand immediately.
“That should be all the important ones, if you find yourself particularly drawn to any of them let me know and I’ll help you find more, even if you need a slip into the restricted section,” He smiled warmly and Ursa beamed back.
“He also doesn’t particularly like personal hygiene, so don’t take his preferences to heart,” Professor Quirrell said very quietly, with a reassuring hand on her shoulder, “Just come to the classroom at seven, bring any homework you need to finish and I’ll help you through it.”
Ursa pushed her cart around Grand Central Station, and only slightly despised having to force around the infernal device that was almost as large as her. The urge to set it ablaze only increased for every several meters when a wheel squeaked. Muggles were giving Edgar, the crow, bewildered looks, and the feathered rat basked in the attention. He was a crow, and Ursa rather unwisely chose him over an owl. The owner said the bird had been there so long he was just going to get released, as it was an unnecessary cost to feed and house him, so the bird was cheaper than dirt. She felt immediate remorse over how cheap the corvid was, so a large sum of money was spent on a more luxurious, silver, ornate birdcage that had some charms to keep the bag of feathers comfortable. Edgar understood a surprising amount of English, and was able to mimic the words “yes” and “no”, so the chronic lonesomeness of the Dursley household was subsided mildly by the occasional sound of croaked affirmations.
“Gross,” Draco sniffed, kicking the carcass a little with his toe, checking to make sure it won’t react.
“What’s the difference between dark and light magic then? I can’t find a definitive distinction in textbooks,” Ursa asked, no longer raising her hand.
Draco and her met in Madame Malkin’s, both were trying for Slytherin and decided to accompany each other to get their wands. Ursa wasn’t dumb, she knew the history of the bigoted house, and knew that she was not on the side of privilege—that’s where Draco came in. He got perks from her reputation, and she had the silhouette of a wealthy, well-established pureblood to hide in. However, like a malignant tumor, Draco grew on her, and she him, and both soon realized the partnership wouldn’t be as taxing as the other dreaded.
“Potter doesn’t deserve to have her name revered, she’s a slimy snake just like him,” Weasley said to Granger, and now Draco’s blood started rising in temperature.
“Ursa, could I borrow some of your extra ginger root?” Draco asked from his work station in the potions classroom, his partner Blaise Zabini and him were working diligently on a perfect potion. Ursa worked with Neville for this class, Snape was more likely to target her than Neville when  they’re together, and even though Neville’s not aware of her true reasons for working with him, he appreciates the help anyway.
Ursa was correct, the levitation spell wasn’t too difficult to master. Draco was rather adept at the spell, his parents having let him practice simple charms at home before coming to Hogwarts, and Ursa had already tried it once or twice on the train. Susan Bones also mastered it quickly, and Ursa made a mental note to remember that. Neville, try as he might, just couldn’t get his feather to raise more a few inches on the desk. Ursa did her best to aid the boy, but couldn’t discern what was going wrong—his incantation was flawless, his wand movements identical to Professor Flitwick’s, and he knew how to use intention to power a spell. His magic responded to him easily if the broom in the flying lessons was anything to go by, so where was the disconnect?
took forever to get ready,” Draco whined, getting up from the sofa when he noticed Ursa arrive, “You look fine, don’t worry about it and make us wait.”
“Poor Weasley, I know it hurts getting rejected,” Draco continued, “It happens to the best, well I guess lowest, of us.”
“Weasley! I think it would strongly benefit you to pay attention to your broom, as you’re such an incompetent wizard that it’ll require your complete concentration,” Draco yelled out, and Ursa equally wanted to strangle him and hug him. The last thing she wanted was to provoke the Gryffindor.
“Another five points to Slytherin for sheer, dumb luck,” McGonagall scoffed out before turning and leaving, followed by the other staff except Professor Quirrell.
“Draco offered and I nearly went with him, his parents are very friendly, but I didn’t want to intrude. I’d rather die than experience Augusta Longbottom’s caretaking, and frankly I just don’t know the others well enough to ask.”
Apparently her interest in dark magic was communicated to the entire school in a matter of hours, and the general consensus agreed she was either a Death Eater in training, a sympathizer, or the next Dark Lord, and the latter was the more popular of the three. She couldn’t keep herself from cackling madly at random intervals of the day, just to spook other students. It was funny, at least Ursa thought it was, Neville disapproved and Draco all but bought a red carpet labeled “Dark Lord” for her to walk on. The red headed boy, Ronald Weasely, apparently took Professor Quirrell’s advice to mean that Ursa would personally curse him, and he’s started a campaign in Gryffindor against her.
Led by Professor McGonagall, the class, in single file line, walked through the opened doors of the Great Hall and through the aisle between the comically long tables. Ursa’s skin pricked with the almost physical touch of the student body’s gaze, the urge to hide increasing every step. One look at Draco said he was experiencing the same, but the two kept their shoulders set and chins high for Neville, who was faring far worse and reached the hyperventilating stage.
“Dark magic feeds on emotion, the stronger the emotion the stronger the spell. The spells that often need the emotion-boost are used for violence, like curses, so the Ministry labeled them dark,” Professor Quirrell shrugged. The rest of the class no longer held Ursa’s interest, this conversation had her full focus. (
“That looks very dead to me, Miss Potter,” Dumbledore assured her with a smile, “So you came to fetch Mr. Longbottom?”
The second the professor’s unconscious body hit the floor, the student body’s anxiety hit the ceiling. Ursa reached for Draco’s hand and he didn’t hesitate to clench her fingers in his, and he looked about ready to scream along with the rest of the hall.
also I’ve been obsessed with ArtBreeder, and made my vision of these characters in it, so if y’all wanna see that in the next chapter I’ll include some that the bottom of the chapter
“Thank you, by the way,” Ursa turned towards him, putting their noses an inch apart, “I really liked your gifts.”
“Looking pretty handsome yourself,” She quipped back, upper lip raised in a scowl, “I’m not sure why, I just feel so on edge, enough that it’s making me feel both exhausted and hyper. It doesn’t make sense, but I want to be anywhere but here, or something will go wrong.”
“So, what house are you hoping for?” She asked Neville, not wanting to make the poor thing needlessly uncomfortable.
They sat down and started to eat, but Ursa could only manage a small portion of whatever the house elves made for them. She got one slice of toast finished, though she had hoped for two, and the urge to set something ablaze returned whenever she caught sight of the offending piece of burnt bread. She wasn’t allowed breakfast at the Dursleys’, this should’ve been rewarding but her stomach wasn’t ready to eat at this hour yet.
“It’s certainly impressive,” Ursa responded, her eyes struggling to comprehend that this was, in fact, a real place. It looked too fantastical. The full moon reflected off gentle, inky water, the other reflection being the gigantic castle glowing a soft, warm orange from candle light.
The ceiling was a plain, stone gray color, and Ursa soon became intimately familiar with it. There were no distinguishable thoughts in her head, other than an estranged sense of disappointment that sounded a little like Aunt Petunia.
“If I crash, you’re getting an itching hex so far up your ass you’ll feel a tickle in your throat,” Ursa threatened, lining up her cart and assuring that Edgar is secure.
“You never answered my question, earlier,” Draco started, throwing himself on the lounge, followed by Ursa’s more delicate landing, “Why do you wear makeup?”
“Maybe he used the Slytherins as bait, intending on there being a scuffle and having a faculty member mysteriously missing.”
“But maybe I don’t want to hurt someone with a wall of fire curse, maybe I’m trying to effectively clear some dense shrubbery, but it’s labeled dark, isn’t it?” Ursa challenged, “And the bone-breaking curse, what if someone’s arm healed wrong? One spell to break it and it’s easily reset and on the road to recovery.”
“Am I not allowed to?” She asked, and the venom riding shotgun in her tone alerted the room that blood would be shed depending on the answer.
the wrath burning under Draco’s skin. She reached over and grabbed his hand, and bit her tongue trying not to scream as he crushed her hand back in poorly contained fury. If sparks weren’t flying off Draco from his rage, she’d be surprised.
“Uh, not really?” Ursa shrugged, starting to eat as well, “But thank you for so effectively defending my honor in my absence, your loyal service has been acknowledged.”
“I’m a little confused, see, because I’ve read the textbook already and a couple similar texts, and all I’m seeing are a couple hexes and jinxes that I’d more likely prank a two year old with than defend myself, especially against the so-called ‘Dark Arts’, which by the way are never actually defined,” Ursa had squared her shoulders, sat straighter with the class’ attention on her, and maintained eye contact with Professor Quirrel. In the Dursely’s house, there wasn’t much to do other than read, so she read as much as she could with the mass amount of books she had bought with Draco.
“Good evening, Professor,” Draco greeted, smiling charmingly. Neville’s head was hung in shame, and Ursa rolled her eyes.
“Here,” Quirrell offered, and reached into his desk drawer again. Ursa looked closer this time, and forced herself not to gape at the wooden box absolutely filled to the brim with calming droughts.
“I mean, I don’t know if it’s dead-dead,” Ursa admitted, finally hopping off its back and inspecting the skull again.
“What kind of recommendations?” She asked, rolling her eyes at him and ignoring the latter part of what he said.
“Quiet down, Draco, if people hear you they’ll think you’re… a decent human being!” She dramatically gasped at the thought. She fixed a hair back into place for him, smoothing it down until it looked seamless in the gel abomination atop his head.
“If you can’t read it just mark it with a zero, I can’t be bothered with those papers,” the professor waved his hand in dismissal, and then started squinting at the parchment in his own hands.
“And I could stab someone in the eye with a quill, but quills aren’t dark artifacts, are they?” Professor Quirrell seemed to agree with Ursa, and she took a weird, small amount of pride in that. “I believe what the Ministry uses to label the spell Dark is that you have to
Ursa looked over, and lo and behold, the Gryffindor girl was staring shamelessly, her eyes widened when their gazes met. Ursa smiled and waved at her, and it had the intended effect of scaring her, but unfortunately it spooked her enough that when her partner Granger bumped her she jumped back into her bushy-haired partner and knocked all the contents from her hands.
“Exactly, drop it,” She hissed, and walked out of the small library, and Draco only really had the presence of mind to recognize the sun had set, leaving the space blue and dark, and the room was significantly chillier.
“See now, that’s fine, if you don’t want to celebrate then I think you’re weird but it’s whatever, but if you insist that it’s a muggle holiday when it’s been a wizard holiday for even longer and demand everyone celebrate that instead and follow your customs and deem the original customs and traditions ‘dark‘,
Beauty and perfection were two concepts strongly ingrained in Ursa’s personal morality that she yet had no understanding of in the least. Maybe she was attractive, maybe she wasn’t, but it didn’t stop Aunt Petunia from using her as a show pony in every local pageant as a way to earn extra cash. The only money spent on those pageants was the occasional dress, and Aunt usually just “borrowed” another girl's makeup when no one was paying enough attention. Ursa was kept on a strict diet and daily routine leading up to those pageants: she could have no acne, she had to be a certain weight, she couldn’t complain, and she had to have Aunt Petunia lecture her on the stakes of losing every night.
Dumbledore’s voice boomed, he stood up from his golden chair at the head of the staff table, and his face was grave, “Prefects, escort the students back to their dorms, please. No one panic, everything is under control. Teachers, if you would follow me,” He finished with a smile.
“Isn’t it fascinating what results shutting up has?” Blaise grinned at her, and she smacked his arm.
“Longbottom, Neville,” McGonagall shouted after what felt like forever, and Ursa perked up finally hearing a name she cared about. Neville looked like he was on death row and marching in front of the firing squad. He sat down, and Ursa and Draco grimaced seeing how pale and clammy he looked.
“TROLLS! IN THE DUNGEON!” Professor Quirrell screamed, shoving the Great Hall doors open with a surprising amount of force, barreling down the main aisle of the Great Hall and stopped in the center, “I thought you ought to know.”
“I’m aiming for Slytherin, although Ravenclaw wouldn’t be bad, the other two houses are alright but don’t align well with my values,” Ursa said, “We never introduced ourselves, did we? I’m Ursa Potter, and the pretentious ponce with Elmer’s glue-all for hair is Draco Malfoy.”
As a last resort, before giving up here, he cast a detection spell over the house. The results were inconsistent and not at all remarkable. It only seemed, as if the muggles on their departure had trapped some animal in their cupboard under the stairs by accident, that now, weakened by thirst, was on the edge of dying.
Draco and Theo exchange a look and then smirk. This, now, is Theo's speciality. “It is easy, Blaise. You go to the dormitory and sleep. And tomorrow, you may retrieve your wand. And we will say nothing. And you will say nothing. Because if you do, your failure becomes your grave. You will lose honor, school, everything. And your mom can't help you out there. In short: you are out. And we are watching you.”
“Another.” That was clearly Draco. Then the clinking of cutlery. A sharp exhale and a little shuffle followed. “Sorry. I can't. No more.” Potter's voice, stronger than before, but still far from what it had once been, hoarser, a little forced.
And it did react to calls directed at the Dark Marks as they found out accidentally when Severus was summoned while checking the inevitable progress of Potter's demise. While he brushed over the mark, frowning at the discomfort and calculating if he could leave the boy alone, Potter hit the floor suddenly, writhing in pain and begging, begging for it to stop. Severus tried to administer some pain relief, but the only thing that ultimately helped was putting distance between Voldemort's magic and that piece of him eager to regain it.
Instead Severus took out parchment and quill, considering whom to involve best. Molly Weasley of course excluded herself on account of being an unbearable, self-righteous hypocrite, who could not even keep her own brats in check, but arrogated to be the first authority on good upbringing for every other child. Not even mentioning the fact, she probably only inserted herself into Potter's life for the perks of his fame. Lupin might have been better, for he seemed to genuinely care not only for the boy but for the children in his care in general. Alas, Severus' history with the werewolf and his bad standing in Hogwarts forbid his involvement. The longer Severus pondered, the more he dreaded how pathetically short the list of candidates was. Could it really only be a coincidence, Albus' treatment of the boy and his past had isolated him like that?
He could practically hear Draco frown. “Professor Snape's orders.” Not quite, but he let it slip, deciding that indeed making a modicum of friendship with Potter complied to his wishes.
Potter, and it always comes back to him, is friends with the house-elves, the rumors say. Theo wouldn't be surprised anymore, if it was true. He on the other hand is used to being obeyed. He does not threaten or disturb those busy workers, just states his needs, clarifying place and time, then leaves again. He can't wait to get back to their playroom, have a little sleep himself, maybe even have a cuddle with Potter too, he seems the type to make it worthwhile.
“It's not the taste...” Potter breathed apologetically. “I'm just... filled, after a week of only potions.” It had been more than a week, Severus knew. Suddenly he was glad, Potter didn't. It meant, he did not remember the whole misery. “Thank you, though. For this. For coming.”
The universe as a whole must have gone slightly mad, because Harry feels himself nod, fully relaxed, yet hungry for more. For time outside of his grid, for... whatever is there for him. More than slightly mad actually, he realizes, as he feels bindings appear around his hands and neck, the feeling, though more than a bit unsettling shooting right into his cock.
Again on his way to his personal lab he had to pass Potter's door, again, despite the wards – or because of them – it was slightly open. Potter could not pass them bodily or with his magic after all to close it again. This time though no noise came from within. Reluctantly Severus stepped towards it and opened it all the way.
At least some of his rather pointless Gryffindor courage remained. It was strangely refreshing. “Two more days.”
Severus sighed. If the means did not justify the ends anymore, if he could not allow himself such thinking, what did it lead to? And how was he to avoid Potter's far too early full return?
“I know, I just find myself liking people who have the potential to network me into a position of power.”
“Anywhere but,” Neville blurted out, and immediately went pink again, embarrassed he said it out loud.
“A hair straightener,” She replied, and went back to reading, but Draco noticed she stopped turning the pages as quickly as before.
“Did Dumbledore know that you’re after this hidden thing?” Ursa asked, and the professor looked at her curiously. She has decided to ignore the fact he said he’s not a good person and any other disparaging assumption that could be made about him from this scenario, not letting the one adult she’s come to trust and rely on be viewed as anything but upstanding. He must have his reasons, anyway.
If Ronald Weasley doesn’t die of natural causes by the end of the year, Ursa’s intuition says, on behalf of her frustration, that he’ll disappear under mysterious circumstances some time soon. He’s organized most of his house against her, and has gone to such lengths to vilify her that he’s tried to bait her into cursing him.
