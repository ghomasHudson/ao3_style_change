he wakes up.
Harry reached out and grabbed his elbow, just like Draco had. But he held on, unlike Draco who had let go immediately. He hoped Draco would understand what he was trying to convey with that gesture.
They laughed, but Harry noticed his smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.
Quite beside himself, Sirius glared at her. “What do you want?” He was far too exhausted to bother with pleasantries.
“Yes?” He says.
Lavender passed by and whacked Harry on the head. “You still plan on doing those heteronormative Christmas stuff, Harry darling?”
A part of him wanted to change back and bring his smelly cousin home for a bath and warm bed. Another part of him urged to heed Remus’ advice. He let the logical side win out this time.
“You’ve done nothing but give, and give, and give, even though the rest of my family did nothing but hurt you. You looked past all that, and you saw me as me, not the Malfoy heir. Not a stuck up prat. Not a death eater.”
Draco laughed. It lasted only a second, but the sound made Sirius’ heart well with pride.
3. Harry gave a manly shout. Okay,
And that was how half the group ended up crammed in Mrs. Dabney’s kitchen.
"I live here?” Malfoy says, looking a bit cross. “In this dormitory of which you are blocking the door?"
Remus putting a blanket over them when Teddy and Sirius fall asleep on the sofa reading stories.
"Ye…" The prince doesn't finish the sentence as Harry lifts a single hand up and the Hogwarts wards are ripped from Dumbledore's control, and the Albion wards shove Dimitri into the stone floor.
“That is for many reasons. When the idea for blood rites came and we bound the gifts of our lines to the blood and made blood rites the key we lived in a different age and a different time.” The man said.
"But I thought you said that I couldn't use the family magic." Harry's head is swimming in confusion but James rests his hand on his shoulder reassuringly.
“Very well, sir and for your other robes, bearers cut of course. Now you said full wardrobe. What station is your house, and yours in it?” The tailor inquires.
A question from Slytherin house table brought Harry's attention to the fact that the great hall was silent and many were looking at him.
"I'm sorry what paperwork?" the reporter asked.
Overall when September 1st came Harry and company where nervous and excited to return. They were excited for new classes, curious about a new defense teacher, but also worried about the headmaster, now that the board had changed what was he planning?
"I am loathed, to correct a teacher as they are to now better than me but as Lord Longbottom, stated on the train, and I quote If the charter had been removed then the founders magic in Hogwarts would have faded Hermione. No more hat, no points system. None of it, Hogwarts can't function without the charter in place. The castle itself would transfer back to Peverell Lands if the Hogwarts Charter was removed. So unless you are declaring the school closed until the Headmaster and board of Governors can work with and furthermore locate the heirs of Peverell, and the founders, to establish a new charter for the running of Hogwarts I do believe the Hogwarts Charter stands. Furthermore I believe the unsaid statement that it could only be repealed and a new one put into place by a sitting monarch which we have not had in over five centuries, as the last one was ratified by a sitting Monarch, the issue is moot point Heir Potter's point stands." Stated Heir Zabini.
"Perhaps you may consider having the boy do both an inheritance and a legacy test, to see what all is hidden in his father's bloodline, after all, if the Peverell that the Potter's are rumored to be descendants from is merely blood locked within him, he will go for a much larger price." Suggested Lucius.
"A blood prophecy trace huh, sure you don't just want a prophecy trace done. I just turn here to the ledger and search your names a then press a finger on all the prophecies that have your name on them. It's a lot simpler and doesn't require all the…" Croaker replied.
“I do not know my King.”
"No right to what, no right to tell them the reason why that boy who ran from this room in anger did so? No right to tell them why the vassals and cousins of that same boy even now glare at you for your words? No right to tell them the reason why the house of Potter has never ended the blood feud with house Grindelwald even though its only remaining member was exiled to the prison of his own making? I have every right. Because of the way the house of Potter was treated after the war that boy will not answer those questions. He is too much like his great grandfather Charlus for that." Dumbledore quivered under the man's glare. "You came home Dumbledore. After requesting of the ICW for Grindelwald not to be given over to the Potter family for execution, but to be imprisoned in Nurmengard. After all that, you came home and had honor, prestige and power handed to you. What did Charlus Potter come home to? He came home to a decimated house; he came home to pick up the pieces of a broken house. He came home and had to look into his son's eyes and say he failed. Knowing all that Charlus came home to, what did you do? You put him on trial for charges of war crimes. You banned his house and all who served house Potter from Ministry service, or ever serving in ICW service. As such your actions, and your actions alone cut the number of Aurors in half, and left Britain half defenseless in the jaws of its own monster of a dark lord. You criticized house Potter in the Voldemort war for using hired hands in the form of Hit-Wizards, encouraging these men to instead enroll and join the Aurors core forgetting in your own haste that as they served house Potter that avenue had been cut from them by you, yourself. Outside Britain, the entire blame for the Voldemort blood war is on your shoulders. If you had left house Potter alone, they could have done their duty and protected Britain, long before it came to war again, knowing all that is it any wonder the boy is on the verge of blood feud?"
"Welcome, welcome, students, please take your seats." Sweetly said Professor Umbridge as she waited for everyone to find a seat. Even Harry could see the room had been expanded from last year as they know had over fifty students instead of the twenty-five from last year. "Good Afternoon Students."
"Pup?"
“Let me finish, you know in muggle primary you study things like history, and I had always been fascinated with Rome. I never knew that Rome almost fell before it truly grew to shine.”
Headmaster Dumbledore said scolding, "Young man I understand a desire to be unique amongst your own peers, however those robes are not the Hogwarts uniform, ten points from any student within the Hall not wearing proper student uniforms, continue hat."
"and the other entrances?" Harry asked.
It is from these letters that I learn of much that has happened to you, and of the many decisions you have been forced to make. I agree with my grandmother that I would like to meet you, and perhaps exchange a few letters before we meet. If grandmother believes you are important to Egypt's future than you are a friend I need. In this I have also enclosed a few of my own secrets that we may stand on equal terms…
For Draco the past weekend had been mindboggling. He had finally begun to see that although his father was far more shortsighted, his grandfather was shortsighted as well. The two men that had once taught him the important of having contingency plans had in fact it seemed forgotten that little Slytherin rule as they threw all their chips in at the same time, onto the same side, never seeing the storm brewing on the sidelines.
"The Pendragon line was, is our monarchs. Our world is for the most part divided into 3 social layers. We have our common people, this layer includes, muggleborns, recent immigrants, cadet lines, and the younger houses. We then have the Noble houses, and then the High Nobility that still exist and served in the Pendragon court." Neville said trying to explain.
Final thing due to circumstances out of our control, i.e., Real Life, my Beta's have left this fic. This means that I need a new beta, P.M. if you are at all interested. As always Read and Review.
"Even if that story is true, I fail to see what message he is sending." Marvolo snapped his magic starting to flare before meeting with an icy magic emanating from the stone below that made his magic recoil.
“Trial Transcripts are immediately duplicated and filed by the royal magic inherent in the Magic of Albion, they cannot be misplaced. However, I need not tell you that minister as you were informed almost 18 months ago as to this fact and ignored it. Which is why house Black through House Potter has now levied a case with the ICW.”
"Good Afternoon, Professor." Responded Harry and the rest of the class. Afterwards she went about explaining her course goals.
"Clever Haldris, very Clever, but I know all to well just how far the house of Potter is willing to go, to hide its true power, about as far as it is willing to go to hide it's mistake. I'll make you a deal Lord Potter, give me Albion. Give me Albion, and this all ends, my searching, the blood feud, all of it. Just let go, Haldris, let your house finally have peace, let Albion have peace, I'll give you Britian, a kingdom all your own, I'll let you take care of Lord Le-Fay, your friends will be safe, just give me Albion. "
“Another Potter Industries startup is the company Potter Securities.  It trains and works as a hiring firm for both magical and muggle security forces. All hit wizards employed by the company as part of their training are required to live a year in the muggle world, in case we are at any point in time, assigned to a muggle client we don’t stick out like a sore thumb and give away our purpose. In that year we are assigned a house to stay in and work in another pure muggle startup owned by Potter Industries, I was assigned here before it was given to your Aunt and worked at Grunnings for a time.” Edward answers.
"Of course, now how about you students finish eating as I explain the other safety measures in place." With that Madame Delacour went through step by step the document that outlined the fund and the usages of the fund.
Harry arrived outside the Hogwarts words without fanfare. He quickly made his way through the castle before arriving at Myrtle’s Bathroom. Opening the sink Harry paused and called for stairs, descending the stairs he quickly found himself at the cave-in, casting a strong reparo he continued, and passed through the second gate with little fanfare. Summoning several house elves he had them pop the Basilisk to the dwarf bank with ease. Wondering around feeling as if he was missing something, he eventually levitated himself up into the mouth of Slytherin that had not been closed after he had killed Tom.
For Harry the last few weeks of classes and the last Hogsmeade weekend was surprisingly quiet. He had expected to have to face off against recriminations against his house from the Ministry by now. A recrimination from Lord Le-Fay he did not expect until after he got back from his holidays in Egypt, but Marvolo was a Slytherin and a patient planner. The Minister and his cabinet were not, the glares from Umbridge had not helped his senses either.
"Of course," sneered Umbridge, "though how much the half-blood will go for will be nominal, compared to if he was a pureblood."
"What was who talking about?" Neville asked, as Marvolo only picked him up high off the ground, beginning to cut off his air supply, as his collar cut into his throat.
“I’ve missed you to pup.” Looking up Sirius focused onto Alrick. “I wasn’t secret keeper, didn’t even have a trail, take veritiserum if that would settle your nerves for you Alrick.”

Harry had mixed feelings as he shed his formal robes for more casual dress robes. This morning had been easy, he didn’t care if those people liked him or not. He just wanted them to respect his house. He wanted to send the message that he may be 15, but his house was in good hands. Now was the hard part his family.
Darkness, once banished, shall be released
“Well, we are hosting the annual Malfoy Winter Solstice Ball at the manor, and I have a few trips to Diagon Alley planned as well as a possible trip to Rome planned, but nothing to specific. What about you Daphne?” Draco answered.
“Well, Minister, as when I arrived at 7 and was informed that the location was still as my letter prescribed in Madame Bones’s office. Where I have been seated for the past hour waiting for her arrival as seen by no less than 6 ministry Aurors. I also have the welcome desk’s security guards certificated document to prove the fact that I was told it was in Madame Bones’s Office. Therefore, I was not late; you merely started early and are required to begin again Minister.” Stated Harry emphatically.
Blaise took in a sharp breath, at the looks he got from the other students he answered the unasked question. “My family is from Italy, Rome to be exact. It’s well known that when Rome fell most of the textbooks and journals and such on Roman magics was burned with the city. This caused most of Rome’s magic to be classified as a dead magic branch, most assume that it is because of the fire that burned Rome, but that wasn’t true, we were losing the access to our magics long before then. The oldest families are known for creating things, wards, spells, rituals, etc., but the strongest families, can create magical creatures, of a sort. The Evanshade house is known for having created the first Basilisk. Someone in Rome created one of these creatures, it was fine at first, they were called the Battle Centurions, and people ran before them, a full knights suit made of Iron, with the full power a single element at its disposal, they were monsters of defense, then the golden centurion was forged, he was made with additional offensive enchantments, he was also given intelligence as he was to lead the rest of the iron centurions into battle for Rome, it didn’t work.” Blaise answered, before Harry continued.
"Charlus Potter left the ritual room at Potter manor, where he had just finished the rite that they had been away for and walked into the next room only to have the head of house ring appear on his hand. It's called a violent transfer for a reason, it knocked him out for two hours, while it showed him the last hours of the previous head, as is customary when the ring goes immediately from one head to the next in such a violent manner. When he arrived at the scene, my men had been there for three hours, and Charlus Potter was infuriated. His five siblings, and parents had all been in that field, and now at 45 he was now beyond his wife, and son the last of the main Potter branch. Of the previously over a thousand strong Potter family, only about twenty remained after that day." Mathews stated his eyes gaining a far of look.
He had had a few blood locked lines one of which was Le-fay, and the other was Slytherin. He had only told Mortimer of the Slytherin line. While like many lines Slytherin had a secondary way to access or awaken the family magic, it would never give him access to the full family Grimoire or to the Slytherin Lordship for that he would require Blood Rites. The blood Rites Ritual was tricky though and had several requirements. Firstly, the freely spilling of ones own blood. Secondly the cleaning rituals that had to happen beforehand. Thirdly, a place to perform the ritual. This was perhaps the most important, for the Rite could last from one day to two weeks. At this point you were trapped in your own mind and could not escape, if someone attacked you could not defend yourself. It was why many went to the Goblins to do such a thing. Was the benefits of being able to claim not just the Slytherin but the Le-fay Lordship as well be worth it to expose himself to that level of vulnerability?
“Allow me to formally introduce myself Lord Slytherin.” Michalis answered only to be interrupted before he could continue.
Harry had been expecting to be placed in the Beginner or Experienced groups but after a few duels with his classmates and accidently disarming Viktor, he had been placed in the Trained category. After tutoring that night Harry had approached professor Krum and asked him "Why did you place me in the trained group I've never been trained to use a blade, disarming Viktor was a fluke."
Harry woke the next morning and pulling on some traditional Egyptian morning robes slipped out to the upper balcony attached to the bedroom that had been chosen for him. From the balcony he took in the view of both the city and the surrounding countryside. Hearing Neville calling his name he walked back out through the bedroom to their shared living room area.
"Harry's right but it does happen to get worse." Sirius interjected.
"You are aware of the standings of the Ancestral Houses of Albion. You are also aware of the division of vassal when it comes to the houses are you not?" Ignatius quietly and calmly replied.
The scene before him froze at his words and he could hear voices around him. “He speaks well.”
“No, need,” Harry interjected. “Sirius Orion Black is both my Godfather and my Blood adopted father. The Black family magic would have executed you if you had attempted to have me killed in such a way.”
“Well, you are aware that Sirius blood adopted you right? She asked. At Harry’s nod, she continued. “Sirius and I were cousins before I was cast out of the Black family. I even have a daughter Nymphadora Tonks that is also a Metamorphmagus.  Which reminds me how did you get it?”
"What has had you so preoccupied Draco? You've been distracted and preoccupied with something for days," she responds.
Harry reaches into his bag and pulls out his copy of the Hogwarts charter quickly flipping through the pages and stating. "Deputy headmistress, I call upon your power as head of discipline for the students, by article 3 section B of the uniform code. All heirs or lords of any line may wear the clothes befitting their station in all areas and to all functions of the classes excluding classes, they may attend as a student. As such I appeal Professor Snape's point deductions. Furthermore, according to the Uniform code, article 1 section 3, All bearers are to wear a denominator of their status in the appearance of a different Hogwarts uniform described below. I won't read further as this is material you as teachers and furthermore as Headmaster are to have memorized. If you look at Jean- Marc's robes he is wearing the traditional Hogwarts bearer robes. As such he is in uniform and cannot be penalized."
"You understand that as a bearer, I am expected to have more than one consort?" Harry asked, at Viktor's nod Harry continues. "I Haldris James Potter due hereby accept your request of courtship. May our houses learn much of each other." Harry then pulling up his sleeve extends his arm to a now kneeling Viktor who takes the armband from Harry and places it on his upper arm. Gently pulling his sleeve back down Harry blushes as a camera goes off.
“Yes, Coby, that would be appreciated.” The house elf nodded and led the way. As they neared where Harry distinctly remembered the blue sitting room, he could hear raised voices coming through the open main doors. Quickly, asking Coby to show them to the back entrance, they promptly entered through the back door unnoticed by most in the room. In the center of the room, an older middle-aged woman had just open handed smacked the boy before her. As she moved, you could see the broken tea set on the floor between them.
"Pity I was rather looking forward to a nap in the morning this year." Answered Seamus Finnigan.
Harry turned to run towards the doors as further screams began to echo around him. Passing the stairs up to headmaster's office as Marvolo and others came down it, Harry paused and glared at Dumbledore. "Dumbledore, you need to send the school into lock down mode."
Harry had just finished putting the last of the breakfast plates in the sink as the doorbell rang. Knowing the comings and goings of the neighborhood Harry knew that the doorbell could only be one set of people his guard.

"Hogwarts is about be attacked by Grindelwald, yet you will not interrupt Dumbledore's meeting for him to raise the wards."
"What you have to understand is that as commoners we don't have a strict requirement for OWLS. As a commoner, or a non-titled for us OWLS, lets us know which classes we can continue studying at NEWT levels. It may affect our jobs, but as there is no stigma to us retaking an OWL in sixth and doing self study and sitting the NEWT a year late, we have opportunities to correct any mistakes in testing." Stated another Gryffindor boy, Allen Spencer, one of the heirs of Neville's cadet lines.
"Godfather, you where there when father very articulating explained why a law must be specific in what it is discussing otherwise you may see yourself caught by said law. The same applies here, it does not matter if that was not the intent of the decree. What matter's Professor Snape is what the decree actually says. And is says the gathering of three or more students." Draco interrupts now openly glaring at his godfather.
Draco nodded and continued "Pendragon later was crowned king, and eventually with the aid of the three ancestral houses of Emrys, Le-Fay, and Eveningstar, who eventually became the kings chief advisors, and keepers, they conquered all of Europe and formed it into the Empire of Albion. After reigning for almost, a millennium, the heir to the throne was kidnapped and the remaining Pendragon's were slain all save the king who also eventually died, living just long enough to put into place the ministries, and councils. To this day almost a half a millennium later we wait for the return of the Pendragon line that we might have a king again."
“Yes, there is,” at Sirius’s look to continue Harry took another deep breath. “I’ve chosen to undergo Blood Rites after the Winter Solstice. I realized as I challenged Marvolo, that he’s not going to stop. He’s focusing on the house of Potter and I need to pull his mind away from past hurts and give him an actual challenge, I may not wish to be king but as it stands I cannot allow Marvolo the chance of even trying to take control of the wards. I feared that in doing blood rites I would be forced into the kingship, but I’ve realized that if the land truly wants me as king me willingly going through blood rites won’t stop that. At this point the only thing me not going through blood rites is doing, is hindering me from properly protecting those that are relying on me to be their defense.”
The kings letter was illuminating when the meat was enquired about, was informed of the stipulations behind the sale and informed of the reasons why it could not be sold to him. He had immediately launched an investigation and discovered that the British Goblins had been colluding with several wizards and had ultimately committed treason to the crown, the treasonous Goblins where being hunted down. However this left gaps in Gringotts Britian‘s upper management therefore, Ragnok’s son Griphook and several other Goblins wishing to join a new clan and have a greater opportunity for more wealth, where given permission to do so, with Griphook as the new king of the British Goblin Clan. As the gravest of these errors had been done to the House of Potter, the house was offered in recompense a few free services and the gift of an increase of a further 5% ownership of Gringotts which surprised Harry as house Potter owning any shares of Gringotts’s at all had not been on the reports he had received.
"Sirius, I don't think a single teacher has actually fully read the charter, Bullying runs rampant throughout the entire school. The teachers have done nothing to stop it. If something doesn't change soon Hogwarts is going to shortly face ICW educational reprimands."
"I assume you are asking what I can do to make it no longer worth it for him to mess with the house of Black? Well as vassals of house EvanShade, house Potter also was privy to quite a few state secrets that house Le-Fay would not wish coming to light in any way. The rest pertains to our position at court. The house of Potter had many responsibilities in our position as master of the kings Armies, some of which we share with the house Longbottom, such as the training of the Prince's. Other responsibilities were uniquely ours. One said responsibility was the war and armament tithe, along with the weapons tax." At Neville and Sirius's startled look he continued.
“She is merely weeping over your pain, young one. Admiraldis, spoke out of turn though he is merely married into the family so do not mind him. You addressed James in a manner befitting your station. Your grandmother weeps for what it means that you call him Guardian. Now sit and tell us of the world and how we may help you.” Harry calling an elf, having it bring a chair, before thanking it and relaxing into the chair. Telling his predecessors all they needed to know to better aid him in the coming months. The news of an Aunt and cousins that weren’t Petunia and Dudley warmed his heart, causing him to quickly write summoning invitations for the family, with the guidance of Charlus and Fleamont Potter. The excitement was tampered by learning the reason why his aunt was almost two decades older than his father and that her grandchildren were his age.
“Merry met and may your gold ever increase Lord Potter, there is much to do today, so please be seated will your guards remain in the room for our meeting or do you wish for them to wait outside?” Sharptooth asked.

“Recently unlocked ability, a side product of the Rite of Awakening.”
“I fail to see him as a threat, he will fall in line like the rest when I rise to Kingship, you I can see will not, this will be a right and proper lesson for you of what will happen should your line continue to subvert mine.” Marvolo answered.
"In many ways the eldest of the ancestral families gave us our magic in the manner that we know it to be now. It is why we know that we are still missing the names of several houses. We know the magics existed we have the gifts they forged, we've seen the remnants of their power, other lines have brought back the understanding of their magics, but we don't have all of the pieces to be able to achieve the feats of magic our ancestors did."
“Would you be willing to swear an oath of secrecy to me?” at the man's nod Harry continues. “I am Haldris James Potter, the Lord of the Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter, Heir of the Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Black.” He said as he flashes his rings.
As Peter left, Severus walked in and up to the dais on which the throne sat. “My Lord, you summoned me.”
Artemis cut in answering, "Grindelwald spoke of house secrets that not even house Longbottom knows. The fact of the matter is that house Potter, like Le-Fay, like Black, like Malfoy, and so many other houses, has magic that if used against Grindelwald would end this war.
“Well, then I suppose I would love some lunch.”
"Not as well as the testing, but well none the less. It is very interesting how many people overlooked, the requirement of being a fully upstanding citizen, and clear by right of veritiserum of all high crimes, such as being an accused follower of a dark lord/lady. It seems people saw the word Voldemort instead of the word dark lord/lady and thought that Grindelwald and the one or two others we've had didn't count."
"Do so and do not return until you have the answers I want."
"Well another would be why he called you Lord Malfoy; I thought your son was Lord Malfoy?" answered Hermione.
“Ok, we can do that his magic cries I want to help it. Will this hurt?”
“I’m spending this break with the Weasley’s. We don’t have much planned just family time mostly.” Hermione answered.
“Blood locked gifts go hand in hand with Family Magics, for example, it says that Battle Magic the Potter family gift was unblocked today. Today you performed the Ritual of Awakening you awakened the Potter Blood and Magics within you as it has been accessed within the past 3 generations it has not become a blood locked Legacy. A blood Locked legacy requires for the ritual of Blood Rites to be performed, and at that time if you pass the test, you will have access to both those houses’ power, in the political arena and to their magic.”
“I don’t know Hermione I don’t know.” Sirius answered her. “Did you come just to see Harry or?” he trailed off as her face went from tears to fury before going back to tears.
"Now please put the secondary boards away, and please pull out your notebooks." He tapped the board behind him, and the board filled with text as did the boards along the staircases. "I understand that not all of you can see the board, however the boards along the walls will also display what is on the board behind me. Therefore, please take note of them. This is how I wish for you to head your class notes. This will make it easier for you as we go along and will enable you to use the search function on your books. This will also give you ease of access to them as we go along as I will expect you to use the same book from now until graduation, these books will be graded along with quizzes and test that will go into helping you prepare for owls in this subject."
"It does not matter if he wants it or not, the betrothal is signed. He is a mere bearer anyways, he has no say in the matter, all he is, is a broodmare for me to get a strong heir out of and then execute. Its all you bearers are good for anyway, how a bearer like you could even become a lord is beyond me." The prince belligerently interrupts.
As visitors and allies joined the four for dinner that evening some where rather surprised by the difference between the boy they saw today, and the Lord they had seen in the Wizengamot a scant few weeks before. Reconciling the difference between the two had several lords shaking their heads, while older lords could only draw similarities between him and Charlus, who they remembered spoiling young Alexandria, at such dinners. The following evenings fully formal dinner with many other lords and ladies of the Wizengamot, allied, and not saw the return of the strict and professional man they were coming to know.

“Since you did not see fit to attend on time, I see no reason to reread the charges and represent the evidence.”
“Except that the next lord Peverell will be a bearer and have stronger ties to Albion than he will to us. I may not be able to say more but I can say this: Grindelwald will wish Charlus Potter had been allowed to give him his death by time that young man is through with him. He will change the political climates of all the empires and lead our people as a whole through the trials that come after the convergence point.” Nefertiti answered him.
"When the day of reckoning came Charlus Potter first fought with two of Grindelwalds lieutenants before going head to head with Grindelwald for over two hours. If Charlus hadn't taken a friendly fire spell to the back," here Mathews glared at Dumbldore, "he would have won that duel, but instead a worn and tired Grindelwald that had been hunted for over two months with no rest by Charlus Potter faced a fresh and ready Dumbledore. You Brits seem to think that Dumbledore won that battle on his own strength, but I was there, he didn't. I'm not saying he couldn't have, he just didn't then. Dumbledore took Grindelwald in and was hailed by the British as a hero, while Potter faced charges and dishonor from his own countrymen. In mainland Europe, where the long arms of Albus Dumbledore never reached, we knew what the house of Potter had done. It may not be known why or what Grindelwald was after when he attacked and killed the Potter house, but we knew what the Potter's had done, in retaliation. Charlus always seemed to have some clue, no doubt given to him, from seeing his father's last moments but we never knew for certain." A voice from the back answered.
Sirius asked, “I suppose the Minister is downstairs?” She nodded and he got up fetching his over robe from the chair he fallowed Hermione downstairs, neither one noticing that Harry was finally waking up.
“Just how close is house Potter to Ancestral?” Daphne asked asking the one question Harry did not want to answer.
Hogwarts, Scotland
“Xerxes my love, do not listen to her, her age is finally catching her, that Potter boy will be a fine addition to the court here, and a fine husband for little Ameria, you know this.” Celeste said pushing her way into the Pharaohs arms gaining his quick attention. “The boy knows nothing of the Nile court, his power is useless here, it would not take much to bind him to this land Xerxes.”
“Harry is currently undergoing the ring settlement of a violent claiming. He is currently unconscious and depending on how much of that the ring chooses to show him, he will be for a while, as it is already at the three-day mark, he could be out till morning. He is going to be absolutely furious.” Neville answered and all those in the mirror call blanched. “For all the ministry’s plans the fact that Sirius Black blood adopted Haldris, making Haldris his heir will be what shoots them in the foot especially when knowing him, he brings this up in front of the ICW at the trial on the 8th of January.” No-one had any reply to that observation from Neville.
"I'm sure you were pup however we have some new things we need to talk about, Krisp got back this morning with his report from the ministry. He wasn't happy, and you aren't going to be either."
Harry stopped reading and thought about what he had read. Turning to several other books that pertained to the High, and the Noble laws he spent the morning forcing himself to read them, hoping to find a kernel of knowledge in them to aid in the future. The pad of paper asked of Mimsy and quickly fetched for notes was quickly filled with more summoned as Harry focused on his task rather than the recently discovered betrayals.

"It's a fact that he has to live with, he's the one that called the rights of ascendancy to be in play. Besides our tests are only to prep him for the last test." Neville answers.
"Time did not stop moving despite the rejection of the other houses, and shortly before my fifteenth birthday, our family magics, didn't just receive a boost they morphed into house magic, and we lost all control over them. When the call to arms came to years later and I went to war, I went to war without any access to the magic of my house. Our forces without the innate magic of our house suffered, and my father scrambled for a way to reclaim our magics, and he did. He found a ritual that he performed, but he did not fully understand the price of the ritual, and both my grandfather and my father both lost their lives, in returning the power of our house back to us. With this news I returned home to take up the mantle of Lord Potter, when I returned to the battlefield, we were given new marching orders to join with the armies of Lord Evanshade. The day before our forces joined, the then Lord Evanshade fell in battle. I took command as his son, a young man the same age as I, returned to Camelot to take up the mantle of Lord. When he returned he relied heavily on me, and I him as we battled together. After the war we returned to Camelot, and the alliance continued, until eventually I swore the house of Potter to the house of Evanshade, we served as their vassals for almost three centuries before the houses amicably separated."
"Arrogant as always Mr. Potter, well you won't be getting away with it this time, you'll be expelled for certain." Snape spoke glee evident in his tone.
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
"Our positions were the way they were, because of the family's history with house Pendragon." Neville answered.
"Prerequisite locked means that you have a prerequisite to meet before you can take the mantle of lord. This could be any number of things, it could mean you have to already be a parent, it could mean you simply have to be 21, the guidelines should be available to you upon request from the goblins, but you must request it. Power locked, means that your core has not been through the proper rituals to connect with the house magics, a costly fix, as you have to use the goblins ritual rooms, and it's a series of 5 rituals altogether but necessary ones. My own test would have said such if my father had not undergone them with me after my birth."
Magical Core – 270 - 66% Blocked
Needless to say, after vowing secrecy oaths to Harry the students that left where trying to comprehend the changes this made for Magical Britain’s political landscape.
"That is his proper uniform professor." Zabini interjected. At Snape's glare he continued. "I may only speak for myself in this professor, but this is OWL year, I had hoped to actually be studying potions not listening to you insult and belittle Potter." The stunned Potions master had indeed started class, but Gryffindor had lost a whopping 50 points and it was only the third day of school. Snape's parting comment had infuriated Harry.
Upon arriving this morning to Malfoy Manor, and requesting to see both Lucius and Draco, he was quickly informed that they had already left for the Wizengamot trial this morning. He turned as he ate breakfast and spoke in pleasant tones to his old friend and classmate Marvolo. In this discussion, they talked about the trial that would be happening this.
With Burden in their steps
"You do miss Granger. You are also classified, much like me as a commoner and as such have to abide by those rules. This is one of those situations where those of Noble birth are held to a different set of standards. I'm only included in such plans, because my house is a cadet branch of house Potter but common law still in some places applies to me." Stated Jean Marc.
“I know that house Potter has been on the precipice for a few generations now.” Neville answered.
"However, Seamus for example is different and has the more normal circumstances with his Mum not having final say as her head of house still lives. Her father…"
“It was blocked by some of the magic Voldemort did that night when the magic was undone recently it was one of the gifts unlocked.”
"I see no need for that, he is merely going through a phase, apologies will be made soon enough and things will return to how they were before. Besides we have no need to use such titles in the classroom, our students are equals calling one student heir/heiress, and the other Mr./ Ms. Would not give them the feeling of being equals." Stated Dumbledore.
"A simple misunderstanding I'm sure." The Minister said quickly backpedaling.
Neville spoke up and gave his offering next. "James Potter you were my godfather you were taken from us before you could fully embody that title. Yet as I stand here today beside your son, my own godbrother I hope that wherever you may be, that you are laughing besides those of our line that have gone before. May we as godbrothers honor your legacy and through you the legacy of our Houses."
"I assume that the ability to speak parseltongue has allowed you to bond, but what about you and Marcus?" Neville asked.
To Harry the end of October had come too quickly, and it was once more the hated day of October 31st. However, Harry couldn't help but think to himself that for a Tuesday it was not all that bad. His assignments for the week are already done, and he was fully prepared for whatever the day sent at him. Harry dressed in a completely black ensemble was therefore, surprised to see Sirius waiting for him, as Harry walked into the Great Hall, that morning.
"Well that's one way to show exactly why you are nothing but a mudblood." Theodore Nott muttered loud enough for the entire room to hear, from further down Hermione's row.
Hey. That’s right. They came here to pack because the bus taking them to the ski park was coming after dinner. That didn't leave much time at all, did it? Maybe Harry could just stuff all his clothes in the bag…
Sirius stood up, despite the chair’s obvious distress, and pulled them both in for a tight hug. Remus joined them too, and Harry knew his eyes were shining with unshed tears. Sirius was pressing kisses into their hair. Draco was sobbing silently into Remus’ shoulder.
“Is my son… Is Draco really here?” Sirius almost didn’t hear her. It was quieter than a whisper.
“Harry.” He said it again, louder this time. “I think you should call me Harry.”
Harry controlled himself the best he could. He shook his head, holding onto his sides. “Nothing. Where’s
Harry took the hand, trying not to think about how nice it felt to hold Draco’s hand. Because that would be stupid. Because Draco probably isn’t too happy about having to hold his arch-inconvenience’s hand.
“I'm sorry.” He was saying, voice remorseful. “I don’t want to leave, but I have to. I have to because I don’t want you guys getting hurt because of me. I don’t want to be the reason you feel pain. It’ll kill me.”
"Hey, Potter." ...Or maybe we can throw that thought right out the window. "What is it Malfoy?"
They claimed muggles were just playthings, toys sent for wizards’ enjoyment. She spent seventeen years in Azkaban before being released and then killed soon after.
“It’s used for… selective breeding! It’s used for selective breeding and it works by… err… it creates a barrier of sorts around the two intended plants and-” Ew.
in first year.”
“Then why did he leave?”
“I do not
To his surprise, Draco laughed, shaking his head and moving to bonk his head with Harry’s.
"I know. I left them for Dean so he wouldn't kill me." Dean elbowed Harry. "Like that." He  added.
Merlin’s blue balls. Harry forgot to tell Seamus! He didn’t think the other boy would finish his lessons so soon. Harry needed to think of an excuse – and fast!
“Yeah. I’ll go do that”
He slinks deeper into his chair at mention of them. Why would they even agree when he, Draco, had been nothing but a complete arsewipe to their children?
Yes, it was dysfunctional. Yes, Draco used to be an absolute dick but now he’s trying to differentiate forks from spoons, and he’s got a beautiful way of expressing gratitude.
“Well…” Was Malfoy seriously going to try to argue back? If so, the git was even crazier than Harry thought! “Of course, your concerns are valid, Patil… But if your goal is to establish other holidays at Hogwarts, would boycotting Christmas set a good example? I mean, wouldn’t it just make other students think they could just ruin the spirit of holidays if they wish. You should show that you embrace these holidays and respect the same way you do your own. That way, you wouldn't be labeled a hypocrite.”
,” he insists.
The way Draco shivered when Harry cast the warming charm would remain etched in the back of Harry’s head for a good while, he was sure. It was just so… so innocent yet- yet tantalizing. Harry licked his lips.
Title taken from Soldatino. Where are all my PJO fans at?
The next time Sirius visited the alleyway, he went as himself.
“Malfoy…” Potter says, suddenly. “Are you cutting carrots?”
After a bit more shopping (during which Draco forced him to buy a frame for his glasses. “Consider it an early Christmas present if you must.”) they headed back inside. Ron told them Hermione had disappeared with Mille.
“We were going to have an ugly sweater competition and I completely forgot to get an ugly sweater.”
The woman glared daggers at him. “Bold of you to assume I haven’t read this book before.”
“You can choose any bed, dear. Ron doesn’t stay here anymore.”
So Draco did. “I couldn’t stay there… I couldn’t do that when I
She arches a thin eyebrow. “I think you know the Weasleys better than I do, Draco.”
Harry could tell it was driving Remus up the wall too. Because Sirius wouldn’t stop blabbering about how he’d never get a toaster that fine. That everything reminded him of the toaster…
Harry finally opened his eyes.
“Can you turn it back?”
He smiled tentatively. Draco’s face was a soft pink, probably from the cold. His hair was mussed up from wearing the hat, and his lips were just a little blue. Harry wished he could’ve stopped that happening. He found himself wishing he could prevent winter from giving Draco the shivers.
Neville raises an eyebrow.
It made one wonder just what was so special about those fairy lights, that two adults would deem worthy of mutilation.
The kid finally looked up, pale and silver-eyed thing.
to tell him." Harry says, feeling like tearing his hair out. "Otherwise you're going  to end up marrying your best friend's sister and having three, horribly named children - the  second of which will become best friends with your crush's son.
“What?” Why couldn't Sirius just
Moony would have told him he shouldn’t have wandered out in the first place, but in Sirius’ defence, spending so much time cooped up in No.12 Grimmauld Place (and it was grim when Moony wasn't around) made him feel sick.
“What? And leave you alone?”
that?” the same time Draco decided to say “Congratulations.”

. Along with mismatched socks and black slacks. In other words, it wasn’t ugly at all.
Really? This was how Lav planned on breaking the big news? Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine, bad news first.”
- Him fumbling for his glasses, and then finding them under his pillow.
Harry almost replied with the same thing, when he remembered Draco told him his family celebrated Yule. “Happy Yuletide.”
“Let the boy speak.” An
a death eater.
A compromise was reached (one based on Kale crisps) and a movie watched. Children put to bed, and the wine taken out of the cellar.
Now Zabini was clearing his throat loudly. “Now, if that’s everyone, Hannah and I would like to proceed with the judging.” Then he turned to Draco. “Draco, babe, I’m going to need you to step aside for a bit - your glamour is ruining the uglies.” Seriously. What was with Slytherins and their pet names? Sooner or later someone’s going to think they’re all dating.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He took her out for breakfast?” Draco asks. “That’s unique.”
Then Harry did something he decided he would blame on his head being slammed against the tree earlier. He beckoned Draco close, and when he was close enough, Harry pulled him between his legs. Then, he pressed his face into the crook of Draco’s neck.
And that was how Draco found himself ‘keeping an eye on Potter’ as he stirred the batter. Potter and Mrs Weasley were belting out Warbeck’s songs along with the radio.
Draco was looking anywhere but Harry’s face. “I- Well, I… Sirius has done a lot for me. Letting me sleep here and giving me clothes and a wand and I- I’d like to repay him somehow. Show him I’m grateful…”
Harry blinked. Yes, the portrait still hung there. The décor was still bright and welcoming. The unidentified blond was still dozing under the blanket, without a care in the world.
counted as a morning-after mess they had to clean up. Weekly Movie Night was one of the things they started doing together during eighth year. It was a fun way to spend Tuesday nights, Harry supposed. Sometimes Ginny and Luna joined them. Neville only did when they watched James Bond. He said he could pass for a Bond. Harry wasn't so sure.
Harry nearly had a heart attack when Draco’s face sneered at him from Ron’s shirt. “What the fuck, Ron?” He glanced at Draco and Hermione who were trying to hold in their laughter. Then he noticed Blaise Zabini near the french doors, wand pressed between his lips like a cigarette. Apparently Zabini thought he looked very cool when he did that.
Lucius’ son. He’s ‘Cissa’s. He’s
“Never.” Draco spat, looking flushed and red bothered.
He wanted him now.
Harry said “Wait, you can
"I have a problem with forks and spoons too," Harry goes on. "I spent eleven years never knowing magic. Sometimes I forget I have a wand. It's easier for me to do things the muggle way."
Teal walls with gold accents instead of charred black ones. A fully equipped, sparkling kitchen stood where Sirius’ little impromptu one should.
“Narcissa’s boy.
“I really think you should write back,” Ernie had told him. “You know never know,” he murmured darkly before vanishing into a corridor. Harry found that rather creepy.
Mouth dry, Harry forced himself to look Draco in the eye. “What are you doing?” Hadn’t Draco told Zabini he wouldn’t get in the hot tub?
Nineteen-year-old Martha Archibald cast Imperio on two muggles and forced them to kill each other while she watched. The one to cast the second Imperio was found to be her father, Luther Archibald.
“We used to have Shakshouka often, when you were little, Harry.” Remus says. “We lost a lot people in the last war, Harry. Your father didn’t do well, when someone passed. He grieves and grieves. The only things that could cheer him up was Shakshouka, and you, Harry.”
Madame Pomfrey said they could leave that evening with the very comforting assurance that the potion would wear off after around 6 days. Which would make it the day after Christmas. AFTER.
“Why aren’t
They hadn’t tried to fight the inevitable last night.
The studious Weasley, who was sitting on the floor surrounded by tomes, scowled at him as he passed by. None of the other gingers seemed to be around. Thank Merlin for tiny miracles.
Malfoy looked at Harry like he’d heard the world’s most dumbest sentence. It was a very natural concern to have, goddamn it!
Because we need something soft after all that tension. Here's Harry mid-gay crisis and Draco who wants to say thank you (and patch things up with Harry, but he needn't know that) + Harry having a (tiny) mother-hen moment.
Harry, who was the one trying to sleep in the first place, had a much harder time falling asleep after that little episode. But he tried very hard, seeing as they had a whole bus ride waiting for them near the Cairngorms. Whose idea was it to go somewhere that far anyway?
by having you hear it from the wrong person. This means a lot to me and I… I’d rather ruin it myself than have someone else poison it.”
they name it the dog star?”
Zabini plops down behind Neville, and snakes (ha!) a hand around the Gryffindor’s waist. He  rests his chin on the shorter boy’s head. Neville smiled like a love-struck idiot. Because he
And then he was gone.
Harry followed his godfather and Moony to the stairwell. He stopped in his tracks, heart in his throat, at the sight before him.
"In the future might I suggest reading the official paperwork sent to you even from someone you may not favor, as I assume you never read Lord Potter's report on the inner workings of the black knights, he sent at the beginning of the month. Before you deny ever seeing it, it is also a standard packet in the Wizengamot paperwork, you are given when you claim your seat. In your results for this test, I unfortunately must say unfortunately you have failed. You received one and a half points of the available five. You received a point for not moving forward with immediate action and instead waiting for more information, and you received half a point for the placing of troops at the ICW and ministry building though lost the second half of that point for only thinking of government and not the people and order them in defense stations at the schools or at the five Albion Great Squares, or not having the houses deploy the house guards."
"Thank you, heir, Malfoy you have honored your line today." They both nodded to one another.
"It is cold out here, shall we enter or are we waiting for others, I thought they were already here." She asked.
“Wait why did the house of Potter… Oh!” Blaise said.
Once embarking on the train just like he had done on the train to Hogwarts back in September, he merged the compartments of the car into one, and his friends quickly joined him.
Harry was confused by the letter but also wary, he had placed his house on notice that something could happen over break, but he couldn’t give any more notice than that.
This has been an absolute pipedream. I can't even believe I-  First fic I've ever stuck to till the end. Whew.
“What did she say?”
Molly Weasley puts an arm around him. He stiffens at first but feels himself relax into her warm grip.
Harry squeezed Draco’s shaking hands. “Do you trust me?”
” was anything to speak of.
“Molly!” Harry blushed. “I'm staying with Sirius. Not gallivanting around with Voldemort.” He joked.
Anyway, tell me what you think of this chapter! Would love to hear from y'all.
It’s nice to think Dean trusts his judgement. Though Harry probably just wore him down. Still, he had Dean’s blessing to fuck shit up.
Harry responded by pelting his godfather with throw pillows. He did
I hate my life right now. What is it worth being alive when I can’t go back to Hogwarts? When I can never find out why Draco didn’t write to me. When I will never see my friends again. Maybe it would have been better if I had died when Voldemort killed both of you, or when I met him again only two months ago. Then I wouldn’t be alone and locked up now, but with both of you. That sounds so much better than this.
Harry looks back at the door and shrugs. “Sorry,” he says without meaning it.
“Thank you,” Draco says. He smiles at Harry. Who would have thought after all that happened with James that they would sit in the bathroom discussing the possibility that they are having a fourth child? Lily was a miracle and a blessing. And Draco would have been okay if it would have been just her and Teddy. Nathan was a bonus, wanted and loved. And now they get even another miracle. It’s hard to believe but Draco is sure. There is another little Potter in the making inside him and no matter how terrifying that is, Draco can’t help but be extremely happy.
“Teddy, I just want to sleep some more,” Draco tells him. “I’ll be fine later. I promise. Now go see if you can help Harry, he’s feeding Nathan downstairs.”
“Told you,” Neville says. Harry pushes Neville to the side and then folds up the note. He slides it in the pocket of his robe. Malfoy responded. That is all that matters. Soon he won’t be able to resist Harry anymore. Because there is no way that Harry is going to leave him alone. Not when he’s all Harry can think of these days.
“Is she moving?” Harry asks.
This will be my last letter to you. I promise I’ll be with you before everyone will wake up tomorrow morning. I just can’t do it anymore. Not now with Hermione
Friday 4 June 1993
“Please don’t leave me,” Draco stutters. “Please make it stop. Make it all stop. I just want it all to be over. I want to die.”
“Well, let's go then. You can sit in the back, and we’ll get you back before he even notices that you were gone.”
"You're not listening, " Ginny says. Harry turns his attention back to her and watches as she looks past him and spots Draco. Her smile wavers as she looks at Harry.
It all happened in a flash, one moment we where patting Buckbeak and the next Draco was lying on the ground, blood pouring out of his arm. Buckbeak was standing over Crabbe and Hagrid tried to wrestle him back into his collar. Of course, Crabbe was fine, Buckbeak hadn’t hurt him, but he was still screaming that he was dying. Hermione told him to shut up and she and Blaise almost got into a fight with Crabbe and Nott. I don’t know how that ended, because I was running after Hagrid who had taken Draco in his arms and was rushing him up the hill back to the castle.
“I wonder if Iris is going to get sorted into Gryffindor,” Neville says.
I think I had the best birthday ever this year. Draco arrived on the morning of my birthday, kissing me awake. It was good to have him in my arms again, to have him close. I hate it when he’s not with me. Draco said he had the worst month of his life, trying to avoid his father as much as he could and missing me like crazy. And then he went off to go make me breakfast while I showered and got dressed.
Sirius isn’t doing that great in the love department. Professor Lupin and Tonks have started dating. And to make things worse, Sirius has to see them get cosy together quite often. This is because our home is the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. I know I don’t have to explain what that means to you, as you were both part of it in the last war. But it means that all meetings take place in our kitchen. Draco and I are banned from these meetings. Almost everyone agrees that we are too young to be involved. Sirius doesn’t agree with this, so he updates us afterwards when most others have left.
“But if Pettigrew is hiding as a rat, he’ll be impossible to find,” Ron says. “There are probably a million rats around Hogwarts.”
“He is,” Harry stammers. “But I want to be more than his friend.”
When we went to find her after class she was in the library, fast asleep with her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. We woke her up and she was all confused at first. She thought she had forgotten to go to Charms, but that couldn’t have been the case, she was right behind us until we reached the door of the Charms classroom.
‘That must be hard,’ Draco writes. ‘To love someone who doesn’t love you back.’
Dear mom and dad,
Harry James Potter.
Harry and James both nod with grins on their faces.
Harry shakes his head and looks back at his brother. “It’s fine,” he says even though it’s not. Harry had hoped that this new focus, that their search for Pettigrew, would help him forget about Draco and the pain inside his heart. But it doesn’t. Everything seems dull without Draco. Harry can’t put his mind at rest, always dreaming of Draco and what could have been.
“Have a good swim,” the woman says and then she continues her walk over the beach. Harry follows her with his eyes. He can’t move. The energy he’d had only moments ago has evaporated. The truth of what has been robbed from him and Draco slamming in like a hammer. They could have been that woman in a year. They could have had a new little addition to their family. And now it’s all gone, just like everything else in Harry’s life.
Harry bites his lips. “I hope so,” he says. He doesn’t want to think about how he won’t be able to look after her if she’s not in the same dorms as them. Not with Pettigrew on the loose.
But this will be all he will plead guilty for.
Hermione hands the note to Malfoy who reads it. Harry watches him as his eyes skim over the words over and over again. Malfoy blinks a couple of times and Harry thinks he’s fighting more tears. Malfoy drops the parchment and stands up. He doesn’t look at any of them as he practically runs out of the compartment. Harry moves to go after him, but both Neville and Hermione stop him.
We have our first match at the end of next month, and Draco is training really hard to become the best seeker they have. Adrian teases him every time Draco gets worried. Hermione says it’s fun to watch. She and Daphne come watch us train most evenings. They do their homework together while we fly. Only Derrick and Bole don’t like it, they’re afraid she will tell the Gryffindors about our tactics. Miles told them to shut up, that Hermione was cool and that she would never betray her best friends like that. And I agree with him.
“This whole Malfoy thing,” Ron says. “Has that to do anything with you being gay?”
He left just before I started this letter. He promised to come when the Ministry is going to do their test to prove that Draco and I have this special soul bond. I keep forgetting the name and Draco is asleep right now so I can’t ask him. I’ll tell you the next time I write to you.
Harry laughs and Malfoy rolls his eyes. ‘I don’t know,’ Harry writes. ‘Maybe it’s because they have similar meanings.’
After all, that Professor McGonagall took Ron up to Gryffindor tower and Professor Snape made sure I had something to eat before escorting me to the Slytherin common room, informing me of the new password and telling me to stay out of trouble from now on. Everyone was already off to bed and I silently walked down to the familiar dormitory where a big four-poster bed with green (not green Harry, they are emerald as Draco enlightened me last year) velvet drapes. My trunk was already there and I took out some pyjama’s and quickly got dressed for bed in the bathroom. Draco his drapes had already been closed and I didn’t think he was still awake. But Blaise was and he told me it was amazing how I arrived at Hogwarts and asked if he could tag along next time.
But back to my birthday. We had breakfast and then Draco and I just hanged out in the garden. The family Tonks and Professor Lupin, who keeps insisting I call him Remus or Moony, joined us. Mrs Tonks had baked a cake for my party and prepared all these crazy dishes for lunch. It was nice to see Sirius light up with Remus around.
The weather gets warmer by the day. Exams are sneaking closer. Not that Harry studies for them. He and Neville are occupied with other matters. Every afternoon after class, they go outside and walk around the castle. Together with Ron, they researched the spells needed to detect and trap rats. And now they go out every afternoon to check their traps and place new ones, in the hope they will catch Pettigrew.
Charlie’s friends came only minutes later and they rigged Norbert up in a harness so they could suspend him between them. We helped them buckle Norbert safely into it and then they were gone. We slipped back down the spiral staircase. I felt horrible and didn’t feel like going back to the dungeon where I would find an upset Draco. And I didn’t really get a chance to get back there, because we had forgotten to put the invisibility cloak back on. I left it on top of the tower and I’m sure I’ll never see it again. And on top of that Filch was waiting for us at the foot of the stairs.
“You were with me, that was all that mattered,” Draco tells him. It will be the one thing that will always matter. It’s Draco’s biggest dream, to always have Harry with him. A dream which is slowly dissolving into a nightmare.
When dinner was finished, Draco and I headed back to our dormitory, only to be stopped by Professor Snape. He wanted to explain that he just wants to make sure that I’ll be safe. There is a change that the broom came from Black and that its sole purpose is to kill me. And I understand that it’s all about my safety. But for only a little hour I was the owner of a real Firebolt, the best broom there is at the moment, and I didn’t even get to fly it. I’m sure there is nothing wrong with it now, but who knows what it will be like after they subjected it to all sorts of anti-jinx tests?
“Wow, daddy, you look like shit,” Teddy lets out.
“You’re disgusting, Ron,” Hermione tells him.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Harry signs. “If Draco dies because of you, I will kill you personally.”
After a couple of minutes, he pushes Harry out of his mind. He takes a couple of deep breaths and forces his body to stand up. He leans his hands against the wall and focuses on his breathing. He needs to calm down before the others arrive. For now, he needs to forget that his entire world has just chattered into a million pieces. He’s still Draco Malfoy, and he’s not allowed to care about the boy wonder. He’s the enemy. The one that needed to be destroyed.
And we kind of were when it happened. It was just when Hermione asked me if there was any truth in the other boys saying that I’m bent. And I was kind of glad I didn’t have to answer that because I’m not really sure. I’ve never liked any girl, but I’ve also never felt anything for a boy, so I just don’t know what I like. Maybe I don’t like any of them. And that’s fine too, right?
“You’re not, just tired. We all snap sometimes when we’re tired,” Harry had assured him.
‘What’s wrong?’ Draco signs.
“You are the most beautiful boy I’ve ever seen,” he says. Harry smiles at him and takes another grape. He takes another sip of the wine. It tastes a little funny and Harry knows he’s getting tipsy, but he doesn’t care. The stars are out and Draco looks at him like he’s an angel or something. They kiss and slowly their clothes get removed from their bodies. Draco’s pale limbs intertwine with Harry’s darker skin and Harry forgets all about the stars and the wine. Draco’s fingers open him up slowly and then the moment is there. For the first time in his life, Harry becomes one with another person and he can’t believe how perfect it all feels.
And that is not all. I’m nervous, like all the time. I feel like my whole life has been heading up to, and will finish with, the first task of this stupid tournament. And now that I know what the task is, it has only gotten worse. I have to go and face a dragon. A real dragon. And they are enormous and wild. I know this thanks to Hagrid. He made come to his cabin at midnight last weekend and asked me to take my cloak with me. Draco helped me get out of the dungeon close to midnight and then I was off to see Hagrid. When I got to his place he told me to follow him but to stay quiet and hidden under my cloak.
‘No. I don’t mind,’ Draco writes. ‘The world has always been silent. Sounds will only be distracting.’
“And one day you will be,” Andromeda says. “Now who wants one of those delicious cookies Harry has baked for us?”
He turns and runs away. He falls on his knees between the first trees of the Forbidden Forest. Nobody will follow him in here. And he will only stay for a short while. He should be safe for just a few minutes. Just a couple of minutes to get himself back under control. To fight the tears that keep coming. To stop the heartache inside him, to forget the hollowness that consumes him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, sure. Draco, honey, do you want to go and put your trousers back on?” Harry asks. Draco doesn’t want to, but he nods anyway. A tear slides over his cheek, and he bites his lip. Slowly he sits up. He doesn’t want to let go of Harry’s hand to move to the dressing room. Only a couple of hours ago they relaxed on their sofa, joking about how in a couple of months Harry would have a little baby on his chest and won’t be able to get up all the time to get coffee for Draco. The image is stuck in Draco’s head. Harry holding their baby. A baby that will never be.
“Yeah,” Justin shouts. “I think he used a Body-Bind Curse. They were waving their hands around and then Longbottom turned and tried to run away. But his entire body froze and he tripped forwards. I think his nose might be broken, but otherwise, he seems okay.”
“So we just wait?” Draco whispers. He blinks his eyes and hopes they aren’t as moist as they feel.
So for an entire week, I had to pretend that I went to St. Brutus’s Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys, was not allowed to do any ‘funny’ stuff and I was to keep a civil tongue when talking to her. I woke up Hedwig as soon as Uncle Vernon left to tell her to go stay at the Weasley’s for a week, that it wouldn’t be safe for her to stay with Aunt Marge around. I’m sure one of her dogs would go after her. After that, I made sure all my cards and letters from friends, just like my schoolbooks were put away safely.
Harry gets Draco to look at him again. “It’s just us now,” he signs. “Can you tell me why you’re scared?”
It turns out the Knight Bus can take stranded wizards and witches anywhere they need. I didn’t want to put too much attention on me so I pretended my name was Greg Goyle. I’m sure Greg won’t mind, I’m sure he will find this story funny once Draco tells him when he goes back to school. It would take me 14 Sickles to get to Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire, so I looked for my last coins and paid Stan. He helped me get my trunk into the bus and off we were. Stan wanted to know why I wanted to go to the Malfoy’s and I told him that I knew Draco Malfoy from Hogwarts and that I was going to stay with them for a while because my mother wasn’t feeling well. Luckily they believed my story and didn’t ask any other questions.
Draco confirms and Harry drops his head. ‘Wood is going to kill me,’ he writes.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. He doesn’t know what else to say. He knows Harry is right, that they can’t expect the entire world to put their life on hold just because theirs is.

Dear mom and dad,
“Yes, extremely silly. You should forgive me,” Fred pipes in.
Since then he talks to me during Potions, telling me what he’s doing and making sure I understand. It helps a lot and I feel like I’m getting better at it now. Zabini is also starting conversations with me now in the dorms when we brush our teeth and get ready for school in the morning. It’s kind of nice to have someone to talk to when I’m in the dungeon.
Myrtle told me how to do it. And I’m going to. She’s right if life is this bad it’s better to end it. And I’m going to. When I’m dead I can be with you and everything will be okay. So tonight, when everyone is asleep, I’m going to go to the bathroom and break a mirror. I will use the glass to cut open my wrist. Myrtle told me to not do it horizontally, but vertically, from the bottom of my hand and then straight down over the veins that are visible there. She promised it would be quick and painless. She asked me if I would come to her as a ghost so we can haunt the bathroom together, but I told her I wanted to go to you. That it is time I would get to know my parents. And she understands, even though she is sad to see me go. But it’s for the best. I know that now. The world will be better off without me.
I love you, and I miss you.
“I can’t have Neville going after Pettigrew,” Harry says.
Draco stops in front of the picture of Lupin and Tonks. Teddy puts his small hand next to them and smiles at them. “Hi, mom and dad. I’m going to be a big brother,” he tells the picture. “Can’t stay, uncle Harry is making grilled cheese sandwishes.”
Lily lets go and then turns to Draco. “It’s good to see you again,” she says. Her hands sign along with her words and Draco answers all politely, as the proper boy he’s been raised to be. At the same time, Sirius pets Harry on the shoulder.
Luckily for us, Hermione knew it was Devil’s Snare and that it hated light. She wanted to light a fire but complained she had no wood. Ron than screamed at her, asking if she had gone mad and if she was a witch or not. After that Hermione made bluebell flames come from her wand and the plant loosened its grip so Ron and I could pull ourselves free.
“Does he use Polyjuice?” Draco asks.
And now I’m writing to you. I don’t think I’ve ever written a letter this long, but I just wanted you to know everything.
“Sure, if you are ever alone,” Neville says.
And there is another image Draco doesn’t need. “Not the dining table we still have in our house?” Draco asks. The one Harry brought along when they moved into their own house.
“Professor Snape,” Remus says. Harry snickers at the correction, one his father or Sirius would never make. “I don’t know,” Remus continues. “Lily might have something to do with it. But I’m not sure.”
“Even if that means never having children of our own?” Draco asks. He doesn’t want to ask it. He already knows the answer. This will make Harry leave. He will see that he’s better off without Draco, that he doesn’t need Draco to breathe.
“It’s okay, sweetheart,” Harry says. He’s knelt in front of Draco’s chair, and his hands hold Draco’s arms. Draco has no idea when Harry moved around the bed to comfort him.
Harry sobs into his knees. “Don’t die,” he says to the empty air. “I don’t mind if you never talk to me again, but please don’t die.” The idea alone is terrifying. A world without Draco is a world not worth living in.
“I can’t tell you,” Harry says. “I promised dad. It has to do with how Pettigrew got out of Azkaban. Dad told me.”
“Yes, I have,” Harry sneers. He clenches his hands for a second and then he changes his position again.
After a while, we got up and walked with Fawkes on our tails out of the chamber back towards Ron. Ron had managed to move enough rocks in the time I was gone to make a gab where Draco and I could climb through. Professor Lockhart was also still there. Ron said his memory was gone, that Lockhart had no clue who he was or where he was.
Neville doesn’t say anything else. He turns around in his bed and falls asleep again. Harry lays down in his bed, but sleep doesn’t find him. His mind keeps drifting back to his nightmare and his heart aches.
Harry shakes his head again. His dad is wrong. There is no way that Draco feels the same way about him.
Harry blushes even more. “It’s complicated.”
“Has he only just turned deaf?” Remus asks.
Remus places his hands on Harry’s shoulders and looks at his face. “You’re alive. That’s all that matters,” he says.
They continue with the words maybe, you, me, please and thank you.
"Yeah, I'm sure you're right, " Harry answers. "So what time will you be by to pick up Teddy?"
But I should really go do some homework now. I write again soon.
Burke has the decency to look guilty. “Draco is the official patient. He has to be the one to agree with whatever we are going to do now.”
Draco confirms and he lets Harry help him up the stairs and into their bathroom. Between cramps, they both remove their clothing, and Harry turns on the water. Steam fills the bathroom, and for some seconds, the hot water feels nice. Until another cramp takes over Draco’s body and he falls against Harry. Harry’s arms are strong around his waist and hold him up for some time.
The kiss lasts forever and, at the same time, it’s over much too quickly. Draco and Harry smile at each other for some time. Then Harry climbs on Draco’s bed and sits down next to Draco. He pulls his legs under his butt and places another kiss on Draco’s lips.
“You know I do,” Hermione says. Sometimes Harry hates her honesty. He doesn’t want to hear that his plan is stupid. It’s the best they could come up with. If this doesn’t work, Harry doesn’t know what else to do.
On the day of the match, I was very nervous and woke up very early. I stayed in bed with Draco’s arms around me and tried to relax. I think I didn’t do a good job because I woke up Draco. We kissed for a long time until I felt a little better. We went down to breakfast and I just tried to eat some porridge, while Draco started to make us both toast. The rest of the team joined us not much later. Everyone was kind of nervous, which made me feel a little better.
Draco looks to the side, out of the window. He watches as some leaves fall from the tree, as they slowly wave down and out of sight.
The final is at the end of this month. We are up against Gryffindor and I really hope we win. Marcus has us do extra training sessions on Saturdays. But that’s fine. I like being able to fly this much, and Draco is with me on the team so we get to spend all that time together.
Just when all hope seems lost a bright wolf runs up to them. The Dementor raises and turns around. Harry looks and sees his Uncle Remus standing in the door of the carriage, his wand stretched out and a stern look on his face.
“Myrtle told me you didn’t want to kill anyone. I didn’t believe her until I saw you lower your wand when Dumbledore died,” Potter said from the other side of the cell on the day he was brought in. Draco ignored him at first, but Potter was persistent. Maybe it was to not hear the screams of his Mudblood friend while Aunt Bella took all her frustration out on the girl. Or to forget that the pile of bones in the cell with them were from his other best friend, the Weasel Blood-traitor. Draco had told him not to eat the food that was brought to them on their second day here. Potter had listened, but the Weasel couldn’t stop himself. He screamed in pain for hours before the poison melted his voice away and he just perished in silence. Draco didn’t realise he was crying until Potter had placed an arm around him and cried with him.
He then went on to inspect Cedric’s and Krum’s wands, which were both fine. And then it was time for my wand. He took much longer inspecting my wand compared to the others. For a short moment, I was scared that he would tell the entire room about it’s connection to Voldemort’s wand. I was sure Rita Seeker would love to know that and put it in our stupid article. But luckily, Ollivander didn’t mention it and declared my wand in perfect condition.
“My Lord,” Bellatrix says. She waves her knife around and a sick smile sits on her face. “We’ve found the hideout of the wolf. Only he was alone.”
The lead investigator is brought in. They only searched the magical records. Shacklebolt orders them to look to the Muggle records. And when they come back they hold a piece of paper stating that Harry James Potter married Draco Lucius Malfoy twelve years, four months and six days ago. Three years after they ran from the magical world when they didn’t believe that Draco wasn’t a Death Eater. On the day they had been together for exactly six years. Eighteen years ago, when Harry hadn’t though and just reached out and kissed Draco. And all it had taken was Draco saying he didn’t believe that the Dark Lord was the great saviour everyone thought he was.
Love you,
Draco went on and on about how his father was an idiot. The attack had been nothing big and Draco was fine. Madam Pomfrey had healed his wounds in seconds and there was no lasting damage. And Buckbeak didn’t even do it on purpose. It cheered Hagrid up a little to see Draco come to his defence, seeing as Draco had been terrified of the Hippogriffs before I helped him approach them.
Dear mom and dad,
Neville looks at Hermione with widened eyes. Harry’s belly flutters and his mouth falls open. “You’re learning signs?” he asks.
Draco rolls his eyes and then shakes his head.
That night Malfoy was bragging in the dormitory about how he was better at flying than the Weasel, that’s what he calls Ron. Nott kept making amazed sounds about how he couldn’t believe how stupid Longbottom was, not even capable of flying a broom as a full-blood was just a decrease. I tried not to listen to them, but it was hard. And then Goyle said that it was worse to see how I couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy, making them all turn on me. Asking me if I liked what I saw, stating I was a poof and should keep my eyes to myself. Malfoy threatened to hex me if he caught me looking at him again. I tried to tell them I’m not like that, that they have nothing to worry about, but they wouldn’t listen.
“Bloody hell, Pansy. Spill it out. I haven’t seen you like this, since that time you got drunk and ended up in Blaise’s bed.”
History of Magic is all about the Gargoyle Strike and the Soap Blizzard, which are both very boring, so I won’t say too much about that. Hermione loves it and is reading all these extra books about the events. Sometimes she goes a little bit overboard with her studying, but that’s fine, because she does help a lot when it comes to my homework and essays, so I’m not complaining.
It’s the right thing to say. Draco brightens up and then moves in to kiss Harry. Harry lets him. They might not kiss for some time after this. Harry will ask his parents if Draco can come to visit. But Draco’s parents might not agree to it, and then they won’t see each other for two months. So Harry makes sure that Draco knows he’s loved before he has to go to a home where love seems to be lacking.
Iris doesn’t move out of Harry’s embrace until her friend Johanna comes to fetch her to go study in the library. She hugs Neville and Harry before she leaves. Harry watches her sprint out of the Great Hall, all excited about spending her Saturday morning in the library. Harry will make sure she will keep enjoying every minute she spends at school. He will keep her safe. Just as he will keep Neville safe. And Ron. Mrs Weasley will kill him if anything will happen to Ron. And Harry isn’t ready to die. He’s still got plans for his life. He needs to catch a rat, teach a stubborn Slytherin how to use sign language and then become a professional Quidditch player before he joins the Auror force. But to make sure that happens he’s got to make sure Neville never gets close to Pettigrew. Because a life without Neville is unimaginable. He’s been Harry’s brother for as long as Harry can remember, and Harry will always need his brother by his side. So, there is only one thing he can do. He will go after Pettigrew alone and kill the rat. It’s the only thing he can do to keep Neville, Iris, Remus and Sirius safe.
Harry looks over the lake and shrugs. “I can’t help it, Neville,” he says. “He’d made studying fun, somehow. And now it’s just painful.”
I lost the Marauder’s map. Draco says it’s because I got cocky. I took the invisibility cloak so it would be easier to sneak in and out of the basement of Honeydukes. Draco was waiting for me outside. We decided not to tell anyone else I was coming. Hermione had told us she was really worried, with Ron being attacked and all. And Blaise said he wanted to spend the day with Luna. I think they’re dating. Oh and Greg told us he kind of fancies Daphne, so we told them I wasn’t coming and Draco made up an excuse to leave them alone as soon as possible.
Harry raises his hands. “Sorry I almost died and wasn’t able to win the game.”
The first day there I helped Ron, Fred and George de-gnome the garden. It was really fun. We had to pick up the gnomes and spin them around in the air before you fly them over the hedge. Fred and George made it into a game to see who could fly them the farthest away. Gnomes look really funny by the way. They are small and leathery looking and have a head that looks like a potato.
The cup was a port key. When Cedric and I took hold of it we were transported to a graveyard. We had no idea what we were doing there so we took out our wands just in case. Cedric was holding me up when a figure in a black robe approached us. I thought he was holding a baby or some cloths. But when the person came nearer my scar exploded. The pain was horrible. I grabbed my head and if it wasn’t for Cedric I would have fallen to the ground.
Draco closes his eyes and lets out a deep breath. “I don’t know, Harry. Do you think it will help?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny sighs but doesn’t move. Harry sits back up and tries to smile at Neville, but his mouth won’t cooperate. This is harder than he expected it to be.
We didn’t waste any time with showers that morning, or hair braiding, or breakfast. We pulled on the first clothes we could find and started to make our way out of the castle. Only to get stopped by Professor Snape. He took one look at the Firebolt and demanded to know where we had gotten it. We told him it was sent to me for Christmas. Snape took the Firebolt from me and examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. He wanted to know from who it was and when we couldn’t tell him because there had been no card or message with it, Professor Snape decided to confiscate it so it could be checked for jinxes. He said something about Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick stripping it down and I think my heart stopped right there. Draco uttered something and Snape just said it was necessary and that it would only take a couple of weeks. He was sure I would have the broom back in time for the next Quidditch match. And with that, he walked away with my beautiful new broom.
“Harry, there is nothing wrong with Ravenclaw,” Hermione says in that accusing tone of hers.
He won’t talk to me. I don’t know why, but he won’t talk to me. As if things aren’t already bad enough without him being a complete bastard. It would have been nice if he would be on my side right now, but I’m sure that’s not happening any time soon.
After lunch we had division, and Professor Trelawney didn’t waste any time to predict my oncoming doom. I have again difficult times ahead of me. I’d almost fallen asleep in her class, my head resting on Draco’s shoulder when Professor Trelawney made me pay attention and said I was clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn. Draco laughed next to me, but the professor paid him no attention and went on, saying I was born in midwinter. I corrected her and said I was born in July and by then Draco had to hide behind me to hide his laughing.
Draco laughs and pulls Harry in for another kiss. Their lips smash together, and Draco crawls on top of Harry’s lap, his legs around his hips. It doesn’t take long before their sweaters lay somewhere around them on the floor and Harry starts to open Draco’s trousers. Draco feels relieved when Harry works his way inside him, knowing he’s just as eager as Draco to get what they want.
Riddle answered that question for me. He said it was an interesting question and quite a long story. He said that the real reason Draco was like this is because he opened his heart and spilt all his secrets to an invisible stranger.
And in Defence against the Dark Arts, we are supposed to be learning about Doxies, Gnomes, Snails and Imps at the moments according to our book, but professor Quirrell only talks about vampires and how to fight them off. We are also supposed to learn spells, like shooting green and red sparks and a wand-lighting charm. Ron has shown me how to make the sparks come from my wand when we were reading through our DADA book. It was very easy and I feel like I could be good at DADA if the professor would just stop obsessing about vampires. I’m glad some of the charms are also part of the charms curriculum, like the wand-lighting charm.
Harry turns to look at Neville. It’s the first time he’s called Draco by his first name. “You called him Draco,” Harry says.
After that Black told us how he escaped from Azkaban and how he came to watch me during Quidditch. He says I fly just as good as you dad.
But it was amazing to fly again and Fred and George forbade me to try out for the Slytherin Quidditch team after I caught all the apples they threw at me with ease. They think I would be an amazing seeker with my reflexes and all. It reminded them of their brother Charlie, who was a seeker during his Hogwarts days. And it would be unfair to the other teams if I would give Slytherin the advantage of a talented seeker. I wish I could talk to Draco about this; he was talking about trying out for the Quidditch team this year, as a Chaser and I wonder what he would think if I joined as well.
“I’m sorry, mom,” he whispers. It’s getting hard to keep his eyes open. So he closes them and lets the darkness take him.
We were both shocked when we reached the Quidditch pitch. The pitch was no longer smooth and flat but filled with hedges. At that moment still small and easy to step over, but in a month time they will be about twenty feet high, turning into a maze we’ll have to navigate for the third tasks. When I told Draco about the hedges on the Quidditch field he was just as upset as me. I assured him that Mr Bagman assured us that the field will be back to normal after the tasks and that we would be able to play Quidditch on it again. Not that Draco believes this. Adrian and Miles told him it would all be fine, but Draco just keeps shaking his head and complaining about how unbelievable it is that the pitch has been destroyed. Adrian joked that Draco is turning into a real captain, stepping into Marcus footsteps.
“If I go see a mind healer, will you stay. Will you stay with me?” Draco asks.
That was the end of our conversation and Draco and I left to go get dinner at the great hall. Everyone wanted to know if I was fine, as they all had heard I had fallen down screaming during Divination. I told them all that I was fine and we agreed to meet up later at a private spot to discuss what had happened.
Zabini sits down next to Ginny and signs. “You are a fool if you think Draco had anything to do with that engagement. His parents arranged it all, in the hope he will come to his senses.”
We sat like that until the task was about to start. Mr Bagman blow on his whistle and I walked into the water. I tried to believe Professor Snape’s words and forced myself to set one foot in front of the other. Later I heard from Blaise and Greg that I looked like a ghost. They both knew something was wrong and they even made it towards the judges' table to make sure I was fine.

Tuesday 18 May 1993
Neville fumes, but does sit down. “He’s here,” he says.
Harry shakes his hands. He’s not an attention addict. And even if he is, that is not what this is about. It’s about Malfoy.
Andromeda sits down on the chair across the room with her cup. She blows over it and then takes a sip. “Teddy is getting good at making tea. He wants to do it all by himself, but I think he’s still a little too young to handle a kettle filled with boiling water.”
I’ve told Draco about the visit of Aunt Marge, and he told me I missed a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the situation. He told me I should have played Uncle Vernon, tricking him into signing my permission slip for Hogsmeade. In return for behaving around Aunt Marge. Off course it wouldn’t have worked, since I kind of blow her up and everything. But Draco is convinced it could have worked, that it would have helped me keep my temper. I told him that if I hadn’t lost my temper we wouldn’t have seen each other at all this holiday. And Draco agrees with me that would have been horrible and that our current situation is preferable.
Harry James Potter.
“I thought,” Harry mutters. “I thought Neville was dead.”
Harry rocks on his feet and grips his gloved hands together. He stares at them and then takes a deep breath. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I know I should have. It’s all so strange, you know.”
I haven’t used my cloak again after that and kept my promise not to go looking for the mirror. I sometimes wish I can forget what I saw because I keep thinking of you mom and dad. And I’ve started to have nightmares. You both keep disappearing in a flash of green light in my dream, while a high voice cackles with laughter. I wish Hermione was back already so I can talk to her about it, see what she thinks. And I’m afraid if the nightmares continue when the other boys come back that they will use it against me. I don’t want them to know I have nightmares about you. Malfoy already loves to remind me all the time that I have no family, and this will only make it worse.
“I won’t take them,” Draco says. “I can’t.”
At that moment I stumbled backwards. Voldemort told me not to be a fool, saying I should join him, so I won’t have to die like you. He said you both died begging for mercy, but I know he was lying. He said he valued my bravery. And that you died trying to protect me. And that I should give him the stone unless I wanted you to have died in vain, mom. But I told him I would never. If you two could stand up to him, then so could I.
Harry doesn’t stop. He knows this. He just needs to get out and away. He needs to be alone in a place that won’t remind him of Draco. So he can cry in peace without having the entire school talk about him again tomorrow.
Hermione lifts her shoulders. “It’s just, you normally are worse than those two.” Hermione nods her head towards Neville and Ron who are both at the table with books and parchment around them.
‘I know you don’t want anyone to know, but my uncle, Professor Lupin, has told his husband about you,’ Harry writes. ‘He’s deaf too and he sent me a list with books that might be helpful for you. Most of them aren’t in this library, but I can ask him to send the books if you want.’
Harry takes Draco’s hand in his. “Don’t give up hope, Draco. Our time will come.” Harry looks up at Draco, his green eyes still filled with hope. Draco can’t take it. Harry should hate him. But the man in front of him loves him. Draco doesn’t understand. After all, Draco has done, after the massive price Harry paid for Draco’s actions. Sirius would still be here, for one. Draco is sure of it. And now Draco is the reason why Harry is going to be childless for the rest of his life. How is it that Harry can just let all that slide and still love him?
What do I do now? Should I tell him in a letter, or wait till I see him again? Oh, and I hope it’s okay that I like a boy. I think you two would be okay with it, but I can’t really know. I’m sure uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia will be horrified by the idea of me being a poof.
Harry looks up from the parchment and sees as Malfoy bites down on his bottom lip and stares past Harry. It’s heart-breaking and Harry again wishes he could just reach out and take Malfoy’s hand in his.
Nott and Crabbe had to say so stupid things before the match, asked me if the new broom came with a parachute, just in case the Dementors come near me. Draco told them to shut their mouth and pulled out his wand. Adrian and Miles also took out their wants and said it would be fun to hex them back into the dungeons. I’ve heard that Nott wanted to try out for the team this year for the seeker position and was that he’s been angry about me getting the spot without any try-outs.
Draco had promised to take me clothing shopping last summer, so I would look amazing all year long, and not only in winter when I could wear the sweater that I’ve now lost. I’m very happy that I’ve gotten a new sweater of Mrs Weasley this year with Christmas. I hadn’t expected it since I don’t hang out with Ron anymore. I’ve sent her a thank you note saying I’m very grateful. I never thought about sending Mr and Mrs Weasley any present. I should have, they took me in during the summer holiday and made me feel at home, even after they found out I was bent.
Draco looks at the sky. It’s a clear day. He nods his head.
Harry holds Draco’s hand at this moment. The sun is out and it’s a beautiful day. It’s their last Hogsmeade trip of the year. Harry and Draco are spending it with just the two of them. It’s their first official date. So they walk together towards the village. They won’t go into the main part of town. Uncle Remus has told Harry about this sweet little park close to his uncles’ home. It will be the perfect spot for a picnic.
Draco looks at Hermione as if she’s crazy. Harry puts his hand on Draco’s arm. “Leave it,” he says while shaking his head. Then he grabs Draco quill. ‘Hermione doesn’t believe in maximum lengths to essays. We’ve tried to explain, but she doesn’t believe it,’ he writes.
‘Your dad is going to be delighted to know you’re not dead,’ Malfoy writes.
Harry brings a piece of sausage to his mouth. He chews on it without tasting it. Hermione leans against him for a second in comfort and then changes the subject. Plans are getting made for the day. Harry doesn’t listen to them. He just focuses on getting some food past his lips. He’s hungry, but on the other hand, he doesn’t want to eat. And all the while people keep staring at him. Is this how it always feels like for Neville? The looks and whispers are a pain, only reminding Harry how one little kiss ruined everything.
A hand grabs Harry’s and when Harry opens his eyes Iris hangs over him. “You’re alive,” she says.
Harry, Ron, Neville and Hermione eat and joke around. Ron complains about his little sister and how she keeps interfering with his life. Harry ignores Lavender’s advances and Hermione is excited about all the subjects she’s taking this year. Before they even know it the meal has come to a close, Dumbledore has given his final warnings and they are off towards Gryffindor tower.
A soft voice came from the side, saying: ‘he won’t wake’. I jumped up and spun around. A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar. He was blurred around the edges and he looked at me with fascinated eyes. I asked him who he was and he told me he was Tom Riddle. I shook my head, that couldn’t be possible. Tom Riddle was the memory trapped inside Draco’s notebook; he could not be a person here in the school.
“Oh, we’re going to Iceland to try and spot a Blibbering Humdinger,” Luna says. “Father is excited. He’s got reports that they have been spotted there for weeks now.”
“I’m sorry, I was just thinking. I should try to forget about Malfoy. It’s never going to happen anyway. No need to upset Ron about it too. He won’t understand, Hermione,” Harry says.
Harry laughs. “You’re not going to get fired now?”
A soft smile forms on Harry’s face and his cheeks start to heat. He hopes Draco doesn’t see the pink that flushes over them when he confirms.
Chapters 15-31 - 2nd year
“The stairs?” Harry asks the room. A young girl points to the left and Harry moves quickly. He only stops when he’s in front of the second door on the left. Is he really doing this? Malfoy is still a git, one that has done horrible things to Harry’s friends. Ron won’t understand, for him, Malfoy will always be that boy that called his girl a Mudblood. But Harry has seen his pain during sixth year, his strength during the war to do what right with a risk to his own life, the dedication to being a better person since the start of this school year. And Harry wants him, more than anything. It’s stupid and crazy, but it’s the trued. So Harry opens the door and steps inside, ready to accept the love offered to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was an accident,” Draco says. He closes his eyes and sees it all happen again. “We both spotted the snitch at the same time. We raced to get there first. But the weather was bad, and we couldn’t stop in time. His broom broke and I reached out to grab him. I almost fell off my broom doing it. I tried to hold on, but my fingers started to slip off my broom. And then he let go of my arm. He fell to make sure I wouldn’t fall with him.” Fresh tears stain Draco’s cheeks. Even awake he can’t keep the sight of Harry plummeting to his death out of his mind.
‘It’s fine. I can talk to Professor Flitwick and see if he can help,’ Malfoy writes.
And now the holiday is almost over, we’ve just got this weekend with New Years and then it’s back to classes and our normal life. No more laying in bed until almost lunchtime, or taking long strolls in the cold snow just to pass the time. Mrs Davis is very proud of me. She said I’m dealing well with all the crazy things that have been thrown my way this year. I still see her like ones a month now, just to make sure I’m still good. I don’t have to do any crazy homework for my therapy anymore, but sometimes I wished that I didn’t need it at all. But I’m scared that will never be the case, with my crazy life.
Harry doesn’t enjoy his Saturday off. He stares at the fire in the hearth of the Gryffindor common room. He needs to figure out a way to find Pettigrew and stop him before it’s too late. Until now, Harry hasn’t come up with any clue on where to start. How do you find a man that can turn into a rat and somehow keeps evading the Dementors that guard Hogwarts and Hogsmeade?
“I’m not dead,” Harry assures her. “Just a little dizzy, that’s all.” And in pain, but Harry won’t say that until Iris has left this room. He will ask Draco to get Madam Pomfrey when the others are gone.
“Draco,” Harry whispers. Draco looks up in his eyes, sees the tears on Harry’s face. He shakes his head and looks back down at his trousers. Harry had said Draco’s concerns about fashionable trousers was idiotic, that Draco looks good no matter what because he’d be pregnant with their baby. Draco shivers and sits down on the little bench. It all doesn’t matter anymore.
Madam Pomfrey says that she will be in her office if they need her and then walks away. When she’s gone, James places another kiss on top of Harry’s head and then lets go of him.
Draco swallows away the lump in his throat. “It will be an honour,” he says. His voice sounds small, but it’s all he can manage. He’s just heard what his death penalty will be. At least it will be quick and painless. Dumbledore is not a man that tortures his enemies.
Harry looks at the ring on his own finger. The same golden ring they found on Draco. Only here the name Draco is engraved next to their wedding date.
“I’m going to cancel the dinner for tonight,” Harry says. He turns towards the hearth. Moments later, Draco hears Ron’s voice.
“But still, I don’t want her to think I’m not happy for them,” Draco says. He can’t help it. He feels guilty for not celebrating with them. No matter how much they understand, it’s wrong and impolite.

Dear mom and dad,
“Cool,” Teddy says as Molly jumps out of her chair to hug Hermione and then Ron.
Harry James Potter.
They both say no so quickly that Harry doesn’t believe them at all. “I hate both of you,” he says before he turns to look at Malfoy. And maybe he shouldn’t have, because the urge to go sits down next to him is back. Harry bites on his bottom lip and closes his eyes briefly.
“Looks like it,” Harry says. He waves his wand to replace the charm that will detect rats. “Or the rats are smart enough to avoid them.”
After that, the Headmaster introduced Professor Lupin and both me and Draco didn’t miss the look of loathing on Professor Snape’s face. I wonder why Snape hates Professor Lupin that much, I know he wants the DADA job, but I’m sure it’s more than just that. Draco thinks they maybe know each other somehow, says they are around the same age, so maybe they went to school together and didn’t get along or something.
Once everyone was seated, Dumbledore gave a short speech welcoming our guest and then the feast started. We had some extra foreign dishes and the Durmstrang students explained to us what they were (at least the once they knew, none of us was tempted to try the France dishes, expect Draco who’d had them on a holiday to France and assured us they were delicious).
Neville puts his arm around Harry and pulls him close. “Tell that to the tears on your cheeks.”
Dear mom and dad,
But the dream was not the thing that scared me. I was scared because my scar hurt. The only other time it had was when Voldemort was close. Draco checked by looking out the window, but he assured me there was no sign of the Dark Lord or any of his followers outside. The little park in front of the house was deserted this late at night. Draco got back into bed and pulled me down with him and hold me until I finally fell back asleep.
Marcus was beside himself when he heard I had gotten a Firebolt for Christmas, but that Professor Snape had confiscated it to make sure it is safe. I think he went to see Professor Snape to explain to him how important it was that I would have the broom back before or next match against Ravenclaw.
Draco looks at her and shakes his head. Harry curses next to him and mutters something about stupid hospital rules.
Harry James Potter.
Neville and Hermione laugh. It’s no secret that if it’s up to Ron, breakfast will never be finished. It will just extend to lunch, and then into dinner until he falls asleep to wake up at the breakfast table.
“Harry is already downstairs with Nathan,” Draco says.
Care of Magical Creatures was, how to call it, I think interesting is the best word. Hagrid has bred Blast-Ended Skrewts. They look like deformed, shell-less lobsters and are horribly pale and slimy-looking. They have no visible heads and legs stick out in very odd places. And the smell is like smelling rotting fish. OH and every now and then, sparks fly out of the end of a skrewt, making it propel forward. We had to feed them that first lesson, which was kind of hard since they didn’t seem to have any mouths. Draco didn’t like them at all, since they could burn, sting and bite all at once. And I had no idea how to make it so that these creatures sounded useful or less scary for him. So I just let him hover behind me while I tried to feed them.
“DA meetings?” Draco asks.
The front door opens, and Teddy jumps up from the floor. “Harry is home,” he yells before he runs into the hallway. Draco startles from the words. He wipes his hand over his eyes in the hope Harry won’t notice he’s been crying again. He will try to comfort Draco, tell him their time will come. But Draco can’t stand it anymore. Harry has no reason to be nice to Draco when it comes to this. It’s Draco’s fault they lost their baby and haven’t been able to conceive again. Draco has done horrible things, worse than most in the war, and now he gets what he deserves. And that will never change.
He’s tried to do it before. Just walk up to Malfoy and just say what’s on his mind. But it’s hard. It isn’t until now that Harry understands why it took Hermione and Ron so long before they could admit to each other that they were in love. Putting yourself out there is more terrifying than taking on Voldemort.
“I love you too, Teddy,” Draco tells him. “I’ll take Teddy-bear tonight. And then I’ll feel better tomorrow, I promise. Now let us get you back into bed.”
“Look, I know he’s sick a lot,” Ron says. “And you guys can tell me. I won’t tell anyone else.”
Harry glances over his shoulder again and smiles at Malfoy when the other looks back at him. This time it’s Malfoy who looks away first and Harry counts it as a win. He will get Malfoy to communicate with him. Harry just needs to irritate him enough.
Harry doesn’t look at her. His eyes are locked with Draco’s. Draco lifts his hands and signs “You okay?” Harry nods his head and then smiles. Then he points towards Draco. Draco first nods but then he shakes his head. He grabs his bag and pulls out his parchment and quill.
“Rose will also get a promotion next year,” Ron continues. “As she will become a big sister.”
He takes a sip of his lemonade. It’s a nice day today. The sun is out and spring is in full swing. Neville and Lily are planting out some seedlings on the other side of the garden. Iris is inside with her head in one of her favourite books. Draco loves books too. He could read all day if it was up to him. He’s probably reading right now, on a ledge somewhere in the castle. Does he ever think about Harry, or about how he was in this house last break, celebrating Christmas with them all? Harry can’t stop thinking about it. Every room has a memory with Draco in it now.
“You looking at her,” the man said. His hand pointed to the bones on the floor and Draco understood. The potion had killed her, leaving nothing but her bones behind.
“Don’t disagree,” James says. “You’ve got a massive crush. You might even love him if you’re anything like me.”
I’ll write again soon.
“And who is that?” James asks Harry. He nods towards the door.
“Pansy, you weren’t there. You didn’t hear him stutter. It was weird. Like he wanted to say something, but couldn’t get the words over his lips. I always knew he was stupid. But this, it triumphs it all.” Draco sits down on the sofa and stares at the fire. Tomorrow is the next tasks, and if the rumours are correct, Potter will have to retrieve something from the great lake. Draco sure hopes the idiot knows how to swim.
“Dad,” Neville starts.
“Harry, please,” Hermione begs. “Don’t go and do something foolish. Just promise me you won’t. I’ll look up spells and jinxes that can help us if we encounter him. But don’t go looking for him. Please?” Tears are building up in Hermione’s eyes and Harry nods his head. He’s got a weak spot for Hermione. He hates seeing her upset. He will promise this. Not that he will keep the promise. He just won’t mention it again when Hermione is nearby. Or around Neville. And that means he also can’t tell Ron. He’s too close to Hermione these days. Ron will tell her. Harry will do this alone. He will find Pettigrew and stop him, without anyone knowing. Even if it is the last thing he does.
“Oh, that’s a Grindylow,” Remus says. “We’ll be talking about them in your next class. You want to take a closer look?”
The bleeding doesn’t stop for another couple of days. Reminding Draco of what he lost every time he moves around and feels the blood tickle from his body. Harry makes the appointment for the check-up scan. They can come in the day before their trip to Greece. All is clear, Draco’s uterus is clean and whole. Healer Burke tells them not to give up that next time all will be better. Draco isn’t so sure about that, and he tells Harry he wants to stop trying for some time. Harry agrees and doesn’t complain when Draco picks up his birth control potion. They visit Teddy and Andromeda in the evening. Teddy tells them all about their trip to the coast and how much fun it was to build a sandcastle together with his grandma. Draco tells him he will miss him and that he looks forward to the week of holiday they have planned with Teddy once they return from Greece. By then Draco hopes to feel a little more like himself again.
Nathan makes it to the sofa and places his small hands just in front of Draco.
Draco wants it to be done. He’d hope that once the Dark Lord would find out the truth, his life would be over quickly. Instead, Draco gets to experience a worse form of torture than the pain caused by the Cruciatus curse. He has to wait and see what happens. And fear that his mother will suffer for his choices. The torture of Narcissa fills his nightmares. It’s a nice mix between watching his mother spasms of pain on his bedroom floor and watching Harry fall into nothing. Draco hates the way he had to wipe the drool off his mothers face when the Dark Lord had enough fun and left them alone. He’d hold her shaking body until she could stand up again.
Harry shakes his head. “Who gives a fuck about Cedric?” Harry says. As soon as the words are out of his mouth he knows he made a mistake. He’s supposed to be crushing on Cho, was so only a couple of weeks ago. She was good on a broom. Harry can’t help he has a soft spot for seekers. But she’s nothing compared to Cedric, or Malfoy. Malfoy knows how to handle his broom, how to make Harry work for his win. It’s a shame there is no Quidditch this year, no excuse to go look at Malfoy showing off his skills.
The best thing is when Malfoy shows up for DADA and motions to Neville that he needs to go find a different spot.
“See for yourself,” Fred says as he levitates the newspaper towards them. Hermione grabs it. Ron looks over her shoulder and then drops his fork.
Harry stops in his tracks and looks at Draco with the most amazing grin on his face. Draco knows Harry had said it was up to Draco when they would start trying again, that he didn’t want to rush him. And Draco loves Harry for being so patient with him. It’s no secret that if it had just been up to Harry, Draco would never have started with the birth control again. But Harry was a good man, and he hadn’t complained about it once.
I’ve been really busy with studying with Hermione. I’m trying to remember the ingredients of complicated potions, learn all the charms and spells by heart and memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. It’s a lot and it helped keep my mind of how miserable I was without Draco around.
Professor Lockhart is still as ignorant as ever. He thinks the danger has passed because Hagrid has been taken away. That the Minister of Magic wouldn’t have taken Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred per cent sure that he was guilty. But I was there when they came to take Hagrid, and the Minister hadn’t thought he done it, but just wanted to save his own face. I really need to calm myself during his lessons. He irritates me so much that I want to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in his stupid face.
I don’t want you to worry, but the last couple of days have been hard. For a couple of hours, I thought of ending my life again. I didn’t and I’m fine now. It was all about this second task. As I told you in my last letter, Draco and I had figured out the clue of the egg with a little help of Myrtle. So Draco, Hermione and I spend hours and hours in the library to research. I even asked professor Snape for a permission slip to search the books of the restricted section. But it was all for nothing. We hadn’t found any spell or charm that would enable me to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
When they were done snapping at each other, Hermione started flicking through the book and then told us that Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone. I had no idea what that mend and I was glad that Ron and Neville also looked confused. She then explained it to us by reading the book. The Sorcerer’s Stone can transform any metal into pure gold and it produces the elixir of life, which will make you immortal. It also said that the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Flamel, who’s already six hundred and sixty-five years old! Can you believe that? Over six hundred years old, that must be weird, all your friends will have long died and you’ll be all alone, or you need to make new friends like every eighty years or so. I don’t think I would like that. It was already hard enough to get the friends I have now, and I also don’t like the idea of losing them. I don’t want to be lonely again.
Ron’s hand waves in front of Harry. “Earth to Harry,” he says.
Harry stands in front of the bed. Draco doesn’t move. His eyes stay unfocused. Harry still isn’t sure if Draco tells the truth about the potions. He hates that he doubts Draco, but he’s unresponsive and doesn’t seem to care at all that Harry slowly breaks down in front of him.
“It’s okay, Ron. We’re glad you invited us over to make sure we didn’t hear from someone else. And I’m looking forward to becoming a godfather again.” Harry turns to look at Draco. He wipes a tear from Draco’s cheek and smiles at Draco. Draco tries to smile back at him, but the corners of his mouth don’t want to rise to form a smile. Ron and Hermione were supposed to be the godparents by now, and Harry and Draco the parents, not the other way around.
In the evenings I hide away in my bed, with the curtains closed. When the other boys come into the dormitory they just say mean things about me, but leave me mostly alone. Zabini once told them to stop making fun of me, but they were mean to him the next day, so he stopped saying anything. Malfoy keeps saying it’s a shame that the great Harry Potter is only a half-blood and that my victory over the dark lord was probably over exaggerated. No way could a small insignificant wizard like I have stopped the greatest wizard of the age.
But back to Sirius and Draco’s mom. They talked for hours once the test were all done. When they both witnessed how connected Draco and I are. I heard Draco’s mom say that they should forget the way they’ve hurt each other in the past and make sure that ‘our boys are taken care of’. I think that was enough for Sirius to open up to her.
“Not when you’re having a party,” Draco tells him. Ron’s lack of manners will never stop to amaze Draco. Right now, he needs a large dose of alcohol so he can erase the image of Ron fucking Hermione on the kitchen counter out of his head.
Draco stares at Harry. Sometimes he’s a mystery to Draco. Even after all this time they’ve spent together, getting to know each other more and more each day. A beautiful, wonderful mystery. But nonetheless a mystery.
And then Christmas day arrived. I woke up to Draco screaming. It’s not the most pleasant way to wake up. Draco was telling Dobby off for scaring him by hovering over them. I muttered that Draco scared me but they both didn’t bother to respond. Dobby was telling Draco he was sorry, that he was only in our room to wish both Draco and me a Merry Christmas and give us our presents. For a moment Dobby was scared that Draco hadn’t meant it when he told Dobby that he could visit us, so Draco hurried to assure Dobby that off course he was and that Draco was happy to see him. I just thought it was quite awkward since Draco and I were both naked under our sheets. This because Christmas Eve was spent. Well, it was different now that we had switched roles, but still so amazing. If it was up to me we would never leave our bed again.
“I prefer to just listen.” Harry turns his head and kisses Draco on the top of his head. Draco sits up straight and places his own hands on the piano.
Andromeda laughs and pats Draco on his shoulder. “He listens more to you than he has ever listened to anyone else. Now don’t be a spoilsport and help me get these treats ready before the rest arrive.”
“It’s tradition. Naming your first child after a constellation.” And Draco loves the name Scorpius. It isn’t only a constellation, but also a creature, just like his own name.
The next room had a huge chessboard and we had to play our way to the other side. And at that moment my anger at Hermione for bringing Ron faded a little because Ron was a very good chess player. We had to take the place of some of the black pieces. I told Ron to tell us what to do. He made me take the place of a bishop and Hermione became a castle. Ron was a knight. He directed us over the board and he took a lot of white pieces. It was kind of scary because the white pieces were merciless and smashed the black piece to the floor leaving them limp and slumped along the wall. In the end, Ron had to let himself get taken so I could checkmate the king. Hermione protested, but Ron was sure it was the only way. So he moved and the queen struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, making him crash to the floor. Hermione screamed but stayed put. I moved three spaces to the left and then the white king took off his crown and threw it at my feet. We had won. All the chessmen parted and bowed and Hermione and I ran through the door and up the next passageway.
Granger and Weasley walk out of the castle. Around the lake. They stop at the tree where they used to do homework with Harry. Granger turns around and takes a couple of steps towards Draco. Draco doesn’t move and waits for the hateful words to come.
“I love you too,” Hermione answers.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers, in the hope Harry can hear him in the afterlife.
“I love you too,” Draco answers. They rest their foreheads against each other. If all goes well, this nightmare will be over soon. And then maybe they can get back to some kind of normal.
“I know,” Harry answers. He doesn’t say anything about the tear that slips from Draco’s eye and slowly travels down his cheek. He just follows it with his eye and wishes he could just kill Voldemort now and be done with this. With the lying and the sneaking around, pretending to be hung up about Ginny dating other boys, pretending to have a crush on her to excuse his behaviour, his need for time alone, away from his friends, just so he can meet up with Draco and snug his face off.
Silent tears fall from Harry’s eyes. Whenever he closes them, he sees the horror in Draco’s eyes. Harry should look him up and tell him he’s sorry. He needs to make sure that Draco knows that Harry won’t ever try anything like that again. And then he needs to beg him to stay Harry’s friend. Harry just wants to still be his friend.
New tears fall from Draco’s eyes and Harry rushes back to the desk. He rests his hands on Draco’s sides and leans in for another kiss. “I love you too,” he tells Draco.
“I know this is the worst time to tell you both, but Ron slipped up when he was at his mother's. And Harry, you know how Molly is. Before tomorrow the entire family will know. And I wanted you to hear it from us.” Hermione rattles on. Draco loves her; he truly does. It just hurts, more than he expected.
But the worst part about the Yule ball was that we had to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas break. And I wanted to go to the dance, the weird sisters were coming and they are really good. But for the first time in my life, I also had a proper home to go to. I had kind of looked forward to celebrating Christmas with Sirius. Sirius wrote that it was fine and that we would just have to make the next summer holiday extra special. But it still felt wrong to stay at Hogwarts now that I have a home and a family that loves me.
Love you,
Harry closes his eyes and tries to stop the tremors in his arms. He wants to hit something again. Fuck, he wants to slam his fist against Draco, just to get a reaction out of the man. But he knows it won’t. It seems like nothing gets through to him anymore.
The next morning Zabini and Malfoy waited for me before they walked to the Great Hall for breakfast. Hermione gave them a friendly smile before she took my arm and escorted me to the Gryffindor table to eat with them. And either Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean, Fred or George walk with me through the hallways. And then at the end of the day, Zabini and Malfoy come to take me back down to the dungeon. And it looks like Malfoy is hardly sleeping at night. He has dark circles underneath his eyes and he starts drifting off in class more every day. I think he stays awake at night just to make sure Nott and Crabbe don’t hurt me again.
Today is the day. No more excuses or delays. Today Harry will step up and do what he’s wanted to do for weeks now. It’s the only way forward. So Harry spins his legs out of his bed and stands up. He takes his glasses and walks towards the shower. He brushes his teeth and pulls on his Auror robes. Today is the day. Today he will not chicken out at the last minute. He will do it.
“That never stopped you before,” Harry jokes. Of course, it has, but only when James feels it should stay secret, not when the Ministry says it should stay a secret.
“You think he’s deaf?” Remus asks.
“I thought you were going to kiss him,” Ron says as he puts down his chessboard. “Now get over here and let me beat you.”
“Maybe,” Harry says. He hopes it will be. “You won’t mind if I fall in love with a Slytherin boy?”
A tear escapes Harry’s eye. “He said he did what he did because of you and Uncle Sirius,” he stutters.
Lily laughs and then urges them all towards the exit. It’s time to go home and be alone for the next two months. Harry can’t believe he does, but for the first time in his life, he agrees with Iris. He can’t wait for the summer to be over so he can see Draco again.
“Will he still show up on the map when he’s a rat?” Neville asks.
Off course we also had to get all the books for our standard subjects like Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells Grade Three. When we got at the Tonks home after our shopping Draco spent the first hour going through the books, looking up things he finds interesting. He’s a nerd from time to time, he just doesn’t like it when I point that out.
And then it happened. A high, cold voice said ‘kill the spare’. The words Avada Kedavra sounded. A green light flashed by me and then Cedric fell to the ground. As he was holding me up I fell with him. I landed on top of his body. I looked into his face and couldn’t believe it. His grey eyes blank and expressionless, his mouth was half-open like he was surprised. He was dead.
The water is refreshing when Harry steps into it. The swim helps clear his mind further. Today is going to be about him and Draco. They are going to enjoy their last day in Greece and not dwell on what has been lost. The numbers are clear. One in ten pregnancies ends in a miscarriage. And most of those couples fall pregnant again soon after. Harry will just have to be a little more patient before his family is allowed to grow. But it will happen, Harry is sure of it. He and Draco would get a beautiful baby one day. And it will be the happiest day in Harry’s life.
“And leave me alone with Hermione and Ron?” Neville asks. “Think about your brother, please. Don’t make me suffer at school alone.” He stops and pulls on Harry’s arm to get him to look at him.
After a week the special eye healer came by again and he said that my eye was improving. I still take potions for it now, but it doesn’t hurt so much anymore. I wear a bandage on it all the time and it looks really stupid with my glasses on top of that.
Harry slides his hands over the keys.
“I almost died and you’re worried about dinner,” Harry says. His voice is croaky.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and smiles at him. “Wrong about being pregnant,” he says with a massive grin on his face.
Ron and Harry both try to hide a laugh that tries to escape them. The idea of Hermione being stuck with Lavender and Parvati is hilarious.
“Albus, I told you this was insane. Malfoy has nothing to do with Potter. I don’t see why he should risk anything for him,” Professor Snape says. Dumbledore answers something, Draco is sure, but his eyes are fixed on Granger. She refuses to look at Draco. Draco is sure she knows why he would be the person that Potter will miss the most. If only Draco would be able to talk to her for a second. Because it can’t be that he likes Draco, can it? That would be insane.
So, it the end of January now, and I have finally figured out the secret of the egg. And all thanks to some help of Cedric and Myrtle. Who wasn’t pleased that I never come to visit her anymore, which I kind of feel bad about, because she had been a good friend to me in my second year. Draco says a good friend doesn’t help you try to commit suicide, but I don’t think he fully understands how lonely I was back then and that if Myrtle hadn’t been there I might have tried even sooner. Which now makes Draco say that would have been better because me almost dying made him realise his love for me was more important than his father's approval. But you know, maybe he should have figured that out without me almost dying, so he has no grounds to complain about my friendship with Myrtle.
“This is me,” Draco says. He needs Harry to know that this is a part of Draco that will never entirely leave him. He’s in pain and wants to hide. Even if he gets help and finds a way to battle his demons. But he will try, he will go to a mind healer and try not to push everyone away.
* * *
There is also another mystery I’m trying to solve, and that is the mystery of Hermione disappearing in thin air. She thinks we didn’t notice that we were all walking to Charms together and that Draco and I were to only once to arrive. We did cheering charms by the way, which is really fun. But the crazy thing is, that Hermione was there one minute and gone the next.
“I’m sorry,” he says.
In the end, I had a great time during the dance, dancing with Draco and enjoying the company of our friends and I was a little sad when it was over and we had to go back to our dormitories and go to sleep. I told Draco I wanted to dance more often with him, that I liked it. Draco said he liked it too just before he drifted off to sleep.
It scares me, dad, that this man might want to kill me. I don’t want to die anymore. I’m happy and I just want to have a fun year at Hogwarts with my friends and boyfriend. And why would this man want to kill me? Draco’s mother had said he used to be your friend. Well if he was a real friend he would never come after me, wouldn’t he? I wish you were here to tell me. I miss you.
Harry draws a breath and then releases it slowly. “The rat traps are stupid,” he says. “They don’t seem to do anything.”
“I’ve got you,” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear. “We’ll get through this, I promise. You are so strong and brave. I love you.”
I knew he was lying about the homework because I’ve been studying with him a lot since Hermione went into ‘oh no, exams are only a few weeks away, we need to stress out and drag everyone around me with me into a study frenzy’ mode. It’s really nice to work with Draco. He’s really smart and I think I might even pass potions with a decent grade now thanks to him. If he starts talking to me again that is. He also got detention, and that is kind of my fault.
“You’re wrong,” Harry whispers. He can’t find his voice. James had warned them that Pettigrew was dangerous. But they didn’t listen. And now, Neville is gone. He would have moved by now if he wasn’t. And it won’t be long and then Harry and Draco will die too. It will all be over. Why did Harry break his promise? He should have listened to his dad. He should have kept them all safe.
On the third day of her visit, she crossed a line. She told Uncle Vernon that it was not his fault that I turned out o be an unsatisfactory person. That if there was something rotten on the inside, there was nothing anyone can do. I had to fight tears when she said that, it reminded me of all the bullying that I had received in my first and the start of second year at Hogwarts. She continued by comparing me to her breeding dogs. She said that if there was something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pup. I got so upset when she said that. I could feel my magic flare through me and Aunt Marge her wineglass exploded in her hands. It didn’t seem to bother her at all, she thought she had just squeezed it too hard. I fled the room after that, afraid I would get another warning from the Ministry about using magic outside of school.
The door to the common room opens and Professor Snape steps into the room. He looks around and motions for Draco to follow him when he spots him. Draco gets up and shakes his head. “I’ll be back later,” he tells Pansy.
Headmaster Dumbledore started to explain why when the doors of the Great Hall banged open. A man walked in and we all watched him take his seat at the staff table. His face was unlike any I’d ever seen. He had scars everywhere, his mouth looked like a diagonal gash and a large chunk of his nose was missing. But it was his eyes that scared me the most. One was small, dark and beady. But the other was large, round and a vivid electric blue. It moved around ceaselessly, without blinking, and rolled up, down and from side to side. He was introduced as our new defence against the dark arts teacher, Professor Moody. I tell more about him later and why I don’t like him one tiny bit.
Harry kneels next to Teddy and whispers something in his ear. They both grin and then Teddy looks back up at Draco. “Uncle Draco, did you bring your broom today?”
Hermione is also going to be in Diagon Alley tomorrow and I’m really looking forward to seeing her again. I’ve missed her. And I hope we will run into Draco, so I can ask him what is going on.
“Your idiotic bumbling son has signed the death warrant of this house, by challenging house Potter.” Michalis answered.
"Tell me, Potter, how is it that Weasley has the perfects badge instead of you, see even I got one." Said Susan Bones.
“Yes, my Lord” Pettigrew meekly answered.
"Well, you remember when I told you the story of how Arthur became our king?" Harry asked.
Headmasters Office, Hogwarts, Scotland
"SIRIUS, YOU HAD BETTER START EXPLAINING…" Harry shouted no longer able to keep his anger in check.
Evening had fallen since the Potter boys visit and Sharptooth hurried through the streets of the Goblin city underneath the bank. After his meeting with the new Lord Potter, he must speak with Grinholt the King of the Goblins.
“Now you see here boy you can’t just go running off whenever you like the old man said…” Vernon spluttered.
As Harry walked into the great hall, he was stopped by professor Flitwick "Hello, Harry Headmaster Dumbledore would like to see you after the welcoming feast."
“Thank you, my Lord, as you are aware, I am Fleur Delacour, I am 17 and have just graduated. This is my younger sister Gabrielle; she is 11 and about to start school. My parents are Jean and Amelle Delacour.” Fleur said quickly, pointing each person out as she introduced them. After she was finished, Alexandria spoke.
Dust the China Cabinets
“Wait just a moment do I get any chance to defend myself? Questioned Harry.
“Very well Mr. Potter, name your defense, and it must be a certified law wizard.” Stated the Minister.
In our land to the four
"As we discussed yesterday the only thing that goes on the first day of a full open session like those that happen in the fall, winter, and spring sessions, is the introductions of new heads of lines. The houses that took on protectorates through the fund you recently established, all had votes added to their counts as they were the votes of the lower court. Not an overall exciting day but the session still had enough to it that I knew it wouldn't take all afternoon but couldn't say exactly how long it would take and said as much."
"You are well aware that declaring war on Britain means declaring war on Albion are you not?" Harry asks focusing once more on Dimitri and ignoring Marvolo. Dumbledore stiffens against his chair feeling a shift in the wards of Hogwarts. His eyes search the room for a threat that wards would react to, to cause a disturbance of this magnitude but can find nothing.
"Mr. Longbottom seems better suited towards my house Alistair." Pomona Sprout chimed in.
"Of the titles given among the wizards only two positions stand at the highest points, the royal houses, and the Ancestral houses. They are both unique and connected, the 18 Royal houses rule the 10 magical Empires and the remaining 8 rule the African Nations and Oceanic Nations as councils, 4 for each Council. The Ancestral Houses are different. There are 36 houses, who have gained the title of ancestral houses. They were the guardians before the kingdoms rose and they chose in many ways the Royal houses. For the 12 Magical Nations, each has in a way 3 houses, some such as Peverell left their homelands and immigrated to other lands before the kingdoms were established. The Ancestral houses bow to no Royal house, and few of the royal houses would dare to challenge them for in times past the Ancestral houses have disposed of the Royal houses. To become an Ancestral house is more than just age; it too requires house magics that few can achieve. For the Peverell's of Egypt, they in many ways founded the branch of magic known as Necromancy or the magic of the dead. As they founded and built the magic, they became masters of that branch of magic. Masters to the point that even if the family gift was blood magic one of the dark magic, and a child was born with a light core (meaning the dark arts would be difficult to perform and impossible to master) the child would still find Blood magic easy to perform and only slightly harder than usual to master."
“Ugh, I do not understand for one moment how either of these two are related to me. If I didn’t know better, I would say your mothers lied about your paternal parent. You two are nothing more than a disgrace to the family. Clean this up heavens knows once I have control of this family again the first thing, I’m doing is casting the two of you out of it.” Sneered the woman. She was dressed finely, and you could quickly tell who she was and who her children and grandchildren were. They all bore distinct similarities in the hair and in the eyes. Most were dressed in finery that did not exactly fit in with their surroundings, nor fit with their own bodies.
Harry taking out the mirror called Sirius. "Pup as nice as it is to see you, I have a little bit of a situation going on right now…"
As they left Gringotts Edward asked, “Are you sure that was wise my lord?”
Tuesday night saw Harry enveloping two scared thirteen year old boys into hugs, and just holding them, letting them draw strength from his magics. Artemis had gasped seeing Marcus, understanding dawning within as to what he was. Harry had only motioned for silence from his house. The boys had finally settled, into Gryffindor and Harry had retired for the night.

“Thank you, Queen Mother, I trust that you will see to Almeria’s shameful actions this morning.” Alomar said before turning back to Harry and Neville. “My apologies, here please join us, at my table.” After both Neville and Harry had been seated, he explained. “There is a one-way, silencing spell of the tables. Once you are seated no-one can overhear your conversation, but as long as you are standing you can hear the conversations of those not seated at a table. I apologize for my sister’s rudeness; she is the first daughter of my father’s main wife Celeste Ramses. Not to speak bad of her, but she has not raised my siblings of her brood very well. They believe themselves entitled, even after my grandmother said you would not be swayed from Albion, she and her children remained very confident that you would eventually bend and bow to the Nile’s will.”
"Perhaps Lucius, you should speak to the minister, of the fact that it seems he has a spy of some sort. Having one of mine win that bidding war could be very beneficial for us, find a way to make it happen Abraxas." Marvolo commanded a smirk splitting his face open, yes things were starting to look better.
5. All said restrictions are required regardless of bound status, this includes lines listed as blood locked. It is the responsibility of the protectorate house to inform said inheritor of the proper rites and procedures of all ranking houses."
With that said the two turned to go along with the knights before Harry stopped once more to speak "If you are truly intent on becoming the next King of Albion perhaps you should stop thinking like a rebel leader using guerilla face tactics and slow down, Consider that if you are to become King of Albion you have close to a hundred million people to think about not the mere seven million people that live in Britain." With that Harry to finished and left the great hall.
“I understand that he is not an ally Marvolo I do, but this can not happen chief among it that it sets the precedence that we will not be able to ever overturn.” Said Abraxas.
"To House Longbottom I give my final offering." Harry once more spoke giving the remaining food on his plate as offering and shocking those behind them. "The House of Longbottom has long honored my own house and for that I give it thanks for standing both beside my brother and for aiding him in his time of need for that I thank thee and give thee honor that the House grows and prospers still in all that it does."
“Good Morning, Master Harry. Its be almost lunchtime, what’s be master Harry wanting to eats.” Said the House Elf.
"With Gringotts taking into account the changes in the worth of a Galleon over the years, as well as the changes in society and other things, interest on some of these contracts are already well above 100%, due to the length of time since they were created.

“You did not cast the spell?” She asked.
“Oh,” Draco said exchanging a look with Neville who shrugged. That was not how agreements with the goblins ended.
Thank you for your business.
Chapter 23 –
Harry read this letter twice as well, Alomar had gone on to tell stories of living in the palace the pains of having to deal with his disgruntled older brothers and the constant manipulations and maneuverings he had to immerse himself into to maintain the position he had. This Harry could understand, slipping the letters into a secure pocket of his close he turned to Neville. "Well how does spending Christmas along the Nile sound Neville?" Harry asked offering the portkey to Neville.
Hermione just gave them disbelieving looks and Harry knew she was going to be in the Library over the next few days as classes didn't start until Monday.
