“I think we should celebrate snake Harry with some pizza!” Sirius grinned up at both father and son. “Bet you mage born and raised people don’t eat pizza a lot.”
It made Ginny a little jealous, because she wanted to be allowed to pull her fingers through Harry’s hair as well. Yet she didn’t feel the need to remain jealous, as it was simply an impulse. Not to mention that the cute Hufflepuff Seeker would probably allow her to play with her hair if they became a couple.
“I just… Can’t…” Hermione muttered through gritted teeth before she managed to stop herself from announcing to the world how much frustration she felt from her inability to cast the charm. “More information might help, I just need to focus more, and to try harder and then I will…”
Harry stared at Neville, as did Professor Slughorn. Then Harry slowly turned towards the Potions Master, and Neville watched him surrender all pretenses of the person he was not. Harry stopped tensing up and instead relaxed, allowing his head to lower and his hands to move in front of him, as if to shield him. Harry turned his green gaze to the side as he deflated slowly. It was as if a different person revealed himself from within the icon which was Potter. All the features were the same, and yet his expression of self and outwards projections was completely different. Even Professor Slughorn recognised that the Harry before him was different from the person who had presented himself to him for half a year.
That evening, Blaise approached the three Slytherin students whom he shared a dorm with as Harry and Draco began to prepare their shared bed like they always did. For a moment, Harry expected Blaise to tell them that they weren’t allowed to sleep in the same bed due to the rule about lewd behaviors, yet that was not what the handsome young man wanted to speak about.
“It is your own achievement, dear.” Draco smiled in return before he attempted to mimic Colin’s gesture. It was a little bizarre to see Draco perform such an action to most people in the room with the exception of Harry, who knew him better than everyone else.
Harry nodded as he trailed after the self assured elf as he walked, leading the three students through the mostly empty castle and towards the trophy room. Harry couldn’t remember ever being inside it, but he knew that he had once been outside of it when he had come to stop Ron from duelling Draco when they were all eleven. It was almost funny to think that that night had been one of the more frightening events in Harry's life at that point, but it now appeared almost pathetically plain in comparison to the rest of his time at Hogwarts.
Her gaze confirmed to Harry that he was definitely under the effects of a truth serum, yet it was also an excuse to be as direct and honest as possible, seeing as she had brought this upon herself.
Honorable people from ancient lineages, true champions for Pureblood superiority, loyal followers and heroes from the past mage war all gathered within her home, filling it with the kind of people who Narcissa should adore, yet whom she did not.
Harry resurfaced from the memories with a deep gulp of air, blinking rapidly as he began to understand the surroundings as the Headmaster’s office in his time, in his present. His head felt slightly heavier than it had the last time that he had looked into the Pevensie, and the feelings connected to the memories felt closer to his own, more personal, more alike his own.
On the other side of the room, separated from Harry by the two duelling wizards, Bellatrix Lestrange attempted to pull Mr. Malfoy with her and force him to either join her in apparition or through the Floo Powder Network. Mr. Malfoy broke free of her grip and instead picked up the body of his son, whom he had hopefully stabilised, as he pulled him aside and away from both the fighting mages as well as Harry.
Harry blinked as he realised that the entire conversation returned to if he was comfortable being the heir of the Black family. With the somewhat prominent understanding that Harry was quickly becoming the heir to a lot of things, he nodded. “I don’t mind. It would be good to have funding for future projects and studies, not to mention that I feel rather humble being trusted with such a thing.” Harry smiled at Sirius, adding ‘heir of the Black family’ to his mental list of what he was the heir of, which also included Potter and Slytherin. An impressive collection for a fifteen year old boy. Even if the latter on the list mostly included a very large snake and a chamber, which, if one thought about it, could be seen as a very big snake terrarium. Harry decided to assume that he did not own all the piping systems at Hogwarts, Slytherin's heir or not.
Harry was surprised to hear the old snake ask him for anything other than pets, but he responded that he would listen to anything she wanted to talk about.
“Dumbledore, you’re making a huge mistake!” A dark voice spoke up over the crowd. “If you die, then the Ministry will have nobody to oppose their targeted violence, and the Dark Lord will rally all the more people to his cause without you as his greatest enemy.”
The hospital absolutely has a Maternity ward. The mage community is so separate from the Muggle world in general that few things would be as confusing and frightening as to be forced into the alienness of a Muggle hospital with their science, machines and drugs, being forced to pretend to be a Muggle at a time as vulnerable as that of giving birth. Not to even mention modern day record keeping in hospitals, and the fact that many mages aren't registered in the Muggle world. Molly Weasley however who is well familiar with and registered in the Muggle world chose the safer Muggle methods and hospitals.
The Dark Lord stood atop the balcony passage of Malfoy Manor, watching over the followers who entered and crowded below him. Some noticed him, others appeared to worship him silently from where they were standing on the floor, but most didn’t even think to raise their tired heads.
Harry was certain that the House Elf was suffering as well, but in his grief, he decided to care for the house when Remus and Harry struggled to assist him like they both wanted to.
“Aren’t you… mad with me?” Arthur whispered, his voice filling the dark kitchen as effectively and fully if it had been an echoing shout.
“We have discussed in depth together, yes.” The former Death Eater removed his fingers from his marked arm. “The reason as to why I was late for the meeting with Professor Dumbledore at your current residence was because I was somewhat surprised by the unannounced visit from a Ministry official the same day. I asked that it be kept from you, as I did not want you to be bothered by the politics of the mage community in addition to what you are already both experiencing.”
Hermione accompanied him to the greenhouse a lot, and the two of them found comfort in each other’s company, even if they did not speak all the time. Neville would work with his plants, and Hermione would continue to study for her OWLs, as she was pretty much the only one in the group who had not given up on completing them that year. Together, they managed, and Neville discovered yet again what he already knew: Hermione was wonderful.
Andromeda sighed, but surrendered to the other’s preference. “If you promise that we will call.” She didn’t intend to make herself sound so scolding, yet she couldn’t quite believe that her cousin wouldn’t attempt to run away once more. A nervous thought forced its way into her mind, one which she could not help but to voice. “Did anyone else escape with you?”
“Where did you go yesterday?” Remus remained hunched down as he spoke to his friend, rather than bothering himself with standing up right away. He had a lingering doubt that Sirius would remain seated on his own, which caused him to stay in case the other would topple over.
“Indeed, we mustn't neglect his duties or someone might be suspicious,” Al nodded, spinning some of his hair between his fingers as he stared into the fire. “Thus, for the moment, Severus, you will investigate the key to the Lestrange vault while Harry and his friends assist Draco. Naturally, I want no Death Eaters in my school without my knowledge. Only if it might save someone’s life shall I consent to such a venture, with good preparation for it as well, but I want it to be avoided if it is possible. Once Severus has completed his venture, we shall gather again and discuss the next step.”
“Then I would think that we do feel the same.” Draco swept Harry’s bangs back and gently kissed his forehead.
“Good morning, my dear students. As this is my first day, I will introduce myself once more: I am Professor Umbridge, former Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, and current Education Inspector here at Hogwarts. Some of you already know me through your work with the Disciplinary Committee. I have been tasked with your education by the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge himself, and I very much intend to deliver. Yet before I begin your education for the day, I need to take attendance.” She raised her clipboard and smiled at them, like a picture perfect photograph which didn’t look real or comfortable outside of that picture.
“Ah, yes… You might be correct about that.” The man agreed. “So you truly are a good friend of Harry Potter’s?”
Rabastan slowly handed Sirius’ body over to the large werewolf, who he mostly recognised from the same facial scars as when the man had been a teenager, whose face was wet with tears as well as he shakily accepted the small body of the man who had been his best friend.
“You don’t think that… he will hate me for this…?” She took a deep breath to steady herself as she dried her eyes with Harry’s tissue.
He steps into my arms and rests his hands upon my lapel instead, gently correcting the Prefect badge upon my chest as he does. “Yes, I agree. Most people are rather foolish. Yet you are not.” I still feel like I am foolish, but El makes me less of a fool, and shares with me his perspective, allowing for me to grow.
“It’s not a problem at all, why would it be?” Harry smiled at her, realising a little too late that his words might come off as somewhat challenging, which had not been his intention.
Andromeda blinked and became aware of the fact that tears were rolling down her face, escaping her eyes as if they had waited years for the opportunity to break free from her body. She blinked again, freeing more of them as she raised her hands in a confused gesture which made it appeared like she was attempting to catch the escaping tears with her hands.
“That sounds good, if we aren’t allowed in the kitchen, then I can’t treat you to anything to drink, I suppose?” Remus smiled again, studying his partner while waiting for his own excited heartbeats to calm down. Just seeing Severus was enough to make his whole day improve.
Most of all it does not have anything on the walls, especially so not newspaper clippings of the Dark Lord. Our Regulus Black was not a person who'd revel in all the supposed evil acts and writings in the newspaper, and not the kind of person to see horrors Voldemort performed written down in the newspaper and be happy enough to want to stare at the articles regularly. Of course, Voldemort's past and actions will differ in our narrative from that of Rowling's, as well.
Mrs. Weasley blinked at the young man, who was about her own height. “He left yesterday night, but he allowed me to stay since there was quite the snowstorm in this part of the country.” When she realised that she had no real reason to be there, she hesitated but then continued in a weak voice. “I was sent here by Arthur to deliver a highly time sensitive report to the Professor. He left right away.” Perhaps she only did so because Remus and Harry were both, technically, members of the Order of the Phoenix as well.
Before Ron could answer, Teddy appeared to have an idea which was so overpowering in his mind that he had to speak it right away. “Hey… Why don’t you talk to your mum about it? She’s still there, you know. Harry is always talking to adults about all his problems, and if he was here, he’d tell you to speak to your mum.”
To Harry, watching Draco sprint off into the safe embrace of his mother’s arms was as much of a magical and foreign concept to him as unicorns or strange magical collar curses. He was aware of the concept, he had come to terms with that it did exist, and he had seen them, but it still felt rather fantastical to him, especially watching both of them respectively break down ever so slightly in the relief of being together again. He knew that he was jealous, he could feel it in him, but simultaneously he was feeling a sort of euphoric high of just watching the two of them, it made him feel good, satisfied and happy; it felt like he was watching something beautiful.
“I’m simply a little tired,” Remus attempted to excuse himself without really knowing why he felt the need to excuse himself whatsoever. He averted his gaze from his lover, forgetting for the moment that Severus had unrestricted access to his mind.
probably didn’t correspond perfectly with the tests either. Thus, they were all worried that they would not be properly prepared for the exams, and therefore fail at an exam which had a large influence on their future possibilities in life, even if it was only half of it until their seventh year NEWTs.
Remus had forgiven Sirius, and Sirius had deliberately broken the leg of a child with his teeth because he was so insane at that point. Peter hadn’t precisely chosen to wound Harry out of cruelty or madness, but because he had no other choice as a servant of the Dark Lord. Even then, he hadn’t so much chosen to serve, as much as every other option had been taken away from him.
“Save it for someone who cares,” Ngo-Kwang lowered her wand. “Now get out of here or I’ll ask that you show your inner left forearm to me. You wouldn’t want to do that, would you?”
The handsome young man halted himself and turned back towards Harry, raising a polite but not displeased eyebrow to question what he wanted.
Severus was referring to Nymphadora Tonks. The woman was an Auror, and someone who enjoyed both attention and the unconventional, judging from her own introductory greeting. She had not been shy to address Severus in humorous but albeit somewhat demeaning manners, with plenty of personal quips and made up titles. As she was his former student, she had a few years to invent names for her former Potions Professor. However, she was never cruel with him, not like James and Sirius had been back in the day.
“Oh!” Ginny responded as she mentally kicked herself harder for not making the connection earlier. “Tell him he has too normal of a first name…” Ginny groaned into her own hand as she felt her face heating with embarrassment.
“Still, now I find out that he might not have hated me at all. When I had just well processed that he his hatred, even if a bit misguided, wasn’t means to make him evil, and I had started pitying him for it, I suddenly get to know that he might have faked it all along.” His fingers tightened ever so slightly around Draco’s side. “I guess I should have seen it. He has sort of saved me, while pretending to hate me, over and over so many times. He jumped between us and Remus turned werewolf, he taught me everything I know about keeping people out of my head, tirelessly trying to force me into mastering it, and he alerted the Phoenix Order to save us from Voldemort, when no one else could help us. Those things and well, a lot of other small things I feel like I should have noticed, the evidence kind of pile up. I wonder how hard it really was to pretend to hate me and everyone that much, when he did so much for us, and so much for the Slytherin house.”
Pat watched as Hermione Granger, the evidently sad Muggle-born girl, more or less ran away from them and into a study room where her friends were likely sitting. Granger was followed by the continuous leering of her boyfriend Vince Crabbe, and his fellow friends.
“Well, if it is only temporary and doesn’t fester…” Remus shrugged with a small smile forming on his lips. “What was it you wanted to tell me? If there was anything. I had the feeling that you wanted to speak to me about something. I could be wrong.” He hurriedly excused himself as he became somewhat uncertain of his own judgement.
Potter as a person was no threat, he was really of no consequence, yet he could be used as a political and social icon to a more effective degree the older he became. Thus, if his reliability and his reputation was ruined at a young age, the icon would shatter with time. No matter what Potter did, there would be some mages who would never forgive, and never forget, the fact that he was but a flawed person.
It is boring, drawn out, but most importantly it has nothing I enjoy, especially not in terms of main characters or what I presume to be the primarily important couple. However, I continue to read out of guilt. The book is evidently beloved, surely I will suddenly come to see what it is about it that was worth all those long nights in front of the wax candle, rather than to read in sunlight like a thinking individual.
“I always saw dating as the kind of thing where the ultimate type of dating is the type where you date your best friend. Where you have fun and can talk about anything, where hugging is natural if you like hugs, and where the whole dynamic isn’t centered around the idea of, to use a Muggle expression, being the boyfriend and the girlfriend.” He placed emphasis on both ‘the’ as he spoke. “So, just being with you, spending time with you and being allowed to hug you and the like, really is enough to make me happy. You don’t have to be making out every second of the day to date, and we can still like one another even if we don’t want to kiss.” Colin’s face lit up, “we can call it ‘friend with cuddle privileges.’”
That night, he had nightmares about the graveyard and the resurrection of the illusive yet frightening icon of a Dark Lord which the name Lord Voldemort inspired. Yet again, he dreamt of being resurrected through pain, regenerating tissue, muscles, skin and flesh. Through organs forming and blood almost boiling inside brand new veins, until he was something humanoid, yet not human.
Harry eagerly awaited his return as he began keeping a journal of everything which happened to and around him so that he could tell it all to him whenever Draco recovered. He recorded conversations, events as well as homework notes. He knew that he was most likely writing for the sake of keeping himself busy with something, yet he accepted the distraction without guilt.
El might not struggle to find friends or acquaintances, but he loves me as much as I love him and we do struggle to only be allowed true privacy when we break the rules after school to be together. Naturally, there are the weekends and the few hours between dinner and bed, but it is not enough. We both want more. We’re only truly happy when we are together.
Ron was a rather muscular teenager with red, short hair which was longer than both Ginny’s and Fred’s, but which lay flat compared to George’s curls. He was somewhat red from sunburn, and a myriad of freckles crowded his bare, muscular arms and legs. He was dressed in a loose grey tank top and rather short shorts which made most people in the room unable to completely look away from his legs. The only one seemingly unaffected was Neville, who was not interested in men. Ron was sitting on his bed, legs spread rather shamelessly as he recounted the information which Harry had shared with them over the past few minutes.
“So you’re protecting the innocent from being thrown into Azkaban?” A young mage raised their hand and asked with a hesitant voice.
Peter smiled weakly at them, but he couldn’t think of anything to say in return. Even a ‘you’re welcome’ would have likely sounded false. The fact that the mage was touching him made him feel frightened and uncomfortable, and he was already focusing greatly on not flinching or reacting with fear to the touch, which was slightly exhausting.
It was alarming for Harry to hear that Draco had seemingly abandoned Quidditch, which was in every sense of the word, one of his passions. Since the first day Harry had met him, he had been talking about the sport and how he wanted to play it and be part of the world of Quidditch. It was almost bizarre to think that Draco would resign as the Quidditch captain, and it made Harry believe that matters might be worse than he had previously dared to think. Parkinson made it appear that he was still on the team, simply no longer the captain. That understanding made Harry able to breathe a little easier, but it did not calm the ache in his heart.
“But how will we know we don’t all go for the same thing at once?” Teddy leaned back against the bed, frowning slightly.
She felt angry at first, a wave of annoyance washed over her. Goyle wasn’t clever, Goyle wasn’t supposed to be able to make choices or think for himself. He was Vince’s loyal shadow, one who should follow even at the smallest command. Out of all the things which Vince had taught her was that there were people who knew their place so well that they would never stray, and Goyle was one of those rare, good, obedient people. Vince was always right, which meant that Goyle was wrong for not being what Vince said he was. It was his fault for not being what he should be.
“Ah, yes, of course. Pardon me.” Draco’s amusement shone through his casual tone of voice, revealing that he did in fact find the joke funny as well, despite normally acting like he was above such silly gestures.
The answer to the conundrum was simple: polyjuice elixir. With the help of Fleur and some trusted friends in France who wouldn’t come to the wedding, Draco was given some hair to become another person. The idea was to pass him off as a distant friend and old mentor from Beauxbatons, seeing as he spoke French fluently enough for Fleur to believe in the idea. However, this meant that Harry wouldn’t be able to spend time with him during the wedding, or he’d give Draco away. Or even worse, the poor witch who they were borrowing the appearance of might be taken for dating below acceptable age. Nobody wanted that misunderstanding. Thus, the solution was the same as to the last conundrum: more polyjuice elixir. As they were only using it once for a single day, it wasn't particularly dangerous or harmful. Harry would be given a potion based on hair from a long dead aunt from Arthur’s side of the family; and so Aunt Prewett and Madam distant-friend-of-Delacour could attend as a couple, allowing Harry his desired proximity to his boyfriend.
Draco retold most of the science in the Room of Requirements, where he quickly gained a collection of interested listeners, including both Hermione and Ginny. The Room appeared mostly the same, but a folding screen had appeared between the door and the room, protecting the students inside from immediate identification should someone manage to glance inside who was not part of their group. The group that day consisted of Harry, Draco, Hermione, Neville, Ron, Teddy, Luna, Colin, and Ginny who was taking a break after her earlier Quidditch training.
Harry didn’t know how he had ended up here, how he had forgotten his dad’s advice. It had seemed like the only option at the time, but that might not even be true. Even if it seemed reasonable, it could prove to be the completely wrong decision. It might prove to not be worth the sacrifice.
“I don’t think we can be together, not officially but…” Draco averted his gaze before he realised that he was still holding on to Harry’s robes and let them go. Harry wished that he hadn’t. “If… we meet in the attic space, then…”
Colin carefully pushed a cold nose against Harry's cheek, breathing in his scent with a sigh. “You smell good. Have I told you that before?”
“I will relay your apology, but they would rather not think of this topic any longer.” Neville shook his head. “After all, this is a wedding, not a political engagement. Thank you for being reasonable.”
“Not the tapestry of magical deeds…” Fudge had found the damage on the mosaic wall which Harry could not care about less for the moment, but which aimed to depicture historically significant moments in the establishment of the British mage community and the Ministry of Magic. Admittedly, like most recordings of deeds, it only displayed beautified renditions of important events, rather than a more accurate version of the true happenings.
In the wake of it all, Severus was possibly only alive because it hurt Albus more that he was locked to the Death Eaters, and bound to serve Lord Voldemort, as he valued his life enough to refrain from disobedience. Had he not been on the Dark Lord's side, he assumed that the man's personal feelings in regards to being replaced would have made Severus the first target.
“Then it makes more sense than not to assume that he might have gotten to it after his school days,” Hermione agreed. “Are you… quite alright, Harry?” She focused on her friend, having seen Harry’s expression prior to the two men beside him.
“It’s because when the system was designed by Purebloods, their goal was to keep most of their money in their own families.” Sirius made a disapproving face before reaching for his coffee cup.
“I’m not going to be able to get out of here for a while, but I’ll do that as soon as I get the chance.” Filch shrugged. “I know sidepaths, I can get there without letting Umbridge or that real troll which is definitely there, know.” The janitor hadn’t believed them in the least with their troll ruse, that much was evident.
The four of them began to head towards their dormitory, passing through the common room to then continue to the familiar room which was their home at Hogwarts.
About a week after Hermione’s return to Hogwarts, Slytherin and Gryffindor had a practice game together, which Harry, Hermione and Luna decided to attend. Harry decided that it was time to give attending a go again, just to prove to himself that nothing bad would happen. Neville was busy with the Herbology club, and Teddy was working on his new invention, which should in theory be able to change the color of any hot drink like tea or coffee. None of them quite understood it, but Teddy wasn’t bothered by their lack of vision.
That left the mystery of who the young woman was, and what her relationship to Narcissa was. Andromeda elected to ask Molly, rather than go find Narcissa herself.
Before Harry could explain, the elf in question appeared around the corner alongside the teenagers. Dobby was sitting upon a pale unicorn which he had produced by the use of his own Patronus Charm. He was barely larger than the neck of the animal, yet he appeared oddly suited upon its back due to the way he had attempted to dress in a gathered, pseudo-aristocratic manner, compared to the red clothing which he had worn yesterday in an attempt to match Albus. As Dobby was short, he struggled to keep up with the rest of the group, which had led him to implement his patronus as a means of getting around easier.
“You have Narcissa, Potter, Mrs. Weasley, most of the teenagers, and fellow teachers at Hogwarts. You do not need to please a woman who sees you as an object. You’re neither lonely nor desperate enough for that to be necessary.” Severus leaned in to carefully place a kiss upon Remus’ head. While his hands were usually cold, his lips were always warm, as if they were heated by a desire to be loved.
The room was dark and desolate. The room gave Harry the impression that there should be some manner of echo within it, yet the only sound which Harry could hear was a slow, ragged breathing. Harry blinked again and again until he realised that there was something before him, something weak, broken and bleeding. He attempted to move but found that he couldn’t.
In reality, there was no knowing what the Death Eater’s plan had really been. There was evidence to suggest that they wouldn’t have attempted to hurt anyone if Draco had simply gone with his father, yet the appearance of the Order of the Phoenix had complicated matters significantly for all groups involved. Bellatrix Lestrange had evidently been willing to kill. If Sirius had not been the one who was hit by the Killing Curse, it could just as likely have been one of the teenagers who had lost their lives.
“It was really intense!” Ron’s eyes gleamed at Harry. “In the end, Ginny was in the lead with four to three Snitches, and then, during the final minutes, Draco managed to catch two of them in rapid succession, raising him to the probable winner. So we have pretty much no time on the clock left whatsoever, and I suddenly see Ginny shoot off out of the corner of my eye, heading straight for the audience stands. The people on there screamed and ducked as she almost drove her broom straight through them. Then she rose up, holding the final tenth Golden Snitch, with only seconds left. It was bloody legendary!”
“I’d like my Potions book that I got from Professor Snape during the winter holidays.” Harry felt a tingle of excitement as he realised that he could actually get his hands on his book once more. “And I think that box of tea which you got from Mrs. Malfoy might be nice to have here. There are still blends which I haven’t had the chance to try yet.”
“Very good,” Albus squeezed Harry’s hand once more. “Lastly, you will be experiencing a set of consecutive memories which I have gathered for you. I cannot bring you out until you have experienced them all but do not be alarmed. Memories flash by so quickly, even if you experience them as longer when you are stuck within them. Are you quite prepared?”
“Of certain I will teach you,” the lad grins and me as he leans his head to the side, smiling happily while he butchers the English language. “Since I am officially not a champion, I will take time, I can to teach you.”
Well at Hogwarts, the group had to separate, with the Gryffindor students leaving for their table, and the Slytherin students finding seats by their table. They wouldn’t remain separate for long, but they all found it rather annoying to have to separate just for the sake of listening to welcoming speeches.
Remus ate another sugar cube against better judgement, just to have something to do and to introduce a physical distraction to combat his mind.
Umbridge was becoming annoyed, yet she was fighting to hide it. “Where does your loyalty lie?” She demanded to know.
“I want to thank you, Albus, for letting me experience that… this… Well, everything. It was interesting to experience a different time and a different setting. It was similar and it felt similar, even if there were noticeable differences in language, surroundings and the few other people but El which I saw. It’s so personal and so intimate and I feel oddly guilty having seen it, but I am thankful. Thank you so much for telling me about him.” Harry knew that he had said it before, and he knew that he was repeating himself. Yet a lifetime of hurt, fear and rejection reflected within his friend’s eyes, and Albus deserves the reassurance which Harry was capable of giving right there and then.
Harry gaped at the elf, studying the small creature in the ill suited and too big clothes as he looked up at him. “Can you cast a patronus?” His voice was eager as he spoke up, and he found himself leaning in somewhat as he asked the elf more questions.
George and Bill liked the same type of music, and Bill had been spending time educating George in a few different Muggle activities since his return to Britain. Sometimes they would attend some event or go visit some building, but a lot of the time, the two of them would just talk. About music, about life, about loss. While it was still rather impossible for either of them to feel as if they were brothers, they were beginning to feel like they could be. With more time, George thought that it might even become easy to remember that Percy was not the eldest brother within the Weasley collective.
I sigh weakly as I aim a half hearted kick towards a piece of frozen ice upon the path. I immediately regret it as my action threatens to send me down upon the path myself. Luckily, I manage to regain my balance and do in fact not fall in front of my first real friend. Perhaps my soon to be best friend, if he doesn’t suddenly take a dislike towards me. It is not as if that has never happened before, leaving me confused over what I did to prompt the isolation from a previous friend.
Thus, Harry breathed in deeply, allowing the memories to bleed into his mind and form themselves within it. Harry closed his eyes and allowed the flood to overtake him, bringing him into a time long since passed.
Sirius looked towards Harry, his tired gaze requesting help, silently pleading for it. Harry, as the elf whisperer he apparently was, decided to help his dogfather communicate.
On the second floor balcony hung the skeleton head of a wyvern. While it was usually bare in all its lack of flesh, it was not bare for the moment. The head had been decorated with all manners of traditional holiday decorations, the red kind of tinsel which Muggles used, alongside a collection of delicate tree ornaments which had been carefully hung on the horns and in the holes of the eyes and the nostrils. There was even a mistletoe which had been placed carefully on the top of the wyvern’s skull.
Harry smiled again. It really was easy to communicate with Draco, it felt like there was nothing they couldn’t talk about, and no problem they couldn’t solve together. He didn’t say that out loud. It felt silly to vocalise, especially since they were only talking about clothes. Not to mention that part of him felt like he didn’t need to say it. It felt so obvious that Harry felt like Draco must already know.
“Please listen to me,” El pleads as he recognises my desire to run away. He raises his hands as if he is attempting to pacify a wild beast.
It was not quite possible for Harry to deny that he found Teddy to become more attractive when he came into himself as a young man. If he had been attracted to people purely based on physical features, he would probably have had at least a small crush on Teddy but as he knew their personalities to not be compatible, Harry only stuck to finding his friend attractive. He really couldn’t imagine being with somebody he didn’t feel more compatible with through a close connection.
“I would be marrying my best friend for a start, so that is already a great head start to what most people do,” Bill smiled. “But since you ask, I’m certain that we can make each other happy. Fleur lost one of their friends a few years back, they understood what I was going through. I was worried about being scared and sad in front of them, but nothing happened. They were kind, understanding and gentle and I realised that there was no problem. I can speak freely, we can discuss freely and I never have to worry about hurting them when I need to be honest or speak. The same applies to them talking to me. I’m not asking them out of desperation, I’m asking them because I love them, and it would make me happy to remain with them for as long as time allows us. If they will have me too, that is.”
Charlie had brought Bill an earring made out of a Wyvern’s tooth, which had prompted Bill to exchange his cheap ankh earring which he had gotten at a market in Egypt, for the gift. Once again to his mother’s displeasure. She also fussed about his tattoo, and any explanation about how useful the clock tattoo was in always showing him the time when he was working underground was overruled by the fact that it was a tattoo nonetheless. Bill grew so tired of arguing with his mother about his appearance that he ended up refusing to speak after a while. He was a little too old to be fussed about like he was a child still, and very much expected his mother to have a few complexes in regard to her children growing up.
“By his name,” Crabbe snorted. “Not that it matters, get to the Headmistress or I’ll take you to her.”
“No, more like Padfoot does.” George could not hold back his smug smirk as he watched his twin’s face twist with confusion.
“Are you hiding Bellatrix somewhere in this manor? Because if you are, Nessie, I swear I will not hesitate to bring my Auror daughter here and have her arrest you both and drag Bella back to Azkaban where she belongs, by her hair if needed.” The words left her so quickly and so angrily that she almost spat them at her sister by the end of the threat.
Peter felt as if he had been punched in the stomach as all the air left him, leaving him breathless and in pain.
The now a father could see the child so vividly in front of him, upon the stand, being faced with the reality that he was in a room with adults who wanted him locked up for the rest of his life in one of the worst prisons in the mage community, simply because of a crime he hadn’t chosen to commit and had no power over. The picture became even clearer to Remus with age, as he had grown to be the father of a son the very same age as the werewolf had been. He didn’t actually know what Greyback had looked like when he was young, but he could still imagine the child and his pain so very distinctly. After all, Remus had lived through that pain as well.
“I needed it too. Also, thanks for earlier, I needed that too.” Bill absentmindedly played with his earring as he looked ahead. “I’ll be sure to tell you what they answer first.”
Some would likely have said that Bill and Fleur were getting married too early. Others would point to the fact that Bill should have allowed himself more time to heal. Some would say that there wasn’t enough time to prepare the wedding clothes, the food and the reception areas. Yet those people were not living at the brink of a war which might make a wedding impossible for the foreseeable future or ever, and they also didn’t have magic to help with the finer details.
It is funny, being a Hufflepuff supposedly means that one is expected to be open and friendly towards everyone. Such a description has never really applied to me. It is not that I am rejecting everyone around me, but I do not strive for, or even feel the need of their company, or their attention for that matter, to feel accomplished.
Harry stared at the House Elf in shock, feeling disgusted to the depth of his core. This was no place for anyone to live, especially not a loyal servant to a family who had more than enough space where he could sleep. “This is unacceptable.” Harry stood up. “We should prepare a room for you. With a real bed. You may keep all your items, but I can’t stand to let you sleep in a cupboard.”
Unbeknownst to Ron, Teddy has recognised Hermione’s feelings to mimic the ones he once had for Blaise. Teddy had been rather firmly and perhaps even slightly cruelly rejected, which made him want to assist Hermione in some ways by preventing Ron from challenging her when her emotions needed to be calmed first.
“Pardon me, si-, Albus, but that is rather an ignorant statement,” Harry gathered his courage and spoke up. “It is true that Tom, I mean, the Dark Lord might not have risen and started a war, but the Pureblood ideals are a little too prominent in the British mage community to simply ignore. They have the most money, and they are the most focused on their heirs and the next generations. It’s rather ignorant to think that there would never have been a war, if only the Dark Lord didn’t rise when he did.”
“Those were some very impressive fangs,” Draco admitted as he played with Harry’s dark locks. “Are you venomous?”
Teddy was coping in much the same way, but he was also spending a lot of time with Blaise, something that Harry felt ever so slightly uncomfortable with. It wasn’t that he distrusted Blaise fully, but somehow, he couldn’t quite relax around him. Having Blaise sit with him and Teddy at every lesson where there were no other students to sit meant that Harry needed to keep up the Harry Potter persona more. It in turn meant that he couldn’t relax the same way that he could relax around Teddy.
“In conclusion, I presume that Draco will desire to join his friends over at the Weasley home for the holidays, but otherwise spend them together with your son.” Narcissa Malfoy finished a comparatively long speech. “Thus, I should call you once more after Draco has returned so that we may plan the travelling in detail. After all, I do want to see my son some during the winter break as well.”
“Hey, King? Can I talk to you for a bit?” Mundungus Fletcher rolled an unlit cigarette between his fingers, almost nervously playing with it as he approached Kingsley Shacklebolt before the man had a chance to apparate away after the meeting. A meeting which Mundungus considered quite disastrous.
In a flurry of limbs, Harry came to stand in front of Draco, beaming at him and about to speak. However, Draco recognised his intentions and placed a gloved hand over Harry’s mouth, silencing him with a weak hush. Harry signalled that he understood, but Draco signed back for him to be completely silent as he let his face go. The son of a werewolf understood and agreed with a thumbs up, a gesture one of the Weasley twins had taught him once upon a long past summer.
It took a few days for Harry to properly recover from the shock of being called Cedric Diggory’s murderer. Those were rather slow but comparatively empty days, during which he was collected to speak to Professor Snape about the incident, but Harry politely declined. He wasn’t quite ready to speak yet, not until he had recovered enough from the incident to find himself able to voice his thoughts.
In his freezing loneliness and displeasure, he came back to blaming Molly for not having warmed the house for him. He understood that he was being ridiculous. He understood that he was being childish, yet he could not help but come back to the feeling that Molly had somewhat failed him, even though she very evidently had not. All he needed to do was to get up and leave for Malfoy Manor, where he would be met by warmth, food, and Molly. Like he should be.
“Yeah, right,” Crabbe was deaf to the plea. “You’re as pathetic as a Muggle.” He took a step forward and reached out as if he planned on picking Potter up and physically throwing him out, thus removing him from Draco’s bed.
Before them, a sea of red and gold opened up, combined with various shades of human skin. Harry had to blink to understand what he was looking at. Every part of the wall appeared to be covered in pictures of either naked people in bikinis, underwear, or in some cases straight up naked. They fought for dominance with the Gryffindor emblem and the Gryffindor colors. It felt to Harry like he had stepped into a cave which may or may not be alive.
When Harry, Neville and Hermione gathered in the Headmaster’s office the next morning after breakfast, none of them had expected to find Professor Slughorn there. The man appeared to radiate stress as he sat in one of the chairs while Al remained behind his desk, evidently distracted by the paperwork in front of him. Before any of the students or the Headmaster could say good morning, Professor Slughorn had stood up and approached the group of students while nervously wringing his hands.
“How very reassuring, being the better man of flirt.” Draco snorted through his nose as he tried to keep his amusement under control.
There was a deep sadness in the old wizard’s blue eyes as he responded in a soft, gentle voice. “Hello, son.” The words appeared to hurt him, and his voice broke slightly on the one syllable in the words.
Harry recalled a similar conversation to this one which Severus had with him when Harry was twelve. He hadn’t been able to understand the man back then, but he felt like he understood him now. “I… see…” Harry couldn’t quite find words for the situation, but he knew that his thoughts would likely communicate to Severus how complicated and conflicting the topic was for Harry.
Arthur had not expected to meet anyone as he passed through the corridor adjacent to the one to the Department of Mysteries, and yet he felt the scent before he spotted the man. Lucius Malfoy came around the corner, behind him hovered a collection of documents in folders, kept afloat by magic. The man’s cane, which had previously been little more than an expensive accessory of choice, appeared to be the sole thing which enabled him to walk in the first place.
Harry could almost smell the loathing from him as he talked about Purebloods and his family relations.
“I don’t… I mean, I do like Hermione, but just as a friend. Lav, we’ve talked about this…” Won-won tried to gently calm her down as his girlfriend became stressed and slightly louder.
“I shall include your complaints in that regard as well.” Professor Snape addressed the young tinkerer in a passive but not entirely emotionless tone of voice.
“It’s fine, I rather like it like this.” Harry shook his head, sending the hair flying all around him. “Oh, uh… I had a ribbon for my hair earlier… Where did that go?” He touched his head and began looking around for it.
“Hagrid could just have the same meat as everyone else in Hogwarts!” Pat objected, although somewhat weaker than before.
He would grow up and become like his father and mother, and he would never be a victim of the world.
Remus sighed as he sat down upon the chair by the desk and began to untie his shoes. The room was lit up by the somewhat yellow lights above their heads, making the space feel warmer than if it had simply been lit up by candles or the fire which was burning in the fireplace. The fireplace wasn’t quite needed for the room to be warm, yet it added some pleasant warmth nonetheless. If the floor had not been so cold, Remus would have sat in front of it and warmed himself up, just because he could, rather than a need to be warm.
Worple smiled apologetically towards Harry, “he cannot smell the werewolf on you. That is not an ability that he has.”
The old wizard breathed out in a sigh, “how very reassuring to know that he has some humanity within him. He has attempted to kill you before, of course, so it means little in the long run, but I feel somewhat calmed to know that he is not irredeemably evil, despite his ever so inhuman appearance.” He was quiet for a moment before he focused on Harry with guilt reflecting within his eyes. “I have one more thing I must confess… In regards to the death of your blood parents.”
Molly Weasley looked up from her crossword puzzle, which she had taken to try and fill yet had not gotten very far with since she began her endeavour to solve it. Nonetheless, it kept her busy, which was probably something the woman needed at the moment.
Harry didn’t want to be frozen either. “My room is on the less sunny side of the building, I will manage.”
“Yep,” Harry nodded. “I have a brooch with golden leaves that I figured we should put in your west pocket. Try those trousers, they should be long enough on you.”
Finally, Harry felt as if he could finally let go of the idea of Colin being something like Draco. Even as he had tried to tell himself otherwise, he had wanted Colin to be the same relationship as Draco, but he wasn’t, and he didn’t need to be.
Professor Slughorn was rather like Augusta Longbottom. He was the kind of man who would love another person but only as long as they performed according to his desires. Yet while his grandmother was rather hard to please, Professor Slughorn only demanded an outstanding performance in one or at the very most two subjects. Neither did he make demands about one’s personality, or honoring one’s mostly brain dead parents.
“Of course,” the woman agreed. “He shall be well taken care of. Yet now I have some errand to attend to in preparation, and I must hang up.”
Severus shook his head, letting his dark hair dance freely around his face as he moved. “It is not rude. Would I be correct in assuming that it has to do with Draco?” The Potions Master neglected to mention his Godson’s surname, since they were alone.
“It’s a present for you, sir! I’m going to get a sandwich. Bye!” With those words, he gracelessly bolted for the door and disappeared alongside the sound of his running footsteps.
Together, the two men shared some of the raspberry pie, which was really very good, and talked about trivial things. The stuttering was taking some time for Peter to get used to, but he found that Quirrell didn’t truly become incomprehensible in the same way when he was beginning to relax. The two of them shared stories in regards to how they had met the Dark Lord, and what they had done to attempt to help their Master to achieve his goals. Peter mostly listened as Quirrell’s story was somewhat more interesting than his own.
“You’re welcome,” Hermione smiled once more before she returned to her desk and Harry returned to Colin upon the sofa.
Colin was handsome as he concentrated on the book before him. He was evidently younger than Harry, and he didn’t appear to face any real consequences of his body’s testosterone in the form of growing stubble as of yet. However, compared to the young kid who had once stalked Harry’s path, the young man who sat before him, with his head resting within his hand and his gaze focused on his course literature had matured remarkably.
It felt strange to know that they were completely alone, and would be left alone if they asked about it. No duties to attend to, no friends to meet up with, nobody to bother them at all. Harry almost felt guilty for feeling so thrilled about just being alone with Draco, especially since they had been so many times before. However, this time felt special. It felt like it was the first time that they had been truly alone since they started dating.
George glanced at Teddy through his fingers, before closing the small window to the world once more as he soundlessly rejected the younger teenager’s words. Yet the silence did not deter Teddy, who simply sat down next to George on the bench where he studied his shoes, saying nothing in return. They sat together as the seconds piled into minutes, and George's tears eventually ceased. Teddy presented a tissue to him, which George reluctantly accepted and blew his nose in.
Sirius felt how his eyes began to tear up as well as the man approached him with outstretched arms; “It’s me, yes.”
The school grounds were eerily dark, as the castle lay silent and utterly without light. Not a single bright spot could be found upon the dark walls, towers or in any window which should otherwise have been lit up. He wondered if Hogwarts had ever been completely dark since the days when it was built.
Neville’s opinion was shared by most other students who took Divination classes, although not by everyone. Some were rather upset that Professor Trelawney had been removed from her post and ridiculed as a false Seer. Some people were disapproving of a horse as a teacher, and some had allergies which complicated their ability to be around the centaur for longer times. Yet overall, Firenze wasn’t disliked by the students.
A hint of pain and regret passed over the former Death Eater’s face, as he averted his eyes from the two teenagers. Professor Snape was silent for a long time before he answered. “I acknowledge that your question is relevant, but I am not willing to share the reason as to why. Most Death Eaters believe it is because I provided support for the cause through the means of magical healing and certain potions, but the reason is more complex than that. However, I’ve already said more than I am comfortable with.”
It should be natural and it should feel good to finally be a Sirius. It was his right after all, his right and his turn to be superior and great, and for somebody to grovel for him in return.
“Draco… Oh no, Draco…” Ron mumbled in his sleep, this time loud enough for everyone to hear his weak plea.
Professor Slughorn finally gave in to speak of what was evidently haunting him enough to need to confide in someone. “Oh! Oh well,” he grumbled, “the truth is that Harry reminds me of somebody who fooled me once upon a time. A most brilliant student who tricked me into revealing certain secrets and magical rituals and spells which he had no business knowing. Harry is acting like a copy of that student, down to his short, curly hair, his green eyes, mannerisms and speech. It is beyond uncanny and I know that the boy is doing something to try and get something from me. I don’t know what it is, but it most definitely has something to do with something which he shouldn’t know of in the first place. I refuse to be alone with him because I know that the boy is attempting to use my gathered knowledge for his own, nefarious scheme! Why, if I’m not careful then I might be to blame for yet another unkillable Dark Lord!”
“If one wanted to protect such an object, how would you theoretically think that one would go about it? I’m thinking that an excessive protection charm would make it evident that there was something special about the object, which should ideally be protected without notice, but leaving a horcrux without anything appears foolish. Not to mention reckless. Do you have any suggestions, Professor?”
Harry hesitated to continue speaking, but he managed to gather enough courage to vocalise his fears. “I think… I’m experiencing what it is like to be resurrected through such a ritual as the one I witnessed. I’m not just imagining what it could be like, it’s too… real. Far too real. My dreams have never been very detailed, and even when they have some details I do recall, I can’t remember them with this clarity. Especially not physically.”
Teddy sighed as he dropped his work and walked over to his friends where he sat down upon the armrest of the sofa. “I guess I have to talk too… Despite not really liking it, I guess I should.”
“This group will be referred to as the Disciplinary Committee, and will also have the right to report unsatisfactory student behavior, so that the Head of their House may be informed of the students’ lacking manners, and have the behavior corrected. If you wish to sign up, bring a personal letter to my office before the weekend, and you will be accepted or rejected. The students who made it onto the Disciplinary Committee will be informed on Monday.”
The outfit almost matched the grace, volume and impressive detail of an elaborate ball gown, something which traditionally masculine Muggle fashion never quite managed to make up for. It had a corseted top in a single piece, paneled and decorated in layers of lace and silver decorations matching his partner. The bell sleeves were far larger than Fleur’s and layered to have more than one fabric, decorated with pearls and gems. It fit him comfortably, and hadn’t been too tightly tied given his injuries. He wore decorated white trousers as well, with lace down along the outer sides of his legs. Then the part he was the most excited about was the layered lace trail skirts big enough to rival a large ball gown, which was still open in the front and thus giving him free movement. It was further enhanced to move out of the way to not have him stumble over the fabrics.
It might be naïve to think that everything would have been alright if Al and El had simply communicated with one another, but at the very least that would have given a chance for change in both of their favour, rather than the gamble of that the world would work out for the better so they could be reunited.
They were all being helped by their fellow sympathisers, people with blankets or better clothes, people with food or with kind words to speak. The Dark Lord noted calmly but with nonetheless interest that the entrance hall was becoming a shelter, much like the ones he had personally seen after the second World War. Nobody really talked, nobody raised their voice, but the room was filled with quiet chatter and frightened murmurs, as well as whispers and the sound of crying as families were reunited or someone was told that their family member, partner or even child had not made it out like they had.
The separate groups of friends finished eating on their own before reassembling outside, gathering in their heterogeneous House group. They could have had a long conversation about what locking the Houses to their tables meant for them, the school and the students, yet they were far too tired after their long day of travelling and resolved to talk about it later in the Room of Requirements. Luna was very silent during the short discussion, and when she left, she did not head towards the Ravenclaw common room, but towards the Room instead. Harry noticed, yet he did not want to point it out as it appeared that Luna wanted some space of her own. He decided to speak with her later, thus making sure that she was alright.
With his head spinning slightly with anticipation and his heart beating too fast in his chest, Harry approached the Pevensie. He took a deep breath, then leaned forward, allowing himself to breathe in the memories. Akin to last time, the memories reached out for him, and gently entered his mind, wanting to be known as much as Albus wanted someone, anyone, to know the truth which he had previously kept hidden.
“You’re having a panic attack,” Remus whispered to him as he held him without squeezing him. “It’s okay. It will pass if you let it.”
Mungunus sneered, pretending as he always did that his kleptomania wasn’t the biggest, most uncomfortable problem of his damned life, and instead just a silly little quirk that he was perpetuating willingly. “Dumbledore will pick you as part of the operation as he knows how capable you are. I’m not so sure I will be picked, but you will have a good chance to convince everyone that the right thing to do is not assisted suicide, but to save him. Once again, I’m not trying to betray Dumbledore or anything, I’m just doing what I think is right. Saying what needs to be said.”
“I am going to adhere to your wants, but I do think Ron deserves to know about what happened. I think he would likely be happier knowing the truth rather than having his eyes clouded for an extended period of time.” Neville admitted as he once more focused on the ground before him.
Harry noticed with some aversion that Winkie was the House Elf who had served the Crouch family a few years back. She was also the one who had watched over Bartemius Crouch Junior, the young Death Eater who had been forced to serve his very own father through the implementation of the Imperius Curse. Winkie had expressed disgust in regards to Dobby for him wanting to be a free elf, rather than a House Elf. She appeared happy when she obeyed Slughorn's order, but Harry and Hermione both found the display of submissiveness to be highly uncomfortable. Not because they were uncomfortable with Winkie, but because she shouldn’t have to be a submissive slave. The fact that Professor Slughorn was using a House Elf in the very first place was uncomfortable to the both of them. It was to Neville and Ginny as well, but Ginny wasn’t focusing on the House Elf, but instead speaking to the person next to her.
“Or perhaps you need to do the opposite of what you are doing,” Luna spoke up in her soft voice, interrupting Hermione as she spoke.
Pat felt her body flinch as the other woman realised what she had been unable to phrase even within her own head. She curled together a bit more, her gaze focused on the ground before her but she wasn’t seeing the pale tiles. She wasn’t really seeing anything. “...You know that he is immortal, don’t you?”
“I was mistaken for Harry’s father earlier today.” Severus changed the topic slightly as he continued to lean into Remus’ touch. “Your son found it quite so funny. I was surprised to learn that he thinks of me somewhat like a father figure as well. I was such a horribly unfair person upon meeting him when he began his studies at Hogwarts, a person who refused to see past his appearance despite knowing better. How… strange that a child could forgive something like that so surprisingly easily.”
“You’re not going to beat me?” Tom asks as he studies me with hope and fear mixing together upon his face.
“That’s fine.” Chang nodded her head. “I don’t need gentleness, I need answers. No, I need the truth. I need to know the truth.” She enforced her second point once again, speaking more to herself than to Harry.
Teddy asked if Harry found him annoying, to which Harry responded that he hadn’t found him annoying since they were around thirteen, and not even that much even then. Sometimes Harry needed breaks from high energy activities and talking, both of which were things Teddy enjoyed and occupied himself with, so even if he would need a break now and then, he really liked the other's company, and trusted him. Teddy was highly satisfied with that answer.
The mind reader smiled another joyless smile as he walked around his desk to sit down in his chair. As he sat, the soft creak of leather woke both boyfriends from their confused feelings.
“It’s time that the Ministry discovered that a bunch of children are trying to break into their guarded Department of Mysteries!” Bellatrix announced proudly. “Our Master sent a projected image of that werewolf brat’s dad being hurt at that place. Those stupid kids are probably trying to break down the door with violence as we speak, unless they have already been caught. Nobody will ever listen to Harry Potter ever again after he and his little friends have been branded as criminals.”
I feel faint. I want to pass out as the heat and the fear are getting to me. I clutch my necklace tightly as I wish that it would all go away, and I could go back to being the little unknown Hufflepuff boy at Hogwarts who met and fell in love with El.
“Uhm….” Arthur began, uncertain if he should speak to the man or if that would make the other uncomfortable. “If you need anything, just tell me.”
“You can’t say that, they are in love, show some respect!” Hermione turned towards both of them, looking appalled over her fellow Gryffindor students’ reaction to the two boyfriends.
Harry and Draco stared after him, both equally surprised over the way the elf had suddenly left them.
“I’m new money? How am I… Oh. Yes. Heir to the Black fortune. I forgot.” Harry gave himself a light mental kick for forgetting what Sirius had given him. Not that he had needed the money, but it offered up wonderful opportunities for further studies, and other things. If there was a future for him. Harry shook those thoughts away. “Well,” he decidedly changed topics. “If it was a book, then you would most definitely be the main character. That’s main character predicament right there.”
“Don’t care. Food is food. Give here.” He held out his hand, prompting Pettigrew to instantly give him the remains of what he had gathered from the floor.
Fleur nodded and then raised their voice. “We’d pay in the Malfoys’ blood and only gain a few months at absolute most.”
Molly Weasley could never, even in her wildest dreams, have imagined herself in Malfoy Manor, drinking tea with Narcissa Malfoy, Severus Snape, and Remus Lupin. The notorious mass murderer and most devoted servant of the Dark Lord, Sirius Black, had been there, but he had left some time ago and not returned. Only his name was actually Potter, and he appeared to be a rather attractive person, despite his lack of manners.
“Uh…” Colin glanced between Mystical Items and Mystical Books. He decided that books were the least threatening of the two and gave the handle a thug. “Locked.” He commented.
Harry allowed his mind to speak for him as he stared into his unappealing reflection in the dark cup.
“Hi!” George sounded almost breathless as he came up to Percy, his eyes conveying both joy and worry as he appeared to consider if he should or should not hug, or even touch, his older brother.
Harry and Colin were on the other side of the Gryffindor table, and they couldn’t reach the others without either jumping over the table, going under it, or around it. It was a far better idea to make it to the other side of the hall and simply wait for their friends to come out.
Harry and Draco exchanged glances, both of them didn’t quite know what it meant to be too human, but through the description, it became rather easy to understand why the rejection had occurred. Yet Dobby understood, not through sympathy, but through his own experiences. He understood well what it meant to be too human when you were not supposed to be, and the rejection enforced by one’s species if unwritten rules were not properly adhered to.
Hermione nodded twice. “Yes, I will write that. Remind me to ask if Neville wants me to relay a message when I meet him tomorrow.”
Late in the development of aristocratic feudal societies we believe that some of the ancient Pureblood families were aristocratic mages who served similar roles, and might even have protected the very vulnerable mages of the time.
The reason for his grin was that Draco returned, evidently not wearing any trousers, and acting as if it was the most natural thing in the world, despite Harry suspecting it being a rather embarrassing deal for the ex Pure-Blood fanatic, and Malfoy heir. He made a brief note that the other had rather appealing legs.
Pat felt little explosions of joy and happiness burst within her chest, as a smile formed upon her lips. She quickly looked away from Chang as her face became red once more. She heard someone giggle, and realised with a startle that it was herself.
Harry found his relationship to Kreacher to be a rather complex one, at least on the House Elf’s part. Apparently, Harry looked quite a lot like Regulus Black, Sirius’ brother and Kreacher’s favorite person. Harry had seen pictures of Regulus, but he didn’t find them to look that much alike. Harry wasn’t even convinced that they had the same tone of skin, but it was hard to tell with the paintings. He could see that he shared some similarities with the young man in the paintings, namely their curly hair, dark lashes, and green eyes, although Regulus’ might not have been as bright as Harry’s.
The Dark Lord sighed and retracted his hand, which had carefully approached the snake as he attempted to reason with her. “As you can see, she is not quite fond of this version of me.”
Whenever Neville was in school or in class, breathing in the heavy scent of dust, ink and the scents which came from other people, he felt as if his lungs were slowly filling with heavy tar. Yet in the greenhouse, he could breathe. The plants didn’t care about him, he was as emotionally significant to them as the castle itself was to the students of Hogwarts, and yet he was vitally important for their survival. It did not matter if a plant lived or died, it did not matter if it was on the brink of withering or blooming proudly, it would never care about him. Never care if he let it down. In return, nobody would be emotionally invested in the death of a plant, which made the entire act of caring for them so much less stressful.
“Then you could not claim that you were given this talent of yours by means of, well, blood?” Professor Slughorn leaned forward slightly, looking curious to Neville’s response.
Harry licked his lips, he did understand Draco’s argument, and he did agree with him. Perhaps more than he had expected to. “I have gotten some new clothes this summer. I’m no longer on bare minimum.”
Harry carefully placed Dobby down as he blinked at the centaur, struggling to place the centaur in his memory.
If Draco and Teddy hadn’t recognised the rage which was building in Harry and grabbed him from both sides, helping him to refrain from throwing their entire cauldron at the witch, Harry would likely have done something highly foolish and very stupid.
“You begged me not to tell him, and then you begged him not to hurt you, I don’t think that is something that should be ignored.” Chang didn’t listen to her objection, her voice was steady and secure, speaking truths which it was certain of. “You’re afraid of him.”
“Why are you so uncomfortable with Harry, sir?” Neville asked. “To my knowledge, and I know him well, he had never wanted to hurt anyone or given anyone creditable reason to fear him. I cannot fathom what it is about him that would unsettle you.”
“If… If that is true,” I respond in a far less smooth fashion. “Then yours are the sky upon which my stars should sit. I have… equally admired your eyes since I first saw them.”
“I haven’t read the book it’s based on, but since Indigo Montoya is bleeding to death, Weastley is borderline paralyzed, Fezzik is too big for the horse and Buttercup isn’t particularly good at anything, I don’t expect them to survive for long until they’re hunted down, so it’s kind of funny that the movie might not have a happy ending. It just feels a little more clever, since you don’t know this but mostly all movies like these have happy endings, and it’s getting a little overused.” He glanced down at the other, who was still leaning on him, grin fading into a more neutral smile. Well, maybe he liked the more realistic ending too, because he had learnt to be very sceptical about happy endings, based on personal experience.
It brought Sirius great pleasure to confirm that the household was still diverse, even after the mages had left it. Being in the household had always been a relief back in the day because it was the exact opposite of the Black household. It wasn't about the diversity as much as the fact that it was allowed, and that it acknowledged that people were just people, and all the same if they could get along with one another. It was also relieving to learn that Benny had built a family even after losing Euphemia, James and Sirius. It meant that he had found his own happiness rather than chase what had been lost, which was probably the healthiest thing to do in the very unique and almost bizarre situation which Benny had found himself in. Unlike his son, who struggled to live in the present to begin with.
Harry glanced towards Teddy, as the two of them already knew about Ron and his possible girlfriend from Blaise's somewhat careless comment. He was worried that Teddy would feel even more distant to Ron, but to his surprise, Teddy appeared almost relieved to learn the truth, rather than simply suspect.
Professor Slughorn handed the vial to Harry with a weak smile. “When I first saw you, I considered you to be a reflection of your mother, Lily Evans. I’m rather confused with myself as to when I was only capable of seeing the young Dark Lord himself…” He trailed off as he forced his fingers to let go of the vial. The old wizard laughed weakly as he brushed his hands off upon his vest. “Albus was wrong, doing the right thing is not so much freeing as it is terrifying. You’re both still members of my club, by the by, but I do expect you to keep up with the gifts and your work, and not simply stop because you gained what you wanted.”
“Ha!” The woman scoffed in response. “Your father couldn’t possibly be at the Ministry, and even less in that department. You had a dream, Harry, and you are overreacting. The Ministry may be mostly empty this late on a Sunday, but there is simply no conceivable manner in which someone would drag a werewolf in there and then leave him to die at the Department of Mysteries as you claim.”
“Why not? They did to me when I was a brat.” Greyback sat up, quick as the beast he was, and captured Pettigrew around the waist, yanking him down into the sofa and holding him stuck. He evidently enjoyed frightening the man and had made it a personal game of how far he could frighten the other before the animagus turned into a rat and ran away. “I like it when you squirm.” He more or less growled into the frightened servant's ear as Pettigrew became very still within his grip.
The basilisk was slowly approaching, judging by the sounds of her body. She was old, and her body did no longer allow her to move like it once had. Thus, the teenagers met up with her in the middle of the Chambers of Secrets, their eyes shielded with one hand as they focused on the large shadow on the wall.
Narcissa liked to think that she was a woman of principles, and of strict discipline. She had raised Draco to be like her, and taught him that all he knew was right and correct, unless otherwise proven by an authority figure.
In the muted dark of the Burrow, Harry covered his face with his arms as he began to worry that Severus was getting fired from Hogwarts. The man had been a comfort for so many years, especially as the Head of the Slytherin House. Severus had done so much for him, and Harry hated the parts of his mind which blamed himself for the man’s expulsion from Hogwarts simply because Harry encouraged Slughorn. He tried to tell himself that Severus was likely to take over the position of Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, but Harry worried that if Severus was considered unsuitable as a Potions teacher due to his past, then surely he had to be even less suitable to teach Defense against the Dark Arts in most people’s eyes.
The card had later ended up with Harry, who had made it a centerpiece of his wall decorations in his room at the grim old place where he lived. Meaning that it was the only thing he had put on the wall so far.
At last, Mrs. Malfoy seemed to give in, and was clearly agreeing to his proposal, especially so if she was willing to communicate with the Weasleys on her own; Harry had been fully prepared to have to act as some sort of messenger.
It had been nearly three months since Sirius’ burial and one month since Draco’s letter. Neither Lupin had been able to contact their respective friends at Malfoy Manor. Harry’s birthday had come and gone, making him a year older even if he didn’t actually feel any different.
If he only could force himself to think fully of someone else, Harry could make the hurt inside him go away, at the very least momentarily.
I don’t tell Tom everything, as I am not very accomplished in stories which involve me describing what I felt or what happened emotionally, but I attempt to tell him the facts about El. I tell him of my friend and my later lover, I tell him of the politician, and I tell him of the day El left for America, but in very few details. I tell him that El helped me discover that I am not useless at magic, that he showed me a literature genre that I consider my favorite, and that he supported me to become a Professor, as well as guided me towards how to speak rhetorically and with good articulation. I speak of all the bits and pieces of El which formed me, and which made me into the wizard I am today.
“I’m not that worried about it, I was simply worried that I might have forgotten it. Or, uhm, been forgotten.” Harry confessed with a shrug, thinking to himself that he should probably start to read the Potions book which he got from Professor Snape last year in preparations for the OWLs.
Harry forced his expression to twist into a smile as he leaned his head to the side, nodding slightly. “How did you know, sir?” He pretended to be surprised yet impressed and he dearly hoped that it wasn’t visible that he had not the faintest idea of what the other was speaking of.
“It is not something Albus asked of us, as much as something I asked of him.” Harry lightly touched his chest as he spoke. “We know that he has attempted to acquire some kind of memory from you in relation to Tom Riddle and horcruxes. A memory which maybe could make it possible to know more about what items he might have used for them, and how many there might be in total. While he clearly does not know of it in great detail, your words and actions have made it clear that you know something, and that there has to be something. I asked to let him allow me to retrieve it from you, with your consent.”
“I’m afraid I’m not a man who is well versed in explaining matters which are not based on logic and facts. I understand that you have questions, and I intended to answer them. That being said, is it possible for us to do that at Hogwarts? There, I have the means to show you, rather than tell,” Albus continued as he regained control of his voice.
“Three!” the two and the crowd yelled as they pulled away from the other, breaking the shackles of their past.
“Then we will start after breakfast. Did you like your eggs sunny side up or… other ways?” Harry forgot the other ways in which one could make eggs.
Umbridge opened her mouth to object one again, but as she met Harry’s gaze, she found that no arguments of hers could convince Harry of anything else. Slowly, she shut her mouth, her face settling into a dangerously determined mask of acceptance, which was already cracking at the seams. Whatever she had decided on, Harry was sure he wouldn’t enjoy it, but he didn’t allow that to affect him.
“The war continued with far more brutal methods from both sides, until Grindelwald was finally defeated by Albus Dumbledore in 1945, and the American Mage War ended with scattered supporters for him, and a, according to the history books, stronger America and American mage community.” It hit Harry as he finished speaking that Albus didn’t quite appear like a person who could defeat his lover in a duel, especially after all that he thought and felt about refusing to fight him. He also thought that he recalled Severus having pointed out that the whole duel was a lie, back when they talked about the American mage war.
George knew the name of the Marauders by heart: Moony, Padfoot, Prongs or Wormtail. One out of four. 25 percent chance. He wanted to impress the other by guessing right the first time, thus, George began to think.
“Oh, then you do know about it.” Draco absently stroked his own chin, tapping his own lips in a graceful but distinctively unrefined manner. “Well, her research comes down to the single idea that Muggle-borns are less inclined to understand magic academia and cites this to be because of their heritage. It utterly fails to consider the fact that most of us have been schooled in magic from a young age, and Muggle-born students likely learned about magic at the age of eleven.”
Sirius Potter had begun to change. Although he had never had planned on changing, the letter which he had received from his dead brother had forced a change within him, as the tide of realisation could not be stopped.
“We’ll inform the Headmaster.” Draco assured the Gamekeeper as he put the leash which had been hanging by the door into Fang’s collar. The dog didn’t quite look impressed with the leash, but he didn’t fight against it, nor did he object when Draco carefully pulled him along towards the door.
Bellatrix Lestrange laughed loudly as she yanked Draco up from the floor, sending his cane clattering as she pointed her crooked wand against his neck, seemingly ready to stab into him with the blunt object if he resisted. More Death Eaters appeared behind her from the fire, bleeding into the room as if they were darkness more deep than that of the naturally dark attic space.
About forty minutes passed as Harry worked on his essay, writing in a focused manner which stopped every now and then as he counted the words, then continued to write. He finished his work, then waited for the ink to dry before gathering his bag and the parchment upon which he had written. He folded it over and placed it upon the floral tablecloth.
Remus groaned before he hid his face in his hands, wishing that his life was easier than it currently was.
Neville loved the greenhouse which simply let him exist, and where people were left alone with their thoughts. He greatly enjoyed being lost in the acts of caring, cleaning, observing, clipping, watering and replanting, as well as wielding his internal magic to heal various damages on the plants. Anything to keep his hands busy, his head focused on a task, and his nose filled with the scent which to him signified calm and silence.
Harry raised his hand and pushed his hair away from his forehead, deciding once and for all that if people ascribed meaning to a scar on his face, that was their problem and not his.
Harry carefully accepted the small box and hesitantly opened it, unable to keep from holding his breath with anticipation. Inside the box, upon a bed of red velvet, lay a golden ring. It was shaped like a snake, with a head and a tail meeting on the front of the ring, creating a shape, rather than just a circle. Harry thought the ring was beautiful, but it also didn’t appear detailed or expensive enough to be something he would expect a Malfoy to own. Not to mention, the ring was golden, not silvery, which also distinguished it from the general palette of the Malfoy family.
“Thank you,” Neville nodded and smiled once more before he returned to his own seat next to Victor. On the way there, he locked eyes with Harry and smiled, confirming to Harry that he truly had known that it was them all along.
“Of course not,” Neville laughed without his usual joy, yet he was nonetheless honest. “That would be beyond unreasonable.”
Harry licked his lips, frowning to himself as he turned her words over. To him, it appeared that Secrets had gone blind, possibly from age, but he didn’t know enough about snakes to know if they could go blind with age.
“Bold question,” Sirius' expression reflected fascination in response to the question. He evidently liked the lack of carefulness which George had accidentally displayed. “He didn’t bite me, it’s that simple, really.”
With those words, he was gone. He ran back to his new room and slammed the door behind him as the last words still echoed in his absence. Before the door closed, Harry noticed that Sirius’ face had been redder than he had ever seen it before, and there might have been tears in his eyes.
“We’ll avoid that floor, dad.” Harry assured him. “Have you seen any terrariums around, by the way?”
“Horace,” the illusion of the Greatest Wizard of the century spoke to him, smiling as he did. “You did the right thing… I knew that you would. Thank you.”
Rowena Ravenclaw’s circlet was by all means beautiful. It was a hard metal circle, rather wide, and very straightforward in its design by having shapes in the crown depicting elegant birds dented in the material, shapes which were probably ravens. There were a few blue gems with a soft surface upon the front of the piece, their natural and raw appearance testifying of their ancient age. There was writing along the bottom of it as well, but Harry did not quite recognise the letters or words at all, and thus it was anybody’s guess what language of all the ones past or present spoken in the country it could be, beside modern English. The piece appeared so very old that it was possible that Rowena Ravenclaw had inherited it, and perhaps even based her House symbol and color around the artifact.
Soon enough, he found himself seated in the armchair which had previously been in Severus' other office, curled together with a slightly too warm cup of tea. Harry took in the view of the office which had yet again changed with its new inhabitant as Severus sat down by his desk with a cup of his own.
“Oh, but you see, this isn’t what they think it is,” continued Mr. Lovegood “This is the actual original mark of the Deathly Hallows! Not Grindelwald’s mark. It was never his, he simply stole it. I’m not supporting that terrorist, simply enjoying the legend of the Deathly Hallows, you see. They all represent parts of the story, see, the elder wand here and-...”
Although Goyle’s comment made Harry wonder why he hadn’t been chosen for the Committee, seeing as Umbridge evidently didn’t pick the members based on their grades. Part of him was convinced that it was because Harry had applied with his real name, rather than her desired name. However, as Harry no longer wanted to be part of the Education Inspector’s private club, he was rather relieved that he had been rejected. After her expressed opinions about Muggle-borns and their supposed academic failures, Harry wanted nothing to do with Umbridge academic opinions.
“Oh thank you…” Remus breathed out a heavy sigh of relief as he stood up from his chair and quickly left the room.
Harry tried to move himself forward, but nothing really happened. Instead, he raised his head and body up, trying to use that momentum to move, but that hadn’t worked yet and didn’t quite work today either.
They drank in silence, both of them deep in thought yet not quite certain how to voice those thoughts. Almost a minute passed with either of the men speaking, Sirius stared in front of himself, feeling the long forgotten scents of the household slowly return to him as nostalgic impressions.
“Do you feel like your own emotions are similar to any of your siblings?” Neville continued to lead the discussion. “Out of the ones you do know, that is.” He appeared slightly uncomfortable with the leadership role, but he was nonetheless attempting to act in a manner which would at least improve the current situation for the better.
“Then could we perform a blood ritual on the door to this house so that I may come and go as I please?” Harry looked to his dogfather. “If I am to become the heir to the building, it seems foolish to not complete that ritual as soon as possible. Dad, you should do it too. It is definitely good if you can access your own home in the future, even without Sirius being present.”
However, the silence was broken without being allowed to prolong. The door opened and Neville stepped inside, bringing with him the scent of the Hogwarts greenhouse. He looked happy and relaxed, which was just what everyone wanted at that moment.
Bill was a number of years older than George. When they were little, that number had felt giant, but the older they got, the less large the number appeared. He was dressing like the type of person who traditionally liked rock as a genre, with leather pants and a patterned dark purple shirt which hung off his body to allow some breathing room in the warm summer. He generally wore a collection of rings, bracelets and necklaces in his preferred color of gold, but in the heat, he had instead elected to only wear a golden earring depicting the eye of Horus. George expected his brother to put on some more jewellery before they left, as he preferred to dress like he wanted when he wasn’t on the clock.
“Thus, the first implementation I make is that members of a House are always required to sit by their table and only their table. Students are not allowed to sit by any other table than the one assigned to their House. Overstepping this boundary is a display of lacking respect for order and discipline, and it is a direct insult towards this fine school and its founders to ignore the House system so utterly.” Umbridge continued to speak over the murmurs which erupted in the wake of her first new rule.
When Potter moved, his shirt was wandering up and down in a rather dangerous manner, forcing Bill to focus on his face with all his might so as to not look for evidence of what was under the rainbow shirt.
“Wait… wait, wasn’t she like… uh, what’s the Muggle word… An angel? Completely innocent and never did anything wrong?” Sirius couldn’t help but interrupt the other man.
was up to the individual teachers. Thus they published and shipped around this cut up version of the study.
The abandonment had not surprised anyone, not even Bella. It had nothing to do with the fact that Rodolphus had taken another husband so soon after her, and it had nothing to do with him not loving his wife, of that Narcissa was certain. Many Purebloods lived in large families, and both she and her two sisters were the result of three consequential and successful marriages. The failure of Bella’s marriage had nothing to do with Rabastan being better than her, which he probably was, but with the fact that Bella had finally stepped beyond what Rodolphus was willing or capable to handle.
It all culminated in Harry feeling relieved and happy that Draco had ended up speaking up about the clothes, and asked Sirius for permission to take them. Harry hoped that he hadn’t come off as dismissive or disinterested earlier, as he really did want the clothes, but simply hadn’t dared wanting them. Part of Harry wondered if Draco somehow knew what he felt, and had acted because he understood that Harry was struggling to. It felt a little too convenient for it to just be coincidence, but it was possible that it was. Nonetheless, Harry was thankful and happy, especially after he learnt that almost everything he had tried on was within his size range, or would be when he had grown a little older.
Professor Slughorn turned towards Ngo-Kwang, addressing her instead. “Did the two of you come here together, Ms. Chang?”
After followed a short silence, during which the Dark Lord didn’t quite think of anything but the fact that he found Severus to be somewhat hard to speak to. He then thought of the idea that Severus could read his mind, and expressed the sentiment with an odd calm. “You must be reading my mind?”
Harry frowned at the old hat, chewing absentmindedly on his own lower lip. “It’s hard to imagine him not always being understanding and, well… kind. Are you telling me that he was not?”
The two of them were stopped outside of Harry’s room by Remus’ voice, coming from the office which was more or less located in the attic. “Harry? Did Draco arrive yet?”
“I’m his son,” Lupin followed suit and pointed towards second hand store galore and the layered bat.
Harry blinked at her, then nodded. “That’s a very good idea. I’m sure dad wouldn’t mind. Professor Snape is taking me home this weekend, so I’ll definitely take the time to ask him.”
“Well… Uh, he didn’t take too kindly to the plan of having his kid thrown into Azkaban, I guess?” Greyback was becoming annoyed in return as he was questioned, and his voice was slowly becoming a growl.
All Goyle’s friends were on the Dark Lord’s side. His mothers as well. It was obvious where he was supposed to be, but everyone also automatically assumed that he would already be loyal based on the fact that he was expected to.
Albus stared at him before shaking his silvery head in a weak objection. “That is one of the few things I cannot understand… Tom was never a Pureblood. He never believed in those ideals, and he was only obsessed with his own blood because he wanted to find his family. Or rather, the family which abandoned him. No matter how I think it over, I do not understand why he would want to eradicate the Muggle-born population. He should know, he should understand better.” At the very least, he appeared to be calming down somewhat as he clutched his necklace to his chest.
“You’re allergic? Hang on a second…” Hagrid turned towards the window and opened it up, as well as the back door. “Dumbledore helped me with an enchantment long ago, the back door is protected from being rained inside from, even if the wind blows.” He explained as he returned.
“It does seem foolish, when you phrase it like that.” Harry agreed, trying hard to imagine what the Death Eaters could possibly do when faced with a gun. He recognised that they could accomplish plenty of damage to the mage community, which they had during the Mage War, but the Death Eaters truly didn’t appear to be a threat to the entirety of the world, not the way which Harry had thought that they were when he was younger.
Arthur Weasley’s office was a city of paperstacks and filing cabinets. Harry more or less landed in a pile of parchments, folders and paper as he stumbled out of the fireplace, then knocked another over when Ron pulled him to his feet. Judging by the already fallen stacks, Ron had likely already knocked some of the paper skyscrapers down as well, but was pretending to not care.
“You forget about his body,” Dumbledore politely reminded the witch. “He is not what he once was, and we know about a great number of his horcruxes. If his body is destroyed once more, that could give you plenty of time to find and destroy them, even if I advocate for finding and destroying them before one attempts to destroy his body.”
This day, Sirius had gotten up earlier than he usually did, as the weather had finally gotten cold enough that the former convict wasn’t suffering too much from it. He was wearing the same T-shirt as he had been wearing yesterday, combined with his favorite shorts, and nothing on his feet. His hair had been gathered away from his face into a tight topknot which Harry had tried to mimic with his own hair but hadn’t quite figured out how to do it yet, so his was rather messy.
“I brought the bedding and her food bowls, but the rest of the things do seem to be here. Look at this here.” Draco knelt before the terrarium and pointed at a thermometer.
“You don’t believe that you can, do you, sir?” Harry hadn’t meant to speak up about it, but he had noticed that Albus was not certain of his statement. Further, he hadn’t meant to express his disbelief through the usage of a polite title, but it came to be despite his intentions.
Harry wanted to hug Hermione too, and tell her that everything would be alright. He knew that it was better to leave it to Neville and allow her the comfort of her best friend’s assistance, but Harry wanted badly to hug her nonetheless. For the moment, all he could do was to remain understanding, even if it hurt to remain inactive.
He then focused on her face, and his calm, almost distant expression was changed into one of concern and worry. “You don’t look so well, did something happen?”
“You may keep your name if you want to, and you may change it when the time is right,” I promise him.
The word wasn’t aggressive in the least, it wasn’t accusing, or frightening. Rather, it was desperate, maybe even pleading.
Behind the couple, their daughter rolled her eyes. “Is there really going to be a werewolf here, ma? I want to meet a werewolf. They said that he would be in the Order, but there was no werewolf there.” Nymphadora Tonks whispered to her mum as she passed her.
“The Hufflepuff goblet is not at Hogwarts any longer,” Albus said. “It was something donated by the Black family, and it was retracted due to an incident before any of you were born, where…” Realisation hit him before he settled down once more, chewing on his lower lip. “Where the goblet was stolen for about two months, and then reappeared once more as if it had never been taken. The Blacks retrieved it at that point and stored it in their family vault. Blood-locked, naturally…”
He is right, I most definitely do. Whenever I’m scared, or even paralysed, I find it easier to think of what El would do than to figure out how Albus should deal with the problem.
I nod to myself as I rest my head in my hand, gathering the information I have on the topic within my head. “That is quite the rare, obscure magic. If you don’t mind me asking, how did you come across it?” I do not feel alarmed by his inquiry, but slightly confused. There should be no information about the topic within the Hogwarts library, as it is considered too diffuse of a subject to be listed in an academic establishment.
“I think I… I really needed this. A lot. Thanks.” George sighed, admitting to himself that he had needed the distraction.
“Sheesh…” Harry mumbled as he leaned back against Draco, feeling his cheeks heat yet again. He solved the problem of heating cheeks by burying his nose in Draco’s familiar scent. “Well, he didn’t exactly give me a golden snake ring for my birthday.” Harry chuckled into his boyfriend’s shoulder. “You’re still a more accomplished man of, uh, flirt.”
After a moment of evaluation, the man dropped the trash bag upon the frozen steps of his path, his eyes beginning to overfill with tears.
We have long since struggled with that part of our relationship. Every time I attempt to motivate myself to hug him, I find reasons and excuses not to. It might have been that I have frightened him away from touching me altogether, but at this point, I do not know how to mend it. The awareness that my own son cannot find it within him to touch me without my permission, even when I need it the most, makes my panic worse. I push my face against the floorboards, struggling to breathe as I push the newspaper towards my almost adult son. I can’t look at it again.
I hate that the confession will likely turn the talented and handsome Durmstrang student away, especially when I fail to keep my tears back from running down my face. I feel so very guilty as I expect him to think that I was only pleasant to him because I wanted a friend to force all of this onto. Like a desperate character from
Severus allowed Remus the comfort of a gentle smile before he continued speaking, “however, when I returned to Hogwarts for my next year as a teacher, I was further investigated by Dolores Umbridge herself, and a report was filed about her finding me unsuitable for the students.”
It was cold and he was using his internal magic to stay warm for the first time. It was easier than he had thought since he had good control over his magic courtesy of becoming an Animagus, but he was mostly going along and figuring it out as he went.
If these things were true about Greyback, then they were likely not true because the fifteen year old child had been born a monster, but because the mage community had made him one. Sirius had been capable of murder after twelve years, and had been utterly disturbed once released. Greyback had spent even more time in Azkaban, since a young and rather impressionable age at that. That fact made it even harder for Remus to hate the werewolf who had turned him. After all, Greyback was simply six years older than Remus, they would have attended school at the same time, had the mage community allowed the young werewolf to be part of it. If Remus’ father hadn’t compromised that child’s safety, maybe Remus and Greyback could have even been friends, like he and Narcissa had become during their later years.
Harry’s cheeks began to heat and he sat down upon the other’s lap nonetheless with a small, happy smile upon his face. Harry felt a little like a royal heir on their throne, yet nobody cared about him in their desire to overtake the space which Harry had left when he ascended the throne of Draco.
“I was hoping that you would not object to me calling you by your name in private then, si-, I mean… Severus?” Harry found that it was odd to speak the name out loud, almost incomprehensible to fathom while it had been easy to accept within his mind. That somehow, they were actually that close.
Once he reached the end of his story, Sirius’s head felt light while his body felt heavy. He had been given a few glasses of cognac to strengthen him through the story, yet it had not been enough to keep him from crying at many points. Benny appeared very tired as well. He had cried alongside Sirius at some points, especially when he learnt the details about the death of his other son and daughter in law. Yet he had mostly refrained from speaking up, allowing Sirius to simply speak until he had reached the end of his retelling.
“You want one? Really?” Colin was clearly nervous, but he was also evidently excited as he let go of the door handle. “Can I?” His gaze travelled between the two of them, as if he was asking them both permission.
“Ah, Harry! Welcome!” Professor Slughorn greeted him with a broad, open and honest smile as he waved to the other three. “That makes for most of our guests. Winkie, close the door,” the last was addressed to the House Elf who stood by the door, patiently waiting for her next orders.
.” Narcissa nodded upon the mentioning of the title, observing the letter in the young man’s hand. “Shakespeare. I have studied contemporary Muggle literature in my younger days.” Potter made an amused noise upon the woman saying the word ‘contemporary.’ The noise eared a stern glance from the mother, and a highly confused one from the son.
“But you don’t know…” Tom whimpers, stepping forward to meet me halfway in the kitchen. His hand is red by his side, likely throbbing with pain as his green eyes fill with emotions. I can see the love for me within them, the love between family members. A love I don’t deserve. “You don’t know that you will come back.”
“Most appreciated, Ronald.” Draco simply handed the bag to Ron, having noted that the athletic teenager was more than capable of lifting it on his own.
“But if she is happy,” Hermione began, “then something must have changed. If she is happy, and if it is their choice to separate, which it is, then… Maybe this is the start of something better for her.”
Umbridge sneezed loudly and backed away from the dog as she produced a handkerchief from her handbag, which was elaborately embroidered and as white as the untouched snow outside. “This is most irregular! Our meeting is not yet done.”
Andromeda felt as if her eyes would fall out of her head. Her mind was spinning and her mouth opened and closed without the ability to vocalise whatever it was she tried to vocalise. She followed Molly’s finger as it came to rest upon the dark haired man with the T-shirt and pajama trousers. He was currently laughing with his friends, unaware of Andromeda’s presence.
“Are we actually being interrupted by a snake…” Draco’s statement made Harry laugh, as the two of them detangled themselves from one another.
“The world does not exist simply because I do,” yet again, the old wizard’s voice was patient. “You give me too much credit, and I cannot help but express disgust towards a community where only one absolute can rule. I was never going to live forever. You must look to yourself and to what is right to do, not to somebody else. You cannot all live in my shadow.”
“I will prove to you that I am not,” I stand up, keeping his hands in mine. “Let’s go together right now. I will show you that I am worthy of your trust.”
Ginny kissed Luna on both cheeks before she excused herself to arrange something Quidditch related. The daughter of a werewolf smiled happily and waved her girlfriend off. As Luna sat down next to Harry on the sofa, Ron turned towards Teddy with a worried expression.
She shrugged as she dared to look up from her cat’s body. “I think you can in some manners, but that charm shouldn’t have been so easy to shake off. That was powerful magic.”
Someone who didn’t know Draco Malfoy might have thought that he would be suffering from being a Weasley. If that had been true once upon a time, it was not true today. Draco’s only struggle was the increased body mass because maneuverability was different than he was used to, as well as the fact that he was still suffering from what had now become phantom pain from his prominent scar. The heavier body also made it harder for Draco to put weight on his right hip. Thus, Harry and Draco remained seated a lot that day, but that really wasn’t a problem for them, as staying to the side with Remus suited them just fine.
Molly flushed as she was called ‘dear’ by the other woman, unaware that it was a term of affection which Mrs. Malfoy was not shy to wield, yet would previously never have extended to a supposed blood traitor.
“That’s a good question…” Arthur rested his head in his hand, chewing absentmindedly at his lower lip. “Any… idea?”
“A pleasure to assist you, family gatherings tend to be somewhat taxing, I should know.” He chuckled to himself.
Remus breathed in the scent of London as he came to stand beside Severus, still slightly transfixed by the lights in the water. The streetlight next to them had died, perhaps by Severus’ assistance, rendering the two of them in a soft, almost gentle darkness. A street dog howled somewhere and Remus repressed the urge to howl back as he reached out and touched Severus’ arm. The next thing he knew, his husband to be was in his arms, hiding against his chest.
“You… aren’t upset by Cre-, I mean, Colin, flirting with Harry?” Hermione carefully asked, looking between the two boyfriends with a nervous look on her face. The both of them recognised the look which she gave them, which was that of when something differed strongly from how what she was used to seeing in the Muggle world. Thus, Hermione wasn’t necessarily nervous as much as that it was always a little hard to speak up about Muggle society whenever something she was used to evidently didn’t apply to the mage community.
He couldn’t do that to Harry. He’d be no better than his stupid dad who wanted his kids without loving either them or caring about the woman he had them with.
If you're curious about the song Keep Talking, here's a link to the officially licensed YouTube version with lyrics:
Ever since they had been born, everything between them had been the same. Same clothes, same goals, same room, same house, same preferences for food. Same Hogwarts House, same uniform, and they even played Quidditch the same, in the very same position.
Crabbe leaned back on his heels and stretched up, still staring at Harry like a beast before prey. “Umbridge wants to see you Potter. In her office. Get going.”
However, Arthur’s stories slowly turned to complaints. Tired, heartbroken and sometimes angry complaints. Work was slowly demanding more and more of him, and as Molly got pregnant again and again, Arthur had to work harder and longer.
“Somehow, it is very easy imagining Professor Lupin as a Prefect.” Neville nodded to himself, his expression a mixture of impressed and amused.
“I’m the son of a werewolf, I’m a Parselmouth, I’m friends with former Death Eaters, Purebloods, Muggle-borns and children of Death Eaters. My godfather is Sirius Black, I’ve been depressed since I was fourteen, and I am dating Draco Malfoy. I don’t care about what you or any other person wants for me in terms of being an icon for you to project onto. My very own blood was taken from me to resurrected the Dark Lord last summer. My name is Harry Lupin, and nothing you say or feel can ever change that fact. I am my own person, I don’t belong to you or the mage community.” Harry stared at her, meeting her shocked, accusing gaze with his own unwavering one.
It was not as if there were no clues about the actual identity of El. Harry had not been able to make out his name upon the newspaper headline, but he had heard enough to conclude that the person appeared to be involved with the American Mage War to the point where the war could be stopped if someone simply spoke to him. However, he had irrationally hoped, maybe even wanted, that the love of Albus Dumbledore’s life would not have been the infamous Gellert Grindelwald.
Arthur had always pleased himself with the knowledge that he was better than Lucius from a moral perspective. Even before he knew for a fact that Lucius was a Death Eater and had always been, he was happy to know that he was a member of the Order of the Phoenix which was actively fighting for people’s rights, while Lucius wanted to take those rights away.
Harry nodded. He recalled Umbridge's dislike for werewolves painfully clearly. He also recalled that Luna had been speaking with a heavy stutter last year, but that appeared to have calmed down significantly. She stuttered in a few places, and generally fumbled some words in her longer sentences, but she was nonetheless far better off than last term.
Hermione was rejected in a letter which had broken Narcissa’s heart to write as she expressed sentiments of hate and disgust which did in no way reflect how she actually felt. Yet she had to write it under the watchful eye of Bellatrix Lestrange, her most insane sister, leaving her no choice but to be as cruel as she could for the sake of discouraging the young woman from attempting to contact Narcissa ever again.
Professor Slughorn frowned, leaning his head to the side. He seemed displeased about something. “I’m not quite certain that the situation is dire enough that Ms. Parkinson should feel unsafe in her own home. However, if that is what both you and Ms. Parkinson feel would be the safest for her, I shall of course not object to the idea. Many students are struggling right now, and it is the Headmaster’s belief that their safety should be a priority. Naturally, Ms. Parkinson would be required to report to me even after she has switched Houses so that I know that she truly does feel safe, but I hold no objections to her switching living quarters, as well as uniform, should she wish to.”
“You’re supposed to have two of them, as this terrarium does. One colder side, and one warmer, so you will have to check the temperature regularly.” He pointed at two thermometers, and then at another round thermometer looking object. “This here is a hydrometer, which measures moisture in the air. You are supposed to keep an eye on it to maintain the right moisture level, thus keep your snake healthy. She will suffer if the moisture isn’t right. Luckily, you also have some houses for her to hide in, they are not as big as the ones at her home at the manor, but it will go fine for her.” Draco smiled at Harry. “Not to mention, you can actually ask her what she needs, so you have an advantage there.”
He did not want Pettigrew traumatised beyond saving, more than the man already was. At a later time, he would have to consider a permanent solution to keep the man safe from such absolutely inexcusable acts. If the Dark Lord could not keep his followers safe from each other, then what kind of leader would he be?
After going through the rounds of introductions, causing names and faces to swim before the former prisoner’s eyes, Benny brought Sirius aside to his office in the basement and asked that they would not be disturbed. Sirius felt more than overwhelmed as he took a seat in one of the armchairs in the office, turning his back to the racks of alcohol which he pretended to not notice in the hopes that it would make him less desperate for something stronger to drink. He had been given a cup of coffee which he had placed upon the table next to him as he rubbed his own face.
However, all of these things came second notice to Bill, as he found himself all the more distracted by the person who had appeared to him once he had stepped through the doors.
“With the technological developments of the Muggle world and their science, a war with Muggles would result in a devastating loss for the mage community. We might have magic, but they have guns, advanced weaponry and something which is called nuclear bombs, or nuclear power. Our abilities are nothing in the face of nuclear technology, and a single gun is more deadly than most mages, as it takes a will to kill with magic, but simply the push of a finger and a lucky shot to kill someone with a gun. Not to mention there are guns designed to aim and hit at longer ranges than anything a mage could see or accomplish with magic.” Professor Snape sighed to himself, shaking his head. “The idea of mage dominance over Muggles is a foolish dream in this day and age. The Death Eaters would know that if they ever took the time to look outside their little expanse of the world to see the real one.”
A total of 48 Death Eaters escaped from Azkaban prison sometime during the night between yesterday and today, fleeing from the prison as a wall collapsed, allowing a significant number of Death Eaters to escape the Dementors’ guard and flee into the country. The names and faces of the criminals have been listed in this copy of
“Pettigrew is very weak, and quite obviously, visually so. I’m afraid that Greyback has taken a liking to him, more specifically, to frighten him. I do not know quite how far their relationship has progressed, but I fear that it might not be consensual in the least.” Severus concluded his report with an emotionless, direct voice. It was evident that he did not want to feel, or he risked feeling too much about the horrors which he had just revealed to Remus.
“If you’re not opposed to the idea, it would be great to have you alone.” George hesitated before he answered honestly. “As I said, I have so many things I want to ask you, and not all of them are legal in terms of magic, so I’d rather not have anyone lecture me about the fact that it might not be legal.” George made a face which perfectly communicated that he understood that some of what he wanted to know would be interrupted by other people if they heard it.
Whatever Ron had expected the problem to be, it had not been that Teddy had actually witnessed his supposed father beat his mother to death. The revelation was so shocking that Ron didn’t quite know what to say to it, yet it turned out that he didn’t quite need to say anything, as Teddy needed to be listened to more than he needed to be talked to. Thus, Ron learned the reason as to why Teddy hated his old man and refused to call him by any parental title, while also learning why he hated to be called Ted, as that was what Nott Senior called him.
“I don’t have a partner for the moment,” Neville spoke up from behind Ginny. For once, he was spending time with them as the Herbology Club had managed to complete their duties in time for the winter holiday break. “I’d be happy to invite Luna so that she can be with you and your girlfriend.”
You will get to know Fenrir Greyback's full storyline later in the series, and thus it shall not be spoiled here.
Arthur Weasley loved Muggles and all things and inventions belonging to Muggles. Everyone knew that. It was almost an obsession, or rather, quite the obsession. Everyone knew that.
Even after being saved from the prison, Rabastan could still recall lying in his cell with his arm stretched out through the bars to hold onto Rodolphus secure, steady hand as the other man spoke to him for hours, simply to make Rabastan want to keep on living. Rodolphus who was usually quiet and didn't have much to say went out of his way to speak despite his state of fatigue, depression, starvation and otherwise created by Azkaban. Despite the horrible situation and the painful existence of being a prisoner, Rabastan recalled his husband’s love with utmost gratitude and happiness. Thus, he attempted very much to recover quickly and care for his husband in return, as neither of them was even close to fine after having been freed from the endless days of mental torture and removal of their will to live.
Peter Pettigrew froze as Severus Snape appeared around the corner, appearing as if he was a ghost from the past. A large, black ghost which was so impossibly present that he could not comprehend that it was really there. Peter blinked again, and the apparition of Snape was still there.
“I got it from Si-, my dogfather.” Harry managed to correct himself as he looked down at the asymmetrical black bustle which was his skirt. It had a little bit of a corset to it, which made Harry feel rather confident in his posture. “It feels surprisingly friendly of a clothing piece for him to have owned, so I assume I have inherited it from his brother.”
Worple stumbled through a response which ended with him meekly apologising as the vampire petted his shoulder.
Only Lucius was suffering now, and Arthur had suddenly realised that he didn’t want him to. Had he ever wanted Lucius to suffer, or had Arthur simply wanted Lucius to stop hurting him?
Every hair appeared to stand on end upon Harry’s body as he watched the Dark Lord travel over the floor with his naked, pale feet making no sound as he walked over the marble tiles.
Professor Slughorn slowly wetted his lips, “you… don’t have short hair?” He asked in a quiet voice, which was filled to the brim with disbelief.
“It is rather small…” George commented as he turned away from Teddy to look at his own shoes. He felt like he should be angry to have been touched without permission, yet he didn’t feel upset. Nobody really touched him, especially since the incident with his hands. George hadn’t realised that he had missed being touched. Further, to his great joy, he had actually been able to feel the squeeze of the other’s hand, albeit faintly. It hadn’t been unpleasant. “It feels like something which should be larger, seeing as it completely shatters all our thoughts about…” He stopped as he realised that he had referred to them as a set once more, and not as individuals.
Pat was in no way equipped to handle something like this with somebody else, even if she understood it, and she truly didn’t know what to say. She thought of Ngo-Kwang and of what she would do, but came up with no solution. Then she thought of Vince, and remembered that some of his advice hadn’t actually been terrible from the beginning.
Sirius jumped at the voice behind him, and spun around so quickly that his hair flared out like a skirt. The Master pouted at the House Elf but quickly gathered himself. “Do you know where they keep the tools for safe blood extraction?”
Summer passed quickly, with Harry and his friends being lost in studying. In addition to studying the Potions book, Harry was practising wielding magic without the use of his wand. It was not that he was using his internal magic to cause a reaction, but instead, he was wielding the unruly magic around him with his own body rather than relying on his wand.
Sirius easily sent his spell rolling to the side as he continued to approach Rabastan with a mad grin as amusement and joy reflected in his dark eyes. “Don’t you think I’m a little short to make a good replacement for your crush?”
Ngo-Kwang brought Pat to Professor Slughorn’s office when she had managed to calm down enough to trust her own legs, and when enough time had passed so that there was little to no risk of running into Vince down in the dungeons. On the way there, Pat half-listened to her explaining that she had been looking for Pat all over, and probably just missed her in the hospital wing, after the Quidditch game.
“...Would you kindly leave me alone for a little bit, children?” Professor Dumbledore spoke softly to the gathered people, forgetting that they had all grown up since long, with the exception of Harry who was still a teenager and therefore technically not an adult. The Headmaster looked upon the package in his lap as if it was something nostalgic to him, but also something which brought him great pain.
“Since you ask so very politely,” the Dark Lord mocked him. “I have need of your services by my side. In particular, many of my followers are currently suffering from extensive mental trauma as well as certain physical effects upon their bodies from their imprisonment in Azkaban. As you are well aware of, I lost a collection of followers and companions to the battle at the Ministry earlier this year, but more are finding their way to me the more time passes.” He smiled a smile without joy as concern slipped into his voice like another gentle stroke of cold but well meaning fingers.
“That is rather curious to think about,” Neville agreed as he began to lead Harry with him down the corridor. “I’m sorry to have bothered your conversation, but I think I have found a way to finally get through to Professor Slughorn.”
Andromeda finally breathed out when her tears began to yield to reason. She took a few deep breaths as her mind returned to the realisation that Narcissa appeared to have changed in more significant ways than simply losing track of her words. She could not believe it, yet a Muggle-born woman was wearing Narcissa’s first dress. It was irrefutable proof no matter how many times she looked.
While most members agreed that they wanted to follow Albus Dumbledore more than they wanted to listen to Scrimgeour, there was disagreement amongst them in regards to how much power Professor Dumbledore should have over their actions. Some preferred him to simply act as an icon to call more people to their cause, seeing as his method of averting a war was so far unsuccessful. There were even some individuals who were worried that the whole Order might simply be an elaborate act to gather Ministry traitors and possible Death Eater sympathisers by using the Greatest Wizard as bait. Such paranoid claims were not well founded in the least, but Arthur’s speech caused some people, both inside and outside the Order, to consider him a Death Eater sympathiser simply on virtue of him wanting to keep those innocent of crimes out of a cruel death in prison.
“It might not be… The future is uncertain… There is very likely a second war coming…” Severus’ words ended up unconnected, almost shy as he struggled to keep his gaze away from Remus, yet struggled to look upon him. “The Dark Lord might call me back to his side at any time and I couldn’t refuse it and risk his wrath upon the people around me…”
Someone called out to her. The call was one of those which made it hard to tell if she had been called ‘Pansy’ or ‘Pantsy.’ Pat turned towards the voice and felt her heart sink so deep into her chest that she felt like throwing up once more.
I sit down upon the rocks next to him, sighing as I escape the rays of the sun and hide in the shadows. “You mean something like, for the greater good? That mages should rule Muggles for the greater good?”
“I was wondering if you could destroy something for me. You will need to bite it, and make sure that it is completely crushed. Can you do that for me?” Harry waited for an answer before he presented the package to her.
I had never known I enjoy such matters, especially the intricate global politics of the novel, yet I find myself deeply interested. It feels as if Gellert has shown me a new side of myself which I did not previously know existed, and he has recommended a few more books which seem to hold promise of similar ventures and exciting experiences. Books I might even claim to feel passionate about, as they make me feel things I was not aware were within my capability.
Admittedly, it was not like he could be directly confident about his changed appearance without having the chance to become accustomed to it, yet Draco did not suffer considerably. To Harry’s great happiness and slight embarrassment, one of the first things Draco had told him when he had recovered enough to speak without hurting, was that due to his close relationship with Remus, he did not find the scar embarrassing or shameful. He had then added that he and Harry currently suited each other, which had caused Harry to more or less bawl for ten consecutive minutes as he was gently consoled by his boyfriend’s gentle hand upon his head.
“Please… if I’m worth it, if I can be… Save me…” Draco whispered, desperation allowing him no restraints as he pleaded for salvation like a sinner would before their hanging.
Rabastan knew that his husband was yet again going to follow Bellatrix as he yet again risked their safety and future by continuing to chase after the woman who had never even wanted him in the first place. Rodolphus turned back to him with a look which Rabastan recognised as pained, but which another person might have considered empty.
As February passed into March, the group contemplated what to do about their situation, and concluded that the rules were uncaring about the larger groups of friends like them. It could be that the rule was designed with the purpose of making sure that no Death Eater groups or Dark Lord sympathisers managed to meet and grow within the walls of the castle, but that did not mean that Harry and his friends didn’t feel personally targeted by Umbridge’s new implementation.
“I will do everything in my power to assure that Draco is not harmed as he strives to complete the task.” Severus spoke with such certainty that it brought tears to Narcissa’s eyes as she finally dared to hope that her son might not lose his life to the quest which had been trusted upon him.
Harry looked and spotted some additional vials of the snake venom antidote which Hermione had made, the jumping werewolf created by Teddy, a plant gifted to Harry by Neville, and a collection of photographs taken by Colin. Further, there were letters from Remus, origami birds given to Harry from Al, as well as old jewellery gifted to him from both the Malfoys and the Blacks.
Professor Umbridge left Harry alone after he had detention with her. He had expected some manner of retaliation for his mockery of an essay, but she didn’t call him back to her office to speak about it. Harry mostly avoided drawing attention to himself during her boring, non-educational and comparatively unstructured lessons. She had them read the chapters of the book during the lessons, while writing down noteworthy things, then summarise their noteworthy things in a short essay which was supposed to be handed in by the end of the lesson. This meant that some students, like Hermione, would write long, in depth, texts about what little was in the handbook. Others, like Ron and Teddy, would scrape together a mere fifty words at best. Some would finish early and have no choice but to sit silently and wait for the lesson to end, while others would battle against the clock to hand in their essay at all. The lesson structure might not be horrendous and devoid of learning opportunity altogether, but when it was the only lesson, whatever value it might have had quickly disappeared. Not to mention that the source material which they worked with was laughable, and had little to no consistency.
They were right in that he disliked it, but Harry hadn’t decided to accept the name only to abandon his choice when matters became rough.
came to everyone in the Great Hall, even those who couldn’t afford it or chose not to have a subscription. Many worried voices filled the Great Hall, and they only grew louder as more and more people read their free copy of
“I… I wasn’t… I guess I did, huh…?” Chang hugged her duck once more, sighing deeply. “Either way, I am ready to listen now. Please tell me everything, or as much as you can.”
“Releasing magic from your head is the hardest.” Sirius commented as he sat down in one of the armchairs. “I can’t see anything happening, so I can’t help you in this. You just have to figure it out and then think about transforming, willing the transfiguration to happen.”
Because I want more of him, I do not hesitate to agree to the creation of such a charm. Two such charms. One for me, and one for him. El has stolen two corked bottles from the Potions class, ones which he made smaller with magic. They are heavier due to their shrunken size, but I enjoy the weight in my hand. El has prepared everything from the knife to the chains which we will use to make the bottles into necklaces. For my bottle, he has made small star ornaments to hang from the chain once the bottles are full of our mixed blood, and for his own, he shaped a half moon.
“Too far?” Draco’s voice asked from somewhere within the covers. Harry thought that he could see the outline of his blonde hair silhouetted against the dark pillow.
George life had always been centered around that idea of being the same, and now the idea of being different from Fred was terrifying to him. It was utterly unknown, and utterly incomprehensible.
She made a noise which he concluded to be agreeing. Harry was indeed fine as he peeked at the large snake from his hand mirror, so he gathered all his courage, wondered briefly if Sirius would have been proud of him for almost being reckless, and looked directly at her.
“You might have heard my mum talk about a Potter, that would be Sirius Black.” Ron continued to explain.
Vince’s immediate reaction to her fearing their relationship was to start insulting her character and personality, and that was not alright. Such an action was never alright.
Fleur and Bill appeared as stark opposites of one another in the way they both had chosen to dress. Bill was wearing a pair of black leather trousers and combat boots which sported plenty of metal objects which function Harry did not know, yet assumed that Sirius would adore upon seeing them. On his upper body, he wore a longer coat in a rather heavy material in a dark red hue, yet a simple black T-shirt underneath. Added to that, he wore a collection of Egyptian themed jewellery which he had likely purchased directly from sellers in the country itself. Harry made a guess that perhaps he felt better being surrounded by something he loved, which reminded him of safety, while meeting his family for the winter holidays.
“Hello, how nice to see you.” Remus felt joy spread through him at the sight of his partner, his heart trembling in his chest and his lips curling continuously upwards, forming honest, joyful smiles.
Together, the two friends walked to the Pensieve, and Harry looked up at the old wizard’s tired yet gentle face with the brilliantly blue, yet endlessly sad eyes. Harry nodded towards him, then closed his eyes, closed his hand around the bottle so as to not allow it to hit against the stone chalice. He then leaned forward, breathing in Al’s memories for what he assumed to be the last time.
Like Remus had warned him of, it had only gotten Peter hurt to be played with by Sirius. Although Remus had told Peter to not fall for it, he hadn’t actually ever told Sirius to stop, as he also feared that his friends would abandon him if he was too opinionated. At the time, Remus had also been dating Severus Snape, which made him ever more eager to not disturb anything within his group of friends.
The verbal expression of gratitude made Arthur embarrassed, and he quickly attempted to wave it away by changing the topic. The topic he picked might not have been the smoothest one to pick in hindsight. “If you need a break, you can always come hide out in that chair.” Arthur felt like he was rambling. “It’s not like we have to be friends for you to use my office as a place for resting.”
“Yet, sir… Kreacher has begun to realise that, maybe, a lot of what the child is lays in the success or failure of their parents. Master Regulus was the boy he was because his parents failed him, as is Master Sirius. Mistress Narcissa is accomplished because she was beloved by her parents, while you, sir, succeeded despite not being beloved. The Master whom Kreacher loved, the child who came into his life like the memory of a ghost… They are not the same. It is… hard for Kreacher to think of them as different, but one was raised with love. Real love. Not what the Madam showed her children.” Kreacher stopped to take a shaking breath as he carefully laced his long fingers around the teacup, staring deep into the reflection within it as if it could allow him to face his own memories.
Harry and Draco exchanged surprised looks as they heard Dobby stop speaking about himself in third person and instead spoke like most other people with agency would speak like.
However, Harry was able to answer. “Because I wanted to be a member of the Slug Club, and I was afraid that you wouldn’t want to admit me above Harry Potter.”
“I don’t even call Lucius that,” Sirius laughed and waved his hand in front of him as if to hit the thought away. “I’m not going to call any kids that.”
“But if you were to be hexed and fight against one another, that wouldn’t be ideal either,” Al knew that she was right and thus objected weakly to something other than her direct statement.
Harry had spoken to his boyfriend in private about wanting his friends to know all that happened, but confessed that he didn’t feel emotionally capable of retelling it yet again. Thus, Draco had offered to do it for Harry. Harry remained in the room in the shape of a snake, resting on top of Draco mostly, but also a little on Ron, as he refrained from listening to the retelling.
The people who worked were the vast majority by far, and the system worked as thus they should provide for the other two categories in return for physical respectively spiritual protection. The aristocracy functioned as the military leaders, and their role was to serve under the regent and protect the area. In turn for their loyalty to the regent they were given the opportunity to collect taxes, escape taxes themselves, to rule certain smaller areas and other various boons.
Hermione was taller than all the young women, but she still felt very small in front of them. It was frightening and slightly dehumanising to be cornered by a group of people using intimidation and scare tactics. Hermione knew that the girls would never admit that they weren’t being fair and were threatening her with numbers, while expecting her to stand trial alone, despite the fact that they were doing it. As they were blocking the door, Hermione surrendered to the situation of not being able to leave. She averted her gaze from Lavender’s face and addressed her feet instead. “Yes?”
As Colin was not able to handle Harry as a snake after being a victim of Secrets the basilisk, one of Harry’s coping mechanisms didn’t work together with his newfound friend. However, Colin was more than happy to hug when Harry needed one. Harry tried to pretend that he needed hugs less than he actually did.
“He was a politician,” Harry tried again, “who many consider to have been corrupt. In the beginning, he was campaigning for the overturn of the Statute of Secrecy, claiming that mages deserved to be known as well as rule their own affairs openly, with the Muggle population, or Non-magic, No-Maj, as they say in America, being subservient to us, rather than us being afraid of them. He considered the fact that Muggle-borns mages could and were born as a evidence that magic is superior and found everywhere, making it foolish to deny our supposed claim over the world as a more than averagely powerful minority. Grindelwald wanted to establish an Embassy of Magic in every state, which reported to a supreme government in the capital of America. His political slogan was ‘for the greater good.’”
In many ways, the physical extract of a memory isn't too different from the magic in a Patronus Charm or any extraction of internal magic taking a physical form.
“I do not think you have to worry yourself about marriage as of currently,” Severus gently reminded Harry. “As strange as it might sound when coming from me, I believe you should simply enjoy your relationship for what it is, or was, rather than consider what it could have been.”
Remus’ face fell and he quickly shook his head, unable to comprehend what he had initially heard. “No. No, Harry. I couldn’t possibly allow that. You’re still a minor! I couldn’t bear to think of what could happen… I cannot… No.”
Lucius’ gaze was not mocking, yet Arthur identified as such before he realised that the other was simply hesitating in what to say to him. “Has it not reached the other departments as of yet?”
“Tell me everything, please!” The young woman who had lost her partner begged Harry. “In detail. All of it. Please, I need to know. I want to believe you, I really do, and I feel like I will if you just help me.”
Harry averted his gaze, feeling his face burn and his chest feeling oddly happy while also heavy with insecurity. “It feels unfair though. You waiting for me, and me having you as a friend in the meantime while I figure out what to do, and what I can do, to help Draco.”
After speaking to Cho Chang, Harry ended up getting sick. He rested alone in Crabbe’s old bed, sleeping his way through most of the days. Harry was provided food by the ever helpful Dobby, a liberated former House Elf who Harry considered to be a friend. A flawed one, but a friend nonetheless. Harry promised that he would spend some time with Dobby when he wasn’t sick, which the elf greatly appreciated.
Sirius continued to stare at Harry for a few seconds, but then nodded. “Sure, uh, alright, yeah. I will teach you how to become an animagus, if you want.” He was quiet for another few seconds before he continued. “Sorry. I… I shouldn’t have made assumptions, I guess.”
“I have not been informed of this alteration,” Severus said as he paced. “Naturally, I knew of the attempted break in due to Narcissa’s sharing of it with me, but I have not been told of this amendment. The Dark Lord spoke of the Malfoys task to the people in the manor yet he neglected to explain it.” He paused as he attempted to think of why that was, and appeared to come to a conclusion. “Lucius recently returned to the manor and I have been preoccupied with the wounded. I have likely not been informed because Narcissa has not been able to speak to me. I should think that the Dark Lord constructed such a situation to make certain that it didn’t reach me. I will likely not be allowed any privacy with Narcissa like this.”
