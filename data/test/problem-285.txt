“I wouldn’t find it difficult in the slightest.” Draco’s heart skips a beat and involuntarily he leans into Harry. “Although I do have a very expensive camera if you ever care to put my resolve to the test.”
“Draco Malfoy.”
“Is it weird?” Harry pushes a hand through his hair and pulls a face. “I’m not sure I’d like going over to some bloke’s house and seeing a load of pictures of me from the

“Theory will never prepare you as thoroughly as a spell.”
when you spend a significant amount of time thinking about taking your pal to bed and doing all manner of filthy things with them.
Draco feels now isn’t a good time to mention that buying early shares in Centaurs was one of his best investment decisions. “How can business be expected to pick up if nobody knows this is even here.”
“I never knew,” Harry says, miserably. “I didn't know who either of them were, not really.”
Potter said nothing, but Draco wasn’t bothered by the silence, not when his life sometimes seemed anything but.
Draco’s throat gets tight as he remembers the dispassionate piece of parchment, delivered by official Ministry owl. The pictures in the
The strains of music filter into the space around them and Harry tips his head, listening. The smile on his face widens. “I’ve been speaking to the DJ. I wanted them to play a song, that’s why I came looking for you.”
~ LLAP115
Draco gives Harry a minute to calm himself, not making any sudden movements. “We’re fine. It’s just like Black’s diary said.”
“If I go, I can’t come back from that.”
When he sat up and made contact with another face, Draco let out a startled scream.
“You like a mystery. Well, people are complex and as mysterious as they get. Figure out Black before you condemn him, that’s all I’m saying.”
The redcaps had been a breeze, the hinkypunks were nothing, the differences between an animagus and a werewolf were simple and beginning defencive spells were memorized; the only thing left to tackle was the Boggart.
As the volume of the music increases, Draco takes in the names of the bars long-since abandoned, with chipboard over the windows and heavy metal locks on the doors. Madame Jojo’s, The Black Cap, The Joiner’s Arms, Candy Bar, Barcode and Area. Draco tries to picture what Little Compton Street might have been like at its prime, whenever that was. According to Black’s diaries the place was thriving back in the seventies. The ghostly air to the abandoned buildings intensifies, emphasised by the way the music from some unknown venue curls and twists around them both as they make their way swiftly towards the promise of people.
“I know who I want to be,” Draco admitted, eyes on the table. “I also know who I don’t want to be.”
—that had to count.
his friend.
Draco hummed curiously, he was not used to someone looking out for him—besides Dobby.
“That doesn’t explain anything. I’m sure half the students today knew their fear and faced it anyway.”
“Master Draco.”
Draco closed his eyes when Moody raised his wand. Perhaps it was cowardice, but he couldn’t do it—couldn’t watch the life leave the spider.
“He already faces backlash, how is this any different?”
Regulus’ mouth parted and an inaudible noise left his mouth.
When Dobby said nothing, Draco frowned.
Harry stands and gives her a hug. “I was wondering where you were.”
“For learning how to not be a bigoted blood purist? No. I don’t deserve praise for learning how to be a decent human being.”
“Not as busy as the weekend.” The man leans forward. “Haven’t seen you around here before. Harry Potter isn’t it?”
Potter smile was bright and beautiful. It was exactly the kind of sight he needed after the day he had.
“Do you know much about Black?” Potter asked, suspicion in his tone.
Draco shrugs. “No idea. I haven’t a clue how to use it properly and I have no one to message. From what I can gather, it’s also completely out of date. I can make a phone call if I need to, and that’s about all I do with it.”
“You said I was set in stone, but
“You have
When Draco found out that Potter was wearing green robes, he charmed his own black and silver robes to entwine with green threads. It wouldn’t be noticeable to many, but he hoped Potter would get the significance.
“It feels like I am,” Draco whispered, not looking back as he continued forward, wondering if the rest of his path would be like this.
“Not really.” Paul shrugs. “One or two at St Mungo’s. The main ones helping are Muggle-born, but we’re still miles behind. If it wasn’t for the Muggles giving us access to all their information and treatment, we’d have lost a lot more and we’d still be losing them. The problem hasn’t disappeared, but the Muggle treatments have changed everything and they're getting better all the time.”
That, Draco could get behind. He pulled Neville into a tight hug.
, Draco thinks, pushing through the crowd in the hope that Harry hasn’t Apparated.
“People won’t get it.”
Instead of taking his usual path along the Strand to the coffee shop he and Harry still frequent, Draco ends up in Little Compton Street. It seems like years since he and Potter first discovered the Soho Bookshop, with its neon signs, sex toys and magazines. He picks up a copy of
“You wanted to see me, Headmistress?” said Severus, looking around at all the students. His eyes lingered on Neville who was still trying to fight off the hold on him, before they settled on Draco.
Paul takes a breath before continuing and Draco notices his hands are shaking, as he clasps them together. “For all we think we’re the bees’ knees with our magic and clever spells, our lot wouldn’t put time, money or resources towards any of it. We didn’t even get postscripts in the
“Get off me,” Draco ordered, knowing full well that Neville didn’t do anything he didn’t want to.
“I think you should save your admiration for those that never had to change.”
“Lucky, that.” Draco puts the photograph back and turns to face Harry. “Did you just put that up for tonight?”
“I can think of worse things to be turned into. Like a
Draco mindlessly listened to Neville as he locked eyes with Lovegood. He wasn’t sure what it was that she knew, but it was obvious that she was aware of something others weren’t.
“It’s not,” Draco said firmly. “I used to accompany my father when he would go to the Hall of Prophecies and my mother’s maiden name is Black. The only Black that has a prophecy is Arcturus Black, who died prematurely at 58, one day after the prophecy was made.”
“That doesn’t even make sense,” Black complained. “We aren’t duelling anything.”
So when Greengrass entered the common room crying, he assumed it was about her studies.
“You will
Dobby looked down before slowly extending his hands.
Draco snorted as Dobby tried to explain it away. “Sure, that logic is sound, but it’s not realistic. People would notice if Potter wasn’t here. Not to mention Dumbledore would have gone looking for him.”
Eventually the rain becomes too much and Draco ducks under the awning by a newsagent on Fleet Street, retracting his brolly and shaking off the worst of the water. When he was convinced to buy the thing at Pickett, the long cherry wood handle and plain black canvas seemed elegant and pleasing. Now, using his umbrella as a stick to rest against, it feels too much like his father’s cane.
There was no time to prepare as his lap was full of a panting Neville.
Draco pretends that invitation doesn’t send a thrill of pleasure through him and he keeps his features carefully blank. “Do try to control your fetish for blonds when we’re inside, Potter.”
“I’m teaching myself,” Draco whispered to change the subject. “Hard to do, but I’ll get there—eventually.”
If he wanted people to stop seeing his father first when they looked to him, then he needed to give them a reason not to. Draco needed to show them who he was.
Draco didn’t think Patronuses were sentient, but the monkey’s head bobbed in a way that resembled a nod. He felt warmth near the monkey, a warmth that felt like being embraced in Neville’s hugs. He wanted to keep the Patronus.
Potter’s face was red, but unseeing as he stared at the front of the room past Moody, hands clenched on the desk.
It would be madness to think it could be anything else.
A frustrated growl left Potter. “What kills me is everything I felt during the memory. I have never felt sorry for Snape, ever, but he didn’t deserve that. I don’t like feeling empathy for him, but yet I am. I hate that.”
Harry seems more than happy to oblige.
As Draco sighed, he realized he was still staring at Potter. Usually, Potter tended to glare—something Draco loved to see; anger simmering in Potter’s eyes was always something that could lift his mood—but Potter wasn’t glaring. No, there was open curiosity there, and he wasn’t sure what to do with it.
In one, heart-stopping push, Harry fucks into Draco without any holding back. It’s
Was it necessary to have a decree that named her as the Headmistress—as if anyone could
“And I noticed that a few people approached you too, which I get. I had to ask Neville if you said yes to any of them. After he stopped laughing at me—which is rather rude—I found out that you said no. Which I guess is a good thing, although that has me nervous because—”
“You won’t,” Harry says. His voice is sure and confident, his fingers warm on Draco’s shoulder. His voice thickens, and he speaks softly. “It’s your dad. It’s okay to miss him.”
“Yeah.” Settled with a cup of tea, sitting in one of Draco’s leather armchairs, Harry finally stops coughing. “It’s a load of bollocks.”
When his muscles continued to spasm, but no further pain came, he tried to gather the strength to raise his head.
He waited until Dumbledore was gone before he looked back to Potter.
“You’re an insufferable romantic.” Draco’s voice is thick with sleep. It doesn’t escape his notice that Harry takes a moment to cast a none too surreptitious glance at Draco’s body as his eyes flutter closed.
Draco shudders at the thought of Potter getting his grubby paws on Draco’s diary. Not least because of the unfortunate chapter in fourth year when Draco had clearly taken leave of his senses.
“I’ll want to do it again, though.”
Neville loved his parents, and he was sure if things had turned out differently, they would have loved Neville with everything they had.
He smiled as he thought to all of Regulus’ letters and the repeated emphasis on being who he wanted to be.
Neville’s offended gasp had Draco’s shoulders shaking as he tried not to laugh.
“A baby got rid of him.”
“Night.” Draco opens his mouth to ask about next Wednesday, but it seems odd to do so. They have never made formal plans to meet before and doing so now feels like breaking an unspoken code. Draco doesn’t want the fragile, fledgling thing between them to disappear with the sunrise, so he says nothing at all.
“Particularly if you struggle to type
Dobby frowned before placing his hands on his hips. “Most house elves don’t want change.”
“I don’t have trouble with that.” Harry sounds slightly croaky. “I don’t have trouble with that at all.” He leans in towards Draco, his voice low. “Let’s say—hypothetically—that you were with someone who liked the sound of that but hadn’t had that sort of experience before. How would you, um, want it?”
Potter smiled sadly as he looked at Draco. “Anything you want.”
“So you
Draco looked into Dobby’s eyes, hating that his vision became blurry. “You’re enslaved to the family. There’s no free will in anything you do. What I saw as a friendship was nothing more than me taking advantage of your kindness. Every action you take is ordered by wizards. That’s not okay, and I’ve contributed to your fate.”
“That’s acceptable,” Neville grumbled as he straightened his robes. “Wise and charming would have been preferred, but I’ll take what I can get.”
The classroom door opened and they all whipped around rapidly, hands trying to pull out wands.
He wanted to tell Potter that he was perfectly fine, wanted to snark him, wanted to tease back, but he didn’t have the energy. His knee made contact with the rough feel of wood and it was enough for Draco to reach forward and hold onto it as he sat down gingerly.
“Alright,” Granger said as she stood up straighter. “Let’s do this.”
“Prat.” He hated how fond his voice was when it came to Potter.
Draco’s childhood might not have been a good one, might not have been preferable, but it was one that he wouldn't change.
“Do you? We haven’t even seen him in months.”
of agreement, Harry pushes a finger slowly inside Draco. It’s blissfully good, even though he hasn’t actually done much yet. At the moment he seems content just to work his finger into Draco and drive him absolutely mad with wanting. His cock is already swollen and leaking at the tip, jutting against his stomach. The insistent press of Harry's cock against his side is the hard, thick promise of another time.
Potter’s voice startled Draco as he blinked up, eyes stinging.
Draco snorted and tried to wave his hand in an apology when Black glared at him.
“Ginny.” Potter finishes his own dessert and drains the last of his beer. “Coffee?”
Draco closed his eyes as he relaxed further into the chair.
“I got that.” Harry sounds like he’s smiling. He brushes his lips on Draco’s shoulder. “I don’t think I’d be too into fisting either. I'd worry about cocking something up and hurting you. Nice idea, though.”
“Sometimes it depends on the maturity level of your magical core.”
There had never been any question, not really. Draco hated that his own self-preservation seemed to disappear when Potter was involved.
As far as first kisses went, Draco had nothing to compare it to, but when Potter’s lips touched his own, he might have gasped, or maybe it was a sigh—possibly all in his head.
, you can fuck off.”
“Probably had a nightmare about shagging Potter,” came Theo’s amused retort.
Potter grins. “That’s true.” He taps his phone with his finger. “Now we’re text buddies that might change.”
Draco snorted harshly. “Merlin no. Why do you think I learned it in the first place?”
Draco watched Neville place a hand to his chin and couldn’t help but appreciate the change in their friendship. Sure, it was clear that Neville still thought she was madder than all could be, but at least he was listening.
“Fine.” Draco shakes off the rush of panic and steadies himself. “Where’s this Muggle flat of yours then?”
“But that doesn’t make any—” Draco narrowed his eyes when Dobby’s ears wiggled. Large eyes blinked innocently, and his mouth was relaxed, but Draco knew the ears were a tell.
Draco didn’t wait for Potter to respond before he pulled the available chair next to him and helped Dobby climb up.

A shaky breath left Draco as he sat down in a nearby chair gingerly.
that. Funny how that works.”
Lupin stood up straighter, indignation taking root. “Mister Malfoy, if you are trying to threaten me—”
A loud bang from the landing stirred Harry from his wondering. "Potter," Draco called out from above, "I require your assistance."
to remind Harry of the first time they discovered a whole new world. In some ways, Draco thinks of that as the start. In others, today feels like the real beginning.
Dobby was the one who watched him, the one who looked after him, the one who cared for him and the one who was there. The other house elves spent more time with him than his own parents. That wasn’t love, that was obligation.
A poke to his knee caused Draco to clear his throat.
“Thank fuck for that.”
photographs accompanying the article that gleefully outed him to the rest of the wizarding world.
“All we know is that only Harry made it out alive.”
“Not with the great Auror Potter to protect me.” Draco rolls his eyes. “You’re such an unbelievable cretin.”
“It’s raining.”
“I don’t want to be with anyone right now.”
“He doesn’t need to know,” Draco said to Madam Pomfrey, eyes pleading as he tried not to fidget on the hospital wing bed.
It wasn’t until he made it to the Slytherin table that he noticed Umbridge walking between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. He couldn’t tell what was being said, but he could infer from her rigid posture and Potter’s smile that it wasn’t anything good.
Draco waited until he knew it was just slightly past acceptable to enter his father’s study. He had been summoned an hour ago but hadn’t wanted to please his father.
Neville began grumbling petulantly as he stabbed his porridge. "It's like you
“That will never happen. The day I willingly talk to Snape about something not school related, or Dumbledore ordered, will be the day you become a Weasley.”
“So? Then don’t come back. Go forward.”
“And then the possibilities were there. I see him now, and part of me hates it.” He closed his eyes, as he hated being so open to someone he wasn’t sure he could trust. But she was Potter’s friend, and that mattered.
“I could fuck you for hours,” Draco says, only half aware he’s said it out loud.
Time meant nothing when it came to the curse. What could have been only one second felt much longer and it skewed reality.
It took several more attempts, six more memory changes and a full hour before Neville’s patronus retained some kind of shape.
Spew,” Granger argued as Weasley and Potter laughed.
The room had been his safe haven for so long; it had been the place of many conversations with Dobby, many games and tickle wars between them. His room had been lived in happily, despite the circumstances.
“They tend to allow other creatures to protect them, but at a cost.”
“Oh.” Harry stares at Draco. “Right.”
“Draco.”
“I think it’s just jealousy,” Draco continued, ignoring the warning glances Potter sent his way. “If you care so much about her dance partner, you should have asked her to be your date. I do think she would have said yes.”
“Do you want me to show you how to work the shower?” Harry gets a cheeky grin on his face that’s really more of a leer.
“Didn’t realise you were so concerned with my erections, Malfoy. Spend a lot of time thinking about them, do you?”
“I do my best,” Harry says, obviously pleased with himself. “I wouldn’t want you to turn into a gnome on my watch.”
Potter’s lips quirked slightly. “It’s been awhile since I’ve heard that.”
When there was no response, Draco knew it was Dobby’s way of humouring him. But denial was the only thing he could believe in. It was the only way he could see a bright future for the both of them.
being flipped, the soft noises of shuffling and a few interested noises, he wondered if Potter could change their minds as well.
. Merlin forbid they could even have this in common.
When Kreacher’s eyes narrowed, Draco couldn’t stop the smile on his face from forming.
Granger smiled sadly as she clutched the tin can to her chest.
a role model, just not in the way one would expect. Every major life lesson had been something Regulus taught him. He had learned who he wanted to be and what he didn’t want to become through the letters. Regulus had shaped everything, had changed so much.
“Prophecies can only be touched by those who they are about,” Draco explained in a rush when Potter looked upset. “My father can’t touch the one made about my grandfather. It doesn’t matter that he is his next of kin. The spells protect against it.”
“I think so.” Draco looks around Little Compton Street, resisting the urge to give the
Food Fair Funk it up
The letter was a bit of a mess and it showed what kind of stress Regulus had been under. He wanted to know more, wanted to know what the Dark Lord had planned all those years ago, wanted to know what had captured his interest. The letters weren’t dated, so Draco had no way of knowing how close it was to when Regulus disappeared.
“Jolly good.”
Potter scoffed. “You
“My father promised the Dark Lord that I would serve him.”
Draco had forgotten all about the conversation with Harry in The Sundowner and his plan to go to the clinic on Dean Street for a check-up. That must have been Harry’s mysterious appointment. Draco types back a quick response.
He took one last look around the room before he shut the door for the last time.
sort. The kind to marry an accountant and adopt babies. It’s unsettling to think of Potter having casual sex and enjoying it. The knowledge that he might have a trick or two up his sleeve makes Draco unbearably warm and intensifies his interest in the smallest things Potter does. Every flex of Potter’s fingers sends Draco’s mind to places it has no business going. The way he pushes his jumper up to the elbows to reveal tanned skin and the smattering of dark hair on his forearms makes Draco’s mouth dry. He is irrationally, impossibly jealous of every Muggle who has had the pleasure of seeing Potter on his knees.
Unless that’s what he wanted?
Most students were craning their necks to discover who the other champions had brought, so Draco was able to get by without much effort.
“Potter.”
The end of the year was a lot better than Draco expected. He could procrastinate it all, possibly even pretend everything was fine as long as he didn’t have to face a Boggart any time soon.
“How does young Master Malfoy know that?”
“At first, he just wanted someone to talk to, someone to listen to him. Regulus made a lot of mistakes, and he didn’t have anyone to tell it to.”
“They’re after Muggles,” Draco explained unnecessarily as he gestured to the scene past the trees. “Believe me, they aren’t going to care that you are a Witch.”
“He’s changed already.” Harry’s body is warm against Draco’s and unexpectedly his hand finds Draco’s leg under the table, squeezing briefly before returning to his cider. “I think we both have.”
“I’ve been a right prat,” Weasley said quietly, a tinge of sadness overtaking his tone.
“He’s not—”
“There’s a lot of vague details, but the standard belief is that he’s dead. I’m asking you if that’s true.”
Being wrong didn’t automatically make being right easier.
When a cold laugh reverberated around the room, Draco snapped his eyes up in horror to see his father approach. He couldn’t help the shiver that escaped as the Boggart version sneered.
“You’re the one that was saying my name in your sleep,” Harry informs him. “That’s creepier.”
, but I found that one the other day. I liked the picture, so I cut it out and kept it. It’s, like, a placeholder. Until we get a better one.”
“What about the kitchen?” Black offered as he pushed open the door.
“At the flat.” Harry lets out a low
Draco shrugs. “I don’t know, Potter. You’re not exactly forthcoming with the truth these days.”
“We don’t have VIPs.” A gorgeous blond—Justin, presumably—gives Draco a suspicious look. It’s only when he clocks Potter that his eyes go wide, his voice getting breathy. “I heard, but I didn’t believe it. Hi, handsome.” Justin smiles at Harry, brighter than the sun. “If you want a private tour later, I’m very good at those. I’ll give you access anywhere you want, darling.”
“And it’s not like I needed the push, really, I would have done it on my own.”
Harry’s cheeks take on a delightful pink tinge and he clears his throat. He licks his lips and his eyes flick over Draco. “If you wanted to do it we can. Shower, that is. Together.”
“I don’t care what they’d say.” Harry’s jaw works, and he gives Draco a challenging look. “Do you?”
Draco refuses to confront the spike of jealousy that flattens his mood. It’s as if he’s been doused with a bucket of iced water. Hearing Potter is out at Shed makes him think of Tom and Potter’s
“I know enough of it to know what it contains,” Draco replies.
He tried not to let that get to him, tried not to care that his father would never care about him, but it stung—hurt more than he cared to admit.
is already describing as too vocal, too opinionated, too
“Oh, did they?” Augusta asked as she moved over to Frank. “I’ll just say my goodbyes, then.”
“You seem confident,” Draco said as he held the strap of his bag tighter.
“The bunny didn’t survive.”
Fred and George wrapped an arm around him and sandwiched him between them.
“I’m sorry I was an idiot in school.”
Harry lifts a hand almost subconsciously to his forehead, before adopting a duelling stance as if he might have to do something to stop Draco from bursting into flames. “Go on, then. Do it. See what happens.”
“Nothing.”
“You certainly act like it,” Theo said as he breezed into the room and sat on the couch with a grace expected of him.
Potter narrows his eyes. “How expensive?”
“Are you messing with me?”
"Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle anyway?" Pansy yelled, hands cupped over her mouth. "Why would anyone want to look like they have worms on the top of their head?"
“Afternoon.” The attractive waiter gives Draco a broad smile and grabs a menu, gesturing in front of him. “Usual table?”
. Was it easy for Regulus because he made mistakes? Was it easy to be righteous once wrong? Or was it hard to be wrong? Was there bravery in admitting one’s flaws?
Dobby’s behaviour turned strange as the summer went on. Draco watched him whenever he was able to, and he couldn’t figure out what the problem was. Sure, he could ask, but Dobby could be sly when needed—something Draco was rather proud of.
“We both have been pushed in directions we don’t want,” said Draco with a shrug.
. The stretch is just the right kind of painful and the sudden rush of being forcefully filled is everything Draco has been craving since he first set eyes on Harry Potter in that coffee shop. Harry’s hands are hard and firm on Draco’s hips and the magic in the room around them is unmistakably theirs. Even though Draco can’t see Harry’s face, he can feel him. The leather from Harry’s bracelet rubbing against his skin, the cool silver ring, the hum of his magic. Every breath and grunt is uniquely Harry, and Draco’s heart beats in staccato rhythm with every push and pull.
too strong to ignore.
think or if it's what you've been
A commotion drew their attention to Lupin standing in front of Potter as a white orb became the Boggart’s shape.
Draco couldn’t have been more enthused at the prospect.
“You’re not the only one.” Draco gives his shirt an experimental sniff and pulls a face at the scent of cigarettes, sweat and booze. A cleaning charm would do the job, but it’s not the same as a proper bath or shower. There’s nothing like washing away the grime of a long night. Draco likes the water just on the cusp of too hot, tipping his face into the stream of water and letting the heat, steam and powerful jets massage away the voices in his head that don’t always quieten down.
“Yes. Stop changing the subject. You took your ex-fiancée to a gay bar?” The Weaslette seems clever enough not to marry someone with no interest in her, so he can’t imagine why she would be interested in flogging a dead horse. Perhaps Potter took her to a gay bar to make a point.
Potter smiled slightly. “I’m not very good at dancing, I think we only did well because we never did the waltz.”
Weasley let out a curse and Granger looked close to tears, but Draco was only confused.
That didn’t bode well for humanity, but Draco knew she was right. History
Draco sat on the log he liked to think was his as he stared at the Black Lake. It was difficult to find time to do nothing, what with the increased homework load and the extra care he had to put into studying. If Umbridge was a competent teacher, he wouldn’t have to study as hard.
Draco snorts. “Twats.”
“Yeah.” Harry rubs his forehead. “But what if it isn’t? I just took his word for it and I didn’t even know his last name. I’m an Auror for fucks sake, I don’t just trust what people tell me without doing my own investigations. I’m such a twat.”
Draco wasn’t sure where ‘there’ was, but Potter’s face was twisted in pain and that had him opening his mouth to apologize.
When Draco walked into his father’s study, he tried not to flinch at the sneer that was already in place.
Blue eyes regarded Draco closely, but he had never been able to read Dumbledore very well.
“It’s not some crazy article done by the
“So, little Malfoy—” they ignored his grumbled complaints. “—we have created our very own brand of Fireworks.”
Before Draco could respond, Dobby turned to him with a serious expression as his ears drooped.
Draco bites back a groan and pushes Harry onto the bed, straddling him. He rocks over Harry’s cock as it hardens beneath him.
The surprise vanished as horror filled Draco. He hadn’t needed the mental picture.
As a few students rose to Lupin’s defence, Umbridge switched tactics and went after Moody.
Except give the Dark Lord what he wanted.
“And what changed your mind?” He refused to let warmth fill him at Neville’s words.
, Potter. No tender lovemaking. Get me inside, slam the door behind us and fuck me until I can’t remember my own name.”
“You’re rather quiet, Mr Malfoy,” McGonagall remarks. Fuck. So much for Draco not getting a lecture.
Draco splutters at the impertinence of questions. “I don’t need to know anything about
“Blimey. It’s you.” The barman stares at Harry, his eyes flicking up to Harry’s forehead where his scar is, as ever, covered by his messy tangle of hair. “Harry bleedin’ Potter.”
“Mm.” Harry sounds as though he isn’t capable of much else, hissing as he bucks into Draco’s fist. His body is hot and hard in Draco’s lap, his cock truly spectacular. If Draco hadn’t just had a first-class orgasm, he would be salivating over the thought of being fucked by Harry. It’s been a while since he’s bothered to chase after the delicious stretch of someone deep inside him, and his mind wanders to letting Harry take him with sure, confident ease.
“Change isn’t exclusive,” Draco continued. “It
Friend… such a complex concept. Being there for someone was as scary as allowing them in. He wasn’t sure he could do it.
Voices could be heard, but neither moved. Draco lowered his head till it was resting on Neville’s shoulders.
“Statistics prove you are more likely to follow his behaviour.”
The dog looked to Draco before slowly inching forward to sniff his hands.
Draco looked to Alpsi, wishing the sting of Dobby’s absence didn’t hurt.
Draco glared at the ground before he schooled his features into a blank mask as he looked up at his father.
And he wanted Potter.
Potter cleared his throat, but before he could say anything, a flutter of wings had them looking up in time to see an owl land in front of Draco.
Part of him wanted to scoff and throw away the letter on instinct. It seemed so easy for others to give an opinion. As if being told his parents beliefs were wrong—as if Draco didn’t already know that—was something he could just ignore and do the opposite.
“You are something else, Longbottom. Sappiest Gryffindor I’ve ever encountered.”
“He comes to me to teach me the lessons you have taught him.”
Harry pats his stomach and grins at Draco. “And they serve chips.”
True to his word, Draco isn’t holding a banner, largely because he doesn’t want to lug something around Diagon Alley. He would prefer to hold Potter’s hand, because he can’t shake the way everything has a fleeting, surreal quality to it, the memory of discovering dusty shops and the echoes of angels on Little Compton Street. He has a picture in his mind, so sharp and vivid, of Sirius Black and James Potter kissing to Bowie and wonders if they’re here too, somewhere, watching the group of misfits about to take their first steps forward. He can’t take Harry’s hand though, because he’s clutching onto his banner with one and using the other to show off a clever rainbow spell he’s been practicing. The sparks and bright lights from his wand surround those nearby in cascading, rainbow-bright colours that mingle with the rain. The reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues and violets bleed into the puddles on the street, until everything shines with the hues of a hundred different rainbows.
Draco pulls a face. “That’s quite presumptuous.”
“Said he escaped Azkaban.”
tend to be intimidating? What about you?”
“When were you in New York?” Draco stares at Potter. He’s always wanted to go to New York, but it’s always felt like the kind of place to go to with someone else. Besides, he would have to visit Pansy if he went there and he’s been avoiding her for a while, for reasons he chooses not to examine too closely.
What had surprised him was his father’s reaction to the papers. It was as if he was pleased. Draco couldn’t help but wonder why that might be. Wouldn’t the Dark Lord be upset that the world wasn’t taking the possibility of his return seriously?
“That’s fair,” Charlie mused. “But damn, let me at least be disappointed that I’ll lose one of my most promising trainees.”
As the flush darkened, Draco felt his own cheeks heat up.
“I hope you are right,” Weasley whispered. “If not, I’m not sure how he’ll let us know about Sirius.”
Draco’s mouth parted in surprise; something he wasn’t proud of. As whispers and angry cries broke out across the great hall, he only had eyes for Potter.
“I used my brain, Weasley.”
The longer Draco stayed silent, the worse his anxiety got. Speaking would only anger his father, but not to do so would also raise the ire. It was a no-win situation—it always was.
“So,” Neville began in a tone that had Draco wishing he was anywhere else. “Harry was asking about you.”
to Draco. In many ways, Regulus had taught Draco the most important life lessons, the ones he would take with him, always.
You cannot! Merlin, they don't mean it literally in the song!"
Granger looked between them, brows furrowing with each word they spoke.
Draco acknowledged that with a tilt of his head. Potter had a point. “Perhaps this will be the path you need. Or maybe it’s the one you will wish you hadn’t gone down.”
“I wasn’t entirely sure you would say yes,” continued Potter. “You tend to be intimidating.”
“You don’t do that anymore?” Harry seems curious, as if he hasn’t had many of these conversations before.
“Statistics show that wizards and witches who are predominantly Dark in their magic can’t produce a patronus past a wispy puff of silver.”
“This one counts as double.” Draco meets Harry’s eyes, which spark with mirth. “After this, game’s over.”
“But I’ll allow that to be one on one, alright?” Lupin asked hand briefly coming up as if to comfort before it fell. “No other student will see your Boggart.”
McGonagall gives him a sharp look. “Come, now, Mr Potter. I don’t keep my private life a secret because I’m ashamed of it. Wil has been to countless balls and events with me, I just doubt you ever paid much mind. My private affairs are such because I’m a private person. You would know little more of my business if I had the misfortune to find myself married to a man.”
Was that what Regulus meant? To build up others? Was mere friendship the answer? Or did it go further than that? Was Draco meant to build up those who looked down on him? That was asking a lot, and he wasn't sure he could do that.
“And people you care about.”
“Thank you, for what you did back there.”
“Your turn to ask a question,” Draco says. Thinking about the choices he made since the war is almost as depressing as thinking about the choices he made during it.
“You get letters a lot.”
“I might be a bad friend,” he finally said, not able to look at Longbottom anymore.
Dobby nodded his head, wincing when magic once again encased his body, only this time the flames were drastically smaller.
“I was! I wasn’t going to hide it.”
“I don’t know why I bother.” Harry rolls his eyes. “Once a twat, always a twat.”
.” Harry glares at Draco. “Can you not talk about my dad giving head to my godfather?”
“Yes. I use condoms. Not for oral, even though I probably should. Nobody seems to, so I just never did. I don’t sleep with many wizards largely because they don’t want to sleep with me, but on the rare occasion I use protective spells.” Draco’s stomach clenches. He knows nothing is insurmountable now, but even the thought of Potter having a common cold doesn’t sit well with him. He wants Harry well and vibrant, annoying Draco with his poorly spelled texts and his broad smile. “Aren’t you?”
him?”
“Yeah.” Harry kisses Draco back and it nearly turns into something, before Draco pulls away reluctantly. He slides his hands over Harry’s waist, down to his hips and up again. He doesn’t want to stop touching Harry. He wants to stretch out on a bed with him and really take his time, but it’s going to have to wait.
“I know.”
He looked around the Great Hall and wasn’t surprised to see most of the students scrounging for a neighbour who might have the
When his father stood up, Draco had to look away, already knowing what was to come.
“Yeah.” Potter smiled as he rubbed the back of his neck. “See you around, Malfoy.”
Something in Potter’s voice caused Draco to peer up at him.
“Do you want a mate?”
, Greg. I don’t care if you get on with Weasley, you should be friends with him. We all need friends.”
“You think it was true?”
“I see you’ve talked to Granger.”
Weasley grunted, as if that was a significant use of language.
“Thank you.”
Draco shakes his head, wondering if Harry thinks that’s what Draco’s been doing. Technically it’s his friends that have been doing the running, but Draco was happy to let them. He let owls pass unanswered, allowed Fire Calls to become harder to schedule until they were infrequent and, finally, stopped happening at all. When his friends did return to England to see family or otherwise, Draco made no attempt to welcome them back. Staying static in the same old country pile, with the same owl—Aristotle has lived for an absurd length of time—and keeping up his daily routine of walking in the London rain, is a form of distancing himself from his past. It’s not running. It’s exactly the opposite of
“Telling other people.” Draco puts down his coffee and folds his hands in front of him. “I wouldn’t want to give Weasley a heart-attack or for Granger to have you committed.”
“No,” Potter returned just as quietly. “
“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to
“What if he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon.”
“Potter… he’s something I never planned for. My life has been crumbling for a while, and then Potter came in with his subtle jabs and our lakeside conversations as if he belonged there. I’ve never known what I wanted when it came to him, never really thought about it until it was right in my face.”
“No,” Severus shook his head slowly. “The Dark Lord liked to make examples of those who fled. Regulus wouldn’t have been any different.”
“Hermione,” Ron said slowly, furrowed brows and frown present. “She came with Krum, didn’t you see?”
“I think you are just biased.” Draco looked to the ground as his face pinked up.
It feels like progress.
“Malfoy was never the heir,” Potter argued. “That much is clear.”
“Dobby will always be there for Draco—Draco is Dobby’s best friend.”
As he rounded the corner and caught sight of large eyes, he let out a little noise of relief.
Draco closed his eyes as he took one mental step down the path he
. A quote from a book Draco can’t quite recall, by a man whose name he doesn’t remember. The air is full of them. The angels of Little Compton Street. The spirits whose laughter catches on the breeze, whose echoes slide through the cracks of the brickwork and disturb the dust on empty floors. There's a sense of a party left unfinished, an abandoned dancefloor with the DJ still playing. It's as though the narrow street would soon buzz with people again, if only someone switched on the right song. It’s unbelievable how a street which is so decidedly empty can feel so full.
“Is the bar set that low?” Potter returned, a smile already taking over.
“Have something to say, Mister Malfoy?” The tone itself was a warning, that much was clear, but Draco couldn’t stop himself.
The thought of his friends brings Draco back to another question that’s been playing on his mind since it first came up in Sage & Thyme. “Why did you go to New York?”
“Regulus,” Draco whispered, eyes closing. No. It was fake. He knew that, understood that he had to fight back, but it was hard.
“But if he really does have Sirius, then I can’t do nothing,” Potter mumbled quietly.
Black snorted before it turned into full-on laughter as he doubled over.
“Not to worry, dear. I’m sure your father will be pleased to hear you are alright.”
When Potter didn’t continue, Draco urged him with a hand.
His hair was teased up messily and he'd darkened the roots. A loose braid wove around his crown. His face looked more pale than usual in the low light, and the setting sun accented the crimson flush high on his cheekbones. His silvery eyes shimmered like molten metal and they were rimmed in dark grey liner; his lashes were lengthened and darkened with mascara; his lips curved upward in a smouldering smirk.
. It’s something about the strangeness of finding a new magical place that feels like something out of a dream. The hazy, booze-soaked kisses and the endless night that ran on for hours.
Several students laughed derisively, but that only seemed to spur Granger’s resolve further.
He wished he could have met Regulus, even just once.
Draco pulled Dobby into a hug, amused by the surprised squeak that was released. “I missed you too.”
She looked at him expectantly when he said nothing. Her smile dimmed, and she began to rifle through her drawers.
to him more.
“Circling each other, the stares, the teasing, the flirting, the stares, the conversations.”
Potter cocked his head to the side as he regarded Draco closely. “Do you know Occlumency? Is that why you are okay without the lesson?”
When Draco looked at his father, he thought he would see anger or perhaps his eyes would have shown a plea, a plea for him to do as the Dark Lord wished. But as Draco looked at his father, the only thing he saw was recognition.
, I was being polite, you dickhead.” Harry’s hands ball into fists and he glares right back at Draco. “Were you just planning to fuck off and blow someone in the loos while I was getting gawped at by everyone on the dancefloor?”
“You are?” Greg looks curious. “I’ve not heard about that.”
“Maybe in a perfect world. A world with no strife or horrible people.”
“Oh!” Dobby clapped his hands excitedly. “
The path that would define his future was shaping with each decision Draco made, and he knew that this would be a large stone, one that would leave a layout for the rest.
“You shouldn’t.” Draco shook his head quickly. “Not when it comes to me. Other people? Maybe. But not me.”
“Aside from the fact it’s all true, apart from the bit about my sex dungeon and Weaslette’s traumatic heartbreak.” Draco pours himself a coffee and watches Aristotle swoop around the study, before settling on a stack of books. “What do you want to do about it?”
Kreacher rushed forward and nearly tackled Draco to the floor as he hugged him tightly.
“Not all of it, no.” Potter laughs under his breath.
“You are going to explain this to me at some point,” Draco warned Potter.
“But seriously?” Potter began. “I can tell the difference when Neville takes a spell I taught him and then goes to you for further practice or help.”
“You can’t read that in here.” Draco snatches the paper from Potter, looking around for Muggles wondering why the fuck the pictures on Potter’s paper are waving at them.
“Malfoy—”
Draco wasn’t sure what to expect for his first Care of Magical Creature lesson, but what he got wasn’t it. Hagrid had never exactly had his confidence, but he was open to trying. Mostly.
“I didn’t ask that, actually.” Harry picks up a box with a slim p-stim toy in it. Unlike Draco, he obviously made his way straight to the butt-plugs, dildos and other assorted toys. Typical Gryffindor; absolutely no subtlety at all. “I asked if you’d ever tried one. I didn’t ask if you were alone or not. You could have used it on someone else.”
When Draco made it to Care of Magical Creatures and noticed Umbridge with a clipboard, he couldn’t help but groan. It was bad enough having to see her for Defence Against the Dark Arts, but during other lessons too?
“Is anyone trying now?” Draco asks.
Potter jerked his head in a rude gesture of a nod.
“Thank you,” Draco interrupted as he wiped his eyes. “Thank you for freeing him. I couldn’t do it, but you did, and I can’t stress how much that means to me.”
“Not quite so hungry anymore.” Harry shrugs and fiddles with one of the beer mats. “In a bit, maybe.”
Don't believe me just watch
harm Draco Malfoy!”
“Not really.” Harry shakes his head. “I’d lose everything that makes me who I am. I need to work out how to face up to everything that happened, though. The longer I try to put the memories in a box, the harder it is to keep them contained.”
His heart went through another round of palpitations at the question. “Not intentionally.”
Regulus’ eyes snapped onto Draco and a smirk so similar to Sirius’ had Draco groaning. He didn’t need to be teased by two members of the Black family.
“It would appear that you know how to run,” Draco whispered lowly, aware that Weasley was edging closer to them.
“Get on with it, will you?” Draco pushes back as the blunt head of Harry’s cock presses against his hole. The anticipation of Harry positioning himself and the slickness of the cold lube is almost a tease too far.
“Daddy says that your parents are searching for Umgubular Slashkitlers over the holidays.”
“It works both ways,” Draco says at last. “If we’re sticking together.”
“Enemy?” Draco asked as his brows arched. “Krum is the enemy? Enemy of what? He’s got a unibrow and off centered feet—I’ve seen kneazles with meaner dispositions.”
A slow smile formed on Draco’s face at the headline, he tucked the magazine in his robes before he thanked Lovegood.
“She sees things that aren’t there,” Potter added with an uneasy expression.
The crack of the apparition was loud as the sound echoed off the walls. Time didn’t slow as the Dark Lord raised his wand, time didn’t stop as his mouth opened to utter a spell.
Draco shrugged once, uncomfortable with the conversation altogether.
“You’ve never met me,” Draco began in a shaky tone that caused Regulus’ forehead to wrinkle. “But I know who you are.”
Draco hummed as he read the paper, eyes narrowing in thought. "Says Dumbledore didn't fill the position, no wonder they chose someone like her, then."
Potter gives Draco a sheepish smile. “What do you think? I wouldn’t say I’m not here because of you, not exactly.”
“Like what?”
“The temperature spells are beginning to wear off and the roof is leaking again. This is NOT a fallen-in country house where a bunch of owls found refuge. This is the Owl Post Owlery in Diagon Alley! It should be the finest in the country!”
Draco glares. “Hello to you too, Potter. What an unexpected pleasure.”
He narrowed his eyes at her explanation as his mind began to wander.
The tone had Draco confused, his grades were fine, great even.
been vulnerable—with Draco.
“When aren’t you worried?” Draco asked as he entwined their fingers.
“Is it bad?”
Surprisingly, Draco believed him.
“She isn’t much of a cook, not since she ate the last house elf.”
“You see, your brother Regulus wrote to me before he died.”
Draco’s foul mood isn’t improved by London’s rainy skies or the nervous anxiety that grips him as he makes his way to Sage & Thyme. He and Harry didn’t make any firm plans and Draco isn’t certain that Harry will even be there when he arrives. His Muggle phone has no new messages on it, and a niggling part of him wonders if something might have pushed Harry back into his pretty nearly-wife’s arms. It was Black’s diaries that led them to Little Compton Street, after all. Perhaps he read something about his father that made him decide to go back into the closet and give being everybody’s favourite heterosexual hero another shot. Despite the fact Harry hasn’t technically done anything wrong, Draco is increasingly angered by the time he gets to the coffee shop. His shoes are damp and won’t stop squelching after an annoying encounter with a puddle just by the Barbican, and he’s got a good mind to remind Potter about that umbrella he was supposed to be replacing. Next time he comes to meet Potter, he plans to Apparate—if there is a next time, that is.
Draco wasn’t sure who to answer first. He frowned down at Dobby. “I was going to lead up to that, you know.”
Observant eyes moved over Draco’s face before narrowing suspiciously.
There wasn’t much he knew about Lovegood. His father only had negative things to say about her father, but that was to be expected. Draco always did enjoy the
As he watched the genuine happiness on Neville’s face, Draco knew that Neville had been right. He might not have been lost if they had never been friends, but Draco would have missed out on the chance of having someone as wonderful as Neville in his life.
Why would those who face oppression harm those who know the same cruelty? Was it a part of society that Draco didn’t understand, or was it a part of a bigger issue that all stemmed back to the original oppressors?
“Yes. God,
“Nobody ever talked about HIV and AIDS in our world. Nobody in the Muggle government did for a long while either, but the Muggle press did. Oh, they had a lot to say and none of it good. Gay cancer, they used to call it. Like it was being gay that made you sick. Our lot never mentioned a thing, though. Not the Ministry, not the press, not St Mungo’s, nobody. Didn’t seem like our folks wanted to admit that something Muggle couldn’t be cured with magic. They didn’t want people to know there were as many of us in the wizarding world as the Muggle one and that half of our lot were out in the Muggle bars all the time anyway.”
“My Lord, I don’t think he knows—”
Harry’s eyes are still dark. “I’d say very well indeed,” he murmurs. “
“Where is Sirius, Kreacher?” Potter demanded.
“Christopher Street Inn, The Tavern, Rivera & Johnson, the Mayor and Miners, or…” Harry trails off, his wide smile fading. He swallows, and his voice is rough when he speaks again. “The Sundowner.”
“I never said there was.” Potter looks around for the waiter. “Are you having a coffee? I thought I might get cake.”
“If you aren’t his heart now, then you will be,” she continued, uncaring of his glare. “I’m just asking you to not hurt him.”
Draco closed his eyes before looking to Potter. “That diary you have, that belonged to my father.”
and you expect me to tell you whether I like toys up my arse?”
“But—”
Draco wasn’t sure how Neville became such a kind, caring person with a Grandmother like Augusta. He had watched her berate Neville for every minuscule thing she perceived as a wrongdoing, listened to her criticize his every move and then claim it was because she cared.
Growling pleasurably and deep in his throat, Draco withdrew his hand from under Harry's t-shirt. Harry heard the elastic slap of pants hurriedly shoved down, shortly followed by the frenetic strokes of Draco's hand on his own cock making soft sounds of friction on denim fabric.
. There’s nothing remotely troll-like about Potter, more’s the pity. Draco’s life would be a lot less complicated if Harry wasn’t quite so stupidly attractive.
“He might have asked me to the Yule Ball.”
“Do you stay in touch with anyone?” Potter asks.
on the cover in elegant, cursive script. “Oh, no.” Harry frowns at Draco. “You do know other people apart from Hermione can read, don’t you?”
. Still, it didn't stop him from committing every one of the lyrics to memory or humming the tune softly when he was alone enough for nobody to hear.
“Not really.” Draco pulls a face. “I can’t say I ever want to get married.” There’s a way marriage is talked about amongst pure-bloods with beliefs like his father, that makes Draco resentful of it. Not getting married is an act of defiance. A final
Draco tried to blend into the background, but unfortunately Pansy noticed him, and she loudly exclaimed, “Can you believe this, Draco? Granger here has started a club for house elves.”
“How about you all shut up,” Draco demanded.
“Fine.” Draco thinks for a minute. “Why are you on
Draco didn’t know what the future held for him. He didn’t know how his decision would shape the rest of his life, nor was he aware of any mistakes that might arise from it, but he did know that it had been worth it. Every doubt, every fear and every concern had paved his path. And he wouldn’t change a single thing.
“I contacted you!” Draco remembers writing a series of pathetic, hopeless owl when everything was going from bad to worse.
“Neither do you,” Draco points out. “Three seems excessive. Don’t try to pretend the fact I have money makes you better than me. You have connections to old money too. I’m fairly certain I give more to charity than you do, these days.”
Potter nodded as he took a step back and straightened up.
“I thought we weren't supposed to wait for each other.”
“I best be going,” Draco said, closing his cloak tighter around him. “It was nice talking to you, Potter.”
Draco wanted to hex Black as much as he wanted to thank him, perhaps that was a familial thing.
“You would do well to remember your
“Potter,” Draco breathed into Potter’s neck. “I was so worried about you.”
A bitter smile had Draco’s stomach lurching. “I don’t think it matters much what I want anymore.”
Well, why not? Why couldn’t Regulus have been given a shot? Someone so self-aware, and so willing to go the lengths in personal redemption,
seem to love to write about. The press can fuck off.
“And you have a non-corporeal patronus as it is, that’s still impressive. You’ve only been practicing for a few weeks.”
“Yes, thank you for that deduction, Remus. You are a peach as always.”
This name was chosen as an amalgamation of the names Jonathan Blake and Mark Ashton. Both were founding members of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners. Mark died from AIDS aged 26. Jonathan was one of the first men the UK to be diagnosed with HIV and after refusing several early treatments, he is still alive and remains heavily involved with activism today.
One wave of a wand and a dramatic flash of smoke later, Draco stared down at an outrageously large pile of fireworks. He picked up a large pink Catherine wheel and let out an impressive whistle—it was at least five feet in diameter.
When they pull apart, they’re both breathless.
“What’s going on?” Grumbled Blaise.
They would have time to talk, time to tell each other what had happened, time to explore things—
Paul’s grin fades and he squeezes his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Come on, now. You’ve done a lot already. There’s plenty more that would have died if it hadn’t been for you. You-Know-Who would have found Little Compton Street in the end and I can’t imagine it would have been pretty if he had.”
The banners are a brilliant, colourful assortment of political messages and charities and activist organisations that have come out of the, well, out of the closet, since the
Aristotle drops the
Black ignored Potter and chose to return to his conversation with Lupin.
He looked toward Draco, finding eyes full of silver lust and lips gently curving a smirk around the head of Harry's cock. Raising his own hand to the back of Draco's head, Harry gently guided Draco forward, seeking the wet warmth of his mouth once more.
. “I have overlooked your cowardice when I fell, overlooked your denunciation of our ways and my plans of the future.”
“You’re right, I don’t care.”
“I’m saying that whatever you do from now on, make sure it’s at your pace, and at your whim. Dumbledore is—” Draco grimaced as he tried to refrain from being judgmental. “He’s pretty rigid in his beliefs, probably a side effect of being old.”
. Draco wants that. The reminder that he’s alive, and all the little deaths he hopes to have before the big one. Draco has been walking through the rain for so long. It’s been forever since he has truly felt the heat of companionship. The last thing he wants to do now it feels like the sun is finally coming up is to dwell on death.
. What I like most is when I can top
“I think there has been a mistake,” Draco interrupted with a smile that he hoped came across as fake as it was. “You see, I didn’t want to join.”
“Pardon me?” A false high-pitched giggle was released and Draco wanted to cover his ears.
“How do you know they are from him?”
“He thinks they know who killed your father.” Harry sighs and pushes a hand through his hair. “You might not believe anyone cares, but the Ministry doesn’t let cases go unsolved, not anymore. I asked Kingsley to let me know if he had any news while I was on leave.” Harry winces. “I thought it might be easier coming from me.”
“And was it?” Draco is torn between jealousy and sympathy. He's not certain he would cope very well with having Harry and then losing him so completely.
“Oh, believe me, I know.” Potter’s laugh quickly turned into a snort that resembled a dying choke and Draco knew that it was the defining moment where Potter was truly defined as a lost cause.
“You think you’re the only one who has no clue what’s in store in life? I’m in a tournament against my will because someone wants me
“Regulus was a Death Eater.”
“Deviants and Perverts Yule Ball.” Draco turns the leaflet in his hands with a smile. “How…festive.”
“If I don’t, no one will,” Draco whispered. “You could do some serious harm with Potter. I don’t entirely understand what your problem is with him. Sure, he’s brash, annoying, a git, self-righteous, has way too many morals, no sense of fashion, his taste is questionable, and he has a hero complex.”
“Why would we—” Draco shook his head, it was best left unsaid. It was no doubt something muggle.
“Hagrid being a half-giant,” Draco prompted, eyebrow arched when Potter shook his head. “You didn’t know?”
“How? They danced next to you.”
Granger was shaking a tin can and each passing moment, her hair appeared to grow bushier and wilder. Whatever she was selling, he wanted no part in it.
“Oh yeah?” Draco asked as he stepped closer to Longbottom and gestured for them to keep walking. “What kind of benefits?”
“When the time comes, you will join me, and that status will increase.”
“That too.” Harry takes a breath. “I think maybe I lost the person I am, trying to be the person I thought I was. Those demons have to be confronted. It’s better I do that on my own time, not on the Ministry’s.”
Longbottom stepped back, face happier than Draco could remember seeing in a long while.
Neville sighed before looking at the table. “I think Harry could be good for you. I’m your friend, and I know you have Dobby, but that’s all you have.”
associate with him again.
Draco had to hide his fingers in his robes as they began to shake slightly. Giving anything away to Severus wouldn’t have been wise, not when he wasn’t sure where his godfather lined up in political beliefs.
“I’ll reach who I want to be someday, and that’s not something that has to run parallel to Potter. Whether he’s around to be the light figure or not won’t affect my decisions. I’m going to be the best person I can, and I’m going to do it for
,” Harry says. “It won’t get as much readership as the
Well, as genuine as they could be, considering they had shunned him for the entire school year.
Draco bit his lip as he debated whether or not to offer his opinion, parents were a sensitive subject for some people.
A small noise left the Hippogriff’s mouth, but Draco wasn’t sure what it was meant to signify. He stupidly hoped it was a noise of understanding, but it was most likely a desire for him to keep petting the animal.
“I’m no angel. I might not take everything under the sun now, because I don't think that was helping. I still like sex. I usually go to saunas when I feel the need.”
His father’s eyes narrowed, and Draco felt as if he was missing something.
Neville did as asked, and this time his wand light up and a spark of red shot out.
“He made the decision for you?”
“Yeah,” Black said slowly. “We’re going to do it. The four of us.”
“Right, we’ll be going now. Since you’ve got the pitch and all.” It was said with a dark glare, and Draco rolled his eyes knowing the moron was only upset about a lack of practice. Honestly, Wood was obsessed with Quidditch, and Draco wondered how far that obsession went. It couldn’t be healthy.
“Then it’s a good thing I don’t want to be with Cho. She just wants someone to talk to, someone to listen to her feelings and confusion over Cedric.”
“Riddikulus!” Longbottom yelled before Snape disappeared in another show of a lacy dress. A triumphant cry of laughter left Longbottom and Draco couldn’t help but smile slightly.
Dobby laid on a spare pillow and turned his head to smile at Draco.
“No,” Draco continued. “She’s brilliant, just not in the way one would expect.”
“You take care of yourself and come back safely, alright?” Draco stroked the snowy owl over her beautiful head before sending her off on her long flight across the ocean. Seeing Susan always reminded Draco of the snowy owl of a certain Gryffindor, and how said Gryffindor’s face used to light up when he saw her at breakfast.
“I’m sure you would, too.” Potter pointedly doesn’t look at Draco, studying his menu as if it’s the most interesting thing he’s read in months.
"Draco you aren't his sins."
“No.” Harry laughs. “Maybe not everything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Harry says. “Not from their perspective, maybe.”
it sometimes. The anonymity of it. The idea of fucking a stranger. I think you enjoyed it too, having a night in sweaty clubs and a pretty blond on his knees.”
“Always horny,” Draco says. Not that he’s complaining. “You can’t get out of this thing on Wednesday?”
Draco pushes into Harry’s hand, clutching onto the sheets as pleasure washes over him. He didn’t think he had anything more left in him, but the air is so full of the thrum of Harry’s magic and the scent of sweat and boy hero, Draco thinks he could let himself go all over again.
Draco groans, torn between wanting Harry’s talented tongue again and needing Harry inside him. “You’d better keep that promise,” he says at last.
“I expect your father told you to hide,” Draco continued, pretending it was just a normal conversation and nothing was amiss.
Severus closed his eyes briefly. “One doesn’t become a Death Eater and change their mind. If Regulus
Potter’s eyebrows rise. “I’m not cheating on anyone. I’m also not engaged anymore, not that it’s any of your business.”
matter.”
Neville made a disgusted noise as Moody pulled out the final spider—a sentiment Draco could relate to.
“I have been informed that you have intimate knowledge of Potter. Is this true?”
“I’m not much for support,” Draco began hesitantly. “But I can listen well, and even offer overbearing opinions at any given time.”
“What’s the world like?” Regulus asked in earnest, his tone was subtle, as if he didn’t want to come across as eager. “Have things changed much?”
“Not really,” Harry says. It’s not convincing in the slightest. “Is that what you like, then? Motorbikes and S&M?” His lips twitch as if the idea amuses him.
As Draco made his way to the door, a call of his name had him sighing before he sidestepped and allowed the other students to leave first.
The sound of Neville’s laughter had Draco smiling slightly. Maybe Neville was right. Making mistakes was a human thing to do. Maybe changing who he once was made him human.
Potter looked to the ground. “I know, and I’m not saying I will. I just—” He bit his lip before looking up at Draco, eyes hesitant.
He read the signature one more time and couldn’t but frown.
“Yeah.” Harry has another swig of his beer. “I haven’t thought about it in weeks. He said we’d be fine because he said he did it all the time without a problem.”
Harry lightens a little, the tension leaving his shoulders. “You were right about Hermione. Me and Ron have a laugh about her sometimes, caring about stuff so much. Maybe we should—”
That wasn’t unheard of, but Draco knew that was associated to hundreds of years of being conditioned to think so.
“Dumbledore approved of this lesson, regardless of whatever you feel. This lesson is needed for your survival.”
“What do you think will be at the end of our obstacles when it’s all said and done with?” Draco whispered. Would it just be more obstacles? Would he ever have a moment of reprieve? Or would he have a chance to relax and live a normal life?
“I’ll see what I can do,” Harry murmurs. He looks at Draco with such naked intensity, it’s impossible to look away.
“Hermione is brilliant and not a Ravenclaw.”
“I like a book from time to time.” Harry rubs his jaw which is shadowy with stubble. “It’s Sirius Black’s diary. I found it when I moved my things back to Grimmauld Place.”
“It’s just…” Neville trailed off before righting himself as they began walking again. “I’ve always known what happened to them. Understood the symptoms of their condition, knew the damage the spell had done, but now I’ve got an image. An image of what could’ve happened.”
“Can you find me all information regarding Regulus Black?”
The girl hurried away, face red and head bowed.
“No matter how hard they try.” Draco can just imagine Potter charging in head first, thinking he can build Rome in a day. “You changed some rules.”
“When did you get so wise?”
“God.” Is about all Draco can manage. He pulls up his trousers—
“Do you really want them to disappear?” Draco has wanted to wipe everything out before and start from a clean slate, but his war was very different to Harry’s. Even during the most wearying days, he knows it’s important for him to remember who he was. He’s not entirely convinced a shiny new Draco Malfoy wouldn’t make exactly the same mistakes again, without the memory of the reasons why he shouldn’t to keep him on track.
“But if you were free, you wouldn’t be. If society had better standards, we never would have met.”
Pans / Gin hit your hallelujah (whoo)
Dobby’s hands fell, the smile leaving his face instantly as his ears drooped.
Draco read the letter with trembling fingers, and he wondered if he could blame it on the vibrations of the Hogwarts Express. He stared out the window as his emotions warred with each other.
Potter would be safe. He had to be.
Unlike the bustling streets of Diagon Alley there’s a stillness to Little Compton Street which couldn’t be more different to the heaving bars and clubs of Soho, where people with pints served in plastic cups spill onto the street on a hot summer’s day. The longer Draco stares at the rows of boarded up bars, a strange shiver travels the length of his spine. He can almost taste the summer, with the cherry blossom lining pristine Chelsea streets and al fresco Sunday roasts in Primrose Hill. He can taste the summer
“My father?”
Draco stared at the letter as his mind raced. Regulus had been friends with Severus? Was that why his godfather hadn’t wanted to talk about Regulus’ death?
“I'm sorry,” Harry says. It seems sincere.
Draco shrugged as he looked to Potter. “It’s a gift.”
“Sirius Black,” Harry replies. The name doesn’t cause the shudder it once would after Black was posthumously pardoned. Draco feels certain that the Padfoot Pardons have some connection to Black. They were part of Potter’s campaign in those early post-war days when the Ministry was in disarray and the Death Eaters were standing trial. Potter did a lot of things in those days. Keeping Draco out of Azkaban was one of them.
The dog’s fur was matted in some spots, he was underfed, exhausted and looked like it was on its last leg.
He smirked when Granger mumbled, “It was one time.”
“I’m not hiding from anything.” Potter frowns at the menu, turning it over in his hands. “Who the fuck has avocado for breakfast?”
for Potter’s tastes. He can’t push aside the niggling fear that Potter might tell him
As he browsed the shelves, eyes unseeing and a heavy heart, Draco wondered why he felt like he was losing something he had never had.
“You are only my heir in blood, nothing more. I should’ve had a spare to replace the worthless heap that you are.”
“You took too long.”
To try. That’s what the crux of it was. Draco wasn’t sure how his own path would go, but he would try—because that’s all he could do.
Potter’s brows were furrowed, and he had a heavy frown on his face.
“Did he now?”
Neville sighed too heavily to not be theatrics. “What happened? You were happy at the dance.”
Longbottom scoffed harshly.
“How should I know?” Potter nearly shouted. “The question isn’t how he got there, it’s how
“Deep down, you know you can’t change,” his Boggart version said with malicious glee. “You had to have known you would be nothing but this.” A hand gestured up and down before resting on the dark mark.
“That is something I have never said about myself nor will you hear me do so.”
“Cancer,” Draco says. “That can’t be cured with magic either.”
models, so attempting to pretend they’re quite the happy throuple seems like cutting off his nose to spite his face. He doesn’t mind making Potter a little jealous—it’s good to keep him on his toes as he clearly thinks he’s some kind of untidy sex-god—but he doesn’t want teasing Potter with the fact people actually find Draco attractive to lead to (incorrect) assumptions about Draco’s availability. Because the never-to-be-spoken-out-loud truth of it is that Draco is wide open, arms outstretched, let’s go on holiday to the South of France and buy a kneazle kind of available. Considering he spends a significant amount of time by himself, Draco isn’t very good at being alone and the fact his love life consists largely of one-off anonymous encounters in dingy Muggle saunas is getting depressing.
The Boggart wavered but didn’t disappear.
Draco furrowed his brows, wondering what Longbottom could be talking about. Before he could ask, the subject was changed.
“Why do you look like that? You disagree?”
. The problem is, lying to himself is becoming increasingly futile, because Potter
of all people about Regulus.
" He laughed, humming a few more notes and taking Draco by the hand. "I guess
“Perhaps you should ask Black and Lupin about it. They would know how he had changed better than anyone else. They might even know his methods, but at least they’ll be able to answer your questions.”
“How was New York?” Draco moves the subject back to America, sensing Harry's mood shift. Draco's never made promises to a significant other beyond dinner dates and a bottle of decent wine, but he imagines it must be strange to go back to a past which held a very different kind of future.
Draco’s eyes looked past Lovegood’s head as they unfocused. He had
“You’ve been playing around with that thing for the last thirty minutes. It’s rude.”
“We’ll see about that!” Nott yelled loud enough that a few students from other tables turned to listen.
“That's what happens if you insist on being friends with straight people.” Draco gives Harry a small smile to show he's joking.
“We will.” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand, his palm clammy. “I hope you’re not going around telling people I’m rubbish in bed, just because you’re jealous.”
The hard edge to Neville’s tone let Draco know it was probably a stupid Gryffindor stubbornness that was taking over.
Harry glares at Draco before his expression clears. He drums his fingers on the book thoughtfully. “There was one thing, actually. Have you ever heard of Little Compton Street?”
“Dobby is—Dobby is fine.”
“No, I’m not. I’m asking you to be brave and take the damn lessons.”
Draco isn’t overly familiar with the idea of a hen night, but then he suspects he favours a slightly less commercial establishment when he goes out in Muggle London. The places with wipe-down surfaces and
Was the government
Draco’s brow furrowed sometime near the beginning of the letter and they never mellowed out. As he tried to understand it all, he worried his lip between his teeth.
“Erm. Nothing. I just showered.”
“I wish I had the answer for that.”
“And?”
Draco knocked on the door harder than normal and snorted when he could hear Sirius complaining louder than the screams of Walburga.
Draco furrowed his brows. “To what? Your lessons?”
“Beside you, actually.” Potter’s shoulder brushes Draco’s and the touch sends an unexpected jolt of heat through Draco. “I don’t want to go looking for this place by myself. My dad didn’t go alone.”
As he entered the library, he caught sight of Potter poring over many different books. Draco bit his lip, unsure if his presence would be welcome.
Draco wasn’t sure who to look up to, who to go to, or who his role models were supposed to be. For a while that had been Severus, but was that a mistake? Should he have no guide and just learn from Regulus?
“Where
“Ginny and I finally realised it wasn’t going to work between us. One of the cases needed somebody on the ground in America, and I took it to give her some space.” Harry takes a moment, as if he’s choosing his words carefully. “It was different for Ginny than it was for me when everything fell apart. She’s bisexual, and for her it could have worked. She came out to me before I'd even come out to myself. She's never really said it in so many words, but I think she wonders if her coming out was the thing that made me realise I'm gay.”
“Being a good person isn’t limited to those who have never messed up. The idea that you can’t be a good person after making mistakes is flawed. Your change deserves to be acknowledged.”
“Oh.” Harry’s breath hitches and his throat bobs as he swallows. “I’ll get something from Deliveroo.”
Draco wasn’t sure if his presence would’ve been appreciated, but that flew from his mind as Potter ran forward and pulled him into a hug.
“No. Of course not.” Draco rolls his eyes. “I’ve been spending the last few days talking to my owl. I’m bored out of my mind.”
“Saving face? Attention?” It was said as the sound of Potter’s voice drew near. “Sometimes, people like hurting others.”
Umbridge’s eyes narrowed, and her beady eyes made him nauseous.
“But freedom doesn’t have to be scary,” Granger argued hotly. “They could do a number of things and get paid for it. Their time can be well spent without having to be ordered around and demeaned at every opportunity.”
As they walked back towards the ball, Draco wondered what Regulus thought. He knew his cousin’s thoughts on the past war, Muggleborns, Muggles and even death. But what of Magical Creatures? Did he hold the belief that they mattered as well? Draco hoped so.
“Why?” Potter takes a bite of his cake and lets out a sinful groan of pleasure. “Would you like to come over for your tea one night?”
With a push, Draco moves Harry’s legs back against his chest and does just that. He keeps his face close to Harry, their breathing ragged as Draco slides almost out and pushes in again after giving Harry time to adjust. The combination of the hot, tight clench of Harry around him and the delicious sounds Harry makes is overwhelming. Fucking has never quite been so desperately intimate, and every part of Draco is sensitised to Harry. It’s as though he’s fucking Harry with his whole body and every raw, unbridled emotion that’s been welling up inside him opens like a dam. He kisses Harry, urgent, messy, fucking him slow and deep. Harry reaches down to wrap his hand around his cock, and Draco can feel the jerk of Harry’s hand beneath him, slapping against their bellies as Draco quickens his pace. Harry’s hair is damp and the untidy curls of his stick to his forehead, his eyes a brilliant, bold green when he flickers them open to look at Draco. Everything is overwhelming.
“Enter.”
Draco looked to the Sorting Hat near McGonagall. Unity, that had been the main message of its warning.
“What?”
Harry stretches his arm across the back of the seat, shifting closer to Draco. “You don’t have to hate him to live a different life.”
“I wasn’t flirting.”
Mr Willis, the Owl Post official, didn’t even wait for Draco’s confirmation before he advanced further into the owlery. He carried on in his commanding voice, probably trying to make up for his lack in size, gesturing wildly with his wand.
“Is this supposed to be comforting?” Potter retorted, an amused smile lifting the corner of one lip.
“Gran, she’s not the nicest, but she’s not—well, she’s not your father.” Neville winced before fiddling with his robes.
“Until she figures out how to get rid of them.” George’s tone was rather proud.
good enough for Harry—has wormed its way under his skin like a parasite, eating away at the hopeful, happy mood of last week.
is a very Slytherin way of doing things. Harry might think he’s going to make Draco blush and simper over his answer, but Draco has other ideas. If Harry wants to talk
“As do mine.” It’s not exactly a lie. Pansy does work, so does Blaise, Theo and Greg. The fact they work in other countries and most haven’t made pains to contact Draco in ages is none of Potter’s business. Draco has friends in London. He just doesn’t choose to spend every waking minute with them. They’re really more acquaintances. Draco isn’t sure you can call someone a friend if your main interactions include a quick shag and not sticking around until the morning. “Why are you so bothered about my social life all of a sudden? It’s not like you give me any information about yours.”
He had half a mind to retire early and return to the Manor, but his father was home for the day, and that wasn’t something Draco wanted to subject himself to.
“My what?” Harry returns with a tray of brightly coloured shots and a round of drinks.
Draco shakes the impossible thought from his mind and goes to wash away the previous night.
“What a load of rubbish.”
As Umbridge turned to leave, Draco wondered if Grubbly-Plank's comment was ironic in the foreboding notion that nothing so far in the year had been jolly good.
“No.” It was whispered quietly, so soft that Draco had to lean forward to listen. “I can make a joke of Snape, pass it off as taking the mickey, but I can’t laugh away my Gran.”
“I know you’re behind me.”
“When did you get wise?”
“Pain?” Potter asked, his voice sharp with concern. “What kind of pain?”
“What’s the pay like?” Draco asked, a decision already made.
“The healers mentioned they needed to do some routine checkups so actually, we were just leaving.”
[CHORUS]
Draco listens carefully until he catches it—the distinctive
“Dobby was right. You aren’t alone.”
When Draco glared darkly, Severus smirked openly.
“I’m right here!” Potter cried.
“Alright. We’ll have to be quick about it, otherwise I’m going to go to the Ministry.”
Draco panted as he tried to calm his heart after running. He looked around, expecting to see his father, but was surprised to see Potter watching them with arched brows.
“You can, you know?” Draco prodded. “You can walk down a different path and be that nobody. Throw away all expectations and just do whatever you want.”
“—And they got this idea in their heads that I would make a better teacher, an idea that I don’t agree with. But we are tired of nothing being done in the lessons, and even the books make a better teacher.”
A dull twist of arousal returns as Draco moves up the bed to kiss Harry. “I think I want you to
“Ron’s carrying the other side.” Harry’s chest puffs out with pride. “Hermione got him a t-shirt that says Auror Ally on it.”
“Bully for you.” Draco glances at Harry. “I don't care. I don't mind talking about it. I'm not ashamed of any of it, even the days when I was fucking just to feel wanted by someone for a change.” He sounds fiercer than he intended and Harry turns properly to him, his eyes fixed on Draco. There's a warm curiosity behind his expression, a flash of empathy and understanding that takes Draco by surprise.
Draco rolls his eyes. He has a feeling Harry’s been busy making lots of wrong assumptions about Draco’s preferences based on those blasted magazines. “
The Sundowner club is named after Sundown Discotheque on Charing Cross which was the location for ‘Bang’ one of London’s first queer club nights which opened in 1976. According to the Sabotage Times, in a piece recounting the recent history of London’s gay clubs, “prior to the opening of Bang gay venues in London were either small members' clubs or...dives with postage stamp-sized dance floors.” The reason I chose this as a site for the first kiss between Harry and Draco is because even following the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK in 1967, the legislation stated that men aged 21 and over could only conduct homosexual activity in private. This meant that gay men could be arrested for kissing and sometimes even chatting in public, even in places hosting events like this, which were frequently raided by the police. The original materials advertising Bang included this sobering reminder of the legislation.
rich, wealthier than he likely deserves, but with this he can use that fortune for some good. The Malfoy name will never lose its associations with pure-blood politics and some of the darkest periods of wizarding history, but he can put the fortune his family amassed by pursuing all of the wrong paths, into finally pursuing the right one.
Potter. “I didn't get the impression you found it at all
“Nobody but Kreacher.” The sheer glee in Kreacher’s voice had Draco shaking his head.
“Remember, Kreacher, Black knows nothing. Keep it that way.”
Draco shook his head, not entirely surprised that Severus hadn’t told him that.
Well, it was clear that Severus wasn’t a fan of Sirius. Draco wondered what the background information for that entailed, but it wouldn’t be wise to ask—he wasn’t stupid enough to do that—not when Severus’ fingers were clenched so tightly.
“Thanks, Professor,” Harry says.
“Were you eavesdropping?”
A familiar bark had Draco turning around to see Snuffles and Potter walking towards the train.
“Figures,” Draco mumbled darkly as he glared at the desk.
“You weren’t exactly being quiet! What was I supposed to do? Tune you out?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s confined enough that the fireworks won’t get loose and disappear into a wider space, but it’s also big enough that Umbridge will have trouble getting to them. At least not with how many floors and hallways there are.”
“Life on Mars.” Harry puts his hand on the wall next to Draco’s head, his gaze dropping to Draco’s lips. “Bowie.”
His father jerked his head in a way that Draco wondered if it was a nod of agreement, but it wasn’t until he realized how close the Dark Lord’s feet were to his father’s head, that he knew it was an aim to grovel. His stomach soured at the thought that his father would have fallen to the delusion of a man like the Dark Lord.
“Is this your dog?”
Draco’s cock twitches enthusiastically at the thought, and he runs his hand over it in a quick stroke, as Harry moves back on his heels to watch. “Not everything, Potter.”
“That was my line.”
“What do you think? Think we can trust him?”
has done you a favour after all.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Kreacher was lying to him, and the only way Potter was going to find out if Black was there was to go in and see for himself. I just helped him along.”
Umbridge’s smile fell—something Draco was grateful for, it was a hideous smile.
“Brilliant. First time for everything.”
. The trace of old magic is particularly strong here, just as it was by the boarded-up bars of the earlier stretches of Little Compton Street. The whole place is full of echoes, like the faint pulse of music somewhere just out of reach.
Don't brag about it, come show me
A wave of emotion crashes over Draco and he closes his eyes. “Thank you,” he says. “Your opinion matters to me.” There’s not a hint of irony, sarcasm or teasing in his tone. It’s the truth.
sorry I was a decent friend and made sure you were safe.”
“Don’t be so hasty.” Draco sees an opportunity for teasing Potter, and of course he takes it. “I’m sure your oiled torso would be an instant hit with the clientele. You should wear leather trousers and a Gryffindor tie around your neck. It would be very homoerotic.”
but he had the Dark Mark,
“Dobby promises! Master Draco isn’t alone, Dobby will always visit. Master Draco is family.”
When they reached her door, Potter pulled out a small knife, and Draco was surprised to see that he could pick locks.
Umbridge clenched her wand so tightly that Draco feared it would break. The majority was against her, and he knew she wouldn’t overpower all of them.
“Perhaps not, Draco,” Dobby agreed. “But the pain you would have.”
Harry closes the door behind them and gives Draco a sheepish look. “I like that there are stairs. It feels like a small house.”
When Draco wiped his eyes and looked up, he had to brace himself as Dobby lunged forward, arms wrapping around his neck.
Draco reached up to jab to the portkey once.
Draco fights back a rush of heat which threatens to leave him embarrassingly flushed. There’s something quite peculiar about being at the swapping numbers stage with Potter. It’s dangerously flirtatious. Even adding his number into Potter’s phone before giving it to him felt like an invitation of sorts.
“Ron, are you okay?” Potter’s hesitance had Draco curious.
“See that you do.”
Draco decides to put Harry out of his misery. “I’ll shower after.”
“Voldemort’s back.”
“Never you mind.” Potter’s tone was short and clipped.
“I know,” Harry says, with not a hint of teasing. “I know.” He kisses Draco again as if to prove it, deep, searching and confident.
Auror eyepieces are on fire man
exposed the existence of Little Compton Street and Harry started working in earnest on his new fight. Draco’s heart lurches at the sight of Harry, wearing his rainbow flag like a cape. He’s chatting to Paul from the Christopher Street Inn, who holds a placard high in the air with Jonathan Ashton’s picture on it, advertising the new Christopher Street clinic and seeking new volunteers for ACT UP. Draco’s heart gets too big for his chest and he can’t help the ball of fear that settles in his belly. He keeps looking at the crowd, trying to catch a glimpse of a Death Eater mask or somebody who might try to cast a spell at Harry—the celebrity that the
“What a bloody day.”
A small pause caused him to glare, Dobby always did like to be dramatic.
“No,” Potter agreed. “But I’d like to, someday.”
“Spoken like someone who doesn’t put out the maximum effort.”
“How was it?” Harry asked as his fingers rubbed circles on Draco’s back. “Did you have fun with Neville?”
“Hey Dobby,” Draco began hesitantly. “Do you know anything about an old diary?”
Draco swallows because
“The Room of Requirement. I guess Dobby showed it to Harry.”
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Harry laughs and the tension in his body eases. “I’ve done it before, but I don’t do it a lot. It’s not been brilliant.” He obviously sees the flash of anger in Draco’s expression and he shakes his head. “Not
“You always were stupidly reckless.”
Draco laughs and tips his shot in Millicent’s direction before downing it in one.
“Past what?” Denial, such a beautiful concept.
Little Compton Street has been described by the
like her.”
Before Draco could respond, Weasley pulled Potter into a boring conversation regarding Ministry policies. He could have saved him, but what was the fun in that?
“No, I don’t think I will,” whispered Draco as he tried not to look at Potter as they passed.
“Did the fashion section get scrapped? I told you no one is interested in—” Neville’s breath caught and Draco closed his eyes in defeat.
Before Draco could tell Potter that he was being weird, Potter stood up and looked towards Dumbledore’s office.
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, he didn’t bother to look up as he took the books from her hands. “I don’t think I’ll be able to read both before summer holiday happens.”
Draco closed his eyes, fighting back a whimper as he let Dobby go and wiped his eyes.
“There was a bunny once,” Draco recalled as he tentatively began petting the dog’s head. “It wasn’t a magical animal, but I found it on the border of the Manor’s perimeter. I wanted to keep her, she was a little thing, barely as big as your head.”
Draco was used to the dirty passageway that he liked to consider his go-to spot for conversations with Dobby. The rock was still uncomfortable, but it was better than the floor.
He stared at the letter more out of habit than anything. What had Regulus meant? The clues were there, but Draco wasn’t sure he understood them.
“Piss off,” Draco said with a laugh as he shoved Potter. “I’m trying to help you, you prat.”
“We aren’t surprised you said no,” Black began in a soft tone. It’s the act of bravery that was surprising. The act itself, not the merits of your morals.”
Harry gives Draco a questioning look but pulls it from his satchel and pushes it across the table. “Today’s?”
When Severus arched a brow, Draco flushed.
“Not at the minute, thanks.” Harry sounds slightly hoarse which only increases Draco’s irritation. The least Potter can do is get hard away from Draco, if it’s not going to be because of him. “I’m here with someone.”
Weasley clenched his jaw as Draco ignored him and sat down anyway. They were nearing the end of a Care of Magical Creatures class. Most of their classmates were hiding from the Blast-Ended Skrewts, and it made the chance of a discussion possible.
That caused Draco’s eyes to widen. “My grades have improved since last year.”
Draco startled at Potter’s voice before he turned around and glared at the amused expression on his face.
“I will have you know that I do all of my homework.”
“When it all goes to shite, will you still be here with me?”
“That can be arranged.” Draco glances at Harry. “What are we doing?”
“You have a heart worth praising,” Draco whispered. He couldn’t go through Dobby’s experiences and still be happy, still be positive.
on the doors don’t exactly attract the diverse club scene crowd. When he drinks in London he doesn’t really favour the cheesy pop of Village or G-A-Y anymore. Even though he’s not even thirty yet, he feels old and alone in those clubs. When he discovered the blissful pleasures of Muggle drugs, dancing on the vast floors of Heaven after the war was like a religious experience, the sweaty bodies, beating music and pounding hearts enhanced by the chemical du jour. Draco left that behind some time ago, and now he prefers a glass of something expensive in Claridges or The Savoy. It’s boring, clubbing alone.
“I thought you might want to come and see Godric’s Hollow on Monday. Ginny’s moving out properly this weekend, and I’d like you to see it.”
“Malfoy—”
“Mister Black.”
“So maybe my wisdom has been shadowed before, but that doesn't mean it wasn’t there.”
He closed his eyes at the sound of his name. Leave it to Potter to use cunning against him.
“Do any of you know which curses are punished heavily by Wizarding law?”
“Freedom. They don’t understand what it’s like for Dobby. Dobby gets to choose what he wants, and Dobby
Potter chuckled, and Draco could feel it in the way his shoulders shook.
“How do you know this?” The suspicion in Black had spread to Lupin as both stared at him with their arms crossed and their foreheads pinched.
Draco pulls a face. “You knew who I was when we started this.”
“Mhm, Hermione’s too.”
Karkaroff’s face froze, grimace falling flat. “Pardon me?”
Draco shook his head, not wanting to fight with Neville.
“Diggory is dead!” several people screamed, some stood up to run closer while others tried to leave. Rushed feet and loud noises could be heard but Draco’s attention was centered on Potter.
Draco hadn’t received a timed summons, nor had there been any message regarding when to appear. When the Dark Lord’s smile grew, he knew it wouldn’t have mattered when he had arrived, it still wouldn’t have been enough.
“Are you going to ask me to dance or not,” Patil interrupted loudly, causing the rest of them to shift on their feet awkwardly.
“How are we supposed to check?” Potter’s eyes were still on Draco, but the question had been directed elsewhere.
“Oi!”
The locket lowered as Kreacher put his hand down and blinked up at Draco.
“I am so sick of people seeing my father first. You judge me on his actions and his crimes. Your bloody eye watches me constantly as if I am a threat, or someone who has earned your suspicion. Instead of being a judgmental prick, how about you judge me for my own actions?”
Draco wants Harry writhing and desperate. He wants more than one plea before he gives Harry what he wants. He pushes two fingers inside Harry, who is now thoroughly relaxed. It would be easy to fuck Harry now, but Draco wants to do this. He sees what Harry gets from it, being in this position and watching his fingers slide inside. Harry on the other end of a finger-fucking is a veritable treat. He pushes back against Draco’s hand, always so pent up and full of tireless energy. Draco takes his time, curling his fingers back towards him and making sure he hits his target enough times to drive Harry to the brink of pleasure. Eventually, he slides his fingers out and gets Harry on his back as he lubes himself up and casts the necessary protective charms.
“I didn’t expect to see you here,” Draco said as he sat next to Potter on the log in their usual spot by the lake. “But with Dumbledore gone, I suppose your lessons have been put on hold.”
“I figured if you couldn’t go to the lessons, then I could bring the lessons to you.”
The sound the door made as it slammed against the wall was almost as good as the way a few stragglers startled in surprise as Draco stormed into Severus’ last class of the day.
Harry—or of Harry using them himself gives Draco heart palpitations and the last thing he needs is to get half-hard over Potter and his voracious sexual appetites.
After compiling a list of music shops and charity shops, and making a tentative guest list, both Harry and Draco agreed it was a beautiful thing to see: Pansy Parkinson putting her ordinarily nefarious and scheming mind to such a noble and productive use. So much so, they couldn't help but heartily agree to attend. In full costume.
“Are you telling us that the first time using the spells will be during the test?” Parvati asked, eyebrows raised and a baffled expression on her face—something Draco could relate to.
“And the last one?”
Draco murmurs a lubricating charm to leave himself slick with lube, bending down to kiss Harry. “I’m going to use your cock for my pleasure now, Potter. Keep talking.”
“Draco, it changes
Draco could tell that Severus was speaking from personal experience and it had his back straightening. His godfather wasn’t one to open up, and it was enough for Draco to
“On that note,” Draco began, as he looked to Potter one last time. “I’ll be leaving.”
“I could kiss you.”
"But Draco—"
“Mmhm.” Draco opens up the paper and shows Harry the picture of he and Ginny, walking through Diagon Alley. “Can you imagine what they would say if that was you and me, Potter?”
“You were, and you weren’t.” Draco puts his coffee down and crosses his legs. “The whole battle doesn’t rest on your shoulders, this time. There are plenty of people who will support you. My name is unlikely to help anything, but I’m extremely rich, Potter.”
The Dark Lord did not resemble something human. The mixture of animalistic features was startling. Red eyes peered into his own, and Draco thanked everything he had that he had taught himself Occlumency as the stare increased in intensity. Long pale fingers toyed with a wand as if it were unimportant, but Draco knew that it was for show. Thin lips were quirked in an oddly pleasant manner, but he could see right through it. There was a dangerous tilt to the Dark Lord’s lips and it put him on edge.
“I am looking into my family history.”
His breath left him suddenly and Draco’s mouth parted in surprise.
“Perhaps, but that’s not my place to judge. Your emotions however erratic they may be, are still valid.”
When Draco pushed passed them and entered his dorm, he wasn’t surprised to see it occupied, nor was he surprised to see them reading the article too.
Draco ran down the corridor, pushing past students as he desperately tried to find Dobby. The link was broken, and that could only mean one of two things. Either Dobby was freed, or something had happened to him.
“If you aren’t using Occlumency shields in your sleep, or at the very least emptying your mind, then you are susceptible for Legilimency.” Draco paused to frown as his explanation didn’t make sense. “Usually, the caster has to be in the general facility, so I am unsure how the Dark Lord could have done anything, unless—” He cut off when the three of them shared a very telling look.
“I think it’s cute.”
“Well,” Potter yelled loudly, and Draco found it a bit barbaric. “I expect he’d say something different now, wouldn’t he?”
“Malfoy,” Lupin called again, with more authority. “If you could stay behind, please.”
Harry’s eyes twinkled. “Absolutely.”
Draco thinks.
Before Draco took off, he shot the diary in Potter’s hand one last lingering look.
,” someone in the crowd whispered, but Draco didn’t care, not when Potter smiled at him.
“Sirius, is that you? Merlin, you didn’t age well.”
“Please don’t, Draco.”
“Malfoy—”
Potter’s forehead wrinkled and a small frown formed.
“It’s one way to get people to change their mind,” Neville continued. “I can’t imagine there will be a single student who will have not read this by the end of the week.”
Draco clenched his fists. “I can think for myself, you know.”
“I reckon he’s got more important things on his mind.” Potter doesn’t elaborate. He takes a careful sip of his tea, clearly building up to asking Draco something impertinent. “Why are you always on your own?”
“And we are going to have so much fun. I can show you the new greenhouse Gran set up. It’s nothing big, just a small space, but it’s big enough for the Devil’s Snare I’ve been growing since first year.”
“Not all spells require precise wand movements.”
“Only if I can be a knight too,” Draco conceded.
“To see them means to see death, and I wish my experiences had never granted me that sight. But they aren’t doing anything but being who they are, you know?”
Draco lifted his hand in the air and moved it in a so-so manner. “Neville was fun to be with, if you discount his plants that are questionable, but his grandmother really tests my patience. If she keeps insulting him I am going to lock her in a room with Umbridge and see who makes it out alive.”
“There’s the Hufflepuff in you.”
The sounds of several shocked cries had Draco sending a brief apology to the spider who died to satisfy a madman’s cruel intentions.
Harry narrows his eyes, casting his wand over the painting with a
“Who’s to say he doesn’t already know,” Draco said as he placed his hand underneath his chin.
“I want to go with you.” He felt his cheeks heat up, but the truth of the statement rang through. It didn’t matter if things changed. Draco wanted it—wanted one night to himself—one night where he didn’t have to think about his future, his father or anyone else.
Draco laughed harder. “No, I’m not. We don’t know much about what happened, actually. All we know is that the Dark Lord went after Lily and James Potter’s son.”
“I want you to finger me until I come,” Draco decides.
When Potter watched Draco with an intensity he wasn’t used to, he wondered if perhaps he had said something wrong.
“For now, I need you on the sidelines. Any and all observations you make will be appreciated.”
He wasn’t sure what kind of person he would have been without Regulus. Wasn’t sure what path he would have taken. Would he have chosen to become a Death Eater? Would he have unknowingly allowed history to repeat itself through a familial bond? Would Draco have made the same mistakes?
Trust wasn’t something Draco had experience with. There wasn’t a single person outside of Dobby that he trusted. Was that wrong? Should Draco have made a rapport with others? He couldn’t wrap his mind around the thought of being vulnerable. By Regulus’ words it was obvious that he had never opened up to someone, so how could he preach something that never happened?
He closed his eyes when he realized that it wasn’t about him. None of it was. Draco knew that if he truly wanted to change, then he would have to step out of his comfort level. He needed more than one side of things, needed more than his father’s words. If Draco truly wanted to understand all parts of society, then he

that it all began to make sense.
“Rather small for a crup,” Neville said with pinched brows and a small frown.
“Don’t you like it?” Draco asks.
There was a moment of silence before Potter spoke up.
“I know but Sirius is there, and we need to save him.”
’s conclusions. Merlin forbid he’d actually give Draco any information about his personal life. If Potter is as pally with Ginevra as he seems to be, Draco is starting to wonder if Potter and his merry band of Gryffindors are into swinging. It seems like the kind of thing Potter might go in for, a way to unwind after years of going around with a gigantic stick up his arse.
“What’s with you two?” Granger asked, speaking up for the first time. Draco was surprised at her restraint, she tended to over talk.
“I know.” Harry shrugs. “I’m not saying never, but I think it’s okay. It took me a while to realise, I already have a family.” He gives Draco a lopsided smile. “It just looks different to the one I imagined.”
That had Draco glaring at the dirt. Perhaps as a child he had had the same notion—he would have done anything to have his father be proud.
"Don't give me that," Theo argued coming to stand next to Pansy whose mouth was pinched and clearly offended. "You've changed alright, just not for the better."
“Did you know that Luna can see the thestrals?”
“No.” Harry rubs his jaw, watching Draco. “Do you want me to?”
“Uh huh,” Sirius agreed with a hum. “And floo? Does Augustus not have a fireplace?”
“Just don’t keep it somewhere where you will touch it!” Lupin called after Black as they headed towards the kitchen door with Kreacher following them.
Draco couldn’t look towards where Lupin was, didn’t want to see his expression. He rushed out of the area as his body shook.
The adrenaline rush from treating the dragon had Harry still on such a high that his words just tumbled out: “I really love working with dragons, they are such amazing creatures!
Draco watched him leave the library in confusion.
“Pity,” Harry muses. He hesitates before leaving the room, his eyes catching Draco’s. “Do you want a shower too?”
“I didn’t ask for your excuses.”
“I never had a pet before,” said Draco as he continued to kneel but settled more on the back of his legs. “My father’s a prick, you see.”
Draco stood up, hating that their understanding was crumbling, but he couldn’t bring himself to stay while his temper went unchecked.
“Tell me, are you proud? Are you honoured that I have sought you out?”
“Because no one else will.”
Draco knew that he was about to discover whatever Dobby had been keeping a secret. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
“I wanted to thank you,” Potter said, not coming any closer.
As Draco observed the other contestants, he noticed that they all seemed to be absorbed in either the food or their dates. It was a pleasant atmosphere, which tamed the worry that it would all end in disaster.
“Is this why you were told to learn Occlumency?”
The sound of their compartment door sliding open had Draco peering up into amused green eyes.
“When am I ever polite?”
“And you think that is you?”
Why would Black enter the castle? Who would risk being caught?
“Not everyone. I certainly didn't,” Draco lies. It's a wonder a bolt of lightning from one of London's endless thunderstorms doesn't hit him.
“Well geez,” Draco began, hand covering his heart. “What Nargle crawled up your arse today?”
“But it shouldn’t be like that!” Draco cried, running his hands through his hair. “You shouldn’t have to make peace. You should be doing what you want, what you love to do.”
“I’ll find a way,” Draco promised. “You deserve more than this, deserve more than to be at our beck and call. Dobby, you deserve so much more than this life.”
For a moment, nothing happens. The lack of response leaves a bitter taste in Draco’s mouth because of course he isn’t welcome in this newfound place of Potter’s. If it still exists at all, it’s just another part of the wizarding world for Draco to feel unwelcome in. Just another place that wants to keep him at bay in the way his ancestors sought to keep people without pure blood lineage out of magical places. It makes his skin crawl with shame, being here with Potter and experiencing rejection first hand. It’s hardly as though Harry isn’t already fully aware of all the mistakes Draco has made and the elongated silence sends them into sharp relief.
and everything clicked into place.
There was a story there, Draco knew it. There was no love lost, that’s for sure. Was that why Potter spent so much time with the Weasleys?
“I know.” Draco was fully aware of the presence of brusque Aurors wherever they went. It felt as though every conversation was being carefully observed from a distance. “The press hated us as much as they adored you, and we soon realised that bandying about together did the very opposite of what it was supposed to, which was keep us safe and help us integrate into society again.”
“I’m thrilled your former lover thinks we make a good match. What a delightfully modern group we will be on our night out.” Draco pauses in his eating, mulling over Harry’s revelation. “She doesn’t think it’s peculiar?”

“What song?” Even as he asks the question, Draco already knows the answer.
article, and their first strange meeting. He still can’t fathom quite why Potter is so keen to repeat the experience of eating brunch with Draco, but at this point Draco isn’t sure he really knows Harry Potter at all. It’s just a muddle of memories of a boy hero which carry a strange, nostalgic quality and a passing familiarity with salacious gossip columns which probably bear little relationship with the truth. For somebody whose emotions are written all over his face, Potter remains something of an enigma, present but untouchable.
“No,” Draco and Granger said in unison. He gestured for her to finish.
“And you think that is wise?” Draco teased as he leaned away from a playful slap from Dobby. “Your ideas nearly get him killed, you know.”
“I did. Ginny is talking to a few friends.” Neville pointed towards a few Ravenclaws.
Potter rolled his eyes but didn’t argue, and that was the only proof Draco needed.
“I don’t know if I can,” Draco answered honestly. He looked away when she frowned.
The previous chaos stilled as everyone looked between Draco and Marcus.
When Potter reached blindly for Draco’s hand, he realized that even if things ended in Fiendfyre, their night would have been worth it. One night might be all they were given, and Draco was going to make the best of it.
“Some of them. I’m not bothered.”
Draco looked to the ground, uncomfortable as he wished he was anywhere else.
“He’s not here,” Draco said as he tried to keep his voice even and withhold a smirk.

There was no chuckle, no laughter, because it hit home for them—too close to the truth.
When the dog laid back down, head on Draco’s knee, he pretended that it was in support of his words.
Draco’s lips twitched. He wasn’t sure what to make of Black. Black wasn’t what he expected. It was easy to see how Black had been the outcast of their family, and Draco liked that.
Draco hummed as he looked back to the lake.
Severus’ lip turned downward.
“Oh.” Draco’s stomach knots and he swallows his coffee too quickly. “I didn’t realise we were doing that.”
of the Apparition had Draco a little nervous. “Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to not tell my father something, would he be able to order the information anyway?”
The root of the problem hadn’t been Hagrid’s overenthusiastic teaching, it hadn’t been his father’s warped sense of justice, nor was it the Hippogriff’s fault. The problem had been him. It was his own fault the Hippogriff attacked.
Draco hummed curiously. “I know that kind of thing happened a lot right after the war. It’s illegal, though. A few inmates petitioned the court for a retrial, but usually it was the families pushing for it.”
“Looks like we both have it rough.”
Draco bites back a groan at the thought of Harry’s soapy, shower-warm skin. “What are you thinking about?”
“Probably the fact we’re getting on.” Potter pushes a hand through his unruly hair, the scar on his forehead showing momentarily. “I told him we had a history after he asked how it was going. I think he thought I meant
