“Am I?”
"God," Harry said. "Yeah, just like that. I want you to come tasting my cum."
drunk," Harry says. "I think he was too, but we both took sobering potions."
Draco looks back over his shoulder. "Do you wanna complain some more? Or you can fuck me. I've got fifteen minutes before the post-game, your choice."
Draco did not go on a date with Potter. Draco invited him to a very chummy
We flew to Puerto Vallarta next, where his mother had smuggled away the spawn of Voldemort and her big sister Bellatrix. The child was four years old and already had a mean streak. Couldn’t eat a bowl of cereal without throwing her spoon at her Muggle nanny’s face. I watched her for four days before I went back to Draco and asked him if this was some sort of joke. I didn't want to kill children too young to have done anything wrong, even if they were little shits. That wasn’t how judgement was passed. And then he asked me if I would have killed Voldemort when he was that age.
"I'm," Draco gasped. "I'm—I'm still fucking you."
"I'd rather stick my dick in Voldemort than you," Harry snarled back. He fell back naked onto crumpled sheets, pulling Draco down with him.
"That's sad."
The first name he gave was Corban Yaxley. He was hiding out in Thailand with a Thai wife and a half-Thai three-year-old son. Mornings, he rode out on his motorbike and got a coffee and a cake at the only bakery in town. He’d sit out on the side of the road and eat the dry cupcake down to the wrapper before wiping off his trousers and crossing the street to the beach resort, where he was the manager. It was easy to snuff him out. All I did was rent a Tuk-Tuk and catch him in the middle of the road. Tire treads down his body, and that was it. Dead.
“He’s gonna do that Malfoy thing,” Tony Hawk says over the speakers just as Draco plummets down the ramp. “Frontsize nosebone. Kickflip Indy Mute 540. Kickflip Indy to Fakie — OH MY GOD —” the crowd roars, and Harry with it, screaming nonsense —
They're on the stretch of pavement outside Draco's flat. Draco's wand is out and spelling Harry's hands warm. He wraps protection charms around Harry's kneecaps, smooths the scars over Harry's elbows, heals the blunt-razor knick on Harry's neck, then makes a note to buy him a new one —
." A heart-wrenching tale about the loss of a lover. And while Draco's friendship with Crabbe barely encroached on love, that particular story saw straight to his grief. Flawed, awful Crabbe. Draco couldn't explain why he loved him. All he knew was the book made Crabbe's passing a little more bearable, and he needed it back, lest—
“Malfoy’s trial started
, aren't you used to—"
Malfoy cups Harry's face with a gentle hand instead. "What happened to you?" he murmurs.
“No.”
The longcase clock read five-thirty-five. It always did when Draco stopped by. Some evenings, Harry suspected Draco was a mechanism of the clock itself: a ticking, geared thing; cold and impersonal and relentless in its precision.
Harry runs a finger down where Draco’s handkerchief rubbed raw and recalls when Draco kissed him last night and said that he was in love with him. Harry said there was no use in loving a dying man, to which Draco replied, “we’re all dying,” like dying comes in one colour for everyone, and that colour is grey.
Harry follows all the way back to Draco's street two blocks off the park, where the streets quiet down, and there's plenty of parking for the lone coffee shop on the corner. Draco stops in front of his door, his chest heaving.
"My father was the richest man I know, and he still placed himself at the mercy of the Dark Lord."
"Bad date?" Harry can't help but ask.
"Just like that."
"Right," Eltanin smiles wryly. "Of course you did. Well, I suppose now that we have a pen, we can get on with the signing."
"Here," Harry says, grabbing Draco by the robes as he rounds the corner.
Harry rubbed a naked pec with a distracted thumb. Behind him, Viktor Krum winked from a poster. "I suppose there's only one way to settle this," Harry said after a slow, contemplative second. "Let's fuck."
Malfoy closes his eyes and sighs, his mouth opening obediently, his tongue lax.
Harry's phone rings.
It was as though, at the age of one, the slingshot of prophecy had launched him forth, and he’d been scrambling to stop ever since.
"I'm only helping you because I promised my late mother that I'll be a more forgiving person," Draco says when he arrives, which is a lie if Harry ever heard one—as if he could forget Draco's earlier confession.

"I could sue you for the number of times I've stabbed my knee on the edge of that monstrosity," Ginny says.
“More glitter.”
Harry turns back to the bar.
Harry leaned over Draco, nipping at his ear. "The double-headed Sickle. Suppose that wasn't you either."
“Right,” Harry says. From the stands, Draco is a tiny matchstick on top of the vert ramp. Harry knows it’s him more than he can see that it’s him.
"It's fine," Harry says, and his heart agrees, echoing warmth.
"No, tell me."
"You must have hundreds in here," Draco says, his voice muffled from deep inside the fridge.
The pounding started at dawn and didn't cease until Draco, resigned, trudged to the front door and creaked it open an inch.
until a few days later since Harry dragged him out for a pickup Quidditch game. They'd gone to the pub after, and all thought of reading went out the door.
"I, just. You know. Mums." Hermione blinks back tears, the handkerchief remaining resolutely in her hand, though she can't resist a snort when Parvati starts reading her vows.
Harry kicks Ron's stool leg. "What's going on?"
“You want portraits. To attend our wedding.”
“Look, your mob boss boyfriend doesn’t hire me to look pretty. That’s your job.”
"He says we're not good together," Harry says. "Said I didn't see all of him, but I don't know how, since I've already seen him naked several times over. You don't think he means, like, x-rays? He's got a dark artefact lodged in his kneecap?"
Nobody bats an eye when Harry arrives two hours late to his photoshoot with BroomBod on Thursday. They drape him over their latest stationary broom and have him scowl at the video cameras while a woman announces
"Fuck," Harry mumbles. He tries moving his hips, to get them deeper and graze that—"Fuck," he moans, his spine rounding, head falling onto Draco's shoulders. He takes a stuttering breath. "Fuck. C'mon. Are you gonna fuck me or what?"
“So I’ve come down in person to savour the utter disappointment on your face when whoever you meant to send this owl to never showed up, and it was just me, your childhood nemesis—”
this? This is some really advanced magic."
“Pretty.”
Ron called Harry's name twice from downstairs. Draco heard a flurry of feet up the stairs, and then Ron was yelling Harry's name again.

Draco’s world inverts when Harry saves his life. “Pay it off,” Father hisses from behind bars, so Draco tries. He forces his way into the Aurors, onto Harry’s missions, into any possible opportunity to even the scales. But instead, Draco’s debt only grows when Harry saves him so often that Draco finds himself transforming, morphing into something of Harry’s making. Like in breathing on borrowed time, he’s become something to own.
"Ugh," Ginny says. Her fingers struggle to detangle the knots at the ends of her hair. "I’ve got to get a new conditioner."
Now, isn't that interesting?
"Hi," he says again, the next day, the next, the next, the bright crimson soles of his trainers flapping ahead until he disappears, around a bend.
Harry makes a face. Ron's talking about Dean's Quidditch League, the one they're all in—Ron, Dean, George, Angelina, Oliver, Ginny during the off-season—and Harry, until he flaked enough that they kicked him off.
"Well," Harry says, feeling reckless. "We didn't get much further than the back of my car."
Draco comes back with a black coffee and sits down with it. He slides it across the booth to Harry, who takes a sip, mouth over the rim. A faint sheen coats his upper lip.
The boots still.
Draco ignored him. "It'll be faster if I help you search. With my collection; you might be hunting for days."
Harry couldn’t help but think that he wasn’t meant for his life.
going a hundred down the motorway.
. He'd read only a few pages, just enough to set him off to sleep.
Nobody is a villain because they are born in the dark. You know what I am, and I bare my teeth to remind you of it, a warning wrapped under a sneer.
Fuck. But it's too late—Ron's mouth tightens, and Harry knows the night's over for them. Ron blows up if he so much as breathes the same air as Malfoy. He says Malfoy doesn't deserve his presence or whatever indignant shite he spews whenever his righteousness gets the better of him. Harry hasn't forgiven Malfoy either, but he's learnt to deal with it in other ways. A quick wank in the toilets usually does the trick.
“Don’t lie. I can tell when you’re lying.”
Malfoy shoves them into the master bath. He says, "Your shower is the size of my living room", before dropping down on his knees to suck Harry off. Harry forces Malfoy's chin up so he can see the dewy sheen collecting above Malfoy's lashes and imagines them to be tears, though Malfoy shakes the illusion every time he sighs and takes Harry in deeper down his throat like he loves this, loves his shins scraped up on bathroom tiles with his mouth's full of Harry's cock.
“Looks like rain,” Draco said, waiting.
"You can try it," Harry says, unfamiliar pride welling in his chest.
"Yeah. Um...it wasn't very good. Pansy has terrible taste in Muggle arts and culture. She'll watch anything with attractive people in it."
The server leaves with their order, promising beers on their way back.
“I hate him too. You know that,” Draco said.
." His fist was still twisted in the front of Harry's jersey. Harry wasn't fighting back—he looked bored, that bastard—so Draco let go and backed up. He crossed his arms over his chest.
It’s hill magic, I think. The way it takes your mind and winds it back to birth, back to when everything was new, and every thought blinked curiously awake, half-formed and simple in its incompleteness. Emotions come without names or definitions, and love comes effortlessly, like birds singing nestled between the knolls and I with my hand in Harry’s, walking beside them.
Ginny rolls her eyes. "Always
“I don’t hate you,”
Draco set down his quill and considered the question seriously. Why did he care so much? He scratched his nose. "I read through a lot of books before I find one that speaks to me. Not all answers resonate. Actually, most don't. So it hurts to lose ones that do."
"Oh! I haven't known him for terribly long. I only moved into that flat a few months ago. He and Spencer have lived there for a few years, though. They both work at BroomBod. The stationary broom company?"
For Father: box of chocolates bribed between the bars of Azkaban.

"I was right to, wasn't I? I had no idea he lived with the fucking bartender from Nylon."
Malfoy opens his mouth but then closes it, deflating. "I have to watch you do it."
." She eyes the martini in Harry's hand. It's midday. "I don't believe that for a second."
In retrospect, Diagon Alley was a poor choice of street-address for a wizard hiding from his past. But having Pansy by his side had always felt akin to holding up a shield. An angry, mouthy shield. A little braver, Draco ventured out to Flourish and Blotts that afternoon, where he bought seven books with velvety emerald covers that evoked memories of the Slytherin common room.
an old Pureblood family."
Potter leaned on Draco’s hotel room door with his hands in the pockets of his coat as though he were cold, though the corridor was perfectly room-temperature. Draco took one look at him and turned on his heel, though of course Potter caught up.
"Yeah?" Harry smirked. "Tiny limp dick in my hand, like holding a soggy crumpet—"
"You do?" Ron asks. "Harry, you never talk about—ow! Ginny!"
In the glow of the fire, Draco looks like he’d come from the past—a golden, unmarred purity.
"Oh. You're serious."
Draco’s Muggle flat is a hotchpotch of three oddly-shaped rooms that sum up to about twenty-seven square meters total in living space. The kitchen table is a fire hazard rammed up against the oven door, but Harry sits at it gamely enough, his legs squished between cans of beans and a box of instant ramen.
"Dean says this place is good," Ron says, tucking into his seat and reading through the one-page menu with the same concentration he typically reserves for chess.
"What about you, mate? Any new ladies? Or gents?"
"Are you nervous?" Ron asks, punching Harry's shoulder. The mascara brush slips, running a streak down Harry's cheek. The makeup artist cleans it up with a thin-lipped glare at Ron.
“Go faster,” Draco says.
They make a sweep of the kitchen, the bathrooms, the bar. Then Draco takes them back through the parlour to the closet in the entryway.
They return to schedule. Malfoy's thighs are still slick with lube, so Harry ruts between them until he comes with a perfunctory grunt. It doesn't take him any time, though Malfoy lingers longer than he should, fingers brushing down Harry's cheek with tenderness, like they both weren't splattered in cum.
Harry rolls Draco over on the bed. The room shifts around them again, the bed sinking down to meadow and the canopy opening up to a sky in perpetual sunset.
So the days pass with the walls left white, suspended in a cold and eternal Limbo.
"Daffodils," Harry says, his mouth making the decision for him. He counts out the money and watches the florist pick through the stems, unsure of what to do with the perky blooms once they're his.
“Mm.” Pansy wiggles her head and shoulders as though it’d let the alcohol percolate through her faster. “You
“You liked him.”
Harry pulled a ratty yellow book from the shelf. "You think
She pats his arm fondly. "This? This is nothing. I'm giving you the push you need. I've got Draco to thank for getting you to rock bottom." She takes a bite of the granola bar in his hand and chews it, her face twisted in a perpetual grimace.
Malfoy barely has a foot out the door before Harry collapses back onto his bed in relief. Malfoy hasn't left a stain this time—they got as far as the door frame—but he can't help thinking of Malfoy all the same.
"Well, I don't have furniture anymore."
"The bloody train wouldn't let me on," Draco said, huffing. "I waited around all week, but the door never opened once. I closed my eyes when I couldn't stay up anymore, and when I woke up again, I was here."
For drarrymicrofic prompt "remake". (48 words)
Harry comes in from the kitchen and hands Draco a glass of coffee that's mostly ice. Draco tilts his face up, to be kissed.
Except Draco wouldn't let him in.
“I didn’t mean to buy a bad thing.”
. What are the chances of that?"
Harry nudges his cock between Malfoy's thighs and exhales slowly. Merlin, it's good, even when it's boring. Sex is so damn simple.
“It’s not,” Draco shows him, brushing glitter over Potter’s hands, his scars. All his dazzling features, every inch of him a benediction.
"You have a
"Professor Malfoy, though." The Third Year gulped, a tremor in her jaw. "I—I thought he died happy. I thought—"
My palms open wet with tears.
"Yeah, he is. I just blew his two brain cells, so it'll take him a while to recover. Look, we'll have—" Ron rattles off about five menu items, none of which sound appetising to Harry. Though that's nothing on the restaurant. It's only that Harry hasn't properly tasted food since Draco left.
Harry's throat catches at the sight of the tiny wrinkly creases around Draco lids. He wants to kiss them, map them out under his mouth. When did everything Draco do light a fire in Harry's heart?
Look at this bloody angelic wanker. This is why Harry needs to get rid of Ron. The bloke has the libido of a golden retriever and a near-biblical belief that nothing can go wrong as long as he's home in time for Sunday roast at his mum's. He’d die of shame if he knew the trouble Harry got into without him.
"Coffee?" Draco asks instead, so they cross the street and wait in line behind a woman who forgets her wallet. The barista waves it off, saying, it's nothing; you're here all the time.
"Are you on the tube again?"
Am I the phoenix or the fire?
They're sprawled back on Harry's mattress on the floor, exhausted from smashing through the parlour wall to make one enormous great room that could, according to Draco, fit the whole Weasley brood if Ginny doesn't go off and adopt fifty crups.
"Attics are alright," Harry says, "though I don't have a real need for them. I use all my stuff." And attics were for memories, if Harry went by the boxes of generations-old photo albums and childhood crafts stacked high at the Burrow.
"Yeah," Pansy says.
"Yeah. I told you it was stupid—"
He shutters the blinds and locks the door with a wave of his wand before disappearing through my fireplace. I let the flames burn green for a second longer than I should. Then I follow him through.
Harry laughs. "That's a bit much, isn't it? Kindness? I expected an insult from you. Or at least a comment about how I forgot to put them in sleeves because my hand's scalding right now, Merlin."
"That's how I thought about 'Mione," Ron says. He raps his knuckles on the table. "She wanted time to herself; I gave her time to herself. Don't be pushy about it, I kept thinking. I dunno," he sighs. "Sometimes, I wonder if things would be different if I tried to get her to see my way. She'd develop these misguided assumptions like I was deliberately trying to provoke her by not folding the laundry or some shite. I usually got too mad about how off the mark she was about me, so I never tried convincing her. I just kept thinking, it's her damn fault she doesn't see things my way."
We were at his flat the other day when Draco tried to explain to me the shape of the universe. Draco applied for Muggle uni after Hogwarts and got into cosmology that way, so he was thinking about this type of problem all the time. I understood that it was his job, but why dedicate his life to uncovering the formulas to a time and  place he could never go, when he’d barely grown roots on his own planet?
Draco stepped forward to rest his hands on Harry’s arms, which were crossed.
Harry calls Ginny over so she can watch him Vanish the crud off his kitchen island.
Okay, maybe Harry was onto something. Draco crossed his arms. "Fine."
"Nah," Harry lies. Better not let Ron know about the new Malfoy obsession he's picked up.
Draco, and Draco couldn't have that. He jerked Harry's hand to his face and spit in the palm. He spit again, then led the hand back to his dick. "Get me hard, and maybe I'll fuck you," he said.
"Yeah, but I don't anymore," Harry says. "He's fucked up, but less so than me these days. And, I dunno. He's not trying to kill anyone anymore. I accept what he did as long as it stays in the past."
Ginny calls it
“Yeah, of course,” Harry says, rushed. They broke up three months ago, but Draco’s words are like Felix Felicis; he has a good feeling about this.
"Where did you even get that?" Draco asked instead.
“I don’t think a gun could have killed him.”
"Right," Draco said. "Hand it over," he sighed, extending his hand. Was he really going to eat toilet pizza? There was no fighting it; the answer was always yes when it came to Harry Potter.
she doesn't actually mean it. It's just the damn stress."
Malfoy's cock fits perfectly in Harry's grip, the exact length of the vertical span of Harry's palm. Harry splays his fingers and swirls his middle finger over the head, smearing precum, before lifting the finger to his mouth so he can suck the salt off.
I don’t bring you flowers anymore. But I did at first, with Granger of all people. We’d spread the stems over your grave before we drifted, lost in the isolation of our individual miseries. It was better this way, the quiet. I preferred her silence to the words spilt like spoiled honey from the lips of anyone who knew your name; words stuck into simpering sentences about the patience with which you taught, with which you led; about how that patience changed their lives.
"You've got three entire cabinets of

Ginny stands and shrugs into her heavy overcoat. "To
It was hard to see Mother’s face behind the shadow of her black veil. I squinted at it though I knew that behind the veil was another mask. Mother’s face was of granite and ice. It had lied to the Dark Lord. And I was just a boy who should have known better, so I never stood a chance.
Ron bangs his teaspoon. "Stop doing that," he says. "You look bloody maniacal, petting your purse like that."
“You. Your chest against mine. Waking up spooned in you. Breakfast. Not being alone.”
The bartender (Merlin, what was his name again?) narrows his eyes. "What do you say?"
. But he agrees instead and follows Eltanin in.
"Uh-huh," Hermione smirks. "Invite me over sometime, okay? I've got to make sure the whole place isn't silver and green."
"I’d pass on the absinthe,” Draco says.
Draco comes in two hours later with his back stiff and his neck tense. Ginny and Pansy loop back from their dancing to rest their feet, so the four of them slide into an empty booth in the back.
Neville Longbottom showed up at Draco's door on the second to last Thursday of September and said, "Well? Are you going to let me in?" Then he shoved his way in and made himself at home before the fireplace.
Harry pulls out the last remaining robe he has left in his closet, the one he wears to trials and memorials and traditional weddings. It's black and crimson with a lion's head embroidered on the lapels. He remembers loving it when he first bought it—the most expensive garment he's owned in his life—but the magic has washed out with time, and the lion roars in a languid, drunken way.
"Just once. Okay, maybe twice."
Draco sticks his face between the rails and looks down at the street. His legs swing. “Feels a bit like flying,” he says. He sounds like he’s shouting underwater, or else someone’s put bubblewrap over Harry’s ears.
But the book wasn't there.
The first time it happens, it’s over a coke. Draco squeezes the bottle, then eyes it, wary.
Scorpius takes a step back. “My father warned me about this,” he mutters, jostling Albus with his elbow.
move,” Draco says. “The wrist-flick at the end, like casting a warming charm. It’s good, isn’t it? Gives the whole embarrassment of having to fix your hair in public a bit of a flair. God, I should get it patented.”
"Jesus Christ, Malfoy. If I'd known you were a prude—"
She cuts his hair later in the bathroom. She uses a razor and shears it all the way to the root. "Like mowing a lawn," she says, "if I were a Muggle." But she's not, and he's not, so all of his hair grows back in an hour.
Draco's fingers curled tightly around his book. His shoulders tensed with mistrust.
. Who the bloody hell
"I don't think so," Malfoy says.
Harry gets off his broom and casts, winds and mists and the wet smell of grass uncurling under a purple sunrise erupting from the tip of his wand. He gets back on the broom and watches the number of co-riders climb to a precipice: one-thousand, two-thousand, three-thousand. Ten thousand join in the last five minutes, and then the screen goes black. Harry pants, thoughts of terrorism or anti-magic bombs leaving him out of breath and panicked. But then the screen lights up again with the words: "Sorry for the inconvenience."
"Thank fucking god all that shite's finally gone," Ginny sighs, spreading her arms out and spinning around the room in glee. "Pansy—you know, she's an interior designer?—says that a blind crup could have made better choices than that catastrophe you hired." Ginny squeezes his hand. "I wouldn't worry. You'll find a new designer, one that you love, and it'll...it'll...it won't stay empty for long."
"Wait—" but the world condenses to a single black point, and they're in Harry's room: four-poster bed, fireplace, the wireless left on something soft.
Potter takes the report and continues to his desk. Padma stops him, and Draco watches them laugh over something Potter says before Padma moves on, smiling. Ron sits on Potter’s desk an hour later, loudly joking about the birthday party he has planned for his daughter. The alarms blare sometime in the afternoon — illegal potions, two dead and counting — and Potter sets down his coffee, reaching for his wand with the same coolness as he would for a pen or a biscuit.
“I made it myself,” Draco said, soft. “The cakes. I’ve been practising.”
The route ends in front of his flat, his breath gone, full circle.
The train pulled up fast as it ever did, though, to Harry, it seemed to slide forward in slow motion, every second stretched until it finally stopped fifty feet in front of him. The doors opened.
Of course, of course, of course. How obvious can the future be before you realise it's repeating itself? I am my father's son, and Malfoys are destined to die wanting. My father, for power. Of course, what I want is Harry Potter's love.
"Just because I'm Harry Potter and I'm losing my magic doesn't mean I'm a defenceless babe. I'm a normal bloke who wants his morning coffee —"
that. You're a bloody menace."
“The eggs I acquired from a farm in East Anglia. The chocolate, precisely five-hundred milligrams of it, I had delivered from—”
"You're not going to get in that way," Harry said.
“One week should suffice,” Malfoy agrees.
“He could’ve said that of half of London,” Draco said, eyeing his fingernails. “There’s nothing special in how you take your tea. There’s nothing special about you, really. You’re about as dull as a bag of plain crisps.”
Draco laughs, “Oh, alright.” He smears it over his neck, his hips, the Mark.
Malfoy looks back at him, his mouth agape, before swinging his leg over the handle. He closes his eyes as his face passes through a cloud, his arse bouncing over the seat. Harry summons a stronger breeze, and those twin globes bounce again as though on an invisible cock.
“… and the dragon figurine contained a small Muggle recording device that circumvented magical interference at Hogwarts by way of a radiomagnetic repulsor—”
It isn’t until Draco’s five-year mark that he’s finally let on the field. Even then, he’s only allowed because they’re severely short-staffed, and Draco, despite it all, is tenured. Potter’s surrounded when they swarm the Muggle warehouse, twelve guns emptying into his chest as he holds out his wand mid-slash. There’s an acrid smell of burning skin, and Draco’s vision bursts in blues and reds, loud bangs, his own hoarse voice shouting something in between a Protego and a Stupefy.
"Err—actually, could I get—" Harry pauses, finger still extended, though he cannot for the life of him remember what he usually orders. He doesn't recall ever ordering, actually. The drinks simply...come.
. But you act like you were happier when Voldemort was alive."
“Yeah, I mean, this morning, when you added blueberries to the pancakes. I’ve never thought of doing that.”
"Do you even hear yourself? You never text me back. Ginny's getting a divorce just for a chance to date Pansy, but you never even call me by my
Harry lets Malfoy kiss him before shoving him away. "Why do you care what I do with my money?"
Harry grabs his wrist. "Don't go. Please."
Malfoy blinks, his long lashes brushing beneath bruised lids. Harry lifts his hand to rub the bit of sleep left in the corner of Malfoy's left eye but catches his thumb on Malfoy's lower lip instead. They're smooth and well taken care of but already a little red. Harry wants to ruin them with his own. He takes a stumbling step forward, bracing his arms against the door and lurching toward Malfoy's face, hoping Malfoy picks up the cue.
My snout drags over old floorboards, itching for a sneeze that, when it comes, shakes the flame from their wicks. Beyond the door, the dew smells of grass. Moonflowers bloom with their mouths wide open; night beetles burrow through soil.
"Did I try the door—" Draco harrumphed. He reached for Harry's shoulders, to shake them, but his hands passed right through.
His watch says five-pm, which means it’s one, here. In his mind, he sees Harry swing his leg over a broom and surge toward the setting sun. Draco soars behind him, arm outstretched, just out of reach—like a monkey grasping for the moon.
“Let’s get the yee-fucking-haw out of here, then,” Draco says.
"No. Well, not yet."
"He's talented with his tongue, alright? Can we drop it now?" And he also, he
"I can do another speech," Harry says. He picks up the parchment: income equality, climate change, powdered dragon puff deregulation. It all sounds very smart. Harry tucks it into his pocket.
The bartender mixes him another and slides it over without another word, his mouth pulled in a frown. The guilt itches at Harry enough that he slips an extra hundred over the counter, as an apology, before going home alone.
“Oh, I bet the blood starches clean off.”
"Something like that," Harry mutters, embarrassed by how easily Ginny guessed the truth.
He slumped forward, his fingers pressed to his temples. “Give me a moment, will you? Please.”
I'm dying for a drink."
"Wait!" she says. "It's about BroomBod. Our reports say that you've taken it offline. Can I speak to you for a few minutes about—"
When life’s a chase, you play it like a game.
“Invite me over,” Harry says when the first corals of sunset saturate the horizon, and Draco starts looking toward the cruise ship, knowing soon it will depart, and then, and then.
Ginny says the rooms will fill, but all that collects is dust and takeout boxes, piling up in the corners. Ginny sends over a stack of furniture catalogues, and Harry thumbs through them in a daze. Nothing
Harry takes a final look at the blank wall before Draco leads them to the kitchen, where Draco Vanishes the pantry. The laundry room is next, then the guest bedroom and linen closets, each replaced with a perfectly blank wall.
and isn’t that interesting too, how the shape of worth changes with the seasons, changes when you’re in love?
I didn’t push the subject. Narcissia got what she deserved and nothing more.
"Fine," Harry snaps. He doesn't know why he's putting up with Malfoy when he could've just fucked anyone else in his DMs with no trouble at all.
Harry steeled his breath, his shoulders stiffening in resolve. Enough with being selfish. Harry could do this for Draco, because what Harry required above all was for Draco to be happy, even in death.
A growl builds at the back of Harry's throat. He hates it when Ginny acts like Harry's the biggest idiot in the room.
Draco says that you should wash up. There’s blood under your nails and matted in your hair, and Draco doesn’t mind, honest, but Hermione will ask, and you know how she worries.
, Draco. Why did you end up here? On this floor? Before this very room?"
"No. Ah. I got rid of it myself."
The hour swings past seven. Across the street, I can hear the swish/clang of Madam Malkin closing up shop, punctual as always. I’d be doing the same if I hadn’t Harry Potter smudging fingerprints along the length of my display case counter. He stalls his wandering to linger over my wand, nestled haphazardly in the valley of an open text:
"I know that," Draco mumbles. But he's helpless to the gnawing in his heart. He's tired. He wants to give in, to settle down with who he really is, and live in his own bones. It's not so bad. He's not so bad a person, even if he never thanks people for their kindness.
Draco unfolds a handkerchief with his mother’s monogram and wipes mustard from Harry’s face, though it would be faster if he Scourgified it instead.
"So are you." Harry can smell the sweet souring of wine on Malfoy's breath. He imagines Malfoy out with the other campaign volunteers, probably celebrating at someone's flat if how Malfoy is dressed is any indication. If he doesn't do anything, Malfoy will leave and go back to having fun with people who aren't Harry. And then Harry would be alone again, lying around in bed watching the dust collect over his eyes.
Harry hangs up.
"You've seen mine," Draco repeats, still panting, but he's treading water now, his head barely breaching the waves. He spits again, clinging to Harry's shoulders as he gives up trying to do it on his own.
“Alright, I won’t. Since you asked so nicely.”
"It's as good as it ever is," Harry says. There's something disingenuous about the speech, but he can't put why into words.
They were having breakfast like they always did: Draco carefully cutting the crusts off his toast, Harry upending half the sugar into his tea, Pansy snapping at every noise that distracted from her paper. (Pansy wasted no time in setting up house rules now that she was an official resident, though there was only one item on the list: keep the bloody toilet seat down after you flush.)
Draco says his room's the third one from the elevator, though it's not like Harry needs to know, because he follows him there. "Do you like this," Harry says to the arch of a spine. "Do you like me," he asks the skin of Draco's neck. Do you, do you still like me when I'm drunk. Do you like me enough to say it to a crowd.
"I don't think you're actually evil," Harry finds himself saying, "but I still think you can do better than politics."
“It feels good to get rid of things. It feels good to stand on my own.”
"I'm sick," Harry says. "Not terminally ill. Just — magic sick. Like my magic's… disappearing. I dunno exactly how. Nobody does, anyway; St Mungo's says they've never heard of it before. Also, I think I'm gay."
His hands still. He leans back and meets my stare.
"I hate politics," Harry sulks. "I hate you for dragging me back into it." But he doesn't protest further; it's not her fault that half her votes come from people who think she keeps Harry on a short leash. She can't escape Harry's fame. That's the price of his friendship.
Potter furrows his brows. “Was it not you?”
lemon—"
"Why?" Draco crosses his arms, but the wrinkle in his brow spells more concern than pity. "I'm not questioning your decision, but why don't you want to?"
He curls a finger under my chin.
Harry doesn't think they've swapped. "I was an orphan," he says, "never
"No," Draco says. "You can't just—"
They do a round of shots. Then another round of rum, because shots are like boobs: best with one in each hand.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione says. Her voice warms now that she knows she's won. "Get a grip, will you? Your life won't suddenly turn around because you're in another hemisphere. You're far too rich for that."
“Invaluable. Everything has a price,” Malfoy scoffs, his composure tempered despite his choked words under Harry’s fist.
"Did you try the door?"
"His type, huh," Ginny nods conspiratorially.
"Close your eyes, then," Harry says. But he doesn't stop Draco from tearing down the wallpaper.
They aren't friends. But they could be, with time.
They jerk apart. The publicist sweeps Harry away.
“No, it’s okay. Wear the…?”
"—which is
Draco blushes. "I was terrified of the Dark Lord."
"Don't say it like that," she says. She pulls on a bright yellow hoodie that's cropped at the waist. "It's only that she's helped me realise things."
"SHOTS," Ginny shouts back.
"I'll be there," Harry interrupts.
. Draco sat down on the edge of Harry's bed and took the book in his hand. It was as beautiful as he remembered it, the worn mustard canvas, the blue of the end band, the silver-patterned paste paper that shimmered as though wind moved through it.
Draco looks down at their shoes, his voice taking on a disaffected quality. "Mum's death day was yesterday. Nobody knows that. The grave marker says it's a week later, but that's the day we took her off life support. I don't count that. It was yesterday. How did you know to bring narcissus?"
will have the answer to your question someday?"
"I know," Malfoy says. "I thought I heard wrong when Stella said that you were using it. You just didn't seem the type. Too wild." Malfoy pushes his hair back to smirk at Harry before turning to the broom. He waves a hand through the atmosphere again. "Can you adjust the conditions so that it feels like we're a dozen metres up?"
. It's not loyal at all—"
"I'm not your Healer," Harry laughs. Though self-medicating sounds like a pretty solid plan. He Vanishes their empty takeaway boxes and gives the counter a good Scourgify, not recalling if he cleaned it since the last time he had someone over, and they—well.
For all his initial hesitation, Malfoy is on Harry as soon as they step past the threshold. Harry pushes the door shut behind them, his fingers thick under Malfoy's shirt. There's wine—a red, maybe a cabernet—on Malfoy's tongue too, and Harry slides theirs together until Malfoy pushes them apart.
"I know it’s a lot," Draco said. "But once I'm done, I'll shrink it down properly with magic."
So Malfoy really does volunteer for Hermione's campaign.
The kittens don’t like Harry yet. It’s only his third time over, and they’ve still a hiss of feral from the streets.
Harry rolls his eyes. “I know.”
"You're going to make me do all the work," Harry tries to laugh, but it comes out all croaky and hoarse, his heart rabbiting in his throat. He crawls into Draco's lap and wraps a hand around both of their cocks.
you're high, I can smell that skunk from a mile away, but don't you start your shift at the club in an hour?"
"Order it off the internet, probably," Harry said around a mouthful of biscuit. "Shouldn’t be too hard for her; it's super popular, so there's a million reprints of it." He doused his tea with milk and added a sickening amount of honey before guzzling it down, Adam's apple bobbing with each swallow. "What're you reading now?"
Draco stood before Harry’s desk. “It’s almost impressive, really, how much you care for this country, despite how little it cares in return. The howlers alone—”
"Ah," Ron says, leaning back. "I can see how that works." The server drops off a plate of tuna poke. Ron grabs a crisp, chewing. "So, what went wrong with Malfoy?"
"No thanks," Harry says to Hermione when she offers him her handkerchief. Parvati waits under an arch overflowing with pink and peach peonies as Lavender walks up the aisle with her mother, an instrumental rendition of Celestina Warbeck's
Ron makes a face. "Merlin, Harry."
Harry kisses him. The world bursts in colours around him, light, dizzying and forbidden as a shaken can of soda stolen from Dudley's school bag.
"Do you hate this?" Draco lifts his arm. His sleeve is a gauzy green, the kind pine trees are made of.
Ron gapes, a half-chewed crisp mashed over his tongue. "Blimey. That's more than I make in a
“You don’t think I’d eat a burger?”
He’s winding the ring around his finger; the silver one, with the Greengrass crest.
Draco looked down at his hands again. They were soft and pale and like new, like they’d never been used.
"A ton of
Harry shrugged. He could smell a cigarette, but he wasn't sure if it was Draco's because he couldn't look away from Draco's face.
Harry’s always moved fast. Always been a bit too intense. And Draco’s always been — well, Draco — so snogging behind the skatepark is just something that happens — because. Because of course Harry knows where Draco skates. And of course Draco recognises him. And of course they take their snark to the sidelines and of course Harry gets handsy and grabs the front of Draco’s shirt and their eyes lock and their lips next and —
"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"
Yeah, okay. This is it. This is what he wants. The whole damn package, scars and all.
this and
"Anyone else, and I'd be checking them into St. Mungo's," Ron says with a sigh, "but I wouldn't be your best mate if I didn't know that you've always acted on instinct. So why did you let him go?"
"Fine," Harry spat back. "Fine."
"Yeah, alright," Malfoy says and turns back around.
Harry doesn't hear the rest of the sentence. His eyes have wandered back to the entrance, where the bouncer stamps the hand of yet another disappointing blond. Annoyed, Harry pulls out his mobile and starts scrolling through his texts. "You up?" one asks. "Your mouth. Increeeedible. Nearly as incredible as my dick. Tonight?" another proposes. Harry nearly deletes them both, then he thinks better of it and texts the incredible dick bloke back. He's way hotter; what was Harry thinking, coming onto the bartender like that?
Draco flicks his wrist and Vanishes the paper away, declaring, "Nothing new in the paper today." Into the coffee go two heavy pours of cream, followed by an accidental splash of citrus when Harry cuts an orange down to generous portions. Out of the corner of his eye, yesterday's Draco twirls Harry into his arms over and over again, the Italian coast foaming at their feet. Harry grins, nudging the frame with a playful pinky as he gathers the mugs in a levitation spell (one yellow, one chipped).
Hermione burst into the room, a heavy scroll in her hand. “Harry, Malfoy, I’ve discovered—oh fuck it.” She walked back out. “C'mon, Pansy, let’s just finish this one off ourselves.”
I spread Potter's fingers. I cracked his knuckles. I locked eyes with old Mrs Longbottom from across the courtroom and gave her the stinkiest stink eye I could manage with Potter's thick brows. Still no reaction. When the Chief Warlock banged his gavel and ended the day's session, I got onto Potter's feet and followed everyone to the Floos.
"Everyone knows that," Ginny says without missing a beat. She doesn't even look up from her phone.

" Ginny drums her fingers, her nose perking up. "You still have those joints from California? Or at least get me something to drink. Nothing too strong—it's goddamn midday—but, a mimosa, pretty-please? Something to take the edge off. I've had the worst headache all weekend."
It isn’t a big deal (a single sprig of mistletoe hung under the doorframe), but Draco avoids it year after year, edging around it like a taunt even as the faces change around him. This year he’s in the kitchen—flicking wary glances at it like he always does—when he catches on Harry through the other room. Their eyes meet; Harry’s mouth curling, warm as a promise.
It isn’t something either of them would have done, on their own. Scorpius reads it in a picture book. He says, “Please?”, and a small village rises from lumpy pillows and wrinkled sheets.
their voices faraway like from the bottom of a canyon. But the sun dawns with time, and Harry with it, heavy and warm, as though Ron knit a jumper between his kidneys before he stitched him back up.
Glorious, isn't it? My first thought in Potter's head, and it was about kitty crap.
"No."
Pansy huffs into her Floo-Along, the flames shifting and tickling her ear. "No, of course not. That's the bloody joy of being rich, isn't it? That I can do whatever I want and it's all my choice. But I don't need to tell
"You can say sorry to me. I don't mind. I won't think you're weak for saying it."
“I’ll miss you,” Harry says to the smog-grey dread in Draco’s eyes, though Draco only laughs and says that Harry won’t get the chance; such is the irony of fearing the end of all fears.
Potter strides forward, the fringes of his chaps swinging and slapping against his thick thighs. He tips his hat at Pansy before turning to Draco and running a sheepish hand against his stubbled cheek. “Err. You texted me? Three cowboy emojis, and then these Apparition coordinates?”
?" Harry's face burns. "You
"Eh," Ron shrugs. "Ginny convinced me he's not a terrible guy. Did you know that she's seeing Parkinson?" He shudders. "She scares the fuck out of me. I keep on wanting to cover up my balls around her."
Draco's barely picked up the phone before Harry's speaking. "All my furniture is gone," Harry says.
“You could’ve sliced him up like you did with me—blood dripping down his snakey face before you snuff the light out of his eyes. You don’t need to drag it out. Two seconds is enough for a lifetime’s worth of satisfaction, I reckon.”

Draco put away the book and walked back down the stairs. He reheated the water and poured them two fresh cups of tea. Then Harry came back, and they drank them together with biscuits with little bits of hardened treacle chips.
Draco narrows uncomprehending eyes, shivering, his mouth opening —
"You make it easy to hate you," Harry says. "Even I know better than to show up at an ex's restaurant."
“Apologises, sir,” Draco said, sounding anything but sorry, “the three-pm requires a change of robes.” He tapped his ScrollNote (standard Ministry issue for all executive assistants) and added, “It’s for the children’s ward. Remember? You insisted on anything the children wanted, even if it involved rescheduling the Prime Minister to put on a hippogriff costume.”
"I fuck plenty," Draco said. He
We went downstairs to the kitchen, where I reheated the chicken I made last night, and we ate it with sliced apples, because I forgot about the salad. Then we went to bed, and the next day arrived in the night.

at us.” Nearly his whole body wraps around Harry’s arm; Harry’s practically dragging them down the street.
"Sure," Harry says. He polishes off his Manhattan and orders them another round with his credit card. He hates talking about money with Ron.
Harry wants to say something about how peculiar it is to sit across from Draco Malfoy and want nothing more than to hold his hand. Nobody would believe he skipped out on the War Memorial for a tiny flat with his childhood bully and a bucket under the leaky ceiling. This shouldn’t happen at all, given their past, but a yawn overtakes his thoughts, and he blinks in the aftermath of it, drowsy and content. Maybe Draco would let him stretch out on the bed too, and sleep. He’s got nowhere to go except here.
Harry sat back on his heels and wiped his mouth. "Hard enough now?"
Inside Harry’s mind is an ocean and only an ocean.
“Alright,” Harry laughs.
"Draco Malfoy didn't know what he was doing," Harry Potter's mouth said at my trial. "He was young and immature and fell in with the wrong people. He's very sorry."
“Six.” There is Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius and Lupin and Tonks, Fred.
Draco slapped Harry’s arse. "Get on with it."
Draco laughs, voice warbling a little hysterically. Harry loves that he's responsible for the smile. Like Draco's wearing a part of Harry.
“I didn’t,” Malfoy says under Veritaserum, his eyes half-lidded, a smug smile spreading across his face thick as clotted cream.

Ginny falls apart into peels of laughter. "Okay, okay," she gasps, "how many times?"
Draco's face is pinched, his mouth open and drooling. He's not pretty but he's all for Harry. "You're going to burn me up inside," Harry murmurs as he slots their mouths, their tongues sliding together. He's so close that he just might die.
That was an easy no. All the good and bad of a person's life didn’t just cancel each other out. They stacked up, one by one, to be judged by line. And yet.
"Harry. Harry! Where are you?" a woman's voice calls from backstage. "The Prophet wants to talk to you. We need to—"
"You don't need the money."

"Can we

"No! Er, I mean. Shouldn't you offer me tea instead? Isn't that what a polite host would do? Make tea?"
"What was your question again?"

Harry’s mouth quirks. “Right.” He continues around the lilies, careful to avoid the skull. The snake unfurls leathery wings, eyes glinting jewel-green. Harry moves on, up Draco’s arm, to his mouth.
So, there it was: proof that Harry was his thief. But with the evidence laid before him, Draco found he no longer cared. So what if Harry stole a few books? If the thief was Harry, Draco was happy to share. He would share everything with Harry.
If you're going to Vanish things you hate, you might as well Vanish the whole house."
Harry slipped a thumb in his jean pockets. He didn’t quite meet Draco’s eye. "Pansy says you're going crazy over a few missing books."
“I don’t know about you, but I find it hard to trust anything anymore, not when nothing makes sense when you look at it close enough. But I had to get home, so I wanted a snack, and while digging through your pantry (you’d benefit from brushing up on your organisation charms, by the way), I found the broom.”
"I don't know anything about numbers," Harry says. He pulls the cigarette from her hand and Vanishes it.
Draco laughs softly and motions Harry closer so that Harry's sitting on the bed next to him with his legs off the side. "Not good at politics,

Hermione finishes the biscuit. "Did you infuse these with Pepper-Up?"
The Handbook on Going Undercover in the Muggle Suburbs, Section 2A:
On one of the days (though he couldn't say which), Harry itches to get back on the BroomBod. He manages to disconnect it from the network, but then all he has is an ordinary broom—and one that is only fractionally as good as his old Firebolt. The whole thing is so utterly stupid that he nearly smashes the thing to splinters. But he rides it anyway because it's the only broom he has, conjuring a roomful of atmosphere and wishing himself outside instead.
Harry looks and finds no room for argument, so he lets Draco pretend that nothing's changed between them as Harry pushes past one stuck door after the next, parading them through the endless hall of empty upstairs bedrooms. Then it's back down the stairs and through the drawing room before they finally stop outside the gym, the only room that Harry's left untouched.

Draco blinked. "How? What? By boiling water?" Did everyone take Draco for an idiot?
They don’t know you like I do. They don’t know about the time you lost your temper when I failed yet again to conjure a Patronus. You said, “Fuck, Draco. We’ve been together five years, and you still can’t think of a single happy memory?”
"Decoration!" Ron laughs. "No,
Harry turned back to me and took my hand into his. His palm was rough, like wool. “I know you didn’t.”
Draco's cheeks grew hot. "I don't know myself either, alright? I just know I need them. Merlin, I knew you wouldn't understand, I—"
Pansy?
Mother raised a heavy hand to her chin, my father’s ring flashing a warning. She said, “You should not have told me.”
Harry cracks open the can and swigs. “He’s really good,” he says, his mouth bitter from beer and maybe envy. He swallows. “Really fucking good, actually. He fell a couple times, so he didn’t manage to place, but only cuz he pushed his tricks too far. No one moved like him, Ron.”

"You've really gone and Vanished out everything you own, haven't you? It's either that, or you're calling me from the bottom of a well. You're echoing like crazy."
Malfoy sends a takeaway box flying to Harry, who catches it.
“You’re not supposed to say please,” Draco said, swallowing.
"I'm pretty sure that I overpay him for this service," Harry whispers back, jabbing her with his elbow.
Harry scratched the back of his head with a sheepish hand. His shirt—the same as from Hogwarts, except now two sizes too small—stretched across his chest. He looked incredibly stupid, and Draco felt incredibly stupid for looking.
“Found you,” Harry says or doesn’t say. Draco can’t be sure because, in his next breath, Harry orders drinks for him and his dozen friends, as it is his birthday.
"Well." This is the part that gets dodgy. Harry isn't the type to give up, and yet... "I don't want to be a creep," he decides after a moment.
It's hard to choose a colour even when there are so many to choose from. Harry says no to sky-blue, no to canary-yellow. No to flushed-pink and no to fog-grey.
“Draco.”
"Oh. The Victorian terrace."
"I feel like I'm robbing a mortuary," Ron says about Harry's bar at 12 Grimmauld Place. He's not far from the truth. The countertop is a white, veiny marble, corpse-pale and clammy to the touch. Ron pours them each two fingers of bourbon and makes a face at the dust on the glass before knocking it back.
," one of them says. Harry can't help but snort. "Didn't know you rode but could've guessed from your thighs," a former hookup texts, appending a smirk emoji in invitation. Harry scrolls down far enough on his notifications that he falls asleep.
Number Twelve squeezed into view. Draco followed Harry inside, his eyes dragging over two trainers and a pair of boots, an umbrella stand, and keys to a motorbike thrown in a bowl of lemon drops.
“Yep.”
"Did you?"
that," Draco growled. "I. Didn't—" he dipped a finger in the lube and pressed in. Harry hissed, his cock jerking against his belly. "Neville—" Draco said.
He kissed me after the next one. Took my hands, still caked with another man’s blood, and pressed his lips against them like a benediction. Then he sucked my cock.
Harry finished off the slice and threw the crust behind him with a regal flick of his wrist reminiscent of a pizza rat king sitting on his toilet throne. He pulled another piece from the half-eaten box and lifted it to his lips, his eyes never leaving Draco's. Then he paused, his brow furrowed as though seeing Draco for the first time.
your phone?"
"No, not evil," Harry says. "I'm trying to date him, for Merlin's sake. Why would I think he's evil—"
Malfoy doesn't return the favour. He rolls over and catches his breath against a pillow, his round arse red from Harry's palms. Harry crawls over to him and pulls Malfoy's thighs closed, rubbing between them with lube.
Two men brawl up on the street ahead. The one in the wifebeater seizes the flaming redhead by the collar and —
“I thought you wanted to stand on your own.”
"Harry talks so much about you," Ginny says.
Ginny inhales—coughing—then hands the joint back to Harry. "Why the fuck would he know? We're getting a divorce."

Mother’s Paris parlour was a riotous affair of colour. Verdant walls grew busy bouquets of chrysanthemum and baby’s-breath. Peacock feathers and peonies filled vases of jade and green glass. They crowded the fireplace mantle, jingling whenever the Floo flared to life—which wasn’t often—as I was the only one permitted in. Limiting visitors to family was the sort of psychological self-flagellation that tradition bequeathed a widow. But still—the decor was unexpectedly garish, especially after the greys of Malfoy Manor.
too. He's practically Hermione's go-to advisor on any scandal now—"
Hermione takes a sip and sighs. She’s so upset that she doesn’t even care if Draco’s poisoned her.
Hermione purses her lips. "Quite."
“Enough with the sports commentating,” Harry scowls.
"That—" Draco choked.
Harry parks the car in front of the big restaurant window and holds down the horn until Hermione looks up from where she's waiting inside and scowls at them.
"It's like you're a bloody first-year," Draco mock-grumbles, covering the walls in repeating neon-green tiles of a hairy dick. Harry snorts, rolling over to look down at Draco, whose face is scrunched from holding back a laugh too. Harry watches that face morph into an expression just short of relaxed. His gaze drops to Draco's mouth.
“We’ve got time, haven’t we?” Harry asks.
The sky’s a muddling of mauve and mulberry; the sun in iridescent downfall. Some kid down the block’s blowing bubbles, and one floats up, brushing against Draco’s cheek, before popping. It doesn’t make a sound, but Harry winces; feels it ricochet against his ribcage.
"Hermione's in Dublin for a conference," Harry said, absentmindedly flipping the page on a picture book of snakes.
"Let's do it, then," Harry said, standing. The door stood before him. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and reached for the knob, twisting it under his hand before he could change his mind again.
“I’m starving. You planning on ordering anything?”
Ginny rolls her eyes. "Yeah, uh-huh. You're
He lets me go to trace a finger down the old scar. “Came here straight from St Mungo’s. Drove me crazy, thinking of you,” he says. He wets his lips. I want to kiss him so bad that it’s hard to breathe.
“Okay, that’s enough,” I say, laughing.
"Please?"
"Did not," Harry insisted with a cross shake of his head. "Was jus sitting 'ere. Ya know. Finders keepers. You lose you snooze."
Out tumbles, “I love you,” cracking raw between us.
Draco takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes. "Is it always like this?"
"It's not. You're right. Sorry. I don't know why I called. I know I've been shit to you, and yeah. I don't want to be shitty, but you know. Shit is shitty."
"Merlin. Alright, I—"
"Err—yes," Harry fumbles.
How did things go so wrong with Draco?
. Bam! He’s dead. Bloody bastard didn’t suffer for a second of it.”
Should. Shouldn’t. Those two words passed judgment over every one of my choices. I should’ve befriended Harry. I shouldn’t have lost against him at Quidditch. I should’ve killed Dumbledore. I shouldn’t have led Vince into that room to die. I should’ve taken up my father’s seat at Wizengamot. I shouldn’t have joined the Aurors, and I absolutely shouldn’t have asked Harry to marry me.
"Oh, shut up, Potter," Draco says. "I know you're trying to goad me into letting you in. Come on up then. I'll make you your bloody coffee."
No response.
"Wait," the valet says. "Don't you want me to get you off too?" He's standing with his pants down on the sidewalk outside Harry's front door, his eyes teary from the force of his ejaculation and his face a blotchy, blushing mess.
Luna flicks ash off her knees, elbow knocking into Draco’s shin. Draco’s sitting next to Luna, but maybe a hand back, so he’s half-hidden behind her curls. He’s wearing thin blue swimming trunks that ride up his skinny thighs, his toes dug in the sand, his hands pressed beside them. Harry follows the grains up his left wrist and stops. Draco’s not tugging on it—like he’s forgotten about it, for once. Harry hasn’t, but he’s surprised with how much he wants to. It’s like if he can just forget about the Mark, then he can pretend the war never happened. And then…
"Ron's given up on me," Harry says. He checks the rearview mirror before changing lanes. The driver behind him flips him off, and Harry gives them the finger right back. "Hermione, though."
Harry unclenches his grip and watches with satisfaction as Malfoy stumbles back into his chair. “Confess, and we’ll shave five years off your sentence,” he says. “Wear an Oculus Cam, and we’ll let you walk out the door today.”
"You asked," Harry laughs. God, he feels good. Sometimes he just wants to push Ron to his limits and watch him squirm.

His skin is made of eggshell, his eyes of marble grey. Too lovely to touch but smooth, you imagine, and you would be wrong.
Draco twisted around, whirling through Harry in an agitated flurry. He skidded to a halt down the hall before sweeping back in one smooth swish of silver. A faint wince of annoyance crossed his face when he recognised Harry. "Why are you here?"
Harry looked up behind wet lashes. "Not if I shut you up first," he said. He wrapped his lips around Draco's cock and sucked, his tongue swirling around the tip before he took down more of the cock into his mouth.

Draco serves him a look so utterly pitying that Harry can practically hear him thinking

I’m shivering. A silvery strand extends from Draco’s wand, and the loss of it splits my chest into two.

It’s one of those situations that makes you think, of course. Like — of course pi is 3.1415 and so on and so forth. Of course the universe is expanding at approximately 70 km/s/Mpc and of course the scale of space itself is what is changing. Numbers like that don’t budge when you beg. Euler’s constant is exactly that — a constant. Some things never change.
“That’s what they were like,” Draco defends with a tiny growl, though he knows he’s taken the metaphor too far. He’s always doing that, roping people in only to buck them off when he rides too fast. Like a bloody American bronco.
You don’t know much anymore, at least not in the way you did before, but you smell the worry percolating on his neck, so you follow the scent of lemon and soap to the sink where your hands drip blood and dirt down the drain until they run clear as rain. Draco stinks like relief behind you, and you think that maybe you are like a tide caught between the push and pull of the moon.
The door opened with a click. A gentle hand squeezed Harry's, almost warm, before wind brushed over chapped lips. "Thank you, Harry," Draco said. "I love you."

“Of course I don’t. I’m on Pepperup.”
Harry half-expects her to hang up. But she lets the static roll long enough between them that the silence turns apologetic. Familiar.
Hermione wipes her mouth. "We agreed that you deserve to be

much money."
"Yeah," Harry agrees. "We're practically deranged."
Draco snaked a hand down Harry’s pants (which were under Harry’s trousers, in case you were wondering).
This nonsense is for @floydig, who won @avenueofesc’s @drarrystrugglefest word count betting pool. I tried to make something you’d like but um here you are.
She hands the tin to Harry.
Draco’s clawed hand hovers over the flame as it licks up toward him. Any closer and his palm will start to sweat as though he’s melting.
The following week is so unbearably dull that Harry barely remembers what happens on which days. He does a photoshoot for Wheaties, then he models for a perfume that smells like arse. Ron says that if Harry keeps accepting sponsorships, nobody will trust what he endorses, which Harry thinks is a good thing. Harry's reputation could use some humbling. Then maybe he can ride a stationary broom without the world falling to pieces.
The whole package shows up on Harry's front steps on a day the rain's coming down in sheets. Draco comes in dripping on Harry's shoes piled up at the entryway, his own raincloud a mess of tears down his cheeks. "You're a fucking coward, Potter," Draco sniffs, his arms wrapped around himself, quivering. "Can't handle a few scars without—"
"What—oh. I lied. I broke it off with him a couple of days ago," Draco says. "It wasn't fair to him. It was pretty obvious to everyone that I was still hung up on you, but I thought it would be easier if I kept pretending—"
"Like you care a rat’s arse what happens to him. You never liked him. You never like anything I—"
In the morning is half-brushed teeth and jumpers pulled inside-out on the stumble to the Burrow. “The things I do for a Molly Weasley breakfast,” Draco pats his stomach lovingly an hour later. His words are drowned out by Rose’s wild squeal as Scorpius catapults a runny egg to her open book. Harry considers the ramifications of scolding his son over Christmas breakfast and instead smears a cinnamon roll over Draco’s face. Time blurs by then—one chest-aching guffaw after another—and not just because he breaks his specs on a whole quiche flung at his face (Ron’s fault). Molly only pretends to scowl, because messes don’t matter so much when everything can be put back together with a lazy swish of a wand.
"The numbers say there's a chance. Even when the odds are one in a million, there's a chance. Do you need me to do anything?"
Draco sighed, laying a head on Harry's shoulder, silvery wisps of hair tickling at Harry's neck. "This corridor gives me the creeps. You couldn't add a few candles in here, bright it up a bit?"
“I’m getting dressed. Ron’s set something up for me at Hog’s Head.”
“Merlin,” I laugh. I pull him in by the elbow, where the thread is thinning. A while longer, and it’ll tear. Then we’ll patch it up.
For @drarrymicrofic prompt: parallel.
"This is not a library, and I am no librarian. Why you think you can barge in to—"
“Yeah,” he said. He tucked his hands away in his pockets, to hide them.
I was happy. I was the happiest I’ve ever been. But I didn’t know how to explain that happiness wasn’t worth the pain of its end, because nothing good lasts forever. Every memory sours with time.
"Your mother ruined herself with liquor."
Draco gets off when the train stops again. A dark-haired man struggles with his metrocard up ahead at the turnstile. A woman rolls her green eyes at Draco behind circular-rimmed glasses, muttering about tourists. Above ground, Draco unlocks his broom from the rack and takes to the skies, the sun setting in yellows and greens behind a jagged range of skyscrapers, a lightning bolt flashing across an advert for a potion that's more water than water.
The alarms in Draco’s lab at the manor went off as soon as they landed. Draco should have known Potter was reckless enough to side-along unannounced, but, in his defence, he was distressed, and the alarms were

"I didn't," Harry says. "I swear, I didn't. I was lucky, or unlucky, I guess. And I—"
"The sky was blue too, over Wiltshire,” Draco says. “On occasion, anyway,” which is to say that their childhoods were nothing alike, nothing drawn in parallel, nothing to pick out and say, “Me too! We’re the same, after all.”
"Picked up someone recently," Harry says. "The valet. Wanker wouldn’t let me drive home."
“The case! The Neo-Death Eaters—” Harry panted.
I don’t like how you say my name when I’m awake: the P spat, the Ts whetted, and every word circling, painful in their civility. In the day, you say my name, but it’s not yours or mine. Others take my name, people who learn it from the papers and use it like their own.
They've wandered back into the kitchen to pick at the edges of their destruction, still spread over the kitchen island. Malfoy pops olives in his mouth with the Statis unpeeled and says that it gives them an extra crunch.
My heart hammered. “Are you sure—”
“Scorpius, Professor,” the boy corrects, though there is a kindly glint in his eye.

How would Harry know? Harry frowns. "I'm no good at politics."
Malfoy shudders. "Tell me about it. No discretion at all."
About everything. "About presuming. Of course, you tried the doors."
"Eltanin, I bloody swear, if you and Harry don't—"
. "The only perk of broom drills," she says at Luna's bar. Luna's double-booked it for the night again, Puddlemere in one corner and the Tornados in the other, despite how many times they bring it up with Luna to
Malfoy's eyes widen. He strokes the broomstick handle with a hesitant hand.
He's changing, but mostly, he's running. Every morning, six-thirty, five kilometres. Six. Seven. Eight in the rain, and still Harry keeps up, droplets pelting down his face, soaking through his shirt until he's shivering in line for coffee. Draco charms Harry dry as subtly as he can, wrapping his shoulders with an extra charm so that they'll relax down from his neck.
Thank you so much
Ginny sucks on a bright blue popsicle, her eyes bugged out. "And you were both stone-cold sober."
Then came the distinct absence of all that was good in life.
Fuck writing. Harry's always been a man of action. He could go to Draco's and knock on the door.
It’s incredible how little you need in your head to pass as a functioning adult human being. There is a door, so open it. Step outside and pick up the paper. Go on ahead. It’s there, waiting for you. Feel the weight in your hand: unsubstantial; smooth. It’s an innocuous little thing, isn’t it? If left unread.
quaint."
," Draco said.
"She's alright," Harry says. "She helped me loads with the decorating. The trick is to let her do all the talking."
"Headed out later?" Ron asks on the way out of the locker room.
"You sound like you're talking about proper people, not books."
"You're alright," Draco said. "Better with your hand around my dick."
The first thing you see when you go by the lake is the sky canopied bright over the basin. The big blue over Wiltshire sweeps past the horizon as though reaching into the future. But this sky, it’s not so big. It’s safe.
"Don't mess around," Malfoy whines. He twists his head back, his bare arse grinding into Harry's cock.
"Why? You've got more than enough answers here."
"How would you know?" Ron hollers over the engine.
," Pansy read down the spine. "How much did it cost you? Fifty Galleons? At this rate, you'll drain your inheritance dry, filling up your bedroom bookcases alone."
He's about to get right back into his workout kit to try it out when Ron calls.
Eltanin leaves Harry at the entryway to get a permanent marker, leaving Harry to take his shoes off alone. There are easily a dozen pairs of shoes messily piled on the shoe rack. Harry recognises Draco's pastel high-tops, the ones he wears with sweatshirts and stonewashed jeans, and guesses that Draco is still at work.
"Finally," Draco says, both hands outstretched and his face tilted up, the same as he did yesterday, and the same as he will tomorrow, too, if Harry's lucky. The past, the present, the future. One tripping after another and all-at-once, out of time and into eternity. It's the only way Harry wants to love.
Ginny comes over a couple of hours later to get away from Dean while they're still dividing up their assets. She's disgusted by the kitchen island. Who wouldn't be? Harry didn't bother covering it with a Stasis, and now the food's beginning to rot. Still, he doesn't clean it up, even though Vanishing it all away is as easy as wiping his own arse. Having it there brings him a certain solace, like looking into a mirror and seeing exactly what you expect.
Draco Malfoy? Molly slaps a palm over her mouth to stop from gasping. She's right, because at the next tree down is Draco Malfoy, pressed against the white bark of an Indian laurel by Molly's very own Harry.
The room tilted, and Draco found himself on Harry's lap. "I think I'm in love with you," he sighed, draping his arms over Harry's shoulders and tucking his face into the crook of Harry's neck. His fingers brushed the toilet lid, the cold porcelain bringing an unwelcome splash of clarity. Fuck. What was he doing? He'dd been
"Uh huh," Harry said. Lightning-fast hands came up around Draco's waist, gripping tight before he rolled them over again. “The fuck you’re not.”
"Everyone is attractive in Hollywood."
," Molly mocks in a squeaky voice. "
, maybe.
He locks the dungeons behind us. Upstairs, he asks me what I saw.
“They’re orphans, Potter,” Draco says as though that means something to Harry, being an orphan himself. It doesn’t, of course. Harry used to worry that he doesn’t care how he’s supposed to. But lately, he just considers himself lucky. Here’s Draco in a rundown studio flat, unable to give up his great-grandmother’s silverware. Across town, Hermione is burning the midnight oil on yet another set of hopeless reform bills. Everyone holds onto the past like they owe it their future, but Harry’s discovered the way out.
"Get fucked," Harry snorts.
"Tell me why you're stalking Hermione."
father will hear about this.
"Alright, alright, get out of here," Dean says, spelling the cell door open.
The door jingles. A man in a red t-shirt enters with a cap pulled low over his eyes. He walks up to the counter and drops a duffel at his feet before sitting down.
"Thank you for your kindness," Draco says when Harry comes back.
"Shit." Draco thrusts in vain, trapped under Harry's legs. Harry lifts his hips, Draco's cock slipping out of him until his arse just catches the rim, before slamming his hips back down. Draco wraps his hand around Harry's cock, and they catch a rhythm they're accustomed to now, fast so they can make the post-game interviews, so they can get on with the rest of their lives. Except Harry doesn't want to move on from this, not when Draco's offering the possibility of forever.
Harry shrugs, though his face heats in embarrassment. "Yeah. The broom's kind of boring on its own."
There's a wet patch where Malfoy leaked precum into the sheets. Harry sniffs it. He gets hard imagining Malfoy rubbing himself raw while Harry fucks him into the mattress.
"But Muuuuummmm," Ginny whines, but she's grinning, probably from something her new not-girlfriend texted.
"So?"
“We talk about how our mums and das don’t live together,” Albus explains during spring recess a few months later, porridge-crusted spoon danging from his mouth.
“Wear the green shirt,” Draco murmurs.
"Yep," Harry says.
"Lick it," Draco says, pushing Harry's head down to his chest. Harry settles between Draco's legs, bracing himself on the mattress before following a raised edge up Draco's chest, to his neck. Draco leans back on the pillows with a sigh. "Goes straight to my dick, yeah." He reaches for his cock.
"Sounds boring," Harry says because it's true. Draco deserves the best. And Harry doesn't have a big enough ego to think he's the best, but if Draco thinks Harry is incredible but can barely remember what the new guy does for eight hours a day, Harry definitely has him beat.
"That's my question."
"That's not it," Harry says quickly. He steps forward to tug the sodden cloak from Draco's shoulders. "You need to get out of this, otherwise—"
are we going—"
They'd breached the twenty-minute mark of their usual post-game brawl when Ginny walked back into the stadium and yelled, "They're closing up, you fuckers!"
"Hey." Ron knocks his knuckles against Harry's forehead. "You okay in there?"
The valet takes Harry's car. Ginny shoves through the double doors of the back entrance with a yell so loud that the club stops to turn to them.
He works on his father for all of spring and summer, asking questions like: Will his father survive if he bribes a ministry official? If he sends chocolates on Christmas? Or every Sunday?
"You're disgusting," a voice says from the kitchen island. Harry jerks up, slice dropped in favour of his wand—but it's only Ginny. She's wearing Adidas joggers and a yellow baby tee with a single daisy embroidered, the shapely contours of her firm abs left explicit to the imagination.
When Draco awoke in the morning, he found that he was a beetle, and not a particularly dazzling one at that, with a dull black coat and ridged legs so brittle that he almost snapped one trying to get up.
"Really?"
Merlin. It wasn’t even Draco’s room. He had his own flat on the other side of town.
Draco's mouth is shiny and slick. "Again," he says.
"Did you mean it? What you said that summer."
fifth edition.
“I haven’t flown in years,” Draco says, distant. But he follows.
"Yeah," Draco says, blinking. "It's exactly that. Merlin, you're incredible. The voters we've had trouble connecting with—"
The man who comes calls me
"You don't waste a second," Malfoy smirks. His fingers cling to the edge of Harry's jeans, slipping to rub against Harry's hip.
Harry's eyes were a little wild, his mouth slightly ajar. He shook his head. "It's nothing. You've got ink on your face." He strode forward so that he stood close enough for Draco to smell the lemon in his hair. And then he took Draco's chin in his hand. A long moment passed.
The summer after brings a lightness that carries Draco all through his trials and into the next year. The others hiss and spit but they don’t see how he’s free now, how it can only get better for him from here.
“Sex is so
Some days, he wakes wheezing, stumbling out of bed. Running, running—worried the old fear’s finally caught up. Scared that he’s returned to his old ways. Sometimes, Harry says, “go back to bed”, like it’s a problem. But mostly, he doesn’t say anything. Mostly, he goes back to bed.
. You have to play
Harry leans in. Can there really be too much of a good thing? A million nerve endings, and they're all puckered up for him.
"I wasn't my bloody—"
"And if I do, does that mean you'll share what you actually want to say?"
“Bad dreams?” He runs a single finger down the length of my wand, and I feel his touch like lightning down my spine.
“The only perk is that I don’t share,” Draco says, which is a lie because Harry can see two kittens peeking out from a stack of magazines under the nightstand/coffee table.
Harry sucks off the ugly smile plastered over Malfoy's face. Malfoy tastes sweet and entirely sober, which can't be right because Harry's soaked in wine from dinner.
Turns out, he lives across the street.
Harry loves to run his fingers criss-cross over the scars on Draco’s chest. The habit is borne from shame but morphs into instinct with time. No matter when or where, Harry’s fingers will itch their way under Draco’s shirt until they find the seams of old wounds. Draco never fails to lean into the caress, his breath light and inviting, as though urging Harry to open him up again and make sure he’s still good on the inside.
“I… well, I’ve always preferred my mother’s. They’re a very pale blue, like the sky when the cloud’s so thin that it streaks. My father's… it’s not pleasant to speak ill of the dead.”
"The gay bit, probably. Hermione would kill me for thinking that. She thinks magic is going to save the world. But there are millions and billions of Muggles who don't know that magic exists, and they're alright."
room,
," Malfoy mocks. "You single-handedly drove customer engagement by three-hundred percent in the last week alone. They can't have you falling off now. You're a literal cash cockatrice."
“They’ve nowhere to go except here,” Draco says, but he’s still smiling. Beaming, even.
“It’s only a cold, then.”
“You should have produced an heir by now.”
, Potter insisted, his chuckle a soft rumble in the back of my mind.
It's ten minutes to the toilets and another ten to Harry's bedroom. Malfoy is all over his neck as Harry reaches between them and tugs Malfoy's shorts off. Harry groans, licking his tongue all the way into Draco's mouth, before dropping to his knees at the foot of the bed.
Harry reached for Draco's dick. His body tensed upon contact. "You’re not even hard," Harry said. "Are you a virgin? You know you can't fuck anyone with a floppy dick—"
"Uhh. You gave me a key? Nice going with Malfoy, by the way. He sounds…energetic. Acrobatic?"
"Terrible," Harry scowls. "The biggest mistake of my life." He pulls open Hermione's fridge. Inside is two beers and a box of seltzer water. His reflection bounces off one of the cans, and he catches it for a second. "Most fuckable prettiest lips in the league," Draco had said, right before he shoved his cock between them.
Joy is an ugly taloned beast breaking my mouth open in a grin that shows all my teeth. I’m a brute when Harry calls to me; grotesque every time he sighs my name in sleep. He beckons to the joy in me, and it possesses me, makes me a monster.
Draco said I did a good job, very theatrical, he would have given it an Oscar. He said, "You make a mess of murder."

He tries again.
louder than the usual drone.
"Pansy," Ginny says.
"Err—"
Pansy stirred her tea with a noisy spoon. "Sounds boring."
It’s the Year of Yes, and Yes starts with this Quidditch jersey, Yes, the one with your old number on the back. Yes, they’ve taken a photo, and Yes, the rumours are true, it’s been five years or forever. I’m warm in worn crimson & gold, and Yes, Harry, I’m saying Yes.
Draco bites his lip. "I…I started seeing someone. We're not exclusive, but I'm hopeful..." he trails off.
good business decision?"
"I can't what?"
Harry's cheeks flush. "What?"
“Mm. I’d make a mess of it right in front of you.”
"Fuck
"You've got thirty minutes before you're expected at Hermione's thing," Ron says.
, stupid. So we can interrogate the fuck out of that scheming bartender."
"Huh," Draco said, momentarily distracted as he stumbled around a pair of jeans propped up from when Harry had clearly stepped out of them some days or weeks ago. Draco was about to make a remark about the single, stiff sock by the bedside table, when Harry clocked him on the shoulder.
“I’m glad we clarified that.”
"You. You've had my heart in your hand this whole time, and you've just been squeezing it and squeezing it like a—a common
Ron snorts. "I'm telling you, you've got to hire an assistant." He makes Harry watch him take a long, suffering sip of his wine before saying, "It's Dean's soft opening, okay? For the restaurant. It's a big deal for him. Be nice to my brother-in-law."
," Ginny says. She's right. Ginny's the most tolerable person Harry knows. There's a reason they dated, after all—they get on freakishly well, even if it didn't work out in the end.
You come to me because you’re weary being good all those hours in the day. In the cool reprieve of darkness, I swallow the blackness in your blood until your eyes bleed blank and the metallic tang of copper fills the night.
Draco falls, and Harry sinks with him, his hands still fisted in Draco's robes.
“I’ve brooms back in the hut,” Harry offers in a jumble, words tripping over each other in their rush to get out, “The new Cometheads; they’re practically weightless. You’ve got to try them.”
"Draco Malfoy didn't know what he was doing," Potter said later that night when he showed up at my door.
Draco is not a powerful Auror, but he’s known the scent of darkness since childhood and learned better than to chase it up Manor bannisters. But.
"You are. You're the most amazing person I know. I'll follow you to the ends of the earth."
Dolohov’s eyes are blue. His mouth parts to reveal a lower set of yellowed teeth.
"Booty call," Harry says, to which Ron squawks but doesn't correct him. He acts properly apologetic for leaving Harry by himself, which is ridiculous because what is the point of all this money if it isn't for buying company? And Ron is as dull a slug as any.
"Spencer and who?" Ron asks.
Draco pushes his head against Harry's shoulder. When he looks up, his eyes are a glassy, watery swell, grey as the ocean reflecting back.
"How much is it?"
warnings: angst
“Nobody likes my flat,” Draco laughs. “There’s barely room to breathe. Everything smells like kitty litter, and the toilet only flushes if you’re nice to it.”
"Why me?"
It's a weekday and still early in the night. The bartender keeps asking if Harry's waiting for someone, but Harry keeps shrugging and twitching and drinking and tapping his fingers on the counter until the bartender says, "If you like blonds, then my friend is one."
Day after day he asks increasingly complicated questions. Questions like: will he pass his classes? Will his mother be well when he calls on her? Will his father survive the winter in Azkaban? Uncertainty begins creeping into the answers: probably, likely, not likely.
It was about a wand.
Love like a kick to the head.
"Don't tell me you're siding with them," Molly says to the little white-haired furball. "Well, lookie-loo, they kicked you out too."
Harry's heart sinks, though he doesn't know why.
"It's alright," Harry says. "I had some last week. There was some leftover in my fridge—"
"I will fucking sue you," Harry yanks open the door yelling.
In the weeks that Harry leaves, Draco stays behind and talks with the trees, who never talk back except with the wind (soft rustlings, or sweet murmurs of agreement). He tries not to worry about Harry, but of course, he does, in a burrowing sort of way. Draco thinks that he can wait forever, by the lake. He can pretend Harry is eternally on the verge of coming home.
Ron's hair is uncombed. His stubble is two days old, though his jumper is newly knit from the week he spent at his mum's. The skin under his eyes is purplish, bruise-like when he squints. Hermione sits across from him and pets and pets and pets as her eyes fill with dread at what comes next.
I learned that summer how eager parchment is to die under flame. Five, ten seconds to dust, then swept into the wind with a casual hand to become nothing until it is everything. That is how I love you. You, benevolent you; every lick of mercy a cleansing fire to my sin. Please, won’t you hold my arm and burn the rot away? Burn me down to dust and breathe me in until I am everywhere in you.
“Not disappointed,” Harry said, and kissed him.
" Harry said. Pansy had let him in.
"To be left alone."
"He's my guest," Eltanin says somberly before erupting into giggles.
"Eager," Harry says. He presses two fingers together and fucks them in and out of his arse, groaning at the burn. Draco's mouth is open when Harry looks up.
"I'm a good lay. Considerate," Ron likes to boast. But if that's true, then his fry-ups must be shit because none of his hookups ever stick around for seconds.
“I thought we were in a hurry.” Draco chews on his lip, his leg jittery like it wants to escape the rest of him.
