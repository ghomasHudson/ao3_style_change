He reached out to Draco’s sweet round belly, ripe and warm under the pyjama top his husband had taken to wearing around the house. Harry had offered to take him to buy some new, stretchy pregnancy clothes, but they hadn’t got round to it yet.
Draco saw him go and sighed, wishing he could be with her. Then she decided to stare at her daughter for the whole time she fed. Then, when they took her off, she wanted more yet, so they gave her the other breast so she could go on.
"Do you think you'd be able to... To prepare me long enough and in a proper way that it wouldn't... you know, leave any marks? You know... Maybe we can start with one of my fingers? They are pretty small... I don't think I'd tear or bruise anything... And, you know, I still go to the toilet," Draco laughed, a little embarrassed. "It has never hurt me. Do you think we could... go slow enough that it wouldn't hurt?"
It wasn't big. It was
Harry looked down at the wanton sight of his lover, his come still leaking a line from Draco’s arsehole onto his fine, white thighs. Harry shivered, feeling overwhelmed with the emotions overtaking his body and his mind.
He licked his lips as he felt his husband's hand straying downwards, and he smiled to himself, offering his arse like a prize for him.
He smiled, opening his eyes and looking into Harry's green eyes. Fuck, how he was handsome. Draco had
She felt her walls hugging his cock in a fierce grip, muscles spasmming around its thick girth, hands grabbing his hair.
as many tiaras as she currently owned.
Harry felt far better after talking to Draco. Taking his husband at his word, he fucked him at possible opportunity. He sucked his cock in the toilet of their friends house, fingered him under the table at the pub and screwed him in the Quidditch changing rooms after they’d won a match.
As far as Harry could tell, Draco was running the business singlehanded; an omega in an alpha’s world. He was trying hard to deny his omega nature whilst still being the perfect omega son. Nobody could manage so many different roles. It just wasn’t humanly possible.
He moaned louder when Harry put his mouth on his cunt, holding his husband's hair and wishing for his cock so desperately. He whimpered when Harry left that part of his body, but smiled when Harry got him in his arms.
reliant and punctual, Mr. Malfoy. I assure you that I follow through on all my promises.”
Harry returned after having taken out Monster on his evening walk, and was incredibly surprised to find his husband looking very shocked. Jasmine was already in bed, so he slid next to Draco in the settee, and slipped an arm around the curve of his waist.
~Harry.
While Draco was collecting the Vaseline, Harry cast his eyes around the bathroom as he dried himself off with one of Draco’s thick towels. His lover’s parents certainly kept him in a nice situation. The fittings were thick marble and the bathtub was bigger than any other Harry had ever seen. If – when - Draco ever stayed at his home he might think he was roughing it a little. Harry thought that they could make it worth it though, give him the love and acceptance he’d been missing forever.
He moved closer to Harry, raising himself on his knees to walk and sitting straddling Harry's legs, so his cock was rubbing against Harry's. The size difference was so contrasting Draco almost came with only the vision of it. Harry's cock was big, his knot forming and making it even bigger. Draco's was much smaller, so delicate and light against his alpha's one. He grinded them together, holding them with both of his hands, feeling his orgasm come slowly. He just needed a little bit more...
“I can see that your mind is made up, Draco. You’re living in a gilded cage. Personally I think we could make a life together... I’d be willing to look after you and support you. It wouldn’t be the life you’re used to, but at least it’d be free. And yes, you’ll call me a romantic, call me a fool. You’d be correct. But you’re only just existing as you are.”
Harry moved over to the sofa, the shock making him feel a little lightheaded. He didn’t want to let go of Draco yet, so he pulled his husband down next to him.
Harry felt the texture of Draco’s silky knickers. Incredibly soft and expensive, they were tight and fit Draco like a second skin. Harry could feel how hard he was, solid and ready.
“Again, I want you to tell me if this is too much, Draco... I don’t want to push you into anything.” Leaning his body over Draco’s, Harry slowly rubbed his clothed cock against Draco’s naked one, frotting the omega and loving every moment of the delicious friction.”
"Draco Malfoy, where are you?" She asked, and her voice was tight and serious.
soon. We’ve got a whole night to entertain ourselves.”
Draco clicked on her name, and he was assaulted with Lyra's photos.
It wasn’t that I didn’t trust you. I didn’t trust my luck. Everything between us was so brilliant, like all the pieces of my life had fallen into place. I was waiting for everything to go wrong; self-sabotaging my happiness like I always do.
“Harry... How could I ever be able to even talk to her if you do it to me?” Draco asked, but didn't go away. It was so good that he was complaining only half-hearted. “What do you want to do to me, Harry?  What do you need me to do to you?”
She grabbed his hand, put it on one of her breasts and pressed his fingers around it. She wanted to see herself leak on his fingers.
It was out of worldly pleasure. Feeling hot inside, Harry's hands holding him so hard, his own hand touching his nipple, made Draco jump over the edge. His body trembled with pleasure, his orgasm making his body explode. His eyes turned back, drool was falling from his mouth but he couldn't help it. He couldn't stop coming, his walls twitching and hugging Draco's cock inside him.
“Have you got plans this morning, Draco? If you haven’t, shall we go out for a walk? We can have a shower first, freshen ourselves up, and then we can do anything you wish? We could have an ice cream with Lyra if you’d like.”
The congratulation letters were nice, though.
And sometimes Harry felt like cursing Draco for his dogged persistence, felt like hexing him for the complete faith he'd placed in this ritual. Draco had gambled his happiness on the ceremony. If the magic didn’t succeed, and there weren’t any guarantees, then Harry wasn’t sure he could put his beloved through this ordeal again.
Draco skilled his face into his business persona. He smiled politely at Ollivander, the old man still good hearted, although he was incredibly old fashioned.
“Is that right?” Harry laughed, as he picked up Jasmine, and swung her easily into his arms. “And where are we going on our day off, young lady?”
He looked at Harry, touched by his words. So he felt the same. He felt the same, incredible, insane urge to be together forever. Having a baby with someone tied you to them forever, and Harry
Draco laughed, opening his eyed and looking at Harry.
“It’s okay love... You’re going to be fine and so is our baby. I know it’s early, so we’ll get ourselves off to the hospital as soon as we can. But you need to talk to me, Draco. Are you hurting much yet?”
"Yes, I'd love a shower... But maybe I should have one alone? I... I'm sorry, Harry, you know I love sex with you and everything sexual really, but... I'm a little overwhelmed with feelings right now," Draco held Harry's hand tightly, kissing his lips softly. "Maybe we can do something more today at night? I promise to give you the orgasm you should've been having the whole week."
“Okay, Draco,” he rasped, using the Vaseline to slick up his thick cock, although he didn’t think that he would really need it. Draco was wet and open, his innate omega making him ready to take an alpha cock like he was made to.
Harry wasn't her alpha at all. That knowledge made Draco bloom. He smiled back at her, and shook her hand before she left the parlour.
“Firstly, I have to be honest, Draco. I’m of the opinion that cooking isn’t something you’re good or bad at. It’s just something to learn, and I’ll teach you what I know... And as for the rest of it, love, I absolutely and completely agree with you. In the home that I grew up in, there was so much anti-omega prejudice. Any kind of public speech, or trail blazing omega was called unnatural by my awful uncle. All I want is a relationship where I can look after a person, help them to be the best version of themselves possible. Show them they’re loved.”
None of them thought of what
“That's what you say, Death Eater scum. Even walking around dressed as a girl, as if we don't know how you used magic to birth this kid, as if we don't know you're the same old Draco Malfoy that killed Dumbledore!”
Draco smiled brightly as she saw Harry, and inclined her head so he could kiss her. She was becoming happier and less tired by the clock, and having Harry at her side was a gigantic plus.
It all seemed a little much, but Harry felt like he’d take anything at the moment. He requested an Uber, and found himself moving rapidly towards Draco’s apartments in next to no time.
"I'll be
her. She needed to taste it, to taste every piece of him.
He smiled, knowing he was being needy and spoiled, but he wanted that extra caring only his alpha could give him.
He felt his body got closer to another climax, and then Harry spoke. Draco opened his eyes, his breath coming in harsh pieces.
Draco let his chest fall to the bed, arse up for Harry's pleasure. This pleasure, though, was sky rocketing through Draco's body as well. He felt like he was experiencing something so known, but at the same time, so new. It was perfect. Every come and go of Harry's body inside him was perfect. The feeling of it, it was just... It was exactly what Draco needed.
“I already love them. I already love them and I've known this little worm's existence for about five minutes. I was so sure I couldn't have a baby I missed all the signs... But here they are. Fuck, Harry... I still can't believe it... We're going to be parents! You're going to be a daddy and I'm going to be...”
Draco thought about the last thing Harry said, licking his lips that tasted like past sauce.
Sometimes he still dreamt of the babies he’d have loved for Draco to have. Sometimes he’d wake and imagine for a moment that it’d been real. But he knew it was impossible, so he’d never say a word to his husband. He has sworn to himself never to bring the dreams up with Draco, fearing it would hurt him.
They arrived home, and Draco bought time by putting their small shopping bag on the counter and sorting things to their places. He then remembered to take off his coat and gloves, putting them behind the door and looking at himself in the mirror.
But still, it felt great to manage his own client base, and not have to answer to anyone. There was still the matter of the CEO, of course. Well, no doubt he’d be a fussy, spoilt little omega, brought up with daddy’s money and never made to work a day in his life. Harry grimaced as he thought about the meeting they were due to have later that week. Harry has met
Draco smiled, pleased and guilty. Pleased because he loved to know his kiss and his body caused that effect on Harry. And guilty because... Yes, he know that he couldn't give more to him. Or maybe he could. He worried his bottom lip once again, thinking. How could he ease this pressure on Harry but not open his legs before the marriage?
. She couldn’t help it, could she? She was born like this, born with this body, and she bloody liked it. The world would rather see her dead, though.
wouldn’t be to Draco’s liking. Perhaps he’d look far too old in the cold reality of the evening. He wasn’t the biggest alpha possible, or the broadest...
Harry thought how it wouldn’t take much to come from this; the sight of his lover’s arsehole stretched out to take his cock was such a bloody rush; the thought of Draco’s red little lips demanding he make him come made his cock twitch involuntarily.
Pulling out, he wiped his sodden fingers on the bed spread between them, and pushed Draco gently onto his back. Leaning over, he pressed himself over the slighter man, trapping his body beneath him, finding his lips for a searing, frantic kiss.
. Just as much as it belongs to Lyra or me. This is where you’re safe, secure and loved and you will be forever.”
people. Here, Harry could nothing, nothing at all. He felt worse than useless in the face of his wife’s agony.
“What is it, Harry?” she asked, taking of her shoes. Her feet were sweating, and thankfully she packed some light sandals.
"I love you, too, stupid. Now you're going to call your oaf of an alpha or what?"
Draco was indeed tired. Emotionally tired. But, as if he was feeling that his alpha was awake, his eyes slowly opened, his body curling closer to Harry's by its own.
“Harry, you get the celery. I'll go there to get the honey and I'll be right back,” he said, and walked towards the honey, that was in another aisle.
Harry pulled out, and covered his finger in more lube, plunging it in deeper this time, and turning it in a
"Alpha... I'm so happy you're here with me... I know I'm not the perfect omega... but I'm so happy you still want to be here with me," Draco felt so safe, he didn't mind saying things normally he'd keep to himself. "I'm your regular rich omega. Old money, old values. I'm the perfect little baby who was supposed to be an Alpha, but since my childhood my parents knew I would present as an omega. I just didn't grow enough. So, instead of being a natural leader and breeder, I'm made for breeding,"
Draco closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling of having someone so close. He'd surely feel ashamed when he saw his parents again, but it was just so good... He didn't care about being prude right now.
Draco melted in Harry's arms, and desire built inside her. She wanted it so much... Harry's touch and his hands all over her just like before, but she just couldn't take her clothes in front of him... But she needed...
Harry knew Draco was traditional, but he couldn’t resist the teasing. It felt like every part of his fiancé had been personally created to please him.
“Well I refuse to let that be the end of it. We both know that we want each other, so why not let the world know and act on it?” Harry practically yelled into Draco's ear..
Harry was tired after their long day of walking and all the unusual sights they had seen, and before he knew it, he’d fallen fast asleep.
“I got bored.” Draco whined, closing his eyes and enjoying the water.
Draco got up, walking to the mirror and fixing his long hair, turning back to Harry and smiling at him.
Harry laid his whole hand on Draco’s belly. Harry was so big in comparison to his husband that his fingers splayed widely, cupping the softer, rounder front.
But there was a little something bugging his thoughts. He'd always thought that, after a month of sex, he'd end up pregnant. But he wasn't. When he was bleeding again after a whole month, he had to swallow his hopes of having a baby at that moment, and think that it wasn't supposed to be that fast. They had time to wait.
As Draco was depositing the checks, he stopped to check on Harry's message back. He stopped for a couple of seconds, his heart beating so fast and so strong he thought it was going to break his ribcage.
Pushing her against the wall, Harry grabbed Draco by the waist, not letting her move a muscle. He forced a kiss down her throat, her lips soft and throbbing underneath his. His body felt hot, tight and excited, his magic ricocheting through both of their bodies.
“And your breasts are perfect... So warm, and already full of milk to feed our baby. You’re mine, Draco, you and the baby... All that I need in the world.”
Finding his husband’s hand, Harry led the way to the apartment where they were staying. Hundreds of years old, it was very austere and grand. Pulling Draco behind him, Harry explored every room, laughing in happiness at their isolation and the opportunities it afforded them.
“And those fantasies you’re having? They are entirely normal, the products of your hormones and your biology. Every omega feels like that... They don’t make you impure. And I assure you, every alpha thinks like that too, I’ve been having similar thoughts.”
Draco smiled with Harry's tenderness, running his fingers through his husband's hair.
tried not to laugh, but it wasn’t happening. He managed to suppress the worst of his giggles, and leaned in to kiss his wife’s pink, panicked cheeks.
They reached the park and Harry open the gate for Draco. They walked along in silence, enjoying the dull sunshine on their backs and the overhanging canopy of trees. Harry linked their fingers and the walked over to the lake.
really exist.”
"Yes, baby. We... We know you haven't done anything that would ruin you forever... So... We thought you could marry Theo Nott, here. He's your age, and he's from a very good family. He proved to us that he can take care of you..."
He decided to walk down to the kitchen, almost naked, and rested himself against the door.
“Harry... I want you inside me... Please let me ride you... Take off your jeans... Let me ride you while you touch me all over... I want to feel complete... Please... “
“Was it good?” he asked, craving approval.
“Oh... I don't know, really. Jim's an avocado right now, so I suppose they are too tiny for me to feel them. But I guess in a couple of months?  I'm not a specialist in maternity. I've studied it but I admit that I forgot a couple details about it. Are you anxious to feel them?”
He’d nearly taken himself to the edge before she’d walked in, and the pleasure was starting to roll though his body, and down his spine in waves.
“Harry, we didn't buy boy clothes,” she didn't answer his question, this problem way more important at the moment. She looked at Harry, stuffing her mouth with chips. “I need boy clothes too. After we get out here, please let's find some.”
You’re frowning at this parchment, I’m sure of it.
He let go of Harry's lips, kissing him one more time before looking into his eyes.
They found a spot that was close to the cricket ground, and after they’d settled down, Harry gave out sandwiches, drinks and fruit to all his family.
He felt like coming, but he needed more, he wanted more. He could feel his body preparing itself for what was to come.
Draco's body exploded in desire and pleasure. Yes, that was exactly what she wanted, that raw and rough desire. She didn't know she wanted it up until that moment, but now that Harry was giving it to her, it was more than a need. It was like breathing.
“And keep it. Or else you're not having fruit rolls at the park,” Draco put her on the floor, and she immediately run to Harry at the living room. It was finally his day off and she loved to be close to him whenever he was near.
The jolt of pleasure through Draco's body when Harry bit him made him arch away from the bed, a high pitched moan getting out of his throat. He was sweating, his voice hoarse, his body pliant. He closed his eyes when he felt the third finger in, and paid attention to the sensation of it.
"Well, if everything is up to your liking, I must go up. Reports won't write themselves, right?" Draco smiled once again, wanting to know a little more about Potter, but refraining himself. An unmated alpha with a child was a problem. A huge problem. And he wasn't even thinking about the fact Potter was his employee. Best leave things by themselves. "Every month I'll be waiting for your monthly reports and our monthly meetings. If you don't know how to do it yet, don't worry. Come to my office and I'll gladly help you. Have a nice day, Potter. And send your daughter my congratulations!" Draco said, and moved to shake Potter's hand.
They were incredibly caring, kind and their busy professionalism was enabled Harry to actually start breathing again. He hadn’t even realised he’d been holding his breath until he slowly filled his chest with air again.
Harry could feel how wet his husband was getting, and how much looser this was starting to make him. He wasn’t just going to thrust in though, he wanted to draw this out for Draco, make his husband burn with sensation. Pushing in another finger, he found no resistance to his knuckles.
I haven’t forgotten anything. It might be five years but every day of our love affair is seared into my memory. You know how much I loved you.
He didn't have eggs. Draco sighed, looking around his fridge, finding a piece of cheese. It also smelled okay, so maybe it could go well with the toast. He grabbed a knife, trying to cut even slices, but not quite managing that. Well, he supposed it would taste good enough.
Harry felt himself start to drift to sleep, enjoying the feel of Draco’s heart beating under his fingertips.
Draco looked at him, grabbing his wand silently and moving it around, then touching it on his own belly. As if they were living on a déjà vu, the image formed on the air, showing Draco’s womb. Inside there was a little, tiny worm, just like Jim had been before.
“I’m sorry, I’m just so excited love. It’s the most wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me... Well, apart from marrying you of course... and I’m a bit overwhelmed. I love them so much too.”
“The biggest orgasm of your life?” Harry smirked cheekily, making sure that Draco could feel how excited he’d already become, his cock rigid with just the sweet omega scent of Draco Malfoy. “And do I get to partake in this orgasm-fest or is it Omega only?”
When Harry said those last words, Draco moaned, and looked up at him with his eyes shining.
Draco's mind went blank. It was like every single sensation in the world had assaulted him, at once, as his neck burned and his body exploded.
When he got there, he pretended to be making tea, in case someone appeared there, and waited for Harry. His heart was pounding hard, and he felt his whole body get warm. Dear God, how he missed his alpha.
“Today, I want to visit Torcello Island. Do you think we can do it?” He asked as he left the bathroom, already dressed in some jeans and a t-shirt.
“Harry... Do I look like a girl? Please... Please, be very honest with me.”
“Time to go, love. Let’s just take some small steps.”
Harry felt his alpha side absolutely
Harry lazed on the bed, enjoying ten minutes of relaxed happiness. Life was busier than ever, with his charity, the business and his children.
Harry smiled. It made him feel warm inside that Draco wanted to stay at home now he was bonded. That wasn’t a thing he’d ever have asked of his omega but it showed Harry that Draco was serious. He wanted this relationship as much as Harry did.
to offer Draco. He had a daughter for one thing. And Harry was hardly the sort of alpha Draco could take home to meet his parents.
Draco knew she wouldn't forget it.
“It will be here when we come back from our outing,” Draco smiled even bigger, feeling his body tingle with excitement. He was happy for doing it, and maybe he wanted a little more, but he was okay with waiting. He knew he would feel even better when they arrived at night and Harry had his way with him. “Let's go. Finish your shower so I can have mine and we'll go out.”
“You’ll never have to know, Draco. Not one day for the whole rest of your life. You’ll always have me standing next to you, sharing our lives, our everything. It’s quite simple. I love you... And that’ll  never stop. Just tell me Draco. What can I do to prove that I’ll still be here, forever, even if never happens for us?”
Harry was looking forward to talk to Ginny and share the gossip about her Weasley family whom he still loved immensely. Baby Chloe was a cutie (not as sweet as Iris, but then of course he
“Hmmm... I'll be cold, though. You'll have to hold me throughout all the night and you'll have to cover me in the morning. Think you'll be able to do that?” Draco moved his head, kissing Harry's lips in small pecks.
And Draco’s cock felt like heaven in his mouth; wonderfully petit but so hard and perfectly formed. Harry played with it in his mouth, massaging it with his tongue and enjoying its sweet and musky taste.
"I'll tell him I need to stay the night, that's all." Draco replied, and messaged Harry, because he couldn't wait.
The noise was enough to spur Harry into action, and he set about fucking Draco with a solid pace of quick, steady thrusts that bounced his darling forward and jerked him back.
Draco would be waiting for him, a vessel to receive Harry's ejaculate, his body thrumming both with archaic fertility magic and potent anxiety.
His movements made Harry's fingers go deeper, and he screamed with the feeling. It was unexpected, so, so deep, that he felt his body convulsing before he came all over. His arsehole gripped Harry's fingers tightly, his orgasm so strong that his mind went blank.
Harry gently pushed Draco onto his back on the bed.
“Harry... It's... Fuck... It's enough... I want you inside... Please.... Please open me up, fuck me, fuck me deep, make me so full of you I won't have space for anything else but your come...” He was babbling, now both of his hands on his chest, the tender flesh of his breasts showing between his fingers as he squeezed them.
“Remember when you asked about my kinks? I still have no courage to tell you all of them but... Here's one.”
Harry felt his wife shudder and quiver through her orgasm, and all through he kissed and caressed her breasts and front; sucking, nibbling and touching her everywhere.
"I'm all yours, alpha... All yours... Please... I need your cock deep, deep inside me... I need your knot..." Draco could feel Harry's beginning of a knot pressing onto his arse, and it made his eyes roll back into his head.
Any thoughts of an innocent massage seemed to have evaporated when Draco whispered to him, and Harry knew there and then that this was only going to end one way.
Draco turned his body, feeling a lightness he hadn't felt in some months. After Jasmine, having such a moment with Harry was a rare thing, and he cherished it with all his heart. He hugged his husband, kissing Harry's shoulder and closing his eyes.
“I’m pretty sure my understanding of how sex works is pretty accurate, sweetheart... I think you’re misunderstanding me on purpose. I don’t know if we need to rush into this. You’re inexperienced, but you’re putting pressure on yourself to get pregnant. I’m quite willing to fuck you every day of the week, if that’s what you want.”
Having said what he wanted to say, Draco turned so he could change into more comfortable clothes now.
Harry couldn’t hold himself off any longer. Lust coursed thought his body, and without even really being conscious of it, had seized Draco by the waist leaving marks that would bruise. In one reckless, impulsive moment, he found himself plunging his cock deep into his husband, a shallow gasp leaving his mouth as he did so.
The hotel was fantastic, and Harry could already imagine spreading out in the bath, Draco sat in his lap.
Draco,” said Harry, hoping that Draco could hear the yearning in his voice. He smelt amazing too, his scent strong, making his heart beat just a little bit faster, and his eyes struggle to leave his boyfriends perfect body.  “That’s a good look on you. Casual and fashionable.”
“It’s what I want,” Draco confirmed, with only the merest hint of slurring on the last sound. “Please, Harry. It needs to be tonight.”
It tasted like heaven, like perfect heaven. He licked under, his head bobbing up and down as far as he could without pressing it into his throat. His mouth was so wet his drool was dripping from his chin, but he didn't stop. He couldn't. He wanted that cock inside him from whatever hole it would fit.
Then, out of nowhere, this specifically weekend, his father muttered 'sometimes I wish to just marry you off to some of my friends. They'd be a good husband to you', and Draco just left the table at that. His mother went after him, but Draco wouldn't listen. It was the third time his father mentioned about arranging a marriage for him with some old, flaccid alpha, and Draco just couldn't stand being on his presence anymore. He was doing all he could to make them proud, even giving up his desires and wishes, and this one thing his father wouldn't respect.
When Harry put a third finger, Draco stiffened, a sharp pain taking over him. He breathed in, holding onto Harry's arm. He knew his boyfriend didn't quite pressed all the way in, but his muscles, unused to the stretch, were screaming.
They left her house in less than half an hour. The only thing Draco needed was his clothes, shoes, some documents, hygiene items and books. It all fit in four large suitcases and a backpack.
Jasmine was more active now, looking around, with
“How does this feel, Draco? Is this too much?”
"I love you, my son. You'll always be my baby," she hang up, and Draco looked at his phone, feeling lost.
“No, Harry, I know you don't care, but-” even though she was melting under his touch, she had to be serious at that moment. “I should've known you'd be this gentleman guy when we married and all but, be honest;  not having sex sucks! And I know it, I really want you to drill me through this wall, and I've been wanting it since we couldn't do it because of my pregnancy but... Fuck! I don't like to look at myself in the mirror and I know you don't care but... Harry, it's hard. But I want to. I just want to, and I'm sure I'll be as tight as my virgin-me was, but... Fuck, it's just so many things in my head. So don't say it's fine if I don't want sex. It's not fine, it's not me! So... Fuck, just fuck me already okay?  Can you fucking make me forget I feel like a milking cow for over two months?”
“Fuck, Harry... You really want to ruin me, don't you?” Draco whispered, voice low and weak. Her eyes rolled back when she felt Harry's hands on her most intimate parts, stroking her cunt and her cock. She spread her legs even more, one hand going to one breast and squeezing.
Draco moaned when he saw Harry's cock, desire running through his whole body. He turned as Harry moved him around and breathed in and out when he felt Harry's finger on him.
And then he was coming, hot streams of spunk filling his wife and spilling over the pair of them. He held their bodies together, their bodies slick with sweat and Harry’s heart hammering a beat in his chest.
if I could, Harry. I have given all of me to you and I'd give you so much more..."
. It was time for him to leave. Harry swallowed, nerves jingle-jangling,
“Dada, dada!” Jasmine grabbed Harry by his leg, baby teeth showing as she smiled brightly. “Out!”
“You’ve got your freedom, Draco. That’s so powerful, and it means that from here on, you can live your life according to your own choices. You can be as free as you wish. Or you can just stay here beside me.”
The weeks passed speedily by after they returned from Brazil. There didn’t seem to be a weekend that passed with a quidditch match, a trip to see Narcissa or a visit to see Ron and Hermione’s beautiful baby daughter Rose.
He felt the familiar heat in the pit of his belly, felt the coiling of pleasure build. Harry’s skin was tingling and his heart felt like it was in fire. He wished desperately that he could knot Draco, fill him with a baby that would be loved and spoiled. His balls tightened close to his body, and then Harry was coming, thick spunk filling his lover.
Draco got the car back to the hotel, still thinking about the two letters, his stomach flipping with anxiety. He went directly to the restaurant so he could wait Harry for their breakfast. He was about five minutes earlier, so he sat on a table and waited, willing his heart to calm the fuck down.
As it was, Draco was a gift, wrapped and presented for his pleasure and he wanted to savour this joy. The damp of Draco’s knickers was matched by a larger one on Harry’s trousers, and he pulled desperately at the zipper. He was insane for his raw cock to rub against the silk of those lace knickers, his whole body urgent with need.
“You should eat. I won't have a scrawny husband, I tell you. I need those muscles to feel comfy,” Draco licked her fingers, then grabbing the next one and eating with gusto, just stopping after all the contents of the tray were consumed.
"Welcome home, young Master Malfoy," he said in the slow drag he always spoke, and Draco smiled fondly. This was the man that would scold him in front of his parents, but give him ice for his tender butt cheeks after his father had spanked him for an hour for being too outspoken.
He’d meant it though; Draco had told him about his biology, and he truly didn’t care what it looked like. All Harry cared about was using it in every way possible to give pleasure. Harry closed his eyes in satisfaction. The morning couldn’t come fast enough, and the night even more so.
When Draco was standing there, side by side with Harry, he forgot all about what happened that morning. Because his heart had only space for happiness.
“Well, don’t mess things up with him,” Lyra warned darkly, sounding older than her years. “Anyone can see you’re meant for each other! But dad, sometimes what we think is very normal is not for other people! Tell him your feelings and think of his feelings, okay? Like mum says: use
Draco was happy. She hugged Harry and kissed him on his cheek. She could eat it all and more, and it was something she would terribly miss once she was at England again.
that you would think I was doing the same thing as that insane, ridiculous person. Nobody ripped your baby from your arms, I took
"Hey!" Draco waved as he got closer, holding the strap of his side purse as if it would give him courage. "Sorry I am a little late. My name's Draco. You must be the famous Lyra."
“Harry...” she moaned, licking her lips. “Please fuck me... We can do it slowly... Very slowly... But please... I want to feel your cock in me... Please, Harry... We can go lightly...”
Harry couldn’t help but feel a raw shiver of desire for his wife as she sat beside him. He felt keenly how attractive she was, and how much he wanted her. Some mornings he’d wake up achingly hard; and he’d been having the most erotic dreams...
Harry took a deep breath as Draco’s door opened.
Avebury Circle was lit with the hovering lights of a dozen enchanted candles. Inky darkness surrounded the ancient stones and the thrum of magic within the towering structures was potent.
As he ate, he considered Harry's words. He was right, but there, in the house Draco started to imagine as his comfort and pleasure, he didn't want to talk work.
There couldn't be anymore waiting. With a flick of his wand, Harry Apparated.
“Yes, Draco. I want to come back with you. I want this, want you.”
“Then fucking TALK to me!” Draco screamed again, not knowing how to stop. She needed to put that energy out, her magic sizzling around her. “Tell me we'll talk later, tell me you don't hate me, don't just take Jim away from me like you did! Yes, I've seen that, I've seen you using magic on that monster, but have you seen what she did
“As you look utterly beautiful, and our daughter does too, perhaps I should take a photo and send it over to Luna at the Quibbler? I’m not sending anything to that rag, the
He pulled away, and found Draco’s lips, pulling him into a lingering kiss.
“I can do this to you because you’re mine.” Draco was so warm under his mouth. “Because you’re my fantasy. My family. I want everything with you...”
The only thing Harry insisted on, and this - he informed Draco - was an
. Draco went far on his stalking, finding out that this Weasley guy was married to the Hermione girl, that they had two kids and they were Harry's nephew and niece.
“I’ll always treat you so well, Draco,” Harry said, nuzzling into Draco’s neck and kissing him happily, a wide grin splitting his face into two. He was happier than he’d been all week. He had his omega in his arms and all the bloody Notts of this world could disappear for all he cared.
“I don't think having such a tiny dog would protect us from anything. If they are roughly the size of a crup, then the attacker would just have to kick them out of the way,” Draco raised her eyebrow, looking at Harry. “But... You can show me what you're thinking and we should have a think together.”
Pulling out of his husband’s neat cunt, he lined the fat head of his cock up, ready to attempt entrance to his husband’s most private place...
Draco pleading made Harry’s prick jerk, so he gave his balls a squeeze, willing himself to calm. Then, without any further hesitation, Harry spread Draco’s nether cheeks and felt his husband's whole body jolt with expectation as he did so. Draco’s own cock was long and erect, the head of it glossy with precome. Draco’s skin was warm, smooth and strangely alien with its new hairlessness. Harry would like to have licked, delved and explored had this been any other night.
For Harry, raised by Muggles, it seemed fantastical that Draco might carry their baby, that new life might be created from a small spark of magic.
Draco looked up at Harry and just smiled at that. Little did Harry know, Draco would absolutely love a baby who looked just like him. She let it pass, though. They had all the time in the world now.
When Harry held his hand and put it on his cock, he felt his cunt twitch with need. His nipples got hard again, and his legs opened as far as they would go.
The rest of the day flew by quickly for Harry. The love affair he’d been conducting with Draco had taken up much of the energy he should have dedicated to his work, so he spent the remaining hours catching up on urgent paperwork. He wrote up his report on the Ollivander factory visit, and finally, laid back in a steaming bubble bath, washing his hair carefully and relaxing in a way he’d forgotten how to. Laying out his suit for the next day, Harry was surprised by how calm he felt.
Gritting his teeth, Harry managed a few gasped words. “I’m going to push against you now.... Might hurt, Draco... Just tell me to stop if it’s painful...”
It certainly seemed like a good idea. The only problem was
He quickly typed out a reply.
Unfortunately, the night got off to an incredibly uncomfortable start. Ron and Hermione grinned widely at each other over the bottle of elf-made wine they’d picked up; and he could hear them whispering in the kitchen.
made it a fashion statement. They’re perfect for lazing at the weekend.”
“Fuck! Ah, Harry I'm coming! I'm-- Aahh!”
his house if he got there. He didn't know what his father was capable to do. He had been punished before, in cruel ways, for much less. He could never promise Harry something he didn't know he could do.
Harry picked up Jasmine out from Draco’s hands, and placed her on his knees. Her beautiful face was so interested in the pictures in the screen, and she made some
He listened to him, biting his bottom lip. Of course, Harry was right, but Nott was a good employee and they've known each other for decades.
Draco was surprised to feel Harry's hands on her, and her body melted against his chest. She didn't know how much she needed that touch, that desire on him. She touched his face, her fingertips touching his beard, and the feeling of it making her skin tingle.
What did that all mean? Harry shook his head, trying to dislodge all the worrying thoughts that now flooded through his mind. He kissed Draco once more, slipping out though the emergency exit. Time had passed while he and the omega were talking, and suddenly, if they didn’t leave soon, they’d miss their rental car.
"Harry?"
“Have you decided on what are we eating?” Draco asked, without actually turning his head from the book. “Are you going to cook? I really fancy some pasta today...”
Harry could feel how Draco was shaking; could feel how her nerves were absolutely shot.
But Nott wasn’t done.
Pulling off his clothes, Harry’s heart was racing fast, and he could feel his cock swelling warmly at the thought of raw intimacy with Draco, so long denied to both of them.
Draco’s face was cold and calm under his gaze, and Harry couldn’t help but drop his fingers from his lover’s wrist.  Draco’s words only confirmed his deepest fears: Nott had somehow ruined everything, informing Draco’s parents of their love affair and making up scandalous lies that didn’t reflect their true feelings at all.
Noticing it, Draco put his hands down, helping Harry to take off his trousers. He wanted release, but he wanted Harry even more. Unaware of Harry's plans, he couldn't help but do what his heart wanted. As soon as Harry's cock was free, Draco dropped to his knees and opened his mouth, putting as much as he could of his cock into his mouth. He moaned when he felt the weight on his tongue, and started to move his head, sucking and licking as he could.
“I’m the best alpha for
“You'll turn into a puppy any time from now and you'll have to eat on the floor!” Draco said, holding Jasmine on his arms. Draco was wearing shorts and a tee as the day was hot. He had foregone a bra, and although his breasts were still more sensitive than before, he was used to it by now.
Draco had absolutely no fucking idea of what he was doing, but hey, he was good at figuring things out.
“O-Okay...” Draco got out from Harry's lap and did as he was told. He made himself comfortable, a little nervous. He didn't know what Harry wanted to do, and convinced himself to just wait.
Sometimes Draco wanted Harry to touch him more intimately, and once, when he was feeling bold and closer to his PMS and his tiny breasts were super sensitive, he let Harry touch them. He had come with that touch only, and he felt super guilty for not giving nothing back to Harry, so he let him peak under his shirt. From time to time, Draco felt super embarrassed knowing that Harry had seen his chest this one time. But most of the time, he forgot about it. Especially when there was pizza around.
"Well, one man's trash is another man's treasure, people say, right?" Draco said, his tone of voice low and simple. "I never wanted to be a businessman. When I was a kid, I wanted to play volleyball. And I was really good at it. I played through all my school and college years, even at university... But then I had to follow my Father's steps and the company then was mine. I never wanted it, but I never do something badly, so I promised I would be bloody good at it. And I am, if I say so myself. The company increased profits year by year after it was in my hands. My family is so proud of me... Their beautiful, powerful, traditional and virgin little omega. I never wanted that... I wanted a family. I wanted an Alpha to take care of me, I wanted babies and a huge house and maybe to dress prettily and... Maybe role play, a little? I'm a kinky guy, I think you noticed that..."
Harry moved downward, his tongue circulating Draco’s cunt, lustfully teasing his husbands most precious treasure. Harry wanted both of them to feel how momentous this was; for both of them to find oblivion in what was previously forbidden.
The thought of this made his orgasm build further, and he could only nod his head as Draco offered up his smart wet mouth. The pressure was ferocious as he drove his cock forward into Draco’s mouth. He was coming, his release so staggering, such bliss.
Draco couldn't wait anymore. With a last kiss, he packed up the things he took off from his bag and they made the slow, slow way back to the hotel. They couldn't just apparate to it since it was all muggle, after all, and maybe the trip was there to make expectation bigger.
"What lie did you tell them, Nott?" Draco asked, anger and fear rising up to his brain.
Harry knitted his hands through Draco’s, and led him into the bedroom.  He lay Draco down carefully, and rummaged through the bottles that littered Draco’s dressing table. Harry came up with a small bottle of vanilla fragranced oil, and slicked up both his hands.
He’d loved Draco’s humour, his mannerisms. He’d loved how they laughed together and how he could be completely himself. They’d been able to talk about everything, and he’d fallen hard before he even knew it had happened.
was having.
Harry brushed a careful finger over Draco’s wrist. “I’m falling for you, Draco. I can’t help myself. I’ve always been the same. My emotions can never stay buried.”
He got away from Harry, grabbing his wand and moving it in a complex manner before touching its tip to his lower stomach.
As if almost beyond his control, Harry’s fingers started to slip down beyond the waist of Draco’s pants, finding the top curve of his round arse cheeks, pert and perfect just for him.
Draco.
“You have no self-control whatsoever, Potter,” Draco teased, his hands going up and starting to remove his fancy robes, button by button. “It seems that I failed to teach you patience.”
mess people about. When I said I was falling for you, I was telling you the truth.”
Draco looked magnificent, drenched from the bath, his wet hair tangled and damp on his head. Harry’s abrupt and reckless thrusts were splashing the walls, their limbs tangled and hot.
was Draco. He didn’t think that he really did love him, but it was a lovely sentiment.
He’d cooked Draco’s favourite egg salad sandwiches and brought a bottle of an elf made wine they both loved.
“That’s absolutely fine, darling. I’ll settle you down here and wait for you in bed. Just so you know, I don’t tend to wear anything to sleep but you can do whatever makes you feel most comfortable... Call me if you need anything.”
“Draco, I’ve been meaning to find time to talk to you. We’re both young still... And you’ve only just started having sex. I’m worried our conversation the other day put pressure on you. Maybe we should spend some time getting you used to this before you try getting pregnant?”
Harry filled his mouth with Draco’s whole cock, sucking hard and making sure his tongue got everywhere. Saliva dripped from his mouth, and he knew he must look terribly inelegant, but Harry truly didn’t care.
Harry took a photo of his erection from above, pleased with the way it lay, hot and huge against his stomach.
Harry kissed Draco’s soft mouth. “You don’t need to promise orgasms, love. I don’t stick around because of the sex.” He caressed Draco’s cheek with the back of his hand.
“So... You were saying something about choosing clothes for me? Wouldn’t want anyone to imagine you looking like this, flushed, panting and covered in my come...” Harry traced for his wand. It’d have to be a cleaning spell, were they to have any hope of making their appointment.
And she did. When he arrived at her house, she gave him a strong dose of vodka, and hugged him tightly as he talked to her everything that happened that day. She kissed his head and told him everything would be alright. That he had her. That she'd always be his friend - his
Harry wondered what Draco would think to that message. He closed his eyes, knowing he didn’t have long to wait.
Harry was both surprised and aroused by Draco’s reaction. He didn’t think he’d ever seen this level of want in her face, or how angry her face was. And maybe he was a little angry as well.
Harry laughed, glad to see Draco back at his entitled, needy best. It was even better to hear him demanding and excited.
Harry couldn’t help himself. Laughing again, he pulled Draco to him, kissing a line down his jaw and stroking the shell of his ear.
The room around them was silent, and Harry shivered a little with both the cool of the night, and the emotions that were running through his body.  He stroked a fingertip down the side of Draco’s delicate face, marvelling at how soft his skin was, like it was made of the softest silk.
It made Draco's blood boil. He knew he was being irresponsible, being completely drugged on his heat and the marvellous feeling of being in love with someone. But now that his heat was over, and he had his mind in the head above his neck, he needed to do
When it was time, Draco left the building almost flying. He got into his black BMW, going home. He wanted to be flawless for Harry.
He didn't complete it, though. He curled against Harry and closed his eyes. He was going to have a baby. This was the important thing now.
She had a kid, a hot husband... Of course,
“Personally, I like the idea of all this come messing you up, soaking into your skin. You don’t have to look perfect for me.” Harry kissed Draco lightly, enjoying how dishevelled his husband looked, how undone they both were.
Harry laughed. “Back to sleep? Such a lazy omega. You’ve just slept most of the night.” He focussed on rubbing his hands over Draco’s ribs, fingertips pressing into the soft, creamy flesh. The smell of vanilla, and Draco’s sweet scent filled the room, and made Harry feel so eroticised he nearly groaned.
“You might be correct on that, or you could be mistaken. Maybe if you tried harder to woo me…I would be more inclined.” Draco snarked as he hit the end call button on the shop’s phone.
"M-My mum... She called me... Asked me to go back... To reconsider..." Draco raised his head, his face red and wet, he tried to control his sobs but couldn't stop sniffing. "I told her I couldn't... She said I'd no longer be a Malfoy and... and... and I told her I'd rather be a Potter 'cus you'd never shut me out..."
“Yes, Harry... Take me again...”
“But you’d never be owned by me. You’d be your own person. But we’d be a couple; be two sides of the same coin.”
"Maybe it was him," Draco said, while he waited for Harry to come and give him food. "He likes me, I think. He smells like he feels aroused all the time. I thought I was just getting confused because I've never mated, but... Harry, I think he wants... He wants... You know?  To be my first. He knows I've not 'lost it' yet."
“I want this, love. I really do. I hope it’s true”
The evening wore on, the guests lavishing love and affection on the couple before making their goodbyes. As midnight approached, they found themselves alone.
"Harry... What you said earlier, about marrying me... Was it true? Would you really? Because... Because I
Draco was an absolute hurricane that day. He was pissed, and pissed Draco wasn't a good Draco. His employees were obviously unhappy with that, and poor Olivia almost cried. When he entered Harry's office, his eyes were pure metal: gray and cold.
“Oh, Merlin, Harry...! Ah! I'm going... Already, I'm going to... “ he bit his bottom lip, hard, and came, his body trembling from head to toe with the intensity of it.
Draco sipped on his wine again, trying to forget the day in which they would have to be apart.
But what made Harry hardest of all was how Draco was finally
"Well, Mother, I could've stayed if you didn't want to force me to marry Nott," he said, his voice failing him and getting out of his throat way too low.
“You look ravishing. I’ve never seen anything like you in my life.” Harry gasped, his hand holding Draco’s hair carefully, and guiding his body as close as he could manage.
He run to their wardrobe, picking up the cutest, most beautiful lace knickers he had in soft baby blue and put them on. He got his wand and, concentrating, he spelled his nipples more sensitive. He touched them slightly, feeling them a little sore and puffier than before, and moaned a little.
Harry kissed a line down Draco’s jaw, tiny innocence kisses to show the reverence he held for the man sat next to him.
The market place wasn’t like any Harry could remember seeing in the UK or anywhere on a Quidditch tour. It was busy, with objects covering the surface of every stall.
Everything was like a dream come true, and he had a partner, a job and a life unlike any he’d dreamed possible when he was just an orphan locked in a cupboard.
He saved the number on his phone and sent him a message. Draco thought a little about what to say. He wanted to be honest, but also not so much in case Potter didn't want it.
Harry looked at Draco, not even sure what he should say to rectify the situation. He closed his eyes, and leant back in his chair.
was that he told Ron, Hermione and the rest of the Weasley clan to their faces. He couldn’t have the sodding gossip columnists at the Prophet announce it before he’d said something.
He drained his flute and helped Draco back into her coat. Lightly threading his fingers through Draco’s hands, and they walked to the local apparition point.
Draco's body was lightned by a lightning bolt. His body arched from the towel, and his leg slipped from his hand before he could grasp it back up again.
He shook his head, surprised at the level of his desire. He wondered if Draco would be amenable to coming to the OIW with him. They could be professional colleagues during the day, and spend their nights in the throes of hot, sweaty passion.
Harry felt his own orgasm building deep within his stomach. His whole body was tingling, his head was spinning... He felt like every cell of his body was aflame with fire and that it was spreading relentlessly.
"Anything for you, sweetie."
“How do we even understand them, Harry? I can barely understand the name of the rival team!” Draco sighed, biting her lower lip. She criss-crossed her legs on the settee, thinking for a moment. “Okay. I guess if I don't get on the field and you apparate me to places we'll be fine. I heard that they don't have a floo line, Harry. We'll probably have to use a portkey.”
He moaned lowly when Harry talked in his ear, imagining all of what Harry was saying.
“We went on a date already, one per customer, sorry Harry.”
“I loved everything too, Draco. Okay... I’ll get my stuff. I’m just trying to be respectful here, no need to be difficult about it.”
"What's this, Iris?" Draco asked, pointing at her boat toy, and she showed it to him.
“Half past eight,” the mediwitch said, and Draco nodded.
There was nobody in the world that he’d rather be stood next to, in a bustling market place in Brazil.
, but he knew it wasn't the time.
He knew this was something that they had to talk through, to discuss and support each other with, because Harry knew the gender identity of another person was non-negotiable.
"Oh, thank goodness. My flat is number 504. Press buttons 0034504 and it will open the door at the reception for you. Just come over asap!"
“Harry... Let me suck you off... Please... I need your cock in my mouth
Harry’s heart was racing as Draco moved towards him. The other man’s body was so perfect. He looked as if he’d been sculpted from marble and brought to life.
-x-x-x-
Harry pushed forwards, his erection huge and needy, and so ready for Draco’s gorgeous white form. Draco was tight, tighter than he’d ever imagined, vicelike in the way it cling around his length.
Draco laughed with Harry's words, a laughed that was from deep within his heart, pure and unreserved.
“I’m not going to say no,” Harry wrote quickly before his nerve failed him.
In this mean time, Draco didn't feel pressured at all. Actually, he felt free. He didn't do much with Harry, just some touching, maybe some licking and sucking, but no more than that. He often thought about letting Draco touch him over his pants, but he felt like it was too much for some playful touching.
Draco wanted to mate because he loved the person, not only because they were a rich alpha from a good family.
Draco snuggled even more against Harry, sighing contently.
He slip out of Draco’s arms and walked through to his very modern kitchen. It seemed like something from a hotel, all chrome and sleek lines. He looked in the fridge; Draco’s delivery service had supplied some bacon. He supposed he could easily make them bacon sandwiches. How very
Draco couldn't open his eyes. He was completely lost in the pleasure.
“Can I help you?” Draco asked curiously.
He was enjoying living in this bubble with his wife; right now he didn’t want to share her with anyone.
Except the savings he had on Pansy's account.
“We'll do it, whatever this
Draco felt fabulous on his cock, she really did. Tight and scalding hot, and moving so frantically, Harry knew it wouldn’t be too long till he was filling her, stretching her full of his come.
Draco sighed when he read the text, his hand going down to touch his small cock from over his pants fabric. It didn't quite reach the elastic of it, even hard. He put his fingers inside his pants, going down past his cock and slightly touching the connection between his cock and his cunt. He was terribly sensitive there, and his whole body tingled with desire.
Despite the early hour the alpha felt himself drift off to sleep alongside Draco. Harry supposed it was the emotion of the last few days catching up but his eyes closed nearly as soon as they hit the pillow.
They started to show the results of the first week. As they showed it, Draco started to help them come up with actions to fix problems or to make improvements even better. At some point, Draco addressed Harry.
you?"
“Promises, Potter. When will you learn to act before you talk?” Draco teased, a smile on his lips. He held himself on Harry's shoulders and didn't wait for him. He just impaled himself on Harry's cock, biting his lower lip to control the moan that wanted to get out from his throat.
He sent, and whimpered with need. It wasn't enough!
“Oh, Merlin, it's been ages since I drank anything with alcohol,” Draco smiled widely as she held her flute of champagne, looking at Harry with shine in her eyes as the touched her glass with his. “To our precious miracle. I still can't believe we have her. Sometimes it seems like a dream, that one day I'll woke up and I won't feel her soft hair or baby smell with me.”
I won’t ask you to forgive me, Draco. I suspect that broomstick has flown. Perhaps you’ll let me have the honour of dancing with you though, at the wedding? I might have been thoughtless enough to lose you, but please let me have a memory of holding you close, one final time.
Draco looked at his wrist, then looked at Harry's face. He wasn't scared, no, but Harry didn't understand he had nothing he could do to help.
After she washed, she combed her hair and dressed in leggings and a tunic, her special bra on. Her leaking breasts were annoying, but... It made her horny. She kept imagining Harry touching them and they leaking onto his hands... But she couldn't possibly have sex with her body like this.
“Harry, you're so big... I'm so full of you...” She whispered, starting to ride him, holding Harry by his shoulders and going up and down.
her to take my bond, I thought that was what it meant to be in love... But I’d never regret the relationship, because it gave me Lyra, and she’s the greatest gift of my life.”
He near panicked when he smelt burn bread. He all but threw his phone on the counter, trying to take the toasts off the toaster, burning his fingers. When he managed, his hands were buttered, the toaster smelt funny, but the cheese was resting prettily on top of them. Draco clapped his hands to himself, proud that he managed breakfast.
“Sticky!” Jasmine repeated, clapping her hands and grabbing another piece to feed Harry with it. “Dada, aaaaaah”
“We could've been together, but you took my baby and sent me away after someone said I should've given her to the Ministry. You were doing exactly what she said you should do. Forgive me for not being kind to you right now.”
“I’m going to break in this beautiful body, going to make you know your body so well. What you like, what makes you scream in delight... I’m going to fill you with my babies and watch you get so big with them. They’ll just be even more of you to find irresistible.”
Jasmine didn’t deserve to carry any of the ghosts of the past with her; she deserved a fresh start and a chance to live her own life, free of the shackles that both her parents wore.
When he woke up in the morning, he did the usual. Woke up, brushed his teeth and combed his hair, before taking a shower. As soon as he took his pants off, however, he could only see blood.
, Potter. I don't want to ruin everything because of this and,
Draco must feel heartbroken, it felt incredible to have him under his room, and so close there was barely an inch between them. Harry could feel the rumble of his breath in his chest, and the heady rush of hormones in his blood. Draco was under his protection, and it fired up the alpha part of his biology.
“We should get ready. Mother will be very angry if we get there late. Of course, she'll understand since we'd just married, but let's not make a scene, okay?” Draco smiled, getting away from Harry after another kiss. “I've chosen your clothes already, since you can't dress well for your life. Also, expect some people looking. It's a very expensive hotel, but we didn't actually buy all the reservations so there will be other people at the breakfast hall.”
Draco was looking to the mobile as if he could will Harry to answer faster.  He jumped a little when the thing made that chirpy sound that Harry assured him he could change, but he still didn't know how. He tried to hide his excitement, even though he was alone in his bedroom.
His whole body arched from the bed, his double orgasm taking him all over. His body was burning, tears forming on his eyes as he came, and came for what it seemed to be forever.
“I’m going upstairs now,” Harry said quietly, “and I’ll wait in your bedroom. Wait a couple of minutes and make some sort of excuse.”
And as if it was a scene from another world, maybe from a moving picture Harry showed her, the woman reached and grabbed Jasmine's arm, yanking her from Draco's arms. Draco hold on to her tightly, trying to release Jasmine's arm from the woman's hand.
He got inside the shower with Harry, hugging the taller man from his back and resting his head on Harry's muscular back.
"Have you heard of it?" Aunt Bellatrix started, her high and raspy voice torturing his ears. "That Bulstrolde girl, Millicent. Is seeing another alpha. Can you imagine the shame of her family?"
He leant over and kissed the remaining tears from her cheeks.
you?"
Harry trailed searing kisses all over Draco’s torso, finding his husband’s nipples with his mouth.
You’ll have received your invitation for Ginny and Luna’s wedding now, I expect? We’ll be in each other’s company for the first time in five years. I hope we can make polite conversation rather than a scene.
three pair of Manolo Blahniks? I mean… The price of this pair alone. Three of these could have paid our flat deposit…”
“Draco,” Harry said reverently, “your body is slicking up so beautifully. It’s doing entirely what comes naturally. Are you enjoying yourself? Your body is so responsive to mine, love.”
He looked at how Harry's hand moved above his, up and down, and started to try to replicate the touch. He wanted to please him, to make it good for him. His eyes were fixated on the pearl drops of his pre-come falling from the tip of his cock, and, without thinking, Draco got closer, licking the drop. The flavour was weird, salty and sweet at the same time, but when he did the first time, he wanted more. He kissed the head of Harry's cock, not trusting that it would fit his mouth, a licked slowly as his hand went up and down the shaft.
Harry was close, the sight of his beloved’s pert red lips around the end of his thick cock a turn on like nothing else he’d ever seen. Watching him work his own nipple was a pleasure in itself, and he stroked his own, feeling how hard and aroused his whole body was.
“There's only one way... One way to find out...”
“I don’t think any modern lady such as yourself needs to have me shackled to her... I promise you’d get bored of my antics very quickly.”
come? Pretty bad and with a bruised ego, right? I'm not an alpha, but let me assure you, omegas also have a sense of pride and mine was broken today. Sorry that I reacted so bad about it. I hope we're fine? XX"
A small part of Draco’s soul curdled and died, and he sat bolt upright, simultaneously trying to fling the accursed boxers across the room whilst trying to cover up his stiffy with his other hand.
“How can I make you feel just like the boy you are, Draco? What shall I do to you to prove that you’re mine, and mine alone?”
Harry could feel how closely Draco held him, and knew that he was loved. Draco wasn’t ever one to use a lot of words but Harry had never felt unwanted or unloved, and he intimately knew how that felt.
It looked like it wouldn't stop. His whole body was screaming with pleasure, his mind going blank.
Draco's eyes got big as saucers. He grasped Harry's hair tightly, unexpected pleasure running all over his body. Being hold that way, he was a bit scared of falling, but it was so good. He moaned so loud he was sure all the fucking building heard him.
Harry cleared his throat as the waiter came to take their orders. “What’s on the agenda today, then Draco? Are we visiting the factory again? Or would you like to have a day off together? I’ve got some ideas for a day off if you’re game.”
“I don't want to take off my pants, but... I guess you can touch me over it. On... My cock,” Draco started. “I'm sorry, it seems like you don't care about my period, but I feel disgusted by the smell and... The fluids and stuff. So I don't want to do it like I am now. But... We can touch. And I want you to see my lingerie, because I've bought it for this day, just for you.”
No, what he was worried about was Draco herself.
“That sounds like a dream, Draco” Harry murmured, carding his fingers through Draco’s soft hair. “We’d make the most wonderful babies. Chubby and beautiful. I’d look after all of you, love. And I’d be more than proud to have you wear my scar. But
Draco got beet red. He was used to Harry being verbal about his desires, but he couldn't just get used to sexting, as his boyfriend called it. He licked his lips, sitting better in the bed and answering with trembling hands.
"I guess you're done, baby girl. Now stay a bit quiet, papa is trying to stand up here," Draco held on the safety bars at the side of the tub that Harry installed on his first pregnancy, and slowly lifted himself. At seven and a half months, he was absolutely
He knew virginity was a dumb concept and it was a dumb tradition he wanted to keep. But at that moment, he felt it was so worth it. He didn't feel like he was giving Harry his body. He felt like he was giving Harry
"Well, you were the best thing for our business, and I figured, since you were out of your last job, and we are out of the Malfoy Company's contract, you might as well come and work for us."
Draco felt sad as he saw Harry go without even giving him time to explain. He sighed, going to the bathroom to clean himself.
Draco was having the most amazing dream, where he was laying down in a field full of flowers, white and red, and Harry was there, creating a shadow over him with his hair all over his face. Draco laughed, and moaned a little when he felt the sensation of Harry's hand on his skin.
“You know how sensitive they are... That I like them played with... But I want more... I want you to fuck me while biting and sucking them, I want you to play with them non-stop, I want you to hold them hard as if...” then he stopped. He wasn't sure if he could say the last bit, but he had to. “As if you were milking me... Please, Harry... I... Do you think you can do it?”
“Harry, I need to come back now. Are you really fine?” he lightly touched Harry's leg, the one he had fixed in the game.
He would have to be happy with only blowjobs for a little more time.
Draco left for the continent immediately after.
“Ummm.... gorgeous.” Harry groaned, adoring every second. Draco’s tongue was just
First, he started to move his fingers faster, and he rubbed the end of his thumb on the sensitive head of Draco’s gorgeous cock, occasionally making a loose fist and giving him a quick tug too.
“I feel like I am a boy, now. I want you to treat me like a boy... But... Not Jasmine, I guess? Maybe... Not other people. Just you,” Draco closed his eyes, thinking for a moment. “Harry, as I keep thinking... That woman who said I'm a boy... She's wrong. She's completely wrong. But she's also right. I'm not a girl. I'm...
“But Draco, I know you want this... And so do I, more than you can know... But what about the test you did on yourself? I’m not a healer, but I thought that test showed you couldn’t have children?”
Maybe he could try to do something for Harry. Leaving the bathroom, he grabbed his phone and googled 'breakfast food'. He decided on toast, eggs and juice, since it seemed simple enough. First of all, he needed bread and butter. He used to keep his bread inside the refrigerator so it would last more, since he didn't eat much at home. He still had four slices, from three days ago. The smell was fine, so he supposed it hadn't gone bad yet. He buttered it as best as he could and put it in the toaster, pressing the buttons down and looking at it for a couple seconds before moving on.
He’d fought the world for them to accept they were together; battled aggressive newspaper headlines and their ugly insinuations; endured friends he’d thought were close blanking him.
Suddenly, a commotion behind them caught their attention. Harry snapped his eyes to the room as he immediately recognized the voice shouting within.
It was so close to himself, and Draco felt his body so open, so
Harry continued to stroke and caress Draco, touching her all through her orgasm. He loved how she was underneath him, a sexy warm presence that was the most attractive person he’d ever known.
When he was on the hospital bed, legs opened so the doctor could check whether he was still a virgin or not, he checked his phone, trying to look unimpressed. After a couple of uncomfortable touched and lights directed to his most private areas, the declaration of 'still a virgin' to his parents made him relax, but he didn't show it.
Draco let Harry feed him, looking at him with adoration in his eyes. Harry felt like everything to him, now. Everything he ever wanted. He swallowed his food almost automatically, and smiled lightly when Harry kissed his lips.
“She’ll love it. Everything is warm, safe and beautiful... But I’m far more worried about you, Draco,” said Harry with a frown. “It’s obvious that you’re still in a lot of pain. You need to take your own recovery seriously as well. Your body has taken a massive shock and you need to be relaxing, not forcing your body into a different shape.”
And they lived happily ever after.
“More than excited. Ecstatic. It’s going to be the most gorgeous day of my life... bonded to the most wonderful man”.
Harry knew then that he was going to get utterly lost in this, that he would be transformed. He couldn’t wait.
“Lyra is in her bed,” Harry said, motioning for Draco to sit on his sofa. “We won’t be disturbed... Thank you for calling me, love. Just take your time. My home is yours now, forever if you like. Would you like a coffee, or something stronger?”
and wanted it
Harry leant over to kiss his daughters head. “Lyra, Draco might have plans for this evening. It’s rude to pressure people, even if you do want them to come.” Harry winked at Draco, really pleased that the two most important people in his life were getting on so well.
“That's not what I mean!” Draco shook his head, almost aggressively, his hands turning into fists. Well, at least the anger would make him say the dreadful words. “I'm bleeding! I'm fucking bleeding! Of all days of my life, my period decided to arrive today and I've been sad the whole day because of it! There! I said it!”
Draco tucked Harry in again, closing his zipper with a devious smile. He grabbed him by his hand and walked him to his bedroom, pushing Harry so he would sit in his bed. Draco was too aroused, but he could stop a little to set boundaries to that... thing they were having.
And no, I’ve not got a row of omegas waiting for me... I’d love to show you some things, as long as we can keep our working lives and our professional lives separate?
Harry kissed his husband soundly, stoking his back and running his fingers through his hair.
“That was beautiful, you know?
He felt his whole body getting hot with this. The sex was a pretty big indicative that they were married, of course, but this? Harry was touching him in front of Draco's
After a couple of hours Draco felt like she needed to push, and push she did. She was an utter hero, in utter agony; her face broken in pain. But then, suddenly, their baby was with them, and Harry was shocked and amazed to find out they were the parents of a daughter. A little girl! It was beautiful moment;
“Harry, are you done?” he asked from the kitchen door, looking at himself in the hall mirror.
The first few hits didn’t say much that he didn’t know, but an academic article grabbed his attention. He read for a few minutes, thinking about Draco and their relationship.
"Hello, Potter," he said, pretending to be professional, although he wanted to cry. "Let's go?"
Harry thought he had never seen a sight as sensuous as Draco coming; his hot slick wetness entered his mouth and spread across his face. It was gorgeous stuff, rich and sweet and it made Harry’s heart beat race, with the erotic charge of the moment.
“I think the baby looks like me at the moment. Not gorgeous like you. A bit of an odd shape at the moment, but I’m sure they’ll improve as they grow a bit... And you’ll be growing alongside them Draco. You, big with our baby will be the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen”
-x-x-
"Harry... Harry...
Harry curled himself around Draco, not wanting there to be even a breath of space between the pair of them. Had he been only able, Harry would have liked to have crawled inside of Draco’s skin and joined their bodies like their souls already were.
Harry’s body shuddered in desire; Draco’s body was so neat and perfect and he wanted to be his first for everything. Clutching Draco’s smooth white thigh, Harry pushed his finger in deeply, the scolding heat and incredible tightness making him groan in delight.
He couldn’t wait to tell Lyra about the bond, and tell her that Draco wasn’t going anywhere, not ever again. Harry wasn’t a fool though. He knew there’d be hard days ahead. Draco’s parents wouldn’t be pleased at the humiliation of their son’s bond with an older man with a child. But that was a problem for tomorrow.
"I love this, too... I can't help but think it would be the perfect moment to have your mark..." Draco whispered, putting his hands under his head and closing his eyes. "Harry... If you weren't working at my company... What would you do for a living?"
Harry lurched awake at Draco’s shake of his shoulders. For several seconds he had no idea what was going on; his wife didn’t seem capable of speaking, and she was she seemed terribly shocked.
“I’m not going to pressure you, sweetheart. If we shower it’s not because I want it to lead to sex... It’s because I want us to be together with any barrier. If you’re worried about your period, get yourself sorted and I’ll join you in five minutes... but if you’d prefer to go to bed that’s fine too-”
you are.”
Soon enough, it was time. They both were to walk down the aisle together, representing their freedom of choice, and then, be bonded and say their vows.
-x-x-
Draco couldn't answer. He was completely overwhelmed with the touch and the feelings that Harry's words were projecting on him. He couldn't help but imagine everything in his head, his legs trembling. His cock was so hard, the head was leaking precome, and he moaned loud.
"I'd love to, Mr Ollivander. But... Will there be a possibility that I worked at a home office, instead of going to the company every day? Of course I'd do on camp visits, but with the company being in another city and me having just mated with my alpha..."
He looked for his favourite brand and found it on the top shelf. Sighing, he tiptoed, trying to get it but his fingers couldn't reach it. He couldn't use his wand at Tesco, and he couldn't just climb the shelves with the risk of hurting Jim, so he looked around to see if he could find someone to help him.
He was having fun, though.
He got up, still completely naked, and walked to a mirror, looking at himself. He looked good. Beautiful, and somehow different. He looked... Complete, with the mark on his neck.
“I'm just really good at faking that I'm okay, Harry,” Draco said, a tight smile in her lips.
Harry's mouth felt wonderful. He did that before, but never when Draco was so open and so needy for something inside him. Every flick of Harry's tongue was like a teaser for something bigger and better. Draco knew, he was so sure he could take him, that every cell on his body was asking why he wasn't balls deep inside him yet.
He loved the sheer bliss that seemed to be radiating out of every pore of his beloved’s body, and the sight of him, slick soaking his lithe thighs, his cunt ready and willing and his beautiful cheeks flushed sent shockwaves radiating though Harry’s whole body. His prick was massive and swollen, shiny with his own pre-come. Even getting his cock in position made his body vibrate in pleasure.
He was feeling at home in Harry's arms, and his mind was fixed on the strong arms holding him, the comfortable chest, the marvellous scent that he had...
was something special. Harry needed to keep his head though, and not presume about Draco’s need. He’d thought his lover was innocent previously, but the sight in front of him proved otherwise. Harry slicked up a third finger, and rubbed it along Draco’s slick, dripping entrance. He was able to push it in easily.
Harry didn’t think much of their seeker, but then, he only ever had eyes for the man sat beside him.
“I won’t, love... I’m going to fill every hole, make you all mine. I’m going to give you such fabulous shag... Fill your cunt with my come...”
for an answer. “Mother and baby need quiet and sleep, right now, and so do you. You can come back and visit at nine tomorrow morning”.
“I wanted to smash that trophy against your skull. Luckily for you, I love you and I don't want you dead,” she said, trying to think, trying to see reason in the mess in her mind. “I'm sorry. I was-- I
. Just show them my credentials and they'll let you get through. I love you too, Harry... Thanks for being so calm earlier. I'm sure I wouldn't be here without you.”
“You can talk about whatever you want, Draco,” laughed Harry. He was well used to the sudden bursts of sarcasm, and knew that taking it too seriously meant it could last for hours.
Instead, he moaned lowly against Harry's chest, breathing in deeply. Harry had such a masculine, marvellous smell, like leather and wood, and it made Draco shiver all over.
“Draco,” Harry asked urgently, “what’s the emergency, love? Is there anything I can do... Talk to me, please. We can get though anything Draco, just please talk to me.”
That was a role entirely reserved for his fiancé, Draco Malfoy.
Harry was surprised once more by Draco. The sudden sensation of his hot, wet mouth taking in as much of his cock as possible was just magnificent and he groaned in appreciation.
. This omega was a million miles outside of his experience. Too rich, too posh and his boss to boot.
Draco smiled slightly with Harry's attempt to cheer him up, but being honest, he wasn't in the mood. He felt sad. Maybe in the future he'd get used to the possibility of being just him and Harry, but for now... It was too raw.
But Harry had to admit that he felt a strong sense of disquiet at Draco’s choice to run this errand on his own. Maybe they’d fallen more deeply than even he’d imagined, for the idea of being away from each other was starting to feel awful. Goodness! How typically alpha was he starting to sound!
“Sir it sounds like we are getting quite a few owl orders in. Do you want me to fill them?” Elijah asked moving out of Draco’s way.
"Maybe if the chocolate is not
Harry sighed, his breath hitching in his throat. He hadn’t felt this turned on in an age, and his whole body ached with want. Holding Draco still he wriggled out of his trousers, his blunt heavy prick bouncing between them both.
"I want us to be here... Me, you, and Lyra... Maybe I'll be big with a baby and Lyra would want to be an amazing big sister... I'd love it... So much, Alpha..."
“I’m yours... Just, only yours Draco,” Harry’s heart was racing with the exquisite pain of his husband’s hair pulling, the plush touch of his body pressing against his own.
As it was Harry felt the energy drain from his body. Two orgasms in such a short while, plus all the emotions of their day meant that he was beyond exhausted. Hugging the other man tightly as the water pooled beneath them, he whispered into his lithe white neck.
have a kid with someone else, would you?” Draco asked, raising his head and trying to control the jealousy in his heart, that tried to claw its way out. “I swear to Merlin, Potter, I'd rip their throat off. And yours too.”
The day was good, thinking professionally. They talked about the improvements Harry suggested, and they decided to visit the company on the next day to have a huge meeting with the employees of Ollivander's so they could trace an Action Plan.
Draco’s and his scent intermingled, and Harry’s entire body felt sensitive and sexy. They’d known each other only four days, but Harry knew it’d never been this good with Ginny, or any other partner in his life. It was as if Draco had been cut from marble, a statue made only for him to regard. This was all he could imagine wanting forever.
Harry jerked fully awake at that comment. Any thoughts of sleep were abandoned.
They stayed like this for some minutes, the novelty of their daughter’s absence not lost on Harry. Eventually, he pulled away from Draco’s soft, warm lips, and stroked a finger done the side of her tender face.
Harry gently pulled Draco’s warm body on top of his, and lent down to kiss his lover’s sweat dampened forehead.
"I wish I could marry for love, Harry. I wish I could have babies with an alpha I love. But I know my family is pampering me for the perfect alpha. Probably already chosen. And I'll live an unhappy life as my husband or wife take the reins of my beloved company and I carry cute, perfect alpha babies, or omega disappointments."
“Okay... then we won’t hold ourselves back, we’ll surrender ourselves to each other. I can’t lie, Draco. I want more of what we had last night. You’re intriguing, and gorgeous. Come and find me after the presentation, and I’ll give you something to think about all night... Harry.”
His cock felt tight and uncomfortable in his trousers, straining as it was against Draco’s round backside, so he pulled them off roughly, panting as he did so, his body consumed with lustful thoughts. Moving back to Draco, Harry started edging down his husbands trousers.... The less clothes either of them wore, the better it suited Harry.
Harry took a deep breath, and repaired the vase. He disappeared the water and the flowers, and laid down his wand. He pulled Draco’s tear-soaked face to his chest and rubbed small circles on his back, all the time whispering
He held Draco’s hand at that point, to reassure and show love. If initiate touching was what the other man wanted, then he could also lead him to their bedroom.
Taking a moment to centre himself, Harry stroked a hand across the dip of Draco’s belly, allowing himself the luxury of imagining the fluttering of new life beneath his palm.
"It's late, Harry. I have to go. Have a good night," he was going to finish there, but with an afterthought, he added: "I... Quite like you, Harry."
Oliver grinned. The daft git had known Harry since he’d been just a little kid of just eleven, and Harry knew he couldn’t hold a grudge for long against him. He was pretty annoyed that Wood hadn’t said anything before though.
In private Harry was a man possessed, for with every meeting his weakness for Draco’s touch was deepening, and his appetite for his body increasing. Their first touch had opened the floodgates within him, and he was driven to wank himself to the point of agony, Draco’s name on his lips as he came.
. She’s beautiful, kind. So funny. You’ll see how wonderful it is to have a child in your life. I take her to the cafe after school on Tuesdays. I’d love to share her with you.”
Harry kissed Draco everywhere he could reach, running his fingertips slowly thought his hair and listening to the thrum of Draco’s heartbeat under the thin material of his top.
He opened the door, completely naked and wet, and smiled naughtily to his alpha.
“Are you ready, darling?”
He closed his eyes, feeling warm and cosy between his mattress and Harry's body. He clung to Harry even more, his tired mind turning off bit by bit.
Draco got beet red with Harry's comment, and hid his face into Harry's chest. It was weird, being embarrassed of such a comment when Harry was playing with his breast in such an intimate way.
“Fuck, Harry... You're so hot... Your body is so perfect over mine...”
He held his knickers by the elastic between his legs and pulled it aside, taking a picture. He took others, selecting the right one to send.
He could hear Pansy's smile on the other side of the line, and couldn't help but reply:
Draco smiled, and then thought about what Harry had asked.
Before Harry could kiss him, he put a hand on Harry's chest, keeping him in place, even though he didn't know if his boyfriend was going to go for it as soon as they were alone, or if he wanted to wait a little more.
Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He was sickened by Draco’s words, and the idea that any father could show his son the door. That any father could throw away a life’s work and gift it to another. It was disgusting, and repulsive. Harry knotted his fingers through Draco’s, and let the omega have a moment to get his breath.
Harry did, feeling the joy blossom throughout his whole body. He’d missed Draco so much, felt like a half of his heart was absent every single day. It’d been an agony and this,
Feeling Harry's mouth on his body, his movements, his desire, and his come filling him from the inside, Draco came
(and how he
They apparated straight to the spell Damage Ward, Susan leading the way. Harry heard snippets of conversation floating around them. He winced when he overheard whispers of “Malfoy” all around.  If this concerned Draco, Harry absolutely could not be involved.
. Draco wasn’t normally one for refusing grooming of any sort, and he’d never been so sick he’d refused to get into a bath.
When Harry came back, Draco accepted the coffee mug, that mismatched the one Harry had, and smiled softly. Nothing in his home mismatched. They were bought to be part of a whole, and everything was perfectly on place.
The week flew by, and Harry couldn’t help but feel like Draco was consuming his every thought. He was glad he’d worked so hard on his accounts before they’d started their relationship. He could hardly focus, his desire being enough to drive him to the silliest of risks.
“Harry... Move... Make me feel good...” Draco asked, putting one of his hands down, touching his cock, that had gotten flaccid, but slowly was getting harder. “Yes... Yes, make me come like this... “
“Harry... “ she whispered, her tears falling on her cheeks, one hand still clutching her belly for dear life. “It's too soon... Too soon, Harry... “
He was aware that it was obvious how hard and tight his cock was for Draco, and he rolled his trousers against the silky lace of his husbands knickers, loving the friction between their bodies.
workers, Potter,” Nott sneered, spooning three large sugars into his tea. “After all, we’ve not seen anything of you... or Mr. Malfoy... all this week. Seemed like a bit of a coincidence to us workers, but hey, we’re not here to judge.”
“That sounds wonderful, Draco. We’ll go to London, get some lunch while we’re there. I’ll eat later; I’m not hungry at the moment.”
When they arrived at the hotel, Draco let the driver open the door for him, and he waited politely for Harry. His eyes were red and hurting, but he didn't cry. Yet.
The only thing that Harry decided was a pet. When he was growing up with the Dursley’s, one of the things he’d envied other children the most for were their animals - rabbits, cats and guinea pigs were all lovely, but he didn’t know if they would suit Draco. Maybe a magical creature, like a crup of some description? Harry decided he’d think about it a little more, and talk about it with Draco that evening. She might be furious about the idea; after all, he reasoned, she’d have to do most of the looking-after of whatever pet they chose.
She wanted her body back.
Draco was in another state of mind. He barely listened to what Harry said, his orgasm making him super aware of his sensations, but he wasn't much aware of what had been said. He opened his eyes, holding himself up by his elbows, and looking straight to Harry's cock.
Draco arrived home, finally. He was so tired he felt like sleeping for five years. He was in the field the whole day, watching over the game between the Appleby Arrows and the Caerphilly Catapults. They seemed like they wanted to kill each other that day, and he had to fix two legs, three shoulders, and send two to St Mungo's because he couldn't just fix them on a stretcher.
Harry felt absolutely superb sitting so close to Draco. So much smaller than he was, it was as if they’d been made to fit together. He was warm, his hair soft in his fingers and his breath against Harry’s neck smelt sweet and intoxicating. He wanted take Draco, mark him, love him forever. But he knew that it could wait. They would have forever.
Draco’s body looked absolutely blissful, anyway. The soft curves of a whole week of rich food made Harry’s stomach coil and wriggle with want; his husband’s hair felt soft and glossy under his fingers, and Draco’s arse cheeks had just the right amount of curve under the palm of his hands....
"I don't fear the wrath of my parents. I fear the consequences of it. I'll lose everything I know, Harry.
Draco worried his bottom lip. He didn't want to be discovered just now. He wanted to at least enjoy a couple of months.
"Fuck, Potter, you're not supposed to be here!" Draco said, although he smiled and kissed Harry on his forehead. "It's early, they'll soon get knock into our doors to deliver room service. You have to get out just about
“But is he a friend, like _mummies_ friend Blaise? The sort that you kiss? I’m never kissing a boy, ever!”
Harry shoved his phone back in his pocket, and rushed out of the door. Perhaps he was being less cautious than he was used to, but right at that second he didn’t care. All he wanted was his perfect omega, right where he truly belonged: embraced in his very own arms.
He felt his throat hurt from the moaning, but he couldn't stop. It was just too much. Before he could hold himself, his legs failed him and he started to fall.
you hadn't said I love you just an hour before. Which leads me to think... You'd say 'I love you' for whatever reason. And I'll never know if you're being honest or if you're just happy because I made you come."
“What a compliment,” Harry smiled. “I’m not sure I’m as hot as all that and I’m certainly not young. As for the fucking part, I think we need more practice to make sure. Maybe that could be this afternoon’s aim?”
freeing. It felt right, at the time, just like it was right to feel like a boy from times to times.
“Well,
“Your body is beautiful, so perfect and flawless... I’d love to mark you, cover you with bites and make you feel like the
. Because you’re kind, and funny. Now go get your shower. We’re due to meet Lyra in the West-End in a couple of hours.
Harry couldn’t remember a time he’d felt this satisfied, this sated, and he couldn’t wait till they were able to try again. “You’re a gorgeous lover so expect to be just as sticky and gross next time. Too beautiful to resist, sweetheart.”
Draco looked gorgeous too. For some reason his lips looked especially kissable and Harry was incredibly tempted to do so, but he resisted. They would be there all evening if he gave in to temptation now...
Draco was still high from his orgasms. Feeling so many emotions at once was too much for his mind and body, and he needed time to come back to reality. His body was limp and he was sure he could just sleep there on the floor, no problem.
He was still half-hard from their earlier encounter, and Harry felt his cock fill and harden further as Draco manoeuvred his hand to her sensual, hot, and most intimate place.
They were traveling for work later that day, but Harry had been due to leave with Draco anyway. Sure, his bags were still at home but it wouldn’t take more than twenty minutes for their rental car to swing by and pick those up. They didn’t have to leave for ages.
He grabbed Harry's leg, opening his eyes to see where Harry's hand was going. He was shocked to see, though, the soft part between his legs. Being pale as he was, everything marked his skin. Between his legs, there were purple spots from his crotch to half of his thigh.
He looked at his toasts, and then back at the pickle between his fingers... Maybe...?
Turning back to Draco, Harry lifted his hands in a sign of surrender. He thought he’d let Draco stew for a few minute or so, and talk to her during breakfast. She was probably starving too; he certainly was.
“I’ll come over to yours now if you’ve not got any plans... I’ve missed you so much this week, missed your scent and your company. I’m desperate just to relax alongside you... Text me love, and tell me what you think”.
He was surprised by Harry's question. He blinked, trying to remember what he was thinking so he could answer.
“Hi baby,” he replied. “I wanted to tell you that I’m having a special time here with Draco. I think he’s becoming quite an important person in my life…”
Not bothering to wrap a towel around himself, Harry padded back through to the bathroom. He picked the luxurious lotion that Draco had been using earlier, and poured a generous amount under the running water. Walking back, his cock swinging as he walked, Harry picked up Draco, and carried him though as easily as if he weighed nothing.
Harry lent over and kissed Draco’s soft hair. He loved having her close, having her next to him like this. He knew that she’d never change; and Harry knew that he didn’t want her to. He was happier when she was herself.
“It's just a question, don't get so worked up,” Draco felt embarrassed, and crossed his arms over his chest, hiding it as he usually did when he was ashamed of something.
Draco kissed his lips and caressed his hair damp with sweat.
Harry hoped he’d been convincing, because he’d told Wood they were going during a fire-call only half an hour before.
"I... I don't know what to say, sir. It is an honour that you've considered me. If I accepted it... Would I be doing the same job as I did before?" He asked, because he had plans now that he was mated, but he was good at it, and it was an amazing opportunity. He couldn't just let it pass.
Their whole year has been spent in the pursuit of this Equinox fertility rite. Draco had swallowed a murky concoction of milk thistle and liquorice root when he’d woken each morning. He’d not sipped from a glass of wine for months and hadn’t smoked even an occasional cigarette. Every night before sleeping, Draco had walked into the garden of their home and pricked his finger, watching as a droplet of scarlet blood seeped into the earth. He’d even braided strands of his mother’s jet-black hair into his own.
Her breasts were bigger, and now she couldn't hide them on her palms like she could before. The nipples were a darker pink in colour, slightly puffier than before.
If Draco wanted to be the mummy to their baby, look after and care for them, then Harry thought that was just wonderful. He’d never, ever experienced the maternal love that Draco wanted to give, not when he was very young anyway.
Harry thought she was as just beautiful, tall and elegant as her son. She’d been massively encouraging of their relationship when Harry had felt too shy to seize happiness for himself.
And all the time he was utterly terrified; scared out of his wits that their baby was coming to early, that they’d not survive, or that Draco could haemorrhage and lose her life too. It was easily the scariest, most intimidating moment of his life, and he wished dearly that his own parents were with him in that moment. He’d never felt more alone in the world, most without a family until the moment came when he thought he’d lose his own forever.
Draco turned her a little so Harry could take some photos of their baby as they waited for someone. It didn't take long for a mediwitch to come with more potions. She lifted Jasmine's spell just for a moment so they could take better pictures and she took one of them three together. Draco wanted to make a whole wall full of pictures already, and she was excited to see how Jasmine would look in their tapestry, her name connected to Draco's and Harry's.
Draco kept looking at her, his cheeks burning, his heart pounding. He felt his eyes burn with tears as the name floated on his head.
He bit his lower lip, frowning a bit and thinking hard.
Harry found Draco’s lips, kissing him with depth and love. He whispered into his husband’s skin “Whatever you desire... I’m just ecstatic you never have to leave again...”
Minutes later, Harry was at Draco’s door, full of anticipation and excitement over having the younger man in his arms once more. He already felt half-hard with excitement with Draco’s simple scent, and he shouted out to warn his lover he’d arrived.
Harry slipped a hand onto Draco’s thigh, his fingers edging ever higher towards his husband’s hips. If Draco wanted to play games, Harry was certainly game. He just hoped he would be able to control how far he took things....
"Then bond with me, Harry... I want to have your mark on my neck... I want you to take me, completely. All of me, Harry." Draco kissed Harry's chin, then his lips, softly. "I'm at least fifteen days away from heat, and I know my day has been chaotic and overall terrible... But I'm making this decision out of my own mind. I want to be yours today, Harry. Please... Please have me."
He knew Harry was in the kitchen, getting something to drink as he announced not even two minutes ago, so Draco got an idea.
“You smell so fantastic. I could do this all day, Draco... But we need to talk. You need to tell me what this is, Draco. Tell me what you want me for.”
"But Harry... Wouldn't it... It technically would... You know... Make me not a virgin anymore?" Draco asked with his brows creased. "Can the doctors find out that I've been... playing with it?"
He lay his head against the back of Draco’s, struggling to get his breath, struggling to control the hammering of his heart that threatened to burst from his chest.
"What are you going to show me today, Harry?"
“I need new trousers. None of my fit me anymore. I know I've been eating too much caramel cake, but I've worked out in between.”
Worst of all, Harry had no shame. Not a spot or a jot. The Chosen One was obviously very comfortable in his body, for it seemed to be naked far more often that it was clothed. The man was an exhibitionist. A naturist.
“But it’s not because I care what Ginny would think. She’d not be jealous, or mad that I’d met somebody. We were never really as in love as that. We’re better off as friends. I mean, I
And Harry knew what he’d been denying the truth every day,
He let Harry hold him close, and it was indeed so, so good. He closed his eyes, feeling at home, as he always did when he was with Harry. He put his plate on the side table so he could be as close as possible to Harry.
“Don't even try to justify your acts! I know who you are! And you're
Draco felt his eyes water. He didn't want to upset Harry, but he was panicking. He bit his bottom lip, and swallowed hard.  He didn't even make an effort to get the towel when it hit him, and looked up to Harry.
For a long moment Harry simply couldn’t speak. That was one of the most intense orgasms he could remember and he could hardly get his breath. Pulling Draco from his knees, Harry held her close, stroking her head and kissing her cheek.
But Harry couldn’t change society, even if he wanted to. He could only bring up Lyra to respect all genders, whichever one she presented as.
“You’re so delicious... Inside and out,” Harry moaned, as he pulled out of the kiss. He broke off another piece of the chocolate and fed it slowly to Draco.
Harry had only had her in his life for less than a day but he knew, completely, that she had changed his life forevermore. If Draco wanted to tell the quibbler, and the world, then so be it. She would still be their baby.
“Well, too bad! I think I had at least half of this plate of cheese,” Draco laughed, a little drunk on passion fruit juice. “We can have it, Harry! It is great! Jim loves it too!”
He then moved on to the juice, trying to find something on his fridge. He didn't have fruits either. He sighed. Well, he had to order coffee then. He rested his back on the counter, all forgotten about the toasts, as he ordered two cups of coffee to be delivered at his flat.
Draco forgot what he was going to say, putting his hand over his nose and trying to breathe. Then, he remembered.
do it.
“We should. I love when we are like this, only us enjoying each other. I love the galas, too, and all the fancy dinners that come with dating you, but... I guess I prefer wearing your clothes and breathing your smell...” Draco moved his face do Harry's chest, breathing in his husband's true scent and feeling calm. Harry smelled a little like amortentia - or maybe, amortentia smelled like Harry? - and it was something Draco would rather sniff, other than the disgusting aftershave. “Can I ask you something? Can you... Not wear perfumes or aftershaves or anything for a while? I just love your smell...”
“Don’t worry baby... I promise you’ll like this. You won’t be marked, and I assure you, you’ll feel wonderful.” Harry settled Draco onto his back on one of his thick towels and rubbed any dampness off his skin. “Now, you need to relax. Hold onto your thighs, and hold them up, spreading your legs a little bit... Okay, I want to see your wanton, sexy little hole, all tight and perfect for me”.
He moved aside, and motioned for Draco to enter his home. He’d never been there before, and Harry thought that seemed like a bad sign.
“Hush now,” said Harry, kissing away each of the traitorous tears that had spilled. “My poor love. You must know that you’ll never lose me. Even if we have to live in secret, in the shadows, then I’ll accept that. You’re worth that sacrifice. Listen, Draco:
Harry speared a mouthful of the Quiche and ate it thoughtfully, Draco still sat on his knee. “Don’t worry about Lyra,” he added, swallowing a gulp of coffee. “She adores you. She’ll be as pleased as a poached pear that you’re here forever. Maybe you could give her a call in a bit though? I think that’d go down well with Ginny and Blaise too, especially as you’ll be living here. Now, please! Eat.”
After he was ready, he sat on his settee and scrolled on his phone, waiting for Harry.
Draco touched his lover's face, admiring how handsome he was. And completely his.
Draco dressed in his usual clothes when he was at home - a t-shirt and some black, simple knickers. He went to the bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth, and when he left, the amazing smell of bacon and coffee assaulted his nostrils.
He finished with his hair and looked at himself in the mirror, naked. He put the comb on the sink top and raised his hands, cupping his small breasts.
Draco didn't want to show so much insecurity, but he needed it. He needed Harry to know how he was feeling. He knew Harry was in the mood for sex now, but Draco wasn't, really. He felt like being sick, his stomach upset with feelings, and he closed his eyes, trying hard not to cry.
Harry was as amused by the older man as Draco obviously was. He was used to the condescension of these older alphas, especially these moneyed ones. He sincerely doubted it was mean, and he threw out a hand that was shook heartily.
Pulling away, Harry stroked Draco’s beautiful cunt with his fingers. It felt like satin under his fingers and he pressed a finger inside experimentally. Merlin, still so tight, but perhaps not as much as before.... Slowly, so slowly, he pushed in another finger and started to scissor him, tenderly but deliberate in his every touch.
He was having mixed feelings about it. He was feeling sated and happy that he had that moment with Harry, but he was also sad that he couldn't do what he wanted.
Harry loved it when Draco was honest about his sexy little body. The idea of his beloved waking up hard and covered in own come was an alluring one, and Harry found his cock growing even harder.
“But I think I deserve more torte... I’m a growing boy, Draco,” he murmured as he pushed his finger into the thick, creamy chocolate and wiped it down the thin skin over his lover’s clavicle, tenderly kissing, sucking and nipping it away, wanting to consume everything.
Harry heard his phone vibrate on the side of the and bed, and leant over to read Draco’s reply. He frowned, wondering briefly what Draco was planning. He laughed when he saw the
“I'm... Sixteen weeks...”
“Mummy, I want a little sister!” The kid said at her mother's side, and Draco started to hyperventilate. She forgot she had magic, she forgot how to use words. The only thing she could do was try to get far away as possible from this woman, try to make her get away from Jasmine, as her baby cried and screamed in fear.
Harry could tell from Draco’s body language that something was wrong. As the door has shut, his husband had placed a hand on his chest, effectively stopping him from going any further.
"Boo boo!" Iris asked, trying to lift his clothes. Draco sighed, smiling a little while lifting her to his lap and lifting his top and bra, her mouth immediately finding a nipple and suckling.
Draco felt his face burn under Harry's appreciation. He thought he would never get used to be looked like this. As if he was the most incredible person in the world.
“If I’m being honest, Draco... I don’t know what I’d do I lost my job, but it doesn’t matter. There are plenty of businesses, charities... Maybe I’d retrain, do something entirely different. But if you wanted to be a traditional omega, and stay at home, then that’d be fine. Maybe you could volunteer, or go back to school yourself. The world is your oyster, Draco.
“Queens marry princes, Draco. This country doesn’t actually even have a king.... You certainly look like you’re enjoying that-” said Harry, breaking off to bite his own burger.
“Alright, Draco,” Harry said, sitting down. “I don’t want to put pressure on you. You don’t need to talk if you don’t want to. But I could come into yours.... We could watch some cable or rent a film from Amazon? Just tell me what you want.”
"I have the whole thing planned already. I'll give you an explanation as soon as we leave here. But I don't want to have work related conversations here... I've never had something like this... Like
“This is the most profound moment of my life,” Harry murmured, just as his took the soft pliable flesh into his mouth.
isn’t a term I’d use Draco. What we were doing last night felt pretty bloody natural to me. I loved every second.”
Draco just couldn't reply Harry. His emotions were all over the top, his heart beating fast, his mind racing. He wished for it for so long, and then thought he'd lost it, and now that he had it... He had no idea how to react, how to say anything that would express what he felt in the moment.
"Boat! Papa! Papa! Paaaaapa!" She laughed, all of her white tiny baby teeth showing. Draco's heart melted, and he tickled her tummy, while she tried to take his hands off. "Th'top! Papa!"
“Look what you do to me love. I’m already so ready for you... So full of lust and love...”
His knot was full and aching, and the orgasm satisfied him so deeply. The sight of their cocks alighted was a huge turn on for Harry too, and he felt his body warm with desire. He’d have liked to pull Draco to his cock and knot him thoroughly, kiss Draco solidly and let him know how much he’d enjoyed their time together.
“I wish to have a baby boy, one day. So he'll look just like you.” Draco said, smiling and he let Harry carry him to the bathroom that night.
He grabbed Iris' little hands, helping her out of the tub and onto the mat. She giggled and wiggled her bum in a dance, moving her boat with her. Draco just smiled as he wrapped her, drying his baby girl while trying not to care about his back pain.
Draco’s mouth was so feverish, moving at such a pace, and his cock was swelling so hefty and heavy. Every part of his body felt hot and tight and then his spunk was spilling, unfurling, filling Draco’s throat and dripping over his chin. The release was so sudden and so strong that he gasped, the aftershocks rolling through his body.
Harry thanked Merlin that the Aurors were reasonable, and listened to the witnesses who’d seen the whole incident.
“And I know I’m in the right place when you’re in my arms,” Harry replied, snaking his arms around Draco. “Try to go to sleep. I’ll still be here when you wake up.”
Such smutty words coming from Draco’s mouth sent shockwaves straight to Harry’s cock and he was actually a touch embarrassed about how erotic he was finding it all. The problem was, Harry could quite imagine Draco’s cunt fitting snuggly around his cock.
"Harry... Harry, I'm ready... Fuck me, please...! Fuck your bloody boss in the arse," he said, out of nowhere, pleasure running over his body with the words. "Show him his place, alpha."
Harry broke off his words with the incessant beep of his mobile.  It was Lyra’s special tone, so he looked at the message straight away.
, that's what Draco kept thinking to herself. They spoke loudly and even through the translating spell, they had a really heavy accent. And it was different from the people she met from Rio when they visited the Manor when she was 14. Those people had a softer accent. These people now?  They spoke like thunder and heat was in their throats.
“Okay, baby,” said Harry, tucking her into bed. “I’m going to tell you a story about somebody else I knew that was a puppy, just like you... When I wasn’t much bigger than you, I had a Godfather, and could
But he couldn’t feel guilty. The sex had felt meteoric, like nothing else he’d ever experienced. He knew he wanted more, and if they had to take it slower next time, he was only too willing.
“I am,” she answered, a very serious expression on her face. “I’m Lyra Lily Potter. And you’re my daddy’s boss, Mister Malfoy. But he says that you’re his friend too, so that’s okay. We always come get because the milkshake is so yummy.” Lyra focused hard on the drink, blowing a few bubbles and laughing.
liked Draco. He was more and more beguiled and attracted as the hours passed. He wanted to shout from the rooftops that he and Draco were
Draco started to put his clothes on too, his eyes fixed on Harry the whole time.
"I do know how it is," Draco said, honestly, and he felt a little sad.
It felt like a revelation to be as close as they both lay, and Harry knew he was privileged to see Draco like this. He swore internally never to hurt him, or cause him the anguish his family had. He wanted to be the alpha Draco deserved.
Squeezing Draco’s hand once more, they moved slowly up the stairs. Every so often, Harry would pull his loved one to him, kissing his hair or finding his lips.
In the deepest of his heart, he was still sad and broken for his family. He didn't think he'd ever stop feeling sad for them. But he had Harry now. He had Harry
Unable to resist, Harry kissed Draco, the rose tint of the cleaning spell still scenting the air.
He came, and came, and came, mumbling nonsense about bonds and knots, before his body fell limp over Harry's, their sticky bodies touching each other. Inside Draco's thighs was slick, wet from his pleasure, and he was sure the slick fell onto his sheets. He couldn't care less as long as he stayed inside Harry's arms forever.
“Let’s be honest, you didn’t marry me for my tact and small talk... And I meant what I said, you still look gorgeous. Honestly. If there’s a few more inches of you, then that’s just more to love.”
He was completely hard and wet, his cunt contracting with desire. His body was hot and he needed to be fucked
They arranged his things on Pansy's small car the best they could, and she drove him to Harry's house. She helped him unpack and leave his things at the front door, but decided to wait on her car, hugging him one last time.
Still, if it made Draco happy, then it was absolutely fine with him. His wife and daughter were the most important people in his world, and anything that made them smile was wonderful.
Harry bit his lip. He was far too alpha to get upset in front of his omega but he knew implicitly that Draco knew how he was feeling. He squeezed Draco’s thigh, and sighed.
“I’ll send a Patronus to your mother if you want, Draco, and tell her our fabulous news? The Healer is certainly talking a while to bring our baby back!”
"I'd love to go out with you... Breathe some cool air. Just... Make me forget my stupid family."
"Sometimes I think you imagine my parents to be doting and caring of me. That they would look at me and say 'okay, Draco, it's your choice and I'm going to respect it'.  It isn't about wanting or not, Harry. It isn't about choosing. I
“Oh look,” he sneered to Creevey, another alpha who worked at the firm. “It’s Potter. Looks like him and Draco have had a lover’s tiff, that’ll be the reason the prissy omega is so pissed off. What’s the problem, Draco too sore after taking your knot too many times?”
. He grabbed on Harry's shoulder, kissing him hard so it would stop him from moaning and coming, coming, and coming.
Harry kissed a delicate line down the side of Draco’s face, dismayed at his red eyes and the thin bloodshot veins that showed his exhaustion. “Let’s go and lay down, love. I think you need to try and sleep... I’m frightened you’re going to collapse.”
He paid the bill, and they took a taxi together back to Harry’s house. Lyra was shaky and sad, and he wrapped a blanket all around her. “You know,” Harry said, “it’s okay to feel sad. I do as well. One day I hope that Draco wants to come here and live with me, but we have to let him make up his own mind. You can’t force people.”
“Well, you’re stuck with me I’m afraid,” laughed Harry. “You’ll have to share her with me forever... and don’t even get me started on boyfriends, or leaving for Hogwarts... Eleven years suddenly doesn’t feel like nearly enough time.”
certain foods. The process was slow, and although she was healed from birth-giving, every time she looked at the mirror thinking 'it could be better', or 'maybe just a little more'. Her breasts were still too sensitive for heavy exercise, but she could see her changes happening before her eyes.
we'll talk about our meeting. What do you think?"
would a baby be? Harry thought sadly that it probably wouldn’t happen again for him, however much he’d love a family and hurried along with his reports.
"H-aaaarry...!"
chats.
"I think we were reckless, Harry. We should go back to work now. I'll meet you at my house after work, okay?" Draco said, unable to turn off the worries. What if someone had seen them? "It's too risky right now."
“I don’t see why not,” Harry nodded. “Once you’d gotten yourself the premises and regular contributors, then you can pay yourself a wage.” Harry replied. “I don’t know. I wouldn’t presume I’d ever earn a fortune, and certainly I wouldn’t make the kind of money I do now... But I think it’d be worth it. To really be able to help those who need it.”
Harry sipped his wine, enjoying how relaxed the conversation was.
Draco send it, already receiving many papers to sign and read. His secretary, an omega called Pansy, was wearing a mini-mini-skirt dress again that day, but Draco didn't say anything. He knew she was desperate for a mate. He just hoped Harry didn't look at her and gave up on their agreement.
Harry thought this wonderfully filthy tongued Draco was quite the biggest turn on he had ever seen. Harry was ready to break Draco in, to fill him so deeply with spunk that he’d feel it even after he’d showered.
was the sweetest release.
“Let's go to sleep, please. It will go away as soon as I close my eyes.”
“Going to show you your place, your place underneath my thighs, omega. I’m going to make you mine, and make you beg for respite. I’m not going to let up all weekend.”
That morning, Draco was feeling weird. He was excited to see Harry, but also a bit nervous. Things were a little frail when they left the night before, but Draco felt on the clouds. He experienced marvellous things the day before, and he felt, somehow, more grown up because of that. He put on black leather trousers, tight on his body and a black jumper over his regular black bra. He foregone a blazer today, but he put on his best black heels.
Two months after, she was still soft around the edges, but less worried about her overall appearance. She wasn't binding herself anymore, even though her stomach was still too soft for her liking. It seemed like the pregnancy fat was grabbing onto her for dear life, even if most of them were gone.
. He released his legs and embraced Harry's waist with them, pulling him closer, faster. He felt his cock impale him and screamed in pleasure, his skin sensitive, tears of pleasure falling down his eyes, his nipples hard and sensitive.
Harry could tell Draco was terribly upset; could tell that this was a bigger issue than he’d ever thought for his lover. He thought for a moment. He wasn’t a great man of words, but he wanted to say the right thing.
That was the moment when the ice creams arrived, and Harry felt quite relieved. He loved his daughter immensely, but sometimes she did speak a little without thinking about the words leaving her mouth.
“I agree. I can't wait to have you completely to me. But I need to go!”
He was so worried that the changes to her body that pregnancy had brought would send her back into the dark place she’d been in before; that she was ashamed of her body and didn’t want to sleep with him as a result.
He wanted to make sure he got to Draco and Jasmine as soon as he could.
And Harry couldn’t help but be encouraged by Draco wanting to explore her gender identity. Harry loved the bright tendrils of confidence that Draco was starting to show, how she was really trying to live her best life...
Pansy looked at Harry, his smell almost punching her in the face. It was a bit much strong for her tastes, but it was obviously to Draco's, because the omega had instructed her to only let Potter pass through her and no one else.
Harry was saved from replying, for Draco had arrived.
Pulling off the nipple, Harry moved his hands southwards. He found the tiny, hard little bulge, and softly started to stroke his fingers over it, enjoying the pressure of it between each of his fingers. Despite himself, Harry started to feel excited once more...
Olivia Moretti was a petit omega, even smaller than Draco. She had her hair up in a serious bun, her neck hidden by a high neck shirt. She always looked at Draco with admiration, and Draco envied her for having a husband and a baby.
It was a few weeks later. They have gotten their dog – which Draco has immediately started to call ‘Monster’, although the puppy was no bigger than Jasmine’s leg. Monster was adorable, always jumping from one side to another, trying to pull on Jasmine’s dress skirts and sleep on Draco’s arms. Although Draco always said that this dog was still too small to protect them from anything, he was growing increasingly fast, and soon he was big enough for a little more exercise.
"Hnn... Harry! It feels... It feels... It feels weird, but so good... I can feel you inside me... Can you please move? Move inside me, alpha..."
The water was so relaxing that he almost found himself dropping off. Stirring himself, Harry climbed out of the bath, drying himself off as he walked. He was warm and stated, the intensity of him orgasms still vibrating through his core, the buzz of pleasure still present in his body.
Draco raised her head, licking her lips and swallowing the food in her mouth. Harry’s words passed through his… her… head. Confusion arrived again, and Draco licked her lips.
Harry pulled his hand away from Draco’s chin and gesticulated to a spot near his waist.
“I wish I could stay here with you forever... But if I stay, I know I won't be able to resist your charms and you'll have an already used husband on your bed.”
Harry stilled when Draco shifted himself, snapping at him to stop. He didn’t really know why the mood had changed but he wasn’t going to push it. He felt frustrated, but understood that Draco was genuinely anxious about something. Harry knew he’d tell him when he was good and ready, but that didn’t stop the annoyance he felt in the moment.
"I don't think my smell has changed. He... He asked me why did I smell like I was... You know?  Aroused. He didn't finish the question, though, I didn't let him. That is too intimate of a question to ask your boss, isn't it?"
“Thank you...”
Draco looked tired, and perhaps a little concerned. Of course, Harry thought with love, she was only just awakening after a long and exhausting sleep. And she’d only just had a baby, of course she’d be tired.
Humming alongside the radio, Harry prepared Draco’s favourite breakfast; the toast and honey she couldn’t seem to get enough of. A cup of his favourite Earl Grey completed the tray and he went upstairs to rouse sleeping beauty.
“We should get going! Wood is the only one who knows how to enter the city,” one guy from the team said, and started walking. They followed them into the middle of nowhere.
“You can’t mix those two plants together! What are you thinking? Is your goal to have the recipient torn limb from limb? Who are you? What do you do, and what are you planning? Is this an assassination attempt?” Draco yelled into the phone dramatically, his words echoing his shock and worry as he spoke.
Harry was surprised how much he wanted this, the fifteen minutes feeling like fifty when he wasn’t sure if Draco was coming.
“Fuck! Aaah~~~ Harry! H-aaa~rry!”
This wasn’t what Harry had wanted, he hadn’t thought he’d have to see his wife broken and sobbing on what was supposed to be the happiest day of her life.
The worst of it was Nott, around him like a bloody hawk, asking where his body guard was. He was turning into a very annoying presence in Draco's life, and he'd rather not talk to him at all. With this, Draco decided to spend the whole week inside his office, asking Pansy to get his food for him.
Pushing forward, Harry bit his lip. Tight to the point of near discomfort, Draco’s arse was searing hot, sucking up his cock like a vice. He could feel sweat beading on his forehead, feel his chest getting tight as he inched slowly onwards.
Harry felt a little bit sorry that Jasmine had been cursed with his hair; of course, he liked it, (and Draco never seemed to be able to keep her hands out of it) but it felt wrong to force his uncontrollable mop onto a small baby.
To the sound of Harry's warning, Draco licked the underside of his cock once again, opening his eyes and speaking, his mouth touching Harry's cock head. His hand was resting on Harry's knot, his thumb caressing the underside of it. It was so big... Draco couldn't imagine how delicious it could be to be stretched so wide... Too bad he'd probably not feel it for many years to come.
Draco’s fingers on his legs felt shivery and delicious. Just being this close to his husband was doing wonderful things to his cock. It sat, a hard line against his Draco’s arse. He was too exhausted for another round, but just the contact was sexy.
