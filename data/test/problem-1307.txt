Nicolas seemed to age before his eyes, the man taking a moment to mutter something in French before standing once again to walk across the room and take the stone out of its confines. Harry watched him as he came closer until they were standing a few feet apart, and the old man then placed the stone onto the table right where the sun was streaming through the adjacent window. Sunlight struck the red stone instantly, and in a burst of color the entire workshop was awash with red light. Harry looked down at his arms and body curiously, his hands and clothes bleached out in red due to the overwhelming crimson color. It felt… itchy.
Xenophilius nodded to himself, puttering around the small living space as he muttered on. “Yes, oh yes. You’re the favorite, of that there is no doubt. She had told me-whispered it in my dreams on the day you awakened. Now, I’m not as gifted as my daughter, but I am much older and can hear Her very well. Yes oh yes…”
“Don’t call me that name, Locket.” He hissed, gripping it by the chin as it continued to murmur his words repeatedly. “I am not, nor have I ever been, Voldemort.”
Luna had reached the bottom of the steps, and entered the room cautiously just as he finished. Xenophilius sat back in his chair as she did, a troubled look on his face as his eyes immediately began to lose the sharpness in them. Luna didn’t seem to have seen him initially, but as she turned to look from her father’s troubled features she caught sight of him and grinned broadly. He smiled at her gently as her grin only widened and she skipped around the clutter and furniture to hug him tightly around the middle.
He took another deep breath of air as his eyes finally settled onto the soulbond, the rosary, and his heartbeat began to slow. It was still there, right as rain. Harry was okay. Draco sighed through his nose, before leaning back onto his headboard and examining the bond as carefully as he could. Harry was alive, that much was clear, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t something wrong. If he paid enough attention to it, he might be able to figure out what was wrong.
“I know you want to talk about it,” he whispered, Draco’s heartbeat racing through his finger and along the nerves of his arm.
“Out of the frying pan, into the fire.” He muttered, sliding down to his knees and groaning as a nigh-unbearable headache started creeping around his skull. Why, out of everything that could have happened on Harry’s birthday, why had
Draco immediately sat back down again, looking entirely put out. Harry stared at the two women's retreating backs, confused.
more than just an argument. Theo was unsure of if he would ever be able to look at Harry in a way that wasn’t tainted by disgust. He was positive, however, that he wouldn’t manage to keep the negative thoughts at bay the next time they saw each other.
“Don’t lie to me. The emotional connection between soulmates is something that just can't be replicated-!”
Comprehension in itself seemed a far distant memory in fact, and before he could even react to the pain in his arm he was thrown forward and out flat onto his back, the starry sky rising high above him as he sucked in a deep breath of fresh air. He choked back a pained hiss as splinters of agony raced up and down his dislocated arm, rippling out as his nerves reacted painfully to the injury. If he hadn’t been subjected to the imperious for a decade, if he hadn’t grown well adjusted to the cruciatus curse well before that, he surely would have passed out from the pain. He grunted, forcing himself to breathe a calming breath of evening air, forcibly slowing his heart rate as he stared up into the night sky.
Draco stared through his window while he sat. The sun was slowly rising—chasing the night away. His chest still felt tight, his breaths came slow. Harry loves to watch the sunrise. It made him feel hopeful through a new day. Draco hoped he could watch it wherever he was now. He also hoped Harry would come back from wherever he went—it's been a year. It wasn't funny anymore.
because ever since Pansy and Harry entered the Hall, Draco's been glaring at them and downing one after the other.
Hermione and Harry jerked at it, and Harry hastily tucked the device away behind his robe once more.
"You'll never quit asking will you?" Draco chuckled, though it was bitter, empty. He couldn't fathom accepting, yet a part of him wanted to oh so badly. If just to
"Float him into bed." Harry instructed, thinking over what exactly to do now. All he knew was that Draco just went through an electric jolt, and he had no clue how to deal with that.
Such a risk however, well, Draco couldn't take that matter lightly. What of his family's legacy? What of everything he'd achieved thus far? Surely he couldn't let it all be rendered obsolete by indulging in such endeavors as Harry often did.
Harry just hoped Draco would get over it pretty quickly and start talking to Harry again though. Because—they were friends now, weren't they? Harry thought so at least. He was happy with that notion, regardless of his feelings. Being friends was probably the best he would get, so he'd have to deal.
Draco held completely still, counting to ten in his head forwards and backwards, thought of Umbridge's ugly mug and tensed his hips, to stop from coming immediately, from moving too soon, no matter how deeply his body wanted him to just
"I don't want to think about any of the Weasleys dying." Harry shuddered—tasted bile in his mouth when Fred's face flashed through his mind. "Any of them would devastate me." Harry shook his head to rid it of such dark thoughts.
"How long was I out anyways?" Harry's brows furrowed. He expected perhaps a day or so, given the way things were.
Sweet Merlin and Christ, Harry just couldn't ever catch a break, could he? Much as he didn't really want to do this at all, he couldn't let Malfoy be thrown back in Azkaban either. He couldn't if he ever wanted to sleep again that was.
Harry swallowed a heavy lump and turned back towards the desk, futilely hoping this was all a bad dream. It was bad enough that he'd practically been bullied into accepting this, it was so much worse for Malfoy to be there to watch the deal go into effect.
After toiling the year away and managing his escape, he was finally back where he was supposed to be, surrounded by people he loved and who loved him and it meant the world to him. After he'd returned and bore a week long integration back into everything that had been going on in his absence, he was reacquainted with all once more and felt more ready than ever to continue living free and in peace.
"The hostage and the explosion were diversions—so they could take me. It took me a year to escape, but now I'm back Draco, I didn't die." He explained, voice so quiet he nearly whispered his words.
"...Did it scar?" Harry asked, even though he doesn't want to know. Not really. He doesn't want to know the price Malfoy had paid for Harry's idiocy.
"He demanded to see who was picked to monitor him." The Auror explained. "Became exceedingly annoying and bratty, so I dragged him here. Apologies for the interruption, sir."
Ron almost couldn't believe two people could need each other this much, but he was seeing it right here right now, and if he had planned on giving up earlier, this was all it took to convince him otherwise.
"For what?" Potter turned to her with a furrowed brow, looked completely and genuinely baffled to hear that, he had no idea what she'd have to apologize for.
Which then in turn gave Harry the unwelcome realization that his own constant boner was probably poking Draco somewhere too.
"Got what?" He replied, almost as an afterthought—like he hadn't been paying attention and had only then realized Harry had spoken.
Draco looked down at the kid, who looked so painfully hopeful, his eyes wide and pleading, and he knew he was doomed. Utterly fucking
Harry grabbed at his magic canceler, hovering his thumb over the silver thumb, waiting, his heart beating behind his chest.
"Kreacher believes there is a book somewhere. Kreacher will see if he can get it for the Masters." He disappeared.
Harry was just about to give her the signal (a rather violent cough) to put their plan into action when her turn next came, when Hermione, out of sheer ignorance, managed to halt their entire hatched plot in it's roots:
He turned and blinked owlishly at her for a moment—the hell did Draco see in this guy Pansy will never know, but she digressed.
Harry frowned. What was Malfoy apologizing for? The whole point of the situation they were in now was that his magic was unstable, not exactly anything he had any control over.
Draco straightened up when it suddenly hit him after brainstorming for a minute. "You should light all the hearths!"
Then the idea that Harry was alive now but could very well be possibly dying as a result of whatever had injured him so badly to cause him to scream so filtered past the panic and fear and Draco flung himself towards the fireplace to call McGonagall, because he absolutely fucking
Harry gasped over Draco's skin, and pressed down, his fingers reverent as he continued undressing Draco.
"No owl would survive flying from Europe to Australia, Ron, and besides, I didn't exactly know where you guys were. And it's really not a big deal. Draco's changed, he's a much better person now, so it's not as if there were issues."
Harry almost fainted—to hear it said so blatantly. As he watched Draco's parents for their reactions, Lucius seemed confused while Narcissa's gaze dropped to their clasped hands.
As he drifted off in search of Draco Malfoy, he vaguely acknowledged the boy might have had a point—
They ate and talked in quiet, loving murmurs all throughout but as they finished dessert, Harry's stomach tied in knots as a dark fear flitted through his mind upon Draco seeing Harry's present, but he cast it away. This was too important to be tainted with such grim thoughts.
He'd caved eventually, he felt bad refusing his friends anything, something Pansy was thankful to Gryffindor for hammering into all of its children.
Instead she followed Draco's gaze to where Harry was flying over the pitch and doing drills with the rest of the team.
Ron's eyebrows furrowed as he looked away from Harry and peered at Draco with narrowed eyes, much resembling Harry when he loses his glasses.
I'd ask my boy out, even if he does hex me seven ways to Sunday, I suppose if I'm to die it won't matter."
Harry swallowed and let himself think about it. That stood against everything that Harry believed in—but Draco was forced to get it. And—how could Harry hate Draco over things he hadn't had any choice in? How could he hate Draco at all?
"D-Done what? What plan—?" Hermione stammered, completely caught off guard by these accusations of ruining something apparently important.
She surely wouldn't refuse them? When Harry had informed McGonagall about the magic canceler he had, much to his own mortification, admitted to the bond as well, because he'd known they'd have to leave Hogwarts grounds for a while when time came to break the bond and he was aware that McGonagall would have to be informed if they had any hopes of getting approved.
"Draco what the fuck happened to you?" The ginger hissed and stepped in, dropping into a crouch next to the blonde.
He cut off mid splutter, and stared down at their hands, then looked at Hermione, who was all but glowing, her eyes beaming at him.
Harry collapsed against the door behind him, reality crashing through the pop in his ears while Draco pressed a hand over his mouth and buried his other in his own hair and tugged, pacing the width of the classroom.
"Really Weasley?" Draco snicked with a wolfish grin, he couldn't help himself. He twitched his brow in Granger's direction and Ron just gave him a dark glare:
Draco woke up slowly—blinked the images from his eyes whilst he stared at his ceiling. His chest felt constricted, as if a weight lay upon it. He'd been having the same dream for a year now, it was always the same punishment on repeat.
Harry reached up on his tip toes, his fingers brushing the clasp protruding from the nook in the drywall. He gripped it best he could and yanked lower, bringing a trap door down with a rain of dust and debris. Goodness that place up there hadn't been used in years now. A ladder slid out from resting against the trapdoor and clanked to the floor. Harry had to take a moment to wipe his glasses, before he could see again. Once he adjusted the ladder, the raven made his way up into the attic, pulling his wand to send a Lumos up there.
Hermione cast a non-verbal Protego around him—just in case. She did that often when they were out and about for too long and if he noticed, he never said anything about it.
On the apocalyptic day of the study-date, Pansy and Hermione made sure to arrive before the boys, and sat next to each other, purposefully leaving two seats empty opposite them.
a way to get Harry out, by the time they'd discover it and study it, it would be too late anyways. Draco was certain at least several hours he'd already spent here, and Kreacher had allotted him a day, so there wasn't really all that much time left.
"Good, that's good, now if you can wake up for me that'd be lovely—" Harry subconsciously rubbed Malfoy's back in an awkward attempt to soothe him.
As he went through the motions of finally getting a proper shower, getting a set of normal clothes to change out of the prisoner robes into and having his release form and paperwork signed by his warden, Draco felt hazy.
Ron made for the Fireplace. Usually, the DMLE kept the Floo locked and warded, but the Aurors were keyed into the wards. He did his best to imitate Malfoy's poncy accent as he answered:
"There was a report about disturbances and noise coming from this residence. We are here to investigate. Can we come in?"
Harry's hips bore down, he whined like a bitch in heat as Draco slowly pumped the finger past the initial ring of muscles.
He thought of his life thus far, what he'd made of himself and the man he yet wanted to become. He thought of how to do that.
"He means that in the name of professionalism and respect, we do not openly discuss that with anyone but the couple themselves. If the couple wants to discuss it with you, Mr.Malfoy, then they will do that."
Harry chuckled and lightly kissed the tip of Draco's nose, resumed canting his hips and slowly making love to Draco, his hands carefully swooping Draco's messy hair out of his face.
It was a fair point. Harry spent most of Potion lessons when he worked with Malfoy incessantly staring at him and fantasizing.
He then turned away, also refusing to acknowledge the prick of tears. He stared down into the white floor just as a black slit came across a circlelike space, then opened.
"Gotcha. Whew, you're heavy. Might wanna ease off Molly's cooking for a bit there." Harry chuckled, heart palpitating in his chest.
"Mate! Malfoy's gotten into a fight! I think his magic is going to shit—one window already exploded and nearly cut us all to ribbons—you have to come, right now!" Ron yelled between gasps, already pulling Harry into a run behind him.
Granger and Weasley stopped their incessant questioning then, also seemingly realizing that Harry was, in fact, not with Draco.
"You're wrong either way." Malfoy informed him, and that seemed to be the final note of that conversation, as Malfoy smoothly kept talking:
After a silent minute, during which Harry never stopped murmuring softly under his breath, nothing in particular, just Potion ingredients, just something to keep Malfoy's mind trained on him and engaged, he began moving closer again, noting that Malfoy didn't flinch. That was a good sign, a very good sign.
and tired of everyone avoiding everyone because some snake lunatic stirred up a war that swept us all up into it." Pansy declared and stood akimbo, glaring at each and every returning eighth year in turn, which was barely a handful. "Especially you two, Draco, Harry." She called out briskly.
"Since the wards are thinnest there, we have the best chance of peeling them away without disturbing the inlaid detection charms if we're careful. Any way in from the southern side, Malfoy?" He turned to Draco, eyes blazing.
Harry had expected he'd go into overdrive if he was ever to hear those words, but he felt so blank right now. He supposed it was because he'd made such peace with the assumption Draco wouldn't harbor any similar feelings that now that he learned differently, he just didn't know what to think, how to react. His head had never woven any similar hypothetical scenario that might inform him now what he was supposed to behave like.
"I won't hurt you." Harry promised, and to prove it, he slowly drew his wand, no intent in his movements. Malfoy flinched anyways but Harry only knelt down and placed his wand on the ground before Malfoy's feet.
ourselves and play a game together." Pansy Parkinson had snapped one evening in the joint common room in their 8th year.
"Wait, wait, what are you on about?" Draco stared at them. As far as he knew nothing much happened in second year. Well, okay, there was the whole
Harry still chuckled quietly when he caught Draco crying over his horniness sometimes, even though Harry often felt like joining in.
Harry had never experienced that before. Usually Veelas were glad to be left alone for a while after Harry calmed them down, exhausted after the harrowing experience. Never before had one looked as terrified of Harry leaving as Malfoy appeared to be.
As he was thinking this, Draco returned home. It was night already and Ron had stayed up waiting for him, though he just
Draco had no clue what happened or caused Harry so much pain, because after he broke the signet, all he felt was a cold trickle of relief, an unspooling of months long tension, as the lust bond was finally broken. He had no clue where Harry was now and whether or not he was hurt and it was safe to say he was losing his shit.
"They were so relieved. They said they always felt as though something was blurry and missing." Hermione explained, her shoulders drooping with relief at having her parents back. Harry was so happy for her.
idea where he might be keeping Narcissa and Lucius. Security must be heightened since you got out, we have no chance of getting them out."
It was a good thing too though, since Draco feared he would spontaneously combust if they didn't proceed
Potter rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses and winced when he pressed into the welt too hard, before directing the question at Draco.
"For the record, I know you just spent the past 5 minutes hanging about my front door probably trying to decide exactly how detrimental this will be." Potter said by way of welcome.
Everything was incredibly dusty and full of cobwebs, but after Harry swept some strong cleansing charms through the space, all the grime sizzled away. While he was on the hunt for Horcruxes, there was little opportunity to shower, so learning some potent deep cleaning charms was utmost necessary.
Harry's eyes stung from the brightness of the space around him. He looked down at himself, then all around himself and saw—absolutely nothing but white.
made Harry feel as though he was having an orgasm without ever actually experiencing it as opposed to just the typical shortness of breath from
defend your mother if someone came up to me insulting her, I'm mad that you let it get so far out of your control that you ended up shattering a window and now you can barely stand." As he spoke Harry came closer and put his hands on Draco's shoulders to push him to sit down on Harry's bed. "And I'm mad that you wanted me to let you keep going, despite what we agreed upon."
Pansy arched an eyebrow at the gesture, and all Hermione could offer was a shrug, however Pansy seemed pleased nonetheless.
to go with Potter—and she knew he wouldn't ask. He'd psych himself up to ask, but he'd lose his nerve then justify it with a million excuses.
spending this entire party pining in a corner." Hermione snapped and passed off the butterbeer to a charmed floating platter. She grabbed his arm and dragged him onto the dance floor, despite his continuous protests. If they had to do this the hard way, then they would, but she wouldn't let the night end until they both saw just how much they meant to each other.
"Nothing, darling." Pansy smiled sweetly and Hermione just nodded innocently and patted the seat next to hers.
"Focus on my voice." Harry prompted, because he needed to first ground Malfoy before he attempted to approach and console him with physical touch. People tended to think of Veelas as cruel, birdlike wretches, but they were possibly the most sensitive and gentle magical creatures out there, only beaten by unicorns, so a friendly touch went a long way in calming one down.
There was no time to ponder that though as they all stepped in, Lucius closing the tunnel up behind them. They were bathed in darkness until Ron cast a Lumos and fell into step besides Draco.
The blonde shifted in his seat and fidgeted with his quill on the desk. He blinked rapidly a few times before meeting Harry's eyes:
The light was living—it breathed around him, swelled like waves past his skin, an inexorable force that existed in infinite stretches around the raven.
However, Harry apparently really didn't know better, but he trusted Ron and Hermione's judgment. They were convinced Draco felt the same. So, this could very well have been some sort of flirting. In that case, he wanted to see how far he could push it and what kind of reception he'd get out of the blonde.
The first year he'd floated through, barely even felt any of it. He was still hurting from losing Harry and there were times he was almost glad for his cell. It was as cold and hostile on the outside as he felt on the inside.
"What? How is that possible? Malfoy's been hovering around you like a lost puppy all this time—We thought something was up."
They murmured something, and the shackles released, Harry toppling down like a ragdoll. Draco lurched forwards and managed to catch him somewhat awkwardly before he crashed to the floor.
"I figure I owe you an apology." She cleared her throat—refused to be ashamed. She was an adult now, she could own up to her mistakes.
, but it wasn't his place or his business. All he could do was try to help things along, even though that has failed miserably so far, since they were both so fucking
Just so, Harry leaned forwards, closer, tilted his head, eyes transfixed on Draco's lips, flickering up to his eyes as they came only inches apart. Draco's eyes were wide and soft, his lips trembling.
Draco opened his mouth, then closed it, having no argument to brook in return. It didn't sit right with him to just insert himself into this family's lives, but Ron did have a fair point too.
He listened carefully, stiffening slightly as he heard the distinct sound of voices-screaming, coming from far away. The other two didn’t make any indication to have heard it, but Harry knew that he had. Something was happening. Something bad.
“This is getting me nowhere.” He muttered, trying to force the noises out of his immediate attention as he turned once again to the door. It was a simple enough fix, if he wanted to put the door back to the way it was, but that amount of security didn’t seem effective anymore.
“I wouldn’t bet on it. But, please, if you would just… just hear me out, I would appreciate it. And if you don’t want me here once I’m done speaking, then I’ll leave. But please, just let me say everything I have to.”
He turned in that empty space, and observed the tall oak door behind him, before gripping the handle and stepping back into his mindscape. For a moment, he observed the infinite changes, as well as the alterations to his own peace of mind, before letting out a long breath of air. Remember. He remembered so much now. Or, if he was going to be true to himself and the new consciousness that he had found himself in, he had always known, and was now revealing that knowledge to the rest of himself.
“When do I tell him then, if you’re so smart.” He whispered, eyes still closed and anger falling by the second as it was replaced by a familiar, bitter, and cold impassiveness. It felt like a wall of ice surrounding him, locking him inside of himself. Was he always like this without Draco? The heat felt so natural with his soulmate within spitting distance, and anger followed quickly after that. Was this balance, or just more extremes?
But… despite his battle with morality, he missed his friend. He missed Harry, and his quiet, amused expressions. He missed Draco and his… less quiet ones. He missed being forcibly corralled around by Draco without a second thought, pulled along to activities with such fervor that he could be comfortable pretending that he didn’t want to go. He missed how Harry understood him so effortlessly, how they understood
Draco bit his lip, leaning to the side and resting his head on the back of the couch. “It's not quite like that, though it felt that way at times. Honestly, I don’t know what’s going on either. It feels like they both found out about something bad, but I can't imagine what it might be and neither of them will even look me in the eye, much less tell me what they’ve been up to. Hell, father wants you to write to him apparently, whatever reason that is for.”
Hello! As I'm sure a few of you might know, I have figured out a workable schedule for uploads while I am still in school! Mondays and Wednesdays are my easy days, where I basically just have a bunch of electives (extra curriculars like art class and weight lifting) so I can take much more time writing on both those days and the weekends. Tuesdays and Thursdays, however, are VERY busy for me, so those will be the days that I update my two fics. Earthly Heavens will update on Tuesday (since the chapters for it are usually much longer so I need the weekend to write them) and Creature of Winter will update on Thursdays.
Daphne rolled her eyes, not nearly as bothered by the jab as Blaise was. “Oh don’t be so full of yourself, Malfoy, I was just surprised by how much Harry has… grown.”
“What’s your name, dear? You must have been very frightened of the chaos to have risked side-along portkeying.” The woman asked idly, forcing small talk into what he was certain must be a very bizarre situation for her. He stayed silent at first, merely watching as she moved up from his hand to his elbow, setting it back into place with a single, sharp movement.
Harry stared into those silver eyes, wide with a panic that he could feel in every unbelievable, improbable way.
Theo felt like she was trying to confuse him on purpose, saying things that made even less sense than usual. He also felt like he had gotten pretty good at telling when she was trying to be confusing and when she was just saying confusing things, as most of the time her confusing-if-important moments tended to actually relate to the conversation, while other times she just spoke nonsense for the sake of it.
The towering doors of the entrance opened for him with familiarity, welcoming him back, and Nicolas was greeted by a familiar entrance hall as he stepped inside, the elaborate and lavish decor beckoning him further inwards. For once, he didn’t feel as inclined to smile and enjoy the architecture as he usually was, his mind far more focused on the task at hand as he turned towards the nearest spiral stairway and started to climb up to the fourth floor, where Olympe’s office was located. He passed nothing but portraiture during his climb, the eerie stillness doing well to remind him that it was indeed summertime and the children were home.
He didn’t know much about the immortal man’s sleep schedule, but had a feeling that he wasn’t one for waking up early, considering how late they were up the night prior. It had been a good evening all things considered, as they stayed up for quite a long time discussing the more pleasant parts of his third year while eating over some sort of scandinavian dish that Perenelle was fond of, but he couldn’t even attempt to pronounce the name of. Though, now that he thought about it, he had admittedly not given much of an effort towards it anyway. Perhaps it was the fact that the two had seen no issue in giving him wine that night, and he had likely gotten a tad tipsy.
“Yes… yes, hello! To all our students returning today, welcome back! And if today is your first day at Hogwarts… well, welcome to you as well!”
He dodged her arm as she reached out to whack him, moving swiftly along as her affronted gasp met his ears. He laughed, feeling the last of his concern wash away as she reached up and, standing on the tips of her toes, pinched his cheek tightly, muttering something indistinct in what sounded like Russian, or maybe it was just nonsense. She did seem to enjoy speaking nonsense on occasion.
As his excitement skyrocketed to heights that Barty hadn’t felt in over a decade, his body started to eat a stale slice of toast.
“... It’s a little funny,” Harry muttered, still looking like he was fighting to keep the laughter down. Draco shook his head one final time, fighting down his own smile as it threatened to eke out around his lips. Harry grinned mischievously, leaning down into his personal space and making a point to be particularly
Barty froze, steadying himself as the voices all around him once again dimmed, and his eyes zeroed in on a tall, imposing figure. Black hair, white shirt, tall and lithe stature. Dominant and forceful. Restrained danger held taught within a thin casing of flesh. A couple of people followed behind the man, their faces unfocused and blurry in his peripherals as Barty stared at the imposing figure slowly walking away from him.
He thought idly, turning slightly to look at the retreating form of the skinny, dour man. He had known Viktor as a polite but distant acquaintance in his last life, but if Lucius Malfoy’s letter had any basis in reality, it would be good to know a famous person from a relatively distant country. Just like France, Harry doubted that Marvolo or Voldemort or whatever he was going by now would want to bother with anyone if they fled to the cold far north of Europe, unless it was Harry himself.
They had also come to learn that the esteemed and highly regarded Lord Lucius Malfoy was extremely adept in cleaning charms, though when asked how they knew this none would quite be able to answer.
That thought he kept being stuck on as well, feeling in his bones that this had been an indirect attack on his reputation and not a direct one onto the Weasley girl itself. After all, how could the girl have gained an enemy so driven to not only want to kill her, but to actually go to the effort to do it? The child was only twelve! No, it was clear that this was an indirect attack on him, which only led to more questions of who could have orchestrated it. Why had the attack been on the girl? Did the attacker wish to divide him from the Weasley family? And for what purpose? It just didn’t make any
He barely had a moment to be surprised as Harry reached them, his eyes immediately pinned onto the stone as Prenelle spoke. The tall boy reached towards it immediately, eyes filled with obvious fascination as he turned it over in his hands, dragging Draco and Perenelle’s arms up to his head as they both continued to hold onto the chain.
He watched the prototype of the philosopher’s stone shine unnaturally, realizing exactly what was going on as they walked deeper and deeper into the woods. It seemed that she had him promise not to worry the day before for a reason. She had already come up with a way to avoid any potential trouble after the game, even if she had stated that they should just wing it.
mess to clean up.” He bit back, eyes disobediently leaving the wall and skating over towards the inconspicuous iron door to his left. Harry glared at the thrice-damned thing, not caring in the slightest that the man hidden behind said door might very well be able to hear him and his perceivably one-sided conversation.
The book clattered against the wall as Blaise whooped, jumping from his seat to dodge it. He fell into a half-crouch, eyes widening with undisguisable glee and grin growing by the second as he blinked slowly at Draco’s loud proclamation. The blond’s eyes widened in horror, his mouth opening in an attempt to explain himself that would surely fall on deaf ears. Daphne couldn't help but let out a quiet burst of laughter.
“I can hardly be faulted for not paying attention.” He muttered back, earning a little laugh for his troubles. She left it be though, seemingly, as she turned his attention back to Harry.
“Bloody… fuck you, Potter.” He muttered, pushing the hand away as he blearily looked up from his knees, nausea slowly dissipating. “How are you not… hurling up your guts right now.”
Shocking him, the man nodded along, shaking Harry’s hand firmly before pinning his eyes on Draco. “A pleasure to meet you, Harry and Draco. As you know, my name is Viktor Krum, yes.”
into that familiar embrace. The cold overtook him, chilling and familiar and oh so wonderfully needed. He had forgotten what it was like to feel cold, had somehow forgotten that he was ever-burning. Harry muttered something indescribable, an ‘I missed you’ most likely. Draco muttered an agreement, not paying any attention to words when feeling was that much more potent. Harry’s arms were fast against his back, pressing just hard enough as to not hurt his wings. Harry had gotten larger, somehow, and not only in height. His back muscles felt more defined, as if he had been doing manual labor for hours on end each day. His hug nearly fully enveloped Draco, drowning him in the cold and the green and Harry-all of it was Harry.
She considered it for a moment, humming curiously as she wrote out a name onto the envelope. Theo didn’t bother trying to read it, knowing he was too far away for an effort to be anything but futile.
Draco shook his head, making a point to ignore the still-laughing boy as he reached for his book once more, intent on ignoring the wordless mocking and getting back to his studying.
Theo nodded to himself slowly, his eyes wandering back to the walls as Luna pressed a seal into the slowly cooling wax. “So you want to go?”
Harry fidgeted with his too-long fingers, swiping his thumb over a hangnail that he hadn’t yanked out yet as he watched Draco’s eyes reach the bottom, pause, before skating up to the top again. Was he reading it a second time? His foot tapping got noticeably faster, and Harry couldn’t help but feel the weight of the entire situation bearing down on his shoulders. Was this why Tom hadn’t wanted him to say anything until a better time? No, he would have had a better reason than something as arbitrary as nerves.
If Barty were capable of it, he would have toppled over backwards in his chair. The World Cup! He would be taken outside! There were so many possibilities-so many potential noises and voices to listen to! Adrenalin spiked through his system, the thought of not only leaving the house, but going to somewhere as overpopulated as the World Cup-! It was almost too much to bear. Barty wished he could unfocus his eyes, if only to see if the adrenaline was rushing so quickly through him that his hand was actually shaking. What a wonderful sight that would be! The thought that, even in this tortuous state, he was capable of sometimes breaking through, and wrangling some semblance of control away from his father, even in such a small way as a shaking hand. What an utterly glorious thought!
He thought sluggishly, eyes unfocused as he craned his neck backward, focusing on the intricately carved ceiling above him. Maybe there was some sort of creature inheritance-related thing going on with him. But, technically speaking, he had had his first transformation earlier than his birthday, so maybe it was some other reason that he was feeling so out of sorts.
She stopped dead, breathing erratically as Theo’s form was fully realized by her. Honey, warm and melting, no eyes or green or hair. Luna took a deep breath, slowly calming as she fell away from the nightmare-from the vision.
“How exactly is that the only explanation?” Harry rather thought that there could be a considerably larger amount of explanations to explain any amount of issues Tom may have with his creepy wall of doors, many of them explaining whatever the issue is much better than a horcrux randomly coming upon a body to inhibit.
“Maybe we’re just having two different conversations, honey. Why are you asking me about trusting Harry anyway?” She was hardly going to tell him to stop, but it seemed rather silly after the argument that the two boys had had. Admittedly, she would have been more up for a conversation about it while they were still at Hogwarts and the threat of the two trying to kill each other was still at large, but now that Harry was away in France and Theo was confined to the Rookery, Luna was confident that she could stop any sort of potentially lethal confrontations from happening.
Harry was yanked unceremoniously out of his thoughts by Tom, who dragged him over to the door while muttering worriedly. “If you would stop daydreaming leech, we can get on with fortifying this blasted hole.” He nodded companionably, forcing himself to focus back onto the topic at hand as Tom guided him through the motions of creating a more complex ward that he had only really studied in an intellectual sense.
Her voice started to fade into the background as his mind refused to take it in, all of his attention focused on Harry as the taller boy seemed to sink into his seat with relief, the exhausted and frustrated expression returning to his face the second he thought Draco wasn’t paying attention. Draco was paying attention though, he was paying a nearly painful amount of attention, and as breakfast started to drag on, all he seemed to be able to do was pay attention.
minutes? I’m not letting you out of the damned chains.” He hissed, turning to glare once more at the hideous amalgamation of Voldemort’s paranoia and insanity. Tom sneered at it, hateful and angry at what it represented. He had acute memories of Voldemort making the locket, and none of them were particularly lovely. They certainly explained why the small slip of a soul had turned out the way it had, especially since its physical vessel had been saturated into a potion designed to mentally torture people for the, incredibly pivotal, first few days of its existence, until Regulus Black had gone in and saved it from going even madder.
Harry bit his lip and considered for a moment, but after some particularly ballsy wizard rammed his shoulder into Draco while passing by, Harry had enough.
Draco wanted out of here, but the wards were so thick and heavy that he had no hopes of tearing through them to Apparate. He tugged on the door handle but that proved extremely inefficient, and even then Draco didn't let up. His hackles were rising, reaching for Harry, and he needed to get away immediately—
"Why's Malfoy staring at you like that?" Ron muttered to Harry when he seemed to notice the same thing as Harry did a moment earlier. Harry chuckled:
"Potter—" Draco's voice cracked on the word when he said it, his face crumbling when Harry looked up at him.
However, if Pansy thought she had suffered a struggle with Potter, Hermione had a downright apoplexy getting Draco to go.
Harry laughed brightly, he couldn't help it. Draco seemed so confused by his own feelings and the fact Harry could figure them out for a second there that all Harry could manage was to laugh right alongside him when he realized what he'd just said.
He'd thought something like this might eventually happen, things had been entirely too peaceful for far too long. A full month without
"Harry Potter's life is in grave danger and I need your help to try to save him. You're his best friend, why else do you think I came here?" He repeated slowly, enunciating each word.
The blonde pushed away from the wall and wiped his burning eyes. He was here to keep the place for—Nevermind.
Though even Hermione was doubtful it would be the case here, she remained adorably hopeful that perhaps the boys would manage on their own. Pansy had been more realistic about it, but she indulged Hermione, just because Hermione looked rather fetching when she smiled.
"It's me, I'm back. I'd like to talk to you, I have so many things to explain." Harry said, bringing a hand up to rub at the back of his neck.
"And what do you want me to do Harry? I can't barge into his office to search it, I can't accuse anyone of anything without any proof. Believe me I don't like to see how much shit Malfoy gets either, all my grumbling aside, he's one of the best here, but you know as well as I do everything has to be official."
—snorted at the response but didn't comment further on it. He instead just gazed at Draco fondly, which caused many an organ to twist and knot.
"Are you sure there isn't a way? I think Lucius has put a lot of pressure on Draco for an heir, I wonder if perhaps there might be a way to connect it all the same?"
"Yes, that—would be all. Mr.Malfoy will be staying the remaining of summer break with you Harry." Kingsley informed, rubbing at his neck somewhat awkwardly.
While he worked for the CMC, it was quite a regular occurrence for your co-workers to hex your office so it would smell of hippogriff dung, or curse it so that everything you touch would screech like a Kneazle giving birth for a prank. But of course, those were just harmless pranks, they'd lift the spells after a bit of taking the piss.
"If I've learned anything in the five years I've lived with you, it's that the moment something amazing happens to you, you will not hesitate to squeal the nearest person's ear off. That happens to be me. And I'm even asking for it. So come on, Malfoy, give it your worst."
"Mr.Malfoy. Bond magic is very powerful and delicate. If used improperly, it can be dangerous. I'm sure an heir is not more important than your son's health and well-being."
surely you can forgive her..." Harry murmured against his husband's lips, cupping his cheek and leaning in more. "For me?"
"He slams all the doors and windows when he's upset and angry. He broke a few when he heard you were going to Azkaban." Ron's nose scrunched up regretfully and he rubbed his neck.
to stand up for your family. Need I remind you what had almost happened to me, had my mother not been there? What I'd nearly become? What
"If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone,what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven't you told them yet?"
The doors to the room shut and locked, the wood shimmering. They heard someone bang on them from inside, then scream in pain.
Draco's throat was dry, he didn't want to talk—to explain how he was slowly dying and wanted to let death take him like this, right here, right now.
"Mr.Slytherin, it's an honor to meet you." She nodded with a smile. "To what do we owe a visit?" She appeared curious, hungry to learn.
"It wasn't only me, Mrs.Weasley." Draco pointed out, but she didn't let up, so he sighed and gave up the battle.
Anything could've happened during the course of the night. Perhaps they worked it out, like Hermione was hoping they would. Or maybe they didn't. Maybe Harry hurt Draco when he transformed, though that was the least likely and highly improbable option.
Harry summoned his glasses and stuck them on his nose so his vision would stop pulling at the edges, and glanced down, searching out the source of his immobility.
Hermione wondered if it was possible to get drunk on butterbeer if you consumed a large enough quantity, and just how large that quantity
"You didn't seem to care about the library in seventh year Malfoy, when you Crucio-ed my little sister into paralysis." One of the guys snarled right back, his face white with fury. "She screamed and begged you to stop. Right here, in the
And finally, explained how he couldn't leave Grimmauld because Grimmauld was keeping him alive. And—it doesn't matter Granger, if we find another way, because by then Harry will have already merged completely with Grimmauld and then ripping him out would kill both him and the house itself—once all the words ran out, Draco just sank bonelessly to the floor, exhausted.
Still, Harry wished that once it had finally come to blows, it hadn't happened when he was so far away from Draco, so far away from perhaps calming him down differently without the use of the canceler, so that the secret wouldn't be out that he even had a canceler on Draco.
"Woah—" Harry's huff was lost as Draco tugged him through the halls and into the main room where Lucius and Narcissa were sitting.
They ducked into the shadows as five Death Eaters flew out into the hallway from various rooms to find out what happened. They pulled their wands and made down the hallway, disappearing into a large room just at the end of it.
Potter's wand dropped away as his spell took hold and he closed his eyes and reached out across the faux bond he'd spun between them and searched out Astoria's part through it, feeling around for what the issue was.
"No, of course it isn't any kind of prize. It's my trust, and respect. They're earned. And you've earned them now."
Sam knew Draco as well as he could have gotten to know him in the few months Draco kept him around for sex.
He realized after another second of reorienting himself that he was in a bed. Then as he registered the slant of the ceiling, he realized he was in the attic. And as he slowly turned his head about, he realized Draco was sitting by his bed, dozing thinly in a chair.
want to protect Draco as much as he could, but he didn't want to push something more onto Draco that he didn't want just for the sake of his own savior complex.
"Ron, feel free to write me up for what I'm about to do." Was all the warning Harry gave before he fired a non-verbal jarring Stinger right at Justin's crotch, aiming for the balls.
All in all, Harry's life didn't change since Malfoy had come to live with him, which both worried and relieved Harry. On one hand, he didn't suppose your routine should stay the exact same when there is an entire human being living with you, on the other, Harry never really wanted much change. When Kreacher popped in with Harry's breakfast one morning, Harry stopped Kreacher before he left:
Oh. Hm, well, that made a modicum of sense. Harry nodded at Draco in a show of understanding. Last night was the first time they really touched each other to any degree, they were careful to avoid it in the past since a mere touch did things to the bond.
What he hadn't known, is that McGonagall would introduce a new programme for all the 8th year Pureblood students, which was mandatory, that encompassed learning all about Muggles.
By the time he'd managed to frantically stumble his way out of the wing, Harry had gone. Draco searched the entire house, top to bottom, their attic and all, but Harry was absolutely nowhere to be found.
Granger reluctantly got on behind Ron, tentatively holding onto him. They both squirmed uncomfortably.
"I..I..Harry..I'm so..I'm so sorry—" The words spilled before he could consider them. "That's—I can't even
"Shh, it's okay Harry." Draco reassured, wanting to make it last longer, to take it slow so Harry would know how much Draco was ready to
With a deep breath to center himself, he took off his glasses and dropped them to the ground, stomped on them once to snap the lenses then picked them up and put them back on, all to Malfoy's complete bewilderment.
When the results popped up he started reading through all the names,  looking for something interesting that might catch his attention. Draco was wont to be picky so he assumed it would take a while, but not long after he actually came across something interesting.
I feel it!" Harry hissed between clenched teeth. He dared to finally turn his head down to take a look. His stomach turned to rot as he realized his arm was flayed, the skin eaten halfway off, exposing muscle and tendons beneath, oozing copious amounts of blood onto the floor.
Upon departing and paying, Harry took a pair of gloves and donned them, just in case. He wanted this to be
"Our best friends are idiots." Hermione opened as she took the seat next to Pansy in the bleachers for the Slytherin x Ravenclaw match that was about to start. She was not all that interested in Quidditch, but Draco had wanted to go support his house, but he was hesitant to really show his face out there with so many people, so he'd silently begged Hermione to come with, just so he'd have someone with him. It was quite sweet, of course Hermione had agreed. She'd arrived a bit before him though, and figured she could use the time to see what Pansy intended to do with Harry.
Harry knew he didn't really have any right to expect that, since he hadn't even apologized, but he planned to say all his dues when the time came for it.
Draco's eyes swam, wavering with an emotion that wasn't desire for a flick of a second. Then he looked away:
The ball was a lovely affair. Little fairy lights were sprung up around the Great Hall, and all the tables had been cleared to make space—there was some butterbeer floating around.
that Malfoy had either unconsciously or consciously been hinting at throughout this entirely too long and too harrowing detention.
Even more weeks passed of the school year and school had really started intensifying, however Harry and Hermione spent a lot of their downtime from studying studying Ron and Draco.
Harry wasn't sure how to describe what Malfoy's face did after Harry spoke—but it had Harry worried for a second. At first, he went whiter than paper, then he looked like he'd been tinged green, before finally his skin pinkened to the point it appeared uncomfortable. Harry could safely say it's the closest he'd ever seen Malfoy to being
Draco was surprised to find that they hadn't done all that much redecorating even though they'd lived there going on four years now. He'd thought surely they'd change things up a bit.
The moment she "cast" a fake hex and twirled her wand, he pressed the button, not letting himself think twice or miss the mark.
"Tell me the spells." He muttered under his breath as he drew his wand and summoned first a damp washcloth, then started gently dabbing at the blood on Draco's face. His bottom lip was busted and the cut on his forehead still faintly bled.
"He didn't respond when I picked a fight earlier." He finally announced after twenty minutes of comfortable silence. "If Malfoy's learned to bite his tongue, that counts for some change at least." Ron finally nodded curtly, and fell silent. That was it. "I'm still pissed with everything he's done though." The ginger unnecessarily clarified.
I felt a bit bad for him for that one, I admit. By then I'd figured out this was meant to be an apology—and that it wasn't going to plan, most likely, because if I know Malfoy at all, I know that he never wings anything. That's when the amusement kicked in. Malfoy didn't give me much time to ponder over all the ways I could take advantage of the situation though, because he then sighed very heavily and practically deflated, which frankly worried me."
to your partner." He said it casually, but his leg was bouncing. "Besides, you look like you've got it all figured out, or you
Everything felt so much more urgent now, as if the seconds themselves were sliding down his back. He barked out what they needed and rushed back to the others, to let them know of this new development.
Kreacher popped in with two plates of food then, sparing Harry the internal war, and plopped them on the table.
Draco breathed in once more, ready now. Finally at peace with a decision. He almost started laughing hysterically, for finally coming to a resolution after being plagued for so long felt nearly surreal.
For a few seconds, Harry made to reach out and see what was so wrong, before the pressure of his own cock jolted him to cold reality and with a swooping sense of horror he realized what had actually happened.
He sat up and was just about to go about it, when he stilled. A soft, pained whimper froze Harry in place. He blinked at Draco in the darkness, struggling to make out his shape, but coherent enough to realize he was probably having a nightmare again.
Harry took a few deep breaths, then brought both his hands up to cradle Draco's face. He was staring right into Draco's eyes—though the blonde felt as bared as if he'd been staring into his very
Speaking of said friendship, that too, was turning out to be a nuisance, mostly because he was starting to suspect that being
Malfoy doesn't look haunted or ruffled at all, for a couple of  moments, he appears angry, and then—just thoughtful.
Hermione chuckled and Ron joined her. It was true that their boss would have an apoplexy upon seeing how his two best have all but deserted their positions. That'll be a scandal, for sure.
"Potter! Please--my mother--they tried to--but she didn't--and they're gonna--and there's no one else--oh
Draco took up a compartment right next to Harry's, so he'd be within range, but away from Ron and Hermione.
"Kreacher is surprised the Masters lasted this long." Kreacher shrugged, not looking penitent at all. "The bond is particularly strong between the two."
"I see." The Headmistress spoke at length. "Very well, I can understand this is a matter of great importance."
Sam swallowed a chuckle and said nothing, but he did arch an eyebrow. It was incredibly scintillating, being the one playing the mind games instead of Draco for once. To turn the tables:
Draco nodded against his shoulder, and Harry slowly realized how deeply Draco craved any sort of comfort, the way he was covetously clinging to Harry. It broke Harry's heart to come to understand that, so he calculated a way to lay them back down without disentangling from the blonde.
"Christ." Harry slumped a little, gripping his right arm to his chest. Merlin, he was lucky to even have the bloody thing still.
"Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you've just met."
So he instructed her to mumble a fake Latin word passed off as a hex and he'd time it so to press the canceler and get Draco down and out of the situation, even though his magic was fine and there was technically no need to press the button.
"Right, so, let's get on with it then." Harry mused once Kreacher popped away, made his way over to the rune circle and knelt inside it, bracing himself.
Pansy arched one eyebrow and marveled fleetingly at the caution that Potter never seemed to possess before:
"Oh no, I'm not, just didn't expect it, s'all. What are they like?" He asked, despite the fact it would split him into two to hear it.
"Okay?" Draco pushed off the table, just how Harry pushed away from the door. "Just okay?" His voice was light and very,
shade of green Harry's eyes are, jade with golden-brown rims around the pupils is the conclusion he came to by the way, and outright
He shouldn't be so shocked, it was just that the two of them hadn't had a decent conversation prior, so it came as just a little bit of a surprise to hear this. Especially from Malfoy, whom Harry had never really pegged as particularly caring of a person. Though it wasn't as if he knew Malfoy very well either.
Just as he was about ready to conclude none of it had been real and turn right back to his always plagued, restless sleep, the thing he was laying on shifted beneath him, and Draco found it incredibly odd, since such things as couches did not tend to be living.
Bracing himself deeply, Harry held his breath and pushed the shirt off Draco's shoulders, his hands shaking just a little bit.
Draco was still walking as his thoughts swelled and roiled within his head. He'd reached the end of the street, was about to cross into the docks of the city. The salty smell of sea always calmed his nerves when he felt restless, it drew him in. No matter what, he'd always end up there.
Harry never cried. Out of the two of them, he was always the strong one. The one who understood and comforted. The patient, peaceful one. He didn't cry when he told Draco about his godfather Sirius, he didn't cry when he showed Draco an album filled with photos of his parents, he didn't cry when he told Draco what happened the night he went into the forest to face Voldemort.
Harry swallowed any words that might have come to him—he wasn't sure if he had a right to anymore, since Draco was still stoically ignoring him, despite apparently liking him, if Ron and Hermione were to be believed.
Which meant that Harry would have to let these people leave and file a report, but he and Draco would have to be gone outta here before the Ministry sent someone in. Without a doubt they'd arrest Draco and release Harry of his duties on account of Harry being irresponsible and allowing Draco to be destructive when he had the means to prevent it, take the device off him and either haul Draco back into Azkaban or find another handler for him.
He picked up the final shackle, seeing quite clearly that he won't be able to change Harry's mind—only have Harry be cross with him afterwards if he didn't do this.
"The bond that you and my descendant were engaged by." Grimmauld spoke and snapped Harry out of his musings. "On his end it was a mere amatory bond, however on your end it was a wedded connection, because you fell in love so after the bond was conceived."
Potter seemed to be enjoying himself while they hung out though, two weeks in, so Pansy supposed it was going well thus far.
across his cheek and lip, hissing in pain when two cuts opened and began to bleed. Then he cast a very mild, focused Stinging hex to his forehead, flinching when his skin burned hot for a moment, then grew red and tender.
at it, effectively shattering it into a million pieces and causing a great snap and crash of ceramic cracking violently.
"Potter, you don't have to put on this whole show of—whatever it is, if you don't mean it. Trust me, you won't hurt my feelings."
Just then, Potter and Parkinson seemed to come to some sort of agreement and dash off together, leaving two Hogwarts' founders to once again follow.
He'd heard all about the Ancestral wing from Kreacher when he'd first moved in. It was a hidden wing of Grimmauld that only revealed itself to a pureblooded descendant of the Black family. It was filled with ancient dark spells, artifacts, portraits, family history and the like.
Draco scoffed halfheartedly, still not looking up at Harry. He shifted his seat, and wiped at his eyes, then spoke:
"A pet is a commitment, Harry." Draco pointed out as he set his cup down on the table and took a seat.
Pansy and Hermione leaned against a wall to catch their breaths, searching out the boys with their eyes.
Setting up the ritual had been quick, in large part thanks to McGonagall's expertise on the matter. The woman was apprehensive, even as she aligned everything and prepared for the proceedings.
As she was assuring herself this would not end in spectacular failure it would most likely end in, she discovered Malfoy hiding in the farthest, darkest corner of the library, as he usually was wont to do these days.
He blinked a couple of times and took a few deep breaths to get his galloping heart under control before he was able to speak again:
However, Harry couldn't tell these repairmen not to report to the Ministry either, because that would be incredibly suspicious and odd. After all, anyone who just found out their home was possibly attacked, would want to report it.
Harry went cold when he heard that, but then rounded on Draco as a fresh wave of anger washed over him:
Slowly, they lapsed into silence, the three of them, and as that silence settled, Harry had nothing to distract him from the pressure in his crotch and the aches of his skin. He kept shifting in his seat, trying to find a semi-comfortable position that wouldn't rustle his cock too much, but it seemed as though one simply didn't exist.
Harry swallowed and found his arm automatically curling around Draco in a poor attempt at distraction.
Harry felt a rock congeal in his throat, pressing on it so tightly he could barely breathe let alone speak. He tried to get something out regardless:
After a few more minutes of utter crossfire, there came a silence filled with pained grunts and panting breaths.
Draco's voice hitched. Harry was ready, he was convinced now, he believed every word Draco had said, he remembered how true they were.
"Shove them in a room together. On the next full moon. Harry's transformation won't be nearly as violent or painful if he's able to connect to his mate." Her eyes flittered to the scar on Ron's neck for a second.
Hermione snickered from behind and sat down next to Draco and Ginny on the floor, tilting her head to the side as she looked up at Ron, and spoke in the sweetest tone possible:
"The bond, the lust bond, it was different for him." Draco proceeded to explain everything to them then, how Harry's emotions manifested the lust bond into a complete wedding bond which functioned differently, if broken would kill one or both bonded parties. How for Draco it had remained only the lust bond because he'd loved Harry long before they ever bonded, while Harry fell in love with him after the fact.
"Ouch." Harry managed and slowly went to move and test his mobility and limbs. Everything was working as it should, and was in its proper place. He'd just have to contend with some bruising and soreness for a bit then.
"More than. Ferret's are rather intelligent, that's plenty of time. I must say this is quite a peculiar request. I've never had a case like this one." She admitted.
And then what? Harry supposed he'd stop feeling this way once he was back in school. There would be other people there, his friends, and he wouldn't be focusing as much on Draco. Here in Grimmauld, it was only them and Kreacher, perhaps that's why Harry felt constricted near Draco.
Just as Hermione and Pansy were headed to the Great Hall for lunch, planning ways to break the ice between Potter and Draco—they heard a great lull come over the Hall and hurried inside, just in time to catch McGonagall rising to her feet and clinking a spoon against a crystal glass to get everyone's attention. When she spoke, her voice rang out clear and warm:
"The bond Grimmauld enforced is designed for procreation purposes so the line would be preserved. Masters will probably experience—"
"It's me." Harry whispered—unable to hitch his voice louder, the wisps of the touch they nearly shared coiling around Harry's heart. He finally melded the truth around his mouth. It tasted like sugar.
Draco was collapsed against Blaise's shoulder, squealing in such a high pitch none of them had even heard it at first. He almost reached a dog whistle. Blaise was awkwardly patting Draco's back, and sort of glaring at Harry, though he seemed more amused than anything else.
from Malfoy's office, or Head Auror Weasley here will have your job. Remember, we have a confession now." Potter stepped down from the chair, wand still raised and aimed.
Just then, McGonagall, followed by Granger and Weasley came barreling through the Floo, looking as terrified as Draco felt.
Harry wanted to bite his own tongue off, but he just sighed and shook his head. Better to have Draco cross with him for a few days than for the rest of his life, which was what would happen if he knew.
He stepped onto one of the docks and walked to it's edge, the sea endlessly stretching before his sight, the pale moon reflecting upon the waves.
obsess over Potter, but then, much to his chagrin, he reflected and realized that oh boy, yes he obsessed over Potter. Oh so very embarrassingly much. Still, he had a reputation to uphold:
"Of course not, Lucius." She finally agreed, then continued when his face went slack with relief. "But we
coming towards him of everyone else, he wished he'd accepted his punishment and went to Azkaban instead of taking the plea deal Potter had bargained out of the Ministry for him.
Well, it's not as if he hadn't grown somewhat adept at adjusting despite the aches and finding somewhat of an equilibrium that he could push through the day dancing about. Harry just hoped he'd manage to accomplish that soon, lest he might just go completely nuts.
"Like hell there isn't." Pansy snipped—she fully intended to find out what the hell he planned to do.
And it would always hurt when they realized what they'd done was an empty comfort to a faded solace.
Not that he particularly minded, he had to admit there was a certain charm to just being taken so freely.
"Right, sorry. Just get me some Pain relief potions—and a muscle relaxant then. Thanks." Harry added then, he figured that a muscle relaxant could be useful after an electric shock.
Draco couldn't afford to think of those blasted hell-spawns for long, or something in the house would end up broken and Harry wouldn't be happy with him.
When the full wolf finally emerged from the shadowed corners of the room, Draco's breath hitched. The wolf was a dirty gray color, and blinking up at Draco with such crystal green eyes—Harry's eyes.
like Draco. Guys, I'm—in love with him." The words felt foreign rolling off Harry's tongue, but he couldn't stop them once they started, as if a wave of them roiled in his throat and demanded to spill out. "And at the time I really thought he'd never actually feel the same, I just didn't want him to ever find out, so I—got him to think that."
"Well, I'll be crying a whole bunch in the foreseeable future apparently. Thought to get it out of the way now why. So your her—hm, Gryffindorness, doesn't come prodding."
And push it into the extremes she did—what with all the lingering hugs and leaning into Draco and brushing against him every chance she got that she was doing.
of your nonsense anymore. In case you should attempt to lie to each other, the charms inlaid into the parchment
Draco froze. He...he did..? When the fuck—? Had to have been during the break yesterday, he'd spent all of it staring at Harry, so it was certainly possible he'd called to him at some point without realizing.
It seemed that the second he thought that, his entire body lurched and he was thrown forward, shooting out a specific opening with a shocking speed. Draco somehow found his footing, stumbling slightly as he emerged out of the purple flames along with a rather substantial amount of soot. He let go of both the trunks in an effort to steady himself, coughing as the soot attempted to get into his mouth and lungs. Something screeched-maybe a chair-and the sound of nearing footsteps erupted through the new space he had found himself in.
to confide personal things in him as well. For all Blaise knew, Harry wasn’t telling any of his secrets because they were even worse than anything Blaise had hidden away in his head. No, Harry was just fine keeping his secrets, and after so long contemplating it, Blaise didn’t see any reason to press harder to try and uncover them.
Luna closed her eyes, continuing to breathe deeply as the sun shone through the window and hit her eyes, bathing the back of her eyelids in red. The sounds of birds squawking outside and the present-if muffled-voices of her daddy and Theo downstairs washed over her. There was a creaky step that Theo kept stepping on, and the boy either didn’t care enough about it to avoid it or simply wasn’t paying any attention to it. She could hear the creaking now, the noise vibrating through the house every five seconds exactly. Was Theo pacing for some odd reason? Perhaps he was getting into another cumbersome argument with her daddy. That seemed to be happening a lot lately, over peculiar things like someone named ‘Her’ and about a prophecy that Theo refused to recite in full. Luna didn’t know if she even wanted to ask him about it, feeling like she already had so many problems of her own and of Harry’s that took president over Theo’s grievances. She just couldn’t focus much attention on a prophecy or the entity of ‘Her’ when all else was unknown and falling about her ears. She already had a malicious feminine entity to contend with after all, Luna was certain she didn’t need another.
“Then just show me the fookin’ letter, damn it!” Draco shouted, his chair clattering to the floor as he leapt up from the table, his hair askew and messy and his eyes feral.
The past did not taint them, and never would, and that knowledge was so horribly, wonderfully comforting that Harry was forced to admit he wished to keep them close, if only for that reason. If only because they were kind, and brilliant, and so wonderfully understanding of what he was facing, of not just who, but
Luna took a deep breath, a calming breath, before finally looking at Theo closer. His magic was erratic, jumping about with feelings of concern and… and embarrassment, strangely enough. It was all there, swimming through his core. Luna adjusted her duvet back over her legs, before forgoing simplicity and pulling it up to her neck, burrowing her face into the warm blankets. The woman’s hands had been so impossibly cold, far beyond the cold of ice or snow; they had felt like death itself, and Luna just didn’t know how to react to that thought, or that feeling. It had been so strange to actually see a person, their eyes and lips and that
Grabbing a hold of Draco’s arm, Harry caught Perenelle’s eye without trouble, as the woman had been reading a book calmly through the entire thing. He swiftly motioned towards the exit with his chin before starting towards it, not waiting for even a moment as Perenelle put her book away to wherever she had been keeping it, likely a charmed pocket or something equally frivolous, and followed along after them.
Nicolas closed his mouth, before opening it again. “It is made almost exclusively of Alchemist’s Hand, though it has been compressed to the point of being in the form of a large gem. It is, at its most basic, an incredibly refined and dense form of Alchemist’s Hand.”
The hand moved from the back of his neck to his shoulder, and began to gently pull him backward. He fought it at first, instinctively wanting to curl further in on himself in retaliation. Pernelle’s soothing voice was gentle though, and eventually, he let her guide him back up, letting go of his hair and letting his hands fall back into his lap. His shoulders were still shaking as she let go of his shoulder fully to instead embrace him from the side, and he sank into her side as she continued to whisper worried phrases under her breath, her hand coming back up again to cradle the back of his neck.
“It was wonderful meeting you Harry, I hope to see you again soon.” He nodded genially in agreement, shaking her outstretched hand before lowering himself enough to give Gabrielle a chaste hug, of which she seemed insistent on not letting go of.
“My lord-” He gasped out, trying to hold in a wince as the fist holding his hair tightened, the glowing green eyes narrowing slightly as the curiosity was immediately overtaken by seething anger. He gasped again as a sudden light momentarily blinded him, and he immediately slammed his eyes shut as the tip of another wand was shoved into his face. He registered the sound of someone muttering ‘lumos’ mere seconds late, it seemed.
When he didn’t reply, or maybe when continued to avert his eyes and stare blankly at a darkened stain in the tabletop, Draco sighed heavily and leaned forward, head in one hand.
He read through the letter a second time, only glancing over the nonsensical ramblings about Harry and his escapades as his eyes zeroed in on the invitation to go shopping for supplies. It was incredibly unlikely that Harry and Draco would be there, just considering where they would be at the time Blaise was planning on leaving. August third was a little over a week away as well, which was plenty of time to make plans with the others and see how Luna thought of the whole thing.
Harry didn’t quite know what to say to that, and continued to stare blankly at the immortal as she giggled with undisguised mirth. If his heart had stopped, then why did he still have his magic? He didn’t want to say her logic was flawed, but it seemed that his general existence seemed to betray her belief instead of solidifying it.
He slammed the book shut, turning to glare as Harry thumped his chest a few times, clearing his throat as he fought to get his laughter under control. Draco watched, utterly unamused, as the boy made a show of calming down, going so far as to brush invisible lint from his thin muggle 'tank top' before finally turning to Draco’s waiting gaze.
“However,” the man continued, his grin veering on maniacal as Tom felt his own cool unease settle deep inside him. “I have very little sympathy for your plight. I think it is quite obvious to you now that, despite my deep concerns, I have every intention of melding with you today. This intention does not, however, negate the fact that I am deeply concerned for what will come of the universe that we live in once Hadrian receives your gift. We will not be there to see it, after all, and all we have of that time is theoreticals. If you can prove to me that, despite what he has become after becoming one with his Demon, he will continue on the right path.”
Tom coughed again, waving his hand in front of his face as if to remove a foul odor from his general vicinity. Harry could only assume that the air smelt far more spicy than it tasted, and couldn’t help but be happy that he couldn’t breath.
Perenelle’s voice was like a cold bucket of ice to his system, electrocuting every nerve in the hyper-aware state he had fallen into. He jerked again, gaze locking onto her relaxed form as she poured two cups of tea, slowly and attentively. Draco watched the gentle movements for a sparse second before his gaze fell back onto Harry, his attention focusing back onto the greatest issue on his mind as he slowly walked around the table before settling in the nearest chair, watching desperately for any more signs of panic or frustration or… hell,
it must have to do with Marvolo, hm? Don’t you think he would like to know? Like to know like to know like to knowww~!” The locket sang, pulling at its restraints pitifully as he glared from across the room. “Now come on, Thomas, tell me. Tell me tell me tell me tell-”
Perenelle shook her head ever so slightly, as if she was trying not to move. “There are no pros of soulmates, in the end. All that they allot is a deeper understanding of another person, and force a potentially unwilling pair into a union that will always end in the deaths of both people. It is a cruel existence-”
He set the now empty tea cup back onto the table, slowly sitting up as the nausea fully passed and his head cleared. Harry caught his eye from across the couch and smiled, a look that completely took him aback once he got his first good look at his soulmate, for the very first time in nearly three months.
“Peculiar… very peculiar.” He didn’t want to try anything with the strange hole until asking Harry what he thought, as it was technically his head as well. Sadly though, Harry was currently asleep, and would likely be very against any sort of nighttime exploration of a seemingly endless open space inside his own mind.
Standing suddenly, the blue-eyed man regarded Tom kindly before turning away, continuing to talk as he browsed through the seemingly infinite books around them. The pair were in the diadem’s mind, which was not only vast-far larger than Tom’s mindscape could ever hope to be without them molding together-but also much deeper. The library around them stretched on for miles, though the substance held in the tomes could be nothing or everything-it was difficult to tell what books were meant to be tricks to misdirect intruders or actual memories and knowledge.
Harry ignored Tom’s grumbling about them ‘not knowing’ as he stepped onto the train, Draco trailing quietly behind him. He tried to ignore the heat at his back as he pulled the other boy towards the back-most car, distracting himself by making a mental checklist of everyone he expected to join them for the ride. Theo hopefully wouldn’t, which was a good thing for his peace of mind, but also made Luna’s appearance doubtful, which was less of a good thing. He didn’t see any reason why Blaise and Daphne wouldn’t show, which meant that Tracey would likely join them as well. Beyond that though, he didn’t really know. Harry frowned, wondering how he managed to amass such a shockingly small group of friends. Granted, they were all far more than he could handle all in one sitting, but the group seemed like fewer people than he had thought.
Draco froze, feeling his father’s grip tighten further as the man’s gaze bore into the side of his head. What could his father possibly need to talk to Harry about? Did he somehow find out about their... relationship? Draco felt perspiration spread across the back of his neck, a cool sweat breaking out as his father’s gaze seemed to sharpen and gain intensity every second that he did not answer.
He glanced down at the unassuming thing, brushing a thumb down the blank, yellow-colored wax seal keeping it bound. Luna had never written to him before, not in his first life and certainly not in the second, so it had been rather strange to suddenly receive a letter from her. So strange in fact, that he had set it down and forgotten all about it for several days, swept up in the final preparations for his birthday and the other day-to-day leasures that he had been relishing in. Now though, he was waiting for the clock to strike midnight, and had nothing to do besides either read the bloody thing or a book.
Evening light streamed through the windows as he sprinted past them, acting as a strange nexus point between the past and present. In the present, it was just barely sunset, with the sky awash with glorious shades of reds and yellows and deep oranges. In the past, however, as he had rushed past those massive windows, the entire corridor had been bleeding with red streaks of light. But not in the present. No, Marvolo took sour notice of that discrepancy as he ducked around a corner, perfectly replicating the bombarda that he had cast at Lord Riddle’s legs. A piece of the floor imploded on itself in the present, but in the past Lord Riddle’s left leg had done the same, splattering bone fragments and gore all across his son’s ankles as the man screamed. Tom Riddle senior had not even glanced behind him, too focused on escape to care that he had just lost another of his parents, rendering him orphaned in a sense.
“Well… I suppose we ought to keep an eye out then.” He finally replied, eliciting a morose hum from Daphne, who seemed all too ready to start unraveling this new mystery of the year. She left it be though, at least for the time being, though he kept catching her sending Harry quizzical glances through the entire carriage ride. He didn’t think Harry was even paying attention to her though, too busy quietly whispering with Draco about something or another.
She brushed his hair down into some sense of respectability, standing up on her toes in order to kiss the crown of his head, struggling slightly as he was at least four inches taller than her now. Draco leaned down a bit so she wouldn’t strain herself at all, a feeling of pride bubbling up from his stomach as she reached
The man stumbled back half a step, his body seeming to wither as he realized that it was Harry and not Tom who had visited him. “I… I see.”
He couldn’t help but let a pleased smirk spread across his face as he walked through the dimly lit corredores, knowing that he had gotten the best possible luck despite the tragedy that it had stemmed from. Theo had gleefully realized that, since the agreement was still firmly in place and they had been returned from Hogwarts a month early, he was unknowingly being allowed two extra weeks away from the twisting, abysmal manor. Admittedly, he was marginally less excited for the excursion now that he and Harry weren’t speaking, since Luna seemed to be taking a moderators perspective on what she, in her letters, referred to as an ‘argument’.
“This is different. I’ve already said that.” He whispered, pleading silently to the still air around him as his instincts fought a dirty battle against his logic.
Where the door to the ring had once been, there was now a gaping hole. The edges were ragged, as if the entire door, frame and all, had been ripped from the wall to reveal the emptiness of space that laid beyond.
from the dancers, instead of the opposite. He wondered idly if that was due to the soul bond or the simple fact of his inhumanity. Turning slightly to Draco, he nearly snorted at the expression he sported, one with an acute disgust that rivaled any other he could have managed.
The bastard seemed to know this too, since he smiled in a very smug way before continuing on with his lecture. “As we have found through the separation of our own soul and of Hadrian’s…
“I’m not misplacing my emotions.” He reiterated, returning to his pacing again with slight aggression. Theo would be able to tell if he was ‘misplacing his emotions’ and would most certainly be able to correct himself for it if he was. No, he was just concerned that Luna was trying to deal with a vision alone, something that he knew could be very difficult to manage depending on the ferocity of the vision. Sure, Luna had never made her abilities completely known to him, but her panicked expression, the sweat she was drenched in and the faraway look in her eyes as they stared off at an invisible something, was all horribly familiar to him. Theo didn’t want her to have to process something like that alone, especially if he and her father were there and understood.
He jolted, feeling a sudden intrusion inside his mind. For a moment he felt like panicking, before realizing that it was just Tom leaving his own mindscape. Harry flowled the vague feeling of his father’s magic as it climbed the stairs out of the dungeons and moved swiftly through the halls of Hogwarts, the man’s path veering very quickly towards Harry’s library. He felt confused at this, knowing that there was very little that he knew that Tom was not already privy to. Had something happened?
Harry tried to steady himself, grinning in a way he hoped was at least somewhat believable, as he forced his shoulders to go slack and for his body to relax. “It comes and goes.”
“Through our individual conscience, we become aware of our deeply held moral principles, we are motivated to act upon them, and we assess our character, our behavior and ultimately our self against those principles. Different philosophical, religious and common sense approaches to conscience have emphasized different aspects of this broad characterization. Hadrian, simply put, does not embody this awareness. He has no moral principles. Sure, he can understand morals that he has held in the past and morals that society itself has, but he feels nothing in regards to them. It is clear that if there were no consequences for his actions, Hadrian simply would act however he pleased.”
“You know, I vaguely remember you wearing that same jacket a year ago and it was quite-ehm, well it was a tad bit baggy-”
The constant movement in front of him, the unfamiliar seat beneath him. All of it was so, so much more than he was accustomed to. It was just
He almost wanted to step away, run back through the woods. Not to see what was happening, but maybe to get a better picture. It had to be happening early, and it had to be for some reason he didn’t know. Was it something that he had done? It had to have been. Any changes spiderwebbed out from his own decisions.
Maneuvering around downed stacks of books and a particularly worn looking painting, the woman inside huffing at him disapprovingly, he turned a corner, quickly came upon Perenelle as she twirled through the second floor’s main hallway. He stopped short, watching as she weaved through the hall, humming gently under her breath as she watered the masses of hallway plants, stepping to and fro from the overgrown beasts that had likely been there for longer than he had been alive. Harry immediately felt himself calm, letting out a tired sigh as he brushed a spindly hand through his hair, likely making it all stick up on end more than normal.
And that knowledge, the knowledge that he was utterly powerless to help Draco in any way but how Lord Malfoy wished, was driving him utterly
“The future is only known by Fate in full, and she would never share her knowledge with me-with us. But that doesn’t matter, does it, because if the universe was destroyed by Harry she would have failed, yes? Fate wouldn’t allow Harry, even if he is the Master of Death, to destroy the entire universe. Do you truly expect me to believe that a goddess, no matter how utterly sadistic and wretched, would ever wish the universe gone?”
Harry felt his smile grow a little strained then, a little pained, and he had a sudden urge to throw his trunk to the ground and collapse in her arms, begging that he be allowed to stay there for the rest of time. It would be so,
itching at the surface, just a bit too fuzzy for her to quite figure out. She rubbed at the itch in her eyes, muttering at the feeling as buzzing overtook her ears. She needed to figure it out—she needed to sort one thing from the next and figure out what the Woman was trying to
Tom nodded warily, not trusting himself to say something intelligent if he were to open his mouth. The blue-eyed man always seemed to have that kind of effect on him.
She didn’t ask a question, and he didn’t seem to want to give an answer regardless. Letting out a deep breath, she scooted up and wrapped her free arm around his shoulder, pulling him away from the small pile of rocks that he had been taking pieces out of as she rested her head on his shoulder.
He scoffed, watching as small tendrils of shadow started wriggling around behind the shoddily imagined shelf, attempting to get in-likely in an effort to steal Tom’s most important memories of important times in their life. He scowled at the poor attempt, focusing more of his magical energy into walling off the connection entirely as the shelf was slowly molded into a fortified iron door that completely covered up the hole. He let out a breath once it was in place, temporarily keeping the shadows out while he tried to come up with a long-term plan.
The older man looked at him carefully, an emotion that Theo thought might be regret apparent in his shadowed face. “Then why do you insist on this? There are so many other places for you to spend your time. I admit that this old manor is doing your development no good, but those
They passed by a familiar gaggle of redheads on their way towards the train, and Draco’s complaints about his nausea ceased as they both gazed at the unnaturally subdued family, slowing in stride slightly as they observed the noticeably smaller group. Molly looked like she had lost a considerable amount of weight, and her hands shook slightly as she flattened down Ron’s jumper. Arthur was nowhere to be found, likely still hard at work at the ministry or who knows where else. Percy also seemed to have not joined them, likely also at the ministry with his father. The twins were there though, and stood a bit to the side of their mother, whispering quietly to themselves as they leaned over a small blue book. They seemed to be fairing the best out of their family, but Harry got an uneasy feeling as he passed them by, the feeling only doubling as they glanced up to look at him. Fred sent him a tight smile, but George didn’t bother, merely nodding once before returning to the book. Harry supposed they had their own way of mourning, one that didn’t involve the pranks he was paying to help them create.
There was a low sigh, and as he settled back onto his knees again, his hand once again coming back up to cradle his arm, Barty chanced a peek upwards, feeling his anxiety spike as the looming figure crouched back down to his level, the large man settling back on his haunches to regard Barty with a severely annoyed look. He withered under the gaze, immediately looking back down in shame. He had committed a severe offense, that was obvious, though his lord didn’t seem particularly compelled to explain what he had done.
“Let. Me. Out! Let. Me. Out! Leettt… Meeee… OUT!” It parroted cruelly, hissing and biting in Tom’s direction as he stared on emotionlessly. He felt his anger wavering slightly, the exertion of so many hours of fighting and using magic inside his own mind finally beginning to make his shoulders sag under its weight.
He thought to himself curiously, setting the envelope onto a stack of other opened envelopes on the counter as he unfolded the letter. Turning away from Xenophilius’ nosy eyes, Theo quickly began to read through the short letter, struggling at some points to understand the jerky script.
At first she had chalked it up to the incident with Harry and the dementor, and then-after she heard that he had been locked up all summer long-she thought that perhaps he was just lashing out due to the seclusion that he had been forced into. Then, of course, she had found out about Loki, and everything had gotten that much worse. She didn’t want to consider what would happen if the god decided to force Blaise to do anything more, and her boyfriend seemed insistent on ignoring the thought as well.
“It’s a different kind of close.” He replied, unwittingly feeling himself relax in that empty, cramped hallway. There was a familiar presence all around him. His father’s presence. He was going to be okay. He wasn’t going to eat today, but he was going to be okay.
It was silent for an uncomfortably long time. Harry itched at his jumper as the air in the compartment started to steadily rise in heat.
All thoughts of the hole in Tom’s mind or the potential concern on the horizon melted away, replaced by potions concepts and magical brews as the sun steadily rose higher and higher in the sky. It would be many hours before Nicolas came stumbling down the stairs to greet them, and by then the kitchen would be awash with a wide variety of potion ingredients and even more books, causing the cluttered space to practically drip with chaos. Harry forgot about the morning’s escapades, and as Tom furiously tore through his library to further fortify it against intruders, Harry let himself be swept away by long-forgotten potions practices and warm rays of sunlight that forcibly reminded him of his own sunny boy that he had left across the pond.
“I don’t trust him, Harry.” The boy snipped, whipping around to face the tall figure he was half-hidden behind.
Tom took a deep breath, gathering himself as he imagined a large shelf made of pure iron into being in front of the wall of darkness, blocking it from gaining entrance further inside of his own mind. Stumbling backwards, he leaned some weight into the bookshelf behind him, breathing heavily as the pain in his head doubled and the ringing became near-unbearable.
Draco shifted in place suddenly, and the sacred moment of impossibility was yanked to a grinding halt, and Harry found himself rooted back into reality once more. A cruel, unjust, wretched reality where his soulmate was about to be disowned because somehow, against everything he knew, a soul shard of Voldemort’s had somehow wrangled its way back into a body. Someone had given the bastard life, and now the most important person to him was going to suffer for it.
It was quiet for a moment. Harry didn’t think that even the air around him was moving, it was so still.
He shifted in place for a moment, contemplating the feeling of light wrapping around his prone form from where he laid deep inside his own soul. Of course, the Failure couldn’t help but take a few slivers of his soul out as well, carving away at the small pieces that he held so dear. It had left him weakened, and as Tom Riddle continued to return more and more slices of his soul were taken away. He could only assume that his failure to comply with the Failure’s demands had resulted in such pathetic attempts to tear him apart bit by bit.
Harry sighed, rubbing a hand down his tired face before glancing towards his trunk lying innocently on the ground.
Harry also stood, taking one last glance at the gold before straightening to his full height and stretching his shoulders. The past week had gone by well enough, though his chest had been aching horribly for the past five days or so and his sleep was suffering greatly from the strain on the soul bond. He was loath to consider what might happen in a month's time, so instead kept his attention focused onto his studies with both Nicolas and Perenelle. The Lady Flamel had taken to lecturing on potions whenever he was free from Nicolas’ clutches, so he had been effectively blocking out the aches and lack of sleep well enough, though he constantly found himself worrying about how Draco was fairing.
Draco made movement to stand, but was stopped short suddenly by a hand on his arm. All three of them turned to Harry, the tall boy blinking blearily from his spot on the bench as he rubbed at his eyes. He seemed only half-awake, and looked as though they had personally offended him by speaking. Draco seemed to observe the tall boy’s expression, before he scoffed, loudly. Sending a glare Blaise’s way, he gently removed Harry’s hand from his arm and summoned his book back from Blaise’s side of the compartment, glaring pointedly in the Italian’s direction before settling his rump back down onto the compartment seat. The tall boy beside him blinked owlishly at the motion, before closing his eyes again and resting his head back on its perch.
The shouts were getting slightly more distinct. Draco tilted his head slightly, his nose scrunching up in concentration as if he was thinking very hard about something. He was hearing it too now, Harry was sure of it. He turned away again, eyes pinned on the area of forest they came from. Waiting. Watching.
“Don’t be like that, Tommy! You must understand, I am simply curious about that… what was it that dear Hadrian received? A letter? My, I do want to know what is in that lovely little letter. Won’t you tell me, sweet thing?” The locket cooed, its wide, bloodshot eyes twinkling as its grin sharpening, only widening further as he glowered hatefully. The locket had burst down the door between them just as Harry had thrown his fist into the wall of his bedroom, which Tom considered nothing but the faintest reprieve from his consistent annoyances. Fate must have been pitying him, in the very least, since it meant that the locket hadn’t been there for the initial reading, and Tom had managed to keep the contents of the letter mostly a mystery, at least until Harry had gone and opened his fat mouth about it being from Lucius Malfoy.
Harry laughed out-right at that, his grip on Draco’s hands tightening as he did. “Metal is heavy, you know. I’ve been carrying it around all bloody summer, Nicolas has turned me into his personal pack mule.”
Green light fell away into nothingness as he reached the corpse, arm still outstretched as he collapsed beside it, giggling childishly as he whispered the Greek phrases under his breath in delirious half-parseltongue, a darkened hissing overlaying the ancient words as his soul was severed in two. Marvolo’s memory fell away into black, and he regained senses as he crouched over empty space, void of anything but dust. For a moment, all he did was stare at the dust-ridden floor, far away and breathing heavy. That was the last memory he had of being part of the whole, and then he had been thrown into the darkness of his own mind, lost to the decadent insanity that he had been forged from. Horcruxes, after all, existed in the exact moment that they had been conceived, ever-living out the feelings that the whole had been experiencing that the time. It was simply his nature to delight in such play.
Xenophilius hummed, eyes moving very suddenly from where they had been observing a section of the wall to lock onto his own and stay there. Theo jolted in shock, finding it difficult to look away from the man’s gaze. Xenophilius’ eyes were a shockingly light gray-almost white-and had a feel of having seen far too much far too quickly. The man smiled knowingly, tapping the side of his nose as he spoke again. “Are you sure? She has told me that you have had a prophecy nearly a year ago. Has it already come to pass?”
“No, you twat!” The blond screeched, nearly dropping Harry’s poor head as he lunged forward and threw his book in the vague direction of Blaise's face. “I was invited!”
The first thing that he had learned of had been a peculiar man of the name Wormtail, who was a less than trustworthy Death Eater and had given up Hadrian Potter and his family at the height of the war. The Failure hadn’t said much about the man besides calling him a rat, but Marvolo was resourceful if anything and knew that he could find wherever the man had hidden himself. It was cumbersome to find the man, but if the elder wand was still in Hadrian Potter’s unworthy clutches, then Wormtail was the best bet for finding where his yew wand had been taken. Perhaps he even had kept it.
Blaise rolled his eyes, patting Theo on the shoulder with a whispered ‘whatever it takes to get out of here sooner, mate’ before he disappeared back into the stacks of stationary, leaving Theo to ponder without a second word.
Tom rubbed his face, mind swirling with thoughts and memories that he had brushed off as unimportant for over a decade. Even his very first action in Harry’s head had shown this instinct that he had been created around, when his very first decision as a soul inside his mortal enemy’s head was to destroy the hate wards around number four Privet Drive.
Harry sighed, picking up a few leaves of the Anjelica herb before carefully, gently ripping off a few little pieces, adding the flakes to the angrily sizzling brew as gently as he could manage. The reaction was not instantaneous, but there was a bitterness to the air that seemed to turn from just bitter to particularly acidulated as he added more and more of the Anjelica herb, and Harry couldn’t help but clear his throat slightly as his vision clouded to near-opaqueness and the cauldron disappeared behind a wave of smog.
Theo sighed, letting his hand fall with the intention of turning around and finding his way back before he froze, staring blankly at the space in front of him. Right there, in place of the empty wall that had been mere seconds before, was a bright red door.
She laughed then, cheery and wonderful and so kind that it made his chest physically ache. Merlin, he would miss this woman. “Won’t your muggle family get rather upset if we stole you away like that? They haven’t seen you for about a year now, you know.”
“That's quite alright-yes quite alright… who are you?” Xenophilius turned away before Theo could speak, walking off to the other side of the room as he muttered something unintelligible under his breath. Theo let out a pained groan and sat up, rubbing his cheek while wincing. His grandfather had always been in good condition for a man of his age, but his strength had been surprising despite that.
The lythe man’s voice was scratchy, from either misuse or overuse, Draco couldn’t tell. He couldn’t consider which one it could be as the man’s hand left Harry’s and suddenly came to a stop in front of him. Draco blinked, sparing a confused glance Harry’s way before taking the outstretched hand as it was offered to him, opening and closing his mouth a few times before finally finding the ability to speak.
“I don’t really like parties that I don’t plan myself, and magical tents have never been very comfortable to me. I’d much rather just return home.” She replied breezily, waving an arm around through the air as if the entire thought wasn’t worth her time. He was about to try again, his confusion veering to unease before his eyes suddenly landed on her wrist, naturally following the moment of her hands as something red glimmered in the light of their wands.
There was a mix of admiration and terror on Crouch’s face as Harry climbed the ladder—a certain fearful loyalty that Harry was positive had been born from his little melt-down the week prior. He grimaced slightly as he clambered out of the trunk, brushing himself off tiredly as the trunk’s lid slid shut behind him. He didn’t
Yes, that was what he would do. Marvolo would write to the Knights of Walpurgis, and any of those who were still living would surely heed his call. They would return, and with them would come information of what he had missed, and then there would be nothing his memories could do to refute his own authority. He would be the true soul, he would no longer be second to Tom Riddle, be he the muggle or the wizard.
Barty let the thoughts of torture fall away, listening as Winky hopped off of the seat next to him and greeted the man of the house. If Barty could move his eyes, he might have been able to see her do so, but his gaze was forever locked onto his right pointer finger, all else being blurry as his eye was ever focused on that damned overgrown nail.
He whispered to himself, half focused on the fascinating discovery and half concerned for Harry and his apparent anger. It was the taller boy’s birthday after all, what was there to be angry about? Many things, he supposed, but not so early in the morning. Draco sighed, forcing his gaze away from the bolts of red as the green and gold seemed to throb, the anger dissipating and being suddenly replaced with… sadness? Frustration? Draco scrunched up his nose, trying to settle on an emotion that he could comprehend with a surprising lack of luck. It seemed that, most plainly, Harry was feeling so many different things at once that the boy himself likely couldn’t even sort one feeling from the other.
The man with icy blue eyes leaned back in his chair, his dark hair falling into those unsettling eyes as he regarded Tom with a patient look. Tom didn’t reply verbally, instead just sitting there, waiting. The blue-eyed man seemed satisfied with his answer, and continued.
“Oh.” She breathed, watching as a familiar, horrific sight came slinking through the doorway and into the great hall. Harry’s soul was just as terrifying as she remembered it being on the last day of school, that familiar mess of constantly changing color and feeling, shifting and altering itself as the texture and color of his soul melted from one thing to the next. She watched, dazed and head fuzzy, as Harry’s magic switched effortlessly between strings of thick coils and dense wisps of smoke and fire, gold and green moving and bending through him as if it was a current of ever-increasing energy.
“Finally.” He muttered, once the team had left and people started slowly gathering their things, the diplomats and honored guests of the top box chattering on about Merlin knew what as he finally took his fingers from his ears, finding that the roar of people hadn’t dulled much as the crowd continued to cheer for the Irish team, who were taking their fourth victory lap, the trophy held high in the captain’s hand.
Harry nodded silently, turning back to the potion as Nicolas’ form darted across the room. “And after that?”
“Yes… yes as I said, we will be hosting a Yule ball this year. We have decided to do so as, in light of the recent tragedies here, the ministry has agreed to allow Hogwarts to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament!”
made everyone around her jump, and all eyes turned to the main doors as they swung open and shut with a dull thud. Luna blinked, watching as a young soul—perhaps somewhere around two decades old—hobbled into the hall. The soul was excited, sprightly even, though its movements—its body’s physical movements, that is—felt far different from the soul’s movements. The stark contrast was so blatant and unnatural in fact, that she got an unpleasant shiver up her spine. The body and soul did not feel to be in sync. At least, that was the best way she could describe the shambling crawl and how acutely wrong it felt with the sprightly, excited ball of energy that was the man’s soul.
“What misplaced emotions would I possibly-don’t answer that.” He groaned, stopping just long enough to vigorously rub at his cheeks. Why was his face so bloody cold? The summer heat was bearing down on the house relentlessly, and the rest of his body was practically sweltering. Hell, he had dressed impressively light that morning, wearing only a thin button up shirt and trousers. Was there a draft somewhere?
The dreams Luna is talking about are from chapter 35 of How Fate Intended. The chapter is titled "Tread Carefully"
“Cut out my tongue! Cut out my tongue!” It echoed, its head lolling back as it continued to giggle inanely. “I do love when you threaten me, Voldemort.”
Harry let out a quiet scoff, and shook his head. There was no possible way for him to lie his way out of this situation. It was as inescapable as Fate’s grip was on the fabric of time.
They bounced ideas off of each other for a few hours after that, trying to brainstorm ideas for what they could do about the issue before actually facing or even confirming that it was in fact an issue. It was about nine in the morning that Harry found himself officially waking up, the warm sun now very clearly in the sky. He groaned, flexing his fingers as he stretched out like a cat in the desperate attempt to gain more maneuverability in his limbs. It hadn’t been nearly this hard to wake up each morning when he had been sleeping only a few feet away from the human furnace that was Draco Malfoy, but now that he was in a room that didn’t get much heat in the first place… well, he was wondering if asking for a room with a fireplace would be a good use of his time.
Pansy hadn’t really expected a visit from Tracey over the summer, as neither of them had thought it would be all that good of an idea considering Tracey’s rather poor reputation in the eyes of high society and Pansy’s family’s high standing in said society. However, it seemed that there was very little for either of them to do now that the summer had gotten a tad bit longer, and as Greengrass seemed to be far more interested in playing house with Zabini and Nott had all but dropped off the map, Pansy had tentatively extended the offer for the other girl to come over and see the estate for a day or two. Surprisingly, Tracey had begged off some sort of family vacation to do so, and they had happily planned out what they would do while she was at the manor.
“Many of you may be wondering why you were asked to bring along dress robes this year, and I promise you that it is for a very good reason. You see, we will be hosting a Yule ball this winter.”
Daphne’s mouth opened and closed like a fish. Blaise didn’t know if he should feel concerned for her worldview or ecstatic that she was even capable of being shocked silent. This was a
He thought, twirling the lavender-engraved timepiece around a finger as he watched a butterfly—its wings a harsh green broken up by speckles of yellow—flutter into the room. It hardly mattered at the moment, since he would soon be at Hogwarts and worrying about the logistics of the coming year, but it was something he wanted to think about going forward.
A door opened, and in a few strides Barty felt his body sit down in a chair and begin to eat. It seemed to be some sort of soup that day, going by the texture and taste. Chicken broth maybe? Not the most filling meal by any means, but it was better than the beans he had been given for breakfast.
Theo stumbled out of the fireplace with a yelp, attempting to get his feet underneath him before very unceremoniously tripping over himself and falling to the floor in a heap. He was still for a moment, contemplating if he was experiencing karma or simply bad luck, before he let out a sharp hiss of pain as his trunk came flying out of the fireplace behind him and landed onto his back with a thump. For a moment, he let the chilled stone underneath his left cheek cool the stinging sensation that was still present there, before a large hand landed on his upper back and he opened both eyes to find himself staring at a man that looked exactly how he expected a middle aged male version of Luna might look like.
“He was doing a lot of physical work over the summer.” The shorter boy finally admitted, a suspicious pink tinge slowly traveling up his neck to his cheeks, causing Blaise to smirk. “So it is perfectly understandable that he has gained body mass.”
once he’s chosen? Daphne, this isn’t going to change anything with my standing in Slytherin, I’m just going to have fewer things to worry about. The older years aren’t going to grow a spine and fight me on things just because I’m stepping down from a, frankly, rather unremarkable post.”
The little girl nodded enthusiastically, before leaning slightly around him to level a scrutinizing look Draco’s way. His soulmate seemed utterly unphased.
“So you have then? Good good, I was certain you had, but my daughter was unsure. Of course, my dear moon had yet to see Her, so that is no surprise.”
The butterfly was nowhere to be found. Harry supposed that it must have flown back out to the dangerous world outside his room.
Harry sat back in his chair, looking around the warm kitchen in thought. The Flamel house had been a surprise to him, to say the least. He had expected something small and tucked away, just a small little place to work on projects or something similar. However, he had been pleasantly surprised to instead find himself in a cozy yet regal château out in the woods, surrounded by miles of trees and wildflowers and connected to no roads or towns or anything similar. The house itself seemed to blend perfectly into the scenery, nearly disappearing behind vines and floral pots and baskets of ferns.Everything inside of the house was compressed to make room, with the dining room situated half in the kitchen as every available space was completely taken up by pots and pans and dried herbs and pickling things of unknown varieties. Perenelle had a rather expansive garden in a greenhouse nearby, which he wanted to see for the simple fact that it apparently had some of the rarest potion ingredients on the planet inside. Strangely enough, the crowdedness of the space ended up making it feel just as small and tucked away as he had expected, regardless of the obvious wealth of the couple.
“Well, that should hold for a month or two. Maybe even longer if he stops trying to break through.” The both seemed to find that concept particularly unrealistic, and Harry shook his head with a laugh while leading the rather pained older man over to a couch.
He shouldered the door open, scrunching up his nose slightly and holding back a flinch as he was splashed with a foul-smelling, sticky potion, which quickly raced down his face to the rest of his body, cleaning the smoke’s lethal effects from his skin and clothes. Shoving the air-tight door closed behind him, Harry glared at Nicolas as the man coughed the rest of the smoke from his lungs, the elixir of life no doubt already purging his system of any harmful, long-lasting chemicals.
“You know, Nicolas asked the exact same thing. To be honest, I’m more worried that nothing is going to happen, and I’ll end up being high-strung for the entire thing for no reason.” He replied quietly, moving from the spider lilies as she guided him away. “Draco is going through something very difficult right now, and I don’t want to make it worse needlessly. I want him to have fun tomorrow.”
His self-admonishing thoughts were cut off abruptly as a hand suddenly closed around the collar of his shirt and yanked him upwards. Stumbling over his uncooperative legs, both of which seemed to have forgotten which foot went first, Barty fought to keep himself standing as he was forced to begin padding forward along a dark path.
“I suppose not.” He muttered, turning to stare back at the door as one of the locket’s teeth finally cracked against the cold iron, and it started banging its head against the floor again as an agonizing screech echoed through the library of his mind.
He clenched his hands into fists. How dare the entity attempt to control him! He was the great lord Voldemort, and if he was not then he was… he looked down at his hands, watching as the morning light struck what he now knew was the resurrection stone as it laid inside the golden ring band on his finger. The horcrux tilted his head, studying it for a moment, before letting an uncontrollable jolt of glee race through him.
That seemed to be enough to make Harry look up at him, disbelief splashed across his stupid, beautiful face. “Really? You...? A tree?”
The will to survive. It was something that Voldemort was deeply familiar with. Tom Riddle, however, the one who had only memories of the world outside of his son’s mind, was unfamiliar with such a concept. He had forfeited the will to live after making his decision so many years ago, and now saw such a need to be foolhardy. It was so… selfish. The idea of someone like him still believing themselves above the gods and above time, disgusted him. Tom had no illusions anymore. He didn’t deserve to hold onto the crown of immortality that he had not even inherited in the first place. Gripping onto it when he knew it was not his to have was a wasted effort.
people at Hogwarts, so being able to talk as loudly as they liked while stretching out as much as they liked was a welcome change. However, the bitterness in Tracey’s voice was hard for her to ignore, and Pansy felt like she never should have extended an invitation to come over in the first place. She should have known that Nigel would be so vile, especially considering how much his head had been inflating since being confirmed as the heir to the Parkinson lordship.
cradle my face like that and expect me to not think you were-you were going to… gah!” Draco slapped his hands back over his face, patting away the flames erupting there as they attempted to lick a line of heat up his cheeks. Harry reached forward again, forcing his own hands under Draco’s and soothing the heat as their skin began to sparkle and sizzle again. Draco reached up and clutched Harry’s wrists, muttering curses indistinctly as he tried to will the fire away.
And he did, for the most part. They rode the rest of the way in relative silence, punctuated only by Tracey popping her head into the compartment around three hours into the trip. She had given them all a severely weird look—which was, in all fairness, mostly pointed to Harry—before settling down besides Daphne and immediately engaging in a hushed conversation. Blaise didn’t bother to try and listen in, too focused on trying to occupy his mind and figure out just
Oh wow, this really has been a long time coming, hasn't it? I hope the contents of this chapter has somewhat made up for the long delay. This is the last chapter of summer break, and I hope it is also the last chapter that will take so long for me to write. Life has been chaotic, but it's slowing down now, and my inspiration for this story is returning, so things should be returning to normal in regards to the upload schedule soon.
