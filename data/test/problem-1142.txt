He has no idea how much time passes while they stay in this exact position. He’s ready to doze off when he hears someone scurrying around. Probably Madam Pomfrey. Good thing Malfoy closed the curtains. But…
Sighing deeply, Harry pats Ron’s forearm before lying back down on the bed. He hears Ron return to his own. Part of him wholeheartedly agrees with his best friend. Who actually slaps a blind person? Wait, not blind. Just… unable to open his eyes.
Afraid of what he’ll see next, Harry stays on his knees and only opens his eyes to slits, slowly taking in the new scene in front of him. He’s in the hospital wing, and he sees himself, sitting on his bed with his eyes closed, talking to Ginny. He’s laughing at something she said while she pats his hand. Harry arches an eyebrow, wondering why Draco is showing him this. His gaze flickers over to the Slytherin, who’s lying in his bed, scowling at the ceiling. Every now and then, he peeks over at Harry and Ginny, only to turn back to the ceiling, his expression turning more sour. He looks like he’s trying to make the ceiling collapse on them with sheer willpower. Harry still doesn’t understand how this trivial memory found its way into the vial when the scene suddenly changes.
As it turned out, there would be no need for that. Potter had indeed left Draco’s room. At least there was some sense left in that thick head of his.
Harry gulps when he hears Malfoy… do something behind him. Is he seriously taking off his clothes? Merlin!
He grunts, putting all his weight into bringing the axe down on the wood. This was an excellent idea. All this frustration needs an outlet. Desperately.
Slowly, he put down his bag and his coat, never taking his eyes off the dozens of candles lit in the living room. There was also soft music playing in the background, which was extremely out of the ordinary. Draco liked to work in silence. And he was always working.
“How would we do that?” Draco retorts, already feeling frustrated. He just wants to be alone. Well, that’s not completely true. But being around other people is just so exhausting.
“Hold on,” Potter said. Out of the corner of his eyes, Draco saw him prop himself up on one elbow. “Did he—Is… Is your father dead?”
Hermione, of course, has noticed the changes in him and even though Harry knows she means well, he really wishes she would stop talking.
Draco looked at the letter, feeling torn. Of course he wanted Potter to come by, but a part of him was still rattled by the events of the night before. The need for some space was growing bigger. But from the looks of it, Potter had no intention of giving him space. It was the most endearing and dreadful thing ever. Draco couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t think about anything else but Potter already. He needed some time to think. But… not seeing Potter was making his heart ache.
“Malfoy, are you okay?” Obviously, he’s not. He’s still panting and every now and then, his body gives a violent shiver. Unsure of what to do, and acting on impulse again, Harry reaches out until his fingers find Malfoy’s cheek. He gently puts his hand on the side of his face, his pulse picking up at the far too intimate gesture.
Draco forced himself to smirk. “Exactly. But it’s alright, we’ll just add ‘compassion for the dense’ to my growing list of outstanding traits.”
“Right, I’m the one being childish,” Malfoy says with a derisive smirk, but Harry can tell it’s just an act. “Are you trying to provoke me? So I’ll get kicked out and join my father?”
Damn, what should he do? He looks around and sees several empty vials on the little shelf to his right. He takes them and smashes them one by one. He doesn’t have to wait long before he hears distant footsteps and Madam Pomfrey grumbling angrily.
Harry hesitates, mentally cursing, as his courage seems to be washed down the drain. His face might be stoic, although he’s pretty sure it’s not, but… there are parts of him that will give him away; they will make it very clear he isn’t just taking off his clothes to take a shower. Merlin, maybe Malfoy will even think Harry is turned on by their fight. Either way, Harry realises, as he clutches his drenched bottoms, his… excitement is probably pretty obvious already.
He turns on his heels but freezes when he sees another person approaching him. A person who doesn’t even deign to look at him because his nose is buried in a book. Honestly, how much smarter does Malfoy think he can get?
When he gave no reaction, Draco turned his attention back to his potion. Maybe it was a little selfish to encourage Potter to go to Hogwarts. After all, Draco would be there come September. But was it really that bad, wanting to be around Potter?
“We’re trying to find something that can’t be seen.” Draco pauses. “Unless the centaur didn’t mean that literally.”
“There,” Harry said soothingly. “Sleep it off, okay?” He stroked Draco’s hair who nodded weakly before his eyelids fluttered shut.
For a moment, Draco thinks he’s going to leave. He doesn’t. He leans down and pulls Draco into a hug.
For weeks he wanted to at least catch a glimpse of them. Now, he wishes he hadn’t. Even though the curse is broken now, Harry doesn’t feel relieved. He knows these feelings for Draco won’t just go away.
Draco mentally scoffs. Of course he’s not going to die. Wizards don’t die from a fever. Still, seeing Potter like this is a bit… disconcerting. He sighs. This is ridiculous. He shouldn’t be doing this. He has other things to worry about. And yet, he can’t bring himself to pull away and go to his own bed. Instead, he lowers his head to the mattress and blinks in the darkness.
Draco seemed to ponder this for a moment before hesitantly opening his mouth and accepting the spoonful of porridge.
“Malfoy,” Harry says softly as he slowly gets off the floor. He reaches out to put his hand on the other boy’s cheek, but Malfoy stops him, grabbing his wrist.
Madam Pomfrey insists on Harry spending the night in the hospital wing, and after a visit by a very agitated Hermione and a grumbling Ron, Harry is more than ready to let his head fall onto the pillow and pass out.
“You’re not making any sense, Potter. Even less than usual,” Draco mumbles. Normally, Potter would have already fired back a retort, but it seems he’s too startled by what just happened. Whatever it was.
“What if you don’t come back?” Draco yells. “Who will annoy me all day? Who will drive me insane by talking in their sleep? Who will argue with me? Who will— Who will—”
Draco raises an eyebrow. It speaks volumes that Potter’s first instinct is to save others before he thinks about saving himself. That will never change, Draco supposes.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco groaned through gritted teeth. He hadn’t had a wank like this in years. It felt like he was a teenager again. His movements were so sloppy and fast, but he couldn’t have cared less. In his mind, Potter was kissing him, grinding on him, until he moved his head lower… and lower… and lower….
“Sooo…” He stretches out his hands, only to realise he has no idea what to do with them. He quickly puts them in his lap and purses his lips. He got what he wanted. Malfoy is right beside him. And now, he has no idea what to do.
He remembers the light in the infirmary bathroom is very dim. Still, it hurts. Everything is a blurry mess, no matter how hard he tries to focus. His eyes wander up to Malfoy’s face. He can’t quite make out his expression, but his eyes are wide, and his mouth is hanging open.
“You’re probably going to think I’m crazy.” Potter covered his eyes with his hands. Was he embarrassed? “The thing is… nobody held me like that before. Ever. Well, I guess my mum did, but…” He left the sentence unfinished and his sadness was almost tangible. “I could—I could almost feel—I mean, it felt like—like you cared about me.”
“Um… Are your hands always this cold?” he asks stupidly. Malfoy answers by wiggling his index finger twice in his grasp and Harry feels more heat rushing to his cheeks.
“You’re friends with him now, which means he’ll hang out with you and that,” he points his fork at Harry, “means we will have to hang out with him as well.”
“No, Draco, I mean it. I love you. I want to be with you. Ever since you came back into my life, I’ve had these feelings I’ve never had before. You changed everything. For the better. And I hope you will do so in the future. And I hope you’ll let me try to do the same for you.”
“You didn’t take my advice,” Malfoy says, hugging his knees. “You aren’t back together with the She-Weasel,” he adds when Harry just looks at him.
Frowning, Harry opens the trunk. There’s not only one article in there, more like a hundred. There’s also lots of pictures of him, a stuffed teddy bear that has a lightning scar stitched on its forehead, some old quills and… is that a Remembrall? And is that a Gryffindor scarf? Harry remembers, he lost a scarf in fourth year, but… that can’t possibly be this scarf, can it? Except… there’s an old shirt Harry has been looking for for ages.
“Yeah… I just… I just wanted to get my mind off things. I can’t remember what I was watching… There was something about… plants… and animals. Maybe there was even something about koalas. I have no idea.” Potter looked down at the floor, his shoulders slumped. “I don’t really remember anything after that. But I do remember you.”
“I should have known you wouldn’t remember those kind of things. Well, I guess it’s a bit childish to celebrate a six month anniversary. It’s not even the longest relationship we’ve both had. But I swear to Merlin, if we ever get married and you forget our anniversary, I will kill you.”
“I have to go now.” Potter brushes his fingers through Draco’s hair before he turns around and walks away.
“Potter,” he called, startling the witch beside him. Potter’s eyes instantly found his, a mixture of confusion and excitement in them. Fuck, why did he have to look at Draco like that? “Come here, come on, we need to go. Now!” He stretched out his arm to make room for Potter to walk through, not giving a damn about being scowled at.
“We c—c—can’t,” Draco snaps. “They s—s—sealed the entrance, you d—dimwit. We w—w—watched them d—do it.”
But Harry doesn’t. He keeps bobbing his head, trying to ignore the burning in his cheeks. With a silent ‘pop’ Malfoy’s cock suddenly disappears from Harry’s mouth. The hand in his hair tightens and then he feels something warm and sticky oozing down his chest. Perplexed, Harry brings his fingers up and touches it.
When Harry had woken up on the morning of December 7th, he had begun his day as usual. He had hopped in the shower, had eaten his breakfast and had hurried to work. It had been a day like any other. Ordinary. Pretty dull, actually. That was until he had opened the door to Grimmauld Place…
“Well, the Ministry made it pretty clear that’s what they thought of me. Even after I officially became an Auror, they still made sure I knew they didn’t trust me.”
Harry snorts, sitting down in his chair and pulling Draco onto his lap. He’s still such a lightweight, but, Harry notices with a grin, he’s put on a few extra pounds in the last few weeks. Probably from all the cake testing. Harry nuzzles into his neck and smiles when Draco places a kiss on his hair.
“Only for you,” Harry murmurs back as he pulls Draco in an embrace and buries his face in the crook of his neck.
Wincing, Draco propped himself up on his elbows, glaring at the koala. “Did you seriously just headbutt me in the chest?”
“Draco, I’m sorry. I’m such an idiot. But… you do know I’m happy with you, right? I mean, I was completely overwhelmed when you told me we had been dating for the last six months, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. And I realised it’s what I wanted all along.”
Draco tried to stifle the laugh that was threatening to leave his throat. “Be grateful it didn’t do worse,” he said, trying to keep his face impassive.
Harry scowls at him, even though he does feel sorry for the little creature. She definitely didn’t seem to enjoy flying very much.
Draco slammed a fist against the mattress. How could Potter do this? How could he just throw everything away?
Harry stares at him, a million thoughts racing through his mind. Harry had been stressing about this for days; why Draco had taken care of him, why he had let Harry hold his hand that night. Now that he sees the way Draco is looking at him, it’s like Harry’s whole world is shifting.
“I don’t know why you keep torturing yourself like this,” Draco murmurs quietly. “We should throw that memory away.”
“The moment you’re withholding something and don’t lay everything on the line, it doesn’t matter that we both agree to it. We’re agreeing to different things.” He brushes a few strands of hair out of Draco’s face. “Look, I understand why you didn’t trust me before, but… do you trust me now?”
He had noticed Potter vanishing more often than usual in the last couple of days. Most of the time he was with Teddy, so Draco hadn’t thought much of it at first. But when he had found the child playing in his room alone, panic had washed over him.
Draco tries to relax, to grant Potter entrance. He feels more pressure, more pain. He lets his head dangle upside down and squeezes his eyes shut. It burns.
A property Pansy hadn’t shut up about during her brief fling with Backford. Maybe Draco should have seen this coming after all. Backford treats his dates like trophies rather than people. He probably pissed himself at the prospect of having Harry Potter as another notch in his belt. How dare he treat Potter with so little respect. Draco will teach him a lesson.
“Tosser,” Malfoy snorts. His face turns serious again as he gazes into the fire. “Isn’t it weird, though? Being all alone out here?”
His heart starts beating frantically as he sees Draco rise from one of the armchairs. His mother steps aside, making room for him. Avoiding Draco’s gaze becomes impossible as soon as Harry gets a glimpse of the pale grey eyes that haunt his dreams. He doesn’t dare to blink as Draco studies his face.
“Oh, sorry.” Ginny leans in. “Ron and Hermione are holding hands, and I think Ron is about to implode,” she whispers. Harry laughs and immediately wonders if Ginny will take his hand as well. She does. Curiously enough, he finds that holding hands with her isn’t as thrilling as he had assumed. It’s almost like… holding Hermione’s hand.
“It does,” Draco said through gritted teeth. “It would be much easier if you could be… a little more decisive.” Draco really didn’t want to have this conversation. He was pretty sure he’d just end up humiliating himself. And maybe, it would even mean the end of his friendship with Potter.
Is it pity? Harry’s not sure. But he knows for a fact that Malfoy doesn’t have enough friends. Parkinson seems to be the only one who still hangs around him. Most of the time, though, Malfoy seems to be on his own. Harry checks the Marauder’s Map regularly, chastising himself each time, wondering why he cares so much, but feeling a strange kind of sadness while he stares at the dot labelled ‘Draco Malfoy’, sitting alone at the edge of the Great Lake. Maybe it is pity. Harry can’t help but feel sorry for him. The war changed his views on many things. A year ago, he didn’t understand Malfoy’s actions and his motivations at all. Now, he can’t help but think that Malfoy really got the short end of the stick in every possible way. What would Harry have done if the roles had been reversed? What would he do to bring back all the people he lost if it were possible?
“Huh. I could have sworn…” Malfoy leaves his sentence unfinished and rests his chin on his knees. Maybe it’s the early morning hour, but he forgets to sneer.
Draco stares at him. What is he doing? Is he— Does he still have a fever? Is he still in some kind of delirium? Draco has no clue what to make of it. Did Potter just try to take his hand?
After they got everyone back to the castle, Potter drifted back into unconsciousness. He’s been out for three days. So as relieved as Draco is to finally see him awake, the dread that crashes down on him cancels out everything else.
“Potter, we’re not friends, we’re certainly not lovers. Why do you have to make this harder than it already is?”
Harry’s eyes search his face and he can see something, something resembling fear. He tries to ignore the drumming of his pulse in his ears and takes a deep breath.
Harry is a dense oaf, but he won’t be able to tell him. It’s reassuring enough for Harry to take a deep breath, and blurt out the first thing that comes to his mind.
“Poor choice of words. Potter knows what I mean. Alright then. See you around. Granger.” Draco nods at her before he flees the scene, but not without overhearing Granger bombarding Potter with questions about what the hell is going on.
Oh, Merlin! Not that again! Draco inwardly groaned. His mind was such a traitor sometimes. Actually, lately, it was all the time.
Draco stared at him, his heart swelling in his chest. Could he really believe him? Was he being sincere?
“Merlin, yes,” Potter breathed, his hands darting down to unbutton Draco’s trousers. It only took a few seconds until his hand was shoved inside Draco’s pants and his hand was wrapped around Draco’s cock.
is why I’m in love with you.” He let his hand wander down Potter’s neck before he pressed his palm against his chest. “And this.” If Draco hadn’t been so nervous himself, he would have relished the fact Potter was speechless yet again. “And all this,” he trailed his fingers down to Potter’s hips, which he grabbed with both hands to pull him flush against him, “is what makes me want you. Very, very much.” Potter made a choking sound when Draco gave his bum a hearty squeeze.
Unsure of what to do next, he slightly leans forward, so his forehead rests against Malfoy’s. This might be too intimate a gesture, but Harry’s brain seems to be too foggy to register. He relishes the feeling of Malfoy’s soft skin against his, the warm drizzling of the water somehow intensifying it. The urge to let his hands roam becomes more powerful with every second, until Harry can’t keep it to himself anymore.
Malfoy drags his teeth across his lower lip, looking at Harry as though he can see everything right down to his soul; maybe he can. Maybe that’s why Harry doesn’t need to say anything and there still seems to be this unspoken understanding between them that they want each other and right now, in this moment, that’s absolutely fine.
“At least now we know I’m not a homophobic prick.” Harry feels him shudder as he gently sucks on his bottom lip. “Oh, by the way, I made muffins for you.”
“This isn’t exactly easy for me either,” he said, pressing himself closer to Draco. “I know I feel… something for you. But I don’t know what it is yet.”
“You… approve of my lips?” He stiffens again when he feels a warm gush of air on his face. Was that a laugh? A sigh?
Harry says nothing and sits back down, suddenly feeling a bit queasy. He has been imposing himself on Malfoy, hasn’t he? That’s so weird. The second he realises he’s not wanted, he usually immediately backs away. He’s had enough experience with that after all. But all the experience in the world doesn’t seem to help when it comes to Malfoy; nothing makes sense and everything is a mess.
Potter shook hands with a few people, thanked them over and over again, and even apologised, before he threw Draco a grateful look as they hurried down Diagon Alley.
he doing on the floor? And wait, why is Madam Pomfrey’s voice coming from way over there when she’s right next to Harry?
“Here, you can take this one,” Draco announced, pointing to the only mug left in the cabinet. “I don’t care much for that one anyway.”
“You’re not saying what I think you’re saying, right?” Potter seems calm. Too calm. It’s more menacing than if he were screaming at him. “Draco.” His eyes pierce Draco, rooting him to the spot.
After what feels like minutes, Malfoy finally moves, the chair screeching against the wooden floor. He walks over to the bed, his movements rather stiff, with Harry on his heels. He reaches into his robes and produces his wand, mumbling a spell to transfigure his clothes. Harry rolls his eyes at the green silk pyjamas. Malfoy gives him an expectant look and Harry reluctantly sets down the Niffler on his bedside table. He summons one of his fluffiest towels and arranges it into a little nest.
“Good.” Potter nods. “I sent Robards an owl. I said he should send one back if anyone has an idea what we’re dealing with here.”
Draco could feel beads of sweat forming on the back of his neck. “Oh, Potter,” he said with a dramatic sigh. “Not everyone is keen on rushing into the spotlight as you are.”
When he comes home that night, he pauses after shutting the door. He cocks his ears, slowly leaning to his left. There are voices coming from Malfoy’s room. Voices, as in Malfoy isn’t alone in there. Well, it’s not like he isn’t allowed to have people over.
Like always, Malfoy’s eye-roll is very clear in Harry’s mind’s eye. This guessing game might be silly, but Harry decided it’s probably better to stay on the lighter side of things for the moment. There are enough things keeping him awake at night.
Potter leaned back against the headboard and closed his eyes. “Honestly?” he muttered. “There’s nothing in my life that’s—”
Harry has no explanation as to why he’s reacting like this. He shouldn’t feel this gutted. But he does.
When he hears the Slytherin pant and gasp one night, Harry finds himself at war with his conscience. Whatever Malfoy is dreaming about, he probably deserves it. He’s not a good person, and he’s not worth—
Draco gives him a lopsided grin, even though disappointment bubbles up inside his chest. Potter was supposed to grab him and kiss him, not cower in the corner like a scared animal. Why is this so hard? Why is Potter making it so damn hard?
It was almost frightening and strange, how liberated Draco felt after sharing. It usually didn’t feel like this. Was Draco’s mind playing tricks on him? Was it suggesting he could trust Potter, just because he had inadvertently shared his deepest secrets with him while he had been a koala? Or was it more than that? Potter had said before he could relate to how Draco felt, and Draco had come to a similar realisation. What was going on?
“He belonged to my godfather,” Potter continues. “Sirius.” He gives Kreacher a strange look before his eyes meet Draco’s. “Sirius Black.”
“About time, Potter,” Draco smirks. “I was beginning to think you haven’t learned any manners after all.”
His entire body hums with pleasure. He lifts his leg and wraps it around the other boy’s waist, pushing their hips together. Malfoy arches his back and Harry feels how much he wants him. He forces himself to take his time every now and then, putting emphasis on gentle touches and slowing down as they grind their hips together. Malfoy seems happy to comply, adapting to the rhythm Harry is setting.
“You don’t get it,” Draco says, wringing his hands. “It’s not an excuse. And that’s not what I’m saying. I— I’m giving you an out.”
“See you later,” he says and hurries away. He’s pretty sure he’ll get plenty of chances to embarrass himself some more tonight. But up until now, Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind. He doesn’t seem to mind at all!
“No, I’m just full of surprises,” Harry retorted, rubbing their cheeks together. He loved doing that. Draco always acted as though it annoyed him, but it always made him laugh, just like it did then. He pulled Harry into another kiss that made his heart stutter.
“I don’t care,” Draco whispered, closing the gap between their lips again. Harry made a pleased humming sound while his hands wandered to the small of Draco’s back.
“First things first.” Dean rummages inside his bag. “Read this.” He shoves a book at Malfoy; a book Harry immediately recognises. The story of the Prince and the Knight. Oh god.
It’s frustrating, being trapped in the stupid hospital wing. He can’t move things forward with Ginny, he can’t help Dumbledore… he can’t do anything for Merlin’s sake! He made a bloody mess for himself. No, not just for himself. He dragged Ron down with him. And as relieved as Harry is that Malfoy is incapacitated, he still can’t shake the feeling of guilt that bubbles up inside him every time Madam Pomfrey checks on Malfoy’s wounds and comments on them. Apparently they’re mostly healed, but now Madam Pomfrey worries about the scarring.
By the time of his last two lessons of the day, Harry is in full panic mode. What the fuck is he supposed to do now? He enters the Potions classroom, hating his past self for partnering up with Malfoy; everyone else is already at their desks and there’s only one seat left. Of course. Of fucking course.
“Yeah.” Potter cocks his head. “It did attack Ron, Hermione and me in third year, but it didn’t feed on us.” He shrugs. “I honestly have no idea. But I hope Dumbledore does.”
Harry has no idea how much more time has passed when he suddenly hears the door open behind him. His head whips around and he almost falls off the sofa.
Is that why Dumbledore hadn’t wanted Harry to know that Draco apparently changed sides? That he’s had feelings for Harry for much longer than he assumed? Had Dumbledore really denied him all this information, consequently preventing Harry from being happy, even for just a fraction of time, so it would be easier for him to accept his death sentence? And now what? Should he feel grateful for that? Did Dumbledore really think so little of him? Did Dumbledore think he was that weak? That Harry would choose his own happiness over the happiness of all the people he’d be saving?
“Are you—Ah! Are you getting sentimental on me, Potter?” Draco smirks. “You probably—Oh fuck! You—Ah!—You’d probably say anything right about now and—Ah!”
Out of the corner of his eyes, he glanced at said flatmate. It had been a long time since he had thought of him as ‘Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived’. To him, he was just Harry now. No more ‘Golden Boy’ or ‘The Chosen One’. Just Harry.
weak. His gaze wanders back to Potter, who radiates so much confidence and authority, despite his very obvious confusion. Draco hates him for it.
“Are you just using me for pleasure?” he grumbles. “If you just want to— Ugh, maybe you should go and find somebody else. Don’t do it with me. Don’t—” He breaks off, biting his tongue. He said too much already. He doesn’t want Malfoy to know how vulnerable he feels. He probably failed miserably.
Draco knew he was blushing, and mentally swore. The embarrassment from last night hadn’t even worn off yet. Leave it to Potter to add a little extra, just in case.
“Malfoy?” Nothing. Harry feels disappointment bubbling up inside him. It was probably wishful thinking that he and Malfoy could get along for even a few minutes. He lowers his head and considers pulling away. Before he can decide, he feels it, on the back of his hand. Two taps. Harry grins in spite of himself.
Malfoy’s hand slowly slides down from his mouth and Harry finally realises he hasn’t said anything else.
Draco’s mouth opened involuntarily. Breathing was already hard with Potter standing so close to him.
He tries to mask his uncertainty with a frown as he moves closer to him on the sofa in the common room. Heat blooms on his cheeks as his fingers make contact with warm skin. Even more so when a blanket is thrown over his legs and his hand is delicately caressed beneath it.
“Save me?” he snorts. “You and your enormous hero complex might not understand this, but not everybody wants to be saved.”
Beneath the headline was a picture of Potter in a café, eating treacle tart. All of the magazines had pictures of Potter that seemed to catch him in a rather unflattering light.
“Don’t get too excited. Trees are a pretty extensive topic to research. But it was actually quite fascinating. Did you know that wizards used to believe trees are sacred?”
to think about Potter. More than once, however, he caught himself peeking out the window, for any sign of the owl returning. After an hour, he gave up. He slammed the book shut and started pacing the room. Who did Potter think he was? Did he really think Draco would just answer to his beck and call?
“Give me your feet,” Harry repeated. He patted his lap and gave Draco an expectant look. Slowly, Draco stretched out his feet. He wasn’t sure how he felt about this. He didn’t like people touching his feet. Not many had done so, but he just knew he didn’t like it. As soon as his heels touched Harry’s thighs, Harry put the blanket over them again, slipping his hands underneath. He started rubbing Draco’s ankles, much to Draco’s surprise. Huh. That didn’t feel so bad. Actually…
As if Potter had just read his mind, he asked, “If I take off your trousers, will you destroy my whole bedroom?”
“He was following me,” the Grey Lady says. “I was trying to escape.” She gives Potter a strange look. “
“Thanks,” Potter mumbles as he flings himself onto the sofa in his office. He looks terrible, and Draco couldn’t feel better about it.
“Hmmm, I like your voice like this. Low and husky,” Potter breathed. Draco bit back another moan, huffing when Potter sniggered.
He catches his eye across the hall and pauses. Something is different. There’s no venom, no glee, no… anything. He looks deflated, resigned, as though just sitting there is too much of an effort.
While Draco has no idea what the wizard is talking about, Dumbledore’s eyes widen. Without another word, he vanishes from the frame, as does the other wizard. Draco is all alone again. Good. He’d rather be alone. He’ll probably be alone for the rest of his life.
“Yeah, but only because we bumped into each other.” Potter gave him a speculative glance. “Are you anti-social in general or didn’t you want to get drinks with me specifically?”
“Well, our families weren’t exactly enemies but I have often wondered what would have happened if my father hadn’t- if it weren’t for my father…maybe it wouldn’t have been impossible. Or forbidden.”
Draco’s eyes involuntarily snapped up to Potter’s. They were soft and warm, not at all what he had expected.
“It’s a maxim. ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil’. There are different interpretations of it, though.”
Draco is avoiding him. And he’s not even doing a good job at hiding it. Yesterday, when Harry was walking through the corridors, his eyes fixed on the Marauder’s Map, he saw the little dot, labeled ‘Draco Malfoy’, approaching him. But when he looked up, he only saw the back of his head, hurrying into the opposite direction.
“Sure, that’s the only reason,” Blaise snorted. His eyes wandered over to Harry, scrutinising him. “I really have no idea how you put up with him.”
“Apparently,” Pansy said, ignoring Potter’s outburst, “he’s an Auror. They used to train together, and now Potter owes him a favour.”
“There’s nothing we can do about it now,” Harry sighs and leans back in his chair. His tea has gone cold and the biscuits have never looked less appealing.
Draco’s head shoots up when he hears a strangled cough, his pulse inadvertently quickening. He sees Potter’s hand move to cover his mouth.
most uncomfortable, but uncomfortable enough. Because he didn’t dare move a muscle in his body. He stayed completely rigid, afraid of making Harry realise Draco was basically sitting in his lap. But he had to move sometime.
Draco blinks at him. “That’s one way of putting it.” He grabs his wand and vanishes the mess in his pants, moving as quietly as possible as he lies back down. The atmosphere in the room is tense, brimming with unspoken questions, confusion and shame.
Questioning his sanity, Draco tugs at his robes with shaking fingers. It takes much longer than usual until he’s stripped down to his pants, his entire body trembling and stinging.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Potter mutters, crossing his arms. That conceited arsehole. “And by the way, I wanted you as much as you wanted me.”
“This morning,” Draco exclaimed indignantly. “If anything, I smell too good for his crude nose. When was the last time he had a shower? Hmm?”
Harry’s pulse quickens when he sees Draco slipping out of bed and getting changed into his robes. Will Draco show him where he went that night? Harry had been wondering about that, aside from worrying about him. Surely enough, the memory doesn’t dissolve as Draco hurries through the corridors, Harry at his heels. He seems to wander around aimlessly, turning left and right at random until they reach a very familiar corridor on the seventh floor.
“Guys, I really think he’s up to- What is that?” Harry exclaims. Ron looks over his shoulder and snickers.
“Ah, the question of all questions. Can true happiness be achieved, or is it merely an illusion of our minds?”
Today was another long and hard day. Draco isn’t exactly in a bad mood, but it could be better. When he steps into the living room, he knits his brows together on purpose, though. This is another thing Draco would never admit out loud, but this isn’t the first time he acts a little more grumpy than he actually is, to get more flowers. Merlin, is Draco Malfoy turning soft?
He starts running as fast as his wobbly legs can carry him, mentally pleading that he won’t be there too late. He almost trips a couple of times, but his mind is so fixated on getting to Potter, it doesn’t really register. He stumbles down the hill, his heart almost leaping out of his chest when he finally sees the Whomping Willow. And Potter.
“Well, you have no right to be so bloody attractive all the time,” Potter retorted, and leaned closer.
Potter shrugged. “When was I supposed to? I was a little busy, trying to stay alive. And I guess between then and now… Oh Merlin!” Potter’s face twisted in horror. “Do you—Do you think it counts… you know, as a koala?”
Draco just stared at her, still not completely convinced he wasn’t actually dreaming. He jumped when he heard a squeak coming from his lap. Oh, right. For a moment, he had completely forgotten about the koala. His mouth opened in horror, however, when he realised it was climbing onto McGonagall’s desk.
Draco nodded. He watched as Luna approached him, a warm smile on her face. She pulled him into a tight hug and patted his back.
This hasn’t happened before, so he’s not sure what to do. There’s no way in hell he’s going to wake somebody to accompany him to the loo. It’s awful enough he has to rely on other people to help him with everyday stuff, but he won’t make it even more obvious how unskilled he is on his own. No, he can do this. He’ll show everyone that he’s perfectly capable.
Draco couldn’t tell if Potter was displeased or not. At least he had only found out part of the truth.
“Oh fuck, Draco! Draco! Draco!” Potter thrust into him one more time, pushing his hips upwards, before he writhed beneath him, his cock throbbing inside Draco. “Holy shit,” Potter groaned, tossing an arm over his eyes. His chest was heaving. Draco slowly lifted his hips to release Potter before he collapsed on top of him and buried his face in the crook of Potter’s neck. They stayed like this in silence for several minutes until Potter squirmed.
Warmth rushes to Harry’s face when he realises he has been stroking Malfoy’s cheek absentmindedly. He clears his throat and lets his hand drop to his side.
“He’ll be right back,” Harry sighs. He takes off his glasses and rubs at his eyes, wishing this day was already over.
It’s not like Harry is asking for much. He knows it’s not a good idea for Malfoy to spend the night in his bed. All hell would break loose in the morning as soon as someone would discover them, cuddled up together. Still, he can’t help that he’s feeling hurt. It’s been almost a week now and Harry finds himself exhausted and edgy. When he feels the familiar dip in the mattress one night, he turns away. He feels Malfoy’s hand on his shoulder, immediately sparking something in Harry’s chest. But he resists the urge to turn around and grab his hips. He just can’t do this anymore. He knows it will ruin… whatever is going on between them. Confronting Malfoy will very likely put an end to this. For good. But as much as Harry wants him, he doesn’t want him like this.
When Draco hears what Dumbledore says next, he stiffens. It’s almost as if Dumbledore is talking to him. As if Dumbledore has read his mind.
“Malfoy,” Potter repeats. Draco feels a new surge of anger course through him. He wants to hit Potter. Hexing him wouldn’t be gratifying enough. He wants to physically injure him with his hands, his whole body.
“Oh Merlin, you can’t be serious,” Weasley groans. “I should have known.” He gives Potter a meaningful glance. “I’m going to the loo. And when I come back, this—whatever this is—better be over.”
Before Harry knows what he’s doing, he wraps his hand around Malfoy’s neck and pulls him forward. Malfoy’s lips feel exactly like he remembers, warm, soft and weirdly comforting. Once again, it feels like something clicked into place, something Harry hadn’t been able to put his finger on.
“Damn right I am,” Draco fumed. “Are you seriously telling me, I was only under the impression we’ve been dating for the last six months? Are you seriously telling me, you had no idea what was going on?” He took a deep breath, which didn’t calm him in the least. “ARE YOU SERIOUSLY TELLING ME YOU’RE THAT STUPID?”
“Did you draw the curtains of your bed as well?” Harry asks, a grin forming on his face. Malfoy taps his hand twice and Harry’s grin widens.
What exactly were the teachers thinking when they put them in adjacent beds? They nearly killed each other.
Careful not to let it drip onto the mattress, Draco moves his hand down to Potter’s arse again and dips his finger into his cleft. Oh, it’s so much easier to move it now, to draw circles around Potter’s rim and let his finger slide over it. He feels the heels of Potter’s feet digging into his back; it prompts him to press harder.
“Oh, right. I forgot about that. I’ll take a quick shower then.” He placed a quick kiss on the tip of Harry’s nose and started taking off his clothes as he walked. When he glanced over his shoulder, he saw his boyfriend watching him, his cheeks flaming up. Draco gave him a dramatic wink before he hurried into the bathroom.
“Baxter,” the keeper sighed in exasperation. “What is going on with you?” She put both hands on one paw and tried to pry it loose. The second she somewhat succeeded, the koala opened its mouth and screamed blue murder.
Draco thought he probably already had enough at this point, but something about Potter’s expression made him agree with a nod. He was smiling… almost shyly.
He tossed and turned, cursing under his breath. He was just about to get up and get himself a glass of water when he heard a hesitant knock on the door.
“You invented that curse?” McGonagall echoes. “That vicious curse? Severus!” Her tone shifts from dumbstruck to accusatory. “What in the name of Merlin were you thinking? And how did Potter even learn that spell?”
Yeah. Maybe trying to be civil with Malfoy wasn't the best idea after all. Maybe he should have just gone back to the castle with Ginny. That definitely would have been the smarter decision. Not to mention that Ginny will probably hound him later to explain what that had been about. That’s not a conversation he’s looking forward to. He’d rather listen to more stories about how his mates think he’s a lovesick fool, who makes the girl he fancies Captain of their team.
“Do I look like a girl, Potter?” he grumbles through gritted teeth. Why would Harry get him flowers? Harry doesn’t reply. Instead, Draco feels his arms wrap around his waist from behind. When Harry starts nuzzling his hair, Draco sighs and puts one of his hands on Harry’s.
He sits back on his heels, not knowing what to do about the emptiness he feels in his chest. He blinks away the tears that are threatening to brim over. So this is it. He doesn’t dare to hope. He can’t let himself hope. It will be so much more painful. He sinks down to the ground, not caring if his robes get dirty. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters anymore. Even if Potter were able to survive, would he be the same person? Would he be the person Draco unknowingly took into his heart? Honestly? It wouldn’t matter. Any version of Potter is better than no Potter.
Malfoy looks at him, his face unreadable. It makes Harry uncomfortable, but he tries his best to endure it. Instead of answering, however, Malfoy slowly gets up, and Harry gazes after him as he makes his way back to the castle. He wonders if Malfoy’s silence was a wordless agreement or yet another declination. He needs some time, Harry supposes. Everything is changing, and everyone needs their own pace to adapt to it.
“I see.” Something flickers across Malfoy’s face, but Harry has no idea what it means. “So am I supposed to be your rebound friend?”
At first, Draco thinks the curse has missed him. He doesn’t feel anything. He stumbles when something bounces off him. He watches the streaks of light chase each other through the room. He has never seen anything like it. And then, it happens. Pain, like he has never felt before, tears through him. It’s like his chest is being cut open by an invisible sword. He loses his balance, tumbles, until he’s struck by a violent force.
Draco frowned. He turned the letter over to find something attached to the back of it. It looked like an article from the Daily Prophet; today’s Daily Prophet, Draco realised as his eyes widened. There was a picture of him and Potter, talking animatedly. The caption read something about the highly successful charity gala and how Potter had helped with it blah blah blah. It was the same balderdash as always. He scanned the paragraphs for the words “Ex-Death Eater” but found they had simply called him “socialite Draco Malfoy”. He scrunched up his nose, not sure if he liked that new title. But, whatever, he was far more interested in the picture anyway. He didn’t remember that. Any of it. Potter started laughing, apparently at something Draco had said. It did weird things to his stomach.
“I am,” Potter says. “At least, from what Sirius told me, my great-grandmother was, which, I guess, makes me one, too. A little bit.”
“Alright, I think I’d better get going now,” Potter said, already rising from his seat. “Can I use your floo?”
“Oh?” Harry started grinning and tried to imitate Draco’s drawling tone. “So this is an affirmation of your endless affection for me?”
“What do you propose? Setting a house on fire so you can run into the burning building and play the hero as per usual?” He dips his quill into the ink bottle. “Or should I brew an illegal potion so you can arrest me?”
Feeling extremely wary but also exhausted, Harry scuffles into his room and slips under the covers. As expected, he doesn’t get a wink of sleep that night, tossing and turning instead, wondering what his former nemesis is doing in the other room.
Something’s rustling. Probably the curtain. Harry senses someone moving in front of him. And then he feels two taps on his hand.
Draco felt his lips stretch into a smile as he watched his flatmate approach, a bowl of popcorn in one hand and a blanket in the other. They were so in sync by now, they barely needed any words to know what the other needed. Draco took the bowl from Harry while he draped the blanket over the both of them.
Despite his mind’s chastisement, he feels his pants getting tighter as Malfoy moves his head in his lap.
“Alright, this isn’t working,” the keeper said, straightening herself. “I’m going to get some reinforcement.”
“YOU—” Draco tried to collect himself. He didn’t care for a scene right in the middle of a crowded pub. “You pretended to date someone else,” he hissed.
“I’m not on my own, there are a bunch of children waiting for me. And Stacey said she’d help me.” Beaming, she skipped into the classroom where the children welcomed her and the plush unicorn with ear piercing screams.
Malfoy’s head whips around to him. His lips are parted and there’s a strange gleam in his eyes. Their gazes lock and neither of them says anything for a few seconds. Harry’s breath catches in his throat, his pulse hammering against his collarbone.
“Err… yeah. I’m alright,” Potter says with a confused expression. He looks even more confused when she slightly leans in.
He slowly turns his head to gaze at the sleeping man beside him. Draco flinches as his heart gives another painful squeeze. He stretches out his hand and carefully buries his hand in the mop of black curls, relishing the softness. Harry makes a pleased sound in his sleep and his lips curl up ever so slightly. Draco presses his own lips into a tight line.
Potter doesn’t answer, but he finally stops pacing and stares out the window instead. Draco’s pulse quickens inevitably; does he really want to hear what Potter is about to say?
“Oh Merlin,” Draco groans. Before he can say anything else, Harry touches his cheek. Draco looks up, his eyes wide and unguarded.
“Yeah, well…” Potter shrugged. “Robards thought it might be a good idea for me to tag along. I wasn’t dying to get back in here but it was almost therapeutic, getting rid of all the dark magic that was still lingering in the corners, so to speak.”
“No, nothing,” Draco smiles while mentally slapping himself. He hates backing down, but how is he supposed to do this? He can’t just blurt it out like an idiot.
Draco cleared his throat. That wasn’t exactly a compliment. He wondered if that was the reason he often found himself unable to break any rules. And while Teddy keeping a koala in his room was definitely more than a bagatelle, his mother’s words echoed in his head like a taunt.
Draco almost jumped out of bed, yelping, when something sharp jabbed him in the back. And what the bloody hell was this awful noise?
“No,” he lied. He figured it wouldn’t do much good to pester Potter about his current situation, that Draco was indeed worried about him. As cheerful as he seemed now, Draco suspected it was only temporary; the darkness in him was probably still lurking right beneath the surface.
“She was far too understanding,” he whimpered. Unlike mother, he added in his head. He knew she wanted him to be happy and maybe she’d come around eventually, but there was no doubt she would be hurt. He could already picture the disappointment in her eyes. Draco hated that. But there had been no other way. He couldn’t go through with it.
“Fuck, yes! Yes! Yes!” Potter’s body jerks against Draco and he lets out one last moan that sounds so filthy, Draco wonders if he should bottle up the memory of it, so he can hear it again and again and again.
Driven by this new determination, he stomped over to Teddy’s room. The child was nowhere to be seen; he was probably downstairs for breakfast. Good. Draco didn’t want him to see this. The only person he needed for this was Potter.
“I know, I know.” Harry leans back and stares at the ceiling. “Let’s just hope it isn’t permanent. Maybe it will just go away.”
Malfoy says nothing for a moment and seems to be hugging his knees a little tighter. “Clever,” he murmurs quietly. “I’m probably going to regret saying this, but I’m so tired of fighting.”
Harry can feel himself blush as the pieces finally click together. Or do they? So Malfoy freaks out when Harry touches him. Unexpectedly. That only means he’s surprised. Right? Or…
Draco stared at him, his mouth hanging open. “Yeah, that’s— I mean, sure, if, um, if that’s… what you want.” Sweet Merlin, if he wasn’t careful, he would come right now, all over Potter’s face. Oh no, no, no, wrong image! WRONG IMAGE!
The two taps Harry feels on his back a few moments later send a sensation down to his crotch that leaves him breathless. He feels himself getting harder, if that’s even possible, and he doesn’t waste another second, now that he has Malfoy’s permission. While he makes a mental note to stay clear of the Slytherin’s left arm and his chest, his hands begin to move.
“Actually, that spell doesn’t work on ghosts. I suggested another one, but—” Slughorn breaks off when McGonagall shoots him a stern look. “Sorry,” he mutters.
He’s still laughing when he looks back at Malfoy, who is eyeing him curiously with an unreadable expression.
“Finally catching on, are you, Potter?” Malfoy wheezes. “This has got to be the best moment of my entire life.”
“Oh, Merlin, no,” Draco breathes. He looks at Kreacher and decides not to tell him about the Goblin wine. He’d probably stick his head in the oven if he knew what it did to Draco. “No wine. Thank you.”
At least Harry can take momentary gratification in the fact that he apparently took Malfoy by surprise if his quizzical expression is anything to go by.
His mind unhelpfully provides him with an image of Ron in Slytherin robes, a sneer on his face as he high-fives an equally sneering Malfoy. There are so many things wrong with that picture.
“Um…” Harry suddenly felt like throwing up again. He wanted to. He really, really wanted to, but this was all going very fast all of a sudden.
“That’s why I made you pancakes.” Potter seems completely unimpressed by the nauseated look on Draco’s face.
Something stirs in his chest as he swallows and the taste still lingers on his tongue. This is it. He wants this. He wants to wake up with Potter every morning and eat his heavenly pancakes. And… watch him poke around in his bowl of rice and… slurp that very strange-looking stew.
When Harry returned with a glass of water, Draco tried to act as normal as possible. Which wasn’t that easy to do, because
“Sweet Merlin, he certainly is more charismatic than he used to be, isn’t he?” Blaise said in an amused tone.
“Teddy?” he said, arching an eyebrow. “Oh!” Realisation slowly dawned on his face. “Oh man, he’ll be so disappointed I’m not a koala anymore.”
Ugh, unfortunately. Draco’s lips move without his permission. “Yes”, he breathes. He’s already imagining it.
Harry quickly took her other hand and cupped her cheek. “No, no, that’s not what we’re saying. At all!”
“I guess,” Ron says, even though he doesn’t sound convinced. “Want to go flying? I’m not really in the mood for homework.”
Potter wouldn’t. He wouldn’t dare. Ugh, of course he would. The nerve. So he called Weasley over to solve the case without Draco? Really? Well, Potter’s in for a ride, then. The fool should know Draco won’t be pushed aside that easily.
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Potter burst out. “Of course I—” He made an incoherent sound that made Draco’s heart skip a beat. “But, um, Draco, that’s— Are you sure?”
As much as it irritated Draco how clingy the koala became when it was time to go to sleep, it irritated him even more that the little beast completely ignored him during the day. He felt so… used. He knew it was irrational and stupid. He should be glad the koala left him alone most of the time. It would give him a chance to work on his potions. Only, he couldn’t exactly leave the koala alone… could he?
Harry bites his lip. He’s stunned by the unexpected queasiness washing over him. He can’t explain it. He can’t understand it. But he can’t help it. He just can’t help feeling sympathy for Malfoy. He must be so lonely.
“Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said, and they both turned around. She gave them a look Draco couldn’t read. Her eyes were sparkling and there was something about the curve of her mouth that looked completely out of place. Was it… amusement? “If I may speak freely one more time,” she said, raising her chin. “It’s about damn time, you stubborn, oblivious boys.”
“What’s wrong with this one?” Blaise asked, raising an eyebrow. Draco bit his lip, while cradling the mug like it was his most prized possession.
Over the ringing in his ears, and Moaning Myrtle’s screaming, Harry hears a loud whooshing sound and he feels his wand vibrating. He blinks and sees Malfoy stumbling. The curse seems to have hit him, but something is off. A light bounces off Malfoy’s chest, almost like a lightning bolt. It races through the room and Harry notices there’s another light. For a moment, it seems like they are dancing around each other.
Draco keeps walking and acts like he hasn’t heard Potter. Three days without saying a word. That’s definitely a new record for Draco.
“What?” Malfoy frowns and reaches up to brush his hands through his hair. His eyes widen when his fingertips touch the delicate looking petals on his head. “Potter,” he whispers; his quiet tone sends chills down Harry’s spine. He sounds positively murderous.
“I also think it would piss off a lot of people, which, frankly, is a very big plus,” Harry grinned.
He decides to test the water, rubbing his hand against the base of Potter’s cock. He moves his hands in circular motions, slowly creeping towards the tip. Potter groans when he reaches it.
“Spread your legs a little more,” Potter said. Draco groaned. He tried, but his trousers were in the way, trapping his legs. Potter seemed to notice and quickly helped Draco out of them. Legs spread wide and heart pounding in his chest, Draco waited for Potter’s next move. Warm hands were on his arse in an instant.
“I started studying with Luna. She’s a pretty good study partner. But, Merlin, the other night, we were in the library and she actually—”
Teddy beckoned Draco down to him. When he leaned closer, Teddy put his hand beside his mouth and whispered, as though he didn’t want the koala to hear.
Malfoy blinks at him but does end up summoning a book. He opens it wordlessly while Penny plays with his hair.
“Okay, Baxter, here we go,” Teddy said and tentatively detached the koala from his body. Heaving, he put the koala on the floor between them and turned it towards Draco. The little button eyes were blinking at him innocently. But Draco knew it was just an act.
Internally grumbling, Draco turns around and takes a peek at Potter. The cloth Madam Pomfrey had placed on his forehead hours ago has fallen onto the mattress. Draco tries to ignore the Gryffindor’s irregular breathing, as well as his intermittent moans. So what if the prat is in pain? It’s not Draco’s problem. And it most certainly isn’t his fault.
Harry snorts, more amused than annoyed, trying to hold on to Penny as she tries to get out of his grip.
That gesture seems to make her more uncomfortable. She pushes down her fringe, as though she’s trying to hide her eyes behind her blonde locks.
didn’t hurt me. But I think he’s hurting.” Teddy looked down at the koala, which was snuggled against his chest, and softly stroked its back.
Harry nods as he hears her walk away. He’s already getting drowsy and slowly sinks down on his pillow again, all thoughts of Malfoy and his confusing, irritating, calloused, but still kind of soft hand, almost forgotten. Almost.
“Look, I don’t care about your love life, just… keep it down, will you?” Feeling too hot and too irritated to look at Malfoy any longer, Harry jumps off the sofa and marches into his room. He flops onto his bed, blinking at the ceiling.
“You think I’m disgusting!” He pushed Potter away and hastily zipped up his trousers. “You just wanted a quick one-off. Of course! I’m not good enough for anything else!”
Draco felt, rather than heard, Potter’s sharp inhale. He wrapped his hand around the nape of Potter’s neck and searched his eyes for any remnant of doubt. But all he could see was wonder and curiosity.
“Oh my god.” Potter covers half of his face with his hand.  “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me. How could you not tell me?”
“Thanks for showing me,” Potter said. Draco made a non-committal sound. “I, um, I have a confession to make.”
“Well, so are you,” Draco said breathlessly, instead of defensively. Potter growled into his neck, his fingers curling around Draco’s cock as much as his trousers allowed.
“And in these moments, he feels… gleeful. I just can’t imagine how someone can feel like that while they’re— It makes me sick.”
“Nnngh!” Draco was sure something in him was exploding when he felt Potter’s hot tongue lick its way up his cock. Desperately, he grasped at the sheets as Potter swirled his tongue around his tip. He barely noticed Potter murmuring something before he realised his pants were gone; Potter had vanished them. Mere seconds later, his hand was wrapped around the base of Draco’s cock as he slowly sucked the head into his mouth. “AH!”
“I still don’t know about this. I’ve never heard of anything that feeds on emotions,” McGonagall says with a shudder.
He thought about telling the others about Malfoy a million times. He’s pretty sure Luna would understand and give Malfoy a chance. He can’t exactly say the same for Ginny. Maybe he’s being unfair. But it’s delicate, this thing they have between them. Whatever it is.
It’s strange, Harry thinks, that his body and his mind are technically in the same room now, even though the current headmaster’s office looks so different from the one he just stepped into.
Draco froze. Everything he had wanted to say suddenly evaporated like smoke in his mind. Jealous? Potter had wanted to make him jealous? Well, mission accomplished. But… why would—
Draco swallows, the back of his neck prickling uncomfortably as he squirms under the scrutiny of Potter’s eyes.
Harry silently agrees and leaves it at that. He just spotted Malfoy strutting across the Entrance Hall with Parkinson. Just the mere sight of him makes his blood boil.
“On the circumstances. For example, if you were sick, I’d definitely want to keep cooking for you. And after you finished eating we could go upstairs and I could hold you and warm you until you stopped shivering. We could take a hot bath together. I’d make you some tea, get your favourite biscuits and I could give you a massage if you feel like it. But since you’re not sick…” Harry peered at his boyfriend from under his lashes and held back a snicker.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat at those words. If only Potter knew. Draco doubted they shared one particular sentiment.
When he lifts his fork and holds it out to Draco, Draco’s eyes fall on the ring on Harry’s finger. His lips curl upwards and he finally leans forward and opens his mouth wide. The cake is indeed delicious. It’s velvety and melts pleasantly on his tongue.
Draco grunts, clutching at the sleeping bag and pulling it up to his chin. He realises too late that in doing so, he also pressed Potter’s arm harder against himself. And now their arms are touching. Fabulous.
“Oh god, oh god!” Potter convulses, his mouth torn open in a silent scream. Draco watches him as he slowly comes down from the high, his chest heaving.
He stops breathing when Potter pulls back a little and looks at him with terror in his eyes. Was he really that worried? He realises Potter’s thumb is moving against his shoulder blade, as though he’s stroking him. Draco searches Potter’s face, his hands itching to reach up and return his embrace.
Harry looks over his shoulder and squints. Something tells him he’s on the right track. It’s worth a shot.
“They are,” Draco says. “See?” He gestures to the four students lying in the beds at the far end of the room.
That night, Draco stays at the office much longer than he usually does. He just can’t seem to find the strength to get up. Potter doesn’t want to work with him anymore. And he didn’t even have the courtesy to tell Draco himself. What does he expect Draco to do now? To forget everything that happened? To avoid him and never talk to him again? Well, Draco decides, as he finally pushes himself out of his seat, that’s exactly what he’s going to do.
Ginny brushes it off with a laugh and pats his hand. “Don’t worry about it, Harry. It will be fine. We’ll still be able to win the match.”
Draco could see the unease in his eyes. He suspected Potter didn’t realise how much Luna knew, how she and the rest of his friends had put the pieces together; but he seemed to be contemplating the possibility they might have caught on. It obviously terrified him.
“So,” he says, as casually as he possibly can while lying in bed next to the boy he apparently has a massive crush on. “What did you and Luna talk about?”
Dumbledore turns to him. “This part of Harry’s soul has been separated from him for eight years. It weakened him.”
“You sound like Dumbledore,” Potter mutters. He reaches up and rubs his fingers against his forehead.
“Um, do you remember the first time we met? At Madam Malkin’s?” He doesn’t even know where he’s going with this. This probably isn’t the best topic either, but he has been thinking about that day a lot, lately. Before he can say something else, Malfoy taps his hand twice.
“I didn’t mean… I just meant the setting reminds me of-” He raised an eyebrow. “Are you saying you’d want me to be standing down there, serenading you?”
“Mr Malfoy, have you— Oh.” Madam Pomfrey pauses. “Well, I’m sure you’re feeling guilty about whatever you did to Mr Potter, but I’m already taking care of him. I’ll have another talk with the Headmaster about this. You’re lucky I was able to heal the wound on his head completely,” she sniffs. “I don’t know why you two were fighting again, but honestly, attacking a blind student in the middle of the night. Here, in
“Alright then, I’ll go back to the penguins,” the second keeper said. Before he turned to go, he gave Teddy a thumbs up. “Cool hair, kid.”
Ready to march over to the other boy’s bed and give him a piece of his mind, Harry starts getting up but pauses when he hears the familiar rustling of his curtains. Somebody is closing them. He waits, his heartbeat quickening. He feels his blanket being lifted and then… nothing. It’s kind of odd, Harry thinks, how he immediately associates silence and hesitation with Malfoy now. But even without being able to see him, Harry knows it’s him. The question is, what is he doing?
Maybe Draco should have stuck to his dreams. Yes, they couldn’t keep up with reality, but reality had the cruel tendency to choke off any kind of hope, even for someone who usually didn’t dare to hope at all.
Potter insists on staying until all five wizards are taken away. In turn, Draco insists they go to St Mungo’s to get that nasty wound on Potter’s head taken care of. Serves him right. Draco knows how much Potter hates going to the hospital.
Draco stares at him, feeling absolutely gobsmacked. Leave it to Potter and his boorishness to ruin everything.
“I—” Potter quietly cleared his throat. When he didn’t continue, Draco slowly lifted his head to look at him. “I can’t believe I just took your virginity.”
He inhales sharply as more memories attack him. Being sick in the bathroom and right before that, touching—
“Okay. So,” Harry says, putting his hands on his hips and only feeling mildly ridiculous about talking to Malfoy with his back turned to him. “I figured you must have felt pretty humiliated after, um, after we kissed. Even though it was just a misunderstanding.”
“You know,” he murmured, “you’re not so bad.” His breath caught in his throat, his body going rigid, when the koala lowered its head. It was now snuggled against the crook of Draco’s neck. “You really do like to cuddle, don’t you?” Draco laughed, making sure not to hug the koala too tightly. The last thing he needed were more scars on his body. Speaking of…
Accidentally seeing Malfoy becomes like a daily ritual for Harry. Honestly, he’s making it too easy. He comes here every afternoon, probably on his lunch break, orders a cup of tea, a panini and starts reading as soon as he sits down. He always crosses his legs the same way and his forehead creases as he concentrates on his book. Harry’s pulse quickens every time at the sight.
“Oh!” Potter nods. “That’s right. Yeah. Now that you mention it…” His brows furrow and he looks deep in thought.
Even Draco shuddered at her words. Merlin, did she know how scary she could be sometimes? She probably did.
to talk to Malfoy. He doesn’t know what the hell is wrong with him. Maybe that curse took more than just his eyesight.
“Different,” Harry echoes, confused. “Different—” Oh. “—how?” His eyes widen, and Malfoy gives him a sceptical look when his lips stretch into a grin. “Different, huh?”
“Why don’t you just wait for one of those waiters to come by? You’ll miss Potter if you go to the bar now,” Blaise said, without looking at Draco.
A wave of panic washes over him. Is he supposed to tell Potter? Because… what happens if he comes and his cock is still in Potter’s mouth?
“It’s personal,” Potter says in an appeasing tone. “It might be connected to the case, but… maybe it’s not. If it is, I’ll definitely discuss it with you later.”
“It was the only thing I could think of,” Ron says defensively. “You talked about that spell that morning and… I panicked!”
Draco knows this is wrong. He knows Potter is getting a glimpse of something, Draco has been trying to hide from everyone. He can’t show weakness. He just can’t.
Harry’s head whips around when he hears an explosion. He immediately throws himself on the ground. A moment later, a tangy smell penetrates his nostrils and he immediately covers his face with his sleeve. It’s pointless. He starts coughing violently, while trying not to inhale through his nose.
Pansy’s fruitcakes, Blaise’s ugly purple jumper, his mother’s stew, peacocks… peacocks, peacocks, peacocks…
Without a moment’s hesitation, he lifted his arm above his head and threw his wand with all his might. His heart hammered wildly against his chest as he watched Potter catch it mid-air.
“He said… um…” Potter shoots Draco a glance, silently asking him to help. Typical. The prick has the memory of a goldfish.
“I would feel better if we did,” McGonagall sighs, “but I don’t want to leave Hogwarts in the hands of the Ministry.” She glances in Draco’s and Potter’s direction. “No offence, gentlemen.”
“Ugh, I hate this,” he repeats, a little louder this time. “We should at least be allowed to go outside. I don’t know why Madam Pomfrey insists we stay in here. We’re basically trapped. I feel like I’m suffocating.”
“Yuck! I smell like you!” Shuddering, he quickly unbuttoned his shirt and slipped it off his shoulders. He let it fall to the floor and moved his hands to his trousers. As he worked open the zip, his eyes locked with the koala’s. It was staring at him, watching him.
He was touching Malfoy’s scars. Harry’s stomach rumbles and he feels like he’s going to throw up again. Does Madam Pomfrey think it’s Malfoy’s fault Harry got sick?
What had Malfoy done? Instinctively, Harry’s hands fly to his chest and start sweeping over his body. Huh. Everything is still there. As well as that bloody dizziness. And he can’t decide if he’s freezing or too hot.
“As if you wouldn’t if I said no,” Harry growled. He should have known Malfoy would be a bloody git about this. His gaze was getting more intense, making Harry shiver. “Yes, just ask your damn question.”
“I understand your reasoning, Draco,” Dumbledore says. “However, this loss highly affects the balance of Harry’s soul. No matter how much we may resent it, we all have darkness inside of us. And no matter how much we may try to fight it, it will not only always be a part of us, it is also crucial to our existence.”
Harry opens his mouth and Malfoy loses no time in slipping his tongue inside. Harry pushes back with his own, releasing an enormous swarm of butterflies inside his stomach. More than once, their teeth clash against each other; it only encourages Harry to yank harder at Malfoy’s hair, to brush his tongue more firmly against Malfoy’s, to step closer so there’s absolutely no room left between them.
Harry senses this is probably the point where he should stop talking. Unless Malfoy can tell him what’s going on, and why he doesn’t want Harry to apologise, he’ll just manoeuvre himself into a dead end.
Draco sees Potter’s hand twitch and immediately knows he isn’t happy about this. If it were up to him, they’d already have searched half the castle.
He lowers his head to Malfoy’s shoulder again and slowly presses the length of his body against him. No sparks this time. Hmmm. Maybe because he knew it was coming? Or—
Draco pauses when he hears… rustling. Behind a tree. Potter seems to have heard it as well. He points his wand in the direction of the noise, slowly stepping around Draco.
“Thanks for taking me out, Hermione,” Ron murmurs. He sounds sleepy. “And sorry for getting us kicked out. I just can’t get used to not hearing anything. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I almost miss you bossing me around.”
Indeed they had. Potter had practically forced Draco to talk to him after his trial, even though, or maybe especially because, he had refused to at first. Draco had felt too ashamed, too embarrassed, but also too angry to talk to Potter. It was just the icing on the cake that Potter, of all people, had been the one to save him. Again. And even though gratitude had been somewhere in the mix, it had mostly felt degrading.
Draco wakes with a start and blinks in the darkness, disoriented. It takes him a moment to realise he’s in his room, in his bed. The copy of ‘The Tales of Beedle the Bard’ is still in his hands. He tries to straighten himself but immediately goes rigid. He looks down, his eyes slowly focusing in the darkness. His pulse quickens inadvertently when he sees a mop of black hair resting in his lap. When did that happen? Oh, yeah, he noticed Potter edging closer while he was reading ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’. By the time they reached ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’, their shoulders were touching. And at some point, Potter’s head plopped down on Draco’s shoulder. Draco stopped reading, scolding his heart for nearly jumping out his chest.
Gripped by blind rage, Harry jumps out of his seat, intent on hunting Malfoy down to confront him. Before he can take even one step, however, he feels a strange pang in his chest, rippling through him like the Cruciatus curse. He faintly registers the murmurs of the other students as he doubles over and starts coughing and coughing, until it feels like his throat is being ripped open. And then, when he finally feels like he’s completely empty inside and every single muscle in his body is aching, he sees it. He sees the single black tulip that’s lying on the floor.
“You died for fuck’s sake,” Draco said, irritation flaring up in him. “You died to save all of our arses. You don’t owe anybody anything. If anything, the rest of the world owes you!”
“Um… I guess I’ve gotten used to sleeping in your bed,” Potter said sheepishly, scratching the back of his head.
“Tell me if you want me to stop,” Potter whispered, his gaze flicking down to Draco’s mouth. Merlin, why would he want him to stop? “Draco, do you want me to—”
“Oh yeah?” Potter interrupted him. “Then prove it! Go to Cho’s wedding with me tomorrow. Or are you too much of a wimp to—”
“It’s so unfair! I don’t even understand why McGonagall made us come back here if we aren’t even allowed to play Quidditch.”
“Um.” Potter shifts, straightening his legs, and Draco feels panic bubble up inside him. “Maybe—” He hesitates, searching Draco’s face. “Maybe we could help each other out.”
“I had dreams about you doing it to me. And it felt bloody amazing. That’s how I want to make you feel.”
Malfoy shifts in his seat and something changes in his posture. Harry wonders if he’s struck a nerve and shouldn’t have said that. His mind kicks into overdrive, scrambling for something else to say.
“Um, no,” Potter croaked. “But, given the circumstances, I, err, think it would be easier if you were the one to… err…”
Harry’s heart leaps into his mouth. Before he knows what’s happening, Malfoy gets out of his seat and puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Potter grubs the tip of his right shoe into the ground and keeps his head down. “I did what I was supposed to. I defeated Voldemort. Life goal accomplished.”
need him.” Draco looks Weasley dead in the eye, pretending his pride didn’t just take a massive hit.
Before Draco knew what was happening, Potter moved behind him, nibbling at the spot where his neck connected with his shoulder. Draco felt his hands on his waist, slowly moving upwards to his chest. A violent jolt shot through him when Potter applied more pressure to his hands, pulling Draco closer to him, while simultaneously pressing himself against Draco’s back. Fuck. He could feel Potter’s erection against his arse, hard and enticing. He let out a low moan, his desire for Potter, bottled-up for far too long, finally spilling over. He heard Potter inhale sharply.
He cocked his head to the side, deliberating his options. He could make Malfoy tell him. It wouldn’t exactly be fair play, but… it was Malfoy. And maybe, hearing the truth for once would finally clear the air. Yeah… probably not. But it was worth a try.
And that’s when Draco realises, the only way he can make his boyfriend truly happy, is by being happy himself.
The Lovegood’s home was such a peculiar place. Draco was surprised when he found out Luna still lived with her father. On the other hand, it made sense, since they were running the Quibbler together now.
If Potter hadn’t held him securely in his arms, Draco was sure he would have floated away. The press of Potter’s lips against his, the soft scrape of his beard against Draco’s skin, his intoxicating smell, the way his hands were digging into Draco’s back, trying to pull him closer still… Dreams really couldn’t keep up with reality.
“Did you catch a cold or something?” Potter asks while he shoves more eggs into his mouth. “Your face is all red.”
“Err, Professors,” he murmurs, “I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but I’d like to discuss something with Professor Dumbledore in private.”
Dumbledore looks at him intently over his half-moon spectacles. “That eight years ago, when you resisted the Killing Curse for a second time, you left a piece of yourself in the Forbidden Forest.”
He appreciates the way they both acknowledge this day, without really talking about it. They didn’t plan it. They don’t seem to need any words to know that this is perfect as it is.
Slowly, he pulled Potter to him, his heart giving a violent jolt when their lips brushed against each other. Potter made a noise that went straight to Draco’s groin. His hands flew up to tangle in Draco’s hair and his leg was suddenly wedged between Draco’s thighs, rubbing deliciously against his cock.
“Edward Remus Lupin,” Draco growled, to which Teddy gasped. He knew he was in trouble when Draco used his full name. “How—When—Did you steal that thing from the zoo?”
Ron doesn’t answer. From what Harry can see, his limbs are stretched from his body at a very strange angle, and he seems to be unconscious.
“Do you believe her?” Draco asks as they ascend the stairs, trying to ignore how sore he feels. “The Grey Lady, I mean.”
should probably embarrass him as well, but he can’t think about that, not when Malfoy is nestling himself up against him and takes his hand again.
Draco’s eyes snap to Potter’s and fix him with a glare. “I may think you’re an arrogant prick and an insufferable goody two-shoes, but that doesn’t affect my trust when it comes to your abilities.”
He sinks back to the ground and stares at the stars until he can’t feel his fingers anymore. The cold surrounding him matches the iciness in his heart. He can’t even bring himself to wonder how this could have turned out if he had done things differently, because he wouldn’t have. He’d always do the same thing. It’s just who he is; tricking people, to shield himself from pain. Well, that turned out splendid.
Draco glowers at him. “I swear to Merlin, Potter, if you have another one of your wet dreams, while you’re—”
Apparently, it didn’t matter he had already seen Potter wearing that bloody Muggle suit when they had picked it out together; it knocked the breath out of him nonetheless every time he glanced over at him.
“Oh!” Harry jumps and instinctively lets go of Malfoy’s hands when he sees white sparks explode in front of his eyes. “What was that?”
It really wasn’t Draco’s fault he stayed up night after night to watch Harry sleep like a total creep. The first time it had happened, Draco had been wakened by a soft whimper. Investigating it further, he had seen Harry all sweaty and thrashing in his bed. Draco had intended to wake him, but as soon as he had leaned down, Harry had grabbed him and had pulled him down.
What was Malfoy doing? The way he was touching him was so tender and affectionate. Harry wouldn’t have believed it was Malfoy if he hadn’t forced himself to stay awake to try and find out what Terry had been talking about. This was not what he had expected!
He realises he hasn’t thought about the horcruxes in a while. He and Dumbledore should be working on finding them right now. Instead, he’s sitting here, being completely useless. Has Dumbledore found anything new yet? Is he too preoccupied finding something to break the curse?
“What, Brian?” Malfoy sounds so nonchalant, it makes Harry grit his teeth. “We were just… working on something.”
Harry is suddenly very concerned about his palm getting sweaty. He can feel his heartbeat in it and wonders if Malfoy can, too. Just when Harry thought this day couldn’t get more embarrassing.
Draco inhales sharply. Oh. As foolish as it is, he wasn’t prepared for a no. He tries to take a step back, but Potter holds him in place.
“You know, now that I think about it, you haven’t had that many visitors since we have been brought here. None, to be exact.” Potter snorts. “I mean, your friends must have noticed that something rotten and nasty is missing from their midst. But maybe they don’t care enough to—”
“Shhhh.” He leaned closer, cradling Harry’s head. Harry had to admit, it felt nice. Really nice. He suddenly couldn’t stop thinking about the dream  (or rather the memory) of having someone (apparently Malfoy) in his arms.
Draco makes a face. “That’s not what I mean. It’s just… At that point, I didn’t understand how you weren’t disgusted by me.” Draco sounds like he still doesn’t understand.
There’s an ear-piercing crash and Harry instinctively moves to the left. What was that? Was that Malfoy? Smashing another glass?
Draco stares at him incredulously. He notices the crease between Potter’s eyebrows and knows he has no other choice. There’s no arguing with Potter with that stubborn crease in place.
“Insulting my intelligence and my ‘lack of brain cells’” he raises his hands to make air quotes, “is really getting old.”
The moment Draco tries to move, he lets out a whimper. Everything hurts. He tries to open his eyes, but the light is too harsh. He feels around with his hands. There’s nothing but pleasant softness. Oh, wait, there’s something else. It’s… soft as well. But different. And warm.
He tries to think of other things, welcomes every distraction, because he’s bored out of his mind, and feels like he’s going insane. Several people have visited him; Dean, Seamus, Neville, but they didn’t stay long. Harry got the impression they were feeling a bit uncomfortable, talking to someone who constantly kept their eyes closed. Ginny was the only one who stayed for almost an hour. But that was mostly due to the fact that Hermione had told her about his copy of ‘Advanced Potion Making’ and she started to scold him about it. At least Hermione managed to get rid of it. Apparently, she took it to the Room of Requirement.
Malfoy says nothing, but the silence that follows makes Harry think he agreed, and that Dumbledore is performing the spell on him now. He hears Dumbledore move to his other side, indicating he’s now doing the same to Ron, who is still asleep.
Teddy looked a little flustered, but he slowly leaned forward. He was chewing on his bottom lip, eyes narrowed, while Potter held completely still.
Potter looks down at the floor. “I do. It’s just so unfair. Remus had a child right before he died. And Sirius—” Pain flashes over Potter’s features. “I feel like I missed out on really getting to know him. I wish I could have gone and lived with him like he wanted me to in third year.”
Potter makes another noise that zings through Draco like a lightning flash. His eyes snap to Potter’s face and he immediately wishes he hadn’t looked. There’s that crease between Potter’s eyebrows again. Merlin, why is this crease so damn attractive?
“Why do you never do as you’re told?” Draco snapped and impulsively wrapped his arms around him. “It doesn’t matter if you’re human or a koala, you’re always such a pain in the arse!”
“I knew there was something wrong with me, but I thought it was just the way my life was going to be. Now I know that it doesn’t have to be like that. Maybe—Maybe I can—” He puts his hand on Draco’s cheek. “You startled me out of my numbness. You reminded me what it’s like to—to want to feel something again.”
“I’ve kept it from Robards for now. You probably have enough going on at the moment. I do hope you’re getting professional help though. And you’ll have to talk to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.” She gives him an uncertain smile before she hurries off.
“Not righ’ away,” Hagrid says. “In a couple o’ weeks.” He looks down at the parchment, his eyes softening. “Olymp is busy righ’ now. But she says she misses me.”
“Your finger just twitched, I saw it,” he says, pointing at the Slytherin’s hand. “You might be trying to convince me that this was all in my head, but your body is telling the truth. You just wanted to tap my hand, didn’t you?”
“What? Um, no. Of course not,” Harry stammers. “Not that I have anything against… um, gay people. They’re cool. You’re cool. I mean—I’m cool with it.”
Draco takes a deep breath, willing his voice to sound confident and calm. “He said that Potter has to finish what he started and begin where it ended. He also said something about making something broken whole again.”
“Ow! What the—” Blaise instantly let go of Draco and looked down at the floor. “Did your koala just slap my leg?”
There’s no doubt he hates Harry even more now. If that’s even possible. Well, Harry hates him just as much for all the things he has done to him and his friends. If the Slytherin hadn’t been such a git to him first, Harry would have had no reason to hate him like this. He would have been just another stupid bully, who thinks he’s better than everyone else. But he had singled out Harry and had made it his life’s mission to torture him on every possible occasion. Who wouldn’t want to retaliate?
The sudden silence feels awkward, making Draco squirm in his seat. He wonders if Potter is thinking about the other things that happened last night. At least he had the decency not to bring it up. Yet. Then again, he doesn’t know he’s not the only one who got… slightly aroused by the whole unfortunate situation. So, really, from Potter’s point of view, this is only embarrassing for him.
It takes a second for Draco to digest all the bitterness underlying Potter’s statement. He’s about to point out that love doesn’t apply to the second half of Firenze’s riddle, until he realises that it does. Love is indeed lost on those who are content, he supposes.
It wasn’t exactly unusual behaviour. And Harry was used to it by now. He and Draco had been flatmates for over a year and Draco always seemed a bit touchy about his things. Curiously enough, he never snapped at Harry about it. Only at his friends. And Harry’s friends.
Potter closes his eyes and lets his nose brush against Draco’s. “I—Maybe. I’m not sure. It’s—It’s very confusing.”
Still, Draco tries to keep his face impassive and softly clears his throat. “Right. Onto the next one, then.” He takes a card, trying to ignore the iciness in his stomach. “
“Maybe,” Draco shrugged. “You never know with Lovegood. She’s very… unique.” Draco had to force himself not to snigger when he saw the shock on Potter’s face. “Actually, I’m taking her somewhere I’ve never taken anyone before.”
Malfoy grunts when Harry softly bites his bottom lip and smiles. He returns the favour, leaving Harry breathless and shivering.
Merlin, this is horrifying. The sudden urge to reach out and pat Potter on the shoulder overpowers him, but before he can, Potter clears his throat.
“Your home life must be so boring,” Draco mutters with a smirk. He leans back in his chair, feeling rather pleased with himself when Potter looks over the dividing wall with furrowed brows. “Do you even leave this place to sleep?”
“I’m not bothered that you feel this way,” he said without turning around. “Just don’t crawl into my bed uninvited again.”
“Sorry. Carry on,” he says, inwardly groaning as he spots Malfoy in the far corner. Guilt washes over him, mixed with anger. Because… why should he feel guilty? Malfoy is the one who—
Draco drinks in Potter’s scarlet face and his flared nostrils, feeling like his entire body just turned into stone. It takes a moment for him to regain his composure, to force his lips into something that hopefully resembles a grin.
But now, suddenly, what Draco has longed for seems to be within his reach. And he wants it. Desperately. But he can’t let hope cloud his senses. It’s foolish. It’s delusional. It can never happen. It will never happen. Because this, Draco lying in Potter’s arms, is just another demonstration of his helper syndrome. It doesn’t mean anything. Draco doesn’t mean anything to him. He’s nothing.
Potter looked like he wanted to say something, but he stayed silent and simply nodded. Draco inwardly snorted. How had this turned into a Mind Healing session? It was utterly absurd.
Draco feels the first signs of a coronary when he sees Weasley being pushed through the door. By Potter.
“Can I?” he asked, his hand hovering over Potter’s stomach. For a moment, he thought Potter was going to say no. Anguish was written all over his face. He still seemed unsure when he gave Draco a slight nod.
“When we—When we—” He cleared his throat, his cheeks slowly turning pink. “When you held me—I—I—” Potter made a choking sound and it was clear he couldn’t finish his sentence.
“But—But look!” Teddy stepped closer and took the koala’s face in his hands. “Doesn’t he have the prettiest eyes?”
Squaring his shoulders, he stomps into the living room and grabs the remote. He flicks through the channels until… yes, perfect, a football match. He turns up the volume until the infuriating noise from Malfoy’s room is drowned out. But, unfortunately, not hearing them isn’t giving Harry the peace of mind he hoped for. He still knows Malfoy is in there... shagging some girl.
Snape doesn’t answer immediately. When he does, it is probably under the scrutiny of Dumbledore’s piercing eyes.
“It does matter! They’re clearly underestimating you! Even though they’ve all seen you play! Are they blind?”
“Yeah, um… I sneaked inside when you showed Luna around and one of the teachers showed me something.”
Harry’s heart nearly jumps out of his chest. Draco Malfoy is straddling him. And he’s playing with his hair. What the actual fuck.
Draco wills himself to lie still, trying to ignore the feeling of Potter’s chest rubbing against his back.
“You really are thick, Potter,” Blaise sighed. He looked around the room until he spotted something on the shelf. With one nod of his head, the clock he had fixed his eyes on flew across the room and landed on one of the windowsills. Grinning to himself, Blaise leaned back in his seat and winked at Harry.
Draco frowned when he saw Potter clutching the duvet. If he was taking the piss, he was doing it in a rather convincing way. Draco decided to play along for a while, see if Potter was indeed up to something.
“You’ll have to show me your credentials, of course. And we’d have to set up some test lessons, to see if you’re suited for the job. But if Longbottom is right, that shouldn’t be a problem at all.”
“And then you started dating Chang,” he scoffed. “I wanted to snap your neck when I found out you were dating her. It was—” He bit his lip. Could he really do this? He was already feeling overwhelmed. He searched Potter’s face for any indication he should stop talking. His dark skin looked ashen and he was obviously shocked. If anything, it encouraged Draco to keep going. “And when— when you started dating Weasley—” He gulped. He had never intended to tell Potter any of this. Maybe it was pointless. But maybe, it was exactly what Potter needed to hear. “When you started dating Weasley, I hated you so much. I couldn’t concentrate on— on what I was supposed to do. But it also made me reckless, because— because I knew I’d never get what I wanted. It didn’t matter anyway. The Dark Lord was about to kill me, so what was the point in hoping?” He let out a humourless laugh and shook his head. “And then, you defeated him.” He looked Potter straight in the eye without blinking. “You defeated him, giving everyone a second chance for happiness. Except me.” He knew he wasn’t being fair, but this was how he had felt back then. “I tried to avoid you as much as possible, but you’re so bloody stubborn and kept trying to talk to me. I just couldn’t handle it.”
Draco peeked at McGonagall. One of her eyebrows was raised, making her look more stern. A classic McGonagall move.
Draco raises his chin even higher, unwilling to admit that Potter is kind of right. He resumes walking, rather stiffly, and jumps when he feels something unfamiliar on his back. It takes him a moment to realise that Potter draped his cloak around his shoulders.
Where the bloody hell was he? Was he not at home? Draco barged into the kitchen, only to find it empty. He stomped back into the hallway, frowning at the bathroom door. It was ajar, but the room was dark. That only left… his bedroom.
“Ugh, I hate you! I knew you were trying to find a way to humiliate me.” Malfoy shrugs out of his robes and flings them over his head. “Don’t come anywhere near me ever again!”
“Wait, not yet,” Draco moaned. Mere seconds later, his eyes rolled to the back of his head while his insides turned into molten lava. “Nngh!” His entire body trembled violently as he spilled all over Potter’s hand.
Draco presses his lips into a tight line and catches Weasley peeking at him. He can’t stand being in this room for another second.
His stomach flips when Potter’s eyes find his; does he feel it, too? The invisible force that seems to be between them, drawing them towards each other? Draco isn’t sure what to think when Potter’s smile slowly turns into a more serious expression, but it does make his breath hitch. He could almost convince himself that Potter feels what he feels with the way he’s looking at him, brushing his thumb against Draco’s hand.
Draco considered throwing the plate at Harry when he ran out of pancakes. Instead, he put it back on the table and gritted his teeth.
Harry hastily wipes his face with his sleeve. He’s still not sure what the hell he’s doing. But before he can stop himself, he hears himself whisper, “Could you… could you stay here for another minute?”
Harry asks himself. But Draco doesn’t stop in front of the wall of the hidden room. Instead, he keeps walking and walking, finally coming to a halt in front of the stone gargoyle that guards Dumbledore’s office. Harry doesn’t think he meant to go there, taking in Draco’s astonished expression. The Slytherin stares at the gargoyle for a second before he leans against the wall and sinks down to the ground, hugging his knees. Harry’s heart clenches as he sees tears streaming down his face. Even though he knows it’s pointless, he sits down beside him, wishing he could comfort him.
“No need to be shy about it,” Harry sniggers. He even goes so far as elbowing Malfoy. Perhaps that was a bit much. At least Malfoy seems to think so. He grabs Harry’s arm, pulling him forward until their noses are almost touching. The Niffler in Harry’s arms makes a displeased sound; it must be getting crushed between them.
Malfoy let out a sigh, followed by a snort. “I’m saying, Potter… If Blaise had asked me that question, I would have looked at you as well.”
“Oh god, I’m sorry. I didn’t—” Harry stops when Malfoy takes his other hand as well, and guides both of them to Harry’s back.
Does that mean Potter saw his family before he walked into the Forest? Draco tries to recall their conversation about it.
“They did,” Draco says dryly. “I don’t know what they expected would go differently if they forced Veritaserum down my throat a second time.” He rolls his eyes. “Little did I know that wretched truth potion would be the least of my problems. They were very… thorough in trying to figure out if I was still loyal to the Dark Lord. I guess they thought I might infiltrate the Ministry and finish what that sick bastard started.” He snorts. “They really thought they could break me. Pfft. After what the Dark Lord did to me, that was a cakewalk.”
Draco rolls his eyes, even though he has to admit it would be nice to at least be able to communicate in some manner.
“You!” She pointed her index finger at Draco. “You broke up with Astoria, so you better make it worth it.”
They stare at each other in horror as they simultaneously seem to realise the impossible has happened. The dream was real. Well, not real, but—Oh god, actually, Harry has no fucking idea what’s going on.
“But we’re still missing some details,” Dumbledore continues. “We know the curse you cast, Harry.” He ignores Harry’s flinching. “But we’re still not sure how it might have lead to this.”
He follows Potter, mentally berating himself, and knits his brows as he takes in his surroundings. The colour scheme is positively ghastly. Even the bloody armchairs and sofas are scarlet.
Harry still wasn’t convinced this would do anything for house unity. So far, Malfoy had picked a fight with Terry every time they were in the same room and he had even tried to hex Justin Finch-Fletchley once. As much as it annoyed Harry, at least it diverted Malfoy’s attention away from him. He really wasn’t in the mood to fight. He missed Ron. Seeing him in classes but not sharing a dorm just wasn’t the same.
“Sod that,” he suddenly muttered and let go of the two ice lollies. Before they hit the ground, Potter had his arms around Draco’s neck and their lips pressed together. Draco made a startled sound when Potter’s tongue pushed into his mouth. He tasted like artificial oranges. Yuck! But the things Potter apparently could do with that tongue…
Without warning, Potter grabbed both his forearms and pulled him down into a kiss, consequently pulling Draco’s cock deeper inside.
Draco spotted him sitting on Teddy’s bed, waggling his ears. The sight was worse than a stab to the chest. Slowly, Draco walked over to the bed and sat down next to him. He avoided eye contact, staring at his hands in his lap instead.
“Looking for the others,” Potter interjects. He gives Draco a meaningful glance. Merlin, how Gryffindor of him, wanting to protect Connor’s and Stella’s little secret. “He was pretty worked up about the whole thing.”
“That’s the understatement of the century,” Draco snorts. “But honestly, if you’re feeling nostalgic…” He opens one of the desk drawers, where he and Harry keep their memories. “You should… you should look at this one.” With the tip of his wand, he puts Harry’s memory back in its little vial and pours his own into the Pensieve. “Come on,” he says with a smirk, and they both dive in.
What’s worse, Potter tackles him and they both crash to the ground with Draco being pinned down by him.
“I also talked to McGonagall. I think we can both agree that sleeping in that tent again isn’t a good idea, even if the effect of the Goblin wine has worn off.”
Potter slams into him over and over until he suddenly stills and Draco feels his cock jerk inside of him.
Nobody has ever seen him naked before. He always makes sure to be quick in the showers after Quidditch practice, and some of his team mates might have caught a glimpse every now and then, but that’s different. He never presented himself to them, like he’s doing now, with Malfoy. He often wondered how someone would react to his body. Years and years of playing Quidditch have toned him, yes, but he’s still a little too skinny, still not that tall. He definitely doesn’t feel as confident about his body as he might seem. Speaking of confident…
Anger courses through him as his eyes fall on the deserted frame of the former Headmaster’s portrait. Maybe it’s a good thing Dumbledore isn’t here right now. Harry would probably regret all the things he’d be saying to him.
Draco blinks, still stunned from Potter licking his hand, but also from the sight before him. Potter looks so different when he laughs. Younger. Carefree. Draco’s eyes fixate on the little crinkles on Potter’s nose and around his eyes. He shakes his head and Draco’s gaze falls on his dimples. Potter has dimples. How could he have not noticed that before?
“Great, it’s finally settled then,” Draco hissed. “Oh, and by the way, I’m keeping your cheque, for the children. But you and I, we’re done!” He caught one last glimpse of Potter before he stepped into the fireplace again and immediately wished he hadn’t. It made his heart squeeze painfully to see so much hurt in his eyes, but there was no other way. Potter had hurt him too much. There was no excuse in the world that would ever make up for it.
Ugh. Fuck. Potter snores. Merlin’s fucking balls does he snore. And his mouth is right next to Draco’s ear.
His eyes dart over the map, searching for Draco, but he’s nowhere to be found. That can only mean one thing. He’s gone to the Room of Requirement again.
“Maybe we could take a look at the last flat again? It didn’t seem so bad,” Harry moans while sucking on Draco’s neck feverishly. Draco makes a strangled noise and Harry isn’t sure if it is in response to his question, or to him sucking Draco’s neck. That is, until he hears Draco mutter,
“Oh. Right,” Harry mutters, feeling sheepish. For a moment, he forgot about that. With every step they take, his mood seems to be getting gloomier. He almost wishes he could take back what he just told Malfoy. No matter how hard they try, they can’t just pretend to be two boys, overcoming their animosity in the afternoon sun. It will take far more than that. Maybe it can’t be done at all.
“Wait, you need your robes first,” Ginny sniggers. Harry hears her laugh heartily as Ron shouts at Hermione, matching Harry’s excitement. While Ginny helps him get down the stairs, he tries very hard not to feel guilty about leaving Malfoy behind.
Draco blinked. Was this what it felt like to be on the receiving end of Potter’s chivalry? Even though Draco wanted to point out he was more than capable of fighting his own battles, he had to admit, it didn’t feel too bad to have Potter defend him like that. Not bad at all.
He’s closer to being an ice sculpture than an actual human being when Potter returns. Even in the dark, Draco can see the snow glistening in his hair.
What if it’s Dumbledore, telling him there’s no cure for them? What if it’s Snape, finally confronting him about how he knew about the Sectumsempra-spell? What if it’s the Slytherins, avenging Draco’s injuries?
“That’s not-” Malfoy’s cheeks turned rosy as he quickly looked away. “Your name is always all over the paper.”
Draco mentally slaps himself as he gets up, grabs the damned cloth, and soaks it in some fresh water. He can’t believe he’s doing this.
It’s a very humbling experience. Not only having to inform Madam Pomfrey that nature is calling, but also having her accompany him and bring him into the right position, so he won’t… miss. He only lets her do it once. After that, he makes the matron write down a note for Ron, so he’ll take him instead. It’s still humiliating, but at least he’s making a fool out of himself in front of his best friend.
“Morning,” he grunts. Harry just nods. His scalp starts to prickle when he hears the shower running. This can’t be real. Draco sodding Malfoy is in his shower. Merlin’s beard.
, Harry almost says but stops himself at the last second. Why does his brain only supply him with such unhelpful things? What’s wrong with him?
Harry sags in his seat, cursing under his breath at the aching in his chest. Wrapping his head around the idea of being in love with Malfoy is one thing; being openly rejected by him, stared at as though he’s some kind of abomination… that just takes the biscuit. How can he kiss Harry, act like he
“Um…” Harry’s gaze flickers down once more, drawn-in by the curve of Malfoy’s mouth. His own lips are parted, his breath coming in short gasps. Without knowing what he’s doing, he slightly leans forward until his lips are almost touching Malfoy’s. Almost.
Harry makes a choking sound as Malfoy bursts out laughing. He pulls him into another kiss that leaves Harry completely breathless.
“I have to find him,” Draco whimpers, not caring about Weasley’s arched brow and the look on his face. “When was he last with you?”
“No wonder your hair looks so atrocious,” Malfoy calls from under the stream. “This shampoo is positively ghastly.”
“Oh.” Draco has no idea what else to say. He just stands there as Potter moves closer and slowly wraps his arms around Draco’s hips.
“Don’t you dare,” Draco warned. “Do you have any idea how expensive this is? I can’t believe I’m using it on you.”
Tea with Blaise turned out to be exactly what Draco needed. He hadn’t even realised how little human contact he’d had over the last few days. It was nice, talking and laughing with him. They spent nearly three hours in the conservatory, until Blaise stretched in his chair.
Harry almost let the bottles drop to the floor. He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco. He wanted to stay like this forever. Well, maybe not exactly like this. He could definitely use a shower and his feet were getting a bit cold. But he wanted them to stay like this; together. Because as long as Draco was with him, even cleaning their currently very disgusting flat was something that made him smile. Because he was happy. Draco always made him feel happy. Well, except when they were fighting. Which was pretty often. But they always made up. Sooner or later. Merlin, they were both so stubborn. But at the end of the day, Harry couldn’t imagine not speaking to Draco anymore, not seeing him every day. It would be torture. It would make everything meaningless.
“Yeah. But I don’t know how long you’d been there.” Draco pursed his lips. “Why did you turn back? Why now? And how?”
Harry bites his lip until it hurts. He can’t send an answer. He can’t let Draco think he’s alive when he’s about to walk to his death. It would break his heart.
Draco’s heart suddenly beats so fast, he’s a little embarrassed. Potter’s going to kiss him. Well, not really, he’s going to lick his lips, but it’s pretty much the same. Right?
“Look,” Harry continued, slowly lowering his hands. “I really am sorry that I hurt you. But I didn’t do it in purpose. I really had no idea.”
“But why?” Creevey looked scared again. Draco had to give it to him, as much as Draco seemed to frighten him, he really stood his ground. Bloody Gryffindors. “You’re just saying you don’t want to burn them, so I will give them to you. Oh! Or maybe you want to perform some sort of spell with them! Is it Dark Magic? Are you going to curse him or something?” He gasped “Are you going to k- kill Harry Potter? With my pictures?”
“What’s the matter, Potter? Having trouble keeping up?” Malfoy laughs. The sound is so unfamiliar, the sight of Malfoy’s mouth twisting upwards and his eyes shining brightly so surprising, it catches Harry completely off guard.
Potter’s brows slowly furrow and he looks at Draco, really looks at him, for the first time in days. Something flickers across his face, something that Draco can’t quite put his finger on; he assumes he’s struck a nerve and Potter feels caught.
“Haha, funny,” Harry laughs awkwardly. He presses his lips together when she gives him another stern look and shoves the parchment back at him.
Harry doesn’t know why she bothers telling him this. Maybe she’s trying to calm down herself, rather than him. Whatever she’s doing seems to be working. When Ron speaks again, it’s at a normal volume.
when Potter utters another moan. Mentally cursing, he places the cloth on the Gryffindor’s head. Potter stirs in his sleep and the cloth slides down to his shoulder.
Draco found himself hesitating. Why was it that this thing could be so irritating but so cute at the same time? He shouldn’t give in, though. Right? What kind of message would that send? He shouldn’t reward the koala for acting out and practically ripping off his trousers. But… oh, those eyes. Those cute little eyes. And that nose. And those ears!
Draco rolls his shoulders, hoping to hit Potter in the face, fully aware that he will hurt himself more than Potter. Still.
“It’s really sweet,” Harry said. He meant it, but he suspected Draco thought he was making fun of him.
Harry gave him a toothy grin and wiggled his eyebrows. “I think this is the one time being Harry Potter might come in handy.”
“But most Muggle-borns don’t know they have magic. I only found out I’m a wizard when I got my letter from Hogwarts,” Potter said.
“Then I’ll try to defend myself,” he answers with a shrug. “I’ll probably grope him somewhere inappropriate, though. You know, given the circumstances.” He gestures to his eyes. “He’ll be so shocked, he’ll forget all about attacking me.”
Harry holds his breath, mainly to keep himself from saying anything that might give Malfoy the wrong idea. Well, not the
“I think I would have noticed,” Harry says, dread bubbling up inside him. What is going on? What is happening to him? He grabs his wand and points it at the flowers. “Evanesco!” The flowers are still there.
As Draco sat there, feeling dizzy all over again, he came to the conclusion he couldn’t really be blamed for any of this. It wasn’t his fault he couldn’t get the insufferable prat out of his head. No, it was entirely Potter’s fault. And he was going to pay for it.
When the silence finally feels too awkward, Draco softly clears his throat. “Is there any chance you’ll forgive me?”
It would probably knock all the breath out of Draco’s lung, but he already felt breathless. All he could think about was the fact that he might be kissing Harry Potter in the next few seconds.
“Y—You said you f—f—felt angry. Before. The—The other day. W—when I h—heard the v—v—voice the first t—time.”
“Come here,” Potter said huskily, motioning for him to come closer. Draco obliged, sliding forward on his knees until their thighs were touching. “Hold out your hand.” Draco did and flinched when he suddenly felt something cold and wet in his hands. “Lube,” Potter said.
“You’re not a prefect anymore,” Parkinson snarled, “and Potter is not lying on the floor dying, so what do you even—”
Harry lets out another sigh, his lips stretching into a smile. He moves his head a little and jumps when his nose bumps against something. Unwilling, but unable to stop himself, he blinks open his eyes. Everything is blurry. And too bright.
“If Master would kindly shut up now and eat his fucking pancakes,” Potter grins. “They’re getting cold.”
He lies awake for a long time, probably hours after Potter’s arm slackens around him. He blinks in the darkness, wondering if sleep will find him at all tonight, when he hears something. It’s… soft at first, and then…
“Well, I can’t speak for everybody,” Potter says, grabbing Draco’s hand before he can pull away. His fingers are so warm against Draco’s skin. “With sex, it’s mostly about satisfying your body’s needs.”
Harry didn’t know he could blush this hard, not after nearly being shagged by Malfoy in said broom closet. That is, until he realizes, Malfoy is standing behind him and just read every - single - word.
Stunned, Draco watches as Potter’s hands move to his arse. He’s—He’s holding himself open for Draco. And there’s—Oh Merlin! There’s lube smeared all over the cleft. Is that what the spell did?
“Okay, um—” Potter looked unsure, tapping a finger on his glass. “How about we get another drink first?”
Potter lifts his legs and wraps them around Draco. It feels like he crossed them at the ankles on Draco’s back. Fuck. Draco has no idea why that would turn him on, but it does.
Harry sticks out his tongue at Draco, watching the scene in front of him through narrowed eyes. He has no idea why Draco enjoys watching them so much. It’s fucking awkward.
“Maybe, um,” Hermione clears her throat. “Maybe we should give them a moment.” She ushers Ron out of the hospital wing, who’s protesting but lets Hermione push him regardless, while Dean follows them quietly.
Potter shrugs and turns his eyes to the ceiling innocently. “It feels like doing homework,” he says after a moment.
Draco almost cried out when Potter’s hand curled around his cock; it only prompted Draco to move even more frantically.
“Oh, I was eager alright. You just completely took me off guard then. I wanted to return the favour.”
Draco makes sure his body is only touching Potter in the places he needs the most. Which, apparently, is everywhere. However, he refrains from putting his arm around Potter. He takes a deep breath, feeling relief wash over him. His chest is slowly warming up and he can finally feel his thighs again. Unable to resist, he presses his icy nose against the back of Potter’s neck, letting out a sigh when the stinging slowly subsides.
“Harry,” Granger says. Draco can tell she’s trying to sound soothing. “I’m definitely not saying this is your fault.” She raises her hands in a defensive gesture when Potter narrows his eyes at her. “I’m not. But the thing is… Harry, he
“I’m not ready,” he finally said, shaking his head. “It would make things… too real.” He walked over to one of the shelves and leaned his head against it. “But if I’m too much of a burden—”
Harry stops poking his plate. What would Lucius Malfoy have done if his son hadn’t wanted to become a Death Eater? Would he have given him a choice? Harry doubts it. And suddenly, there’s this slight possibility that Malfoy…
“Oh Merlin,” Harry sighed, still grinning. His eyes swept over Draco’s ruined clothes and his messed up hair. “Come on,” he said with a wink, dragging Draco out of the kitchen. “Let’s take a shower. I’m getting hungry for something else.”
“Are you ever?” Harry sniggers. “Maybe next time. My head is throbbing. I think I’ll take a quick nap.”
“I’m afraid I have to go now,” Malfoy says. Is Harry imagining it or does he sound a little… regretful? He feels a rush of adrenalin shoot through him when Malfoy reaches over and brushes his fingers against the back of Harry’s hand. “Walk me back to work?”
Draco’s arms finally give way and his face is suddenly squashed against the pillow. His hands instinctively fly up to grab the sides of it. It’s still burning, but there’s definitely some tingling, too. And it’s spreading.
“Merlin, Potter, yes, but I didn’t tell you to remove yourself from the castle completely. Why do you always have to go overboard?” He lets his arms fall back to his side and purses his lips. “May I sit down?”
An hour later, Draco was sitting in his favourite café, tapping his foot impatiently. Luna wouldn’t tell anyone, would she? Had she already? Ugh, this was maddening!
For a moment, Draco considers just staying on the ground. His entire body aches. He can still feel Potter inside of him. He chokes.
With his eyes half closed, Harry stretches out one gloved hand and tries to grab one of the Flobberworms.
After a few steps, Malfoy’s hand suddenly slips out of his. Surprised, Harry almost stumbles. Malfoy catches him, grabbing his upper arm. He starts guiding Harry, the way Ginny guided him before and Harry wonders why Malfoy didn’t just take his hand again.
Draco had instructed him to wait in the courtyard while he and Luna had gone inside, so Draco could show her the place. One of the teachers had soon offered to take over, to which Luna had heartily agreed, urging Draco to go back to Potter.
Harry sighs. “Alright, alright.” It takes him almost half an hour to empty the bowl placed in front of him. Afterwards, Madam Pomfrey hands him three different vials. They all taste appalling.
Teddy smiled and leaned his head against Draco’s shoulder. Draco kissed his turquoise hair before he pressed his cheek against it. He paused when he found the koala looking straight at him.
“Yeah,” Potter murmured. “They didn’t seem to have that much trouble, finding their place. Meanwhile, I’m still struggling every day to just… keep it together.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, trying to sound earnest. “I should have warned you that something like this might happen.”
“You’re not going to beat yourself up about this again, are you?” he muttered, suppressing the urge to lean into Potter’s touch.
“You don’t have to do me any favours, Malfoy,” Harry says, surprised at how much he’s stung by Malfoy’s words.
He suddenly realised he was probably expected to give some sort of answer or comment. But he had no idea what to say.
Okay, so he stared at the heart-framed dot, wondering if Hermione might actually be on to something. Maybe he even imagined what Malfoy’s hair would feel like if he ran his hands through it, what Malfoy would do if Harry pushed him against a wall, what his lips would feel like on Harry’s, what sounds he would make while Harry sucked on his neck…
