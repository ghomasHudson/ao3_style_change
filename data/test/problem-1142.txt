I heard him rise from the sofa and felt the sleek satin of the blindfold sliding over my eyes, Malfoy deftly tying a knot to keep it in place and I couldn’t help the audible intake of breath I made.
I continued to swallow Harry’s moans, each one longer and more guttural than the last, as I worked him open with first two, then three fingers.
“And you, Mr Lupin, you’ll be needing to replenish your supplies for your second year?”
“And here I thought I was going to be regaled with any number of torrid tales of The-Boy-Who-Lived-to-Suck-Cock,” I sighed dramatically, flopping onto my back once more, arm draped over my forehead, in a perfect fainting couch position.
At the same time, his right hand reached between us to grab my left arm, bringing it up to join the other above my head, where he grasped both my wrists in his right hand letting the other trail slowly down my arm, across my shoulder, to cup my face.
Having to Obliviate yourself and every moment you shared out of someone’s life?
How could I not oblige and continue to fuck him silly with my mouth?
And it’s all my fault.
Who was I kidding?
,” I sobbed as my legs and arms suddenly clamped down under the effects of a binding charm, and I could only try to wriggle my hips back against his face as he continued to tease and lick around my hole, gliding along my crack, tongue sliding under to tease at my perineum, the tip just barely grazing the top of my bollocks, and I was pretty damned sure I would have collapsed by now had the spell not been holding me up and open for him.
Hell, if we were going to be genuine for a moment, I might as well go all out.

“I’m serious,” he pressed. “Would you even love me without my cock?”
“I… I just feel awful, ‘Mione,

“Oops!” a voice called out, the sofa shaking again as though the person had flung themselves back against the backrest of the sofa, jarring Harry and me again.
“Pansy doesn’t cook,
soon,” he replied, hands and mouth still trailing kisses and I whimpered because why was my life so goddamned unfair?
A quick glance behind told me that Arthur and Amos were leading my father off to some far corner of the tent, and I grinned down at Harry as I took a bite of the goat cheese toast.
He groaned into me, hips rolling down into mine.
“Fuck, Harry,” he sighed, head burrowing into my neck. “I’m sorry…”
However, my ears had perked up when Draco had mentioned something about how he
Harry, I noticed, also seemed to
“Hi, Harry,” he replied, leaning in to brush his lips against mine.
A few texts later, my attention was back with Harry as we walked along the cobbled rue
Certainly not Harry?
A real, genuine, hearty, fucking belly laugh, head tossed back, a few strands of his (much-shorter) ponytail coming loose and framing his face, and I couldn’t help but shake my head at how bloody weird it was to see a version of Lucius Malfoy that wasn’t pure
“Couldn’t find a cock big enough,” he stated, still as serious as could be.

I groaned and sobbed and hiccoughed all at once, and curled myself more tightly into a ball as if that would somehow help.
He was still leaning back against me, eyes closed, and I gently nudged him forward and out of the spray so I could work the lather into his hair properly. I took my time, fingers gently working in circles to work out any tightness in his scalp, as well as to work the shampoo into his locks. Perhaps I thought if I reached every single strand, individually, his hair might cooperate and not stick up all over the place.
“Merlin, you
“Just the newspaper,” he replied, folding it up and setting it aside, then waving a hand to send all of his work papers neatly back into the closet.

“Still a sassy, cocky, cocksucker, just like always, huh?” Ben joked.
I frowned up at him in confusion and he grinned.
“Mum, I asked him if he preferred a Cab, Merlot, or Zin, and he said ‘

“Why didn’t you?” I asked, finally allowing myself to enjoy my whisky.

He shrugged.

“What is he doing here?” I asked Toshio, ignoring Draco’s comment. “Do you know?”
“You dirty
I’d heard of him, of course, but he could’ve been an absolute nobody and I still would've stopped in my tracks.
And with that, he reached out and pulled the door open, and Alice and I both gasped.
“They all know I’m a stubborn arse,” I admitted, taking a sip of my pint, using it as an excuse to pull my bottom lip into my mouth, all the while gazing at Malfoy innocently.

“Oh,” he let out a little laugh. “Right. I don’t know why I thought I had to stand here, still as a statue, while I waited.”
“Bessie, my house-elf,” Draco replied, chewing thoughtfully. “She looked like a regular housekeeper to you, but she’s a magical creature.”

“I should have
Blaise looked as though he weren’t sure which side to put himself on, and Violet and I quickly crossed the shop to join the group, laughing and clearly placing ourselves on the side of Alfie, Harry, and Draco.
“I would have done, too,” Harry assured him, and Blaise shuddered.
“This wand…” Ollivander reached out to grasp Teddy’s wand.
The laughter died down and everyone went back to eating more cake and Soul Cakes, little shortbread biscuits filled with strawberry-rhubarb jam that were

couldn’t accept…
Where are you? Are you alright?”
“It’s not 2004,” Draco began hesitantly. “It’s… 2009.”
That was a mistake.
“I’d imagine you should start by undressing me,” he drawled lazily, hand slipping from my hair to rest on his thigh, blue-grey eyes staring down at me, one brow lifted gently.
“But I’m sure you and all your buddies will recognise the
“Right,” I nodded. “Just Draco, then.”
“So… then I’m allowed to ask that you finish what you started?” he asked, taking the few steps separating us and pulling me up against him.
“Sushi? For breakfast?”
“Well,
We all turned to look at Ben and Draco expectantly.
He paused and frowned down at me, letting our hands drop, still clasped, between us.
“If you say so,” I replied, executing a neat little half-turn of my own and taking off towards the other end of the field, having noticed that George had stolen the Quaffle from Ginny and was now zooming back towards the goalposts, Charlie already circling, eyes trained on George in anticipation.
I could see the protective bubble rising
“Right now?” I repeated with a smirk. “Are you sure? I think even you would probably need to be prepped a bit before I fuck you proper, don’t you?”
Draco only groaned once more, withdrawing before driving back in just as slowly, as though he was savouring the slick, slow slide in, that brilliant tongue of his pressing and furling into me, then back out, and in again, insisting on that infuriatingly slow pace, ignoring my cries and pleas for more.

Harry’s hand was snaking its way towards the last pickle spear on Draco’s plate, and he glanced up at his boyfriend innocently.
“Well, Harry, I’m happy for you,” I told him earnestly. “Really.”
“Micah, you’re
“Merlin, she’s terrifying,” Ron informed us all in an exaggerated whisper.
Our wizarding INTERPOL, if you will.
“Then what would you call it?” Blaise countered, almost lazily.
“And they both died doing just that,” Harry muttered, plunking himself down in the chair in front of Sirius’ photo, eyes flickering from Lupin, to Sirius, and his father.
“You’re not supposed to be here,” this Draco person sounded amused as he turned to watch Harry make his way down the stairs.
Hadn’t even mentioned or hinted at feeling put out, and had even
“Do you know if anyone else is coming?” Harry asked timidly from behind Fred’s shoulder, and he turned, an enormous smile on his face.
“Before I start this vigorous round of questioning, let me just say… the two of you look blissfully happy and I’m not sure I’ve ever even seen something so adorable.”
the compliment I was aiming for…”
The screen at the back of the table raised again, two pairs of hands depositing steaming bowls of noodles onto the counter, and Draco straightened, smirking at my unfocused gaze, and I was already berating my cock-slut self for undoubtedly repeating those words later today, and told myself to concentrate on eating my ramen.
“I suppose the punishment, for both of you, is only to show people who you really are. See how that works out for you.”
cause it was just the Cannons, sorry, Ron,” I said, automatically, knowing Ron’s feathers were ruffled without even looking.
“I… you… you’re not welcome here,” I gasped, but it was as though I had been rendered completely immobile and my body involuntarily moved out of his way as he strode into our foyer and shut the door behind him.
“You should probably head back to your office,” I added, glancing at the clock on the wall. “We wouldn’t want our little Dragon getting suspicious of your own lunchtime whereabouts, now, would we?”
Probably.
“It’s bloody gorgeous, isn’t it?” I asked, pulling Harry towards me and placing a kiss just above his ear, delighting in the way his eyes were wide with wonder, taking in the scenery.

“Can’t you see it?” Callum asked, glancing up at me and Alice curiously.
“Yeah.”
I drove myself into him mercilessly yet he still kept raising his hips to meet me, head thrown back, gasps spilling from his mouth.
He said it almost instantly, then looked as though he wished he hadn’t.
The masses were decidedly split:

“I…” he began, then paused, frowning in thought.
Harry let out a string of expletives and glared up at me.
I shook my head, then realised this didn’t quite answer his question.
He gave a nod in Harry and Draco’s direction, and Alice looked on the verge of replying when I heard Harry’s voice coming up behind me.
“Thinking I should probably figure out a new signature look. One that doesn’t take up so much time,” he quipped, running a hand through his tousled hair.
Erm… thank you.
“You heard the boss,” he quipped. “Tell the
Two little platters of appetisers came zooming out then: one filled with a variety of olives, ricotta-stuffed cherry peppers, and a selection of cheeses and charcuterie; the other filled with more kid-friendly things like fruit kebabs with yoghurt dip, cubes of cheddar, and small sausage bites.

“Does that count?” Anaïs asked excitedly. “He is fixing his suit, non?”
“Because,” he nipped at my mouth again, “it’s better the second time around.”

time before he flung his arms around Draco, pulling him close.
Harry’s moans grew louder and more steady as his fingers wound themselves through my hair and his hips began to pump tentatively into my mouth, encouraging me to pick up the pace.
George was just reaching for a sandwich when there was a flurry of noise and commotion in the doorway, and I recognised Harry from his birthday party.

And a very full, lively one, at that!
This was something that happened every once in a while.
I don’t know that I’ve seen two people more taken with one another in my entire life, and I’m so happy for you, darling.
One of the foreign agents chuckled disdainfully.
Another blast of energy and the pebbles had re-launched themselves at Draco with renewed energy, only to bounce back off the invisible shield again.
“Yes,” he mumbled, tongue and mouth still working against my own, leaving me to wonder if perhaps I
“Growing up with a brother like him?”
We were so engrossed in the conversation that we hadn’t noticed the commotion at the other table until Harry stood suddenly beside me.
“So he’s still there?”
Alfie nodded again.
Minutes later, Draco and I were seated inside one of the giant swan pedal boats — I’m not kidding, these things were huge, and the giant swan neck blocked most of the view from the front, although we could see well enough from the open sides.
“Anyway,” Pansy interrupted. “What are you two,
Ron broke the awkward silence that ensued by bursting out laughing.
I’d been surprised when Hermione, Luna, and other girls I knew talked about sucking cock like it was a chore.

“I mean, we all know you’ve never been good at sharing,” he continued.

“I-I…” I managed to stammer before Draco’s icy drawl cut me off.
“Merlin, your eyes are pretty,” I sighed before I could think about what I was saying.
Just turned her head back to Harry with a pointed raise of her brow.
sorry,

He measured a generous pour of whiskey into each glass, then handed one to me while cradling his own in his hand, a slightly predatory look on his face.

the proper firewood for tonight’s fires.
“Ok,” I mumbled between kisses, one heel smacking firmly into the doorjamb as Harry continued to steer us towards the bedroom.
“Ben, love,” he said, his entire demeanour changing, relaxing and leaning towards Ben as he sipped his pint, eyes flickering around the pub.
We all sat in silence for a bit, drinking our pints.
What. The.
“No idea,” I replied. “But the let alone on one of these places is probably

Bill sat at the head of the table, with Ron and Hermione to his right, and Charlie and George on his left; Luna sat between George and Micah, dreamily taking in the surrounding scene.
When I’d first moved in, I’d assumed that Draco’s pristine kitchen, with its sleek white lines and stainless appliances, was mostly for show.
“Why are they all surrounding them like that?” Callum asked.
I gave his delectable arse one last lick before looking up at him from between his thighs.
“Any theories?” he asked finally.
I grinned as I turned towards the familiar drawl, already knowing who I’d be
“I-I… I don’t,” he managed to stammer out. “I…
But I remember him laughing gleefully, eyes glinting impishly as he would play pranks on Blaise and me, sometimes even going so far as to rifle casually through our minds, showing off his wandless magic and ability to do any number of hexes and charms without leaving so much as a trace.
We had just entered the courtyard when Hermione called out.
“You can’t walk right…”
“Yeah. Coming.”
Draco groaned, blue-grey eyes opening to look at me as he greedily sucked my cock back down into his throat, giving another throaty moan as I held myself there, watching him.
“Spill it, Potter,” Pansy reminded me.

, and it just dawned on me that maybe it’s not just a word he made up about being cute in public.
Still, overall, I was ecstatic to be living here, with Ginny, and was looking forward to discovering how wizards spent Halloween.

“Ravish?” I asked, leaning down once more to press lingering kisses along Harry’s jawline, his overnight stubble tickling my lips.
“Are… are those spider webs?” I asked, peering at the trees further in from the path that seemed to be covered in lacy gossamer.
- Harry and Draco just really can't stop being fucking adorable, now, can they?
“No, Draco, please,” he gasped, hand grasping at my hair again.
“We’ll watch them,” I assured her with a grin. “Say no more.”
“Is there any chance of meeting this delectable bloke?” Blaise asked, smirking my way.
Draco tumbled down on top of me, arms wrapping around me as we rearranged ourselves to get comfortable.
“Thank you,
Here, she fixed both Draco and me with a pointed stare, and I had to admit to myself that both of us sometimes spent too much time discussing details.
“I’ve no doubt between the two of you, we’ll find the connection soon enough,” Bones allowed us a rare smile.
Harry’s fingers were scrabbling frustratedly at my shirt, which was soaking wet and sticking to my body, so I wordlessly reminded him
I mean, maybe that’s what he came over to do but I asked him who the hell he was and he said he was just trying to figure out why Draco looked familiar.
The fuck was Draco doing here? I wondered, rising to greet my mate.

“Why? What’s going on that you need my help?”
On her feet were scarily high heels that matched her jacket, which she, of course, strutted about in as though they were everyday trainers.
And, although I’d never really thought about it before, I realised it made
“I like to imagine a couple having a row here, and one of them just snapping the partition closed again,” he confided, eyes sparkling with laughter. “I mean, wouldn’t that just be the most effortless fuck you?”

Draco snorted and looked up as Ron and Hermione staggered in.

Harry needed no further encouragement and reached for his own, breaking it in half and pulling the pieces apart, watching the caramel stretch.

“I can watch with her,” Hermione added quickly, never having been one to love flying.
They were good, I supposed, I mean, if I was trying to show this bloke that I had a cock that could please even the pickiest size queen. I didn’t get it, personally, but was glad there seemed to be a host of blokes out there looking to split themselves open on my cock.
And he’d accused
“HARRY!” I all but yelled this time
“Need you,” he gasped, still pressing his signature little kitten kisses into my mouth.
A few moments later, I inhaled deeply as the scent of lavender added itself to the warming layer pervading the room.
“Hullo, Tristan,” I purred, pulling him close. “I’m Harry.”
Harry gave a slight shake of his head as Hermione, Ginny, and Micah made their way, giggling, to the loo, talking about reapplying make-up, and fashion, and other silly things I swear I'd

Rather, I didn’t want to.
“Another victim. She wasn’t much help,” Williams sighed. “I mean, more of the same, you know.”
His feet were bare, pale and slender, against the wood floor, with an impossibly high arch that made me think of Roman statues I’d seen in museums; I briefly wondered if his legs would also be sculpted marble perfection.
I didn’t even think to try not to buck my hips up and back into his mouth, begging for more.
“That’s putting it mildly,” George snorted.
I nodded and grabbed my two pints then followed Dudley up the fire-engine-red spiral stairs adjacent to the bar to the mezzanine, where we found an empty table near the wrought-iron railing that overlooked the main pub downstairs.
I must have shifted or somehow pulled away in my thought process because Harry suddenly clutched at me, drawing me closer, and I couldn’t help but smile down at him and breathe in the scent of his hair.
A woman was standing there, scowling at us.
“I’d buy them by the half-dozen, at least.”
“Permanent
I’d caught him mid-sip, so he only nodded in response.

“I don’t have anything planned,” I assured him as we stood and set off along one of the park's many walkways.

As the rest of the group made their way inside, I wrapped my arms around Harry to pull him closer, bending my head to bury my nose in his thick locks, one hand travelling up his back to tangle into the curls at the back of his head as I tilted his head up to capture his lips with my own.
I muttered. “Because I just

“Georgie, come sit here, beside me,” Pansy called out, patting the

Soon after, we had exited the bank, and were back on the alley, turning left to head up one fork of Diagon Alley that Gringott’s split like a stalwart ship.
“And appreciation.”
In fact, I’d toyed with the idea of telling mum and dad that I’d taken up the diet myself, just to see their reactions.
“Excuse me,” a voice sounded somewhere to my left.
I could sense all of Harry’s fear.
“What’s going on?” Micah whispered, nudging me.
As if the stupid Boy Who Lived needed another person to
“A tad on edge, thanks to an evil blond prat I’ve somehow let ferret his way into my life,” he replied snarkily and I couldn’t contain the howl of laughter that bubbled up in my throat at that.

“And… trust me, you do
“Sperm sac of codfish?” I blurted out, nearly spitting out my sip of tea. “Is… is that a mistranslation?”
“I know,” he said, quietly, and I leaned in to capture his bottom lip but he pulled away, his hands coming up to begin their own exploration of my front, finally settling on my hips.
Instead of having the effect Harry had hoped, little Hugo gave a frightened little gasp and clutched at Blaise a little more tightly.
I felt the shirt begin to
“Honestly, I think I like you every way,” I admitted. “Any way.”
“Which, I suppose is fortunate, as it’s relevant to this conversation,” he added, dropping a kiss onto the top of Harry’s head.
I smirked to myself as I reached an arm back to pull Draco’s face round for a proper snog.
“No,” Harry sighed, reaching for a biscuit & pouring himself a bit more tea.
I pushed forward, allowing my head to push through, squeezing into that impossibly tight channel.
“N-n-no!” I wailed, head twisting up and back, trying to stare at him frantically.
He laughed again.
“Merlin, Harry, no wonder you're settling debts with that pretty mouth of yours,” she purred. “It must be bloody fantastic. Do a girl a favour and share a few tips sometime, hmm?”
I was about to fold Harry into my arms and ask him quietly how he was doing when I noticed his t-shirt.
I’d expected Draco’s curling fingers to pull me closer, urging his rapidly filling cock further into my mouth, but instead, he pulled me away.
“We’ll have a bottle of the Blanc de Blancs,” he told Colin, who nodded approvingly. “And an order of the fried olives to start, please?”
“And don’t even waste any time trying to come up with any plausible explanation for how or why that would happen.
at him nearly constantly, with such ease that I wondered if he might have figured out a spell to see out the back of his head.
“Thanks for the tea,” he said, stepping towards me and hugging me as I stood.
I'm pretty sure this is the longest it's taken me to post a chapter, and I know I always hate it when I have to wait.
Could you imagine thinking you were madly in love with someone only to find out you’d been broken up for four years?
“Those seem like two very different places, to me.”
my manners?” I teased.
“Confused?” I guessed.
notice the way Draco stared at Harry as though he were the moon, the stars, and the entire goddamned universe, they had to be blind.
I glanced around and felt thankful that I had such a great circle of mates, literally.
“What do you mean?” I demanded, looking frantically at Pansy. “I just
“Pansy!” he cried out, arms stretched out for a hug as he made his way to where she sat. “How did I not notice you until now?”
Some people
I closed my eyes and sank lower in the loveseat, spreading my thighs, allowing Harry better access, as I lost myself in the wet, satiny heat of his mouth working up and down my length, throat opening and swallowing around me like it’s what Harry was put on this earth to do.
Draco reached down to wrap his hand around my cock, jerking me off in time, and all too soon, I heard him cry out. Felt him shooting up inside of me, eyes squeezing shut, hand still working my cock until I, too, shot over that edge, collapsing onto him, biting at the juncture of his neck and shoulder, marking him with an absolutely feral growl.
“Use of an Unforgivable Curse, Creation and Distribution of an Illegal Substance, Involuntary Manslaughter because of the Muggle woman that died, Assault and Attempted Battery for that ridiculous scene out in Devon, Kidnapping, Misuse and Abuse of Glamours…”
I nodded again and opened my Pensieve app and selected a memory of Harry and I pedalling on the Serpentine on our first date, Harry grinning over as he caused the other pedalo to circle and go off track to show to the group.
“Molly said you were decorating, but it looks like you lot are all standing around doing a
“Wicked,” Callum breathed, staring in awe as the pot of rosemary floated into the kitchen and out of sight. “Am I going to learn how to do that?”
I leaned against the bar, flagging the barman down and ordered another round, adding a brown ale and a blond lager for Malfoy. Of course, he drank blond beer.
Ben and Malik
“Your son, Alfie,” Draco began slowly. “He’s how old?”
I could inhale the scent of him.
“But,” I countered, my cock sliding deep inside him once more. “This is exactly what you asked for.”
Baby Harry’s eyes widened in excitement and he turned his head to beam at his mum while he and his father slowly circled the garden.
Don’t get me wrong, I noticed other good-looking people, both men and women, but never really bothered to examine them closely.
“Millicent Bulstrode had a crush on you?” Ron asked, looking even more horrified than he had when divulging his accidental nickname for Draco.
“I wouldn’t want to sit anywhere else,” George assured her, not skipping a beat as he quickly jogged up the stairs and sat beside Pansy.
Carefully.
I’d only intended to distract Harry for a moment, but the kiss inevitably deepened, and soon we were pressed up against each other, hands roaming, tongues tangling as I angled Harry towards the island of drawers in the centre of my closet, urging him to sit on it, wrapping his legs around me, grinding my hardening cock down against his own.
“It’s just, well, I know you loved him,” I began, glancing up hesitantly as Draco immediately pulled back and frowned.
“You’ve no right calling me a tease,” I continued, leaning forward to swirl another

For real, I'm so sorry these update took so long!
I brought the mobile back and flipped through to find the one of Harry blissfully biting into his avocado toast with a poached egg at another lazy brunch we’d enjoyed just a few weeks ago.
I forced myself to open my eyes and watch him in the mirror again.
“You fucking arse,” Draco muttered affectionately, and I realised that Draco

“Just a small peace offering for Potter,” Pansy soothed, wrapping her arms around Draco’s neck and kissing his cheek hello. “He deserves it.”
“Oh! You have been here long time, already!” he gasped, looking at Draco and I worried. “You should leave your bags here this morning!”
Let’s be honest, Harry and I having a row was no big news.
I licked a slow path from the base of his balls, up, pausing to savour the taste of him at that rosy
which I saw led to a nicely sized outdoor patio.
“Draco will kiss Harry first, any
“Yeah, a bloody cat that attacks you!”
“Oh, but you are,” he countered seriously, rising up to look at me.
“I suppose once you’ve had your face buried up a man’s arse you’re allowed to use his given name,” he reasoned, “Although Potter does have a certain ring to it. I suppose I’ll use both.”
“I did

“Erm…” he rubbed at the back of his neck and offered me a crooked grin.
I’d shown up at our flat that evening around midnight, accompanied by two officials from the Ministry for Magic, because, yes, there was such a thing, and they’d explained to Malik where I’d been and what had happened to me, and he’d just stared at the three of us, jaw slack like he didn’t know what to even
“And let’s not forget, you started this whole mess by completely disregarding a very important lesson,” he added.
I've embedded a link to the YouTube video in the fic so you can hear what our gang is hearing during the scene (oh, and picture Draco dancing too, you're welcome.)
His eyes widened almost comically as he untangled himself and took the mobile from me.
He shrugged, all adorable and sheepish-like.
I just didn’t know what I

None of it had been real.
“Did he ever find out you were a wizard?” Ginny asked.
Kissing him, hands running up and down his back, one coming to rest behind his head, the other gripping at his perfectly round arse, both trying desperately to press him even more closely against me as we stumbled towards the bed.

“Had some trouble sitting on your broomstick?” Blaise joked, cackling to himself.

“Your Uncle Draco’s told me you’re quite the flyer,” Harry tried again, smiling. “Maybe we can go for a little fly later tonight?”
, and rocked my hips up into him, urging him to get on with this surprise morning shag he’d envisioned.
“I put up a Silencing charm before you got here,” I informed him, laughing, and, quite honestly, delighted that he’d been making that much noise thinking that our neighbours could have heard him.
My attention was called away from Arthur when Draco stood, suddenly.
“He is famous for his
“I don’t think I can handle that every time,” I admitted, honestly.
“I mean, first, you call me adorable,” he accused, arms dropping, twisting to face me so he could smirk at me more
as an array of glasses floated back into the room and into our outstretched hands.
“Yes,” I groaned, eyes sliding shut, my other hand reaching down to grasp at my prick, desperately stroking in time to my fingers being pumped helplessly in and out of his tight arse.

“No offence, Dudley, but I wouldn’t have pegged you for a Shakespear fan.”
“A friend, hmm?” he asked, grabbing a spinach wrap and smirking up at me and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes affectionately.
“And when our friends heard we were going to Paris, they told us
I loved how Hermione’s brain always seemed to
Then what?
Suddenly, Blaise and Ron both paused, heads jerking upright as they both grasped their wands and hastily headed towards the door.
“Make you all but insane with need?” I drove my tongue slowly in and out of his mouth as I ground my hips down into him, excruciatingly slow, groaning as our cocks slid together with my movements.
Draco’s hands trailed lightly down my sides, from my ribcage, slowly down to rest on my hips, thumbs pulling my cheeks apart.
“Emmet and Rhys,” he sniffled, wiping at his eyes as we exited the building and began our walk home.
“Why are your clothes still on?” I complained, choosing to ignore his silky reminder, the fibres of his wool trousers and cashmere sweater tickling and a tad scratchy against my bare skin.
“Nah, that’ll be freezing, this time of year, won’t it?” Ben asked, frowning and wrapping his arms around Malik as though already seeking more warmth.
I allowed my tongue to mimic the motions, and Harry groaned, falling backwards, knowing I would hold him, allowing me to plunder his mouth, everything about him pliant and yielding,
“Good one, Granger,” he praised. “I don’t think my method could have got them on their way any more quickly.”
I desperately wanted to remember so as to be able to work him into a similar passion the next time I wanted a proper fuck without the endless teasing Draco usually seemed to favour.
I had a feeling what he felt a child might need to start a school year “properly” was nowhere to

Harry pauses, mid-row, to reflect on his past month with Draco.
“No.”
“Draco.”
“You Pensieve?” Potter sounded horrified. “You stash you Grindr pulls in a Pensieve?”
He was right, of course.
“Hello, Draco,” Molly said, turning to the blond man and holding out her arms. “So glad you could join us for the holiday!”

“Where’s the alley?” Callum asked, frowning and turning in a circle, eyes seeking any sort of passageway to another world.

“Fuck, Harry,” he mumbled, and I turned to capture his mouth in a brief kiss.
in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Ron finished, wiping his eyes.
The bastard was going to kill me; I was sure of it.
“I’m fine,” I assured him quickly, resuming the slow pace I’d been teasing Harry with moments earlier.
Hermione licked her lips, averting her eyes momentarily before looking back at me.
“Terrified? How would you know? What, you can talk to spiders or something?” I demanded as we continued walking along the path.
“Stalking

I took the bottle from him even as his throat swallowed some amber liquid down and I involuntarily thought of that throat working to swallow something else.
“Bloody hell,” Lupin gasped. “If it’s stories about how cute this one was as a baby you’re after, we’ve got stores of them!”
“Dobby, take Draco to his rooms. He’s not able to join Mummy and Daddy for a proper lunch this afternoon.”

“Then you’ll not be good at potions.”
“Aha,” Ginny cut in, selecting a little tube from the array before her so
I wagged my browns at him suggestively.
I was still turning Violet’s warning over in my mind as we entered the boardroom, and I was so preoccupied I barely
“I assume a redirect charm redirects my thoughts so I’m not asking questions you can’t answer?” I asked, watching as Draco measured out a few drops of the liquid into the potion.
When I had officially moved in a few weeks ago, Kreacher in tow, I’d nearly doubled over in laughter to discover that, instead of downsizing any of his massive wardrobe to make room for mine, Draco had merely added more space to his already enormous closet.
“No, kitten. Patience,” he admonished with a gentle smile, moving to lean against the wall, facing me, and tapping the tip of my nose with his finger to emphasise his point.
to be with me.
“Mmm,” he hummed, pulling off of me briefly.
“Draco, you can keep sending me your patented glares like they mean a shit, or you can tell me about this bloke who’s got you all in a bind,” Blaise informed me, settling once more into his chair.
Well, shit. This wasn’t going to last long.

Bill immediately gained control of the Quaffle, and I had to wonder if his choosing Victoire to begin the match had been more than just a proud father including his daughter.
Harry grimaced again, then grinned up at me.
“Is that why you were such an utter pillock towards me at school?”
, and, well…”
Harry works through his frustration at having been revealed as "Kitten" to their mates followed by breakfast the next morning.
“Kindness and decorum incarnate,” he said finally. “With the perfect amount of cheek and naughty humour thrown in.”
He didn’t respond. Merely kept working my cock as the dildo worked him.

“What was the best food moment of the day?” I asked, holding out the “passion” heart, another white chocolate shell, this time filled with milk chocolate ganache and passion fruit pulp, enrobed in a dark orange shell.
It means they’ll move with you… vibrate, really.
“Ooh… this could get interesting!” I exclaimed, hoping that our time wasted sitting in the pub earlier this afternoon might

“Your cock,” Harry specified, still reaching for his kiss. “Right now.”
“I’m sorry,” he grinned. “I was so worried about that one there,” he jerked his head over in Draco’s direction, “getting huffy cause I was running late, I didn’t even introduce myself.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“Merlin, no wonder your hair is such a damnable wreck,” I scolded.
“I can see your flat,” I informed Draco, leaning back against him and looking out at London sprawled out before us in the golden light of the sunset.
This other guy… well.
I nipped again at a sensitive spot below his ear and allowed my hands to explore the rippling muscles down his back.
“No, I’m serious,” Ron insisted, rubbing at his arm. “I mean, when we were in our early twenties, we just went out and got sloshed all the time, but now that we’re older, and grown-up…” he paused at Hermione’s snort of laughter.
“You utter slag,” Malfoy spat out, left hand twisting in my hair and holding me in place as he began to fuck my mouth, thrusting about a third of the way in. Slowly, teasing me with it.
Draco snorted again and swirled his glass.
“That joke

“I’ve got a wonderful treat for you, once you do find me,” he continued, his voice both teasing me and guiding me.
I took the stack of parchment he offered me, knowing they would be colour-coded and annotated to a degree that even I would find exasperating, and began shuffling through them, eyes glancing up to watch Draco as I did so.
We’d been talking about our favourite books to read as kids.

important, latecomers having to drink?”
I didn’t like those images as much.
“Draco struggles to see the difference, sometimes,” Harry ground out, eyes still latched onto me, and mine on him, my teasing having gone just a tad further and more intimate than I’d meant for it to.
“If you were nice, and decided to share a bite of your dessert with me, you know, just in the interest of learning more about food pairings, I might serve you up your favourite dessert back home.”
“I was wondering if I would ever sell this wand,” he murmured as she grasped it and gave it
“I always get my payback.”

He broke off to laugh softly again as he used his index finger to raise my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze head-on.

“What else needs to get done for tonight, Molly?” Harry asked once the laughter had died down.
“Is that…” I began, taking another lungful of the sweet air. “Are those the flowers?”
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” he all but growled out.

“Well aware,” I assured him.

before he kicked the shit out of me.
“If only these walls could talk.”
I toppled into his lap.
Harry groaned and buried his face in his hands, no doubt imagining the lecture Hermione would be giving him on the dangers of promiscuous sex and being safe.
“What about you?” I asked, wondering if she would bring up Harry not showing the Weasley’s for Sunday lunch.
She had an offer to be an assistant professor at Ilvermorny for a bit and I decided to go with and do some work with the Boston Auror Department.
“Everyone always leaves me like that,” he added quietly, nuzzling into my neck.
Draco frowned.
“Yes, a

I held up my phone and deposited the memory into a new folder I’d labelled “Baby Harry” then held it up for everyone to see.
Other endearing things I was discovering about Draco?
I didn’t even wait a half-second before collapsing against him, arms twining round his neck, mouth seeking his desperately.
“So… being a wizard… it’s kind of like a gene, then? Like, they passed it on to you?”
His smirk deepened.
“Mum, no,” Dudley groaned, putting his teacup down and rubbing at his eyes. “You spoil them rotten. It’s too much.”
While I had yet to have any desire to fuck Draco following our conversation regarding his sexual preferences, I had taken certain liberties on
Draco straightened suddenly and jotted a few notes on his own parchment.
The path circled a lake and there were several benches that lined the path to take a break if needed, and we continued, heading deeper into the tree-covered path, away from the cheerful cherry blossom trees and into a heavily wooded path thick with massive moss-covered trees.

to work, do you?”
“It’s good, hmm?”
She sounded so much like Arthur Weasley that I couldn’t help bursting into laughter.
“Remember back when we were dating? When we took that break to ‘make sure’, or whatever?”
“Me either,” Ben admitted. “I just called him Creeper.”
“Charlie’s takin’ me to some Muggle event,” Hagrid informed Blaise and I, beaming happily.
“Draco, fuck,

Hermione and I,
And then he’d gone fucking nutters when Draco had told him he was a wizard and then Draco had had to Obliviate him.
“Draco,” I whispered.
I considered the Prophet Headlines.
“And, unfortunately for the WAGs, you’d steal all their thunder with your perfect hair and perfect outfit.”
Hermione looked equally distressed and reached out a hand to pat Ron gently on the back while Pansy had her pint paused halfway to her mouth, a look of concern on her face.
“What a slut I can be if left to my own devices?” Harry supplied, taking a sip of tea, and winking.
“In that case, I’d highly suggest you spend some time in the Muggle world, and make a Muggle friend or two,” Draco replied.
“Is the ocean wet?” Blaise replied laughing, and Harry just glared back at all of us even as he shovelled the last of his chocolate-caramel dessert into his mouth.

“No! It’s not that” Ron nearly shouted, standing up on his barstool and leaning towards Draco, arms waving in a non-verbal echo of his words.
They were frightening not only because of their faces, obscured with an almost blinding light so you couldn’t really look at them even though they wore a glamour so that identifying them was impossible, but because you knew your situation was well and truly fucked if one of them showed up.

Fuck.
“What’s a
His eyes flickered over the three of us, landing on me, his expression becoming confused when he met my gaze, as though he hadn't expected me to notice him.
My musings were interrupted as Williams’ appearance began to change, flipping through several glamours.
“You know, with
“So… that’s… erm… George’s?” she whispered quietly, arms wrapping around me and holding me tightly as I nodded, all of us gazing down at Fred, who was doing a goofy dance in his photo,
Malfoy merely chuckled and slung an arm over the back of his barstool, lifting his new pint to his lips.
“He’s just wonderful, Ron,” he sighed, sounding, for all the world, like a lovesick teen.
Now it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes at me.
“No,” he muttered. “Draco just makes me act like one.”
“Still, I am happy for her,” Anaïs informed me, turning sideways and shifting so she could rest her head on my shoulder and curl her legs into my lap.
I couldn’t stop the laughter that bubbled up in my throat at that, and I had to agree with Harry for the moment; there was something almost comical about this entire situation.
I've also started posting this story on Wattpad, so it's worth the re-read if you like pictures! (Seriously, thought, just go to see photos of the Zabinis. I would die to have that as my home. I'm really weird, and have always just loved looking at houses, and floorplans. Like, my grandparents lived near Disneyland and my "treat" if I was good on the car-ride there was that I got to pick out a model/for sale homes to tour with them on the way home the next day? Like, the treat wasn't Disneyland. It was getting to tour houses. WTF is wrong with me?!?!)

“Hmm,” he pretended to ponder, gaze dropping off to the side.

“Never a bad time,” Blaise replied, almost immediately, and I, once again, was bloody glad I hadn’t
around some gorgeous bloke.”
Unsurprisingly, Blaise rattled off a list of events and names that sounded vaguely familiar from our time at Hogwarts, and Pansy fixed him with a withering glance.
She rose then, and we all rose with her.
“Where’d that come from?” Ben asked, watching cautiously as Draco and Blaise each helped themselves to a sandwich.
And with that, they also exited the pub, Blaise and I watching for anyone who might
Well, those ran the gauntlet from adorable and endearing to positively smouldering, and, frankly, I’d been surprised breakfast had lasted as long as it had.
“Would some water help?” Hermione asked, casting an Aguamenti at a glass and raising it carefully to his lips, one hand gently rubbing his shoulder.
However, instead of launching into the details for this evening’s summons, Department Head Bones stood.
“Please, let us know if there is anything you need,” he said, straightening and handing Draco the key before turning and shutting the door behind him.
“Bessie.”
I glanced at Harry, as did everyone else, seeing what his reaction to Draco’s rather callous description of Tristan would be.

“Harry,” he’d sighed, pulling me even closer somehow.

The rest of the meal continued, Alice begging Draco for his chicken fricassée recipe after Dudley and all three children declared it delicious.

“Can you imagine, Harry,” I whispered into his ear, gently easing the dildo out of his mouth, the bastard sucking hard as he could to draw it back in despite my efforts.
“So I have to keep
“Yes, erm… he does… tend to leave them all over the place,” he admitted, rubbing at the back of his neck and smiling down at Bessie ruefully.
Honestly, did Williams think at all?
Right.
“My condolences… imagine, relying on the likes of Blaise to stay alive…”
“Mmrph!” I protested as Harry flipped me onto my back and I found my own hands bound above me, stuck to the headboard as though bound with iron.
Malfoy’s hand continued carding through my hair, watching my ragged breathing slow as my head followed and nuzzled into him like an attention-starved kitten. Living up to his little pet name, because of
Fuck.
“Where are we?” Hermione asked, frowning as we made our way to the restaurant, festooned in twinkling lights and an array of Christmas trees and wreaths for the holidays.
“Harry,” I sighed, hands trailing lovingly down the backs of his thighs, then back up to spread him wider as he pressed back into my palms once more.

responsibility? I have to take care of him?”
Draco, I noted, did the same.
Why hadn’t I thought of that?
“Well, then you really ought not to get a Niffler,” I sniggered, and Violet grinned and giggled up at me, clearly imagining her Mum and Dad trying to explain the drawerful of shiny things that had mysteriously turned up in their home.
“You wish,” I replied, amazed at how we'd both remembered that stupid banter before our very first duel.
“You probably should
I couldn’t have hoped for a better turn of events. Honestly.
“Harry,” Blaise said suddenly, as though sensing danger and changing the topic as quickly as possible. “That was a brilliant game last match.”
“Oh, it’s a fortune-telling game,” I explained. “You take the apple peel and throw it over your shoulder and whatever letter it forms
“You know we — your parents, Harry, Hermione, and I — will do the same for your talents once you’re on your way to Hogwarts.”
I only know that when I opened my eyes, Harry’s were blinking up at me, a sleepy, content smile on his face, and I just had to bend my head down to brush his lips with my own.
“Arrogant,” Harry tossed out, smirking at each of the three Slytherins
“Which is entirely false,” he added, sucking down again, cheeks hollowing as he slowly slid back up, and it took me a second to even remember what he was blabbing on about.
“Yeah. I can,” I retorted, having now managed to do up my trousers and having begun the search for my trainers. I located them and launched myself in their general direction, crashing to the ground and cramming my feet into them. There was no time to undo the laces and get them on properly, you realise.
“My mirror likes you,” Malfoy informed me, smirking down at me as he appeared in the doorway just to the left of the console, presumably coming from the kitchen, seeing as he was holding two glasses of wine, one stretched out towards me.
“It hits you with a
“I suppose once you’ve had your face buried up a man’s arse you’re allowed to use his given name,” I offered.
Draco paused to glare at me as he grabbed a raspberry-lemon cake from the tray and took a bite.
“And before you even put that fork of yours near the caviar, don’t,” Draco warned, sitting up and reaching for the little bowl and that silly little pearlescent spoon set beside it.
“I was sure you were going to hex the actual dick off of that bloke,” Blaise admitted.
I mean the most ridiculous, contorted faces you could imagine, and the fact that he would pull them out of absolutely nowhere.

I obliged, then noticed some with orange marmalade and Cointreau, and decided we ought to try one of those
I laughed.
“What’d I tell you, Potter?” I sing-songed under my breath, tucking his arm into the crook of my elbow and pulling him close.

I closed my eyes and could almost taste the gooey egg yolks running over the crispy bacon and generous spread of avocado that could chase the deadliest of post-night-out maladies away.
A woman came along the queue shortly and asked the couple in front of us for their order.
“I admit, though, I was a bit startled meself when I saw the article in the Prophet,” Hagrid admitted with a rueful shake of his head.
“Nobody,” Bones’ voice boomed back immediately, and Williams and I both started and stared at her.
“Harry! So wonderful to see you again!”
Thinking and planning your next words and actions and being ahead by about three moves, like a massive, live-action chess match.
“I admit someone probably ought to have warned you not to fuck with anyone I care about,” he informed us, placing a kiss atop Harry’s head.
“You’re especially eager tonight,” he commented, sliding his finger back in, then out.
Our drinks, I noted, had
“Mmm,” he groaned, mouth returning to lick at a stray crumb balanced on the tip of my thumb, and just like that, all thoughts of past relationships and any other blokes flew from my mind, and, probably also partly in thanks to the tipsy tea, my brain’s sole focus became getting Harry back to my flat and into my bed.
“Mr Ollivander?” Hermione asked
“No, thank you. I can prepare most of it on my own. I only need Draco’s help for the potion, and we’ll just hope he is back in time.”
I’d sat up and stretched, glancing down at Draco and wincing at the reddish-purple marks dotting his collarbone looking almost like a garish necklace, vivid red scratch marks running down his back, and even a faint bruise around his hipbone where my legs had, apparently, squeezed a little too tightly last night.
I gave another questioning glance across the coffee table at Ron who shrugged and made an “I have no idea” face.
irritated, and finally amused while living in Boston at this quirky American habit of striking up a conversation wherever one went.
It looked as though he could, and did, often gather a party of six around his table for languid dinners that stretched over hours, bottles of wine being passed while the group bantered and conversed long into the night.
He threw the ball to Ginny who caught the Quaffle and rounded on Ron who was circling our goalposts,
“Because I won’t need them off

There are several types of thought: thought that is belief, thought that is desire, thought that is intention.
That’s why I’m asking.
“You look wonderful. And I would certainly tell you if I thought otherwise,” she assured him.
I fixed him with my most patented Malfoy glare, hoping the fool would understand that he was treading dangerous waters.
“They’re lighting the bonfire now,” she said excitedly. “We’ll do the ceremony soon. Your mother
“I don’t know why you want to hurt me,” I sniffled, wiping the back of my hand across my nose, not even caring what I looked like or the fact that probably every Malfoy to have ever existed had just shuddered in their tombs, because had the reigning Lord Malfoy

“Mmmm,” he groaned, this time, apparently much in-need of a good scalp massage. I was willing to bet Potter didn’t even sort of massage his scalp when he washed his hair. He probably just squirted some shampoo onto his head and sort of lathered it up then rinsed.
Harry seemed to understand my disappointment because he was grinning up at me, those damned eyes of his laughing at me silently.
I reached out and gently tilted his chin up, met by those incredible eyes, looking a bit suspicious. I smiled down at Harry indulgently.
Draco gestured angrily at his crotch where his cock stood out, red and dripping, just waiting for a greedy mouth or arse to swallow it.
I could hear rummaging and objects being lifted and dropped in the background.
“You know, to make sure…” he paused and bit his lip. “I mean, we wouldn’t want to open the space up to anything unwelcome…..”
When had my boyfriend become such a snarky bundle of sass?
“Actually, I’m not sure we’ve been on a proper date,” he mused.
“Tarte
“What have you been up to, you know, since the... erm... you know, since...” he managed.
“Well, now, we’ve got to invite Harry, seeing as he’s gone and trained himself his own dragon,” Charlie reasoned, glancing over at me.
I stilled at that, worried.
I managed to harden my glare and shake my head indignantly, nevermind the fact that Draco was now sliding said dildo in and out of my mouth easily, fucking my face with it, me accepting it just as willingly as if it
The other was… well… it wasn’t
This, he explained, would give us ten of the chef’s top choices of nigiri — the little sushi with the slab of fresh fish laid atop a bed of rice, as opposed to the rolls many people envisioned when thinking of sushi — plus a maki roll, a slice of tamago omelette, and miso soup.
I shot my hand out again to catch the second bottle, tossing it to follow the first, then summoned two glasses from the minibar to join them, setting them all on the table, wandlessly clicking the door shut as I sauntered over to settle myself on the couch, aiming my wand to uncork both bottles.
We spent the next forty minutes or so pedalling around the lake, sipping our “water,” and people-watching.
“Lo,” I greeted them, straddling the bench and scooting up so that Harry was leaning back against me. “Hope I’m not interrupting.”
“And what?” Harry asked, frowning around a mouthful of scone.
“Yours,” he gasped, limbs tightening around me.
“Almost another lifetime, one could say.”
“Right, thank Merlin,” Harry retorted, grinning back. “I might have been left like a damsel in fucking distress without you two.”
But I didn’t get it.
He paused, and it felt as though he was looking right into the depths of my very soul and my eyes squeezed shut despite my anger.

I just stared at him.
Draco can't concentrate at work and an exasperated Hermione insists on a lunch break.
“Sure,” she agreed. “But whenever you talk about him, you look positively happy.”
It was the weekend after Samhain so, naturally, we were discussing what each of us had done over the holiday.
The fact that Harry was my literal world and that there was very little that mattered outside of keeping him safe, and happy, and loved.
Draco continued dancing and singing along, and even I had to snigger at the lewd look he threw at Harry, who just rolled his eyes while taking a sip from his pint.

And while I enjoyed seeing Hiccup, now with his own prosthetic leg, with Toothless and Astrid leading the little village into a new dragon-loving era, I couldn’t help but notice that Harry and Ron, now sharing a sofa, looked anything but thrilled with the way their evening had ended.

moments while Spencer shook out a few Galleons.
“Draco,” he managed, mouth attached to mine.
“Everything’s fine,” I assured him, tugging his hand and urging him to sit back down beside me as I took a seat on the sofa.
“Draco,” he moaned, pushing up against me, hips grinding shamelessly.
And Hermione and Ron.

“I’d like to see it next time,” I told him truthfully, and not just because I wanted to make sure I wasn’t carelessly thrown over a banister or up against a

“A very high-class one.”

I almost laughed, thinking back to the first time we’d fucked, compliments of Grindr, how lucky I’d thought myself, able to live out my schoolboy fantasies for just one evening.
Get used to it, Potter, I thought to myself, wrapping my arms around him.
“You don’t like corned beef?” Harry’s boyfriend asked Ron as we all began piling sandwich quarters, dabs of mustard, and pickles onto our plates.
Right.
Harry stopped in his tracks, the three teacups and the plate of cream and jam balanced in his hands.
“Fuck. You.” I managed as a fresh wave of tears spilt over because he was a right bastard for making me look at his beautiful green eyes right now.
I faltered. “I mean, what makes the Muggle police force think this has something to do with the Erised case if there are no wizards involved?”
“Bloody hell,” Ron agreed, taking a larger sip. “That

His smile faltered when he saw me, but then he gave a quick shake his head and grinned knowingly, looking between Harry and I.
I took the proffered towel, delighted to learn that it was nice and warm with a pleasant herbal fragrance coming off of it.
Draco set down his quill and stretched, thinking for a minute.
“First, you’re going to get me good and ready for you,” he sighed, body arching up into mine.
“Have you put one on yours? And Ron’s?” he asked, eyes snapping in my direction, any joking or taunting aside. “Just to be sure? I mean, you never know.”
All of my carefully constructed plans.
“Aww, Sweet Pea, don’t stare at me like that,” he begged, and I glanced at Blaise, mouthing yet another of Ben’s endearments with a questioning look.
I just continued grinning, sipping my tea, and watched as he added the green onions and fried egg to the top of the pancakes.
Broken plates and glasses littered the floor and the lights were out.
“How are you?” Harry asked softly, and I felt like an idiot.
“Of course we’re going, but we need to figure out where we’re going

thinking.
We arrived at number seventeen moments later, heading down the stairs to the entry of Pansy’s lower ground-floor flat.
I returned my attention back to Draco and Blaise, wrapping up their rendition of Under Pressure, and allowed myself a small smile.
“I mean, he’s not doing anything weird or all that suspect,” Harry continued.

“Well, they’re famous for trench coats.”
“That someone has their mouth on you here,”
The last time I’d really seen him was at his trial before the Wizengamot following the war. I’d testified to help clear both his and his mother’s name.
“That’s what mums are for,” I replied, stepping away so that he could
Draco thought for a minute.
“I didn’t know you still had a thing for him,” Blaise observed, taking a sip, and I just about murdered the ignorant arse with my eyes. “I mean, I know you were all but obsessed at Hogwarts but that was ages ago.”

“What’s it taste like?” Connie asked.
More laughter, then Pansy spoke up.
I smiled to myself at the thoughtful advice tidbit and opened the first of the three photos with anticipation.
“Is this where they show it?” he asked, frowning down at Micah, then glancing back over at the poster, his brow furrowed.
“Oh, no. I grew up in the Wizard world.”

And it’s not like that crummy studio he’d been living in gave anything away.

“What the bloody fuck do you two think you’re doing?!” he shouted, grabbing the device from Blaise’s hand, spinning round to face us, lights flickering dangerously once more.
And be fucking adorable.
all topped with
Several minutes later, I was once again rinsing shampoo from Harry’s hair, looking down at his handsome face, smiling blissfully as the warm water and my hands made their way through his locks.
We continued, hips snapping together in a frantic rhythm, the sound of skin meeting skin echoing throughout the room and I knew release wasn’t far off for either of us.
Uh-oh. This wasn’t good.
“Hermione, what do you

I paused, giving him some time to collect his thoughts and talk properly.
“Erm…” I reached up and scratched the back of my neck. “I dunno.”
“Are you going to carry me?” he asked with another groan as he fell backwards to clutch at his stomach again.
I knew Draco well enough by now to know that he wasn’t asking out of curiosity, but

She paused at both
“Because he’s secretly in love with you but hasn’t figured out how to tell you,” Draco dead-panned, taking another dainty bite of his own pie.
He paused, then turned to his wife, flinging his arms around her and leaning nearly all of his weight into her side, the perfect parody of a

we needed to be closer.
“You remember that, don’t you, Harry?” he asked, a soft smile curving his lips as he moved to stand behind me again, hands running down my sides once more.
,” I suggested silkily, leaning down to brush his lips with my own, delighting in the way his eyes immediately slid shut and the way he leant forward, looking to deepen the kiss and chasing my lips with his own as I pulled away.
“I wanted to watch the sunset, and this is the closest good-sunset spot to where dinner is,” he explained, leaning down as I rose on my tip-toes to rub his nose gently with mine.
“That’s classic,” I laughed. “Any of my mates with kids complain about finding deposits of disliked veg all over the place.”
I glanced away to my left, vaguely aware that I was licking my lips nervously as my hand’s reached for Harry’s, oddly seeking their comfort, even though Harry himself was the cause of my current melodramatic anxiety.
“You know, I think, if I ever need to describe Draco’s profession ever again, I’m borrowing that.”
It was a short, fifteen-minute walk from Draco’s flat to Hush Mayfair, one of his favourite breakfast spots in the area.
“Draco,” I murmured, sliding beneath the duvet and seeking
“Well, what is it that you do?”
“Shh, love,” I soothed, lifting one hand to caress his cheek as I smiled down at him.
“Harry, pet,” I sighed, lowering my mouth to his again, tangling my tongue with his.
“Could you get together a small bet for then? We’re all going to see a Muggle movie. You should come, too.”
Harry continued to grind up into my slowing fist, legs still wrapped tightly around me, and I dragged my mouth from his, ignoring his cry of protest, to latch on to his neck, deepening the purple mark I’d begun earlier.
he swallowed visibly. “Do you have any fucking
Our walk and pedal around the lake burned up another two hours of wait time, and by the time we’d returned the swan boat, Draco insisted it was time for second breakfast.
“Now you’re speaking my language, Malfoy,” I replied, rubbing my hands together. “What’ve they got at that bar downstairs?”

Those grey-blue eyes slid open, and he grinned lazily at me.
Next thing I knew, I felt
“Do you mean to tell me
“Darling, you keep saying that, yet you keep asking me for lube or leaving subtle hints like those flowers strewn about like I’m not supposed to get my interest piqued.”
I just groaned in response and pushed down harder. I mean, if he had me pegged, why argue?
“Anyway,” I said pointedly, looking through my own notes. “We’ve another meeting with Davies and Williams this morning. Since you’re of the opinion that the information they provided last time wasn't all that helpful, is there anything, in particular, you’d like for us to discuss today?”
I knew that Ginny’s brother, George’s twin, had died when he’d been
“Why did you say no?” Blaise was laughing as well, but apparently this was allowed in Pansy’s book of rules. “I mean, they had a point, it was the Cannons. Robins surely could

I mean, look where I grew up and how I’d almost turned out.
“You may go, gentlemen,” my mother assured them. “Thank you.”
I was also sure my best mates and Draco’s work partner would murder us both if they ever found out.
“Sure, I can.”
I set the bag on the coffee table, still not meeting his gaze.
“But fear not, we’re going to get that mother…” her eyes darted towards Hugo and Manon, both listening with rapt attention.
He frowned slightly, as though he hadn’t realised it either, then shrugged.
We continued, skirting around Waterloo Station, our conversation turning to life after the war and what Draco had done to occupy himself while awaiting the trials.
One of them shook their head and walked over to where Williams and I stood.
“I erased his memory,” Draco replied.
“Fuck, I love you like this,” Draco informed me, fastening his mouth around me, licking and slurping into me, and how could I
“Your mobiles won’t work. I made sure of that before I walked in.”
“Being forced to see all these people he hated and belittled for years, all content and living their lives.”
“Draco,” he sighed. “Please.”
he watched my hand, fingers barely meeting around its thick length, gliding up and down, slicking pre-cum up and down the shaft.
They were really putting on a show, strutting, and singing, and being silly, and just unrepentantly un-Slytherin like as possible, and I couldn’t help but think back to one of my favourite conversations with Fred.
Last thing I needed was Hermione watching Harry or me too closely. She was too sharp, that one.
Because I hadn’t thought to protect Harry’s mobile until after both events Williams was referring to — when I'd accidentally answered Hermione’s call that time Harry had skipped out on Sunday lunch.

Honestly, it was still new for me – this feeling of disappointment and anxiousness whenever the Ministry summoned me.
I hunker up to the railing overlooking the river, joining other Londoners and tourists alike gathered for an early evening stroll, and pull out a pack of crumpled cigarettes.
“Maybe because it’s me?” I asked, allowing myself to look up at him, tongue and mouth still licking him, sucking him, kissing him.
“So then what?”
A short while later I was seated at the table unpacking a bag of savoury curry, plates and cutlery zooming towards me from the kitchen.
I pulled a face at Ron but didn’t comment as I took a sip of my pint.

“Right,” Harry muttered, a tiny grin on his face. “No one here would think that odd… me skipping out on an opportunity to play Quidditch or fly.”

Gods, why was I always so quick to vanish or tear his clothing away instead of unwrapping him slowly like the delightful gift that he was.
Draco’s lower lip quivered quite convincingly as the tears welling up in his eyes threatened to spill over once more.

Deliciously. The way he would like.
Draco’s eyes were sparkling with glee and he raised a hand to trace gently along my cheekbones.
A petite woman was making her way into the frame now, laughing and swishing a wand at Haru to clean him up.
I hadn’t even realised that my jaw had dropped and the rest of my face had morphed into a ridiculously pleased, gigantic expression of delight until everyone burst out laughing and Hermione said:
“Shh,” I soothed, pulling away gently, hands running down his sides, smoothing down his legs, still wrapped around me.
by Micah piping up.
What it would mean for her if Draco had actually been evil all along and was now showing his true colours.
Holy fuck.
It worked and Draco allowed himself a small laugh as he took another bite of his eggs and salmon.
“I know,” I agreed. “I don’t think she realised… erm… you know…”
“You’d probably butcher the pronunciation on half of them.”
Okay, so… erm... Ginny and I were married and awkward for a couple of years.
Who knew what Hermione and Draco were up to?
My mind flashed back to our first meeting, months ago, at the Henrietta Hotel.
“No,” I replied. “But… at the pub last night, erm… Ben showed up. He’s
Finally, Draco sighed and shut both his laptop and the giant book, sending all whizzing around the corner and down the hallway, as he rubbed tiredly at his eyes.
Sure, I’d seen Aunt Petunia bustling around the kitchen before I got banished to my room
“Damn, clearly I’ve some catching up to do with all you lot,” I observed.
Honestly, Hermione should have had better faith in her “training” skills, I thought to myself with a snort of laughter.
He’d been a sad, scrawny thing, swimming in his clothes, sporting those ridiculous round glasses that were always either falling off or broken. And we were supposed to believe that this tiny child was going to deliver us from the Dark Lord?
“You what?” I demanded incredulously, sitting upright and leaning in towards him.
“And… you put the app on Draco’s phone that one night when we were all at the pub?”
Could you imagine Granger and I, heading out for a pint? She, with her permanent sidekicks, The-Boy-Who-Lived and, now, husband Ron.
You were within my grasp, or so I thought.
“You… didn’t take so well to me being a wizard.”
I stopped and frowned down at him.
Don’t get me wrong, there were a lot of excellent Seekers out there who could

“I will,” I added, bending my face down to his wild mane to inhale deeply. “You know that.”

It was nearly four o’clock, and I’d been back at the flat for a few hours now, having finally sort of convinced myself that what Draco and I had was special and whatever he’d had with Ben could go fuck itself.
He popped off and swirled his tongue around my head again.
“Are you offering to owl her for me, or something?” he asked innocently, eyes finally meeting mine again, and it took every ounce of my willpower not to burst out laughing.
“Really?” Draco looked incredulous, and I felt my ire growing as I remembered how my poor Duddy had been speechless and terrified when Harry had brought him back that day.
“Merlin, you’re even better than I could have possibly imagined. Look at you, fucking yourself on my fingers.”

“No,” Draco replied and Blaise’s grin deepened.

“I asked my co-worker this morning to see if we had any of these left from a demonstration we did a few years back,” he explained, shaking out the shirt and holding it up for us to see.
“I mean, could you just say, you know, next time something odd happens, that stuff like that used to happen with me? Then it might be easier to tell her when we’re all together, meeting up for the first time?”
“I don’t see how me watching is going to help that,” he replied quietly, all of his adorable, somehow-innocent, uncertainty returning.
“Although… I bet you could work out a sweet deal with one of their Quidditch teams,” he added with a grin as we mounted the stairs and exited into the bright sunlight.
“I think they probably see it as much more than that, Mione,” I sighed. “It's an

“It’s like you appeared out of nowhere,” I gasped, and Harry smirked.
“I really appreciate the dietary inclusion,” Malik said with a grin.
Occasionally, another idiot moron tried to use it for personal gain, totally ignoring the carefully worded warning that came with each purchase.
“You’re a right poncy prat, you know that?”
His brows shot up at that.
,” he continued, bracing one hand on either side of my head as he leaned down to whisper his next words in my ear, just before dipping his head down to suck and lap at the mark on my neck from last night.
“Hands off. You’re going to cum from just my cock fucking you wide open, aren’t you? I want to feel this sweet arse of yours clenching around me and hear you scream in absolute bliss knowing it was just. My. Cock.”
He shook his head, eyes blinking shyly away from our reflection in the mirror.
Draco just laughed and withdrew his finger to give my arse another swat.
“How do you two manage both of them with work and Anaïs travelling and all?” Ron asked, frowning.
“He’s going to talk about Quidditch!”
Draco and Harry meet up with Japanese Samurai (aka Unspeakable), Toshio Musashi to investigate the area where Melanie Duncan, an English witch, was discovered mutilated.
I won’t allow it.
“Eager, hmm?” I teased, licking a slow stripe up his cock, eyes locked on his face with his eyes squinched up tightly.
“She got called into work. Early.”
“I mean,” I began, then frowned.
I don’t know what Draco did to earn another smack from Pansy, but he flinched suddenly and rubbed at his hand.
Alley again, too. I'm sure I'll pick up a ton of information there.”
Ron frowned.
“How is this advice?” Draco asked, frowning.
Excuse No. 1: I don't know why, but it seems to me any and all scenes involving Diagon Alley are ridiculously long? So I had to do the same?
“You already told me you wanted it slow,” I reminded him, fingers dipping slowly into him, twirling as they slid all the way in, working again on the slow slide out.
“I hadn’t realized that it sounds like people are talking out loud.”
I smirked as I raised my hands to knead along Potter’s shoulders, working at some knots there before working my thumbs up one side of his neck then the other.
Draco immediately pulled Harry closer, nuzzling his hair, and inhaling deeply, as though he’d been longing to hold him all evening, and any tiny fear I might have had that Draco was harbouring romantic feelings towards his ex vanished.
“There are

“So, Coach says you’re not playing, you, being the head-strong, stubborn git that you are, kept insisting that you are,” Pansy summarised. I nodded. “You’re not finished with this story until you tell us how you convinced the team to let you play.”
“And I have other photos,” Mum assured him, the two of them seeming to have come to a tacit agreement to ignore my squawks of protest.
Once we were back at the hotel, Harry immediately shrank his purchases and placed them carefully inside of his weekender, as though he
When Potter and I finally found ourselves lounging on the couch, wrapped in the Henrietta’s comfy bathrobes, the wine had definitely had well over thirty minutes to breathe. I poured us each a glass of the cab and handed Harry a glass.
This is what I loved about the school.
Another smooth, calculated thrust into me that had me responding exactly how he wanted, I was sure.

“Oh,” I couldn’t even remember what scene had been outside last time I’d brought him here. Truth be told, I didn’t want to remember much of what had happened last time. “Yeah, erm, it’s just scenery from places I like,” I explained. “They change randomly. Kind of like a laptop screensaver.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” she apologised, still giggling a bit. “But that look was absolutely classic Draco.”
“Merlin, no Draco,” he tried again. “Absolutely not. Sit up, come on.”
“Potter,” I sputtered, setting my mug back on the table. “What…”

“Let something slip?”
“So Harry
She rolled her eyes as she took her seat, graciously accepting the glass offered to her.
What else had he told them?
“He’s right, you know.”
A short while later, Harry and I had left the shop, goodies in tow, following the route past the ornate Hôtel de Ville and across the Pont Saint-Michel that Pierre-Yves had suggested.
“But…
Little pink flowers that reminded me of the cherry blossoms in the park alternately floated and drowned in and around the two creatures and the tumultuous sea, and though I didn’t know much about tattoos, I had to agree that Hatsue was an incredible artist.
I set my left leg on the floor and twisted up out of his lap, then turned to gaze down on him, wondering what sort of wine would suit him best.
cute because Ron finally had the finances to shower Hermione with presents and weekend getaways, and even though Hermione, ever the practical one, pretended to complain and insist that they shouldn’t spend their money so frivolously, the sparkle in her eyes always said otherwise.

I nodded, still buried in his neck.
“Shut up,” I muttered, knowing it was no

“You’re a Gryffindor,” I tried again, hoping to reinstate our ancient house rivalry.
Again, could you imagine if I’d been sent to a nursery school like this?
“Harry and Draco know what they’re doing, and Harry doesn’t need us poking our nose into their business.”
“Really,” eight voices echoed back, and I grinned.
he turned from the cupboard, crossing the distance between us in a few short strides to stare down at Vernon and me.
The obvious solution was to message Potter.
Honestly, had I not been in such a state on account of the two dildos fucking themselves into me, I probably would have laughed and teased him mercilessly.
“Made me tea and tucked me into his guest bed.”
The twenty-minute wait passed in almost no time, and soon, Harry and I were seated at the u-shaped counter, where we could watch the show close-up.

I’d assumed since Ginny was a teacher, the first time we met up with some of her work colleagues, it’d be a water-only affair.
She rolled her eyes.
“That was Ben, right?” Harry asked and Draco nodded.
Draco responded first, throwing his head back to let out a huge guffaw.
He held his hand out
“Creamy,” Draco replied, frowning as he tried to describe the flavour.
He leaned in, clearly wanting more, but I just rolled off and flopped onto my back beside him.
“That was weird,” Ron mused. “What do you suppose that was all about?”
“Why do you keep calling it tipsy tea?” he asked.
“You know Mummy and Daddy love you and want to make sure you’re getting all the nutrients you need to grow into a big, strong wizard when you grow up.”
What mattered was that, right now, Draco was furious.

But someone, please explain to me why one’s body produced snot in quintuple fold when one was crying ugly tears?

about tardiness.”
“So, Harry, dear,” she smiled at him, resting her chin on her clasped hands and leaning towards him. “What have you been up to since we last met? And I don’t mean all that drivel they insist on printing in the Prophet, mind.”
I reached out to pull Harry towards me, cupping his face in my hands.
I stared at her, mouth slightly open, before bursting out laughing.
The pâté was
He paused and glanced up at me again.
Violet stopped trying to run and turned her little face up to me to smile sheepishly.
I couldn’t stifle the moan I made then and Draco smirked back at me, removing his hand from the dildo, magic taking over so it continued to fuck gently in and out of my mouth on its own.
“I’m not trying to do anything,” he insisted, still managing to continue kissing me and I could feel his arms straining as he tried, yet again, to lift his hands against the magical bonds I’d cast on him.
“We’re, uh, here to see Draco Malfoy,” I informed him, reaching into my pocket to grab my cell phone, where I’d stashed his flat number.
“Loads of students are, and me growing up wizard doesn’t seem to have helped me much at all.”

Just not when I’d been expecting it, and so instead of my perfect introduction, I’d stammered out:

Seriously, though. What the fuck else was I supposed to have done?
How the fuck was
Was this the new version of Tokyo’s Diagon Alley I wondered?
“Oh, I’m sorry,” I teased. “Didn’t mean to disappoint you, ringing without my boyfriend.”
Not to mention, I reasoned to myself, snuggling deeper into Harry’s sweet scent, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t absolutely looking forward to our next meeting after an extended absence.
Harry and I," I muttered, almost under my breath. "Holed up in that tiny London flat with nothing to do but antagonise each other all day long…
He shrugged and rolled his eyes.
He gave a final lick from my balls and up to suck gently at my hole before I felt the tip of his finger circling it gently. I pressed back against it, already so relaxed from Malfoy’s expert mouth, and felt him push through the tight ring of muscle.
“So, Potter,” Pansy continued, taking a drag from a cigarette. Apparently she was also a fan of the Muggle habit. “Aside from all that nonsense drivel the Prophet prints, what have you been up to?”
“Well,” Draco continued, hand rubbing soothing circles across Harry’s back.
“Then I suppose it’s a good thing we’re not in public, hmm?”
“I mean, I

How did he do that?
Merlin, had he never heard of gender-neutral pronouns? We had no idea if this person was male or female, or honestly, at this point, even human.
“Draco,” I gasped, still chuckling. “Do you really think the fucking Dursleys were dressing me in prepubescent Burberry before I went to Hogwarts?
It did?
My mobile pinged suddenly, and I glanced down to see a response from Ron.
“Erm… yeah, he can certainly be intimidating when he wants to be,” I admitted.
He rose and made to pull his wallet from his pocket.

the Bludger again and scored, giving a whoop of excitement as he did a quick victory loop, sticking his tongue out at Charlie as he did so.
“Gods, you’re fucking tight, Potter,” he muttered, and I wished I could see his face right now because I’m sure his eyes were closed and I’m sure he might look as lust-blown as I did.
“Erm… you caught that, eh?” I joked, reaching for my own sandwich.
I tried pushing back to hurry him along and the fucking asshole placed his hands on both my hips to hold me steady as he continued to push in about halfway.

that both were fine.
“Sure, okay,” I agreed as we queued up, even though I was pretty sure there was no such rule.
I watched, mesmerised, as he plucked at his left nipple, back arching off the bed, a quiet moan escaping his mouth, while his other hand reached down, fingertips barely touching his cock, trailing up and down lightly.
“You’re not allowed to go another three days without fucking me senseless ever again,” he informed me.
Draco was halfway across the room at this point, and he turned to look at me.
“Erm… yeah,” he affirmed, giving me a tiny smile.
“No,” he assured me.
“Need a hand, Potter?” I asked, palming my own cock through my trousers.
“Something
He could make me feel embarrassed yet brazen; like a cheap whore yet somehow more cherished than a vault full of rubies; on display, begging to be used yet utterly relaxed and content.
And he had suggested well, judging by Harry’s wide-eyed stare at all the buildings as we made our way across the river to the Left Bank to the rue Saint-André-des-Arts, a small, bustling street full of little bars, restaurants, and take-away kebab and falafel shops that led us to our next stop:
“I… erm… really did find some interesting facts last night,” he went on, eyes glancing tentatively at me as though worried I might actually be upset.
“Erm…”
Oh, was I done for now.
say if only his Hogwarts four-poster could talk….”
“Because I know how much you enjoy working me open,” I sighed, allowing my head to roll back, because, fuck, sometimes fucking yourself open on your own fingers whilst your boyfriend looked on in dazed awe was something special, wasn’t it?
For once.
“We’re trying to make sure Pansy doesn’t hex that poor bloke across the way who keeps making eyes at her,” Hermione replied. “She’s all but murdered him with her stare, but he doesn’t seem to understand.”
“If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight, it’s none of your business!”
“I suppose it could
How Pansy had this innate ability to convince any witch or wizard to do her bidding, I’ll never know, but Potter rose immediately and headed towards the bar as commanded.
There was a pause, then:
“Yeah,” I replied, not

Ben nodded and reached for a sandwich at last, still seeming hesitant.

As for her lady, Micah, she was just about the sweetest girl I’d ever met.
“Oh.”
“What did you do?”
“Well,” he drawled, sipping his own glass of wine and I sat up eagerly, glad to be of use, or soon to be, anyway.
I took a deep breath, rolled my head to crack my neck a bit, then raised my hand to knock. He’d said 20h sharp, after all.
“Oh, so it’s going to be like that, hmm?” Harry challenged, pulling away from Draco and glaring up at him.
Potter groaned and arched his back even more, never relenting the pace his mouth had set as he continued to work up and down my length, the vibrations from his groans only serving to drive me wilder.

“What?” he sounded embarrassed, for some reason, as though having such a pretty, pink arsehole were a bad thing.
to wait around at the hotel or if he could wait at home.
I glanced back down at my cock, still hard and demanding attention, despite the comedic lull in our morning fondling session, then back at Malfoy, who was leaning in the bathroom doorway smirking back at me.
“What’s dashi?” I asked, leaning around the partition to see what Draco was doing on his order form.
I just rolled my eyes and opened her App store and began scanning the purchases, looking for the date the “meditation” app had downloaded into her mobile.
Harry hissed, eyes returning to Draco, all but shooting fire.
"I said I’ll play nicely!
“Do you think all blonds look alike?” I asked, genuinely curious. “I mean, with that logic, you might as well have tried making your glamour look like me.”
“Sure, let me go get it,” Draco agreed, then paused.
“The research gets done.”
“I don’t need any stupid app to find a bloke, Hermione,” I huffed.
He smirked, releasing the lamp and sending it back over to the end table nearest me.
Not really. Doesn’t do much to fret before a match. Just hoping Campbell and McFarland don’t do something stupid like go out tomorrow night.

And the cabbage?
He glanced at the table, and, seeing that it was empty, continued his path outside, where he set the plate and teacups down.
like blonds,” he replied finally with a smirk and Harry groaned, resting his forehead in his palm.
You bought a round for the entire group, then someone else got the next round, and someone else the next.
I straightened and glanced over to find Malfoy, thankfully unglamoured and back to his youthful, gorgeous self, staring at me apprehensively.
It was the first time I’d said it aloud.
This could not be happening.
By the time
“You know, Malfoy,” he snapped, those eyes flashing. “The one spell I might maybe need you to help out with when I’ve had a fucking dildo up my arse all night and no idea how to make it work on its own,” he finished, chest heaving slightly.
“Micah and Ginny,” I called out quickly as Draco’s hand reached for the doorknob, throwing a five-pound note on the table, figuring they couldn’t be betting a

“No, it’s just, we placed bets on who was going to be at the door, but it’s all four of you, so no one wins,” Harry explained, standing and waving a hand at the dining table and…
“Honestly, I’m still getting over the fact that Harry has a crush on you,” Hermione still looked stunned, her plate of fennel and Berkswell cheese all but forgotten.
He glanced over to me, then back at Vernon, a pleased smile curving his lips.
“I mean, I
“When did you eat corned beef growing up at the manor?” Ron asked, dipping his sandwich uncertainly in some mustard and taking a (very) reluctant bite.
Malfoy’s back remained to me as he massaged shampoo into his shining locks, working it into a lather.

Another, much larger part of my brain recognised by the way the sun was slanting in through the window that I was probably already late.
Okay, I thought, catching Michaels’ eyes and a brief tug of a knowing smile at his lips, maybe I had actually rolled my eyes.
He grabbed hold of my face and held me so my gaze was locked on his, hips stilling momentarily to ensure I was giving him my full attention.
Also, the first time she’d asked me to pass her the “Philadelphia,” which, you
“I want both,” he decided, frowning impatiently as I watched him from between his thighs.
Now and then his brow would furrow and he would lean forward, grabbing his pile of parchment and shuffling excitedly through it, checking some notes with whatever new information he’d discovered and annotating accordingly.
He was… he was the first victim of

by then.”
“I know they say it’s not a choice anymore, but I can’t help but wonder if they both did it for the publicity. Neither has known a life outside of it, you realise….”
“There’ll be no crying tonight,” he informed them.
“No?”
He took a few moments to compose himself then rolled his head over to look at me, still sniggering.
Perfect BJ mouth, his profile had said, and I’d be lying if I said I’d never imagined that perfect, red pout of his wrapped around my dick.
A few hours later, I was still researching the philosophy of thought and the mind, and looking up relevant examples, when I felt a pair of arms wrap around my shoulders, Harry sliding his body down along my back, and my brain immediately told all thoughts of work to fuck off.
“Pretty sure I still bear the scars from trying to deter Draco from reading or studying to play Exploding Snap at school,” I agreed, grinning over at Draco. “You’ve thrown a mean Flipendo since First year.”
No offence, hon, but once
“You two are hysterical,” Harry informed us, as “Ethan” slung an arm around “Natalie” and smirked at the small crowd staring up at them.
“You’ll just have to be satisfied for now with watching me do it.”
I didn’t reply, just kept sucking languidly, one arm hooked under and around his thigh, fingers tracing and relishing in how his muscles flexed and relaxed beneath my ministrations, my other hand gently fondling his balls as I lost myself in the taste, the feel, the scent of Draco.
“Cause I’m positive that pretty mouth of yours was made for it,” he added, lifting a hand to trace along my lower lip with one slender finger.
Curse Circe and all she held sacred, but I almost came on the spot, my cock jerking almost painfully against the confines of my trousers because the reality, where Harry was concerned, was, as usual, so much more than even my rich imagination could have ever fathomed.
“Normally, I’m worse than she is,” I informed him, raking a hand through my hair, briefly wondering if Hermione would notice how dishevelled I was, for the first time in my life, lamenting my fastidious nature.
standing in the middle of
Never mind that I’d positively devour a tin of it if he’d set it before me right now.
Draco started, eyes snapping to me, realisation dawning on his features.
There was a flurry of movement as everyone placed orders, Charlie and I deciding to share some nibbles before tucking into our burgers – I’d ordered mine with extra Red Leicester, bacon, and a double order of chips and Blaise turned, reminding us to be sure to save room for the build-your-own ice cream sundaes the theatre was famous for.
“What? You asked for my honest opinion,” I reasoned. “Consider it a warning to be careful in your silly potions room.”
I knew exactly the havoc I was wreaking on Harry, alternating between my mouth and my cock on and in his arse like this.
“Maybe even a little romantic at night.”

scandalous lack of modesty, and anyone who had ever lived with the ridiculous man no longer even batted an eye when encountering Draco and his latest paramour —  his mum, his father, Blaise and I, every Slytherin student who’d attended Hogwarts from his fifth year on up…
“Right,” Ron muttered sceptically, lifting the glass to his lips.
I hadn’t even had to look at him to see the hurt and questioning in those eyes. The ones that showed everything he was thinking and feeling.
My mobile pinged just then, and I heard Williams’ give a similar sound.
“Apparently whatever he’s been summoned for doesn’t pertain to my particular role within the department.”
I’d spent the rest of the afternoon being plagued by
Draco withdrew suddenly, and I made a strangled noise of complaint at the loss of his mouth attached to my arse.
Suddenly, Harry and Draco stopped, Alice and I nearly bumping into them.

I released him when his legs connected with the mattress, allowing him to tumble unceremoniously in a heap beside me.
, staring longingly at the covered plate, then hopefully back at Draco.
“No!” I shouted, pulling my arms back and tucking them safely under my body, well away from his prying hands.
“I need a refill,” I insisted, raising the empty glass and waving it in Pansy’s face expectantly.
“I’ve no idea what that has to do with anything.”
Even though I hadn’t really had much interaction with Harry’s Aunt and Uncle, I’d seen enough to know that this particularly creative punishment was perfection.
Fuck.

I giggled, as did Blaise and Ron.

Harry smiled one of his brilliant, genuine smiles and thought for a moment.

Harry frowned.

“I think you already knew,” he told him, and Harry grinned up at him.
Draco’s gaze moved to Vernon as though our son hadn’t just spoken.
Draco hadn’t been lying about the queue — it was enormous and snaked its way out of the market and along the street outside.
“They’d asked me what size I wanted the balls,” Draco was saying, still as naturally as if he’d been discussing case research notes with fucking Hermione.
not doing a good job…” he'd muttered, mock-glaring at me as he leaned in to kiss me, pulling me down to lay atop him on the couch.
“Harry,” he chuckled, still giving leisurely little licks around and over my hole. “You’re blushing so hard, I can practically see it from down here.”
He caught it and immediately tossed it inside the room, flicking his wand at it so that it danced across the room towards the coffee table, just as a second bottle shot into his newly outstretched hand.
“Ben,” I blurted out, sitting up. “Is he?”
“Uni,” he replied unhelpfully, picking up his sushi and popping it into his mouth.
There was no way I could have asked Draco that without raising his suspicions.
The positively electric kiss that had followed.

“This is where you order and pay for your ramen,” he explained, inserting a Japanese paper bill into the slot.
“Wonderful,” I assured her. “We’re just catching up and got a tad carried away.”

“We need to decide how we’ll get you ready for me.”
“Or gallant,” Pansy added with a firm nod.

“Don’t forget the bonfire,” she reminded us, smiling good-naturedly as a few groans of protest went up and we filed out to stack the firewood as quickly as we could.
“Quit it. I already told you, they’re not worth a trip to Azkaban.”

Draco was staring back at me, confused.

“This is the oldest shopping street in Tokyo,” Toshio told us. “So, for today, if anyone were interested, you are my friends and I am showing you the number one tourist site in the city.
“Maybe a ‘P,’ or an ‘F’…” she was muttering.
Honestly, I’d briefly considered obliterating all the memories of Harry but hadn’t quite been able to bring myself to do it.
“Erm…” Hermione bit her lip and struggled to meet my eye.
Behind us, Victoire had just bobbed for another apple and was using her mum’s wand to spin the skin off into a delicate spiral which she then tossed over her shoulder.

“What are you up to? Grab dinner?” I texted Draco Wednesday evening as soon as I got home from practice.
I turned to see Malfoy under the spray of a massive rainfall shower and he smiled at me as he turned his face up to the spray.

“So, is this really all they’ve been able to finagle out of you about your beau, then?” Harry demanded, grinning at Malfoy as he propped his right ankle upon his left knee and leaned his right elbow on his knee, hand resting in his palm as he looked up at Draco expectantly.
“Both have been occurring at a rising rate, and not just in England. We
I tried to buck my hips back against his wicked mouth as he continued to work me.
“Just… tell me so,” he managed, legs hitching up to fasten around my waist as Harry leant backwards, pulling me down with him.
“Mmm,” he sighed. “This smells like you.”
“We have wands,” Hermione assured us, pulling a slender piece of wood from her pocket. “Harry and Draco just don’t use them.”
When had we become Harry and Draco? I wondered, still watching him.
“I know, darling, but I could hear you screeching your discontent in my head,” Pansy informed him, turning to look at him and giving him a genuine smile.
“Was he, now?” Harry replied, finishing off his glass of champagne and reaching for the bottle beside him.

Not meant to last long because, to be honest, I wasn’t sure my psyche could survive this much longer.
“Couldn’t have said it better myself,” James muttered darkly.
Draco looked as though he were cursing his finicky nature but didn’t reply, and I grinned to myself as I walked into the closet to hang his trousers, taking a moment to Accio the phial of lube I knew he would have packed in his weekender.
“Don’t you dare say anything that might keep him away,” she scolded with a wave of her wand to float a large metal tub towards us.
Draco held his arms out, and Harry quickly crossed the distance to fall into his embrace.
“Merlin, you look incredible like this,” he murmured, and I practically purred at his praise, pushing against his hands to open me even wider.
I was barely aware of the whimpers of protest I was making.
He rolled again, pinning me beneath him, my legs automatically circling his waist, pulling him closer against me.

“What happened last night?” she demanded. “Who’s Ben?”

Actually, I mused.
Harry’s right arm shot out, snatching something from the air, as he rolled over so
“No, he’ll have a small team of dedicated guards and doctors who will work with him.”
“The Magpie,” Ron answered. “It’s just round the corner once you get to Muggle London.”
He, of course, was already fully dressed, looking as impeccably snoggable as he always did, and I couldn’t help but allow myself another lingering glance over Draco.
“One of us has to,” he continued, and I frowned.

Blaise and Ron admitted that, for the first time in their careers, it had been difficult to remain professional, seeing as the two men targeted were their best friends from school.

Behind her, another row of tables disappeared, and Williams’ turned his attention back to Harry.

Basically, a French warship went down, and several soldiers clung to a raft, hoping for rescue.
Then he was gone, and I made a noise of complaint at the sudden missing warmth.
“How did you disguise it?” Harry asked curiously. “How do you now, for that matter? I’ve never noticed any telltale bulge in your trousers. In public anyway.”
In fact, the case had dragged on for so bloody long at this point that Draco and Williams were being allowed to share details that they’d uncovered as secret agents usually only shared with the Minister and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

Then again, she probably was.
I glanced down at our empty pints, then back up at my cousin, asking if he had time for a third, and final, round.
“What’s he doing here?” I whispered to my partner, Clyde.
I knew he’d dated a gorgeously suave Muggle he’d met in Paris named Etienne just after the War, and that he’d brought him back to London to live in the flat he’d shared with Blaise and Pansy.

He paused and frowned.
I didn’t really invite anyone else in here.

“Where did you imagine my cock?” I thrust my hips up, rutting my length along his channel as I nipped along Harry’s neck again, pressing an innocent kiss into the corner of his mouth before continuing.
“Close. Your. Eyes.”
In one split second, I was overcome with waves of emotion:
“How naughty you are…” he added, eyes darkening just a shade, and I
“Welcome to our new life,” Harry quipped, chucking the paper aside and clambering on top of me.
Hermione, Micah, and Ginny all chuckled knowingly, while Pansy, Blaise, Anaïs, and I looked at each other in confusion.
Malfoy shook his head, arms reaching out to grab me and pull me towards him again.
He responded to Draco in French, and a helpful little caption popped up at the bottom of my screen.
Harry ignored it and continued to lick and nibble down the inside of my right thigh, before moving to lap at my bollocks, taking first one, then the other gently into his mouth, then repeating. Licking, sucking, tongue swirling, driving me absolutely mad.
“Make sure you’ve got everything you need and that your enforcements are on their way before you go,” she instructed.

It was the last coherent thought I had before Draco’s talented mouth began working itself against my opening.

and he might be about to adopt her himself.”
“You know, it really wasn’t,” he mused, frowning in thought. “It seems like it would be, but it was quite pleasant.”
I mean… meeting Molly Weasley was practically being taken to meet Harry’s mum, and by the time Harry and I had walked this same path earlier today, I’d nearly convinced myself that she was going to take one look at me, change her mind, and pull Harry aside and tell him “No, absolutely not. Anyone but him.”
“That’s…” Draco gasped, leaning forward in his seat, uncharacteristically emotive. “That’s Melanie Duncan.”
It didn’t matter that I didn’t understand a word of the bold headline to know that she was either dead or missing.
“Are you hungry?” Draco asked suddenly, turning to face me. “Could you eat again?”
“Agreed.”
I shrugged. Harry seemed like he’d be a good pull, to me, anyway.

“Draco?” he asked, propping himself up on his elbows, one hand reaching out to pull me back to him, eyes sliding closed in anticipation, thighs spreading wide as I settled between them.
I continued to lap and swirl and dip my tongue into him, moaning all the while, because, fuck, how could I
“Oh,” he said, as though a light bulb had just gone off in his head, “are you one of those blokes who don’t kiss because it’s too intimate, or whatever?”
“Erm...”
“We’re going to the top, right?”
“I think he had a bit of a late night last night,” I informed Blaise, smiling sweetly as Draco shot me a murderous glare.

“Yeah, I would tell myself that, but then it just felt so goddamn good…” I grinned.
“And you’ll kneel on the floor,” I continued, ignoring said part of mind. “And you’re going to suck my cock. ‘Cause I’m positive that pretty mouth of yours was made for it.

“What the fuck?” Micah interrupted.
“Little did he know, hmm?” he quipped, then paused, a little shudder running through him.
I paused for a second, then nodded quickly, almost shyly, studiously avoiding her gaze.
He was busily typing something into his mobile, then looked up at us suddenly and grinned.
“Harry, love, say ‘Dada’,” James tried. “I bet you can say ‘Dada!

He was already grinning back, excited and much more awake.

While I understood their concerns about leaving Mum alone with someone as devious as my father, I

I accentuated this statement with a slow squeeze of said arse, allowing myself the gift of fondling this bit of heavenly perfection with my hands.
Behind them, I spied Robles, Department Head Bones, and a team of Aurors were landing and running to our aid, shielded by a powerful Invisibility spell that alerted only a select few to see them.
“Bloody Slytherin!” George yelled from somewhere, earning some chuckles and a shrug of acquiescence from me.

But still. I’d only ever seen it done by older, un-sexy wizards. Like Dumbledore. Or Snape. Or Voldemort. Harry, hot and fit as he was, performing wandless magic, was a different story entirely.
When I’d arrived at the Quidditch pitch that Saturday evening the day after the confrontation with Williams — had it only been a few weeks? It felt like years — I hadn’t been all that surprised to find a swarm of reporters from the Prophet waiting at the gates, cameras at the ready.
Roger Davies, for example, who was either in denial when he’d attended the Yule Ball with Fleur, or just had a penchant for good-looking blonds, regardless of gender.
“Oops,” said Harry, not sounding the least bit sorry, and I made sure to save this particular memory so I could laugh and relish in my boyfriend’s snark when I wasn’t so preoccupied.
Pierre-Yves was going to get a tip so bloody large, he’d never have to work again.

“And, if I’m going to finish what I started this morning,” I paused to slip still a third finger into Draco’s mouth and he positively keened around them, eyes still watching me, sparkling in anticipation.

“The trial?” I supplied, raising my brows, and Harry nodded quickly.
“Didn’t you feel like you were living a double life? Like you were lying all the time?” he asked, and I realised that Harry’s issue with intimacy had nothing to do with actually being emotionally available and invested in another person.

Ginny smirked at me, then went back to sifting through what looked like an unnecessary amount of lipsticks and glosses.

Said street was bustling with witches and wizards, and Harry and Draco turned to look at us with a knowing grin on their faces.
Reluctantly, I drew my hands away and urged Potter back beneath the spray, tilting his head back, using my hands to cradle his face and keep the water and soap from running into his eyes.
“Quit being thick, Draco,” he advised, reclining fully in his chaise lounge, fixing me with his gaze. Blaise had always had this ability to look right through you.
Baby Harry in this photo was just a few months older than he had been in the last, and he was sitting upright in the middle of the reception, staring up at the adults before him, babbling and cooing.

“I do! I do!” I gasped, hands trying, unsuccessfully, to protect my most ticklish bits. “Ceasefire, sweet fucking Merlin, Potter!”
“Blimey,” I sighed, savouring another bite of the juicy, tender meat. “Mione, we might need to take another trip to France, soon.”

“Happy Birthday, Harry!”

“I have a feeling the crazy’s just getting started,” she laughed, leaning into me and watching the wreath weave itself under the charm I’d cast.
Along our way, we encountered several locals, some clearly coming home from work, and other families taking an evening stroll, and it felt very much like an inside glimpse into everyday Tokyo life, far away from the hustle and bustle and hyper-lit, uber-modern scene of downtown.

I told him so, which earned me a strange look.
Several of my photos were of my hip and lower abdomen area with its pleasure trail and twin indentations forming a “V” that disappeared below the band of my trousers. I’d been told a few times that blokes loved this part of me.

“Course I am,” Fred replied, reaching out to chuck his little sister on the head, his hand passing right through her head.

“About time,” I drawled, sipping the hearty
Draco laughed and set Hugo down only to pick up Manon and toss her into the air, her squeals of delight echoing throughout the room.

“So,” Molly was saying brightly, “That means I’ve only got to bake the barmbrack cakes and then I might have a minute to relax before nightfall!”
I wanted to turn to Harry in disbelief and demand that he explain what the fuck he meant by that, but he was crazy if he thought I was taking my eyes off of Williams right now.
“Charlie, Hagrid! Hullo!” he greeted,
“He might’ve been a bit more than a friend,” I admitted, taking another bite of my sandwich and glancing down at Harry nervously.

It was a popular spot, the narrow alley crowded with tourists and locals alike, and Harry and I entered, eyes wide and staring at the myriad bars lining the tiny space.
“I’ll have the cardamom beignets, please,” he replied. “And a glass of Calvados for him and absinthe for me.”

He held his arm out to the right, signalling the small flight of steps at the end of the gigantic pillared foyer.

“No,” Malik shook his head as he handed the wand back to Harry with a smile. “I

“Just grab one of mine.”
I shot her a look of mock outrage as Luna came walking up to Harry and I, her usual dreamy expression in place.
“Which is entirely false.”
Behind him, I could see Harry taking the whole scene in, mouth slightly open in surprise.
He was staring up at me with a tiny smile and a look I couldn’t quite place.
Frowning, I scanned the room once more, locating her mobile on the nightstand as well.
“Oh?” I took another, admittedly, larger sip of my tea then refilled my teacup from the pot. “Why do you say that?”
“Draco,” he whispered, and my eyes shot up to meet his.
Obviously, we couldn’t have the Muggle world suddenly aware of wizards in England, and only England, because they would, naturally, assume there were wizards in other countries.

Harry was leaning casually against one of the counters, nibbling on a stroopwafel (without moaning like the giant caramel-slut that he was, it should be noted) whilst Mum stood near the counter adjacent, holding her cup of tea, a genuine laugh bubbling up out of her throat as Harry wrapped up some anecdote.

I begrudgingly left the bath, drying myself off, and allowed myself to get sidetracked by Draco’s body — the way his muscles bunched and flexed as he moved — his cock, flaccid and dangling almost comically between his legs, and I wondered how long it might take me to change that as I knelt in front of him.
“Erm… yeah?”
“I don’t see how that’s relevant,” Draco answered, eyes narrowing as he frowned in thought.
“Ooh, it’s from France!” she squealed excitedly, looking over her shoulder to give the entire table a thrilled smile.
“Now, Malfoy,” he growled, pulling me up off his prick, mouth fastening hungrily to mine, tongue swirling in and back out before I could even think to tangle it with my own.
“Please, stop,” I gasped, not caring what I sounded like.
“Yeah, get over it, already,” Hugo was shouting at the telly and shaking a fist angrily, proving that my son was going to be one of
30,000 Galleons = roughly £113,000 or $145,000
And those hints were further supported by
“Mm?” he appeared from round the corner, brows raised questioningly.
It honestly hadn’t bothered me too much last night, happily numbed by several
You know damned well how much Malfoy’s changed and worked hard to bring respect back to his name.
“I dunno,” he shrugged.
“I’m sorry,” he apologised, almost immediately.
“Sort of,” Draco conceded, and I could feel his magic begin to settle.
“Merlin, he was bloody awful.” Harry shuddered. “I nearly hexed his bits off to make sure he never has sex again.”
“Bloody hell, mate, are you insane?”

“Hello, darlings,” she sighed. “I’m so glad you invited me. Really needed a night out after the week I’ve had.”
“I’ve just been waiting for the

Well, hello, Tristan, I thought, smirking down at him as I sank back into my seat, wrapping my arms around his neck.

Creeper creeps so hard.
“Draco.”
“The way I
“Gee, Harry,” I called out. “I didn’t know you’d become a movie maker on top of being a world Quidditch star.”
Sure, it was nice to be able to vanish clothing in the blink of an eye, but sometimes it was even more lovely to undress Harry manually, taking the time to run my hands over as much of his body as I was able to in the process.
“Your mussed up morning hair,” he continued with an impish gleam in his eyes, one hand lifting

“Seriously,” I insisted.
He obliged and unwrapped his legs from my waist, even if his top half still clung tight, mouth reaching up for mine. As though he had to reach. As though I wasn’t eagerly kissing right back, wanting. No.
However, if you grind up the stinger for certain potions, it just peps you up a bit.
Dudley opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by the doorbell, and I rose, giving Vernon a quizzical glance.
We finally meet our unexpected guest.
“Morning,” I replied, leaning into the caress, eyes still locked on his face.
“Imagining it wrapped and stretched wide around my cock… although it’s equally nice just remembering how it looks pursing around just the head as your eager little tongue laps at my slit so I know you’re relishing the taste of me…”
Blaise glanced off towards the roses in the corner, then back at Pansy, one brow raised as one corner of his mouth tugged upwards in a superior
I forced myself to push in slowly, just a little, then withdraw, back and forth, loosening him further.
“Aren’t you going to ask?”
Shrugging, I prepared a second mug of cappuccino and then filled the kettle with water and set it on the burner, should he decide to take tea instead.
I snorted.
“Fuck treacle,” Harry declared, eyes sliding shut as he chewed on his first bite of
Piles of journals, notebooks, and loose sheets of paper littered the floor and the nightstand beside it.

“Should Hermione and Draco have their glamours on as well?” Harry asked, frowning at Williams.
However... I paused and glanced around me, as though there could
Magic, that one there knows.”
Draco frowned and raised an eyebrow in a silent question.
I smiled happily into my glass of wine, then glanced shyly back up at Malfoy.
about you?” he asked softly, licking into my mouth as his hands wrapped around my neck, pulling me towards the bed.
“I’ve heard taking a break can greatly help one’s focus,” I informed him, turning to straddle his lap, grabbing his plump bottom lip between my teeth.
“He wants to be more than friends, you know that, right?”
“You could suck my cock for hours, couldn’t you?” he demanded.
Seconds later, Harry and I were back in the boardroom, where ten sets of eyes gawped at us in disbelief.

why I let Draco do those things to me.
And now, thanks to the Wizarding world having adopted the wonderful muggle mobile contraptions, she had them all right here, to show off to anyone, at any time, anywhere.
need to get a pet,” I shot back as the spider began to walk more quickly on its treadmill.
“What?” he asked, staring first at Hermione, then at me.
Harry kept me held firm and away from my goal, a tiny smirk appearing on those luscious lips of his.
“Harry, those trees have all grown up. It’ll be fine!” George assured him with a laugh. “What’s with you, Harry? Sounds almost as though you don’t want to go flying!”
Or, rather, tried to sit up, but was hindered by Harry, wrapped tightly around me.
Merlin, these two boys were stubborn, I sighed to myself as I nudged Harry encouragingly.
have wands?” Callum asked excitedly. “The list says I’ll need a wand. It’s a real wand?”
“Harry Potter is gagging for cock.”
Moving pictures?!?!
And who in their right mind would ever want to hear about their current partner’s “one that got away?”
“Which one’s the best one?” he asked, as another tourist boat came into view, chugging by, Harry still waving far too
“He wanted to play with his mother’s paints,” he explained. “But they are ink, not paint.
He kept it concealed out of habit, just in case any Muggles,
“Where is Harry?” she asked. “And Dr…”
“I…” he broke off as my tongue breached him once more.
If I even
“I love it when you call me that,” I sighed as he broke the kiss to begin licking and sucking down my neck, deepening the marks he’d started last night.
“Are you sure? I’d love to try and make you,” he countered, crossing his legs, his tone as casual as if we were discussing the weather.
“If he were a wizard, what house do you think he’d have been sorted into?” I asked curiously, chewing another scone slathered with cream and jam.
“Yeah, don’t worry,” Ron assured her. “He said he was on his way.”
, the lacings of dark chocolate balancing perfectly with the rich, buttery pastry.
And with that promise, he slid into me, one slick, delicious slide, all the way in.
Several kilometres away, another man’s hazel eyes gaze up in awe as his gorgeous wife, clad in a sexy, yet elegant, silk nightgown, climbs atop the bed, hand reaching out to catch the phial of lube stolen from their friend just a few weeks prior — and is quite glad that they’d bargained with her parents to watch the children over the weekend.
“Judgemental,” Hermione spoke up again, raising an eyebrow at Draco.
, and the noises he was making as I darted my tongue in and out between my thumbs spreading him open were positively vulgar.
“You can make it any way you want,” he added excitedly, sitting in his own seat.
“I need a fucking drink,” he ground out.
My throat was raw from moaning and crying out, not to mention swallowing around the black dildo as it slid entirely down my throat every few thrusts.
“Yes, but I’m ninety-nine
“Go ahead,” Draco assured him. “Just… don’t swish it at someone, just in case.”
“I like it,” he’d stated. “What do you think? Can you picture it?”
“And I’ll repeat it right back at ya, precious,” Ben replied, straightening, his own eyes flaring as he straightened and all but called Harry out with his eyes, hands reaching protectively for Draco. “Who the fuck are you?”
“Which jam would you prefer?” I asked, holding up the two jars. “Raspberry or blueberry?”
their toll.
I closed my eyes and imagined this bloke laying on his stomach; me straddling him as I ran my hands down his sides and parting those tempting cheeks to reveal that sweet pucker.
“We’re going to get to the bottom of this. We’re going to meet your mystery lover-boy. You might as well drop the fucking act and be stupid and happy and gushy about it, already.”
up by Pettigrew,” Harry was saying, and I frowned over at him.
Harry,” I corrected him as he leant down and pressed a gentle kiss to my mouth, then nuzzled his face in my neck again, and I couldn’t help but inhale the scent of his hair, smelling of shampoo, and sleep, and Harry.
The piece of fish was a wide, flat pinkish colour with a rich marbling that nearly hid the small mound of rice below.
, per se. I’d assumed there was a whole bunch of them in the Department of Mysteries, all working together to, well, you know. Solve mysteries.
“Well, now you have no excuse, Draco,” Charlie called out with a grin. “I expect to see you and Harry next.”
She took a deep breath and whispered the incantation, flicking her wand as she did so.
He complied immediately and scrambled up into my arms when I held them out towards him.
someone… they hired you… going to fuck me to death.” He was babbling now, and I could hardly hear him over the lewd squelching noises his arse was making as I worked my fingers in and out of him.
“Stubborn git,” Malfoy chided softly, eyes watching me carefully from over the rim of his pint as he took another sip.
I’ll await your report on Monday.
“I’m… good,” I admitted, glancing back down to where his hand was tracing lazy patterns across my chest.
Malfoy was wearing only pyjama bottoms, a dark, charcoal-grey colour, that looked great against his pale skin and showed off his slim, muscular build.
cast some sort of spell to help support me, and I moaned again as Malfoy continued to kiss me, thoroughly mapping every crevice of my mouth, tongue swirling, retreating, and entering with a skill that left me breathless.
Williams, his partner, was a few years younger than Draco and I, and about as brilliant as they come.

Harry scowled suddenly, arms working to free themselves from my grasp.

Another longing suck at the head, swirling my tongue around and dipping into Draco’s weeping slit, and I
and I were having not only a decent conversation, but an amusing one.
Gumdrop?

Silence.

“Just like I was saying. The best fabric. Gorgeous. I
“I didn’t do it because they were in any sort of danger. But…” I wasn’t sure how to continue without giving too much away.
Before I could even try to respond, Harry began.
Bastard.
“Careful, that’s not ordinary mustard,” I warned, turning towards Harry before I forgot to warn him of the spicy yellow mustard that I knew packed a more powerful punch than wasabi.
Or maybe even brew my own, honestly, I amended, taking another sip, letting the savoury flavours of the drink slide over my tongue once again.
Nevermind that he was clearly trying to evade the discussion.
“Thank you, Bessie,” Draco replied, selecting a sandwich and smiling down at the positively beaming house-elf. “I can’t wait. It’s been far too long.”
wasn’t much to see — just a large, stone-lined vault, with a small antechamber in the front, as Hermione had explained, and a larger room at back.
“What was that all about?” I asked once the door had shut on Dudley and his family.
I glared down at him despite pulling him towards me as we toppled back down into the bed.
a brow and shoot her a disbelieving look.
“Come with?” he asked, tugging at my hand and I nodded, grateful that Harry had sensed my desire to talk to my godfather and created a subtle way to excuse ourselves from the ghostly group surrounding us.
I supposed he had a point.
“I mean, so long as you stop doing idiotic things like ditching him post-shag for no reason,” I added.
Alice and I had only been by twice — both without the children — since Draco’s infamous visit, and it hadn’t taken long to ascertain that it was no longer safe to bring them round.
“He’s with Draco,” I replied smirking and Ron turned his glance over to Hermione, a dazed look on his face.
Fuck everything except for Harry, and me, and this… this…
“What have you got planned that you need to get me tipsy, first?” Harry joked, although he did look a bit wary, and I had to snigger to myself at that.
“Harry will be so upset if we don’t have a swan,” he added, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and pulling me closer.
His hands moved down to his trousers and I bit my lip, unknowingly, as I followed the movement.
“She’s the one who told me about that dumb app,” he grumbled, peering at me from between his fingers.
I held my fingertips up against his ghostly ones, feeling their icy coldness as we mock shook, me staring at my older cousin, his cool blue-grey eyes so similar to my own and Mum’s.
Honestly, it was like learning the city all over again, watching his eyes travel up and down the elegant buildings, lingering on the romantic details such as a wrought-iron balcony or lovely sculpture gracing a door or archway.
Truth was I needed a second to still my brain as it tried to make sense of the absolutely incredible feel of Potter’s arse wrapped around my dick. He was so goddamned tight. It just wasn’t fair.
with more of the lube.
“Does that mean….” he asked, looking at Draco and I worriedly as he gave the wand back to Draco.
To do what, I had no idea.
, that one time….”
to show him as much of my beloved second home city as I could on this first trip across the pond.
That fucking sob again.
“Harry,” he sighed, leaning his left side
“I’m definitely putting that one in the Pensieve,” he stated, winking at me and hopping off of the bed to retrieve his slacks from the floor.
“Three,” I answered truthfully, thinking this would prove to her how un-serious this all was.
“Mmm,” I nodded, inhaling again, taking in the flowery notes mixed with something sweet and earthy, that I realised was tobacco.

He licked another swipe
“Oh, not
He didn’t respond immediately, throat working, eyes still not quite meeting mine.

Harry grinned and added another coin, as did Pansy.

“Don’t... be a sodding Gryffindor,” he said, draining the last of his glass.
“You can call me whichever.”
Harry pulled away and twisted to look up at me.
He grinned up at us again as he touched his own silvery hair.

“I don’t know what made you think you and I could ever be a thing,” I began, eyes trailing up and down over him warily.
I popped his prick out of my mouth and continued as though I didn’t have a delicious cock belonging to an utterly delicious man standing before me.
“What, Kipp?” Williams joked, doing his best to look put off. “You don’t think Draco and I are capable of finding love?”
I was about to cry with want and then I felt him swirl his tongue around my opening, licking and lapping at my hole, lazily, as though he could, and would, do this all night.
, too, you think?” Ron asked, squinting at the slivery brightness of both his and Fleur’s hair.
Please! Get Alfie the ferret!
“What’s that?” Blaise asked, frowning, clearly not recognising the spell.
“Why would it be wrong to order a burger?” he asked. “It’s on the menu.”
, just not… often.
It was silent, and I waited in the darkness, wondering what would come next.
I peered at the room, with its two Japanese-style futons laid out on the ground.
Erm… you know, he can’t just appear somewhere like we adult wizards can.
“Holly, twenty-seven-and-a-half centimetres…”
I picked up one of the menus and held it up so Harry and I could both look at the boozy teas on offer.
Absolutely not.

Draco paused and gave Hermione a knowing glance.
Just…
“Oh!” he exclaimed, walking into the alley and up to some posters with those strange Muggle photos that didn’t move, pausing in front of the one featuring “How to Tame Your Dragon.”
“Why did Draco say he has no soul?” Micah piped up suddenly.
I could just hear the smirk in his voice.

“I like playing with you, Potter,” I smiled and twisted my fingers into him, cruelly, I’ll admit. But Merlin, he gave the most exquisite moan, arching his back and pushing himself back onto my fingers.
Potter groaned and snapped his eyes open to positively leer at me as he ran his tongue up and around my shaft as though it were definitely his favourite lolly.
to accept the most essential part of me.
my game.”
The next thing I noticed was Harry, positively wrapped around my side, clinging to me, not the slightest bit overheated at all.
And me, with Pansy and Blaise, my sidekick equivalents. Hell would ice over for a few days, certainly.
Harry, it seemed, wasn’t going to budge any on the topic, and Mum, being the gracious hostess she always was, sensed this and changed the subject.
