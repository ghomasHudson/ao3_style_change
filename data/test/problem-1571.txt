Luna’s bedroom was her very favorite place in her home. The walls were covered with murals that she had painted over the years, some only a year old and a few that her mother and father had helped her with when the woman was still alive. Some of the murals were simply landscapes, weaving around corners and dipping out of sight behind her bed, but others were of people important to her, and of phrases that she felt resonated with her. It was busy, admittedly, but the busyness was comforting in a way, only elevated by all the decorations she included in the space. Hanging from the ceiling were wind chimes, several elaborate woven strings of twine weaved around rocks, and a few new additions of hand-made dream catchers. They were all beautiful, and all wonderful to listen to when there was a breeze, which there was quite often in the summer months when she kept her windows wide open. Well, except for the dream catchers, which were surprisingly silent-likely because they were made of feathers and string. She liked the dreamcatchers plenty despite that, sure, but they had a certain uselessness to them that she felt rather bitter about. Simply put, Luna didn’t think they helped with her dreams all that much. Though… maybe she was putting the label of ‘dream’ onto the wrong things. Her nightmares about her mother had stopped after all, even though the red woman continued to visit her.
The man, seemingly reverting to his past methods, observed Tom like he was nothing but a particularly fascinating book. “I do not believe that there are right and wrong paths for individuals, but it is all too clear to me that Hadrian’s actions hardly affect just him as an individual. What I suppose I should have asked instead, was: what is the right path for the very fabric of our universe, and how likely is it that Hadrian will not follow that path? How likely is it that he will not be the hero of our world, but Armageddon itself?”
“Tom… Tom, I didn’t mean it, it was just a bunch of fun, you know? Just a laugh.” It murmured, fingers twitching as he let go of the chair and faced the broken door fully, before reaching forward and resting a hand against the splintered wood. Tom hummed to the thing’s words, before breathing deeply and getting to work, slowly reweaving the destroyed wood as the locket started to get more and more nervous.
"Bien sûr. You there, Harry Potter?"
“You know, I vaguely remember you wearing that same jacket a year ago and it was quite-ehm, well it was a tad bit baggy-”
Gabrielle: "So you are Harry Potter's lover?"
In the end, he sat with his head in one hand, looking down at the table between the cracks in his freezing fingers, and tried to will the tears not to fall.
Draco’s eye twitched, “don’t ‘yeah, mate?’ me, you twat. Now, tell me what’s wrong or I swear, I’ll hit you with something.”
The first thing that he had learned of had been a peculiar man of the name Wormtail, who was a less than trustworthy Death Eater and had given up Hadrian Potter and his family at the height of the war. The Failure hadn’t said much about the man besides calling him a rat, but Marvolo was resourceful if anything and knew that he could find wherever the man had hidden himself. It was cumbersome to find the man, but if the elder wand was still in Hadrian Potter’s unworthy clutches, then Wormtail was the best bet for finding where his yew wand had been taken. Perhaps he even had kept it.
“Minister Fudge, who is this man next to you, if I may ask?” Harry interrupted, glancing pointedly at the Bulgarian Minister, who seemed unsure exactly what to do with himself. Minister Fudge seemed to wilt slightly as he spoke, seeming blatantly intimidated for some absurd reason. Harry felt his confusion over the absurd conversation grow, as Fudge backed up another half a step before waving a jerky hand at the man with him. He wasn’t even threatening the man, why was he backing away as if he was threatening him with the cruciatus?
“Blaise?”
“Harry, you are aware that you have a presence, right?”
Harry thumped his chest, clearing his throat as he set the offending biscuit back onto the plate. “Y-yes, I suppose you have a point. Though, people usually say I’m difficult to read, you know.”
Malfoy. Harry, this is such a huge title, and you’re being handed it on a silver bloody platter, do you
He seemed… she frowned, reaching out for a golden-brown arm and fumbling around till his hand grasped her’s. “Why are you scared, Theo? There’s nothing to be afraid of.”
Theo sighed, letting his hand fall with the intention of turning around and finding his way back before he froze, staring blankly at the space in front of him. Right there, in place of the empty wall that had been mere seconds before, was a bright red door.
Daphne rolled her eyes, not nearly as bothered by the jab as Blaise was. “Oh don’t be so full of yourself, Malfoy, I was just surprised by how much Harry has… grown.”
Draco thought, as he pressed his face further into the crook of Harry’s neck.
Draco immediately sat back down again, looking entirely put out. Harry stared at the two women's retreating backs, confused.
that you have ever told me.”
And as there came a knock at the door, signaling that the birthday party was going to start soon, Draco paid attention as Harry glanced his way, and smiled a wretchedly fake smile.
“I haven’t spoken more than three sentences about him to you…?”
She couldn’t figure out why though. It was niggling at her subconscious, trying desperately to drag back the memories of dreams of a world that she didn’t recall ever living in. She was missing something, something so incredibly
Her voice started to fade into the background as his mind refused to take it in, all of his attention focused on Harry as the taller boy seemed to sink into his seat with relief, the exhausted and frustrated expression returning to his face the second he thought Draco wasn’t paying attention. Draco was paying attention though, he was paying a nearly painful amount of attention, and as breakfast started to drag on, all he seemed to be able to do was pay attention.
Harry Potter and his lord… they seemed to be coexisting.
“The potion’s room!” Came the distant reply. “I want to see her brew a few simple potions is all! We won't be gone long!”
“Are you alright there, Dray?”

"Regarde ce garçon Fleur, il est si grand!"
“Out of the frying pan, into the fire.” He muttered, sliding down to his knees and groaning as a nigh-unbearable headache started creeping around his skull. Why, out of everything that could have happened on Harry’s birthday, why had
He didn’t want to know what had made Harry so furious this time. He barely had time enough to come to terms with his own constant seething hatred as it was, let alone Harry’s rather recent lack of emotional regulation. He was barely coming to terms with the new house guest either, but that was a whole other point of contention. No, the only thing he was absolutely certain about, was that it would likely be best not to ask much about the entire situation if Harry was reacting like this. With Harry, it was best to just wait for him to be ready to tell you what was wrong. Nothing good would ever come from prying into things. They would come out when Harry needed them to.
He cursed, forcing himself to turn away and take off down the hall, running from the issue as thoughts of eat eat eat EAT EAT EAT-

He turned away as the butterfly settled onto his desk, wings slowly opening and closing as he tapped his foot anxiously against the hardwood below him. He had also, through some tricky guesswork with his stolen time-turner—which he had gotten Blaise to mail back to him, since he had left it in the other boy’s care before the school year ended—had managed to
Of course it's perfectly fine to do that, as fanfiction is in its very base element unoriginal, but when changing the story to the point that I am, you really need to change the characters as well.
He thought idly, turning slightly to look at the retreating form of the skinny, dour man. He had known Viktor as a polite but distant acquaintance in his last life, but if Lucius Malfoy’s letter had any basis in reality, it would be good to know a famous person from a relatively distant country. Just like France, Harry doubted that Marvolo or Voldemort or whatever he was going by now would want to bother with anyone if they fled to the cold far north of Europe, unless it was Harry himself.
acceptable?”
He nodded, his core flickering, and seeming unsure. “I heard you screaming. I just… wanted to make sure you were okay.”
smell things? You’re just a soul with no physical form. You’re incapable of feeling anything that a soul can’t feel you-you are aware that smells and taste fall under that category, right? You’ve never been able to taste the tea you serve when I’m here-”
It was then that he realized it. Harry Potter and his lord were intrinsically separate. They had to be. Harry Potter’s eyes, those sickeningly green eyes… they were wise, yes, and angry and cruel and daring, but they were still slightly,
He jolted, feeling a sudden intrusion inside his mind. For a moment he felt like panicking, before realizing that it was just Tom leaving his own mindscape. Harry flowled the vague feeling of his father’s magic as it climbed the stairs out of the dungeons and moved swiftly through the halls of Hogwarts, the man’s path veering very quickly towards Harry’s library. He felt confused at this, knowing that there was very little that he knew that Tom was not already privy to. Had something happened?
Harry bit the inside of his cheek, shifting from one foot to another as the scratch of a quill overtook the silence. “I’m… well, somewhat.”
Luna didn’t pay much mind as the rest of the school trickled in, though she did spare the tiny little first years a quick glance. Their souls were so fickle; small and quivering. They were all shaking like leaves in a thunderstorm and looked rather faint. Luna watched them warmly, thinking back to her first day at Hogwarts with a fond smile. She hadn’t been terrified—not in the least—though she had been quite curious about all the fantastical sights and sounds all around her. She distinctly remembers making Harry quite incensed as well, though she couldn’t recall exactly how. She remembered how his soul had reacted though—still as stone and coiled, held taught along a thin wire. She remembered thinking that it was a beautiful soul. That had been before his shattering, of course, when his soul had still been nothing but a black hole of potential. She almost missed those times. They were simpler.
“Consciousness is subjective.”
His self-admonishing thoughts were cut off abruptly as a hand suddenly closed around the collar of his shirt and yanked him upwards. Stumbling over his uncooperative legs, both of which seemed to have forgotten which foot went first, Barty fought to keep himself standing as he was forced to begin padding forward along a dark path.
“I’ll meet you lot there. I’ve got something to sort out with one of the professors.” He replied, rather lamely, before turning on his heel and quickly disappearing around a corner. Daphne made moves to follow him, but Blaise grabbed her around the middle and pulled her along towards the great hall, fighting the urge to throw his hands up in exasperation. He ignored Draco’s snickering as Daphne muttered under her breath, pouting rather unbecomingly as the three of them continued to walk along with the tide of other students.
He scoffed, watching as small tendrils of shadow started wriggling around behind the shoddily imagined shelf, attempting to get in-likely in an effort to steal Tom’s most important memories of important times in their life. He scowled at the poor attempt, focusing more of his magical energy into walling off the connection entirely as the shelf was slowly molded into a fortified iron door that completely covered up the hole. He let out a breath once it was in place, temporarily keeping the shadows out while he tried to come up with a long-term plan.

promising, and both Perenelle and Nicolas were equal parts excited and nervous to see the result. After all, the pair had been theorizing about the mysterious potion recipe ever since they had gotten their hand on it during some sort of excursion to the alps a few centuries prior, and were desperately wanting to see if it was even possible to make. Harry was, truthfully, not particularly fascinated either way, too focused on the nearing Quidditch World Cup and Draco’s own frayed nerves to care much about some strange potion.
explain how you managed such a feat as this, and when.” The man set a firm hand on his shoulder, his eyes filled with a familiar mix of curiosity and concern that had been rampant in Draco’s face for much of the last week that they had seen each other. The look was genuine, if strained.
She considered it for a moment, humming curiously as she wrote out a name onto the envelope. Theo didn’t bother trying to read it, knowing he was too far away for an effort to be anything but futile.
The heart that was beating out of its chest was not his, it was Barty Crouch’s. It never was his, and never would be. The stinging across his knuckles was his though, and he could hold onto that for as long as he needed to.
“What you should be asking, Favorite, is how can someone live when their heart does not beat? An emperor who lives on not just after death but

I did take some liberties with the Veela's coloring with this drawing, because it's really supposed to be all white, but I was struggling to make that look cool so I decided to emulate a falcon's coloring instead, just to add some texture. To be completely honest I really like it. (I used to know how to draw wings really well but that was in the 6th grade and I'm a senior in high school now, please forgive me for the shitty uneven feathers that look like they're one bad brushstroke away from looking kinda like dicks).
Lucius nodded, signing his full name at the bottom of his own letter with shaking hands. “Yes, I completely agree. Shall I write to Sir Flamel and see if he is willing to concede to such an arrangement?”
Harry nodded along, rubbing gently at his left shoulder as Nicolas turned towards his notes on the potion and started scribbling something down, muttering about how the lethality of the smog was more severe than he had been expecting. Harry traced the rough scar of his burn down from his neck, absentmindedly following it down to his collar before stopping short and sighing.
“You know, one wrong updraft and that smog could destroy the entire forest.” He remarked idly, ripping off his overshirt as the sticky potion concentrated on it. Scratching at his less-damp tank top underneath, he threw the overshirt into the nearby fire, watching as it crackled and sizzled angrily for a moment before the potion and smoke residue started burning off into harmless ash.
“I don’t trust him, Harry.” The boy snipped, whipping around to face the tall figure he was half-hidden behind.

Draco stared down at the portkey as its chain was held out to him, the glimmering pendant shining pleasantly in the early morning sun.
“Lots of things.”
They sat in silence for a time, the only sound being Draco furiously flipping pages and the scratch of nails against wood as Daphne fiddled with her wand. Blaise had gone back to staring at the ceiling, mapping out the little patterns of carvings as the seconds ticked on. He listened as the train started up and slowly moved out of the station, carving a familiar path out of London as the sound of the city was replaced by the steady chugging of the train. The seconds really were ticking on. Really… genuinely ticking by. He grimaced. Harry really needed to get his pocket watch fixed. The blasted thing was remarkably loud.
“Shut up.”
“And I also have every right to refuse one,” came the immediate reply. Harry sighed, shaking his head at the statement. It always came back to this, didn’t it. “Just like you have every right to refuse an explanation to your friends’ questions. Harry, we both have the right not to say a word.”
The book clattered against the wall as Blaise whooped, jumping from his seat to dodge it. He fell into a half-crouch, eyes widening with undisguisable glee and grin growing by the second as he blinked slowly at Draco’s loud proclamation. The blond’s eyes widened in horror, his mouth opening in an attempt to explain himself that would surely fall on deaf ears. Daphne couldn't help but let out a quiet burst of laughter.
It was very subtly familiar, but he couldn’t help but feel like the voices were speaking too quickly for him to really be able to tell anything that they were saying. Sirius stacked another piece of clothes onto the quickly growing pile, and Harry couldn’t help but feel like this was the only reason Sirius brought him along.
Blaise grinned, “well, this is going to be interesting.”
to be another explanation, one that Albus didn’t know enough about to be able to make a guess on.
The overwhelming silence droned on. The butterfly's green and yellow wings slowly opened and closed. The tapping of his foot nearly overshadowed the ticking of his timepiece, and Harry felt himself slowly losing in his battle against madness.
Harry raised an eyebrow, “I do distantly recall having this conversation with everyone after the ordeal. Do you not remember?”
He looked at her strangely, at least, his body seemed to turn away from the pond he was throwing rocks into and his magic seemed to get a little more molten than normal, though she really couldn’t be certain. Her eyes were partially closed after all, it was a tad difficult to make out specific details.
“Two…”
“Just-just give me a moment-”
He let the thoughts urge him forward, the questions he desperately wanted to ask fueling his pained shamble as he followed his lord and the two people with him out into the field surrounding the stadium and into the forest past it, keeping at a distance as the trio walked steadily, his footsteps masked by the voices around him and the crunching of leaves under the people’s feet. Barty fell into himself as he stalked after the three, mind returning to that state of half-consciousness as his body worked of its own accord, following after its master with silent footsteps as the sounds of excitement fell away behind him and darkness enveloped this new space he found himself in. He paid no mind when the three far in front of him stopped, their voices carrying along with the wind as he stopped in place as well, standing still in the trampled grass as they seemed to come to a swift agreement and carried on again, his quiet steps quickly joining with theirs once more as they all stepped through the woods and out into a new, unfamiliar clearing. Again, he stopped, standing straight at attention as they gathered into a circle, one of them—one of those vague silhouettes in the dark—took something in both hands, holding it out for his lord and the other, small and indistinct shadow to grab hold. He watched as the silhouette reached around, revealing some sort of object he couldn’t see from within the person’s cloak. He watched as a woman’s voice began to speak an unintelligible chant, her cadence assured and strong, yet too quiet for him to understand.
She nodded once, a jerky response to a loaded question, and placed the letter back onto his desk as if it were going to attack her at any moment. “I think that is a wonderful idea darling, I am so very glad that we are in agreement.”
“Ello there-”
Draco blinked, mouth opening slightly as he nearly chided Harry for being utterly full of shit. He held back the thought though, strainingly smiling instead before shakily taking the plate of biscuits and cup of tea that Perenelle offered to him. He set both onto the table, mind running through every little thing that happened in the past week as he slowly dunked one of the biscuits into the tea. Something about Harry was incredibly off, in a way that he couldn’t easily ignore, but he also couldn’t ignore that Harry clearly didn’t want to talk about it. It was so obvious, that even Perenelle seemed to be trying to change the subject matter towards something else. At least, her hovering seemed to be insinuating that much.
“You were born mad, you know that Potter?” Draco shot back, his tone sharp and-yes, he definitely knew something was wrong-as he casually dunked one of the biscuits into his tea. Harry snorted a laugh, one so obnoxiously fake that he nearly cringed at it himself, before leaning back in his chair, trying to disappear into the wicker weave as Perenelle directed the conversation away from him and onto potions, seeming to draw Draco’s attention away and making him objectively invisible.

“I’m going to wing it this year, Perenelle.”
“The second name is that of Justin Finch-Fletchley, who suffered from a fatal fall off the Hogwarts express while returning from spending time with his parents over the holidays. Please take the time to wish his family and friends well.”
“I love you too.” Harry replied, just as quiet and just as sincere. Draco glanced up at his soulmate’s face, following the path of his scar down from his hairline to the tip of his nose. It felt so strange, and surreal, sitting there and holding onto each other’s hands. It had been so long since they had even seen each other’s faces, touching felt like a novelty.
“Let. Me. Out! Let. Me. Out! Leettt… Meeee… OUT!” It parroted cruelly, hissing and biting in Tom’s direction as he stared on emotionlessly. He felt his anger wavering slightly, the exertion of so many hours of fighting and using magic inside his own mind finally beginning to make his shoulders sag under its weight.
“Yes… yes as I said, we will be hosting a Yule ball this year. We have decided to do so as, in light of the recent tragedies here, the ministry has agreed to allow Hogwarts to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament!”
Harry stayed in that same, vague, half-aware state for the rest of the day. When there was a knock on the door a few hours later, the sound of muffled French wafting through the airy space as Perenelle stood up to get the door, he merely glanced towards it and sighed. He watched Perenelle from his place on the couch, with Draco’s left foot propped up in his lap and the other one hanging off the couch entirely. The muffled voices became louder as the door opened, and seemed to continue as Perenelle’s cheery voice was added to the fray, outshone by a voice that was distinctly Fleur, who seemed to be speaking in a breathless, awed tone.
Theo despised the place.
was nothing.
As soon as it had started, everything began to slow, and Draco forced his eyes open, searching for his footing as the ground got closer and closer at a shockingly fast speed. He winced slightly on impact, stumbling forward several feet before managing to right himself, nausea quickly making itself an issue as the world swam around his face.
The little girl nodded enthusiastically, before leaning slightly around him to level a scrutinizing look Draco’s way. His soulmate seemed utterly unphased.
“Are you quite finished, Greengrass?”
Was he still laughing? Harry couldn’t tell, still gripping onto his hair as his shoulders shook. It didn’t feel like he was still laughing. Was this what madness felt like, he wondered?
“Pardon?”
if he couldn’t do anything else. The laughter was euphoric, and maddening.
Glaring at the mysterious letter for a moment, Harry weighed his options. Clearly, something about Luna’s letter was putting him on guard, but it was a ridiculous notion to think that every little thing from here on out would be just as discomforting. He was being ridiculous.
The tar-like substance from the beaker attacked the molten rock with vigor, eroding away at it as if it were nothing but chalk on pavement.
Draco shook his head, making a point to ignore the still-laughing boy as he reached for his book once more, intent on ignoring the wordless mocking and getting back to his studying.

“Well, one for two isn’t bad.”
He followed the feeling of someone else’s memories guiding him through the estate, the faintest whispers of a boy, who could have grown and been happy if history had played out differently, leading him through to the interior of the manor. Everything he passed was covered in dust or sheets, hidden away from the world until such a time that they would be revealed again. Marvolo decided to burn the place to the ground before that was possible. The happy memories lying in wait here would not be allowed to flourish, only his would be capable of continuing on.
Nicolas sighed through his teeth as he bottled both jars of ‘ink’ with identical stoppers, setting them both back onto the shelf before returning to his seat in front of the forgotten petri dish of gold. “There are various methods I’ve taken to implementing, but I have found that the most effective way is to take a job as a mortician, where I can drain the blood of dead non-magicals without anyone questioning me. There are also blood banks but… ah, I suppose you’re wondering what this has to do with a philosopher's stone, yes?”
There was a great lurch, and for a moment he felt the memory begin to drift towards him from the aether before it was ripped back again and he was thrown backwards into a shelf, cursing as books rained down onto him. Scrambling to his feet, Tom watched with horror as the darkness surged forward and into his mindscape, attempting to grab for the books before he reacted and sent his own wave of magic towards it. Recoiling, the darkness slowly slunk back into the hole, fortifying and solidifying until it turned into something resembling a slowly moving wall of shadows.
The locket could barely be considered human, or even human-looking once you paid enough attention to it. Its ears were too long, pointed and sharp like an elf’s, and it was small, wrinkled, and slightly pink all over. Its skin simultaneously looked too small and too big for the rest of its body, strung taught in some places and hanging off the skin in others. It was the soul that reminded Tom the most of the Voldemort from Harry’s memories, which hardly endeared it to him. It was utterly and completely vile in every way, and if he didn’t need to absorb it to complete his plans, then he would have forced Harry to hunt it down and destroy it years ago, if only to put it out of its misery.
“Of course Mr. Malfoy, I would be happy to help wherever I am necessary. Now, I suppose you two must have much to get caught up on.” This statement was punctuated with a strangely pointed look in Harry’s direction, one that did good to confuse Draco even more. “So I’ll be taking care of things in my laboratory if either of you need anything from me. Tata!”
He watched as Perenelle let go of the portkey to turn more towards Nicolas, still flirting and talking as if he wasn’t even there. He knew they didn’t mean to ignore him, but as the pendant fell, swinging through the air, Draco felt like he was standing alone in a crowded hall anyway. Maybe it was because he didn’t know the pair of immortals very well, but whenever he was alone with one of them, he felt distinctly out of place.
Gabrielle : "Donc, tu es l'amoureux de Harry Potter?"
Perhaps more importantly than the nonsense with Sirius, was Barty Crouch. Harry had, somehow, managed to set aside a few sparse seconds of the past week to discuss things with the half-crazed and, oddly enough, genuinely loyal man, though the entire ordeal with the psycho had barely been much of a thought in his mind as the final days of summer crept to a close. Now that the majority of his issues had come to a successful finish, the death eater was seemingly all he could keep his mind on for an extended period.
“Why do you even care about this, Tom.” He questioned quietly, ignoring the patent sigh he got in response as he slowly lowered himself backwards, settling onto the comfortingly cold stone underneath him. “Why did Barty Crouch showing up make you so insistent that I need to throw all my deepest, darkest secrets out into the open?”
“I… I like it, yes but-but Tom I don’t like these chains. You know I love to move around and-and it really isn’t fair to do something like this to your brother, you know that, right?”
No cost was too great.
Standing suddenly, the blue-eyed man regarded Tom kindly before turning away, continuing to talk as he browsed through the seemingly infinite books around them. The pair were in the diadem’s mind, which was not only vast-far larger than Tom’s mindscape could ever hope to be without them molding together-but also much deeper. The library around them stretched on for miles, though the substance held in the tomes could be nothing or everything-it was difficult to tell what books were meant to be tricks to misdirect intruders or actual memories and knowledge.
Now that Harry had inadvertently saved them from revealing Lucius’ plan to Marvolo, Tom could focus on getting the blasted thing out of his mind. How it had even managed to break through the door was worrying enough in itself, never mind the fact that Harry’s loved ones could be in danger because of the breach. He would try to figure out how it had happened once he had properly fortified the broken door, healed himself, and fixed the mess that was his mind after the hours-long fight that had ensued because of it all.
There was a sparse second of silence, before the alight wand was finally pulled out of his face, revealing the woman who had been counting, as well as a young boy who seemed to be around thirteen. Barty took only a sparse moment to stare at the child, before coming to the swift realization that he was likely a Malfoy. Their hair was a very unique shade, after all, it rarely could be found anywhere outside of the family. The woman, however, was a complete mystery, and as she backed up a few paces and back into the darkness of night, he allowed himself to assume she was simply a foreigner. Her accent surely insinuated as such.
His chest ached.
“T-the prototype of what?” He finally asked, his eyes skating back and forth between the small stone and Harry, who was rolling up the sleeves of his shirt as he walked towards them, looking more than a little scatterbrained as he did. His hair was sticking up on end in all sorts of angles, and there was some ink staining his fingers as they fiddled with the pressed, white sleeves of his shirt. Draco watched, enraptured, as the sleeves were pulled up to above his elbow, revealing long arms and tanned skin. More skin than Harry typically showed.

There was hardly much he
He sipped at the drink as she groaned disparangly, falling back with a thump in her chair as she drank straight from the bottle. Nicolas raised an eyebrow, not so concerned that she would get drunk than he was for her liquor supply.
“With you, Potter. What’s wrong with you? You were right as rain just last night, and then I woke up this morning and you were off having some sort of crisis. I let it go for your party, but you aren’t getting out of this that easily.” Draco shot back, his tone lacking in anything but general annoyance. Harry winced, finding he was being given much less room for error than usual.
What was worse, was that the confinement did not stop at just the imperious. He was not just forced to stay absolutely still, but at night when his father was most vulnerable and his chance of escape at the highest, he was kept chained to a wall in his old room, forced, even if he wrangled free of the curse, to sit there and wriggle pathetically until the daylight came and his father woke.
“Nine…”
“He looks healthier.” He finally supplied, receiving a raised eyebrow from Draco for his troubles.
She scoffed, almost playfully, as she waved her croissant around in the air. “It is all there in your face, my friend! You wouldn’t have to say a word and your face and body and mannerisms would still
“Oh Tom, Fate had such high expectations for us, and we let her down. I suppose this must be her revenge, yes? And I suppose that it is partially my fault, for making you this way. I am, after all, a very large piece of our life. I’m so sorry that she has destroyed us in such a way, and I am so very sorry that you feel the need to destroy us further in retaliation.”
Harry sat back in his chair, looking around the warm kitchen in thought. The Flamel house had been a surprise to him, to say the least. He had expected something small and tucked away, just a small little place to work on projects or something similar. However, he had been pleasantly surprised to instead find himself in a cozy yet regal château out in the woods, surrounded by miles of trees and wildflowers and connected to no roads or towns or anything similar. The house itself seemed to blend perfectly into the scenery, nearly disappearing behind vines and floral pots and baskets of ferns.Everything inside of the house was compressed to make room, with the dining room situated half in the kitchen as every available space was completely taken up by pots and pans and dried herbs and pickling things of unknown varieties. Perenelle had a rather expansive garden in a greenhouse nearby, which he wanted to see for the simple fact that it apparently had some of the rarest potion ingredients on the planet inside. Strangely enough, the crowdedness of the space ended up making it feel just as small and tucked away as he had expected, regardless of the obvious wealth of the couple.
“Ten…” Perenelle started, eliciting a lamenting groan from Draco as he extinguished his lumos, tucking his wand away into his pocket as Harry watched Perenelle merely dim her’s to near darkness, still needing to see the pocket watch as she counted down. They were enveloped in near-darkness, and Harry’s eyes quickly adjusted to it, the faces of his companions revealing themselves out from the shadows.
“Luna, wait!”
He doubted that Marvolo would come to save it anytime soon.
Pansy let out a sigh, pushing the thoughts of family dynamics aside as she chased after her friend.
That thought he kept being stuck on as well, feeling in his bones that this had been an indirect attack on his reputation and not a direct one onto the Weasley girl itself. After all, how could the girl have gained an enemy so driven to not only want to kill her, but to actually go to the effort to do it? The child was only twelve! No, it was clear that this was an indirect attack on him, which only led to more questions of who could have orchestrated it. Why had the attack been on the girl? Did the attacker wish to divide him from the Weasley family? And for what purpose? It just didn’t make any

Harry. It is all about Harry. It is all
Nicolas had come out to see them off, his fingers coated with ink and a half-crazed look in his eyes as he muttered on about Merlin knew what. He didn’t look like he had slept for a week, and Draco couldn’t help but feel that he hadn’t as he Draco watched Perenelle laugh, whacking her husband in the shoulder as if he had said something outrageously funny.
Translation of the French dialogue:
“What’s that then?”
“It’s the prototype.”
“Eight…”
covered with any bodily fluids.
“Yes, well, now that all the housekeeping is out of the way, I have a few much less somber announcements to make today.”
Draco scooted closer, gripping his hand tighter as he buried his nose into Harry’s bicep.
Barty Crouch.
What was so different? He couldn’t quite sort it out. He knew something was different though, something incredibly important. So, he sat there, not quite sure what exactly was wrong, but knowing that something was happening.
He considered later on in the day that it was very likely his grandfather had seen the defiance in his eyes a few seconds before he actually spoke, as the man swung just as he had opened his mouth. The second slap was sharper than the first, but Theo didn’t let himself react to it besides a jerk of the head, already having expected it.
“You’re going mad, Harry?” Draco remarked, almost casually, as he languidly stretched across the nearest chair. Harry found himself watching the movement, feeling like Draco was acting oddly… odd. He felt a spike of panic race through him. Had Draco gotten a letter as well? Did he already know?
Heart made of fire.
He hummed, and then snorted, and subconsciously shifted to face Harry as he contemplated what to say, shuffling closer to try and close the thinning gap. “Honestly, it feels like I’ve been disowned by my parents anyhow, so perhaps I’ll take up any offer she has for me.”
Perenelle broke the silence with the gusto of someone throwing a mirror against a wall, and Draco’s eyes quickly left his face, following a sharp path towards the immortal woman currently pouring two more cups of tea. Harry fidgeted, his eyes darting between the two others in the room as Draco’s eyes narrowed. His soulmate seemed strangely analytical for so early in the morning, almost as if he had been expecting a war zone as he came down for breakfast. Harry got the sudden feeling that he likely had been.
“Merlin be damned, Harry, it really isn’t
And, sure enough, Harry joined them at Slytherin table around fifteen minutes later, his face a mask of boredom as the tiny first years trailed along behind him, flanked by a stern-faced McGonagall as she led the procession towards the professor’s table.
just how much you miss him. I have known from the second you came here that there was someone you are ensconced with, all I had to do was merely wait for you to put a name to the feeling.”
He almost shouted out to the man, instinctively jolting back up again before stumbling back, the ear-piercing screams of the crowd around him returning as the familiar man disappeared out of the entranceway and the world swarmed forward to meet him once more. Barty threw his hands over his ears, eyes squeezed into slits as he stumbled forward on barely functioning legs, following after the large man on instinct as the crowd of rowdy onlookers shoved him one way to the next, not realizing that they were shoving nothing but air in their desperation to see the quidditch stars walking in the same doors the large man had just exited.
It had felt so
long since he allowed himself the comfort of childhood, if he ever even had in the first place.
She watched a flicker of his soul-the smallest of movements. He had shaken his head, she was certain. “I can’t-just… I can’t without some sort of assurance that he is who he says he is. You understand that, don’t you Luna?”
now, so you better get me out of these chains and start explaining!” Whined the locket from its position on the floor, its malnourished legs flailing around in the air as Tom raised an eyebrow, unimpressed.
“What’s wrong…?” He echoed, watching as Draco’s eyes narrowed, a frustrated blush racing up his neck as he leaned forward across the coffee table threateningly. Harry coughed into his hand, averting the accusatory eyes as the feeling of Draco’s gaze burning a hole into his skull became noticeably more pronounced.
“Gah!” The whispers from her housemates drove her over the edge, and Luna harrumphed rather loudly, slamming both arms onto the table as obnoxiously as she could manage as she glared distastefully towards the man everyone expected her to believe was Mad-Eye Moody. It was an utterly ludicrous thought; someone would have an easier time trying to convince her that Harry walked around on his hands instead of his feet. That was how blatantly obvious it was to her that the soul shambling towards the professor’s table could be nothing but a perfectly healthy twenty-something with all his limbs still attached!
“Shut up. Just
He was pulled from the thought as Harry’s hands let go of his, and instead reached up and brushed along both of his temples with cold, feather-light touches. Draco froze, his heartbeat skyrocketing as Harry’s hands lowered slightly and cradled his face, the other boy’s thumbs brushing softly against his cheeks. He looked up and caught Harry’s eyes, his own blow wide as the other boy continued to brush gentle touches across his cheeks and jaw.
Harry raised an eyebrow at each of them in turn, looking severely unimpressed. “Really, do you think I’m not going to boss you lot around because I’m not campaigning to be King? Do you really expect me to not boss around the
“Dad, why can you smell things?”
He followed a well-worn path to the dining hall, the corridors becoming unfamiliar as he walked further away from his original route. As he walked, the decrepitness of the house started to shift into something calmer-something more akin to a tomb. As he walked, the aftereffects of his first visit became less prevalent, and the manor revealed itself like an aged crypt, housing the memories of those who had lived there with stunning accuracy. Marvolo was not privy to those memories, he did not know how to follow them as he could follow his own, but the hints of life that they gave were telling all the same.
“She tried to drug me with a love potion. Twice.”
Harry couldn’t bring himself to be surprised. Considering the over five centuries of marriage the two had shared together, he had doubted since meeting them that they were anything but soulmates. He doubted that any couple could manage to stay faithful to one another for all those years, and surely would have left each other for other things and people at some point in time. It certainly didn’t help that he saw a comfort between them that reflected how he felt with Draco, though like most things he had been too busy with his studies and too nervous about overstepping any boundaries to ask about it and confirm his theory.
“Why?”
Theo suddenly felt a spike of anger, jerking down to pick back up his trunks before turning towards the fireplace. “Unlike you, grandfather, I could care less about a person’s reputation. If I want to care about someone I will despite how the rest of the world sees them.”
They had also come to learn that the esteemed and highly regarded Lord Lucius Malfoy was extremely adept in cleaning charms, though when asked how they knew this none would quite be able to answer.
“Just fine, Albus.”
There was a pause in the air, as they all stood silently—save for Draco’s muttering as he fumbled with Persephone’s cage. Nicolas’ eyes got a little hard then… a little more serious than Harry was used to, and the old man nodded sagely. “Be sure that you do, Harry. Don’t fumble about in the dark if we are capable of helping.”
“Ahhh... was I supposed to kiss you somewhere else? You know I can still-?”
“Who were the letters from? No one unsavory, I hope?”
again.
“-love of my life, darling dearest, sweet angel of mi-”
“Thank you, Thomas.”
“The muggle world wars showed a new possibility as well. I had attempted to enlist but it seemed much easier to just become a frontlines nurse and-”
They pushed through the crowd slowly, though it was marginally easier than Harry expected it to be. Students got out of his way quickly enough, and their parents swiftly followed suit, all of them with odd looks on their faces as they regarded him. Harry didn’t know if the expressions were because of his height or because of who he was, but he couldn’t really bring himself to care. If he needed to use his infamy or stature to his advantage, then he damn well would.
He wanted to explore the entire thing, top to bottom.
Luna shivered, tugging on her sleeves and slipping them down over her fingertips.
The winding nature of everything and Duncan’s insistence on making it as knot-like as possible had turned each room into something out of a fever dream, as you could walk into every single room there was and never find a perfectly sharp corner. Each room seemed to curve slightly or bend, and one of the most common structures ended up being a vaguely tube-like shape for many of the bedrooms. Growing up had seen him get lost in identical and dimly lit hallways, where he would sit there and do nothing until his grandfather or the occasional servant found him. It was what had eventually made him love reading so much in the first place, as the second he learned how to read he would be able to carry around a stack with him and begin to read whenever he got lost or was just generally bored. And considering that some of the doors in the house just disappeared or refused to be opened on occasion, it was a good thing that he had found a way to pass the time before he got better at traversing the twisting manor.
He shook his head, his grip on Draco’s hand loosening as he pulled away. Draco lurched forward to close the distance he had created, eyes wide and half-crazed as flames erupted across his arms.
light in order for people to… well, to read. He would be less annoyed with it if the other methods of light in the library had been more effective in keeping the place well lit, but the enchantments on the chandeliers hadn’t been renewed and strengthened since long before he was born, since his grandfather-who was old enough and stubborn enough that he was both unable to do so and refused to teach him how until he had reached his majority-had never bothered with the chandeliers in the library. Even when Theo was just barely into his first few years of being able to read relatively quickly, and was therefore in and out of the library almost constantly, the man refused to fix the lighting issue.
Harry repeated the statement in his mind a few more times as his mentor placed the jar back onto the table and pulled a phial out of a rack on the table, inside which was a blood-red liquid that immediately caught his attention.
“Dear Merlin, Voldemort has returned!”
of romance, if our luck holds out.”
“Okay.”
“I do believe Draco should go to visit heir Potter in France a week early darling, the French sun would do him some good. Perhaps he should stay there for the rest of the summer, in fact.”
“Harry, what do you think this is? Lucius Malfoy disowning his son, the dark mark at the World Cup, Barty Crouch Junior being freed from the imperious... and many other things, I’m sure. It happened in your last life, and it's happening again right now. It isn’t going to stop and it is going to get
Harry seemed less impressed by it. “Just like I said: I don’t need it. I can make plenty of an impression on people without having been a King of Slytherin, and the position is basically just that of a glorified babysitter at this point anyway. I took up the Prince title because I wanted influence, not so that I could look after a bunch of first years when I should be studying.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He turned away, and a blurry rock-like object went soaring out across the pond only to hit the other side of the bank.
“What kinds of things?” She questioned lightly, sipping at the coffee casually as if she hadn’t just asked an impossible question. Harry let his head fall back onto the wicker chair he was sitting on, staring up at the off-white ceiling above him.
The rock was a crude effort in hindsight, but with enough forward momentum, anything could kill a man.
He thought, quickly glancing away as Harry
He stopped suddenly, rubbing a hand down his face as he sighed tiredly. The guilt had been eating away at him for months. There had to have been a way he could have stopped Harry from killing the girl. He had seen the entire thing happening months before the incident. He had known it was going to happen. Even if he didn’t know why, he knew that much. Harry said it himself, he would have listened to anything that Theo had to say on the matter. But… he didn’t speak up. He knew his own reasoning, of course, not wanting to change things past what they were decided to be, but after paying such a hefty price in the name of stability… the thought didn’t sit right with him anymore. If the Woman was going to show him these things, then didn’t that mean he had every right to do what he pleased with the knowledge…?
Harry sighed, shrugging on his shirt as the massive, shadowy mass of his owl, Hades, soared through the window. The creation of Death stared at him blankly, its large golden-green eyes blinking out at him from behind inky-black feathers. They stared at each other for a moment, blankly, before Hades dropped a crumpled envelope from his beak onto the floor, before flying out the window again without a single noise to his coming and going. Harry looked at the envelope now lying on his floor for a moment, studying it, before his eyes skated over to Luna’s letter, sitting on his desk with a few sparse pieces of glitter still stuck to it.
“Sometimes, I think you’ve sacrificed the ability to understand social cues for a stellar intalect, Potter.” He muttered, before pressing closer into the hug, sighing as Harry’s arms wrapped around his shoulders and back.
Not nearly enough, it seemed, though Harry wasn’t about to admit something like that. Draco didn’t seem to believe his half-hearted attempt anyway, and sighed, before pulling the curtains around the large window shut and bathing the compartment in darkness.
They made smalltalk for a time as they discussed the curriculum of Beauxbatons and Hogwarts respectively, with Gabrielle occasionally butting in to ask him a random question about his life. Sirius hadn’t come back with his clothes at all during that brief period, so Harry let the knowledge that the man was probably fine fall to the back of his mind as Fleur lamented about the beautiful school that she went to, and of how she was quite excited for her final year there. He had realized quickly enough that she likely didn’t know about the triwizard tournament, and that it seemed the other schools had made it as much of a secret as Hogwarts had.
He thought morbidly, shaking his head at the thought. No, the door didn’t
“Who said that I would stop taking charge of things?”
himself over his desk as he grasped for a quill and parchment. He didn’t have physical proof, but knowing Tom it wouldn’t be long before the man started making ripples in an effort to regain his forces. It seemed necessary now to close in the walls around Harry Potter as well, especially now that Albus’ head was free of the obstructions the hex bags had shrouded him in.
“Everyone ready?”
“Are you… busy?” He questioned, wondering just what he had walked in on.
Green light fell away into nothingness as he reached the corpse, arm still outstretched as he collapsed beside it, giggling childishly as he whispered the Greek phrases under his breath in delirious half-parseltongue, a darkened hissing overlaying the ancient words as his soul was severed in two. Marvolo’s memory fell away into black, and he regained senses as he crouched over empty space, void of anything but dust. For a moment, all he did was stare at the dust-ridden floor, far away and breathing heavy. That was the last memory he had of being part of the whole, and then he had been thrown into the darkness of his own mind, lost to the decadent insanity that he had been forged from. Horcruxes, after all, existed in the exact moment that they had been conceived, ever-living out the feelings that the whole had been experiencing that the time. It was simply his nature to delight in such play.
He stopped, staring at the hardwood floor underfoot blankly. What on earth was he thinking?
individual back to life, where that one particularly unpleasant individual proceeds to make a rather crass decision and write several letters to several of his most close confidants.
to both their suffering and their happiness. In the end, he doesn't care what happens to anyone who is living, as they are all just this means to an end who's souls will eventually be taken by him. Those who are considered immortal, and therefore he has no eventual control over however, are much more interesting to him as he can actually see them as more than just livestock.
“The first name I wish to honor is that of Lavender Brown, who went missing and is thought to have passed during the collapse of the Gryffindor tower last Halloween. Please spare a moment to remember her.”
“Oh you poor boy, what have they done to you?”
The steps were definitely descending the stairs now, he was sure of it. Would Luna overhear the end of the prophecy? Or was the floor thin enough that she had heard the entire conversation?
Diary horcrux: Also Tom Riddle because they melded so early on lmao (poor kid)
how he would reach a certain age and start to degrade without a philosopher's stone to halt his aging and keep him alive. Without the stone, in a century-maybe even less-Draco would die, and Harry would be left alone and without his soulmate. Would he survive the strain on his soul once that happened? Would he even be able to kill himself if he did?
“Bloody-” he let out a low groan of pain, unused to feeling anything physical at all, much less pain itself. The only thing that could injure him in his own mind was himself. How was this doing him in? “What is
His fist flung outwards instinctively, finding its mark in the form of the stone wall beside him, his anger exploding outwards physically at the remark. There was a distinct cracking sound, and he pulled his arm away, watching with distanced emotion as a large portion of the stone brick fell away and crashed to the floor.
Marvolo stepped over the caretaker’s body, his eyes trained on the entranceway into the manor. He had not initially wished to come here, but after his failed attempt to invade Tom Riddle’s mindscape, he had sourly admitted to himself that the best course of action at the current time would be to find a tucked-away place to stay and gather his bearings. The effort hadn’t been completely in vain, as he had made considerable headway in understanding the connection between a horcrux and the main soul, but the fact remained that Tom Riddle was a much larger part of the whole, and had a considerable amount of magical strength on his side. In the end, it had taken a considerable amount of effort for him to even get inside the mindscape in the first place, and even then all that had gotten through the man’s defences was the barest hints of his subconscious. It had been a wasted effort, in the end.
Harry's horcrux ie. the OG: Tom Riddle. Repeat nickname(s) (there are a lot of one-offs): Riddle, Tom, and dad
“Cheeky.”
If they weren’t, he was worried there wasn’t much he could do to help his friend.
“Who’s not going mad?” Draco blurted, his entire body taught as a wire as Harry whipped around to face him, a look of utter surprise and panic overtaking the exhaustion on his face. Panic, because of what? What reason was Harry-? Draco felt panic of a different sort surge through him, and he gripped the doorframe to keep from outwardly reacting. Something was horribly, terribly wrong. He could feel it.
The echo was back to Tom’s voice, the familiar voice reaching back up from deep inside his mind. Harry wanted to breathe, to sigh or cry or scream. Instead, he rubbed a slow hand down his face as the stale air around him began to warm again, the frost melting back to condensation as he settled himself back into barely-contained fury.
There was another, far more tired sigh from Tom, who just waved vaguely in the air as they reached the bottom steps and traversed the hallway towards the large circular door. “I don’t understand it any more than you do, I assure you, but it’s the only explanation.”
She hummed, before biting into the unidentifiable pastry she had chosen from the platter. “I was never very interested in Quidditch, though I did dabble in the earlier renditions of it in my youth.”
Draco read the entire letter three times before finally letting it fall into his lap, where he stared at it with a particularly pinched expression on his face. The signature at the end of the letter proved that the woman writing to him was a member of the Delacour family, and belonged to a branch of it that was relatively close to the main branch, considering that she was the current lord’s first cousin. However, that was seemingly the only one of his questions that was actually answered with the letter.
understand either, so after a brief pause of attempting to understand, he gave up and nodded along anyway. She seemed to understand that he didn’t understand, and gave him a patent smile, setting down her cup of coffee as she reached for another pastry.
“I am afraid that while you are correct in saying we have conflicting ideals, it is not so much that I refuse to be a part of something that I disagree with, but that you might disagree with my tactics in reaching your own goals if we were to meld together. You see-” he turned away from the shelf he had been studying, revealing a thin booklet clutched between two of his fingers. “-I believe that the tactics my consciousness would feel compelled to employ in the situation you are in would be ones that your’s would not agree with. Mainly being: I do not wish to die for the cause you and dear Hadrian have created.”
He nodded, apparently in agreement, and continued to silently write. She didn’t spare patience much more than a few seconds longer after that, her concern winning out over any amount of respect she carried for his privacy, and she quickly rounded the desk, peering down at the parchment and quickly reading through the first few sentences he had already written out. She too, went as unnaturally pale as her husband, before practically ripping the mysterious letter out of his hand and yanking it open, reading through it in its entirety. Once finished, she paused, looked down at her husband, before reading through the letter a second time.
Tom had a pinched expression, eyes occasionally darting towards the iron door and what was beyond it. “I recognized the blackness that was beyond the hole. It was very similar to the mind of someone who actually has a mind to store memories in. Though… I will say that it seemed noticeably bare, even for the average eighteen year old mind-that was the age that I had made the ring.” He paused for a moment, clearing his throat of something before remarking about it under his breath. “Though I suppose that’s unsurprising considering how many memories I stole from him.”
people at Hogwarts, so being able to talk as loudly as they liked while stretching out as much as they liked was a welcome change. However, the bitterness in Tracey’s voice was hard for her to ignore, and Pansy felt like she never should have extended an invitation to come over in the first place. She should have known that Nigel would be so vile, especially considering how much his head had been inflating since being confirmed as the heir to the Parkinson lordship.
“I would argue that a leg and my family are just as important as my life.” He replied scathingly, his mother’s face immediately crowding up behind his eyes.
Draco peered at him from over his book, eyes narrowed into slits. They sat there for a terse moment, caught in some sort of absurd standoff, before the blond boy sent a short, barely perceivable glance towards Daphne, before he was immediately back to glaring at Blaise.
“It’s going to be okay, Dray. I’m here and I’m not leaving.” He whispered quietly, carding a hand through Draco’s unusually messy hair as the fire slowly, steadily started to dull from the blazing blue inferno to a familiar red, before slowly simmering out into harmless sparks, the fury all but extinguished.
“Don’t worry love, I’m sure you’re a much better dancer than them.”
“Maybe we’re just having two different conversations, honey. Why are you asking me about trusting Harry anyway?” She was hardly going to tell him to stop, but it seemed rather silly after the argument that the two boys had had. Admittedly, she would have been more up for a conversation about it while they were still at Hogwarts and the threat of the two trying to kill each other was still at large, but now that Harry was away in France and Theo was confined to the Rookery, Luna was confident that she could stop any sort of potentially lethal confrontations from happening.
The entity's eyes glimmered in amusement, “I'm sure you both think that way. Pick a new name, soul shard, or remain nameless.”
There was a pause, “I do beg your pardon?”
Harry bit his lip, almost trying to make it bleed despite knowing he couldn’t, before snatching the letter back off of the desk, turning on his heel, and storming out of his room. He didn’t even think as ripped the door open, taking two long strides down the hall to stand in front of Draco’s door. He didn’t comprehend anything as his hand raised, about to bang on the hard oak until the sudden voice of Tom ripped through his mind like the gong of a bell.
Harry’s mind was safe.
“So why haven’t you said anything sooner?” He muttered, grabbing for a biscuit on the plate next to him as she pushed it across the table between them.
Though, she tilted her head with curiosity, perhaps a phoenix’s magic might compare.
“Oh, so you were
He stopped, fist half raised and eyes blown wide, adrenaline rushing through his ears. He obeyed Tom’s order, albeit cautiously, stepping back from the wall and forcing himself to go still. He just… needed to calm down. He needed to do something more than just…
to me?”
Blaise eyed the trunk curiously. He couldn’t help but wonder why Harry hadn’t left it on the train, but he also knew there was very little likelihood that he wanted anything to do with it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry huffed a laugh, his cold, steadying hands leaving Draco’s shoulders as he stepped away and, going off the considerable dip in the cushion beneath his legs, sat down on the other side of the couch from Draco. He groaned in pained anger, bitterly wondering who Harry thought he was, abandoning his soulmate like that, before tucking the thought away for a time that his stomach wasn’t doing somersaults. No, that was an inaccurate descriptor, the bloody thing was doing a synchronized dance with the rest of his organs.
“Hm?”
In the magical world, people appearing out of nowhere was commonplace. Apparition was one of the most popular forms of transportation after all, and all it took was the blink of an eye for a person to show up in an entirely different place from where they had been moments prior. It was a simple fact of life.
“All humans are like that, blue eyes.”
The possibilities were
“I s’pose.” He finally managed, feeling rather proud of himself for such a feat. The darling Lady Malfoy seemed equally impressed, and landed a rather sloppy kiss on his cheek in response, one which involved a peculiarly large amount of tongue, considering how far it had been from his mouth. The man hummed, wrapping a wandering arm around her waist and generally making a bit of a fool of himself as it landed a bit farther down than was considered appropriate, especially considering that his barely fourteen-year-old son was sleeping a mere two doors away, and would no doubt be incredibly inconvenienced by his drunk parents making feverish love in the hall outside his bedroom.
If dying was so easy for him, then why was death so irrevocably silent? When he stood still, there was simply nothing to him anymore. Corpses don’t truly exist in the way that a living thing did, and to be a living mind inside a perfect corpse was a truly unlivable existence. He had to admit that now. He had to admit that he just couldn’t
Blaise nodded enthusiastically in agreement, sparing his sleeping friend another confused glance before he settled onto the seat across from the pair. Harry had… well, calling it a growth spurt felt like understating it. Harry had to have gained nearly three stones in pure muscle over the summer, and a good foot or so in height by the look of it. Blaise didn’t know how to even react to the change, so used to seeing his friend as a tall and almost
Harry lagged back a little as Draco let go of his arm, the other boy pulling a small bag of floo powder from his satchel. Harry looked around the old house, so full of memories and happiness, trying to take it all in and sear it into his memory as the ticking of his pocket watch echoed from his pocket. Maybe he could carve out a piece of his mindscape and make a replica of the estate, if only so he could feel more secure and at home whilst so far away. Because, really, that was what the Flamel estate was to him now. It was his home, just like how the people living within it were his family, in every sense that mattered to him.
Theo stood very still, studying his grandfather as he contemplated the fury inside of him. It was so… potent. He couldn’t quite figure out why. For so long he had pushed himself aside for the issues and demons that his friends had, perhaps this was him finally rebelling from that? It certainly made sense. After all, why did it always have to be him who held back from everything? Why did he have to be the put together one? Harry and Blaise clearly went about whatever they liked, constantly going against his subtle advice despite knowing that he held knowledge of the future. Draco was hardly any different, and always reacted with fire and fury if there was ever an instance of anything even remotely upsetting happening.
“You see, it was found that, after a great deal of bloodletting, that you simply can't use your own blood to mix with your own magic, as nothing will happen, and the use of another magical person’s blood will combine the two seperate magics and create great complications, so the only possible way to create this mixture is to use the blood of another human who has no magic of their own. During the time of the ancient Greeks this was a nonissue, since the ‘muggles’ as you Brittons call them saw the Greek sorcerers as gods to be ruled by, and would give up their blood gladly. However, it is not that simple of a task these days.”
Pansy huffed, quickly putting her shoes back on before pulling the taller girl back onto the path. “The break in the grove should be just up here, and it's hardly that complicated-just family dynamics.”
Her eyes followed the group as they meandered over to the Slytherin table, missing a particularly important piece to their puzzle that Luna couldn’t help but notice.
“Centaurs and the Worship of Callisto? No that's not-why are so many of these about centaurs?” He grumbled to himself morosely, eyes darting over the worn letters on the spines of ancient tomes. Despite the various and immense issues that he had had with Cantankerous Nott over the expanse of his years, Theo could admit that the man at least cared for his grandson and wished him the best. Of course, what was best for him was oftentimes up for debate, and Theo had the long-standing opinion that the man’s idea of ‘best’ was rather skewed towards him having a place in high society. As it was, by his grandfather’s logic, more recent events were most certainly
Perenelle also nodded, though her eyes were more watery than conspiratorial. “Good… oh, goodness Hadrian, I don’t know how I’ll manage without you there during breakfast. Everything will be so… oh I can see it now. Everything will be so painfully dull!”
Nicolas poured the molten metal into a small cup-like container, the brightly shining liquid dripping into it like sludge. The workroom was hot, and smelt of a sulfur and ash that Harry had grown accustomed to after so many brushes with Death.
Tom brought his hand down
“Yes, Potter, distracting. What with the… hands.” His sarcastic response tapered off as Harry leaned forward, and without a single pause, landed a searingly cold kiss on Draco’s forehead. He froze, feeling more than seeing as Harry pulled away before pressing another kiss to Draco's temple. The contact sparked, crackling as their differences in temperature collided. Harry’s hands, still pressed into his cheeks, crackled and sizzled as well, though not in a painful way, he hoped. Harry certainly didn’t move, didn’t even flinch as their body temperatures fought an unending battle.
“I’m… my name’s Barty.” He mumbled, not quite sure what to do with the woman’s questions as his lord continued to seemingly ignore him in favor of the Malfoy boy with him.
The nameless man seemed amused at that response, his eyebrow tilting upwards with a slight turn of his lip, as if he found Tom’s understanding to be infantile or crude. It was very likely that he did, and despite that realization, Tom couldn’t help but feel that his intelligence being insulted was a cause for great annoyance. He quirked a brow in return, his fiery red eyes narrowing in distaste.
Harry let Draco pull him along towards a waiting Perenelle, who had a comically large map in her hand and seemed to be trying to find the nearest plot of unclaimed land for a tent. She folded it back up as they approached, and quickly shoved it into one of her pockets. Harry raised an eyebrow, wondering why she hadn’t bothered to claim a plot for their tent. He had told her that there was a large, night-long party afterward, right?
It was so, so cold.
"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!"
He stopped, fist half-raised and eyes blown wide and wild with anger. He gulped tightly, his grip on the letter loosening as his father’s voice echoed through his skull, gentle and utterly authoritative.
“Look at that boy Fleur, he is so tall!”
Barty swallowed wetly, sucking in a sharp breath as the boy’s gait completely changed. It was just barely noticeable, but Barty could tell when it happened. He could recognize his lord for who he was. His lord walked smoother, more elegantly than Harry Potter. The boy… Harry Potter, walked like a wolf stalking after its prey, animalistic and sluggish and taking its time. Held taught by thin strands of wire. Waiting for the right time to strike. His lord wasn’t like that. His lord, visceral and elegant and cruel, strode like a tyrant walking through the halls of a conquered kingdom. Lord Voldemort walked like he was carrying the head of his mortal enemy in one hand and the crown of a fallen kingdom in the other.
Crouch is still
His father sighed lowly, rubbing a tired hand down his face as they neared the steps. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think the ring horcrux has gained a physical form.”
His mother brushed herself down, glancing up at her husband with a loaded expression. Draco peered down at his shoes, pointedly ignoring the heavy glances between the pair as his father’s hand tightened around his shoulder. It looked like there was some dirt stuck to the side of his left shoe, or maybe it was just the light? They were a burgundy dragon-hide after all, so maybe the light was glancing off it to make some sort of illusion. Draco wiggled his ankle, watching the light glint and further illuminate the brown spot. Definitely dried mud then.
His shoulders sagged, and Harry closed his eyes with a hissed groan, letting his head fall forward and thunk silently onto the door in front of him as he finally lowered his arm.
Perenelle : "Parfait! Allons voir ce dont tu es capable!"
They both laughed, warm and light and happy. The tension between them was broken, thawed like ice on a hot summer day. Draco looked down at their intertwined hands, at how Harry’s fingers alone stretched the length of Draco’s entire hand. Their difference in size felt comical with Harry’s new growth spurt to contend with, and once again Draco was glad for his own, nearly laughing at the thought of what they could have looked like next to each other if he had continued to be stunted.
“Stir in the nettles now, Hadrian.”
Who was going to stop him, when the very gods had given him form? No one, of that Marvolo knew for certain.
Jolting, Barty nearly fell out of the chair, scrambling for stability as his legs flew out haphazardly, his arms barely managing to keep under the security of the invisibility cloak as he fought for balance. Gripping at the armrests, he sucked a deep breath in, eyes wide and crazed as his head swiveled around the room, searching out his father instinctively. The man wasn’t there, he hadn’t been for the entire game. Heartbeat in his ears, Barty took great gulps of air, entire body electrified as he gazed around the room in wonder. Why had his father broken the imperious? Why then, of all times? How? Where had he been? The thoughts and questions swam through his head, disrupting all other thoughts as he fought to understand the autonomy he was suddenly being allowed.
“Alright.” He started warily, watching with a mix of curiosity and confusion as his mentor placed the full jar next to an empty one. “But
“I’m fine. I’m just fine boy, don’t worry yourself.” Harry muttered apologies as he stepped back again and Nicolas brushed himself off, looking vaguely nauseous as he did. Harry held back more concern as the man strode forward to pick the silty liquid up to the light, observing its color with the eye of someone who had been doing this for centuries.
“Well, Harry, humans have nerves-”
There was no one there in that hallway with him. He was alone. Tom wasn’t there. Hadn’t ever been anywhere but his mind. Harry stood stiff, staring at the spot that he had been
Harry didn’t speak, he didn’t do anything besides pull Draco closer, holding him steady as his body shook with grief and anger and fear. So, so much fear. Harry could feel all of it through the bond, all the cold anger and shock and terrible, horrible fear.
“Yes… yes, hello! To all our students returning today, welcome back! And if today is your first day at Hogwarts… well, welcome to you as well!”
Nicolas hummed absentmindedly, “are you worried that the past will repeat itself?”
for Slytherin Princess, why would you just throw that away because it’s-”
“Oh of
Albus whipped around, stumbling over himself in an effort to get to his desk as fast as he could. Fawkes squawked angrily at the sudden disturbance, bursting away in a small explosion of fire as Albus practically
just because I always end up really hating the way that I draw blood and guts (likely due to lack of practice, lmao who knew). However, with this I couldn't exactly just
NIcolas gave him a curious look, nodding slightly as he poured it into the jar, in which there was an immediate reaction. A fizzing sound erupted from the jar, and the blood began to mix and change color as the concoction once again shifted, this time to the familiar inky-black. Harry watched it with confusion, trying to understand how a simple concoction of magic and blood could create the Alchemist’s Hand. Was that really it? The secret behind ancient alchemy was water, magic, and blood?
“Stop it, you ponce.”
This is the first chapter out after making the discord and I'm... a little scared.
“Portkeys.” Perenelle muttered, brushing down the thick wool of her skirt before looking back at the two of them as if nothing were amiss. “I must admit, portkeys don’t appeal to me very much. I’ve had them stolen a time or two and have been stranded because of it, so I tend to prefer flying, really.”
“Peculiar… very peculiar.” He didn’t want to try anything with the strange hole until asking Harry what he thought, as it was technically his head as well. Sadly though, Harry was currently asleep, and would likely be very against any sort of nighttime exploration of a seemingly endless open space inside his own mind.
decided to pay him a visit?
He shook his head, slapping a hand to his face before stumbling back half a step.
And so, the great hall fell into silence.
Where had the god gone off to? Was he just biding his time until Blaise got to a certain age or was there something more going on? Was Blaise faking his ease and was he actually suffering?
him. Not once, but twice. The first time he could excuse as a heat of the moment action, but the second had been premeditated in the very least. Did his grandfather truly hate the Lovegoods so much that he would lash out in that kind of way? Or was it due to something completely different?
He jostled backwards, visibly surprised by the sudden voice. His mother seemed to be itching to riffle through his trunks, likely wanting another excuse to hold him up for longer. Sighing lightly, he hefted both up in each hand, giving her an understanding-if rather annoyed-glance. She sighed through her nose, hands clasped together and foot tapping an erratic beat into the hardwood floor.
The will to survive. It was something that Voldemort was deeply familiar with. Tom Riddle, however, the one who had only memories of the world outside of his son’s mind, was unfamiliar with such a concept. He had forfeited the will to live after making his decision so many years ago, and now saw such a need to be foolhardy. It was so… selfish. The idea of someone like him still believing themselves above the gods and above time, disgusted him. Tom had no illusions anymore. He didn’t deserve to hold onto the crown of immortality that he had not even inherited in the first place. Gripping onto it when he knew it was not his to have was a wasted effort.
“What did he say to you, Harry. Tell me right now.
Tom took a deep breath, gathering himself as he imagined a large shelf made of pure iron into being in front of the wall of darkness, blocking it from gaining entrance further inside of his own mind. Stumbling backwards, he leaned some weight into the bookshelf behind him, breathing heavily as the pain in his head doubled and the ringing became near-unbearable.
Many were still outraged with the death of Ginevra Weasley, labeling it an oversight of the ninth degree. Many were angry with Albus Dumbledore especially, positing that not only did he commit a grievous oversight by knowingly hiring a werewolf, but that he was adding insult to injury by defending said werewolf at every turn. Many of those on the Wizengamot were taking the chance to vilify the Chief Warlock to the best of their abilities, stating that he was clearly unfit for the roles he had, stating that he should step down from one now that it was clear he was declining in both age and ability. Many parents of students at Hogwarts were demanding action, and demanding that someone more fit and capable take over the role of choosing teachers for the school. Many students seemed unsure if they wanted to continue at Hogwarts at all, and many of the younger years were wondering if other schools in Europe or even overseas in the states might take them on instead.  It certainly didn’t help all of the chaos once news broke that Remus Lupin had escaped the temporary confines he had been housed in at Hogwarts, doing so the same day that all the children returned home on the Hogwarts express. The thought of a dangerous werewolf potentially sneaking about on a train full of children made even more people outrageously angry, and many of the more intellectually inclined started to theorize that foul play was somehow involved in Lupin’s crimes, as well as his subsequent escape.
As his excitement skyrocketed to heights that Barty hadn’t felt in over a decade, his body started to eat a stale slice of toast.
“One!”
The memory of Theo’s bogart came rushing back to him in that moment, of the familiar green eyes and hair-raising cackle. He cursed, realizing that the goddess’s meddling went far deeper than he could have expected. Was she purposefully trying to drive a wedge between him and Theo? Or was there something else going on that ran even deeper than that?
“Who did you get a letter from, Harry?”
Theo jerked away from her suddenly, his voice bitter. “He’s shown who he is well enough. I don’t need to go out of my way to ask.” She felt a spike of annoyance for no particular reason other than he was being difficult, and sat straight up to glare where she thought might be his eyes.
“So that’s why-”
“You need to leave, Locket. I won’t entertain your inane ramblings for a moment longer.”
“Alright. Keep going.” He muttered, closing his eyes as Draco’s shoulders loosened slightly. Harry didn’t want to force emotion out of him, especially not while he was trying to come to terms with the sudden change in the best way he could manage.
“I apologize, my dear, but I have found myself protective of the boy after learning of his life.” He sighed, before standing from his chair. “Speaking of which, I do believe it is about time I return home. I do hope you will manage to control the direction of Albus’ attention, Olympe. I wish you well.”
“Shit. Shit.
Marvolo let the tarp fall, and returned to his ghostly recreation of the chase.
With that final remark, and a soft exclamation for him to enter from beyond the door, Nicolas finally turned away from the other man and opened the door. Shutting it softly behind him, he waited only a moment before locking it, and turned to look at his dear friend for the first time in many years. Olympe looked tired, sitting back in her massive chair with a glass of red wine in one hand and her head in the other.
“I do beg your pardon?” Daphne whispered, her expression caught between dull shock and pure horror. Blaise rather thought it looked incredible on her.
Tom fell into another coughing fit, curling over his stomach as he sporadically cursed about the sting in his eyes. Harry cautiously drew closer, his eyes suddenly focusing in on a stream of bright red blood flowing from Tom’s ear.
into that familiar embrace. The cold overtook him, chilling and familiar and oh so wonderfully needed. He had forgotten what it was like to feel cold, had somehow forgotten that he was ever-burning. Harry muttered something indescribable, an ‘I missed you’ most likely. Draco muttered an agreement, not paying any attention to words when feeling was that much more potent. Harry’s arms were fast against his back, pressing just hard enough as to not hurt his wings. Harry had gotten larger, somehow, and not only in height. His back muscles felt more defined, as if he had been doing manual labor for hours on end each day. His hug nearly fully enveloped Draco, drowning him in the cold and the green and Harry-all of it was Harry.
Harry frowned in Tom’s general direction but did what he was told, finding that the wards were nearly complete anyway. He felt them snap into place quickly, stepping backwards as the man besides him sagged in relief. Harry had no idea what was going on, of that he was sure, but Tom clearly had been very concerned about the breach in security, so he supposed that everything was fine now.
Harry stopped in place, his eyebrows furrowed as she turned back to look at him. “Do you mean to say we should just… wing it?”
in a way that was hard to fully express. And, he did understand Harry, in a very easy, digestible way. He understood a lot of things about Harry, but…
for you to not lead our house-”
“I'm just fine Perenelle. It may surprise you but there is quite a bit of underage drinking at Hogwarts. I can manage my liquor well enough.” He took a sip of the water anyway, if just to appease her. She seemed to take that as a sign that he needed no more coddling and quickly set off to snatch the breakfast away from the stove before it was burnt, muttering on about cooking spells being far too finicky.
to take care of another? Harry was
Nicolas’ eyes went hard, and he let go of Harry’s shoulder in order to pull out the chair next to him and sit down in it, attentive and horribly serious. Serious in a way that refused him any room for doubt. There was no going back from what he had said, and as Pernelle also rose from her seat at the far end of the table, Harry was confronted with the realization that he really would have to tell them everything. Absolutely everything.
“And yet, nothing happened.”
He hummed, torn between the two.
“I got a letter last night, and another one this morning. Neither of them had anything particularly pleasant in them. I feel like both on top of each other are driving me mad.” He admitted, reaching forward for his lukewarm tea as she made a noise of concern.
It wasn’t a very large pond.
Instead of an answer, he only got more questions. Xenophilius shook his head gently, hands palming a strange talisman wrapped around his neck.
Harry knows
The realization barreled down onto him with ferocity, and Albus jerked in place as he realized his situation. He
The towering doors of the entrance opened for him with familiarity, welcoming him back, and Nicolas was greeted by a familiar entrance hall as he stepped inside, the elaborate and lavish decor beckoning him further inwards. For once, he didn’t feel as inclined to smile and enjoy the architecture as he usually was, his mind far more focused on the task at hand as he turned towards the nearest spiral stairway and started to climb up to the fourth floor, where Olympe’s office was located. He passed nothing but portraiture during his climb, the eerie stillness doing well to remind him that it was indeed summertime and the children were home.
His head was clouded and stormy as the train slowed to a stop, lacking the amusement from before and only growing worse as they all started to gather up their things and join the mob of other students trekking up from Hogsmeade and over to the carriages. He thought long and hard on the issues Draco might be facing—issues that Blaise himself had no way of helping with—as they neared the carriages. His attention was drawn from the thoughts slightly as they came upon the carriages, and he watched idly as the thestrals stomped at the ground impatiently, their macabre appearance making the strangely normal motion particularly absurd. The sound of Harry snorting made him turn to his left, eyes pinning onto Harry’s face. His friend was observing the thestrals as well, though with something more akin to amusement than disgust, as he had. Blaise followed Harry’s gaze, finally finding his way back to the thestrals who had begun to get a little antsy, yanking at the binds that held them as if trying to escape.
It seemed that he could stand there and contemplate millions of possibilities, but there would be no way for him to know for sure what his father wanted from Harry, or if he wanted anything at all. He would, of course, tell Harry about his father’s wish, and then he would make sure that Harry didn’t do anything
sentient, but he didn’t feel particularly confident saying that it absolutely
He slammed the book shut, turning to glare as Harry thumped his chest a few times, clearing his throat as he fought to get his laughter under control. Draco watched, utterly unamused, as the boy made a show of calming down, going so far as to brush invisible lint from his thin muggle 'tank top' before finally turning to Draco’s waiting gaze.
There was the light again, twisting through the air around his soul as if waiting for something. It was… cold, and smelt like smoke and brimstone. The light felt completely unlike his own magic, which had always been searingly hot and viciously burning, a strike of fire in an utterly wasteful world. Many akin to spices and bitterness, the heat vicious as it cut across you like a dull knife. This coldness, this nothingness that it vacated… he couldn’t help but be curious as to what it might be. It was clearly an intruder, but had no obvious intentions that he could discern.
As much as he liked to ignore the fact, Harry had to admit to himself that memories stick. They cling to you like parasites or leeches, sucking and zapping away any new knowledge you have surrounding an individual. The Dursleys, while brilliant now, still had memories applied to them. Harry could not forget the cupboard, and he could not forget their hatred, even if it was fabricated and untrue. With those memories, leeching away at the edges of his perception of them, he was incapable of fully placing himself into their family, no matter how much all of them tried. But Nicolas, and Perenelle, had no memories attached to their character that might taint them in negatives. He had not even met them in his past life, and in this instance he realized just how much of a blessing that was.
Family dynamics. The more accurate word would be family hierarchy, but she had been told many years prior to never say that in front of polite company-or any company at all. The family ‘dynamic’ was a concept that she had had ingrained in her from a young age-practically as an infant, she would wager.
His second office’s location is rather mysterious, as whenever the man is asked for the location he states that it is situated somewhere along the coast of Austria. Of course, considering that Austria is landlocked and therefore has no coast, it has been assumed by anyone who hears this reply that the man is rather lacking in geography knowledge and meant to say Australia, which while being quite a bit farther away, is still quite doable for such a rich man. They go further to assume that, being such an esteemed and well-regarded individual, Lord Lucius Malfoy might have willingly taken on such an exorbitant international floo fee so that he could discuss business propositions with clients that were situated in Australia, and that the office has nothing but the purest of intentions. In truth, they are right in believing that the Lord Malfoy would willingly take on exorbitant international floo fees for a cause that he found to be needed, but would be wrong in believing that he had pure intentions with such fees. In fact, his second office is situated along the coast of Alaska in the states, which is, while admittedly rather similar to Austria and Australia in terms of sharing the first letter of ‘A’, is about as far off course as one can possibly get. What gets done in the office off the coast of Alaska is anyone’s guess, though considering how often his wife joins him on ‘business trips’ to the office, it can be easily inferred that the office might have a fold-out couch, or ample space for a tipsy couple to… prostrate themselves.
The molten metal in the container, which was once a strange mix of copper and iron, had been completely eaten away at by the blackened liquid, which now squirmed and shook in what could almost be described as discomfort.
across the face.
“Is he going to be our defense instructor?”
Was this how he had looked during breakfast, pulled taut as a wire and seething? He tentatively reached out a hand, his fingertips just barely brushing against Draco’s temple as their eye contact held.
“In the case of turning lead into gold, it is a simple process of taking the infantile spirit of lead, and forcing that magic to mature until it is gold. Lead, from a magical or in this case

But... the fact that Loki seemed to have gone silent worried her.
another fortnight, hoping that he could drive home his frustration as effectively as possible before the school year started. Yet, when Barty Crouch, the bastard that he was, somehow bummed a ride along with their portkey, he hadn’t gotten much of a choice but to ‘forgive’ Tom for all the nonsense on his birthday without being able to ask many questions about the entire ordeal. Tom had taken the opportunity the second it arose, which was par for the course, and had been quick to forcefully wrangle himself out of any blame.
“I need some tea.” He muttered to himself, slowly backtracking to his bedroom, intent on hiding the letter away for now.
“Argument my arse.” Theo muttered under his breath, thinking over the destructive class that she had referred to as an ‘argument’ He would be more inclined to call it a conflict of morals that transcended far more than what friendship could correct for, but he couldn’t tell her that. He didn’t really know how to explain it, but the entire situation felt like it was
Draco whipped his head up, following Harry’s finger as it pointed towards a thin man with sallow skin and a mile-long stare, standing around with a few people wearing Bulgarian colors. He blinked, watching as the man awkwardly stumbled over his own feet, needing to be caught by a man beside him, who laughed before patting him on the back.
“Uh… right.”
"Parfait! Allons voir ce dont tu es capable!"
So, she sat there, watching with narrowed eyes as the not-Moody sat down heavily at the professor’s table. She watched him closely, observing every little flicker of his soul as the headmaster started speaking once more.
The point being, those who were so unfortunately out of the loop about the most recent passings of great lords in Britain, might be so untoward as to send the late Abraxas Malfoy some post through the owl mail, and poor Lucius Malfoy might be so unfortunate to be the one it is delivered to instead of his beloved father. Of course, in most instances this is not so troubling, as Abraxas Malfoy had a selection of...
It was quite simple really. She was at the lowest rung on the tree, as she was not a ‘true’ Parkinson and therefore didn’t have any chances of becoming the heir, even if both of her brothers were out of the running. Her youngest brother Carrick came next, as he was well respected in his chosen field as the owner of a moderately large potion ingredient producer and had a sizable income to match. That didn’t immediately mean that they were almost equals however, as he hardly considered her anything more than his mother’s mistake and ignored her every chance he got. Pansy was certain she hadn’t had more than three conversations with him over her life, and didn’t particularly want any more.
“If you don’t shut your mouth, I’ll have no choice but to cut out your tongue.” He snapped, stalking forward as the Locket roared with laughter, yanking at its restraints furiously as he threw an arm out and slapped it
In an instant, the sky above him was ripped away, replaced by a familiar towering form as a large hand grabbed a fistful of his hair and yanked up to his knees. Yelping, he instinctively grabbed at his injured arm, clutching it close to his body as a wand was shoved under his chin and his head was forced up to meet
“Dray-”
Harry nodded, about to reply before he quickly got sidetracked, turning to watch as Draco’s nose crinkled up in distaste. He followed the blond boy’s line of sight, sighing slightly as the pudgy form of Minister Fudge came scrambling over to them, the Bulgarian minister trailing behind with a confused expression. Brilliant.
Voldemort began to turn over, eyes trailing up the shadowy space he inhibited until he finally laid eyes on the wisps of golden-green light. He let out a curious breath as he fell onto his back, having managed such a feat despite his injuries.
Harry hiccuped, finally pulling his face out of his hand in order to turn and bury it into the man’s shirt like a child. The hand on the back of his head steadied him in the movement, and he felt Perenelle take his other hand as well. He had never been held like this before, like he needed comfort. Perhaps he had; Harry didn’t know for certain if he had or not. Growing up the second time, he had never cried, or asked for comfort from either of the adults in his life. The thought had never even passed his mind, but sitting in that chair, sobbing into his mentor’s shirt, Harry wondered if things would have been different if it had. Would he have been different, more amenable and put-together, if he had been able to ask the Dursleys for comfort? Would it have helped him heal from his first life? Would he have lived his second differently?
“Be wary, Favorite. The boy of which your prophecy speaks of no longer lives, of that I am sure.”
more than that of the normal floo, a revelation that he wished he could have had earlier, before he had gone and stormed into the blasted thing. Draco grit his teeth as the world spun past him, the fireplaces that he would have once considered slightly discernable now nothing but a blur as he passed them by. Did it usually take this long for him to travel from one point to another? Draco couldn’t recall a time that he was in the floo for longer than five seconds. It seemed that international floo, while faster and more aggressive, also took much longer than normal. Once again he was tempted to shut his eyes, if only to abate the nausea bubbling up from his throat as the world continued to spin.
“I wouldn’t bet on it. But, please, if you would just… just hear me out, I would appreciate it. And if you don’t want me here once I’m done speaking, then I’ll leave. But please, just let me say everything I have to.”
Harry sighed, rubbing a hand down his tired face before glancing towards his trunk lying innocently on the ground.
Something was very, very wrong.
“My daughter often has nightmares of her mother. I am sure that she would make a vision known if she had had one, but would likely refuse to speak of a painful reminder of the… the accident. Yes yes, that is my Luna.” Xenophilius remarked, the man’s unseeing eyes focused onto a mason jar of honey sitting on the counter. “If she wishes to speak of it with you, Favorite, then she will.”
He studied the emptiness for a moment, contemplating it with narrowed eyes. It was strangely familiar in a way that he couldn’t entirely place. It reminded him of what Harry’s mindscape had looked like before it had been fully constructed, when there had been nothing but the occasional passing memory that he could latch onto or the whisper of thoughts that the boy might have through the day. Humming, perturbed with the familiarity, Tom neared the hole again and reached out with practiced ease, searching for that familiar tug of a memory as he tried to grasp onto it. At first, he tried to reach out for a memory he shared with Harry, but upon gaining nothing but a book from his own library soaring from the stacks to hit him in the head, he cautiously settled for a memory of his school years.
The lythe man’s voice was scratchy, from either misuse or overuse, Draco couldn’t tell. He couldn’t consider which one it could be as the man’s hand left Harry’s and suddenly came to a stop in front of him. Draco blinked, sparing a confused glance Harry’s way before taking the outstretched hand as it was offered to him, opening and closing his mouth a few times before finally finding the ability to speak.
The somber moments of silence seemingly forgotten, a rowdy applause shook the room as people far back near the entrance hopped up from their seats to get a better look at the living legend before them. The not-Moody’s soul seemed obscenely excited about the entire ordeal, as it flickered about in an array of nervous twitches that Luna didn’t like at
He didn’t really know what to do about the man. On one hand, anyone as utterly devoted to Voldemort as he was was someone to get rid of as quickly as possible, but on the other, Harry didn’t know if Barty Crouch was even that much of a threat. Sure, he was a Death Eater, and thoroughly indoctrinated into the cult of personality that Voldemort had developed, but the Voldemort that he served was thoroughly and utterly dead. How would Barty react if he came to learn that the Dark Lord he would be serving was one considerably younger and, if Tom was to be believed, thoroughly out of the loop?
“Whatever do you mean?”
“... It’s a little funny,” Harry muttered, still looking like he was fighting to keep the laughter down. Draco shook his head one final time, fighting down his own smile as it threatened to eke out around his lips. Harry grinned mischievously, leaning down into his personal space and making a point to be particularly
As the sluggish heat of summer swelters away into the dull ache of September, Luna Lovegood comes to the sudden and distinct realization that every question she ever needed answered had been right there besides her, waiting patiently to be asked.
The bracelet.
“Bloody hell Harry, can you get any taller?” He jerked at the sudden voice before letting out a cough-like laugh, turning slightly towards where the voice came from and finding nothing but air. Blinking for a moment, he comically peered down to find that he had a rather good view of the top of his godfather’s head, at least until the man stepped back to better look at his face. “You’ve got to be, what, well into six foot by now, yeah?”
“Many of you may be wondering why you were asked to bring along dress robes this year, and I promise you that it is for a very good reason. You see, we will be hosting a Yule ball this winter.”
“Of course. You there, Harry Potter?”
“Yes, I think so too.”
Tom took a moment to take in the analisis before nodding in agreement, finally glancing away from the icy blue eyes in order to refocus downwards to his intertwined hands. He had known for some time-perhaps instinctively-that no matter how many memories he regained he would never truly be able to embody those memories. They were simply information that would allow him to better understand his soul’s past, but had no effect on his consciousness as it was now, and how it had been since before absorbing the remaining soul of Voldemort.
The man tisked, shaking his finger at Tom as if he were a petulant child. “Incorrect. People faced with horrible situations in which society has collapsed, still have morals. Different morals yes, but morals all the same. Hadrian, when faced with such a situation, would feel nothing about his actions and would see no issue with them, no matter how horrible and cruel. A human living in a post apocalyptic wasteland might murder others, yes, but they will likely feel inclined to protect their family and keep those they care about safe in direct contrast with that. Hadrian is not like this.”
The blood had dried dark, almost black from age and grime. The bowl of fruits that the painting once illustrated was almost completely covered by the stain, the barest inklings of a pear peeking out from underneath the splatter. Marvolo looked at it for a sparse moment, his mind wandering still to the feeling of utter delight as he severed Lady Riddle’s spinal cord and ripped her stomach open with precise slashes of his wand. Lord Riddle had screamed, only held back from running to her by his cowardly son, who had screamed at him to leave the love of his life behind to die.
Harry looked away. He couldn’t look into those stormy, smoky gray eyes anymore.
Tom almost seemed… distinct.
“Six…”
“It is a pleasure to meet you, Lord and Lady Flamel.” He finally forced out, the effort making him feel as though he was one more attempt away from losing his breakfast. A woman laughed, the distinct scratching of porcelain against wood causing him to, after a pained pause, look away from the heels of his hands. A teacup filled to the brim with steaming hot tea was now sitting next to him on the coffee table, and the older woman who had seemingly pushed it his way smiled kindly. He blinked, taken back by her appearance. How could someone look so young and so old at the same time? Her hair was white as a sheet and her hands and face were old and wrinkled, but there was a feeling of potent childishness about her that felt incredibly out of place. She looked timeless, whatever timelessness was supposed to look like.
“And you’ll be sure to thank the Flamels for their hospitality, yes?”
A smile, just the faintest flickers.
“But you thought it, did you not?”
All she managed was a watery smile, dabbing at the corners of her eyes with the handkerchief as she did. “Yes… yes, that would be wonderful. Well, I wish you both safe travels.”
He stared at the page blankly for a moment, not quite able to entirely focus on the words printed there, before sighing tiredly. Reaching out with one hand, he snatched up Harry’s considerably larger one and intertwined their fingers, squeezing slightly to the confused noise Harry made in response. He only had to wait a moment to get a squeeze back, feeling his mind and soul relax slightly as Harry noticeably relaxed, his head lolling back against the couch cushions as his entire body seemed to finally settle down. Draco settled back himself, finally being able to focus on the book in his hand as the crisis averted itself.
The man laughed, finally turning to face him from across the room. Theo realized that his eyes appeared to be unseeing-staring off into the middle distance as if there was nothing to look at. Was the man blind? “Oh I’m sure you know who I am referencing, young man. Or do you not know of the cold eyes of Fate?”
Theo nodded to himself slowly, his eyes wandering back to the walls as Luna pressed a seal into the slowly cooling wax. “So you want to go?”
Harry stared at the letter for a long, long time, re-reading it over and over until the ink blurred and every word didn’t look real anymore. He re-read the words until they swam through his mind like a school of fish, disrupting every thought he had as the words sank deep into his dead heart and stayed there, decaying along with him. He didn’t think, he didn’t know if he even could, as the ink on the paper blurred and diluted to the point that it was all gibberish, just scrambled letters on a paper.
Harry’s voice, sounding so relaxed and calm, would have been soothing if the bastard wasn’t acting as if Draco wasn’t seconds from throwing up the day’s worth of meals. Coughing wetly, he crouched down, head between his knees and a curse readied on his lips as his head throbbed and stomach idly threatened to come racing up his esophagus.
from the dancers, instead of the opposite. He wondered idly if that was due to the soul bond or the simple fact of his inhumanity. Turning slightly to Draco, he nearly snorted at the expression he sported, one with an acute disgust that rivaled any other he could have managed.
He shifted slightly, patting around in the grass for a moment before finding her hand. He snatched it up, planting a sleepy kiss on her palm, before linking their fingers together.
A door opened, then slammed shut.
Tom looked at the hole, his head tilted to one side and eyes narrowed in both worry and confusion. It was particularly unlikely that the horcrux had been destroyed, especially considering where it was currently locked away. It didn’t help that him and Harry were currently in France, and had been there for several hours. It seemed, to him at least, that the death of his most troublesome horcrux was not only, sadly, quite unlikely, but probably impossible considering that there still seemed to technically still be a connection of some sort.
The sunlight was hitting his back directly, and the heat reminded Harry of blond hair and pink lips.
Barty felt whatever that had frozen him in place suddenly thaw, and in a daze he stumbled forward, body and mind and soul pulled towards those eyes of green upon green upon green. The shamble turned into a sprint near-instantly as a different green, a far more familiar, insidious green, lit up the air around him, illuminating that scarred face and sinful green eyes with its glow. He reached out, fingers grazing against death itself as he gripped tightly to the man’s shirt, practically collapsing as shock sent waves of adrenaline through him.
“Or not go mad.” Harry remarked, the exhaustion in his face breeding something darker as he seemed to sag against the back of his chair. Draco felt a rush of emotions surge through him at the sight, and subconsciously straightened, glancing around for signs of…
Immediately as he said the first line, the other man’s smile vanished, and he leaned forward with a serious expression painted across his face. Theo felt unsettled by the ferocity in his eyes, but continued anyway, noticing that the footsteps above them were moving towards where he thought he had seen the stairs being.
can assist in.” She started with a flourish, turning around sharply as he started glancing around at the strange objects on the front desk. The woman began pottering around a massive workbench behind it as he did, grabbing up all manner of strange doodads and little squares of purple silk as she continued with her peculiar explanation.
It was infuriating, how so much had been going on under his nose for so long. He hadn’t a clue how much of Harry Potter was the boy he had painstakingly forged and who was Tom Riddle’s own conscience. Was that why the boy had gone to Slytherin in the first place? Tom Riddle’s conscience acting as a puppeteer and forcing him in the direction most beneficial for Tom’s twisted plans? Could he even salvage the Harry Potter that he had created, or would it be better to kill the boy and start afresh with Neville Longbottom? It was hardly ideal, but if it was necessary to kill Tom then Albus was certain he could find a way.
“Through our individual conscience, we become aware of our deeply held moral principles, we are motivated to act upon them, and we assess our character, our behavior and ultimately our self against those principles. Different philosophical, religious and common sense approaches to conscience have emphasized different aspects of this broad characterization. Hadrian, simply put, does not embody this awareness. He has no moral principles. Sure, he can understand morals that he has held in the past and morals that society itself has, but he feels nothing in regards to them. It is clear that if there were no consequences for his actions, Hadrian simply would act however he pleased.”
“I wonder what you’re trying to keep hidden, Thomas?”
“You’ve got one last chance at life Voldemort, don't waste it.”
He sighed, rubbing his eyes as he looked back up to Harry’s window, blinking with surprise as his soulmate appeared in front of it again, swiftly opening it before quickly vacating the space. Draco soon learned why, as the massive form of Hades quickly flew out and into the sky, carrying with him a large bundle of what Draco had to assume was all the paperwork tied with thick twine around the owl’s talon. He watched as Harry waved the bird off, before his gaze shifted down to the three of them on the ground.
would be utterly divine, he did so desperately wish for a change in scenery.
His words to Theo during their argument echoed through his skull, and Harry sighed again, feeling the beginnings of guilt creep into his mind. It had been a low blow, and Harry couldn’t help but feel like he had lost quite a bit of Theo’s trust for it, but even things said in the heat of the moment couldn’t be taken back. He would just have to wait and see what would happen when they saw each other again.
death is not one that can be toppled off his throne by something as simple as a revolution. Be careful, dear Favorite of our messenger, and try to decide if his rule is something that would save or destroy us all.”
With a start, Luna practically leaped out of her bed and ran to her desk, shuffling around for a quill and parchment. She had to write to Harry, or the woman was sure to be back soon, but about what? She could ask how he was doing, maybe, or see if he wanted her to come visit for his birthday next week. Sure, the international floo expenses would be grievous, but perhaps her daddy could manage to get them a discount?
Harry nodded slowly, resting his elbows on his knees as he gazed at the west wall, which had certainly seen better days after the rather aggressive attack. “But how had any of this happened in the first place? And why exactly do you think the ring has gained a body because of it?”
The locket was obviously vying for Marvolo’s affections, and it seemed to have, sadly, gotten just enough information from the exchange between his idiotic son and his soulmate to know that Lucius Malfoy had sent a very…
It seeped into him, cold and hard and unfeeling, and as he felt the hard rock of shock settled deep into his gut, Draco seemed to unwind more and more, the anger finally becoming palpable as fire-real, harsh fire-roared up from between his shoulder blades, burning away at his jumper as he screamed into Harry’s shirt.

Sighing a breath of defeat, Harry shook his head at himself before walking half a step to pick the letter up. Pinching it between two fingers, he righted himself before turning it over and over in his hands, carefully examining it for foul play or, Merlin forbid, more glitter. On the back was his full name written in a crisp, flowing font and... nothing else. No return address, no name of the sender. There was nothing but his own name, sitting there plainly on the back. Harry felt the beginning of unease settle deep into his mind as he turned the letter over to the front.
Closing his eyes, Harry leaned back in his seat, a headache starting to form behind his eyes as the noises rose to incredible levels. He certainly didn’t remember it being
The thought echoed through his skull like a mantra.
“Wasn’t the Triwizard Tournament retired because it was too dangerous?” Came a shout from behind her—the Hufflepuff table, she thought—which was quickly overpowered by loud booing farther back from there, at the Gryffindor table. The headmaster waved his hand without concern, shushing both the boos and concerned muttering throughout the room.
question exactly what was wrong with Harry, because it really could be anything. Ever since the altercation the tall boy had had with a bloody
Straightening, he cautiously moved away from the fortified door and towards the east wall, the circular entrance into Harry’s mind revealing itself quickly through the stacks of books. He quickened his pace, not wanting to leave the blatant breach in his mind alone for too long. Nearing the door, he let out a throaty hiss as it swung open, his intentions focused on waking Harry in the only way he knew would work now that the boy slept like the dead.
“Ah, well, I can come back later…?” She didn’t seem to be nearly as afraid as she had been right when waking up. In fact, she seemed to be just as she always was. Perhaps it really had been just a nightmare?
“It-it hadn’t, and he was so cold I was certain it wouldn’t have even worked, I… Hadrian, how do you feel?”
Harry snorted, before resting his head against Draco’s shoulder again and falling blissfully away into sleep. Blaise decided he should leave well enough alone at that, satisfied with the little moment of chaos he had wrought.

It was… peculiar, to say the least. It felt like the past millennium was encapsulated in the decor he found himself surrounded by. The fireplace, which he glared at with distaste, seemed to be from the mid 16th century, and was decorated and designed in the typical French style indicative of the period. The walls, however, seemed right out of the twentieth century, though it was rather hard to tell considering the, frankly,
Theo let out a tired breath, holding a candle up close to his face as he squinted at a bookcase. Despite whoever had ‘allegedly’ designed his home, knowing their name wouldn’t change the fact that there were only a handful of windows in the manor and only
“Then sleep, you dolt.”
“Finally.” He muttered, once the team had left and people started slowly gathering their things, the diplomats and honored guests of the top box chattering on about Merlin knew what as he finally took his fingers from his ears, finding that the roar of people hadn’t dulled much as the crowd continued to cheer for the Irish team, who were taking their fourth victory lap, the trophy held high in the captain’s hand.
“Uhm… yeah, it’s an honor. I… I play seeker as well, you know.” He stammered, not quite sure if he was nervous or just utterly flabbergasted by the situation. He had seen photos of Krum, sure, but they were always from far away and in the air, and were usually about as grainy as a newspaper photo could possibly get. Of course, those were the only photos of the man that really existed, so Harry recognizing him was quite surprising, let alone the fact that Harry was completely and utterly uninterested in Quidditch, and always had been.
“-enough for me, Hadrian. Anything to help you settle your mind.”
“It was wonderful meeting you Harry, I hope to see you again soon.” He nodded genially in agreement, shaking her outstretched hand before lowering himself enough to give Gabrielle a chaste hug, of which she seemed insistent on not letting go of.
Cold hands hold the world in a chilling embrace.
He stared down at the worn, dusty floorboards underneath his feet, eyes glazing over as the tapping of his foot slowly ceased. His mind had been in turmoil for the entire day, so sluggish that he hadn’t managed to keep much of his thoughts in order or even coherent. Now though, he felt like his mind was clearing, if only a little.
“Funny that, I think it was easier than the international portkey.”
Harry sighed silently, letting his head fall into his hands as Draco’s posture straightened, his shoulders falling back into a familiar poised, impossibly straight stature that had always made Harry roll his eyes. Now though, it just felt like an admission of defeat.
A hand settled between his shoulder blades, another coming up to rest on the back of his neck.
The Weasleys weren’t there.
What he worried about was Draco.
"Je déteste vous déranger Madame Perenelle, mais j'ai toujours eu un amour pour les potions et-"
The woman smiled, her purple eyes glimmering with mirth and pity and horrible, horrible knowledge. She knew what would happen, she knew and somehow he didn’t. For the first time, Theo had no idea what was in store for him in the future.
as his fist met the brick and shattered it. His vision was overtaken by red, his anger clouding his judgment as he whipped around and slapped the letter down onto his desk, shaking with unsuppressed rage. What exactly did Lucius Malfoy think would come of asking a
The past did not taint them, and never would, and that knowledge was so horribly, wonderfully comforting that Harry was forced to admit he wished to keep them close, if only for that reason. If only because they were kind, and brilliant, and so wonderfully understanding of what he was facing, of not just who, but
“Do you think Harry is having fun in France? I think it would be so lovely to be there right now. I’ve heard the Mediterranean beaches there are utterly delightful. Rather busy though, I’m sure.”
Luna had gotten used to the sharp, angry lightning bolt of blood that ripped down Harry’s face. She had seen it for years and had grown almost…
Theo bit the inside of his cheek, unsure how to react. Blaise seemed to be doing well, which was better than anything, at least. He didn’t quite know what to think about the need for dress robes or how there was ‘something happening’ come September, but it all seemed pretty concerning, just considering all the secrecy surrounding everything. He had noticed a note on his school letter stating that he would need formal robes for the school year, but had admittedly been too focused on other, non-school related things, to pay much attention to it.
Some parts of yourself were best left ununderstood, after all.
"Oui, en effet.”
Yanking his arm from the ice, Harry peaked his eyes over the makeshift wall to find both Flamels standing there, looking utterly flummoxed. Desperately searching for a cause of the alarm, Harry noticed a half-full bottle of some sort of red liquid in Perenelle’s hand, the color and vibrancy reminding him of the Philosopher's stone as it reflected the light.
So here are my personal (unfiltered) notes about the names and nicknames of all the horcruxes that have been introduced so far. Hope this helps with any confusion anyone may have:
“About time, lad.”
There was a rumbling as he urged
"On dirait que je le suis, oui." Draco immediately interrupted him, his eyebrow raised as if he had just heard something utterly ridiculous. It was a punctual reply in what sounded like, to his unknowing ears, perfect French. Harry blinked, his mind forcing him completely out of the stupor from the morning as a portion of Lucius Malfoy’s letter came back to him suddenly.
“Nothing at all~? Nothing to do with
“I s’pose you’re draggin’ me off ta the study, darlin'?” He slurred, his words dragging together into an amalgamation of his own son’s unfortunate diction and the general cadence of a piss-drunk aristocrat. Narcissa hummed in response, hitching up her long skirts in an effort to move more efficiently through the Manor’s halls. Lucius saw the action differently, and reached out to caress the large expanse of leg that had been opened up for his viewing pleasure. “Are we off ta Alaska, then?”
Nicolas nodded carefully. “Indeed. Yes I am afraid to say that despite calling it a ‘stone’ you can’t properly consider it one from a chemical standpoint. Do you know why it refracts this way Harry?”
He sneered, crumpling the booklet between his clenched fist. “Have we ever? Surely you haven’t forgotten about Marvolo or Voldemort. We are
Shrugging to himself, he slowly followed the man, blinking far more than usual as his eyes began to water as the peppery magic in the air became more pronounced. The walk felt agonizing as he stepped in tandem with the visibly suffering man next to him, the stinging in his eyes seeming like child's play next to the physical assault Tom seemed to be experiencing. Eventually though, he found himself standing in front of an iron door that appeared about on the brink of collapse, his eyes watering to the point where he wasn’t sure whether or not he could even properly gauge if the door was fortified or not.
She waved him off, an amused smile painted across her lips as she did. “Think nothing of it mister Potter. I’ve met far worse in far nicer places.”
He barely had a moment to be surprised as Harry reached them, his eyes immediately pinned onto the stone as Prenelle spoke. The tall boy reached towards it immediately, eyes filled with obvious fascination as he turned it over in his hands, dragging Draco and Perenelle’s arms up to his head as they both continued to hold onto the chain.
Maybe it was because his argument with Theo still felt fresh in his mind, and the separation from his soulmate was already starting to wear on him, but Harry felt like a bit of a twat for leaving things where he had. Maybe he should have tried to get Draco to come with him to France. Maybe he should have just swallowed his pride and apologize to Theo for scaring him. Hell, Harry didn’t even know what had come over him in that moment in the dorm. He didn’t know why the term ‘little prophet’ was at all important to Theo, it had just felt like the right thing to say at the time.
once he’s chosen? Daphne, this isn’t going to change anything with my standing in Slytherin, I’m just going to have fewer things to worry about. The older years aren’t going to grow a spine and fight me on things just because I’m stepping down from a, frankly, rather unremarkable post.”
Maybe he just had a tendency to run towards danger instead of away from it. It would certainly explain his tendency to fight fire with ice instead of simply letting the fire burn.
Some traits are hereditary, others are inherited.
“Draconis, tell heir Potter that I wish to speak with him before you both leave for Hogwarts. In fact, I would appreciate it if he wrote a letter to me so that we may open up communication.”
“Do you happen to know of anything going on at Hogwarts this year?” He pressed, wondering if questioning the spacey man might make the apparent ‘secret’ easier to discern. Xenophilius hummed, his fingers dancing across the dusty lid of an old glass jar.
Pain erupted on the left side of his face, the slap ringing out through the empty hall as he let go of his trunks and stumbled backwards, hand reaching tentatively up to the now sensitive skin in shock. He was barely ever touched in a
The man stared up at him, slack-jawed and looking a little pale, before he stepped back a few steps and regarded the man standing next to him, who seemed equally uncomfortable. Harry glanced between the two, feeling slightly confused before he realized that they were about Draco’s height, and likely hadn’t been expecting him to be… well, not. He bit back a laugh, glancing Draco’s way to see if he was watching. He was, though didn’t seem nearly as amused as Harry. More annoyed, really, which Harry had to agree with on some level. Minister Fudge had always been a particularly distasteful thing to manage, if his memory served him correctly.
he had started to demand answers (because, really, you can't just
But the quiet in the room was oppressive.
The statement rang out like a bullet, and Harry realized exactly what he said—what he
It didn’t matter either way, he didn’t plan to stay there for another hour.
“Hadrian should be here in just a moment, I believe he moseyed off to sort out something with the potion he helped me brew yesterday.”
“Erm.”
Harry smiled, a tired, relieved smile. “I was going mad, you know. Had a bit of a meltdown and everything. Though, that had to do with other things as well and… anyway.”
It had been a good idea to take Luna along for the school shopping with Blaise, Tracey, and Daphne in the end. He had been concerned initially, because the reaction people had to Luna was always unpredictable and this was their first true introduction to her, so he had no idea what might happen. In the end, though, he shouldn’t have worried. Tracey thought Luna was hysterical in all the right ways, and Daphne was never one to judge someone for their peculiarities. In fact, Tracey and Luna got on so well that Theo had actually felt himself drifting apart from the group slightly, separated somehow from the friends he had known for so long for no other reason than his silence. It hadn’t quite hit him until then how it was an utter miracle that Draco had been stubborn enough to keep him around during their first year. If he hadn’t, Theo was certain he would still be living with his nose between the folds of a book, forever doomed to stagnation without the pesky, wonderful presence of friends.
Oh wow, this really has been a long time coming, hasn't it? I hope the contents of this chapter has somewhat made up for the long delay. This is the last chapter of summer break, and I hope it is also the last chapter that will take so long for me to write. Life has been chaotic, but it's slowing down now, and my inspiration for this story is returning, so things should be returning to normal in regards to the upload schedule soon.
Harry ignored Tom’s grumbling about them ‘not knowing’ as he stepped onto the train, Draco trailing quietly behind him. He tried to ignore the heat at his back as he pulled the other boy towards the back-most car, distracting himself by making a mental checklist of everyone he expected to join them for the ride. Theo hopefully wouldn’t, which was a good thing for his peace of mind, but also made Luna’s appearance doubtful, which was less of a good thing. He didn’t see any reason why Blaise and Daphne wouldn’t show, which meant that Tracey would likely join them as well. Beyond that though, he didn’t really know. Harry frowned, wondering how he managed to amass such a shockingly small group of friends. Granted, they were all far more than he could handle all in one sitting, but the group seemed like fewer people than he had thought.
He watched the prototype of the philosopher’s stone shine unnaturally, realizing exactly what was going on as they walked deeper and deeper into the woods. It seemed that she had him promise not to worry the day before for a reason. She had already come up with a way to avoid any potential trouble after the game, even if she had stated that they should just wing it.
It was only about nine months after his inheritance that Draco had started to feel the inconsolable urge to climb every tree in reach, and in the later months of his third year he had oftentimes found himself scaling up trees during his pastime in order to get a better view of the surrounding area. Harry had always seemed particularly amused by the action, especially once Draco started to bring food up into the trees to eat, and had once even broken out into loud guffaws when Draco brought a shining green apple up into a large tree and aggressively munched on it for several minutes. Draco hadn’t managed to find out what about his natural habits was so bloody funny to the bastard, as Harry never seemed very willing to explain himself, but the embarrassment of being laughed at was always dampened if it was Harry who was laughing, so the need to climb persisted.
with a straight face?
Tom forced himself to nod, his eyes still trained on the booklet as he read the small text furiously. It was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time as he did, in which the man across from him finished off his biscuit before moving on to the lukewarm tea they had both forgotten about.
“Inexplicably… as in you aren’t sure why you trust him, but you do?”
“And why the girl? Why not go straight for me?”
And he did, for the most part. They rode the rest of the way in relative silence, punctuated only by Tracey popping her head into the compartment around three hours into the trip. She had given them all a severely weird look—which was, in all fairness, mostly pointed to Harry—before settling down besides Daphne and immediately engaging in a hushed conversation. Blaise didn’t bother to try and listen in, too focused on trying to occupy his mind and figure out just
“Yes mother.”
“I could never see you as anything but kind, Hadrian. Do not insult yourself by thinking I would be disgusted with you for simply wanting to live. Better men than me have done worse than you.”
“Do you reckon we should set up our tent first?” Harry questioned Perenelle, his hand still rubbing soothing circles into Draco’s back. The woman hummed, looking as though she was considering the thought for a moment before shrugging. Draco was about to interrupt that they most definitely
Harry’s eye twitched, rather violently, before he made a point to close his eyes again. Blaise pursed his lips, sparing Daphne a long-suffering glance that she happily returned. He didn’t try to poke the beast again though, knowing that Theo was apparently no longer viable as a discussion topic.
“That must have been fun. Did you chip a nail?”
“Merlin, please don’t,” Draco mumbled, yanking him further along towards the fireplace. Harry made a noise of protest as Perenelle pulled out a handkerchief and began dabbing at her eyes. The blond stopped for a moment, eyes closed and heavy, before he turned to the elder couple with a fatigued smile. “Thank you for your hospitality. I will send word of my potioneering explorations if you’re interested, Perenelle.”
He didn’t need Malfoy Manor, Draco realized, not when he had this. Not when he had this wonderful feeling, this completeness. He didn’t need a bloody thing from his father, or his mother, or whoever else thought they knew what was best for him. This was all there needed to be, this was enough for him to feel sure of himself. This was the one thing he wouldn’t second guess.
“Does it matter?” He shot back, carding his fingers together as the man across from him huffed.
fair, it was so far from fair that he couldn’t even comprehend it.
Shocking him, the man nodded along, shaking Harry’s hand firmly before pinning his eyes on Draco. “A pleasure to meet you, Harry and Draco. As you know, my name is Viktor Krum, yes.”
“I just don’t know what to do. I feel so powerless.” He whispered through choked sobs, blinking away the tears as he finally realized that his laughter had turned into crying. Why did he seem to be losing all sense of his emotions lately? He sniffled, trying to force his body to stop crying without cause as Perenelle carded gentle fingers through his hair. “I feel like I’m going mad. Do I seem like I’m going mad?”
Tom sucked in a sharp breath, turning to glare at the impudent little beast as it grinned devilishly at him with sharp, bloodied teeth.
“Close your mouth Zabini, you look ridiculous.”
All Harry could do was nod silently in agreement, ice crystals racing up his arms and tangling around his fingers to protect them as the fire roared brighter and brighter, Draco’s wings were quickly revealed out from under the layers of burning cotton, shuffling and twitching with the unmistakable urge to take off into the air. It
Harry sighed slowly, fiddling with the long chain of his pocket watch as it continued to tick obnoxiously. It was just as loud as the girl it used to be. He smiled idly, caught daringly between amusement and hysterics as the ticking went on and on and
Luna hummed, peeking out from behind the waves of pale curls framing her face as she watched familiar shapes and colors trail into the great hall. She observed the gentle, snake-like motions of deep green light slithering sluggishly around happy, cloud-like puffs of blue. It seemed that Blaise Zabini was still doing rather well, with the crueler half of himself seemingly placated from whatever anger it had felt early on in the year before. Luna hummed, watching as the boy’s bubbly blue soul motioned sweetly to a deeper, more glacial purple besides him. Daphne Greengrass, she thought sparingly. Luna hadn’t spoken much to the older girl before, but had always found the royal hues of her soul quite attractive. She could almost compare the texture to satin, though she couldn’t exactly touch the girl’s soul and confirm such a thing.
Her soft smile turned to a cheeky grin, and she reached up to pat his cheek.
Clearing his throat, Harry ignored the sudden spike of hunger and focused his attentions back onto the topic at hand. “So how did you get this blood here? You can’t just be going out and assaulting muggles to drain their blood after all. The authorities are bound to catch wind eventually.”
The fourth floor was equally empty, the vaulted ceiling and elaborate carvings inlade in the oak supports making the space feel far larger than usual, what without all the students and professors milling about during the day. Nicolas passed it all by with a feeling of misplacement, as if he did not belong in that empty space. Perhaps his feelings of unease were being elevated by the uninhabited academy.
for clothes ever since the summer after his first year. It was a miracle that his father had kept the mad-elf on for so long, though he doubted that it would last much longer yet.
“I suppose I did, yes.”
“Please, tell us everything.”
“I’m not leaving the country until someone comes to my door to kill me, so Beubaxatons won't ever be an option-”
Came the swift reply, the man sounding particularly uninterested in the prospect of dealing with his own mistakes. Harry shifted lower against the wall, glaring at the blank expanse of old brick that continued to exist in his general vicinity. Tom was hardly one to talk about having things on one’s plate. And, unlike Harry, the man had all the time in the day to sort out the issue with his disobedient horcruxes, while Harry had things like eating, sleeping, and socializing to contend with.
(And a very special thank you to everyone who takes the time to write out a comment each chapter, because I really love you guys. But really, you're all fantastic.)
“Right.” Draco muttered, fingers now thoroughly tangled in Harry’s hair as he stared, blankly, at the parchment that he had written out the entire messy, slipshod plan on. “That’s fair, I suppose.”
Harry didn’t quite understand, but didn’t quite
Theo let out a pained groan, and sat down like a lump of grouchy coal next to her. Luna reached up to pull her massive sunglasses down to look at him curiously. The swim trunks that her father had gifted him seemed a tad big, but the purple color matched his honey soul rather horribly, which she thought was very fun.
Alright, I’ll explain. You can’t just… just
“You’re avoiding the topic Luna.” She pursed her lips, reaching out to pat him comfortingly on the leg.
“Yes yes… you’re the Favorite. I remember now.” The damp cloth was forcibly pressed onto his cheek, and the man muttered to himself inanely as he grabbed for Theo’s hand and forced it to press the warm cloth to his face.
“Hadrian? We’ll be right back!” Perenelle shouted over her shoulder, not stopping in the slightest as she shoved a star-struck Fleur back down the hall.
Theo realized then, that if there was nothing that he could do to change the future, then why should he even try? Even if he saw it being ripped asunder by the people that he loved, nothing he did would ever change the outcome in any real capacity.
