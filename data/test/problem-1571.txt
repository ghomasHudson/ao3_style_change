He slowly raised his head from Greg's shoulder, seeing both Theo and Blaise standing at the doorway leading to the living room.
"Nicely", he found himself answering curtly, avoiding eye contact, before taking another sip of his coffee.
"It's an action movie called GoldenEye. About a guy called James Bond who's an agent. These are very popular films among muggles", Harry explained.
Harry smirked at the comment. "Yeah... From what I've heard he was reckless, fiery, always breaking the rules as much as he could..."
Harry glanced at her hand and instantly felt butterflies in his stomach. Ginny grabbed his face and kissed him again, this time more eagerly. Harry kissed back with enthusiasm, Ginny was a really good kisser, after all.
They didn't even care that they were making a lot of noise. Harry didn't even know if Malfoy had cast the Silencing charm to the room or not but he didn't give a damn, to be honest. All his drunken brain knew was that he had never experienced such amount of pleasure in his whole life. No,
nervous. He didn't get it. He was Harry Potter, the one who had killed Voldemort, but still he was feeling nervous about something like this?
Goyle seemed to hesitate for a while. "Nah", he finally said. "I'm staying." Harry had to admit to himself that he was a bit disappointed.
"There's nothing wrong with my memory, Ron!" Harry said angrily. "I haven't forgotten what he's done."
There was another silence until Harry managed to speak again. "This can not happen again, you know...", he said quietly. "The thing is, I'm with Ginny and I don't want to hurt her, so this must stop right away."
Theo had smashed the wall with his fist, and he was now shaking with anger, his normally pale face slowly turning red.
Harry trembled, forcing himself to return to the real world. He felt shocked. He had once again dreamt of Malfoy instead of Ginny, and it’d not been just any kind of dream. This time he and Malfoy'd had sex. Really
He could tell that Harry was fuming with anger and jealousy at the moment and it gave him great pleasure.
Would he ever get another chance anymore, he didn't know. What if he had scared Malfoy? Okay, so maybe the Slytherin had seemed to want the kiss, but then again, Malfoy had also told Harry that he was not gay so it was all very, very confusing.
of you. Now", he breathed against Malfoys lips, biting them. He couldn't take it anymore. He needed to feel Malfoy completely, he needed to be inside this stunning man right now. He needed to know what it would be like for real, mere dreams were not enough. Besides, Malfoy had already said that he wanted Harry as well and he was more than ready to fulfill the other man's wish.
When Greg opened the door and let Draco in his flat next afternoon, Draco could tell that the man immediately saw that something was terribly wrong.
", Harry ended the sentence. He couldn't look at Malfoy in the eyes anymore. Right now he just wished to be able to disappear from the earth. Why the heck was he making a laughing stock of himself like this, in front of Malfoy, the man who had always very much enjoyed using any of his weaknesses against him?
After a while he finally turned to face the blond. Malfoy was still looking at him, face unreadable. Harry's green eyes immediately locked with Malfoy's grey ones. They were so beautiful.
"I'm so sorry, Draco... If I had known...", Harry said sadly. He took a step closer to Draco, moving his hands up to cup his cheeks and caress his pale, teary face with his fingers. "I've been a terrible boyfriend. I was so stressed, so caught up with work that I neglected you..."
Harry nodded, staring at the ruins gravely. "Yeah...", he said. He could feel the other man's eyes on him again as they just stood there in deep silence.
Draco was glaring at his fiance, snorting. "I have no idea what that has to do with anything, but if you must know, it was probably weeks ago. I haven't had any interest in it for some particular reason."
"Ah, Harry", the Slytherin breathed, making Harry's cock twitch. Hearing Draco's voice and seeing the sight in front of him was really making him horny as hell. He wanted the Slytherin
full of Malfoy. At nights he found himself constantly having dreams about him and he couldn't stop himself from masturbating to them afterwards. It was becoming a very bad habit for him. However, it wasn't just about lust. No, there was so much more to it. He really cared about the Slytherin, way more than he should have. He had become incredibly fond of the guy.
It was a fact that Ginny didn't like Harry spending so much time with Malfoy. Even though she had learned to stand the Slytherin just a little bit better (just because Ron and Hermione had forgiven him too and talked her into it), she still didn't like him and didn't want to spend any time in the same group if Malfoy was around at the time. She still kept trying to demean Malfoy and was often trying to make Harry cancel his plans with him by demanding Harry to see her instead, but Harry didn't agree to it. He did spend time with her too but he wasn't ready to give up any time spent with Malfoy either to do so.
"It totally was", Draco said, looking at him with a dazed expression on his face. He was gently stroking Harry's black, messy hair and rolling it around his finger, his eyes filled with fondness. Harry finally realized how much Draco really cared about him, just like Harry cared about Draco. It was clear that it had not been mere sex to Draco. Harry had been too blind to see what had been right in front of his eyes this whole time.
He hesitated for a while before slowly shifting closer to that door, listening. He heard nothing. He shifted even closer and then closer again, until he was finally standing right in front of the door.
"Night", he said quietly, walking to the door of the bedroom he shared with Theodore, not turning to look at him again.
Ginny was the opposite. She was beautiful and very social and because of that she had already dated several guys before him. Harry had only ever kissed Cho and Ginny, that was all the experience he had. He’d been too busy with defeating Voldemort and various other stuff. Even Ron had more experience with girls than he did, now that he was dating Hermione. Harry did want to have sex, of course, but tonight wasn't the right time for that.
It didn't take more than two seconds before he already found himself being slammed hard against the wall, facing Harry whose green eyes had turned almost fully black with rage.
"Night", Harry answered and disappeared to his own room. He went straight to bed and fell asleep almost immediately.
Harry kept on moving the quill against the parchment but Malfoy had already dragged the chair backwards and sat across from him. Harry lifted his gaze slowly, eyes locking with Malfoy's grey ones. They just stared at each other for a while. Harry felt a weird tingling feeling in his stomach and felt very annoyed about it. Why did Malfoy have this kind of effect on him all of a sudden?
Taking a deep breath he entered the room and closed the door behind him as quietly as he could. Malfoy was in a half lying, half sitting position on his bed, glancing over his book at Harry with a questioning look on his pale face.
Harry once again moved his hand up to caress Draco's face gently with his fingers, and Draco lifted his gaze again, his stormy grey eyes meeting Harry's green ones. This time he didn't push Harry away.
Malfoy clearly couldn't believe his ears. "What?! No! I did NOT have sex with Theo!" he said angrily.
For years he had longed for Harry, ever since their third year at Hogwarts. He had dreamt about him for so long, fallen deeply in love with him, suffered when seeing Harry kissing with someone else... Then,
"Thanks Blaise, but there's no need to dwell on it any longer", Draco said with a melancholic sigh, lifting his head up again. "Last night already verified what I've been suspecting for a long time... And now I don't know what I'm supposed to do..."
"What's with all these terrible colours? Gives me a headache", he said scornfully, reminding Harry that even if they did tolerate each other a little better, the man was still the very same git as always.
"It's not difficult at all. Not much different from preparing ingredients for potions, you know", Harry had said. Flashing a supportive smile at Draco, he had offered a knife to the Slytherin, asking: "Do you want to try as well?"
Before Harry even managed to thank her, she had already turned around and left without bothering to say anything to Draco. Harry could see her walking to her parents, crying. Arthur placed his hand on his daughter's shoulder.
"Draco", he said, lifting his hand to stroke the other man's platinum hair with his fingers. "It's over between me and Ginny. We're done, finished,
Harry shook his head. "Of course there isn't!" he said. "What made you think that I would cheat on you, after all we've been through? Don't you trust me at all?"
"Hey, so I was thinking. It's been almost a month, so... What about Hog's Head tonight?" Ron asked after a short silence.
Harry hesitated for a while before he walked to the bed, sitting down on the edge, sideways to Malfoy.
"I'd love it, but I don't think it's a good idea", Harry finally said. "The bed is kind of small - and I share the room with your brother."
"Sorry", Harry said quietly. He found himself admiring Malfoy's tall, slender figure which was covered by all black clothes, emphasizing it even more. Oh, how much Harry wished to be able to press that lithe body against his own, to hold him close, look him deep in the eyes… but it was not possible. Malfoy was not gay, he didn't like Harry that way and Harry was with Ginny. Nothing like that would ever happen between him and Malfoy. But it was still possible to at least spend some time with him as friends, right? He'd only need to ask…
, Harry!" he snapped, now storming up the stairs and starting to head towards their bedroom by foot instead of apparating this time.
"Well, I did", he blurted out, finally gaining Malfoy's attention. "I have wanted to talk to you. It's just that Ginny's always with me and she..."
Harry was staring at him with his teary eyes, looking like he had no clue what Draco was talking about.
"I haven't changed my mind", he said softly, pressing a quick kiss to the other man's beautiful lips. "I love you and I can't wait to marry you."
And then you and your other friends would have handed me straight to the Dark Lord the first moment you got the chance."
, that's what it is." And then Malfoy had already pulled him closer and kissed him. Harry kissed him back, feeling very abashed right now. Blimey, Malfoy found his inexperience
Harry unwrapped the other one of the remaining packages, revealing what was a small photo album inside. Wrinkling his brows a little he opened it and the tiny smile on his face instantly faded away.
Harry cleared his throat. "Umm, it's just that... Many students here are treating him very, very badly."
"I should go find Ron and Hermione", Harry stated and glanced at the Slytherin, seeing a sudden, sullen look on his face. "What?" Harry asked.
He remembered the Quidditch match that had been played between Gryffindor and Slytherin in late April. He had hated Draco so much for cheating so outrageously, suddenly rushing from behind and grabbing at his Firebolt, causing the Snitch to escape. Harry had spent the rest of the match annoying the boy as much as he could.
"I still can't believe that I'm not dreaming", Draco said after a while, quietly. "I dreamt about this for years but I never thought I'd get to hold you like this for real... but now you are suddenly lying here with me. You're really here."
"I know… and I kind of understand that. You forgot all your plans with her without a word because you were with him", Hermione said, giving him a meaningful look. "You know how that makes us girls feel."
Harry was quiet for a while, thinking of what to say. This weekend clearly hadn't been the best for Malfoy. First he had been crying to his ex-nemesis Harry, and now this...
Only after a minute or so, Harry was already getting very close. Draco's lips and tongue were moving on his member so pleasurably that his whole body was trembling uncontrollably and his hands were squeezing the sheets so hard his knuckles were white. How could Draco be so damn good at this?!
Greg and Blaise had to intervene and grab Theo by the arms to be able to stop him from going through the door.
Once again he glanced to his right side, seeing Malfoy still walking beside him with a slightly amused smile on his lips.
Draco opened his eyes slightly, looking down at him. His already blushed cheeks reddened a bit more. "Huh?"
Before Harry managed to say or do anything, Ginny had turned his face with the hand around him and pressed their lips together, kissing him. It took a while for Harry to even realize what was happening before he finally managed to pull away from her.
"Well, how does it taste like?" he finally asked as Draco had already devoured over half of the food on his plate.
"You didn't take any crap from anyone", Greg continued, not letting Draco interrupt them. "You're still the same guy, Draco! Don't let Potter treat you like shit! Stop crying for him and give him a taste of his own medicine."
Harry glanced at his ex-girlfriend again. Her long, fire-red hair was curled and she was wearing a candy pink dress. Ginny wasn't smiling, but she didn't look pissed either which soothed Harry a little. He did not want anything or anyone to ruin his and Draco's big day. Least of all Ginny who had already tried to ruin their relationship earlier by telling Draco that Harry was going to cheat on him.
Harry's angry question was cut off by Ginny kissing him again, roughly. His girlfriend was clearly trying to prove some point here but once again Harry realized that kissing with Ginny didn't make him feel anything. It was nothing compared to the kisses with Draco. Kissing with Draco was euphoric, it was intense, it was everything... By kissing Harry, Ginny only made it even clearer to him that he didn't want anyone else but Draco.
Harry trembled, turning towards the bed again at the whisper. Malfoy had turned on his back and was now staring at him, rubbing his eye.
The school week was really rough but finally Saturday arrived. Harry spent most of the day at Hogsmeade with Ginny. They had a really good time together shopping, eating, drinking and of course snuggling, and Harry was feeling totally relaxed.
"He won't take it well", Draco said, sighing. "He hates Harry, and to make the matters worse, he's expecting me to marry a pure blood witch and make sure that there will be more Malfoys and... well, Harry's a guy..."
The thought was killing him, his heart was aching and he felt like vomiting, and that was when he decided that he would have to talk to someone about their current situation or he would lose his mind. He would go and talk to Greg tomorrow. Greg was his most trusted friend, after all.
Malfoy seemed to tense a little. He stretched himself to place the book on his night stand and then returned to his slouching position, folding his hands on his lap. "Take a seat and fire away then." He gestured towards the bed.
He took a deep breath, trying to get a hold of his nerves, moistened his fingers well with the lube and slowly pressed one of them against Draco's entrance, pushing it in.
Harry's lips were curved up in a dreamy smile. "I know", he said back tiredly. "Everything will be a lot better."
Hermione's cheeks reddened a bit. "They are so close and... Theo's quite a good looking guy... No, let's admit it. He's a
He didn't know how long he’d been lying there but when he finally opened his eyes slightly, he noticed that the room was a lot darker, Malfoy was still sitting in the corner of the room and… Malfoy wasn't reading at the moment. The book was resting against his thighs and he was staring at Harry.
Harry felt very angry at himself for getting caught. "I... uh...", he started, trying to think of any suitable reason for him to be just standing there, right in front of Malfoy and Theodore's door.
Harry let out a sigh. "Don't", he said, forcing a sad smile to his lips. "I've already said it a thousand times and I really mean it. I don't blame you."
Even through the music, Harry could hear his best friend chuckling again, probably at Lucius. Harry, however, didn't care at the moment. He couldn't keep his eyes off Draco, his soon-to-be-husband.
But, as more days went by, the change in their relationship started to haunt Draco. Something had clearly started to change between them, slowly but surely. There was no denying it anymore, no matter how much Draco tried to convince himself that everything was still fine.
Harry Potter was madly in love with Draco Malfoy, and later today he was going to ask the other man to be his boyfriend.
"Yeah, I know. I just...", Harry mumbled, hesitating. Finally he pushed his plate forward and stood up. "I don't feel like eating anymore."
To both of their surprise, Narcissa didn't seem shocked. Instead, her eyes were soon filled with tears as she wrapped her arms around her son, hugging him tightly.
"I... don't know how much Theodore already told you", Harry started after a while. "So I'll start from the beginning."
felt very arousing at the same time. Draco, of course, was trying his best to make it even more awkward for Harry by talking dirty as always.
There they were sitting at Hog's Head: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy and Goyle, drinking, talking and having fun.
Harry, wearing an affective smile on his lips, quickly glanced towards the guests and he could see Hermione wiping her already teary eyes with a handkerchief.
"You do know that after we leave this room tomorrow morning, nothing is the way it used to be", Draco mumbled to Harry's ear, naked body pressed against his back.
It was Theodore's turn to sigh. "I don't hate you, Potter. I hate the fact that he wants you instead of me", he said. "But I want him to be happy, and if he's only happy with you... what can I do."
"You mean the Black family's old house?" Malfoy asked. Harry noticed that he was looking slightly disappointed.
"Well… I'm not going to lie. You can be quite big-headed and very, very annoying at times, but I don't hate you… Because I know now that deep down you're not a bad person", Harry answered. Malfoy's teary eyes were now boring into his own and Harry felt himself drowning in them, once again. His eyes were like the color of gathering storm clouds in the sky with a silvery glint, full of restrained emotion…
anymore. No, he wished to have more than a friendship with Malfoy, only it was not possible. It never would be.
That's when it hit him. Harry finally realized that Malfoy was really telling him the truth. Malfoy and Theodore had kissed. He hesitated a while before asking: "Is it... mutual?"
"Yeah. He used to be my best friend, after all", the Slytherin said quietly. "But not after that night. He said a lot of bad things about me, my family – and you. I will never forgive him."
He moved his hand up to caress the smooth pale skin of the Slytherin's cheek, and the other man pressed his face smiling against his hand. Harry instantly felt his stomach fluttering. Draco Malfoy naked in his arms... He would definitely not mind at all to wake up to a sight like this for the rest of his life.
"They get paid for kissing and..." Draco paused, his cheeks turning slightly red as the couple started to lessen each other's clothes as well. "...making out in front of everyone?"
Harry nodded. "I did. Mostly with Malfoy, though. Goyle left early. Believe it or not, I actually had kind of fun in the end. Malfoy even bought me a drink." After glancing at Ron and seeing the slightly peevish look on his face he quickly added: "I'd rather have been drinking with you two, of course." He remembered their conversation from yesterday's dinner and decided that maybe it would be best to fix the misunderstanding right now. "And about that thing between Malfoy and Theo-"
Harry sighed. How was he supposed to sort things out with Ginny when Ginny didn't even seem to want to talk? Okay, she did have Quidditch practise today but it wouldn't take the whole evening... All Ginny did was glare at him or completely ignore him and Harry was getting tired of it. Besides, the more he kept thinking about how the things really were between the two of them, the more he was starting to doubt their whole relationship again… Was this relationship working anymore – and had it ever really worked?
"You heard what Draco said, Blaise", Theo sighed immediately. "It is as clear as a day that Potter -"
"Harry… I know I keep repeating myself a lot, but you'll work things out with her eventually and everything will be just fine", Hermione said supportively. "I'm positive about it."
Harry shook his head. "I do care about her, that's for sure", he said. "I really do. But all this fighting and other stuff… I… I don't know. I don't know
One evening after paying a visit to Hagrid, Harry was walking back towards the castle to have some dinner... and that was when he saw him. The blond Slytherin was walking along the lakefront with slow pace, hands deep in his pockets, head bowed down. Why wasn't Malfoy at dinner?
"Before we get to the vows, Harry and Draco have wished to share the letters they have written for each other for their big day", Rivers continued. "Harry, whenever you are ready, you may begin."
Why not." He flashed a tiny smile at Harry. "If we're still together then, that is. You never know what will happen when you think about our history..."
The Slytherin was still caressing Harry's hair, suddenly looking a little uneasy. "Well... like you already know, I happen to read a lot, and there are lots of books about sex, so..."
One Friday afternoon at the start of December, Harry once again found himself studying with a certain Slytherin after classes. This time they were at Malfoy's room, Malfoy lying on his own bed on his stomach and Harry sitting at his desk, back towards the Slytherin, finishing their Potions essays together.
", Harry breathed in shock, immediately realizing the situation he was in. He instantly pushed Ginny away from him. "This isn't what it looks like.
Few minutes later, he and Draco walked down the hall straight to the dance area to have their dance before the congrats and dinner.
Harry was trying to get up. He tried to gather himself up but his head was spinning and hurting badly because of the smash. "Draco... please...", he slurred desperately, hand on the back of his head.
"There's just one thing I've been wondering...", Harry said after a while, hesitating. "Draco... How do you know so much about sex? You told me you haven't had any experience before..."
That night Harry slept very restlessly, turning from side to side. In his dream he was once again sitting on the sofa in their common room, stroking his girlfriends silky hair with his fingers.
here", Harry whispered to Ron, hoping to hear some reason for Ginny's decision to be there. He didn't know how to feel about her presence at his and Draco's wedding.
He felt tears burning in his eyes and finally flowing down his cheeks, something that had last happened so, so long ago.
Ron and Hermione kept telling him about everything they had been doing at the Burrow, where they had visited and what they had gotten as presents. Harry listened to them, feeling very restless, fiddling with his sleeve all the time. When finally his friends attention turned to him, his stomach was turning into knots.
Harry was not surprised. In fact it would had been a miracle if Ginny hadn't told anyone at all. He was pretty sure that Hermione wasn't the only one who knew about their argument.
Ginny was also busy with her studies and quidditch, so it was a shame that they didn't share a common room anymore. They had only been able to see each other during meals the whole day.
”That’s nice to hear”, Harry answered with a quick laugh. His eyes followed as Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Draco Malfoy, Gregory Goyle and Pansy Parkinson walked past them and left the library.
He was kissing the Slytherin's throat now, inhaling the beautiful scent of his skin and moving his hand on the blond's cock at the same time. Draco kept whining desperately under him.
"When I saw you with her again... I thought you had changed your mind", Draco finally spoke, his lips trembling. His voice was all raspy because of having been crying so much, and he was about to start crying again.
"Nnnngh", Harry answered once again, still lying on his stomach, his face buried in a pillow. His ass was burning like hell, Draco's cock stretching him wide open. He didn't understand how Draco had been able to take it so well, like a professional, the first time they'd had sex almost two weeks ago, when he himself was almost crying, his eyes full of barely restrained tears.
Harry kept staring at the flames of the fireplace, remembering the fiery look in Malfoy's eyes. Damn Hermione and damn Ginny… He had really wanted to kiss the man, he had wanted it
"You and Theodore are friends again, then?" he heard himself ask and wanted to hit himself right after.
How the hell could he have done this to Ginny? He was supposed to take care of his girlfriend, make sure that everything was perfect for her, shelter her...
"Harry is going to... leave me", he managed to gasp before starting to sob broken-heartedly again. "He has... someone else. Someone from work I think... He's... cheating on me... It's been going on for
"Yeah, right", Harry said. Right, Ginny. After the war they had continued on with their relationship, because that was the right thing to do, right? Everyone had expected them to get together again and Harry hoped to get married and have kids someday. Ginny was a good girlfriend. Of course she had her own faults, but so did everyone.
"Well, I've said it before... You really are a hothead, nothing new about that", Malfoy said teasingly. "I've experienced it myself many times already. Remember how you attacked me at the Quidditch Pitch?"
Harry turned his head towards the voice and saw Malfoy who was trying to sit up, having obviously been lying there on Harry's favourite couch before Harry had stormed in. He was already wearing his black night pyjamas. There didn't seem to be anyone else lingering in the common room anymore.
"I love you too, Draco", he said back, thumb caressing the other man's jawline, once again drowning in the other man's eyes. "What would you say if I asked you... once we graduate, will you move in with me?"
Now Harry was really starting to flare up. Ginny was being so narrow-mind and cruel at the moment that it was making him feel sick.
Harry kept fiddling with his sleeve, his thoughts returning to Draco once again. The Christmas break spent with Draco had been wonderful. He had learned to know the other man so much better and he had gotten used to doing almost everything with him. They had eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner together every day, slept in the same bed, showered together, and most of all: had lots of sex together all around the house, the last time had been that same morning, Harry having taken Draco against the kitchen counter.
Soon it was time for Harry to walk down and meet Draco and his father there. He and Lucius glanced at each other very quickly before Lucius passed Draco to him and went to sit to the remaining empty seat next to his wife. Harry and Draco exchanged loving smiles with one another before Harry took Draco's arm with his own, and they kept walking together.
He waited for his breath to become steady again, just lying there for a long time. Finally, since he nowadays was already quite good at wandless magic, he started whispering the cleaning charm. Soon his body was fully clean of his cum.
"You're not making it any easier for him if you treat him like shit", Harry said. "You're only making it worse."
"It is", Harry said confidently, turning towards the crowd again. He let his gaze travel around the hall, seeing lots of familiar and not so familiar faces waiting on their seats.
Draco glared at him. "Harry, you seriously want to discuss that already?" he asked, shaking his head in irritation.
"Oh, sod off", Harry replied, but he wasn't irritated though, not really. It didn't really matter who had won today. The only thing that mattered was that he had kind of enjoyed spending time with Malfoy once again. It felt weird.
"You know very well who I'm talking about", Hermione said with another sigh. "It's happening again. Admit it. Just like in our 6th year."
They were lying like that for a long time, both panting heavily, neither of them able to speak. Harry's face was pressed against the other man's neck, his eyes closed.
After they had eaten he decided to go visit the graveyard where his parents were buried. After all, it was the evening before Christmas.
First they simply tried to see which one of them mounted their broom faster. Harry won Malfoy everytime.
"Feeling regretful?" he heard Malfoy ask again after a while of waiting. The Slytherin was clearly trying to sound indifferent.
Harry wasn't sure where he should start from, so he decided to just ask the question that crossed his mind first.
Oh Merlin. He had just had real sex for the first time. Not with his girlfriend but with his old rival, Draco Lucius Malfoy, and he had
And that's how they sat there for a very long time, just embracing each other, until Harry noticed that the very drunken Slytherin was starting to fall asleep against his shoulder. He carefully lied down, pulling Malfoy along with him on the couch. Malfoy seemed to be sleeping already. His face was now resting against Harry's chest and his arm was tightly wrapped around him. Harry was looking at the Slytherin's beautiful sleeping face and he could feel his heart melting. So beautiful…
"And I'll always carry this one", Harry said quickly, stroking some of his messy hair off his forehead, revealing his own scar.
Harry gulped. Oh, right. He had forgotten that his friends weren't used to him being on first name terms with Draco.
Ginny didn't seem to listen to him. "Is that why you couldn't sleep with me?!" she hissed. "Because of him?!"
He was running his hands all over the Slytherin's beautiful, warm body, loving the feeling of it against him. So graceful, so perfect... Malfoy moaned in his mouth and his fingers were running through Harry's messy hair, and Harry could feel the desperation, the yearning,
seen Draco?" Theodore asked loudly. Everyone was shaking their heads. "No one? I've been looking everywhere for him." He looked worried.
"Really?" Draco asked, unsure, and looked at his mum in confusion as they pulled apart from each other. "You're not angry that it's...
"You think I'd make up stuff like that?" Malfoy asked in a slightly irritated tone. "Yeah, seriously."
, he heard a voice say and turned his head to look at her, but instead of brown eyes he saw grey eyes locking with his own, and platinum blonde, not red, hair against his fingers instead.
"Oh, I see", Seamus said, giving him a knowing look before disappearing towards the bedrooms. "Good night!"
Saturday evening passed by quickly and in a flash it was already Sunday morning. They were having breakfast at the Great Hall and Harry's thoughts were already on what was coming next. Of all people, he would go flying with Malfoy. They had planned to be heading straight to Quidditch pitch after they'd finished their breakfast.
Ginny had been clinging onto Harry at meals as well and after dinner she followed Harry, Ron and Hermione to their common room. Harry, feeling intolerably guilty, tried his best to pretend everything was just like before, but it turned out to be very difficult, just like he had thought it would be.
Malfoy was looking out at the lake, avoiding eye contact, not answering his question. It made Harry wonder what was going on. Malfoy clearly wasn't himself at the moment.
could compare to this. There was no way to describe the feeling well enough. It was so arousing, so intimate, so pleasurable, almost painful... It was
Harry noticed that Theodore looked a bit disappointed before heading towards the bedrooms. "Good night."
After Harry returned home he started to prepare them dinner in the kitchen and Draco surprised Harry by participating as well. Well, actually the Slytherin just stood close to Harry and watched attentively what he was doing at the time.
Malfoy was moaning under him, moving his hands to Harry's bottom now. Harry's cock was already hard and he could feel that Malfoy was as hard as him. Soon their erections were pressed together, only separated by their pyjamas, and Harry was slowly rubbing himself against Malfoy.
Harry finally turned his attention to the last, small present he still hadn't opened yet. He took it, turning it around in his hands. There was no card in it so he didn't know who it was from.
Theodore was eyeing Harry closely for a while, a pungent look in his dark eyes, trying to decide if he could trust him or not.
way. No, he had always liked girls, dated girls and still… he had fallen for a guy. A guy who had made his life a living hell for years… When had this happened?
"What?" he quickly asked, turning to look at his best friend. Now, instead of just Malfoy, everyone else was watching him too.
"This is so fucking crazy", Harry said again after they’d finally gotten enough of kissing, rubbing his eyes with his hand. "This is pure madness."
Harry's cheeks heated up a bit. "Ron heard you when he came back from the bathroom at night", he said. "He said he heard you moaning and some bed creaking and he was certain that you two were-"
"And you listened to her", Harry cut his sentence off, sighing in frustration. "I can't believe you would believe a word she is saying!"
"Look, Potter... Why would I want to talk to you? And even if I'd want to, you wouldn't understand", Malfoy answered.
"Yeah", he said with a nod before letting go of his hand, hesitating. "I... guess I should... thank you", he finally added. "For listening." He turned his gaze towards Harry's door, avoiding eyecontact. "And for not laughing at me. I can't believe I told you all that stuff about me..."
Harry soon fell asleep, but Draco kept lying awake for hours that night, just staring at the ceiling and thinking what had happened between them during the last month, and the more he thought about everything, the more wretched and apprehensive he felt.
"Ginny wasn't too happy to read about your engagement in the Prophet, either", Hermione said, an uneasy look on her face.
Harry smiled. He moved his both hands to the other man's buttocks as he continued his angled thrusts. Draco was rubbing himself at the same time, moaning. Harry was in heaven. It felt so wonderful to be inside Draco, he wished it would never have to end. He crushed his lips against the Slytherin's throat, leaving another angry red mark there.
Malfoy was looking at him skeptically. "So... you're telling me...", he started slowly. "...that Harry Potter,
Harry's whole body was shaking. He quickly grabbed his school case from the floor, nervously starting to toss all his own stuff inside from the desk he had worked at. He was avoiding looking at the blond Slytherin.
I wonder if he even notices that I'm gone when he finally gets home... if he's going there at all today."
Hermione, however, didn't even bother listening to him. "You're becoming obsessed with him again, Harry", she stated.
"Me too", Ginny said, letting out a small sob. "I really care about you Harry... A lot more than I probably should... I spent years waiting but... I don't
Everytime the portrait door turned around his eyes fixed on it, but he was always let down, time after time. He saw Pansy and Blaise, he saw Seamus and Dean, he saw Goyle… but no Malfoy and Theodore.
Harry stopped moving. "What is it, Draco? Does it feel good?" he asked, panting against the Slytherin's neck.
, whatever. Harry had really, really wanted that before but now when he thought about it, he knew he didn't anymore. It didn't feel like the right thing to do, not after everything that had happened lately. All those arguments with his girlfriend, Ginny's behaviour, his lack of interest towards her… and not to forget the
"What about everyone at school?" Draco still pointed out. "First of all, your friends. They won't be happy about this."
to be, this was what he had waited for all his life. Malfoy's lips were so soft, so smooth, so perfect against Harry's own and he never wanted to let the man go. These lips were meant for him only, him and no one else.
Harry angrily forked some more stew and potatoes to his mouth, glancing towards the Slytherin table accross the Great Hall. Malfoy was sitting in between Theodore and Pansy, resting his chin against his palm. He seemed to be lost in his thoughts and Harry wondered what Malfoy could be thinking of. The Slytherin was staring at the table, not taking any part in the conversation with his friends...
An hour later Harry was lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling. He had been lying there almost for half an hour already, listening to Ron's loud snoring that filled the room. He was very, very drunk and unable to sleep. He had always had trouble sleeping when he was drunk but this time it was for another reason. Actually, for many reasons…
He lowered his gaze back to his drink again, taking a sip, finally fully emptying his glass. From the corner of his eye he could still see Malfoy looking at him, but he didn't dare to look at the Slytherin anymore. Instead he decided to get up and walk at the bar counter again. He was a mess. He really needed another drink right now, to calm him down.
"Oh my", the other man said in a teasing tone, a lustful glint in his eyes. "All wet already? You've seriously missed this."
Like everyone had suspected, the next schoolweek didn't start any easier for the 8th grade students.
They spent a long time kissing, holding and looking at each other before finally turning the lights off, about to get some sleep. Harry had no intention of going back to his and Ron's room tonight. Actually, he would rather sleep next to Draco every night from now on.
"I will do my best, Mrs Malfoy", Harry said, taking a hold of his boyfriend's hand. Both Draco and his mum smiled at him.
have you heard?" the Slytherin finally asked him, pretending to be calm, but Harry knew that he wasn't.
Draco's trousers soon joined his red shirt on the floor and then he finally pulled Harry's blouse off as well, revealing the slightly muscular and tanned skin. His eyes were admiring his fiance's upper body.
The other man looked confused at first until a tiny, relieved smile appeared to his lips as well. "Morning", he whispered. "So it wasn't just another dream after all?"
The common room was still empty but he could hear some clattering and talking coming from the bedroom corridor. Raising his eyebrow, Harry opened the door, entering the corridor. His eyes widened a little at the sight.
"Where are you going?" Draco asked and followed Harry to the hallway when he saw him pulling his coat on again.
ruined everything?!" Ginny hissed back at him. "Would you finally mind telling me what is going on here?!"
"Not tonight...", Harry said in the dim bedroom. There was an apologetic, melancholic tone in his voice.
Harry turned towards the crowd again, his eyes swiping through the quests. His eyes widened when he recognized someone who he had definitely not expected to come, despite sending him an invitation. But there he was, his cousin Dudley, looking a little lost at the hall full of witches and wizards, sitting at the last row with his brown haired girlfriend. He had clearly lost a lot of weight since Harry had last seen him. Harry's and Dudley's eyes met for a short while and they both gave a short nod to each other before Dudley turned to his girlfriend again.
After they had finished eating and drinking and Harry had paid their pricey bill, they headed out and just walked in the chilly Christmas night, looking at the beautiful Christmas lights and listening as some children were singing Christmas songs. They were both a little drunk and walking hand in hand, and it felt so right that at that moment Harry didn't even care if someone could see them. Of course he was still feeling a little worried about what the Daily Prophet would write about him and Draco when it’d come out, but sooner or later it would have to happen anyway. Draco Malfoy was the one Harry wanted and he would not lose the man because of being ashamed of him. His reputation would definitely come crashing down after the revelation, but it would be worth it. He was tired of living how other people wanted him to. He wanted to start living the life the way
”Oh, right... Just take it”, Harry said, closing the book. He was absentmindedly stroking his messy hair with his fingers, and once again made a quick glance to his right. Ron slowly took back the book and started flipping the pages.
Ron was eyeing Hermione sceptically for a while, until his eyes fixed on Harry again instead. "Why would Malfoy even have to spend the Christmas alone?"
He and Malfoy had ended up lying spooning sometime overnight, Harry being the little spoon. Malfoy's body was tightly pressed against his backside, his right hand under Harry's head and his left hand thrown over his chest. Being hugged by Malfoy so tightly was like a dream come true to Harry. Malfoy's naked lower body pressed against his own naked skin and their firmly intertwined fingers... Oh Merlin how
"Thanks, Ron", Harry answered dryly, taking a sip of his orange juice. "I couldn't sleep well. I was having horrible nightmares the whole night."
They finally took their own places at the front, under the arch, and it was time for the man from the ministry, Samuel Rivers, to start the wedding ceremony.
Harry stared at the Slytherin who was still avoiding looking him in the eyes. It was still so weird to hear Malfoy say sorry about
"Of course it's allowed, Harry", Hermione said. "Just ignore Ron. He's just disappointed you're not coming and going to be with Malfoy instead. He's jealous."
"I'm not. But have you even thought about the possibility that maybe Malfoy was just having a nightmare?!" Hermione said persistently.
Soon Harry was already thrusting a little faster and Draco was in heaven. Damn how much he loved Harry's cock. It was so big, so perfect. And all his. Yeah, Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, The Saviour of the Wizarding World, the Hero... the man with so many names, all his, and always would be.
that would get him in the mood. He found it very disturbing that there was no bulge to be found, just flatness, nothing to free and grasp no matter how much he tried to search for it.
He stayed at the bar counter for a while, just sipping his beer with his back turned to his party. He had already been drinking quite many drinks tonight so he was starting to feel the effect of the alcohol, but he wanted to be drunk to survive through the night. He needed to be able to relax, he needed to act casually and alcohol helped with that a bit. There were all too many thoughts going through his mind...
worse. He remembered all too clearly how that slender body had felt pressed against his own last night. It had felt so
He glanced at the other man. Those beautiful stormy grey eyes, long dark eyelashes... Damn, the man was breathtaking!
Harry hadn't been cheating on him. Harry loved him and still wanted to marry him and have a family with him...
"Yeah, right", Harry teased, but after seeing the sulky look on Malfoy's face he quickly added: "I won't tell anyone, though. I promise." He passed his hand towards the other man. "Let's shake on it."
That was all the letter said, but Harry knew it must have required a lot from Malfoy to say even that much to him. Malfoys didn't usually thank anyone, so this meant a lot. They’d never talked about it afterwards.
Harry gave his best friend a slightly vexed look, causing Ron to shut up. Harry had heard the question so many times from his friend during the last two weeks that he wasn't at all surprised anymore. However, he did feel a little bitter that Ron still dared to say something like that on his big day.
In the back of the library he saw a glimpse of platinum blond hair. Harry's steps slowed down immediately and soon he found himself turning around, heading to that direction. He was sure that it was Malfoy. And yes, he was right. The Slytherin was standing there in between the two bookshelves, back towards him, facing the window. Harry noticed that he had a book on his hand but he was not looking at it at the moment. Instead he was clearly staring out of the window, though Harry couldn't see his face.
about you, I thought you were kidnapped or something. And then you arrive back, on afternoon, bragging that you've been clubbing, not even telling me with who, and you are wearing clothes like
"Yep", Harry said blithely, grinning at the shocked look on the other man's face. "You've never cooked before?"
"Two weeks, I know", Harry said. "But I've known you for years and you've been a big part of my life... in both good and bad."
Harry's eyes were starting to burn from the restrained tears but it only made him even more angry at himself. He did not want to start crying in front of Draco Malfoy! There was
Harry's heart jumped in his chest. Everyone else had already arrived, so it was very clear who were the ones finally coming back. Harry, who was already standing in front of his and Ron's door, got a sudden idea and quickly pulled his invisibility cloak from his pocket, starting to cover himself up. He was barely ready when the door leading to the corridor already opened up.
Harry grabbed his pyjamas next and sat to the edge of the bed, starting to tuck his feet in them, not answering. His head was so full of guilt right now that he was simply unable to speak. He was disgusted by himself and the terrible hangover was making it much worse. He let out a heavy sigh.
"Only for you,dry balls-sama," Hairy smirks smuggly. Drago runs his hand through the Hairy man, he is so overgrown with fur he resembles a large retriever dog. Hairy barks, Drago is now a furry.
Hairy blushes in response, digging his nails into the arm of Drago. "You're so sexy I want you to be my father."
"You're so delicious Hairy..." Drago whispers, and he punches Hairy in the guts. He also rips Hairy's pants off and starts eating it piece by peace.
In a fit of rage and jealousy, Drago gives Hairy an ass massage using his chainsaw and butt(er) knife. He chops up Hairy's now no longer hairy ass and sells it on ebay for sentimental purposes. Tis good SooShe. Drago, in turn, claps his own springy ass with such resolution that it is in extremely high resolution (4k UHD).
It was a sunny afternoon, a Hairy Pot stomps into the Hoggywart school ground. The ground trembles and shakes underneath his sticky toes and fungi filled nails. He growl sexily, jutting out his jaw and his ass to form a C. He sees the C and turns into a sea. He wiggles and glimmers, his bright surface wide and endless like his left butt cheek but not his right. They kiss under the light of the bouncy butt, making sticky meat smacking noises. It's very sticky. He hasn't washed it in 204 years. Suddenly, a rat walks in !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"B-BAKA! 0////0" Drago whines as he stabs everyone to death. Everyone shivers as they line up to be stabbed. They wait for their impending doom as Drago denies his love for Hairy. "I-it's not like I l-like you or a-anything," Draco squeals like the rat he is, blushing furiously. His blush was so furious it got casted in the next Fast and Furious movie, Fast and Furious 99999999.
Drago's jaw unhinges with joy and his shoulder dislocates from his eyelid. He starts blinking rapidly, wanting to turn down the offer but also wanting to shimmy up a chimney. He shimmy (shimmy)-d his way up the shimmy-ing chimney, effectively turning into reverse-santa and throwing up cookies. His elongated nose wiggles in the wind as he starts tor-pedo-ing into children's homes. He watches them sleep while salivating and rubbing his hands until sparks fly out.
Harry kisses his muscular, waffle like body, smudging his nose across it and covering it with slug slime and mucus. "I've coated your body to protect your beautiful muscular abs," Hairy says breathlessly. Drago blushes, reaching out to sexily lick Harry's ear snot. Hairy can feel his warm, moist tongue inside his ear, caressing, licking and teasing him. He stumbles and fall to the ground. They tumble down the hill, get several concussions, and ultimately were rendered unconscious. Yet despite this, they never broke their deep passionate kiss, and stayed connected throughout the entire fearful upheaval.
"What are you doing?!" insists Drago, as he seduces his peanuts. His small dry balls inflate to be the size of the moon before they explode, raining a rain of hot steamy pus. Hairy smirks as he becomes very very hairy, the hair climbing from his nostrils and into Drago's ears so he can no longer hear anything.
"U r so hairy Dragoogoo baby," Hairy screams into the nape of Drago's neck. He bites a chunk out of it and sparkly black blood gushes out from his plastic neck (geddit becus im goffik) Attack on Titan style as he savours the unwashed flavour.
Hairy pats the bed that is currently sinking into the earth. "Come join meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee."
Suddenly, Drago emerges from the ground, passes gas, then passes out. He then continues to pass away.
"Don't you know it's RUDE to ask these things?!" Drago screams as his spit flies at Hairy's face and melts away all his skin. "FUCK YOU AND YOUR USELESS NIPPLES!!!1!!1!1!"
Drago pins Hairy against the wall, trapping him in his embrace. "You are so....motherfucking," Drago whispers, his hot breath tickling Hairy's ears.
Hairy caresses his useless nippies. He ignores Drago's nippleless body and stares at his beautiful shining abs instead. He runs his hands across it. "Drago do you work out?"
Hairy giggles. While Drago was away, Hairy has been boiling the sea water for Drago to drink. He has also been splattering himself with his own ear wax. He drips the ear wax slowly into the boiling sea water, making his own ear wax scented candle for his loved one to enjoy. He is so demented. Hairy is also so constipated that only a little bit of shit pops up from his ear when he puts in all his focus. He then eats it after plucking it from his ear.
Ten minutes later they had apparated to Harry's bedroom and Harry was lying on the bed on his stomach, totally naked, Draco's two long fingers already deep inside him. Until that day, Harry had only topped so it was the first time he was being the bottom and while it felt very weird and embarrassing it
There were lots of questions running through Harry's mind. Why did Malfoy have to be a dick? Was it really true that he wasn't gay or did Malfoy actually have feelings for Theodore and he was just afraid of admitting it?
Harry was waiting for Ginny in the library, finishing his Dark Arts homework, and of course that was when Malfoy entered the library as well. Malfoy was already passing by when he suddenly slowed down, noticing him sitting there.
As the music echoed through the hall, they leaned close to each other and started to dance to the song.
Having finished laughing, Harry became serious again. "Umm… Malfoy", he said, gaining the other man's attention immediately.
"Listen. I also made a promise that we're not going to talk about his personal business anymore, so if you don't mind...", he said, giving them a meaningful look. They both nodded.
"There's just one thing that's worrying me", she mumbled. "What is the reason you are obsessed with him? With Voldemort gone, what is it
"I know", Harry said with a sigh. "But if they won't accept us together, they're not my real friends, right?"
He decided to lie down on the sofa, closing his eyes, thinking. He knew what Ginny wanted, but Harry hadn't had sex with anyone yet.
When Ginny broke their kiss and looked at him with her deep brown eyes, he felt nothing. Nothing close to... He glanced over the couch to the other side of the room, where Malfoy was talking with Blaise and Pansy. Malfoy was facing Harry and Ginny, but he wasn't
"Everything alright, mate?" Ron, his bestman, asked quietly from his right side, placing a hand on his shoulder.
"Oh", Harry said, raising his eyebrow, observing Malfoy. The Slytherin looked quite tense right now. "Why not", he finally answered. "I don't have any plans yet, so…"
"Let's go to Honeydukes too", Ron said. Harry lifted his gaze towards his best friend, sitting on the other side of the table.
"The others boys kept going on and on about their sexual fantasies with different girls, talking about boobs and stuff... Not me. My biggest fantasy was to be taken by The Boy Who Lived
The sofa was starting to feel a bit too comfortable and Harry turned to his side, closing his eyes. He'd rest just for a while and then move to his bed, he thought to himself.
" he said self-evidently. "How would I be able to miss when she was trying her best to get to ride your dick on that couch, right in front of my very eyes." There was once again that bitter tone in his voice and he paused before adding: "What I'm trying to say here is... are you
"Nothing", Harry hurried to say, forcing a silly smile to his face. "I was just caught up thinking how lucky I am."
Draco let out a scornful snort, finally pushing Harry away from him. "Cut the crap! You would only be glad to get rid of me!"
"Really", Malfoy answered. "I can't wait to see where you live. And the Black family's heritage, of course."
And just like that they found themselves at the Three Broomsticks later that evening. The inn was very crowded because it was Saturday, but they were still able to find a free table.
"Hey, we are going to Hogsmeade later today. Would you like to join us?" she suggested out of the blue. "The two of you", she added, pointing at the two Slytherins walking next to them. She received puzzled, incredulous looks from both of them. Ron seemed to be gasping for air as well, glaring at his girlfriend as if she had lost her mind completely by totally ruining their long awaited Saturday night like this.
"Gosh, Ron", Harry sighed heavily. "I'm happy to get out of the school for a while after all that studying, okay? Is that not allowed? Don't wanna waste the whole holiday sulking..."
"Draco, you don't have to say anything more if you don't want to", Harry said, moving his hand to caress the Slytherin's hair gently.
Draco was about to answer, when he heard a familiar voice calling out from the living room: "Who is it?!"
"Oh, Harry...", Ginny purred as their lips parted, her hand slipping inside Harry's pants at the same time.
Harry was staring at his almost full plate with glazed eyes now. It sounded like Malfoy had given Theodore what he’d wanted... Harry didn't feel like eating anymore.
Draco, however, shook his head. "I have to buy this one on my own", he said. "Let's meet here in an hour, okay?"
have you been keeping secrets from us?" he asked. "Come on, Harry. We are your friends, you can tell us
At first they hung around at Grimmauld Place, just relaxing and enjoying each others company. Harry loved talking with Draco, at the same time getting to know him even better. For example, Harry had known that Draco liked reading, but he hadn't known what kind of books the blond preferred the most. He hadn't known that Draco's favourite colour, instead of black that he usually loved to wear, was actually white. He hadn't known that after they were going to graduate, Draco was planning to move to London as well and get his own flat. There were a lot of things he hadn't known about the Slytherin and he wanted to learn every single detail about him.
Draco pulled away and thrust back in a little harder and deeper and Harry was suddenly shuddering from pleasure, gasping: "Ah,
"Yeah, I know", Draco said with another sigh. "But I can't answer your question yet. I've never even thought about it before, so..."
Harry also secretly observed Malfoy at lunch, being glad to see that this time the other man ate a little better. He also seemed to have a good conversation with his friends and was even wearing a tiny smile on his lips. However, Harry was suddenly woken from his thoughts when he realized that he had been caught staring.
Harry was staring after his now ex-girlfriend, a hand pressed against his burning cheek. He had already been pushed to the floor and hit his head because of it, he had been punched by Draco, and now he had been slapped by Ginny... What a perfect start for a new term... Also, he could imagine Draco crying his eyes out at the moment, thinking that Harry had only been using him in a cruel, twisted way... The thought was killing him, and...
Most of the Gryffindor and Slytherin students spent the evening in the common room, flipping through their school books, groaning, cursing and writing as fast as they were able to. Everyone was in bad temper.
"Yeah... That will never happen", Harry said, his eyes still on the kitchen where Draco was busy making tea for them.
"With a lot of money almost anything is possible", Narcissa continued, smiling. "And you both know that money is not a problem for us, so we would be happy to help if -"
They finally ended up watching some comedy film together, eating the snacks that Harry had bought from the store at the same time. Draco seemed to be slowly getting used to the television thing and he concentrated on it entirely. Harry, however, found himself being more interested in watching Draco than the movie. He just couldn't help it.
Harry gave another sigh and shook his head as well. "No, Malfoy. No benefits, just a normal friendship. We already talked about this yesterday... I have a girlfriend."
Harry let out another heavy sigh, gaze on his moving feet. Theodore's words made him feel even more terrible. "But after today, he hates me. I wonder if he'll ever even talk to me again."
"For goodness sake, Potter, would you mind not to scare me like that", Malfoy hissed, swiping his blond hair from his forehead where it had fallen. He turned towards the bookshelf, sideways to Harry, not looking at him.
Goyle was already adjusting the last pieces of his accessories on their places. "That's it", he finally said. "Finished."
"Because I was wasted and you had been messing with my head by trying to kiss me", Malfoy pointed out.
Harry and Draco were lying under a blanket on the Slytherin's bed, their naked bodies entwined. They had just spent almost an hour making love to each other and Harry was exhausted. He had wanted Draco to top him again, and blimey, it had been fantastic.
It took a while before they’d found everything. Harry was crawling on all fours along the corridor, reaching for Draco’s inkwell that was still there in the corner, lying almost hidden next to a huge houseplant.
Harry was still eyeing Theodore. If he hadn't already been aware of the other man's feelings towards Malfoy, it was crystal clear by now. He could see it from all the emotions going through Theodore’s face. There was sorrow, yearning, bitterness… Everything was written on his pale face. The saddest thing of all was that Malfoy didn't seem to care at all. Harry felt pity for Theodore.
Sometimes they were still sitting at the Great Hall next to each other and sometimes they were still studying together or changing a few words – but that was it. Things between them weren't the same anymore, they clearly weren't best friends like they used to be. Things had really changed after their "date-night", or whatever it had been. Harry still hadn't asked Malfoy about what had happened that night and the Slytherin hadn't opened up about it himself either, but something clearly had changed. Harry knew that Malfoy wouldn't have been crying that night and switching rooms the next day for nothing. It bothered Harry but he didn't dare to ask.
Everyone was having a lazy day, trying to gather strength for another rough school week that would start tomorrow.
Now that they were so close to each other and under the cloak, Harry was able to smell the Slytherins lovely scent even better, as well. He was breathing it deep into his lungs, almost drowning in it. It made him feel like he was losing his mind.
Instead of Theodore, however, he saw both Ron and Hermione coming in, and from the looks on his friend's faces he knew they had heard about him and Draco.
If Harry had had any doubts about Malfoy's interest towards him earlier, he didn't anymore. Malfoy was clinging onto him like there was no tomorrow, almost crushing him with his lips as they were both seeking dominance just like they always had, and when their lips finally parted for longer than one or two seconds, the Slytherin was looking at him with so much longing and lust in his grey eyes, breathing heavily: "Damn I want you..."
"Let's just say that...", Malfoy started, now sounding quite tense. He began steering the new furnishings to right places. "...things have
think Harry's done the right thing", she said, surprising both Harry and Ron with her words. "They were both supposed to spend the Christmas on their own, so it's nicer to spend it together, right?"
There was a hesitant, kind of shy look in the Slytherin's eyes before he very quietly murmured: "I'm feeling a little oblivious tonight… I think I might forget to lock my door."
Hermione was rolling her eyes. "Yeah, right. You've been staring at him a lot… I see the way you look at him", she pointed out. "If you're not obsessed, then tell me the reason for that."
... Harry remembered all of that all too well. Malfoy had changed since then, but you never knew for sure when talking about him. He would definitely have to talk to Malfoy about it later today. He should have done it already.
After all, they were going to spend the next two weeks together at his place with no one else around. He would have plenty of time to think about everything and find the right words to say and, of course, gather some more courage.
"Well done", Harry groaned. He instantly pushed Draco on his back on the bed and kept pounding into his completely exhausted body until he came as well a short while later, collapsing on top of the blond.
"What am I supposed to do then? What do you suggest?!" Malfoy grunted. "Because I don't know what the fuck am I supposed to do anymore!"
"I know he's done horrible things, okay!" he said. "He tried his best to make my life hell for years! But he was a child then. Just a child who was raised by his parents to hate muggles, raised to be a bully... and as for the Death Eater thing, he was
"What the hell...", he muttered by himself. He didn't know much about jewellery or watches, but looking at the watch in his hand, he could still tell that it had cost
A moan escaped Draco's lips as Harry lowered his head and started to tease the head of his cock with his swift, talented tongue. God but Draco loved it. Harry really, really knew how to use that tongue, and he really knew how to drive Draco absolutely crazy.
"How the bloody hell should I know?! Don't ask me! There's no reasonable explanation for fucking Malfoy!"
Later Harry released the Snitch he had brought there with him. Since they both used to be Seekers in their own teams, they also wanted to have a competition about catching the Snitch.
The Slytherin finally turned to face him, and Harry could see how much pain he had caused him involuntarily. It was all there to be seen in his eyes.
Hermione gave him a withering look. "I don't believe you. You're just making it all up because you still hate him", she said after coming closer, the tone of her whispering sounding quite angry.
Harry was glad that he had been wrong. He was also glad to see that Malfoy didn't seem so unhappy anymore. He was smiling more often, sleeping better and he even ate better.
Harry, once again feeling butterflies in his stomach, slowly leaned closer and pulled the Slytherin into a kiss. He felt the other man's long fingers sink into this messy hair as their lips moved against each other’s tenderly. Harry parted his lips slightly, letting Malfoy’s tongue touch his own.
Malfoys grey eyes weren't directed towards Ron anymore. No, they were directed sideways, staring straight at Harry's own. The man may have been staring at him for a long time already, but Harry hadn't noticed.
"I know", Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. "You just spent the last few hours eating her face in front of my eyes, trying to prove how straight you are."
Harry finally turned his head to side, facing the other man. "I can't quite believe what just happened", he said. "I've never even..." He paused. It was awkward to put it into words, to admit his inexperience to the other man. "...and now with...
They all sighed heavily and entered their bedrooms. Harry quickly changed to his pyjamas and went to bed, closing the curtains around it.
Draco also often saw Harry staring distractedly into emptiness for a good long while, and he couldn't help wondering what it was that he was thinking then. Was it work stuff? Or was it something else... or
"Calm down, Theo", Blaise said, roughly leading his angry boyfriend towards the living room with Greg's help. "Violence won't solve anything. Besides, if anyone has the right to kill Potter, it is Draco. Not you."
"Godric's Hollow", Harry answered. Draco raised his eyebrow questioningly and Harry added: "To see my parents."
Harry turned to glance at Hermione, who was now smiling. Harry only flashed back a very uneasy grin, returning back to his drink again.
Hermione and Ron turned to look at Harry. They had no idea what he was talking about. He quickly looked to his side, making sure that anyone else wasn't listening.
"I do, a lot", Draco objected, staring at his feet. "You even saved me from the Fiendfyre, risking your life for me... I still don't know why you did it. I didn't
Harry's heart was once again pounding madly in his chest. Damn it. He was lost in Malfoy's eyes. He wanted to close the distance and kiss the man. His gaze dropped down to Malfoy's beautiful pink lips and then back up again.
"Yeah...", Harry mumbled. Once again he found his drunken eyes wandering on the Slytherin's slim body for a little too long and he quickly turned towards the bar counter again. "You having fun?" he managed to ask.
Malfoy, looking almost as shocked as Harry, quickly wrenched himself from Harry's grip, turning his back on him. With shaking hands he pulled his pyjama shirt on, starting to button it up.
There was a very expensive looking wristwatch inside. Harry slowly took it out of the box, taking a closer look at it, his other hand in front of his mouth. The watch was made of white gold and it had small emerald green details in it.
felt anything like this towards anyone else before", he continued, now lowering his gaze to his feet. "You see, I keep thinking about you all the time and... also, I've got this weird urge to protect you. I know there are people who want to make you suffer for what you've done in the past and..." Fuck, he was babbling. Harry's cheeks were starting to burn. "I just want you to know that... you are safe with me. I will not let anything happen to you, Draco.
"Really?" Malfoy teased. His closeness was causing cold shivers to travel down Harry's spine again. "And what about
Malfoy still didn't look at him and Harry wasn't even sure if he was listening to him anymore. He had really ruined everything.
"I'll tell you what's going on", the brunet said, a mischievous glint in his dark eyes. "Your boyfriend spent the whole Christmas break with Draco Malfoy behind your back."
"Life is full of surprises. Sometimes love happens in the least expected ways", Rivers continued. "This is what happened for Harry and Draco. Who would have thought that years of hatred would turn into a blossoming love? Love is unpredictable, it just happens so unexpectedly, so suddenly, without our control."
"Malfoy, I've been wondering", he started. Malfoy turned to look at him. "Is it true that you and Theo...?"
He had totally forgotten that Malfoy had been sitting there in the corner this whole time while he and Ginny had been kissing and talking. He was waiting for a scornful remark at the very least, but it never came. Harry didn't know why but he actually felt a bit annoyed about the silence this time. At times like this he kind of missed arguing with Malfoy.
Once again, Draco looked very dapper in his all dark silk suit, his platinum, medium long hair magnificently styled. The man was out of this world and Harry still couldn't believe that of all the possible people in the world, Draco had set eyes on
Harry felt his heart starting to beat faster as Malfoy was suddenly leaning much closer to him, his body pressing heavily against Harry's back. He swallowed, cursing in his mind. Damn Malfoy and his perfect, slender body against him, damn this man for making him feel this way again...
"Well… Kind of", Malfoy answered. "I gotta admit that Weasley's not as bad as I always thought… He's drunk and still annoying but he's… okay, I guess. Who would have thought."
Harry didn't care. His head felt like exploding, he was filled with anger and pain and he wanted to cause as much pain to this man who had enjoyed his distress. He kept kicking the other man, his fingernails sinking into the other man's neck at the same time.
Ginny's smile widened, and before Harry had any time to react, she had already smashed her lips against his mouth and kissed him hungrily. He quickly responded to the kiss, running his hands through her long hair. Ginny always managed to blow Harry's mind with her kissing skills, but on the other hand she had dated many guys so it was no wonder why she knew how to kiss so well.
Ginny's attitude towards Malfoy was also making Harry doubt everything. He had thought of Ginny as a warm, righteous person but today Ginny had shown him that she could be very cruel as well. Talking about Malfoy that way, when Harry knew better…
"One of those nightmares again?" Ron asked. He was sitting on his own bed and staring at him, still looking very drunk and also worried.
"Don't!" he said hoarsely, not able to face the other man right now. He walked to the door and left Malfoy's room without one glance backwards. Closing the door behind him, he found himself heading straight to the bathroom to throw up.
It didn't take more than few seconds before Harry was already on top of him, all ready. "Ready?" he asked him, smiling.
Draco froze. Trying to grasp what had just happened and to stay calm, he asked as casually as he could: "Why? What's wrong?"
If Harry still hadn't been entirely sure about his feelings towards the Slytherin, one evening totally ensured it.
"Listen, Ginny", he started again. He was still trying his best to keep his voice calm, only it was starting to get really difficult now. "He is not like he used to be. He's changed. You think you know him but you really know nothing about him."
"I don't know", Ginny said, shaking her head. "I can't say you can't come but... I don't know if it's... uh... I know mum is waiting for you to join us and everything but... I don't know, okay! You have to think about it yourself."
Malfoy seemed to hesitate, his eyes resting on Harry now. "If she wanted to break up with you... what would you think about that?" he finally asked.
Harry sighed, now staring to the lake. "Yes, it is different", he said. "And it might not matter anything to others... but it will always be there to remind me of the day my parents died and... I'll never get rid of it either." Malfoy was now looking at him, listening. "We all have our own scars and stories behind them... Visible or invisible", Harry continued. "But you are
"Don't worry", he said with a smile on his lips, starting to button up his coat. "You're lucky because
Malfoy nodded, still not looking at him. Harry honestly didn't know what to say. He’d had no idea that Theodore was gay.
"Right now", Harry said and stood up, dragging his girlfriend with him as he stormed through the Great Hall, almost everyone's eyes following them as they left.
His thoughts left Ginny and travelled back to Malfoy again. Why the hell had he suggested Malfoy to give Theodore a chance, when in fact he wanted nothing less?
Harry startled, quickly glancing over his shoulder and saw the blond Slytherin standing few meters away from him, already wearing his black pyjamas.
Silence fell over them. They were both just staring at the ceiling for a good while, both deep in their own thoughts. Harry was starting to feel very uneasy now that the the effect of alcohol had slowly started to fade away. He realized that he should probably return to his own bed.
Malfoy finished buttoning his shirt and started pulling his trousers off next, still his back turned towards Harry.
"Oh f-fuck...", Harry heard the other man groaning as he was eagerly sucking on the Slytherin's throat and rubbing their crotches together at the same time.
"Merlin, Draco. This must have cost a fortune", Harry said, lowering his gaze back to the watch, admiring it. "I can't believe you'd go and buy me something like this..."
When the other man finally looked at him, there was a melancholic, embarrassed look in his grey eyes.
Draco really tried his best not to think about anything she had told him that day, and in the end he forgot the whole thing.
"I don't know", Harry said with a heavy sigh. His eyes were filling with tears again, just thinking about Draco and how long the man had secretly wanted him, just to get his heart broken by him. "But it doesn't matter anymore... He hates me and never wants me near him again. So what are you waiting for? It's your chance to steal him."
Malfoy sighed angrily, pulling up the sleeves of his left arm in frustration, showing it at Harry. Harry was staring at his arm for a good while. The Dark Mark had faded to a huge, ugly scar in Malfoy's inner forearm after Harry had defeated Voldemort, but it was still definitely there.
After the door of the 12 Grimmauld Place closed behind them, Harry instantly found himself being pressed against the nearest wall in the hallway.
Harry hesitated for a short while. "Well, I just came from flying... but yes, I guess I could join you. I'll just go get changed real quickly, okay?"
Damn... The sight had driven Draco crazy ever since the very first time he had seen the other man without shirt at Hogwarts, and it still did, every single time. Harry wasn't a very self-confident person when it came to his looks, however, so he had no idea how sexy he looked in Draco's eyes. Well, Draco had told him about it many times but Harry never seemed to believe him. Harry had always been so insecure about the way he looked, and still was. But in Draco's eyes Harry was perfect. His eyes, his tanned skin, his untidy raven-black hair, his lightning bolt scar... They were all part of Harry and he wanted him just the way he was. He knew he wouldn't change a thing though he had used to mock him about his appearance when they were younger.
Harry shrugged. "Do we have any plans for Saturday?" He turned to look at his friends questioningly. Ron was petting Hermione's hair and shook his head. "I guess I don't have any", Harry said to Ginny.
Ginny didn't even bother answering to him. She resumed her path with her friend without another word, leaving the library.
They arrived to the graveyard where they spent a good while just standing in silence in front of the headstone that had been engraved with his parents dates of birth and death, and the message:
Malfoy startled and quickly turned to look at him. For a second it seemed like the blond was relieved to see that it was Harry, which was very weird, but the look quickly faded away. Harry sat next to him.
"It's so weird", Harry finally said, gaining Malfoy's attention. "Sitting here with you. Us not trying to kill each other anymore."
Draco buried his face to Greg's shirt again, gripping his friend even more tightly, thinking. What the hell, there was no reason to try and gloss things over. They would hear all about it anyway, sooner or later...
He could see Hermione, Luna, Neville, Dean, and Seamus. He could see Theodore and Blaise, wearing matching dark blue dress robes, busy whispering with each other. He could see Pansy Parkinson with his at least ten years older boyfriend Alec, Draco's relatives, and the full Weasley family. He swallowed hard when he realized that Ginny was also sitting there with her family. Harry had invited the whole Weasley family because he had not dared to leave Ginny out of the guest list, but he hadn't thought that she would actually come. Not after all that had happened between them. And still, there she was, sitting next to her mom.
He tried his best to hide the fact that Malfoy's words were cutting into him like a knife. Had last night meant
Harry's eyes flew open. He glanced to his side, seeing Ron slowly getting up and groaning tiredly in his own bed
Malfoy's face was unreadable. "Right", he said, turning towards the castle. "We should probably get going."
Harry, who had been drowning in his thoughts, slowly turned to look at the other man. He had no idea what Theodore was talking about. He was too busy thinking of Draco and how he could manage to make the man listen to him.
Harry jumped up, noticing that the flames in the fireplace had died sometime while he’d been resting his eyes.
He would watch Malfoy spending time with his Slytherin friends. He would watch him in their shared classes: Transfiguration and Potions, seeing him fully concentrating on his studies. He would watch Malfoy studying or hanging out with Theodore a lot, spending way too much time together for Harry's liking. He would watch Malfoy at the library: see the blond walking alone between the bookshelves, browsing through the dusty books with a blank face. He would watch him at meals at the Great Hall, noticing how little he actually ever ate anything. He would watch Malfoy spend less and less of his time with others at their Common room and go spend it in his own bedroom instead. It made Harry feel kind of sad somehow, but he didn't have a chance to confront Malfoy because he was, after all, always with Ginny. But that was how few weeks passed on and suddenly it was already November.
"You know... I could check your essay if you want me to", Harry suddenly heard him suggest out of the blue.
The train ride towards Hogwarts went slowly. Harry kept chatting with his friends but his thoughts were on different matters. He kept staring out of the window at the passing scenery, thinking of what was waiting for him when they were to arrive at school.
This time it was Ginny who gathered some curious looks aimed towards her. She had really flown off the handle, although not as badly as Harry himself had yesterday.
Harry knew that Ginny would not be delighted to hear where he had spent last night, especially so after hearing who he had spent it with. Nevertheless, it was clear that lying to her girlfriend would only make things even worse. He had already told Ron and Hermione and they might accidentally let something slip, if they hadn't already. Besides, Harry wasn't afraid of Ginny's opinion. He had quite enjoyed last night with Malfoy and he didn't regret it. In fact, he was willing to do it again sometime, just like they had planned.
Hermione was looking at him with a very serious look on her face. "Harry, I…", she started, hesitating. She was clearly trying to find the right words to say and it seemed to be very difficult for her. "I'm worried about you."
Then, suddenly, the Slytherin decided to roll them over so it was Malfoy lying on top now. Their mouths crashed against each other's again and they kissed hungrily. Harry lowered his hands to Malfoy's lower body at the same time, starting to shamelessly squeeze his buttocks that were still covered by very expensive looking white satin pyjamas.
Malfoy sighed, slowly turning to look at him. "Why are you talking to me?" he asked back, sounding pissed.
He kept caressing the Slytherin's innocent looking sleeping face and finally he saw the stormy grey eyes opening up very, very slowly and slightly, immediately boring into his own.
"I guess part of that is true", Harry said, crouching down to the ground to light up a candle with his wand.
Harry gulped. He hadn't expected Malfoy and Goyle to join them after what had happened between him and Malfoy earlier. Tonight was inevitably going to be a really, really awkward and interesting one.
"I guess that's true", Harry said, smiling back. "But it's different now, it's a lot worse when it comes to you." He paused and took a deep breath before continuing: "I know I'm still in a relationship with Ginny, but I've already decided that after we get back to Hogwarts... I'm going to break up with her, for good. I don't want to be with her anymore... It doesn't feel right." Another short pause. "What I'm trying to say here is... it's
But, as said, getting closer to Malfoy had its downsides too. Day by day, the more Harry got to know Malfoy better and the more he and Malfoy were spending time together, his mind became even messier.
Harry found himself shamelessly inhaling the beautiful scent of his ex-rival. Damn... Malfoy smelled
"Don't even think about it", Harry said, cutting off the Slytherin's sentence. "It's the one you chose for me. I'd never return it."
The Slytherin had smiled back at Harry and just stood there the whole time, just watching as he prepared their dinner from beginning to end.
The next two minutes Draco was gasping and moaning as Harry kept preparing him with dedication. Damn but it felt good. The first time that Harry had prepared him with his tongue he had only been extremely embarrassed, but now he had gotten used to it, even though they hadn't done it too often. It did feel wonderful and he absolutely loved it.
"You really think you're something special, Malfoy. But you are not", she had said, shaking her head. "Let me remind you that he used to call me special too, to tell me what a beautiful and invaluable person I am to him. How I mean
"Are you serious?!" Harry snapped at him, glaring at his outfit from head to toes at the same time. "You just decided to go clubbing,
After a long, intense kiss they kept resting in each others arms, just holding and caressing one another.
As Malfoy finally returned with a new drink and took a seat across from him again, Harry didn't know how to be. His mind kept repeating Malfoy's words and he didn't know if he should look at him or not. He soon noticed that Malfoy was having the same problem himself. There was a light blush on the Slytherin's face as he kept nervously touching his glass, changing his posture all the time and trying to concentrate on what others were talking about. Once in a while Harry could see Malfoy glancing towards his direction as he was sipping his drink. Harry always looked away, unsure of how to react. And that's how the rest of the night at Hog's Head went by, until they were finally making their way back to Hogwarts.
He quickly turned around, making his way towards the exit, glancing backwards once. To his surpise he saw Malfoy looking back at him with a slightly wistful look on his pale face before he left the library.
"I wouldn't have thought that either", Blaise, who had been very quiet until now, commented. "Not in a million years."
Draco, however, just grinned. "Don't be sorry." He grabbed the towel Harry had thrown at him. "It's only good to get used to it..." He winked.
Both of his friends turned to look at him. He had really scared them. And they were not the only people staring, they had already gained lots of inquisitive eyes on them, from all over the Great Hall. Even Malfoy was watching them, mouth slightly open, clearly enjoying the show.
"I'm sorry, but it really does sound like you've been fooled by him for a long time", Theo sighed, his hand on Draco's shoulder.
Draco turned sideways to Harry, setting his coat on the rack, chuckling by himself at Harry's reaction.
Harry nodded, watching with furrowed brows as the Slytherin flashed a small smile at him and walked away.
"I will teach him a lesson", Draco said, his lips curving up into a diabolic grin. "He will regret messing with me."
The tingly feeling in his stomach was back again. He wanted to press his face against Malfoy's well set, silky looking platinum hair, smell it... then the pale skin on his neck, move his lips against it, caress it with them, taste it... He was nearly starting to harden at the mere thought.
Damn it, Draco looked so hot in the flickering lights of the television. Harry was all too aware of the fact that this time there was no one else in the house, just the two of them, and they would be able to do anything they wanted without no one knowing or hearing. His stomach lurched at the thought. Damn but he wanted the other man.
The Slytherin glanced at him. "What do you think?" he asked with a snort, but already had a very tiny grin on his face. "I guess the second round was a little too much for me..."
Harry spent quite a long time at breakfast table with his friends, listening to Hermione and Ron debating about their Hogsmeade plans for the evening, but not taking any part in it. No, his thoughts were on different matters. From time to time his gaze kept wandering back to the Slytherin table, always finding Malfoy and Goyle missing. He couldn't help feeling worried. Why wasn't Malfoy coming to breakfast at all? He had been pretty drunk last night… but he
"Failure after failure, but finally we found him... and caught him, early on yesterday morning", Harry said. "That's the reason I couldn't come back home that night. We spent the whole night following him." Instead of sounding proud at all of his success, he only looked very sad. "I thought you knew the reason why I was so tired and stressed all the time. I felt so guilty for neglecting you because of all that stress from work. I couldn't concentrate on anything and I had to get as much sleep as I possibly could and... I didn't have the slightest idea that you didn't know the reason for my behaviour, or that you could possibly think that I'm fucking someone else behind your back."
been a terrible boyfriend. How could he even be a good one when he didn't even know what he wanted anymore?
Normally he would’ve spent the Christmas day with the Weasley family, eating Molly Weasley's delicious cooking, chatting and playing some games with the others, opening gifts and finally staying up late with Ron, Hermione and Ginny.
Draco let out a cold snort. "Hmph. If she already knows and she's fine with it, then why couldn't you tell Weasley as well?"
The other man turned his head to Harry. "Yeah", he said. "Did you come up with anything or do you need more time?"
Harry kept glancing at Malfoy, who was walking beside him. Malfoy's hair was still well set but his cheeks were slightly red because of the alcohol, and his breath was creating small, misty clouds in the chilly night air as they talked. Harry tried to concentrate on walking but he just couldn't keep his eyes off the other man.
He didn't even remember when had been the last time that Harry had told him how beautiful he was. Harry would still kiss him as he was leaving for work in the mornings, and sometimes he would take Draco in his arms when they'd watch television together, but... that wasn't enough. Harry didn't pay as much attention to him anymore as he used to. Even when Harry was at home with Draco, he wasn't there, not really. His thoughts were always somewhere else these days. Harry had slowly become more absent, more distant... and now he didn't even want to have sex with Draco either.
There was a short silence between them all, apart from all the screams and hoorays around them, before Hermione surprised them all.
Draco was still looking at the closed photo album. "I always hated watching you with her", he said quietly. "If that happens again..."
He kissed the shorter man's throat, hearing Harry's breath fasten, and unbuttoned his jeans at the same time, letting them drop to the floor as well. Now they were both only in their underpants and socks, their rock hard members pressed together. Harry's fingers were squeezing Draco's round buttocks avidly through his white silk boxers and Draco couldn't wait for what was waiting for him ahead.
"Many people have said that I look a lot like my father", he said quietly, wanting to break the long silence between them some way.
"I know that. No one has said no to sex with me before", Ginny said. She got her purple pullover on and swung her long hair irritably. "You know what I think? I think that maybe we should take a break for a while and ponder if this
Malfoy closed his mouth, still smiling. He was caressing his lower lip with his little finger and Harry trembled. He remembered Malfoy running his lips against Harry's neck in his dream. Oh Merlin...
He finally started eating, even though he still wasn't feeling hungry. He'd have to eat something or else he knew he'd feel even worse soon.
tell me that isn't true, Harry?!" Ginny snapped. Her whole body was shaking and her eyes were starting to fill with tears. She was starting to realize the ugly truth behind everything. "Tell me he is
Harry let go of Draco's hand and moved his hand up to caress his platinum hair instead, just looking at him for a long while.
He saw a tiny smile on the other man's lips as he put the watch on his left wrist, still admiring it for a while before turning to face the other man again.
The rest of Harry's Friday night was totally ruined. They spent the next three hours in the common room with Ron, later joined by Hermione, but Harry's thoughts were somewhere else. No matter how much he tried, he wasn't able to concentrate on anything.
Harry smiled, tightening his hold around his beautiful man. "I love you too, baby", he said back, inhaling the delicious scent of Draco's cologne. He was so happy that Draco was finally all his.
"I couldn't agree more", Harry said and they both smirked, tightening their grips around each other's bodies.
"Greg told me about yesterday", Malfoy finally said and Harry lowered his gaze back to his parchment. "What were you doing in front of our door?"
, Harry was already starting to suspect Theodore having just fooled him. He couldn't help feeling a little worried that Theodore might still try to take an advantage of the situation and steal Draco from him.
It didn't take more than a few seconds when Draco already felt Harry's hand find it's way to his underpants and fingers closing around his large bulge still covered in fabric. Fuck, his cock was all ready for action. He was ready for anything Harry would be willing to give to him. Anything at all.
Sex with Draco was mind-blowing. It was powerful, it was passionate, it was kinky, it was intense. Their sexual chemistry was indescribable and they couldn't get enough of each other. Draco was the only person Harry'd had sex with, but he was already certain that he would never be able to have anything similar with someone else. And he didn't even want to experience this with anyone else, only with Draco.
He turned to look at the blond in confusion, seeing a weird smile on the blond's lips as he said: "Hearing stuff like that from you, Potter... It's
However, as he finished his sentence his lips turned to a smile, and Draco's eyes lingered on them. Damn how much he loved that smile and those beautiful heart shaped lips of Harry's.
"I know", Harry said with a sigh, resting his forehead against his hand on the table. "I wasn't expecting things to go this way either, but I know it's the right decision. Sorry, Ron."
you went after leaving the club! Or else..." Harry's lips were trembling and Draco could feel his hands shaking against his shoulders as he was gripping him almost violently.
Draco, however, had not finished talking yet. "Don't baby me", he said, detaching himself from Harry and took one step backwards, crossing his arms. The Prophet dropped to the floor. Harry was watching him with a melancholy look on his face. "You took me for granted for weeks, Harry! You will never treat me like that again because of work, or anything else either.
He found that he didn't even like the adept, familiar way that Ginny kissed him with her thin lips anymore. No, he missed Malfoy's full lips, the taste of his mouth and his clearly inexperienced, frantic way of kissing Harry... He missed the way that Malfoy had bitten at his lip and looked at him deep in the eyes at the same time. Merlin, he could imagine spending hours and hours just kissing the Slytherin and he wanted to be the one to teach him to kiss better.
"Oh come on, Potter... Don't be so touchy", he heard Malfoy sigh teasingly. The next thing he knew, the man was getting up of the bed and walking towards him and soon the Slytherin was already leaning over him and his essay from his right. Harry, having finally finished writing, glanced at him.
He turned to glance at the Slytherin, recognizing a slightly melancholic look on his face though he was trying his best to hide it.
"Clubbing", he finally said, as haughtily as he possibly could. He would not show any weakness in front of Harry.
Malfoy was watching him from behind his own glass, sipping his drink. "Planning to get wasted tonight, are we, Potter?" he finally asked, a lopsided smile on his lips.
tell them that I'm going to break up with Ginny and they took it very well. Even Ron didn't seem to mind."
"So they're back to being friends", Harry blurted out after few minutes had already passed. He wasn't able to concentrate on anything else though he really had tried.
Harry could feel his cock starting to harden inside his pants and he was so grateful to be wearing a cloak to hide it. Malfoy would never know how aroused he was at the moment.
No. He did not want to think about it. But Malfoy was looking so irresistible, so tempting, so sexy… It was clear Theodore would be wanting to get into Malfoy's pants later tonight, he was already dreaming about it, Harry could see the lust in his dark eyes. Why had Malfoy even dressed up like that if he didn't want Theodore to care about him that way anymore?
There was a short silence, before finally Greg said: "Now, tell us everything, so we can help you. Start from the very beginning, okay?"
"Yeah… She doesn't seem to want to talk to me anymore", Harry said. "Sometimes I don't know if this thing between me and her is even working anymore…" He let out a sigh.
After Ginny had finally left to go to her own dormitory and it was already very late, Harry still stayed at the common room, just leaning his head against the back of the couch, staring at the ceiling and listening to the three Slytherins chattering quietly behind him. He needed to have a word with Malfoy because he had been too shocked to to do that earlier in the morning.
Harry tried to get up and grab the other man, but the Slytherin punched him hard in the face with his fist. Harry groaned in pain, falling backwards again. The pain was terrible, and with blurry eyes he saw Draco looking at him with tears flowing along his face before storming away, soon followed by Goyle who flashed a loathing glare at Harry as he went.
Harry nodded. "I know. Better than I assumed", he said as quietly as Hermione, flashing a grin at her. "Who would have thought?"
Ginny was looking at him, clearly not believing her ears. "You mean y-you... really want to... b-break up with me?" she stammered.
Draco was shaking his head in irritation, pressing his lips tightly together. How dared Harry pretend he didn't know what he was talking about!
Harry grinned. "Well, if you're going, bring me some fudge and... some chocolate wands?" he asked after pondering between different kind of treats for a while in his mind.
Malfoy was staring straight ahead, simply concentrating on walking. Harry tried to concentrate too but he just couldn't. His heart was thumping madly in his chest and all he really wanted to do right now was to grab Malfoy by his shoulders and press him against the nearest wall. He wanted to smell his skin, to kiss him hard, to rip his clothes off...
Draco was scowling at him defiantly and Harry was scowling right back at him for a while, until he grabbed the Slytherin by the shoulders and slammed him hard against the sink, kissing him roughly. Draco kissed him back just as fiercely, his hands immediately starting to rip Harry's clothes off, and Harry didn't mind. Their argument had reminded him of their earlier school years and his cock was already hard from arousal – and he could feel that the same thing had happened to Draco as well.
bad ones, so it's best for her to not be home alone right now." He sighed heavily and paused for a while. "It runs in the blood I think... the sickness", he finally continued. "You know aunt Bellatrix and how crazy
Draco cried with pleasure as Harry started pounding against his bottom rhythmically, steering the slender body against the thrusts. The Slytherin's hands and legs were wrapped around him and Harry moved one of his own hands to Draco's cock again, pumping it in the same beat.
already back to normal, like nothing had even happened between them?! He hadn't paid much attention to them earlier that day.
Harry tried to find the right words to use but he soon came to a conclusion that however he would put it, it wouldn't make Ginny take it any better. It was pointless to try and stall.
Malfoy stayed quiet for a while. "Yeah", he then finally agreed, turning around without another word. He headed towards the bedroom corridor, throwing one last quick look at him from the door, and then he was gone.
Draco kept turning in the sheets, glancing at the clock on the wall and waiting as the hours passed. Where the hell could Harry be?! Harry hadn't even informed that he would be working late that night, so Draco had no idea of Harry's location.
He was observing Malfoy way too much, he was always watching the Slytherin secretly. His eyes, his lips, his hair, his body... everything about him. He liked the Slytherins voice, he liked his weird habbits... His head was
They all turned around when the door opened and Theodore walked in, looking seriously fed up. "If you wish to talk to him, you better go now before he changes his mind", he announced tiredly.
Harry immediately turned his attention towards Malfoy who was back to staring at the flames again. "Why are you being an arse to him again?" he asked.
Hermione was quiet for a while, just thinking about what Harry had said. "Are you really telling me the truth now?" she finally ensured and Harry gave a quick nod. "Well, if that really is the case, I must say I'm… relieved", she continued slowly.
Harry took another step closer to him. "It was", he said. "But not anymore. Things have changed since then. It's not what I want to do anymore. There are much more important things in my life now."
Draco bent over him, gently caressing his neck with his lips. "Of course", he said. "Just tell me when you're ready."
Harry repeated, clearly not able to believe his ears. Draco noticed that his face was slowly turning red with anger.
His gaze travelled to the sleeping Slytherin again and his stomach tightened. He would never touch the Slytherin like that again, even though he wanted nothing more.
For the first time in their lives, Harry, Ron and Hermione were watching the Quidditch match together with Malfoy and Goyle.
They were soon rolling on the floor, trying to hit and kick each other as much as they could, groaning and cursing loudly.
After a while Harry took the head into his mouth and started sucking on it, his deep green eyes looking at Draco at the same time. Draco was groaning, his hands twisting the sheets, and
Harry startled, cheeks flushing, quickly tearing his gaze off the Slytherin. There he had been, slowly, attentively,
Like promised earlier, Draco's new shirt was already being quickly unbuttoned and soon thrown carelessly to the floor. Draco shuddered as Harry's long, skilful fingers were immediately caressing his bare upper body. Harry's hands were so warm, they were so strong and rough, they were such manly hands, and he loved the way they felt against the softness of his own skin. Just a simple touch by Harry was able to drive him crazy with lust.
Malfoy's face darkened. His good mood was now totally gone. "What?!" he snarled. "Who told you stuff like
"Honestly, I always suspected that Draco had feelings for you", Narcissa said. "He kept talking about you in the letters he sent me, during holidays... all the time. And during the war it was already clear as a day. A mother knows these things, and it broke my heart to see him suffer so much." Harry saw Draco's cheeks turn a little redder. "You've been good to our family, Harry, no matter how badly we've treated you for years. I have no doubt that you'll make my son happy."
Harry was thinking about Theodore’s words and realized that he hadn't seen Malfoy the whole day either. Okay, so he had slept until midday... but it was still weird. He wasn't worried about the Slytherin, but he was curious. He also knew how he'd find him and so he got up, going to his and Ron's bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him.
How could he have ever thought that Malfoy was an ugly, pointy-faced brat? How could he ever have hated this man so much? How could he have done such acts of violence against him, when all he wished to do right now was to kiss him... and not just in the lustful, passionate way. No, right now he wanted to touch those beautiful lips lightly with his own and feel their softness, to kiss him tenderly, to show the man how much he cared for him.
"I enjoyed what happened tonight between us", Harry finally said, having calmed down. "But it's not like this could ever lead to something permanent, right? With all our crazy history together, all that violence between us, your family, our friends, my girlfriend... There's just too many things and... it would never work anyway, right?"
"Gosh… Shut the fuck up, Potter, and just hold me", he heard Malfoy's very drunken voice hiss against his shirt, making Harry smile. Still the very same old Draco Malfoy.
They arrived to the school yard and Harry figured it would be wise to use his invisibility cloak so they wouldn't be seen wandering around the castle so late. They were now allowed to go to Hogsmeade whenever they liked – but there was still the possibility to bump into Filch and Harry was not looking forward to that.
His drunken eyes continued their journey back up on Malfoy's body. Damn, that beautiful, pale neck... He remembered how arousing it had been to suck on it in his dream, at the same time humping against that gorgeous body on his lap.
"I thought you wouldn't come", Malfoy said again and Harry immediately noticed how vulnerable he looked at the moment, his normal confidence all gone.
"I do", Draco said without any hesitation, and they both smiled at each other with tears in their eyes.
"Did you have a hangover?" he called out, allowing his towel to fall to the floor as he started pulling his underpants on.
Harry, who had been resting on his own bed, deep in his thoughts, quickly opened his eyes after hearing Hermione's voice.
naive enough to think we can just pretend like nothing ever happened between us?" He shook his head. "Friends? Hmph. More like friends with benefits."
"Be careful not to pass out though", he suddenly heard Malfoy's already quite drunken voice whispering right next to his ear and he startled, the hair on his neck rising up. He quickly opened his eyes and turned to look at his side, realizing that while he had been resting his eyes, the Slytherin had stood up and was now crouching down right next to him.
An hour later they had finally reached the King's Cross train station. Harry waited until he saw the Weasley family leaving (he didn't want Ginny to see him leaving with Malfoy), before he finally moved on. He soon saw the blond Slytherin standing at the other end of the station, dressed in his long, black winter coat. Malfoy was looking a little worried and abashed, glancing in every possible direction, searching for Harry. Harry realized that Malfoy must have seen Ron and Hermione already leaving without Harry.
"Damn I've missed this", he heard Harry saying as well and opened his eyes to find the emerald green eyes looking deep into his own as he was moving slowly inside.
Oh god... He was nothing but a vile, immoral, sickening human being. He'd have to go. He'd have to go
Harry felt his heart hammering in his chest. Damn. He had been dreaming of this for so long, but now that it was finally happening, he was feeling
horny. If they didn't have different common rooms, they would probably have ended up in bed together this time.
After flying Harry quickly showered in their dormitories. Ron and Hermione had already left to go to the library and Harry himself planned to go get some rest before dinner time. He closed the bathroom door behind him and headed towards their bedroom, bumping into Malfoy who had just closed his own door behind himself. The blond was now staring at Harry who was wearing nothing but a red towel around his waist. His slightly muscular, shower fresh body was almost fully exposed to the man standing right in front of him. The man he had just dreamt of last night.
"Blimey, Draco", he breathed and slightly opened his eyes, meeting Draco's gaze. "You're so fucking tight. Doesn't it hurt?"
"I'm nothing without you", Harry continued, pressing their foreheads together and holding the sides of the other man's neck in his hands, looking deep into his grey eyes with his own green ones. "I love
Draco, who was looking a little timid, slowly walked to the couch and sat next to Harry. They were sitting in silence for a good while. Draco's eyes were fixed on the TV screen where people were shooting towards each other with guns, dodging bullets and yelling at each other. Harry, instead, found himself looking at the Slytherin, smiling and trying to suppress a laugh because of the baffled look on his face.
Harry could see Draco's face slowly turning red. He knew that being sentimental like this in front of everyone was really hard for a man like Draco Malfoy, and that's what made Harry feel even more touched by his words.
Harry buried his face in his hands. How had this happened? He had no clue how and when it had happened, but it was clear as a day. He had fallen for Draco Malfoy.
Harry's thoughts were cut off by a familiar voice, and he instantly broke the kiss. He and Ginny were now both staring at Draco, Goyle and Theodore standing few meters away from them. Goyle was shaking his head, and Theodore's mouth was slightly open as they all stared at Harry.
"I can't believe it! Who is he and what has he done to my boyfriend?" Hermione chuckled, putting her hand over her mouth.
His thoughts always returned to Malfoy, to his gorgeously styled blond hair, the beautiful scent of his cologne and especially that sexy looking outfit on his lithe body. Just thinking about it gave him shivers. Oh Merlin, how much he wished to be the one spending the night with Malfoy. He wanted to hang out with him at the pub, get completely wasted together, snog that gorgeous man in the cold night and finally, at the end of the night, shag the hell out of him just like he had done in his dream… but no. Malfoy was with Theodore tonight, the man who had flashed Harry that obnoxius smile, sending a clear message to him: You've lost the game.
Harry didn't bother telling his best friend that he actually had a hangover because of yesterday's drinking and that he didn't feel like eating at all. He showered quickly and dressed up just as quickly, before venturing to the Great Hall to have some lunch with Ron. Harry had hoped to see Ginny there, too, but she wasn't there anymore.
Harry was running his hand through his hair nervously, already knowing for sure what was coming next. "Yeah, I was alone at first, until Malfoy came there. We-"
Harry found himself staring at the taller man, dazed. Had he heard right? Had Malfoy just... "Did you just... call me
"I didn't lie", the Slytherin said immediately. "I didn't consider myself gay when you're the only man I've ever really wanted. The only one I've ever had real feelings for."
Suddenly Harry started feeling sick in so many different ways that he couldn't even decide which feeling was the worse of them all. His stomach was aching. His throat felt like he was being strangled. The food in front of him started to make him want to throw up...
"Yes." Malfoy's grey eyes glittered as they turned to leave, side by side. Harry had a feeling that this Christmas was going to be a good one after all. He had no doubt about it anymore.
Hearing a feminine voice under him made Harry finally open his eyes. He found himself staring into his girlfriend's brown, glimmering eyes and his face fell.
Harry quickly detached himself off his girlfriend, taking a seat on the edge of the bed, back turned towards her.
Draco had lowered his gaze to the floor and Harry finally took a closer look at him. Draco's eyes were all puffy and red and it was clear that he had been crying the whole time that Harry had spent in detention with Theodore.
"Yeah, today", Malfoy said before heading to his own door. He glanced at Harry one more time before opening it. "Night, Potter."
It didn't take long before the Slytherin already cried out in pleasure, back arching as he came in between their bellies, shouting at Harry's name, once again, his whole body spasming uncontrollably.
Draco's cheeks flushed a little and, once again mesmerized by the man's beauty, Harry leaned closer and kissed the other man again. His heart felt like exploding. He loved, loved, loved the man in his arms. And Draco loved him back.
Harry smiled, shrugging. "Why not", he said, walking to the closet on the other side of the room to get some clean towels for them. He was currently searching, when he heard a hiss of pain from behind him and quickly turned around, seeing Draco getting up and grimacing in pain.
It didn't take long until they both got their orders and walked closer to Harry, taking seats right beside him. They all nodded to each others.
"Whoa. I must say I'm surprised. This is... okay", Malfoy said. He wasn't quite able to hide his disappointment for not being able to belittle him at all like he had certainly been looking forward to do. After all, the man was Draco Malfoy who still very much enjoyed tantalizing and boasting whenever he got the chance, even if he wasn't as mean as he used to be in the past.
Malfoy took a sip from his own drink, watching Harry from the corner of his eye with a bit of a haughty look on his face. Then he turned around, gaze traveling through the pub. "Where's Weasley?" he asked.
Draco shook his head and Harry wasn't surprised at all. He knew there were house-elves at the Malfoy Manor, Dobby had been one of them before Harry had set him free from their service.
Draco distantly remembered having read about the man some time earlier. Buckthorn was a dangerous psychopath who had committed numerous crimes.
"Well", he started. "In my opinion, the last thing that you should do right now is to go back home and keep on grieving because of that prick."
"Impatient, are we?" he chuckled against Harry's lips and opened his eyes slightly, finding the answer in the look in Harry's emerald eyes. They were full of desire.
From the first touch of their lips Harry knew he was hooked. He had never felt anything like this before, not with Cho, not with Ginny. No, this was how it was
It was almost 3am when Malfoy finally told Harry that he was tired. Harry himself had been tired for a while already, but he'd wanted to listen to Malfoy for as long as he wanted to talk. Besides, it was Sunday and Harry could sleep as late as he wanted to.
Soon Harry started arriving home so late that Draco had already gone to sleep, or at least he was already lying in their bed and
"I don't need your pity, Potter", Malfoy grunted right away, not looking at him. Instead, he was staring at the floor.
"STOP INTERRUPTING ME!" Harry yelled, finally jumping up too. He struck his fist against the table with force, face red. He had really blown up this time. He was so glad they were alone in the common room.
Harry sighed and stood up, hands in his jeans pockets, turning to face his friends. "I don't know. It depends on what you've heard", he said, carefully lifting his chin up.
with you?!" she hissed at him, grabbing her book from the floor. She turned around, quickly heading towards the Gryffindor girl's dormitory. "My boyfriend's a nutcase!" she snapped before disappearing to the stairs.
That silky looking platinum hair, skin as pale as the moon, his skinny body, those perfect lips waiting to be kissed…
Harry's eyes travelled down on the Slytherin's beautiful, pale, slender body that was now glimmering with sweat, the large scars covering his torso not worsening the view for him at all. Draco was perfect the way he was and he wouldn't change a thing about the man. He took a hold of the Slytherin's big erection again, squeezing it rhythmically as he kept enjoying the amazing ride that Draco was offering him and listening to his loud whining.
"I'm sorry too… for attacking you", Harry said back. "Not to mention that one time in that bathroom when I very nearly killed you. I didn't know what the spell did… If I had known…"
Suddenly he heard two familiar voices coming from the door of the place. Slowly turning around Harry first saw Goyle and...
"What is the meaning of this?! Care to explain yourselves?" Headmistress McGonagall demanded to know. She was really furious. "I've never seen anything like this, and right after starting a feast!"
He loosened Malfoy's grip around him, quickly jumping out of the bed. He made his way to the other side of the bed to get his glasses and put them on, starting to search for his pyjamas and underpants next. He was walking back to the other side of the bed when he heard the sheets rustle and trembling he glanced towards the voice.
"Would you just shut up already, Harry", Draco said with a sigh. "I haven't fucked anyone else. I slept on Greg's couch."
it then", Ron said quietly, cheeks red. He was clearly nervous about everyone staring at them. "No need to freak out like that. Besides, you're the one who told us in the first place. You're the one who's been talking about them all the time..."
Harry's face was priceless, a sudden understanding seeming to overwhelm him. He let go of Draco's arm. "Is that what this is about? Is that what you think I was doing that night?!" he breathed. "Merlin, Draco... When was the last time you read the Daily Prophet?!"
In the first picture Harry was holding Ginny close to him and pressing a kiss to her lips. After the kiss they first looked at each other and then at the camera with blissful smiles on their lips.
And believe it or not, they really did talk that night, even though at first the conversation was very, very uneasy. In the end, they ended up talking for hours.
When Harry arrived home an hour later, he was feeling a little relieved. Though he hadn't confessed to Ron yet, it warmed his heart to know that Hermione already knew about him and Draco, and wasn't disgusted by it. When they had separated in front of the café, Hermione had given him a quick hug, whispering to his ear: "I'm happy for you, Harry. I hope he's the one to make you happy." After that she had given him a gentle smile before walking away with Ron.
Harry wasn't surprised. After all, it had taken over a month before his best friend had approved of his and Draco's relationship a year ago, and he still wasn't happy about it. Harry himself, however, couldn't possibly have been any happier.
Draco realized how much he had really missed kissing Harry and holding him close. To even think about losing Harry to someone else... No. He didn't want to think about that anymore. That would
"...See? This one here... What does it say? Doesn't make any sense to me", Malfoy continued, pointing at the middle left corner of the parchment.
He finally started wrapping up his parchment and Malfoy pulled away from him. Harry closed his Potions book, stood up and pushed the chair under the desk, turning towards the other man who was still standing there, very close to him. "Should we -", Harry started, moving his hand through his hair. His sentence was cut off because when he lifted his gaze, he found Malfoy looking straight at him with an unrecognizable expression on his face, and the next thing he knew was that his emerald green eyes had – once again – locked with Malfoy's grey ones.
Harry's eyes travelled to the wall where the Black family's old picture had been replaced by a large picture of him and Draco.
Just thinking about the possibility of Harry being in love with someone else, making love to some other man or woman instead of him... Draco's heart felt like being ripped out of his chest at the thought. He loved Harry so much that it hurt, but Harry clearly didn't feel the same way towards him.
Ginny walked through the hall and took a seat next to Harry, kissing his cheek. "Good morning", she said happily.
Harry was panting and so was Theodore. Their faces were dripping with blood as they were staring at the Headmistress.
Harry gazed at the blond who was still staring at the lake with no emotion whatsoever showing on his pale face.
”I’m not as stupid as you think, Harry”, Ron said, flashing a grin. ”You’re thinking about my sister."
someone else to do those things to him. Someone who just wasn't there with them at the moment. Come to think of it, why
"With you", Harry cut him off, a gentle smile rising to his lips. "I thought I already made it obvious enough, but I'll say it one more time." The Slytherin raised his gaze again to look at him in the eyes. "You're the only one I want, Draco. I don't want anyone else but you."
Harry was relieved of course, but he also noticed the bitter tone in the Slytherin's last sentence and immediately felt a stab of remorse in his chest.
Harry swallowed hard. Ginny wanted to have sex with him. He remembered dreaming about sleeping with Ginny – a long time ago. He had wanted nothing as much as to finally feel her girlfriend's naked body against his own, wanted her to show the unexperienced Harry all the tricks she knew... but now... just thinking about it suddenly felt very weird and almost… gross.
Malfoy's eyes opened slightly, revealing the huge mental pain he was suffering at the moment when he was staring into the distance, hollow eyed. No words were needed. Those eyes… The man was
Malfoy offering Harry his help came as a surprise to him. It really seemed like they were friends now and the realization made his lips turn to a tiny smile. "Nah... No need to", he finally muttered without turning around, still writing. "I can manage on my own, but thanks anyway..."
Harry soon flew down, landing softly on the soft grass and jumped off his broom, panting. Malfoy followed him soon after, squeezing the Snitch in his hand and swaying it at him in the air, wearing a wide grin on his face.
"He did", Malfoy said gravely. "He managed to prevent me from bleeding to death but there wasn't a way to completely erase the marks of the curse. Only my face was spared. The curse was... it was too powerful." His voice faded.
They shared another long, stupendous kiss and Harry was feeling very confused. It was still very difficult for him to believe what he had just heard. He was inexperienced and Malfoy had just told him he hadn't done anything sexual with anybody else before either, which meant that they had both just had their first sexual experiences...
The Slytherin let out a heavy, frustrated sigh. "Damn my mum", he cursed. "Did she really have to bring it up already..?"
"Let's pretend I never opened that one, okay?" Harry said, seeking for a smile. He hated seeing Draco sad.
"Y-yeah", Harry said quietly. He was suddenly feeling very stupid to be standing there, in Draco Malfoy's bedroom, in the middle of the night.
The only thing that bothered him was that he had never slept with anyone else before. He was so inexperienced and he knew very little about sex between two men. He knew something about sex with girls but this... this was a very different case. He was afraid of making a total fool out of himself in front of Draco. Or even worse: hurting him. He did not want to cause any pain to the man he had learned to care about so much. Draco had already suffered enough because of him.
"Would you like me to stay here for the night?" Ginny asked again, this time touching Harry's thigh.
Harry nodded. "We've become closer than before and he has told me things I didn't know. Like you already know, he can't sleep well. He's still having nightmares about the war. Also, people here are treating him like shit because he joined the Death Eaters. They are calling him names and…" He paused. "So… yes. I am a little worried about him. Also, he doesn't have many real friends to talk to, so I've even offered him my friendship." Another short pause. "I'm not obsessed with him. I'm just being friendly."
Harry frowned. "That's not true", he said stubbornly, folding his arms across his chest. "I just had a bad day, it had nothing to do with her. I do want to be with her."
They spent an hour at the hospital, discussing school, their relationship, and of course Narcissa's health. Harry and Draco were glad to hear that Draco's mum was already doing a lot better and she would be ready to return home soon.
Harry shook his head. "No one's been laughing at you! I would never laugh at you! I care about you!"
one very quickly", the Slytherin said, before adding icily: "I can't stand the idea of seeing her hands on you ever again."
When Harry reached the Quidditch Pitch later that morning, Malfoy was already waiting for him there, leaning on his broomstick.
"You don't have any house-elves?" he asked when Harry was leaving to buy some food from a convenience store the evening they arrived.
Ron hissed. "You don't have to believe me, but I really, really did hear something last night! I know what I heard!"
He laid back down again, moaning, twisting and turning on the sheets as the Slytherin was offering him the sweetest and kinkiest experience of his life ever. Draco was working on him so well that it was hard to believe that he didn't have any prior experience in this kind of stuff.
. The blond kept falling on the ice all the time, cursing loudly, and in the end the other man got so frustrated and angry that he yanked the skates off his feet and slammed them violently to the ground, storming away. Harry, not knowing whether to laugh or not, followed the Slytherin, telling him that it wasn't so serious and he should try to take it with humour. From the glare the other man gave him, he knew that ice-skating would definitely not be their shared hobby in the future.
The match was very even but finally, almost two hours later, Gryffindor caught the Snitch and beat Ravenclaw. Hermione and Ron were screaming so loudly that Harry was almost certain he might become deaf. Malfoy, instead, was still complaining and rolling his eyes, but Harry saw a tiny smile appear on his lips as their eyes met.
"Umm... No offence, Malfoy, but you're not always the most serene person either", Harry quickly interrupted him, but Malfoy didn't pay any attention to it.
Draco flipped over to the next page where there was a long story about the man, and a picture of the Aurors who had been working on the case. Harry was one of them. He was smiling, looking very sexy in his black Auror's suit.
Ginny wanted to snuggle with him on the couch and all Harry could think about was who he had been snuggling with last night and how different everything had felt then. Ginny's girly, hourglass shaped body and her breasts pressed against his own body didn't feel right anymore. Instead he rather preferred the feeling of Malfoy's masculine but skinny body with no breasts, all sharp angles and lean muscles, pressed against him.
Harry became even more absent and quiet. He hardly smiled or laughed anymore, mostly he was angry or looked really tired or sad. His work days became even longer and longer, he went to sleep earlier, and he showed even less interest in being close to Draco as well.
Harry rolled next to Draco and soon they were lying in each others arms, all sweaty, both breathing shakily and their bodies shuddering, their fingers entwined tightly.
. Every time he saw the blond Slytherin walking past him he remembered how his body had felt pressed against his. Every time Malfoy looked at him he remembered how his grey eyes had been filled with lust and something else that night. And when Malfoy was talking to him or laughing with his Slytherin friends, Harry remembered very clearly what kind of things those lips had been whispering to him that time. All the memories were enough to make him come almost every night by his own hand.
"No need to worry. I’ve already gotten used to it, you know, so there’s no need to feel embarrassed about it. It was weird at first but I don’t mind at all.” He gave Harry a supportive smile. ”I’m happy that you two got back together after the war.”
"I am not playing any games with you!" Harry snapped back at him. "I don't know who has been telling you stuff like that but that's utter shit! I would NEVER cheat on you, never! You know that!"
The Slytherin chuckled too and pulled him into another long kiss. They stood there embracing and kissing each other for a while before they finally apparated back to 12 Grimmauld Place again, where they spent the rest of the night watching some television, cuddling, kissing and – once again – making love, in the end falling asleep in each other's arms.
Draco gasped as Harry's finger entered and started to move inside him and Harry felt amazed. The Slytherin felt so damn tight around his finger that he was pretty sure he would end up hurting him tonight after all, even if he did go very slow. He would just have to do his best.
"Well, there's two of us loners then", Harry said. "I don't have a family at all, and now I can't go to the Burrow either, so..."
In the front page there was a large picture of a very creepy looking wizard with dirty blond hair and hollowed cheeks, and above the picture was a headline written with large font:
"Well, I figured that since we're going to spend the Christmas together at your place, perhaps it’s time for us to finally be on first-name basis as well..."
"I don't know if I even want to say it", Ron said. He wasn't able to look at Harry in the eyes anymore. Instead he was now staring at the floor, looking disgusted. His normally reddish face looked almost as pale as Draco's.
"Draco, you are amazing", Harry whispered roughly against the skin of the Slytherin's neck. He was slamming his hips faster and faster against the other man's bottom, sinking deep inside him, his right hand rubbing the blond's cock at the same time.
Harry gave a short laugh. He was the one who had chosen the songs for them to dance at the wedding so Draco really had no idea what to expect.
Harry spent most of Monday afternoon and evening in the library with his friends because they had received tons of homework, and when they finally returned to their common room after dinner, Harry was exhausted. They all went to sit in the corner, Harry's eyes circling around the room. Pansy and Blaise were lounging on the couch, Dean, Neville and Seamus were sitting across from them... However, one particular pair quickly caught his full attention.
He was browsing through the different TV channels but didn't find anything interesting to watch so he ended up with some action movie. It wasn't his style of choice but since there wasn't anything better either, he had to settle for it.
Harry could still clearly remember his dream from that same night too. The dream where he had been laying naked in bed with Malfoy, kissing him, holding him in his arms… screwing him… Oh lord.
Ron was looking at him with a blank face. "So, does that mean... you want to... break up with her?" he asked slowly.
"Congratulations", Harry heard Hermione say to Draco as well, before he himself was already hugged by George Weasley next.
A short silence fell over until he could hear Draco mumbling almost inaudibly: "I... kinda like their colour."
Harry's heart was overflowing with love. He couldn't believe it. They were finally married. He had married Draco Malfoy.
"How would you feel about it...", he started, hesitating, gaining a questioning look from the Slytherin next to him. "… you know, what your mum was talking about before we left?"
"Don't bother trying that shit with me! You just made your choice!" Draco hissed back, not listening to him.
" Harry heard Ron gasping before he closed the door after himself and instantly headed towards Draco's door. He was already about to knock when he heard Theodore speaking again and turned to glance at him.
Malfoy answered by moaning loudly, lifting his hips up against Harry's. Malfoy's hands were now working on his lower back, desperately trying to get rid off his pyjamas and underpants. The next thing Harry knew was that his rock hard member was already free and immediately grasped by the Slytherin's hand, making him gasp. Malfoy's long, thin fingers were firmly moving on his throbbing cock and he felt like he was losing his mind
I kept hoping. Then you started dating Chang. Hmph. I was glad it didn't work out between the two of you, but then you fell for the Weasley girl instead and you two became a couple", Draco continued bitterly. "I tried to date Pansy myself but I had no real interest in her, so it didn't lead to anything."
Silence fell over them for a while, each of them just sipping their drinks and listening to the other customers chatting. Then Malfoy and Goyle started to discuss something that had to do with Goyle's family.
"I don't know. I guess I just like to cook the muggle way", Harry had answered with a shrug. "It's nice."
"Oh... yeah", Harry replied. "Draco took me to this nice clothing shop. It was time I renewed my wardrobe a bit, don't you agree?"
"I don't know. Let's talk about it later", he answered. He wasn’t in a mood to discuss that any further right now.
When he was stroking his girlfriend's fire-red hair, he suddenly realized how thick and coarse it felt against his fingers. It was nothing close to Malfoy's silky and so light platinum hair – that also smelled so good.
There were several seconds of deep silence in the hallway, only broken by Draco's crying, before a very loud crash from the doorway. Draco and Greg both jumped, turning towards Theo and Blaise.
"What?! What the hell is happening here?!" was all that she managed to say. Her eyes were travelling around at everyone around them, trying to find an explanation that didn't come.
"Is that what this is about?!" he finally asked. "Draco, I... I don't know what you are talking about, but... I swear that I have
as parents though? What kind of parents would the two of us even be?" Draco still wondered, shaking his head.
wanted to do those things. The alcohol in his blood had only made it worse, but it had not been the only reason for it.
"Malfoy... Are you and Theodore...", he started after a few minutes of silence, not looking at the other man. The thought was still bothering him somehow.
As the Christmas break came closer to an end, Harry and Draco visited Narcissa Malfoy together in the hospital. Narcissa was confused to see Harry Potter arriving with her son, and without any hesitation Draco told his mum about how things really were between him and Harry.
Ginny had always had such a fiery, temperamental nature. That was probably one of the biggest reasons Harry had fallen in love with her in the first place. There had been so much passion between them straight from the beginning of their relationship – even though they hadn’t actually even had sex yet. Then again, Harry himself was a fiery person too so there was a downside: their arguments often became very nasty.
Harry immediately felt a twinge of jealousy. This time he recognized it for what it was. Instead of him, Malfoy was going out with Theodore tonight. The man who they both knew was crazy for him… Harry did not like that. He didn't like that at all.
But Harry couldn't lie anymore. "It is true", he admitted. "Draco's the one I was talking about... I'm... I'm in love with him."
"In love. With HIM?!" Ron hissed. "I know we've become closer with him but that's just... just... What the hell, Harry?! Think of all he's done to you, to
Harry flashed a tiny smile to the other man. "I would do it all again any time", he said softly, moving his hand to caress the silky platinum hair with his fingers.
He felt Harry grin against his skin and tighten his grip around him even more, and the next thing he knew, Harry had already apparated them to their bedroom and they were finally kissing, so hard that they were almost suffocating each other.
Harry's gaze followed as Malfoy, who was still breathing very heavily, slowly rose to sit down on the bed, took his wand from the night stand and started muttering the cleaning spell, pointing first at his palm and next at each of their bellies. Having soon cleaned everything up, the Slytherin quickly put his wand back, falling back to bed right next to Harry.
"Yes", Ginny sneered. "I honestly don't give a damn about how people treat him. He's done too many horrible things in past to make me care one bit!"
you were when opposing him!" Harry's lips curved to a confused smile, his cheeks blushing. "Not to forget the fact that you saved me and my mom from Azkaban afterwards. All that stuff made me want you even more", Draco finished, starting to roll Harry's hair around his finger again.
"Well if that's the case, you can always visit during the break if you want to?" Harry suggested, shrugging his shoulders. "Or we can meet somewhere for a coffee or something."
you", Harry said. He let go of Malfoy's hair, his cheeks starting to heat up. "And even if I had, it would have nothing to do with her. I do care about her."
"Yeah", Greg agreed, an apologetic look on his face. "He is an idiot, Draco, and you deserve someone much better than him."
Malfoy and Goyle were looking at each other now, exchanging words so quietly that Harry couldn't hear a word they were saying. Finally, after a while, Malfoy turned towards them.
Harry gave Malfoy an irritated look. He could still remember that day very clearly. It had been their fifth year when Malfoy had disparaged both Molly and Harry's mom after Slytherin had lost to Gryffindor, and something in Harry's head had snapped completely and then he had attacked Malfoy and beaten him up with George. In the end Malfoy had been all bloody and Harry and the twins had been banned from the Quidditch team for the rest of the school year.
It was late Wednesday evening and Harry was studying in the Gryffindor's common room with his girlfriend again. Ginny, who was currently studying the most dangerous magical plants, lowered her Herbology book, glancing at him.
Harry frowned, realizing what he had just thought. Okay, what the hell? Did he just think of Malfoy as attractive?
Harry groaned in disappointment and was about to object again but was immediately silenced by another rough kiss from the other man.
he wished to confide himself to his best friend, there had to be some kind of conference going at his flat?
Harry was staring at Malfoy's diverging back for a while, feeling bad for believing Ron's story just like that. Hermione had been right about Malfoy having nightmares all along. Damn it...
They came against each other almost at the same time, both crying of pleasure, cum mixing in between Malfoy's tight grip and their bellies. The Slytherin's now powerless body landed heavily on top of Harry's, his face buried against Harry's neck. They were just lying there for a while, bodies glimmering with sweat, before finally Malfoy rolled next to him.
No. No one would know about last night. He'd have to make it very clear to Malfoy. Of course he didn't want to believe that Malfoy would go around telling people about it, because Malfoy wanted to protect
Draco's mouth felt so warm in the chilly night and his hands were wrapped tightly around Harry's waist, his own hands being locked around the Slytherin's neck. He could feel the beating of Draco's heart against his chest and hear him moan to his mouth as he deepened the kiss, pulling the other man as close as he could.
