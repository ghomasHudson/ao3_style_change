The next blows were delivered across his back, as well as his buttocks. Harry was freely releasing screams of agony, now.
I have decided to commit this weekend to you, fully, to see how we work. If it works, then in the future, we can play often. Being my sub means if I want to lick your hole in the morning without having to slap you around, I expect to be able to do so, without a fight. I expect a certain level of respect and obedience, even out of play. Do you understand?”
Harry’s cock steadily rose at his words and he tried to adjust to hide it, but his lounge pants were thin.
When he got to the bedroom, he realized it was empty, but the shower was going, so he decided to pour himself a drink and wait for Blaise to come out. He sat in a chair, tucked in a dark corner of Blaise’s bedroom.
Absolutely not. This charade had to end. There was no way Draco would play house with this dangerous man for a single second longer. Draco shook his head, but Harry couldn’t see, as they were both invisible.
“I’m sorry Draco. You’re lying here, naked, next to me, with your perfect porcelain ass out. I can’t help it. I’m only human. May I?”
He needed his wand to shave and dry his hair. Peeking out of his bathroom door, he was relieved to find it empty. Harry must have returned to his room to get dressed.
He merely flipped him over onto his back, and drilled into him from above, holding one leg open. Harry stared into his eyes with permeating power, and he could hardly stand it. He abruptly flipped him over, forcing him up on all fours, and began ramming him from behind. Their thighs smacked loudly together as he increased his pressure and pace. He leaned over to grab him by his hair, forcing his head back, as he delivered brutal deep thrusts.
As soon as the door was open, and he stepped outside the office, his face morphed from a dizzying sexual grin to one of pure loathing.
Spurred on by this new sexual commanding drawl of Draco’s, Harry quickly corrected his posture. His cock was fully erect, pointing straight out.
Suddenly, someone pulled Blaise by the back of his shirt and decked him in the face, without warning. Draco heard a sickening crunch right before Blaise fell to the ground. Blood burst from his nose and covered his face.
He needed a grand gesture to smooth this transition and make Harry understand how much he appreciated him. He thought of Harry’s plans to spend time with Albus that day and made a split-second decision.
Harry was having a private lunch with the handsome junior Auror Smith. The junior auror looked extremely nervous to see Draco standing there. He knew he was giving off waves of his Dominant power. He looked menacing.
“Oh, by the way, I managed to get my hands on a muggle motor powered skateboard for Scorpius. Ever since I told him about a muggle skateboard that moves on its on, he’s been badgering me to get him one. It’s at the house. Do you want to pick it up?”
“It’s hardly my job to keep track of the Savior, Weasel. I expect he’s in the loo, preparing for his next interview with
Hermione continues, “Yeah, you were awake but you had that good death rattle breathing going, sort of looking around with glazed eyes from the sedative potions. And Harry was loving on you.”
Draco was dumbfounded. Harry wanted to leave him, just as he had suspected. His worst fear about the last few days had been realized. Draco did not let the crushing disappointment show. He channeled it into anger, instead.
They sat in silence staring at the warehouse. Blaise’s voice echoed in Draco’s mind. He felt awful. He did not expect it to go that badly and couldn’t think how to make it up to him, as sex was off the table now. The worst of it was his accusations about Harry, which echoed in his mind.
“Don’t say such nonsense. You’ve been a wonderful husband and father, all your life. Please, darling. I’ll do anything to make you retract the divorce. What can I do?”
When he got close, Scorpius clutched his mom around the waist and turned her body forward, facing Draco, to avoid detection. He was giggling loudly but covered his mouth to stifle the sound. Astoria smiled widely revealing a pristine smile.
The following weekend, Draco found he was left to his own devices. Astoria had Scorpius and Harry was with his kids at Grimmauld Place. Draco didn’t mind the alone time. He needed time to think and get some shopping done. Harry hated going shopping with him which made him almost miss his shopping partner.
He loved the selfish git with every fibre of his being and Draco had no idea. He was often at a loss for what to do. Cutting off the sex seemed to be an impossible choice, and he certainly couldn’t tell Draco, for fear he would never see him again.
Harry was already there, as per usual, and shirtless, again. Draco’s annoyance was heightened as he had spent an inordinate amount of time with him today, and his nerves were fried. He couldn’t keep quiet tonight.
“That confirms my suspicion. Mr. Potter, you have Lycanthropy Syndrome. Some of the poison leached into your blood stream, from the claws. It’s rare, but it can sometimes happen. It’s nothing to worry about. It is nothing like a real werewolf bite.
Eventually, Harry started talking about the case, but Draco was barely paying attention. He knew he would have a copy waiting on his desk, when he returned.
“Monsieur Malfoy. Always so excited,” he teased. Draco drew in a breath when Harry’s warm calloused hand caressed his cock through his briefs.
Draco was slow to reply. He wanted so badly to tell Blaise what was going on. If they had maintained a normal friendship, it would be nothing to tell him. As it is, Draco’s selfishness had driven him to this point.
“I know what you mean. Ginny and I got married straight out of Hogwarts. I never even stopped to think what I want. Now that we’re separated, I finally can. I think about what I want all the time now.”
Draco started the fire with his wand and reviewed the case file. When Harry finished unpacking, he moved to sit next to him on the tiny couch to do the same. His scent was infiltrating Draco's nostrils, now. Memories from their trip to Turkey became sharp in his mind. He couldn’t stand being alone in the cabin so close to him, for a single second longer.
“Don’t be an idiot, Potter. This Is completely conspicuous. We’ll just apparate and disillusion ourselves like we always do.”
It’s a fuckfest that night. Right until the early morning hours, when they fall asleep naked and sated, cum staining the sheets. Draco’s head in his lap, and Harry’s arms draped over his chest.
His tone was very soft and dangerous. Draco reminded himself that Blaise was sorted into Slytherin, for a reason, and not to trifle with him, or this could be very dangerous for him. He decided, at least, to stop denying it was him.
Draco immediately springs to action. He straddles Harry, caressing his buttocks then leans down to prepare his hole with his tongue and fingers. Harry smacks his head away.
“I hurt you. Always…have.” Harry wants to say—how he’s sorry—but he’s so tired. Everything makes him tired. He drags his eyelids open. Takes a deep breath.
Blaise sighed, already half-knowing the answer. His erection subsided completely at his reply. He often had to sit through Draco complaining about Harry and wondered at the man sitting next to him.
Harry sits down at the small wooden table in the kitchen, raising his eyebrows because Draco’s never made anything before. He props one arm on the table, resting his cheek on a clenched hand, as Draco makes sandwiches with what he’s got in the fridge.
His wand was upstairs but he preferred using his hands anyway. There was something far more satisfying about flesh giving way under his fist. He immediately threw a punch, which Harry dodged.
A pile of condoms glistened in glass in front of her like an obscene candy bowl.  Draco had an idea of what they were used for but found the idea of putting synthetic muggle plastic on top of his dick distasteful. He thanked merlin he did not have to live like that, as he was a wizard and could simply cast protective charms wandlessly not that he would need them tonight.
The snowstorm raged outside. There was a gentle knocking against the side of the cabin from wayward trees.
Harry hadn’t tried anything untoward with Draco since that night in the locker room. He avoided the gym, opting for his house gym instead. They fell back into their tense work flow. They still snarled at each other, but Harry seemed more jolly than usual.
and then Draco came, completely untouched, as Harry leaned down to kiss him. The sound of him begging him, needing him, was just too much.  He moaned into his mouth through his orgasm, and felt a spasm of heat flood the inside of his hole, as he pulled Harry over the edge with him. Harry nearly screamed out a groan as he came, shaking.
Draco was in a foul mood at work the next day. He was very angry with Blaise, and he could not even confront him about it.
“Lunch at my house in Islington at 12pm. The address is #12 Grimmauld Place. London. Meet you there.”
“Don’t call me that,” he meant to say it hatefully but his voice was soft and broken. Only Blaise was allowed to call him Drake. He was suddenly feeling very protective over him. Blaise has never, in twenty years, made him feel this way. He forgot him for a moment, during his mental breakdown, but he remembered now. Blaise would be the only one to truly mourn him after he was gone.
“Hey, that’s my toy. You can’t keep it away from me. I’ve been too long without it,” Draco said playfully.
He moved in to kiss Draco, but at the mention of his wife, Draco held him back, remembering all the things Blaise said.
“Oh, yes, sir,” Harry said in his soft voice, surprised he had forgotten. He clasped his hands behind him, resting them above his flaming ass.
Draco could have picked someone for her. Draco would have even forced himself to make love to her, before she went out and disgraced him.
Instead, he stood and stormed out of the parlor, up the stairs to retire for bed. Blaise was onto something when he said it wasn’t good that he had no friends. Having never felt so alone, he missed his best mate, his ex-wife, his son, his mother, and even his father. All his emotions were turned inward with no hope of release. He felt that the planet was tipping over its axis. Lovers became enemies. Enemies became lovers.
Draco had to figure out a way out of this, and fast. There’s no way he was getting roped into a picnic with
Draco wanted to correct him by pointing out it was actually he, who deposited his cum in Blaise, but thought that wouldn’t help matters.
“I see. I’m not surprised you don’t want to trade him. He is stunning, too. Tell me, is every part of him as gorgeous as what shows? Is he beautiful in his submission?”
“That was before last night, Harry…I’m so sorry. I’ll never touch you again. I’m disgusting. I deserve to go to Azkaban for that. People are in there, for less.”
Draco turned his head to the side, gritting his teeth at the sharp sting and the long awaited feeling of fullness. He had forgotten how big Harry’s cock was, bigger than his, to be sure. It felt enormous inside. Harry paused letting him adjust and buried his face in his neck, kissing and sucking to distract Draco from the burn of the initial entrance.
As he took a shower, he prayed to Merlin there would soon be a resolution to the hell he found himself in. He almost wished Harry would break up with him. He knew it would hurt, but nothing could hurt more than this. Having him so near and acting so hatefully was worse than not having him at all. Or so he imagined.
“Harry, being with you is already better than anything I’ve ever had. Let’s revisit this topic another day. I’m exhausted tonight.” He kissed him, for reassurance.
Blaise stood at the head of the crowd. They locked eyes. His arms were crossed, and he gave Draco a look of unmitigated loathing. Draco knew he went to the press because he had lied to him about Harry. He caught them in the gym showers together the same day he had fucked Blaise in the morning.
Blaise pointed to a picture on the far left corner of the paper that Draco didn’t notice before. It was significantly smaller than the main picture. It showed Harry with Ginny at the park. They were laughing together. Ginny’s arms were wrapped around his shoulders. As they laughed,
He thrust his index finger inside gently. Harry relaxed enough to allow a second finger, then a third.
“Are you tired?” Harry’s eyes on him are slightly wide, as if Draco’s being tired three days after being cut loose by St. Mungo’s represents a real emergency.
Draco thought, but this time, there was a certain fondness for the man as he watched him work. In truth, Draco had always admired Harry as an auror, which is why he liked working with him. He may charge in with a brash recklessness that was going to get him killed one day, to be sure, but his power was unparalleled. His magic had strengthened exponentially in the last ten years or so. Draco was always a little jealous of his abilities, which is why he worked so hard, training endlessly, to keep up with him, but he would never be his equal.
“Papa! You’re home early from your work trip. Thank Merlin. Mother’s been so sad without you. We were shopping today and she burst into tears when she saw your favorite candy at Honeydukes.”
After the interview came out, most of their coworkers fell back into a normal work groove. Many came up to congratulate them on their courage to come out together and informed them that they suspected it, all along. Apparently, their secret affair was not as much of a secret as they thought it was.
“Look, someone’s going in.” Draco thanked God, circe and every deity he could think of that he finally had an excuse to cut the conversation short.
At that, Harry gave his cock a harsh squeeze underneath the desk, and Draco tensed in his chair but tried, his best, to hide it. He pretended to readjust.
He didn’t know what to do about Harry. He did not want him to feel pity towards Draco. Draco’s cock stirred remembering all the many ways they had made love yesterday. It was all so beautiful, until the very end. Only their last encounter was disagreeable to him, but he couldn’t be blamed. It was the poison.
Hermione rolled her eyes speaking to Draco. “It had been mentioned in the morning. No one wanted to field Harry’s questions about how it would go. Or if they didn’t wake you up that day after all, I think they thought Harry would be threatening the hospital's donation from the ministry.”
Meanwhile, Harry was moaning in pleasure beneath him and began to push back to meet his thrusts. The sound of flesh slapping flesh filled the air. He was getting close.
When Draco arrived home that night, the first thing he did was owl the auror secretary informing her that he would not be coming into work tomorrow. He had never, once, in over ten years, taken an impromptu day off work, but there was no way he would be able to function in this state.
Hermione shook her head and got up to leave. Before she reached the floo, she turned around to face him.
The head of Harry’s cock slowly breached his entrance. He gasped at the sting and jerked forward, involuntarily, but Harry held his hips firmly and pulled him backwards onto his cock. Draco's resistance made him overzealous and resulted in entering him fully, in one thrust. Harry moaned when he was fully seated and paused, whispering breathlessly into his ear.
Draco felt his heart rate sky rocket and his face flush. His fight or flight response kicked into full gear. He didn’t know what to do, except for force a calm exterior. He should probably sit down, before he exploded out of his skin.
Yet, he had lived without love his entire life; he could do so again. As long as he had Scorpius’ love, it should be fine. Perhaps he would not be as happy in his personal life, but that was nothing new. He had lived most of his life in this manner. It was a small price to pay for peace of mind.
in France because now, only half his fantasies starred Blaise. Yet, that half, featuring Blaise’s body tied and bent over, still haunted him.
, for nothing. He never used that card to get out of trouble, but for Blaise, he’d happily make an exception.
When Draco first married Astoria, he went years without a sexual relationship with Blaise, hoping that he would remain faithful to his wife and be content with Astoria. He failed at that, eventually, but that took two years to do. He imagined Blaise would do the same.
“As I was not born yesterday, I’ve been able to surmise, on my own, that you two have been involved since that picture in the Profit came out. Harry’s attack against unspeakable Zabini only confirmed my suspicions. I only wish the public never caught wind of it, but I am prepared for the backlash. It is none of my concern what you two do in your personal lives as long as your work remains impeccable. I’m not losing you over silly personal matters. I only summoned you here to offer my support during this difficult time. I am prepared to defend you both, to the media or the Wizengamot, should the occasion arise.”
He went to embrace him into a man hug, but Blaise moved towards his mouth instead, kissing Draco full on the lips.
Draco did, locking with his blow pupils, and he felt Harry’s cum instantly splash in his mouth. He swallowed it all down.
Sleep wouldn’t come that night. His failure with Blaise was burning all his nerve endings. He worried he would never be able to have sex again. ‘Pathetic’, he thought to himself. ‘You’re an old, pathetic, miserable loser who can’t even get it up.’
It was his name uttered from Harry’s lips that brought him back. He pushed forward and entered him in one smooth stroke.
Amongst the muggles, it wasn’t uncommon for a sub to be a politician or a company head. Draco had once played out a scene with a muggle who told him he was the chief of police, the muggle equivalent of Harry’s job, and that had been a particularly memorable experience. The man was a perfect submissive, falling to his knees before Draco had to ask.
Draco gets up to retrieve some breakfast that Neech has left for them in the kitchen. When he gets back, Harry pulls him into a bone crushing hug again.
Time in his room passes at a glacial pace. Everything about Harry siren calls him. Even his bare shoulders and unwashed hair beg for his fingers.
He looked down at their table. The case file lay neglected and closed at the opposite edge of where they were sitting, closest to Zabini.
He made sure to allow at least one week to pass before jumping into bed with him, both to maintain distance and allow Blaise to fully recuperate. Blaise had to be sore from yesterday morning in Rome, and the waters were murky enough as it is.
“Just stop this madness! Since when am I not enough for you? Since when are we not enough together? I chose you! It wasn’t even a choice for me. Don’t you understand that? We’ve gone through hell together and just came out the other side. We’ve both been perfectly content for six months. Why are you ruining this? Is this going to break us?”
It shocked him, and he stumbled forward to inspect, bumping into a kitchen stool in the process. Harry startled at the noise and turned around.
“Draco, I need to know if you still have feelings for Blaise. Last time I asked, you said you had more than friendly feelings for him, is that still true?”
It’s my job to give you pleasure. That’s what truly brings me pleasure. That’s how it always was with...”
charm on him, for as long as possible. Maybe then, he would feel a small part of the madness he felt, from within.
“You’ve been fucking around with Blaise since 5th year till now and you call it ‘casual’? Sounds like a lot more than that to me.”
“I apologize for raising my voice. You should know that Scorpius is the nearest thing to my heart. No one will take him away from me.”
Harry, on the other hand, could go nowhere with his family without having to stop for a photograph or an autograph. Love poured out for him from every corner, even now, fifteen years later.
“You know, the stables were about to collapse but I sent some magic to hold it up. I don’t know how long it’ll last,” he says with smile in his voice.
Harry shrank in the shadows as a couple passed by, their attention drawn by the glittering leash that was still in Draco’s hand.
He sucked on his cock leisurely, taking his time. The point was for Harry to enjoy this, for as long as possible, not quickly reach orgasm.
Draco was still paralyzed, it seemed. So Harry took his hand to direct him out of the shower and began to dry him with another towel, tying it around his waist.
He decided to go home early that day, to regroup. Harry was going to have dinner with his children, then meet him at the manor, later that same night, intending to stay the entire weekend.
Fucking him was always something that he had fantasized about for many years. Harry had no idea how many times he had stared in Draco’s daydreams. It seemed unjust for Draco to finally realize his dream, after behaving so despicably. It was so hard to not act on Harry’s begging, but he didn’t feel right about it.
“I’m going to ruin you,” he wants Draco to understand. “I’m going to leave you wet, full of cum, weak.”
“This is over, Potter. I can’t believe I have to tell you that. You think I’m going to give you a free pass on this? You’re completely mental. I’m leaving.”
Draco opted for all black tonight, a fitted black button down and black trousers with black shoes. He left two buttons undone, exposing the inner part of his pale clavicles. He looked regal and foreboding. He knew fashion, and undoubtedly, black always looks best on blondes.
Draco rose from the bed, naked, and came up behind Blaise on the balcony, wrapping his arms around him affectionately, pressing closely to his body.
unless it was to dip his head lower to kiss him, swirling his tongue in his mouth. He made Draco release his knees so that he could hold both his hands down on the mattress besides his head. The pleasure was building to unbearable heights. Harry was hitting his prostate more frequently as his pace increased. Draco looked over at their connected hands, remembering the first time Harry made love to him in that abandoned cabin, on that snowy mountain. He felt all his blood rush to his cock at that intimate memory, and Harry turned his face back towards him to meet his gaze. As soon as he locked eyes with him again, he came, untouched all over his belly. This triggered Harry’s own orgasm and he came while kissing him, releasing a loud groan into his mouth.
Once, he had presented her with a luscious red apple he picked from the garden because it was shaped like a heart. She screeched in delight as if he had lassoed the moon for her.
When he closed the door behind him, he heard it lock and sensed the blanket of sound proofing that came from the silencing charm when it was cast in a room. Potter hadn’t moved a muscle or uttered a single world. He managed to cast both charms wandlessly
Blaise nodded and began to retreat, but not before Harry gave Draco a hateful look and started speaking in his loud, auror voice.
Even his jealousy over Blaise had been manufactured. His dirty talk in his office was just a farce. His sweet words during their hot sex, all lies.
Draco huffed in annoyance, and Astoria offered to cancel. He informed her that it wouldn’t be necessary and thought curling up with a book, alone, by the fire would serve him just as well.
Draco feels like the villain in this scenario and it vexes him. Nothing unpleasant happened between he and Blaise when he started fucking Harry. He just strayed because he couldn’t resist, because he was weak. After twenty years of unwavering friendship and loyalty, Blaise didn’t deserve that. At the very least, he had the right to be informed, but Draco lied about it the entire time. Blaise was always perfect for him in every way, the perfect friend, lover, vacation partner, and the perfect submissive. He may have outed him in the end, but that was only in response to Draco’s shameful betrayal. He loved Draco, painfully, probably as much as Harry did, and Draco knew in his heart he didn’t deserve either one of them. Now, he was expected to hurt him again.
There would be no such proposition tonight. Draco was still livid, from earlier. He was being pushed to his breaking point and could get no release. Harry must have sensed this, for he was treading carefully around him, all evening.
He moved forward to position himself flush behind Blaise, and pushed his own boxers down to free his cock. He placed his naked erect cock in between Blaise’s ass cheeks, asking,
“I…went to a BDSM club. A Dom took it too far. He used a cane. It was actually much worse. It’s better now.”
“And yes. That pleased me very much, more than you can imagine. You’re so fucking sexy submitting to me, Harry. I already feel addicted. Did you like it?”
Draco took one look into his pleading eyes, and all his defenses fell away. He grabbed him by his ratty old T-shirt and pulled him up to lay flush against his body on the small twin bed.
Draco let one hand fall to his hip to pull Harry back as he thrust forward, increasing his force and pace. His other hand was clutched around his chest as he leaned over, rutting into him. Draco couldn’t believe how good it felt to finally be fucking Harry again. He enjoyed bottoming, just as much, but this just hit different.
“The savior smiled shyly and blushed to the ground, confirming our suspicions that he is indeed, madly in love with Auror Malfoy, but replied ’It’s too soon to share such personal details Mr. Jones.’”
Can’t you understand what you mean to me? If it was with anyone else, I don’t think I’d have responded as badly. But, Potter? The guy treats me like trash, every time he sees me, and I’ve had to listen to you complain about him for years. I don’t know. I just snapped. I know you’ve always had a thing for him. He’s always had a thing for you too, but you were too blind to see it. I’ve known, all along, but I was always confident you’d place more stock in me, in our twenty year friendship.
Draco tackled him to the ground, blinded by his anger. He was descending into madness from his rage. He punched every inch of Harry he could reach. His punches were messy, but he got in a few good hits that made Harry wince. Harry was hitting him back, but not hard enough to cause any real damage. They were rolling on the ground, together. They tore each other’s robes trying to get the upper hand.
“No, fuck you Malfoy. You’re the selfish prick. Too dumb to realize that he’s manipulating you. Too selfish to cut him loose, the way you ought to. The guy’s in love with you and you keep stringing him along. It’s not fair to him. Are you that insecure, that you need your boy toy simpering after you, pining for you, just waiting for you to throw him a bone?
Draco smiled politely and tugged on the leash, watching Harry rise gracefully to his feet as he had taught himself. Harry tried to school his face to remain passive as he looked at the floor, afraid to meet anyone’s eyes. He bumped into Draco as someone’s hand brushed his ass, and he jumped away from the touch.
Draco obliged, walking towards him, intending to sit next to him, but Harry pulled him forward to straddle his lap. He undid his robe to rub his hands up and down his chiseled chest.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Darling, welcome home. We’ve missed you.” Astoria stepped forward and give him a light kiss on his cheek as Scorpius followed closely behind her, hiding from view.
Harry had the decency to stay away from him this morning, and he was looking forward to having lunch with Blaise.
Blaise turned his head towards him and his eyes were wet. His face was wet too, from sweat or tears, he couldn’t tell. Draco’s cock finally softened, after seeing this. He wiped his cheeks dry and kissed him, for the first time that night. It was a short, soft kiss.
“Draco, I don’t think you realize how hurtful you can be. Last night was my first time, in a sense, and you’re acting like it was nothing. You’re starting to make me feel cheap. Did you not enjoy it? Was I not good?”
“Let me out, Potter! Don’t you have a speech to give for all your adoring fans? I have no interest in speaking to you.”
It seemed a waste that such a beautiful man lived alone in such a house. He was wasted on Draco. He couldn’t bear the thought of Blaise living alone too much longer. He deserved someone to love who loved him in return. He had so much love to give, and Draco just kept swallowing it whole.
Suddenly, Draco heard the floo activate from the adjacent room across the foyer and Blaise’s voice rang out.
His eyes are closed through his orgasm, and by the time he opens them, Harry’s already huddled up to the edge of the bed, unmoving and silent. He uses his wand to cast a cleaning charm and cuddles behind his lover.
“So good,” Draco said again, watching Harry’s face as he moved faster and began to take what he wanted from the pliant body under his.
He turned around, facing away from Harry, trying to gather his bearings. He couldn’t. He had lost control. He felt more unstable, than ever before.
Draco nodded. “Excuse us, Monsieur Wolfe, and thank you for inviting us. We forgot to take care of something.”
Wrong. He wasn't into blokes. The truth was he wasn’t into anyone, if they weren’t Draco. He never felt the faintest temptation to stray. Draco made him the happiest man alive. All this, was only to make him happy in return. He’d never been attracted like this to anyone before, man or woman. His smell, alone, was enough to get his cock hard and leaking. He need only stand next to him and inhale. But, he couldn’t say these things. He had a goal.
Blaise had never held his hand in public. He knew better than that. In the past, he never felt guilty about Blaise because they had established the terms of their relationship early on. It was only recently that things started turning sour, but only because Blaise had forgotten the rules.
His rude question did not have the desired effect. Blaise just chuckled softly, not offended in the slightest.
“Listen, I never got a chance to apologize to you for being a right git. I know nothing could change what I did, but it seems to have worked out for you, in the end. I just need to talk you. It’s important. It won’t take long. Fifteen minutes, tops.”
Harry’s hand brushed his and he moved to grab it, but Draco moved sideways to put it out of reach. The electric tingle was too much to bear, tonight.
The following weeks pass without incident. They don’t go out in public, except for work, and Draco is content with that. This is how it’s always been, at his own request.
Draco did not mind too terribly. He enjoyed the feeling of fullness. It was a feeling he had not been able to experience before. He thought he may be able to fall asleep like this, but Harry’s power tingled from within. It felt more intense than usual.
“Of course, Astoria, darling. I would be a hypocrite to do otherwise. I was willing to forgive your indiscretion with Nott, but that was before I discovered this.”
Harry gasped in shocked pain. He finished quickly, only delivering four hard blows, the shape of his hairbrush imprinted in four distinct red places. As Draco set the brush down, he peeked around at Harry’s cock and was shocked to see it standing painfully erect. It took Blaise months of acclimating to stay hard during his punishments.
“I’m not fulfilling my contractual obligations. I’ve been a right prick to you. Don’t you think it’s better that you release yourself from the contract so that you’ll be free to choose someone you can actually be with. Someone who could make you happy.”
Bracing himself on the shower wall, he leaned his head against his forearm and let the water wash over him. He felt light-headed and weak, but visions from the night before started to flash in his mind.
He reached over to grasp his hand for a second, feeling proud of him, then moved to pull it back, but Blaise held onto it, leaning forward and whispering quietly.
Blaise loosened up slightly allowing Draco to thrust shallowly but comfortably. Eventually, he thrust forward all the way to hilt, not pausing for him to adjust.
Draco got up to leave, for real this time. He didn’t even say goodbye. A flat out rejection would have been more dignified than this. Harry tried to pull him back, but he shucked his grip and stormed into the parlor. He had to get out of there.
It all happened so fast. Draco felt his dangerous magic swirling around him, and immediately tried to pull him off. When Harry stumbled backwards off Blaise, he threw a messy punch at Draco instead. Draco dodged and threw a punch right back. It landed on his nose, and Harry’s shirt was instantly soaked with blood.
He used his wand to summon the neglected paper from his study at home and put it on Shacklebolt’s desk. He should have submitted the request when he intended to. None of this would happened. He was a fool to postpone it, and now he was paying the price.
He couldn’t do it. He could not bring up another man to him in this way, especially not Harry. Harry was his weak point.
They locked eyes passionately, moving closer. Draco’s heart rate picked up. The bats inside his stomach fluttered with a vengeance. Just before their lips touched, Neech apparated in the parlor. They sprung apart, startled.
Harry tore off his uniform and turned Draco around so that he leaned over the couch, his naked ass was now exposed to the air. He felt Harry stroking his cheeks lovingly and sighing behind him.
When they reached the DMLE floor, together, there was a bustle of loud chatter that immediately died down to complete silence as they walked out. Every eye was upon them as they walked towards their offices. Draco averted his eyes and walked forward, calmly. He felt like he was a fish in a fishbowl. It was a horribly uncomfortable feeling, and Draco had the impulse to run to his office, but maintained a calm facade. He felt the weight of hundreds of judgmental eyes upon him.
After breakfast, Harry gave him a tour of the house. It was almost, all redone. It wasn’t opulent, but it was comfortable and cozy. It wasn’t all white like Draco’s home, but had a warmer palette of brown, ivory, dark green, and burgundy. It reminded Draco of an old pureblood home he visited when he was a child. There was an enormous portrait at the center of the staircase that Harry had hung multiple curtains around.
Twenty minutes later, Harry finally walked through the front door to the parlor, where he knew Draco was waiting.
He then lay flat on his belly, to the ground, and pulled his pants down, along with his boxers just far enough to expose his sculpted, perfectly round bottom.
He cast a quick cleaning, lubrication, and stretching charm on the pert porcelain ass before him, then coated his own cock with some left over lube.
“My boy, my beautiful boy,” he whispered, his hand still rubbing and massaging as he feasted on one tight nipple. Nipples were Harry’s most erogenous zone. His other hand found its mate and Draco made sure to turn up the volume on his own sounds as he tasted his pet. He was usually very quiet in the bedroom and he knew his noises drove Harry mad.
He lowered his voice to a near whisper and bent his head conspiratorially so that Draco had to lean in to hear him, their faces almost touching,
Draco began to move slowly, very slowly at first, shifting his angle to find his prostate, pleased when he felt Harry shudder and groan when he found his mark.
When it was a quarter to 11, he remembered to send a memo to Blaise that he would not be able to make lunch.
“Harry is not himself. I’m very worried for him. He would kill me if he knew I was here, but I had to come. He doesn’t say much, but he’s different. I can tell...there’s something off. He’s heartbroken.”
He leaned some of his weight on the ropes and reached around to stroke him to completion while still maintaining a punishing pace.
He thinks on the two of them, and all their actions. Everything Harry’s said and who he is, and what kind of bastard he, himself, is. And he finds, no matter how much he doesn’t want to, just one logical conclusion: Harry did love him. Probably, he still does.
It was perfect, of course. Draco cursed inwardly. It was slightly bigger than Draco’s but they were matching in girth. He kissed all around it first, caressing and kissing his inner thighs. Harry was shaking harder now and little sounds were escaping in bursts, as if he were trying to hold them in. He took pity on him and wrapped a hand around the base
Draco crawled up next to him and forced him on his side. He cast the preparation charms, adding an extra protection spell, and immediately breeched his entrance with his painfully hard cock. He sighed in relief at the tight squeezing feeling, and entered him fully with the first jab. Blaise, involuntarily, tried to eject him.
Draco let him control the pace. He forgot how good he was at blowjobs. The man was a master at sucking cock. He let out a involuntary groan. Blaise released his cock to speak.
“You’ll control yourself—you’ll love it. Such control is to be admired, pet. Mind you, I’ll let you cum if you beg me nicely enough, and admit that you don’t have control—that control is mine.”
It was a line he used on his son Scorpius if he ever acted out in a temper. Blaise knew that. It was a testament to their long friendship and how deeply integrated into Draco’s life he was. He sighed, feeling more miserable.
Immediately, Harry shoots his load all over the floor with a harsh cry, tears streaming down his face. It’s enough to pull Draco’s own orgasm out of him. It rips viciously through body with a hoarse roar. He may have intended to torture Harry, but it was no less torture for him to hold out. Leaning his head against his back for a few moments, trying to catch his breath, he withdraws and his cum splatters the ground, dripping from Harry’s hole.
Suddenly, Harry moved off him and lay flat on the bed besides him, spreading his legs wide open and pushing up his ass, an invitation to Draco.
Harry put his tea down and stood in front of Draco’s seated body, then knelt in front of him. His eyes were downcast. Draco was confused by this, until he dared to reach out and touch his inner thigh.
Harry kissed him as he pushed faster inside him, hammering his prostate with every thrust. He clasped their fingers, and Draco was distracted for a moment by their hands intertwining.
Harry was moving faster over him, moaning loudly. He was starting to control the pace, but Draco didn’t mind because he couldn’t grab onto him anywhere, for fear of hurting his raw skin. Faster and faster he moved atop him and Draco was about to blow. He wrapped his hand around Harry’s cock with difficulty, as he was pressed so close, and he began to stroke.
“So good. It’s always so good. I don’t know what to do anymore. I need to have you like this all the time. I feel addicted. I think about it all day.”
The kids get along beautifully, and they already function as a family together. Draco kisses him again.
Draco drops the whip and walks to where he knows the cage to be. When fingers touch fabric, he removes the sheet. Walking back to Blaise’s weeping figure, he sees that he’s shaking so badly that it looks like he’s having a seizure. He unbuckles his ankle cuffs first, then his wrists. Blaise completely collapses onto the bench. He removes his blind fold so that he can see the cage, but doesn’t meet his eyes.
When Blaise opened his bathroom door, he stepped out in a cloud of steam. His hair was damp from the shower, and a towel swung low on his hips. He looked absolutely edible. Draco remained silent, taking him in, as he walked towards his wardrobe to dress. Sensing someone in the room, he turned around to see Draco creepily staring at him from the corner and nearly jumped out of his skin in shock.
He clutched Harry’s back, let out a long breath that he did not realize he was holding, and buried his face in his neck. He inhaled deeply and almost moaned at the scent. He missed it more than he realized. He smelled a faint version of this every night, before he went to sleep, through Harry’s auror robes that hung in his closet. It was a pale imitation of the real thing.
would heal it because it was from a curse, not trauma. They had to shave his head to get the magic to penetrate better, and Harry fears is that he’ll end up like professor Lockhart with no memory of him. Harry can’t stand to rest his eyes on his face, gashed like mad-eye moody, his gorgeous body, propped up in such an odd position, held at the right angles by magic.
Blaise comes up behind him and turns him around so that they’re face to face. His large hands grip Draco’s arms and his touch burns through his clothes. His full lips are parted invitingly. Close up, Draco sees his stubble and remembers how it feels when he’s dragging his face across his cock. His blue eyes are burning into him. Blood seems to be leaving his brain. His heartbeat picks up. He knows he doesn’t love Blaise the way he loves Harry, but Blaise was always able spark something in him.
Draco’s eyes furrow in confusion. The children glance from their father to Draco as if a fight is going to break out.
“Oh, I bet nothing happened, you sick, twisted fuck. I bet you didn’t stick your prick into one of those pathetic loser submissives that were drooling all over themselves for you. I saw the way they were looking at you as you led me on your little leash...You have Blaise. You have me. Who knows what other whores you keep? Fuck you,
Draco put the whip away and tried to push down his cock which was tenting his trousers. A dark spot had formed, but he was wearing black so it was not noticeable. He came back and stroked his ass again.
Draco looked down at his plate, and it did look delicious. Maybe his brain would kick into gear if he had a few bites.
I can’t tonight. I have to meet Blaise at the Wizarding Country Club for drinks. Standing appointment, every Wednesday.”
“This could never work. I need something casual, without attachment and all this emotion. I’ll go mental, otherwise. I need a submissive lover, and you’re never going to be that.”
Every time Harry thinks about his long soft, golden hair, his eyes ache and his throat feels too tight. When his eyes shut, which isn’t often, he has nightmares about Draco’s mutilated bloody body, of what his shattered bones look like on the inside. His bad dreams of bleeding Draco aren’t much worse than being awake.
Draco was bursting to tell him that he loved him, but he could not yet, summon the courage. What if all the looks he saw in Harry’s gaze were just a figment of his imagination? What if Mr. Jones completely lied in his interview? Would Draco be able to hand the rejection when Harry would inevitably respond that though he liked him very much, it was too soon to be talking of love. He did not think his weak heart could handle that type of rejection, so he stayed quiet.
“When are you going to learn that it’s impossible for you to lie to me? You look like you’re on the verge of tears, for merlin’s sake. What happened?”
Harry’s angry face flashed behind his closed eyes as he laid his head back on Blaise’s right shoulder.
“I said it was all just a game. I know it looks horrible and I’m sorry. It didn’t mean anything. It was just role play. I owed him a debt. That’s all.”
“If you want to resort to degrading me, I’ll just leave.” He walked towards the door. Draco refused to become Harry’s punching bag, no matter how he felt about him.
He was taken aback by how beautiful Harry looked, how sweet he could be. It was a little disturbing, the desperate way he wanted to reach out and draw him closer, cuddle on the bed with him, without his collar.
He’s lodged in his throat. Harry closes his eyes and works him with his lips and tongue and cheeks and hands that tremble, and he groans. He feel Draco’s legs quake. His fingers dig into his scalp. Draco thrusts deeper into his throat, using him the way he likes to be used, and Harry’s cock is full and thick and throbbing. Then he squeeze his balls, and he spends with a tremor and a loud groan.
Stopping right in front of him, Harry grabbed his hand to pull him close, but Draco wrenched his hand away. His oaky masculine scent was infiltrating his nostrils, triggering his memories, but he suppressed them. He stepped closer to kiss him, but Draco shoved him away, with all his might, before he could reach his target. He stumbled backwards.
Draco could hear the tension in his voice. Harry would surely use his safe words if it was becoming too much for him. That was the point of this.
Draco could not tell him he loved him, but he could show him. He had just the thing to prove his love, but first he needed to kiss him. He stood up and went to straddle Harry’s lap. He brushed his lips softly against his, then gradually deepened it, pouring all his love into that kiss. It went on a long time, long enough to feel Harry harden beneath him.
He realizes Harry’s trying to get the upper hand; he rubs his leg against his cock, jostling his sac around. He is pretty sure he can finish him without cumming again like a prepubescent boy—and then Harry blows, his leg rubbing him just so. Draco spends as he’s trying to swallow. Harry chuckles even as he’s spurting and Draco is drinking him down. When he rejoins him at the table, he finds that he’s eaten both sandwiches. Harry arches an eyebrow in a most Malfoy-like manner
“My problem is I still have your cum dripping out of my arse, and you’re asking why I’m not seeing other people. It’s insulting Draco.”
Blaise moved his hand lower, to dip beneath his trousers and touch his half-hard cock. He stroked it leisurely, his warm hand bringing Draco to full hardness after only a few strokes.
“God, I love you Harry. I love you fucking much. Don’t leave me. Whatever happens, don’t leave me. I’ll die without you.”
He would find the courage to endure the weaknesses he felt, just to have Harry to leave him. The facts are they came from opposite ends of the line. No one would accept
“You look beautiful,” Draco purred, stroking Harry’s bare chest with the flat of his hand. He slid his hand under the shirt, finding a nipple easily and pinching it hard. Then he did the same to the other, smoothing the silk against the erect peaks.
He should just walk out of the country club right now. He moved to do so, but Blaise, realizing he had pushed him too far, let his impassive facade fall, for a moment. He began to panic and grabbed his wrist tightly.
Harry had been getting berated all day. People were screaming at him and hounding him with questions, yet his first worry was about Draco? He didn’t expect this. His heart softened. All thoughts of ending this left his mind.
A wolfish grin lights up Draco’s face and Harry thinks it’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
Harry groans. He doesn’t want to move a muscle. Draco hugs him tightly and rubs his cheek over his hair.
He took him on, the Monday after they had returned from Turkey. At first, Draco thought he was using him as a buffer between them, so that nothing untoward could happen. As time went on, however, it became clear that Harry just wanted to have someone there to watch, as he berated Draco.
Draco’s cock hardened to full mast. Blaise always knew just what to say to get the blood pumping south. He brought the whip down with medium strength five times and Blaise didn’t make a sound though the red marks were prominent. He didn’t even flinch.
Lunch in Draco’s office was a quiet affair. Draco tried to engage him with discussion about a new case, but Harry was only half-listening. He could not get Blaise’s words out of his head. He was shaken by their interaction. Their conversation played on a loop in his mind driving him closer to the edge. Suddenly, he interrupted.
The problem was that the Malfoy financial holdings were vast and plentiful. His salary as an auror was just a penny in the bucket, a very complicated bucket which involved investments all around the world, both in real estate and various companies. These were investments that dated before his father’s time. He even had a shareholding in Ollivander’s.
Scorpius was behaving more mature, not prattling enthusiastically at every little detail. He still talked to him delightedly about his trip to Paris, but he was more reserved than usual. Draco joked that he seemed more “French” and Scorpius took it as a compliment. He wanted a flash of his younger Scorpius back, and chose that time to tell him the good news.
He didn’t answer, but picked up the pace. Draco could tell he was getting closer to his orgasm. He supposed it was rendering him speechless.
Draco crouches down right by him. “Hey, Harry.” It’s so natural to touch him—his hands in his hair, his palm draped gently over his hot forehead.
He knew, deep down, the way the hunched man felt about him, though his conscious self always tried to deny it. He knew he was a selfish prick for fucking Blaise so frequently the last few months, taking him on romantic weekend getaways.
He was beyond sexually frustrated at this point. After a minute, he got up and went to another room. Harry followed. Not wanting to get into a shouting match in public, he gave up and decided to go back to the hotel.
In the mountainous Asia side of northern Turkey, they managed to uncover the main warehouse where all the potions were being made.
Harry was wearing his glasses, plaid pajama bottoms and a ratty t-shirt that was tight around his arms.
Though most of the Ministry was empty, the DMLE was more busy than usual for a weekend, in light of their recent arrest, and they both got to work.
Draco didn’t know why he was baiting him. Perhaps he was just trying to get a reaction out of him. He’d been playing the ‘cool as a cucumber’ card for far too long. It was grating his nerves.
Beneath his auror regalia that was fitted to perfection, Draco was chiseled like a greek god, from hours spent working out his aggressions at the gym.
A picture of Harry and Draco walking through the DMLE together after having solved a big case took up most the front page. Draco quickly flipped through the newspaper to see if there were any incriminating photos. There weren’t. Small mercies.
I got drunk and we made a mistake. That’s ALL. It’s never happening again, and I don’t want to discuss it further. Do you understand?”
“I see. I don’t know if I believe that, but I do know that I’ve missed you. I miss my best friend. Not having you at the proposal party felt awful and wrong. You were the only one I really wanted to celebrate with and you weren’t there. We’ve talked about this, since we were boys.”
He hears himself say, “I can’t do this. I don’t want to do this bullshit with you anymore. I don’t want you, Harry. I’m fucking done.”
With a roar, Harry slams into him, holding. He spends so hard, it’s almost a painful experience, and he half passes out.
She had come from a very old line of pureblood wizards with immense wealth, old money. Unfortunately, her father was a very foolish man who gambled all their galleons away betting on horse races and quidditch matches. They were left with nothing but a good title and a good name when Draco decided to marry her.
“Yes, I’m dramatic. The killing curse came straight towards the man I love for no other reason than the fact that he’s with me. I’m fucking dramatic about that, and I always will be. What if I wasn’t there? How many more want to kill you for being with the bloody chosen one? Everyone wants to tear us apart.”
“Harry, we’re in public,” he moaned into his shoulder. Harry snapped his fingers in reply and they were instantly disillusioned, becoming invisible with the wall.
“No, I want more. I’ll always want more, my dragon.” Harry sighed at his own longing and rested his head against his hand, in defeat. He stepped back further from the wall, bending over more. He rubbed his ass against Draco’s hard cock. Draco squeezed his glutes in response.
“Don’t forget I listen to begging,” he said with a smile, popping the lid on the lube again and making sure Harry saw it.
He used his wand to vanish the rope and the gag. Blaise collapsed forward, knees hitting the ground, still not moving.
Of course, St. Mungo’s. What the bloody hell took him so long to realize he was in desperate need of St. Mungo’s? He grabs Harry and apparates him there.
Draco got stuck doing scut work, instead, fit for a first year, junior auror. The case he had just returned from involved a batty old witch who believed her plates were stolen. She had misplaced them on the top of her kitchen shelf, too high for her old eyes to see.
Blaise stood his ground, not moving a muscle, his knuckles white from clutching the towel so tightly. Feeling his own heartbeat start to pick up, he took a deep breath and held it.
Draco’s wound up tight when he arrives at Grimmauld Place that night, and Harry’s nowhere in sight. Fear and fury mix as he stalks through the house. When he pushes open the bedroom door and finds it dark, a wall of dread slams into him. Then, he hears the springs creak.
Harry undid his own trousers with one hand while casting the appropriate charms on Malfoy with the other.
Then, there was her famed beauty. Her long silky thick blonde hair caused a frenzy wherever they went. She was like some sort of Repunzel with her soft polite voice and cheerful, but reserved manners. She had huge blue eyes, perfect clear skin, and the body of a gymnast. She stood at 5’7, tall enough to look absolutely perfect standing next to her husband.
It did not hurt as much with Harry moving gently in and out. He adjusted his angle and managed brush his prostate by accident. Draco yelped, and Harry began to pull out, in alarm, afraid he had hurt him.
Draco strode out of his office to check on the transfer. He saw Harry and the junior auror standing across the room in front of the lifts to go down. As they waited, the young auror brushed lint off of Harry’s shoulder and then blushed when Harry turned his head at the touch. He didn’t seem pleased about it, at first, until he saw Draco in the distance, and flashed Auror Smith a warm smile. The lifts opened and he guided him in by the small of his back. Before the lifts closed, he saw Harry whisper something into his ear that made him blush harder.
“I’m sorry…for being a prat to you these last few months,” Harry says tearfully. “I knew I was pushing you away, but somehow I didn’t really think you’d leave.”
that means he saw Draco slap him across the face and then spit on him. That means he had to witness him raping his mouth forcefully. He heard him calling him a cock hungry whore, a little bitch boy. He heard him make Blaise beg for his cock. All the verbal and sexual degradation that made him blush, just to remember, Harry had heard in real time.
“Watch your mouth, Potter. I refuse to accept your degradation behind closed doors. Maybe, this isn’t going to work, after all.”
At Draco’s sour expression, he continued, “I can switch this weekend with Ginny and come with you alone. A Paris vacation will be good for us. We haven’t gone anywhere in ages.”
That was the first compliment Harry had paid him, all year, and Draco didn’t trust anyone to handle a case of this magnitude.
He could not get the look of sheer horror on Harry’s face out of his mind. He probably thought he was disgusting and loathsome, twisted and sick. He probably finally realized how unworthy a person Draco was to be with someone as good and whole as him. In truth, he didn’t blame the man. He wouldn’t blame him for leaving him for this, for seeing his sick dominant side, but his heart broke into a million pieces, just thinking about it. He had to try, as best he could, to keep Harry by his side. It was too late to pretend to be okay with Harry leaving him, even though he deserved it. He loved him with every fibre of his being. If Harry left him, he would become an empty vessel. His life would be scooped out and thrown to ruin. He would be forced to live the rest of his miserable life as an empty shell.
“They’re not my ideals. They’re yours. Draco, who are you living your life for? For those pureblood prats you see at parties sometimes?
The shower took much longer than usual. When he finally came out of his bathroom, he was incensed to find Potter waiting for him. He was sitting on the bed, freshly showered, in Draco’s pajamas.
He remembered the article in the paper from the morning before, that blasted picture of him kissing Jacob for all the world to see. Of course, it all starting making sense. This was a typical Draco move. He felt relieved.
“I didn’t say I was getting tired of you. How could you talk about ending this? I’m just tired of you living in denial. I know you want to be with me. I just don’t know what’s stopping you. Look at how well our sons get along. Can’t you see we’re meant to be together? Talk to me. Whatever it is, we can work through it.”
Draco wakes up before Harry, thankful for the opportunity to study his beautiful face in sleep, one of his favorite hobbies. He takes in his long dark lashes and mess of dark hair on the pillow. He can’t help but stroke his pouty lips. But his face is clenched as if he’s suffering, even in sleep. It’s a new look and Draco knows he hardly slept last night. He stayed awake a long time listening for the sound of his even breathing, but it never came. He wanted to hold him so badly but felt a broodiness from him the entire night. Harry was hiding something from him. He feared that he was overwhelmed with their new arrangement and wanted to give him space to think. Still, his pet deserved a reward for his performance yesterday.
“Draco…don’t get weird on me. It was just the heat of the moment. It got intense, and it just slipped out. I don’t know what came over me.”
in them and imagined his love was reflected back, shining through his own eyes, at that exact moment.
He descended the lifts under a disillusionment charm, in case any reporters were waiting. He congratulated himself for anticipating them as many were indeed, waiting to attack. Harry did the same and went out of the emergency exit. He was going to fly to Draco’s house on his motorcycle.
When he got back to the floor of the DMLE, he heard Harry’s laughter emanating through his half-open office door, along with a softer male voice. He burst through the head auror office, without knocking to announce his presence.
“I’m sorry, Draco. Ever since my power has strengthened, I do feel unstable. I can usually control it, but you have this affect on me. The idea of him, even touching you, drives me mental. I can’t help how I feel. I told you, already. When it comes to you, I feel like I’m losing it. I think I’m really starting to fall for you.”
Still, Draco takes his time enjoying him. He uses mostly lips and tongue, so at the end, when he starts sucking, he’s rewarded with another spurt of salty sweet precum. He cums a second later. Harry’s hand is grasping his hair, his cock is shoved down his throat, his whole body quaking violently as curses spill from his lips.
“This is unacceptable. You are never to come into my house again. What were you thinking? What if Harry was here? Do you think you’d get out of here alive?”
He suddenly reared up on his knees and grasped Draco’s ass cheeks for leverage, while he hammered inside. Every molecule in Draco’s body sang with pleasure. He was so close to cumming already, he could hardly believe it. He reached down to stroke his own cock, feeling close to the edge. Harry was brushing his prostate at every other stroke causing an electric shock to pass through his body, every time.
Luckily, he remembered there was a floo at the opposite end of the ballroom. His Italian leather shoes clanked ominously on the marble floor, echoing in the quiet room, until he finally reached the fireplace. He turned on his heel, without meeting Harry’s eyes, and vanished back to Malfoy Manor, without a word.
As the adults followed, they brushed hands accidentally. Draco felt a tingle go through his fingers and retreated his hand immediately, crossing his arms; his mood soured further.
He went back to work and sat at his desk in pain, a reminder of the fact that he would never allow himself to be treated like this again.
A friendly peck was one thing, but this was something different. He felt something for Blaise, but he just could not put his finger on what it was. He only knew he felt an intense possessiveness towards the man. It overwhelmed Draco last night, in light of his nuptial news.
After ten minutes of rolling on the floor together and massaging each other’s tongues together, Draco had to wonder no longer.
That night, Harry lay awake on Draco’s bed with his body turned away facing the wall, huddled against the far edge. He was still thinking about everything Blaise had said. His eyes prickled when he imagined Draco leaving him. Maybe he would catch him drilling the hole of some submissive prat who loved every second of Draco’s verbal degradation. He never heard it being directed at him, and that was the problem. He only heard flowery words of love from Draco. It would never be enough to keep him. Harry sighed, closing his eyes against the memory of that pensive. It suddenly sharpened in his mind. He remembered Draco’s body, flushed crimson, sweat dripping from his face, as he reamed into Blaise who was tied down to the bed, blindfolded. He had been fucking him for hours. He remembered Draco’s degrading words to Blaise like it were yesterday.
“I didn’t kiss her,” he moans, shaking slightly from what Draco thinks might be exertion. “She…kissed me. Dosed…my coffee.”
He touched Harry’s shoulder and he jumped away, startled. He looked at the real Draco with shock and horror.
“If your precious Harry is suffering so much, he knows where to find me. He hasn’t come to see me. Not once.” Draco can’t help a tone of bitterness coming through.
He may have been able to understand Harry getting off on hurting him. It happens. Men get unexplainable erections all the time, at the slightest breeze, though less so at Draco and Harry’s age, but still, it happened. No big deal. No harm, no foul.
Astoria startled him out of reverie by gripping his hand on the table tightly, boring into his eyes with significance.
“Let’s talk more about what you want out of this. So as I understand it, you like to be dominated with rough sex, verbal degradation, rope play. Is there anything else you like?”
After they get him set up, Harry drags his eyes open. He squints down at himself, at all the contraptions attached to his body, and his eyes shine with tears.
He collapsed on the wall behind him, slightly bending his knees so he wouldn’t fall over. He kept his eyes downcast to the floor as the man beneath him stood up, noticing Harry’s cum splattered on the tile by his feet.
with his legs far apart, toes pointed straight. Draco positioned him so that his top half lay flat on the bed, instead. Being flat on his belly strained him more, but Blaise did not complain. He didn’t even shake.
Harry wrapped his arms around his chest, standing flush against his back, and paused. He kissed his neck before he started to move and moaned,
This had never happened before. Draco often fucked him three or four times in a single night, rarely only once. His libido was limitless.
He sprinted to the bathroom on light feet and shut the door behind him as softly as possible before promptly sicking up in the toilet.
They kissed passionately as Harry pushed his now hardening cock against Draco’s from above, moaning into his mouth through the kisses. Draco grabbed his ass and thrust up to increase the pressure and Harry groaned.
But it doesn’t. These bloody potions don’t seem to work on Harry. Don’t they realize how strong he is? How special? His eyes flip open again a few seconds later. They jump all around the room until they settle on Draco. Harry groans, “Draco?”
“Draco!” Harry’s body tensed tight like a bow and he let out a loud moan. He felt cum splatter against his throat and continued sucking shallowly, using his tongue to lap the cum around the head. It tasted sweeter than Blaise’s. He was shivering in intervals now. Then it finally stopped and he went limp.
“I understand you endured a werewolf attack last Friday. You weren’t bitten, and it wasn’t the full moon, so we didn’t feel the need to, immediately, warn you about potential side effects. You left too early for us to council you, fully. Can you tell me what you were doing, before the werewolf attack?”
He takes the bottle to the couch and takes long pulls from it until he’s able to to lie back without his heart racing. Still restless, though. He gets up and walks to the front window.
Harry noticed the “HP” in thin black lettering by the buckle. Draco was finally letting him in, letting him see. He blinked rapidly to clear his watering eyes. He needed to feel the pressure of the expensive leather around his neck.
Draco started ramming into him now, feeling close to the edge but knowing he was not going to cum yet. Blaise’s words would have normally made him cum, already. The potion gave him endurance.
Draco remained fully clothed. He had not come here for sex and didn’t want Harry to get the wrong impression. He sat up on the bed, with his back on the headboard, waiting for Harry to finish.
He’s midway through his shower when the door’s pulled open. Draco almost has a heart attack. And then he sees who it is.
“Maybe we should order some take out for a late lunch. I was thinking Thai food. What do you think?”
Draco was dressed in simple but tailored muggle clothing. He wore fitted black jeans with a crisp white tee shirt that hugged his body tightly, hinting at the abs underneath. Looking down further, Harry saw that he wore the classic black and white Van’s sneaker. His hair hung loosely, framing his face, emphasizing his high cheekbones. He looked like a very different man than Harry was used to.
Harry cracked his neck menacingly and stretched his fighting arm over his head, as if getting ready to use it. His muscles bulged. Draco’s cock stirred, just watching him, his stupid serious face, his green eyes, burning in the sunlight.
Draco arrived at Malfoy Manor, dreading the evening’s conversation. He would have to tell Astoria he had filed for divorce. It took a few weeks for her to be notified, but he did not want her to blindsided by an owl delivery upending her life.
Harry and Draco did not exchange two words throughout the entire breakfast. Harry was smart enough not to engage him. When the Potters got up to take their leave, Draco was relieved. He needed time to collect himself after his emotional day yesterday. Hours of enduring personal time with Harry’s soft laughs, shy smiles, and terrible chess skills had overwhelmed him.
Harry raised his eyebrows. He was very lucky Draco was not his Dom because he would have instantly bent him over his desk and spanked him hard enough for all his subordinates to hear.
Blaise directed a hateful glare at Draco behind his shoulder and turned back to face the church again.
Harry squirmed, feeling both humiliated and excited. Draco had not touched his cock, but when he guided Harry’s body down, he had trapped it with his muscular thighs. The rough tweed of his trousers rubbing his cock as Harry pumped his hips slightly was almost enough to push him over the edge.
Once, Draco had tried to impale himself on Harry, while he was half asleep, in a desperate attempt to relieve the tension, but he was quickly pushed off. Whenever Draco would make the initiative while he was awake, Harry would claim he had a stomach ache or a headache. He would claim his back muscles were sore which they often were, as a remnant of the werewolf attack they endured on the night Harry first made love to him.
He had a nightmare that a brutal Dom was flogging him with a glass ended whip, ripping the skin from his back. And all this Dom/sub play was triggering memories of him.
He usually had more stamina. Surely, it was because it had been too long. He would eventually grow used to this feeling and be able to fuck Harry for hours, but not this time.
Draco was relieved, but he still shuddered to think what Harry would have felt if it wasn’t a full moon, that night. Even if Harry could break the ropes, the first few blows would have been enough to scar a person's psyche.
cum was splattered all over his stomach, but Harry didn’t seem to mind as he rested his face into Draco’s neck, still buried inside him.
Draco just stared at him with cold unflinching eyes. He was tempted to tell him that yes, Blaise did call him master, when it pleased him, that he was the better submissive, the better friend. He wanted to tell him that, sometimes, he missed his best mate terribly. Like right now. He wished he could floo call Blaise and complain about how Harry was being a right git. He missed him so much in that moment that his eyes stung.
He realized then that he never gave Harry enough, even during sex. He always left it to Harry to tell him how much he needed him, wanted him. Draco wished he could look into his eyes, but now wasn’t the time. Harry wanted it this way, and he promised. He gritted his teeth against an early orgasm, but he was so damn close. He stroked Harry’s hair and pushed his face close to his chest. The sheer pleasure of his velvet heat combined with Harry’s arousal after everything he’d just been through was enough to make him blow right away.
Morning came and Harry was no longer in his bed. He expected as much. Being casual usually meant no sleepovers. He was surprised that Harry understood this concept but appreciated it, all the same.
While he showered, his brain wasn’t processing anything, until he reached behind him to vigorously wash his backside. It was already incredibly sore, and he knew he would feel it more tomorrow. When he pulled his fingers away, he noticed the water was tinged a very pale pink. Harry had managed to make him bleed, in his inexperience. Draco’s eyes prickled, but not from pain.
Draco thinks there’s something’s wrong with him for being at St. Mungo’s at all. He’s no more than a jilted ex. An ex-lover. An ex-deatheater. He doesn’t belong here.
Harry thought he might pass out from anticipation as warm fingers inserted themselves into the elastic waistband of his boxers, sliding around his waist before pulling the boxers down to his knees.
He wasn’t planning on fucking Harry again. This was just a one-off, a drunken mistake, never to be repeated, as far as Draco was concerned.
Harry gets on his knees in front of him and runs his hands up his outstretched legs. Draco smiles and sits up—because he looks thoughtful…maybe anxious. He thinks it’s because Harry's never been away from work for so long.
The minute he arrived, he was assaulted by hundreds of camera flashes. There weren’t four or five reporters, there were dozens upon dozens. It seemed like hundreds were there,
He put his hands on his chest and pushed him away, hard. Harry stumbled backwards as Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand in exaggerated  disgust. He saw that Harry's erection was back in full force.
As Harry read the contract over, he thought of Blaise and how victorious he was over him. He almost felt bad for the poor sod. Not wanting to ruin the mood in France, he decided not to mention him before, but couldn’t help doing so now.
This is Harry Potter, the bloody savior, the thorn in his side. He was hounded wherever he went. This would come out and he would be destroyed.
When they arrived at an abandoned warehouse, thankfully in one piece, Harry turned off the car and pressed the invisibility shield.
Draco arrived at Malfoy Manor Saturday afternoon, boneless and spent. No one was there to greet him, but he was fine with that. He didn’t have the energy to deal with anyone. He could barely lift his pinky finger, let alone tug his suitcase up the stairs. He immediately disapparated from the foyer to his bedroom and collapsed on the bed.
Draco let out a loud breath, leaning forward. He slammed his forearms on the door behind Blaise, resting his forehead there as he let his eyes close.
“Black? Blimey, this is my aunt’s ancestral home, from my mother’s side. No wonder it has that pureblood feel. I’ve been here before, as a child. I like this place. How did you get it?”
“You’re worth the risk. I can’t let the man I love walk out on me after finally admitting he loves me.”
He’s flying, feeling lighter. His orgasm gives him temporary reprieve from the weight of his pain. He thinks, in that moment, that he truly is his whore, because if this is all he’s offering…he’ll take it.
potion, just in case. It would insure that he would be able to fuck Blaise all night long, without having to worry about his blasted feelings for Harry getting in the way of his erection. He needed a hard cock and a good fuck.
“This is over.” Harry said, with crossed arms, and he started walking towards the floo, in the main parlor.
“Right as rain. I saw the healer this morning and she went over some exercises with me. One of them will be something I can do if I’m in the fuck position. Over a bottom.”
Draco shook his head and his eyes prickled, but he kept his voice steady. “We’ll talk about it later, pet. Rest and then we’ll get you cleaned up. I think we could both use a soak in the tub.”
By the time Saturday night rolled around, Draco was a pent up ball of sexual frustration. When Harry was around, Draco’s dominant side became quiet and subdued, but it never totally vanished. It was a part of him the same way his platinum hair and grey eyes were.
When he felt Blaise’s hard cock pressing against his thigh, he finally thought of Harry. He would be heartbroken if he saw this.
Harry cupped his face in his hands and kissed him like he never has before. Draco felt the familiar pulling sensation inside his heart. He put his hands around Harry’s neck and kissed him for all he was worth. They parted after a few long minutes.
While in the atrium, he was shocked to run into Blaise again, who gave him that pleading look, but he quickly sidestepped him and turned right back around, to go back up the lifts. He had suddenly lost his appetite.
He had been on an emotional roller coaster with both Harry and Blaise, and he was so relieved to finally be stepping off.
Draco could not believe Harry’s commanding tone and insistence. Desperate dirty talk usually escaped Draco after Harry was already fucking him, and he was too far gone to care. He did not mind answering his requests, then, but this was different. He was holding his cock away, for ransom. He was always forcing Draco to admit how much he needed him during sex. He wished he could deny him, but his cock was already leaking pre-cum on the floor, in anticipation of being filled. He had finally grown accustomed to bottoming and craved it, all hours of the day. He had no choice.
Draco looks down at him and his face is no longer blank and expressionless. His eyes are sparkling up at him, and his expression is pained, as if he’s wounded by his love for him. He’s waiting for Draco to nod in understanding, but Draco leans back, flat on the bed, because it hurts to look at him when he’s wearing his heart on his sleeve and a chain around his neck. As he stares at the ceiling with his feet planted firmly on the ground, Harry kneeling between his bent knees, he almost wishes for the blank expression back because it’s easier to deny him what he wants when he’s wearing it.
There’s a picture on the front page of the Daily Profit. Some perv snapped it at the hospital. Draco’s leaning over him, stroking his hair back like a lover would. Then, he kisses his cheek. He can hardly stand to look at it. Throwing the paper on his chair, he gets up to take a shower.
“It’s back to 'Potter' now, is it? It was ‘baby,' just a second ago. Draco, I’ve already started a divorce from Ginny. You need to do the same. You can’t keep living a lie. Everyone suffers.”
and stopped abruptly at the border, thrusting Scorpius off of the board, tumbling head first onto the grass.
Draco obliged. He fucked him deeper but maintained a steady pace. Blaise’s moans increased in pitch.
He knew he was petty, but he couldn’t help it. Little joys. Figured he was a saint for not hitting him with
“Everyone? One lone psycho shouldn’t dictate our lives, Harry. I checked in with Shacklebolt and he told me the guy was drawing pictures of you in his cell. Not everyone is so cuckoo. And I’m not exactly a helpless damsel.”
Harry nodded against the shower wall. Draco reached around to stroke his cock and Harry’s noises became even louder.
Worried about the horses, he peeks at the stables and is relieved to see them still standing. Finally, he chances a glance at Harry who’s rolled onto his back, staring at him with a lopsided smile.
Pansy came back in with a teacup and saucer in hand. Draco got up to give her the seat back. This was her place, now, at his bedside, not his.
In the end, that’s why he can’t go yet. It’s fucked up but Draco is a fuckup for him. If he’s ever going to leave London, he needs to see if he’s okay. But he's leaving for Paris tonight, regardless. He just wants to be sure he has someone to share his shy smiles with. Realizing that makes him feel like he might cry.
Draco often joked that Blaise’s sexual prowess was such that he ’turned’ Draco, that he could ‘turn’ anyone, no matter how straight they claimed to be. Blaise believes the same is true of Draco.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco's heart was exploding in his chest at the feeling. He felt he would burst, at any moment. Eventually, he rocked back and forth indicating his readiness for movement. Harry began thrusting slowly, but oh, so deeply. Draco kept his face turned and his eyes shut tight, focusing on the incredible sensation of being fucked by Harry again. He was brushing his prostate every fourth or fifth stroke, causing Draco to tremble. Despite himself, Draco kept letting out small moans of pleasure when Harry thrust in. Harry tried to turn his face towards him, but he resisted. This felt intense enough, as it is.
“We’re still trying to sort that out, Mr. Potter. I just need to ask you a few questions. What were you doing before you lost consciousness, tonight?”
He felt Harry licking and kissing his neck before picking up speed. Draco clutched the back of the couch as hard as he could to brace himself against Harry’s fast punishing strokes.
He moved to lay next to him, cradling his body. Draco hugged him tightly and rested his head on his chest. He was breathing hard, like someone grieving.
Harry gulped for air, trying to calm himself. This is Draco, he reminded himself, whom he’d be able to stop with his safe word.
He considered faking sick to skive off dinner with Harry. He didn’t know why he had agreed to it the first place. It was before they went to the beach, but now this whole thing was beginning to feel like a lover’s vacation, and Draco didn’t like it. He just wanted to go home.
Harry looked up, trying to blink back his tears. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I know you wanted to…you enjoyed it in there…I ruined it…,” he stammered.
He led Harry down the sidewalk briskly, not wanting to subject him to the stares of the curious when passerby caught a glimpse of the leash.
Draco sighed and covered his eyes as if a migraine was coming. For the last few months, Harry had learned that Draco trained vigorously at the gym designated for the aurors and would join him there a few times a week. This irked Draco to no end as he was forced to acknowledge how fit the bloke had become, how much he had filled out, all muscle and certainly stockier than Draco’s lithe figure.
When Draco wakes up, it’s nearly noon. The manor is quiet, his throat is dry, and his whole body’s achy sore.
He wished so badly he could floo call Blaise. He would know just what to say as he was the only one who understood what it meant to feel like this. He would understand his distress over almost truly hurting Harry. Instead, he went into his study and got out a muggle cigarette to smoke on his balcony with a glass of firewhiskey. It was an awful habit he picked up in France, but he had about one to two cigarettes a month.
Harry stopped at the parlor door. He expected to be stopped. He kept his body turned away from Draco.
It’s a glut of lust and satiation. Draco’s hard all the time. He wears too-tight briefs to keep his hard-on tucked away, and when he can, he shows him to supply closets and once, a stairwell. When there’s a department head meeting that Harry excuses himself from, Draco watches him leave the conference room from his open office door, and he has to have him. He has to fuck the mighty head auror, the
“You don’t mean that. You’re just upset. It was just a fight. We fight all the time. You need to take a few days to cool off.”
Every morning, he has breakfast since it’s brought to him. Neech tries to deliver lunch and dinner, but he forbids it. It’s the only meal that he can bring himself to eat.
He imagined Blaise had not insisted on his attention because their last few interactions had been more than favorable, as far as Blaise was concerned. They had enthusiastic morning sex, only last week, and shared a steamy kiss, the following Wednesday. Draco had kissed him that night, like a man desperate to prove himself. Meanwhile, Blaise had reverted back to impassivity, the way he knew was preferred, waiting for Draco to make the next move, as he always did.
They get upstairs and Draco leads Harry to the bathroom and runs the tub. Harry looks tired and still seems quiet, as if the alcohol has flattened him—or Draco has. The water runs while they stand by it, not thinking to use their wands.
“We have to be getting back to work Draco. We took an early lunch and just finished up. Jacob is a new trainee in the DoM with me. I’m overseeing his training.”
Draco lay naked on the bed, on his stomach. Harry drizzled the oil over his skin and gently messaged the back of his whole body, from his trapezius down to his feet. Draco moaned in pleasure throughout. It reminded him of the very first time they had sex in Turkey. Draco gave him a massage just like this, before he took his virgin hole, for the first time. When Harry worked back up towards his ass, he moved his oily fingers inside the cleft, across his hole and dipped his fingers inside a few times. He groaned as he squeezed the firm glutes in his palms.
She nodded and got up to leave, closing the door behind her. Draco threw up the typical locking and silencing charms.
Draco had never known anyone so brave and good. He suddenly felt awed by him, remembering his cowardly self at seventeen. He knew why people venerated him wherever he went, but it hit him harder now. Without him, the whole world would be in the hands of a tyrant. Harry was the great liberator of their generation, destined for greatness as only a baby. He was suddenly saddened by the fact that Harry was choosing to spend his time with someone like him. He deserved better, someone good, loyal, and brave, like him. Draco was none of those things.
After scoping the scene, he immediately began to move towards the door with reckless abandon. Draco dragged him back by his robes harshly, but Harry resisted, intending to simply barrel through. Draco had to pin him down to the ground by his wrists, his body flush against him as he spat,
“Shh…hey, you know what I thought about the other day?” Draco asks. He pulls away and is thankful that there are no tears, but his eyes are watery. He needs to take his mind off this.
Though he dreaded his conversation with Scorpius, Draco felt giddy with this drastic change. He imagined he would be heartbroken and destroyed by it. Instead, he felt free, more free than he had ever felt in his life. It felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from his chest, one he never knew was there. He wanted to whoop with joy, which was strange, for a Malfoy.
When he arrived at the cottage, Scorpius leapt forward to greet him, in surprised delight, and Astoria kissed him on the cheek, in welcome.
Harry kneeling in front of him with his eyes downcast, rubbing his thighs. Watching Harry suck his cock as he looked up at him with a delicious vulnerability, pupils blown. His chiseled back tensing as he slid home for the first time. His scent, his taste, the sensation of his tight hole clenching.
it’s like the sound of synchronized bells, just so fucking beautiful. He’s wasted for him. Draco begins to make strides to his door, without so much as a kiss, but before he leaves, Harry has to know.
Scorpius shrieked in surprised joy, almost falling off his unicorn. He repositioned himself so that their horses stood closer together and reached sideways to hug his father as tight as he could manage. The hug was awkward but it warmed Draco to his toes. He loved his son so much and his only wish was to see him this happy, all the time. He was a fool to have denied him this small thing, for so long. He could not remember what was holding him back.
Draco shook his head to clear it. If Potter wanted to fuck an auror ten years younger, that was his prerogative. It was absolutely none of his business. Draco had no right to be upset. Besides, he had someone to make love to whenever he wanted. That thought gave him comfort. He told himself he didn’t care and went back to work.
Even if Blaise were to welcome him back into his life, he was sure the sex would resume, and that would not be fair to his impending marriage. Draco was both divorced and unattached, but Blaise was engaged, and needed to focus on his new fiancé. He would do that better with Draco out of the picture.
Draco watched him struggle, and with a stinging snap to his ego, he realized that Harry wasn’t going to use his words. Unable to go forward for fear of doing real harm to Harry, Draco dropped the flogger.
Draco did not have the energy to argue with him. Besides, all he wanted to do was hug the man, bury his face in his scent, breathe him in, and worship his body, forever. When Harry fell in step besides him, he felt his heat and his light. He was like a shining beacon of goodness, radiating heat from within. It warmed him and calmed his nerves.
“I’m sorry, Harry. It was before I told you I’m in this. All in. Believe me when I tell you that I’m done with him. I only want you. You’re all I think about when I wake up in the morning, and before I go to sleep. You’re the only person I’ll ever want.”
Harry stroked the side of his face, and a tear actually fell down at the touch, it slid sideways off Draco’s face, to the pillow below.
After that, he gets Draco back. He tries to keep him near. Sometimes, he was too tired to talk, but he would try to to look at him and talk with his eyes.
Harry stood up from the table, the energy building was too much to bear sitting down. He took the collar and threw it hard enough against the wall that the box broke into several pieces and the collar landed pathetically on the ground ten feet away. The clank of the metal against the hardwood floor rang ominously in the hall.
He walked around Harry’s kneeling figure slowly, pacing himself and deliberately hardening his tone of voice.
“You look nice,” Draco accused. Harry didn’t answer, continuing to fiddle with a cuff link, and Draco stepped forward to fix it for him.
“I love you, baby. Please don’t be this way.” Draco looked at him pleadingly and Harry felt weakened by his silver eyes. He stood up, sadly, kissed him softly on the lips and left his office, resigned to defeat.
Draco pulled it out of his fingers to check if anything was hidden inside, then threw it back at him.
“…but you’re still my closest friend and the person I trust above all others. Nothing can ever change that.”
“I requested the criminal we arrested today to be waiting in the interrogation room. Why isn’t he there yet? This was your responsibility.” His tone was brash, loud, and rude. It was clear to everyone who heard him speaking that he detested Draco. He was making a real show of it. He often played up the boss card, these days.
, before he returns to his important meeting with the most important people of government, including the minister of magic. He follows him into the men’s room and fucks him hard enough to rattle the stall door off its hinges. It’s almost a sort of self destruction, but he can’t stop.
“No. That will only make it look worse. I’ll go first. You can arrive a minute or so after me. I don’t want this thing to spiral out of control. It’ll only cause more rumors if we arrive together.”
Draco could have came at his breathy answer alone. Harry knew how much it turned him on to hear the sound of begging.
“And then, I did that to you in your office. I made sure to put on a good show, but I felt awful about it afterwards. I just wanted you to feel one iota of the pain that I was in. Believe me, it didn’t even scratch the surface.” Blaise was breathing hard now, still facing away from Draco.
that you’re just using me. I let myself think otherwise because of the romantic trips and the jealous behavior, but none of it means anything to you.”
Harry looked to the ceiling, praying to Merlin that he meant it. He’d heard it before and they were still in the same fucked up situation, weeks later. Blaise was ruining his life. Eventually, Draco stopped crying long enough for Harry to take him upstairs and put him to bed. His grey eyes were blank and somber as he carefully disrobed him and tucked him in. He wanted to sleep at Grimmauld Place, but knew Draco would probably have a breakdown, so he shucked his clothes down to his briefs and climbed into bed with him at the opposite edge from where Draco lay.
“God, you’re beautiful…I can’t imagine anyone letting you go.” He kisses him again as Draco’s cheeks suffuse with heat. “And that blush...”
“Blaise, you deserve to be happy, no matter who it’s with. I reacted badly as first, I admit. I apologize for that. I want you to know that I support you in this.”
Blaise makes them both a fresh mojito, knowing it’s Draco’s preference on Sunday afternoons. Draco gets really close to him, watching him make it with practiced hands. The smell of him, his fresh cologne mixed with his body’s natural clean scent, hits him hard enough to make him feel light headed. He steps back because it causes a flood of memories to break through. Blaise turns his head to look at him, smiling, as if he knows exactly what he’s thinking.
Harry stood up and used his wand, once more, to heal Draco’s hole, then thrust his cock deep inside with the first stroke, all the way to the hilt.
“I don’t know what I should tell them. I could hardly tell them about our special “terms.” It won’t look good. I wanted to ask you your thoughts on the matter.”
Draco’s thick cock feels so good inside him that it instantly burns away every coherent thought. That peaceful blankness is what he’s after, and he moves over him with abandon, working him hard and fast, undulating his body with expertise. Every thrust of his hips empties his mind and he feels nothing except the sweet swarm of pleasure coursing through his body. The head of his leaking cock is scraping Draco’s hard toned abs, leaving a trail of pre-cum behind. It looks sort of beautiful glistening on his perfect porcelain skin, so beautiful that Harry can’t look. He closes his eyes as he moves over him, and for several minutes he’s moaning like a bitch in heat, but he doesn’t care. When he opens them, he sees Draco watching him with half-hooded eyes, and his hands are behind his head as if he’s lounging at the beach, but his expression isn’t relaxed. His eyes are furrowed like he’s in pain, and Harry realizes that despite everything, Draco is wounded by his love for him too.
It did make Draco think that, perhaps, a play date was in order between himself, Scorpius, Albus, and Harry. He shook his head of thought quickly, however, thinking it would make their affair too personal, if they involved the children.
“I don’t think a Dominant/submissive relationship is best for us. Can we please go back to the way we were? Everything was fine between us.”
Harry smiles wide and shoves Draco’s chest. He’s still weak so Draco doesn’t even move, but he grabs Harry’s hand and kisses his palm, then strokes his cheek with it. They lock eyes and Harry feels that inner pulling sensation, the one that he felt after he was plugged up all day, when he realized he was no more than a slave. This time, he feels no fear. No insecurity. He has his Draco back, and he knows he’s going to be better for him. Everything feels right again.
He was playing dirty. He knew nothing pleased him more than to tie Blaise up to the headboard, his body stretched taught, completely under his power. They had not done rope play in a while.
“Draco…before we start, I just want to tell you that I love you, and that I will always love you, until the day I die. You are the best father to Scorpius, better than any mother could ever hope for.”
Though Draco half-expected this, he didn’t expect his world to feel like it was crashing down around him. He did something he thought he would never do in his life, again.
He lay down with his eyes closed and suddenly felt a cooling gel pad on his forehead. He felt warm fingers stroking his inner wrist. He cracked open a bloodshot eye to
Questions were shouted at him from all angles and cameras flashed relentlessly. Draco could hardly see in front of him as the flashes blurred his vision. He could not walk two steps in front of him, as he was completely surrounded. He did not expect this. He felt another panic attack coming on.
“Never made it to dinner with the kids. Too busy getting zonked.” He threw back his glass like a shot and poured another.
Even if Harry could be taught the rules of Dom/sub play, Draco could not see him as a submissive. It just wasn’t in his eyes. With all his raw power, strength, and utter defiance, he imagined he would gravitate towards being a Dominant, if anything at all.
He reached over his to his wand to cast a cleaning charm to his hole and conjure oil. He spread it all over Harry’s back. He massaged it in deeply, almost lovingly, going up to his trapezius all the way down to his ass, letting his fingers slip between the cleft to stroke his hole.
Yet, the man had been well-trained. Training takes enormous effort on the part of the Dom, and he was sure that Harry would require far more effort than the average man. Training usually begins at the beginning of the relationship, before the tone is set. Blaise took months to learn and he was naturally suited to the job. He always listened to Draco’s commands outside the bedroom, from the start. He respected and revered him, from the very beginning of their friendship. The Dom/sub tone was always there.
He immediately filed a report for embezzlement, being as detailed as possible, so that Nott could not escape persecution. He referenced the evidence and made a magical copy of the financial statements, to submit with the report. He mentioned Astoria was helping him, but drew a picture of his wife as being a loving mother with a soft heart, who was hook-winked and pressured by the quidditch star. He was angry with his wife, but still, he did not have the heart to press charges against her and put Scorpius’ mother in Azkaban.
Harry stood up, unsteady on his feet. Draco noticed he was red all over. He looked like he was about to collapse.
Harry did not sound happy, but Draco was busy, still working his neck when he let his hand dip lower to stroke his cock. He was hard already. Draco smiled, but Harry stilled his hand and brought it back up to his stomach.
Draco gasped in pain. Though Harry had used the stretching and lubrication charm, it wasn’t enough accommodate his girth. Draco was still new to bottoming. Harry knew this.
They parted at the lifts. Draco went up to the DMLE floor while Blaise went down to the Department of Mysteries.
He pulled down his boxer briefs and put Draco’s clothed cock directly on his naked skin, between the cleft of his ass and moved around. Draco groaned at the feeling. He was painfully hard and hadn’t been a top for months now. He was tempted. His defenses were always weakest in the morning because that was when he was most horny.
Harry is boneless and spent, his cock still half hard when Draco fixes up his pants for him. His legs are shaking. He lets out a tremulous breath and tries to speak, but nothing comes out.
He rubbed Harry’s wet, softening cock all over his lips and mouth, caressing his cheeks with it. He kissed the head tenderly, and lay his head on his thigh, turning away from Harry’s gaze.
When Draco opened his eyes, he was met with blue orbs, not green, and to his horror, his cock began to wilt inside Blaise’s body.
but quickly bent forward, arching his back, so that his face pressed into the mattress and his ass was high in the air. He put his hands behind his back as if an invisible rope tied his wrists together, then spread his legs as wide as they could go, slightly squatting.
Draco couldn’t believe the man sitting across from him. Cocky and conceited, Harry just smiled at him from across the table with that boyishly handsome grin. That smile could melt ice, and he felt his heart soften, but ignored it. Draco needed to regain control.
his screams, a mixture of pleasure and pain. By the twentieth stroke, Blaise was shooting his cum all over the floor, with only the pressure of the padded bench beneath him and the whip wielded by Draco’s hand.
Draco just stared at her. Astoria was always a terrible liar. He had to call his finance man first thing, tomorrow morning, for a complete audit, and then hire a private investigator to look into Nott’s accounts.
He was angry now. This was a sensitive topic. He was reminded that he could not fuck Blaise, even if he wanted to.
Why did you move away from me in the bed?” He slaps and grabs his ass hard enough to hurt. Harry groans.
“Astoria deserves someone who loves her. Scorpius will have two houses, twice the amount of love. He’s older now. He’ll be fine.”
He wanted to be home in time to tuck in Scorpius. Besides, he had just fucked Blaise eight ways from Sunday this past weekend and had an interlude with him this morning. Worst of all, his mind was full of Harry.
He turned towards the horse to hide a blush as he pet Prince’s silky white mane. Harry came up behind him and grasped his buttocks. His hands were large enough that they grasped all of it, at once.
Running the leather softly across his bottom, he heard Blaise draw in a breath of anticipation. He let the leather caress his cock. He flinched at the first blow, not knowing when to expect it.
Harry and Draco went to the parlor. Draco poured them each a night cap and sat down, staring at the fire.
Draco wanted to tell him to go fuck himself, in response, but he knew Harry needed this, as a form of catharsis. He started breathing through the pain, and then Harry hit his sweet spot. Slowly, the pain started morphing into pleasure.
He turned on the spot and disapparated them both straight into the bedroom. With a snap of his fingers, their clothes were gone and Harry climbed on top of Draco.
He knocked softly, and entered. When Harry caught sight of him, his whole body tensed, and he kept his eyes down.
Unable to curb his curiosity, he turned around to look at his neck. Harry waved his hand to let the glamour fall away.
Draco paled. He immediately began to imagine the horrors Blaise had experienced, going to a BDSM club as an unclaimed submissive. With his devastatingly good looks and surrendering blue eyes, he was vulnerable in such a club and completely unsafe.
Harry’s eyes narrowed at him as he stepped closer to the table. Draco felt blanketed by his angry magic. He was sure Blaise felt it too because he saw him withdraw slightly as Harry put his hands on the table and looked straight into his eyes with pure loathing.
Draco is lost in thought all through dinner, but Harry doesn’t badger him, sensing he’s pushed him too far today already.
Draco smiled. He was finally getting under Harry’s skin. He’d never seen the man so nervous and subdued. He only hoped it wouldn’t be too much for him. He slipped a black collar around his neck. Harry’s skin broke out in goosebumps all over. Licking his lips, Draco relished his sensitive response.
Draco did not know, exactly, what he would say to Blaise as he descended the stairway to meet him for lunch, for the first time that week, but he was determined to deliver the news today. He avoided the lifts because they were always crowded during lunch time.
Blaise remained silent. Perhaps he was shocked at hearing Draco use this pet name again, or he was just really tired.
Draco felt close to tears from frustration. Blaise started to panic when he saw his eyes water. The water threatened to spill over.
He had the decency not to smile at that, as he and Shacklebolt were good friends and reporting him would have little affect.
“Listen Malfoy, I’ve been thinking about this, about you, for a long time, ever since I saw you with Zabini…I just want to know what it’s like.” He stepped closer to caress Draco’s arm.
WARNING: episodes with non-con/rape elements can be found in this chapter. Proceed with caution or skip this chapter.
Astoria, sensing a temper tantrum coming from Draco, worked to change the subject quickly. The subject of Harry always put him in a dreadful mood.
Harry’s not a talker. He doesn’t know if he should pry, and besides, he has a pretty good idea of what’s going on in his head. He moves over to him slowly, wraps himself around him from behind. He kisses his nape and strokes Harry’s back until chills move in the wake of his fingers.
Yet, even at work, where he excelled above all others, Draco was not favored, as was to be expected. Most of his colleagues regarded him with grudging respect, but certainly did not ask him round’ the pub after work.
the fucking memories keep breaking through. Not that he’s tempted, but Draco thinks it’s best to maintain distance, so he takes a seat on his green velvet couch. It suddenly dawns on him that he purchased one just like it for his own home, recently. He always loved Blaise’s style.
“Listen Draco, you don’t have to be nice to me. I understand if you want to end this, now. I won’t stop you.”
Potter took a long time to look up and answer, and when he did, Draco was surprised to see vulnerability there. Rather than looking angry as Draco expected, he just looked sad and smaller, somehow. He cleared his throat to speak.
Nearing his door, he thought it was safe to pull out Harry’s letter to reread. As he entered, smiling, he shut the door behind him without looking up.
“Yes.” Draco cleared his throat because his voice was broken. “Yes it does. You have no idea how much.”
When they spotted Harry, almost everyone there greeted him enthusiastically while Draco was left sulking behind him, mostly trying to hide. He hated public places that were full of his colleagues and avoided them at all costs.
Draco was surprised that Scorpius was behaving very shyly, attached to his leg. He put a hand on his shoulder to comfort him. After badgered his father for months, insisting on this play date, he was acting like he did not want it anymore. They had written to each other almost every day, becoming best friends via owl, and now it seemed surreal that they were seeing each other in real life.
“Blaise, how can you say that? You’re one of the most important people in my life. Do you think I would take just anyone to Rome for the weekend? I haven’t even done that for my wife. I would do anything for you. Please.” his voice lowered into a lustful whisper towards the end.
Blaise unintentionally let out a sigh of relief and released his hand. Draco allowed a soft smile all the way to the bathroom. Blaise was putting on a show for him, just like Harry. It was all a farce. Was there anyone in his life that didn’t play games?
Draco looks up into his pleading gaze and he looks so sad, so beautiful in his heartbreak, that Draco just wants to hug him, so he does. He stands up to embrace him. Blaise pushes his face against his cheek, his body tight against Draco's.
Harry worked quickly to unbutton Draco’s trousers, desperate to get to his cock. When it was freed, he moved down and buried it in his mouth, right away, as far as he could take it, and began to suck with intense suction and speed. He moaned around his cock, sending shockwaves of desire through his body, and Draco squeezed his eyes shut, tight, at the dizzying sensation. He was complete lost to lust. He had not a single thought in his head, besides cumming down his throat.
“…I’m so sorry about today, Draco. I’ll never say such things again. I love you. You know that, don’t you?”
“You’re not interrupting.” Harry tapped her hand to stop and she looked up at Draco, narrowing her crystal blue eyes at him, and walked out of his office, closing the door behind her.
They both let out a collective groan. Draco paused there, bracing himself up on his forearms on either side of Harry. He was already close to cumming. He bent down to kiss Harry tenderly as a distraction, swirling his tongue around his mouth, making them both dizzy.
“I don’t want you to be friends with him anymore. The guy knows how to manipulate you. He’s in love with you. You shouldn’t be around him if you don’t feel the same…do you feel the same?”
Suddenly, there were scratching sounds on the front door. It was locked, but someone or something was desperate to get inside. The scratching sounded like claws, and Draco caught sight of a snout sniffing wildly in the gap between the door and the floor.
would there be no end to these heavy temptations? He had completely forgotten how much more sexually liberated France was, compared to England. Fucking that attractive man in the bathroom was no longer an option, with Harry in the picture, but he definitely considered it.
“Yea…I wanted to go home for a bit, for lunch and to grab the potion. Not feeling like myself. Sorry about this morning. I wanted to see if you could take over in case I got late coming back, but I’ll just wait till end-of-day. Do you need a potion for the headache?”
Draco was starting to feel a slight twinge now. Though he was stretched from earlier, he felt raw inside. Harry’s two loads, from earlier, however, made his passage slick, and Draco still enjoyed every stroke.
When Draco woke up, he was on his side, curled around a body in front of him. His arms were wrapped around Blaise and his body was flush against his. He realized that the thing that woke him was Blaise’s ass, wiggling against his erect cock. Draco cursed his morning wood and tried to pull away.
“Don’t be ridiculous Potter. It was completely casual. Besides, there’s nothing to tell. Blaise and I ended it this morning.”
Harry looked slightly embarrassed and looked towards his feet. Then he looked up at Draco, hands up in a surrendering pose. He dropped them, crossing his arms and just openly stared at Draco while he finished up a report on his desk, quill flying across the page, paying the man no regard.
Lunch was a quiet affair. Draco didn’t know what to say to Harry to make it better. He hardly knew what to make of it, himself.
The conversation goes dead. Blaise leans back in his leather chair with his hand cupping his chin, staring at Draco’s expression. Not for the first time, he curses their long friendship because he knows Blaise can see right through him.
Harry stepped inside and closed the door behind him. It appeared he was going to be merciless today.
When they arrived in Turkey, Draco was shocked by the sheer amount of people everywhere. The entrance to the Wizarding Bizarre was inside an abandoned mosque that look dilapidated from the outside. It was missing one of the pillars. There was a new shiny mosque right next to it.
swirled his tongue around Harry’s nipple and he jumped. It seemed to be a sensitive spot so Draco spent some time sucking and licking both nipples before moving lower.
He pulled out his badge slowly, placed it on the table, and walked out of the door, with his head held high. He left his job behind
“Harry, I chose you. And I tell you all the time it wasn’t a choice. If I still wanted Blaise, I could have him, but I don’t. You’re the only one I want. I miss him as friend sometimes, but that’s all. I certainly don’t miss him enough to invite him back into my life. I’m doing everything I can to show you how much I love you. You’re letting a meaningless piece of paper destroy us.”
“Draco, please. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for being human. I know you think of me as a perfect, unfeeling, pureblood wife, but I have needs, just like you do. Please don’t punish me for that.”
Draco stepped around his desk to look at him. He was looking in the general direction of Draco, but he was unseeing.
Working with him would be impossible without wanting to fuck him for the rest of his miserable life. That would not lead anywhere good. Harry breezed in like a tornado, and suddenly, Draco was upending his entire life.
“Draco, are you all right?” He reaches up to touch his cheek, but Draco smacks his hand away. No matter the reason, his behavior is inexcusable.
Astoria had fed the lie to Scorpius that he was on a work trip, and he didn’t blame her. He would have done the same thing.
He started rammed into him at a punishing pace, reaching around to stroke Harry’s cock as he felt his own orgasm rising up in him. The headboard was banging against the wall. All it took was one stroke of Draco’s hand on his cock for Harry to shoot jets of cum on the mattress below him.
Harry can’t wait any longer. He needs to feel him. He craves the sharp sting and burn of his heavy cock breaching his entrance, so he impales himself onto it, sinking himself fully, and they both moan. Leaning his hands back on Draco’s thighs for leverage, he begins to move.
“The first thing you’re going to need to learn is that you can’t act out when you’re angry. You must always be respectful of your Dom, even out of play. You need to control yourself. Being a good sub at its core is about discipline. Discipline your mind. Control your emotions.”
“Wait a tick. Since when do you need to get so dressed up to see Hermione and Ron? And isn’t it late?”
He took a seat. Draco turned to pour them both a glass a firewhiskey, thinking they would need it. He handed one to Harry and sat opposite him, crossing his legs.
He steels himself and steps towards the kitchen. Something’s weird about the space. As he reaches the kitchen counter, he realizes: it’s quiet. If he’s here and distracted by her, why is it so quiet?
Harry’s cock was trapped on the ground, unable to be reached, but it seemed that Draco’s command was enough. He orgasmed with a harsh cry, squeezing deliciously around Draco’s cock. It immediately tipped Draco over. His orgasm tore through him with a shout. It was, almost, a painful experience.
He rubbed his naked, erect cock across Draco’s hole, but he did not enter. Draco loved every second of Harry’s tender worship, but he needed to be breeched. He needed that sharp burning sensation to fully bring him back to being Harry’s Draco. He pushed his ass up high and moved it slowly around, teasingly.
Harry smiled warmly at him, mocking him. He knew Blaise had to miss Draco every single night he was apart from him. The platinum haired man was like a siren, and his call would make any man crash their ship into the sharp rocks and happily plummet to their drowning deaths, just to be near him.
he forgot how much this truly pleased him. Harry was submitting to him and he’d never been more turned on in his entire life. He thought this would be more difficult to do to someone he loved, someone like Harry, but he was wrong.
Harry was slamming backwards now and Draco was forced to pick up the pace. He changed his angle to hit his prostate and Harry shot jets of cum all over the the shower wall, dragging Draco’s orgasm out him. He grunted as he came inside of him, then exited. Cum splattered the floor.
Their little interlude yesterday caused Draco to arrive home that night with a broken hand and a raging boner.
Draco stood and directed him to his dresser where a myriad of tools were laid out, neatly. Draco took time explaining to him the differences between them.
Besides being physically taxed from the trip, he was emotionally drained, to the point where he felt he might collapse at any moment. This had been the longest week of his life.
Draco used his wand to cast the preparation charms and entered him swiftly. Blaise moaned. He bit Blaise’s shoulder as he thrust upwards.
It was that flat-faced stranger, a man he’s never met before. He remembers enough from his drunken Sunday to know that the news about Blaise transformed him, and he was slipping further away. If he didn’t have this taken care by the time he returned on Saturday evening, then all would be lost. He’s sure of it.
