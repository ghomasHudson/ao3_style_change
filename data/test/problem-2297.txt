“It just happened. There's no rhyme or reason as to why people start dating. Harry and I both admitted that we had feelings for each other and decided to act on them."
His eyes traveled over to the mahogany desk on the other side of the room. Next to my desk, was a floor to ceiling bookcase, completely full. His eyes passed over where my violin stood in a glass case next to the full length windows. He paused for a moment. “You play?" He asked, indicating the violin with a nod of his head. I nodded. He went back to examining my room, and I noticed that he was looking anywhere else but at the king-sized bed that stood in the center of my room. My bed gave evidence of me being a former Slytherin; a large green canopy covered the top and deep green curtains hung around it.The comforter was a silver color and so were the silk sheets beneath it. There were even dark green pillows on the bed.
Harry chuckled softly. He fastened his belt and sat down to pull on black boots. “Well, I don't think you want to stay up that late. Sometimes the bar doesn't close until after four a.m."
“I thought you said you were busy and couldn't come today," Hermione accused.
“Are we all here?" Hermione asked, looking at Harry across the table.
“Hello, Father. You're looking..." he cut me off before I could finish.
“I don't know what else to think. It seems like all you are doing lately is pushing me away. You won't sleep with me anymore." I cried. I brushed away the tears that were welling up in my eyes.
I edged forward cautiously. Harry glanced at me over his shoulder before turning his attention back to the open air. As I approached him, my right hand began to cramp and sting, which I knew was his actual pain from where he had struck my father. I stepped up next to him and looked out over the open water that surrounded the prison.
“I had it specially made. The rubies will change color depending on your mood and the emerald will change color depending on my mood." He took the box from me and, with a wave of his hand, he levitated the box onto my nightstand.
“No, Draco. I want to prove my love for you," Harry said. He snapped his fingers, and his bottle of lubricant flew up from the floor. I reached for it automatically, but Harry caught it first. “Not this time," he whispered.
“Glad you asked Theo. Harry and I decided that we're going to show you a fun day without magic. Muggles have fun all the time. They go to movies, amusement parks, arcades, and all kinds of things."
“I brought an extra set of clothes with me. They were shrunk down in my pocket. If you hadn't made a move last night, I would have," I said, shamelessly letting my eyes travel over his naked chest.
“Yeah. I specialize in farm animals. You know horses, cows, pigs. Things like that," Chase said. He held out his hand to me. I shook it briefly.
“That reminds me, should I be worried about the gift he brought?" I asked looking over to the large pile of presents on the table near the windows.  George's gift was easy to spot; the hideous purple wrapping paper with the gold letters stuck out like a sore thumb.
I felt the familiar tightness in my my groin, before I was spilling my seed between our bodies. Draco cried out and then I felt him shudder before he released himself deep inside me. He collapsed against me, both of us breathing heavily.
Instantly, I knew something was wrong. I immediately stepped closer to him and placed Rose into his arms. He cradled her in his left arm, and brought his right hand up. He gently pressed two fingers against Rose's tiny throat. A small choking sound began to escape from her lips. Her little body began to heave slightly as if she was going to throw up. Draco turned her over, pressing his two fingers between her shoulders. He gently pushed them towards the base of her neck.
“Hey Bill," I said as I stepped up beside him.
I smiled. They had told me when they first found out that Hermione was pregnant that they wanted me to be the godfather to their baby. Their baby was now my second godchild. I was also the godfather to Professor Lupin's son, Teddy, who was being raised by his grandmother, Andromeda.
“Oh, things are the same. The Carrows are still threatening that one day, a new Dark Lord will rise and finish what Voldemort started. And then today, there was a slight issue between Auror Jensen and..." she paused as her eyes passed over to me, as though noticing me for the first time. Her cheeks darkened and she looked down at her desk.
I hung my head. “Look, I know it was stupid of me to go out with Chase, not once but twice, and I know it was stupid for me not to apologize to Harry right away. I hurt him. I promised Harry I wouldn't hurt him, but I did," I said, looking out the window at the house before I looked back at Ron.
“I want to show you these memories so you can see that if anyone deserves to feel guilty, its Lucius. He caused Draco more pain than you ever could have. Yes, you caused Draco physical scars, but I know he still suffers from the emotional scars that Lucius left him with. You have no real reason to feel guilty anymore; the wounds on his chest were healed long ago, and you were not responsible for the damage to his wrists."
He was chuckling as he took the book from me. He cast a brief spell on it with his wand. “So we can find it later," he said as he tucked the book into the box at his feet. “But seriously, if your finding books that you haven't seen in, what eight months, I guess you don't look at this bookcase very often," he continued.
He stepped aside so I could pass him. He grabbed my arm just as I put my foot on the stairs. “Listen to me very carefully, Harry. Seamus and I aren't going to stand for the way your acting much longer. We know that you still have feelings for Draco. If you don't want to make up with him, fine! I won't sit by and watch you push away your best friends. If you don't contact them soon, I will!" He growled. He released my arm and walked over to where Seamus was still sitting. He helped him to his feet, and together, made their way out into the bookstore. I stormed up the stairs and made my way to my room.
So far, it had been a pretty good day.
I followed the pathway around the Manor like he said. “Why is there a garage underneath the Manor?" I asked, as I followed the path directly into the underground garage.
He looked into my eyes for a moment. “I want you to say what it is that you want. I need to hear it out loud."
“It's a Muggle sports bar. They make a lot of chicken products, but they also have burgers, salads and many other items. Plus, they don't really care if you come in on a date with someone of the same gender," he answered. As we passed by the windows, Harry paused, staring into the building. “Oh, I forgot that he worked here," he said.
Narcissa gave me a look that seemed to be full of regret. “If you insist. Just remember Harry; years of verbal abuse, as well as physical abuse, leaves behind deep emotional scars that can be just as bad as a physical scar," she answered quietly.
“No, I want you to come. It's just that, I know Father won't be happy to see you."
“I figured I'd let you choose which of those you wanted to keep. I know we both bought them, so l wanted you to have your pick," Charlie said from the couch.
----------
“I'll check on Patrick later. Robards, Briggs, go bring Mr. Malfoy to the interrogation room. After all, that's why we're here in the first place; so Draco can visit his father," Kingsley said. The two Aurors turned and disappeared through the door on the left.
“So, Steve, can you go get Carlos now?" Hermione asked, drawing his attention away from me.
“Thank you," I said to her. I headed down the hallway she had directed me towards. I was about halfway down the hall, looking at my feet and lost in my thoughts, when I plowed right into someone. I about fell over, but whomever I had ran into grabbed my arm and steadied me.
“Yes I did. Considering that my car isn't big enough, there will be a vehicle for me to drive waiting next to your car."
“Left you? What do you mean he left you?" She asked. She honestly looked confused, like she didn't know if I was telling her the truth.
“That's because I'm on probation and my magic has been blocked by the Ministry," I heard a voice say. I turned my head to find Carlos standing next to the door. He didn't look to pleased to see me or Hermione.
“Good evening Mr. Malfoy. Want your usual tonight?" Marko asked when I finally reached the end of the bar. He held out his beefy hand.
My stomach heaved when another memory showed Lucius once again using the Cruciatus Curse on Draco when he was sixteen because Draco had finally admitted to Lucius that he was gay. Along that same time, Narcissa had stopped him as he cut into his wrists again, babbling about never being good enough to please Lucius. When the memories turned to where Voldemort was living in the Manor, the hatred churned through my stomach when I watched Draco get tortured by Voldemort, and Lucius just stood by and watched without any emotion on his face. I couldn't take anymore of it. Narcissa pulled us both from the Pensieve when I admitted as much. Without a word, I turned and bolted from the room, running as fast as I could until I was out in the Manor grounds, running towards the Quidditch pitch.
“I'm NOT CHEATING!!!" He roared.
“Not necessarily. How about this; I'll move out of the Manor for now so that we can work on becoming friends. If, and when, we decide to get back together, I'll move back in," Harry suggested.
“You knew they were coming?" I asked.
I turned back to the bookcase. I began pulling books from the shelves. I passed them to Draco and he packed them away in the box. It took two boxes before I had collected all of my books. As Draco placed the lid on the box, I stepped towards the fireplace and looked at the trinkets on the mantle.
“Not at all, Harry dear. At least someone is thinking about her," Mrs. Weasley said. She raised her wand, and a tray appeared in the air next to me.
“I think I actually can, if that's what you both want. Or I can at least get him to listen to you about what happened," she said.
He tumbled us onto his bed with me landing on top of him. He slid his arms up my back and pulled me down to his lips. I moaned against his lips, before I slid my tongue into his mouth. He suddenly lifted his hips and thrust against me. I gasped when I felt his hard erection rub against my own.
(Personal note: This chapter takes a weird turn. I hope this satisfies my readers who thought Harry got off too easily for how things turned out between him and Draco.)
“Draco's not such a bad guy. Give him a chance."
“Charlie burned that bridge when he cheated on me with Flint. Sure I cheated, with Draco, but it was a one night stand and not a three month affair. I would rather go up against an angry hippogriff than date him again," Harry said vehemently.
I retreated from him, backing myself towards the wall. “Blaise, stop. I'm not going to do this. I won't hurt Harry like that," I said as he advanced closer to me.
I pulled back after a moment. “Can I ask you something?"
An evil glint appeared in his green eyes. He raised his hand and pushed his glasses up his nose. “You know, I can help you stay still," he said. Before I could question him, he snapped his fingers. Almost at once, my arms were pulled above my head and my legs were pulled towards the end of the bed.
"No, you're not a china doll," Draco said as he pulled out and thrust back in again. "You're far more precious."
The next thing Harry knew, he was on his back on the warm grass and there was something soft in front of his face. He blinked, startled, and swiped at the thing in front of him. As he knocked it he realised that it was a hat, and that awareness made him frown--none of his family cared about him enough to offer him protection from the sun which he’d apparently fallen asleep in.
Harry beamed, and leaned forwards to press their lips together. Draco sighed, contented. He didn’t think he’d ever grow tired of feeling Harry’s lips against his.
“Darlings, please take your poor attempts at flirting to the sea,” Pansy said, fanning herself with a Spanish fan.
Blaise nodded in agreement. “My current paramour is a lawyer, and I’m sure she could get us off after I’m done getting her off.”
“Draco,” Harry said, licking his lips as though savouring the taste of Draco’s name on his tongue. “A bit pretentious, but it suits you.”
“You can ravish me as often as you like,” Harry said softly. He reached his arms up to hook around the back of Draco’s neck and tugged him closer until their lips were inches apart. “You can try again now, if you like.”
Men clad in nothing but tight leather trousers, and women in leather corsets and tiny leather shorts danced sultrily in metal cages suspended from the ceiling, while others swung around on poles.
He could hear Draco shuffling about for something, though his focus remained entirely on eating Harry out, before a slick finger was pushed inside Harry alongside Draco’s tongue.
Harry smiled, and cast his gaze back to the ceiling again. “Don’t worry,” he said. “I’m not.”
Harry’s face fell, and his fingers tightened around Draco’s. “Are you breaking up with me?”
He hissed in pain as he shook his leg, pleased despite the pain, because his aching leg could only mean that he wasn’t dreaming.
“So there’s photographic proof of this monster?” Draco supposed at least that added some credibility to the theory.
The problem was, as much as Draco liked seeing Potter smile, he also liked riling him up. It was especially good that they were able to banter without drawing wands on one another now—he got to wind Potter up with no risk to himself.
“You can fuck me, if you want,” Harry suggested, hoping he didn’t sound too pleading.
Dudley buried his face in his hands, and Harry threw his arms around Draco so that he could bury his face in his shoulder.
“Don’t look so sour, you two,” Ginny cried gleefully, throwing her arms around both of their shoulders. Draco quickly shrugged her off, but Ginny wasn’t deterred. “We’re going to have a wonderful time, and you’re going to thank Pansy and I for dragging you out from your sad little lives.”
“I’m an inch shorter than you!” Harry protested, but Draco shot him a smirk and ignored him.
The day had gotten hotter since the morning, and was perhaps the most humid it had been since Harry had arrived in Italy. Even the shade of the tree did little to stave off the almost unbearable heat.
Harry shivered as nimble fingers pinched his nipples lightly, and he felt Draco smirk against his neck. The fingers trailed further down, closing around his hard cock. Draco's thumb brushed over the head, making Harry squeeze his eyes shut in pleasure. Draco's every touch was far more gentle and soft than Harry had ever known it, yet somehow it had only increased the pleasure tenfold. He bucked up into Draco's fist, his body yearning for more.
“Piss off,” Potter shot back, but there was no anger in his voice. “Take your time, bambino.”
“It’s gorgeous,” Harry agreed. “Thank you for bringing me.”
“That’s a lot of big words, Potter, did Granger tell you to say that?” Draco quipped.
“You’re a talented musician, Harry, don’t let that go to waste,” Draco said, and then he was gone.
“Do you mean to tell me that there isn’t even a photo?” Draco asked in astonishment. “At least the Loch Ness Monster had some attempts at evidence, even if they all did fall flat.”
“Yes, I’d like to study music.”
Harry loved the feeling of going home.
“Tell me a lie,” Draco said, his words barely more than a whisper. “Tell me a lie about me.”
me and Potter sleeping?”
“Fuck, yes,” Draco hissed, throwing his head back as Harry grasped his bare cock. “Do you feel how hard I am for you, Harry?”
Harry nodded. “Please.”
“Perfect and
Luna paid more than Draco could have ever hoped for in a job, but rent was expensive. He had no chance of being able to afford his own place, and he’d decided against wizarding landlords from now on. If it came to it, he could hoodwink a Muggle into giving him a couple more days to pay the rent if he found himself in that situation, but he hoped not to be stuck again.
for my liking.”
“Na-ah, not until I say.” Draco pressed the length of his cock between Harry’s cheeks, rubbing against his rim but not pushing forwards. “You’re doing so well, Sweetheart, such a good boy.”
“Pansy’s a lousy cook,” he mouthed, and Harry grinned. “Pansy, darling, I forgot to say but I’m taking Harry out for dinner tonight. He tragically told me he’s never tried caviar, so I had to insist I treated him to some.”
“If you’ll excuse me, Draco, I must be taking my leave from you both now,” Blaise said. “Daphne is finally free from her sister’s company, and I’m eager for some action.”
Draco’s hands reached for his buttons, but before he could undo them Harry surged forwards and captured Draco’s lips with his own. Draco melted into him, sighing contentedly before he pushed up hard to take control of the kiss. His hands caught Harry’s wrists and pinned them against his sides, his body ushering Harry backwards until he felt his hips hit the desk.
Talking with Draco was surprisingly easy, even without using Harry’s finances as a buffer. The wine was leaving him with a pleasant buzz, and Harry found himself leaning closer to Draco across the table, hanging on his every word.
The sun beat down on his exposed skin, and the warmth that radiated across his arms was surprisingly pleasant. Harry had never been abroad before, and as he’d spent a good portion of his life in the Scottish Highlands, hot weather was something of a commodity to him.
“I skimmed it,” Draco said briskly, and Harry rolled his eyes again.
Draco stood up without a word and strode towards the door, pausing to finally look at Harry.
And when they fingers brushed as they both reached for the bill, neither of them mentioned it, but Harry could feel Draco’s touch on him deep into the night.
“That wasn’t what I asked,” Pansy said, giving Draco a pointed look. “It’s okay if you do. I know you two have a history, but that makes it even cuter that you’ve moved past that and found a more meaningful connection.”
"Yes, but—" Harry began to protest, until Malfoy cut him off again.
Draco’s heart dropped into his stomach. “Like what?” he answered quickly.
began in its place.
He disappeared just as suddenly as he appeared, clearly entirely oblivious to Harry’s need to have a moment to compose himself--and adjust his trousers to hide the evidence of his reaction.
"Did your sidekicks make it onto the train without you alright?" Draco asked teasingly, curling his arm around Harry as he slid onto the bed.
“Something is different between you two! You’ve kissed, haven’t you?” she cried.
Draco resisted the urge to pinch himself to see if he was dreaming. He had done so many bad things in his life yet somehow he had ended up with someone as annoying, snarky, and perfect as Harry Potter.
Draco’s cheeks flushed pink, and Harry was touched by the human side Draco tried so hard to hide.
Draco’s look was so intense that Harry felt like he needed to look away, but he didn’t dare. Francesco was murmuring something, but Harry paid him no attention. He pushed his hips back against him, but it wasn’t for Francesco’s sake, but Draco’s.
left a sour taste in his mouth, he knew that Pansy was right. Nobody else in the magical community was going to be offering him a job any time soon, and he’d much rather work with Lovegood than lower himself to embracing the Muggle world. He may have dropped the Dark Lord’s ideals, but he still found the idea of a magicless society somewhat primitive.
Draco rolled his eyes. “We’ve only been home three days, and I’ve been busy. I quit my job, partly because the thought of going back was horrific, but mostly because I’ve grown quite accustomed to spending most of my time with you and wish to continue that.”
Harry laughed. “Patience is good for you.”
An old lady and her husband gave Harry a sympathetic smile, and gestured for him to go ahead of them. Harry double-checked he hadn’t left anything behind before begrudgingly following his family as they barged their way to the exit.
It was one of the most beautiful views that Harry had ever seen, and his heart soared at the sight.
"Excellent." Malfoy nodded, and left to return to his own seat without another word.
“So do you know who else is joining us?”
Though his own art skills were incredibly limited, Harry had come to have a deep appreciation for art of all kinds, and Lecce was an entire city of art.
The planchette remained still for a few moments, and just when Draco was about to make a snarky comment about it, it began to move to the corner of the board until the circle showed the word ‘yes’ beneath it.
“Is there anything I can help with?” Harry offered. “I’m sure I’m not as good at cooking as you are, but I know my way around a kitchen.”
Draco frowned, unsure of how Harry could be so unaware of his own attractiveness.
“Thank you. I still haven’t heard you play anything. Maybe you could play something now?”
Draco had kicked him out of this spot a couple of days prior, but it was definitely the nicest place in the garden, and Draco wasn’t there at that moment.
He was sweating by the time they reached the edge of the lake, and the sparkling water looked incredibly enticing.
Harry shook his head, looking down at the beautifully drawn cards on the counter.
Draco, on the other hand, was homeless, penniless, and bunking in a friend’s spare room because he had nowhere else to go. He’d barely left his room since he’d moved in with Pansy and Astoria, not wanting to feel even more like the pitiful third wheel he’d become.
“Yes, so you can stop trying to push us together now, Dursley,” Draco said, throwing a smirk in Dudley’s direction.
It was a quaint place, with narrow streets and terracotta buildings. It was untouched by tourists, and existed as a pretty village nestled amongst green hills where people lived their day-to-day lives. Harry envied them.
“I think you’d love Italy, Harry! The weather’s gorgeous, and there’s so much story and culture there, especially in artwork. You could even consider it a therapy trip, if you spend most of your time looking at art.”
“Very much so. Even if you’re an impulsive, reckless, little-”
“Yes!” Harry cried. “Please!”
Draco closed his eyes, hoping that maybe when he opened them again he’d wake up in his bed in his dingy apartment and have to get up and ready for his shitty job. Instead, Draco opened them to the sight of the dank hallway and the strip of parchment on his door.
“Hurry up, Boy,” Vernon snapped, shooting Harry an impatient look. “I want to get off this damn plane and I don’t have time for you to dawdle.”
Draco clambered to his feet, frowning at Harry’s sudden change in mood. Harry looked lost, and Draco didn’t think twice before pulling Harry into his arms. He froze as he realised what he’d done, but Harry relaxed in his arms and wrapped his own around Draco.
Draco sneered. “Prove it then. Prove you’re not just some little boy with a silly crush.”
Draco grinned back. “Glad I can be of service.”
“We’re what some would consider friends now,” Draco said stiffly, fidgeting as he felt Pansy and Astoria’s eyes boring into him. “I’m also horrifically attracted to him and I don’t know how to stop myself.”
They stopped for coffee, or rather Draco did and Harry stopped with him because it was only fair, and took a seat on delicate metal chairs in an outside courtyard.
“Why do you still live with them?” Draco asked as they clambered onto the bikes and began to ride. “If I had a relationship like that with my parents, I’d be long gone.”
“I like hot weather more than the cold, believe it or not,” Draco said. “Winters at Hogwarts were murder for me.”
He turned around only to see a house-elf scurrying along. Harry tried to calm his racing heart, telling himself that as a professor he had no curfew, and was definitely allowed to be in the library after hours. Harry had never had this problem at Durmstrang, but because all his time spent previously at Hogwarts was as a student, it was hard to shake that mindset now he was back.
“I don’t get my hopes up about anything, as a rule,” Draco said.
Without giving them a chance to argue, Blaise grabbed Draco and Potter by their wrists to pull them to their destination. Draco hated it as soon as he got down the steps; he could smell the dancer’s sweat, and the floor beneath his feet was sticky.
“Well I don’t like to brag-” Harry let out a short bark of laughter-”but I can safely gather from the noises you were making that I gave you one of the best fuckings of your life. Just wait until I get you to a bed where I can really show you want I’m made of. That’s if you want another go, that is.”
“Draco. A word, please.”
Draco smirked. "I'm sure you will, as noble as you are," he drawled. "Buy two things and we'll have a deal. And just so you know I'm not normally this generous, but it's not everyday that a cute boy comes wandering into my shop."
Draco moaned as Harry pressed his palm against Draco’s cock. Harry’s eyes fluttered shut as he fumbled with the buttons so he could get beneath the barrier of Draco’s clothes.
Tears stung at Harry’s eyes, and he swiped them away angrily before anyone could notice. The Dursleys, of course, paid him no attention, but he noticed Narcissa looking at him with a concerned expression.
“It smells lovely in here,” Harry said, announcing his presence.
When Draco entered, Harry hoped he looked casual and comfortable, and not like he’d just been eavesdropping again.
He didn’t know what it was, but there was something about the word which made him feel all tingly inside. It just felt so…
Draco’s eyes fluttered, and Harry hastily flopped onto his back so he wouldn’t be caught watching Draco. He closed his own eyes, and felt Draco shift beside him.
The counter also held baskets filled with crystals, and with runes, all on offer at
before, but he wanted somewhere Muggle and noisy so that they could talk in private and Harry couldn’t make a scene without embarrassing himself, like one of his ex’s had done when Draco had told him he was trans.
“Good morning, Sleeping Beauty,” Draco said. “I want to go swimming in the lake today.”
. A quick glance around the shop revealed decks of tarot and angel cards, books on white magic, and sticks of incense in hundreds of different scents.
“Fuck, more, more, please,” he begged,shamelessly, grinding his arse to get Draco’s cock deeper. His eyes were almost rolling into the back of his head from the overwhelming pleasure coursing through his body.
Still, he was planning on moving out as soon as he earned enough money, and it would be nice to spend some quality time with them before he left for good. Whether the holiday would allow him to appreciate them, or prove to him why he needed to leave as soon as he could remained to be seen, but Harry reckoned it would be the latter.
"You talk so pretentiously," Harry said, shaking his head in amusement. "But yes, I think avoidance is a good idea, especially as we've already managed to indirectly insult each other."
They had to leave their luggage in a little storage area because their room wasn’t ready, which was another unusual aspect to Draco. All the hotels he’d stayed at were cleaned in quick time by house-elves, magic, or a combination of both. It must be dreadful to have to do cleaning by hand, and it was no wonder Muggles always looked so miserable.
As Harry and I stepped from the fireplace, Harry practically collapsed in my arms. “Harry are you alright? What's going on with you?" I asked.
“Now, where can I floo him?"
“Oh, so he finally moved back there?" Harry asked.
“Now, Harry. I'm ready," Draco panted. He pulled his fingers away and laid on his back. He parted his legs, and as I rose over him, I caught one of his legs and pulled it around my hip. I positioned myself at his entrance and thrust into him. His moan was like music to my ears.
The crackling magic around the room began to intensify as Harry's eyes narrowed further. “Kingsley, can I have a moment alone with Mr Malfoy?" He asked, his voice getting deeper with his anger. He released my hand.
“In fact, Harry's been in a relationship for the last six months," Charlie said, claiming Percy's attention once again.
We walked for about ten minutes, talking about anything that came to mind; the weather, what we had been doing since we graduated from Hogwarts. He talked briefly about Weasley and Granger's baby that he had met yesterday. His face lit up when he talked about the little girl.
“Harry, I-I'm gonna cum," I grunted out.
“No, Charlie said there was still some things I need to sort through," I answered as I rose to my feet. I grabbed an empty box and stepped towards the bookcase.
“Can I ask why you let me ride with you first?" I asked Harry about twenty minutes later when we were climbing into his car.
“He never should have kissed you. He's lucky I didn't cast Cruciatus on him."
“I don't get it, Harry. I thought you and Draco had made up. You look miserable," Ron said.
“He does, and I didn't need Legilimency to know that," Harry said. He reached out and picked up a tortilla chip. He dipped it into the queso. He brought the chip to his mouth and bit down. I watched as his tongue slipped out to catch a drip of cheese that clung to his bottom lip. I took a sip from my lemonade, my mouth going dry.
“Here's what I'm sure of: I want you and I know you want me. Now here's what I'm gonna do; I'm gonna walk out of this bar. Next move is up to you."
“If I see him, you'll be the first one I tell," Seamus said.
She led us to a set of lifts. She stepped into one,  and waited for us to follow her. Ron and I stepped into the lift and the door shut behind us. She waved her wand and the lift shot upwards. When it stopped, the door opened and we all stepped out.
We crossed the parking lot and made our way to the front gates of the amusement park. Once there, Harry paid for six wristbands, assuring us that the bands would allow us to go on any ride in the park. Stepping through the gates, I was amazed at the sheer size of the park; rides made of wood that stretched to the sky, things that looked like plastic animals, and several other things that I couldn't hope to name. Harry and Hermione led the rest of us through the park, Harry holding what looked like a map of the park.
Harry laughed humourlessly. “You wouldn’t do. He didn’t want people knowing his true identity. Tom Riddle was the real name of Voldemort.”
,” Draco snarled. “And I do hope you aren’t implying we’ll be travelling in that
“Yeah, you did fuck up when you were younger,” Pansy said sharply. “So what? You’ve made amends and you’ve suffered more than enough for what you’ve done, so I think you’re entitled to try for some happiness instead of wallowing in your self-pity.”
“I was, for a few days at any rate,” Harry said. “Though that was because of Umbridge’s general hatred of me. Did you know she did me as much lasting damage as Voldemort did?”
Harry's mouth fell open. "At least I never got turned into a ferret."
“It drains their
,” Draco pointed out. “I know you’re probably a sad, innocent virgin, but breeding requires at least two participants.”
Draco put his hands on the wall at each side of Harry’s head, bringing their bodies almost flush together. As Draco shifted again, moving closer, Harry was startled--and pleased--to feel the hard outline of Draco’s cock pressing against his thigh.
“Sod off, you wanker," Harry replied with a laugh.
“Look, Jolene," I started, but she held up her hand. I fell silent.
He nodded. I stood and went over to the foot of the bed. I heard the bed shift as Harry stood up. I glanced over my shoulder and watched him walk over to the bathroom. The door closed. I pulled out my wand and made a table appear in front of my sofa. I levitated the trays and moved them to the table. I sat down on the sofa.
“Harry, it's honestly okay. I've dealt with his behavior since I was a child. Here, let me see your hand," I said.
“Really? You can't lie to me about this Harry; your body is suffering from nicotine withdrawal," I said, pulling back my Healer's energy.
“No, because at that time, they were more concerned about the fact that my godfather had been the first person to break out of Azkaban."
“I want you, Harry. You inside me." With a snap of my fingers, I summoned the bottle of lubricant Blaise had given me at Christmas time. It had remained unopened and on a shelf until now. I caught the dark blue bottle and opened it up. I squirted a large dollop on my fingers and reached between our bodies. I made contact with his penis and began to rub the lube up and down it. He was growing hard in my hand.
“I would love to go out again tomorrow."
The fire flickered, the glow producing small shadows around us. The last of my boxes laid forgotten on the floor as Draco and I lost ourselves in each other.
“Oh, yes. Yes," I moaned thrusting my hips up again, feeling the familiar tightening of my groin. I gasped as I released all over my stomach and his hand. He thrust into me a couple more times before I felt him releasing his cum deep inside of me. He collapsed against me, both of us breathing heavily. Harry raised his head and pressed a kiss to my cheek.
~~~~~
I made my way to the bar where Tom, the innkeeper, was busy pouring drinks for the customers. “Well, Mr. Malfoy. It's been a while since I've seen any of your family here," he greeted when he noticed me.
“You mean that, Harry?"
I turned my attention to the bookcase and I let my eyes travel over the titles of the books before me. I reached for one. “Oh, Hermione will be glad to get this back. I borrowed it shortly after Charlie and I got together. I bet she thinks I lost it," I chuckled as I passed the book to Draco.
“Well, Draco, it looks like I have you at my mercy," he said. With a wave of his hand, my pajama pants and my boxers were gone, leaving my completely exposed before him. His eyes traveled down my body hungrily; there was a predatory look in his emerald eyes. He leaned down and took me into his mouth. I moaned. His hands effectively kept my hips down as he worked his mouth slowly up and down my shaft. Harry sucked lightly around the head of my dick, before swallowing me down his throat. I moaned again and tugged on my bonds. They didn't budge.
“Sure, I know. Not that I'm gonna tell you with him around. Harry's hurting at the moment."
“But Muggles have put their feet in them!" He snapped under his breath.
“I'll have the ultimate club on sourdough with the cheese and broccoli soup."
“No problem Harry. Although, I doubt that there's too many people who would tell you no for something you want. Tell Narcissa that I said hello," Kingsley said.
“Glad you found that amusing, Harry," she said. She turned and made her way over to her desk. It was then that I noticed the shallow basin covered with ancient runes sitting on top of the desk. Narcissa noticed the direction of my gaze. “Harry, do you know what that is?" She asked, indicating the basin with a wave of her hand.
Silence met his statement. I glanced around the room and saw that everyone was staring at me. When Ron saw me looking, he looked away. I couldn't take the hurt expression on his face. After another glance, I noticed that no one was able to meet my gaze. I fought back a sob.
“You don't know that for sure. I still don't think that it happened like you think. Just hear him out about this."
Harry stood from his chair and followed Dempsey from the room. I sighed as I watched him leave. I turned my attention back to my breakfast.
He glanced over my shoulder. “Oh, looks like it's my turn, my friends are waving at me. But, Draco, let me know if you want me to teach you how to play pool later." With that, he winked and walked away.
“That's a lie!" I snapped. I yanked on the buttons of my shirt and two of them snapped off. I quickly fixed them with my wand.
“I honestly never expected to have a birthday party like this. Former Hogwarts enemies actually getting along," I said waving my hand to gesture to the room at large.
I was unaware of how long I sat there picking at my breakfast, when suddenly, a small silvery rabbit hopped through my door. It hopped towards me, barely skimming the floor. Narcissa's voice floated out of it when it paused in front of me. “Harry, I'd like to talk to you. After you have finished your breakfast, will you please join me in my study in the east wing?" The rabbit faded away.
“So, umm, I..I heard about you and Charlie breaking up," Ron said. I paused in the middle of pulling on my shirt and glanced at him over my shoulder. He was looking at the floor.
“Harry, wait. This is going to be over too quickly and I want to enjoy it."
“What did you mean by he'd have better luck setting me up with one of his older brothers?"
“Yeah, my ex-boyfriend Jonas liked it. He said Muggle alcohol was more potent than wizard alcohol. I never had the courage to try it." The light turned green and Harry drove on.
Ginny took a bite from her eggs before she answered. “Their letter said that there were eight of us trying out for the open Chaser position."
He nodded. I brought my hands to the snap of his jeans. I undid the snap and the zipper. Harry raised his hips from the bed and allowed me to slide down his jeans and boxers. I slid them down his legs and slid them right off. I caught his ankles in my hands and removed his socks. As I knelt on the floor in front of him, I couldn't help glancing up at him. I now had a completely naked, and fully aroused
“Honestly, Harry, as long as your happy with Draco, I'm happy for you," she whispered back.
“Good morning," I repeated to him.
Ten minutes after leaving his house, Neville and I sat in an exam room at St. Mungo's, waiting for Dean or Shawnna to come in. I sat on the exam bed holding a bucket in my lap. I was nauseous, but I hadn't puked yet. Neville got up and began pacing the floor in front of me. The door opened and Dean walked into the room.
“Poppy, I need you to bring breakfast up here to my room. I don't care what you bring, just make it enough for two and bring some tea with two mugs."
“Why are you fighting this instead of fixing it with Draco? Merlin knows you've wanted Draco for years, even before you would admit that you're gay."
I raised my wand. With a silent,
“I know that this is only our first date, but why don't you come stay at Malfoy Manor?"
“Yeah it was great. I wonder how many other rides can spin like that?" Theo said.
“No offense taken sir. Even I enjoyed watching Harry deal with him. No one has ever stood up against him like that," I said.
Harry sighed heavily, and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I'll have an ice tea."
Harry wakes up in Draco's bed. He doesn't want his time with Draco to end, but knows that he's betrayed Charlie. He goes home to talk to Charlie and beg for his forgiveness, but when he arrives, he gets an unwanted surprise.
“These shoes are just not fashionable," he grumbled, but he finally sat down and began to untie his laces.
He took a deep breath before turning to face me. “He shouldn't talk about you like that. You're his only son."
I retreated further away from him, until my back hit the wall. Before I could move, Blaise stepped closer and pinned me to the wall with his body. “Blaise, don't do this," I said, bringing my hands up to push him away.
“Want to go out again tomorrow?" Harry asked suddenly.
“Harry," I called excitedly as soon as I stepped out of Neville's fireplace and into his living room.
“Mistress Narcissa requested breakfasts in her room today. She says we is nots to disturb you and Mister Harry," the little elf said.
His gaze snapped back to me. “Why do you want to know? It's not like you even care," he said.
Kingsley moved towards the door. “Minister, can I try to calm him down on my own?" I asked him. He turned to look at me, then he nodded and turned away from the door. I made my way out of the door, past the table with the portkey on it, and down the short corridor to the door that led outside.
“What kind of spells, Draco?" He asked.
I changed the subject by mentioning the Triwizard Tournament. Everyone of them jumped on the subject and that brought about a round of arguing between Harry and Pansy.
Thanks for reading. The next chapter will be ready as soon as possible.
Harry didn't release me until we stepped up next to his Lamborghini. He opened the door for me and I slid into the car. He closed the door and I watched him as he rounded the hood. He opened the door and slid behind the wheel. The engine purred to life as he turned the key. Harry pulled the car out from the underground garage and we drove along the pathway towards the gates.
“Mr. Malfoy. You have a visitor."
Harry reached over and grabbed for a chip. The cheese was melted just right and as he pulled away a chip, the cheese stretched out with it. He laughed and pulled until the cheese finally broke away. Blaise began laughing at the sight of the cheese falling off Harry's chip.
I placed the tray across my knees and turned to look at her. I reached out my hand and placed it against her belly. “Morning sickness gone yet?" I asked.
“Harry, whatever made you or Charlie believe that you couldn't come clean to me?" Ron asked, finally looking at me.
Harry and everyone else in the room began singing ´Happy Birthday', Harry holding my hand the entire time. I felt my face heat up as a blush spread across my cheeks. When they were done singing, I leaned forward and blew the candles. I flicked my wand and both cakes were perfectly sliced. Harry grabbed a plate and put a slice of each cake on it. He grabbed two forks and led me away from the table as everyone else converged on it.
I finally pulled myself away from him. “I'll see you tomorrow, Harry. Have a good night."
, I thought, dropping my wand and picking up my glasses. As I slipped them on my face, I saw her standing at the foot of my bed, Draco standing slightly behind her, looking down at his feet. Dean was next to the door.
“Don't worry. I'm out of here. I'll make sure that Dean and Seamus know not to come up either." With that she waved her wand. The bars disappeared and she ran from the room. As soon as the door closed, Draco's mouth was on mine again. His lips were harsh and demanding.
(See the end of the chapter for
“As much as I'm enjoying that Harry, we really don't have the time luv. You know we have to head to Dad's birthday party," he said. I stared at him for a moment, then went back to placing kisses on his body, getting dangerously close to his erection. He let out a soft chuckle before his hands caught my arms and pulled me up his body. When I was across his chest, he pulled me down into a deep kiss, his tongue sliding between my lips ever so softly. I sighed and relaxed against him.
Draco dropped his arms to shrug out of his ruined shirt. I ran my hands up his back. He caught my hand and tugged me closer to the bed. He maneuvered us around so that when we fell on the bed, he landed on top of me. His lips began placing kisses along my neck. He raised his head and looked down at me. “Gods, Harry, I've missed you so much."
Harry hissed slightly as my magic took affect. I forced the magic through his skin, healing the nerve endings throughout his hand. I gently ran my fingers over his palm once more before I pulled away. Harry flexed his hand a few times before he smiled at me. “Thanks Draco," he said.
“Not all of them were nightmares. But when I did have a nightmare about you, it was because of what happened in sixth year."
“Your not getting away that easily, little brother. Anti-Apparation charms are in place and and there is now a shield around the perimeter. No one leaves until you two fix this," he said, looking at Ron as though daring him to try again.
Harry just grinned again and went back to playing with his phone. No matter how much Hermione pestered him, he merely shook his head, refusing to say whom was coming on our little adventure. As she continued to question him, I noticed that baby Rose wasn't in sight.
“I hear a ´but' in that sentence. Is there something you want to talk to me about Harry?"
“For crying out loud Harry! Just because we haven't had sex lately, your going to suddenly decide that I'm cheating on you!" He yelled.
“Come on in," I called.
“That's a good idea," I said, stepping closer to the bookcase.
I looked up to see Steve Evans standing by the door. He flicked his cigarette out and walked over to us. I smiled and shook his hand. He grinned before pulling Hermione into a quick hug.
(Personal note: thank you all for your support. You all seem to be enjoying reading it as much as I'm enjoying writing it.)
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It'll be ready as soon as possible. If you have a suggestion of something you'd like to see in this story, please feel free to leave a comment. Thanks.
“Are you alright?" I heard myself ask.
Ron sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Look, Draco. If Harry loves you like I'm sure he does, then yes he'll be able to forgive you. Just don't expect it to happen right away."
“I'm in here," she called back.
“Let me leave Harry. We both just need a break."
“I was sort of inspired by the old motto from Hogwarts. Do you remember it?" He asked.
He didn't answer, he just picked up his glass and took a drink. I took a drink from my own glass. We sat there in an uncomfortable silence for a few moments. Suddenly, he looked up at me. “Tell me what you want from me, Draco."
I strolled down the the hallway towards Harry's room. I pushed open the doors and paused. All I could do was stare. Harry was in the process of changing his clothes; I stared and licked my lips as he pulled a dark pair of jeans up his legs.
“So, I guess we head over to the bookstore?" I asked.
Hermione's face flushed a bright red. She glanced down at her left hand for a moment, then looked up at Ron. “I didn't even notice that it wasn't on my hand. It must have fallen into her crib when I changed her diaper." She choked back a sob.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
“Nope," I said. I continued on my way to the door.
I obeyed instantly, bending my knees and spreading my legs a little more to give him better access to my hole. He aligned his lubed up fingers to my entrance. Before I could even blink, he slid one finger deep inside me. I moaned loudly, thrusting my head back against the pillows. He began thrusting his finger in and out of me slowly. I groaned deep in my throat and ground my hips down, trying to bring his finger deeper inside me.
“And when did you find out that she was coming?" I asked, rubbing my thumb across his knuckles.
I snickered as he stood up. With a wave of his wand, his jacket flew out of the wardrobe and into his hand. He slipped it over his shoulders and tucked his wand into his pocket. He picked up his wallet and car keys from his nightstand. I glanced over what he was wearing.
tells me that he doesn't need me tonight and that he'll check the schedule, I'll find a different bar to work at."
“Well, for one, Draco did just save our daughter's life. And for two, I've kinda been anticipating this since we back in school."
“I would never..." Before I could finish my sentence, a silvery stag glided through the door. He pawed the ground nervously before trotting over to me. He opened his mouth and Harry's voice floated out.
“Are you going to fill us in on what we're actually doing today, or are you just going to leave us in the dark?" Pansy asked, sliding onto the bench next to Harry. I slid onto the bench next to Ron, Hermione on his other side. I absent mindedly noticed that we were all dressed in denim shorts and tank tops. I had thought about hiding my Dark Mark when Hermione had told us how to dress, but she said the Muggle world would just think it was a cool tattoo, whatever that was. I turned my focus back to the conversation going on around me.
Percy's ears turned as red as his hair and his eyes narrowed. He sat down abruptly on the other couch. Bill quickly stood up and moved to one of the chairs. Penelope shot him a dirty look before taking the seat next to Percy.
“Draco, if you don't wear these bowling shoes, you can't play. These shoes are designed to prevent you from sliding on the floor," I replied, heading over to a table. I sat down and began to remove my own shoes.
“Why are you acting like this? What is going on in your head? It's like your jealous of me right now," I said. His cheeks darkened as he blushed, and he quickly turned his back on me.
I turned my attention to the two people still standing in the room. Hermione looked like she was ready to explode and knowing her temper, she probably was. “So, you found me," I said, settling back against my pillows.
“You want to have sex with me?" He asked. I couldn't say it, so I nodded instead.
“Get used to them,  Potter. Your moving into Malfoy Manor and we pride ourselves on our appearance. And since I know that Mother will have breakfast waiting for us, it won't kill you to look good."
“As tempting as that sounds, I'm gonna have to say no. You are in a relationship with someone, and I'm not going to come between you," he said.
“Well if your not having sex with me, what am I supposed to think? I just want an answer," I screamed. I brushed away the tears still streaming down my cheeks.
My heart started to pound with an unnatural rhythm. Draco was rejecting me, mainly because of what happened when I left. “Draco, please don't be like that," I said.
I raised my head and looked over at her. She was standing near the fountain with her hands on her hips. “And what's that supposed to mean?" I asked her.
“Well, I see that your drinks are empty, so I'll go get you some more," she said. With that she turned and walked back to the bar.
I felt a blush spread across my cheeks as Draco turned back to look at me. I refused to meet his gaze. “Is that true Harry? You would sneak out of your common room while I was in the hospital wing?" He asked me.
“Do you have a phone?"
“You can blame me for that. I was the one who started the kiss," Draco said. He followed Hermione into the kitchen. After grumbling for a moment, Ron disappeared into the kitchen behind them.
“See what Draco?"
I wasn't sure who made the first move, but suddenly, our lips were pressed together, one of his hands buried in my hair, the other wrapped around my waist. My arms wrapped around his neck as he deepened the kiss, his tongue sliding across my lower lip, begging for entrance.
“I'm glad that things have worked out," she said. She glanced at Draco for a moment, a sly smile on her face, then turned her attention back to me. “You know, my son used to fancy you. I swear, as much as he used to talk about you, I'm surprised you two aren't married yet."
I stepped from the fireplace, brushing soot from my robes. I glanced around the room to see Harry being released from the Minister's embrace. He turned around and smiled at me. The minister and both of the Aurors in the room turned to look at me.
Please wake up, please wake up, please wake up.
“Oh please. He's a Malfoy. Malfoys don't do anything they don't want to do. That's a lesson I learned from his family a long time ago."
“Have you two gone mental? That was the worst thing I've been on all day," Pansy said harshly. She looked a little green. Hermione didn't seem fairing any better. I pressed a hand to my stomach, fighting back nausea.
With a smile, he set the watch on the table next to him and reached for the next present. He opened present after present to reveal a new set of robes from Bill, a candlestick that broke apart when it was lit, only to repair itself when the candle was blown out from George, a tiny dragon statue that curled around his hand before flying around the room from Charlie, a framed photo of the first wand ultrasound of Ron and Hermione's currently unborn child, Ginny and Mrs. Weasley gave him a brand new velvet cloak lined with silk on the inside and Percy and Penelope got him a book about Muggle televisions.
I glanced up from my cellphone, where I had been re-reading the message from Ron. “Sorry," I said, slipping my phone back into my pocket. We were sitting at a table in a Muggle cafe, waiting for Ron to show up. Hermione wouldn't be with him; she was home with Rose. Draco sat next to me and there were two empty chairs across the table. The cafe was filled with happy voices of different families, but it wasn't really busy.
“What happened?" She asked me.
“Mr. Potter. Yes, he told me he was expecting you. Please, follow me," he said. He stepped out from behind the bar and headed up the flight of stairs to his left. I followed him, unsure of where he was going. We went up two flights of stairs and then he led me down a hall and stopped at the last door on the right hand side. He knocked on the door. “Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy is here," he called.
Hermione takes it upon herself to get Harry and Draco back together.
I arched an eyebrow at him, but didn't speak. I knew there was more he wanted to say. After about a minute, he continued. “What I overheard was Percy said ´oh she'll be good for him.' to which Penelope responded ´yeah, Harry and Jolene could make beautiful babies together.' I know you probably didn't want to hear that, but I had to tell you," Charlie finished. He swallowed down the rest of his tea and set his mug on the table.
“Oh, I almost forgot, these are for you," he said, holding out the bouquet of flowers to my mother.
“Shut up you insolent little brat! You're ruining everything that your grandfather worked for! Everything that we have become!" Father growled at me.
“No, it feels good. Just slowly start moving it in and out."
“And can I get you any appetizers, like mozzarella sticks, or do you know what you want?"
“And I forgave myself. But you asked if my dreams about you were nightmares. The only time it was a nightmare was when I remembered that day." His hand covered mine and squeezed it.
Charlie glanced over to him. “Besides the potions, how did you know I was in pain?" He asked.
After laying there for a couple hours and not even getting close to falling asleep, I gave up and climbed out of bed. I wrapped my house robe around my shoulders and belted it around my waist as I headed for my bedroom door. The stone floor was cold beneath my bare feet as I stepped into the hallway. I made my way back to Harry's room and slipped quietly inside.
“Really?"
This chapter alternates between Harry's and Draco's point of view.
“Yes, I am. I appreciate the show," I said.
I knew it was Hermione on the phone. He spoke to her for a few moments, assured her that we were coming to the house so she could meet my boyfriend, then he hung up.
Draco smiled. Then he held Rose out to me. I took my goddaughter into my arms. I sat down in the recliner holding Rose gently. I rocked her in my arms as her eyes drifted closed. Draco perched on the arm of the chair and draped his right arm across my shoulders. We sat there and looked down at Rose sleeping in my arms. Ron had disappeared into the kitchen. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Hermione watching us. I leaned into Draco's embrace as Ron emerged from the kitchen, carrying a tray with mugs of tea. Draco gently took Rose from my arms, and laid her down in the playpen in the corner. He sat back down on the arm of the chair as Ron passed out the tea.
“You would be okay with a bunch of Gryffindors and a few Ravenclaws coming here?" Harry asked, lowering his book against his chest.
“Alright Carlos, talk. Where is Harry hiding? I know you know," Hermione said, opening her eyes and pushing away from the wall.
He groaned before his hands caught my hips and he thrust into me in one smooth motion. When he was fully sheathed inside me, he paused and leaned over me, kissing me deeply. Our tongues slid against each other. Harry withdrew slightly, only to thrust back in. I gasped, pulling away from his mouth as he began his rhythm; slowly pulling out before thrusting back in hard.
“Well, you've said it yourself, nobody seems to trust you. Well, I trust you Draco. I want you to Top me," he whispered. His voice had gotten pretty husky. He reached up with his free hand and pulled me down once more. He kissed me again, catching my bottom lip between his teeth and pulling gently.
“Oh, come on," Ron groaned, understanding why Draco had given me the blanket.
“Hi Draco. You're here early. I wasn't expecting you for another ten minutes at least," he said.
Charlie stumbled out of the room as Draco placed the box on top of the other two. Draco pulled his wand quickly and aimed it at Charlie. “Stay away from him, Weasley!" He growled.
I looked down, unable to meet his gaze. Harry and I were silent for a moment. I was still holding his hand, gently rubbing my thumb across his knuckles. “So, what happens now? Where do we go from here? Is there still an ´us'?" Harry asked.
“Yes, I am Tom. How much do I owe for the month?"
“I don't mind, Harry. I've seen him once since he got locked up and I have no intention of repeating the experience."
broke up with
“What do you mean by that?" I asked.
“Hey, Peter," she called out. I turned my head and watched a man step towards the end of the bar where she was setting drinks for the servers to grab.
Blaise raised his glass. “How about a toast? Here's to, uhh, to making friends with a former enemy." He nodded his head in Harry's direction. Pansy rolled her eyes, but clinked her glass against his. Harry and I raised our glasses into the toast as well.
“Have you seen them?" He asked.
“Well, I hope things work out for you. I know you've always wanted to join that team," I said sitting back in my chair. She smiled before turning back to her breakfast.
The lift came to a halt and the door opened. I stared at him for a moment, then stepped out of the lift. He followed me. Before we got away from the lift, I caught his arm. “I don't believe that, Draco. You're not a Death Eater. You may have gotten the Dark Mark, but you never had the strength to do what they did."
“That's okay Harry. I wasn't looking where I was going either," Draco said. He dropped his hand away from my arm and took a step back. He bent down and picked up the bouquet of flowers he had dropped.
I maneuvered my way through the crowd, looking for familiar faces that I could join. Though I saw several people I recognized, none of them had any room for me to sit down. The throbbing in my hip was getting stronger as I made my way towards the wall; which meant I was getting closer to whomever was hurt. I broke through the crowd, and found myself three feet from where Potter sat.
“Draco, your staring at me," he said.
“Why would I want to learn how to use them?" He asked.
“Anything at all Harry. Just name it," Kingsley said.
“Nice to meet you, Jolene," I said, nodding my head in her direction.
“Good afternoon, Tom. I'm here to meet up with..."
“Harry, are you sure you want to come with me?" I asked. We were preparing to head to the Ministry of Magic.
“Narcissa, can I ask why you want to show me your memories?" I asked.
I glanced around the lift, but there was just the two of us. “Don't we need a member of the staff to operate the lift?" I asked.
“Alright I need some help in the kitchen. And Arthur, don't touch that cake yet," Mrs. Weasley said. Mr. Weasley dropped his hand away from the frosting on his birthday cake.
“Nah, he's a Squib. Born into a pureblood family with no magic of his own." He continued to look at him through the window.
“Well, I would say it, but I don't really want to embarrass him in front of you. Now, if he won't tell you himself, then I will, because it might concern me and you as well."
“It's a long story, Draco. Are you sure you want to know?"
“That's because I parked it in the lawyer's parking lot across the street. It doesn't stand out over there," I answered as we made our way out the door. It was a beautiful sunny day, but still a little chilly for the beginning of April. It was actually colder than when Draco and I had had our first date.
“Well, your mother told me about it when I stopped by the Manor on Sunday. I wanted to talk to you, but you were out. So, want to add anything? I mean if you want honesty from me, then I suggest you start being honest with me."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry released my hand and pulled out a small money pouch from his jacket pocket. He counted out the proper coins, laying them down on the bar.
“Well, we always had family staying over. Now, these days it's just me and Draco and the house elves. That's why I'm glad that you decided to move in, Harry. Makes it seem less empty," Mother said as we climbed up the stairs. When we reached the fourth floor, we moved down the hallway. Harry paused as we passed my bedroom doors.
I sighed heavily and ran my fingers through my hair. “I'm not sure how long I can just be his friend. I want more from him. You know I was crushing on him for years," I said, the smile fading from my lips.
I took the parchment but I didn't look at the words. Silence fell around us, and Harry turned his gaze to the pond. “Tell me the truth Harry. What do you want?" I asked, breaking the silence at last.
“Don't worry about it, Harry. The mirror and the door can easily be repaired. I was happy to see someone put Lucius in his place like that. No offense, Draco," he said, flashing me a guilty look.
“Yeah, well, blame my wife for that. She's anxious for you to meet your new goddaughter."
I stood there, staring after him, my hands balled into fists at my sides, until Hermione shoved me from behind. I blinked, then realized it was my turn to bowl. Without a word, I stepped up to the lane and grabbed my bowling ball. I took a breath, trying to control my emotions, before I bowled. The ball rolled straight into the gutter. Growling in the back of my throat, I waited until the ball came back, then tried again. The ball rolled straight into the gutter again.
Harry chose not to admit that Ginny was telling the truth.
be the Chupacabra,” Harry retorted with a wide smile. “Besides, we have plenty more farmland and woodland to explore.”
Usually when they went out, Harry's groupies--who Harry affectionately referred to as his 'friends'--were always around, and got in the way of Draco making a proper move on him. Now, however, they were alone, and alcohol would definitely make Harry more receptive to Draco's advances, especially if he wasn't aware of how much he was drinking.
Harry quirked an eyebrow. He didn’t know where to begin--the promise that Draco was gay, because really, how many straight people would do a thesis on homosexuality, or the fact that he’d just been kicked out of his reading spot.
“Remember,” Vernon said through gritted teeth, shooting Harry a sideways glare. “If you mess this up for us in any way, you will live to regret it. Do you understand me, Boy?”
“I’ll get myself off just from watching you come, Darling, don’t you worry.”
“I, uh-” he began to protest, but Ginny waved her hands to cut him off, unable to tell him directly as she was laughing too hard.
"Pass me the lube from under my pillow," Draco asked, and Harry readily complied.
Harry looked towards the source of the voice, finding a young man of around Harry's age sat behind the counter. He was tall and lean, and had hair dyed a pastel blue colour. The man's fingers were moving gracefully across a deck of large, colourful cards laid out across the counter.
Harry could feel his dick growing hard, and he ground against Draco as his confidence grew, moving his own tongue against Draco’s with just as much hunger.
“Likewise, Potter,” Draco said, raising his cup in salute. Harry rolled his eyes, but smiled and mimicked the movement…
Ava shook her head. "Nothing's wrong, Professor. I just haven't been sleeping well recently; I think the stress of N.E.W.T.s might be getting to me already. My grades aren't slipping, are they?"
“What’s the rest of the reason?”
Draco had never bothered to try any of the Muggle drinks that Harry favoured so much, especially as Harry had a taste for things which were overly sweet and sugary. Still, the coke would make it easier to disguise the fact that he had doubled the amount of vodka Harry had asked for.
Harry looked back at Draco and grinned, before hopping down onto the gravel road.
Draco struggled to contain his grin as he realised what that meant. Harry
Harry glared at her, but he was in too much of a good mood to put much venom into it.
Potter grinned. “I might actually like you a little bit, too, even if you are unadventurous and mouthy. Does that make us friends?”
"You're shaking. We don't have to do this if you're not ready."
“Oh!” Harry cried, as a strange squeaking noise came through the device he was holding. “What’s that sound? Do you know anything that can make that sound?”
"Malfoy, it's a trick!" Harry called, but Malfoy didn't listen. He fell into the same trap as Harry, rushing towards his father only for the false figure to collapse as Malfoy reached it.
Potter grinned, and Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen Potter smile directly at him before. It made his stomach flutter in a way that Draco wasn’t entirely comfortable with, feeling too much like a school-boy crush for his liking.
They pulled away from the kiss when the need for air became too much. Harry smiled dazedly, reluctant to let go of Malfoy. Malfoy hadn’t released his hold on Harry, though, so Harry figured he was safe to carry on holding him.
,” Harry urged. “Please, Draco, hurry-”
The garden of the villa was fairly large, with lush green grass and tall cypress trees. The air was sweet with the scent of flowers which bordered the garden in a range of stunning, vibrant colours.
“Ye-yes,” Harry stammered. “A dazzling constellation.”
Potter looked sheepish. “They were illegal. The two of them, along with Pettigrew, became Animagi so they could join Remus Lupin on the full moon because werewolves aren’t dangerous to animals.”
Luna’s office walls were a mismatch of paintings spread across them, with no clear joining to any of them. Where one ended, another began right next to it. Some paintings were patterns, others animals, and other people.
Draco opened his mouth to speak but found his mouth had gone dry. He was very sure that he was awake, yet the whole situation felt like one of his recent dreams. Unlike in his dreams, though, Draco could feel Harry’s heat and smell his woodsy aftershave, and track the subtle movements of Harry’s body as he shifted ever so slightly, clearly unable to sit still.
“No, you can look,” Harry said, pushing his sketchpad towards Draco. They were only Italy paintings, after all, and he felt, somehow, like he could trust Draco with his art.
a little bit eccentric. Luna’s
The high street was almost entirely empty, home to only Harry and a few other last-minute shoppers who had no choice but to brave the blizzard on Christmas Eve. Afternoon was already drawing on, and the sun had now gone and been replaced with the dull darkness of winter. Some shops still had vibrant yellow lights shining through their windows, while others were black; the owners closed early to be with their loved ones.
"Thank you, Professor."
It suddenly made sense to Draco why the receptionist was less of a bookish woman, and instead a beast of a man.
Draco sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. He was ready to launch into a lecture about the etiquette of wine, when he noticed the way that Luna and Dudley were looking at him. They both seemed strangely pleased, and had knowing smiles on their faces.
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said in awe.
“Lord of the Rings,” Harry said, showing Draco the cover. Draco scoffed, and Harry instantly found himself defensive. “What?”
They had originally come up to the loft so that Draco could show Harry some sheet music which he’d composed. Only the sticky heat had led to Draco unbuttoning his shirt, and because Harry didn’t think it was fair for Draco to tease him like that, he’d completely shed his t-shirt.
There went the credibility.
Draco tutted, his breath tickling Harry’s skin. “You’re such a needy little thing. I wonder how long I can tease you until you’re begging me to let you come; not long, I’d wager.”
Daphne gave him an exasperated look when he entered the sitting room, causing Draco to scowl.
Like the righteous bastard he was, Harry struggled to ignore the effects of the potion longer than most people would have. Then--finally--Harry snapped his quill and let it drop from his fingers, forgotten, as he turned to Draco.
“Notes? It’s a drink, not an instrument, Malfoy.”
However, one student in his seventh year class had caught his eye. Ava William was a tall brunette, with striking blue eyes which looked too old and haunted for her youthful face. She was a Ravenclaw, and preferred to sit out the practical part of the class to do her own reading on the spell.
“I’m close,” Draco ground out, his face in the mirror hot red and his hair plastered to his forehead. The white of his hair glowed in the yellow lighting of their office, making him look like the most deliciously devilish angel that Harry had ever had the pleasure of being fucked by. “Come for me, Harry, come around my cock.”
Harry had been too busy looking at Draco’s face to realise that he was also holding a book.
"Believing there's a realm for the dead would be considered kooky by some."
“I always wondered what art medium I’d be good at,” he mused, shooting Harry a mild look. “They say there’s a medium out there for everyone, but I’ve yet to find mine.”
The only thing they couldn't prepare for was what they were going to find once they entered the mirror. If anybody had gone inside the Mirror of Erised and come back again, they definitely hadn't left any written records of it.
"As I'll ever be." He exchanged a nod with Malfoy. "Shall we go?"
Harry's cock throbbed with the thought of it.
Potter and Draco exchanged a look, and a small smile crossed both their faces at the gesture. Draco touched his cheek, surprised at such an odd but good reaction from looking at Potter.
Just to make a point, Harry spurred himself on and sped up until his pace matched Draco’s. He certainly wasn’t going to give Draco the impression he couldn’t handle a simple hike. Harry was sweating and panting by the time they reached the top, but he’d also run the last few metres so that he could get there before Draco.
“You look utterly ravished; it’s beautiful,” Draco said. “And I was the one to do it to you.”
"I'm going to try a third finger now, if you want."
“You have!” Luna exclaimed before either of them could answer. “Oh, that’s so wonderful, isn’t it Dudley? The two of you make a lovely couple.”
“I’ve never seen anywhere so beautiful!” Harry exclaimed. “I’m sure you’ve travelled all over the world and seen all the art and culture there is to offer, but I’ve never been out of Britain before.”
Harry didn’t think he’d ever felt like this about anyone before, and didn’t know he could even experience emotions so intense.
Harry was worn out from their afternoon activities, having ridden Draco's cock as soon as they were both ready to go again. Harry had done brilliantly both times, taking Draco so well.
“I can get you one if you like,” Potter said, noticing where Draco was looking.
The first time that Draco called him ‘sweetheart’, Harry presumed it was a slip of a tongue and thought nothing of it...until it happened again.
Harry shook his head. “I just want to know what you’re afraid of.”
He stood from the bed, and made his way as quietly as he could across the room. He was quite adept at sneaking around usually, but not only was he in a house he didn’t know, it was an old building that creaked simply from being looked at.
“And if they don’t come round?”
He expected Potter to roll his eyes at him, but instead he looked thoughtful. A thoughtful Potter was never a good Potter.
“You know, some Muggles believe that Kelpies live here too,” Potter said, as he crumbled up some bread and tossed it into the water. “And
“France, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Morocco, Egypt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and Australia,” Draco recited. “Most of which were for Father’s business, but Mother and I were able to explore while Father sat in meetings. I’ve not been to Italy before. Work keeps me busy, and I’ve not been abroad for years. Admittedly, I’m only here now because Pansy insisted I needed a break and forced me to come. She’s quite the spitfire.”
“Hello, sorry I was out back, I...Potter?!”
So Blaise and Draco might not have a thing, but Draco had a thing for
Draco grinned. “I’d be happy to oblige.”
This time around though, he looked determinedly away from his parents waving at him cheerfully from the mirror.  But even knowing he shouldn't be tempted to look, his gaze still kept flickering to his parent's smiling faces, to Sirius's youthful grin, and Remus's calm, kind eyes.
With a final kiss goodnight, Draco pushed the door to his home open where Blaise and Pansy were standing suspiciously near the front window; Blaise was reading a magazine upside down and Pansy was looking very intently at the painting of dogs playing poker which she had expressed distaste for nearly every day since Blaise had brought it home from a Muggle antique fair.
“I’m not afraid of anything,” Draco said.
“Only for his gap year,” Vernon added hastily, shooting Harry a nasty glare. “He’s earning himself some money before he goes to university next year, aren’t you, B-Harry?”
Harry would have never thought he'd say this, but he genuinely missed working with Draco.
Harry quickly averted his gaze, grateful that his own seat was at the other end of the table. Looking at Malfoy brought back memories of petty rivalry which he'd rather thought he'd grown out of, considering he was supposed to be an adult and all that. And so what if Malfoy was working at the same place as Harry? He'd hated almost half of the Aurors, and he'd managed to avoid most of them unless absolutely necessary; Harry was pretty good at avoiding people.
Dobby found Harry a few minutes later, and offered to take Harry to the lake for the day. Harry was grateful that there was at least one Malfoy looking out for him.
“None of the eyewitnesses had a camera on them, then, did they?” Draco raised a brow. “What does this thing supposedly do?”
Harry could feel Draco’s erection pressing into him, and his own prick was rapidly growing hard.
"I'm not a dainty little maiden," Harry grumbled. "I just wasn't even aware you knew how to make a joke."
“That was so much fun. Never in a million years would I have thought that," Pansy said, flopping down in the empty chair next to me.
Harry glanced around at the Muggles who were enjoying the park around us, then lowered his voice. “Now probably isn't the best time to explain what an arcade is. How about Hermione explains it to you when we're in the vehicles?" He asked me. I nodded in understanding.
“Draco, where is Harry?" Hermione's voice asked.
“Okay. How did you find out that your magic and your emotions were connected?"
“Guilt Magic? Never heard of it. But what does that have to do with whether or not he has creature blood?" I asked.
I thought. Without a word, he moved and sat down on the couch with me. He raised his wand and flames burst into existence in the fireplace.
Once again Narcissa's memory swirled away. I fought back the bile that was rising in my throat. “How could he do that to Draco? How could Lucius treat his own son like he was something disgusting that he had stepped in?" I asked.
I felt a smile tug at my lips. “Yeah, I guess that is pretty funny," I said.
“Oh for Merlin's sake!" He snapped. His hands moved to the snap of his jeans. He undid the button and the zipper. He eased the jeans down slightly and pulled down the edge of his boxers. “Does that really look like someone hit me?"
“Sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going," I mumbled. My eyes were still looking down, and I realized I was looking at a pair of shiny black dress shoes. I slowly raised my head and found myself looking down into a pair of cloud grey eyes and platinum blonde hair.
I felt him smile slightly against the skin of my chest, before he snuggled in deeper. “Love you too," I thought I heard as I drifted off to sleep.
“Well, when that guy got me from the bathroom, and we returned to the dinning area, why was the stuff on the table rattling around, and why did they stop when I put my arm around you?" I asked. He reached up and brushed my hair away from my face.
We climbed out of the car, and followed Ron into the house. As he pushed open the door into his kitchen, all three of us covered our ears as a loud cry reached us. We shoved into the kitchen and once we were inside, the cry didn't seem so loud. “'Mione?" Ron called out.
Hermione reached out and placed her hand on my knee. “Listen to me, Draco. We can get you through this humiliation. I can help you and Harry actually work this out."
“Harry..."
. Hermione and I were sitting on chairs in a line along the arcade wall for the people that didn't want to play the games.
“No, I won't ignore you. I'll answer any text, any call, or even any letter. I'll do anything I can to help us become friends. Maybe if we ever resume our relationship, things will be better than before. But, for now, I guess this is goodbye."
“Do you want to leave?"
(See the end of the chapter for
I sat there with the blanket across my lap, listening to the sounds from the kitchen. I turned my gaze towards the swing. Rose was fast asleep, the swing still swaying back and forth. I closed my eyes, and made my body relax. I took a few deep breaths. Finally, I was able to remove the blanket from my lap.
I opened my eyes and slowly raised my head off the rim of the toilet. Another wave of nausea hit me and I lowered my face back to the toilet as my stomach heaved, emptying the contents from my late night snack. Neville was by my side, gently rubbing his hand across my shoulders.
“Harry has a right to know! You might have given it to him!" Draco yelled.
“What about us, Draco? What about everything we were together?" Blaise asked.
She surprised me with her response. “If Percy wants to set you up with someone, he would have better luck with one of his older brothers."
“Fine. I couldn't admit at that time that I was in love with Dean. But I have him now and that's whats important to me. You had the man you loved and you pushed him away," Seamus snapped.
As I woke from the deep sleep I had been wrapped in, I became aware of two things...one, there was a strong arm wrapped around my waist and two, my cheek was pressed against a firm surface. I opened my eyes and discovered that I was resting on Charlie's chest.
“Where will you go, Harry?" Charlie asked.
Harry crushed out the end of his cigarette, picked up his book and went back to reading. I smiled softly to myself, then turned back to my own book. I glanced over at him one more time, before I lost myself once again in the dragon book in my lap.
“Oh, I think you and Harry would have gotten together eventually. I just thought I'd give you two a little push. So tell me, who's Charlie?"
“Good night, Harry," I said.
Before she could answer, a familiar male voice called out to us. “Hey Draco, hey there Hermione, long time no see."
“Harry!" Charlie yelled. I heard him running behind me. I pushed open the bedroom door. Just as I suspected, the bathroom door was closed.
A small smile appeared on his face. “That's nice of you to say, Harry. But they don't fully trust me here. No one can trust a former Death Eater."
“Us? Blaise, there hasn't been an ´us' since fifth year. Yes, we had something between us, but you threw that away when I caught you in bed with Millicent. I forgave you for that, but then you turned around and had an affair with Adrian Pucey. I mean, he even bragged that he slept with you," I said. Pain washed over me as I remembered hearing Adrian bragging to the entire Slytherin house about how he had gotten Blaise in bed.
I sat there for a while before I finally picked myself up and made my way back to the house. I stepped into the kitchen, made my way to the living room and the fireplace in the corner. I took a small pinch of floo powder from the pot on the mantle and threw it down. I called out the floo address for my room at Malfoy Manor and I stepped into the green flames.
“I can explain that. You see, just about anyone can do wandless magic when they lose their control over their power. I think everyone loses control in the middle of sexual activities. When your mind is focused on your pleasure instead of your magic, your magic will flow freely and then you can do anything."
“Didn't I tell you that?"
I sighed. “I slept with Draco Malfoy. It was a mistake on my part, but I don't really regret it. If you don't believe me, here's a little proof for you." At my words, I caught the side of my shirt collar and pulled it to the left. Draco's little “D" shaped hickey clearly visible. Without waiting for him to respond, I twisted on the spot and disapparated.
“So, do you have any idea where we're going?" I asked Hermione. We had left St. Mungo's about ten minutes, and Hermione still hadn't told me her plan. She had visited me often over the past five days and we had become closer as a result of it.
He blushed, but didn't look away. “What's the big deal about it? Harry and I talked about this and he told me he was okay with it if I wanted to date someone else while we build our friendship."
“Firewhisky, Potter? I thought Gryffindors preferred Butterbeer," I sneered.
“Why would he want you to go with him? It's not like his father will be happy to see you," Kingsley said, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck.
It had been four days since my birthday party, and I hadn't seen Harry since. I had awoken in St. Mungo's, both wrists heavily bandaged. The Healers had given me several blood replenishing potions from the time I had woken up. And though it had been four days, my wrists were still bandaged; I refused to let the healers heal them with magic. Even my Healer's magic wasn't healing them. After casting several diagnostic spells over me, the healers had discovered that I had made myself immune to my own Healer's magic, meaning I could no longer heal my own injuries; although they've said that it would come back over time.
“Well, since even I haven't heard anything from Harry since your party, I was thinking we could start at Rainforest Falls and see if anyone there knows something."
Harry shifted around so that he was facing me. “Yes."
I raised my hand and gently touched the spot where his lips had been. I glanced at the bed and my heart filled with sadness now that he had left.
I let out another sigh, before apperating outside. I landed outside the Quidditch pitch. The door was slightly open, so I pushed it further open and walked inside. I glanced around the large stadium, but Harry wasn't anywhere that I could see. I started to turn away when I became aware of his wayward magic brushing against me, much like it had when we had visited my father in Azkaban.
“I appreciate the offer, but no thanks. I'm not going to lie to him. I'm just gonna come clean. I just don't know how he will react."
“Yeah, I haven't been in this area in a while," Harry replied. It was then that I noticed that one of the other girls was staring at me. She let her eyes slowly travel down my body and then slowly brought them back to my face. Harry caught the look. “Sorry, Pamela. He's mine," Harry said, grabbing my hand again.
Charlie has been coming home late and Harry accuses him of cheating. A heated argument then sends Charlie away and Harry heads out to a bar.
“So?"
“Yeah. You were too far away and I couldn't kiss you while you were on the other side of the table," he said. Before I could respond, he caught my chin and tilted my head back. He pressed a quick kiss to my lips, his tongue tracing the edge of my bottom lip. He pulled back and picked up his burger.
A small crackle of magic began to form around the room. I glanced at Harry and noticed his eyes had narrowed. “No, Lucius. You're the one who ruined your family's reputation. Just like you're the one who tore your family apart. You're just embarrassing yourself right now," he said in a dangerously low voice. Kingsley and the Aurors shifted uncomfortably as his magic crackled around us.
Charlie stepped away from me. He took a breath, but didn't say anything. He just stared at me. In my mind, I began to panic that he wouldn't be able to forgive me. He sighed heavily. “It's alright Harry. We can get through this. It's just a bump in the road. I love you." He pulled me into his arms.
*****
“I can't believe you called her," I snapped at him.
“I did?" I asked.
“Draco, what are you getting at?" I asked him, turning around to face him.
I tugged on his hand, and led him further down the hall behind my mother. She had stopped next to another set of double doors. These ones had a pair of lions for door handles. “Here we are. Go ahead and open the doors Harry," Mother said.
“Be quiet, Charlie! If you won't answer me, then let him," I growled, raising my wand a little bit. He snapped his mouth shut. I turned back to Marcus. “Now tell me, what's going on here," I said to him.
“I wasn't thinking. I felt like my heart was broken and the physical pain made me forget that Harry left me."
“And I'm sorry that I wasn't here to make it perfect."
I laid the box flat on my palm before I lifted the lid. Inside, was a beautiful silver dragon with rubies for eyes and it held a large emerald in its claws. The dragon hung from a thick silver chain. “Harry, this is beautiful," I said.
She shook her head and looked at me with her soft brown eyes. I sighed and motioned her to sit down in the chair next to my bed. Once she was seated in the chair, I climbed onto my bed and sat cross-legged on the covers. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly before speaking. I told her everything; mine and Blaise's conversation in the entryway, him kissing me, Ron finding us like that and telling Harry, Harry leaving, and my eventual cutting of my wrists.
“Are you ready for me?" He asked, rubbing against my hole.
“Yes, actually I do. Harry taught me how to use one and even bought me one not too long ago. But he hasn't returned any of my calls," I said reaching under my pillow and pulling out the dark green phone Harry had gotten me. I slid my thumb across the screen before holding it out to her.
I looked around at the building we had landed in; the bare stone walls and floor of the place sent a shiver down my spine. At least it wasn't crawling with Dementors anymore. Kingsley motioned us forward. We followed him through the door and into a brightly lit room. This room was much more friendlier and warmer than the one we had entered through. A witch sat at a desk in the middle of the room, looking up at us as we entered. There was a door to the left of the desk and a door to the right.
“Harry, please! More, I want more," I begged. He began to pick up his pace, sliding his mouth up and down my shaft a little faster. He also began to suck just a bit harder. One of his hands left my hip and fondled my balls. I began to writhe beneath him, my orgasm approaching.
“Yes, more,
Both of them looked up when Draco entered, and Draco’s heart fluttered at the smile that Harry sent his way.
“Anything could make that sound,” Draco said. Truthfully, he knew very little about animals, though the sound to him did seem like some kind of dolphin.
Harry nodded. “They wouldn’t take no for an answer. And you know she hates being called Ginerva, don’t you?”
“Can you pick some more imaginary creatures that live in nice places like this?” Draco asked as they walked up the steps to their hotel. “This is far nicer than Loch Ness. Sure, it was scenic, but Scotland is known for its dull weather.”
Narcissa smiled and clapped her hands together in delight. “What do you play? Draco and I play violin, piano, and flute, and Lucius pretends he’s not musically inclined but he’s ever so talented at the harp.”
Draco grasped Harry’s hips tightly, pulling back before slamming forwards again and setting a brutal pace. Harry moaned each time Draco thrust into him, nailing his prostate each time.
"Were you drinking before you came out?" Draco teased. "Usually you only start waxing poetic about Snape after you've had a few. Still, shall we raise a glass to our favourite heroic bastard?"
“I’m ready. Draco, I need you in me,” Harry urged, writhing against the desk. “I need you to fill me with your massive cock.”
All there was to do now was tell Draco what he wanted, and hopefully he wouldn't humiliate himself in the process.
Harry would definitely be keeping an eye on Ginny and Pansy, though; they certainly seemed to have something up their sleeves.
With newly confirmed confidence, Harry went on to study the shelves for the book Hermione had asked him to get. He ignored the whispering of the books trying to lure him in as he went near them, long having learned not to answer any kind of talking book.
Harry loved teaching.
Malfoy cast the charm needed on the mirror, causing the glass to morph until it looked like water flowing wild. It looked enticing, beckoning them forwards like it was begging them to touch it. If Harry hadn't needed to go in, he would have immediately turned around and fled at the sight. No magical item striving for human touch could be good.
Harry didn’t understand what he’d done wrong. Maybe he’d been awful in bed and completely put Draco off him. Or maybe Draco had never been that into Harry anyway, and only slept with him out of pity but didn’t want to deal with him anymore.
Harry grinned and shuffled a little closer to Draco. “I guess you could say that.”
Draco shook his head, waving his wand over their office door to lock it. “I’ve fantasised about having you bent over my desk so many times, I can’t resist the opportunity to have that now. Fuck, I’ve come to the thought of your sweet arse so many fucking times.”
He paused his walkman when he faintly heard the garbled words of an announcement over the loudspeaker, and was just in time to catch the captain telling them that they’d be landing soon, and to fasten their seatbelts and put away electronics and trays.
“Nessie can be cute if she wants to be,” Potter argued. “There’s been loads of tales about her, but you never hear of her killing or attacking anyone. She’s a peaceful creature.”
Draco smiled sadly. “No, it’s not. He’s the reason I like to come to cemeteries. He was so heartless and uncaring of his victims, even after their deaths, that I find the respect given to the buried almost heartwarming. It makes me almost unafraid of death. Thank you for coming here with me, Potter, I appreciate it. And I’m not repeating myself, so you can fuck off if you didn’t hear me and want me to say it again.”
“Yes, it’s rather nice,” Draco answered, nodding. “I never thought to proposition you because I thought you were a little bit of a prude, but it seems that you’re just as pervy as I am. How long have you been picturing what my dick looks like?”
“Push me, Draco, I can take it,” Harry pleaded. “I need you so badly.”
“He’s a nerd,” Draco answered, half-listening to Harry detailing a story about some lords and some rings.
Draco smirked. “You wouldn’t be. But I know other things that you like-” he leaned down to purr in Harry’s ear. “
“You have such an odd collection of friends,” Draco muttered, shaking his head.
intelligent.'”
“I can’t say I’ve ever tried it,” Draco answered, taking a seat after Luna transfigured the bean bag into a chair for him.
Draco shrugged. “Father likes peacocks. I never even questioned why he had so many; I was accustomed to them even as a small child. Did you know I’ve not been back to the manor since the war ended? There’s too many memories there. It’s stupid, isn’t it, not wanting to return to your childhood home.”
Then he crumpled into her arms.
“I don’t think you even have a switch,” Potter retorted, but his expression softened.
“Right. Right. Are you sure? Right. Okay. Right. Thank you anyway,” Harry said, clearly having a riveting conversation. He hung up the phone and turned to Draco. “So apparently on our booking we were down as having a double room, and there aren’t any twins left in the hotel so we’ve got to manage with this. I don’t want to risk transfiguring anything into a bed seeing as this place is all Muggle, so I can sleep on the floor if that would make you more comfortable.”
“What?” Harry said, his voice too strangled and high-pitched to sound normal. “I don’t keep staring at your, er…” he trailed off as Draco stretched his arms above his head, making Harry’s gaze drift downwards on instinct.
Harry grinned at Draco, trying to shake away the low level of nervousness he felt at finally getting the thing he’d been fantasising about for so long. Despite Draco trying to act cool and suave, Harry could see by the way he was nibbling on his lower lip that he was just as nervous and excited as Harry was.
“What is it?” Draco asked, gingerly sitting beside Harry and studying the screen. A man and woman in smart suits were talking in an office, a poster on the wall reading ‘
Adding a second finger, Draco continued to work Harry’s hole open, pushing in a third when he felt Harry was ready. Harry pushed back against Draco’s hand.
Draco groaned loudly as Harry’s arse clenched around him as he came, the added friction on Draco’s sensitive triggering his own orgam. Draco pumped his hips in short, shallow thrusts until he was completely spent, unwilling to let the experience come to an end until it absolutely had to.
Harry didn’t even think that most people
“Mother, Father, may I be excused from breakfast early?” Draco asked.
Thankfully the shop that Harry wanted still looked like it was open, the golden glow in the window illuminating carefully crafted doll’s houses and wooden soldiers painted in bright, cheerful colours.
“Er, hello,” Harry said, when it became apparent that Malfoy wasn’t going to say anything more. “I’ve come to buy a toy.”
“And you think it was my doing? I’m sure the hotel just made a mistake,” Dudley said, turning his attention to some paperwork in front of him.
office and its owner were incredibly eccentric? If it paid such good money, and gave him travel time which got him out of Pansy and Astoria’s hair, then he couldn’t complain at all.
Harry did as instructed, working the mixture deftly with his hands.
“Lakes are cold,” he said. “You’ll get used to it.” Then he strode past Harry, wading into the lake as though the temperature didn’t bother him in the slightest.
Harry followed Draco’s gaze, and found himself looking at a lot filled with lines and lines of Muggle campervans and caravans. Draco looked horrified, and a little bit scared, too.
Draco’s hands moved to grasp Harry’s hips, but he made no further move to initiate the kiss. Well, he had asked Harry to prove himself, and Harry wasn’t a coward.
“What—?”
Draco shook his head. “You’ve met my parents. Do you really think they’d be providing me with Muggle food for dinner?”
Blaise let out a short bark of laughter. “I’ve lost count. I’ll have one more to add tonight, at any rate. You should try and pull tonight too. It would do you good, plus the orgasm will probably clear your head and make your thesis easier to write.”
“I always knew Harry was talented,” Vernon said, his voice booming. “I sprung for the best music teacher I could find for him, as I couldn’t let that talent go to waste.”
of pleasure," Draco said reassuringly as he pushed the head of his cock forwards into Harry's body.
He’d spent the entire night moping, missing Draco’s company, and now that Draco was back, he found himself transfixed by his every move.
“You’ve got a point there,” Harry said with a grin. “But just the one glass. I had the worst hangover the day after we went to The Glory Hole.”
“Oh, okay,” Harry said, frowning. Draco was acting strange, but Harry supposed he couldn’t fault him if he wasn’t feeling well. “I hope you feel better soon.”
“We have a couple of hours left,” Harry said brightly. “That’s plenty of time.”
“Yes, we’re together now. I think.” Harry frowned. “We’ve never spoken about what’s going to happen after we get back to England.”
“Yeah,” Harry said quietly. “Sweet dreams.”
He swallowed heavily, and lifted his glass from the table. It struggled to move at first, the sticky table trying to hold his glass down. Blaise had chosen their drinks for them, and had gone for cocktails all round. It was fruity and sugary, and barely tasted of alcohol, and Harry was beginning to think it was stronger than he realised as the blinking lights were beginning to merge into one blur, and the world seemed to be swaying a little bit.
Draco glanced up from his stack of paperwork to find Harry leaning against one of the partitions that made up his 'office'.
“God, you’re an arsehole,” Harry uttered, breath stuttering in his throat as he spoke. “Please fuck me, you arsehole. I want your cock in me now. Please, Draco, please…”
“So,” Dudley said slowly, breaking the awkward silence. “Were you a friend of Harry’s at school?”
"Well how about you keep looking for other possibilities, and in the meantime I'll talk to Dumbledore's portrait about it. If anyone's going to know about realm portals in the school, it's going to be him."
Of course, sitting this close allowed Harry to see the way Malfoy's lashes lightened at the tips, and the flecks of blue in the otherwise steely grey eyes.
Harry turned around, positioning himself so he was on his hands and knees. Draco sat up, kneeling behind Harry so he could pull Harry’s jeans and boxers down and out of the way. Harry’s arse was perfect, though Draco had stared at it so often that he already knew that, even through clothes.
“You sappy dork,” Draco said with a smile, reaching for Harry’s face to pull him in for a kiss. Harry always tasted of cherries and sugar, and Draco yearned to drink all of him in and taste every inch of him. He longed to invite Harry in for ‘coffee’ and neglect the coffee for something else hot and steamy, but panic clutched his chest as he knew what he’d have to reveal if he put forth the offer.
After taking some painkillers, Harry had a quick shower and pulled on his clothes from the day prior, too lazy to find fresh ones. When he left his room he ran into Dobby, whose lips quirked at the sight of Harry.
, Malfoy,” Potter said, as though Draco hadn’t heard him the first time. “I’ve met a vampire, so who’s to say animal versions of vampires can’t exist too?”
Somehow Harry had wormed his way into Draco’s life and filled it with light and happiness, and Salazar-damnit, he wanted to screw Harry into the mattress and make him scream Draco’s name. The only way Draco could get that, though, was to tell Harry that he was trans and hope that Harry didn’t mind.
Harry hummed thoughtfully. It was bad news, but more than that, it was a lead. If Ava really had gone inside the Mirror of Erised, there had to at least be a chance that they could get her out.
“No, thank you,” Draco said stiffly. “I prefer my bowler hats on my head, not floating on my clothing.”
Draco made his way to the bar, barging past the people in his way without a second thought until he reached the front of the small crowd. He leaned on the counter, catching the gaze of one of the older bartenders and winked.
"You're probably standing at the wrong angle," Harry sighed. "It shows you the deepest desires of your heart."
When he arrived back at the dorm, he went straight to the boy's room where Draco was already lounging on his bed with a book in hand. He shuffled to the edge of the mattress and patted the space beside him.
“It’s the X-Files,” Harry said. “It’s not real, but it’s entertaining. “That’s Mulder and she’s Scully, and they hunt aliens mostly. Mulder believes in it all, but Scully is far more skeptical.”
“Do you have family here?” Harry asked, prompting the planchette to circle around the ‘yes’ marking.
"Spoilsport. But fine, through perusing the books on realm travel, I discovered a spell which allows the users to communicate with people on the other side of the portal. If Ava is inside the mirror, we should be able to hear her. Do you want me to cast it now?"
Draco glanced over at him. “Those potions may taste awful, but I know they work when taken correctly. I have seen several wizards use them."
He handed the photo album to Mrs. Weasley and stood up. I stood as well when he stepped towards me. He pulled me into a tight hug. “There's more of him in there. This was my way of keeping him alive," I said.
I nodded slowly. Harry took a deep breath before he began his tale. My eyes widened in shock as Harry spoke of his life; living in a cupboard under the staircase until he was eleven, locked in said cupboard whenever he did accidental magic, forced to cook and clean for the Muggles before maybe getting something to eat for himself, forced to wear his cousin's old hand-me-down clothes, being locked in his room the summer between first and second year for magic that Dobby had actually preformed in the house. I listened carefully, my mind having trouble believing him. My jaw was hanging open when he finished. “Merlin, Harry. You were treated no better than a house elf. Is that why you're so upset over this?"
“What's that supposed to mean?"
I watched as he stiffened, before slowly turning his head around to face me. “How much of that did you hear?" He asked me.
“I don't like surprises. You could have told me." Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Ron's face getting redder. The waitress just stood there, staring.
He was all alone in a booth in the corner by a window. He wasn't looking in my direction, but there was no mistaking that it was him. That messy black hair that never seems to lay flat, and from my angle, I could see the edge of his glasses. I took a small step closer to him and the throbbing of my hip intensified.
“Yes. Draco has cut himself a few times over the years. Mainly because of Lucius telling him that he was worthless, and that he was a disgrace to the Malfoy name. Look, Harry, if you don't want to see my memories, you don't have to. I just thought I'd help you with Draco," Narcissa said.
“Sure," he said. He turned around and walked towards the door. He pulled it open and disappeared through it.
“Harry, you hurt him. He ended up in St. Mungo's for a week after, in an apparent suicide attempt, he cut both wrists because of the pain from you breaking his heart. I'm actually surprised he even wanted you to move back in," she said, sitting down on the edge of the fountain next to Ron.
“I love it. Thank you," I said. I leaned over and took his lips in a soft kiss. He pulled away gently.
“You've been coming home later than normal, and sometimes when you come home, you head straight for the shower. We never cuddle anymore. We haven't really been intimate for almost two weeks," I could taste bile in my throat and I felt like I would throw up any minute, but I needed to know.
Regret washed over me as I trailed my fingers higher up his chest, gently touching each of the four scars, the largest one extending from the left side of his collarbone down to the bottom of his right ribcage; that was where the full strength of the curse had struck him. I buried my face deeper into his neck as I fought back the urge to cry, knowing that I was the one responsible for the permanent damage to his skin.

He opened his mouth, then snapped it closed again. He picked up his menu from the table and hid behind it. I knew he wasn't really reading it; it was upside down in his hands.
I grinned. “Well eventually, I think we'll only have to worry about waking up in one bed." I reached out my hand through the curtains and grabbed my glasses from the nightstand. I slid them in place and reached my arms above my head and stretched. With a small groan, I fell back against the pillows. With a wave of my hand, I opened the curtains around the bed and let the sunlight pour through.
“He said he had no reason to stay here anymore," Ron said, shrugging.
“Draco, I'm gonna cum," he warned as he thrust his hips a little harder.
“Forgive you? Charlie, how can you ask me to forgive you? If it only happened once, then I could get over it. But this has been going on for months. I can't just look the other way."
I felt as though someone was staring at me. I looked up and found myself staring into Charlie's blue eyes. I quickly looked away. “Well, I don't want to hog Rose all to myself. There are some other things I need to do, like looking for a new apartment." I handed Rose back to Hermione and stood up. I stepped around Charlie and made my way to the door.
“What? What happened?"
. I thought. I wrapped my arms around a pillow and let my tears fall. I cried until my tears dried up and I drifted off to sleep.
“Did you even mean what you said in the kitchen a little bit ago?" I asked him, the tears still streaming down my cheeks.
“You have a motorcycle and a car?" Draco asked.
“Harry, can I ask you something? When was the last time you slept with Draco where he topped you?" Dean asked me.
My hands went to his shirt and I began tugging it from his waistband. Draco's hand came up and he loosened the tie around his neck. He broke the kiss and pulled the tie from around his neck, dropping it on the floor. I finally managed to pull his shirt from his waistband. In my desperation to get to his bare skin, I ripped his shirt open, buttons flying in every direction.
He suddenly turned his head in my direction. He noticed the direction of my gaze and looked down. “It's not what you think Draco. I told you that I fell against a table."
“Harry went outside, he said something about trying to calm down."
Draco climbed out of the car. I followed. I caught his arm and pulled him against me, wrapping my arms around his waist. My lips locked against his and I pressed him back against the hood of my car. His hands reached down and grabbed my arse. He squeezed and pulled my hips closer until our erections rubbed through our jeans. I broke the kiss as we both moaned.
“I was honest with my testimony, Narcissa. You and Draco had done nothing wrong. You both tried to protect my life, so I returned the favor. I was glad to do my part."
on my arm!" I growled, more to myself than to him.

“Oh dear," Mrs. Weasley said. We quickly headed back into the living room and paused at the sight before us. Bill, Charlie, and Percy were all on their feet. Bill was standing between his younger brothers, arms outstretched to keep them apart. Charlie's hands were balled into fists and Percy was holding a hand to his cheek.
“It's fine. Charlie listen to me, I did something last night that I'm not too proud of."
Without pausing to think, I twisted on the spot and apparated straight into Harry's room. He was thrashing back and forth across the bed, screaming like he was suffering the Cruciatus Curse. A pillow was on the floor, as though he had been holding it when he fell asleep. I darted forward, only to come up short at the sight of blood on his wrists. Stealing my nerves, I moved to the bed. I pulled my wand from my pocket and tried to close the wounds. Nothing happened. I caught one of his arms as he flailed about helplessly and ran my fingers over his wrist. He cried out in pain, but when I pulled my hand away, the wound was still there, and there was no blood on my hand.
“So, you know he did that on purpose?" I asked. I stepped over to the sink and leaned against the wall next to him.
I reached over and pulled the glass away from him. “I think you've had enough Firewhisky, Blaise. You're pretty drunk."
I looked up at him as he took the phone back. I stared at the fresh scars on his wrists, seeing them for the first time since I had moved back in. I looked up at him, meeting his eyes. “Where did you get that message?" I asked.
“Draco, a real friend wouldn't ask him to be okay seeing the one he loves with others. A real friend wouldn't toss it in his face that he lost the best relationship I've ever seen him have," I said.
“I don't see why we can't just tell them. I mean, they knew you were gay. They now know I'm gay. If they can accept that, then surely they could accept us being together," I said, taking another sip of my tea.
“I know what their trying to do. Their trying to set us up together. You seem like a nice girl and everything, but your not really my type," I said. I looked down, not wanting to see disappointment on her face. I dug into my food.
“Draco, I am so sorry," I whispered.
I turned my attention back to my book for a moment, then turned back to Harry. He was looking out the window, smiling as he enjoyed his cigarette. He flicked his ashes into a small, black ashtray that had appeared on the stand next to his chair.
“Sure," he said. He followed me out of the building, where our conversation would be a little more private. I turned around to face him. “Is everything alright? You seem upset," he commented.
“Honestly, I've missed waking up with you too. I still think we should take things slow," I said.
With that, we parted ways; him disapperating to Malfoy Manor, while I disapparated to my room at the Leaky Cauldron.
He slid into the booth quietly. Josie was back moments later and placed our drinks on the table. He thanked her and she walked away. We sat there in silence for a moment, then I heard Harry mutter under his breath. I looked up at him and saw his wand in his hand.
“Why, Charlie? What happened between us? I thought we were so happy. Where did things go so wrong with us?" I cried.
“Actually, we broke up three weeks ago," I said.
I watched them standing there, just talking excitedly like they had been friends forever. Without meaning to, I let my eyes flicker over the ride as it was spinning around. Watching the spinning machine as it became a little faster, my stomach twisted again and I lost my battle with my nausea. Making my way to the nearest rubbish bin, I spewed the contents of my stomach into it.
“Your answers just filled me with more questions."
I gasped at the pure sensation of pleasure that raced through me. He ran his tongue over the head and down the length of my shaft, then he licked his way back to the tip. I groaned, propping myself up on my elbows to watch him. He glanced up at me, his green eyes darkened with lust. We stared into each other's eyes for a moment, then Harry bent his head and took my tip into his mouth. I gasped at the contact, my hips rising off the bed. He put his hands on my hips, pinning them down.
“Oh, now you want to talk? Where were you when I wanted to talk? Where were you when I wanted to tell you about Blaise kissing me? Where were you when I was in St. Mungo's?" He yelled at me. He crushed out his cigarette, snapped his book closed, and stood up from his chair. He tossed the book to the floor and stormed over to the windows. I could see the tension across his shoulders. The way he was standing, his Dark Mark was facing me, exposed by his t-shirt.
I slowly rose from the sofa, casting a quick glamour on my wrists. I left the others in the room as I walked out. I made my way down the hall and into his room. Harry was propped up against his pillows, his head dropped against his chest.
I knelt on the floor in front of him and began to remove his shoes. I placed his shoes on the floor. I stood back up and began to undo the buttons on his shirt. “I'll say this; it's a good thing that we're both gay and I've already seen you naked. Otherwise, me undressing you right now would be extremely awkward," I whispered as I undid the last button and pushed the shirt from his shoulders. It fell against the back of the chair Harry was sitting on. He chuckled softly.
“No, I will not move. I still want to talk about what's going on right now," I said. He took a step towards me. I backed up closer to the door.
He kissed my cheek gently, then stood up. “I guess I should return to the Leaky Cauldron before it gets too dark around here," he said.
“For at least fifteen minutes now. What's wrong with me calling him Draco?" Harry asked.
“Why would he want to hurt you? You're his only son."
Harry must have noticed that Kyle was just standing there. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him turn his head in the young man's direction. He sighed and turned to me. “Draco, this is my ex-boyfriend, Kyle Webster. Kyle, this is my date, Draco Malfoy."
I knew he was referring to Ron. “You didn't see the look on his face. It was like I had betrayed him by not telling him about us. I wouldn't be surprised if he never wants to talk to me again," I said. I swallowed past the lump in my throat. Reaching out, I placed my tea on the coffee table. I fought back tears.
We sat there for a while, Mother letting me cry on her shoulder. She rubbed my back gently. “Well, there's no use crying all night. I understand you're hurting right now, Draco, but I also know that you are a strong young man. I'm sure you and Harry will make up soon. Now, come on, how about you get yourself cleaned up and get to bed? Maybe you'll feel better in the morning."
Shawnna and I stepped away from the bed and moved over to where Ron and Hermione had perched on the sofa. Dean moved up and sat on the bed. Harry thrashed briefly under the chains. Dean leaned forward and placed his hands on either side of Harry's head. He closed his eyes as he concentrated.
“This place is huge! It seems pretty big for just three people to live here. I sort of feel like I'm back at Hogwarts," Harry said, looking around as we climbed.
“Harry?" Draco said.
“Well, how'd it go? Come on, tell me."
“I used to help Andromeda with Teddy when he was younger," came his reply.
“Yes," I said. I slipped my wand into my pocket and stepped over by him. “I've arranged it with Tom to use the Floo in his office."
He smiled down at me, then leaned down and kissed me again. I parted my lips and he slid his tongue inside. The kiss was slow; our tongues sliding against each other, with neither one of us willing to part too quickly. Harry finally broke away and we were both breathing heavily. He moved his lips to my neck and then he bit down gently. I gasped at the sensation it created.
Once my shoes were on, I stood up and made my way over to the computer in between the lanes. I began to program our names into the system. When I was finished, I looked around at the others to find that everyone had their bowling shoes on. “Now, we need to find the correct bowling ball. Hermione and I will help you with that; you have to find a ball that's not too heavy to pick up and that the holes aren't too tight or too loose around your fingers," I said. The four purebloods looked at me like I had lost my mind. I chuckled. “Come on. What I just said will make sense in a few moments."
“Look, Potter isn't such a bad guy. In fact, he invited me to sit here when there was no other spots open," I said. I could feel him staring at me, but I refused to look at him.
“I-I don't know wh-what you're talking about," Charlie stammered. His cheeks turned red. He dropped his gaze away from me, and with a plop, he dropped to the couch.
“You have a Lambo?" She asked turning to face him. He simply nodded. She turned back to me. “I want to ride with Harry. You know how I like Lambos and you've already ridden in it."
“I know. You couldn't even bring yourself to kill Professor Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy Tower, even though Voldemort would have killed your family. Snape used the killing curse on Dumbledore."
“Actually, I haven't seen him in over a half hour. He was in here talking to me and I told him to get out and leave me alone," I reached for my cigarettes on the table and paused looking up at them. “Do you mind?" I asked, gesturing to the table.
I wanted to walk away. But the pain radiating from him kept me in place. I watched him as he shifted in his seat, the side of his face that I could see, twisting in pain at his movement. When a fresh wave of pain pulsed through my own hip, I knew my Healers instincts would not let me just walk away.
Silence fell around us as Charlie began to eat. I lost my appetite as the thought of him cheating bounced around in my head. I pushed the food around on my plate, trying hard not to say it...but out it came.
“Harry, I've never been a Top in the bedroom. I have always been a Bottom."
“Oh, about two more blocks. See that building ahead of us with the yellow and black on the walls? That's where we're going," Harry said. He pointed out the building when I looked in that direction. Even from this distance, the building looked impressive. We finished walking in silence.
******
“Well, I guess I have to be. But I want to know how you two got together in the first place. I mean you hated each other back in school."
“Harry, please don't cry," Charlie said. He knelt down in front of me.
“Draco, everything will be fine. We'll be with Kingsley and a couple of Aurors. He won't be able to hurt you. I promise," Harry said. He stepped up next to me and wrapped his arms around me. I returned the hug, gently squeezing him.
I rested my head against his chest. Behind me, I heard the dishes pile into the dish rack to dry and I also heard the water drain from the sink. I felt relief that he still wanted me; even after I cheated on him.
“Dempsey," l said, calling Draco's favorite house elf.
“How you feeling, Hermione?" I asked.
“Well, I guess I can understand that. But, that doesn't exactly explain why I was able to do wandless magic during our first night together. You said I snapped my fingers and the bottle of lubricant flew into my hand."
Harry said goodbye to Tom, then he turned around, caught my hand again, and tugged me out the door. “Let's go home," he whispered into my ear. A strange little shiver slid down my spine at his use of the word ´home'. I tightened my grip on his hand and twisted on the spot.
I sighed deeply. I was now incredibly grateful that my head was in the fireplace. I knew Draco wouldn't be able to hear my conversation with Kingsley. “Draco and I are involved with each other. He wants me to go with him so that he'll feel safer."
“Problems, Mother?" Draco asked as we approached her bed.
“You did this for me? Why?" I asked him.
“However, if you want to spend time with me, you can come with me," he said as he reached for the black v-neck t-shirt draped over the foot of the bed. He tugged it on and I swallowed as the shirt clung to his chest.
. I thought to it. I focused on Healer Shawnna Love, and the dragon disappeared, taking my message with it.
“Draco told me about what happened yesterday. He also told me about how you two are going to try to become friends before you take your relationship further. I think my memories will help you understand him. And I think they'll help you get over your guilt," she answered.
I emerged from my closet with the robe draped over my arm. There was a soft knock on my door. “Enter, Poppy," I called. The doors opened and three house elves came in. Poppy was carrying the tray with the tea. The two male house elves behind her were carrying a larger tray loaded with covered dishes. I directed them to carry the trays to the end of my bed, next to Harry's clothes. I noticed that they were careful not to look at him. The three of them bowed before me and left the room, Poppy closing the doors behind her.
“Charlie, we're here," I called out, when I pulled away from Draco's lips.
I opened my mouth easily as if our time apart had never happened. Harry groaned against my lips as he slid his tongue into my mouth, sliding it across my own. The taste of his mouth was cool and crisp, like the apple he had taken a bite out of. My breath hitched in my throat when he pulled me flush against his body as I boldly slid my tongue against his, then swirled it against his cheeks. When I pulled away to draw air into my lungs, Harry shifted lower and latched onto my neck, sucking on a spot just below my ear that made my knees go weak. His hands slid around to the front of my robes and he began tugging on them to undo the buttons.
I began to thrust slowly, pulling myself almost completely free of his body, before sliding all the way back in. I reached between our bodies and wrapped my hand around his dick. I began to pump my fist up and down his shaft, keeping perfect rhythm with my thrusts.
I sat there for a moment, stunned by his action. I looked down and picked up my wrap. I bit into the flour tortilla, enjoying the taste of the chicken. We sat in silence and continued to finish our meals. Harry leaned over every now and then, planting small kisses on my lips and cheek. Joanna came over and replaced our empty glasses. “Harry, I think you should know that Kyle has been staring at you. In fact, he's staring now," she whispered.
I pulled the chicken out and set it on top of the stove. I took the lid off the mashed potatoes and the other lid off the asparagus. This was one of Charlie's favorite meals and I wanted it to be perfect.
“It's getting better. I was doing pretty good until everyone decided to floo here instead of apperating. Then all the ash and soot made me want to vomit," she said. She caught my hand and moved it to the left. Almost immediately, I felt a little nudging underneath my hand. I couldn't stop the smile that broke across my face.
