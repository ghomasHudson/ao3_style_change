“Where are we going?” But Yarney didn’t answer him, just motioned for him to stand. He led Draco out of the office and into a hallway of a part of the Ministry that Draco didn’t recognize from the long hours he used to spend as a child waiting on his father’s business meetings. They were walking so fast that Draco couldn’t keep track of the hallways—he only was able to identify some of the portraits that tsked as Draco was marched past.
Suddenly the memory was over, and Draco found himself back in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, facing Harry. Harry was red in the face and looked mortified, and Draco wondered if he had almost turned Cho Chang into...him.
Blaise laughed. “Can you guys even imagine? Draco and Potter, a couple?” Even Draco had to laugh at that one.
Narcissa tried her hardest to smile, but it wavered under the weight of the tears falling down her cheeks. After a few more pleasantries, her voice turned serious. “Dragon. I’ve heard things from the guards who read the
“Of course I do, Malfoy.” Harry sounded both annoyed and amused.
“I just know how much you care about your family. So it means a lot to me that you would risk them for me. Even though you absolutely don’t have to.”
“Hold on, Ginny,” Bill said with laughter. “Give us a minute to breathe, it was a long trip.”
“You don’t have to. Just because Ginny told you—“
“You shouldn’t open those,” Daphne said. “I’ll get rid of them.”
. Draco barely had time to brace himself before he and Narcissa were shoved into the room.
She held him at arms length and cupped his face in her hands. “Oh, my dragon. You look so much better than you did when you were last here.”
Harry smiled at him with patience. “You’re so cute. But look at all this work we have to do! Twenty four inches for Potions, nearly double that for Transfiguration, and only a few days left. We really should get to work.”
“That’s even worse,” Draco groaned, running his hands through his hair in frustration.
Harry laughed. “Draco, relax. Of course I’d want to, that sounds quite nice.”
“Thanks guys. Honestly I was so focused, I didn’t even see what the Patronus was.” When Draco mentioned this, Blaise started laughing. “What’s so funny?”
“Why not?” Greg asked, still nonchalantly eating his meal.
“Blimey, Potter, you want me to do better than that?” Draco complained. “I consider that one of my best days ever!”
Lacking the strength to argue, Draco treaded beside Ginny. His emotions were so confused at the moment that he had forgotten the girl beside him used to be with Harry.
“Could—could I sit here? Or are you waiting for others?” Harry stammered. A second passed before Draco could respond.
that even the younger Nott was wanted for questioning, and anyone who had an inkling of his whereabouts needed to report to the Ministry.
Draco felt quite numb as he walked back up to the eighth grade dormitory. His muscles were aching as though he had aged while in Azkaban even for that short amount of time. He had to lean on the stair railings heavily, shivering and feeling feverish. Thankfully he found the common area to be blissfully empty of anyone who would care where he had been—it was only a few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws playing a game in the corner.
Finally the doors shut, and it seemed like the trial was about to begin. Draco and Harry carefully coordinated sitting down, and Harry grabbed Draco’s hand, stroking the palm with his thumb. Draco couldn’t speak without drawing attention, but he wasn’t sure he would be able to anyway. He was filled with fear for his parents and an overwhelming sense of appreciation and adoration for the man sitting next to him.
That’s how Draco found himself waiting outside Professor McGonagall’s office. Surprisingly, she was the one he felt most comfortable approaching. She rarely spoke to him outside of class during his formative years, and therefore he never felt incredibly judged by her. Since it was somewhat of a spur of the moment decision to visit her, and it was the end of the week, he wasn’t able to ask her beforehand and get the password to the office. He sat quietly with his head on his knees, falling into a doze.
Draco tried to soothe his anxious mother. “Is something cooking? It smells delicious.” It was true—a warm and comforting scent wafted over to the kitchen table where Narcissa was forcing Draco into a chair.
When it was time for Draco to demonstrate the spell, he followed Harry’s instructions one by one.
“It was a lizard, wasn’t it?” Harry asked.
Let me know what you think! Isn’t Harry so clueless? It’s adorable but it reminds me of how he handled the whole Cho Chang situation, lol.
“Well, thanks.”
“What do you want, Potter?” It was true that Draco and Harry had talked quite a bit over the past few days, but only in their bedroom. Outside of their shared quarters, Draco attempted to keep up the same malice he always had over the years. It was the one thing that could stay the same. But Potter refused to participate—he just ignored insults.
It was odd to actually try and experience so much emotion. Draco spent the entire summer trying to swallow everything down and sit in the numbness. But Draco tried to listen to Potter, and let the feeling of his father’s love in particular ease over him. “
“Actually, mum, I’m really tired. Is there any chance we could talk about this later?” Draco met her concerned eye. “I promise I’m not angry or anything, this is just...a lot to think about.”
“Dobby never mentioned he didn’t like
Harry stopped Draco with a laugh. “I had a lot of fun, actually! You’re cute even when you’re wasted.”
“Kind of convenient, innit? That you just forgot about that part.” Yarney was dropping his professional tone.
“Your dishonesty is refreshing as always, Draco,” a familiar voice drawled. Professor Snape was smirking at Draco from his portrait.
“Fine, Potter. McGonagall forced me to get a checkup.”
Draco nodded and stood up. He embraced his mother and kissed her on the cheek. “Then I’ll see you in a few days. But—mum,” he said, suddenly serious. “If things get bad here...you’d let me know, wouldn’t you?”
“I see,” the reporter nodded. “And what of Lucius Malfoy? Do you anticipate him also being released from Azkaban?”
As always, comments are appreciated. Love you guys!
Draco’s heart fell.
Yarney’s eyes narrowed. “Your involvement in this incident obviously raises some suspicion.”
The only other eventful thing that happened during that week was Draco receiving a letter from Mr. Burke.
Draco wasn’t sure he could possibly move yet. He felt just as paralyzed as he did when he was on the ground with a bleeding nose.
“How are you, father?” Draco decided to practice his best etiquette.
Draco scoffed. “I’m not sure they would have cared. Well, my mom would have. I wouldn’t want her to, though.”
“For what?”
“Alright everyone,” Hermione turned to face the small crowd. “We’re rooming in pairs. Two pairs share a bathroom. Due to the new House Elf Liberation program, we’re going to have to clean up after ourselves a bit more; we only get cleanings every week.” Blaise rolled his eyes. Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care—he liked to be tidy as it was. “Your names are on your doors. Have a good night everyone, Neville and I will see you tomorrow morning for our first briefing.”
“I don’t make decisions that quickly. Or based on things like what people have done in their past.”
“I really am not. I have no idea how you got that, I have no idea where it came from. You all are grasping at straws just to make yourself feel better. I have no reason to go back in time and do all of this.”
?” He said more worriedly, and Harry burst out laughing. Draco nudged him sideways and threatened him until he finally spoke.
“Never hurts,” Draco mumbled. Out of the three, Granger definitely made him the most uncomfortable, but he didn’t much like being in Longbottom’s presence either. The two had some pretty brutal duels in the Carrows’ Dark Arts class, and Draco remembered that Neville had been on the receiving end of a few of his Cruciatus curses—and he was so full of self-loathing and jealously for Dumbledore’s Army at the time that he was sure the curse was painful.
However, this plan was derailed when he received a mysterious letter one early November morning. This was not unusual, but after the fiasco with the black liquid, Draco no longer opened letters that came from owls or had handwriting he didn’t recognize. As his friends and himself were sitting at the Great Hall, they were shocked by the owl that swooped down in front of them, cooing softly and dropping an envelope onto Draco’s plate.
“You look absolutely thrilled,” Draco quipped sarcastically.
“Hey, that spell technically killed Voldemort,” Harry said, mockingly offended. Draco fell asleep with a smile on his lips.
“No one asked for your opinion, Mud—hey!” Draco had tensed when Blaise said the first syllable of the curse word, but his cry of pain and Daphne’s glare told him he had nothing to fear.
Harry waved his wand so that his hair would turn to its normal coal black shade, and went inside, presumably to talk to Ron. He then ushered Draco in under the cloak, moving upstairs under the watchful and reproachful gaze of Ron so they could use Weasley’s Floo. Finally the two were back on safe grounds.
“Yes, Granger, he took glee in what we did. He was the only one. And now he’s dead, so congratulations.”
Draco nodded. “That’s fair. Harry.” He added Potter’s name at the end awkwardly.
He hoped the conversation would end there. “Of course, Draco! I’m so glad you’re deciding to be a better person. I always knew you had some good in you—everyone does, after all. You should take better care of yourself though, you look peaky—“
“No, absolutely not,” Harry didn’t match his tone. “Even Dean was horrified, I think. He was apologizing to you, saying he just meant it as a stupid prank, but you didn’t hear him. Everyone was concerned.”
!” He was knocked to the ground as about a half dozen students came forth out of the woods. While he was stunned and the world was moving slowly, someone took his wand from his pocket. It was too dark to see anything except for a flash of deep red.
Working to push down the negative emotions, Draco took a deep breath and knocked on the door.
Harry looked thoughtful. “Do you want to see the trial? Is that what you really, truly want?”
Draco quietly crept in the room, watching Harry sleep for a moment. He looked a little troubled without Draco by his side, but still beautiful. Draco saw flashes of what their lives could be if they were together. Sure, there would be enormous consequences. The
“I think we’re in too deep to judge each other for anything, Draco.”
Draco was actually taken aback. “You don’t know?” His voice softened, and then he morphed his face back into a hard expression. “Never you mind, Potter. Just leave me alone.”
“Just remember that he isn’t going on a date with you because he wants to do something in particular,” Gregory chimed in. “Vincent and I—“ he paused for a moment while Blaise and Daphne looked very surprised. It was rare for Greg to mention Vincent, both because of his own pain and because Vincent was so hated among the students. “We went on very few actual dates. Mostly we just talked, snuggled by the fire in the Room of Requirement, that sort of thing.”
Greg was the only one who kept on eating, seemingly unperturbed by this sudden announcement. Daphne and Blaise stared at Draco in shock, with Blaise’s fork clattering to his plate.
“Blaise, you were making a scene.” She took a deep breath. “We all need to learn how to be here for each other. We’re all each other has. Draco, if you had talked to one of us instead of running out yesterday, you may not have gotten attacked. I know we’ve never been a bunch to talk about our feelings, even last year, but I think we’ve reached a breaking point.”
Greg and Daphne nodded. “We knew you could do it, mate!”
“Lucius—“ Narcissa started, looking at Draco with panic.
I’m so glad you guys like this second installment so far! I’m not sure yet how long it’s going to be, so I’m leaving the number of chapters as a ? for now. You can expect updates every few days, I’m going to try and do every 3 days but it may vary as the new semester starts. I’m super excited to read all of your comments, so please keep them coming! :)
Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to see the second half, when Lucius was testifying. He wanted to stay and keep looking at his mother, he wanted to keep remembering that being a Malfoy couldn’t be so bad if she was a Malfoy. She held herself so well, the perfect mixture of elegance and honesty. He always looked to his father as a kid, but Draco suddenly felt as though he had been looking toward the wrong parent this whole time.
“Hi Draco,” Potter said quietly in an attempt not to startle Draco—he jumped anyway.
I’m SO sorry this is late! I literally got held up trying to think of who in the world would teach DADA after the war. Everyone is dead! So I had to make an OC which I’m not a fan of. Luckily they’re just a plot device. Hope to have the next chapter out in a few days! As always, your comments are lovely and help me keep going
“Tell me about this encounter with Nott.”
. He hadn’t time at Hogsmeade today to get her a present, but now it didn’t even matter—she wouldn’t be able to receive it.
Professor McGonagall sighed. “You’re not in trouble, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Harry? Harry, love, wake up.”
“No, I mean...” Harry sighed. “You know how Hagrid came back carrying me? And everyone thought I was dead?” Draco nodded. “Well, I
Draco’s mind was a pendulum, whooshing back and forth between a universe of an insane Lucius and a universe of a lucid one, and he paced along with his racing thoughts. After about an hour of back-and-forth across the room, he heard a knock at the door. Opening it, he found the three other Slytherins all with their arms crossed, glaring at him.
“You alright?” Harry asked, a concerned look on his face.
“Shh, we need to get inside, okay? We need to get to somewhere warm. I know where we can go and it isn’t far, but your fingertips are turning blue, love. Can you stand?”
“Well, I’m not going to. The next step of Occlumency is learning how to alter your own memories as you’re showing them. It’s similar to how people can alter their memories when they take them out to be put into a Pensive. You can change whatever you hated so much about that kiss.” Draco gave Harry a moment to think, and when he nodded, Draco began looking at Harry’s memory.
“It’s fine. They’re just helping me with something.” Draco tried to ward them off before anyone started an argument.
Something was wrong, something that had happened a few times this past summer and multiple times during sixth year, but that Draco hoped was an irregularity. He tried not to show to Potter his rapid breathing and shaking hands as he stood up to reach for his trunk. Spots flashed across his vision when he stood, and he found himself leaning on the wall.
Harry took off Draco’s shirt and threw it to the ground. This normally would have driven Draco crazy, but something had already captured his sanity. He loved the boy in front of him who didn’t care about being careless with expensive things. He loved the man in front of him who loved so deeply. Draco took off Harry’s simple shirt rather quickly, and moved to unbutton his own trousers, still trying to keep one hand on his boyfriend at all times.
Chapter 8
“Wait,” Draco said, something that Greg blurted out registering with him. “Did you say your dad’s sentence was extended?”
“I know, Draco, I know.” Harry sat next to Draco on his bed and put a hand on his leg. Shivers went up Draco’s spine, even though Harry’s hand was warm and comforting. “I trust you. I’m just so sorry that this is happening. This is the last thing that you need. I thought the Prophet would be done with all this sensational reporting after Skeeter got fired, but I guess that was too much to hope for.”
Draco scoffed and looked down. Professor McGonagall ignored this and continued. “I want you to go downstairs right now and get a physical examination from Madame Pomfrey.” Draco’s head shot up at this.
“You don’t. Yes, you were not a great person. But you’re trying, and more people should see that.”
Harry sat up and turned on the lamp, to Draco’s dismay. He winced at the light, which worsened his headache, and grabbed Harry’s arm as he put on his glasses and glanced at the thin figure next to him. “I know for a fact Madame Pomfrey didn’t discharge you at—“ he glanced at the clock. “—three in the morning.”
Greg flicked his wand and the letters settled into a nice pile in front of him. “It’s too bad, then, that I can use magic and you can’t,” he smirked.
“No one you know,” Draco said quickly. Then he thought—who would he know that Greg wouldn’t? Their families were very close and they went to school together for their whole lives. “Um...someone in France. We’ve been writing letters.”
“Now—I need to hear exactly what happened.” Draco recounted the story from the beginning, leaving out why he and Potter were on the bench in the first place. He also couldn’t bear to tell the Auror that Dolohov claimed his parents knew more than they were letting on, even though he knew that was an important detail. Thinking of his mother being dragged back into the Ministry for more  questioning sent chills down his spine. The Auror remained mostly silent while Draco was talking, frowning at a few details here and there and chiming in for some basic questions. The story took no longer than 10 minutes or so to tell, and then both sat in silence while the Auror made some notes.
“Um, don’t you have the entire Transfiguration essay to finish? You stay, I won’t be long.” At least, Draco hoped he wouldn’t be long.
“Yeah. Andromeda raises Teddy for now, but I’d like to have a big role in raising him. After all, it’s sort of my fault that he ended up orphaned like me.” Draco noticed that Harry tried to say the last part nonchalantly, but his eyes glazed over a bit.
Smith raised his hands in a placating gesture. “Woah, no need to lose your cool, Mr. Potter,” he said mockingly. “Wouldn’t want you to lose your high honor status at the Ministry in some school brawl. I was just commenting on how...surprised I am, that’s all.” Harry’s hand hesitated in his pocket. Apparently he didn’t expect Smith to back down. “So, is this like...a secret?”
spell. “Could you tone that down a bit?”
“What was that?” Longbottom asked.
“Could—could I ask you a question, Draco?”
A reply came quickly.
He couldn’t have spoken for more than half an hour, but he felt like his voice was a train where the brakes had been removed. A few times it seemed like the portrait of Professor Snape was going to interrupt him, but it was shushed by Dumbledore’s portrait. Draco told Professor McGonagall nearly everything—about the letter he had received and burned from Theodore Nott, about the newly resurrected Dumbledore’s Army (though he did not give up their location, and didn’t mention any name except for Ginny Weasley), and about the Time Turner. He did not, however, mention his relationship with Harry, but merely told the professor that he was being blackmailed. Professor McGonagall watched him evenly the whole time. A few times he paused, waiting for her to ask a question, but her silence encouraged him to continue. He felt empty by the end in the best possible way.
Even Madam Hale seemed surprised. “That is an...unusual decision, Mr. Burke. Are you sure that we should proceed?”
“Oh. That’s...nice I guess?” Draco was silent as Potter mulled this over. “Have you ever dated anyone?”
—and there were very few leads on where it could be. There were still about thirty Death Eaters that appeared in a section of the Prophet dedicated to rewards for their capture, dead or alive.
The car ride was blissfully silent, and then Draco entered Wiltshire. Malfoy Manor appeared like a looming, dark cloud. It looked a great deal better than it had when Draco left in September. The window panes had been washed and some of the roof tiles replaced. The gardens were not flourishing but were no longer overrun with weeds. Draco wasn’t sure if it was the work of his mother or house elves, but he hoped it was the former and done as a sign of healing.
And they did keep trying, but Draco was unsuccessful every time. They tried using a different memory, tried different hand motions, even cast different spells after a while to make sure that Draco’s magic hadn’t suddenly left him completely. Finally, Draco shoved his wand back in his pocket.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was reminded of the manacle still on his wrist. If his father chose to attack him, there would be nothing he could do. “I will live my life as I see fit, Father.”
“I have this application to see my parents before their retrial. I know I want to see my mother, but...I’m not sure I want to see my father.”
She nodded to Neville who started speaking, as though they had meticulously rehearsed this little presentation. “We’ve all been through a lot. Some of us were here last year and it was awful, some of us weren’t here last year and it was also awful. But we made it through the War, and a lot of people didn’t. This year is about honoring those people, and honoring ourselves by making sure it is as good a year as it can be.”
. Draco remembered that the Aurors were quite unhelpful with the events of the past seven years. Lucius would often lead them away from any findings regarding the Dark Lord. The professor who had You-Know-Who on the back of his head was Dumbledore’s fault, the Chamber of Secrets being opened had reflected further incompetence of the Headmaster, Cedric Diggory had died due to negligence...the list of excuses continued, and everyone believed the Malfoy patriarch. Draco had believed him, too.
“No, I don’t think so. I think it’s more like that we have to acknowledge the roles everyone played. Some students died that were on Voldemort’s side too.” Everyone, including Draco, flinched at the mention of the Dark Lord’s name. Draco felt Harry’s gaze but continued to look at the carpet.
“Oh yeah. Pansy, Vince, Greg, Blaise, Theo, all the other kids in my lessons, we’d all get together on a snowy day and have a snowball fight. We had to do it out of sight of our parents though, they found it quite unbecoming. How about you?”
“Merlin,” Blaise sighed. “It’s going to be so unbearable with Potter here now.” He turned to Draco. “We were talking about our new living arrangements on the train. All the eighth years are going to share one dorm room instead of being divided into houses—for
Love love LOVE your comments! Keep them coming. I love you guys! Yay for 100 Kudos!
Draco’s heart fell and he stared at the paper miserably. “I know.” He had written into the
“Sod off Malfoy! You should be in Azkaban along with your loser parents,” he heard a voice snarl.
“I just hope we can still be friends. People always say that but it rarely actually happens. And I do genuinely
“You,” Mr. Burke started in a very cold tone. “Are very lucky.”
Narcissa glanced at Mr. Burke hopefully. Draco wondered if she even knew that he wouldn’t be called as a witness today. “No, Madam,” Mr. Burke said somewhat bitterly. Inside the Invisibility Cloak, Harry put his hand on Draco’s, as if sensing that the only thing Draco wanted to do was run out to the center of the courtroom and be a witness to help his mother.
Draco looked at Harry. “What Muggles hated you?”
“I know,” Draco said truthfully. “I’m going to do everything I can to not let that happen.” Seemingly satisfied, Ginny nodded and let him go once they reached the grounds of Hogwarts. She didn’t follow him inside, but went to return to whatever she was doing in the Forbidden Forest. Draco wondered if she was doing alright.
“What the hell was that about?” Blaise asked incredulously. “When did you and Lovegood talk?”
As if reading his mind, Harry stood up and offered him a hand. “Well, I am. And I’ve had quite enough of other people for one day—how about we go to the kitchens?”
“What’s wrong?” Draco looked concerned at Harry’s crestfallen expression.
“What apology? What does he have to apologize—“
Draco thought about demanding that the man take him up the nearly half-kilometer driveway, but decided against it. He began to take his time carrying his trunk up the long pathway. He took in the smells of the flowers, noticing that they had bloomed slightly since he had been here in the dry summer. Fallen leaves crunched beneath his feet, and he made a mental note to ask Tilly to clean it up, if the house elf even stayed throughout the Malfoy’s absence.
Ginny shrugged and let Draco into the shack. It was a little lighter inside, and everything felt less formal than the last time Draco went there. Draco was not shoved into a chair, but merely sat down in one of the many there were to choose from. Everyone looked forlorn and tired, as they had the last time but without fear and some even without hatred in their eyes.
“Rough night, mate?” Blaise drank some of his coffee.
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt a sharp prick in his arm, and everything went black.
“But—“ Draco looked helplessly toward the door where he knew somewhere his mother was waiting on the other side. “You could go, and I could stay here—“
Ughhhh my poor boys. I love them so much. I also realized that this is the 13th chapter and we’re like a week into the school year, lol. My friends have been asking how long I’m planning on writing this fic, and I’m not even close to halfway! I hope you guys don’t get tired of it. Love to all, keep commenting what you like/want to see!
To Draco’s horror, once again his eyes filled with tears. Nothing was going right anyway—his parents were in Azkaban, he couldn’t do magic...Mr. Burke was asking him to do the impossible by making everything better again. If everything was going downhill, he may as well enjoy himself along the ride.
“What’ll you do with him?”
“Fine,” Draco said through gritted teeth. He picked up his wand and put it back in his robe pocket. “You startled the living daylights out of me.”
“When are they going to release you?” Narcissa finally asked quietly.
“She’s strong, Draco. You know that. Her love for you is the strongest part of her, too. She’ll make it through to see you again. I promise,” Daphne put a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Next to him, Potter looked contemplative. “It’s so hard to choose something.”
“Draco, sweetheart,” Narcissa said, putting her hand on Lucius’s outstretched arm. “You’re very young, and have been through so much in such a short time. I understand that you may be having these...feelings, but perhaps they will change. Even if they don’t, it is not uncommon for men with your...preferences to take wives for the purposes of carrying on the name, and fulfilling their pleasures covertly.”
Draco had never taken the Hogwarts express alone before. It was unsettling. He at first picked a compartment near the door, but found himself unable to sit still. The trees whirring past him in the window made him feel sick. He decided to walk around, and spent his time going to the loo, visiting the Prefects’ cart, and walking back to the front of the train over and over. There were no students chatting or flinging magical objects at each other. There was no trolley with candies to get excited about. It was just him and his thoughts.
“No. Not officially. I was the only student that was.” Draco grit his teeth—he really didn’t want to talk about Crabbe.
The rest of the week was a surprisingly a good one for Draco. He spent the majority of his time getting caught up on schoolwork and corresponding with his mother over letters. His father’s trial was supposed to begin to take place the same afternoon that his mother was released, but an hour in and the Wizengamot found that Lucius Malfoy was in no state to answer questions. He was sent to St. Mungo’s for rehabilitation, with his trial postponed until a later date. Draco’s mother implored him to visit Malfoy Manor the following weekend, and then they would both be allowed to visit Lucius in the hospital under Ministry supervision. Draco didn’t feel like he could say no to that request.
“Very true,” Draco said quietly.
Draco thought about it for a moment. He had a wonderful week. He loved being with Harry. The jeers and negative comments actually hadn’t been too bad, but Draco suspected that was because Ginny and Dean called off most of the naysayers until his week was up. Draco wasn’t sure what it was going to be like next week. He did know, however, that it didn’t matter. He wanted this bliss to last much longer than a week. “I’m not.”
. “Alright. Thanks for the hot chocolate. I’ll be going now.”
changed your mind?”
. “I got my tongue cut out,” he mumbled, clenching his fist.
“Ahh...” the Ravenclaw gave a humorless laugh and smirk. “You don’t remember me, do you? Don’t remember torturing me for nearly half an hour?” His voice quieted as he took a step forward. “Maybe I should do the same to you...”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Draco pushed the thought of his inability to do magic away and instead clapped  dramatically for Harry.
“I guess,” Draco said, not quite convinced. But he smiled for Harry anyway. “Thank you, love. It really has been nice here. But I think I’ll try and go back to the manor for Christmas. Patch things up.”
“I can’t stay for long, mother. But I just had to see you.” He bent near her and took her hand.
“Meeting someone today, Mother? Surely you aren’t discarding Father that easily...” Draco said jokingly.
Things took a turn during the next year. Draco was under a lot of pressure now that the Dark Lord had returned, and their parents wanted to solidify the betrothal. But Draco rejected all advances on the part of both Pansy and his parents, the latter of which had more important things to worry about at the time. However, it desperately hurt his relationship with Pansy. Finally, in sixth year, Draco had no other choice but to tell her that he was gay. She was a little smug about this, because she had worried that he liked another girl. Showing the strong bond of their friendship, she agreed not to tell anyone.
“Turn yourself in for what? Did you even play any part in this? Are you hiding something from the Aurors?”
Narcissa cleared her throat. “My husband, son, and I sat in the Great Hall, awaiting further instructions.”
“Professor McGonagall is alright with us going to the Ministry today. We can even use her Floo,” Hermione said happily. She wasn’t wearing her Hogwarts robes today, just a professional blazer and skirt. She also held a stack of folders in her hands, presumably something about house elves. Though Draco wasn’t sure at all how he felt about the creatures, he couldn’t help but admire her perseverance. He used to have the same kind of drive.
“I’ve said that enough times to know when it’s a lie. I know what’s happening tomorrow,” Harry stole a glance at Draco, watching his wince. “and I know that you probably don’t want to talk about it. So I’m here specifically to not talk about it with you. We can talk about anything else or we can just be quiet. We can even take our meals in the kitchens today, if you’d like. Just to get away.”
“That sounds amazing,” Potter said, but then frowned. “I’m not sure it’ll be enough, though. Maybe the last part about your father.”
He gathered his trunk, Harry’s jacket safe inside, and stepped off the train onto Hogwarts grounds near the Forbidden Forest. Strangely, though, the thestrals were not waiting to pull him to the school as he had been assured they would be. He rolled his eyes, annoyed at the prospect of having to walk nearly a mile to his dorm, but shuffled his shoulder bag and started on his way. Something inside of him called out a warning, but he pushed it aside. He didn’t want to be anxious, he wanted to be excited.
“Then I’m not sure it’ll be too much of an issue. Barely anyone talks to my parents these days, and my friends won’t tell their parents. Thankfully the pureblood gossip circle is pretty closed off to outsiders.”
Harry nodded. “Okay. Then we will get you there.”
Draco wasn’t even sure what he was talking about anymore, and apparently neither was Potter, because the latter just kept murmuring comforting nothings into his ear. Draco had been tortured, sliced all over his body, so ill that he couldn’t eat, but he wasn’t sure he had ever felt as sick in his life. Memories slipped through his mind like fragments and the world swayed. He felt like he was drowning—it was actually getting harder to breathe.
Harry looked startled, as though he had forgotten Draco was there. “Bits and pieces, I think. I remember riding on my first broomstick. I remember feelings sort of, like feeling loved and safe. But nothing too specific.” He sighed and tripped a little, as though the weight of the emotions was too much for him to stand upright. “That’s what I hate the most, I think. I want to remember something else about them, something more than just stories I’ve heard. I want to know what they liked to do, who cooked the most, who was in charge of which chores, what their favorite type of music was. Everyone tells me about their heroic acts, but I want to know the mundane things. I don’t want to learn more about James and Lily Potter, the war heroes. I want to learn about my parents.” Tears slipped down Harry’s face.
. I just mean not now. You’ve been really sick, I—I want to wait until you really want to do something like this.”
“Does that mean he wasn’t a Death Eater, though? Maybe he had some sort of special assignment,” Blaise said thoughtfully.
Draco’s heart raced—this he didn’t expect. “What, all the blokes will share a dorm? There’s got to be at least ten of us.”
Chapter Two
“It’s—it’s not always that simple.” Draco swallowed thickly. “When I was dragged into...everything, I didn’t want to be involved. But I never would have turned myself in. Or my family.”
“Alright,” Harry said, getting out the Invisibility Cloak. “But getting back by Floo Powder unnoticed is going to be a lot harder. I don’t suppose the Vanishing Cabinet is still working?”
Potter gave a sigh and finally turned around—also freezing in his tracks. “Mal—Draco. I’m sorry, I—“ he looked around as if there was something else to see besides Draco’s shocked face. “I didn’t know you were in here or I wouldn’t have—I mean, I was just trying to escape all the people, you know, and find somewhere quiet.” Potter stopped here, clearly expecting Draco to speak, but his tongue was frozen. Draco’s heart was beating rapidly. Having not talked for a majority of the summer, and having only really talked to his parents, he didn’t know what to say.
And apparently that meant making polite conversation with one of your worst victims of bullying.
“Huh. I wouldn’t have thought him the tidy type. I guess that’s one area where you two will get along,” Blaise smirked.
Narcissa sat on the edge of her husband’s bed and leaned in closely. “He owes us. I saved Harry Potter’s life.”
“Fine, thank you. I have the application to see my parents,” Draco handed Mr. Burke the form. He put it in the inside pocket of his coat.
Draco couldn’t explained why this unsettled him so much. He was used to being lonely, but he was not used to being alone. Whenever he needed something, there was always an easy way to get it. And now it seemed that he had no allies. Without a posse, he didn’t know who he was or what he could do. He closed his eyes and leaned his head against the window, praying that he would be uninterrupted the whole journey.
“I know, Dragon, but they’re being quite generous given the...circumstances. I think that we should just hear them out. I know that you and Pansy had a lot of falling outs over the past year, but both of you were in very stressful situations. It’s remarkable how different things can be when—“
As always, comments are much appreciated. I love you guys!
“Drop out of school?”
“Well shouldn’t one of you go talk to him?”
“Did you guys know that everyone here always sits in the same seats in the Great Hall? The other houses intermingle sometimes, but we don’t,” Longbottom continued. “We need to set the example here. We need to start spending more time together.”
“I think if you can go to the Malfoy Gardens, that would be a really cute idea,” Daphne said. “You could bring food, take a walk, get to know each other.”
Draco stood up from the Gobstones table and nodded. “Yup, let’s go.” Thank goodness his friends refrained from any untoward or obnoxious comments.
Another wizard swiftly interrupted her. “How were the Aurors not notified? Isn’t the Malfoy Manor being monitored by wards?” He wasn’t speaking to her so much as Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister of Magic, who sat only slightly raised among the members of the Wizengamot, not drawing attention to himself.
Draco shook his head vehemently. “Not one bit.”
“Would you though?” Harry broke him out of his reverie.
“Draco! Draco it’s alright!”
“What about my husband? I don’t get to stay for his trial?”
Also, did you know Theodore Nott’s dad doesn’t have a canon name? I’m super bad with names so I just decided his name would also be Theodore.
“Not at all.”
An Occlumency lesson leads to a disturbing realization, and a forced confrontation of feelings.
“—so you better make sure you’re serious about all this before you get too far. It’s not going to be easy. People on your end are going to be angry with Draco, people on our end are going to be uncomfortable since you two can’t produce an heir. They may think you’re holding something over Draco’s head, too, since you’re not even a pureblood. If you’re not ready for the full wrath of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, you may as well tell us now and take your leave.” While Draco certainly didn’t like Daphne claiming that he wasn’t actually tough, she had a point about the pureblood families. He remained silent while Harry contemplated this.
Yarney mumbled a thanks and tossed the lighter colored cloak to Draco. “Put this on.”
Harry hurriedly led Draco upstairs to Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office, where presumably the others were waiting. Draco was shaking, knowing that he didn’t have the emotional capacity to handle any snide remarks at this point, but his small disguise worked well enough for him to escape notice. Harry, though, was not so lucky.
Finally, the hour was up. “Well, Draco,” Christine leaned back in her chair. “I do think that you have something called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.”
that he wouldn’t be able to do this. The Boy Who Lived was good at so many things, but he specifically picked something that he knew Draco couldn’t do. Supposedly he said that Snape successfully produced a Patronus despite his Death Eater status, but Snape was one of the greatest wizards Draco had ever known. How was Draco supposed to replicate that when he had trouble performing even simple spells with his new wand?
“What? I didn’t hear anything about this stupid project,” Zabini grumbled from Draco’s left.
It was legitimately difficult to remember that month, Draco was so ill. He couldn’t keep food down and he spent full days in bed, barely mustering the energy to walk to his bathroom. His father at first tried to comfort him and apologized endlessly for failing his son so greatly; then he got angry. He once tried to physically pull Draco out of bed, but the war had weakened him significantly, and even malnourished Draco could overpower him. That rare violent confrontation between Draco and his father did transform Lucius Malfoy back into a more recognizable version of himself—he even started doing business dealings again, and soon forgot about Draco. Good, Draco had thought. At least I can be of some use to this family.
Granger smiled. “You really like him, don’t you?” Again, Draco didn’t answer. “Are you two officially an item?”
After everyone else presented and the period finished, Draco met his friends outside, with Harry next to him. Harry turned and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “That was phenomenal.”
“What?”
“You already have. Because I cannot trust you enough to be a witness at tomorrow’s trial.” Mr. Burke put a hand on his briefcase and stood up suddenly. “I think we are done here. I’m sure you’ll be able to hear the outcome from the
There were a few false starts to Draco waking up that night. He fell asleep to Hagrid’s low, gruff yet somehow soothing voice, with Harry responding in between. Then there was a period where everything was quiet, but Draco still felt Harry’s presence next to him. Then, sometime later, he felt his body shift to lying horizontally on the couch, and felt the sudden cold on the side previously touching Harry but now replaced by a blanket—it wasn’t enough. His sleepy mind tried to suppress the shivers—of course Harry wouldn’t want to sit up the whole night, and he shouldn’t feel like he had to. Draco opened his eyes blearily to sneak a peek, just to make sure Harry was still there. He wasn’t. It was still dark outside, but Draco needed to find him. Upon sitting up, however, and promptly vomiting into a well-placed bucket as the world spun around him, he decided that he would look in the morning.
Now it was Harry’s turn to pull Draco in close, taking some of the lead. He unbuttoned Draco’s suit jacket without question, but his fingers hesitated at the collar of his undershirt. “Yes,” Draco whispered. “One thousand times, yes.”
. He tried to push down the shame that Harry had seen him so vulnerable—and even deeper inside of him, the shame that he was so rude to someone who tried to comfort him.
“Well enough. I’ll be taking my leave then,” Mr. Burke stood up with a grunt and took his briefcase. “You’ll be hearing from me soon. In the meantime, stay on Hogwarts grounds, inside when you can. Stay out of trouble. Whatever anyone like Potter or Granger or anyone favored by the Ministry tells you to do or say, just do it. Don’t pick any fights, and don’t get too close to people like Goyle or Zabini. Stay quiet and hidden—out of sight, out of mind. It’s your responsibility to protect your family now. One misstep and this could all go downhill really quick. You can do all that, can’t you, boy?”
Greg nodded. “That’s definitely a crush, mate! You should ask him to Hogsmeade.”
. “I wasn’t trying to cover anything up, I genuinely forgot!” Draco raised his voice subconsciously, even though he knew he looked extremely defensive.
Harry laughed. “Here,” he said, fixing Draco’s nose with only a brief sharp pain and also cleaning his shirt. “I’m so sorry about that.”
“Wow, high praise coming from you,” Harry rubbed at his forehead, but looked somewhat proud.
“It was amazing, trust me. I’ll always have that memory. And now you do, too.” Harry laced his hands through Draco’s fingers, and the latter finally cracked a smile.
Draco scribbled out a negatory response as he heard his mother descend the stairs. He was sure he could take the Knight Bus to the neighborhood of the Burrow, and walk from there.
Draco felt sweat on his brow, the hot air constricting his throat. “Can—can you make it cooler in here?”
would.
Draco was shoved inside somewhere that was much too bright, and he heard the sound of a dog barking. Warmth started to envelope him but it was extremely unpleasant at first, and burned his hands and feet. He made a strangled sound as Harry put him on a couch and began to take off his shoes. Draco had previously stopped shivering but the warmth brought the cold back. How was that possible?
“Tell them we’re dating? I was going to talk to you about that. Aren’t you visiting your parents this weekend?”
“Yes, dear, of course.” Madame Pomfrey seemed to forget all about Draco and rushed to get whatever Potter asked for. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco tossed in his bed, already hearing Harry snoring which was both cute and irritating. He tried to turn his thoughts to happier things—he had a date to plan! Of course their options were severely limited, so he would likely have to take Harry to Hogsmeade. Although, maybe he could convince Harry to use his Invisibility Cloak. He still wasn’t sure about the exact parameters of the manacle that he had to wear on his wrist until he graduated from Hogwarts, but he never got a reprimand for the Ministry from their outing to Godric’s Hollow. The advantage here was Harry’s Muggle upbringing—what could Draco show him about the Wizarding World that would make him fall in love with it as much as the world had fallen in love with him?
He wasn’t sure what to do. Should he try and visit Lucius again? What if his father had gotten worse? What if his father had seen a
“Well—yeah of course,” Potter gave Draco a side glance. “But I wanted to talk to you about—“
Draco raised a brow. “I thought you were one of the best potioneers Slughorn had ever seen?”
Draco thought he had been standing this whole time. Why else would his legs hurt so much? Being pulled to his feet, though, was a new level of pain. He cried out and grabbed for something—his vision faded and he could barely see.
The memory that was making his stomach turn now, though, was the fact that when he would go to the dungeon to bring the prisoners just enough bread and water to keep them alive, Luna always said hello to him. She would remark that he wasn’t looking well, and that everything was going to be okay. The other prisoners would often glare at him, move away in fear, or shout obscenities in his direction, but never Luna. A small solace for him was that he never had to torture her specifically.
“Is he alright?” Draco tried to ask nonchalantly—but for some reason he truly was concerned about Potter.
“Oh! I’ll get them.” She walked away—steadily and with her shoulders strong, Draco noted happily—and came back with a plate of cookies. “Sugar with sprinkles is still your favorite, yes? They may not be the same, I had to make them myself, but I figured since you haven’t had them in so long—“ Draco cut off Narcissa by standing up and taking her in his arms. He was only a little embarrassed at the tears that ran down his cheeks.
Granger cleared her throat. “As I was saying, the Mind Healers can provide treatment for PTSD.”
This was one of the many times during the conversation that Ron’s eyes narrowed. Mrs. Weasley had always been a way for Draco to bother Ron the most. “That’s nice,” Draco said curtly.
“Why do I have to spell everything out for you? Clearly your survival hasn’t depended on intelligence,” Draco sneered. When Potter just waited for him to respond, he said “Death Eaters can’t produce a Patronus” through gritted teeth.
Bill and Fleur had clearly also been told about Draco, because they just gave him friendly nods as well. Ginny immediately stood up. “Okay, we’ve got me, Harry, Malfoy, George, Ron, and Bill. We can play three on three.”
Harry bit his lip. “It was about Fred. Him dying. That I’m used to, but...then the whole Weasley family died. And I was paralyzed, there was nothing I could do to stop it.” Harry wiped his face angrily. “I just wish it would stop. When I’m awake and doing things, I’m mostly fine. But at night, when it gets quiet, I—“ Harry broke off, no longer able to speak.
“In this weather?” Mrs. Weasley objected. “You’ll all freeze to death.” She shook her head mockingly. “He should be getting here any minute.”
Draco thought for a moment. That wasn’t really what scared him about the whole situation. “No. I’m not.”
The offer was tempting, but Draco knew that not returning to his room would arouse suspicion. The last thing he needed was Potter trying to follow him again. “I’m alright. I appreciate it.”
“Would you two calm down? People are starting to stare!” Daphne hissed. It was true; Potter and his friends were now looking at Draco, who had both hands flat on the table as though he was going to spring up and attack Goyle, who was incredibly red in the face.
“No, I haven’t. I feel cowardly, not wanting to face him.” Christine raised her eyebrows. “I feel like some of what he says is true. And I’m his son, it would be weird not to see him.”
“You—what?”
!” Dolohov must have spoken the curse to give it more effect. Draco flew backward and hit his head on a lamppost, body going limp. He looked around woozily through the haze of pain—there was no one around to help, he was going to get taken and there was nothing that could be done. He felt a trickle of blood sliding down the back of his neck. He could barely see from the concussion.
“Yes,” he said sternly.
“I—er,” Potter sighed. “I overheard you once, after Slughorn’s party. Talking to Snape, and he was trying to look into your mind.” Draco was enraged as he remembered that night.
“I tried to drop out.”
“It was after...their confrontation in the Forbidden Forest.” Narcissa didn’t need to name the other involved person for them to know who it was. “The Dark Lord commanded me to check to make sure Potter was dead. I wanted to know if Draco was alive, so I asked him. He nodded slightly, and I told the Dark Lord that he was dead.”
“So...Weasley,” Draco still used Ron’s last name, but without any malice and more as a formality. “How is that joke shop doing?” Draco tried not to say sarcastically.
“Did that hurt? Maybe you should go to Pomfrey.”
Even with the Invisibility Cloak, remaining hidden was a daunting task. He was sure that he bumped into at least ten people on his way down to the courthouse, and he always had to wait by a door for someone else to open it. Thankfully, oddities were the norm in the Ministry, and no one stopped to investigate what may have knocked their coffee over.
“Good,” she said. “See you tomorrow morning.”
“However, I’m not going to be held hostage because of something that I didn’t do and that I don’t want any part of. I’m going to the Ministry first thing tomorrow morning to report everything that I know about the Time Turner. I’ll leave your names out of it, if you’d like, or you can come with me and help me explain things. Or you can destroy it yourself if you want, but I want to watch it be destroyed so I can know for sure. I’m not going to be blackmailed anymore. I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart for everything that I did, and I know that it will never come close to being enough.” Draco took a deep breath. This was the hard part. “I probably don’t even know half the things that I’ve done to you all. Some of you have hinted at the consequences of my actions in the discussion groups, or in private, but if you at all want to tell me something you’re mad at me for, or something you hate about me or my family, or whatever you want, I’m willing to listen. I’m serious,” he added when Ginny and Dean looked at each other.
!” Blaise’s wand flew out of his hand, and Justin’s followed it across the room soon after. Potter stood with his wand out. “This has to stop. I did not kill Voldemort only so we could fight each other. And I’m sure you all didn’t fight so things could end up back where we were either.” Justin, breathing heavily, reluctantly sat back down. Granger quickly attended to his nose with a flick of her wrist.
Draco pushed open the door to the Potions classroom to find Potter worriedly standing over a cauldron. Something smelled...very off.
It was then that Draco realized how little his friends actually asked him for advice. “It seems like you made the right decision.”
Greg didn’t even turn around. “I could ask the same of you,” he said in a quiet voice.
They both sat staring at each other, communicating more with their eyes than words could ever say. They were only interrupted by a Ravenclaw battle cry as twirling, charmed snowballs hit Draco right in the face. Harry laughed, and led Draco into battle.
“Well, yeah. Every pureblood family has insanely valuable artifacts. I’m sure the Blacks have tons of fascinating ones.”
!” Justin flung the spell in Blaise’s direction.
“Well, they’ve managed to get a little out of Dolohov. A lot of the information is secret, but it seems that Nott—the older one—is taking the lead on the new Death Eater movement.”
“Well...would that have been true?” Draco looked at the ground, unusually unsure. “Here—“ Harry said, and led him to a secluded bench in a quiet corner of the castle. They both sat down, waiting for the other to speak.
“Harry, I can’t even tell where it’s coming from.” The pool that Draco was lying comfortably in suddenly vanished, and he shook harder with the chill that its absence brought. “Ah, it’s coming from his arm. Shouldn’t be too difficult.
Thanks to Harry’s presence, Draco was able to get a decent amount of sleep that night. Harry gently pushed him awake bright and early the next morning, and they both got ready in silence. Hermione was already brewing tea when they entered the common room.
“Death Eater scum. Not so brave now that your master’s gone are you?” Draco didn’t recognize the dark-haired boy even when he spun around to take a closer look.
Draco sat down with Harry, and the two never broke their kiss. It was long and deep but still awkward—they hadn’t done this very much, hadn’t gone far at all. Draco gasped for breath between kisses, barely keeping back tears, and tried to express the urgency through his body that he couldn’t convey to Harry with his words. He felt blood rush to every organ and every patch of skin, and noticed a tightening below. He shifted so that his mouth was on Harry’s neck, kissing every inch of skin he could find.
“I know,” Daphne said softly. “We can just start small, though. Like Draco did. I’m really proud of you for apologizing to Lovegood, by the way,” Daphne said. “It’ll make you feel better too.”
“That’s a great point, Neville. I would love to hear his side of things. Tell me, Malfoy, what were you doing while students were screaming in your family’s dungeon?”
“But—my probation requires it.”
Love to all! Next chapter should be sometime early next week.
“Well, well,” a familiar voice drawled when he entered. “An unscheduled meeting, isn’t this? I’m surprised. Perhaps it has something to do with the latest rumor spreading across the school?” Draco reddened at the hint that Professor Snape knew he was dating Harry Potter.
Draco smiled as he let the memory wash over him. “When I was seven, I woke up to the smell of cinnamon rolls that Dobby had made. I ran downstairs, and there were mounds and mounds of presents under the tree. My parents were up and snuggling on the couch. I got everything I wanted that year, but that wasn’t even the best part. It was snowing just the right amount, and it wasn’t too cold. My friends came over and we all went sledding together and had a big snowball fight. It must have been hours before we came inside shivering in our wet clothes, but my mother had hot chocolate ready for us all. Then all the families gathered to the Manor, not for a formal gala or anything, but just to have dinner together and spend time chatting. After dinner, my friends and I all fell asleep on the couch. My mother still has the picture of us sprawled next to each other. My father carried me to bed and tucked me in once everyone else had left. I think he thought I was sleeping, so he whispered that he loved me, which was rare for him.” As he told the story, Draco had somewhat lost track of where he was and who he was with. He blushed as he met Potter’s beaming face.
Draco tore through the cabinets of the bathroom, looking for Dittany, a Bezoar, Essence of Murlap, any potion or item that might stem the bleeding. He couldn’t find anything useful, and now blood was everywhere on the counter. Panic rose up inside `of him, even though he knew that a fast heart rate was not going to help the situation.
“No,” Harry said. “Children are forgiving. He’ll only know the you that you are now. And Andromeda—she’ll completely understand why you had to leave, maybe better than anyone. Maybe it will be good for you two to chat.”
Draco sighed, but was secretly grateful that the burden of the words was no longer on him.
—and his heart shattered. He pulled away, the movement awkward both with his embarrassment and illness. “Right. I understand.”
Gregory was now meeting Draco’s gaze with hope in his eyes. “She was imprisoned in my home, Blaise. I’m sure that wasn’t a pleasant time.”
He felt a hand on his shoulder steadying him. “Draco...” Harry didn’t seem to know what to say. He helped Draco sit on a nearby staircase.
Everyone either groaned or looked uncomfortable. “So tonight,” Granger seemed to be bracing herself for backlash. “We’re going to share one story about something that happened to us in the past year. And that’s how we’re going to start every meeting until the end of the term.”
It was as if Harry could read his mind. “Try not to worry about that right now. If by tomorrow you still have all ten fingers and ten toes and can feel them, I’ll be happy.”
“That’s—that’s not why I’m telling you guys! I’m telling you because either I’m overthinking this and something else is wrong, or I messed up and I need to fix it. I want to keep being his friend.”
“Draco, Merlin, it’s alright.” Someone was speaking, it sounded like Harry but that wasn’t possible. All he said to Harry was that he was going for a walk, Harry had no way of knowing where he would have been. Had he been followed out of the shack?
Harry continued, rubbing at his forehead. “Do you know what I would do if you had gotten in trouble? If you had gotten yourself thrown into Azkaban? I—“ He sank down into a chair and gave a deep sigh.
“Well I know it’s not because you’re intimidated by my apparent heroism...”
Draco’s chest swelled with pride at the thought of his mother being so brave. But then he was filled with guilt at the fact that she nearly died protecting him. He put his head back in his hands. “She risks too much for me...”
So he steeled himself, pushed away thoughts of self-interest, and asked:
He tried to push it out of his head over the next few days. He and Harry were continuing with their lessons, both making some progress but Harry shining far brighter than Draco. Harry seemed extra focused after his visit to his parents’ grave, which had actually brightened his mood considerably, but Draco’s mind couldn’t be stilled.
“We’d have to get someone to unlock the manacle, I can’t do magic with it on.”
“Then it’s a date!” Daphne chimed in.
Harry sat next to him after Draco slowly sank into the giant couch. He pulled out something from his pocket. It was a large piece of paper that looked like it could fold dozens of times. Harry also took out his wand, and tapped the paper three times. “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
“I was trying to talk sense into Madame Rosmerta. She said that she’d be willing to let you enter her pub as soon as your parents are retried and she knows that...that you’re not up to anything.”
! Trying not to disturb Harry, who was reminiscing amicably with Kingsley, Draco coaxed the cloak out from Harry’s side. Harry noticed at the last possible second and tried to grab the end, but Draco was able to pull the fabric away. “Excuse me, Minister, I have to run to the loo.”
Harry sighed again and sat on the end of his bed, facing Draco. “I broke up with Ginny.”
“No need, Harry, I can speak for myself.” Thank goodness Draco found his voice. He knew that sometimes saying nothing was the worst thing one could possibly do when faced with a bully. He had been on both ends of that—he loved it when first years cowered before him, and he hated it when he felt powerless in front of the Dark Lord. “They don’t mind my personal life too much. They have other concerns. I’m sure your parents are concerned about your lack of suitors, though. Need any advice?” Inwardly, Draco breathed a sigh of relief. Somewhere, deep down, the snarky old Draco Malfoy was still there, able to release comebacks and be a jerk when needed.
. He knew how much hate he had to feel in order for the Cruciatus curse to work, and he didn’t think that he could have mustered that anger for Potter, especially in that moment.
“I will,” Draco said, and he truly meant it. “You as well, Pot—Harry,” he said, correcting himself last minute from using Harry’s last name. “This isn’t going to be a one-sided friendship, not on my watch. I’m here for you anytime, anywhere.”
“What big thing?”
“Professor Snape told me. So I imagine he didn’t do the cooking.”
“What are you doing up so early, mate?”
Draco was literally jerked to attention as the boat made contact with the land. Yarney got out of the boat with ease, but Draco stumbled as his legs were shaking so badly. Yarney sighed, rolled his eyes, and grabbed Draco’s arm. The proximity to Yarney’s silver owl Patronus helped Draco focus.
They were stopped dozens of more times as they navigated their way up to the Ministry. When they finally reached the elaborate office, they found Hermione and Neville sitting before Kingsley Shacklebolt’s desk, and Daphne, Blaise, and Greg standing behind them, looking uncomfortable.
“The artifacts?”
“Why don’t you ask your Mind Healer, then? Maybe there is a cure and people are just hiding it from me.”
Draco had Alchemy this morning while Harry had Ancient Runes. Normally they wouldn’t see each other until the end of the day, or possibly at mealtimes. Draco was certainly happy at the surprise encounter, but also nervous—he certainly wasn’t the best version of himself today, not at all the person that he wanted Harry to see. But what else could he say? “Of course,” and Harry fell in step beside him.
Draco sat in the hard wooden chair, feeling just as uncomfortable as he did waiting for the Mind Healer the previous day. He really didn’t want to fail in front of Potter. He couldn’t help but feel a little angry—Potter should
Before the fire was able to swallow him whole, he awoke gasping, his legs tangled in the sheets that were moist with his sweat. He broke free of the bonds and sat on the edge of the bed, willing himself not to throw up. The clock told him it was barely daybreak, but thankfully, early enough to justify getting up. Merlin knows Draco had mounds of homework to do anyway to pass the time.
“You didn’t mess up anything, Draco. It’s his fault that the memory turned that way, not yours,” Blaise chimed in.
“Fine.”
“No it’s not! How can you say that?” Draco shook Potter, wanting him to understand. “It’s in my house and it’s eating her, Potter, it’s—“ Draco turned his head to vomit again.
Draco held up his manacled wrist. “This is part of my probation. I was going to just sit here, too, and not say anything. But I don’t want my family to get in any more trouble than we already are. So, let’s just get this done, if you don’t mind.”
Harry frowned as he stared down the alleyway. “I didn’t think about this next part.”
Evidently, someone released Harry from his curse. He slid over to Draco, who was still helplessly slumped under the post.
“First of all, I’d never hear the end of it if we taught a disarming spell for first years, as important as I believe it is. Second of all, I have full faith in you. We just need to try something else. Think of something you want to happen instead of something that has happened in your life.”
“You at least shouldn’t walk around here alone,” Blaise said decidedly. “Not until things settle down a little. Who was the prick that attacked you anyway, Looney Lovegood?”
“Take our your wand. I want to duel.” She lessened the glow of her wand, and Draco saw that her face was red and drawn.
“Come on,” Potter would continue. “You look like you haven’t eaten in days. I haven’t seen you at the Great Hall, and I’ve only seen you in this bedroom and our classrooms. What’s going on?”
“Are you at all willing to take the deal that the students offered you?”
Draco sighed. The Ravenclaw in front of him flexed his wand arm in warning. “Give me a week,” he said dully. “To get things in order.”
Draco pushed aside a bit of disgust at the thought of Weasley and Granger having sex. “I think it’s high time we stop letting other people tell us what we should be doing.” All of a sudden, a switched flipped in Draco’s mind. This conflict with the Time Turner wasn’t out of hand yet. He could take control.
Draco sat up too, frustrated. “No. No, love, you shouldn’t. I deserved that. Hell, I was going to try and torture you. I nearly killed your best friend and one of your Quidditch players. I berated both of your best friends for years. What would really kill me is knowing that you felt guilty about it. It helped even the score.”
“Yes. She’s going directly to Kingsley, to try and work everything out. Draco, I—I’m touched that you didn’t break up with me. I would have understood, if you had. Well, not at the time, but if I had known—“
“It was...quite sudden. We asked him if we could have some time to think about it, but he pressed us. He said that a day to think about it would be allowed but the sooner the better.”
“I’m good, Kingsley, thank you.” Harry seemed genuinely happy to see Kingsley.
Mr. Burke looked at Draco strangely, probably expecting him to say something about Lucius. “Alright,” he finally said. “Lastly, and this is very important Draco: is there anything that you know about your parents’ circumstances that you should tell me? Something I don’t already know?”
Draco has a heart-to-heart with Goyle, works with Harry on their DADA project, and meets with his lawyer.
“Draco, we...we shouldn’t do this.”
With a sigh, Draco walked up to Professor McGonagall’s office. He had to stop by the restroom twice during the journey to vomit up his nervousness—though he was mostly just dry heaving by the end of his second stop. Unhelpfully, the Auror waiting for him in the Headmistress’s office was Yarney. The young man looked just as unhappy to see Draco as Draco was him. “Come on then, we don’t have all day,” Yarney sighed as he held out his arm to Draco. Draco took it, then felt as though he were being squeezed through a small tube as they apparated to Azkaban.
“Right. Well—er—thanks.” Harry broke Draco’s gaze and fiddled with the armrest of the compartment.
“Goodness, please don’t,” Draco said in a serious but somewhat light tone. “Hey—“ he said, stopping Harry for a moment. “You could have...I mean you didn’t have to tell Smith that...I wouldn’t have been mad if you said we weren’t dating.”
The crowd dispersed, with Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan chatting with Neville Longbottom as they walked to the board games, and the Patil twins leading the charge to the bedrooms. Draco, Blaise, Gregory, and Daphne soon followed tentatively. Draco read the names on the doors as he passed—Neville and Gregory, Daphne and Parvati, Ernest and Blaise, and—no. This couldn’t possibly be right.
“Why?”
As winter break nears, Draco is worried about two things. He also would do anything to give Harry his childhood back.
“Don’t worry, Harry, I’ll try and keep my fans docile,” Draco said wryly, earning a laugh from his date. Harry’s smile lit Draco up inside and out.
Granger furrowed her eyebrows. “That’s not what I heard. He was actually telling me that he felt like a burden to you, that he should probably give you more space.”
The Hospital Wing was empty, and Madame Pomfrey came over to the shuffling Draco right away. “Mr. Malfoy,” she said somewhat coldly. Goodness knows how many patients came here last year because of Draco alone. “Professor McGonagall told me to expect you. Come here,” she said, gesturing to a bed nearest to her office.
“Fine.”
Of course Ron wasn’t going to stand for this. Draco had truly been horrible to his entire family. Sure, he hadn’t much to do with Fred’s death, but he certainly had a lot to do with the eldest Weasley’s mauling by Fenir Grayback. That would have never happened if Draco hadn’t let the Death Eaters into the castle. He sighed as he leaned against a bunch of jump-scare products. This wasn’t going according to plan in the slightest. Draco glanced at the clock—it was only two. They had been out for three hours and already Draco nearly had a panic attack, got thrown out of a pub, got completely pissed, and now they have run into Harry’s best friend who hated Draco’s guts.  Draco felt exhausted and defeated—he was just ready to go back to school.
But the lies Draco was telling himself weren’t working. He started to shake all over. “Look, it doesn’t matter. I just—I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry to everyone. I know I was a prick to Muggleborns, I know I let the Death Eaters into the castle, I know I tortured people, and I know that nothing I say will ever make up for it, but I’m sorry anyway.” He looked at everyone’s stony faces.
“Caden, I don’t think—“

“It’s hard to accept a house that has the heads of dead house elves on the walls.”
“Daphne!” Draco exclaimed, mortified.
Draco moved his head to look out the window. He really wanted to close his eyes and get some rest, but he wouldn’t dare be vulnerable in front of Potter. A few minutes passed in silence, then the Hogwarts Express gave a choo and started moving.
“Yes, I am aware of your predicament. What would you like me to do to help you with it?” She said this not unkindly. When Draco was silent still, she continued. “Would you like me to inform the Minister of this situation? Would you like me to talk to Ms. Weasley myself? What action should I take?”
Draco gave a noncommittal shrug.
“But it didn’t, right? Only Mr. Burke saw you. Only he’s making a big deal about it. It wasn’t in the Prophet, there weren’t any attacks, everything was fine! You did absolutely nothing wrong.” Harry took Draco’s hand. “Trust me. I’m always the first to blame myself when things go wrong, so I completely understand what you’re saying. I would tell you if you screwed up. You didn’t. You just...existed. And that’s not a mistake.”
Ginny didn’t bat an eye. “You tell me,” she said in a cold voice, and nodded to the wall next to them. Draco examined what he could with the faint light. There were plenty of pictures on the top, and on the bottom were mugshots. Some were crossed out with a big “X”, like Dolohov’s. Theodore Sr.’s was one of the dozen or so with no marks. Draco recognized his parents’ clean mugshots, one of which flipped up to reveal a second copy with an “X” on it underneath. And beneath their two photos was his grimacing face that he had been required to take before receiving his manacle and probation. His frown was unmarked save for a small, question mark at the top of the paper in black ink.
“Father, please. I care about you and Mother—I promise I’m going to get you out of here. Both of you. Then you’ll feel better. I’m going to make you proud, I swear to you. Everything is going to be okay.”
Regardless of his location, Draco doubted that he would have been able to eat today. It was September 1st, and his trunk stared at him menacingly from the end of his bed. He put on a suit, washed his face in the adjoining bathroom with cold water himself, and then dragged his trunk down two flights of stairs to the main floor.
“Draco,” Harry said, prompting Draco to look at him. “You know that I don’t care about what people think. People thought I was right batty for a whole year, and it didn’t affect the way I lived my life.”
“Your mother and I wanted to make clear our expectations for you this year. You are to follow all rules related to your probation. You are to get high marks in all of your courses and be polite to your professors. You are to be especially kind to all pureblood students. Their families have been very gracious in letting us back into the inner circle. You will not tarnish the Malfoy name.”
“She does. I wouldn’t care at this point if my Patronus were a blast-ended skrewt, so long as I made one.”
The ten minute boat ride passed in silence. When they got within sight of the shore, Yarney cast his own Patronus—but made a point to keep it close to himself. Draco couldn’t even remember the last few minutes of the ride. The Dementors pulled him into a darker place, and visions of screaming people that he tortured last year stood out among his muddled thoughts.
The two companions caught the train to Hogsmeade, and it was a short ride. Draco was thinking about how far he had come from the boy who had a panic attack on the train going to Hogwarts. Though he somewhat felt on the verge of an anxiety attack right now, he took pleasure in the fact that it was because of butterflies in his stomach rather than sharp daggers of fear.
“Vaguely. But I definitely remember the next morning. Why do you ask?”
“One more thing, Mr. Malfoy.” The Headmistress’s voice all of a sudden got gentler. “I had a conversation with Mr. Potter today. He told me that you were attacked.”
“Yeah, it does. That’s a lot of what my Mind Healer and I have been talking about.” Harry lay back down and glanced at Draco. “How’s that going for you, by the way?”
“I’m sure I could have done something, I—“
Draco wasn’t sure what he expected to see—of course James and Lily Potter’s bodies weren’t here. He wasn’t expecting everything to be so...normal. There were dishes in the sink, turned permanently brown from no one washing them. There was an empty cat food bowl in the corner. Everything was covered with a fine layer of dust, but other than that, it looked like someone could be living here.
That evening, Ron agreed to sleep on the couch downstairs so that Harry and Draco, both technically not members of the family, could have an escape from the noise. As Harry was helping Ron set up camp on the couch, Draco noticed the bond between the two. It seemed that Harry had a special relationship with each and every member of the Weasley family. Previously, Draco would have been jealous of this. Even with his own extended family, there always seemed to be a disconnect. Dinners were always cold, and Draco spent more time worrying about whether or not his posture was acceptable than anything else. The Weasley’s were almost too good to be true. Draco couldn’t help but beam at the way the brothers ruffled Harry’s hair, and at the way Mrs. Weasley fussed over him. He wouldn’t change anything.
Draco wanted to hold his hand, wanted to brush his hair away from his forehead that was red from Harry rubbing it so much. “They would have done whatever was necessary to win the war, I think. Not that they didn’t care about you, of course they did, but I don’t think anyone who died did so for you, if that makes sense.”
“It’s...it’s normal, honestly. Of course there’s dust around and everything is old, but it’s not scary.” Draco didn’t want to pressure Harry, but his tone lightly suggested that Harry should go in.
“Yeah. Erm...” Draco decided to just get it over with. “Do you want to...do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?”
Draco slowly turned his head toward Potter, sitting across from him. Potter looked open and somewhat eager to have a conversation.
“Someone else did this to you? Why didn’t you just heal it?”
“Alright everyone,” Granger got everyone’s attention. “Today we’re going to do something different. I know we’ve been making some progress with the memorial preparation, but Professor McGonagall wants us also to be making progress with each other.”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Draco had forgotten that Harry’s father had been of pure blood and was wealthy.
He found it amusing until he realized that people would likely think he tried to off himself.
“Sure. I’m fine.”
“Of course,” Draco said after a moment. “And...thank you for inviting me here. I know it couldn’t have been easy.”
“I don’t need this. Do your stupid little project without me.” Amidst Harry’s protests, he walked out of the eighth year dorm and welcomed the vastness of the castle. It made him feel as small on the outside as he did within.
Draco wasn’t expecting this. Whenever he complained to his father, the first thing he received was detailed instructions about exactly what he should do. He never had to lead the other person there with him. “I just...I guess I just wanted some advice. I don’t really want the Ministry involved at all, if I can help it.”
Harry stopped in his tracks. “Oh, shite. You didn’t know? Yeah, the dagger killed him.” Draco nodded and was silent for a moment. He wasn’t quite...sad, because it had been years since he spoke to or even really thought about his longtime house-elf. But he also regretted that his previous playmate was brutally murdered in that way. “We buried him,” Harry continued. “Gave him a nice gravestone and everything. I can tell you where it is if you want to go visit him sometime.”
“We will start out with these smaller pairs so that you can find out what works as a lesson plan and what does not. Today, discuss spells or other types of magic that each of you are good at. You must pick different skills and get my approval. Then you are free to go and begin your research together. This room will be open for practicing during your regularly scheduled class period. You must turn in progress reports to me every week. We will start our first demonstrations at the end of October. Any questions?” People were already murmuring excitedly to each other. “Feel free to come talk to me if anything comes up. And, begin!”
Draco decided to retire to bed early that evening, giving Harry some quality time with the people that he loved. Yet he lay awake, not just because of the laughter that resounded below. He was going to meet his Aunt Andromeda for the very first time tomorrow. Not only that, but he would finally be able to put a face to the name of Teddy Tonks, who even the Dark Lord made fun of. Draco shuddered and finally fell in to a fitful sleep.
“Oh! Really? That’s...fantastic! I didn’t know that, er...I didn’t know that was...” Potter searched for the right word. “I mean, do your parents know?”
“I—the Dark Lord cut my tongue out for a week. For something.”
. How in the world was this going to work? He cluthced his stomach, trying not to vomit. He could still smell smoke and charring flesh, he could hear Vincent screaming—
“I am,” Lucius responded, almost defensively. “But I’m more interesting in how you are doing. Have you enjoyed your extra year at Hogwarts?”
Draco felt guilty that the thought even entered Greg’s mind that Draco may be upset with him. Of course he wasn’t mad that Greg and Vincent had a relationship. If anything, it filled him with intense joy that his friend got to experience that kind of happiness, and then just as intense a sadness that Vincent’s death took that happiness away.
Draco didn’t say anything for a moment. “Well, I brought it up to Granger. Then we worked together on it.” When Harry looked at him pressingly, he continued. “I hated the thought of you never having an authentic snowball fight. And I know you don’t want me to worry about it, but—Merlin, Harry, you never even had a childhood. I wanted to give you a piece of that back.”
It was sort of a jumble of random well-wishes, but Draco knew there were logistical limitations to the magical object. He smiled, and couldn’t find the words to respond. Even making the notebook glow with thanks wouldn’t match the brightness in his heart.
“Well I can’t do magic now, can I?” Draco mumbled as he was finally able to drop the trunk. As part of his probation, he was required to wear a magic bracelet that blocked him from using magic until he graduated from Hogwarts. He was very irritated that he was not able to practice with his new wand for the entire summer. Not only would he return to school as a criminal, but also terrible at magic from disuse.
Once he was gone, Draco was left standing outside his new bedroom. He put his hand on the doorknob, trying to work up the courage to go in. He had been under the assumption that he would be rooming with the other eighth-year Slytherins. That wasn’t such a big deal—they already heard him cry in his sleep for the past two years, and they were either kind or embarrassed enough not to say anything to him about it. But Potter—first he saw Draco’s...fit on the train, now this? Draco couldn’t even use a Silencing charm with the damned manacle on his wrist.
Harry read over Draco’s shoulder, then looked at him with eyes full of loving concern. “Do you think he knows about us?”
“You can, if you’d like.”
“Harry, just let me go—“ he whispered.
Sure enough, a few minutes later the door opened and Bill Weasley ducked to enter the kitchen. Draco tried to focus on his wild hair rather than the scars that ran across his face. Fleur Delacour entered shortly after, wearing a loose sweater. There were grins and hugs, and even some tears on the part of Molly Weasley. Draco felt a lump in his throat and looked down, embarrassed. The air was heavy with love, and Draco wasn’t used to the chaos or the warmth. Harry kicked him under the table. “You’ll get used to it,” he said quietly and with a soft smile.
In fact, Draco could not get the thought out of his mind. When Harry went to bed that night, Draco feigned wanting to study more. Instead, he approached Granger, who was dutifully working on an assignment, her hair wrapped in a messy bun with her wand sticking straight through it.
“Blaise, it’s okay,” Draco put his hand on Blaise’s arm, not roughly as he used to do when Vincent and Gregory weren’t doing what he wanted, but enough to tell the Slytherin to back off. Blaise stepped aside, and Draco was face to face with Luna. He noticed that she looked a lot better than she did in his home. Her face had some color to it and was more full. Her eyes were always vibrant, even in captivity, but she looked more happy than he remembered. He wasn’t quite sure what to say. “Thanks, Lovegood.”
“Thank goodness for Harry Potter, looking out for us even now by keeping Malfoy in line. I hear his parents are going to be thrown into Azkaban tomorrow, maybe he’ll be next?” A fifth year that Draco only vaguely recognized moved past them, making sure her voice was loud enough for both of them to hear.
Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy’s retrial had been rescheduled to November 6th, so Draco had about a week to try and figure out how he could best help. Mr. Burke had assured him that he would be allowed to attend and would likely be called as a witness. Draco was glad that if Lucius had been involved with the elder Nott’s efforts to resurrect the Dark Lord, he had never shared any of his plans with Draco. Draco could confidently walk into the retrial knowing that knew absolutely nothing.
Harry noticed Draco staring wistfully at the kids. “Did you have snowball fights as a kid?”
Draco startled—he didn’t know that Harry was awake. “Just...” he was debating how much he should tell Harry. He always thought he was probably so bothersome to Harry, having anxiety attacks all over the place, getting poisoned, having nightmares. Of course Harry ended up needing him too, but not as often, and not as intensely. Draco didn’t want to become dependent on Harry, didn’t want to become a burden. But, it was nighttime, and they always allowed the darkness to push them into more honesty. “I don’t know whether or not I should visit my father in Azkaban.”
Arthur frowned. “You drove?”
Draco took Harry’s hand. “Now that, I understand completely. But we’re going to get through this together. Hopefully now that my mother is out of Azkaban, things will calm down a little. Maybe I won’t even have to wear a disguise to go out on dates.”
Draco cleared his throat and turned around, trying to give Harry space to recover and also thinking about his next move. He tried to keep his voice even when he spoke, though it quavered with emotion. “That was pretty good—I mean, I could tell you were trying to alter it. I think we should try a different memory next time, though, something that may be easier for you to change.”
At the door at the very end, in the larger suite, read the names Harry and Draco.
was that he was referring to, but he knew that he would face any obstacle standing in his way of being with Harry.
“Hey...” Draco took Harry’s hand that was turning his forehead red. Harry looked at him with surprise, as though he hadn’t realized what he was doing. “You’re going to wipe off your scar if you keep rubbing at it like that. You always seem to do that when you’re stressed.” Draco traced small circles on Harry’s palm.
“Oi, you say you don’t want him to participate in the group and he just said he wouldn’t. What the hell do you want from him? It’s not his fault he can’t fix your loony sister.” Draco glared at Blaise as he said this last part. All gratitude Draco was starting to build for Blaise sticking up for him vanished when the inevitable happened.
After a few moments, the Boy Who Lived spoke up. “You know, you have to keep going to appointments in order to ask her...”
Draco had been rehearsing this in his head all day. If Harry didn’t seem interested in the idea of going to Hogsmeade with Draco, the latter would just say they could go as friends with a group. Draco shifted uncomfortably in the bed, the weight of what he wanted to say preventing him from settling.
“Nothing is going to happen to me, Harry. But I’ll tell you what is going to happen to you,” Draco took off his shirt. “You’re going to have a great year here at school with everyone worshipping you, and you’re going to have fun spending time with your friends, then you’ll graduate and get whatever job you want immediately, but you’ll probably end up as a professor at this school because you can’t bear to leave this hellhole, and you’ll live happily ever after.” Though there were some quips in the picture of Harry’s future that Draco painted, he didn’t mean any of them in a bad way. “But not if you mess it up. So just relax for once in your life, alright?”
Potions was being taught by Slughorn again, Transfiguration by McGonagall, Care of Magical Creatures (which he was not taking) by Hagrid, Charms by Flitwick...one of the only differences was in Defense Against the Dark Arts, which was now being taught by someone named Professor Arden. He recognized his name in the back of his head from his trials at the Wizengamot. The name evoked an anxious reaction in his soul, but he vaguely remembered her questioning to not be as brutal as the others. It wasn’t listed on his schedule, but Draco also couldn’t help but thing of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies Professor that he watched—
“Though he did stay in our house, my husband was punished severely for his past renouncing of Death Eater ways. My son was also punished greatly.” Draco tensed. He didn’t want Narcissa to relieve any of his punishments in front of the Wizengamot.
Harry glanced at Draco strangely and sighed. “Come on.” Harry helped support Draco’s weight as he got to his feet.
The rest of the meal passed in silence. Draco focused on closing his mind and feeling nothing, channeling his intense focus from his Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape and his aunt. When a knock sounded at the door, no Malfoy moved to answer it, but Draco put down his half-eaten toast and looked toward the doorway. A wave of nausea and anxiety rushed over him.
His suite hadn’t changed much over the years. He started out with a small crib in the corner of his room next to the window, and then immediately moved to a giant king-sized bed with green satin covers. The crib was moved out and replaced with a couch and chair set complete with a bookshelf in between. He had a window seat to overlook the gardens, and often curled up there with a good book in the summer. In sixth year he ordered Tilly to put curtains around his bed so that he could have some privacy, and some warning should someone enter. While the Dark Lord was living in his home, he would often use his dresser as a barricade. Thankfully the Dark Lord never tried to enter his room, but his Aunt Bellatrix did multiple times and often called him a coward for blocking the entrance. He just wanted to feel safe somewhere, and his room was his only option to do so.
The man turned around to look at him. “Well then? This is your home, innit?”
“I honestly have no idea how my father would react, especially with the way he is now. My mother I’m sure wouldn’t do anything too awful, but I do think she’d try and talk me out of it. Who were you planning on telling?”
“No, we didn’t mean to upset you,” Daphne put a hand on his arm before he could get up. “In all seriousness, I think you should just pretend like nothing happened. I’m sure it’s not as big of a deal as you think it is.”
“You probably will regardless of what I say,” Draco mumbled with his teeth clenched and eyes still closed.
“But I can’t follow your full instructions even though they’re fantastic. I told you, we should have done a different spell. Or you should have insisted on having a less—less
“Blaise is right. I think you should tell Mr. Burke right away, or even an Auror. Turn this letter in without opening it. It’ll make you look good,” Daphne added.
After a day spent chatting with his mother about simple things, Draco adjourned to his room for the night. He had to take the train early the next morning, and he wanted time to reflect on his short visit at home. He also needed to prepare for the backlash that was surely taking place at Hogwarts. But first, he had to tell Harry the terrifying news.
There was somewhat of a pained expression on Narcissa’s face. “That’s nice, dear. He’s a good ally to have. Speaking of your future—“ Draco didn’t realize that they had been speaking of the future. “—there’s a reason I keep bringing up Pansy. Their parents would like to come over during the holidays, along with herself.”
Everyone looked at each other. They hadn’t planned to actually discuss any joint project with the Minister, it was simply just their way of getting in. No one spoke, until Hermione finally sat up, a calm look on her face. “Yes, we just wanted to talk to you about our success at collaboration...”
Draco’s eyes filled with tears. “I don’t care much about protecting my father. But if what I did in any way caused my mother harm...I could never forgive myself.”
One step.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is that what you did this summer?” Draco made eye contact and glared at Christine—he wondered if she was using Occlumency, and make sure to actively close his mind. Her expression didn’t change.
Ginny was silent for a moment before speaking again. “I don’t care about you in the slightest, Malfoy, not even enough to torture you like you tortured me. But I care about Harry a whole awful lot. Regardless of our history, he’s like a part of our family. So if you’re just being cheeky, you better stop and consider who all you’re messing around with. It’s not just Harry. You’ll have a whole army after you, literally, if you hurt him.”
“A—a what?”
“I don’t know, I just don’t want to mess anything up with the trial coming up. I also want this date to go perfectly.”
“It’s okay,” Draco said. He had never done anything more than a clumsy, experimental kiss with Pansy, but he wanted to reassure Harry so badly. “Nothing complicated. Just relax.” He slowly pushed Harry back on the bed—Draco’s, it turns out—and began to slip off Harry’s sweatpants instead. He ran his fingers along Harry’s thighs and stroked his member delicately, feeling it harden beneath his skin. Harry gasped with pleasure above him, and Draco closed his eyes as he inwardly apologized for every undeserved insult that this near perfect human being had received, whether they were his own or not. He took each movement slowly and made sure that Harry was truly enjoying himself. Draco resolved that he would not be a point of stress for the Chosen One. He would be the safe space for this man who used to be a boy in a cupboard under some stairs, for this man who didn’t have a proper home. Draco would be his home.
“Potter, you have a severe problem of sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong. Just go away.”
“Don’t worry about breakfast, mother.” Draco quickly shifted the jacket so that he was sitting on it. His mother would know that it wasn’t his. Thankfully he managed to conceal it by the time she fully came into the room, looking like she hadn’t slept at all last night. He felt a pang of guilt that he didn’t stay up with her, make her some tea, or do something to try and comfort her. He had been so busy thinking about how he felt about seeing Lucius that he forgot what a big deal this would be for her. “We can—“ he was about to suggest they go out to brunch after seeing Lucius.
“I’ll tell you later; it’s kind of an interesting story,” Harry said, smirking. Draco wondered exactly how much he would have to unravel and deduce about Harry before he knew every inch of the man sitting next to him. And my god, he wanted to know every inch so badly. “Do you want to talk about what happened? I mean, I think I can sort of guess...”
“We got rid of a lot of them in fifth year. Most of them seemed...off.”
Harry tensed next to him. “That’s bloody ridiculous.”
“Oh, Draco. I love you so much. You don’t even know. I love you. And please, be kind to your father.”
“If it helps, it only bothers Harry a little. He just doesn’t like hypocrisy.”
Draco looked at Greg in time to see a tear roll down his cheek, and then quickly looked away. “Draco, there’s something you don’t know.”
Harry took a pause before entering the village, as though preparing himself for the emotions that would lie ahead. Draco followed him into a cemetery after Harry removed the Invisibility Cloak. They came to a stop at James and Lily Potter’s headstones. Harry stood there in silence for a few moments, and Draco was unsure of what he should do.
Harry patted Draco on the back and stood up. Draco was surprised by how much he felt the absence of Harry’s hand on his back. “Well, might as well do some homework now that I’m up. Care to join me?”
“No, listen. You’re a prick, and none of the deaths that happened on that night are your fault. Besides You-Know-Who’s death, that was your fault. But that was a good thing. The rest? Not even close. I would tell you otherwise since I don’t care about tiptoeing around your feelings like you’re fragile.”
“Shortly after my father was imprisoned two years ago, I was told that I should take the Dark Mark to protect my family. I’m not going to lie, part of me was proud and looked forward to it. But the first meeting was—“ he choked here a little, and coughed to recover. “—terrifying. It hurt nearly more than anything I’ve ever felt. Sort of like the Cruciatus, but concentrated, so I was aware of everything I was feeling.” He didn’t dare look up to see how everyone was reacting.
He walked back slowly into their bedroom. Harry was still asleep on the couch, mumbling a little, but not appearing to be in the grips of a nightmare. Draco sighed and took his duvet from his bed, covering Harry with it. He was careful not to wake Harry, and the man turned over and let out a small noise of appeasement. Draco left their bedroom, heart still racing, wanting someone to talk to. He went out to the common area, but it was empty. He almost wished that Granger was awake, stirring her tea, waiting to draw something out of him like poison. But no one was there to startle him like she would. He doubled back and raised a hand to knock quietly on Blaise’s door, then put it down. Mind Healer Christine had always encouraged him to reach out if he felt like he needed to talk to someone. But that felt like asking a lot of him at the moment. Finally, Draco decided to take a walk outside, even though he could get caught and reprimanded.
Greg shook his head. “We’re not giving up on you, mate. And we’re not going to let you give up on us, either.” Daphne murmured agreement.
Harry strolled into the Three Broomsticks with Draco following close behind him—it was too bad that he towered over the young wizard. Sure enough, Madame Rosmerta caught his eye and morphed her face into an immediate glare. She stamped over to the two, with Potter looking disturbed.
Draco felt somewhat of a sick pleasure at Finch-Fletchley yelling at him.
This surprisingly brought a smile to Harry’s face. “Did he tell you anything else?”
Draco plays Quidditch, and finds out how Potter felt when he fainted during the game in their 3rd year...
Draco swallowed uncomfortably.
“I remember reading that one of the students that passed was in your year. Vincent Crabbe, right? Were you two close?”
Most of the letters were thankfully nonsense, and all the four Slytherins thumbed through them once Blaise had returned after destroying the Howlers in the bathroom. Draco opened the second to last letter and a disgusting black liquid immediately oozed onto his hands. “Ugh!” he cried, and Blaise immediately vanished the liquid for him.
“Merlin. You’re such an idiot. Get up, Malfoy.”
“You can’t control what people say, Harry. It’s completely not your fault.” Harry still looked dejected, so Draco lightly touched his hand. “I too am glad that you’ll always be around to keep me in line.” Harry smiled back, squeezing Draco’s finger, and the world felt right again.
Wordlessly, Dolohov put Harry in a Full Body Bind curse. Harry, mouth open, fell to the ground like a stiff board, unable to move or speak. Dolohov took a few steps toward Draco. Draco knew he was doomed.
“That’s not too uncommon. Some house elves would see that as a honor, depending on how the death happened.”
Draco already had a headache by the time he got to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. He was sure it had something to do with the fact that he could feel waves of disgust flowing off of his Ministry driver, who did not say one word to him during the whole car ride. The platform was more crowded than last year, but there were still less eager and confused first years than when he started his Hogwarts journey seven years prior.
Dean at least had the sense to look sheepish. “We’ve been searching your mail. This was included.”
“How many days? I guess tomorrow will be the fifth.” Harry sighed and settled on the bed next to Draco, who revered in his closeness. “You’re an unlucky bloke, Draco. I guess you had a paper cut or something? So the poison got into your bloodstream. You’d be better by now if it were just on the surface of your skin, though that would have made you sick too. Magic spells aren’t working on your body as well, that’s why it’s taking you so long to heal. Madame Pomfrey has even had to use Muggle methods.” Draco suppressed a shudder—he was not prejudiced anymore. Muggle methods were fine. “And that’s why it’s really important that you rest. I can’t believe you walked up seven flights of stairs to come see me.” Harry shook his head, but Draco could see he was suppressing a smile.
Harry paused and looked at Draco. “A panic attack. It’s the Muggle term for—well, for what just happened.”
After a few minutes, Harry spoke. “How are you feeling?”
Draco crossed the room quickly, dropped his trunk, and grabbed Harry’s face in his. With a hand gently on Harry’s neck, he tilted his boyfriend’s head so that their lips were able to match despite the height difference. He heard Harry give a yelp of surprise before the Boy Who Lived settled into the kiss, his posture melting. Draco steadied him by lowering him to a bed—whether it was Draco’s or Harry’s didn’t matter in the slightest in that moment.
“Well, it hasn’t been that awful because we’ve just been playing chess and talking about random things. If I keep going, we’re eventually going to have to talk about unpleasant things. Which will be unpleasant.”
“Fantastic, thank you,” Harry said, and the crew began to walk out of the gate. The burly man followed them, and Harry turned around quickly. “May I help you?”
Thank you all so much for your comments of support! It’s really pushing me to keep writing this story. Let me know if you have any suggestions or things you want to have happen as the plot takes shape!
“Oh,” Harry said sheepishly. “Yeah, we actually stayed at his house for a bit in the summer before fifth year. I own it now, since he died.”
“If there’s a cure, why can’t we just take it and be done with it?” Parvati spoke up from where she was sitting beside her twin sister.
Suddenly Draco was turned over, and with a flick of Harry’s wand, able to move again. “Ugh,” he spluttered. “It’s getting all over my shirt.” It was true. His normally pristinely white undershirt was now stained a dark brown.
Draco’s heart clenched at those words.
“No, I’m not trying to hurt my family, I would never do that—“
would have a field day, Draco would be accused of dating the Boy Who Lived for the wrong reasons, Draco’s father would be enraged, his family reputation would either be much improved or get much worse—but none of that mattered right now. All Draco wanted to do was crawl in bed beside his crush.
Draco lay back on Greg’s bed and listened as his friends talked about both incredibly large problems and meaningless things. Their voices lulled him to sleep, as his body wrestled with both an intense fear for his and his parents’ future, and an intense love for the people he still had in his life.
finally appeared.
Narcissa stared violently into his eyes, leaning forward and only stopping because of the chains. “Over Draco’s Easter break, Draco had his tongue cut out for a week.” Tears were now freely falling down Narcissa’s face, and she looked as though she somewhat regretting this admission. Draco had begged Mr. Burke not to discuss that event in his original trial, and Mr. Burke said he only would as a last resort. That time never came, yet here his mother was, discussing his worst and most humiliating nightmare with everyone. Even the worst of the Wizengamot members looked uncomfortable. “The Malfoy family, as said in our last trial, does not wish for the Dark Lord to return,” Narcissa finished coldly.
“WAIT!” Draco said. He couldn’t be trapped here, it reminded him too much of being shut away in his own home for the past two years. “I want to speak with my family lawyer.”
“I’m not you, you prat.” That hurt a little, that she wasn’t going to take revenge simply because it seemed like something Draco would do, and she wanted to set them apart. “Now come on, I’m taking you back to the castle.”

Draco turned to his mother. Narcissa embraced him, and he sighed, releasing something deep inside of him. Tears threatened to escape, but Draco had become good at refusing to let them fall. As Narcissa pulled away, Draco cupped her face in his hands. “I’ll be okay, Mother. I promise you.” His voice threatened to crack, and he felt a deep ache in his chest.
Fine, he would play along. Draco imagined Harry and himself in some sort of gardens. The sun was shining, and they were hand in hand. More importantly, they were in public, with other couples milling about the park. No one was grabbing Harry and pulling him away from Draco. No one even noticed them. They were alone in the world in the best possible way. They came to a bench, and in his vision Draco sat down with Harry, pulling him close. He brushed aside Harry’s bangs to look at his scar, and kissed it tenderly. Then his lips moved down to Harry’s mouth, their noses brushing up against each other. Finally, Draco touched his lips to Harry’s, slowly parting them as they both moved closer to each other—
“Draco, if I show up without you, they really will declare that you’re missing or worse and have the whole place on lockdown within seconds. If we can get to Kingsley and make some excuse, we can come back down here and see the second half.”
“I’m afraid not. Hale doesn’t want you and Lucius speaking to each other until after the proceedings.”
, he was able to determine a few things. Theodore Nott Sr. was not in captivity, and neither was his son. The Time Turner was in fact missing—
Now Harry was the one staring wistfully outside. Draco’s heart clenched every time Harry mentioned the horrible Dursley’s. It was almost too painful to hear about, but Draco knew his pain must be nothing in comparison to how Harry felt talking about it. Draco had learned to be quiet when Harry brought up memories from hips childhood. At first, Draco blamed anyone he could—Dumbledore, the Weasleys, anyone that had knowledge of how Harry was being treated and chose to do nothing about it. Then Draco realized that his anger wasn’t helping Harry. Harry needed a safe person who would listen without judgement. But Draco would give anything if Harry could have some of his childhood back.
“Not a little thing. Big thing.”
A few hours later he found himself early to Professor McGonagall’s office, waiting for Mr. Burke. She had offered him a biscuit as usual, but he declined politely. His hands twitched involuntarily on his knees as he struggled to avoid looking at the portraits of Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape.
“Because you will feel so much better down the road! Look at me,” Harry said kindly. Draco met his eyes in the darkness. “You’ve been through a lot. You deserve to get better.”
“Alright everyone,” Potter got their attention. “Thanks for coming out tonight. I just figured this would be a fun way to blow off some steam and end the week. I know many of you haven’t been on a Quidditch team before, and that’s okay. We’re just going to have fun.”
“Can’t you do that any more gracefully?” His father drawled from the dining room table, face covered by The Daily Prophet.
