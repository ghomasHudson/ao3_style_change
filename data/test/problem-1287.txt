Thank you to bk7brokemybrain, treacle_tartlet, tari_sue and my wonderful hubby for helping me create the twists and turns of this mystery. Please enjoy!
But once Ollivander confirmed what my family had feared for years when I failed to manifest any signs of magic, my father became the type of man who loves his Squib son.
Mr. Potter is also in the picture, although he looks really different. He's standing beside my father, his hand on his shoulder. He's less bulky, scrawny actually, and he's blinking ridiculously underneath the flash of the cameras. His glasses are more like the nerd-specs I had imagined, but Harry still wears them like a weapon, and less like a tool to help him see.
A few hours of sleep and they woke to made love again, this time Harry entering Draco, trying to do everything that Draco had done. Draco just looked up at Harry, his face full of love and trust. Again, Harry was sure this was Heaven. Snape must have poisoned him. He bent down and kissed Draco's throat, caressing away any memories of bark or wood. This throat was meant for kissing, this body for Harry, Draco's heart made to beat.
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry with all he was worth. Their wet lips glided together, their tongues melded, sending sparks around their bodies. Draco put everything he had into the kiss, and then some. Draco reluctantly pulled away, but the train was almost at a full stop.
“Harry, it's just the magic drumming through you. If you could escape from the Imperius curse, I'm sure you could escape from this. Once you turn me into a wand I'm sure you'll look back on your little puppy dog act as one of the more idiotic things you have done in your life. But since you insist on carrying out this nonsense, I have a proposal for you.”
A scruffy man wearing only a pair of old boxer pants and a bathrobe scratched his belly, his pooch jingling in his wake. “Yeah, that's me. Can you I help you?”
“Oh god, Harry, I didn’t know, Oh, Harry, gods, Harry, just like that. God, I love when you’re inside me, yes, yes, YES!”
Narcissa did look up, but she still maintained her casual appearance. It had never enraged Draco more than it did now.
"His name is Harry Potter and he’s a four-eyed git." My father replies, and laughs even more. I don’t get the joke, but if the guy can make my father laugh this hard, I guess I can stand to have him stay for a while.
"I know you’re your awake, Hayden. If you were asleep there'd be strange roar-like snores coming from your bedroom."
Harry brushed down his badge in annoyance while the boys laughed harder. He could feel his blood begin to boil, but he knew these boys just liked to push. The best way get them to stop was the change the subject.
Once fully lathered, Harry lifted his hips in supplication of surrender, the touching on his cock not enough.
More than likely, the ship had originally come from the island, so Harry planned to keep an eye on it, but held off his concern until it posed an actual threat. At the moment, it was too far away to tell in what direction it was heading.
"Yeah, yeah," I mutter, adjusting the weight of the box to rest on my right arm rather than my left.
Harry jumped, realizing the voice was much too close and feeling the sudden gush of cold air that could only be caused by a sudden opening of the shower curtain. Harry wiped his eyes with one hand and covered his bits with the other, only to see Draco, still naked, smirking at him, the shower curtain now pulled back.
Harry shook his head. 'I refuse to be gentle with you precisely because you nearly died, you completely daft bugger.'
“You just defeated the Dark Lord. Everyone agreed that was impossible, so do something.  You're bound to destroy it somehow.”
“Last time Dumbledore was at the station, but he wasn’t there this time. I got on the train too. I didn’t know what else to do.”
“Well yeah, but I agree with her, mate, it doesn’t seem like his kind of thing. Thought he’d be a Ministry employee and yell at people all day, or possibly just a lazy rich sot who looked down his nose at everyone.”
Draco slammed a hand down on the bed. “Magic will find other ways of punishing you! This was pleasurable, yes, but they will find ways of hurting you next. I don't want to see that. Please, there is no way to avoid this. If I could figure out a way, I would spare you. I promise you I would.”
Harry shook his head, hoping the early hour and his strange landing into someone’s lawn was causing the misunderstandings. “Muggle? Is that a word?”
After the war, Harry had a bit of a crush on Neville, who was not gay. He was very sweet and kind. Harry had helped him start his greenhouse and they had spent a fair amount of time alone, together.
Ron nodded and began eating his cupcake again. Hermione only nodded her head slightly, but Harry knew that look. She wasn’t promising anything and most likely was just waiting for Ron not to be within earshot to tell Harry what she thought.
Harry displayed his badge and attempted to show a friendly face. “Good evening, is this the Dursley residence?”
“Well, see, I’m sure you can tell, but I don’t really have any experience in regards to being with other men, but there was this one time, and I just can’t help thinking about it all the time.”
If the captain's wheel was solid, Harry thought it was safe to assume that perhaps the rest of the ship was also the same. He took a tiny step forward, and then another, before he felt secure that the
There was another thud on the door. 'I loved you for a long time, Harry. I knew you didn't feel the same, but I thought it was okay as long as I could be your First Mate. It hurt me when you shut down the
Before anyone could even ask a question, Padma and Harry were on their knees digging into the wet earth. Padma Transfigured one of her arrows into a shovel, but Harry had little time to think about magic and used his hands to push the dirt away from where Padma was digging.
Harry lifted his hands in surrender. “I know I'm horrible, but something inside me wanted to know! So I asked Kreacher to find you and tell me if he found anything. He came back and told me that it went down your back.”
After Lucius finished speaking, he fell back into the bed. The message he had given Draco had drained him of all his energy. Draco stood away from the bed, watching his mother resume her fussing, brushing out the creases in the quilts and placing small kisses on Lucius’s forehead.
Cindy took a quill from Neville's desk and started taking notes. She also threw a few spells at the paper, seemingly disappointed with the results.
The first kiss felt like barely anything, just a brush of two lips together, gone before Harry had a chance to process what was happening.
But there was something Harry could do. He could work all night fixing his mistake. This time, he would perform the exact order of the spells. He was determined to do it right. It was empty, then seal. Draco was right, Harry had never paid attention to the meaning of the spells, but he would now. This was important, important for Teddy and Draco.
Harry really liked Draco’s feet. They were smooth and bumpy at the same time. He felt the knobs with his toes.
And the tree that he would have to harvest, the wood that he would have to take, killing the tree in the process; that tree would be Draco. Draco was going to turn into a tree and Harry was expected to kill him.
is under Ministry control. If you would like to file for a complaint of ownership, I am afraid I cannot help you there. My secretary can help you find your way to the Department of Magical Law. If you are in need of a permit to use the
Harry led Cindy to the front doors and began to walk to Neville's office. If he hadn't taken her there first Cindy would have yelled.
I run down the stairs, shaking the pictures on wall and the seashell lined ribbon wrapped around the banister. My heart is beating out of my chest and I'm having trouble breathing. I stop when I reach the kitchen and take a moment to catch my breath. My father takes one look at me and shakes his head.
Draco grew serious, his smile fading into a small frown. “For a fleeting, and rather foolish moment, I thought you were there to rescue us. But we Malfoys, we don’t need rescuing, right? We just invited Voldemort into our home to threaten and torture us, right? But that’s why I didn’t say anything. I thought you had a plan and somehow I could help you. Silly thought, really.”
My father isn't even looking at me. I'm tempted to blurt out what I saw, but I keep my mouth shut. The document said "if" my father does any magic, and I know my father won't. I just have to keep an eye on Harry and make sure he doesn't do something fishy like framing my father.
Draco was at the bottom of the entrance, looking very nice in the same jumper and jeans as he’d worn to the party, but for some reason at night it didn’t look ridiculous. The sweater was tight and a little long over Draco’s hands, making Draco look soft and vulnerable.
Ron stepped through the flames. Harry was always amazed that Ron didn’t hit his head. The man was six foot five. He secretly believed Ron somehow siphoned height from him. How else to explain that Harry was only five foot seven?
The word sounded familiar. An image of a man with red hair crossing his eyes in concentration before disappearing flashed through Harry's mind.
“I know I messed up. You told me how to spell the twigs and I didn’t listen or pay attention to what I was doing. You are right. I rely too much on what people tell me and I never think about what the spells mean. I purchased a Latin book. Its quite fascinating to see the true meaning of some of the most common spells.”
Draco then began to unzip his fly, still maintaining eye contact. His jeans fell down to his ankles and suddenly there was one less barrier between Draco’s hand and Harry’s penis. He was in heaven.
Draco’s proximity was doing something strange to Harry, especially when Draco furrowed his eyebrows.
Draco faced Harry, his eyes boring into him as he slowly removed the blanket from his legs. Harry could see no change in Draco. His trousers were loose and gray, well fitting. Harry continued to look down, trying to comprehend why Draco would want him to see his legs. It wasn't until Harry reached Draco's feet that the real reason why his legs were covered became apparent. Draco was without shoes or socks, but they were unnecessary. Draco's feet were unrecognizable. They were encased in bark, tiny, root-like growths sticking out every which-way. They looked heavy, and ill shaped.
Flashes of men with red robes raiding our home unannounced fly through my mind. The Aurors came often when I was little. I was always so frightened as they yelled at my father, threatened to take him away, and broke everything.
The King dropped Luna's cage, switched his wand to the other hand and threw an unknown spell at Padma, blasting her into the wall behind her. He then swished his wand in a large upswing and suddenly all of the birdcages opened, releasing hundreds of birds into the hall.
Ollivander lifted his glasses to peer at the hands. “Oh, those are my helper hands. They collect the fallen branches and sort them before taking them to my shop. Not every branch that falls can be turned into a wand. It has to be the right kind of wood.”
Padma's words were like a slap in the face. This was not a time to get hysterical about the past. Luna was trapped inside and he needed to get her out.
"I would love a shower, but seriously, if you want me to go again you're going to have to keep the hands off The Big Guy."
Draco stared at the strap for a moment and then flicked the bell slightly, the bell ringing quietly. He did this a few times, the sound waking Harry's soft and spent cock just slightly. “You really do like this sound?” Harry nodded, squeezing Draco's arse and shifting him so he could feel that his cock was half hard. Draco smirked.
Harry took that time to stare at Finn, a plan forming in his mind. He hoped Finn understood what Harry wanted him to do, but at this point he had to do something.
Still not quite understanding the images floating through his mind, Harry took a step back. The man reached out.
He was acting like an idiot. He knew that. But he had to speak to Malfoy, something beyond just polite pleasantries. There was no rhyme or reason to it, just like there was no real reason for Harry to be sitting on the sofa waiting for Malfoy’s appearance. It was probably because Harry was bored; his only accomplishment for the week being the discovery of the stale cereal box and replacing it. But something deep in his stomach was making him feel like he couldn’t allow Malfoy to leave the bookshop without a proper conversation.
I'm dropped to the ground. My arm is still over my eyes, so I can't see anything. I can hear voices, but underneath the spell they seem hazy, their timbre obscured.
There is a silence. Every muscle in my body loosens as relief floods through my body. So he's not here to arrest my father. I thank every god and goddess I can think of that I know, and some made-up ones, and promise them all my left kidney if they ever need it.
My father laughs. "So Twelfth Night this year will be extra special. We’ll celebrate both the end of Christmas and the end of my probation. Sound good?"
In our cottage there are three bedrooms upstairs, the largest room for my father and his big dressers that smell like cedar, the second-biggest for me, which I decorated myself with posters of all the best cyclists, including Eddie Merckx, and a guest room that is used mostly for storage.
“Oh yes, he loves it, but he’s a little scared to spend the nights there. It’s just as well considering Harry has practically moved in there.”
Draco’s skin was scorching hot. It was like touching hot coals. Harry curled his fingers and raked his fingernails down Draco’s back.
Draco snapped his book shut. “Now that I have filled your brain with information that you will no doubt just chuck out again to make way for whatever boy heroes think of, you asked me about the Elder wand pieces. I assure you they are safe. I spent the rest of the night snapping the wand into several more pieces. I then apparated to various bodies of waters and dropped the individual pieces in each. Let the current deal with them now. One bit should be near Iceland and another on its way to the Americas. Only you and I know what I did with it, and it will remain that way if you know what is good for you. If I didn’t trust in your unending Gryffindor goodness, I would force you to make an Unbreakable Vow, but that would involve a third party and there is no one that I trust enough with this matter.”
Harry continued to think about it as he ate his morning cereal, as he weeded the garden, as he walked through the park, as he played a quick pick-up game of Quidditch with Ron and his brothers, as he turned down Kingsley again for Auror Training, as he attempted to convince himself to sleep and as he attempted to convince himself to wake up.  This was becoming an obsession, much like sixth year. Except Harry wasn’t sure if Draco was up to something; rather Harry found himself growing concerned. Malfoy seemed embarrassed by the mark. The scarf had not been an artful fashion choice but rather a tool to cover it up. Was it medical? A spell? A potion gone wrong?
He leaves my father and I alone in the hallway. Without thinking, I start toeing my socks. My father pointedly stares at me until I reach down and yank the socks off my feet.
Harry pulled back onto the desk as Draco straddled his legs. Harry pulled Draco back down to his lips by his neck. Already shirtless, Draco attempted to unbuckle Harry's belt only to be suddenly naked himself.
Draco licked up to Harry's ear, biting on the lobe and licking around the edge. “I keyed you into my wards at my flat.”
Draco smoothed a stray hair out of Harry's face. “They told me they had moved you to a remote hospital that specialized in cases like yours. I didn't realize part of your therapy was living in London. Had I known you were in the same town I would have done anything to see you.”
It was early. The sun was barely peeking out from the horizon. Snape was an early riser too, and was inside making the morning tea.
He wanted more. He plunged his hand down Draco’s pants. That seemed to shock Draco awake, opening his eyes after he had closed them at the beginning of Harry’s caress.
“Forget it,” I say, pitying my father's struggle to think of the right words. “That doesn't matter. I'd rather know when Mr. Potter plans on releasing your probation.”
Pansy didn't respond. Instead she sent an unrelenting barrage of light-coloured spells toward both Harry and Draco.
'Let me introduce you to my crew. First, we have Sir Dylan Culhwich, a fine wizard well versed in magical history. He will be our navigator, as he is familiar with most of what is said on the map.'
He's not exactly a "four-eyed git" like my father said. He does wear glasses, but the frames are thick, sleek and black, and Mr. Potter wears them like a war mask. When my father had first mentioned the phrase I imagined Mr. Potter to be some stuck-up nerd with taped up specs and a pocket protector to shield his shirt from leaking pens, but this man doesn't seem the type to care much about a stray stains or the ability to make a quick mathematical calculation.
It didn't matter that Harry had never done any of this before, or that his technique left much to be desired, but he had fantasized and wished and dreamt about this for so long that all the mistakes were overridden by the overwhelming feeling of completeness.
It was then that Harry noticed that Malfoy had just asked him a question. “Um, I’m sorry. Could you repeat that?”
Harry laughed. “I don’t think so. This is my compartment. I think this time it may be the other way around.”
Teddy looked over and gave Draco a big hug. He then stepped back and said in a very practiced way, “Thank you, Draco, for the easel. I don’t know what it does but Grandma says it will help me color, so I love it.”
A special thank you to my husband who had to put up with my long ramblings, my sudden interest in tree lore, and my never ending spelling questions. I hope you all enjoy this as I tried to make something special.
He wanted to say more, but nothing better than a short thank you seemed to suffice. He nodded to Draco, shamed that Draco had heard the interchange, but unwilling to think about it when Luna's life was on the line.
Harry rolled his eyes, turning his body underneath the spray. While having another man in the bathroom was uncomfortable, the shower curtain to the claw-footed bathtub was solid, allowing Harry his modesty.
Snape never sought out Harry's company nor purposely spoke to him. The fact that he was doing both made all of Harry's warning bells go off.
But the moment Draco returned, the weight on Harry's heart suddenly withdrew and all the blood came rushing back.
‘The black cauldron is a myth, a story passed down for generations. Many details have been lost throughout time, but some truth remains. The black cauldron’s myth was born out of the true tales of the Magical Cauldron. Its story was spun as way to warn young witches and wizards away from darker magic regarding life and death. The truth is much darker, and more sinister than you can ever imagine. Many years ago, the oldest Malfoy fought against those dark forces and stole the Magical Cauldron. He hid it here on this island, but was unable to perform the task necessary to destroy it. It has fallen on this youngest Malfoy to complete what his ancestors could not. ‘
After a while, though, their time together grew tiresome. Neville was just too nice. He agreed with everything Harry said. Neville was a war hero, and yet he treated Harry like the second coming. He couldn’t be with somebody who never challenged him. And when the greenhouse was done, Harry let his crush go.

“Well yes, because Teddy is four. I helped him, but I only wrote down exactly what he wanted to say.”
Harry looked down at Draco's feet wrapped loosely with brown felt and tied with leather straps. 'It might be better if you weren't wearing such flimsy shoes.'
And then Teddy ran up the stairs to play with the other children, leaving Harry alone at the bottom of the stairs with an empty hand.
With a swift kick, Draco's feet returned to the top of Harry's desk with a large thud. 'Very interesting things,
And then Dean began to speak again, 'I met someone, Harry. Someone wonderful on my last trip to Ecuador. His name is Sam, and he's sweet and kind and hot as hell. I came home to tell everyone that I was moving back there permanently when I saw the letter from you to Luna about this last mission. I wrote to Sam and he understood why I needed to come along on this last mission.'
'And finally we come to the beauty in our group.' The tall Amazon-like woman raised an eyebrow. 'You might recognize her as your fellow classmate, although she was in Ravenclaw. Harry, meet Padma Patil. She's been living in the jungles of South America, trailing the ferocious Chupacabra. I convinced her to accompany us, only by promising to fund her next excursion.'
Draco’s face turned icy. “Of course it was. Dumbledore was a beloved figure, so were you, and I wasn’t sufficiently punished.”
Harry sped up on his bike, ideas of how this Harry could make it up to his Draco floating through his mind, making the ride more than uncomfortable.
Harry stood up quickly, his knees bumping into the table, making the cups clink on their saucers. Snape brought down his paper and looked at Harry disapprovingly, but Harry ignored it. He turned, ready to race outside.
Harry reached down to help him, hurrying to pull his shirt while Draco worked his trousers, pulling a little too harshly around his cock. “Ow! I normally undress when I hear the bell, but I wanted to talk to you.”
“Well, Harry, thank you for dinner. I will be here tomorrow with my mother. Aunt Andromeda, my mother sends her regards and says she looks forward to wearing her Muggle wardrobe.”
'Land!' Harry yelled, pointing in the direction of the object. The crew all strained to see what Harry was seeing, especially Draco who had precariously leaned over the side of the boat for a better view.
For all his faults, Harry had always found Draco outwardly beautiful. His porcelain skin begged to be touched and marked, his soft downy hair pleaded to be tugged.
"No. I need to make sure that what happened to my parents never happens again. I need to make sure that hate and fear are no longer taught at schools, but rather acceptance, tolerance, and equality. That's the Green Rebellion, Harry. That's what we're all about."
Completely ignoring the exchange, Luna waved a wand from the tip of her head to bottom of her shoes, changing her garb from eclectic witch's wear to Celtic princess, her radish earrings turning into yellow goldfinch feathers.
Draco seemed almost as lost as Harry when Teddy acted up, really not wanting to scold his cousin, but rather tried to reason with him. Common mistake, trying to reason with an almost five-year-old. Andromeda attempted to be firm, but it was hard across the dinner table. Harry thought about crawling underneath the table and dragging Teddy under until he calmed down.
Still in orgasmic glow, Harry felt his lover speed up and then tense, his own orgasm ripping through him. Harry closed his eyes, reveling in the aftermath of a fantastic shag while Draco collapsed on top of Harry, his breathing ragged.
I bound up the stairs two at a time, making as much noise as possible. My father dumps another box in my arms before I can get a word in and kicks me back toward the stairs. This one smells like salt and brine. It must be the seaweed.
Harry changed his thoughts to Hagrid, or pincushions, or anything other than Draco bent over the nearest table while Harry loving licked every part of his beautiful arse.
Draco hesitated, looking back to the crew and back to the Cock-Eyed Squid. Harry sympathized and understood Draco’s hesitation, but if Draco truly wanted the information he would have to reveal his motto. After a few moments, Draco nodded towards the crew in an unsaid acceptance and turned back to the Cock-Eyed Squid. ‘Will you tell me the location of the Magical Cauldron if I recite it?’
Draco looked a little nervous, unsure. Harry had felt that way too, at first, but then the constant trees and the rocking of the train had eased his worries.
A typical English woman, Mrs Granger had her hair up in a frizzy bun, pencils sticking out this way and that. She was wearing an apron that said, “Kiss the Cook,” that looked completely unused. So much so the creases from the packaging still showed.
Harry blushed at his own audacity, but when he opened his mouth that’s what came out. He really needed to stop doing that.
The squid’s eye continued to stare at the group. ‘Are they? Well then, the fight was for naught. Had I known the submarine would make me a cuckold, I would not have pursued it so vigilantly. We believed it was another squid and were each overwhelmed with covetous lust. To lose such a precious younger brother over such a thing!'
I shoot up, my ninja-like reflexes failing me as I knock into the table, banging my knees and shaking the gold china plates and the fancy gravy boat my grandmother sent us for Christmas. My mind explodes into worry and I blurt out the first thing that comes to me.
Harry watched as the first years lined up alphabetically, the prefects already familiar with their names, making it easier.
. Harry had spelled the map to follow their movements, spell work he learned while studying the Marauder's Map, and yet their shoe prints never came close to the location. Harry swore the destination was changing as they travelled.
“Fine! Great! I know you would love it! Why don’t I take Draco to the garden now and we can get started and in an hour I’ll come back and make breakfast. How do omelets sound? Good? Great!”
Draco stared at Harry incredulously. Harry could see his thought process running through his eyes, wondering where Harry's sudden interest came from.
Draco shook harder and sobbed louder. Harry brought him into his lap and cradled him until his sobs quieted.
Draco's face changed, his cheeks becoming heated and flush, as his body pushed into Harry's. “Oh, now I understand the appeal.” Draco began to lick, and pull, and bite around the strap, making Harry's toes curl and his body to break out into goose pimples. They had just exhausted their bodies, but it looked as if they were headed into round two.
Harry paused, unsure how to respond. It was not what he had expected the Cock-Eyed Squid to say first.
There was a call from Luna to look to the left. High in the trees there was one single stone turret peaking out, its manmade structure sticking out like a sore thumb.
“Well continue channeling your inner housewife, Potter, it’s a good look on you. One day you’ll make a man very happy. Perhaps more so if you wear that apron again and nothing else.”
Draco didn’t respond. He continued to hang his head, his blond hair falling into his face. Harry shrugged, not too disappointed. This was just the Hogwarts Express, nothing else to worry about really.
Narcissa was sitting in a long nightgown reading an old hardcover book. Her hair was swept back in a bun. The years had been hard but her beauty still shone through. These quiet moments always reminded him of his father, sitting alone in a cell, unable to sit next to his wife and smoke a pipe.
Lestrange strengthened his hold, shaking Finn around. Finn looked scared, his freckled face pale underneath Lestrange's arm. Lestrange had must have placed a Sticking Charm on his lips because he looked to be vainly trying to pry his lips open.
“Malfoy, is there anyway that we can speed up the process? I mean, Teddy’s birthday is in just a little over a month.”
Draco, clearly having difficulty with the entire situation, managed to croak out a response, but just barely. “How much do you remember?”
Harry hated the boys down in Kent. They all chewed gum, their tongues smacking against the roofs of their mouths in a constant rhythm that made Harry want to yank their jaws off.
Draco stood beside him, his wand out as well. They were then joined by Sir Culhwich, Dean, Finn, and Padma, her eyes murderous, her bow loaded with three arrows.
Harry tried to shake off the woman’s vice-like grip. “Excuse me, I’m not sure I know what you're talking about.”
Harry looked up to see a dozen or so men trying, in vain, to pry open doors, windows, exactly like the home in London, except for the rain. Of course it would be sunny for the boys in Kent.
When he arrived, the cauldron was furiously boiling. Voldemort's body lay limp next to it. The body was badly decomposed, the skin on his face rotted away, his hands and feet curled up and brittle, his robe tattered and worm-eaten.
Clearly not expecting such a swift negative, Draco dropped his feet, leaving more dirt on Harry's clean rug, and leaned menacingly forward.
Harry had reached the end of the line. The last little girl with pigtails and wide eyes. She was bouncing on her shoes, unsure if she was excited to be sorted or scared that she would be the only one not included in the Slytherin house.
“No, nothing like that. Well, I mean, we’ve just talked a lot and we share some affection,” Harry, thinking of the hand job and the kisses, blushed. “But, it really doesn’t mean anything. Draco will agree with me. It’s really the first time I’ve had someone to talk to about all this, and I think he likes talking to me about it too. And sometimes we just express our friendship that way, that’s all.”
Malfoy was staring at him with his arm crossed, a deep frown, and one pale eyebrow practically to his hairline. Damn eyebrows.
Each tree was different, from the very large trees that seemed as big as a small cottage, to the gnarly old trees whose branches slumped to the ground. The ground was soft as they walked; the smell overwhelmingly earthy.
I shiver, unwilling to think about how Harry convinced my father of his seriousness. I make a face, sticking my tongue out and making a gagging noise.
Harry attacked Draco's neck in response and spelled away his own clothes. Once they were both naked and hard, the sudden friction of skin on skin made Draco hiss and Harry cry out.
Harry lifted his hands in surrender, but he was not leaving without some sort of reassurance that Draco was doing something about the bark. A year ago, would Harry have been as stubborn as he was now in regards to Draco’s well being? Perhaps not, but it felt right to be stubborn. Something inside him was telling him this was the right course.
On the third day, or rather night, Harry came at two a.m. armed with his horn, his cymbals, the ankle bells, and a giant cowbell around his neck. He marched, blew his horn and clashed his cymbals. And when his lips felt as if they would fall off, Harry began to sing, loudly and poorly, at the top of his lungs.
‘That druid was the first Malfoy. I have his map, but it fails to tell me where the Magical Cauldron actually is.’
to name a few. He had the office calling as many as they could, but it was like searching for a needle in a haystack.
Harry smiled softly, aware of the irony. He had railed in the past, but all it did was make his throat sore.
Draco pulled a book from the side table and handed it to Harry. Someone had left a bookmark in the middle of the book, so Harry started there.
Harry scratched his chin. 'I just don't see Draco putting up such a fuss for a cauldron that makes food. In my gut, I feel like it does something else.'
Most Muggles have their decorations down by the sixth of January, lest some evil witch or wizard comes to curse them with bad luck, but in the Malfoy home we do the exact opposite.
“We both know it’s a formality, Ministry red tape that ends the moment we release your probation, but he doesn't know that.”
“Which part? The part where I would wallow in my own self pity in the middle of the street? Or the part where I would come to you, of all people, for help.”
The crew laughed. With a single nod from Harry, Dean let Finn loose, but not before pushing him off balance. Finn was ready to return the favour, but one look from Draco stopped him in his tracks. Finn brushed himself off and stood closer to Padma, on the other side of the map. The woman sniffed in his direction, but said nothing.
So Harry did the only thing he could do. He asked Kreacher for help. If Kreacher could follow Malfoy around in sixth year all over Hogwarts, then he could certainly find him now.
Harry could hear the footsteps of his crew behind him, but all he cared about was reaching the clearing and stopping Draco before he destroyed the cauldron. Before, he was resigned to Draco's fate, but now there was no way he was going to allow him to give up his own life!
"No, I don’t believe you know him, but you may have heard his name back when we lived in Wiltshire."
“Do you mind terribly explaining to me why you just didn’t tell my aunt that I was building a tree house for your godson? Mm? Wouldn’t that have been like, perhaps, 20 million times better!”
What if his dick was too small? It seemed of normal length back in the boy’s locker room. Ginny seemed to think it was an okay size. Shit, should not have thought of Ginny. Their sex life was a disaster. He couldn’t help but compare himself to Dean the entire time. She should have never told him that she lost her virginity to him. He was a good foot taller than him and had big feet! Everyone knew what they said about big feet.
Malfoy was looking at him with growing horror. It seemed he was catching on, but Andromeda was not. He could just about feel the change in the air when she opened her mouth. He knew what question she was going to ask and he knew it was a risk. It was risky to say what he was going to say in front of his childhood enemy. He was risking losing the tree house altogether, but if he played his cards right the excuse would explain Draco’s presence and give them some breathing room in the garden.
Harry pulled his hand slowly down from his face, trying to wipe away the tear stains from his cheeks. Draco was very close, his face full of concern.
Harry re-read the first few lines to himself aloud again, but it still all sounded like garbled gibberish to him. Why didn't poets just say things straight out? Why did everything have to mean something else?
"You know how I can sit here and teach these things with a clear conscience? You know what keeps me sleeping at night? Knowing that these kids will NEVER make the same mistake that I made. That these children will always think for themselves. You're right, I did horrible things when I was younger, but I'm doing everything I can to make up for it. You say I've never been oppressed, but I'm not allowed to shop in any stores, I'm spat on in the streets, my family's money was taken away and our ancestral home was burned to the ground. I live in a one-room apartment over my classroom because that's all I can afford and I was only given this job because I make less money than every other teacher here. Hell, Neville makes more than I do working as a consultant for half a day."
Malfoy seemed to approve if his nod was anything to go by. He produced a piece of parchment that he levitated beside his shoulder. What looked to be a Quick-Quotes Quill stood at the ready beside the levitating paper. Draco than began a series of spells that Harry had never heard of and flashes of color began to consume the tree-tops. A few birds were spooked and flew quickly to calmer trees.
“I can't promise anything, but once it starts I sort of have trouble stopping it. And why aren't you yelling at me for being a pervert?”
Harry wanted to believe him, but it was so hard considering how little remorse Harry had seen from Draco these past years. The few interactions Harry had with the Malfoy family, each member had treated him like he was scum beneath their boots, even though he had been the only reason they had been saved from spending their living years in Azkaban.
There was a tiny buzz in his brain about the whole situation, a tugging at his ear that felt strangely like they way Hermione would tug on his when he was doing something foolish. He knew there was something not quite right when he stopped brining men home he met at the bars. Even worse, he had begun to come home early and shower, erasing the smell of where he had been and with whom. And soon, Harry knew he would stop going out all together.
That almost caused Draco to spit out his beer, but he seemed to be able to swallow it all in before he sat up straight. “It depends.”
Mr Potter, still chewing loudly on a piece of bread, takes a look around the room. The dining room has been turned into an underwater winter wonderland. My father trimmed the ceiling with white lights and hung seaweed from the top of the bay window. The china cabinet is covered in paper grindylows my father and I made the first year in our cottage, and the dining room table has a beautiful underwater centerpiece we bought from Harrods last year. While he was decorating the dining room, my father had sent me outside, in the cold, to tie all the red and gold ribbons to the tree and stake the grindylows. I had been quite annoyed to be standing in the cold while my father enjoyed the cozy warmth inside.
Draco smiled, very glad that he convinced the costume shop to let him exchange his Merlin costume for the sexy Alice in Wonderland.
“Not if I want to live,' Draco replied shortly. 'Also, I'm not trying to distract you. I just enjoy getting underneath your skin. You make the cutest face when you're mad.'
Draco began to make short little manic bursts of laughter. “I did, didn't I? I broke the Elder Wand. We don't have to worry. I did it. I saved the day!”
I trip over a side table, sending a kelp wreath flying to the floor. My cheeks feel hot and my eyes are suspiciously wet, so I'm having trouble seeing where I'm going. I hear my father shout my name, but I ignore it.
Harry nodded, tightening the blanket around him. “What's going to happen when it gets colder? I don't think I want to sit outside when it begins to snow.”
The sweat was beginning to pool behind his knees. He looked toward Malfoy, but he was no help, smirking behind his large purple coffee cup. Oh no! He was bad at this. So Harry did what he did best, jumped in heard first and lied, horribly.
Draco wasn’t lying in the middle of the bed, like Harry had been expecting, but was rather standing in the middle of their room admiring himself in a full-length mirror, swishing back and forth.
“Why wouldn’t I stay? Meals were part of the deal. Go and order now. If you’re getting Indian make sure to get me some samosas. I love those.”
Draco sneered, but Harry didn’t take offense. Harry just smiled back. Draco looked at Harry strangely before continuing.
Darco moved his hands to the back of Harry’s arse and pulled in forward. Getting the message Harry began to rock. It felt so good. Nothing had prepared him for this. Ron had said that sex was good, but this was better than good, this was heaven.
Harry looked at his watch and tried to calculate the time it would take him to ride to Surrey. He had just enough time to make it.
'What's going on?' Finn yelled, holding on tightly to the foremast. Padma and Sir Culhwich were both behind him, keeping one hand firmly gripped in the ropes.
“You could also have done good things with it. In the right hands it could do so much good.” Harry held onto the wand, feeling the weight, imagining himself carrying out great deeds.
People were like ants, Harry thought, crawling over a Sunday picnic in the park. Human power was in numbers, and if people knew of this isolated undeveloped island, they would crawl all over it with their industry and jobs and daily routines and this peaceful simplicity of trees, birds, water, and cliffs, would end.
Draco squeezed some more. “No, you want to pry. I’ve let you do that long enough. Go back to saving kittens from trees and leave me alone.”
"Thank you all for coming this evening. I hope you enjoyed yesterday's newsletter. I personally thought it was one of our best. I want to thank Judy for taking on the role of Editor in Chief this year. I'd been doing it too long."
Harry grunts in response and walks toward the dining room, but before he leaves, he turns and comes back, giving a quick kiss on to my father's cheek.
“No! It was just his voice, telling me what to do, where to stroke, things like that. Afterwards, I cleaned up and headed back into my room. It never happened again and we never talked about it. I always wondered though if that was normal. I mean, what straight boy would be comfortable telling someone else how to wank?”
Knowing Malfoy would most likely argue and disagree and throw a huge temper tantrum, while making his speech he had very slowly crept toward Malfoy and slowly eased his arm behind Malfoy’s back and pulled on his robe very subtly as to cut off Malfoy’s airways. To Andromeda, he hoped, it would just look like Harry was giving support to a friend.
Nott was not as easy to catch. His movements were erratic and his spell casting much quicker. Harry and his crew were struggling to throw up shield charms and avoid his Blasting Curses.
Harry panicked thinking about dating someone else. He would have to deal with the awkward conversation, the fight to pay the bill, trying to figure out when it was appropriate to kiss. He hated dating. He’d rather find someone that was instantly comfortable, skip all the dating. Someone he could cook for and someone he could hold hands with while watching a game on the telly.
Snape began to protest, but he must have seen the determination in Harry's eyes, because he eventually relented and stood, his wand out.
I drop the holly and mistletoe near the door and clamber up the steps once more, laughing at my father, who unknowingly sports spiderwebs in his hair.
Draco's free arm was wrapped tightly against Harry's waist, his chest flush against Harry's back, his breath in Harry's ear. They began to fly towards the edge of the lake but Draco whispered softly. 'No, I don't want them to see this. Take me to the other side, to that thicket of trees.'
Then there was a rumbling vibration that shook the walls, and water dripped heavily from the sides of the cave.
I pause, looking behind me again, before I lift the folder out of the suitcase. I bet this is a case file, full of criminal acts and bad guys. My hands itch to open it and I'm not very good at controlling my impulses.
He was so engrossed in his task that he forgot what was happening to him. A rather sharp twist around the head of his own cock suddenly brought back awareness to his own body. A man was stroking off his cock. Draco’s long fingers seemed to skim lightly down the shaft and then tighten at the head making Harry see stars.
Harry stepped closer to Draco and curled a hand around both of his fists. “How long has this been going on?”
Draco pulled Harry back into the bed. The sheets were soft, but Harry noticed little about them when Draco placed his head on Harry’s chest. Harry reached up and stroked Draco’s hair. It felt even softer than the bed.
Suddenly Harry had a clear picture of how Draco would have his way with him. He could feel the man's arms around him, smell the man's skin, taste the man's tongue on his. Harry licked his lips almost expecting Draco's taste to still linger upon them.
“I have a question, Mother. You have always told me that no matter what, family sticks together. But what I don’t understand is how you can say that and yet you never speak to your sister, never reach out. We accepted Aunt Bellatrix, who had been one of the first to throw us on the tender mercies of the Dark Lord and we followed father even though he clearly had no idea what his actions meant. I understand that perhaps in the past it had been unseemly to speak to someone who had married a Muggle, but surely after the war you could have made amends?”
But this time, Harry wasn’t going to let an opportunity to know more pass him by. ‘Why does it bring trouble? Is it dangerous?’
Harry stood up from beside Neville and walked to the Sorting Hat. He looked out into the crowd and saw Teddy. His eyes bright and strong. How could he have missed it? Teddy was always strong, always smart. He was gentle, never wanted to hurt even a fly that had lost its way and landed in Andromeda's kitchen.
Draco sighed and nodded, changing the topic. 'It's been a long while since I've been in a situation like today.'
"And, while Alex was nice, he never would do the things I wanted him to do. He wanted someone who was dominant on the outside but submissive on the inside, like Hermione. He likes the fact that Hermione challenges him all the time in public, but from what I know of Hermione and what I've heard from Alex, it's his show in the bedroom."
Harry could feel it. The orgasm was coming soon, and it was going to be a big one. It felt as if all of his insides were tightening into one big tight ball that was going to release into a giant explosion. He tried to warn Draco, he really did, but the explosion was happening too quick and his whole body was focused on emptying itself into Draco that it had no energy left for his brain.
'You should all get some rest,' Harry calmly stated, turning back towards the water. 'I'll take first watch.'
He waited until nine, keeping the eggs warm under a Heating Charm, even after Andromeda had taken Teddy to the park.
Oh he was digging his hole deep, and the lack of response from either Andromeda or Malfoy made him keep digging.
“Really! I haven’t seen it all up yet, but I’m sure it’s going to be great. Draco is a great architect. I’m sorry I lied, but I just wanted to surprise both you and Teddy.”
It was Andromeda. She didn’t seem to notice that Harry was inches away from a full body sob, so Harry focused on the distraction and headed back into the house.
Teddy had begun to fidget and begged Draco to come upstairs and look at his latest paintings. After being excused, Draco and Teddy headed upstairs. Harry started to clean the table, but Andromeda shooed him away.
Written for the 2009 hd_career_fair. A big thank you to bk7brokemybrain,thesamanthahope, tari_sue, and empress_jae for all their hard work! And the fabulous art work is by cydienne! :)
Thank you so much for reading this fic - this is the last part. And thank you to sevfan for all her help. Disclaimer and thank yous are also on Part One.
My father knew my mother for exactly three days before she became pregnant. It was a chance meeting between two previous socialites who had been shamed out of their social scene; my father because he allowed Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and my mother because her father was found guilty of funneling money to Voldemort. They were a distraction for each other, one that didn't last very long.
“If you must know, it’s Andromeda’s. I always get something on my clothes when I cook and I really don’t feel like changing again.”
After a few moments, Draco pulled back, taking his softening cock with him. Harry opened his eyes in time to see Draco cringe at the gooey mess on his skirt.
That sounded like something Hermione would say. She might have said it back when Minister Madson made the rule, but to be honest the rule made a lot of sense. These people had to be taken down a peg or two, right?
Harry's hands could not get enough. They traced every part of Draco, feeling every inch to make sure this was real.  He was real.
At the moment, though, Draco was working on a particularly hard branch, twisting it to fit his needs. He normally wore Muggle clothing, slacks and shirts, but today Draco had decided today to wear jeans that seem to slip lower and lower in the hot sun, and a white t-shirt that was clinging to his back. Harry could see every twitch of muscle as Draco struggled with the spell. He licked his lips. This was not good.
Harry grabbed his wand and waved it at Draco's bed, Summoning Draco's sheet and placing it back on his arse, giving the man some modesty. Then he settled in for what he knew was going to be a long night.
Harry did not turn to see, but he could feel Draco standing close behind him, and smelled his musky scent, still strong even though Draco wasn't standing as close to Harry as he was in the meeting room. Luna changed into her goldfinch form and settled upon Harry's shoulder. Harry reached up and petted her back feathers.
Harry looked out into the sky hoping to see a certain yellow bird, but all Harry could see was blue and white. Luna was not back yet.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. He stepped towards Kreacher, taking a hold of his arm. “Take me to him, Kreacher. Now.”
Luna rested her head on Harry’s back. He could feel her smile. Harry looked over to the crew. Padma was smiling brightly, her eyes never leaving Luna’s.
Finally, after a few more terrifying moments, Draco emerged, and in his hand was a large black cauldron.
Harry looked up at Neville sitting at the head table. His plate was piled high with sausages and bacon in the shape of a log cabin.
'I don't think you heard me correctly. I'm not asking your permission, I am informing you of my actions. It is out of my fondness for this current Ministry that I do so, not out of obligation. Technically, as a descendant of Lugh Lámhfada  I have every right to do with the ship as I please.'
Harry raised his wand to fight back, but suddenly there was a noise behind him and then pressure on his temple.
“I will tell you, only if you start arranging the sticks. Its not pointless work, there is a reason for all of this. It will make the tree house better using the natural wood from the area.”
Harry placed his fists on the table, attempting to curb his agitation. He counted to ten before he responded to Draco's irritating questions. 'It's been fourteen years since we belonged to any house, Malfoy. Some of us grew beyond who we were when we were eleven. Right now, I have an obligation to this crew to keep them safe and if that means looking like an old fart, so be it. I do not like walking into things blindly, and I have a terrible feeling about this map of yours.'
But once my father recognized that he was to have a son, everything changed for him, or at least that’s what he says.
This time he purchased a few books before planting himself in front of the display window. He didn’t want to admit he was waiting to see if Malfoy would pass by. It was silly, considering Malfoy probably had only walked past the window by chance the week before, but Harry had never been the best planner. He was going to sit on the sofa near the window, which was quite a comfortable spot, and read his books. And if Malfoy passed again, then Harry would just confirm that it was a trick of the light and Malfoy was really an equally confused and panicked pre-adult, just like the rest of them.
Harry knew he had a goofy grin on his face and that his words were completely uncharacteristic, but seeing Malfoy in person was just as bad as seeing him through the window. The man looked as if nothing bothered him; his hair perfectly styled atop his head, the same dark blue scarf arranged artfully around his neck. It was a muggle bookshop and Malfoy looked like a regular muggle bloke, picking up a few books for university or a little light reading between dinner parties. Didn’t they all just live through a war? Didn’t Harry read that Malfoy’s parents had been banished to Europe? Why did Malfoy look so unruffled?
Draco pulled away, wrapping the sheet around him. “I have to go back, as soon as the sun rises. They only gave me Beltane.”
'Later,' Harry replied, laying a firm wet kiss on Draco's lips, not caring that everyone was watching.
Malfoy stood up, taking the book away from Harry and jerking his wrist again, returned the item back into a business card. He handed the card back to Harry.
‘Do you know your purpose? You and the Magical Cauldron are linked. You do realize what that means?'
It had been four days since Harry had last left the house. Being a man of idle means meant a thrilling life of half-finished crossword puzzles and meals consisting of cereal straight from the box. Harry looked down at his pyjama bottoms he had worn for the past few days, scratched the stubble on his face, and made a decision.
His body felt as if he needed to be somewhere, somewhere important. His dream was already beginning to fade into his sub-conscious but the
Harry wanted a normal life. Had running away back to London, away from the call of the sea and the thrill of exploring new places and people, truly given him the normal life he desired? What was this so-called normal life? Was it daily routines and morning toast? Or, was that the brand of normal his aunt and uncle had always tried to shove down his throat?
His cell phone, still inside its holster on his hip, began to ring and vibrate madly. Still disorientated, Harry picked it up, distractedly answering while he scanned the area to find out where he was.
At least once a night Draco would wake up. Harry's wand would buzz and brighten and Harry would quickly dress and make his way outside. Draco would be sitting up in his blankets looking around as if he didn't recognize his surroundings, and then he would look at Harry, his eyes unseeing, his face blank. This would continue until Harry reached him, touching him softly on the shoulder. Then, and only then, would Draco snap out of his stupor, shaking his head.
"The History of Magic classroom! We used to do tons of stuff while Professor Binns droned on and on, he never noticed. These kids are smart."
“Holly doesn't even make sense in that sentence. Do you not understand what Yeats is trying to say here?”
Harry reached out and placed his hands on Draco’s thighs, right below the lace top of the tights. His fingers tingled with the new sensation while his lover hissed in appreciation. Harry began to slowly rub up and down the thigh, boldly moving his hands from the knee to the bottom of the knickers.
That’s my father, the notorious Draco Malfoy, as he claims. When I was very little, my father would spit out the word notorious before his name like it was a piece of gristle stuck between his teeth. I had no idea what the word meant, but I could sense it meant something bad. I was confused as to why my father used such a word to describe himself, and when I heard him say it, I would curl behind his legs and pull at his trousers to get him to stop.
Finally, after entering a third finger, Harry's cries for more were answered. Spitting into his palm, Draco rubbed his cock with the moisture and then slowly entered Harry.
And then there were comments like that. Mixed in with his daily insults and long practiced sneers came fleeting, almost flirtatious comments. It was like he was a ball on the end of a string being bounced around by a curious kitten with claws.
My mouth waters. Currently sitting on the kitchen counter is a large, luscious, juicy, tasty, flaky, wonderful apple pie, which my father baked this morning. I've been craving it since I smelled the cinnamon and nutmeg wafting through the cottage, my father slapping my hand every time I tried to sneak a taste.
Draco then left his bed and stood in the middle of their quarters. Harry was unsure if Draco was awake or still in midst of his nightmare, but Draco’s intensity led Harry to believe that Draco was awake and fully aware of what he was doing.
My usually eloquent father seems to be at a loss for words. I fiddle with my spoon and wait for his answer. My father is very open with me, most of the time, but when we venture into his past or into anything magical, my father clams up faster than an actual clam. I remember the wizarding world and how it treated my father. I remember being called names and turned away from shops. My father has told me the basics of what happened, what he did, but I still don’t quite grasp it all and I know he’s left a lot of details out.
Harry scooted closer. “No really, thank you. It was really dangerous for you to lie like that! Why did you do that for us? I thought you would have been overjoyed to hand us over.”
“Black, we got another one of those sealed-off homes, down in Kent. Chief wants you to check it out and see what the boys down there make of it.”
“Not sure. The alarm was tripped, although buggered we are to find a way into the house to see what happened. The place is sealed tighter than an Egyptian tomb. We’ve tried to break the windows, bust down the door, but none of it's working. We’ve got a call out to a wrecker to come with the heavy machinery. The wife's a mess because they just repainted the front door.”
At this Malfoy stopped his pacing and spoke to Harry as if speaking to a small child who was hard of hearing.
Harry understood the validity of Snape's concern, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it. It just didn't feel right.
“But… but…” I sputter; my mind is not able to comprehend what my father is saying. I want to argue, shake my father until he sees reason, but the sudden closeness between my father and Mr Potter is sending my thoughts whirling.
“Happy Beltane, Draco. It’s our first one together! Did you know that May is the month of the Hawthorn tree? Wasn't that what your wand was made of? Mine was made of Holly. Did you know that Muggles used to use Holly to protect them from witches? Ha! Maybe that’s why my wand was made of that; I had to protect everyone from bad witches and wizards.”
“Well see when I went shopping for Teddy’s birthday present I ran into Malfoy, no Draco, here and he seemed down on his luck. Even though he and I weren’t really friends in school I decided that bygones should be bygones and all that and he seemed like he needed a friend so I stopped to talk to him. Draco was so upset because his mother and he had a disagreement. It seems that his mother found out something about Draco that she didn’t particularly like, and she told his father, who then became very upset. He had sent Draco a rather nasty letter telling Draco that his actions were highly inappropriate and were not befitting a Malfoy. So I said that I understood how that was, having my aunt and uncle not really approving of my choices in life, but that I had a new family, with you, Andromeda and Teddy and that you guys were very accepting of my life. I suggested that maybe in this trying time Draco could approach you and Teddy and reconcile and perhaps when Draco’s parents became more tolerant they too could reconcile and we would all be reconciled together.”
“Fight me, Pansy!” Draco yelled, still lying prone in the grass. He was hurt badly. Harry could see the blood seeping from the side of his robe.
Harry shrugged. “It was the best we could do at the time. It worked for your father. He had no idea who I was. Thanks for, you know, not calling me out then.”
I jump, not expecting my father to be downstairs so fast. He pokes me in the shoulder and lifts his eyebrow. I lift mine back to say, ‘I can do that too, you know.’
'The ward goes around the castle, up and around. But there is one place it does not go. And that is under! There is a small hole here and I was able to push my hand through it.'
Teddy walked Harry over to Neville and sat him down in his seat. If he weren't trying so hard to re-forget the conversation he had with Malfoy yesterday, he would have been ashamed to be lead like a small child to the table.
“We’ll talk again soon, Andy. And you must come over to see what Draco has built for us in the trees. It is just simply magnificent.”
had been grounded, Dean had aimlessly wandered the world, working a variety of odd jobs and sampling the local delights, as Dean liked to call them. He came back to England occasionally, full of fantastical tales and new tattoos, but he never lingered long enough for Harry to have a real conversation with him.
Harry retreated to the quarterdeck and his trusty wheel, looking out onto the water, knowing where the edge met the sky that indeed that was the end of the world, at least for this floating island.
"Do you think you can? Maybe if you ram deep enough there might be a place no one else has touched."
“Pansy, what are you doing? This doesn't make any sense!” Draco yelled, quickly avoiding another spell before it smashed a flower pot.
Katie cocked her head and stuck out her hip in a clear gesture of annoyance. “Are you even listening to me? I’m up to my neck in my own cases and Chief still thinks I have time to be an errand girl. At least you should listen to me.”
I run up the stairs, taking two at a time, determined to protect my father from the beefy idiot who has invaded our home.
Malfoy had only spent a few moments glancing at the books before walking away, none the wiser to Harry standing on the other side. Harry hadn't seen Malfoy since that last night at Hogwarts and seeing him, now, dressed in smart trousers and a light jacket with a dark blue scarf, shook Harry more than it should have. Malfoy looked so grown up, as if the few months since the war had aged him at least five years, but in a good way. Malfoy was an adult; he carried himself like an adult. But what was Harry? With his t-shirt and jeans, unwashed hair and scruffy stubble, Harry was eons away from adulthood.
Lestrange, still with his arm held tightly around Finn, began to use his wand to levitate Voldemort's body into the air.
Ferrington, Garston, Harris, Jenkins, Kellie, all Slytherin. The table was beginning to bulge. Some of the upper years began to stand to make room.
But there was no one there. Harry opened one eye, and then the other, confirming that indeed he was alone in the bed, stuck to the sheets, a mess between his legs.
After the long shower, which usually ended up being more than just a shower, the pair would dress, Harry in trousers and a cotton shirt, Draco in a wizarding robe, and exit their quarters, blinking up at the bright sun.
My father shoos me into the dining room and forces me to sit down. He grabs two mugs, filling mine with orange juice and his with black coffee.
. In the past, the ship was mostly crewed by lost Gryffindors and old friends looking for work for a few months. As the days, years, went by, they all left for more stable jobs. Ron went back home after only a week, missing the regular meals of the Burrow and Hermione's nagging voice. Lavender lasted six months until she procured her clerk position at the Ministry. Seamus was with them for a year, but left to get married to a girl five years younger. Dennis left after two, the frequent pleas from his mother to come home becoming too much for the young man. And after that, Harry would hire transient workers from wizarding shipping ports to work for a few months at a time.
Harry scrambled after him, his now throbbing erection making it quite hard to walk comfortably and think clearly. Shit, talking was a terrible idea. “Wait, Draco! Forget I said anything!”
Harry was pondering exactly how a hand might ask a piece of wood if it was right for a wand when Ollivander stopped in front of a small tree; its wood ashen, the leaves gone.
And then, before my back connects with the next step, I'm floating. My mind, still anticipating the hit, shuts down completely when what was expected does not happen. I'm either saved or dead, and I'm placing my bets on dead. I throw an arm over my eyes, horribly embarrassed to have died falling down the stairs. Not much cachet in death by socks.
"No, I don’t believe you know him, but you may have heard his name back when we lived in Wiltshire."
“Just come, please? And then tomorrow we can start on the tree house again. I’ll work doubly hard and I won’t let my mind wander again.”
"But this comes with consequences. We will be at open odds with many professors and parents. I want you to be prepared. I need you to stay strong; do not be quick to anger."
“Hush. What would you have done? It happened too fast. Plus, I kind of needed this time alone. I had a lot of thoughts to put together.”
He left the sitting room and headed to his office. He passed the wall of fame, as he was calling it, that was covered in drawings of stick figures, dragons, clouds and dinosaurs. He sat down in his office chair, lifting his large feathered quill. He had a letter to write, if it was going to reach the lawyer in time.
Luna and Dean helped Harry up and held him back as the cauldron lifted into the air, spinning like a top, light bursting within and without. There was a high-pitched screeching that tore into Harry's ears.
They landed silently, Draco uncurling from Harry slower than necessary. He placed the cauldron down upon the dirt and began to fill it with water.
With his long hair and his strange attire, for a moment Harry flashed back to his memories of Dumbledore, sharing secrets with his favourite bird. According to Dumbledore, Fawkes was a very good judge of character, so why would the bird willingly go to Draco? Why wouldn't he come to him?
Harry couldn’t help the small lift in the corner of his mouth. Draco Disapparated on the spot leaving Harry alone in the back yard. He shook his head and headed back into the house. He really couldn’t remember Malfoy being this funny back in school. He realized that while he and Malfoy snapped at each other, their insults just didn’t have the same bite.
Draco refused to allow the nearing death of his father or the horror of his task to faze him. He pulled in his emotions, like pieces of stone flying together to make a wall, and shied back into the shadows of the room. These last moments, Draco believed, should be between a husband and wife.
‘It wouldn’t,’ the squid replied, ‘unless I told you where it was. Tell me, what is the Malfoy family motto?’
“He won’t, sir. He’s placed a Permanent Sticking Charm on one of the tree trunks and attached himself to it.”
Harry was already getting half hard with all the flirting, even so close to the earlier orgasm. But he wasn't 21 or 16 anymore. Things would take time.
“Potter! Merlin, you’re an idiot. A little light show and you turn to mush. I believe I may have even seen drool.”
“The knight has captured the feared and evil broccoli, but it needs a strong dragon to defeat it. You must take the broccoli with your mouth and chew it to oblivion, swallowing it down your fire breathing throat until it is no more.”
The goblin let go of Draco and smiled her toothy smile again. 'Now leave me be.' She then turned swiftly around, opened her floor door and jumped back into the golden light, shutting the door loudly behind her.
'The bird is another thing you need to get used to, Draco. She's the ship's only form of communication with the outside world.'
The sky began to darken. Sir Culhwich patted Harry on the shoulder and volunteered to take first watch, Finn close on his heels. He was ushered down to his quarters and deposited neatly inside.
Draco entered the room without a word, naked. Harry sat dumbfounded on the bed, unsure what was happening and what he should do. Draco continued to baffle Harry, turning off the lights, leaving only the sound of the tiny bell for Harry to follow, the sound coming closer and closer to the bed. The feel of Draco’s hands reaching for him in the dark, the sound following the movement, gave Harry any answer he needed.
“Harry, you have to think of it this way. All of the other kids didn’t want their parents in the tree house with them. They all were standing on the lawn watching their children go inside without them, even though they clearly wanted to take a look inside. As a parent, sometimes you have to let your kids enjoy things without you. He didn’t do it to hurt you. He loves you.”
Harry moved his hand to reciprocate, but Draco brushed it away, instead distracting Harry by shoving two fingers into his mouth. Harry sucked on them hard, getting them nice and wet, swiping his tongue up and down the digits.
Draco, seated across from Harry in the hallway on the fifth floor, raked a hand through his hair. The man had blood on his collar and an eye that was sure to bruise come morning, but he sat like a royal prince in the centre of his court.
“Draco Malfoy, Owner, Designer, and Project Manager for Malfoy Architecture, at your service. Now, before you kick me out you do owe me 100 Galleons for my consultation. It was lovely doing business with you.”
‘Fawkes seems to have a high opinion of the King’s advice,’ Draco sarcastically responded before petting the bird’s head and heading out of the door.
Malfoy chuckled and continued. “It wasn’t until after the war that I finally figured it out. The Ministry official that came to tell us that we could no longer live in the manor was this young bloke, fit, dark hair and light eyes. He told us we could no longer live in the Manor and then he asked me out. I was stunned. First, that this man had the audacity to ask me out and second that a
Draco's snarl in response changed quickly to a purr as Harry's began sucking on the nipple he had just teased to hardness. He licked around the tip, loving the feeling of the nipple twitch under his ministrations. The skin around the nipple was so smooth and so tasty. He bit down, loving the sensation of Draco squirming above him. Draco's squirms turned into a push, his hands pushing Harry's head away from his chest and hard into the mattress. “I meant to break the damn thing.”
Indeed the milk bottle is almost empty, so I pour out the last of it and shake it a little over my bowl until I get every last drop. I then place the bottle back in the fridge.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, pressing as close as possible. “I love you, Draco. If I die, then I finally get what I always wanted. I want my family, Draco. I'm tired of being alone.”
The human heart had a deeper dark side. That was why Harry had abandoned his silly childish dreams of running in and saving the day all around the world using this bloody ship and needlessly throwing his friends in danger.
I'm falling backwards, with no hope of stopping, my center of gravity shifting to my head. My back hits a step and it hurts like hell.

Ron's face pinched, probably in reaction to his own imagination on what he would look like pregnant. 'With Hermione, anything is possible.' But, as Ron was not one to dwell on the negative, his face brightened quickly and he continued again. 'But, mate, you have to listen to what I heard from George, who heard from Hannah, who heard from Ernie, who heard from Justin, who heard from Lisa, what barmy plan Malfoy has cooked up!'
“Speaking of serious, if you’re looking for a relationship I know a couple of guys from my department I can set you up with. Simon is particularly nice, likes to take things slow. Might be a good person to get your feet wet with.”
"Naw, because he's a nice guy. Most of the professors here, except Cousin Draco of course, don't really get us. They're all still back in the war, and Neville ... Neville's in the present. He dresses how he likes, he does what he likes, and he grows magical plants. Nothing really cooler than that."
Mrs Granger smiled wide and took the pink specs, daintily placing them on her face before blinking at Harry, her large brown eyes doubling in size behind the bottle lens. Harry was glad his sight hadn’t deteriorated to that degree, yet.
may not be able to speak, but I have no doubt she has a soul. If I were you, I’d try to stay on her good side, lest she throw you overboard.'
Ron threw a fist in the air. “I knew it! Is he coming today? Or is it too early to meet the family?”
Racing into the cottage, he barged into Snape's study. Without a word Harry pulled on Snape's arm and dragged him out into the field.
“But I think I remember the street he lived on. Privet Drive. My mum got lost one time, thinking their street was Private. We were an hour late to Dudley's ninth birthday party and his dad scolded my poor mum 'bout it. Wasn't allowed to visit after that, not that I minded.”
My hands shake as I peel open the folder. I do have a sliver of a conscience. There is a voice running through my head, one that sounds suspiciously like my father, that says what I'm doing is wrong. But my hand is already opening the folder. Can't stop it now.
Harry closed his eyes in shame. Of course. It all made sense now. Of course Draco was acting out of character. Of course he wasn't complaining about his impossible task. Because he had never planned on completing it.
Draco rearranged himself in Harry's office chair, switching his crossed feet from one to the other, plopping dirt onto Harry's clean desk. Harry promptly spelled the dirt away without a sound.
“I’m not his father. I would make a terrible father. I have no idea what I’m doing! I’m still a kid myself. Andromeda’s the real parent here. She takes care of me as much as she takes care of Teddy.”
was nice – especially the ten-page spread of the entire Falmouth Falcons wearing only their football shorts. Yup, Harry loved being gay.
The castle was oddly barren. There were no talking portraits or dancing tapestries on the wall. However, there was a small wooden table with a bowl of water and a bowl of seeds, and in some corridors there were tall perches for birds.
My eyes grow wide, putting two and two together. "You invited your probation officer? Isn’t he an Auror?"
Draco continued to stare out of the cave wall, not turning to address the squid’s concern. Harry looked beyond Draco to see what he was looking at. The ship on the horizon had come into focus. There was a single man riding on the deck.
“Hayden Draconis Malfoy, what in God’s name are you prattling on about? Are you making a scene on purpose?”
“I would if I could, Katie,” Harry replied sullenly, precariously standing up as the morning light began to fill more of the night sky.
And Draco was still the snob he had always been, openly mocking others at public functions and giving scathing quotes about lesser Wizarding families in the
Efnisien, who had joined Bran's army, and who was in desperate need for redemption, decided to pretend to be an injured warrior to see exactly what was happening. He spied the opposing army dumping the dead warriors into the black cauldron and watched as the warriors emerged from the opening fully alive.'
“The trip was fine. I may have purchased too much, but that’s not what I would like us to talk about.”
There was a deep sinister laugh that echoed around the hole. 'Go away. No one knows where the Magical Cauldron is. Probably stolen by thieves long ago. It has nothing to do with me, so leave me be!'
I can feel my body falling back, but I'm willing myself to go forward with my mind. I pinwheel, and roll my eyes, hating every second this delays me from running into my room and slamming my door. I'm frustrated and tired and I need some time to myself.
Several hours later, and with only a half and hour left in the roast, Draco came in, sweaty and exhausted. There were twigs in his hair and a large hole in his trouser leg.
And yet, in the midst of their coupling, his feelings had turned into an overwhelming ache of despair. Why, when they had just discovered each other, discovered that there was more than just an old schoolyard rivalry, was Draco then to be taken away from him?
Had his father known what was required of his son? Had Lucius sent his only son to die for the greater good?
The conversation at the table was mostly centered around Teddy, being particularly talkative that evening. He ignored Andromeda’s soft pleas to drink his milk and eat his vegetables, opting to play with the lobster and then later Draco’s as well. When Andromeda scolded him for playing with his food, he started to quiver his lips. And then when she removed the lobster, leaving his plate empty except for the vegetables he refused to eat, he then began to scream.
Katie surprised him by placing a hand on his shoulder. “Listen, I know it’s not my place, but take care of yourself, okay? Go out, get drunk, get laid. Do something to get those black circles out from under your eyes. They’re hideous.”
“No, the Fletchleys say it’s just a standard alarm that rings. They got a call from the alarm company while they were visiting their son in Bath. When they came home they were unable to open the front door.”
. The note was anonymous and any attempts at tracing the magical signature failed. The newsletter is a collection of student letters and poems, and this edition seems to be about people being unjust to Slytherins. There was mention of the Sorting Hat being taken, but they too seemed to not know who took it. There is no mention of The Green Rebellion in the newsletter, but they do say "Go Green" which may be a reference to it."
Draco placed his hand delicately on top of Harry's where it rested on the ground. It felt foreign, but tender. Harry looped his pinky finger around Draco's.
Hermione and Ron were setting up the food tables – well Hermione was setting up while Ron was busy taste testing every platter. Bill and Fleur were over with their daughter, Victoire, trying desperately hard to convince her to stop poking Fleur’s pregnant belly with a stick. She was convinced that would make the baby come out faster.
Dean began to object, but Harry held up a hand and nodded to Draco. They watched as the crew piled out of the room. Then, Harry turned to Draco with an inkling of what the other man was about to say.
Under the guise of helping the woman gather the junk mail, Harry lifted the letter and tucked it inside his jacket.
after the war, and he was the first to object to Harry’s decision to end their adventures. Harry never revealed his reasons to the crew. But Dean, and what had happened to him, played a large role in Harry’s change of heart.
"Smells good. When do we eat?" he says, as if he's not here to arrest my father. I narrow my eyes. My father catches me and frowns.
“This is my contact information. Keep it. First I need a look at the area you wish the tree house to reside. Then we need to discuss the design itself. Once I finish the plans I will send you an estimate of cost and time. You will need to sign a contract and then we begin."
I must look like a daft drunkard, but my body worked faster than my mind and right now seems as good a time as any to bring up the whole
He knew it! These children were learning history backwards. No wonder they were all in support of Slytherin.
Harry hadn’t even thought of the future of his friendship with Draco. It would be odd not to see Draco every day. Not to have him over for meals. He had begun to build his menu based on Draco’s tastes.
Once filled, he gathered bits of wood and brush from the area, stuffing it below the cauldron, and lit the pile on fire.
But now, Draco was here, being witty and fit, wearing casual clothes and befriending Teddy. It was so hard not to have a crush on him. But it was just a crush, Harry told himself, nothing serious.
Ron waved his hands. 'Wait! But you have to hear this, it'll only take a second, and I promise it's all true. Lisa told Justin who told Ernie who told Hannah who told George who told me that Malfoy's gone completely mental and has now started to dress like a Druidic Warrior!'
Mr. Potter looks vaguely contrite, although it’s hard to picture the man thinking anything beyond, “food, sleep, angry.” He’s like a caveman with all the black hair on his arms and his thick eyebrows.
"I spoke to him last night. I was worried about you. He believed a confrontation would help. If it hasn't, I apologize."
Malfoy held his face neutral during the exchange but his lips did quirk upwards every so often. He stole the chocolate sprinkles and gave Teddy the run for his money on sugar consumption.
“What are you doing?! Are you paying any attention? Please tell me you confused the magical sequence on only this batch.”
“Don't ever do that again! This is our new number one rule, no running around this house in socks, do you hear me?”
“I think it’s wonderful what you and Draco are building. A tree house is the perfect present for Teddy tomorrow.”
Harry paused. He had never felt suffocated where he lived before. In fact, the constant horns and shouts of London's streets lulled him to sleep at night, and the morning rush for work, thousands of Muggles and wizards rushing towards their destination, all travelling together and yet not together, endlessly fascinated Harry.
Harry shook his head. What was Ollivander talking about? What was going on? The sky was beginning to darken, the birds were no longer chirping.
Muffled underneath his own legs, Draco tried to protest. “Don't manhandle me like a rag doll!” Harry smirked and licked a firm wet line over Draco's arsehole. Draco moaned low and loud.
This had also been Teddy’s complaint, even though it couldn’t be further from the truth. How to explain to an almost five-year-old that sometimes grownups spent time with people they didn’t like? Where was Andromeda? Maybe she would know what to say.
“Might as well start from the top,” Harry said to himself, stuffing his hands in his trouser pockets.
Ron looked up from the food table, frosting covering his face and a large half eaten cupcake in his hand.
The cheers were deafening. People were standing, hugging each other, kissing, laughing. Many went to shake hands with Teddy; meanwhile Teddy shook back gracefully, but still remaining in the circle. Teddy again raised his hands and the crowd settled back down.
I emphasize the word home by jamming my finger into the table. I’ve learned from watching cop shows on the telly that the gesture shows you mean business. "What if he sees something that he doesn’t like? What if finds something here and uses it against you and keeps you on probation?"
“This badge is possible evidence in a criminal investigation,” Harry continued. “Just trying to find this Potter, but I'm not sure he even exists.”
Harry could see it, not the structure itself, but perhaps bits and pieces. But more importantly he could see the days, months, years of enjoyment he and Teddy could have in the tree house. He didn’t care how long it took Draco, he wanted the house to be perfect.
Harry woke, his hand pressed tight to his cock. It was throbbing, but Harry felt touching it was somehow wrong, as if he wasn’t allowed to, not yet.
Snorting, Draco pushed away an errant branch. 'I've no choice in my attire, I'm afraid. The instant I touched the map, I looked like this. I would change into a proper robe and not a second later this flimsy tunic would take its place. The hair too; my mother had been quiet shocked to see it so long, I tried to cut it, but it just grew back. I figured it was the Malfoy family's way of creating motivation.'
Luna hummed. 'Well, there was one ancient myth about a black cauldron, but in the myth the cauldron was destroyed. If Draco is looking for that cauldron, then he's too late.'
Thank you to blamebrampton, treacle_tartle, tari_sue, thesamanthahope, empress_jae, alovelycupoftea, and nolagal for all their help!
"I demanded he tell me what was going on with the Green Rebellion. He told me some nonsense about trolls dancing ballet and a green pasture growing over it. I think he was trying to tell me that the Green Rebellion meets in the Room of Requirement."
The only saving grace is Mr. Potter’s obvious love for my father’s cooking, as he has yet to utter a word since his plate was put in front of him. It’s like watching a competitive eater, his fork-strokes from plate to mouth are continuous and at a record speed.
grabs it and shakes it, his grip crushing my poor delicate bones. I smile half-heartedly when he releases my hand, hiding it behind my back and shaking out the pain.
“Well, he sees me and at first I don’t know what’s going on and just assume he’s changing. I’ve seen all the Weasleys change before in some from so I just walked right in and kept talking.”
Harry fell back into his bed like dead weight. He looked over to the freshly Transfigured bed beside him. Merlin, having Draco on his ship was driving him mental, how would it be to share a room? Harry was pretty sure it would be a nightmare.
Harry nodded, but Fawkes cried out, flashing off of Draco’s shoulder and reappearing on King Ascon’s. Fawkes bit the King’s ear and then flashed back to Draco’s shoulder, his head standing proud.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You banged outside my door for three days straight, just to tell me that you're having weird dreams?”
Harry stepped back to see his work. Draco looked well decorated, the red and white ribbons turning in the wind.
"I'm sure all of you are wondering as to the goals and plans for this year. Last year was a roaring success with the petitions. Anything we students wanted to change here at Hogwarts we changed, simply by asking that it be done. Asking is a powerful tool that is not normally used because we are afraid of the answer, but nothing asked, nothing gained."
Above the white blanket were small flimsy clouds that danced across the sky and brushed past the ship. Draco reached out and grazed his fingertips along one.
"Naw, I mean she's clever, ambitious, wants to be the next Minister of Magic, but she's never caused any trouble that I know of."
For the first few days Draco sat in the same chair, his face towards the window, and just listened to Harry while he read to Draco. But after several mispronunciations and what Draco called ‘poor interpretive reading’, Draco began to discuss the poems, rather than just listen.
Mr Potter drags off his robe and throws it on the bed. "I don't really like wearing the uniform," he replies, his voice muffled by the jumper that has ridden up over his chin.
Downstairs is a large kitchen with a window box full of herbs over the sink and a variety of cereals in plastic containers on the counter. I’m a Cheerios man, but my father likes the Cornflakes, and on Sundays we both like the ones with raisins, so it’s imperative that all three are available for easy access.
Mr Potter's arm is around my father and my dad is leaning into him. I take a long look at the pair of them and make a decision.
“Oh, and my glasses. God, what did we do last night? Did we go out with George again? I told you he's the wildest Weasley of the bunch. Enjoys seeing me wicked drunk.”
It was then that a strange object appeared to the far right. Harry squinted his eyes before Transfiguring his glasses to binoculars.
Harry would sit beside Draco, leaned his body against the trunk, and just talk. Harry imagined Draco's responses, imagined his cutting tones and snotty digs, but it wasn't the same. Draco was there, but Harry already missed him.
Harry had no idea what to say in response. Should he comfort Draco? Even though his thoughts were clearly heavy, he spoke with such a clear voice. Such comfort seemed unnecessary.
“Well I was given that tree house when I was six years old. It was built for a child only and only had one room. I hated it. Being an only child my source of entertainment usually came from my parents. The tree house was not large enough for adults so I was forced to play in it on my own. When I told my father of my objections he said that he would enlarge the tree house only if I did the designs myself. I think he believed that the work would dissuade me from perusing the subject. Instead I handed my father a drawing of a box with a larger box next to it. He criticized it like it was an actual design and told me it would have to be better if he wanted to give it to grown up wizards to construct. So I worked on it night and day, drawing, sketching, and slowly getting better. It became a hobby of mine, but I knew better than to give the drawings to my father. He wanted perfection that my little hands at six couldn’t deliver.”
Harry was stunned. He found himself realising that the girl was right. How could a 15 year old see something he never had?
Draco shifted and changed leg positions. The other hipbone stuck out. Harry wondered if it tasted sweaty. And then pinched his own wrist for such a crude and UNWANTED thought.
The cold shower felt good on his joints and limbs. Upon inspection, Harry counted seven bruises, including one on each hip that resembled finger marks and one around his right nipple where Draco had been quite enthusiastically biting.
With a calculated quizzical look, Draco sat back into the office chair and rested his head on top of his raised fingers. 'Strange that you say that. According to my sources, the
“Hi, Andromeda, I made them for dinner tonight. I think there are a few left. There’s also some leftover dinner on the counter under a warming charm.”
Draco's sarcastic attitude suddenly dropped. He stood stiff as a board, his eyes never blinking. Harry approached him like a scared kitten, his head lowered, his steps light.
"Are you going to tell us or are you going to stare into space for a little bit longer. Neville and I would like to have sex and you're kind of in the way."
Draco came hard. The pulsing warmth sending Harry over as well. Harry bit into Draco's shoulder to silence his cries, but he couldn't help but grab onto Draco as hard as he could.
I must look like a daft drunkard, but my body worked faster than my mind and right now seems as good a time as any to bring up the whole Mr. Potter’s here to arrest you issue.
“Yes! Brilliant right? The family reconciles, you know Teddy will love him with his obsession with blond hair, and Draco and I can become better friends while solving a mutual problem!”
'Many years ago there was a man named Matholwch. He was obsessed with a black cauldron he observed being used by an elderly couple. The pair had strapped this black cauldron to their backs and were using it to revive dead warriors. They would place a dead warrior in the cauldron and the man would revive the next morning alive, except without the power of speech. Matholwch had attempted to steal the cauldron, trapping the elderly couple along with their children and the warriors in a house and setting it on fire. Everyone died, but the couple was lucky enough to escape. They fled the country with the black cauldron and escaped to the Isle of the Mighty. The leader of the Isle, Bran, offered the couple sanctuary. In return, the couple gave Bran the black cauldron to do with as he wished.
But then Teddy did something that made Harry forgive him. He got up, gave Harry a hug, and thanked him for being so funny. Teddy then asked if they could switch seats because he wanted to sit in the farting chair.
Then to his shame, Harry began to babble. “I passed a nice park on my way here and they had some unique trees. The leaves are starting to turn and there was this one that all the leaves were pure gold! Perhaps with your new book you could identify it for me?”
From then on Harry would get up, get dressed, and head over to Draco's cottage. Snape would greet him gruffly and threaten him in different and descriptive ways until Harry nodded that he understood and made his way to Draco.
Draco visibly sagged. Harry was unsure whether it was because he had resigned himself to telling Harry the full story, or if it was because Draco wanted to clear these burdens from his shoulders. Either way, Harry attempted to show his care through his face and squeezed Draco’s still tight fists.
Teddy raced off Harry’s lap to gather a blank piece of paper and a few crayons. Teddy enjoyed sending letters to Ron and Hermione, especially because they generally wrote back. Teddy could only really write his name, but he loved to draw pictures and would draw an image to express his feelings. Teddy began to draw a yellow man with what looked like yellow cotton candy surrounding his head. He then drew another man with black hair and three arms. Finally he drew himself, a smaller figure with brown hair and a sweetie in his hand. He slowly signed his name and handed it to Harry.
"Have you spoken to Snape's portrait? The man has a screw loose, but it seems as though he gave me a clue after all."
He looked down to see Draco touching himself. It was so hot to see Draco pleasuring himself, and Harry’s cock was inside him. The thought was mind blowing. So much so that he felt his orgasm coming.
“Oh Potter, it is such a ridiculous thing to see you attempt to flirt.” Draco placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder and squeezed, hard. “But now you are going to leave.”
Harry smiled, baffled at his elated excitement over tree watching with Draco Malfoy. Were there pigs in the sky? Was Voldemort chilled by the sudden freeze in hell?
“'Fraid not,” Harry replied, trying not to laugh at the man's erratic head waving as he tried to find the non-existent film crew, although, even funnier in Harry's mind, was the man's obvious uncaring attitude toward his own appearance. The thought of being broadcast across the nation still didn't frighten him enough to hide his striped pants.
But that had been ripped away from him when he awoke on the cold, muddy earth, the sounds of battle filling his ears.
I completely lose it. I'm usually more calm and collected, cool as a cucumber with a rogue smirk that comes out once in a while, but right now it feels like everything has been pulled back taut and then let loose, like a springboard. I'm furious, confused, worried, fearful, and a whole lot of other emotions I'm not even sure how to label.
“What will it be this time, Potter? You better be making something good to reward me for making me wait until, seven o’ clock! My goodness, dinner is late tonight!”
'What you plan on doing is dangerous unless you really mean it. You must be willing to do what you must with all your soul. Good intentions are not good enough. Do you understand? The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it.'
Hermione and Ron stayed for a while, but Ron had gotten a little sloshed and Hermione was attempting to get him home with dignity.
‘Because,’ the squid replied solemnly, ‘to destroy the cauldron, one must willingly give up their own life in return for ending the spell.’
My favorite dinner of the whole year is a total disaster. The roast turkey my father had prepared to perfection tastes like sawdust in my mouth, and the scrumptious mashed potatoes I piled onto my plate still tower over my picked-at meal, threatening to topple over at any moment.
Within a split second Pansy went to casually leaning against Draco to charging at Harry full throttle. A stick was in her hand and she was screaming out words Harry had never heard before. There was a flash of light and it would have hit Harry had it not been for a giant shield that suddenly appeared before him.
Harry was fuming. Thoughts, doubts, and concerns were swirling in his head. Why had he agreed to come to this place? Why had he allowed himself to get swept up in the mission of others? Time and time again Harry and his friends were used as ammunition for other people's battles. And right now, Harry had no idea why he had agreed to put his friends in danger, once again, for Draco Malfoy, of all people.
“Nothing, just meeting a new neighbour,” he responded. “I'll be in in a minute, so head back in before you catch cold.”
So when the doors were open once again, many witches and wizards had stopped in just to see if Ollivander was truly back, including Harry. It really was good to see the strange man again, puttering around his disorganized and busy shop.
This was important stuff. God forbid he make a faux pas now. Perhaps he should just take off his jeans and then his pants. That seemed like a good idea. Oh wait, first shoes. Shoes then pants. Wasn’t that the rule?
Draco walked down the spiral front staircase that surrounded the great front tree and landed on the ground. Potter was there, sitting against the tree beside it, his back ramrod straight against the bark. He must have placed the sticking charm on his back.
"Not for a few minutes. I was just suggesting to my son that perhaps he should wash off all that teenage smell."
‘My friends believe the Magical Cauldron is the same as the mythological black cauldron. Can you at least tell me if that’s true?’
My usually eloquent father seems to be at a loss for words. I fiddle with my spoon and wait for his answer. My father is very open with me, most of the time, but when we venture into his past or into anything magical, my father clams up faster than an actual clam. I remember the wizarding world and how it treated my father. I remember being called names and turned away from shops. My father has told me the basics of what happened, what he did, but I still don’t quite grasp it all and I know he’s left a lot of details out.
This same scene replayed over and over. Harry would hear the tingle of the bells and his cock would immediately stand in attention. The visits were infrequent, at first, seemingly at Draco’s whim and fancy. Harry had keyed him into his wards so that Draco had the ability to come and go as he pleased. Once, Harry had been in the shower, mid shampoo rinse, when a cold hand wrapped around his cock and tugged. As long as Harry could hear the soft jangle of the small silver bell he knew the hands, the mouth on his cock, and the sweet breath in his ear would all be Draco.
After regaining my breath, I open my eyes to see my father hovering over me with a smirk on his face. He reaches down, swipes my socks from my feet, and pats my head.
was owned by the Ministry and was stored in their historical vaults. Now, I thought that quite strange, and my mother only lies when it serves her best interest, so I had my family lawyers look into it, and much to my surprise, I learned that the
A flash of red light zoomed past Draco's head, smashing against the side of the house and breaking a window. Draco quickly knelt down and rolled, shooting off a spell mid-motion.
With that Draco turned and began to walk away. As he turned, Harry noticed something peculiar with the neck he had just scrutinized. There, behind the ear, was a large dark brown something atop the skin that extended down the back of the neck.
Harry began to laugh himself. The memories were fuzzy and tended to disappear like smoke in the wind, but a few things stayed, bits and pieces meshing together to form a soup of a life. But in the centre was always the man in front of him, Draco, his lover. The loneliness that Harry had been feeling ever since the accident suddenly disappeared to be replaced with a joyous feeling of being full. His smile turned even wider and he approached Draco, slowly, his hands itching to touch.
“All right, all right. It’s actually over here.” Harry took his hand and led him over to the crop of trees. A piece of rope had been tied to a tree, high enough that the children couldn’t pull on it. Harry asked Teddy to step back and stand with Andromeda. He pulled the rope and the giant sheet fell to the ground unveiling a large, beautiful, natural looking tree house.
” he whispers. A thin gold line lifts off my father's wrists, hovering above him, and then it dissolves into a burst of light. We all stare at the short light show until the last twinkle disappears into the ether.
Harry pushed on. "You just open your mouth and shit comes out. Do you even listen to yourself? Do these kids know who you are? Do they know that you were the ugliest racist git I had ever laid eyes on? Do they know that you almost killed Katie Bell and Ron and Dumbledore, scarred Bill Weasley for life, allowed Death Eaters into the castle, allowed Voldemort in your house, watched Hermione be tortured, and attempted to take me straight to Voldemort to save your own skin! And here you sit on your high horse and tell them that the Ministry is bad and they shouldn't say words like 'Mudblood' in your presence. That it offends YOU! You have never dealt with prejudice and oppression. You have never had a mad man follow you just because of what some stupid prophecy said. You've never suffered. How dare you sit up here and teach Civil Disobedience when you yourself didn't have the guts to turn down Daddy's little request of having you be the youngest Death Eater."
Harry whipped out his wand and attempted to find the source of the voice, but it seemed to surround them.
Harry began the arduous task of magically hauling the ship out of the cave and out into the ocean, roping it in tight beside the high dock and releasing the anchor. Once secure, Harry Transfigured a small coin from his pocket into a ramp and climbed aboard the main deck. He sent a myriad of cleaning spells throughout the boat, creating magical brushes to soap and soak the dirty oak beams and dancing dusters to clean the magically-enlarged cabins below deck, making sure each room was sea-worthy.
Harry's eyes grew stern. 'If this Magical Cauldron has the power to revive people and it isn't broken, there is no way I would allow Malfoy to get his hands on it, no matter his reasons. Let's just hope we're wrong.'
“No you don’t! You have no idea what I am sacrificing right now. Do you know that I am currently not speaking to my mother? My mother! I’ve never fought like this with her. She won’t leave her room and she refuses to be anywhere near me when I’m home. I’ve been staying later and later here, but you and your family, they never notice. Everyone just acts like everything is normal. And Aunt Andromeda has not once mentioned my mother. I’ve been trying for weeks to get her to talk about her, just a little bit, but she just changes the subject. Don’t you find that a little odd, Harry?”
'If you wish to find your Magical Cauldron, you'll learn to stop poking your nose in where it doesn't belong. We'll begin the search, but I claim the right to stop this mission at any time.'
“Well,” Harry said, his hand tight around the badge in his pocket, “take some pictures of this and dust it for fingerprints, although I have a feeling you won’t find any. This person knew what they were doing, and it has something to do with this.” He stepped forward to take a closer look. The paint looked to be faintly glowing. “It seems I have a
That seemed to be all the information that Malfoy needed, as the levitating paper rolled itself, shrunk, and landed in Malfoy’s pocket. The quill disappeared as well, but Harry wasn’t really sure where it went. Even after all these years magic still tended to amaze him from time to time.
Snape patted the wood and walked away. He would remain in the cottage and protect the trees, although there was no way that anyone could make a wand now.
“You said that you and I were researching being gay together. Together, alone, in some shack we’re going to build!”
Draco looked gorgeous with red lips and tousled hair. Harry sat up and pulled Draco’s sweater over his head. Draco’s pink nipples were hard and Harry could see goose pimples scattered across the flesh. Harry wanted to taste the nipples, so he did, bathing them with his tongue.
Harry, finally at his destination, grabbed hold of Draco's hand, lifted it, and kissed tenderly Draco's knuckle. “Enough.”
The table grows silent. I can practically hear my own sweat burst from my face. My father is frowning again, deep lines etching on his forehead and around his mouth. He throws his napkin onto the table, a dramatic gesture I’ve learned to fear quite a bit, and stands up, much more gracefully than me.
Cardiff, Elliot, Eggston, all Slytherin. It continued one by one, each first year being sorted into Slytherin. He could hear the commotion in the back, but the Hat could not be contained. It pushed Harry's hand forever forward and Harry kept reading the list he had memorized last night.
“I didn’t know what do to, okay. I wanted to keep the tree house a secret for both Teddy and Andromeda. I panicked!”
Mr Potter looks vaguely contrite, although it’s hard to picture the man thinking anything beyond, “food, sleep, angry.” He’s like a caveman with all the black hair on his arms and his thick eyebrows.
Harry gulped, remembering his few run-ins with goblins. He could see how one might jump to that conclusion.
Harry patted Billy on the shoulder in dismissal as his eyes began to scan the front lawn. Dozens of officers were scattered across the wet field, mucking about in the gardens and attempting to pry open windows with tools. One frustrated police officer threw a stone against the window only to have it bounce back, as if the glass had turned into rubber.
The ship far on the horizon had come closer, now clearly on a path to the island. While Harry was holding off judgement on the boat's intentions, Draco was clearly distressed by its appearance.
Harry gulped, not trusting himself to speak. What was he supposed to say? Dean was his friend, nothing more. What they had done together had been years ago. They were both different people. Harry just didn't see him in that way.
Seeing the location, Harry nodded his head and walked swiftly away from Draco, unsure what had just happened, but unwilling to dwell on it. Instead he headed directly out of the room and out onto the deck. Once behind his wheel Harry yelled out to the
Chief Kingsley, wearing a ridiculous pink tie with his vivid green shirt, motioned for him to take a seat across from his desk. Harry settled in for the worst.
“Sure this isn’t part of their burglary package from the alarm company? They didn’t turn their whole house into a panic room, did they?”
He leaves my father and I alone in the hallway. Without thinking, I start toeing my socks. My father pointedly stares at me until I reach down and yank the socks off my feet.
Draco gave Fawkes one final pet and sent the bird on its way. Fawkes flew to the top of the foresail and trilled.
“But then, things just calmed down. Life went on for the next ten years. Well, at least for most people. Hermione and Ron married. They had a daughter, Harriet.”
Draco, instead of handing Harry the potion, began to pet his hair. “I'm so glad to hear you say that,” he said in a muffled voice, as if he were upset. Harry blinked, damning his poor vision. Draco must have noticed Harry's discomfort because soon Harry's glasses were placed softly on the bridge of his nose. After allowing his eyes a few moments to adjust Harry was surprised to find he was in St Mungo's.
Harry had been envisioning Draco Malfoy’s trio of freckles, so it took him a few seconds to process what Kreacher had said. “Did you say bark?”
Harry stared at Draco, who looked more like a white tiger pacing in a cage. It was fascinating. He wondered if he too would begin to blur like the images outside. Draco began to swear under his breath.
“The boys in the lab have found a way inside the house. I need you to swing by and check out the interior.”
Draco’s words echoed throughout the cave and in Harry’s mind. Draco flew back into formation, next to Harry, unmistakably apprehensive. Sir Culhwich laid a hand on his shoulder.
By this point, my headache has begun to clear, and with it the voices start to make sense. Had I thought logically I would have realized towering above me were my father and Mr. Potter, but it is hard to think logically after a brush with certain peril and death. I want to yell out that I'm okay, a bit scared, but generally all right, but I can't move, can't speak.
“I’m sorry, Katie, I didn’t mean to ignore you,” Harry replied, rubbing his red eyes, “just having trouble waking up this morning. Hand me the file, I’ll get right on it.”
Draco looked directly in the house-elf's big beady eyes and  truly wished that he was as cruel to his house-elves as they led everyone to believe.
Harry stood firm. “Magic wanted me dead! I survived the killing curse; I can find a way around this!”
'Wait,' Harry said, standing and stepping closer to Draco. In the fall, the map Draco was holding fell out of his hands and landed on the dirt floor. Harry had grabbed it while Draco was speaking to Sir Culhwich. 'The map says we've arrived. This hole is
Harry rushed forward and attempted to take Draco's arm, in order to help him stand, but Draco brushed him off. “I need you to keep this between us. You are not to speak to your friends about this nor refer to it in a letter. No one is to know about this. If anyone were to gain this knowledge who knows how many psychotic Wizards with a glory complex would come looking for me to make themselves a Death Stick.”
Mr. Potter, still chewing loudly on a piece of bread, takes a look around the room. The dining room has been turned into an underwater winter wonderland. My father trimmed the ceiling with white lights and hung seaweed from the top of the bay window. The china cabinet is covered in paper Grindylows my father and I made the first year in our cottage, and the dining room table has a beautiful underwater centerpiece we bought from Harrods last year. While he was decorating the dining room, my father had sent me outside, in the cold, to tie all the red and gold ribbons to the tree and stake the Grindylows. I had been quite annoyed to be standing in the cold while my father enjoyed the cozy warmth inside.
Harry turned around. Draco was standing right behind him, smiling. The shouting seemed to dim a little. Draco started moving quickly and Harry followed. They slipped through the side door and out into the anteroom, letting the other teachers deal with the uproar. The door closed and the cheering and yelling became soft murmurs through the door.
“Yeah, Potter lived with his relatives, never really knew why. The kid wasn't the kind to share too much information 'bout himself.”
Which is why he was so frustrated with himself for not saying no to Draco's foolish adventure. He knew better.
Snape put the book down, the page still open. The title of the poem stood out tall, its letters lovingly traced over with a pencil.
Harry admired his handiwork, taking a moment to flick the tiny bell that now found its new home below Draco's cock and above his balls. “I think I just did.”
Harry’s sudden appearance in front of Draco in the hallway startled the man, his large grey eyes growing wide, his face pinching. But then he smirked, thinking Harry’s presence was a new game. He sauntered over to Harry, his tongue tracing his lower lip, and pressed Harry into the wall, putting a bare leg between Harry’s trousers.
Draco nodded, padding out of the bed. Harry enjoyed the view for a moment before getting dressed himself. It didn't really matter what he wore, but he was sure Snape would prefer him not be nude when they spoke.
“Hayden Draconis Malfoy, what in God’s name are you prattling on about? Are you making a scene on purpose?”
Unfortunately fighting Voledemort seemed like a walk in the park compared to this. After three hours of wandering from shop to shop, Harry had had enough. He was now eating the greasiest fish and chips at the Leaky Cauldron and drowning his sorrows in his third butterbeer. He was such an idiot. He should have asked Andromeda, again, for a list. But she had already done so much for him, allowing him to stay at their house, stepping in when Teddy wouldn’t listen or would start to cry. He really had no idea what to do when Teddy scraped his knee. On himself, he just let those things go, always did. He was getting better, but a lot of things about Teddy were still a mystery to him.

Harry searched out for Draco, irrationally believing perhaps he had a part of it. Instead the man looked oddly fearful, running a hand along the ward, as if he couldn't believe its existence.
'Your crew is lovely,’ Draco's sarcasm rolled off his tongue like perfumed air, 'but I was under the impression that you were the only one accompanying me on this quest.'
Bill’s three-year-old daughter, Victoire, talked a mile a minute, in a combination of English, French and strange baby talk that only Fleur could understand. Teddy thought she was crazy, but she was one of the few kids around his age and the two tended to get grouped together in family events.
Harry looked deep into his teacup. Could he really do it? Cut down Draco and whittle him down into a stick he didn't even want.
‘Do not move’, Draco bellowed, his wand pointed to the cages. ‘Tell us how to open our friend’s cage or I release more of your birds.’
Draco breathed out and adjusted his hips a bit. It caused Harry to lose balance slightly and the rest of his dick slammed forward until he was buried deep inside.
Harry was getting close. He pushed at Draco to get him to slow down, but Draco just smirked and went faster, finding that spot within Harry that made him scream and lose all control.
"He speaks!" I say, thinking it a funny joke, but Mr. Potter doesn't laugh. He just pulls down his jumper and stares at me until my giggles turn to nervous laughter.
The lovely tari_sue made this all better. Thank you tari_sue!!! And also a huge thank you to sevfan for your wonderful patience! Thank you so much!
Still dressed like his Celtic ancestors, Draco approached Harry slowly, keeping a firm eye on Harry’s wand.
He bounded to the table, whooting with the rest of the Hall. Kids were standing, high fiving each other.
After that thrilling conversation, my mind starts to wander, and I wonder if Mr Potter wears a badge like the cops do on television. I don't remember any badges on the Aurors when I was little, but that was a long time ago and perhaps times have changed.
My father isn't even looking at me. I'm tempted to blurt out what I saw, but I keep my mouth shut. The document said "if" my father does any magic, and I know my father won't. I just have to keep an eye on Harry and make sure he doesn't do something fishy like framing my father.
“Oh no, Malfoy, that’s it. I am not doing all your manual labor. If you want them arranged you do it.”
Draco smartly took the lead as they lay in the bed. He gently and patiently prepared Harry, expressing his love with each swipe and press. Harry cried out when Draco touched something inside, making his toes curl.
But the words had already been spoken and a band raced around their hands. The force that had been trying to pull their hands apart increased until Harry had no choice but to let go. Snape, Draco and Harry all ended up on the floor. Magic wasn't happy with what had just happened, but it had worked.
"Harry, you think you know Draco, but you really don't. You always avoid coming over if you know he's going to be at Grandma's. He told me about your past, and he is extremely remorseful. I'm so grateful that he's a teacher here or else I might not have even really gotten to know him."
Harry gathered the edge of his sheet and bit into it. It wasn't fair. Enemies were not allowed to be naked and sweaty and fit and edible and within reach.
“Yes, actually. Harry Potter has commissioned me to build him a tree house for his godson, Teddy. Harry lives with Teddy and your sister, Andromeda.”
Harry raced forward to kiss Andromeda on the cheek, all the while holding onto his death grip on Malfoy. He practically dragged Malfoy to the back porch and pushed him until they had reached the crop of trees. He could feel the rage radiating from the boy in his arms, but he had to make it far enough that his screams couldn’t be heard from the house. Harry cast a Silencing Charm around the trees and let go of Malfoy, wincing at the incoming blow that was sure to come.
I shoot up, my ninja-like reflexes failing me as I knock into the table, banging my knees and shaking the gold china plates and the fancy gravy boat my grandmother sent us for Christmas. My mind explodes into worry and I blurt out the first thing that comes to me.
Malfoy lifted the broken pieces of the wand, showing Harry the clean break. “I didn't think that would work. The only way to break a wand so cleanly is if the owner breaks it.”
I completely lose it. I'm usually more calm and collected, cool as a cucumber with a rogue smirk that comes out once in a while, but right now it feels like everything has been pulled back taut and then let loose, like a springboard. I'm furious, confused, worried, fearful, and a whole lot of other emotions I'm not even sure how to label.
Harry looked up to the tree-tops and tried to image a tree house, but he couldn’t picture anything except wood and windows.
Padma then jumped into the hole, crawling on her hands and knees until she reached the other side. She continued to crawl until she reached a wall, touching the side of the castle and yelling in triumph.
Harry sat, a little nervous. The last time they had one of these talks it was after Harry came home stinking drunk and had woken up Teddy in the middle of the night to tell him how much he loved him.
Startling Harry out of his thoughts, Draco abruptly sat up in his bed. His breath was coming in short pants as his eyes focused intensely on Harry.
I shake my head and curl up closer to my dad. It's been a long time since he's held me like this. It used to be a more frequent occurrence, me wrapped up in my father's lap in front of the fire while he read to me. But once I was old enough to read books on my own, it stopped.
