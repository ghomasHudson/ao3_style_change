He chuckled to himself at that thought, and stood up to make sure everything was in place.
Harry flipped his phone shut and rested his head against the cool wall.
“The portkey activates at three?”
But the most disturbing thought of all, which Harry couldn’t stop from coming to his mind no matter how much he tried to push it away, was that Malfoy was really quite...attractive? Which was absolutely ridiculous, because no. No he wasn’t.
“It wasn’t like he gave a fuck.”
Everyone was looking at him. Or at least it seemed like it.
And god fucking dammit, he was hugging Malfoy, something he thought he would never, ever do, but then the man was sobbing into his chest, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to do anything but hold him closer.
“Why wouldn’t you want to talk about your family?”
He made a cup of the spiked chamomile, and realized how profoundly lonely he was.
“Have I ever told you you’re my favorite brother?”
“Hm.”
“Master Potter is being upset about the Malfoy-Black heir returning to the ancestral home. But Master Malfoy is belonging here. The house is being happy, and Kreacher is being pleased as well.”
to loom, but took a seat nonetheless. He drank some tea because it would be rude not to and fiddled with the sleeve of his jumper. Malfoy watched him like a hawk.
“Are you spending Christmas with us?” Ron asked the next morning. All three of them were tucked onto the sofa, spilling into each other. Hermione’s head rested on Ron’s shoulder and he drew lazy pictures on her shoulder with the tip of his finger. Her legs were curled up beside her and Harry had his toes tucked under them, his back pressed against the arm of the sofa so he could watch his friends. He didn’t know when he had become this person but he felt full and loved and warm.
A buzz went around the assembled gallery. Harry didn’t turn his head but he didn’t feel like he needed to: Hermione shifted behind him, brushing her hand against his back. He wished that Ron was here too, but Ron had taken him aside, voice low and apologetic, and said that he didn’t want to upset his mother any further. Harry understood but he couldn’t help himself from feeling his absence.
“It is,” Narcissa said, firmly. “That’s how things work. Your friend has a very important name and did a very important thing. The Obliviator office will be happy to work with him because of it. That’s power.”
. (He had asked Ron about it and Ron had shrugged helplessly. “Dad said he’s going to look at it sometime. I think it upsets Mum.”)
Harry was afraid of his grin, afraid of the giddy burst in his chest. He was afraid of how quickly it had come, how thoroughly it chased away what had come before. He laced their fingers together and then brought Malfoy’s hand to his mouth, brushing his lips against his knuckles. Malfoy stared at him, eyes bright with reverence and Harry smiled. “Okay.”
“That doesn’t mean that she can’t think I’m
“Smartest witch in the world,” Ron said, leaning forward, his expression wide open and earnest.
There was a heavy silence that swept through the library instantly, a wall of ice appearing between mother and son. Harry looked at Narcissa and then Draco, whose face had gone completely still. Stillness was, perhaps, the worst thing when it came from Draco.
Malfoy was looking at him. His mouth was red and swollen and his hair was only slightly mussed: Harry had been grabbing too hard onto the front of his shirt to really bother. He knew that his own hair was wild, even worse than usual, and he supposed his mouth looked as ravaged as Malfoy’s. He wondered if he looked as stunned or as helpless. Malfoy looked unsure, hesitant, his shirt untucked (when had Harry done that?).
“Um,” Harry said, still startled.
Ron sighed and muttered, “Wish you wouldn’t.” There was no real heat in it, though, and as he pushed himself up, gently ensuring he didn’t kick the mug on the coffee table, Harry felt a huge surge of affection. They had all spent weeks and months since the war had ended talking and trying and swearing they would be better for each other, for themselves, for the world. Ron was one of the best people Harry knew, even when he yawned so widely his jaw clicked, even when he lifted the mug of hot chocolate and drank the rest down in one gulp even though it was bound to be disgustingly cold.
Malfoy tilted his head to the side and studied him. “What is our thing then? I try to be nice to you and you run away?”
Harry couldn’t decide how affronted he was so sat, scowling, until Malfoy deposited a mug in front of him. He looked at his mug which was perfect — strong enough for him and, when he sipped it, sweet enough too. He looked over at Malfoy, who was slowly sipping from a much milkier cup of tea. Malfoy was watching him carefully.
Harry pointed at it. “He would thank you!”
Harry shuffled his feet. “Draco.”
“I’ve just got one thing to say.” Harry watched Malfoy turn towards him again, his jaw set, a wild look in his eyes. It was entirely possible that Malfoy would rush at him and grab for his wand but Harry would bet that he was quicker. He leaned forward and grinned as he said, “It’s just you went from five minutes to ten minutes, so I wondered if you were confused about how numbers worked again?”
Harry snorted and shoved at Draco, pushing him backwards, pushing him into the manor. “You’re such an idiot,” he said fondly. “It’s a good thing that you’ve got me, who doesn’t care that you’re an idiot. Who knows where you’d be otherwise.”
“What were you doing?” Malfoy frowned.
“It’s very nice, Harry,” she said, glancing at biscuit tin Harry had sat down, the wine, the panettone. An expression he didn’t quite understand played across her face and then she ran a hand over the top of Draco’s head before standing. “I have a letter that I need to send. I’ll be back later. Rather a bit later, I must admit; it will be a long letter..”
“You’re not losing your mind,” Harry said softly. “You’re just stressed.”
“I was so scared, Harry. I thought — I thought this was it. I thought it was my punishment, like it was hubris, and they wouldn’t ever remember and it would be all my fault.” Hermione gasped it out and Harry felt how much it must have hurt her. Even now, her body held that hurt. Even now, he felt the way she shuddered with the thought. Harry hugged her tighter.
Draco swallowed and then said, “Because they were important to you.” His face was aflame. Embarrassment was evident in every minute movement he made. Draco twitched his fingers and then pulled his wrist out of Harry’s grasp. Harry let him go. “Don’t make a thing out of it, Potter.”
Malfoy blinked at him and then turned away. Harry watched him watch Yolanda, who had taken to bouncing in front of them, running towards trees and then back again. “It seemed to have backfired.”
Harry squinted at Malfoy. “How many whiskeys have you had already?”
Malfoy snorted, lifting his mug to his mouth carefully and slowly before setting it down. “All right, Potter. You have twenty minutes exactly.” He nodded at Blighter, standing in the corner, and the house elf clicked his fingers. Numbers materialised into the air and started counting the seconds back from twenty minutes. Harry stared at it, surprised, for a full five seconds before Malfoy said, “You’re wasting time.”
“I know he’s not happy about it.”
“Still thinking?” Charlie asked, running a hand down Draco’s cheek.
“I love you too, dràgon beag. Let’s go, yeah? We can do this.”
The house elf appeared with a pop.
“You know it, babe.”
He couldn’t explain it, but all he wanted at that moment was for Malfoy’s hurt to go away.
“That sounds great, Mione. I’ll floo over in a bit.”
“Charles Weasley, are you trying to have sex with me in Harry bloody Potter’s house?”
“You know my relationship with them is complicated, Harry. I just like to leave that all behind while I’m in Romania.”
Charlie chuckled a little, before realizing Draco wasn’t joking.
“He’s my cousin too, then. I didn’t know she had children.”
“Well…it was-“
Theo chuckled and leaned up to kiss Harry again before rolling out from under him. “Heads.”
“It’s too bad you can’t decide that.”
I’m being nice, so you get slightly more than crumbs of drarry today. But it’s not romantic yet, because you’ll have to be patient.
Harry let out a small chuckle. “Being honest, Malfoy, so did I. I always thought he and Sirius…well, it’s not my place to say, I don’t know the whole story. But, it was nearing the end of the war, people were scared. I think they both wanted children more than anything, not to mention the pressure they were under. They had Teddy; my godson, a month before they died.”
He wondered if it would still smell like whiskey. Sure, it always smelled of the finest whiskey money could buy, but the smell still made Draco reel. He wondered if his father would still smash the bottles over his head, or if he would hesitate, now that Draco was no longer a child.
“Harry? Harry Potter?”
Let me know any opinions on posting schedules for this, if y’all want to see like once a week, twice a week, every two weeks, just whenever I feel like it, tell me! :)
It was terrible.
“-Draco?”
Later that night, Draco lay awake in bed, restless. It was cold, but not uncomfortably so, and he turned his attention to the soft moonlight drifting through the window.
Loving friend, godfather, brother and son
Justin spoke up first. “Well, I’ll, uh...see you around.”
“What?”
As always, thanks for reading! <3
It was going to be complete and utter hell.
Oops, I lied! I did not have a lot of time to write this past weekend. Anyway, here’s an update!
“Look, Harry. I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do, if I’m being honest. I don’t know everything about your relationship with Draco, and I don’t want to hurt you. Or him. You’re under no obligation to forgive him, or be nice to him if he’s hurt you. If you want me to, I’m sure I can work out something else for us while we’re here, but we just need a place to stay for tonight. It was a lot, and I was overwhelmed, and I took it out on you, and that wasn’t fair to you. I’ll try to do better.”
“Yes. I-uh, work with new and experimental wand cores and woods. I’ve been under the apprenticeship of a Romanian wandmaker for several years now. I hope to open up my own small practice someday.”
Draco stopped for a moment and turned towards Charlie, then hugged him, hard. Even if it wasn’t welcomed, he wanted to be able to do it one last time before things inevitably went to hell. He breathed in the familiar scent, and nuzzled his face into Charlie’s sweater. He would normally complain that it was scratchy, but he didn’t want to stop. Not now.
Especially not his parents.
“I love you too, you twat.”
“I’m serious, Charlie. You should find someone who’s worth it.”
-N <3
“Love you!”
“No. I don’t think I have. I’ve met dragons who have died without exactly being Norberta level cuddly, but I don’t think I’ve ever found one that hasn’t improved in their time with us. And even if I had, you’ve shown a lot more progress than ‘beyond saving’ level.”
They never referred to each other as anything more than friends around strangers, and there was an unspoken agreement of general exclusivity, though they didn’t really mind if the other slept around a bit, as long as it wasn’t too often and they kept it to themselves. While the feelings they had for each other were definitely not platonic, neither of them were ready to settle down any time soon, and they loved each other, but they knew they weren’t soulmates or anything. They weren’t meant to be together like some cheesy romance novel, and they knew they weren’t in it for the long run. What they had wasn’t perfect, or really very special, but Draco was fine with that, and it seemed Charlie was, too.
He was just about to start a new round of moping and whining to his brother, when something incredibly, terribly odd happened.
Charlie snorted. “That much is fucking clear, but there’s obviously more history there than that.”
“He’s told you everything, hasn’t he?”
Charlie held his gaze, concerned.
He sat there for several minutes, but the second before he stood up, Malfoy’s small voice broke the silence.
“Still, there’s just so much that happened here.”
“Are you sure, love? I mean, you haven’t seen them in-“
Draco chuckled softly, and closed the gap between them, pressing a gentle kiss to Charlie’s lips.
“…No yeah, that’s fine,” he said, sounding bewildered.
Maybe Potter understood more than he thought he did.
“You know I get that. I understand, to a degree.”
“Oh. Why not?”
“Maybe.”
Charlie flushed a little and rubbed the back of his neck. “Well….”
Charlie gave him another look, and sighed. “Fine. I’ll drop it.”
Draco couldn’t stop the bitter laugh that escaped him. “You could say that.”
Malfoy nodded, and began to stand up and walk away, until Charlie caught his wrist. “Hey.” He looked up at the blonde fondly, obviously trying to give him some form of comfort, then pulled him down gently into a tender kiss before letting him go.
“Five years, Draco. It will have been five years.”
Draco was folding a shirt when a gentle knock came from the bedroom door, and he heard it creak open.
This chapter is pretty short and sweet, the plot will pick up a bit soon!
He had no idea how Potter came to be in possession of such a house. It was obviously a magical one, very large and quite heavily warded. It probably came from an old and respected pureblood family, but who? And why did he have it now?
She chuckled. “True. So, what do you know about the guy?”
Malfoy looked up at Charlie and hummed through a small smile. “That sounds nice. Have anywhere in mind?”
That was fine. Right?
“Malfoy, stop it. What are you talking about?”
Charlie nodded. “Nice.”
His friends barely got the time to shout their goodbyes before he had slammed out the door, hands shaking.
Draco Malfoy was going to be sleeping in his godfather’s brother’s bed, using his bathroom, eating his food, kissing his brother. Gross.
“So, what’s the plan for while we’re here?”
Draco shuddered, but pulled Charlie up again, and pressed their lips together gently before pulling away and cupping his cheek.
“And yet you settled for me.”
“She’s with Remus, her husband. In the Lupin family plot. In Wales. Lyall and Hope, his parents are buried there too.”
Harry chewed his eggs slowly and swallowed. He stared at Hermione and then closed his eyes for a moment. “What kind of a list?”
Harry had never liked that word. It never sat well for them, because it had never meant anything
“Okay.” Malfoy paused for only a moment and then sat beside Harry. He left a respectful distance at first and then appeared to think better of it, scooting over just slightly. Harry felt the warmth of his body and leaned towards it.
“Talk about it?” Harry repeated, like an idiot. He stared at his mug. “Do I not seem happy?” The idea that he didn’t seem happy was ridiculous to him.
Ron gasped. “He insults our honour!”
“It wasn’t that bad, I guess.” And then, amending grudgingly: “It was very awkward. And Malfoy didn’t talk at all basically when we were all in the same room.”
Harry laughed. “Maybe I am?”
“Harry, you know I don’t want to harp on —”
“Why not?” Malfoy’s eyes were still bright and he was smiling, a cruel twist to his mouth. “We could become confidantes. Wouldn’t that be the story of a millennium?”
“Draco,” he said firmly, “don’t talk to me like that. I do know. You think you’re the only one here whose mind fucks off sometimes?”
Harry leaned back in his chair and listened to his friends bicker amongst themselves. He heard Hermione tell Ron that that wasn’t a good enough time frame but he also barely heard it. The words hit him and then fell away. Draco had written to Ron and Hermione and had barely mentioned it. If he scanned back, he could remember Draco assuring him that he’d reached out but there had been no mention of
The next day was miserable and filled with Ron’s impression of Harry stumbling down the lane of Malfoy Manor and tripping over his own feet several times. Harry groaned and blushed and tried to drown everything he didn’t like by eating bacon and drinking several gallons of water.
“You’re damn right I am,” he said and leaned over the counter, tugging lightly at the end of one of Hermione’s braids. She looked up and her face brightened; Harry turned his head so he didn’t feel like some kind of awkward spy watching his friends kiss.
Harry nodded and started to walk back down the lane. Malfoy hesitated and then began to follow. “Okay, I won’t compliment you. I just want to say sorry, though. I know I was being a bit of a bellend.”
“I’m reading,” Malfoy said, finally. “It’s not about potions. I can describe it to you.”
Once they were seated, it couldn’t have been more than ten minutes before Draco Malfoy was brought into the court. Harry sat beside Ron, deliberately only looking forward. He could feel heavy stares and an artist appeared to be drawing pictures in the corner: he told himself that it didn’t matter if a portrait of him ended up in the morning paper. What mattered was that Malfoy was being led out, looking thinner than the last time Harry had seen him and somehow taller. Always pale, he looked even whiter, a shade off a ghost as he was led to his seat by his guards. Malfoy barely looked around him, but he didn’t look nervous. He looked quiet, private, too tired to be haughty.
Harry took a breath to try to get a handle on his own irritation. “I’m getting there,” he snapped. Malfoy sniffed and knocked against him sharply, digging his elbow into Harry’s side. Harry did the same back and they tussled for a moment, both irritable and somehow both of them started to smile. Harry laughed and then shoved at Malfoy. He stumbled and then righted himself, giving Harry a dark look as he pulled at his coat.
“So a BLT?”
From the look on her face, Harry almost wished he hadn’t asked but two seconds later and she was raising her hands to twist at her hair. “Oh, I don’t know! You hear such awful stories about custody these days. Or all days, but I’ve been reading about it so it seems more prevalent right now.”
bit contrite but no more, then this whole thing can be a little bit over.”
“Master Malfoy is in the piano room,” Blighter said to Harry two days later as Harry toed off his sodden trainers. Harry blinked at the house elf, who had started to walk away as if that was the natural end of the conversation.
“Don’t tell us if you got laid,” Ron said, with a gleam in his eye.
“I’m not making an arse of myself.”
Harry stood still for a long moment. Malfoy’s fingers were still curled around his hip and neither of them moved. Harry felt the burn of Malfoy’s touch, the heat of his breath, the tightness of his own chest. His eyes fluttered closed and he took a breath, trying to centre himself, trying to push the part of him that craved a fight away. Malfoy’s fingers smoothed over his hip bone a few times, drawing a circle. Harry tried to breathe in time with Malfoy.
“I love Christmas as much as the next person,” Ron said, standing in front of the shop display with a wrinkled nose, “but I just don’t understand how they already have this much
Harry laughed. “Okay go right in then.” Yolanda trotted along beside him but when Harry nodded at her she took off, bounding across the grass. She headed straight for an area where Harry knew plenty of flowers had been blooming a few short months ago. Harry hoped she didn’t dig any of them up. “I thought it was — weird. I felt weird.”
that the walls seemed to press in close. Somehow, the room contained a large corner sofa, two huge armchairs and a pouffe. There was a coffee table brimming with stuff, an apothecary sideboard and a piano shoved in one corner. Along the other walls there were bookshelves which held not only books but trailing plants and knick knacks, souvenirs of places around the world, and globes. There were scrolls and on one wall was a huge map of the world, surrounded by postcards. Above the fireplace was a huge brass mirror and the mantelpiece and around the fire itself were covered in candles and tealight holders.
“Well, I don’t love it either!” Ron said. “But I will. Because you’re Harry, and I’m Ron, and  you’re important to me and I want to be here for you.”
“Whatever. I meant it. Whatever you were gonna say, just don’t do it until you’ve thought about it and you decide whether you really mean it.”
“I’m going to lay waste to you,” Draco shouted over his shoulder. “You’re going to beg me for mercy. You’re going to be so thoroughly embarrassed that you won’t be able to show your face in public for over a fortnight and when you do you’re still going to look sheepish and the Prophet will write about it and I’ll save the article because it will bring me great joy until my dying day.”
Draco sniffed. “No.”
Ron’s grin was huge. “How did you know?”
Harry made solemn eye contact with Malfoy. “Yes, I accept your gratitude and will bear this nobly, as I bear everything.”
Harry’s heart stuttered. He looked at the greenery and said, “I really like lilies.”
” Malfoy sounded disgusted. “It’s a figure of speech. Go find Mother yourself, I’ve things to attend to.” Malfoy immediately took off now they had reached the top of the lane, through the front door and heading down one of the corridors without looking back. Harry hesitated for a moment: he wanted to know what was down that corridor, he wanted to follow Malfoy and find out who was visiting, he wanted to know why he looked like a pirate.
“Yes, and I look terrifying, I know.” Harry heaved a sigh.
It cheered Harry up to see and he reached forward, deliberately picking the one that Malfoy had graced with the full force of his glare. This seemed to startle Malfoy, who briefly looked up at Harry, and then transferred his glare to a different macaroon. Unable to stop himself from grinning at it (it was just so
He sat at the desk and took out a pen, pulling a notepad towards him and writing.
Malfoy pulled a face. “That sounds like an unrealistic ask. Are you coming in or are you just going to stand there, like a completely gormless boor?”
Hermione paused in the arduous task of picking a large gold quill or a small bronze one and looked at him. Her eyebrows lifted. “I think you can be anything at all, Harry,” she said, but when Harry frowned she quickly added, “I’m serious! But I’ve never thought about you being a healer before.”
“‘Course, Malfoy,” Harry said, still just as cheerful, and he started to walk to the study by himself. He heard Malfoy muttering behind him and that absolutely wonderful sound carried him through the rest of the afternoon and into the next day on a high.
Harry stared at his bent back and then swallowed. He shrugged, even though Malfoy couldn’t see him. “Could you not just have said that?”
Ron nodded. Harry watched him look at Hermione, the fond light in his eyes, the slightly bemused expression on his face and, over everything, an affection which shone out of him. His chest twisted and he had to look away, look down at his sandwich, at the large bite mark he had left in the bread. He was here, eating a sandwich, with his best friends, knowing that they loved each other and listening to Hermione talk about Wizengamot members with a passion which could warm anyone. It was close enough to normal that he had to fight not to beam, because then he would have had to explain it, and he didn’t know if he had the words for it. He didn’t know if it would make sense to detail all the ways he was glad to be there, even though the bench was hard and uncomfortable to sit on and the bread was a little soggy and he had hated testifying and his shirt was sticking to him with sweat.
Malfoy was silent for a moment. Harry hated the silence. He twisted in it, chafed at it, thought desperately about disturbing it again and then Malfoy said, “That was surprisingly astute of you, Potter.”
It was really icing on the cake that Harry had arranged another meeting at Malfoy Manor for the day after his argument with Ginny. He hadn’t told Hermione about it when he got home, instead fixing himself a massive mug of tea, and retreating to the spare room which had become his. He stayed in bed for most of the night, slinking down into the kitchen only to fix himself some toast that he burned because he wasn’t paying attention. The fight had felt like a break up, rending both of them even further apart, and Harry thought the appropriate reaction was to lie in bed, half-dressed, staring at the ceiling.
“Potter, if I have to listen to you complain for even five more minutes I am going to steal your wand, okay?” Malfoy leaned closer so that his face was directly in Harry’s line of view and he couldn’t focus on anything else but it’s sharp lines and points. He waited until Harry made eye contact and then Malfoy made a satisfied noise and started to talk again. “I am going to steal your wand and I will kill myself with it. I will murder myself and it will be so messy and you will definitely get arrested for it and all the evidence will stack up against you and you will go to prison. All of that, simply for not being able to be quiet for ten fucking minutes. It would be a shame, for yourself, and a shame for me. You understand?”
“It’s what she said.”
Harry kicked his feet out at the leaves. One of them flew up and then settled on the white at the toes of his trainers. He looked at it intently. “Maybe I just like what I have now,” he said, quietly. “I like living sort of with the two of you. It feels like home. Not quite like Hogwarts, but pretty much as good as it gets for me. And I like — I like going to the Malfoy’s, I guess. I think I don’t mind him now, really.”
Draco blinked at him in surprise. “Obviously.”
Malfoy scowled. “It
, Potter, I can see that. I want to know what you think you’re doing.” Malfoy’s volume decreased the closer he got, as if he was vaguely aware it wasn’t appropriate to scream in Harry’s face. It didn’t stop him from shouting but at least it wasn’t the full explosion Harry had been half-dreading.
His walk up the drive was slower and he had his hands deep in his pockets. A part of him knew it wasn’t quite spring yet — “February isn’t spring,” Hermione had said and ignored all of his arguments that the Natural Order of Things was incorrect and Harry was right with his deep-seated belief (supported by Ron) that spring started once January ended. A part of him knew that but the sun seemed brighter, the days were lengthening, and it was nearly March anyway. When he looked out over the grounds he could see the signs of life restarting and, round one corner, he saw Narcissa staring thoughtfully at what had been a rose garden.
Harry turned his head to look at Malfoy, so he saw the way Malfoy’s eyes glittered when he spoke. “I don’t know, Potter, but you deliberately ignored my request to stay away, so I figure I’ll return the favour and ignore everything you say.”
He had always paid a ridiculous amount of attention to Draco Malfoy, Harry knew, but this was something different.
Draco fell asleep before he finished the second page.
“Harry,” Ginny said finally, drawing her hands away from her face and peering at him, “why aren’t you trying to help me? Or trying to tell me what you think I should do? Why aren’t you doing
Malfoy had made an attempt at clearing some of the larger gardens but it was half-hearted at best. Harry never saw him do it and no one ever spoke of it. The gardens simply
They were a unit, complete and full of love.
“You are not getting past me.”
Ginny snorted. “No, it is true and I think that. Every time I try to help Mum or talk to her she just cries, you know? And I feel
it. You’re meant to leave us alone.”
“You hardly talk about things, Potter. It’s your least favourite activity, talking about emotions. It probably ranks down below getting flayed, but above being cannibalised.”
“I’m not hungry. I was thinking. You might want to try it a time or two.” Harry turned his back to start the kettle boiling; when he turned around again Malfoy had tugged the sleeves of his jumper back down to his wrists. Harry looked at him and Malfoy stared back, face only slightly flushed, meeting his gaze straight on. “Potter, for the love of Merlin, can we please skip lengthy discussions today? I’m very busy.”
“I’ll stay with you,” Harry told Draco. “I’ll stay with you if it’ll help you sleep. I’ll read to you. Do you remember when you did that for me?”
Harry turned his head, catching Hermione’s eye and then Ron’s. “Not really,” he said slowly. “He’s not bewitched me, if that’s what you mean. I’d think that’s a bit of a ridiculous suggestion considering I’ve been able to throw off an Imperius for a good number of years now.”
wasn’t going to happen and life went on.
“Do you mean it?” he demanded. He looked imperious but Harry thought it was a trick of the light. He could see the hope and the anxiety warring in him.
“It’s Tesco. It’s not important.” He wanted to wave one hand dismissively and started to, only to realise it was squashed under his thigh. Instead, he half-shrugged and tried not to think about how ridiculous it probably looked. “I think that this’ll all be way more comfortable for both of us if we don’t have to keep talking about gratitude, though.”
Again, there was a pause. This one was slightly more pointed. Harry didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy, checking the corner of his mouth for a curl of distaste, tracking his expression. There was none forthcoming. Malfoy only continued to stare at Harry in confusion and then he looked down at the piano again. “It’s a stage name,” Malfoy said. “She was a wonderful pianist. My parents hired her to play at their wedding.”
“You’re filthy,” Malfoy announced one afternoon, meeting Harry at the gate. Harry was filthy: restlessness had settled under his skin, an itch that never seemed to abate, and he had taken Yolanda (Mrs Ormsby’s German shepherd) and went for a run in the countryside, not caring that it was raining or that the muck he kicked up as he ran covered him. He had bathed Yolanda, but hadn’t done the same for himself.
It apparently made Ron decide that something was really wrong.
Seemingly content with having enough pasta in the pot to feed a small army, Ron set down the bag and turned. His face was a picture: pinched and wary and earnest all at once. His eyebrows were drawn down but it was clear he was trying to smile and look encouraging. All together, it kind of made him look like he really needed to take a dump. “Well, you know,” Ron said, waving a hand. “After the — after.”
“You are
“Only to you, Potter. I’d make no such promises in a more general sense.” Malfoy looked extraordinarily pleased with himself. He lifted a hand to smooth over his hair, tucking it behind his ears as he looked around the kitchen and then back to Harry. “Potter, I don’t know why you’re stressing about this. It’s ridiculous. Everyone has known you wanted to be an Auror for years. Frankly, I’m sick of hearing it. You already know what you’re going to do anyway, don’t you? When you really think about it.”
“Do you know what?” Malfoy said, panting, gasping, his voice shaking with every word. “I think you can call me Draco.”
It was a criticism said softly, though it felt as sharp as the wind. Harry sucked in a breath and then took a sip from his tin. “I don’t know what I want to do with the place.”
Instead, Harry took another bite of his sandwich and listened to Ron tell Hermione that her new found knowledge of the Wizengamot was frightening. It went on for several minutes, gentle bickering which Harry half listened to as he finished his sandwich and then stole a drink from the bottle of water Ron had brought along.
“You were.”
“Not good enough!” Hermione declared, shaking her head. She came to stand beside Harry and looked down at the shakshouka that he was making. Patting his arm, she said, “Oh this looks delicious, Harry.”
Malfoy exhaled, the kind of breath which let tension leave his body. Harry watched his shoulders with interest as Malfoy rolled them. “Brilliant. That’s perfect. Now, if you could agree to stop visiting just to annoy me that would be wonderful. I think it makes my mother sad.”
“You would be a terrible spy,” Harry said, finally. “Did anyone ever tell you that?”
“You’re going to go,” she said. There was no hint of a question in her voice.
Harry wasn’t sure what they were doing until Ron said, loudly, “You see now how the strange creature, Harrifucus Potterus, cannot seem to hold a note but how that doesn’t bother him. It actually acts as a defence mechanism.”
Surprised, Harry said, “Happy Christmas, Blighter.”
Harry shifted his gaze to the letter in front of him. He recognised the handwriting from last time, ornate but precise. He reached for it, turning the envelope over and easing it out.
Squinting blearily at the words, Harry read them and then sat up straight, shock forcing him into alertness. Staring down at Draco’s crisp, fancy handwriting, he reread it again.
Harry ran a hand through his hair and stared at Hermione. “You knew Malfoy was going to do that?”
The museum morphed into an art gallery somehow and then dinner, the three of them tucked into the corner of a pub, wolfing down pies.
It was not the right thing to say. Harry saw the moment Malfoy’s face froze, the blank look that slotted onto his face. It was only once it was there that Harry realised how animated Malfoy had looked only moments before. He cleared his throat and said, “Your mum was telling me there’s ghosts here.”
It was a good question. Surely, that meant that Harry should have expected it, should have some answer prepared. When Malfoy turned to look at him, Harry found that every word seemed to evaporate immediately. His mind was empty, blank, his throat closed over. There were a hundred reasons that he was there and in the moment when Malfoy looked at him with huge, beseeching eyes, Harry couldn’t even think of one.
“What on earth are you talking about? Malfoy, if I was going to regret it I would have done that already. Now’s not any different.”
Harry blinked at both of them. “Have you lost it?”
Harry was quiet for a second and then nodded. “I’ve heard kicking a gate is good for temper control.”
“Are you good now?” he asked, twining their fingers together.
“At the beginning,” Hermione said, managing to sound prim despite the fact she was in her pyjamas and it was before eight in the morning. “So, we want to look at where you are versus where you could be. Or where you have your offers to be, of course. We’ll put as much data on the list as possible and we can work from there.”
“I just felt it.” Harry took the sandwich, carefully unwrapping it as they walked down the corridor towards one of the benches in an alcove. Hermione tucked herself into Ron’s side as they sat, quiet for a long minute as everyone started to eat.
“Hmm. I suppose so.” Harry fell silent and leaned his shoulder against Malfoy’s. Malfoy hesitated for a second and then relaxed, leaning into Harry, neither of them speaking for a moment. Harry resisted the urge to run a hand through his hair, or worry at his bottom lip, or bite his nails, or reach for Malfoy and see if he wanted to start kissing again. He resisted the urge to do anything but stay completely still, syncing his breathing with Malfoy’s, listening to the water fall behind them.
“Too bad!” Malfoy sounded cheerful, arms swinging around him. “It’s not like I’ve a lot else to entertain me here.”
“Nonsense. Who am I going to tell if you admit it?”
Harry stood up so fast that he nearly knocked the pot off the ring. He turned to look at Ron with a gaping mouth. “Ron!”
If it was proper fresh air that Malfoy wanted, it was clear that
“Good.” Draco stopped tracing lines on Harry’s palm and instead moved his fingers up, curling them through Harry’s. He stared down at their joined hands and Harry stared at him.
Harry, who rarely got to see Draco shy, smiled at him. “We can figure it out,” he said, watching the light of his eyes, the way the sunlight slithered into the manor, how bright it made everything look. “We have time. Me and you have got a lot of time.”
“I know. But he needs to know that.”
“I’m dead proud of you, mate,” he said gruffly.
“Okay,” Malfoy said finally and then they didn’t talk again for the next ten minutes.
Pulling himself out of bed, Harry considered his course of action as he showered. He would get dressed and make breakfast and think about not going over to the Malfoy’s until it was an acceptable time to visit someone. He would do that.
Harry laughed and grinned and took Draco into his mouth as deeply as he could. When Draco gasped, something thrummed through Harry that he couldn’t name.
“She won’t jump on you,” Harry said. “Nice coat.”
The next morning, Harry pulled himself out of bed, choked down some cereal and went to Mrs Ormsby’s. He barely let himself think about what he was doing, collected the German Shepherd, Yoland, and apparated to the Malfoy’s. He had to delay going up the lane to soothe Yolanda for a moment, stroking behind her ears and murmuring to her. By the time they started to walk up the lane, he knew that Malfoy would be aware Harry was on the property.
“You look better,” she said finally. She studied Harry with interest and a keen eye that had not been dulled by any of the drinks she’d taken that night. “Healthier. Happier.”
Harry stopped to take a breath, trying not to trip over his own tongue, gearing up to start again when Ron stopped him. Ron reached out, clasping Harry’s shoulders and squeezing and Harry looked up into his friend’s face, nervous about what he would see there. He expected to see disappointment; instead Ron just looked vaguely sad. “Harry,” he said, gentle again. “Mate. I would never, ever ask you to do that for me. I don’t even want you to want to do that for me. It’s kind of nice and all, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t want you to be mildly miserable all the time just to make me happy.”
said, “It’s a great idea I had, huh?”
Harry shot him a grin and then said, “Well, thanks. You know. For trying. I appreciate that.”
“Other than come here.” Malfoy didn’t sound bitter but his fingers were white around his mug.
“Habit,” he murmured, when she gave him a look. She shrugged and then disappeared into one of the rooms: Harry followed her. It was a living room. He couldn’t tell if it was small or if it was just so filled with
“We should go to bed.”
Harry screwed up his face. “So you’re here to watch me?”
Opening his mouth, Harry heard himself say, “Ron threw me a job fair.”
Malfoy, who waited to ensure he was following and then walked in front of Harry.
“Who’s it from?” Ginny asked, leaning forward to peer at the letter.
“I’m not good at taking care of people.” Ginny sat up then, a sharp, energetic movement. She flung her legs around and was perching on the side of the bed, leaning forward towards Harry. “I know everyone thinks I should be — I’m a Weasley! There’s so many of us, surely we can look after each other? — but I’m just not. I never know what to say or what to do. Dad’s so much better at it than me.
Harry tried not to let his spine stiffen in annoyance. He had hurt Malfoy, which anyone with eyes could see, and Malfoy deserved to take some shots at him. Harry couldn’t plaster over this wound easily because he still didn’t understand how to be someone who knew what to do with their feelings.
“Oh my god,” Ron said faintly. He closed his eyes, looking pained. “Oh this is even worse. I thought — I thought if he didn’t drug you, maybe that’s why you’re all…” Trailing off, Ron kept flapping his hands around. He was honestly well on his way to taking flight at this rate.
“We’re adults, Charlie. We have, hgh- responsibilities.”
“I’m sure she could wait a day,” he mumbled, pressing open mouthed kisses down Draco’s neck. “Just phone her for an extension.”
“Just Ted. But, yeah. You two are related, I suppose.”
He cleared his throat. “Well. Tell me about them.”
They sat in silence a while longer before Draco spoke again.
“Theo? You alright?”
Charlie was wrapped around him, warm, heavy and comfortable. Charlie always ran warmer than Draco did, but that was fine. It was nice.
Charlie looked over at him and then tilted his head, letting his eyes focus on a spot on Harry’s chest. “You’ve got…” he pointed.
“He never loved me, I know that now. But as a child, there’s no way to believe that someone who raised you doesn’t love you, at least a little.”
He felt the panic bubble up in his chest again, and squeezed Charlie’s hand tighter, until he almost crushed it, but the man didn’t complain.
Potter’s eyebrows shot up for a second. “Oh. Right. Um. Regulus, he was your mum’s cousin, though Sirius was too I suppose. He was, I think, one of the youngest Death Eaters…of his time at least. At 16.” Draco swallowed hard. “He was the first one to find out about Voldemort’s horcruxes. He helped destroy the first before he died. He was 18.”
He didn’t care.
Charlie’s cabin was small and cozy, much more welcoming than Draco’s dingy flat, which is why they usually didn’t spend much time there, though Charlie swore he loved the place.
Draco’s face fell.
The bed was made, there were guest appropriate books in the bookshelf, the fireplace was crackling away in the corner, and the desk was dusted off, with a bottle of ink and a quill, just in case.
“Maybe not. But it doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be loved. Moving on isn’t impossible. It doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, it means you’re getting past it. You seem to have done a good job of that so far. I get this is throwing you for a loop, but you’ve proved that you’re capable of change.”
“You know what I want to close right now? My eyes. Let me go back to sleep, Charlie. I’ll be here when you get back.”
And so the couple walked the streets of London, Draco smiling smugly, holding a “world’s best mother” mug in his hands, Charlie glaring at him, but without any real malice.
“You ran away, love. Don’t get me wrong, these past few years have been great, but you don’t belong here. Your life is back in England, and you’re going to have to return at some point. It’ll be...a good chance to heal, eh? Just get some closure.”
“Have you lost your damn mind?”
Dean cut in suddenly. “-I really think you should stay away from him, Harry. I mean remember what happened to me during the war? To Lu? To Ted? To so many others? I want you to be safe-“
He had just gotten angry, and he knew he needed to work on that.
He chuckled. “No.” He didn’t think he could if he wanted to. It might not have been the healthiest way to face this, but it was a way. “Think you can get back to sleep now?”
“I’m your insufferable prick. You do realize we have to leave the lobby?”
Draco sighed in marginal relief, and heard ringing in his ears, letting the world fade out around him so he could get his bearings.
I am so sorry y’all, it turns out depressive episode+writer’s block= not good, this is pretty short, but the plot picks up a little soon, and we’ve got some nice twists ahead! Again, thank you so so much for reading, and I appreciate your kudos and comments more than you could know.
“He will.”
“They weren’t…great people. They were very anti-magic and pretty racist, too. I won’t go into detail about my childhood…but I wasn’t exactly loved.”
For all my hardcore drarry fans, I’m sorry, this is pretty slow burn, it won’t happen for a while. For all my Draco/Charlie fans, just know that I am building up the fluff so it’ll hurt worse when they end things. Because I am evil. I have no remorse. Thank you for any and all support and have a great day! <3
“You’re a real person in my life.”
“Hey, I was a Gryffindor!”
He blushed and ducked his head. “You fucking sap.”
It had been a desperate attempt to gain some control, his life spiraling so much that he turned to numbers and calories, and counting, and seeing how little he could eat. It had been one of the reasons he had been so unstable during those few weeks in the hospital after his attempt.
“You did just sleep with Justin Finch-Fletchley.”
Charlie took his hand and squeezed it gently. “Don’t be nervous, you’ll be fine.”
“Charlie, this is your family. These are the real people in your life.”
Draco stopped walking, turned around, and hugged Charlie tight, burying his face into his chest. “Thank you. I love you, you know that?”
Malfoy seemed to give Charlie a look that expressed a “the fuck?” and Charlie smiled, quirking an eyebrow at his brother before leaning up to give his boyfriend a quick kiss. “He’s just admiring the view, babe.”
Harry started to unbutton his shirt and Theo spoke up between breathless kisses. “You got-?”
He did not add on that he was also happy to have Malfoy.
Charlie rubbed a hand over his temples. “Have you ever considered that maybe he’s actually changed, Harry? That you don’t know the whole story?”
“Fucking yeah, Potter! I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t true!”
“God, I knew I shouldn’t have gotten involved with anyone. I should have warned you not to do this with me. It was bound to end up like this.”
Harry met Malfoy’s eyes. Those fucking piercing grey eyes. “How old were you?”
His head throbbed, his eyes burned, his joints ached, and his thoughts were cynical and sluggish.
“Former Death Eater. And I can tell you that you are deserving. Just please, come back to the house. We can debate this in the morning, but I think we all need some time to rest and cool off right now.” He held out his hand, and Draco hesitated to take it, but he did.
He grabbed his phone, stumbled out of his bedroom and wondered why he had thought sleeping with Justin Finch-Fletchley had been a good idea. Not that it hadn’t been enjoyable, but he preferred sex with strangers, as to not make things awkward. This would...definitely be awkward.
“Old school mate, huh?”
Godric, he was in over his head.
Draco turned towards his boyfriend, whose dark green eyes were sleepy, but wide open. He put a hand on the top of his head, stroked it lightly and kissed the fiery curls softly. “I’m sorry, love. Did I wake you?”
“Draco, you have to start building a life for yourself back home. You ran here, and it’s been fun, it’s been a nice break, but this isn’t where you’re supposed to be. Anastasia’s said you have enough experience to start up your own small business. Romania is your safety blanket, but it’s holding you back. We both know you’ll go back eventually, and if you put it off longer, it’s only going to be more difficult.”
“Well tough fucking luck.”
“Spit it out, Charles.”
“I don’t care! I'm not going!”
“So, Draco. I was thinking we could find someplace to go for dinner tonight. We haven’t had a proper date in a long time.”
“Well, I have to get home, Ginny’s expecting me. Here, take some chamomile for the wrackspurts. Hugs?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had never seen him look so incredibly…small.
CW for mentions of past suicide attempt and threat of self harm
“They keep you alive.”
Charlie swatted his hand playfully. “Behave yourself. This is my brother’s home we’re talking about.”
He wasn’t dependable. He couldn’t be trusted to keep a stable job. He was mentally ill for one thing, with nightmares so bad he couldn’t sleep without someone half the time, cue the consistent sleeping around. And some days the thoughts were so bad that someone; usually Hermione or Ron, sometimes Luna, Ginny or Dean would have to come over and sit with him. He was grateful for his friends, but also embarrassed about the days they had to help him eat or shower, stay with him to make sure he didn’t hurt himself. He had tried to join his parents when he was twenty, but Charlie; God, Charlie, had found him with a wand to his head, took it away, and held him while he screamed.
Their arrangement was simple. Sex; and quite a lot of it honestly, drinks, and the occasional day spent with each other, know what topics are on and off limits. It was a bit strange he supposed, they were more distant than most couples, not as tightly woven as you’re supposed to be when you’ve been together for that long.
“Hey, Justin. Sorry about that, my brother called. Do you want breakfast? I’ve got a hangover potion, too.”
“It’s fine, Charlie. What do you need?”
“There are just...a lot of them. And it’s embroidered on everything.”
“There’s a pretty good Italian place a couple blocks from here. I’ll give you the address.”
“Shit happened in this whole house, Hermione. It’s fine. Regulus’ ghost isn’t going to haunt him or anything. This is one of the only rooms in the house I’m pretty sure incest hasn’t  occurred in recently. So, good guest room.”
“Charlie, I’m not. I’m 22, I haven’t figured out my life yet, my mental health is kind of a mess, and as we’ve just discovered; I’m a former Death Eater!”
For several seconds Draco simply stared at Charlie, eyes wide, mouth hung open.
Draco just turned away.
Draco turned back towards him and gave him a strained smile. “That’ll be nice, Char-“
Charlie had barely even been in Britain at the time. He didn’t understand.
“Ok, Draco. I can’t force you.”
Having a stranger stay with him for two weeks was the last way he wanted to spend the next two weeks, but he couldn’t leave Charlie hanging like that. The man had done him many a favor over the years, from helping sneak his hookups out of the house when he forgot Molly was visiting to holding him while he sobbed uncontrollably, waves of grief hitting him when he least expected it.
“So what if I am? Have to live up to my promises, you know.”
Draco was standing next to Potter, staring at two small and simple headstones.
They collapsed on top of each other, Harry straddling Theo’s thighs and leaning in to kiss him again.
Charlie whispered into his ear. “I’m sorry about all of this, love. Really.”
Harry gave a small smile and chuckled softly.
Harry paused for a moment before speaking again.
“Hey, stranger.”
They stared at each other for several more seconds.
A half an hour later, Draco stood in his living room next to Charlie, his heart beating out of his chest. Charlie guided his hand to hold onto the mint tin as it started to glow and count down.
“Your general instability can be a bit concerning, Harry. But you’re a wonderful host, any former house guest of yours can speak to that, including myself. Besides, you’ve said it yourself, you’re probably going to stay out of each other’s way, he’ll spend most of his time with Charlie, anyway.”
Fifteen minutes later found Harry standing over the stove, staring at a pan of scrambled eggs. He emptied them onto two plates, followed by (only slightly burnt) toast and two cups of tea.
“Please, your father catered to your every whim, don’t think I didn’t see it. You came to school so fucking arrogant and full of yourself. How could you possibly get it?”
And Draco knew that he would be. His mother had kept his name out of the papers after the war, he wasn’t famous for his crimes, the only ones who knew were the ones who saw it happen, and that wasn’t Charlie’s family. Probably.
Hi loves! I know my posting schedule is a little erratic at the moment, but I am a full time student, so I have less time to write during the week than I do on weekends. Though I will be bored out of my mind on a road trip for Memorial Day weekend, so expect one or two chapters out! I love you all, thank you all much for the support! <3
“Look, he’s had time to cool off, so I’m going to go find him. Just...be nice when we get back.”
“It’s ok, Harry. Really, that’s what I was thinking. Don’t worry, I’ll be out of your hair in a bit.”
“It didn’t make up for it, Potter. It didn’t make up for the beatings, or the curses. It didn’t make up for the days I was left alone without food or water, or the fire pokers on my back. It didn’t make up for when I was forced into getting that mark on my arm, it didn’t make up for the times I was thrown in a locked room with Greyback and he-“ his voice cracked then. “-he did what he wanted with me.”
He could talk to Kreacher. Who was he kidding? He wasn’t going to talk to Kreacher.
Charlie tilted his head and stared into Draco’s stormy grey eyes further. “You know it’s going to be ok, right, my love? Because it is. You’ll be just fine, you know. And I’ll stay right here while you still need me.”
Harry sighed. “Kreacher?”
Luna nodded. “Oh, yes. He seems to be doing better nowadays. He says Romania has been good for him, though he never mentioned Charlie. He’s doing a wandmaking apprenticeship, you know.”
Brother, son, and friend
Charlie seemed to be eyeing Malfoy, watching him eat, but his gaze was soft and caring. Malfoy picked at his food with his fork, and only took a bite after Charlie nudged him. Was Kreacher’s cooking really that bad? Harry would ask the elf later.
It was late April, but London was still quite cold and dreary, as it was known for being.
“You’ve never found a dragon that was beyond saving?”
“Not now, mo ghràdh. Have patience,” he whispered across Draco’s lips, holding the back of his neck, foreheads pressed together.
Harry smiled weakly. “Ok, that sounds good.”
Luna sighed airily, looking across the room. You learned very quickly being Luna Lovegood’s friend that just because she looked like she wasn’t listening didn’t mean she wasn’t. In fact, she was listening almost all of the time, even when you didn’t want her to, she just wasn’t all that great at eye contact. And that was fine, her real friends didn’t care about things like that.
To be honest, Harry’s life was quite a mess. He hated being a celebrity, but after 2 years of pretty much hiding out in his Fideliused house, the Prophet mostly left him alone, with only the occasional completely ridiculous story about him.
“He’s not staying in my house, Charlie!”
Regulus Arcturus Black
He looked back at the fireplace, ran a hand over his face, and pulled his phone back out to dial a number.
“Morning, mhuirnín.”
“But that’s the fun of being adults, isn’t it? No one’s ordering us around like schoolchildren. We can do what we want.”
The blonde looked up, surprised. “I’ve been in Romania. With Charlie. Since I was nineteen.”
“Yeah. Yeah, you too, Harry.”
“That clears up nothing for me. I’m going to need you to elaborate.”
Harry paled at that, his throat feeling dry. He had nearly forgotten about the Sectumsempra incident, and he did feel bad about that. As much as he hated Malfoy, he hadn’t wanted to kill him.
Charlie gave him a warm smile, then got out of bed, still in only his boxers, and grabbed his flip phone.
He didn’t want to.
“That’s unlikely, we’ll stay out of the way. And even if it happens, we’ll deal with it as we go along. I promise you’ll come out the other side in the next couple hours.”
And then, just as he was thinking that things couldn’t possibly get worse, of course, Kreacher walked in, I’m his ratty old tea towel.
But it would never be over.
He was exhausted, and after Malfoy’s little display right before his speech - though he didn’t think a lot of people noticed that - he just wanted to curl up at home. But Malfoy and Charlie were probably there by now, so he settled for finding Ron and Hermione.
I know I wasn’t supposed to know any of this. And I’m sorry to violate you like this. I know that’s part of the reason why you moved away in the first place. But I love you, ok? And you’re going to get through this, one way or another. And I’ll be right here. I’m not going anywhere. I love you, and I’m not leaving. I need you to know that before we can start to fix this. Do you understand?”
And Draco even started to believe it.
Draco was tempted to ask him to stay forever. He wished he could. Wished he had the strength to. Because he knew Charlie would say yes. But he also knew he couldn’t. He would be with Charlie for as long as he could, but that wasn’t forever. Charlie was right. He needed to move on, and Charlie wouldn’t go with him.
“What do you possibly have to be afraid of?”
“His grandmother. Your Aunt Andromeda. She’s looked after him since he was a baby, though he’s growing up to be a happy little boy.”
A cheery voice boomed from the other end of the line. “Hey, Harry! How’ve you been? I haven’t talked to you in ages!”
Getting ready.
He knew they probably wouldn’t get home for several more hours, and wondered what to do.
Afterwards, it was quiet. Theo didn’t snore, didn’t move, or talk in his sleep, didn’t seem to dream much. He just curled into Harry’s arm and breathed in and out deeply. In and out. In and out. Harry listened to him breathe until he drifted off to sleep. And it sank in that he wasn’t happy. Not the way that Draco and Charlie were. And not even the way that Neville was by himself.
Harry did not like how it turned out. In fact, he wasn’t even finished. He had a pretty shitty, half complete rough draft done, but he didn’t need another scolding like the one he got from Hermione the other day for not finishing it.
And for another thing, he didn’t think he wanted to see them either. Well, maybe his mother. And Dinsy, one of his childhood house elves. But not his father, and certainly not the manor. Even the thought made him want to throw up.
Not going to lie, this chapter was little tedious to write, but I promise the plot will pick up soon. Thank you for any and all support!
Hermione sighed and shook her head. “Do you know when they’re supposed to get here?”
“Yeah, oh my god. It’s nice to see you, what have you been up to?”
He wondered what they had spent the past three years doing together. What kind of sick mask has Malfoy put up to make Charlie like him? To make Charlie trust him? What was he doing in Romania anyway? How come Charlie had never talked about him before? Was it something he did? Because if Malfoy was hurting Charlie, Harry would kill him personally. He would poke around about it.
He had thought he owed it to himself to learn to love the person he was. But, maybe he didn’t.
“He’s five now, huh? Is he…?”
“I really don’t-“
“I’m proud of you.” He reached out his hand to hold Draco’s. It was warm and familiar. It felt like home.
“Fine.”
“But still, I mean it must feel wrong,” Ron remarked.
“And I know we’ve all drilled you about going to a mind healer before, Harry. But I believe it would be very useful. My mind healer Cynthia has helped me through so much. It’s scary, and it’s hard work, but it might help you actually solve the root of these issues.”
They walked down the street for a whole longer, until Charlie paused in front of number 11. Draco noticed the house numbers skipped straight to 13.
And god, he could do this forever. If he had to spend the rest of his life hung against the familiar planes of Charlie’s body, taking in his soft warmth, he wouldn’t mind. He might like nothing more, in fact.
Hi loves!
“Who has him, if not you?”
“Hey Charlie, do you by any chance happen to know the use of a silencing charm? Really helpful little buggers that keep your brother from hearing you fuck his childhood enemy.”
He thought about the room that he had spent so long making up just a few hours prior, for this mysterious guest, who must be pretty great for Charlie to bring him home. He wished he had gotten it ready with a little less care, now. But he wouldn’t go back and mess it up on purpose. That would just be rude.
“I don’t want to talk.”
He had kind of planned his whole day around this, and most of the people close to him were already at the Burrow, somewhere he definitely did not want to be today.
He spoke up once he felt he had pulled himself together enough. “Do you want to look around a bit more? I saw a row of nice looking shops just around the corner.”
He realized it had probably been a while since he had spoken. He wasn’t sure he could.
“Well...we didn’t exactly like each other much during our Hogwarts days.”
“He already left, you should probably get going.”
“You don’t even have to meet my family or anything like that, ok? My foster brother has a house in London that I’m sure you’d be welcome to stay in. Merlin knows I spend half my time there when I’m back home, if only to get away from my mother.”
Potter walked out the door, slowly and awkwardly, and Draco was left by himself.
“What’re you doing reading that rubbish?”
“I ran. I mean, I was running. With Yolanda. We went out and then I gave her a bath and now I’m here.”
“Please stop talking so dirty, Potter, these portraits can’t bear it.” Malfoy turned a beaming look onto some of the paintings around them, mostly filled with old Malfoy relatives. For the most part, they looked supremely unconcerned with the conversation happening around them. The only one paying attention was a man, mostly bald and very large, wearing a pink coat, surrounded by hounds.
Harry’s mouth curled into a smile, almost a secret, tucked away at the edges. “Yeah. Yeah I think so too.”
Malfoy continued to look at Harry oddly. They stared at each other and then Malfoy said slowly, “That’s not what I meant at all. You idiot. I wish I could tell you not to come inside looking like that but I know you’ll ignore me, so how about you shower instead?”
Draco blinked at him several times, astonishment shining from his face. He stared at Harry, clearly searching for something although Harry wasn’t sure what. He just knew that Draco clearly must have decided he found it, because finally he swallowed and raised his own hands to cover Harry’s. “I don’t think that’s very appropriate,” he said, softly. “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, Harry.”
Harry smiled, small, mischievous and unrepentant. He shrugged. “I’m talking about talking. Trying to be better at it. Thought I should maybe be a bit more forthcoming.”
“Go on. Tell the truth.”
Hermione made a noise of agreement. “And then they have to have different representatives. They can’t just rely on one.”
“I’ve been thinking about trying to tidy this place a bit,” Malfoy said, cutting into the silence. He sounded dreamy. “I never really liked gardening. I didn’t have the patience for it and it was always Mother’s forte, but she doesn’t always love to come out here now. I would hesitate to tell you why.”
that Harry would have called it avoiding. He had woken up in Malfoy’s bed on the first of November, morning sun crawling through a gap in the curtains. Malfoy had been asleep beside him, face pressed almost fully into the pillow near Harry’s head, one arm loosely thrown over Harry’s chest. Harry couldn’t remember when he had fallen asleep or if Malfoy had tried to rouse him. He was still half-propped up against the headboard with a crick in his neck from the position. Malfoy’s hair had fanned out on the pillow around him, pale and bright. He had been barely awake and reached for it, running his fingers through Malfoy’s hair and trying to will sleep away from him.
“They can afford it,” Ron said, only a hint of bitterness sweeping into his tone.
Ron’s head whipped around in alarm and he looked at her with despair. “Hermione, this is no time for jokes. It’s time for a sacred ritual between one man and the food he loves. That he will never, ever tell his mother about.”
This idea had been much better when Harry had come up with it. He realised that fact somewhere between when Malfoy started speaking and when he finished, probably around the exact moment that Harry felt his temper spike. He tried to take a breath and breathe through it — a technique that Hermione had been insisting would help for years — but it didn’t work. Instead, Harry felt himself focus on the irritation even more.
“Don’t mention your mother.”
A smile stole across Malfoy’s face, smug and delighted. “Blighter doesn’t like you and it’s because he’s a good boy, who listens to everything I say. I have said a lot of very negative things about you.”
Malfoy laughed, the sound cruel in the hazy summer afternoon. “You’re one to talk about stalking, Potter. The rest of us — that is my mother and I — are trying to keep ourselves occupied.”
“I’m glad you don’t think I’m stupid,” Malfoy said, voice cool, “but I don’t actually need any external validation, thank you.”
“Of course you do.” They were getting closer to the top of the lane where Malfoy usually disappeared through the front doors and down a hallway, leaving Harry to go upstairs to the study. This time, once they stopped inside the front door and removed their shoes, Malfoy very unsubtly crowded Harry, clearly leading him down one of the hallways. Harry did not debate whether he was going to follow; he just did it, natural as breathing.
They looked at each other, Harry glaring and Malfoy with a light in his eye that Harry didn’t understand until he tilted his head back and laughed. “You always make it too strong,” Malfoy said, moving to gather mugs. “You’re so easy. I knew that would make you decide not to do it.”
Harry watched him for a long time. It wasn’t often that he got to look at Draco like this — Narcissa knew about their relationship, but Harry preferred not to stay the night much. It felt strange to him, for reasons he struggled to explain. Although they slept together there really wasn’t much sleeping
“Do you think she'll find them? That they’ll remember?” Harry asked.
“Whatever, yeah,” Malfoy said, in that sloppy way that told Harry he was losing whatever control he had. He sounded almost desperate as he said, “Do whatever you want.”
Once upon a time, it had been Harry’s most outlandish dream that someone would love him. It had seemed so thoroughly out of his grasp when he was an unwanted orphan, shoved into the cold bosom of a family who hated him. He had been trouble; he had been a freak; he had been the scum on their shoe. He hadn’t known love and he hadn’t known kindness. A part of him had been terrified that he would never know how to give and receive that ever since; on his worst days, he thought that maybe there was something fundamental broken within him. Ron and Hermione had changed him.
“I don’t want to hear it, Malfoy,” Harry warned.
“She’s right, Harry. If you need anything, we’ve got your back.” Ron took another sip of his drink. “But if I go home tomorrow and Ginny’s crying her heart out, you know I’m gonna have to come back here and beat you up.”
“Oi!” Ron looked at them, disbelief on his face. “Do you lot have a breakfast club I’m not being invited too? Because that’s discrimination, that is.”
“I’m not boring, Malfoy. There’s just a lot that needs to be figured out first and it’s not smart to rush into things.”
Nobody moved from the ground for quite some time. When they finally did it was to order a Chinese, which came as they were devising plans. Ron would get the Portkey sorted and Harry had money. Hermione protested and Harry insisted, solemn and serious, and eventually she nodded. They were going to ask a professional to go back to Australia with Hermione and Harry would pay them. The Grangers were going to come home.
It made Harry laugh, but he knew this was serious and he reached out, grabbing onto Draco’s wrist. He held onto the fine bones until Draco looked up properly. Maintaining eye contact, he said, “Tell me why.”
“I don’t,” Harry started and then stopped. His heart was beating in his chest, a hard, steady drumbeat. It felt punishing. He swallowed again and tried to speak once more. “I don’t want to tell you what I want you to do. I want to know what you want to do.”
“No,” Harry told her. “I can’t. I’ve eggs to eat.”
Draco took a deep breath and then looked directly at Harry.
“If you want some help, I can help.”
Hermione laughed; it sounded tired. “I miss you too. I wouldn’t — I wish I could come home.” Her voice sounded small, lost, girlish and young in a way that Harry hated to hear. It reminded him too much of nights spent in a tent. It reminded him too much of death.
. We’d be the same age! If I was a hundred, so would you be!”
Harry laughed. He looked at Malfoy, felt something twist in his chest, a warmth that flooded through him and felt like fondness. “You ramble.”
He followed Draco on soft feet, waited until he was at the corner cauldron and then crowded him into the corner. Draco looked at him in surprise, their eyes meeting properly for the first time since Harry had stepped into the kitchen. Beneath the thunderstorm in them, Harry could see real fear.
Malfoy flushed instantly, skin heating several degrees. “I can’t believe you’re harping on about this again. You get one sum wrong and suddenly everyone’s a critic.”
. Don’t be so ridiculous.”
Harry blinked at it. Unlike the front of the house, this garden had clearly been well cared for. There was a path winding its way towards the centre and the grass was all the same level. Flowers bloomed, a vast array of colours: flowers which looked like large purple balls, huge purple and white daisies, roses in various shades winding their way throughout the garden. In one corner were a group of lilies, clustered around a pond and there was a greenhouse against a wall. There were so many flowers that Harry could not have begun to identify and he stared at it for a second, frozen in surprise. Malfoy either did not notice or did not care. He walked through the garden towards the back wall, where there was a gate. Harry took another minute to stare at the cacophony of colour in front of him and then took off.
“Malfoy, I am.”
George was unpredictable. Harry had arrived at the Weasley home one night three weeks ago, slightly merry from after dinner wine, Ron leaning into his side and George had been in the garden, methodically destroying furniture. Ron had gripped Harry’s arm so hard he had been afraid a bone might snap and they had stood watching for a minute before Harry pulled him forward and they stood, one either side of George, as he finished blowing up a wardrobe.
When she reached for the whiskey again, Harry reached for her wrist. Ginny hesitated and looked up at him, her head tilted to one side. “Harry?”
“You got me there,” Harry said softly. After a moment of hesitation, he grabbed a book off Draco’s bedside chest of drawers and sat on the bed. Draco moved into his side, seeking warmth, folding his limbs around Harry. Harry made room for him and started to read.
,” Harry said immediately, picking up the nearest thing to throw at Ron that he could. Thankfully, it was a spoon and Ron easily ducked out of the way, laughing uproariously. Harry’s laughter joined his moments later.
“You’re not wearing shoes,” he said, dumbly.
Harry turned to Blighter for help, but the house elf simply shrugged and disappeared. He did not like that elf.
“Malfoy, I —”
Harry blinked at Malfoy, before gesturing at the other boy and then back at himself. “Haven’t you?”
She left and Harry looked at Draco, who hadn’t said anything for a while. He was staring at the things on the table. Harry could feel that Draco only seemed to look at him when he looked away, feeling the weight of his wondrous stare like a physical presence.
Quickly catching herself on, her voice sliding back into the affected one she had been using with Ron, Hermione said, “Your punishment shall be it is you who has to clean the bathroom this week. Don’t you agree, Ronald?”
Harry broke the kiss. He had to. Malfoy’s hand had been soaking and drops of water continued to roll down the neck of Harry’s shirt, making him shiver every time. Malfoy chased the shiver, pressing harder into Harry every time, but eventually it became too much. Eventually, Malfoy’s mouth on his became too much, overpowering every one of Harry’s senses and making him feel as if he was losing himself. Drawing back for breath, Harry blinked at Malfoy and then let go of the front of his jumper. It was wrinkled, completely ruined by the grip of Harry’s fist.
Harry hesitated for only a few moments on the lane and then squared his shoulders, walking forward with purpose. The Manor looked different than the first few times he had come. He could see the work that the Malfoy’s were putting into it. The garden was tamer, although he supposed it was winter and therefore easier to tame. Windows that had been broken were mended, curtains were pulled back. Harry’s gaze caught on the warm glow in some of them and a smile flickered across his face.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. Ginny’s eyes were bright and her mouth turned upwards, a hair away from a proper grin, as she looked at him. “On a Wednesday, though?”
Harry pulled a face again, this time at the ground. He looked at his feet and then back up at Malfoy. “I don’t think that’s how it actually is.”
“Yeah, I got it.” His reply was as soft and low as Draco’s question had been. It felt like they were whispering secrets in a crowded room, even though they were the only two on the grounds now. There was no need to whisper. They still did.
Malfoy held up a hand and shook his head. “Potter, if I am going to do this without insulting you greviously then you need to not say such ridiculous things in front of me. Obviously you are having a crisis. I cannot think of any other reason why you are here or why you have been here. You broke up with your girlfriend, you’re consorting with Death Eaters in a house that you no doubt have horrific memories of, and you’re currently seeking career advice from one. That spells crisis. I’ll give you that it’s an unorthodox spelling but I’m fairly sure it’s in a dictionary somewhere.” Malfoy finally lowered his hand. He looked pale and tired and very certain. “You know what you want to do and you’re overthinking it. So why don’t you just do what your heart tells you and stop talking about it? Your voice is getting on my nerves.”
Harry blinked in confusion and looked at Ron who just polished off the last of his bacon and said, “She’s right, Harry.”
annoyed Malfoy was, he was also teasing him. Harry took a breath and only threw his arms up slightly.
“I see,” Malfoy said, finally. “I see.”
Malfoy’s clear but overly fussy handwriting read:
“Hi,” he said, greeting the receptionist with a smile. “My name’s Harry Potter. I’m here for an interview?”
“You must have forgotten you were muttering about it while you were brooding outside my gates,” Malfoy said, airily. He folded his arms and scowled again; it took a moment for Harry to realise it was supposed to be an impression of him, which made him scowl, which made Malfoy smile. Harry’s scowl deepened.
He liked what he was doing. Several of the neighbours had tried to pay him but Harry repeatedly refused. It didn’t seem right, when they were helping him, but very few of them seemed quite content with that. Instead, they plied Harry with gifts that he couldn’t refuse without looking rude: there were teabags and loose leaf teas, hot chocolate, shop bought biscuits, homemade biscuits, sandwiches, leftovers. Harry was drowning in food and brought it all home to a grateful Ron or kept some back, bringing them to Draco. He rarely shared with Narcissa, who had looked extremely confused when he offered her food in her own house.
Draco made a noise like a huff of air or laughter. “You freaked out and ran away afterwards.”
“Or whatever?”
Harry stretched his legs out over the arm of the chair he was on. “Yeah I guess. It was my fault though and I think it’s because — because I never know what to say to him. Or how to do it. Or how to even start.”
Instantly, Malfoy stopped laughing. He pushed himself off from the banister and glared at Harry. “Do you really not understand English? It’s not a good time.”
“I’m not going to embarrass you,” Harry said. “I’m not going to write you a letter either? Don’t be weird. I’m just — I’m just here. I just wanted to sit down.” He licked his lips, tasting Malfoy, watching Malfoy watch the movement. Harry swallowed again. “I didn’t expect that.”
The prosecutor, whose name Harry vaguely thought could have been Brighton but probably wasn’t, smiled at him with no warmth. “Of course, Mr Potter. I asked if you considered it at all odd that, considering the enmity between yourself and the defendant, you find yourself here today, telling everyone assembled that he’s not that bad, really.”
“Like what?”
She turned on her heel and said, “Come in then, Harry.” Harry obeyed, following her into the house, kicking his shoes off at the door.
He shrugged, pulling the sleeves of his jumper down until they covered his hands. “I just thought I should say it.”
Stretching like a cat into the sunlight, he flipped onto his stomach and stared out the window. It was still early but he could hear the faint signs of London stirring outside.
Harry nodded again, because they’d talked about this and he didn’t need Ron to fill in all his sentences to know what he meant. He nodded, because he hadn’t quite known what to say when Ron had admitted that Bill had looked hurt for a brief second, or that Fleur had sworn in French, creatively and at length. Or he had assumed it was creatively but Ron didn’t speak French and couldn’t have said with any degree of certainty. He understood but Harry couldn’t help the whispering part of him that wanted to ask Ron to come anyway.
“So, I’ve been thinking and I think we should make you a list.” Hermione grinned again, setting paper and quills down on the table. “Once you’re finished your breakfast, obviously, or you can just dictate it and I can write it down. Whatever you think is best!”
“Can I maybe not have you then?” Harry started trying to walk. Malfoy had clearly not expected it and he let him pass before making a sputtering noise and matching their steps. “I never placed the order and I’d like to return it.”
Harry was so, so happy to be alive.
“You have selective hearing.”
“Liar,” Harry said and realised he was nearly whispering. “You always want people to be nice to you. You want everyone to think you’re as great as you think you are.”
Harry dropped his backpack onto the floor and smiled at her, transferring his gaze finally to Draco. Draco was still looking at him in shock.
Harry coloured. “I’m excited.”
“Fuck off, you-can-call-me-Harry,” Draco said and then he was pushing Harry’s hand out of the way, hesitating for a moment before his long, cool fingers wrapped around Harry’s cock. There was a moment where Harry glanced up at him, catching his eye. They breathed together and then Draco started to move, a tight grip, a relentless pace. Harry didn’t need much coaxing. He had already been nearly there and Draco’s hand gripping him, chasing him towards orgasm, was almost too much. His eyes fluttered close and he came, spilling over as his hips bucked and he bit his lip hard to try to press down on the noise.
“That’s got to be horrible, mate.”
Hermione looked at her watch quickly.
“Well…”
-N :)
And so there he was, alone in his house that was far too cold and empty and large for one person.
He heard ringing in his ears, and the world faded out around him, any comfort that Charlie offered him completely gone.
He has a huge house, and he never leaves it either. And if you don’t want to be overwhelmed by my parents, you can just visit my brother’s grave with me. I’m sure he’d love to meet you.”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “With potions?”
He did not love it.
“I don’t think it’s particularly odd to dislike someone but think they don’t deserve life in Azkaban, if that’s what you mean.” Harry stared at the prosecutor again, his tone hard when he spoke.
to have tea with my mother? Why are you
It was only then that Ron turned to him, a mostly serious look on his face. “Do you ever wonder why they’re scheduling these two trials for the same day?”
There was a moment when he honestly thought Malfoy would turn around and scream at him then. His back was rigid, the tension in his body unmistakeable, and then it eased somewhat. It did not disappear. “I am saying it. You just never listen to me.”
“You’re not supposed to be a prick for twenty minutes,” Harry reminded, very helpfully.
“Why?”
“I’m walking, Malfoy.”
Malfoy scowled. “Maybe I just wanted you to start talking about how much you hate him.”
“We miss you,” Harry said, after a few minutes of exchanging hellos and questions about the weather and Australia in general. “I think Ron’s ready to build a shrine.”
“I could have been.” Draco was standing straighter, frowning hard at Harry. Harry frowned back at him.
It took longer than Harry expected to help Hermione leave and, at the same time, it came round too quickly. He clutched Ron’s hand as they said goodbye to her and they got drunk that night, so drunk that he couldn’t sit up straight until at least dinner time the next day and the hangover didn’t seem to leave his body for days afterwards. Draco laughed at him but made him tea and fed him toast and petted his hair a time or too. He tried to hide it from Patrick and Betty at work but they both independently teased him about it.
It was a light sentence: house arrest until after Christmas, probation for a few years, a hefty fine. Harry watched Narcissa and remembered how it had felt to be carried through the forest, balling his hands into fists to try and contain everything he felt, to somehow make it more compact. He saw her smile of relief, the exhale she let out as the sentence was read and waited until after to talk to her.
“A lot from the Malfoy’s,” Ron scoffed. “If you take millions off of people who have multi millions, it’s not really a lot.”
is much better at it than me and I just walk around here, doing my best impression of a pixie in an antiques shop.”
Ron shrugged. “Maybe. I hope so.” He chewed on his lip and looked around the small chamber, expression pale and worried. Harry could see the moment Ron decided to let himself slip into a slightly easier conversation. “Though if they come back, it’d probably mean we can’t live there anymore.”
He didn’t have time to do that.
” Malfoy did not stop. “I don’t want you near me.”
Harry smiled. “I don’t need to die. You’re definitely going to tell me in two seconds.”
It never went any further. Harry decided he didn’t mind even when he followed Malfoy’s lips every time he pulled back, even when he arched into him, even when his hands slipped below Malfoy’s shirt and he found skin only for the two of them to break apart shortly after. It was fine. They would need to talk about it to make it go any further and Harry decided
There was a beat and then Draco returned the smile, though it disappeared quickly. He still looked pale, peaky, distracted. Harry tried to think of what to say, but didn’t need to because Draco set his shoulders and said, “I’m just bored. That’s all it is. I’m bored.”
Draco rolled his eyes. He glared at Harry and then glared down at his notes in front of him. “Dares don’t work on everyone, Harry. We’re not all children or Gryffindors or Gryffindors who are
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Yeah, I mean maybe.”
Malfoy stopped and turned. His expression was the picture of distaste. “Aren’t you going to hurry up? You’re late.”
Fourteen had been perfect. Harry had even laughed to himself a little as he sent the owl off and then had to immediately stop because it made him feel a bit like a supervillain. Honestly, it also seemed like less of a laughing matter when he was faced with the very real prospect of making conversation for the next hour at least.
Malfoy had got louder and louder until he nearly shrieked the words at Harry. Harry blinked at him, his mouth open. They both stared at each other, like soldiers on a battlefield. Harry curled his fingers in and then immediately unfurled them: he didn’t want Malfoy to think that he wanted to punch him. He didn’t even want to punch him; he wanted to understand him. He didn’t want to face off against Malfoy like he was on a battlefield, either. He was so tired of war.
Malfoy apparently had been watching Harry carefully. His eyes were bright with something like fever. It lit up his whole face.“Some of the French institutes are filled with huge traditionalists, Potter. The most distasteful thing about me is that I got caught.”
Pouring water into the cups, Ron said, “I don’t see why not. You’re really good with that sort of stuff, mate. And it’d be exciting to work with dragons.”
“What?”
He clearly tried to say it like it didn’t hurt, an attempt at breeziness which fell pitifully and woefully short. Every word was clearly wrenched out of him: Draco looked lost, and young, and furious about it. Harry wanted to hold his hand.
“Potter,  I have a question,” Malfoy said, as Harry crushed up some eye of newt to help him the next time he visited. They were standing close enough to each other that every time Harry shifted his weight onto his other foot their shoulders brushed. Harry couldn’t shake the feeling it was calculated.
“Of course not.” Narcissa kept pulling up weeds. “Do you think that he’s been rather not himself, as of late?”
Harry tried to step forward again. Blighter’s face flashed with anger and he said, “
Malfoy nodded slowly, looking at Harry with a piercing stare for a moment before he glanced down at the dog. Yolanda bounced back and forward from the trees to winding herself around them. Malfoy watched her, shaking his head gently. “Potter, we have known each other for almost half our lives at this point.”
to help.
“Of course it isn’t,” Malfoy said, shifting his weight from one foot to another. “It specifically mentions
“Oh.”
“So you’re telling me,” Malfoy said slowly, “that I’m not special?”
Harry lifted one shoulder. “Maybe,” he said, “but I’d rather have a bit of foolish hope about people, than not.”
“Move,” he said to him in a voice he didn’t recognise as his own, a voice that sounded deeper and more hoarse. Malfoy nodded, scooting the chair back and Harry was in his lap, pressing himself close as Malfoy claimed his mouth again. Malfoy was fire under Harry’s hands, somehow both pale as snow and burning up. Harry wrapped his arms around Malfoy’s neck and moved, lifted himself up a little and then ground down.
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed and he huffed out a laugh. His chest still felt like he was expanding and he tilted his head to brush his lips gently against Draco’s. Draco tried to deepen it, reaching forward to place his hands on Harry’s hips and Harry pulled back. “What if I said,” Harry began slowly, watching Draco’s face carefully, “that I think it’s you? I can feel it. I think you’re there, in my heart.”
If he could survive Voldemort, he could survive an interview. He could impress people. He had probably done it before, sometimes even intentionally. Harry looked for signs of nervousness and then tried not to. It would make him worse.
“I don’t wanna.” Malfoy sounded like a child, a high-pitched whine in his voice, the uncharacteristic word choice making Harry grin. Harry would have bet he was pouting.
“Right,” said Harry, business-like. “Up. Come on, Malfoy. Bed. Up.” He herded Malfoy like a sheepdog, finally depositing him on top of the bed where he sprawled on his stomach, starfishing. Harry looked fondly at him and then turned to call Blighter. Once he had given a very rambling, rather tipsy, but probably fairly clear run down of things he thought Malfoy would want Blighter to know, Harry had to borrow an owl.
Malfoy, who was lounging against the banister at the top of the stairs. Despite his posture, he looked stark and severe, his hair pushed back from his face. He wore a dark suit, which looked black from a distance, and a waistcoat. Harry was fairly sure he still had one of his too-large shirts on underneath, but it was hard to tell. Mostly, Harry found himself watching Malfoy’s face. He looked drawn, and tired, his eyes bright with an emotion Harry couldn’t place. He looked like he definitely did not want to see Harry.
“I could buy us a place.” They walked out of the small room into the larger transportation department, weaving their way in between crowds of people. Most of them were too caught up in their own lives to pay Harry or Ron much attention. “I mean, it’s not really a hassle. Or we could do up Grimmauld properly. I do keep saying I’m gonna.”
“I’ll allow an extra five, if you need to kick the gate some more when you come back,” Harry said. Ginny laughed, her breath warm against the side of his face and she squeezed his hand as she stepped back. Her anger was still clinging to her, but he could tell she was trying to keep a tighter hold on it. He smiled at Ginny, watching her leave before he turned to Herbert.
For some reason, that made Harry smile. He felt his mouth curling upwards and then he laughed, a soft exhale as he nodded. Malfoy looked at him oddly. “I loathe it too. That’s what I’m trying to say. I get — I get self-conscious. I don’t ever know what I’m supposed to say. Not just with you, but also it seems to happen a lot with you.”
“Malfoy, I’m sorry,” Harry blurted out. He scuffed the toe of his trainers against the ground. “I was rude. I shouldn’t have been. It was rude to leave like that and then I shouldn’t have ignored you since.”
Harry considered Malfoy for a long moment. He wanted to burst right out, to tell him that he was being ridiculous. He had been a Death Eater and Harry didn’t doubt that he had wanted it at one point, no matter how much Malfoy had tried to obscure that fact throughout his trial. Malfoy had chosen a path and then deviated from it but that didn’t mean that he didn’t deserve a punishment. He wanted to snap at him and tell him that, for all the horrible things he had done, Lucius Malfoy had done even worse and maybe he did not deserve to be welcomed back to the world with open arms. Maybe, this time, he deserved a lingering consequence.
Harry snorted. “That’s it exactly.” They were quiet for a moment, the conversation slipping away from them. Harry looked at his feet moving forward and noticed Malfoy had cuffed his trousers and wasn’t wearing any socks. He forced himself to look away and not ask about why he seemed to have a vendetta against both socks and shoes. To avoid blurting the question out, he heard himself say, “You know, if you want me to visit you could just ask.”
“Well that makes sense,” Draco said slowly, “seeing as you are an animal yourself.” He looked inordinately pleased with himself, slanting a sly, amused look at Harry. Harry smiled back at him and elbowed him in the ribs.
“I was picturing our business cards.” Ron’s grin was broad and slow, his warm, lazy good humour shining across his face. “They were beautiful. My name looked practically new and innovative beside Harmond.”
Narcissa cut a glance back at him and then nodded. “Yes, that makes sense.” She cleared her throat. “They’re beautiful flowers. They don’t take up too much room, either; roses are extremely prone to spreading and they loathe too much competition.” She continued to talk for a while as Harry stood there, pointing out different plants that hadn’t flowered yet, discussing how she also intended to incorporate lavender and what that helped repel. Harry tilted his head and listened and asked questions, nodding all the while. He had never hated herbology but it had never been where he shone, though he wasn’t sure if gardening was the same thing. All he knew was that this was clearly a passion of Narcissa’s — her face changed when she spoke, grew brighter, less troubled. She didn’t look like the woman who had asked him to visit her before her son’s trial. That person seemed like a distant memory.
Harry grinned. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
There was an owl at his window. Harry grinned and unfastened the note, unrolling it as he lay down on his bed.
She watched his approach with a vague look on her face Harry didn’t know what to do with. The two of them stood, mostly in silence, for a few minutes before Narcissa said, “Please, Mr Potter, understand that I am very grateful. Should you need anything, at any time.”
.” Her voice was desperate and her nails dug into his skin. Harry looked up at her and there were tears all over Hermione’s face but she didn’t look devastated. “Harry, I swear I’m fine.”
“Oh, yeah, that’s right.” Harry took a sip of his orange juice. Hermione had started to sort the quills into order of size. It was really too early for this. “Hermione, do you want to start the list and then I’ll just contribute?”
Malfoy laughed, bitterly. “Oh, it is. You’re always there. You’re there nearly every time I do something stupid, or selfish, or when I don’t want you to be.”
“No.” Draco hesitated and then pulled back. His grip on Harry was still tight, his face disconcertingly open. Harry didn’t know what that meant. “Nothing about you makes me sick.”
Hermione was not smiling. She was propped on one of the stools at the breakfast bar, feet swinging beneath her, slippers kicked off and on the floor. The remains of their dinner were in the sink and in front of her were two large slices of chocolate cake. She glanced at Harry, considering, wrapping a strand of hair around her finger and then letting it go over and over until he had taken a seat again and she sighed.
“What?” Draco’s voice was sharp.
” Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned away. The robe he was wearing flared out as he dropped down from the platform the piano stood on and sat on the edge. His hands flat on the platform, he bent forward, staring down at his shoes and scowling. “That’s my whole fucking point, Potter.”
“It’s not a dirty word, Harry,” Draco said. “It isn’t. There’s always power, no matter what. People always want it, or have it, or they don’t. It’s in every interaction we ever have.”
“Yes, I
Malfoy looked even more aggrieved than he had earlier, pale and unhappy as he sucked his bottom lip into his mouth. “I don’t need to just
“Hey,” Ron said, unfolding his arms to reach into his pockets. He pulled out several sandwiches and brandished them about. “I brought you what I would want if I had to sit and talk to stuffy old witches and wizards all day.”
“What else would you call it?”
“I think I’m going to have tea. With your mother. I wrote to her a couple of days ago.” Harry tried to continue on but Malfoy had come to a stop just in front of him. His eyes were flashing, grey and hard as stone. His face was slightly pink but Harry couldn’t have said whether it was from the shouting or the run down the lane. Harry regarded him for a moment and then moved to go past him; Malfoy moved directly into his path.
Harry snorted. “Hermione, I know he’s difficult.”
Hermione watched him with kind eyes. “Harry, we just thought it would be nice to talk all together.”
Finally, Malfoy stopped, spinning round. He looked on the verge of tears, which was why Harry was not that surprised when Malfoy picked up a candlestick from a nearby table and threw it at him. It was a particularly bad throw, going extremely wide, knocking into a portrait who yelled loudly instead.
He did not do that.
He did not say anything more and Malfoy waited a good ten seconds before he laughed and shook his head. “You are unbelievable. Truly. Let me assure you that however boring you are being, I would
By the time Hermione was finished they had a sizable list. It was surrounded by smaller lists, branching off, smaller goals. He told her he wanted to fix up Grimmauld and she added it; he told her he wanted to visit the goblins, unofficially, and she added it; he told her he wanted to get his hair cut and she added that too, approaching every addition with the same solemnity.
“Yes, but maybe he did while you were sleeping or something.” Ron added more pasta.
Harry looked back at her and then smiled. “I think I am. Not that I  don’t — I mean, not that I don’t miss you.”
Tilting his head backwards, he looked up into the sky. Clouds were spread all over, light grey and hazy. The sun had burnt off some of them, letting blue peek through, and it didn’t look like it was going to rain. He glanced over at Draco and said, “Let’s fly.”
“Growths?”
Narcissa Malfoy sat across from Harry, her hands clasped loosely in front of her, her long fingers twitching occasionally as if she wanted to fidget. Harry had been unable to stop focusing on it since he’d noticed: the way her hand spasmed every few minutes, as if she wanted to tap her nails against the table or play with the cup in front of her. She never did, always catching herself and quieting the impulse.
Harry looked at her and then nodded. While Ron finished preparing his breakfast and then as he wolfed it down, they drew up a list — the offer from McGonagall for private tutoring, or to return to Hogwarts if he wished. The offer from Kingsley, backed by Head Auror Robards, to join the DMLE. The offers he had received everywhere he turned, owls pouring in and people clasping his hands and telling him that they’d be honoured if he would join their training programme/fine establishment. Some of them Hermione frankly refused to put down. She looked particularly stern as she scored out “Tattoo artist” after Harry scribbled it.
Harry turned his face away and looked at Narcissa as the door closed behind Malfoy. “Um,” he said, and then nothing else came to mind.
Draco’s neck was red. He scoffed but it sounded weak. “Okay, Dad.”
for a fact that you never said ‘hey, Harry, just as an FYI I’m writing to your friends sometimes, just for the laugh of it all.’”
which is, quite frankly Potter, a little upsetting! And all I see all day is her face, and Blighter’s face, and my face, and your stupid face and nothing else. It’s all just a
Ginny was with him the day that Malfoy owl arrived again.
“Do you think it’s hard to talk to Hermione?”
“I’m in for an interview at the animal Healer’s I was telling you about.” Harry crunched his way through more of the cereal. “See how it goes and if I like it I might apply to start learning, you know. In the autumn.”
. Harry grinned at it and made himself the biggest mug of tea he could and drank it. He showered with the radio blasting, singing along to Motown songs that made his heart soar. He walked naked to his room without worrying about anyone seeing him and when he got there he let impulse guide him.
“I know that, Hermione,” he said, gently. “Apart from my life, of course.”
” Ron’s smile grew as he talked until it covered his face, bright as the sun. He watched Harry as Harry finished kneading the dough and left it to rest before coming over to sit beside him.
He wanted to tell him all of those things but when he looked at Malfoy all he could think about was how exhausted he looked, how Harry had noticed every movement of his for the past few days looking slower and heavier, as if his bones were becoming more dense and he was unaccustomed to moving with that weight. He remembered how awful Malfoy had looked at the trials, the pallor of his skin after being in custody for those few months. Malfoy never talked about it but Harry knew the weeks in the Ministry’s cells had changed him. Harry let the silence sit, chewing on his bottom lip, cradling the glass in his hand and not drinking it.
Harry had known that Narcissa had been confined to her home, a house arrest issued as she awaited trial. Her husband and son hadn’t fared as well, remanded into custody and instructed to wait. Harry mostly tried not to think about it: he hadn’t had time to sort out what he felt, or why, or what any of it meant. Instead, he’d bounced among appearances, among families, and into bed, clinging to the occasional afternoon nap. He glanced at Narcissa and wondered if she was taking naps.
He found he preferred to touch Malfoy instead. His shoulder pressed against Malfoy’s and their knees rested together, forming a bridge. Harry gently reached forward and Malfoy’s hands wavered for a moment as Harry tapped his fingertips along Malfoy’s knuckles.
To Harry, this sounded like a stretch considering mostly what Ron seemed to know was where they worked and that the Aurors had to call them to help sometimes. To Hermione, it was clearly a comfort. She gave him a watery smile, fondness and affection shining out of her face as she whispered, “Thanks. I love you guys.”
The memory of the evening burned bright in Harry’s mind. He thought about it, trying to recreate the tears of laughter gathering in Dean’s eyes, or how hard his ribs had hurt with the force of his own cackling. He thought about Ginny, tossing her hair and slamming her body back against the seat as she scream-laughed, and used the joy on each of his friend’s faces to try and chase back the memory of Voldemort’s.
“What do you want from me, Potter? I’m extremely busy. I can’t do this. We
They sat like that for a moment, both breathing harshly, the sound mingling. Harry shifted to wrap his arm back around Draco’s neck and pressed his forehead back against Draco’s. He knew he was breathing, but he barely felt like he was. He knew he still had a body because he could see it, but he barely felt it. He felt buoyant. He felt like smoothing one hand (the cleaner one, naturally) through Draco’s hair so he did.
“Mate,” Ron said, his expression making it clear he thought he was being asked a daft question, “I’m gonna join the Aurors.”
Harry looked at him and then nodded. He stood up quickly, turning back to extend his hand to Draco and tug him up. “Then let’s go do something fun.”
He sat and listened whenever Draco talked and tried to help. Draco had regular deliveries of ingredients and, now that Narcissa was allowed out, she brought him back more. Harry had started to bring the ones that made Draco anxious and twitchy, ingredients that some of the apothecaries flinched at selling to someone with the name ‘Malfoy.’
As he turned onto the street with Hermione’s house — his home — Harry remembered how Buckbeak had bent his head and the wild thrill of riding him. He thought about how in awe he had been of the dragons, their glittering scales and the rush of their wings. He thought about the unicorns and the thestrals and the other creatures he’d seen along the way. It made him thoughtful and when he walked straight to the kitchen to find Ron making tea he said, “Hey, Ron. Do you think I could work with creatures?”
“Quiet down, the two of you.” Ron looked particularly smug at getting the opportunity to say that and turned to the front of the court as they started proceedings. Harry watched the Wizengamot pour in and found he didn’t know whether he wanted to look at Malfoy or not.
“We haven’t had sex!”
Ron picked him up from outside the Manor gates, not even attempting to hide his laughter as he apparated Harry home and dumped him into bed.
“Why would I make a thing out of it, Malfoy?” Harry asked, eyes glittering. “That doesn’t sound like something to make a thing out of at all.”
Harry studied him for a moment. Malfoy’s jaw looked tight and the bags under his eyes weren’t quite as prominent as the first time Harry had visited Malfoy Manor. He supposed he looked less skeletal, as if Malfoy had slowly started to eat, but there was still something about him that looked thoroughly different than Harry remembered him from school. Harry hated it: he didn’t like mysteries he felt he couldn’t scratch away at and solve. “Okay,” he said. “So other people visit?”
It made his heart warm.
“I asked you a direct question and you didn’t respond,” Malfoy pointed out, logically, annoyingly. “That’s plenty for me.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, voice jagged and gasping. “Potter, this is indecent. In my own kitchen? How dare you.” He was laughing and his eyes were dancing. Harry loved to see it, how flushed he looked, how happy. Harry grinned widely into his face and moved again, seeking friction, watching the way it made Malfoy’s eyes spark.
Lavender laughed. It was a bold sound, a far cry from a giggle, although she sounded just as delighted. “You were very vague. I wasn’t sure what was going on! I mean, I knew it wasn’t anything that serious, probably, because no one ever asks me anything serious but what if it was? My heart was going a mile a minute!”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “For God’s sake.” He wanted to throw his hands into the air and he would have done if he didn’t catch the expression on Malfoy’s face, a quicksilver flash of amusement that told him that no matter
“But why? Are they ill?”
Draco looked affronted. “We’re the
The loud and nearly hysterical laughter that escaped Draco was, frankly, uncalled for. Harry glared at him. “Fuck off.”
Harry followed him. He had not necessarily expected anything from the room: he had walked through enough of the Manor with Malfoy that he knew it was filled with odd rooms, rooms with nothing in them but a piano, some chairs and a lot of furniture with no defined purpose other than to look impressive. He had seen countless drawing rooms and studies, several of them in disrepair that both he and Malfoy had taken pains not to directly mention. He had seen the kitchen and the dining room and Malfoy had walked through a ball room once, shoes off, doing a dramatic rendition of Harry’s terrible dancing at the Yule Ball which had left him breathless with laughter.
Harry stared at him and then smiled. He reached to cup Draco’s face and said, “I’ve never been happier to hear it.”
, breathing down my neck, watching me do it! I’m fixing this dump up! I’m trying not to go out of my fucking mind, Potter.”
Bitterness laced her words as Narcissa said, “I can leave as long as I’m back for seven.”
When Harry arrived home, Hermione and Ron were standing together in the kitchen, a covered pot boiling on the hob. They turned to look at him almost as one and Hermione blinked in shock.
“I’ll have written evidence that you attacked me, of course,” Harry said. He walked closer to Malfoy, who blinked in surprise, and then hastily covered it by looking away. They started to walk up the lane. “It’d be kind of sloppy.”
While he disappeared to get the coat, Harry sank down onto his hunkers and petted Yolanda. He muttered to her, telling her that he didn’t believe she’d jump on Malfoy unless he specifically told her to. She seemed to like it, preening under his attention, coaxing a laugh out of him as she rubbed her head against him over and over. Harry stopped laughing when Malfoy’s shadow passed over them. He squinted up at Malfoy and then stood.
Malfoy looked vaguely ill. “This is really hurting me,” he said, almost moaning. “I know that, Potter, but it would greatly alleviate my burden if you could simply say ‘yes, I accept your gratitude and will bear this nobly, as I bear everything’ and we can be done with it.”
The way he said it sounded like
You’re hardly special, Potter, no matter what anyone says.”
Harry squeezed his eyes together and told himself it wasn’t true. Hermione had
Ron did not need his help. Ron had his own name, his own reputation, his earnest, open manner. He rushed into the house one day, chattering excitedly, waving a stack of parchment and several books at Harry. It took him several long minutes to calm him down, to draw him back and coax answers out of him.
Malfoy studied him intently and then exhaled. “You’re talking as if you’re a leader of some kind of force of change. Are you a politician now, Potter?”
Malfoy hummed, clearly not believing him, and then walked over to throw himself into one of his armchairs. Harry followed, trying not to look at the huge pile of discarded clothes. It felt even more intimate than staring at his bed had been; it felt too much like truly knowing Malfoy to see his dirty laundry literally spread out in front of him, the jumble of things he had worn and thrown aside. Unfortunately that meant he had to watch Malfoy as he flung his legs over the side of his armchair and stared into the fireplace. A fire was lit but until Harry walked right in front of it he could barely feel the warmth. The Malfoy’s had obviously perfected the charms to allow them the aesthetic delight of the fire without the overwhelming heat. It was ridiculous that it made Harry smile.
“You’re an ass, Harry.”
“Prick.”
“Some people are awfully hung up on power,” Narcissa said. She spoke from the chair across from Harry but she sounded far away. It was a tone of voice Harry didn’t hear often and, when he did, it tended to be about Lucius. She always looked different, her gaze turning blurred, her head tilted towards the windows. Harry looked at her and bit his lip. He didn’t want to look at Draco at the same time. He always looked paler and younger when his mother did this. “They let it burn everything else up in them. It can erode people’s sense of self and warp it, although this only means that they weren’t strong enough to survive its lure. They can be weak.”
He glanced at her and saw that she was flushing. Her face had lit up, a smile bursting forth that he could see out of one corner of her scarf. “Thanks,” she said, folding herself into an armchair. “I like it too. Why are you here?”
“We’ll stay in bounds, Draco.” Harry thought he had the patience of a saint. “I promise not to hurt your feelings by thoroughly trouncing you a million times.”
Harry was stuck on wondering whether she was sympathising or making a veiled comment about how horrible house arrest was when there was a loud crack outside the study and then the doors opened. Malfoy was standing just behind Blighter, obviously a house elf, slouching against a wall and looking very bored. As Blighter walked in, he straightened and came into the room after him.
“It definitely isn’t.” Harry wanted to hold Draco’s hand still. He reached out and did, linking their fingers together and ignoring the look on Draco’s face as he did. “Your mum wasn’t talking about you. Your mum loves you. She thinks the world of you.”
It was easy to avoid someone who was on house arrest.
Harry looked down and assessed the damage. Mud ran up his legs. His t-shirt was still wet, both from the run and from Yolanda shaking her coat off in front of him. He was wearing shorts, even though it was the end of October and they were covered in muck. There was even dirt on his biceps. Harry blinked in surprise. “I didn’t realise it was so bad.”
Harry nodded, but he didn’t realise how much he had taken that to heart until he was standing in the courtroom, waiting for Draco Malfoy’s verdict. They had arrived too late to get a seat and the three of them, Harry, Ron and Hermione were pressed against the back row. Hermione rested her hip against the bench and was chewing on her lip, periodically turning to glare at anyone who whispered too loudly near them about something she did not like.
“Arsehole.”
“How nice for you,” Malfoy drawled. “Would that we all were so lucky.”
“Oh, did you read that, Hermione?”
“Don’t say anything until you’ve thought about what you’re going to say,” Harry said sternly. Draco made several indignant noises and then firmly licked Harry’s hand until he removed it from over his mouth. Wrinkling his nose, Harry wiped his hand on his jeans and Draco laughed at that, a bright, sharp sound which burst through the air.
“Morning,” Harry said, stopping right in front of him.
“It’s not the same.”
Harry let the words hit and said, “I don’t really think that’s true. I just asked you —”
“You two are so weird.” Hermione frowned. She let Harry’s hand drop finally, taking a sip of her wine. Her eyes were sharp and still watching Harry. Harry could tell this was not the last time they were going to talk about it but if he got his way it wouldn’t be for several long, long days.
“Of course not.” Blighter turned and Harry followed him, doggedly attempting some form of conversation that was mostly ignored. Instead of answering his mundane questions, Blighter instead regaled Harry with a list of all the painists that had once played in the piano room, looking more and more vexed as the conversation went on.
Draco started. It was extremely physical. He pushed himself forward, spine snapping straight and pulling him away from the wall. His shoulders tensed and he turned his head to look at Harry, eyebrows lifted, jaw slack. His hand was still clutching onto Harry’s but it was much tighter. Harry made himself be soft.
He stopped off at home, divesting himself of some of the treats. The thought seized him just before he was leaving and he grabbed some and a bottle of mulled wine, sending it to Lavender with a scrawled Christmas note. He watched the owl depart for a moment and then grabbed his backpack again, apparating to Malfoy Manor.
“I won’t. Move your hand.”
“Mr Potter does not know where the piano room is, does he?”
Instead, he pressed open the door, clearing his throat as an announcement of his presence. It didn’t matter, because Draco wasn’t there. He wasn’t in the kitchen, or the piano room. He wasn’t in the second library or the guest parlour, or the small alcove Harry knew exclusively because sometimes Draco dragged him into it, pressing kisses along his jaw, his throat, his sternum, and lately his hips. Harry lingered there for a moment, feeling strangely bereft at standing there without Draco, and then moved on.
Ginny snorted. “Harry, that’s not what I was getting at.”
“Nice room,” he said finally, when he realised Malfoy was watching him with a strange look.
“He’s upset,” he said finally, when it became clear that Narcissa wasn’t going to speak.
Harry stared at the riot for a moment and then smiled. “Lavender, this is amazing.”
The laugh that Narcissa let out was brittle. “You misspeak, Harry. He idolised him. He always did. I — I feel like I should have served them both better, managed their expectations more.”
It was, however, kind of funny when he was sitting across from her in a fancy dining room in Malfoy Manor.
Harry laughed softly. “I’m real, Draco. Don’t be so ridiculous.”
“Malfoy,” Harry called. Malfoy did not respond. “Malfoy,” louder this time and again, “Malfoy!”
“This is a garden.” Harry waved behind him. “Flowers. A pond. Seven thousand acres.”
Harry grinned and waved. “Merry Christmas,” he said.
“What’s the point of that?”
“I think it might knock me out.”
Harry nodded a few times and then said, “Okay.” And then: “Do you wanna hear about how my girlfriend dumped me then?” And then, he frowned and looked down at the plate of macaroons in betrayal. Perhaps they had been laced with something.
She made a noise that sounded like a hum but she was staring at the library door and looked wan. There was a strange look on her face that had crept in at the edges of the icy expression, burning the edges off enough that she looked more human now. Narcissa sniffed and then flicked a glance towards Harry.
Narcissa stared at him. Harry really, really wished he could read her. “You’re visiting because Draco told you not to?” Harry nodded; Narcissa made a thoughtful noise. “I see. That’s extraordinarily petty. Have a macaroon, Harry.”
Harry flushed with annoyance. “It’s not funny, Malfoy. It’s a very important offer.”
“You are a fucking god, mate,” Ron said reverently, jumping towards the cupcakes.
“Potter, I might have to ask Blighter to poison you just for assaulting my eyes like that.”
“Oh yeah?” Harry grinned at her, ignoring the tension within his chest. “That’s great. I know you weren’t sure.”
Malfoy stared at him for a long moment and then looked sharply away, back at his lawyer. Harry looked down at his hands.
“He doesn’t want to upset you.”
“Hermione?” She lifted her head and Harry continued, “Do you think I could be a healer?”
“Dickhead.”
Kingsley asked if he had arrived at a decision yet; Ginny wanted to tell him she was going back to Hogwarts and wanted to know if she would see him at the train station; the Malfoy owl was from Malfoy, male, nineteen. Harry was so surprised he dropped the letter and then looked quickly around to make sure that Hermione wasn’t there to see him behaving bizarrely.
“No, I don’t think so,” Hermione sounded aggrieved. “I just didn’t think —”
“Wassup?” he said, voice heavy and thick with sleep.
“You’re gonna let me eat some of that food, so you’ve already done that,” Ron declared, before launching into a recap of his day. Harry watched him intently as he talked, relishing the light in Ron’s eyes, the way his enthusiasm made every gesture huge and expansive. He laughed along as Ron told him about the mission, about stumbling and falling on his face, how a girl he was training with had to haul him up even though he was at least twice her size. Mostly, he watched how delighted Ron looked and the easy way he told the story, with a deep pleasure rolling through every syllable.
idk what else to say as it's been approximately 10 years since i last even posted a fanfic and i forget how this goes so!!!!
a lot. People want to change all the time.”
Neither of them noticed the footsteps that announced Ron’s arrival until he cleared his throat and said, “Uh, did someone fucking die? What the hell’s going on?”
Two hours later found Draco standing in the lobby of the Ministry of Magic, Charlie at his side.
Dean ducked his head down, looking uncomfortable, but Luna spoke up dreamily.
“I’ve just talked to Harry, and he’s fine with you staying here.”
1961-1979
“And now I have to keep a stranger in my house for two weeks! How am I supposed to do that, Luna? I’m not put together enough for that!”
He wandered around the house for a while, appreciating the fine architecture and the heavily woven magic embedded in the very core of the house. Magic that had been there for centuries.
“I’m not asking you to move back or anything like that. It’s just two weeks, love. You haven’t been home in three years. It’s time, mo dhragon.”
“Oh trust me, he won’t! Thank you thank you thank you, Harry; you’re my savior!”
He wished Sirius were there.
Charlie looked over at him, the crease in his brow relaxing a bit. He gave his boyfriend a weary smile. “That sounds great.”
Draco was considering chatting awkwardly longer when he heard Potter’s voice from down the hall.
Late that night he had finally relented and dragged himself across the room to respond to the insistent knocking on the bedroom door.
“Oh, Merlin.”
Neville asked.
“I told you, we went to school together.”
“Oh, she’s just great.”
Charlie helped as much as he could, but he knew this wasn’t something he could fix, so he more just made sure that Draco was eating enough to sustain himself, and helped him when he couldn’t.
Of course it was raining.
Malfoy choked on his glass of water, his eyes widening. “Norberta is that dragon? Jesus.”
“I’d love nothing more.”
“Because I like this one better!”
“Oh. Ok..”
Much love,
Really all he wanted to do was sleep.
“Shut up, Pollux.”
He could get horribly drunk, though Charlie probably wouldn’t like that.
“It was.”
“Jesus fuck, Charlie, that’s cold!”
Draco turned back and glared at his boyfriend, resigned. “You’re not taking no for an answer, are you?”
Charlie only raised his eyebrows, smiled, and picked up his plate to take it to the sink.
“I know. She’s had tea with your mother a few times recently, though you probably already know that.”
He grabbed a second bottle of hangover potion and walked back into his bedroom where Justin was halfway sat up on his elbows.
He had said his name was Charlie, and he liked to keep his family life away from Romania, so he didn’t give out his last name. Draco had chuckled, given his own first name, and said that he would love to leave his family life behind whilst out of the country, and didn’t say his last name either. Charlie didn’t mind, but his face did light up when Draco gave his first name.
“Draco?! What are you doing here?”
“Draco love, I’ve put our things in the east wing third floor bedroom, why don’t you go and unpack? I’ll be up in a bit.”
“Do you have to go into work today?”
He was not jealous of Ginny and Luna’s relationship. He had decided that a long time ago.
“Shut up.”
Charlie knocked on the door, stepped back, and it opened.
“What if he doesn’t like me?”
Draco was sprawled out across, tired and satisfied. Charlie came sauntering out of the bathroom with a wet flannel and tossed it haphazardly to the other end of the room.
He had barely even thought about his family. He never really did, his brain had sort of shut down in a way over the years, refusing to touch those memories, those thoughts.
He started to slide his hand up Charlie’s shirt, but the other man caught his wrist.
That was until Charlie’s silver-blue Swedish Shortsnout Patronus came whooshing through the kitchen door, and Charlie’s voice rang through the room.
He turned on his heel and scrubbed angrily at his eyes, trying to wipe away the tears that wouldn’t stop falling.
“Look Charlie, he was a git, yeah? And then...the summer we were sixteen, the war was picking up. I don’t know the specifics, but he chose the wrong side, took the mark. He was sent to kill Dumbledore, and help Death Eaters into Hogwarts. And he did, too. Well, help Death Eaters in, that is. He didn’t end up killing Dumbledore. But I caught onto him, during sixth year. We had an...incident in a school bathroom. I hurt him, badly. He almost didn’t make it. I don’t know much of what he did after that. But he was a dick, a blood supremacist and a Death Eater. I hate him and he hates me, plain and simple. The only reason he escaped imprisonment after the war was because he was a minor when he took the mark, so he claimed coercion. You should stay away from him.”
