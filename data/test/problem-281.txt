“You’ll want to avoid the Alphas. Though… if I recall correctly, you’re a dominant Omega, so they shouldn’t give you too much trouble, really. There’s only one dominant Alpha presently attending, and I don’t believe you two ever even speak to one another, so that shouldn’t be much of a concern…” She seemed as though she was trying to convince herself, and Harry tried to remember what he’d been told about ‘dominant’ Alphas and Omegas. All Alphas and Omegas released pheromones, and with the regular kind, Alphas and Omegas could influence one another, especially if one was in a heat or rut. Dominants, though, produced
He led Malfoy out the back door, and into the small, closed off alley. He shut the door behind them, and leaned against it, blocking it with his body, so no one could come out after them ‘accidentally’. Malfoy faced him silently, head tilted at an insolent angle.
"Well, whatever you were or weren't calling it, I know you were… close… for a while. I can't say I understood it, but… you did seem happy with him. I was honestly surprised when you and Ginny announced your engagement, but you seemed so SURE when I asked you about it, that it was what you wanted… so I didn't press further, but now… after seeing the way you were at the pub… I think maybe I should have…" Harry couldn't stand the way she looked so sad. Her life was perfect, she'd gotten everything she wanted. It wasn't her responsibility to make sure his life was just as perfect. It was an impossible task, anyway, and would only leave her as unhappy as him. Harry tried to push the melancholy thoughts away, and focused on one thing that was puzzling him.
"Well, what was I SUPPOSED to think, Harry? Given your previous relationship, and the way you couldn't seem to take your eyes off of him at your party, when Ginny mentioned you'd gone over there, I just… I was worried. I KNOW you'd never want to hurt Ginny, but… Anyone could be driven to extremes, especially… with how things have been recently." Hermione spoke quickly, getting her words out before Harry could explode with anger. But as he opened his mouth, glaring at her, eyes flickering to the tiny redhead sleeping nearby, his anger fizzled out, replaced with depressed acceptance. He never should have trusted that Hermione wasn't watching, or noticing the state of his marriage, or lack of enthusiasm.
Through the haze of mint and kissing, Harry felt a hand creep up his shirt, and gave a soft groan of appreciation. He was too warm, too sensitive, and touch was the only thing that helped. It wasn’t as instantly overwhelming as Malfoy’s pheromones had been, but it was still nice. Harry was enjoying himself, and reasoned that this was what Madam Pomfrey had suggested, afterall.
“Harry! I was worried! Where were you?” Ginny was awake, despite that it was hardly past dawn, and for the first time since his lips had touched Draco’s the previous day, Harry felt a stab of guilt.
“So… You like cuddling?” Harry finally gave up, and teased Malfoy for his actions. He let his arm drape across Malfoy’s cotton-covered stomach, just as useless as it had been at pushing him away.
“Thank you, but no. We’re fine.” Harry lied, doing his level best to convince her, standing so he could attempt to flee.
"About that, I'm er… sorry for going a bit off last night. I just wasn't expecting to be smothered all of a sudden." Ron said with an apologetic grimace. Harry waved it off. He wasn't upset over Ron's overreaction, merely that everyone was going to KNOW what he was, eventually.
“Yeah. Me, Ginny, and Charlie. Does it suddenly bother you?” Ron asked, and Harry could see the tension in his shoulders, as if he was preparing for a fight. The tangy smell filled the space between them, and Harry rushed to calm his friend down.
“He’s not doing it now, though, is he?” Hermione asked in her most Prefect-y voice. Ron shook his head, looking almost sad.
Harry was saved having to figure out what he’d say to Malfoy by a knock at his door just as he’d started pacing, trying to think of something that wouldn’t make him look stupid. He went to answer the door and found Malfoy standing there, several inches taller than him so he had to look up, grey eyes focused down the hall like he was scouting for witnesses. Harry stepped aside without a word and let him in, holding his breath, his shoulders filled with tension. Seeing Malfoy when he was in heat felt differently when he’d agreed to do so. When it wasn’t a surprise he was trying to learn to breathe through.
He stared at Malfoy's face, tasting the air, and mulling over what Pomfrey had suggested. Malfoy, despite their differences,
Malfoy laughed at that, and Harry felt it vibrate inside him. He liked Malfoy laughing. It was embarrassing to feel him laughing
"I don't hate you. I just want you to leave." Malfoy said, looking away. Harry stared at him a minute, exploring the slightly aged face, the way he stood, the way his fingers picked nervously at his robes.
“Cheers.” Malfoy replied, and lifted the glass he was holding in toast to Harry’s subversive pettiness. Ginny grinned, glad that they’d decided to get along. Harry knew she had no idea what she’d just done by inviting him.
Malfoy went still, forehead resting on Harry’s sternum, hands still holding Harry’s waist from his last few desperate thrusts, and Harry felt his breath cooling the sweat all down his stomach in harsh bursts. The burn had faded, leaving him feeling burnt out, and exhausted. He let his arms drop to the bed, and took in a deep shuddering breath. He could smell Draco, but the scent had changed. It was no longer filled with lust. There was no trace of the irritation he’d been worried about, either. He smelled… satisfied. He smelled of finished sex, stability, warmth. Harry turned his head, rubbing his nose in soft hair, letting the smell wrap around him in a comforting embrace as Malfoy settled closer, pressing his weight to Harry as he relaxed.
“You’re welcome, Harry. You did seem surprised, though. Perhaps a wrackspurt got into your head while you were with him, and made you forget?” She suggested. Harry gave her a long, considering look. He knew she was an Omega. He trusted her, even if she was a bit odd sometimes.
“Well, at least you’re getting better at controlling your pheromones in public.” Malfoy drawled, eyes dark as his eyes swept around the room and finally landed on Harry. Harry wasn’t quite sure what that was supposed to mean, and decided not to bother asking. He could feel Malfoy’s pheromones against his skin, surrounding him like a blanket, and it did not make him want to talk. He grabbed the front of Malfoy’s robes and pulled their bodies flush together. His neck craned up and he pressed a sloppy kiss to Malfoy’s lips that the blond returned instantly. Hands circled his waist, and Harry felt his feet stumbling as he was guided blindly across the floor. Clothes were discarded as they went, falling to the floor, tossed to the couch, strewn along the foot of the bed. There was no shame, no self-consciousness. He knew Malfoy wanted him, knew he
. It almost bothered him, that after the horrible, freakish night of bliss Malfoy was just as unwilling to meet his gaze as Harry was.
Harry held the sleeping blond bundle, and sang in a whispered voice, letting the tiny face and even tinier breaths soothe his breaking heart. Here, at least, was one person who he could easily please.
“Stop…” Harry moaned, forehead falling to rest on the door between his hands. He felt Malfoy’s lips stretch into a smile against his skin. He hadn’t even noticed that he’d let go of the sheet and it had fallen to the floor, but he could feel Malfoy’s hard cock pressing between his thighs.
“So… Why doesn’t everyone just do that?” Harry asked, imagining that a single person’s pheromones would be FAR easier to cope with than the onslaught he usually had to suffer.
“If anyone prefers to sleep in a dorm with your classmates, rather than having their own rooms, that is acceptable, but you will be held to the regular curfew, so you do not disturb the other students. You will be allowed off of castle grounds on the weekends, out to Hogsmeade, or to visit home if you wish. These are privileges that I expect will not be abused. Am I clear?”
"It means a lot to you? Suddenly, the past means something to you?" Malfoy scoffed. Harry winced, and braced himself for the rant he knew was coming.
“He is. Maybe he should come nanny for me. Scorpius is a handful.” Malfoy mused, looking down at Rose thoughtfully. Harry glared at him. He knew that Malfoy had said it in front of Ginny, knowing he’d be unable to refuse without looking like a monster.
He didn’t mention that the thought of being alone enough with Malfoy to have such a private conversation made him worry that he’d end up giving in to those budding baser urges. He refused to even THINK about giving Malfoy the opportunity to sleep with him again.
“I like blokes, too.” He said with a shrug, trying for nonchalant. Ron’s eyes widened, and he glanced at Hermione who just smiled, and spoke without missing a beat.
“If he’s spent his entire mature life on suppressants, it’s no surprise he’s not familiar with the different pheromones, Ron. I mean, dominants ARE the minority. I wouldn’t be surprised if he hadn’t been close enough to one since coming off the potions to even know.” Hermione lectured him. Ron looked sheepish, and Harry remembered suddenly what Madam Pomfrey had said.
"No, Hermione! I did not cheat on Ginny. Why would you even ASK that?" Harry refuted defensively. Thinking about cheating was another thing.
“Er… a charm?” Harry prompted, hoping to avoid whatever strange tension had been between the two of them all day. He could imagine what it was, and was trying desperately not to think about it.
An elbow in his ribs brought his mind back to the present, and he realized that McGonagall was speaking again.
By dinnertime, Harry felt nearly dead on his feet, and already ready for bed. He quickly changed into his new school robes, and followed his friends down to the Great Hall. The hall was empty when they arrived, the first group of students still disembarking from the train down in Hogsmeade. They took their seats, and chatted in hushed, almost reverent whispers as they waited.
“I’d heard he was back in the country, so I invited him. I know that before he left, you two were sort of becoming… well, not ‘friends’, but… I just thought it would be nice to invite him.” Ginny gave him a look full of meaning, and Harry, for the life of him, couldn’t figure out what meaning that was. He looked around for Hermione to interpret, but she was at the far end of the room. He shook his head slowly, and pasted his best smile on. He couldn’t disappoint Ginny after she’d gone to so much trouble for this party.
." She said it acidically, as if she derided the very concept. Harry felt his lips twitch in a smirk. "But I have read up on it extensively."
." Hermione gave him a sympathetic look, and Ron, a commiserating one. "You're lucky, then, that it's not worse."
The sharp reminder made the smile fall from Harry’s face. His stomach twisted with discomfort, and he fought the urge to look around, to see who else might be glancing covertly at their classmates. He’d done his damnedest since he’d learned at the age of thirteen that he was not just a normal boy to forget everything Pomfrey and Dumbledore had tried to explain to him. He took a suppressant potion every day, and tried not to think about what people would say if they knew. He’d occasionally heard, throughout the years, of others’ designations, but it never made him feel any less of a freak. Afterall, boys weren’t supposed to be able to get pregnant.
“It doesn’t happen often.” She assured him, patting his shoulder gently. Harry felt the heat of her hand through his robes, and it made his stomach lurch. “Most of the Alphas in your classes will be able to control themselves by now, anyway. Just don’t make it too hard for them, yes?”
Harry shouted in surprise, not at all expecting to wake up naked next to Malfoy, and did the only thing he could think to do. He kicked Malfoy off the bed. It was quite easy, actually, just one foot, then another, two good shoves, and Malfoy toppled over the side with an angry expression and hands grasping uselessly for sheets that weren’t enough to keep him up. Harry scrambled off the other side, memories of the previous day flooding his mind as he snatched a sheet up and held it around himself. He refused to look at where Malfoy was lurching to his feet, and instead, hurried for the bathroom. He slammed and locked the door behind himself and immediately turned the shower on as hot as it would go.
“SURPRISE!” The entire pub seemed to shout. Harry took a startled step back, eyes darting around the crowd, recognizing every single face. He mentally checked the date, and realized with a profound level of stupidity that it was his birthday. He dutifully plastered a wide smile on his face.
When he looked back at his wife, she had tears sparkling in her eyes, and an upset flush on her cheeks. Her jaw was set, and she stood, glaring down at him. He braced himself, ready for shouting, or being hexed.
“If you think I’m ‘a bit bitey’ now, when I go into a rut, everything becomes infinitely riskier. More dangerous. Since we’re both dominants, it’s likely it would be far worse than I can anticipate. I would hurt you, I would mark you, and I would impregnate you.” Malfoy warned. Harry felt a chill go up his spine at that. It made something deep inside him stir to life, thrilling at the idea. He shoved it far back down as Draco spoke again.
When the stars and trembling finally subsided, Harry was left sucking in deep breaths of the comforting spice, and very aware of the knot trapped inside him. He licked the side of Draco’s neck, tasting that overpowering potency of his pulse. The haze was clearing a bit from his mind, and his breathing calmed. He leaned up, staring down at the Alpha secured to him, and felt a wave of satisfaction. This was
"Oh, really? You THINK you're in love with me? That's just sad. You THOUGHT you wanted to marry that redheaded bint, and before that, you THOUGHT you liked what we had going. Before THAT, you thought you hated me! I suggest you figure out your head, Potter. I have a child, now. I'm RESPONSIBLE for that tiny bundle of life. I can't afford to let you overturn my life, just because you THINK you have feelings deeper than a puddle."
He went to the sitting room, and paused, staring at the couch for only a moment before he went back to the bedroom, dragged the driest of his covers free, and collapsed onto the rather stiff sofa. He curled slightly in on himself, wrapped himself in the blanket, and closed his eyes, willing sleep to take him again.
“It’s fine, Draco, I’m not going to drop him.” He said, and a moment later, froze, realizing how familiar he’d been. For a moment, he’d been so lost in the moment, he’d forgotten Ginny, he’d forgotten the baby’s mother, and he’d forgotten that Draco was no longer the man he craved. They’d both changed. He’d gotten over his violent sexual urges, and seemed to have gotten over all sexual urges at all. He figured it was really for the best, since Ginny didn’t want children, not to risk it.
To his surprise, Draco slid over him, onto the bed, dragging Harry with him. A quick flick of his wrist covered them both with a cool sheet, and Harry felt the comforting scent of belonging seep into him, and relax his muscles. He pushed at Malfoy, trying to free himself, but Malfoy only shifted, lying on his back and pulled Harry into his side, arms wrapped around his body, keeping him trapped.
“Of course it is.” Harry snickered. For a brief moment, their eyes met, and Harry felt as if everything was back to normal. As if the past five and half years had never happened. As if any moment, Malfoy would insult him, and he’d be forced to kiss him.
His mouth was eager, demanding, possessive. His hips kept working, pushing more of himself into Harry with a steady rhythm. Harry moaned into his mouth, savored the flavor of his tongue, grinned at the sharp teeth that trapped him. He felt another orgasm building, and lifted his hips, riding Draco to bring it closer.
The second day was worse. His thoughts wouldn’t focus on class, and every time he glanced around the room, he saw several people glance away. Malfoy never did. He always met Harry’s stare directly, but from across the classroom, across the Great Hall, across the sunny grounds, Harry couldn’t smell him. It bothered him. He couldn’t tell from Malfoy’s face what he was thinking, and for several seconds during Transfiguration, he wondered if Malfoy would smell angry again. If he would smell aroused. Harry refused to entertain that thought for longer than a split second. He didn’t
"Yeah, fine, just thinking. I can see how that might've tipped you off." Harry nodded. "Why didn't you ever tell me you knew?"
He quickly took the soft pink mouth again, savoring a few slow, deep kisses. The kind he’d missed most. As his arousal quickly took charge once more, he let himself go, enjoying Draco in a way he hadn’t enjoyed anything in so long. His hands played brutally across the beloved pale body, and his every abuse was eagerly accepted. He held out longer the second time, switching erratically between his vicious pleasures, and a slow, torturous worship of his love.
"Alright. Harry… um… I'm not telling you to commit adultery, but… don't feel too guilty if you do." Hermione said, looking at him with an almost sad expression that he inspected for a moment. He nodded, and left her house, feeling a surprising stab of pain at what that look had meant.
“You know why he’s absent don’t you? If you go near him right now, Harry…” Ron shook his head, his lack of words explaining the horror far better than he could have. Harry’s head filled with Malfoy’s words.
Harry and Ron worked together after classes each day, using Ron or Harry’s room to practice in since Hermione’s didn’t have the anti-pheromone wards. To his humiliation, after Ron and he had first spoken about it and left for dinner, Zacharias smith had told them, in a rather haughty tone, to keep their pissing contests private, and that no one else wanted to suffer through their fighting over Hermione. Harry had glared at him until he’d choked and hurried off. Harry hadn’t realized he’d been releasing pheromones at all until Ron had nudged his shoulder, grinning and told him he could stop now.
"You seem to be living JUST fine without me, Potter. I could leave tomorrow, and you would forget I ever existed, just like you did last time. Boredom never killed anyone, so you'd be FINE." Malfoy argued, poking a finger into Harry's chest. Harry stared down into angry silver pools, his thoughts a hurricane of emotion and needs. Malfoy was provoking him, physically touching him, and TRYING to upset him. Harry knew he wanted him to lose control and get physical back, so that in the aftermath, they could blame the situation, not themselves. But it would still be adultery. He'd hoped to just talk things through with Malfoy, and then have words with Ginny, but… clearly Malfoy didn't want or need to talk. The angry challenge his eyes held was all the invitation Harry needed to know that if he was unfaithful to Ginny, Malfoy would forgive him. He'd be setting one piece of his life on fire, for just the possibility that Malfoy would actually reciprocate after he'd gotten what he wanted.
It was the usual assorted greetings he’d gotten, every day, for the past five years. And this morning, he hated them. They were evidence of how predictable, and mundane his life had gotten. Even chasing down Dark wizards, the occasional magical battle, he felt simply bored. His life, exciting as it may seem to the wizarding public, had grown dull. ‘Colorless’ someone had once said. He’d rather liked that expression. He could clearly see that that lampshade was a hideous shade of green, that Ginny’s hair was as red as ever, that his office was lined with colorful quidditch and wanted posters, but the world just seemed faded.
“Hello, Luna.” Harry greeted her politely, finding his smile came easier. He did like Luna, even if she was a bit odd. She was wearing turnip earrings and a sparkly headband that held her hair out of her face while she read. Harry inhaled her scent, and thought it reminded him of vanilla cakes. Sweet, soft, warm.
With that, she snatched a handful of floo powder, and disappeared in an angry shout and blaze of green flames. Harry sat for a moment, feeling a lump rise in his throat. She just refused to believe that he was through with her, and it was breaking his heart more than the knowledge of both their infidelities.
“All of your rooms will be in the southern hall of the seventh floor. The entire hall has been warded against underage students. All students with an Alpha or Omega designation will have extra warding on their rooms, as well. You may see Madam Pomfrey, myself, or Professor Flitwick with any concerns.”
“MALFOY!?” Ron shouted suddenly, making Harry jump, and fall back into one of the leather chairs in Hermione’s sitting room.
By the time his workday ended, Harry had nearly forgotten about his business at the Leaky Cauldron, and was eager to at least escape the seeming neverending buzz of paper whizzing into his office with new memos. He rushed through the corridors, taking the less populated route, knowing the main lifts would be so crowded, it would be faster to take the long route, and the out-of-the-way lifts. It was also a perk that he hardly ever saw anyone going this way, and didn’t have to pretend he’d enjoyed his day trapped there with them. He’d almost made it, when his senses told him something was off. He was being followed. He stopped, but before he could pull his wand out, his stalker spoke up.
“No! I… I came back… I don’t want to start skipping class already!” He thought of how Hermione would have his head if he skived off their third week of school.
In Charms, Professor Flitwick had been going over multi-wizard charms, and when he announced they’d be working on these in groups, Hermione had nearly slid off of her chair with excitement. Harry didn’t get the big deal about it, and was horrified when their little group of three was offered an unwanted fourth by Flitwick himself.
“That first time, we ran into each other in the hall, and it was an accident… Neither of us expected it. I don’t think he’s ever met a dominant Omega before, so… We both kind of lost control. And then it happened again, and again, so we just… decided to agree to let it happen. It’s… easier when I know what to expect.” Harry said. Ron seemed to relax at those last words but his face was still drawn with betrayal.
As he fell, exhausted and spent, into slumber, all the guilt he’d felt had vanished. He held Draco’s limp form in his arms, and for the first time in years, he felt peaceful. He knew tomorrow would be rough, filled with harsh emotions, but he didn’t care just then. For that moment, everything was perfect.
his anger. It was strange, smelling an emotion, and even stranger was Harry’s urge to soothe it. He wanted to touch Malfoy, to ask him what was wrong, to fix whatever it was. Harry desperately wanted to take the emergency potion in his bag. He knew this was not what Madam Pomfrey would label an ‘emergency’, but he felt the creeping sensation that he’d lose his mind if he was forced to sit still with an irritated Malfoy two feet away for much longer.
He arrived at Ron and Hermione’s home not even five minutes after the clock had told him to head home, and knocked as he entered.
Harry woke from the dream of that memory in a foul mood. He knew going to Malfoy Manor had been a terrible idea. He went through the motions of getting ready for work, and spent the morning nursing a stress-induced headache. He wished, for a split second, that some dark wizard would appear, to take his mind off  the dark, tumbling thoughts that seemed to consume him.
“Malfoy!” He tried to keep his voice light, knowing that someone would hear, someone would be watching. There was always someone in a crowd, with their eyes on him. Malfoy kept walking, and Harry nearly let his smile slip as his face instinctively wanted to snarl. He had to keep himself in firm check as he took Malfoy’s elbow. “Malfoy. A word?” He made it clear it was not an invitation, but a demand. Malfoy shrugged, and let Harry lead him through the crowd. When Harry was forced to let go, he was surprised that Malfoy kept following, his face just as carefully disinterested as ever, though he did smile at a few people they passed.
smell.” Ron teased. “He wasn’t nearly as much of a dick today as he usually is. Strange, ‘cause he was definitely acting pissy.”
His hand was on the handle when Malfoy stopped him, arms snaking around his waist, pulling him up against his hard, warm body.
“Just the one. One, every day, until the heat passes. Usually it only takes about a week, but… It’s been almost two.” Harry tried to keep the worry from his voice, as Pomfrey’s eyes got wider the longer he spoke.
“You should take time off of your classes until it is over. I assume, since you’ve been using suppressants, you have no Alpha partner?”
The warm body against his froze, and Smith stumbled back a step, appearing to choke on the air. Harry could taste it on his tongue before he even opened his eyes. Malfoy was standing there, glaring at Smith. The hall was stifling with so many pheromones. Spice, mint, and the spice was getting stronger. Harry felt his breath coming in fast pants, and he tasted Malfoy’s fury, and watched as Smith’s pupils contracted to tiny points, and he sucked in a shuddering breath, stumbling to catch himself against the wall as his whole body trembled. He and Malfoy had their eyes deadlocked, and Malfoy, it appeared, was winning whatever silent battle they fought. Harry found his own eyes pinned to Draco as the scent of him grew to a tangible saturation in the air. The mint was barely an undercurrent in the face of Malfoy’s wrath. He could taste Smith’s sudden surge of panic, the last rush of pheromones, and then, his scent was undetectable under the asphyxiating crush of Malfoy.
Malfoy had walked up behind him, and took the chair next to him, giving Hermione a nod of greeting before he began pulling out his Charms book, wand, and a long roll of parchment. Harry couldn’t believe he’d forgotten about their group project and having to sit at a table with Malfoy. He groaned silently to himself, and pulled out his own materials. Ron made a face, screwing it up in something resembling disgust, and Harry was glad for his decision to hide Malfoy's and his arrangement from his friends. He glanced over at the blond, and as usual, Malfoy seemed to be ignoring him. He felt a mix of relief and disappointment. Hermione began leading them through the four-person casting, and Harry did his best to pay attention, and keep his eyes off of Malfoy, whose gentle scent of his pheromones was almost mouthwatering in the subtle waves it came in. He wasn’t some sex-addict. He could focus on school, even with the worst possible distraction sitting next to him, smelling like relaxed confidence and cinnamon.
The hall went silent as the first years entered, and Harry finally felt his lips stretching into another genuine smile as the terrified tiny figures marched to the front of the Hall. A few eyes caught on him and widened, but they were swept away with the crowd before they could properly gawk.
Sitting with him at the same table wasn’t nearly as good, but with the gentle trace of his pheromones dancing around the space, surrounded by his two best friends, and the Alpha that had taken care of his heat, Harry felt warm, comfortable, and safe. Despite his constant, grating irritation that Malfoy hadn’t even
“Hello, Harry. How have you been?” Luna was still smiling that wisp of a smile, but the way her eyes stared at Harry, almost
Harry managed to sniffle himself to a stop, and pulled away from his best friend, nodding when she asked if he was okay. He looked at Rose, still sleeping soundly. He thought of a perfect, white-haired baby, sunlight filtering through high windows, shining off of long blond hair, a rose-covered gazebo, and devastated, storm-colored eyes that stared at him as he explained why he was marrying Ginny.
By the end of their second week, Harry was willing to admit that there was something wrong with his potions. They weren’t working like they should. It had been two weeks, and still, his heat hadn’t ended. He still woke up in the middle of the night feeling both too hot, and too cold, too alone, and far too aroused. His appetite was dwindling, and he found himself picking at his food, unable to stomach any of it.
“Here. Hold him.” Malfoy urged, lifting his son, and pushing him on Harry before the brunet could deny him. His arms automatically wrapped around the tiny bundle, and he began rocking, smiling and cooing to Scorpius. Malfoy watched him, arms still slightly outstretched, as if Harry might drop him. Harry met nervous grey eyes, and snickered.
Harry let out a guttural, throaty groan, and grabbed at the alabaster body, demanding more of the skin against him. Draco obliged, his chest pressed to Harry’s, and his teeth scraped at Harry’s neck. He bit gently over the pulse point, and then yanked his head away, his whole body going still.
After classes, Ron practically dragged Harry into Hermione’s room, and sat him down before the fire, eyes wide and eager for the story that didn’t really exist.
what they were doing. There was none of the previous fear that Malfoy would leave him wanting. He was here, for him, to take care of him. Malfoy would take care of him. He was Harry’s Alpha, and he wouldn’t leave him to suffer alone.
The potions classroom was always warm. It always made him sweat a little to stand so close to the flames, to lean over a boiling cauldron. The trickle of sweat down his nape was entirely due to the heat of the room, the flames, the sweltering oppressive humidity that the potions were creating. The shiver up his back when the trace of spice wafted past his nose had nothing to do with Malfoy. The strange empty feeling inside him was due to hunger. He was sure.
“Not everyone has good intentions, Potter.” Malfoy breathed in a tired sigh. Suddenly, Harry thought about what might have happened if Malfoy was more interested in abusing his pheromones. If Harry was under his command. He shivered, and felt as if this version of Malfoy, the Alpha, wasn’t so bad. Harry thought about how he changed when he came near Harry in heat, how he seemed to lose control the same way Harry did. He almost felt guilty for steamrolling him with pheromones, but couldn’t feel too bad about it when Malfoy was clearly not displeased enough to take suppressants. Harry felt his curiosity rise, and it refused to be pushed away.
He turned, looked into familiar, burning eyes, and was thrown headfirst into memories. He'd hoped to put all recollection of this man from his mind, but at the sight of him, he could nearly still feel the warm hands on his skin, the short nails digging into his lower back, and slow, wet kisses that had left him breathless, and aroused.
Harry’s great plan to completely ignore Malfoy’s existence was ruined by their group project. He sat across from Harry nearly every afternoon, practicing his own bit of the charmwork, and then turning to practice with Hermione, while Ron and Harry practiced on the other side of the table. Harry tried not to feel irritated by the way Malfoy was ignoring him right back. He tried to ignore the scent that filled his nose and his head. He tried
"About that, I'm still not quite sure I understand what that means. Why am I dominant? Is it because I'm male?" He asked, directing the question to Hermione.
“Harry?” When Harry opened his eyes to banish the imagery, Draco was closer than he had been, his face filled with worry, his baby held in one arm as his other reached for Harry’s face. Harry jerked away, slapped in the face with the past six years. He’d made a commitment to Ginny. He wore a ring. He’d promised her fidelity.
“I don’t know.” He said quietly. They were the first words Malfoy had spoken directly to him all year, and Harry wanted to strangle him. He disliked that Malfoy’s irritation and moodiness were ruining his post-coital bliss. He might have taken a nap, but with the sour flavor of anger mixing through the room, Harry wanted this over and done with.
“You’re a dad?” Harry asked, sure that it was the wrong thing to take away from his statement, but unable to refrain.
“Yes. Half a month early, due to Astoria’s health. She died shortly after, so at least she got to meet him.” Malfoy shrugged it off, but his face held a remorse that Harry knew would have been matched on his face had the same happened to Ginny.
Malfoy’s voice grew slightly sharper, warning, and Harry held his breath, suddenly realizing how quickly it had been coming. He forced his eyes open and sat up. It was eerily similar to the first time, when he’d kicked Draco out of the bed. He looked down at the grey eyes that stared up at him from the pillow. He’d been lying on Malfoy, using his shoulder as a pillow, his body nearly draped atop the blond’s. His eyes took in everything: messy platinum hair, lips pink and slightly swollen from kissing, bruises across his body where Harry had bitten him back, the thin silvery scars that were more visible in the morning sunlight than they had been at night, and the sheet draped haphazardly over his hips and legs as if it had been an afterthought.
Draco’s face was buried in his neck, his hips slamming up, and Harry felt the sharp sting of teeth before the swelling that filled him. His orgasm slammed through him at the dual sensations and he could do nothing but ride it out, gasping in the scent of his partner.
“‘S’fine. I’m fine.” Harry assured him, offering him a smile. Ron smiled back, his own nose able to tell him Harry was, indeed, fine.
“So? Why does everyone go on about how everyone else smells? Is it… rude to smell too much, or something?” Harry asked, thinking of Ron’s reaction, Malfoy’s. The wall of scent that had hit him when Malfoy had spotted him. He pushed THAT thought back.
“He’s beautiful.” Harry said, reaching out a hand to brush hair from his face. “He’s so small. Was he born early?”
“Well, there’s no help for it. You’ll have to suffer through your heat, on your own. I recommend cold showers and-”
“My word!” Pomfrey lurched to her feet, startled by the sudden intrusion, and her eyes scanned him as she rounded her desk. “Potter. Whatever is the matter?” She waved her wand, shutting the door behind him as he met her halfway down the empty row of beds.
“Thank Merlin.” Ron grumbled, waving a hand through the air as if to clear it. Harry swallowed the lump in his throat and told himself he did NOT want to follow after Malfoy.
"I think I understand. I take it the… tension?... Between you two never got properly resolved?" She sipped delicately at her tea. Harry let out a bark of laughter.
for him that came with it. The way his mind had gone on vacation while Malfoy satisfied him. Had that been on purpose? Harry was suddenly furious at the thought that Malfoy had brainwashed him into having sex. Even if it had been terrific. And comforting. And refreshing.
"What do you mean?" Hermione asked, leaning forward. Her hand had stopped rocking the bassinet, so Harry reached out, and took up the action.
“Guys, what’s wrong? You’ve been acting off all day” Harry finally demanded of his friends as they walked up the stairs after dinner. Ron had been tight-lipped and curt all day, Hermione had been quiet, but kept casting him and Ron glances, as if waiting for a fight to break out. It was putting Harry on edge, and the fact that Malfoy had disappeared halfway through the day only made him more nervous. He knew the reason, but couldn’t help feeling something had gone wrong. That something
He was glad when no one else mentioned his appetite, and as the first years were led to the dormitories by prefects, Harry found his eyes travelling across the hall once more, to find Draco Malfoy.
“Yes. And the potion isn’t working.” He explained. Pomfrey nodded, waving her wand at him, taking diagnostics, pressing her hands to his forehead, feeling his pulse at his wrist. Harry let her work without comment, letting her be the first to break the silence.
“But… That’s the middle of the night. Why are you taking a suppressant in the middle of the night?” She sounded thoroughly flummoxed, and Harry shook his own head, confused.
“I dunno. Sure.” Harry shrugged too, not even sure what she meant. He could already smell Ron, anyway.
“Are you awake, or are we doing this again?” The voice was soft, playful, and familiar. Harry didn’t dare open his eyes as the cold fingers of panic squeezed his chest. It wasn’t a dream. He’d really been having wild ravenous sex with Malfoy all night. “Don’t do that.”
“It’s part of what we are, Potter. Alphas are possessive, and Omega’s tend to cling. That desire you won’t admit you have, to lie here like this all day? It’s completely natural. You don’t have to be embarrassed by clinging to me in your sleep, of all fucking things.” Malfoy drawled, clearly a bit stung over Harry’s reaction in the mornings. Harry felt his cheeks darken at the thought of Malfoy watching him scramble from the bed in a panic twice now.
“Ron… Would you… be willing to help teach Harry about it, with… erm… a demonstration?” Her cheeks went a bit pink again, but Ron looked at her with a lifted brow.
“That’s it exactly. Pheromones are meant to attract and repel, so unless it’s someone meant to be attracted, or kept away, the pheromones won’t really bother them. Like Betas. Alphas and Omegas might fall in love with Betas, but, magically, they aren’t what we’re drawn to, so Betas cannot smell the Pheromones at all. It’s a shame, really… I imagine Betas would smell fantastic. Like fresh parchment, or spring.”
“Ginny… I slept there, with him. I slept with him. I cheated on you. I’m sorry.” Harry said, though he felt no regret. He knew what he’d done was immoral, that he should have waited until after he and Ginny were truly through, but… He didn’t regret it.
As he suffered through his first real unsuppressed heat, he noticed the frequent looks of interest and intrigue from both Alphas and Omegas. There were whispers, he was sure, but he couldn’t seem to hear them over the pounding in his ears when he realized that Malfoy was watching him too. His pupils were too large, his face unreadable, and the sight of it sent Harry right back to that night. He met Malfoy’s stare for several long, weighted seconds, until Hermione pulled his attention away, leaving Harry feeling warmer than before, and equally chilled when he looked back to find Malfoy had looked away, too. He was glad for that. He didn’t like what looking at Malfoy did to his stomach. Or his loins.
As soon as classes were out, Harry hurried back to his room and tried to shower the scent of Malfoy off of himself. He scrubbed his skin until it was red and raw, washed his hair twice, and stood under scalding water for far longer than normal. When he finally felt as though he couldn't possibly stay in the shower longer, he finally got out and toweled himself dry. A good tooth scrubbing, a fresh uniform, and he felt almost as clean as he had that morning. Definitely less sweaty.
doesn’t worry me at all. He’s so wrapped around Granger’s finger it’s a miracle she hasn’t made him propose yet. Smith, on the other hand…” Malfoy’s face went dark, and he looked murderous. Harry felt the dark tinge of his possessive pheromones seeping into the room. “He should know better than to go around propositioning scent-marked Omegas.”
. So perfect. So warm. He was burning up, but the warmth of Malofy’s body was delicious, and just what he needed. Malfoy was manhandling him, teeth scraping against his collarbone as he pushed Harry’s legs out of the way. His fingers were hard and slender, and Harry groaned as one sank into him. Malfoy cursed something in a growling voice, and Harry could tell he was pleased. He
“No. I’m worried you’ll spout something personal, too loudly, just to ruin my life.” Harry retorted. Malfoy gave him a look then. A long look. One that made Harry feel like squirming. It was a look that said Malfoy was reading him. It was strange, knowing Malfoy could read him easier than even Hermione could. Malfoy had seen him as no one else had. He’d known what was inside Harry before even Harry had.
But that had been seven years ago. He closed his eyes, and tried to push the inconvenient memory away. He felt as if he was suffocated, trapped in the lift with Malfoy, and when it stopped, he knew it was cowardly, but he rushed from the confined space, toward the apparation point. He apparated straight home, and was through the door, calling out his arrival for his wife before he slowed. The house was silent. He paused, and listened. He could tell Ginny wasn’t home. He had no idea where she might be, but then, he remembered what she’d asked of him. Shit! He’d forgotten to stop by The Leaky Cauldron! He felt a brief stab of relief that she wasn’t home, that he’d be able to go and come back before she realized he’d forgotten. He didn’t want another row with her. Especially when he felt so troubled after running into Malfoy. He was sure he’d say something across the line of bickering, and right to hurtful.
Malfoy’s lips were demanding as he pushed Harry back into the room, his body hard and his hands firm as he led Harry straight to the bed. Harry sank back without argument and Malfoy climbed on top of him, kissing, tearing clothes off, growling obscene things that Harry was sure should make sense, but he couldn’t seem to understand them. He breathed in the heavy scent of Malfoy and moaned, his own hands pushing at the cloth covering cream colored skin, demanding it be freed. Malfoy yanked his own clothes off next, and before Harry could beg for it, he was filling him, sinking deep into Harry. They both shuddered at the feel of it, and Harry watched Malfoy’s face transform with the same need that was mirrored inside him. He grabbed Harry’s hips so hard his fingers left bruises, but Harry didn’t complain. Harry didn’t complain when teeth scraped his shoulder, or a tongue laved at his neck. He couldn’t seem to remember any words, anyway.
Malfoy stood near the back, arms crossed, eyes flickering around the Eighth Years warily, as if waiting for someone to turn and curse him. Harry found it hard to blame him, and dragged his eyes away, back to McGonagall as she spoke again.
“I heard you had a son! I’m sorry about your wife, though...” Ginny said, suddenly full of curiosity. Harry rolled his eyes, not bothering to voice his opinion on the obvious trap Malfoy had set.
Harry let the words fall like a bomb, watched Hermione’s eyes go wide and sympathetic as she realized what it meant. He watched Ron nearly fall out of his chair, and splutter for a moment trying to find his words.
“No!” Harry shouted, causing Pomfrey to startle at the sudden noise. “Er… No thank you.” Harry waved his hands as if he could erase the idea from her brain. “I appreciate the thought, but… I’m fine.”
“Are you sure? If whoever you’re seeing presently is unable to continue, then I’d be more than happy to-”
Malfoy shifted, kissing his way down Harry’s chest, and the angle of his hips changed, making Harry gasp and arch as something sparked inside him. It had been perfect before, but THAT was heavenly. Malfoy seemed to read the reaction and grabbed Harry’s hips, lifting him slightly, so he could keep hitting that angle. Harry heard his own loud moans, and tried to cover his mouth, to shut out the sound of his pleasure, but slender fingers wrapped around his wrist and pinned his arm above him, forcing him to practically shout his orgasm to the room as he came. His head spun, and his body throbbed, and Malfoy didn’t even pause. He kept thrusting, driving Harry from one peak to the next, making another orgasm crash over him while he still trembled from the first.
"I'm not waiting. Tell me where he is, please." Harry asked, as politely as he could. His heart was racing, and he felt the need to move, to finally head in the direction he wanted.
“I… I don’t want to…” He couldn’t bring himself to say the words, and Pomfrey seemed to take pity on him for a brief moment.
“It’s funny, really. None of them can see you’re not really smiling. Some friends.” Malfoy was next to him, ordering another drink for himself, and his voice was pitched low enough for only Harry to hear. Harry pretended he hadn’t heard, and managed to keep his lips stretched in false happiness. But Malfoy seemed determined to ruin his night further.
"What's up?" He asked, feeling the tingle on the back of his neck as he took in the tea that waited on the kitchen table, the sleeping baby in her bassinet, and the scent of lemony cleaning potion. Hermione clearly didn't need a babysitter.
“But… I don’t really GET pheromones at all! So, Alphas smell good, okay. Omegas smell… However we smell, and those are ‘pheromones’, but that’s just like everyone has a smell! You can’t control someone just by smelling a certain way!” Harry fumed. Hermione sighed.
“They won’t be a problem.” Harry assured her. He really had no idea. He didn’t even know how many Alphas there WERE in Hogwarts. He wondered at that, at how many Omegas there might be, also. He wasn’t sure he really wanted to know.
Malfoy huffed out a breath and looked back over to Harry. Their eyes met, and Harry leaned up to press a soft kiss to his lips, letting instinct guide him for once, letting his worries fall away as he inhaled the scent of Malfoy’s pheromones changing from tense,
“You were asleep when I got in.” Harry murmured, squeezing the baby tighter as he sleepily stretched at the sound of his father’s voice.
“No, I just don’t understand.” Harry denied. “Maybe Dumbledore and Pomfrey didn’t explain it right… Or maybe… I wasn’t… paying attention.”
“His pheromones are softer this year. Like he’s trying to hold them back a bit better than he used to. And he’s being far more polite to everyone. I think he’s just like everyone else, Harry. He’s just trying to heal what’s hurt him, and apologize, in his own way, for his mistakes. I heard one boy call him evil, but that’s not true, is it? He was never evil. Just led into temptation by forces that were stronger than him.” Luna said, her face taking on a serious, somber cast that Harry had rarely seen on her. Her words rang true, and Harry nodded. They’d all come out of the war worse for wear, and Malfoy was no exception. Harry decided not to think too hard about whether Malfoy was a good or bad person. What had happened between them was no one’s fault, really. It would do him no good to worry over it.
Harry leapt at that chance, unable to let the opportunity pass by. He snatched Draco by the neck, and brought their lips together, kissing him more fiercely than he'd ever dared to kiss Ginny. He drug his fingers through the long silky strands of hair, and grabbed handfuls of dark, expensive robes, pushing Malfoy bodily backward. The feeling of kissing him again, finally touching him, breathing in his scent, was a deep relief that seemed to sooth everything wrong in his life.
Harry was silent, turning those words over in his head. He compared what it had felt like to be on suppressants constantly, to now. The thought of no longer being able to read the Alphas as he could now, not being able to know when one was near made a tingle of anxiety thrill through him. It would feel like being blind, he thought, like losing an entire sense he hadn't known he even had. The thought of being so cut off from his pheromones again made him feel sick.
“Sorry, I’ve got to… I’ve got to go.” He smiled apologetically at Hermione and bolted for the door. It slammed shut behind him, and he breathed in the fresh cool air of the hallway. His head cleared of a fog he hadn’t realized had started to enter his thoughts, but his skin was still burning. He headed for his room.
“Mr. Malfoy, join this group here!’ He ordered shortly, before moving on to group the remaining stragglers to underwhelming groups. For the first time in a week, Harry found his eyes sliding to look at Malfoy. Grey eyes met his, and he took in the hard, almost angry expression. Grey eyes flickered to glare at Flitwick, but there really was no help for it. He gathered his things and joined his new group in silence. He slammed his things down at their table and Harry noticed that he was refusing to look at any of them. At
"Fine, I'll accept that, but you still haven't forgiven me. Not really. I'm serious about this. It means a lot to me." Harry admitted, feeling slightly vulnerable with the words.
“The more the merrier.” Harry said, getting a small vengeful happiness from watching Malfoy’s expression twitch as he processed the familiar words. Harry knew from the way his smile stretched to one side in a sneer that he remembered saying those words himself, the last time they’d spoken before he left for France.
His hair had grown out, and Harry was nearly reminded of Lucius, except that Draco wore his hair loose. His face wasn’t the same haughty expression that his father wore, either. It was still hateful, but differently so. More personal. Harry felt his heart squeeze painfully with both guilt, and resentment for the man that stood before him. He looked healthy, minus the dark circles under his eyes. He held a folder in one hand, and Harry noted that he must have had business in the Ministry.
“It was an accident.” He began, but that seemed to set Ron off further. His scent was clogging Harry’s nose, making him uncomfortable, desperate to soothe his friend. Harry’s mind was thrown back to earlier that morning, consoling Draco’s irritation, the urge to comfort him. He felt the same thing with Ron. Something inside him was straining to be free, to
By dinnertime, he was less sure. He was getting a bit of a glare from Zacharias, and Ron was sitting on the other side of Hermione, looking a bit strained. Ginny was at the other end of the table, sitting with Michael Corner, and even from where he sat, Harry could make out the traces of their Alpha pheromones mixing together from more than their proximity. Ron’s scent on Hermione was stronger, and Harry, despite not caring to know the information, was positive that when he’d been distracted with watching quidditch practice between classes that afternoon, they’d snuck off together, and most definitely had NOT been working on the Transfiguration homework they’d claimed to be doing.
“Then you’d best be quiet, hmm?” He said, even as he wrung a groan of pleasure from the pale throat, one of his hands fondling the semi-erection that was already present from his attentions. Draco managed a brief glare at that teasing statement before his eyes fell closed. Harry watched him struggle against the arousal for a moment, and his face slowly warp into rapture. He let his hand slip away, and kissed his way to the soft pink mouth, licking and sucking the lips he’d already gorged on the previous night. It still wasn’t enough. Wet slippery kisses connected them as Draco struggled not to make a sound under Harry’s assault. To his surprise, he’d made barely more than a choked moan before the twitching heat of orgasm met his hand.
Malfoy. The blond let out a warning growl, and Harry lowered his head, looking at Malfoy from under his lashes. The urge to be playful was almost as strong as the urge to squeeze himself closer. Malfoy closed his eyes again and took a deep breath.
“Perfectly normal. You may not be able to smell your own pheromones on me, but after we have sex, you can tell. It makes you want all sorts of weird things.”
“It’s only been a week! That’s three times in five weeks! It’s supposed to only be once a month!” Harry protested while sitting on a bed being looked over by Madam Pomfrey. She did her usual checks, and then stood back, hands on her hips.
“So… Why is it that some people’s smell makes me want to…” He trailed off, waving a hand suggestively. Ron barked out a laugh.
Harry glanced up, involuntarily looking for the eyes he knew would be watching him. Grey eyes looked away when Harry met them, and just seeing Malfoy made anxiety wrench in his stomach. Sure, he and Malfoy had agreed to just… get on with things if this happened again, but now that it was happening, Harry wasn’t sure how to go about it. Was he supposed to invite Malfoy over to his room? Should he send him an owl? Go over and ask if he wanted to work on Transfiguration homework together?
“Like following you around with a beater’s bat and whacking any Alpha that gets too close to you.” Malfoy added. Harry snickered, thinking of Ron.
about it, while being forced to face Malfoy himself, made it seem suddenly too vivid. Malfoy was inside him. He was physically tied to Malfoy until his knot went flaccid, and Harry could stand again. The former seemed far more likely to happen sooner than the latter.
"I didn't actually get to talk to her. Got stuck between Zacharias Smith and Malfoy fighting over whose cock is bigger." Harry uttered under his breath, "Had to wait for them to finish before making a run for it. But I think them pheromone bombing the whole damn hall helped get rid of my heat."
be like. He took a steadying breath. Malfoy wasn’t the only Alpha, Hermione was right. He could just… find one in his own time. Until then, he’d have to learn to control his pheromones.
?” He was horrified. He’d never had sex before, and suddenly he was going to be some sort of sex-crazed maniac? What the hell even WAS being an Omega?
He glanced back to Malfoy’s face and saw that familiar ravenous expression. He felt the length inside of him twitch. Harry wondered what would happen if he just leaned forward and-
“Oh yes, I imagine so. Your pheromones mixed together like that smell rather nice, actually. Like cinnamon candy apples.” She said, taking a deep breath, smiling as she savored it. Harry felt his face go red.
He tried to focus on his lesson, but found his mind wandering nearer the end of the day, almost as if the potion was wearing off faster. He pushed the thought away. It had been five years he’d been taking them, there was no reason they should start to lose their potency NOW.
The hardest part of the move was that naturally, as he rolled, his mind would expect to end on his back, as if he hadn’t apparated. But with the magic that transported them, when he focused, and ignored the vertigo of the short roll, he could arrive with any orientation he liked. So as the brief squeeze of magic ended, he felt as if gravity had reversed, his body expecting to be on its back, instead finding itself upright once more, and kneeling on a soft, plush bed, with a rather dazed looking blond beneath him. Draco shook his head, clearly feeling the same strange sense of altered physics. Harry grinned down at his confounded expression, and tossed his wand easily to the familiar ornate bedside table. It seemed nothing in the Manor had really changed since he’d last been here, which suited him just fine.
“Though, none of them noticed you fucking me, so...” He shrugged, and walked off, his face carefully showing a haughty disinterest in the gathering. Harry felt rage in his belly. How DARE Malfoy say that, out loud, surrounded by Harry’s family, and closest friends? What if someone had heard him? He swallowed his drink in one gulp, set the glass down, and followed after the blond, determined to set some boundaries.
Before he could make up his mind, Malfoy looked pointedly away, pretending to watch the sorting, though his eyes seemed glazed, as though his mind was elsewhere. Harry could just imagine he was thinking about torturing the small children. He looked back to the sorting himself, his lips thin and his brow creased.
“Somethings wrong with my potions.” Harry said without preamble, and only a cursory glance around to make sure the place was empty besides the pair of them.
He woke, gasping and covered in sweat. Between his legs, his own cock hung hard and heavy, and completely useless. He gripped it anyway, and jerked swiftly.
about stopping Malfoy, about taking a potion, or even trying to push him away. It was almost more terrifying than the thought of being held down and forced.
"How long have you known?" He was surprised that the words weren't choked by the fear in his throat. It was as good as an admission. But even if he denied it, if she even suspected, Hermione would be impossible to fool.
He got ready for class and walked down to breakfast with his head held high, pretending to himself that he hadn’t just spent half the night shagging Draco Malfoy, pretending that he couldn’t still smell traces of him on his own skin well after he’d showered, and pretending most firmly that he was not an Omega freshly out of a heat.
“Thank you. Any children of your own, yet?” Harry knew the slight narrowing of his eyes was an indicator of him fishing for something more than the answer to his question, Ginny glanced at Harry with a small, sad smile.
“I was just on my way out. Excuse me.” Harry finally said, turning to head to the lift. Malfoy scoffed wordlessly, but he heard the soft footsteps follow him. Harry swallowed nervously. Why was he here? Why now? It was almost as if he’d been summoned by Harry’s dreams. But that was silly. He probably just had some estate paperwork to file, before he fled back to France, to hide with his wife. Harry felt a twist of jealousy at that thought. He’d married Ginny first, but somehow, Malfoy marrying a woman that had dark hair and green eyes had seemed like a pointed stab in his direction. He remembered letting the wedding invitation he’d received burn over a candle as he watched it smoulder. Ginny had been upset over the scorch mark it had left of the table, and Harry had had to tell her it’d been a howler.
Hermione eyed him. A suspicious look on her face that made Harry instantly wary. It was NEVER good when she got that look.
"I'm serious, Draco. I don't just want empty words." Harry declared. Malfoy glared at him, and shook his arm free.
His feet on the cold tiles was a small comfort, and he followed the short path to his door. The hallway was sure to be cooler, he thought. He crept out into the corridor and took a deep breath. He choked. The air was thick, engulfing him in the most delicious scent he’d ever smelled. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy was in the hall before him, or if he’d appeared from nowhere, but Harry’s eyes found him in an instant. His eyes were dark, mostly pupil, and got darker as Harry watched. The scent grew stronger, and Harry found it hard to breathe. His skin felt raw, his sex ached for release, and when Malfoy took a single step back, as if he was going to leave, Harry found his lips parting.
Lunch brought a much needed reprieve in the form of a note from Hermione, asking him to watch Rose for a few hours after work. She mentioned she'd already spoken with Ginny that morning, so she was planning on staying at practice later. He wrote back promptly, agreeing to babysit, not even bothering to ask why they needed a babysitter. He was eager for the distraction from his own mind.
"Because THEY haven't been avoiding it." Hermione cut in, sounding ready for a lecture. Harry looked at her, unable to smell her the way he could Ron.
"Oh, well, that changes everything! Somebody call the papers, Saint Potter has feelings!" Malfoy barked. Harry stared, not bothering to defend himself from Malfoy's verbal assault. "I suppose, since it means a lot to you, I'll just let it go. Because YOU feel bad, I'll forgive you for absolutely wrecking my life! I'll forget everything that happened, and we can pretend we never STOPPED hating each other! How's that, Potter? We can stick our heads in the sand, and forget anything EVER happened. Does that work for you? Merlin knows we have to cater to whatever works best for YOU! In fact, I don't know why I even came back! I have no idea what I was thinking. Things were fine as they were. Should I be gone by morning, or do I have until the end of the week to get back to France? Is France still good for you? I can go farther. I hear New Zealand is nice. Or maybe I'll be the first wizard to build a mansion on the moon,  just so I NEVER have to see your stupid face, EVER again! It would actually be perfect. I could get a new wife, and the moon would be so cold, I wouldn't even notice the difference in sleeping alone! FUCK you, Potter, and FUCK your apology, and FUCK your sudden need to be absolved of being a piece of shit!"
“I… erm… I’m sure they told me all sorts of things, but… I didn’t really… hear most of it.” He admitted to his friends. He’d been too busy being horrified at the time that he was an abomination.
He was still sitting at the Slytherin table, fork in hand, smiling a saucy, playful smile at Theodore Nott, and pushing food around on his plate. Harry didn’t think too hard on what Malfoy not eating might mean, either. He knew Malfoy had his own scars from the war, his own nightmares. It never did him any good to dwell on which might be the worst, on which he wakes up from the most frequently.
“Fine. I’ll be fine. Just a bit… Off.” Harry said with a smile that he was sure looked more like a grimace. Ron gave him a sympathetic look, and Hermione retook her spot. Ron leaned over to mutter something she wouldn’t hear, but stopped, eyebrows drawing together. His lips parted to speak, but Harry watched him take a breath in, staring at Harry, confused. Harry swallowed nervously, and wanted to sink through the floor.
“You… what? But… You’re not queer, Harry. Just tell me what really happened?” Ginny denied. Harry sighed, and sank back into the chair he sat on, feeling as if the conversation were tedious, even though he knew it was necessary.
“Ginny…” He sighed her name, and closed his eyes, rubbing the bridge of his nose. He didn’t want to hurt her, but she was making it very difficult. “Just… go be happy. However you want to be happy. Just do it without me. You can keep the house if you want, or sell it. You can demand alimony, hell, you can even drag my name through the papers if it’ll make you feel better. But… this is over. I’m in…” He had to swallow, and felt his cheeks heat as the words came to his lips. “I’m in love with Draco, and I’m tired of pretending I’m not.”
His lips were warm, soft, and followed by sharp teeth. Harry hissed at the painful snap, but as Scorpius shifted in his arms again, he pulled away from the kiss. Draco frowned at him, and Harry smirked. He stood to place the sleeping infant back in his crib, staring at him a moment, filled with a warm love and hopefulness that he hadn’t felt in years.
The familiar voice sent an automatic shiver up his spine, and a matching wave of sheer panic through his chest. It couldn't be.
“No. Don’t ask for help while smothering me with your pheromones and looking all vulnerable.” Malfoy answered, eyes cracking open to peer at Harry. “It’s hardly fair.”
"No! Not at all! I'm just saying… I'd understand if you had. Or, if you want to, I dunno, actually try being friends with Malfoy. I think… I can't believe I'm about to say this, but… I think he might ACTUALLY be good for you." Hermione looked apologetic, begging him not to be cross with her.
"I'm not leaving until you forgive me." He warned, glaring at Malfoy. "Whatever it takes, I don't want to leave with you still hating me." Harry knew it was a dangerous offer. He could demand anything as penance. The evil smirk on his face said he knew it, too.
But still, when he walked through the Ministry corridors, he felt as if his face was made of cardboard. A fake, half-smile rationed out to every coworker, but he couldn’t force the expression onto his face when his work took him to the courtrooms. They always brought up memories. It was, afterall, where it had all started going downhill.
“Ogden’s.” He ordered from Neville’s wife at the bar, glad that she was a quiet type. She nodded, and poured his drink with a quiet smile. He offered her one of his rare, real smiles, and turned to let his fake smile stretch his lips as he observed his party. Ron was already well drunk, and Hermione was dotingly carting him around the room, rolling her eyes with good humor as he chatted far too loudly with every person they passed.
The air tasted of him, smelled of sex and Alpha pheromones, and Harry could smell the darker scent underneath. He knew without being told that it was the oncoming rut that Malfoy had been warning him of. He felt the panic slithering in his chest start to climb up his throat as he scented the powerful aroma of them, saw the scars, evidence of his own past sins. Everything fell down on him at once, and he rolled away, stumbling from the bed, his hands trembling.
there, but he found his feet carrying him across the hall. He stood before the door, eyeing the knob that looked just like his. He lifted a hand, about to knock, when the sound of a door opening and closing made him turn.
It had been three days. Harry had been suffering for three bloody days. He was finally ready to give in and ask for a sleeping potions, but on his way to the infirmary, he was stopped by an unlikely figure.
He had dark brown eyes and wavy sandy blond hair. Harry realized with a bit of a shock that he was rather attractive. He had a strong jaw, and high cheekbones. His lashes were thick, his lips were pink, and he smelled delicious. Harry swallowed dryly.
He wandered back down to his next class, Charms, and sat through it, barely able to listen. He was hard under the desk, and glad for the robes that hid his unfortunate erection.
The soft whisper startled him, and he spun in his seat to see Draco coming through the door of Scorpius’ room.
He sat at breakfast, and was doing his level best to ignore the sudden rush of scents that surrounded him, when Ron collapsed onto the bench next to him, bringing that familiar tangy smell with him. Harry held his breath for a moment, and then focused on breathing normally as he ate his eggs. Ron piled a plate with his usual fare and got three mouthfuls shoveled in when he turned to Harry.
too warm to be wearing so many clothes. He couldn’t see any problem with Smith’s approach, except that it was rather slow. He thought of how Malfoy had just grabbed him and got on with things. He rather liked that, he thought.
“Alright.” Harry agreed, though he hadn’t a clue how she expected him to make things hard for THEM. He’d be the one suffering, afterall.
“Fine!” Malfoy gave up and sighed heavily as if suffering Harry’s inquisitiveness. “It… it feels wrong. I HAVE taken them before, when I needed to get somewhere private when a rut began… it felt like being castrated. I couldn’t feel anything, couldn’t
"Tea?" Hermione asked politely, sitting at the table, keeping her voice low as she rocked the sleeping baby.
He jerked his mind abruptly away from that though. He wasn’t in heat. He wasn’t desperate. There was no reason to initiate further intimacy with the blond. Even if it made his own cock twitch with interest and warmth pool in his stomach. He cast his mind around for the subject they were speaking about before he mentioned feeling Malfoy’s cock inside him.
“Alright. Off you go, Potter. Come back if… if you need anything.” She offered, but he knew there was nothing she could actually do to help him. He was just going to have to burn alive.
his room was across the hall. He forced his feet to move, eyes darting to his door, to safety, and privacy, and-
“Alright, so, you can usually smell each other, just by being in proximity, but if emotions run high, or during a heat -or rut-, or if you’re developed enough to utilize your pheromones at will, then the scent gets stronger.” She nodded at Ron, who stared at Harry a bit strangely, as if he was concentrating. For a moment, Harry wasn’t sure what was supposed to happen, until he took a breath, and suddenly the air seemed thicker. Ron’s scent permeated the room, and Harry could taste it on his tongue, and almost feel the warmth of it.
The promise sent a thrill through Harry, and he pulled Smith closer, deepening the kiss. He didn’t like hearing about Malfoy while Smith was kissing him. It did strange things to his insides, made his stomach feel all twisty and his heart pound erratically. He focused on kissing the blond in front of him, and couldn’t quite feel sorry even though he must have been practically suffocating him with Omega pheromones.
an indicator that people are fucking, but it’s a good bet, since most won’t tolerate that level of pheromones if they’re not either fucking, or too young to control it.”
Harry let his lips trail sideways, licking the pale solid line of his jaw, feeling the scrape of nearly invisible blond stubble against his tongue. His throat tasted of salty sweat and the spicy essence of his Alpha. It nearly burned his tongue with how sharp it was, and Harry tasted lower. His chest was less intensely flavored, more like the cinnamon Harry had come to associate with him. The thin whie scars that Harry’s tongue traced were barely discernible, his nipples were a small hard nib of resistance that slid under his tongue, and Harry teased him with a nip of his own teeth, making Malfoy his and thrust his hips upward. Harry groaned at that, distracted from his tasting by the wave of heat that surged through him with that movement. When it ebbed, and he looked back at Draco, he knew he needed to taste his mouth again, the flavor of them mixed there.
He hesitated for only a brief, breathless moment, staring down into an eager silver stare, and dismissed the stab of guilt he felt. THIS was what he wanted. He could sort the rest out after he’d fixed this. He absolutely could not let this slip through his fingers again.
“Oh yes. You probably can’t smell it very well, since, well, it’s coming from you. But it does smell lovely. Almost like you were made to go together.” She said it wistfully, and Harry felt a shiver go up his spine at those words. He knew she was just being Luna, but the thought made a tingle of apprehension pass through him. He couldn’t quite place what bothered him so much about her rambling thoughts, though.
when you started developing?” Hermione seemed just as confused as Harry, but on a different subject. Harry felt his cheeks tinge pink as he recalled the lectures he’d had to suffer through.
“I did. I’ve… been taking suppressant potions.” Harry admitted. He was lucky he’d had Pomfrey’s reaction to learn from, as Hermione nearly shrieked, and launched herself upright out of her chair. Ron winced, and looked startled. Harry smiled knowingly at him.
“Master Potter, Master Malfoy is expecting you. Right this way.” She led him through the familiar house, and as Harry followed, looking around, he felt constant pangs of nostalgia. His first few times walking through here, he’d been reminded of the war, but now, he was reminded of a more recent past. He was reminded of arguments, whispered desires, and angry, desperate wanting.
“Well, they give you a mattress and a bucket to piss in, then?” He asked crudely, knowing the language would wind Hermione up, and make Ron laugh. It did both, and Ron led the way into his own room before Hermione could start on a rant. Harry followed gladly, listening to Ron’s eager enthusiastic tour of the small space that was his own. There was a Chudley Cannons poster already hanging on the wall, and a pair of large squashy looking chairs by the fire. Harry looked around the room with curiosity, comparing it to his own, and voicing aloud his thoughts.
Malfoy’s fingers were suddenly squeezing his leg, a bit too tightly, and Harry heard the angry growl, smelled the possessive wash of pheromones Malfoy released. He looked up and found Malfoy staring at him, face dark and furious.
it. Pomfrey had been right. An Alpha worked miracles to end his heat. It was easier if he thought of him as ‘an Alpha’ rather than Malfoy. Somehow it being
“Well, that just warms the heart.” He did his best to ignore the mocking drawl, but the blond head ducked into his field of view, getting a better look at the infant.
been trying to be polite… or at least absent enough to avoid conflict. He thought of the quiet way he spoke with Hermione during their charms work, the way he’d stayed after waking up that first time. He thought of Malfoy, sitting here, inside of him, having a chat like it was the most normal thing in the world. He wanted to try overcoming the past, too.
"If you really can't stand fucking me, Potter, go hide in the infirmary next time you're in heat. Or learn to control your pheromones. It's not as though I enjoy being drawn to you from the other side of the castle." Malfoy huffed.
“We’ll wake Scorpius!” He warned, even as Harry’s hands showed no mercy, tugging the simple robes he’d donned open, and sliding one hand up to cover his mouth. Sharp shards of silver pierced him as he smirked down at the muffled face. He relished the look of indignation, and knew he couldn’t bear to let him up, even if they risked disturbing the baby.
The first potion took effect, sending a wave of relief through him like warm water. The cold water on his face washed away the sleep and sweat, and woke him up the rest of the way.
When the door shut, he took a tentative breath and found Malfoy’s pheromones stronger than they’d been the past two weeks, but nowhere near the usual crush they were during his past heats. The cinnamon scent tingled in his nose and made him lick his lips. He wanted to taste Malfoy’s skin, and see if he
“Huh? Why?” Harry asked, leaning back, shuddering slightly as he felt the knot slip deeper into him. Draco made a noise as if he felt it, too, and his hands slid down Harry’s hips to squeeze at his thighs. He bit his lips and stared up at Harry, considering his answer before he spoke, eyes narrowed with suspicion.
“I can’t. I took too many, and I’ve built up a tolerance. It’s also why I’m… going into heat so much.” Harry muttered, looking away. The scent of disgust faded and left Harry in a swirl of comforting warmth. It made his lips loose. “It’s why you’ve never smelled me before… I used them constantly, and… apparently it’s destabilized my natural cycle.”
"If you won't take suppressants, and I have no idea when the next heat might come… this will probably happen again." Harry warned. Malfoy gave him a look of mild annoyance.
“Maybe it wasn’t on purpose?” Hermione spoke up, brow furrowed. “Maybe he’s never had to experience a dominant Omega before.” She said it in a whisper, and Harry wondered about that. Was it possible he was affecting Malfoy the same way Malfoy affected him? It was a strange thought. Was he able to smell Harry’s irritation, too? Was he plagued by the same urge to play nice? Harry hoped not.
“If you need an Alpha, I’m… willing to help you.” His eyes flicked down to Harry’s mouth, and Harry wondered if he was releasing more of that minty scent on purpose, or if it was just a reaction to Harry’s heat. He noticed that Ginny stayed far from him when she noticed, and besides Malfoy, he hadn’t encountered another Alpha he might be compatible with. It was strange, knowing Smith was coming onto him,
Harry didn’t realize he was holding his breath until his lungs started to burn, and he was forced to let it out, and take in a new lungful of air. He immediately smelled it. Faint, as though it was a shampoo rather than his natural scent, but definitely there. Sharp, biting, and it lingered on his tongue when it swept out to wet his lips. Harry looked back at Flitwick, doing his best to hold his breath through the rest of class.
“Those potions… they’re… temporary relief. Intended to give you time and space to set your affairs straight before the heat, not… NOT intended to entirely suppress it! And pheromone suppressants are for emergency use only! In the case of an Alpha trying to overpower you, for instance. Suppressant potions are not meant to be used DAILY!” She was nearly shouting by the end, and Harry grimaced leaning back.
“So, if I were to learn how to control it, I could make people do things?” Harry asked, already imagining his revenge.
“Oh, erm… thanks?” Harry managed to articulate after a moment, and Luna’s eyes widened as she looked back at him from where she’d been staring into space.
Draco caught up to the pair as Harry felt a stab of melancholy into his very soul. He hadn’t even realized that he had feelings beyond the sexual for Malfoy until AFTER he’d agreed to marry Ginny.
“‘Party etiquette’, Potter? Really? What, you’re worried I’ll ask some embarrassing question, or spill my drink on someone?” He sneered. Harry mimicked his mocking expression.
“Why couldn’t he just send it with the owl?” Harry grumbled, pulling on his boots, and running a hand through his messy hair in a futile attempt to tame it.
“Everyone’s here, good. We can get started.” Hermione said, her eyes landing over Harry’s shoulder. Harry turned, and suddenly wanted to slide under the table and hide.
. Because Malfoy was back on top of him, pressing Harry’s thighs to his chest, sliding back into him for so long it seemed an eternity, and then he was moving, sending sparkling pleasure and heat racing through Harry’s veins. It was everything he’d wanted. It was more than he’d even
Harry nodded, looking away. He didn’t care for the way being surrounded by the smell of his friend made him feel. It
As he popped open the last fastening, and his erection sprang free, he shoved parchment, quills, and desk clutter clattering to the ground, pushed Malfoy down onto his back, and leaned over him. He shoved expensive fabric out of his way as he pressed his bare sex to Malfoy. He groaned, and paused, enjoying the warmth of skin against his, and already feeling too close to finishing. He pulled his wand from his disheveled robes, and cast a quick, wordless charm, one he’d learned before he’d even thought to marry Ginny, one he hadn’t used since the last time he’d been so close to Draco. Malfoy gasped at the sudden cool wetness, and Harry smirked, dropped his wand to the desk, and held his cock steady as he lined himself up.
“Well, typical marking is done with a bite, so the pheromones mingle with yours, literally making you emit theirs, until it wears off, or is replaced. Usually between three and six months, depending on the severity of the mark. It leaves a
“I thought these were your friends, Potter?” Malfoy’s sarcastic drawl brought Harry’s mind abruptly back to the present. The summer night air was warm around them, and he could hear the muffled noises of the party behind the door at his back, the soft drizzle of rain just beyond the cover they stood under. “Still keeping secrets from them? Why? ashamed?”
“I see.” Was all he said, though, and Harry didn’t like the way his cunning eyes flickered between them. “Well, Potter, if you stop by Sunday, Scorpius will likely need a chew toy.”
“Not necessarily. If you were anything but an Omega, Potter, I’d have walked out the minute you ran from the bed.” He muttered. Harry stared up at the side of his face, trying to determine if he was joking or not. Draco sighed, looking back at him with a look of suffering.
“Oh my. Are you experiencing a heat presently?” She asked, pulling him to sit on a bed at the end of a row, as far from the doors as possible. She pulled the curtains around them, and Harry knew now that they were warded against eavesdropping. He relaxed slightly.
"How can I help you, Potter?" Malfoy asked, lacing his fingers together atop the desk. His face was a carefully crafted mask of polite interest. Harry swallowed, still recalling the absolute fury and betrayal that his face could show.
He was determined to keep Malfoy from seeing just how strongly his pheromones affected him, even if it killed him.
"Binky." Malfoy said, confusing Harry for a moment, and startling him as a house elf stepped forward, huge eyes staring up at Malfoy eagerly. "I have business. Feed Scorpius if he wakes up. Come get me if there are any problems, don't worry about interrupting, and don't bother knocking." Malfoy ordered, waiting just long enough for the elf to nod, and disappear inside the room, before he led the way down the hall. Harry was surprised when they stopped at the study, one door down from the bedroom. He’d been inside once or twice, but never for long. As Malfoy took a seat behind the large, carved desk, he found himself appreciating the gesture of formality. It showed that he was trying to respect Harry's decision to stay faithful to his wife.
The second door revealed a lavatory, small, intimate, with a sink, toilet, and standing shower. Maybe the extension charms only went so far, he thought to himself amusedly. He went back out to the sitting room and looked around more, seeing bookshelves to either side of the door, half-filled with quidditch and defense books, and half-filled with knick-knacks that Harry thought looks oddly familiar. He stared at one spindly silver gadget a moment before he could place it. It was one of the curiosities that had been in Professor Dumbledore’s office. He felt tears choke him up at the memory in such a strange place, and traced a finger over it, wondering what it did. At his touch, it let out a small puff of dark blue smoke. Harry gave a small sad smile and took a deep breath, pushing the emotion far back, where it couldn’t be seen. He went back out into the hall and plastered a huge smile on his face as he saw Ron standing at Hermione’s door, arguing to get in.
“Ron, sit down, and stop shouting. Let Harry explain, for goodness sake.” She sat next to Ron, keeping her hand on his arm, as if holding him in place. Ron huffed in several angry breaths, and turned a sour expression on Harry.
“But you left last time.” Harry said, his voice more accusing than he’d intended. He wondered if, since Malfoy seemed to know everything else about him, if he knew it had left Harry feeling empty and cold.
His cheeks were too warm, but he refused to admit to himself that he was blushing just from speaking to Malfoy. A soft touch drew his eyes, and he looked down to watch the tips of Malfoy’s fingers skim his thigh, as if he were trying to soothe Harry’s discomfort. Harry blurted out more.
“Maybe you should talk to him, Harry? He might have some insight about being a dominant that could help you. You’re still struggling with controlling your pheromone levels, right?”
"Master Potter! Master Draco is not expecting company! I'll let him know you've arrived if you please will wait!" The familiar elf was practically running after him as he strode up the grand staircase. He paused, taking pity on the creature, as it huffed for breath.
if Malfoy was pissed off about Harry unintentionally releasing pheromones. He didn’t care if Malfoy was irritated that he could probably smell Harry from across the room.
“It woke me up, so I took a potion to stop it. Nothing else helps.” He shrugged. Pomfrey looked confused for a moment more, then her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
Harry felt his face go scarlet at the insinuation that he’d wank so hard he’d hurt himself. Madam Pomfrey didn’t give him time to feel properly horrified, though. “I’m sure Professor McGonagall will be able to tactfully excuse you from class for the next week.”
It would explain the way he was suddenly getting heavy-lidded stares thrown his way, and to his horror, Micahel Corner of all people asking him on a date. He’d declined as politely as he could, and tried not to smell Ginny’s scent on him. She smelled similar to Ron, and to Harry’s horror, it was nearly as appealing as Malfoy’s had been. Michael’s scent, mixed with hers, had set him on edge. He knew they were sleeping together in an instant, and rather wondered if Ginny knew he’d asked Harry out. Michael smelled like citrus and body odor, and Harry wondered why on EARTH he had even approached him. Harry could tell by his scent that he wasn’t interested in men. Zacharias Smith, on the other had, kept giving him strange looks. And Harry dreaded being asked out by
“I was at Malfoy Manor.” Harry ran a hand self-consciously through his hair. He’d done his best to tidy himself up before he’d left, but he knew he must still look a mess. He hadn’t bothered to do up all of his buttons, he knew his lips must be swollen, his usually messy hair was a disaster, and he feared he smelled like the other man. Like sweat, and sex, and expensive cologne. He’d been pulled back in for a last minute tumble by a supine blond when he’d tried to give a simple farewell. He knew their last coupling would be lingering on his skin, the sweat would be making his hair even more chaotic. But even here, in front of his wife, at the memory of the night he’d had, the dark morning hours spent satisfying his languid lover, his cock gave an exhausted twitch.
“Not yet. Maybe someday soon. I’m not sure I’m ready to quit the Harpies just yet.” She answered. Malfoy’s smirk widened, and Harry knew he’d read SOMETHING in her answer. From that simple statement he couldn’t POSSIBLY have been able to tell that it had been a spot of argument for years between them now.
“Yeah. It’s still really strange, actually.” Malfoy gave a small, private smile, and Harry’s heart fluttered at the sight. It was a loving smile, and one that made him long for the past. “Doesn’t feel quite real unless I’m holding him.”
“Sorry, I didn’t… Harry, are you alright?” Hermione was in front of him, and Harry met her brown eyes, frowning.
Having his theory that Malfoy was similarly affected by his hormones made Harry's stomach clench with prideful enjoyment. Being dominant, Malfoy was the most powerful Alpha in the whole school, and it pleased Harry that his heat pheromones rendered him useless. Harry willfully ignored that he was made useless himself by Malfoy's.
“Not jealous. Possessive. Alphas do not like to share. Hearing you talk about jumping into bed with someone else… it makes me want to mark you.” Malfoy muttered. Harry looked at him with confusion. He recalled some fuzzy memory about that word, but didn’t know why Malfoy said it like it was taboo.
“Thanks, Luna.” He gave her a smile, and left her to her confusing research. She sent him off with a wave, and Harry found Ron and Hermione at the back of the library, waiting for him.
Whatever Ron had been about to say was lost to the sudden understanding that breaks across his face, and Ron leaned back slightly, but was still close enough to whisper.
"About you and Malfoy?" She asked, and waited for his single brief nod before she answered. "Hmm… I think… I first noticed… that time Ron and I were over at yours, and he showed up. You hid it really well, but… there were signs. The way you kept looking at each other, for one. It wasn't exactly NICE, but it was different from how you used to do. Then there were the little comments that seemed like inside jokes that neither of you actually found funny." Hermione answered, thinking back. Harry easily recalled the night she meant. It had been the first of a few similar evenings, where Malfoy had joined him and his friends for a very strange gathering… though it had been entirely unplanned.
“If you’re going to sleep with someone, couldn’t you pick someone better? If you had someone else, then it wouldn’t be such a problem with him.” Ron insisted. Harry shook his head.
“She’s making a mess of your hand, Potter.” Malfoy observed. Harry smiled down at the sloppy mess of his hand.
.” Hermione hissed, giving each of them a reproachful glare that had them turning their heads back to place, each with an amused smirk at her return to Prefect-like behavior.
“You can’t… Ron almost caught on last time. He’ll lose his mind if he finds out.” Harry managed to explain. Malfoy growled in displeasure.
“Harry, make sure you stop by the Leaky Cauldron after work. Neville owled that he has something for you.” Ginny called through the kitchen as Harry hurried to button his Auror’s robes. He was running late, as usual, and was already in a poor mood, from his bad dreams.
“So an Omega interested in Draco, or an Alpha interested in me can tell, but not one whose… uninterested?” He felt a bit like an idiot trying to articulate it simply, but Luna nodded.
“I have to go.” Harry announced, turning to flee. It was too much. It was all too much. The worst part was that he knew, if he’d never married Ginny, if Malfoy had never moved to France, their hurricaine of an affair would have ended in flames, and Harry would not be here, wanting a child that wasn’t his, and a man that he’d pushed aside. The irony was another slap to the face. He’d married Ginny, hoping she could give him a family, give him kids, knowing Malfoy never could, and now, everything he’d wanted was in Malfoy Manor.
“You’re an Alpha.” He didn’t realise he'd said it aloud until the words were there, hanging between them. Ron gave him a funny look, and his eyes went up and down Harry, as if searching for an imposter. Hermione looked up from her book, and her head tilted as she eyed Harry with a similar puzzled stare.
“So, Ron says you’re an Omega?” Hermione began, getting right to the point. “But I don’t see how that’s possible. You should have presented during puberty, not NOW.”
Harry flinched, and took a moment to gather his thoughts, and courage. He took strength from Hermione's calm acceptance, and Malfoy's obvious emotion.
He heard the cooing before they entered the room, and he walked into the sight of Draco with a baby on his lap, hands holding feet, playing gently with the tiny form. Harry felt his heart squeeze painfully at the sight, and Draco looked up with a warm smile still lingering on his face that made the heartache that much worse for Harry.
He lifted his arms and wrapped them around Smith’s neck, pulling him in, being bold and not caring if they were in the middle of the corridor. At that moment he wanted nothing more than those soft-looking lips to meet his. They were warm, too. The kiss was hesitant, gentle, and Harry felt the hand that cupped his face, steadying them both.
“Really?” Her voice held both despair and hope, and Harry nodded sagely, meeting her blue gaze with honesty.
“Alright…” Ginny gave him a small smile, and Malfoy a tight-lipped one. She wasn’t positive they wouldn’t fight, but she didn’t want to make a scene. Harry smirked to himself as he finally had his back to the whole room. Sometimes, being so familiar with someone made it easy to say the right thing to diffuse a potential disaster.
“That’s what Hermione said, but… All night? What on earth were you talking about so long?” Ginny asked, crossing her arms petulantly. Harry swallowed nervously. He could beat around the bush, but it had never really been his style. He preferred the blunt approach.
“Nothing’s wrong, Gin. I promise I won’t let him goad me into a fistfight.” Harry promised with a forced chuckle. He couldn’t let that happen for multiple reasons. “Just want a quick word about party etiquette.”
“You will do NO SUCH THING.” She snapped. Harry was stunned. He’d never seen her quite so angry before. “You will go through your heat WITHOUT potions, Mr. Potter! And you will cease taking the pheromone potion altogether. I HOPE for your sake, that your resistance to them wears down as you don’t take them, so that
“Why not? Jealous?” Harry let out a short laugh that morphed into a hiss of pain as Malfoy’s nails dug into his skin, sharp and surprising.
him. He wanted it. His head tilted, offering Malfoy more space, and Malfoy’s teeth became more rough. He definitely left a bruise on Harry’s shoulder. He nipped at one of Harry’s oversensitive nipples, drawing a shout of surprise from the brunet before he soothed it with a swirl of his wet tongue and the soft suction of his lips. Malfoy kissed, licked and bit him all over, taking his time to lightly mark and explore the body under him. Harry writhed, enjoying every single touch, wanting more,
It was too hot in his room. He couldn’t sleep. Masturbating, he couldn’t even finish. He wanted to peel his skin off, just so it would stop sweating. He’d even visited Pomfrey and she had outright refused to let him suppress it. Her suggestion had been to sleep with an Alpha, and get it over with sooner. Harry thought of Malfoy, and also refused immediately. So he was left to burn to death in his bedroom, trying not to go stir crazy from the urge to touch himself, even though he knew it wouldn’t help.
“You slept there? What, were you drunk, or something? You don’t smell like you spent the night drinking…” Ginny observed, leaning in slightly to give him a sniff. Harry met her gaze steadily.
“Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy.” He answered with a completely straight face, Harry wasn’t sure how he managed.
“I… What? What do you mean?” Harry asked, his heart racing, and dread filling him. Ron couldn’t possibly-
“No, I… I can feel it. Just stop.” Harry pleaded, his face blazing with mortification at admitting such a detail. Malfoy’s laughter stopped immediately, though. Harry decided to count it as a win.
He didn’t hear Malfoy leave, but when he was done scrubbing himself raw and swallowing potion, and peeked into his bedroom, there was no sign of the blond except sheets still scattered across the floor where he’d fallen. Harry took a deep, calming breath, and found the air in his room had been thoroughly tainted by that awful burning scent. He threw his window open wide, and still in his towel, hunted down his wand to cast air-freshening charms. He refused to admit how much better he felt. Sore, as if they’d scrapped rather than had sex, but he was obviously no longer in heat. He marvelled at that a moment, and checked himself over in the mirror with a frown, making sure Malfoy hadn’t left any visible evidence of their surprise coupling behind.
“We… er… usually sleep through this part, don’t we?” He commented rhetorically, trying for humor in the humiliating situation. He knew, logically, that Malfoy had knotted inside him during their previous couplings. He knew that was what was stretching him to the limit, and keeping Malfoy from running off immediately. Now, however, being able to feel it, to
“Not even a little. Just taking it easy the first time, so you don’t cry.” Harry retorted, as he picked up his wand. Draco’s eyes followed the motion with sharp interest, and Harry grinned down at him. “In fact, I’ve learned a few new things while you were away. Though… None of them from marriage…” Harry mused, shoving his hand under Malfoy’s back, to wrap his arm around the slim frame in a firm hold. He took a single soft breath to steady himself, focused, and rolled himself sideways, pulling Draco with him into the uncomfortable vice of apparation.
you might be able to actually help yourself.” She took a short quick breath and straightened her spine as if putting that bit behind her and facing the next sentence with dignity.
He forced his fingers to close over the glass door knob. The edges of the rosette shape dug into his palm, and he twisted, pushing the door open, and peered inside. The room was filled with warm dark wood furniture. A dark red sofa and low coffee table took up most of the small space of the first room, and as the door opened, Harry saw a wave of light go with him, candles lighting themselves, a fire bursting to life in the fireplace. It was still sunny out, but the only natural light coming into the room came through the crack of an open door to the left. Harry stepped into the room, closed the door behind him, and went left.
! Pay attention!” Hermione chastised, for the fourth time in as many minutes. Harry shook his head and forced his eyes back up, doing his best to listen to Hermione’s words through the haze that was making it difficult to think. Malfoy was seated right across from him, and he was definitely angry. Harry could
"I think I'm in love with you." The words were out of his mouth before he'd even thought about saying them aloud. It was too late to take them back, though, and he watched as Malfoy's anger seemed to grow, his words only acting as fuel on a fire of indignation and resentment.
Harry mechanically did his Monday paperwork, and went for his noon lunch. He was eager for the afternoon. It all seemed to go faster after lunch. Then he could go home. And… and when he thought about it, he wasn’t sure why he was in such a hurry to get home. Nothing terribly exciting would happen. But it was a goal, and he could achieve it.
“Painful. Unstoppable. Exhilarating until you can’t think anymore.” He corrected. Harry felt the idea tingling inside him still, arousing him. He couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to smell Draco in a rut. It was already overwhelming to encounter his pheromones when Harry himself was in heat.
The familiar spicy scent sent a shiver up his spine, and his thoughts glazed a little further. He wasn’t sure if the scent was coming from his own skin, or elsewhere in the castle, but it was getting stronger.
The same voice that had ruined his afternoon was back, and he was worried for a moment that he was beginning to hallucinate. But when Ginny wheeled them around to face the new partygoer, he felt his heart skip a beat. He couldn’t be here. The smile slipped, unbidden from his face, and he did his best to mask whatever it was he was feeling with irritation.
“Scorpius, this is Harry Potter. Potter, this is my son.” Malfoy introduced, sitting the baby upright in his lap, for a more formal introduction. Harry grinned. He couldn’t help it. Babies always got right into his heart.
"If you HAD been there, Ron, you would have been in the same boat as him. Malfoy is dominant, isn't he?” Hermione inserted the cold logic that Harry found amusing. More amusing was Ron’s face. He looks affronted that Hermione wouldn’t cater to his fantasy of being immune to the pheromones of a stronger Alpha, as if being non-dominant was an insult. Hary snickered, but quickly stopped when Hermione glared at him and asked. “You were alright, though? It didn’t… upset you?”
know what we’ve been at, hm? Will that make you happy?” Harry mocked as he scooted off of the bed and pulled the sheet with him. He wrapped it around himself for modesty as he walked toward the bathroom.
