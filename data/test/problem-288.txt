Draco slid his forearm up, pressing it down over Harry’s throat. Harry’s survival instinct final kicked in, fear jolted through him and he struggled in Draco’s grip. He scrambled for his wand but it was nowhere to be found. He must have dropped it on the floor.
Harry couldn’t talk.
Draco grinned.
“Yes,” Harry agreed, thinking anything was better than being like this. Besides, he’d have to be an idiot to try anything here. It was far too well guarded.
Draco kept his eyes down, not wanting to know which faces were watching the display, which ones would never look at him the same again.
“It’s all that time I spent around the bastard.”
“Look, Malfoy, I only came here to—“
“Of course I do it’s just…he’s so distant. How am I supposed to trust him if I he won’t even see me?”
Harry frowned.
“It sounds like a trashy romance novel.” She brought the cauldron back over and knelt down next to him on the floor. “We seriously need to find a better place to do this, Harry, it’s murder on my tights.”
“I think you should try.”
He looked around for a coffee machine. A shining Costa coffee machine sat in the corner of shop. Unfortunately, it was wrapped in yellow out of order tape.
“You look spectacular.”
“You don’t have to call me that, you know.”
Draco adjusted his hair in the mirror, flicked his wand at his trousers, cleaning them perfectly, turned, and walked out.
“What’s it for?”
Malfoy gave a long sigh.
“Shut up, I am not in love with you. I could never love a fucking monster like you...”
“How do you usually wank?” Draco asked.
“I don’t know!”
Draco knew exactly how to undo him. He was pushing himself back on Draco’s cock now, getting himself so close. Draco pushed his hips forward and started fucking him against the wall, slamming Harry’s hips up against the tiles, hitting his prostate with every stroke.
“I’d say they don’t pay me enough for this, but no one’s even paying me anymore.”
He was hopeful for the first time in weeks.
“Well go on then, Potter. Don’t be shy.”
“Certainly, as soon as the trains start running again. I believe the first one is at 9am.”
“What else is new?”
“It’s a castle, Potter, it creaks, calm down.”
Draco’s mouth twitched into an almost smile but stopped just shy of it. He walked around the table and waved the dirty plates over to the sink. He stopped in front of Harry’s chair and put his hands on his hips.
“Good boy.” He loosened that grip on Harry’s hair and stroked his hands through it.
“Fuck, shit.” He cursed behind Harry as he pulled on his boots, followed him out of the tent and over the hedge.
Draco turned Harry to sit sideways on his lap so he could see him properly.
But they were going to the Burrow - and soon - and then if everything Malfoy said was true...maybe it would be alright that they were fucking. He cringed at his own thinking. This was exactly what Malfoy wanted him to think, and it could all be a complete lie. And he hadn’t even told them about Malfoy not drinking the Veritaserum. He knew though that if he was going to tell them at all, he should have told them then, now there was no way. He was part of Malfoy’s conspiracy now.
Draco grinned at him, like he knew exactly what he meant, and carried on getting himself off. Harry realised his hands were hanging limp at his sides. He had no idea what to do with them. He moved one to Draco’s chest, tracing the lines of bubbles that rested on the fine platinum curls. He took a deep breath as Draco moved faster, trying to hold himself back. Draco smirked knowingly.
“I can!” They stepped out on the tenth floor and Harry determinedly put one foot in front of the other on the white stripe that ran down the middle of the corridor.
be dismissed.”
“What?”
Harry was shaking as he stood on the front line, flanked by his best friends, his class mates, his tutors, as they stood tall in front of the castle. He hadn’t seen Draco since Dumbledore’s office. It burnt in his chest that he didn’t know where he was, whether he was safe, but he finally understood what Hermione meant. At the end of it all, there was the war, and he was going to fight in it. He knew what side he was on. Draco, well. He couldn’t make that decision for him.
“Oh Potter. I guess I was just a little younger that you when I discovered how much I liked bouncing up and down on Blaize’s cock.”
“Can we help him?”
Harry tensed.
Potter licked him hard, dipping his tongue inside him and making Draco wonder just how sturdy the bars of the cell were as he clenched his fingers around them. His cock bobbed in front of it and Draco wondered how hard he’d have to plead for one of their audience to come and tend to it. He doubted they’d dare come and interfere with Potter’s show.
Draco smiled at him and Harry relaxed. For a second everything was okay. Draco laced their fingers together. Held his hip a little tighter as they moved. Harry felt light.
Harry groaned.
“You afraid of what I do to you?”
“Arsehole.”
He knew what he implied. The Malfoy name was dirt. Draco was a happy scape goat for the survivors of the war to take their grief and anguish out on. No one in their right mind would take on Draco as any sort of assistant or apprentice. It would completely ruin their reputation and business.
“Yes! Jesus Christ, you can’t do this to him!”
Harry pushed harder, ignoring the gaging. Ignoring his body’s protesting. His whole body wretched and Draco yanked his head back.
Harry heard the rustling of Draco rummaging in his bag before he stood back up again. Draco undid Harry’s cloak from behind and Harry heard him carefully fold it and place it on the side. He reached round and undid Harry’s belt matter-of-factly and let his trousers drop to the ground.
Harry pushed another finger inside him and Draco shuddered.
“Mmm, alright that’s enough.”
“Fuck you.”
She nodded with a knowing look on her face.
“I brewed it myself a week ago!” Hermione chided him.
Draco pulled the towel off Harry’s waist and tugged on Harry’s earlobe with his teeth.
Malfoy laughed and put his spare hand over Harry’s mouth which just made Harry squirm more.
“You will drink it. And then you’ll tell us the truth,” Harry said sternly. Malfoy just smirked at him and watched Harry picked up the potion and put it to his lips.
“What’s a sword swallower?”
As Draco got close to finishing his meal Harry got nervous. He hadn’t forgotten the mortification of that afternoon. Of what Draco now knew. He didn’t know whether Draco was going to pretend it never happened. But if he was going to do that, what on earth was he doing there? Did he want to be friends?
“Fuck! Ah!” Harry did, crying out, scratching his nails down the floorboards as he came all over the floor.
“You…to distract me from the Dark Lord…you…”
Draco laughed and laced his hand through Harry’s before apparating them away into the dark.
“Shhh.” Draco slid his thumbs inside together, his fingers splayed over Harry’s arse cheeks. Harry squealed.
“People are going to die.”
“Don’t think you’ve earned it yet. Get on your front.”
“Fuck!”
The bath started singing to him to tell him it was full. He cursed to the moon and back which ever minister had had that installed. The housekeeping said it was old magic, and no one could remove it. None of the past ministers were owning up to having done it, and that was just the ones that were alive.
“You sure?”
“Great, I promise, I’m a fantastic shag.”
Malfoy kissed him and Harry smacked him in the face. Malfoy grinned at him and Harry inwardly groaned, obviously Malfoy had been provoking him and he realised once again Malfoy had won, and had had the upper hand all along.
He yanked Draco’s head back.
He found it double locked which was strange, he couldn’t remember them leaving anything down there of value. He picked up the key from the shelf and clicked open the lock, opening the doors and making his way, wand raised in front of him, down the rickety stairs. He held his lit wand up to see that the contents of the cellar appeared to be the same, apart from a bundle of clothes in the corner. Except that it wasn’t a bundle of clothes, it was a person.
Harry’s mouth had gone positively dry. He pushed himself up on the couch and Draco walked back towards him.
“Fantastic,” Harry muttered under his breath.
“Why, interested are you?”
Harry laughed.
Draco jumped up, nodded, and led the way out without a look back at his father. He took Harry straight to the front door, where luckily only the order were waiting.
“This isn’t some schoolyard feud Potter, this is life and death.”
“You pathetic little brat. God, my only regret is your mother couldn’t have more children. Even a girl would have been less of a disappointment than you.”
“I dunno, I wouldn’t want to go up against a very big cat without my wand.”
“I think the word you’re looking for, Draco, is thank you.”
Potter grinned at him and threw him a towel.
Potter moved his hand up to Draco’s hair and pulled him back up, kicked his stool out the way and threw him face first against the bars again.
“Sorry, humour me. Are we still holding to article 256 of the justice laws that any time in Azkaban less than 10 years can be served as Ministry service time instead with the supervision of a willing allocated mentor?”
Harry guided him away from the crowd and over to the bar.
“Don’t worry. My duelling skills are much better than my potion skills.”
Harry sighed.
Draco groaned underneath him.
Lucius flashed green and fell rigid onto his back.
Harry levitated Draco off the floor, trying not to look at the sheer amount of his blood on the floor. He took him into what used to be a dining room that was now Mrs Weasley’s area for patching them up.
“You like that? You like having your arsehole stretched you dirty little whore?”
Harry cast a silencing charm round the bed and grabbed the toy from where he’d hidden it at the back of his dresser drawer.
He heard Ron walk past and into the showers, followed by the dragging footsteps of the rest of the boys.
Draco just grinned at him. He’d mentally coined the phrase wizard Viagra when Draco had used it on him before. It wasn’t like the one Draco used so often; the one that tightened around his cock and stopped him from being able to come. He could get himself off as many times as he liked, it just never satisfied him, minutes later his cock would be throbbing with need again. It was cruel. He’d only left him unattended with the spell for a few hours before...but a few days?
“Open your mouth.”
“How would you know?”
Draco moaned low in his ear and Harry groaned.
“Well maybe, Harry I know it’s hard but maybe it’s a good time to leave it. Let things be.”
Harry groaned.
“So why did you come here?” Harry repeated his earlier question. Malfoy smirked at him slightly, Harry prayed to god the others didn’t notice.
His heart thumped in his ears and he hoped to god some back up was on its way. He knew he should have waited.
Draco stood. Harry tried not to tremble in front of him.
“Who is it?”
Malfoy walked up to him. Harry stumbled back. Malfoy stepped forward again, put his hands on the outside of Harry’s arms.
Tonks blinked at her outburst.
“Yes?”
Harry gave her a scathing look.
Harry lost his breath again.
“I mean,” Draco stroked Harry’s cock through his trousers. “I’m up for anywhere really.”
“Or are you always too busy staring into Malfoy’s eyes?”
They were quiet under the shower for a moment.
Harry was beginning to splinter.
Draco nodded and waited for Draco to sit down.
“Thanks.”
As Potter got closer Draco thought surely he wouldn’t murder him in public. If he wanted to kill him he’d have picked a much subtler place. Even Potter wasn’t that bloody stupid.
Draco shrugged.
Harry managed to shake his head through the pain.
Draco was glad his face was pushed down into the stool now. He reached behind him and pulled his cheeks apart. He heard several groans from the crowd behind him.
“Top off then let’s check you over. Malnourished, heavy bruising, that ribs cracked, and your collar bone... hang on... “ There was a sickening snap and Draco’s hand clenched round Harry’s. “That’s better! Let’s just check your back, okay, legs, yes...sprained ankle. Nothing a bit of rest won’t fix.
“Malfoy! At least let him sleep a little,” Hermione protested.
Draco laughed.
The hall was sparkling, his drink was sparkling, and Draco was somehow sparkling. Harry could have sworn it. He watched him under the chandelier, light from the candles bounced and twinkled off his platinum hair, his steel grey dress robes, as he glided from person to person.
She put her hand on his arm.
The door slammed and Harry swore. Draco burst out laughing under the sheets. Harry pulled him up and pushed him onto his back.
“They do say giving gives more happiness than receiving.”
“I have to go. Don’t follow me.”
He picked up his beer, swigging it as he tried to remember where the toilets were in here. He couldn’t remember. He needed air. He gulped in the fresh air as he walked out onto the turret, breathing it out slowly and trying to settle his whirring mind.
Eventually they stilled and Harry pulled back, stumbled and fell back onto his back on the floor.
“I’ll make some tea then...” Harry started, not really wanting to sit in between Ron and Malfoy who were currently staring daggers at each other.
“Relax, darling, I’m only joking. I’m gonna go longer. How hard are you, Potter?”
Harry groaned inwardly. He closed his eyes, wondering if he could manage to sleep all the way, but the noise of the carriage was deafening. Malfoy took another sip of his drink and turned a page of his book.
Harry’s stomach churned. At the slight, but also about what Draco was doing. He didn’t follow Draco, true to his word, but when he got back to the common room he opened up the map. Draco was in the room of requirement. Hermione sat down next to him and raised an eyebrow. They were alone in the common room for the moment.
He lay back down on Harry’s chest and closed his eyes. Almost instantly his breathing became rhythmic and deep. Harry stared at the gold fringe at the top of his curtains, his heart still thudding in his chest. How had he gone from a wet dream about Draco to ending up with him in his bed, fucking him senseless then sound asleep on his chest?
Draco swooped down with his mouth, tonguing his balls.
“Do you think I feel some sort of loyalty to you, Potter? That I’d tell you the truth?”
Draco was beside him instantly, helping him up.
“It’ll take your mind off things,” Draco soothed. “Keep you busy.”
The bell rang again.
Harry didn’t know this house at all, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were moving away from the front door. He turned forward to see where they were headed and swore under his breath. Draco had come to a stop in front of the open door to Lucius Malfoy’s study. Lucius had his back to the door, his hood down for a change, his white hair spilling down the back of his black robes.
“Yes, yes.” Draco’s hand was slick, smearing the gel over Harry’s cock.
“Oh yesss Potter that’s good. So good.”
For a horrible moment Harry thought he’d splinched him in his haste to get away. He looked over at Draco had thankfully found him in one piece.
“Lie on your back.”
Harry gritted his teeth, knowing any effort he made to stop Draco would alert Lucius to their presence. He didn’t want this hanging over Draco for the rest of his life. The chair spun round. Harry instinctively darted back from the door before Lucius could see him. Draco wasn’t so fast.
“Ah yeah, yeah, oh I’m gonna come Potter, fuck!”
Harry just glared at him. He couldn’t help but look at him now though, as he was feeding him and Malfoy was looking up at him with the biggest eyes...God he should have just let him fuck him earlier. He hated to admit when Malfoy was right about things, but right now it probably would have helped him think a lot clearer.
“How many?”
Hermione marched in after him and slammed a vial of pearlescent liquid down in front of Malfoy.
“Come on, Potter, take ittt…”
“Draco Malfoy.”
“Oh you’re right Potter, that is good...” he lay on his back and held his arms out to Harry.
Harry stopped.
Harry didn’t think he’d ever been less relaxed. Draco set every nerve on end, made his guard go straight up the second he saw him. Bracing himself for the insults, the glares. Or the seduction, as he got now, which he thought was a lot more terrifying.
“Not one like this.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open. Sexually active Slytherins. He started to wonder if he was the only one. God. Were Ron and Hermione… he shuddered and dismissed the thought before it killed his erection completely.
“Even if they’re torturing people? Murdering them?”
“Shit, are you okay?”
Hermione frowned.
“You don’t even like me,” Harry said.
“Please!”
Harry pointed to the cupboard.
“Eat something.” Hermione put some toast on his plate. “You’ll feel better.”
“Infuriating?”
“Shh, I swear blow my cover Potter and I’m screwed. This is the best job I’ve had in ages don’t screw it up for me. Just take your damn clothes off and get on the bed in case anyone comes in.”
“Of course not.” Harry didn’t have to see Draco to know that he was rolling his eyes. “Too bloody powerful aren’t you boy wonder, you can see right through it without even trying. It’s sickening.”
“Have you ever seen Fantasia?” Harry asked him.
Draco pushed back his chair.
Harry conceded, currently trying and failing to put the key in the lock to his door. He threw the key to Draco. Draco caught it with one hand and opened it easily.
Malfoy flicked his wand and Harry felt a tightening in the base of his cock. He cursed Malfoy to hell and back around his rope.
As it was Lucius Malfoy was sat in the prison, blissfully unaware that it was his son that put him there. They’d kept Draco out of sight for the whole siege and takeover of the Malfoy Manor. Although Draco had wanted to see the look on his father’s face, his father had too many contacts. At present, no one officially knew whether Draco was alive or dead. Draco quite liked it that way. Voldemort would think him dead or a traitor, as he hadn’t returned when called by the mark as the Death Eaters regrouped after the crushing defeat at the Manor. They must know it was an inside job. They hadn’t seen how they got into the Manor though (Draco showed the Order the wonders of Vanishing Cabinets working both ways). It had been hard to keep quiet, especially when he could hear his mother calling for him, desperate to know as they carried them all off to the newly guarded Azkaban, whether Draco was alive or dead.
Harry closed his eyes then raised his hand.
Malfoy whispered something under his breath and the thing started to vibrate and swell in size. Harry’s eyes widened and he went to move away but Draco’s hand was already firmly on his hip.
“Yes! Oh fuck!” he cried out as he came hard in Draco’s hand.
“Well. You’ll be please to know I’m planning to escort you from this hell hole. I trust you’ve no objections this time.”
“So rude, Potter. I need to teach you some post coital manners.”
“I’m screwed, Potter. From all directions. And not in the fun way. I’m starting to come to terms with it.”
“No? You not always fancied me? “
Draco pulled off Harry’s clothes, letting the dressing gown slip off his shoulders, refusing to break the kiss. He touched Harry’s wand and then Harry felt Draco’s familiar slicked fingers inside him. Harry moaned into Malfoy’s mouth, kissing him hard, his body so hungry for what it was usually deprived of but so desperately craved. Draco lifted Harry up against the counter and Harry instinctively wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist, crying out into their desperate kisses as Draco pulled him down onto his cock.
Draco slid another finger inside him and Harry shrieked.
“It doesn’t say anything about cramps in the book Harry.”
“They sent me out to scout around the town, we’d got word of some Order activity nearby and they sent me to see if I could make anything of it.”
“Harder. Come on. Claim me.”
“Ready?”
“Well bully for you.”
Draco slid his hand up into Harry’s hair.
Kingsley scraped back his chair.
“Well, I’m glad you managed to deliver our package safely, Draco. I’m sure you’ll keep him just as securely in your room?”
Harry couldn’t argue with that.
Harry groaned as he saw water seeping in through the corner nearest to his head.
“Malfoy, what the hell?”
He heard the sound of Draco doing the same opposite him. It was erking him that none of this seemed to be bothering Draco at all. He’d been planning on being the righteous one and putting on a brave face whilst Draco whinged all weekend.
“Not bad for a first go, Potter.”
“Yeah? You been thinking of me? Twisting in your sheets wanking yourself dry?” Draco whispered in his ear.
“It’s nice, Potter, I promise...”
“You alright, mate?” Ron slapped his hand on Harry’s back.
“Oh no. It’d be like marrying family.”
She smiled.
Harry felt his orgasm start to wash over him and gasped, staring up wide eyed at Draco as he started to come untouched.
“By you, that was the general idea.”
Harry turned and looked desperately for Ron and Hermione. He was flustered, sweating and still had a slight erection. Malfoy looked completely unruffled.
Harry desperately tried to find the words to tell him no, it was fine, to please put his hand back. But it was too late. The connection between Harry’s brain and speech seemed to be out of action. God knows how he ever got a girlfriend. A stunning girlfriend at that. He supposed he hadn’t had to do a great deal of work. She had more or less jumped into his arms.
“Brat,” Harry muttered under his breath again as he began to fuck Draco slowly.
His bliss was interrupted by the squeak of the shower door opening and the boys coming back from the bathroom.
By the time they got near to their stop, almost all of the train’s customers had got off. Harry had shifted onto the seat opposite. Draco hadn’t commented. He hadn’t said a word, except to ask Harry to move so he could go to the toilet, the entire journey. Harry was suspicious but fairly relieved, god knows the situation was bad enough without Malfoy’s needling.
He opened his eyes and saw Malfoy looking back at him. He looked surprised, but it wasn’t the same looks of horror that he was sure was on his face.
“I’ve never fucked a guy before.” Harry blurted.
He sipped on his water. Just for a moment he had glimpsed past Draco’s work mask. But they’d both been tipsy, it was Christmas, and Harry doubted it’d happen again. The hangover was looming, and a grey cloud was descending over Harry’s world.
Harry shrugged. “You’re on then.”
“I know. Don’t worry, just do as I tell you.”
He walked around the corner, enjoying the warm tiles against the soles of his feet. Draco grinned at him from where he was lying in the bath, already covered in bubbles.
Draco grinned and pumped his cock faster.
“Slut. Look at you. Christ.”
Harry’s experiences at kissing had not been amazing. Paranoia sparked that he was going to be crap at it and he’d give Malfoy another reason to make fun of him. Malfoy grabbed the back of his hair, hard, pulling his head back, hovering his lips over Harry’s. Harry flushed as a whimper escaped his lips.
Harry wondered how they’d punish Draco, for not doing what he was tasked. His stomach turned. But then he was Lucius Malfoy’s son, did that grant him any protection? God knows if he had any idea how Death Eater politics worked.
Draco sucked harder, wanting to make sure that after this Potter would not be staying away for any length of time worth counting.
“Can I at least have a shower? I feel disgusting.” Draco said, wrinkling his nose.
“Why are you here, Draco?”
“You got all the way through a course and work a job and no ones ever seen through it?”
Major creates a weather repellent bubble around them both and Harry shakes himself dry.
“Please try and keep it discreet, Potter. God knows the hysteria that would break out if they found out how powerful you really are. Christ.” She sighed. “Okay. You’re relieved. Go home and get some rest.”
“Smuggling them, you stupid boy. Aren’t you supposed to be an Auror?”
Harry smirked. “Come on then Princess, let’s get you out of here.”
Draco groaned above him then pulled back and chuckled.
Draco chuckled at Harry’s complete lack of response.
He shuffled down in his sleeping bag trying not to kick Malfoy in the process and not get stuck in his sleeping bag and make an idiot out of himself. Not that he cared what Malfoy thought.
He opened the door. It was a trick.
“Too long,” Harry muttered, kissing Draco hard.
“I…” Harry started.
He swore as Draco began pounding his arse, slamming into his prostate and making him see stars.
“Fuck!”
“Fuck yes, Draco!”
“Stop! It’s us!”
“It’s not a friendship. He…we’re…” Harry nearly choked on his words.
“Language.”
“What are you too looking so serious about?”
He let go of Draco’s wrist that he’d been left holding.
But once again Draco had seduced him, used him and humiliated him and strolled off like it didn’t mean a thing. Harry wished he felt so casually about it.
“No, really, it’s passed. I just feel exhausted.”
Harry’s heart thumped in his chest. He couldn’t do this. Could he? He was already so far in, what was the harm of falling a little further, just this once?
Harry kissed him on the forehead.
Draco laughed and slid down to kneel into the gap in between Harry’s legs.
Draco scoffed.
Harry was lying face down on the bed with his face in his hands. His lips twitched.
“Maths?” Malfoy scoffed. “Not enough to realise when the odds are stacked against you, chosen one.”
,” Harry clarified.
“Okay, well, they’re simple enough. Let me get find the book.”
Draco didn’t comment, just discarded them onto the floor and took out his wand. He conjured a bubble of water and soaked Harry’s feet, inexplicably keeping both their legs and the sofa perfectly dry.
Harry fucked him slowly with his fingers, still holding him firm against the wall. Draco whimpered, tilting his head back to look at Harry, his wet hair sliding in Harry’s fingers.
Draco gasped as he shifted on Harry’s cock.
Harry slid down him, eager to taste him again, have him bucking underneath him and pulling his hair. He groaned at how hard Draco was. He stroked him first, fantasising already about having it back inside him. He sucked on the head, revelling in the gasp he elicited, then slowly pushed his lips down. The guttural sound Draco made his cock throb. He sucked him slowly, playing with Draco’s balls with light fingers, enjoying taking his time for a change. Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair, moaning softly. He pushed down and Harry complied, bouncing his cock off the back of his throat, trying desperately to swallow.
Draco shot him a grin that made him weak at the knees. They sat down. Harry winced at the bottle of pale liquid that was still waiting patiently by the door until Draco waved it over.
“If you keep ordering me around like that, I’m gonna come in my fucking boxers.”
“I thought you’d say that.”
“What’s the problem?”
Draco groaned and Harry laughed in his ear. Nibbling at his ear lobe.
Harry was panting with the pace, the intensity, the agony of being so close but not
“No time for napping, Potter, get on your knees and suck me. Breaks gonna be over soon.
“What did you do that for? I could handle him!”
“Isn’t it a free bar, Minister?”
“So, this is where the Ministers of Magic have all lived.”
Harry let out a content sigh. The weight of Draco on his chest was blissful. Harry didn’t ever want him to move.
. What I’d like to know is what you and this traitor scum are doing lurking outside my house.”
“I need information.”
Harry whinged, slowing and trying to catch his breath. Draco slapped him on the arse.
Potter raised his eyebrows when Draco failed to respond and knocked on the bars again.
“Sit down,” Harry said, as they walked into the kitchen.
“See a lot of yourself in me then?”
“Yeah, Potter, come on, come for me.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hair and pulled his head up.
“Thank you, Draco. Oh. Hell.” He swore as it began to grow bigger.
“What the hell are we doing?” Harry asked when he got his breath back.
“Put your hands on my hips.”
She looked at him in the eye, hard.
“Yeah?”
“Shut up, Malfoy. I was going to tell you, Harry, but you know I can’t contact you when you’re away. He turned up here in the middle of the night, banging on the back windows and demanding to be let in. Kept going on about him being a secret spy for The Order and how he’d come here to warn us.”
“You don’t say. Let me just have a look down here, I wanna see how it looks inside you, how much progress we’ve made on your tight little arse hole.”
“Hi Harry!” Ron called.
Draco cast an immobilisation spell on the bed.
“How’s that?”
“Potter,” Draco leaned closer and drawled in his ear. “It’s very normal. Don’t be embarrassed. Turn over and let me do my job.”
“Yes, Malfoy, cos I’m not a spoilt little bitch like you...” Harry snapped at him. He didn’t know where he was getting this confidence from, normally he wouldn’t dare speak to Malfoy like that. He knew exactly what he was capable of doing to him.
“I’ll be sure to remember next time.”
“No. No thank you.”
“So, what, you’re going to torture him, until he breaks, supposedly unleashing this hidden power within him that’s going to defeat Voldemort?”
“Draco. I swear to god.”
“Harry. Report.” Moody came into the room.
“Is it? Or is it the best fucking thing you’ve ever done?”
“Well, I haven’t thought of him since the cramps started.”
“But…” Harry managed.
Draco waved his wand and the rope whirled from round his head, wrapping itself instantly round his wrists again. Harry didn’t much care anymore, he just let his head drop onto the mattress as he felt the thing sending him into a state of ecstasy. He could feel it moving, swelling inside him...he was vaguely aware that he was letting out a low groan.
Harry swore under his breath. They were five minutes away. He couldn’t tell Malfoy. Not that it was even his fault.
“I think you’re wrong.”
Harry held up his hands.
“I did not!” Harry tried to twisted his arm out of Draco’s grip but Draco gripped harder. Harry swung himself over Draco, grabbing his other wrist and pushing it down.
Ron laughed and Hermione joined them at their other side after spending the class being spun around the room by Neville.
“Will you ever stop apologising for my family’s mistakes?”
“Oh yeah fuck that’s good. Just like that.” Draco groaned, rocking his hips up, slowly fucking the back of Harry’s throat.
Draco shuddered underneath him.
He ran his hands through Draco’s silky hair and sank into the bed.
“How bad is it?” Harry asked.
“Did you want another shag?”
of every month.”
“Goodness, Potter, it’s only been a few days...”
“Yeah, sorry mate.” Ron smiled apologetically. “I was worried!”
Harry smirked at the deliberate provocation and pushed two fingers back in hard.
It was the exactly the same time the next day when Draco pulled him into the same closet and shoved him face forward against the wall.
Draco groaned in protest but Harry moved over him to kneel either side of his shoulder. Draco leant up, eager now, opening his mouth in the most obscene picture. He gasped as the heat of Draco’s mouth engulfed him. Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and pulled him closer, gagging on his cock but still pushed forward.
“To tell me it’s all a big misunderstanding, blah blah, don’t tell anyone?” Draco cut him off.
“Fuck!”
Ron nodded reluctantly.
“Yeah, you want that don’t you? Does it keep you up all night? Thinking about my prick? Do you think it’ll be even worse, now you know how big it is, how it feels in your hand?”
Hermione rolled her eyes and threw the bag of food at him through the curtains.
“Where’s yours?”
“Draco please. Please. I need.” His please were muffled by Malfoy’s hand. Malfoy pumped his cock harder.
They stared at each other. Harry noticed he was panting hard.
“Is that enchanted?”
Harry was actually thinking that Draco’s hands are the things that must be enchanted. He bit back another sigh as Draco started working on his thighs.
“Everywhere,” Harry told her.
“You like that?”
He took Draco’s cock in his mouth gratefully, sucking and pushing down with his lips in a frenzy. Desperate for it to be inside him somehow. To worship his ridiculous perfect cock. He took it to the back of his throat and pushed.
“I didn’t see it.”
“He won’t.”
Harry yanked his wrist back, terrified by the sensations such a small action had sent coursing through him. Jesus.
Draco kissed him again and Harry had an awful feeling he would do just about anything he wanted.
“It’s not going to turn me platinum is it?”
Harry warmed his own sleeping bag and sighed in relief.
“You know…” Draco said, continuing to palm Harry’s cock through his boxers, “I don’t think I was far off.”
“It’s not like before is it... When your scar was hurting... Cos of you know who?”
Draco clearly thought the same as he waved his wand. Harry groaned in pain as he felt his bones and muscles spring back into action.
“Yeah?”
“Remus. You know. Just to see how they’re all doing.”
Harry picked up his knife and fork and looked down at his plate.
“There’s a pity.”
Harry knew Draco was right. He was tired, cold, his face still hurt where Draco had smacked him, and he felt like shit. He pulled out his sleeping bag and burrowed down in it. He rested his head on the pillow and was halfway through wondering how he was supposed to sleep on such hard ground with a rock jutting into his back when he passed out cold.
He turned round and found Draco was giving him the most innocent of smiles, as if they were the best of friends. Harry rolled his eyes and stepped out of the shower, surprised that he could even manage to stand. He grabbed a towel and walked back into the bedroom, drying himself off. He knew that he was supposed to be watching Draco, but right now he couldn’t bear to look at him.
“Night,” Harry sighed and lay still on his back. He closed his eyes and despite thinking that he wasn’t at all tired, seemed to drift off to sleep straight away.
“Fuck yes.”
It was darker out here than he could ever remember it being. Except maybe on that ridiculous little island Uncle Vernon had driven them to all that time ago. The wind was howling just the same as that night. He shivered in the sleeping bag. He heard a tap as a raindrop hit the top of the tent. He prayed it was just the one.
“Hey! You can’t choose your family. I’d thought you of all people would understand that.”
“Um…” Harry couldn’t seem to remember what his excuse was meant to be for dragging Draco over here. He felt a little fuzzy.
“and...?” Hermione prompted, who had apparently now joined them at the bottom on the stairs, looking just as shocked as Harry did.
Harry groaned around his rope, his mouth was already becoming dry, the nasty taste of the rope filling his mouth. He looked into Draco’s silver eyes, they were gleeful that he was causing Harry this much discomfort.
Harry had been hiding in this bathroom for longer than he cared to remember. He was sure she was still outside. Arms folded. Waiting. He could feel it.
“I’ll work on it.”
“Expelliarmus!”
“How?”
She poured more brown liquid over it and Draco gritted his teeth.
“Shh!”
“No, I mean, if you wanted, I meant…”
Draco was rocking back and forth in his lap, the sweetest pressure on his cock, the sweetest smell of Draco up close. Harry didn’t reply. He didn’t think Draco really wanted him to.
Draco started fuck him, hard and slow, and Harry’s eyes rolled back into his head.
“Say ‘I’m a traitor, and I want a death eater to suck my dick,’” Draco instructed.
“Ah!”
“Why did they wait this long?”
Hermione pushed the door open and put a jar of white liquid on the side.
Draco fucked him ruthlessly, pumping his cock hard, and Harry screamed as he felt himself hurled towards the edge.
“Draco don’t.”
Harry flushed, took it off quickly and threw it to the floor. He wasn’t embarrassed by how he looked, he knew he was in good shape. He was embarrassed that he was following Draco’s every command.
“I’m doing just fine.”
Harry sighed. “Fine, whatever. Sleep where you like.”
“I’m not asking you out, Potter. I was proposing a long hard fuck out here in this lovely summer evening.”
“Didn’t you bring any beans?” Draco asked.
He pushed his slick fingers in between Harry’s legs before he had time to retort and Harry moaned loud, pushing himself back hard against Draco’s hand.
“Fuck, fuck, yes, Draco, please, I’m so close.”
Harry squirmed. He was still rock hard and the promise of Draco’s mouth was almost too much to resist.
“Maybe I need to start looking in more unconventional places. Right. Shall we go?”
“Nothing. It’s fine. Hang on.” Harry grabbed the tip of his wand from the back of his throat and carefully extracted it.
“Potter,” Draco growled.
“Mmhmm.”
Harry was cresting, his body finally getting what it wanted, soaring, contracting. He screamed.
Harry laughed in spite of his dire situation.
“Well. At least you’re not going to die a virgin.”
“Like you’d know what to do with me.” Harry had panicked. It just slipped out. He had no idea what he was thinking of. He’d heard it in a movie once.
“I’m not...argh fuck.” Harry groaned as Draco pushed a finger inside him, slick and gentle.
Draco had the biggest grin on his face as he let his weight drop.
God what had Malfoy done to him? He should not be thinking like this. He shouldn’t even be letting him sit there without his cuffs on.
Harry was too proud to back down. He gulped, steeled himself and looked up to meet Malfoy’s eyes.
Malfoy kissed him hard and slow, pinning Harry against the side of one of the sofas with his weight, holding him tight with his hand and his thighs. He had clearly done this before. A lot.
Time was ticking away, as the taxi sped them towards their block of flats. Time was running out. Harry said nothing. He checked his watch. It was 11pm.
“Ah yeah, Potter. You look so good.”
Harry collapsed down on top of Draco, vaguely aware that he was probably crushing Draco with his weight. Draco was grinning.
“Yeah come on, Potter. Take what you want.”
“Who are you working for?”
“Yeah, you wanna be mine?” Draco’s voice had that edge to it that turned Harry’s legs to jelly.
“Still mine, aren’t you?” Draco purred in his ear then ran his teeth down Harry’s neck.
“Oh they did say you were hot headed, Potter. But I couldn’t quite believe my luck. The boy who lived and the blood traitor with him. It’s my lucky day.”
“And you feel like a god damn virgin again Potter. You’ve undone all my hard work.”
“It’s not like that!”
“You don’t sound particularly concerned.”
Harry didn’t reply.
“Go on then, Potter, make yourself scream, I want to see it...”
Harry inwardly groaned as Draco smiled politely and walked back to the group of PAs.
“Are you out of your mind? He could be a death eater!”
“Why don’t I give you a little while to think about it?”
“Fuck.” Harry hips spasmed and Draco grinned.
Luckily, he saw no one, and just remembered the way to the prefect’s bathroom. The password hadn’t changed. He locked the door behind him. The water was already running, and the perfumed soap drifted through the air. He wished he’d have used the few minutes they were apart to pull himself together, but his brain was still mush. He took off his clothes and hung them on the hook next to Draco’s, already a little breathless at the thought of seeing Draco naked. And wet.
He heard the rest of the boys leave.
“You could at least be nice!”
“Right,” Harry confirmed.
Harry took one last glass of champagne and walked over to Draco, putting his hand on his shoulder.
“What? I distracted him! He didn’t notice you come in, didn’t hear the screams of his friends and he definitely didn’t hear as you dragged them in here. What more do you want?”
“Ah yeah.”
“Do you mind if I borrow Draco for a minute?”
“You sure?”
“FUCK.”
“All yours, Potter, you can lead for once.”
“Thanks, Harry.” Hermione smiled at him.
“Yeah?”
“And she’s still after you.” Hermione laughed.
A bell rang in the background and Draco sighed.
Before Harry could respond Draco had slipped away from him and out the door, leaving him cold and damp against the cold damp wall. His head was still spinning. He started to count to 120.
“Draco... Oh god...” It felt like the first time, all over again, as Draco slowly pushed, till he was balls deep inside him.
“Never mind.”
“FUCK!”
“Good...sooo gooooddd.....” Harry moaned, he could feel it getting bigger, then shrieked as it pushed hard into his prostate. Draco grinned and waved his wand; it seemed lock it on that spot, fucking him hard.
“You’re not seriously considering ingesting that?” She whipped the cauldron from under his nose and took it to a toilet cubicle. It dropped into the water with stomach turning
“You’re gonna leave me alone on watch?”
He pulled on his dressing gown, feeling rather like crawling up into a ball under his duvet and pretending the whole thing never happened, but he doubted that was going to happen. He walked over to the window, looking out at the quiet London street. It was a clear night and he could see the almost full moon sitting full above the houses. It seemed strange that Death Eaters were planning an attack here, that danger was so imminent, when it was so peaceful outside.
“You’re very welcome.”
Harry caught himself staring at the tiny imperfection on his assistant’s head, transfixed. He’d quickly looked away when Draco had sat up, finally bringing the conversation to a close.
“Me neither. You’ve got a wonderful dick.”
“Who told you to take a break? Ride. Me. Until. You. Come.”
“Oh, Potter, you’re a dream.”
“M.O.M Aurors do not move!”
Harry grinned and fucked him hard with everything he had, delighting in Draco’s cries beneath him.
Harry cleared his throat and stood up. It created the excited scandalised whispers Harry had expected.
Harry looked at Draco pleadingly, he never touched himself and Draco knew it, not like that. He couldn’t bring himself to, no matter how desperate his body was. It would be admitting things to himself that he really wasn’t ready to.
Harry shrugged.
“Who is the lucky woman? Man? House elf? You might want to consider that you just have a teenage crush, Potter. I know you’ve been brought up to think that the world revolves around you, but I can’t think of anyone spending that much time directing your affections.”
“Because I’m obsessed with him.”
“How’s the…feelings?” she whispered.
“You’re struggling with this, I know. If it makes you feel better, look at it like this, at least now you’ve got no choice.”
“I’m pairing you together on your next investigation. Stake out.” She threw the file down at them.
Draco grinned and came all over his chest. Harry groaned, his cheeks burning, covered in cum and sweat.
“Yeah, I think so. Hungry, thirsty, sore, and I’d kill for a bath, but I think I’m okay.”
“I…” he said. “I’m hoping it won’t come to that. If I can defeat Voldemort one on one…”
“Say ‘I’m hard for you Draco Malfoy’.”
He threw the orb of light into the lamp on the ceiling and stared around, dumbfounded. The room was full of the cages they’d seen being transported, with the miserable looking animals still inside. They looked just as startled to see him. He flicked his eyes round the room again in case he’d missed something. He hadn’t. There was no woman.
“Come in, Harry. I just made some tea.”
“Well no, but, if they’re illegal why are there instructions on how to brew them in the library?”
“That looks good in you, Potter. Almost as good as my cocks gonna look.”
Harry gritted his teeth and tried not to scream at him that fine, would he rather go to Azkaban?
It was then he realised Malfoy was no longer behind him. He swore under his breath and turned around slowly.
“You’re such a child.” Draco said then paused. “Jesus Christ... I can feel the magic coming off you. Its a wonder you don’t explode.”
Harry nearly spluttered before he realised what she meant, then nodded.
“Wh...what?”
“You want what, Potter?”
“Mmm.”
He stood in the shower, staring at himself in the full length anti fog mirror.
“No,” Harry admitted.
“Or you’ll what? You make one move and I’ll kill him.”
“What are you?” Draco asked, pumping his cock.
Snape glared out over them from his desk.
Harry drew a slow breath in then continued, the sight of his cock disappearing into Draco’s arse destroying his last sane thought.
Harry’s heart lurched before Draco laughed.
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed himself up of Harry, grabbing his wand and cleaning himself up. Harry regretted every saying anything. His obsession with what Draco was up to was apparently still burning, underneath the lust. Draco was pulling on his clothes. Harry couldn’t find the energy to move.
“He made you act crazy Harry. This entire time. From brewing reversal love spells, to stalking him round the castle…”
It hurt. Of course it did.
“Okay, so, you think Malfoy’s give you a love potion, because?”
Ron came up behind them.
“Is it that bad being your PA?”
Hermione was going to kill him.
“Ages, since just before Dumbledore died.”
“You coming back down?”
Harry’s sullen look tinged with embarrassment.
“Yes, yes, fuck! More, more, please, fuck!” Draco babbled.
Harry groaned at the loss but Malfoy grabbed him and shoved him back round with his face against the door. He grabbed his hair tight and pulled his head to the side, snarling in Harry’s ear as he reached his hand round and pumped his cock.
“Look, Potter. Us fucking isn’t having any effect whatsoever on the war. I’m not telling you anything, apart from how delicious your arse is. And you’re not telling me anything, apart from how much you love my cock. There’s no problem.”
“I’ll send an owl ahead,” Ron said, “let them know what’s going on.”
Malfoy flicked his wand at him and the Death Eater went flying over the balcony and landed on the hallway floor with a sickening smack.
“It just feels hopeless. Fighting against an enemy so hateful and cruel they could do this to one of their own.”
“What?”
“We’re going to miss class,” Harry said.
“Yes!”
“Rot in hell.”
“For fucks sake.” He muttered under his breath.
“This is inhumane!” Hermione started again.
He helped himself to the English Breakfast Hermione pushed in front of him and thought nothing sexual in any way. Until the blonde walked in. Harry’s body yearned, blood flowed to the wrong place and his heart skipped. Harry slammed his cutlery down on the table in frustration, attracting concerned glances from people who already thought he was round the twist.
Harry blushed as Malfoy reduced his theories to dust.
Shit. Harry didn’t know what else to do but follow Malfoy’s lead and let him continue with his slow kisses. He couldn’t hear what was going on in the room anymore. It sounded like white noise. The ground was falling away beneath him. Malfoy’s tongue slid against his and God if it wasn’t the best thing he’d ever felt. Malfoy ground his hips into Harry’s. No. That was the best thing he’d ever felt. Harry responded, pushing back, and pulling him down onto him. Harry was hard. His cock throbbed in his trousers. His cheeks were burning red but there was nothing he could do to stop pulling Draco closer. He felt Draco’s hard cock on his thigh and felt a bit better about the situation.
“Someone’s arrived. Big van.”
“Okay.”
Harry closed his eyes and sighed.
“I want to do it,” Draco said.
“I’d much rather fancy Luna.”
“Yeah. God yeah.”
“The tip off says their meant to be arriving with the illegal goods between midnight and 1am, but we should probably keep an eye out.”
“Yeah, yeah, spread me.”
“Let me guess, you skip stretching,”
“Yes Draco...” Harry said patronisingly, “what would you like?”
“When have you been in there?!”
Harry finished his whiskey and wondered if his attempts to ask Draco on a date had fallen on oblivious ears. He couldn’t decide which he’d rather. He’d embarrassed himself, he was sure, but if it led to anything, he’d take happily take the embarrassment. He didn’t know what he was thinking of. Draco hated him. Or he used to, now it was probably a mild dislike. A bitterness that he considered himself in Harry’s debt no matter what Harry tried to stay. Either way, he had no idea if he was straight or gay, had a partner, anything. Draco was completely private. And why on earth would be interested in him of all people?
Harry cried out loud as he came, hands tight in Draco’s hair as he fucked his mouth and came down his throat.
“Liar.”
Arthur shuddered.
Draco grinned.
Draco didn’t look back. How could he? There was no mental messages now. Harry imagined there were far too many powerful wizards and witches here to intercept them. No more clever games, no more torn parchment messages, no more being dragged into broom cupboards, no more smirks. No more dancing. Draco was taking his place next to his father.
“Yeah alright I’ll give you that one. What is it?”
“What am I supposed to do?”
“Good morning.” Hermione smiled at him, pouring him some pumpkin juice.
“What are you doing here?”
“Draco,” Harry tried again, his cock already causing him to resort to desperate measures. He wrapped his arm round the blonde, looking up at him pleadingly. “Please, Draco, don’t leave me like this...I’ll do anything...”
Draco’s lips twitched.
He grabbed the back of Harry’s head and kissed him hard. Harry melted into Draco’s kisses. He’d grown a hell of a lot in the months since he’d seen Draco, he’d had to, but the second he felt Draco’s firm hand on the back of his head he was back at Hogwarts, in the room of requirement, putty in Draco’s hands, desperate to give him anything and everything that he wanted.
He shrieked as Draco pushed inside him. Draco didn’t mess around so much this time, just held his hips still with a tight grip and fucked him hard. Harry was whimpering, he was so sensitive every stroke was making him want to scream. Draco’s hands were tight on his hips as he fucked him, letting out his usual low guttural moan as he did.
“So you locked him down here?” Harry tried to make normal conversation; tried to be the Harry he’d become, sensible Harry, adult Harry, thinking about things in an organised manner and not as if they all just resolved to the look in Draco’s eyes as he fucked him. He nearly slapped himself, where had he been keeping all these thoughts? He hadn’t thought about Draco properly in months. Hadn’t thought about sex in months for that matter and just the sight of the boy was turning his mind back to that of a 16 year old.
“You!”
Harry groaned as Draco dug in his thumbs, tsking at the tightness and giving Harry another dose of the oil.
“Fuck off.” He leant down and kissed Draco, grinding their hips together.
Draco just grinned and Harry spun him around, pushing him down over the table. He had to take the opportunity to admire Draco’s arse. He spread Draco’s checks with his thumbs and pushed his fingers back inside the already stretched muscle, groaning at the sight of how it stretched, at his fingers disappearing him Draco’s arse.
“Yeah. Yeah. Whatever…whatever you want,” Draco rasped.
“Obviously.” Harry nodded. “Can you get the ingredients for the antidote?”
“Cos I want to touch you...” Harry didn’t know where that had came from, but it was true enough. He’d tied his hands before he’d even had chance to put his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco cocked an eyebrow.
“Fuck. Draco. So good.”
“Christ Potter, your backs a mess.”
“I’m…I’m hard for you Draco Malfoy.”
“God, Potter.” Draco panted in his ear. “You have no idea how much I’d like to just fuck you right now. While you’re this tight.”
She narrowed her eyes.
“This one...” Harry said as they got to his room, thankfully with it’s own en-suite. He walked in behind him, turning to lock the door and casting a silencing spell, telling himself that it was just so they could speak freely.
He leant up and kissed Harry, long and slow, and Harry melted into him.
Harry knew if he opened his eyes Draco’s crotch would be inches from his face. Draco rubbed up his neck, his thumbs circling and reducing his mind to mush.
Harry frowned.
“I thought he was after Ginny?”
“Slut,” Draco muttered again but complied with slow hard strokes. Every single one took Harry’s breath away, flushing his cheeks, till he started to push back, his body remembering the sensations, the rhythm of Draco’s body.
“This is crap.” Harry threw it back on the desk. “Stake out from a shit lead.”
Harry turned from the door slamming in his face and tried and make shapes out of the pitch black.
“You’re always inspiring me.”
Draco flinched, but didn’t try to pull away.
“Careful,” Draco said, “can’t have them saying I killed the Minister of Magic. I’m on eggshells as it is.”
Harry pulled his eyes away from Malfoy. He thought it would be easier to go along with the pretence.
“I wasn’t!”
“Turn around.”
Draco slid all but one of his fingers out and pulled Harry down on his dick.
He cried out, shaking above Harry as he came in long threads of Harry’s face. Harry was surprised he didn’t come untouched from the display. Harry winced as he felt it hit his hair.
“What are your plans for this weekend?” Harry asked him.
Draco came hard the second Harry touched his dick.
Harry pulled his head back, stroking Draco’s slick cock with both his hands.
He took a deep breath and slid the small cold metal inside himself.
“It’s too bad, Potter.” Draco hissed in his ear.
Draco scoffed.
“You’re a teenager!” Harry said.
They had grown up, supposedly. Malfoy’s hair had changed, he wore it shorter these days, hanging casually as if never styled. Harry didn’t believe it. Malfoy was dressed in blue jeans and a black polo neck, muggle clothes for their muggle training, maybe he had a few wrinkles around his eyes, but their colour, piercing grey, and the glare that he gave Harry for taking his time flicking through the pages…well. They might as well have still been in school. Maybe Morgan was right.
Harry did, again and again, sure that the only sound he ever wanted to here again was Draco’s squeals. Harry stood up, picking Draco up with him.
Draco pulled back.
Harry’s eyes widened and he stood frozen, torn between pushing his hand down harder and running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.
“Oh fuck,” Draco muttered under his breath. “That’s hot, Potter. Looks good inside you.”
“You like to cook?”
“Oh fuck. Fuck that’s good. Drac...”
“Coffee beans?” Draco asked.
Draco laughed in his ear.
“Okay. Table.” Draco said, lifting himself off Harry’s dick and putting his feet back on the floor.
Ron jolted him from his thoughts.
The only way to tell what Malfoy was up to, was to go to Mr Weasley and ask him if everything he’d said was true. They’d go there this afternoon, and then he could decide how to feel about the whole thing. If Death Eaters didn’t burst through the door any minute, called by a letter from Malfoy. God what was he even thinking, letting this happen?
“Soon. We should probably get you some clothes.”
“Never mind. Muggle sport. Mostly involves running into each other and fighting over a ball in a big heap.”
‘Samuel Skinner’ it said on the door.
“I have a feeling you might not be able to protect me from that for very long.”
Harry resisted the urge to throw himself over the books to hide his secret from him. He knew Ron wouldn’t give the books a second glance. He handed them some sandwiches.
“What, these handcuffs?” Malfoy pulled them out of his pocket. Harry frowned at him, he hadn’t even noticed him pick them up. Nevertheless, they needed to be on before they came in.
Well, his little joke was over. He’d seen from Slughorn how easily these things were reversed.
“I don’t know.”
Harry laughed and looked at his books that he’d neglected to kick of yet, that were currently creating a damp patch on the upholstery that he was sure he’d get a bollocking for later.
“Well, one out of two will have to do, won’t it,” Draco said.
“That’s just plates. Mums been sneaking me dinner. Or she was until father banished her.”
“Why would you do that?”
Harry leant back against the table and Draco wrapped his arms round his neck, moaning in his ear as Harry guided him up and down.
“Can I buy you a drink?”
“Don’t start, Potter,” Draco sighed.
“Nothing wrong with a pretend wife. I was meant to have one of those. She was a lovely girl, from France.”
“Okay.”
“Why not?”
Mrs Weasley was silent, but the appliances whirred into action again. She hadn’t said a word to him since they got here. She’d been wary of the plan all along to take the Manor and she had kept half an eye on Draco the entire time. When they declared the Manor their own and marched the Death Eaters out of there, she had still kept half an eye on Draco. Draco wasn’t particularly put out by this. In fact, he thought it was quite sensible of her. She had not asked the specifics about what was going on upstairs. For Harry’s sake, and hers, he was glad. He made a cup of tea and placed it on the side next to her.
Malfoy grinned at the look on his face.
.” McGonagall tapped her wand smartly on the record player. “Partners!”
She huffed and marched off ahead of them.
Harry tried to look as innocent and baffled as possible. Luckily Snape strode into the classroom and saved him.
“Of course. Now, Potter, I have to admit something to you.” Draco said and turned his back to Harry. “I was planning on going out and getting laid at a club tonight.” He put his hands to his arse cheeks. “So I am plugged. Could you take it out for me?”
Draco laughed low in his ear.
Harry put his hands on Draco’s chest and began to rock back and forth. Draco put his hands behind his head, the picture of relaxation as Harry moved experimentally.
“But how, Harry? He can’t have laced anything at meals without giving him it to the whole table, and I don’t see anyone else in Gryffindor house swooning over him.”
“If you don’t get us lost,” Malfoy finished for him.
“How long does it usually take you to get hard again?” Draco asked him.
“I...I think maybe just a back massage is fine.”
“What?”
“So do you.”
“I’m good, thanks. I think I’m going to go home and have a coffee.”
Harry did, closing his eyes.
“Please what? Please fuck you wide open? Get balls deep inside you? Is that what you’ve been dreaming about?”
“You’re a nightmare.”
There was a chorus of ‘of course not minister’, and Draco turned back towards him.
“Fuck.” Harry was panting, lying limp and drained on the mattress.
“You’re a terrifyingly good liar, Hermione.”
“That was a mistake,” Draco said.
“Ah!” Harry grabbed a fistful of Draco’s hair and pulled hard.
“God help the Dark Lord if I was such a bad liar,” he whispered in Harry’s ear as he finally took his hand.
Malfoy wiped his face and drew himself up to his full height.
“You’re covered in dust.”
Harry was tensing already with excitement and jerked as he wrapped his hand round his cock.
“Harry you’re obsessed with him. You’re in love with him. That’s very dangerous.”
“Whatever. You have feelings.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry said eventually.
Harry closed his eyes and shook his head.
Harry grimaced, had so far been avoiding his prostate so as to keep a straight face.
Malfoy quickly pulled off the Death Eater’s hood from his head, realising what was causing the confusion before Harry did.
“I had got that impression.”
“It’s nearly as big as you.”
“What the hell are you blathering on about?”
“Well you’ve already paid ahead, so if you can find a space, pitch right up!” He laughed at his own joke and went back in the toilet block.
“I’m not sure. He’s pretty strong. I’ll try my best. I think I already made some good progress at the house.”
“There’s much worse monsters out there than me, Potter...”
Harry fucked him with his two fingers hard and Draco groaned.
“Six,” Draco had said matter of factly. “Six years.”
Harry breathed out hard. He desperately wanted to pull Draco up against him and snog him properly as he’d been dreaming of doing since yesterday’s encounter.
“Come on, Potter, where’s that stamina?”
Harry watched him go silently, his chin on the grimy floor.
Harry bit down on the back of his wrist as Draco pounded his arse, the obscene slapping sounds mixed with Harry’s shaking cries filled the dungeon.
Draco let the robes drop to the floor and crawled into Harry’s bed.
Draco blinked at the odd question. He was very private, and Harry knew that. But he felt brave.
They all winced. Draco didn’t apologise.
Harry quirked an eyebrow. Surely Draco wasn’t suggesting that they drank on the job. He turned the can and realised Draco had picked him up an iced late from the petrol station.
Harry hit the button for the top floor. He waited for Draco to press the button for the fifth floor. He pressed the door close button instead. Harry raised his eyebrows.
Harry looked at his watch.
“This is what you wanted. So take it like a good boy,” Draco purred in his ear.
Draco laughed low in his ear.
Instead he removed the disguise from his face.
Harry tried not to jump half a foot in the air.
“Drac—“ he groaned.
“Good. Let that settle and we’ll try you on some real food for dinner.”
“What are you doing with these creatures?” Harry asked as the Death Eater searched him.
“Potter, you’re shaking. You weren’t even this on edge when you were about to face that Horntail.”
“I promise I won’t punch you again if it makes you feel better.”
He was exhausted. Finally, after he finished eating a desire to sleep set in for the first time since he’d arrived, and he curled up in Draco’s bed. It didn’t help that it smelt of him. That gorgeous mix of sweat and aftershave that drove Harry completely mad. He fell asleep grinding his hips hopelessly into the sheets.
It grew wider and Harry’s head dropped down on the bed as it stretched him.
Harry sighed and paid for his food. Draco wasn’t long behind him and Harry pulled out the muggle smart phone they’d given him and opened the maps app.
“Yeah, Potter, yeah, pull me down hard on your cock.”
“My poor desperate Gryffindor.”
“We are not doing it out here. It’s bloody freezing.”
“The taxis here, Minister.” Draco put his hand on Harry’s back.
“Yeah, yeah, another one.”
Draco raised his eyebrows in the way that usually meant Harry really should have just done as he was told.
Harry cried out. Jesus but it had been a long time since anyone had done this to him, let alone done it well.
He’d expected at least Draco would go slow. Wrong again.
“Harry.”
Draco plunged his tongue in between Harry’s legs without warning and Harry yelped. Draco laughed at him.
She smiled.
She hung up.
Draco grinned, put his hands on Harry’s shoulder and started to fuck himself on Harry’s cock.
He looked sexy. Tousled. Shagged. He knew it. He liked it. And hated himself for it all the more.
Draco climbed on top of him before Harry’s shoulders had hit the floor.
He shuddered at Draco thrusting in his mouth, at his moans, at the tight grip he had in his hair. And that pressure in his arse, intense and unrelenting. He grabbed Draco’s legs with both hands to stop his hands from wandering to his cock and getting himself off. He didn’t want it to be over soon. Didn’t want it to be over ever.
She ignored him.
“No, thank you. Pride’ll do for me.”
“They’re going to block off all the exits, seal them, then burn the place to the ground.”
Harry rocked his hips experimentally.
“It seems we have reached the end of the world,” Draco said.
“At least you don’t have to do that anymore.”
“Oh Potter, I’ve actually bled you dry.” Draco’s voice was thick with lust as he looked up at him.
“What the hell have you done?”
Harry closed his eyes.
“Of course they’re not! Does Malfoy seem like the kind of person that would bother?”
Draco laughed weakly.
The door to the bathroom was open a crack and he heard faint sobbing coming from inside. Malfoy must be bullying one of the younger students for information. Harry slammed open the door, ridiculous attire forgotten, ready to come down on Malfoy like a tonne of bricks.
Harry rolled his eyes and didn’t respond.
“What? I could get rid of it for you.”
“Yes, fuck yes I wanna watch.”
“Potter! What are you doing?”
Harry did as he was told. Malfoy straddled his hips and stroked Harry’s cock a few times with the oil. Malfoy bit his lip, looking down at Harry’s cock as he stroked it. Harry groaned, never wanting to see anything again that wasn’t Malfoy straddling his lap and biting his lip.
“You should see the one we have at home.”
Draco gave him a smile, put his mug on the side and got up. Harry was terrified for a second that Draco was going to leave, but instead he lifted up Harry’s feet, sat down on the sofa, and placed them back in his lap.
“Well if he’s so attached to you why don’t we kill you and see if that breaks him.”
Draco reached down and slid open the iron bolt, his heart pounding in his chest. Potter pushed open the door, his face poker straight as he stepped inside the cage. There was plenty of room for them both in there, but Potter stepped straight up to him, pushing him back against the bars, his whole body firm against his. He grabbed Draco’s wrists and pulled them above his head, clicking his leather cuffs to the bars. Draco sighed out, aware of Potter’s size compared to his own. Shoulders that had widened as they’d ascended through the years, the muscles Potter had developed during his Auror training, held Draco hard against the bars. How easily Potter could throw him around a room was making Draco even harder.
“I’m not sure I’ve ever tried to before,” Harry said. “Ginny did the work for both of us.” He took a sip of the cordial. “That’s delicious, what is it?”
“Moody!” Molly chided him.
“I love you Potter.”
“Not talking to me anymore?”
“And let you be my valiant rescuer?”
Harry took his wand back of Draco.
“Yes, thank you, Draco.” Harry nodded.
“Move me how you want it. Faster if you like. Get yourself off.”
“You’re such a twat.”
“Really?”
“It’s similar to the muggle drug, Ketamine, yes. The only difference is it makes your hair sparkle.”
“Thank you, Minister.” Major relaxed, and some of the colour came back into his face.
“I could strangle you.”
“How about you tell me how desperate you are for me to suck you off and take that horrible spell away.”
“Ah yeah, yeah,” he muttered in Harry’s ears. “That’s good. Really good, Potter.”
Draco nodded silently, wiped his face, and got shakily to his knees.
He pulled the plug and dragged himself out of the bath, wrapped his dressing gown back round himself, shuffled to the bedroom and passed out on the bed.
Draco’s hard cock jutted into Harry’s thigh and he arched back against it, wondering if today was going to be the day.
Harry was so in over his head he could only gasp as Malfoy grabbed his cock.
Draco could blackmail him for this if he wanted to.
“It’s called having a bath, Potter,” Draco drawled. “Don’t your muggle family have one?”
“Sometimes, Harry, in these impossible situations, the only thing we can do to help someone is to-“
“I’ll find you one.”
“So they found out there was only us here?”
He never thought he could be so happy to see such a depressing looking house. The black paint was peeling from the door, the windows were blacked out and mostly covered in cobwebs from the outside. Still, Harry felt butterflies in his stomach as he reached out for the rusted metal handle and pushed the door open.
“Yeah sure, you look like shit. Get some sleep.”
“And some food. As soon as we get back. Promise.”
Draco nodded.
Harry sat back on his heels and Draco followed him, kneeling in front of him, stroking his fingers down his cheek.
“The thing is though,” she said tentatively, “it’s been weeks now. I don’t think it would still be working. Unless he was constantly slipping it to you.”
“You’re enjoying this!”
Draco didn’t bother trying to reply around his gag. He couldn’t think past Potter’s large erection that was pushing into his leg.
,” Draco growled.
Harry stared at the sight of his cock disappearing inside Draco’s arse. He fucked him slowly, trying to keep the invisible wall at bay. His nerves shattered every time he hit it.
“You need to be more careful. People are going to notice you’re both missing at the same time.”
“Thank you, Draco, I hope so too.”
“Yeah?” Harry looked up at him.
“Why should I?” Draco asked, putting his forehead up against Harry’s and raising his eyebrows challengingly.
“God I could get used to this in the mornings,” Draco sighed, running his hands over Harry’s back, sending shivers down Harry’s spine.
He told himself he musn’t complain. Draco actually made an amazing personal assistant, far more competent than his last one. Better than the scowling ruiner of social occasions Draco thought he might be. How he managed to be so polite, knowing how some of the people spoke about him, was beyond Harrry. As time went on he liked to think that they were beginning to accept Draco. He insisted on Draco coming everywhere with him. Always on at his side, his diary always to hand, manuscript, quills, and a supply of Harry’s favourite chocolate frogs on hand. He’d learnt quickly that a hungry Minister was not a happy Minister.
“But before you arrest me it’s all above board. I legally changed my name, and there’s no law against disguise spells. Not unless you’re impersonating someone.”
Harry groaned loud.
“Fuck, Potter. They shag like there’s no tomorrow. Cos guess what?”
“Please what?” Potter’s voice was low and full of lust. Draco could feel his hard cock against his thigh.
“What are you doing?”
Morgan glared at them for another few moments.
“She had breakfast. I was hungry.”
For a second, on his hands and knees, Harry felt relief from the constant desire that had been wracking his body for what felt like forever. He flopped over onto his back, staring at the bricks that had closed behind Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. His apparent lover. He closed his eyes, revelling in the buzz, the warmth, that flooded him. Drowning out the sensible thoughts that were demanding to know what the hell he thought he was doing.
Draco gestured.
“I hope you’re right.”
Draco smacked him on the arm.
“I’m sorry Ron, would you like us to lock him back in the basement like a real prisoner?” Hermione snapped at him.
“Maybe you’ve just got a thing for blondes?”
“Potter.”
“Shut up Ron!”
She wasn’t fooled. Harry couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Fine. Whatever...” he sighed and walked in front of him down the stairs.
“Feels just like old times,” Draco drawled.
“Now stick your arse in the air for me, beautiful.”
He kissed Draco’s wet hair.
“The son of Death Eater, and worst enemy in the school is telling me he wants a shag. How, in hell, do you expect me to relax and not think this is some elaborate joke?”
Harry shrugged.
Harry looked up at Draco, at his face, flushed and with a wide grin spread across it. Harry’s  heart did a somersault. He was screwed. He knew it. It was too late. He pushed the thought away. It was a problem for later.
“Why would I come here otherwise?”
“Getting yourself off against my hand?” Draco asked.
Shit.
Draco just gave him a sideways smirk. “I never asked you to.”
“Oh god.”
“God yes.”
The house was lit by a single lamp hanging to the right of the front door. The house was otherwise in darkness from what Harry could tell. He winced as their shoes crunched on the gravel as they crept towards the door.
Draco grinned.
“And pretend it never happened? Do you think you can fix me Potter, erase everything that happened to me?”
“Oh god.”
“Yeah, what you going to do? Tell Dumbledore? Doesn’t believe a word you say does he?” Malfoy sneered.
“Come on. Best not keep father waiting.”
“If you’re his best friend why did he never tell you he was getting fucked seven ways to Sunday by a Slytherin?”
“Woah. Oh. Drac… that’s nice…” he garbled.
Harry jerked his head down.
“We’re screwed,” Harry said eventually.
“Yes Minister. Just someone rather insistent on you coming to a gala.”
“Are you coming to this?”
Draco laughed.
She gave him an exasperated look.
He’d told Hermione of his fears, but what could she do? Nothing more than he could. There were no clues to be found, no perfect spell or potion lurking in the back of the restricted section. She told him to go to Dumbledore. Dumbledore just told him to be patient, that everything was under control. Wars were not won overnight.
Harry let his head go slack in Draco’s grip.
Harry barked a laugh.
“Bastard,” Harry muttered, though it still hadn’t wiped the grin off his face.
“Good boy.” Potter wrapped his other hand round Draco’s throat and gripped hard.
“No! Draco anyone could come up those stairs.”
Draco shrugged.
“How does a giant smuggle anything?”
Harry nodded. He took a scrap of paper off Draco’s desk and scribbled his floo address on it. Draco grinned.
“Thanks. Bloody stung,” Harry admitted.
“I think I need something stronger.”
“Yes Potterrr...” Draco hissed behind him, grabbing his hips and moving faster.
“This is your final dance class, so I expect you to
“You’re the one that hit me and nearly got us fired!” Draco said.
Draco rolled his eyes.
“You have fun without me, Potter. There’s a trunk under the bed, if you feel the need for assistance.”
“Are you?”
“Oh.” She didn’t blush in the slightest. “Well, have you thought about the fact that you might just fancy him?”
“Good. I’m glad you’re satisfied with my technique.”
“Can we come in?”
“You’re not the only one who can turn invisible, Potter.”
“Would you like a straw?” Harry drawled at him. Malfoy glared at him. Harry smiled, glad to be annoying him.
Draco looked like he was going to make a witty retort when they heard a spine chilling scream from the house.
“Fuck!”
Harry sighed.
“You keep talking to me like that, Potter...see how far it gets you.”
“Yeah,” Draco said.
“Okay.” Harry forced a smile as they walked out.
For once Malfoy looked completed dumbfounded.
“You’re gonna love it. Trust me.”
“Yeah? Good?”
“Wh-what are you doing?” Harry had forgotten how to breathe.
It was dark. It felt late. Early morning, Harry guessed.
“It’s a shame it's so important that I remain at Hogwarts, or I’d leave this ridiculous class.” Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically and put his hand on Harry’s waist.
“Ah fuck!” Harry nearly over balanced, groaning at the feel of the back of Draco’s throat contracting around his cock. Draco sucked him hard and eager. “Jesus Draco that’s so good... Oh... Oh... God.”
“Dra—”
“I just want to say, that this is a fucking awful idea,” Harry said.
“I got back early, luckily for you.” Draco kissed him softly on the lips. “You still not talking to me?”
“Boys generally know not to break the locked curtain rule,” Draco drawled.
Draco started to fuck him against the counter and Harry groaned, Draco was still so insistently kissing him, making him lose it far quicker than usual. He was whining into Draco’s kisses now, this felt better than anything they’d ever done before. It wasn’t fucked up, it wasn’t pain, it wasn’t toys, it wasn’t teasing, it was just pure sex. And he wasn’t pushing Draco from his mind anymore, wasn’t shutting him out, or bothering to feel like a traitor. He was embracing that it was Draco, gorgeous bastard that he was, fucking his brains out. And god, like this, as Draco was kissing him so desperately Harry realised Draco was completely right. The elation of finally letting go and admitting his feelings to himself was a rush and a relief that drove him even higher.
They lay in the gold glowing light of their sleeping bags staring at the ceiling listening to the rain pound down on their newly enchanted tent.
Harry pulled back Draco’s sleeping bag, pulled off his top, and groaned at the pale skin he exposed. Draco kicked off his trousers and Harry pushed his hand into his boxers, wrapping his large hand round Draco’s cock.
This brought Draco round and he smirked at Harry as he remembered where he was.
Draco grabbed Harry’s cock and pulled him over the edge with him.
The malicious look in Draco’s eyes as he watched him was making Harry so hard it hurt, his own fingers weren’t helping the matter. They were nothing compared to Draco’s but it had been so long it wasn’t taking much. Draco watched Harry get breathless and flushed with clear satisfaction. He started stroking his own cock in time with Harry’s; matching the death glare Harry was giving him with one of sheer enjoyment.
Harry laughed.
“Do you have any other coffee?” Harry asked the teenager sitting behind the glass staring at his phone.
“Very?”
“Right, Harry?” Ron asked.
Two more boxes were unpacked but the contents were obscured. Harry snapped a couple more pictures of the men, the van and the license plate. The men got in the van, slammed the doors shut and drove off into the night.
Harry grinned, he felt good. He was full, complete, and soaring towards an incredible orgasm when the spell pinched around his cock.
“Yeah, yeah, of course. Hope you feel better soon.”
Harry cursed under his breath again, dripped some of the oil onto his fingers and pushed one inside Draco’s hot tight arse.
“What do you think Potter? You like it?”  Draco rocked back and forth on his cock and Harry swore he nearly blacked out.
“What’s that?!”
“Anywhere that’s not a fucking tent.”
“Harry don’t be dramatic, it’s probably just a crush potion, it’ll wear off.”
“Best get on with it then.” Draco wrapped his hand round Harry’s cock and Harry yelped.
Everything was going to be okay. He had just got to the tips of Harry’s fingers on the last arm when he stopped, stooped down and whispered in Harry’s ear.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fuck off.”
Draco’s lips were inches from his, his grey eyes sparkling bright.
He gasped his breath back and looked up at Draco. Draco was panting, but somehow still grinning above him, as he finally came to a stop and collapsed on top of him.
“Because I’m a spy for the Order.”
“How’s that Potter?”
“Desperate boy. Was yesterday not good enough for you, hm?”
“Oh thank god your alive,” Harry sighed.
The room was buzzing with activity as Mrs Weasley prepared them a feast. Spoons stirred and knives chopped away. She stood in the centre of the room with her apron on, her hands on her hips and a determined look in her eyes. Doing what she did best.
Harry did and bit his lip slightly.
“Christ. That seems like forever ago.”
“Five, six, seven, eight...“ McGonagall counted.
He put on his clothes and shuffled down to breakfast with Ron and Hermione. Hermione didn’t say anything, just looked him over quickly to check he was okay.
“What? Defeat the dark lord? Of course you can’t, Potter. You’re 17.”
“Thank you.”
He soaked himself a while longer. Fantasising about what would happen if Draco were to come and knock, let himself in at that very moment. Come in and find him naked in the bath. Draco would call out to him, then find him in the bathroom. He’d smile, an unguarded, genuine smile, and his clothes would fall to the floor.
Harry raised his wand up to him.
Harry moaned, rubbing his cock up against the sheets. He’d been close before with the toy, now it was agonising.
“Yes, Hermione, I think I just need to go to bed and sleep it off.”
Harry pushed his now fully hard cock back inside Draco’s tight arse. He groaned at the heat and bit down on Draco’s shoulder. Draco squealed and pushed himself back on Harry’s cock hard.
Draco smirked and pulled himself up off the floor.
“Cleared. As if, Potter. As if anyone would give a Malfoy a job. A flat. A loan. Sam on the other hand has no problems.”
Kingsley and Tonks put their hands up.
“Do it, Potter.”
Two hexes went flying at Malfoy that Harry deflected easily.
Harry smiled. He could get used to this. He could get really fucking used to this. Draco groaned as Harry fucked him with soapy fingers.
Draco walked over and opened it.
“Take off your shirt.”
Harry let out a strangled moan.
“Could you warm it up a bit?”
Harry spluttered.
Harry’s gaze snapped to Draco’s. Draco was looking at him blankly and pushed his thumb into the curve of Harry’s foot when he didn’t respond. Harry cried out then bit his tongue at the delighted look on Draco’s face.
“What?”
“Minor.”
“I was not whinging,” Malfoy huffed, trying to negotiate picking up a cup of tea with his handcuffs on.
Harry did not know how he’d got this drunk. Or got pulled into this game of spin the bottle. He just knew the world was fuzzy, and he didn’t seem to care. He was sitting in the Ravenclaw common room with only a vague notion of how he’d got there. Ron was on the other side of the room playing some sort of drinking game of wizard’s chest and roaring at the top of his lungs. Hermione was sitting next to Harry laughing her head off.
Draco looked around for a table.
Harry let out a choked sound.
“Don’t get to used to this, Potter.”
“Honestly, Potter. I think you need a house elf.”
Draco pulled away abruptly, grabbed his bag and was out the door before Harry could stop him.
“What, right now?”
“And my clothes are covered in dust,” Malfoy added.
“Holy shit.” Harry focused on the poor brightly feathered bird as the two men staggered with it across the gravel driveway, skidding and crunching their way towards the door. He snapped.
The Death Eater shoved Harry through the basement door. He hadn’t got a look at which one it was.
Harry flushed and shook his head.
Draco let Harry’s cock drop from his mouth a laughed at the look on Harry’s face.
“I know. He told me. He told me to do it, but I still fucking couldn’t.” Draco shook his head.
“Minister, you
“Fuck. Malfoy. I...that feels really good...”
Harry kissed him again, hard and long and moaned into his mouth before resting his head in the crook of Draco’s neck, revelling in the smell of sweat and sex and the heat of Draco’s body against his own.
“Malfoy looks like shit,” Ron said. “Looks like whatever daddies asked him to do isn’t going so well.”
He glanced down at his pyjamas, wondering quite how many stains they had down them. Judging by the twitching of Draco’s lips he imagined there were several. In his panic Harry smelt the dinner Draco had brought with him before he saw the plates levitating behind his head. Stew. It smelt better than Mrs Weasley’s, and that was saying something.
His body kept tensing, ready to spill over, to come harder than he ever had in his life. Draco had other ideas.
Draco groaned and pushed himself up against Harry from behind, dragging his teeth down his neck.
He dropped his dressing gown on the floor and slid under the water. He sighed out loud, wondering if life ever was going to stop throwing ridiculous obstacles in his way. Mind you, he supposed once he used to view Draco Malfoy as a ridiculous obstacle. It took him a good ten minutes to defrost in the almost scalding hot water. He toyed with the idea of going downstairs and knocking on Draco’s door. He knew which one it was, but Draco was surely asleep, and wouldn’t appreciate being woken up at the crack of dawn by his delusional boss.
Malfoy grabbed him and slammed him back up against the door. He whispered a spell under his breath and Harry felt rough rope tying tight around his wrists, pulling them together behind his back.
“What are we having?”
“Draco!” They both turned to the door as they heard his father’s voice.
Harry took a deep breath and ran his hand down Draco’s back and in between his arse cheeks.
He could tell Draco was fighting to keep a straight face and not roll his eyes.
Harry stomach rumbled in protest of missing lunch.
“Fuck!” Harry’s head dropped back.
“No,” Draco shook his head. “No I want you.”
“Letting off some steam? Wondering just how big the boy wonders dick is?”
“Do they now?” Harry stared at the house some more. “We should call in.”
“I feel bad for them.”
“Who the fuck cares?”
Harry took a deep breath. Apparently what Draco was waiting for as he pushed inside him.
“What makes you think I know anything? Or that I’d tell you if I did?”
Draco kicked off his trousers and boxers and did as he was told.
Draco smirked at him.
“If you’re that worried about it go to one of the teachers,” she huffed.
He turned.
He shivered.
“We can’t do this, Draco!”
“Maybe I’ll come to you after.”
It surpassed everything. Every wet dream, every fantasy, every night spent pumping his cock with the curtains round. Harry couldn’t even compare the two in his head. The heat of Draco, the weight of him as he pushed against him. He shuddered.
“Pretty please?” Draco drawled in his ear slowing his strokes to almost a stop.
Draco sighed a long breath out as he followed his ‘father’ into the adjoining room.
“I’m not leaving you alone with him for a second,” she hissed.
“This train terminates here. All change please, all change.”
“Draco, we’re needed...elsewhere,” he said, looking at Harry. “A few days, we need to leave in half an hour. Be down in the hall. He stays here.”
“Well, I guess we’ll see who’s right then.”
“Well, I’m sure they cleaned the place and changed the sheets before you moved in. Where’s your coffee machine?”
Harry did as he was told and Draco squealed, so Harry did it to his heart’s content, filling the apartment with Draco’s squeals and cries as he shook above him. He lost count of the amount of times he would have come by now, if it wasn’t for that wretched/amazing spell of Draco’s.
Harry frowned.
Draco took his hand away and Harry squirmed, feeling his body getting desperate.
The door burst off its hinges.
“Family don’t do this to each other.” Draco looked down at his emancipated body.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said as they walked to Harry’s room. “I was reckless. I should have just taken you out of the mansion. I could have got us both killed.”
Sexually, yes, he had consented, against most of his better judgement, but how could he help it when it felt so good? Mentally, no, he had never, ever, agreed to what Malfoy had done to his mind. It wasn’t healthy to desire someone so and hate them in equal amounts, it wasn’t healthy to hate yourself for it after, to feel your whole body turn on you and everything you used to believe in.
“Stay behind me,” he said.
Harry wished he’d never asked.
Potter put his hand over Draco’s eye before he could see who responded, who moved. Who’s hot mouth wrapped around his cock as Potter’s thumbs spread him again and pushed his cock back inside.
Draco laughed softly in his ear.
“Look, Malfoy. I won’t tell the teachers. I don’t need to know why. I just need to know what it is so I can reverse it.”
“Oh shit, do you want me to bring you some painkillers? Some breakfast?”
“Not everyone pays as much attention to us, Granger. Well, maybe to the golden boy. But certainly not me.”
“I mean,” Harry said as Draco rested his forehead against his. “I was thinking more dinner…somewhere nice?”
“It’s alright, Potter. I know what I’m doing.”
“Yeah?”
Draco grinned at him and waved his wand, cleaning them both up. He kissed Harry again and Harry kissed him back, still stunned, groaning inwardly at the warm feeling spreading through him as Draco wrapped his arms and legs around him.
Draco ignored him and squeezed him tighter than he’d ever done before.
Harry pushed another finger inside and moved his fingers faster.
“This one,” Harry said to him curtly, following him into the kitchen. “Sit down.”
Draco grinned.
“Well he already hates me, so.”
“Would you like that?”
Draco nodded. When had Potter become this fucking sexy?
“Who was it?” Draco asked.
Harry jumped at Draco’s hand back on his dick.
Draco thrust inside him hard and Harry’s mind exploded.
“I wondered what you were up to in here, Malfoy, in the girl's bathroom, in the middle of the night.”
“I’m gonna go get dressed first, I’ll meet you back at the manor.”
“And if he wants to switch sides, come to us, fine, but I don’t see that happening. Do you?”
He took Harry’s cock back in his mouth, sucked and bobbed his head till Harry was flying towards the edge again, 100mph, he groaned as he hit it again, that invisible wall. He twisted and moaned, desperate, but completely unable. Draco pulled back and let him catch his breath before doing it again, and again, till Harry was nearly screaming the place down in frustration.
“No! Of course not. Can you imagine? I’m just saying maybe you shouldn’t feel so awful about it. Crushes pass.”
Harry turned, his cheeks burning, as he lay flat on his back. He kept his eyes closed. He didn’t want to see the tented towel he knew was covering his groin.
“Now. What were you saying?”
“I told you, I hate the taste,” Draco said to him, before turning and stepping into the shower.
“Potter is an acceptable Auror.”
Harry gasped as Draco pushed his finger all the way inside him, then slowly started to move.
“That’s it, good boy. I’m gonna let you come now. Give me a pretty little please.”
Low laughter came from the hall.
“Mmm I bet. No. Patience is a virtue, darling.”
“Are you sure?”
Harry glared up at him and missed a step, tripped and fell on Malfoy. Malfoy laughed, cruel as always.
“No, no, it’s fine, this must mean it’s working!”
“Oh god that’s good. Draco that feels really good,” he babbled.
“What could I possibly say?” Harry said eventually.
“What?”
“Hours...” Malfoy laughed again and reached up and grabbed the back of Harry’s hair, pulling him roughly into a kiss. Harry pushed him back.
“Yeah.”
Major was ashen faced and out of breath. He wasn’t usual one to overly panic. He was a rational man.
Harry knew he should go after them. Raise the alarm. He imagined it had already been raised.
“Oh god yes,” Draco said, wiggling his hips until the entire of Harry’s length was buried inside him. Harry put his hands on the small of Draco’s back. Draco took a handful of Harry’s hair and yanked his head back, kissing him hard as he put his other hand on the back of the chair and started to ride him.
“Come on then, which potion you were trying?” She walked to the sinks to swill out the cauldron.
“That’s not a bad thing.”
“Why don’t they levitate it? You think they’re muggles?”
“No, no, I like it. You’re…” he couldn’t find the word.
Draco grabbed his arse and pulled him down harder. Harry moaned, tangling a hand in Draco’s hair and biting Draco’s neck.
“What? How?” Harry spluttered, watching the water trickling towards his pillow.
“Mmm so good, Potter. I think I’m gonna stay here tonight, after I’ve fucked you senseless, then in the morning, when all your little goodie two shoes Gryffindor friends are just waking up I’m going to gag you and pound you into this mattress again.”
Harry complied with shaky hands.
“I haven’t since the end of the war. I don’t like wearing masks to those places, and Malfoy’s aren’t exactly welcome.”
“I’m enjoying watching you squirm to be honest.” He pushed hard on Draco’s prostate and watched him tremble.
“I should have never gone with them,” Draco said eventually. “I don’t know how I could be so stupid.”
He stroked their cocks together and Draco moaned.
Draco groaned above him, loud and long, and Harry shuddered. He had desperately missed that sound. Harry pushed his head forward, his throat contracted, objected, relented.
“Love?”
“I feel like if you were going to kill him, you’d have done it by now. Don’t let him do anything stupid.”
He needed to get home before he made even more of an idiot of himself. Draco went out to the lobby to make the phone call.
“He’s asleep.”
His heart twisted, were Ron and Hermione safe? Who else had they killed to get this far? Harry prayed no one had stood in their way.
“Its never just sex.”
“Mhmm,” Draco agreed.
“You afraid of me, Potter?”
He pushed open the bathroom door and frowned. The shower was running but Draco was standing by the sink, bent over.
Draco was in heaven. He’d gone slack on the stool, letting Potter do whatever the hell he wanted with him, as long as he kept fucking him he didn’t care about how.
“It spits at me.”
Hermione turned and looked between them.
“I could strangle you,” Harry said seriously.
“It’s good. Promise.”
He blinked.
“Oh of course. I should have known as you’re about the same age.”
Harry nodded, trying to get his breath back and regain some composure. He took another sip of coffee.
“Yes. Fuck yes.”
He thought of the least sexual thing he could imagine. He thought about the time Hagrid had taken him out to the Forbidden Forest to help him shovel Centaur manure into a giant wheelbarrow. Hagrid swore it was the best fertilizer he’d ever used in his life. Harry had spent the entire three hours breathing through his mouth and trying not to pass out. The memory worked well. His body relaxed, more intent on repulsion that arousal, and Harry managed to close his eyes without the imagine of Malfoy popping up again.
“I’m going to sleep.” Harry went to roll off him but Draco grabbed his hips and pulled him down on top of him.
“If what? If you had your fingers in my arse?” Draco chuckled. Draco moved his other hand to Harry’s cock “Maybe next time.”
“Potter! My arm!”
They watched in mystified horror as the muggles unpacked the cages one by one and took them into the house. They never saw the owner.
He finally relaxed into the bed, laced his fingers through Draco’s, and closed his eyes.
Love Potion.
He didn’t move from his seat though, didn’t say a thing, just sat continuing to feed Malfoy his breakfast.
“Yeah right.”
“Why don’t you come with me to the club tonight?” Draco purred in his ear.
Harry rolled eyes.
“Fucking hell.” Draco grinned into his neck. “Good for you too, Potter?”
“Because you’re an arrogant, self-righteous, mudblood piece of shit, and it’s never. Going. To. Happen.”
“What the fuck are you doing?”
He took Harry’s chin and tilted it towards him. He took his bottom lip inbetween his teeth and pulled. Harry was embarrassed by quite how quickly his cock hardened again. Draco stroked their cocks together under the water, kissing Harry slowly. He spun Harry round so Draco sat astride his lap instead.
“He’s never hurt anyone Hermione. Not really. He can’t help who his parents are.”
Harry grunted in agreement and zipped up the tent. Malfoy had already lay down with the lamp by his head.
“Where’s Narcissa?”
“Of course not!”
“It’s Christmas!”
Harry laughed, overjoyed to hear Draco’s sarcastic tone again.
“Malfoy, don’t,” Harry said in the sternest voice he could muster, following Draco up the stairs. He didn’t know why he bothered, he knew it had been a while, but he very much doubted Draco’s refusal to listen to anything he said would have changed.
“Come on, Potter, don’t you remember how much fun we had in the bath?”
Draco cleaned himself up with a flick of his wand and let himself fall down on top of Harry on the floor.
“Hermione said to come and check you were still alive. Also, it’s time for breakfast.”
“Potter? What’s wrong?”
“Shall we try?”
He climbed out from under the grate, his feet felt like lead, sounded like lead, in the now silent office. This place, a beacon of hope and security for so many years, felt cold and dark. He knelt crawled across the floor to Dumbledore’s body, unable to bring himself to his feet. He lay across him, his head on Dumbledore’s chest. The intricate beading of Dumbledore’s cloak began to dig into Harry cheek. He didn’t care. He wept.
“I know, I don’t think I want to see another tent for a million years.”
“That’s it…” Potter soothed, slowly stretching him with his fingers.
“Lie on your side. I knew you wouldn’t prepare yourself properly, but I really wanted to watch for a bit...so...”
Harry blinked.
“You getting this?”
Harry pulled back and wished he hadn’t, Draco’s lust filled stare destroyed any resolve he had left to resist.
“Mmm, nothing ever sounded so sweet,” he purred in his ear. “But not today darling.”
“Please. Fuck. Draco. Please.”
“That’s the end of your treatment, Mr Potter.”
“A little.”
Malfoys mouth twitched.
“Yeah sure.” Draco rolled Harry onto his back. He put his thighs either side of Harry’s hips and laced his fingers through Harry’s, holding them down on the floor.
The voice,
Harry sighed in relief as he touched his broomstick down onto the tarmac, hearing a similar noise from Hermione as she touched down next to him. They’d been gone a month and Harry was exhausted, he hated sleeping in tents. The fact that they were tents that might be about to be ripped apart by Death Eaters in the middle of the night whilst he was sound asleep didn’t really help. They took turns taking watch, and it wasn’t that he didn’t trust Hermione, but he still didn’t feel completely safe.
Draco kissed him through the steam, long and lazy. Draco was bliss. His mouth, his hands, his smell. His fingers that were back on his cock, stroking him again.
Harry collapsed on top of him.
“How are you at charms?” Harry said warily, he’d never had charms with the Slytherins.
“I’m just glad to be back home.”
“Yes! Yes! Fuck yes!” he cried, coming hard and shaking against the door. Harry felt the tremors down to his toes and his fingertips, trying desperately to gasp some air into his tight chest. With a finally shudder Harry came back to earth and gasped a proper breath in, wincing as Draco slid his fingers out.
“Do you want to know why you’re so angry, Potter?”
“Yeah,” Harry added.
He warily stepped through the parted bricks into a seemingly empty room. He’d never seen it like this before. Bare brick walls, stripped back wooden floor, not even a chair. He checked his watch: 1202. The bricks clicked into life again and Harry turned to face them, slid his wand from his sleeve down into his hand.
“Yes minister?”
Harry groaned and moved onto his front, screwing his hands up in the bedsheets.
Harry couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t talk.
Harry fucked him harder and groaned, coming perilously close to orgasm.
Harry managed to cast a cleansing spell on the tap before the water hit Draco’s mouth. He gulped it down and Harry winced. He looked around the rest of the room. There was a toilet in the corner that didn’t smell like it had any running water to it for quite some time. Once Draco had finished drinking he snatched the wand out of Harry’s hand, spelled the toilet clean and spelled the dishes to start washing themselves. He flicked Harry’s wand at a broom in the corner and it sprung to life cleaning the place.
Draco grabbed a handful of his right arse cheek.
Harry felt hard wood push up his back and groaned again but his head fell into the coach this time, as Malfoy pushed it up his back.
“Yeah, their orifices are bigger too.”
“Why?”
Draco’s mouth twitched.
“Disguise. Didn’t want to attract too much attention breaking in here.”
“Fucking hell, Potter,” Draco said breathlessly. “I wish you could see what you looked like right now.”
Harry was digging his own grave though, he knew he couldn’t come. He was driving himself towards the edge when he knew he couldn’t go over it. Malfoy grinned as he saw him growl in frustration. A beautiful noise Harry often made during their time together. He put his head back and let himself feel the sheer pleasure of Harry’s tight arse on his cock; that and the sight of Harry above him was quickly undoing him. He knew he needed this as well, not that he’d ever tell Harry that.
Draco pushed two cold fingers inside him and Harry tensed, usually Draco spent a fair amount of time playing with his cock before he went anywhere near his arse.
“But you never came so hard?”
Draco slapped his arse.
“I might have to start bringing you food packages more often.”
“Marvellous. Fix it.”
“Well why then?”
Ink appeared on the page.
He looked up at Harry, his grey eyes full of mischief as he took Harry’s cock in his hand.
Harry didn’t reply. He had no idea how to.
Draco only glanced at him before going to sit down with his fellow Slytherins.
“How dare you?” Hermione slapped him. “He’s my best friend.”
Draco reached out blindly, finding Harry’s face and flinging himself on him. Draco knocked Harry down onto his back, making sure any part of him that hadn’t been bruised by the steps didn’t feel left out.
“Everything okay?” Harry asked.
“Well you do now. Fill me Potter, come on.”
Malfoy walked towards him and didn’t stop till he had Harry pushed fully against the brick wall of the tower.
Harry nodded.
“Easy there, Auror Potter,” Malfoy drawled, apparently unconcerned at having Harry’s wand thrust in his direction.
“I was just winding you up. Don’t pretend it didn’t make you harder.”
“I’ll give you some privacy.”
“It’s okay. I soundproofed it.” Kingsley said.
“Yeah that’s what I thought, Potter.”
“Fuck him.”
Draco laughed and took his wand from the side, whispering something under his breath. Harry groaned as all the satisfaction he’d felt disappeared;  replaced by a lust so blinding he could barely think clear enough to realise it was that god damn spell again. He felt his cock growing rock hard.
Harry groaned, pounding him hard and sending himself rushing towards his own orgasm.
Draco turned round and smiled at him.
“Are you out of your mind, Potter?”
“Bend over.” Potter moved to the side and pushed him down over the stool that Draco was sure wasn’t there a minute ago. Bloody Potter. He put his weight on it.
Draco looked up at him with an unkind smile.
“Yes. Fuck. That was.”
Harry tried but all that came out was muffles. Draco grinned and pressed up against him once more, biting the most sensitive part of his neck that he’d carefully left exposed. Harry wrapped his arms around him tightly, pulling him in closer, breathing him in. He felt himself running his hands all over him. Good wasn’t the word to describe having Draco so close to him again, the word was sinful.
Harry frowned.
“I’m an Auror!”
“I never said I didn’t care. I said I didn’t know, and I hadn’t asked.”
He crossed his legs and watched her work, wondering if he could learn something.
“I’m coming to realise that now.”
“You’re not gonna jump, are you, Potter?” he froze at the sound of Malfoy’s voice behind him. “Wasn’t that bad, was it?”
“I think I was born middle aged, actually.”
“Sex. I keep thinking about having sex with him, Hermione, and kissing him.”
“Wait! Draco!”
“Obviously. Too smart for her own good that one.”
Harry sat next to Draco in the office. They had identical sullen looks on their faces as their squad lead Morgan stood in front of them with her arms folded.
Harry watched from the bed, still unable to move as Draco put on his clothes from yesterday, which were now significantly cleaner. Harry didn’t know when he’d cleaned them without him noticing. He picked out some clothes from Harry’s wardrobe and threw them over to him, waving his wand and Harry found himself dressed.
“You actually know what you’re doing?” Harry asked.
“Harry? Harry! Are you okay?” Hermione’s voice. Harry froze. Stark naked in his bed with his lover laid next to him. “I brought you some breakfast, some painkillers and a cold press for you head. I always find that helps when I have migraines.”
Draco cut him off with his mouth, grabbed Harry’s wrists and pulled them behind the chair, touched his wand on the table and whispered something under his breath. Rope lashed round Harry’s wrists.
“Seen it all before, haven’t you Granger?”
“Are you okay, Minister?”
“Hold still a sec,”
The smell of coffee filled his nostrils as he kept it balanced on his chest. It brought him round a little from his tipsy stupor. He looked away quickly and took a swig of the coffee.
“Oh poor thing.” He fucked him hard, making Draco shriek.
It was hard to tell from Draco’s face. He was grimacing and pale, but then when was he not?
“Harry...be careful...” Hermione warned him.
“Yeah you like it stretching you out? Like feeling all full and fucked you slut?”
“Oh, come on now.” McGonagall rolled her eyes at them. “Mr Malfoy, you lead. It’s just dancing, honestly.”
“A little bit,” Harry admitted.
Draco moaned in his ear and jutted his hips against Harry before Harry had even pushed his fingers inside. Harry shuddered.
“So you’re hoping they’ll think you’ve got kidnapped or something?”
“Oh Harry...fuck...” Draco cried out as he came inside him. “Baby I love you too...you’re so beautiful...”
Potter grinned.
“Damp,” Draco replied.
“Hands up on the door, Potter. Palms flat. Good boy. Yeah you like that, you little slut? Like that fucking you? Stretching you out?”
“Oh Potter, so
“Draco, yes, yes…”
He traced his fingers round the dark ink on Draco’s pale, almost hairless skin.
He was expecting Potter’s eyes to slide right off him, dismiss him, maybe blush, and never mention it again. Especially not at work. Potter didn’t stare at him at work. He avoided his eyes, gave him an unconvincing half smile and went about his business. They worked on different floors. Draco being far too lowly to be up on the same floor as the Aurors. To be honest, he was surprised he was even allowed in the building.
“Speak for yourself,” Draco muttered. “No. I’ve had a lot worse down there.”
Harry glared at her and she laughed, pushing a book towards him.
“No...Draco...” Harry stammered, knowing exactly what he was about to do with it.
Tonks pushed open the door.
“Are you okay?” Harry ran his hands down Draco’s ribs, even more prominent that usual.
“That I’m shagging Draco Malfoy?”
Harry and Draco were silent as they stood in front of each other. Draco put his hand on Harry’s waist and took his hand. Harry resisted the urge to wrap his arms around him.
Harry bit his lip.
“You’re beautiful,” Harry countered.
“Any deaths?”
Harry shuddered.
Draco grinned.
Harry was beyond grateful for Hemione not throwing a million and one questions at him. About his sexuality, his preferences, what he was going to do about it. She was shocked, but she wasn’t appalled. She didn’t know what he’d done last night.
Draco laughed.
He brought his flat palm down in Harry’s arse cheek and Harry’s whole body spasmed.
“Draco, fuck, stop I’m gonna…”
Draco cupped Harry’s face gently with his hand.
“He cursed that necklace!”
Draco nodded like surely this was obvious.
“Keep your hands on the wall.”
“If that’s even why you’re here.”
“You always this demanding?”
Malfoy just laughed, pushing himself up against him, getting him covered in the dust from the cellar.
“I always liked swimming outdoors,” Draco drawled.
“Go fuck yourself,” Harry spat.
“Fuck me over the table.”
Draco gave him such a familiar condescending look that Harry grinned. That was the Draco he remembered. Not the stone-faced polite assistant he shared an office with now.
“Maths.”
Harry pulled up a chair next to him and laced his fingers through Draco’s. Draco gripped hard as Mrs Weasley began stitching the skin back together.
“Sure I’ll find another that will tolerate me.”
“Choke me.”
“Yeah I can read it myself, Potter, thanks.” Malfoy snatched the file off the desk.
“Everyone out? No more prisoners?” Moody shouted.
Draco didn’t answer, he was too busy ripping off his clothes, now that he’d transformed the tap into a shower. Harry jumped out of the way of the manically cleaning broom.
Harry sighed, he was cold, and miserable. Getting fired didn’t seem that bad right now. He muttered under his breath, the tent glowed and shimmered, shivered, and the water ran back out the tent.
“Well, if you insist.”
“I know. I plan to disable them before they can call.”
“You always change your mind so suddenly?” He pulled Harry in before he had time to answer and kissed him. Harry froze, wanking each other off was one thing, kissing was another. The idea of having the Prince of Darkness tongue inside his mouth was alarming.
“Thanks Sally.”
Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry ignored him. Trying to hide the limp from his tumble and stalked off down the corridor.
The idea of Malfoy coming inside him made Harry even harder. Draco grinned.
“Fuck yes, Potter,
Malfoy had long ago let go of Harry’s hand. He was keeping it on Malfoy’s crotch completely of his own volition. Harry took a deep breath and pushed his hand down, his heart skipping at Malfoy’s gasp. The bulge grew under his hand and Harry’s fascination with Malfoy’s rapid breathing took over his nerves. He pushed his hand under Malfoy’s waist band, wrapping his hand round his hot cock.
Draco let out a silent groan, Potter’s grip was firm, just the right pressure, as his other hand moved in and out of him.
“Ohhh. You want to go for a ride now? We are making progress with that denial of yours aren’t we. God, your parents would be so proud.”
“Steps.” The voice finished as he landed at the bottom.
“Yep.” Harry disentangled himself from Draco and pulled his clothes back on fast, trying to catch his breath, looking at his watch again. “That was possibly irresponsible of me.”
“I’d be very careful of that boy if I were you.”
Draco eventually broke eye contact and took the coffees upstairs.
“Called it,” Draco said where he was crouched on the floor.
Malfoy grabbed him by the cloak and whirled him round, pushing him back up against the sink.
Harry looked at him, perplexed.
“She says we’re being reckless.”
He groaned in spite of himself as Harry moved faster, he could feel himself getting close...so close...but it just wasn’t quite...he sighed in frustration.
“You’re no killer, Draco.” Dumbledore echoed the words Harry had said to Draco countless times over the past weeks.
“Not everything has to be a competition, Draco.”
“What?”
“We?! I’ve not got a fucking wand!” Malfoy objected though he was already pulling on his clothes.
Draco did as he was told as Potter moved his hand from his eyes to his neck instead and start to squeeze.
“Ever had your cock sucked, Potter?”
“They’ve allocated you a flat in the Ministry Apartments. Fully furnished.” He handed him a key. “Flat 309.”
Harry was straddled on Malfoy’s lap on window ledge in the astronomy Tower, snogging him within an inch of his life. They lost themselves, pushing their bodies harder together, reveling in the friction, the pressure. They’d never done it like this, out in the open, but Draco had tempted him up there saying it was a beautiful evening. It was a beautiful evening, a huge glowing moon hung in the clear dark sky. It was also bloody freezing. Harry didn’t care.
Draco smirked.
“Oh god,” he moaned. “Draco that feels so good.”
“Firewhiskey, please, Draco?”
Hermione turned and gave them their breakfast. Malfoy coughed pointedly and Harry realised that there was no way he was going to be able to eat with the handcuffs on.
Harry cautiously stepped into the shower, thinking that in fairness, he was now covered in half of Malfoy’s dust and could do with washing it off.
Harry pulled back the door.
Draco shuddered underneath him.
“I don’t think so, I think I just need some more sleep. Could you turn the light off?”
Harry was too busy trying to breathe to retort.
Potter leant on the cage from the other side. He had an intimidating bulge in his jeans. He didn’t speak. He just gave Draco a sly smile and knocked on the bars.
“Why shouldn’t I? You’re a coward...a spy for the Order? More like hiding behind daddy’s sofa till the war is over...you disgust me...”
She narrowed her eyes at him.
Draco smiled to himself as he traces his fingers across Harry’s chest.
“I mean, idiot, it usually takes me about half an hour the first time. So, do you want to put a movie on or something?”
“Pleassse Potter,” Draco purred underneath him and Harry nearly came.
Draco laughed.
He’d delicately step into the water, in that delicate way that he did everything, barely making a splash, and would lie down on top of Harry. He’d slide on top of him, kiss him, their hot naked bodies together.
“Truth hurts, Potter. Truth hurts. Well, you go back to sleep then if you’re not interested.”
He was awake late one night, Draco had gone and slept in his own bed for a change, to see if it might help him sleep better. Harry had suggested sleeping potions but Draco said they didn’t work on him. Something in Harry snapped. He got out of bed, put on his slippers and dressing gown and marched to Dumbledore’s office.
“I thought I was your new favourite partner. You only want me for my magic.”
Draco sighed, stood up properly and crossed his wrists in front of his waist. Harry felt strangely proud of him, for not running, not hiding, not pleading or cursing at the jury like so many of their prisoners had today. He looked smart and respectable in his long black dress robes, his platinum hair and ivory skin shone in the candle light. He didn’t look haggard and unkempt like so many of their visitors today. Harry thought with a strange twinge in his chest that his father would be proud of him, if he’d been around to see it.
“Right, turn over.”
Malfoy just smirked at him. Harry hit him on the arm.
Draco ignored them and went over to the two-way mirror that gave him a perfect view of Harry tearing his hair out.
“Move.” Harry was pushed out the way by Molly Weasley.
Harry groaned.
The candles were dim in the dungeons. They had been running these trials all day. Harry approximated the candles had only half an inch of wax left. Now, mentally exhausted, desperate for sunlight and if he was honest, a little bored, Harry found his eyes meeting Draco Malfoy’s. He was far too tried for what he was about to do.
They’d muted the sound feed from room and everyone but Kingsley had left. Draco looked through the glass and saw why. Harry was hunched over the bed, wanking himself silly, one hand on his cock and the other tangled in his hair. Draco pulled up a seat and leant his head on his hands, watching the boy wonder flushed and gasping on the edge of his bed.
“Fuck, you’re meant to still have those handcuffs on...” Harry looked about him, panicked.
They dumped their bags in the hold at the end of the cabin and found their seats. Harry groaned inwardly, the carriage was jam packed, save for two seats next to each other with tickets sticking out the top.
“Mostly I just enjoy torturing you.”
Harry groaned.
“What if she finds out? Kicks us out?”
They were both silent for a few minutes. Harry concentrated on the sound of knives and forks scraping on plates and not on the look on Hermione’s face. She went to turn her head.
Harry considered faking a sudden stomach upset.
“Of course I’m interested in you!” Harry deliberately side stepped the question and laughed, blowing on his coffee.
Harry could have punched him in the face. He knew he only said it to get a rise out of Ron, but he knew that he was going to have to say something.
“Oh...Draco...Draco...god I love you…” it was out of his mouth before he realised what he was going to say.
“Lie down on your back.”
“Relax, I’m qualified you know, or, Sam is anyway. I’m quite good at it I’m told.”
“I’m terrified.”
Draco sucked him hard, faster than he would have liked for the first time in so long. But as Harry had said himself, they definitely didn’t have all night.
“Of course I don’t.” Harry understood this at least, he’d had his fair share of people trying to ‘fix’ him.
Harry didn’t feel nearly tired enough to sleep, but didn’t really see what else there was to do. He slid down and rested his head on the pillow and felt Draco do the same. He flicked the light off with his wand and lay on his side, facing away from Draco. Within about five minutes he felt Draco’s arm round his waist and his chest against his back as he cuddled up to him. It sent all kinds of confusing messages through his head and he tensed.
He put his mouth to Harry’s neck and bit down.
In Harry’s fantasies there would be some reason he could trust Draco, blackmail, an unbreakable vow, a reason they could be together. In reality there was absolutely no reason to trust Draco. Yet he was showing no resistance as Draco pushed him back against the sinks, plunging his hand inside his trousers.
Harry sighed.
“Bloody uncomfortable things,” Harry said.
Harry’s hips jerked without him meaning to and Draco gasped.
The popping of the Death Eaters apparating back interrupted them.
“I don’t know. It didn’t sound so bad. Sugar?”
“How did you get in here?” Harry’s confusion distracted him from his throbbing cock for a second.
“Still working at this time you?” Major said. “I was worried I’d wake you. I clearly should have known better.”
“Harder?”
“God you’re so sexy...”
“Moody teach you that too?”
“I don’t think your daddy would like it very much if you brought me home.”
Draco smiled against his lips, sensing the shift in him.
Harry just grinned.
“Potter,” Draco whimpered. “Potter yes. Please. Fuck me hard. I don’t want to be able to sit down for a week. Please. I need.”
“But you did before?”
He dabbed at his nose in the mirror, and at the corner of his eye which was already beginning to shine. Not that he’d ever tell him, but Malfoy threw a mean punch when he was pissed off. Sure, Harry was bigger, and had muscle mass on his side. But Malfoy was quick, clever, and far more opportunistic that Harry was. That was how Malfoy’s fist had ended up in his face, just before they’d been caught.
Harry groaned and nodded.
“Shall we go a bit bigger? We can go a little bigger every day, till you’re ready for my cock.”
Draco turned and looked down at Harry in amusement.
“Sensitive there?”
Draco laughed and took it out, pushing it straight inside himself, barely wincing.
Draco squealed in his ear.
“Fuck!”
Harry drank his cordial slowly as he waited for Draco to finish eating. Draco was methodical, with table manners Harry could only dream of, dabbing at the corners of his mouth with a napkin he’d found from god knows where in Harry’s kitchen.
“Oh, you play it on the ground though.”
He rested his head against the glass door of the shower and let the water beat down on his back.
“Thank you, Minister. I hope they don’t keep you too long.”
“So are you.”
Harry frowned, trying to work out if Draco was doing anything illegal. He was distracted by Draco’s hands moving to his thighs. He tensed.
“You feel so fucking good,” Draco muttered against his lips. “Gonna come inside your perfect fucking arse, all mine then.”
“Illegal goods,” Harry rolled his eyes. “It could be anything from muggle slaves to an enchanted sofa. You think they could have been a bit more specific.”
“You’re…very welcome to…” Draco managed through the long continuous moan that seemed to be coming from his mouth.
The mouth on his cock was replaced by a large hand, not Potters, pumping him hard.
“You’re welcome. It’ll knock you out cold,” she warned him.
“I guess you have.”
“I think I’ve got a fair idea...” Harry growled.
“Phoenix, pixies, Griffin, and…we think a tiger.”
Draco reluctantly stood up and gave the Ocelot a last mournful look.
“Fuck!” Draco screamed, and, to Harry’s  relief the spell broke and he felt this blissful release wash over his body as he came, shuddering, into Draco’s arse.
“No it’s fine,” Harry said. He had no idea why.
“It doesn’t feel like that when you kiss me.”
Harry laughed, putting his hands on Draco’s shoulders, moving slowly, carefully, gasping, learning. He started to move faster, lifting and letting himself drop down on Draco’s cock, squealing every time he did. Draco lay beneath him, biting his lip, clearly trying not to take back control.
Harry nodded. He did seem to be alive, if drained.
“Thank you, Professor.”
“What the hell are you doing?” she shrieked as he opened the door.
“You hit me too!”
“Why? It’s so early...”
Harry paused for a second then did as he was told, throwing his clothes into a pile on the tent floor. He went to crawl into the warmth of Draco’s sleeping bag but he stopped him.
Draco leant his wait against Harry, pushing him flush against the door. Harry was very aware of the sound of students filling the corridors as they moved between lessons.
“I know.”
“Relax.” Draco laughed in his ear, low and sexy.
“You noticed them staring too?”
Draco laughed.
He swiftly sat opposite to Hermione, his back to the Slytherin table, before his thoughts became too physically obvious. It was quiet at the Gryffindor table, just them, a few first years, and a scattering of students across the other tables. Harry had got bored of staring at his alarm clock at 6am and decided to give in and go to breakfast early. It was the first time he’d seen the Great Hall before 8am.
Another knock at the door. Harry groaned. He was sat on the sofa in his pyjamas, watching a mindless action movie and thinking about ordering a pizza. More giants? He spelled the door unlocked.
“Lower your wand,” the first Death Eater instructed him.
“If you start trying to ‘save me’ and ‘show me the light’ I am ending this right now,” Draco said, realising what Harry was staring at.
“But I got some nice things.”
“He’s lucky he bloody survived it.”
“Thought it might cheer your moody caffeine withdrawal ass up.”
Harry left it. For a change. Draco seemed extremely grateful.
“What’s the point? I’ve told him a million times before and he doesn’t believe me. He must know there’s something going on. He’s not stupid.”
Malfoy shook his head. “I don’t know.”
“Let’s have a look at you then.”
Harry rolled his eyes and threw him a wet cloth.
Draco nodded, trying to resist the need to wrap his legs round Potter’s waist, to get his hips moving against his own.
“I thought about you a lot, down here.”
Hermione came into the room.
“You giving me a lap dance, Potter?”
“Yeah,” Harry admitted. “but how, how does no one recognise you?”
He sighed crawled into the tent for protection. Draco followed shortly after and they sat, almost knees to knees, and eat their sad petrol station dinner.
“I often wondered whether the mark would disappear, you know, when he was finally gone…”
“Like you’re not childish.”
“Do you want to wash my hair for me? You used to be so good at it...”
“No! Obviously it’s no secret I’m trying to defeat Voldemort. I haven’t told him anything else.”
“Relax...”
Harry didn’t miss the shiver this sent through Draco’s body.
Harry woke up at 2pm with a pounding head. He spent the next three hours cursing himself. Had he really made a pass at his assistant? Who happened to be his childhood nemesis? A man. When no one other that Ginny, Hermione and Ron knew about his preferences. He groaned. How could he have been so stupid?
“Of course not. You think powerful wizards walk through here often? Coming through for a mani pedi?” Draco laughed. “People don’t pay enough attention. They don’t care who I am. Which suits me just fine.”
This didn’t help ease Harry’s confusion.
“God you look good dishevelled,” Draco told him. “Get back up here.”
“Jesus Christ.”
Draco turned to putty in his hands, compliant and willing as Harry fucked him slowly, stretching him and enjoying the tight velvet heat inside him.
“She won’t tell anyone.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Trust Draco to be contrary.
“He must be.”
Harry splutters.
“It’s Christmas! It’s allowed!”
“Saint Potter. You never change. The Ministry wouldn’t hear of it, I suppose?”
Harry’s brain seemed to have shut off, he couldn’t accept what had happened, how he felt, or what he was going to try and do next. In the meantime it seemed to be in his best interests to just do whatever Draco wanted.
“I’ll wash up,” Harry immediately volunteered, wanting to get away from Malfoy for a moment. He was fucking with his head just by being close to him.
“Hell fucking yes.” Draco panted as he got his breath back. “You astound me, Potter.”
“No marks, Potter...so you haven’t been getting it elsewhere then? As if you’d let anyone else know your secret...” Draco said, laughing slightly as he came to stand behind him. “What about sex though, have you been getting fucked by any pansies that wouldn’t know which end of the whip to use?”
“Seriously?” he asked Draco.
“Shall I make it wider or longer?”
Draco made a face but gulped it down.
“Oh.” Ron frowned. “What’s the point then?”
“This one.”
“I haven’t!”
He grabbed Draco’s cock with one hand and pushed a single finger inside Draco’s arse hole with the other.
“You weren’t even in the same group! I find you, after the training session beating each other to a pulp. I’ll ask again.” She put her hands on her hips. “What is wrong with you?”
“Fuck off. Besides, everyone know you’ve been doing wandless since you were a kid.”
“None of your heroics, please, you understand me?”
“How did they find that out?”
Harry was still trying to put his mind back the right way up when Draco pulled him over to his lap and rested his head on his shoulder. Harry’s heart flipped. His brain freaked.
“Let me look at you.” Potter ran hand through Draco’s hair almost fondly, then took a fistful and yanked his head back.
“Ashamed. I would imagine.”
“Yep, like I said, childish temper tantrums.”
Draco laughed.
“What state?”
Harry groaned.
Harry tried to not to shake in anticipation. He did not want to be the trembling virgin again. His body had other ideas.
“Yesssss.”
“No, actually, that was Mrs Weasley.”
“That good Potter?”
“Disarmed me? I’m sure I’d recover.”
“Great.”
“And it sounded like the biggest load of bullshit I’d ever heard. I didn’t know what to do with him, Harry...”
Just fucking. Just fucking. Just fucking. He repeated it to himself like mantra every time his brain started saying “but it’s Malfoy” at him for the rest of the day. It didn’t mean anything. They could get it out of their systems, it would run its course, no one would give away their secrets, no harm would come of it. Harry was fairly sure it was his dick doing the talking, with the calm voice that said as long as it got what it wanted, and Malfoy was definitely what it wanted.
Harry nodded.
“I lost the war and I gave up my friends to Voldemort cos I’m a slave to my death eater lover and my aching cock.”
“Who says that?”
He imagined just Malfoy waiting for him, smirking, with those all knowing eyes. I know your secret Potter.
“Sorry. I’ll make it up to you.”
Harry was expecting him to summon him to the room of requirement but suddenly he heard Draco’s voice behind him.
Harry’s cock twitched at the sight of him. He’d thought the obsession couldn’t get worse. He was wrong. Now the sight of Malfoy brought memories of his scent, his touch, his fingernails on his skin. Fuck.
Draco nodded and went first, cautiously creeping up the stone stairs and stepping out into carpeted luxury of the Manor. Harry walked with his back to Draco, checking the corridor for any sign of unwanted company. He swept the corners as they walked into a bigger room. Harry couldn’t quite make it out in the low candlelight. He frowned as Draco began to lead him up some stairs, surely this couldn’t be the way out, but he didn’t want to speak and draw attention to them. He gave Draco the benefit of the doubt and followed him up the staircase and down another narrow corridor. The corridor was better. Less doors to watch. He heard the piano music drifting down the hallway and tensed. Draco didn’t seem concerned, it was loud, he supposed it would cover their footsteps.
“Right.”
Harry groaned, pushing himself to all fours and trying to work out if anything was badly damaged. The stench of the place, mould, rotting food and unwashed humans, hit him harder than the steps.
“Draco?”
“Go get cleaned up and come back to bed.”
Every time he took him higher, quicker and Harry was sure it was getting more intense. When Harry was nearing breaking point Draco stopped and sat back aside Harry’s lap. He leant forward and whispered in Harry’s ear.
Harry clenched his jaw and didn’t rise to the bait. The effort was clearly visible and caused Malfoy to smirk at him. Harry took a deep breath.
“Well...yeah.” Ron shrugged. “I didn’t want to write to mum and dad and make them think we were stupid or something and couldn’t handle it. So I thought I’d wait for you two to get back.”
“Desperate aren’t you?”
“Fuck. Yes. Ah!” Draco squealed as Harry pulled him down hard on his cock. “Do that again.”
Draco rolled onto his back. Harry continued laying face down into the mattress.
Draco squirmed underneath him.
“Yes?”
“Scotland and back,” Harry muttered.
Malfoys hand was heavy on his hip, guiding him round the room and into every step for the next half an hour of the class. He’d been praying Malfoy would insist to switch partners, but he was apparently having far too much fun mocking Harry’s dancing.
Harry smirked and ran his hand up Draco back.
Harry stepped back. He didn’t trust himself in such close proximity to Malfoy. There was something about the way he spoke, smirked, smiled, the way he drawled. The way he fucking stood. God. He was smitten. It was disgusting.
“Do you want me to?”
Malfoy watched the raven haired boy with satisfaction; he knew it had been a good purchase. He saw a lot of Harry usually when they fucked, but not all of him, and now he could stand back and watch him writhe and it was the most beautiful sight...maybe second to Harry screaming, for whatever reasons. Screams of pain and pleasure pleased Draco just the same, something Harry knew all too well.
“Fuck Draco that’s so good.”
“Five years in Azkaban.”
God no. It was much easier to deal with his thoughts about Malfoy when there was no Malfoy there for him to have thoughts about. Repression and denial came much easier to him when the blond was strutting around reducing his mind to nonsense.
“Yeah you said that already. Playing hero not all you though it would be huh?” he dug his thumbs into a particularly tight knot on Harry’s back and Harry groaned.
“How many men have fucked you already tonight, slut?”
“What? I thought you said it was fine.”
“I’m not bloody doing it,” Ron muttered.
“Shut up.”
He closed his eyes as the sound of lunch bell rang in his ears, followed by the cacophonous sound of twenty text books being slammed shut.
They lay panting together for a few minutes.
Draco just sighed. Harry noticed in the bright moonlight how tired Draco looked.
“Probably not,” Harry sighed and went back to his paper work. He found a Christmas party invitation insistently sparkling at him. He’d kept putting it to the bottom of his papers, but it seemed the time was coming where he couldn’t ignore it any longer. It had started spitting glitter at him every time he touched it.
He jumped as he felt Draco’s hand on his waist.
“Yeah I’d noticed. You’re not very subtle.”
Harry held him tighter.
Ron just folded his arms and slumped back in his chair.
Draco turned him round to face him and dropped to his knees.  A grin on his face. Harry groaned at the way it made his stomach flip, his cock harden. He should not be giving a potential death eater this much control over him. He moaned as Draco slid his lips over the head of his cock. He looked up at Harry with wide butter wouldn’t melt eyes and Harry nearly came at the sight. Until he felt that spell wrap round him again. He glared at Malfoy but was secretly glad. Ever encounter could never be long enough, every time he wanted more, he was becoming convinced that one day he and Malfoy would decide to sod the rest of the world, lock the door to the room of requirement and spend the rest of eternity drowning in each other. It was becoming a more appealing idea by the day.
Draco smiled the strangest smile Harry’s ever seen on his face. A kind, polite one. It’s bizarre.
Draco groaned behind him as he ran his hands up Harry’s thighs.
“Not ever? That doesn’t sound so bad, pounding your tight little arse for the rest of my days.”
Potter dropped Draco back down on his feet, sliding his hand down Draco’s pants and grabbing his cock.
“Oh fuck. Fuck Draco that’s good.”
Harry nodded.
Draco didn’t even wince.
Harry swallowed greedily, ignoring the gagging, desperate to please, to take everything Draco gave him. Draco yanked his head back and Harry gasped his breath back, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
“So good. Mmm. Okay. Now fuck me.”
Draco’s eyes were dazed and out of focus as he stared up at him.
Harry didn’t reply, just gave Draco a small smile and slid down into the bath. Draco held his hand out to him and Harry swam over to him, letting Draco pull him in his lap.
He snuck down the corridors, dodging around the students heading down to dinner in their throngs, keeping his head down, trying not to attract attention. One of the many problems of being Harry Potter.
“Good boy.”
“You rarely let me sleep in your bed,” Harry reminded him, though he had no intention of stopping Draco get into bed with him.
“I’m waiting half an hour. If it’s not stopped I’m taking you to the hospital Wing.”
Harry closed his eyes.
“This is Potter. We need back up.” He hissed after the answering machine bleep.
“You sure?” Harry didn’t know why he said it with the reprimand Morgan, and himself, for being so childish fresh in his mind.
“It’s an Ocelot you stupid boy!” the Death Eater broke through the spell and began crawling towards them.
Harry gave a small smile as pouring over the Marauders Map every night finally proved fruitful. Malfoy had been suspiciously well behaved in the evenings that week, returning to the Slytherin common room after dinner and not leaving until breakfast the next morning. Now Harry watched as Malfoy snuck out of his room at 11pm. He thought he’d be headed for the room of requirement and frowned as instead he saw Malfoy’s footsteps trace a path to the bathroom. He couldn’t think of what he could possibly be doing in there in the middle of the night. Maybe he wasn’t the only who chose the unused girl's bathroom as the prime potion brewing place. That would be perfect, if he caught him in the act of brewing the potion. He wouldn’t even have to force the secret out of him. He’d just stun Malfoy, take the potion and the book to Hermione and get her to find the antidote. Sorted.
“Yes,” Draco hissed in his ear. He kissed and nipped at Harry’s neck as Harry did what he thought he was supposed to do. “Ah
“Absolutely.”
Draco wanted a camera. Wanted something to freeze this in time, so every time he had a bad day he could see Harry Potter, with all his toned muscles from Quidditch, with his messed up hair and his bright green eyes sparkling with pleasure, fucking himself on his cock, with what could only be described as wild abandon.
“You are desperate.” Potter undid his cuffs, spun him round and pushed him face forward against the bars.
“Have I ever told you?” Draco said as he threw the last of his clothes on the floor. “That I’m a bit of a clean freak?”
Draco waved his wand and Harry’s clothes were gone apart from his boxers. He put his wand back on the table. He sat astride Harry’s lap and Harry groaned at Draco’s hard cock against his own. He rocked against Draco instinctively and moaned at the sensation.
“What is wrong with you?!” she demanded.
“Yesss… hard Potter, pull me down hard.”
Harry turned and stormed off, straight into one of Draco’s wards. He tripped and fell down the flight of steps face first on the floor, shattering his glasses on the stone bashing his knees and heels of his hands on the
“You look good flushed,” Draco told him, before taking his cock in his mouth and reducing all of Harry’s previous sexual experiences to the awkward fumbles that they really had been.
Draco ran the tip of his cock over Harry’s arsehole. The sensation and the heat took Harry’s breath away and he gasped. He felt light headed.
Harry sighed.
Draco groaned.
“Yeah, of course, I was only joking.”
“Piss off, Potter, I know what fucking Tiger is. It looked like a very large cat.”
“Anything else?” he asked
Malfoy huffed and folded his arms. Harry threw him the wand.
Harry nodded and kept clicking away.
“You don’t want a partner that likes you. You’re sick of people fawning over you and pandering to your every desire.”
Harry shook his head in disbelief.
Harry frowned at the gash on the back of Draco’s scalp.
“That’s enough. Get back on the table.”
Harry didn’t have time to wonder about the spell for long. His head fell back and he signed at the warmth that spread up his legs. Draco spread a light soap over his feet and Harry tried not to yelp.
Harry yelled out, his hips bucking.
Potter gaze didn’t slide away this time. He carried on staring. Holding Draco’s gaze as he picked his way across the room, around the cavorting couples, the cages, the tables. Draco lips worked around the plastic of the gag in his mouth, wondering whether to make a run for it. He knew Potter shouldn’t be able to hurt him in here. The cages were warded, the idea being that subs could only let you in if they wanted to. But this was Potter. He’d defeated the Dark Lord. He could probably destroy the cage with a snap of his fingers. The thought made Draco positively hard.
Harry just wanted to Draco to shut up and go the fuck to sleep.
Draco lay back and pulled Harry down onto his chest.
Harry had blocked the idea from his mind.
“Well,” Lucius said. “You’ve surpassed all my expectations by actually getting out of the dungeon. Did Evans have a stroke? Did you find him collapsed and step over his body?”
“What, you think I should go ask him out?”
“Honestly, Potter, you don’t like me cruel, you don’t like me being nice...how do you want me?” Draco had his hands on his hips and one of Harry’s fluffy white towels wrapped round his waist. His hair was still mostly wet but still managed to look better than Harry’s did even when it was dry. His skin was glowing from the sex, it always did, making him look even more attractive.
Harry nodded and picked it up off the table and took a few hurried gulps. He choked a little and swung his legs round to sit up on the sofa. Draco slapped him on the back.
Harry shook his head.
“You’re a demanding little brat aren’t you.”
“Ron?” he called back over his shoulder at the last minute, thinking he might want to know what he was walking into, but he got no response. He rolled his eyes, presuming they’d probably gone back to their room to “cuddle”. It worried him that his first thought was how - after a month’s trekking and camping around the country side - Hermione had the energy. He quickly shook the thought from his mind and knelt down to open the trapdoor, thinking he might as well find out for himself.
Draco just laughed. “Fine, Potter, I was just trying to be nice.”
“They all sound the same.”
Harry whimpered and arched back against him, desperate for contact.
“Aren’t you sick of seeing enough of me at work?” Draco’s expression was blank. Unreadable. It infuriated Harry beyond belief.
Draco lay on the floor shaking. Harry pulled him up.
Draco popped open the button of his chinos and Harry gulped. He kicked them off and walked back to Harry with a smug grin, he knew how good he looked.
Draco’s wand flew out of his hand a Lucius caught it.
He groaned in spite of himself at the blissfully warmed sheets on the bed.
“Yesss...” Harry sighed. His body was melting. Coming apart in Draco’s hands as he pushed his fingers all the way in. He was sure to disappear through the cracks in the floorboard any second now. Draco’s fingers felt huge, delicious, but huge. Stretching him impossibly wide. He gasped as Draco’s fingers hit something inside, something amazing.
“Found your voice, have you?”
He edged closer to Malfoy, backing him up against the sinks. The Slytherin was reaching behind him for his wand.
Harry’s stomach flipped.
“Oh baby. You poor desperate thing. Just get on your front, Potter, and let me give you what you want.”
Draco grinned at him in triumph and swooped down on his cock, sliding it straight to the back of his throat and swallowing for all he was worth.
It was a woman’s. High pitched.
“Infatuation?”
Hermione gave her squashed cheese sandwich a sceptical look but smiled at Ron all the same.
“Sure I can’t take care of that for you? Auror Potter?”
Harry was speechless. He had no idea what was going on. Draco continued to rub his feet with his deadpan expression. He cleaned and flied his toe nails meticulously, pretending that he didn’t noticed at all that Harry jumped half a foot in the air whenever he touched the soles of his feet.
Draco’s stomach growled.
“He’d better not be dead.”
Draco took a bite of one of the croissants.
“What? Why not?”
Harry picked up the phone and tried to remember how to use it and not look like a twat in front of Draco.
“He hadn’t asked. Honestly Hermione he doesn’t care. Its just sex.”
“Oh god.” She stood with her back to them silently for a few seconds. Harry could imagine the look of horror on her face. He got up and pulled his dressing gown on then threw Draco’s shirt at him.
“No? Come shower with me then?”
He suddenly stepped back and yanked on the rope, pulling him over towards the bed.
“Open.” Draco ran his finger across Harry’s lips and Harry opened.
“Your place or mine?” Draco drawled once they were out of ear shot.
“You wanted me to break him.”
Draco looked like he was trying desperately not to laugh.
“They’re called tigers, Malfoy.”
“Oh Harry. What have I done to you?”
“I thought it was compulsory, Minister.”
“Oh hell.” Harry grabbed at the stone floor with his nails, desperate for something to hold on to. He switched for Draco’s hips, noticing that if he pulled Draco down at a particular angle Draco’s breath hitched. And it felt fucking incredible.
“Move. Draco. Fuck me.
“Yeah, and your still wanting?”
“Dunno. We should probably give him some dinner though.”
Draco just looked bored at Harry’s outburst. He guided Harry back into the water to wet his hair, then took some soap of the side and started massaging it into Harry’s unruly mop. Harry groaned.
“Has no one told you why—”
“Easy, Potter, easy…” Draco soothed him down against the floor. The present shrunk back to its original size and Draco took it, cleaned it, then put it in Harry’s bag.
Malfoy just let out a sigh. “I don’t want to talk to you, Potter, I want to fuck you.”
“I’d have shagged you even if you were covered in shit.”
Of course. It was obvious now. These feelings for Malfoy were completely random , had come out of nowhere and were verging on blind obsession. He cursed himself for being so stupid and not having caught on earlier. Obviously Malfoy had slipped a love potion into his drink. There was no doubt about it now. He remembered the day Ron had accidentally taken one, he was delirious.
Harry and Draco were quite for a moment. The house was still in apparent darkness and silence, but Harry didn’t believe the charade.
Draco cautiously brought his legs round to sit on the edge of the bed.
“But what?”
He knew he should get up and join the fighting that was surely ensuing. He couldn’t move. He wept.
Draco groaned and Harry whispered under his breath, his fingers tingled and became slick.
“Hard.”
“What, would you have had me drink that properly? You know what that does. If it had worked I would have told them that yes I came to save your lives but also I had a particular interest because there was a certain boy I wanted to fuck?”
