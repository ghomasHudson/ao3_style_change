“It’s good to be back after all,” Potter had said after Draco stuttered his name upon discovering his identity. “For the record, I like your arse, too, Malfoy” he added with a playful wink.
Harry broods alone in their hotel room, with an old radio and the sound of the shower running as his only companions, and thinks how, once again, his innate desire to follow his gut rather than any rules of gods or men is awoken from its deep slumber by Draco Malfoy and his uncanny ability to drive Harry insane. He worries that before these eight weeks are out, something big will happen—and this time, it won’t be mobsters or hitmen pushing them together to the same side. This time, they may go willingly, and that scares the shit out of him.
He Glamours his Auror uniform into something less conspicuous, just a regular dark red jacket, and turns around to look for Malfoy. His impromptu charge emerges from behind a tree where the Portkey has thrown him, and stomps over to Harry, his pointy face a picture of fury.
That night, Harry had wanked himself raw and hadn’t stopped thinking about Draco’s wings ever since.
The tarnished culprit had caught Draco unaware; he thought it was one of his mother’s, left behind in her rush to retire to Saint-Raphaël after his father’s death, and he had opened it only to find it empty. He was examining the red fabric lining when the box spewed a puff of pink smoke right into his face, thankfully only sending him into a coughing fit rather than an early grave.
“I need to get to the Aurors’ office,” Harry finally says, some semblance of a plan beginning to crystallise. In moments like this, he misses Ron—his strategic thinking, the logic of a seasoned chess player that perfectly complements Harry’s rather wild and particular kind of brute force. It’s what makes them good partners—more of a ying-yang sort of balance, rather than brains and brawn—and at this moment, Harry really needs a dash of logic in the eerily empty Atrium.
Harry started noticing the changes about a month after the incident. At first glance, nothing about Draco seemed different, not to an acquaintance or a coworker. To Harry, though, it was torture, a distraction, and a big, big problem, all personified in Draco’s new self. Draco got…
Something clenches in his throat—saying so himself felt correct five minutes ago, so why does he feel like a traitor?
—among Muggles. If he has ever had the chance to just walk around a small English town without a purpose or a shady mission to carry out, without magic, without any obligations or threats. He can see that curious gaze linger as they pass the tiny shops, examining every oddity he spots. He can even see Malfoy’s mouth open for a short second when they pass a tiny bakery, and even Harry has to admit that the smell of pastries is nothing short of heavenly. It reminds him to make use of the credit cards he has and Malfoy watches with fascination as Harry buys a few sandwiches and a four-pack of ale at the nearest shop after looking at Malfoy in question and receiving a curt nod.
It’s incredible, and impossible, and ineffable, how everything goes full circle—breaking turns into mending, sneers turn into soft moans and
Malfoy’s been miffed all day for no discernible reason, barking and huffing at Harry who, frankly, didn’t bother to bite his tongue either. It’s getting to them—the constant proximity, the stolen glances and old grudges, their constant rivalry and the inexplicably slow passage of time, dragging them against the grain. The place they’re staying at isn’t an especially cheerful one, either; with its damp drapes and murky walls it feels like a floral-patterned dungeon.
For a few moments, the only sounds in the bathroom were the muffled beats of the music in the pub, the crude slaps of thigh on thigh, and their shared gasps, a rhythmic stream of
“Seriously?” She asks incredulously. “You have so much in common, he’s a good guy!” Next to her, Luna nods with a serious expression.
Ginny scoffs. “Look, I don’t know what men look for in men, in case you didn’t notice,” she says testily and pauses. “I haven’t seen his cock which, thank Merlin for that—”
When Harry moves to the other rib, he’s certain Malfoy’s about to cut off the blood circulation in his left hand and he can hear a soft whimper as soon as he mutters the incantation.
,” Draco murmurs privately, his words brushing softly right against Harry’s temple at the awkward angle. He tries not to shudder at the pleasant warmth and absently notices that Draco’s breath smells really nice, and not at all like hyacinths, not even close. It’s somehow chocolate-y and Harry darts an unhappy look at his beer and then at Draco’s wine, regretting his beverage choices. Maybe Draco would let him have a taste.
Draco’s shirt catches on his elbow as Harry tries to yank it off him—he needs more, more skin, more of that sweet, milky warmth and finally, he waves his hand in frustration and both their clothes Vanish. Draco’s moan rips out of him, a throaty, violent sound that makes Harry’s cock swell between their stomachs, sliding on skin that’s already damp with their mingled sweat.
“Draco,” his voice was now thick, with emotion, with a dangerous kind of anticipation, with the realisation  that somewhere between Draco taking off his shirt and being betrayed by his own body, something had fundamentally shifted between them.
meant), and filling in for Robards whenever he was absent. All in all, it didn’t seem like something people would absolutely have to barge into his office for, let alone stay there for longer than a few minutes. In reality, the queue seemed neverending at times: signing warrants, receiving reports, scheduling trainee debriefs, the list went on. The first time it happened, Harry was caught playing mini-Quidditch on his desk, using crumpled paper he’d Charmed to act as balls and bent paper clips as poles; Ron let himself in and stopped in his tracks only for a second before casting a Colloportus on the door and joining Harry in the semi-finals.
“Do you think we’re being… stupid?” Harry finally asks, the conversation Draco had with Zabini all those weeks ago pushing itself to the forefront of his mind.
That night, after Potter had left, Draco forwent waiting a polite amount of time before going straight to his bedroom. Halfway up the stairs, he was already palming at the front of his trousers, hissing at the pressure after being forced to go half-hard for most of the day. As soon as the door closed behind him, Draco, without the usual finesse, Vanished his clothes, threw his wand onto the dresser, and climbed atop his bed.
They paused, face to face, not close enough, with a still-respectable distance between their zippers, with Harry’s hand carefully perched somewhere between Draco’s knee and his upper thigh. Waiting for the next direction, permission, anything Draco was willing to give. It was all hypothetical after all and Harry could hypothetically help Draco get back at McLaggen doing hypothetically nice things to him, maybe even getting some of those things in return. Nothing was yet real, everything was permitted in the realm of supposition.
“Come here, mate!” Harry exclaims and jumps on top of Ron, laughing at his friend’s shrieks and cries for help.
, he really needs to convert Draco to something less flashy, maybe some wildlife programme or just the weather.
Teddy’s warm and pliant under his touch, and he takes it so beautifully, sobbing quietly into the crook of Draco’s neck as Draco thrusts up into him, wet, sloppy, and completely perfect. He can hear Harry in the back, the slow slapping sounds of him getting himself hard again with a perfect view right behind Teddy. Draco digs his fingers into the soft-smooth flesh of Teddy’s arse and picks up speed, grunting, and gasping, getting closer with each thrust.
“I mean… He’s not a killer, that’s for sure,” he admits, albeit reluctantly. And then, nothing happens, he doesn’t feel any different after saying it out loud though and deep down Harry knows it’s the truth. He remembers Malfoy’s face in sixth year, at the top of the Astronomy Tower—the taut angles of his shoulders and the absolute mortification marring his face. He remembers porcelain-white, bloodstained fingers when they met in the Manor in seventh year. Draco Malfoy is a lot of things but a murderer is not one of them.
“Yes, I can, and I will, so kindly shut up while I save your life,” Harry barks. “Come on, I have to get you out of here, the mafia is everywhere and they’re already looking for you.”
. In other words, I recruited fresh meat which, I’ll have you know, is a downright barbaric way to describe my art.”
kind, do keep up, Auror Potter!” Draco says with a laugh. “Let’s say that every time you want something from me, I get to ask you a question.”
There was another time when the Cooling Charms in the whole Ministry malfunctioned in the middle of summer, right on the day Harry needed to catch up on the piles of paperwork he let sit on his desk for far too long. Ginny found him wearing nothing but a pair of crimson boxers with fluttering golden snitches, sitting on his desk, sweaty and miserable. She laughed so hard Harry considered Obliviating her for a second, right after she jokingly stated she was now a hundred per cent sure she was gay.
Draco flips them over in lieu of answering, and looks down at Harry with an unreadable expression, absently tracing Harry’s bicep with his finger.
and Draco wanted to layer his lungs with it. It was the thought of fucking Potter in that blasted chair, now more of a possibility than a feeble fantasy, that brought Draco over the edge; his back arched and taut, Draco rode out his orgasm in shivery waves, spilling all over his hand and stomach.
He can hear the clink of a belt buckle and realizes Draco is unbuttoning his jeans for him, watching Harry with wide-eyed devotion and Harry gasps, cants his hips forward, his cock straining against the material, begging to be touched. Draco keeps kissing him as he opens the zipper and Harry moans into his mouth feeling the erection in his pants bob free. A gust of cool air washes over the damp spot of precome at the front and Harry groans and shivers, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, biting down at the first patch of skin he can get his mouth on. Draco’s panting next to his ear and it’s intoxicating to see how turned on he is, how he’s shaking just from the act of undressing him. Harry absently thinks he might go insane if Draco doesn’t touch him soon, and it’s probably their combined arousal rather than any telepathic bond, but his mind goes completely blank when Draco finally touches his cock through his pants, slim fingers wrapping around the throbbing hardness.
Draco lets out a sultry laugh. “Have you ever fired anyone?” he asks abruptly. “I doubt the Minister or the Head Auror busy themselves with the lives of their little pawns so I’m assuming their right-hand men get to do the fun bits, correct?”
Finally, Harry pulls his fingers out and lightly smacks Draco’s arse for the impatient groan he lets out. He Summons more lube and spreads it all over his cock, hissing at the lightest touch. Draco’s running hot like a bellowing furnace, drenched in sweat, flushed, and completely stunning as he bites his lip when Harry presses the head of his cock against his entrance.
They reach the interrogation rooms across the hall of the holding cells in the western wing. A quick look at the enchanted board says all of them are empty save for one—probably some poor sod caught publicly drunk, or some petty thief who tried to nick a few potions on Diagon. If it were someone who’s big news, Harry and Ron would have known, usually getting the lead on more serious cases—any one of them could have ties to the Family these days and the Minister has personally ensured his top Aurors are well-informed at all times.
Harry listens, imagining Draco mingling with Russian high-society, taking to their exuberant gladhanding like a fish to water, melting their defences with his effortless, lazy elegance and coy charms. His presence must have been quite a treat—a pale, frozen beauty with delicate features, more than willing to warm their beds on those long, freezing nights. Harry remembers their fourth year at school and the way some of the Durmstrang boys looked at Malfoy, their eyes lingering just a second too long, the tight knot of their thick eyebrows loosening up as they regarded him at the Slytherin table. Tall, slim blonds seemed to be their catnip no matter the gender and Harry can’t really blame them, seeing his own strange reactions to Malfoy lately.
Bodies had started to pile up and the Ministry was in a shambles. The wizarding world had fallen into a dormant state of relative peace—a long, well-deserved breath of fresh air everybody desperately needed after the metaphorical salt-and-burn over Voldemort’s grave. In a time of grieving, licking wounds and coming to terms with the tremendous amount of loss that had left a hollow space in so many hearts, Harry was left watching the ashes settle and trying to hold on to a reality he had never prepared to live in. It was a horrible thing to even think but when the French authorities had alerted the DMLE of a possible crime syndicate rooted under their very noses, Harry felt every muscle in his body rewire to the default state he knew so well how to handle.
Kingsley shoots him a knowing look. “I know you two have history,” he says and Harry feels that the way he put no emphasis on the last word was deliberate.
“Shut up,” Harry says in a low voice, closing his eyes and counting to ten. “If you’ll keep talking for the next twenty-four hours, I swear to Merlin—”
specials, patting themselves on the back for taking a grainy photo of Harry Potter leaving a pub with a little less-than-sober gait and in a definitely less-than-sober state. Little did they know, the truly juicy details were usually far beyond their grasp, cautiously obscured with the invaluable help of more than a few charms and, obviously, Harry himself keeping his mouth shut.
Ron closes his mouth, eyeing both men with curiosity. Harry, in all honesty, shares the sentiment—if he didn’t know any better, he’d say it’s probably another incognito reporter or an overzealous fan with too much time on their hands and a solid Glamour to top it off. Any arrogance aside, people still manage to surprise him when it comes to devising ways to get five minutes alone with the Boy Who Lived, so much so the DMLE has had to adapt its headquarters by placing Glamour detectors by the entrance and running random Polyjuice tests to prevent the public from infesting Level Two in its entirety.
,” he says, grimacing at the roll of hotel-grade toilet paper next to him. “How does it feel, to stoop so low as to mock me?”
Malfoy is looking at him with wild eyes, his whole body shaking with rage, his wet fringe obscuring half of his face. He makes a move as if to run, and then retreats, flouncing about in growing horror, and Harry desperately tries to calm his nerves and come up with a plan in the small time frame they have. He pulls out his wand, holding it tightly, and Malfoy pauses.
Draco flashes her a mischievous smile. “And you’ll surely be delighted to hear I’m staying for good,” he purrs and looks at Harry. “Never expected to be caught
They can see their faceless coworker come around the corner through the glossy veil of the Cloak and Potter’s mouth falls open in a slight smile as he smears saliva all over Draco’s kiss-swollen lips. Draco, still trying to control his breathing, chases the touch with his tongue as Potter traces the shape of his mouth with filthy-wet fingers.
Draco kissed him again, pettily, still holding on to the bubble of the revenge scenario and Harry played along for now because while he wasn’t exactly patient, Draco was careful and conflicting in a way that reminded Harry of a scared cat.
“So this,” he says groggily, exhaustion slowly settling into his bones. It’s reckless and scary, and a hundred other things but Harry still brushes a single finger over the soft fabric of Draco’s trousers. Back. Forth. And stop. “What’s this about.”
Harry bats away the strange thoughts, filing them for later examination. “Yes, that’s the problem. Don’t you have anywhere else to be?”
Draco smiles as he hooks his fingers into the waistband of Harry’s boxers. “She managed to give me a chance,” he says, kissing Harry’s collarbone. “Bind me”—another kiss, going lower—“and threaten me,” he says, biting Harry’s nipple. “All in one sentence.”
Potter kisses him, one, two, three times, wetting their lips, revelling in the wet slide, and the scratch of beard on stubble. “It’ll be quick,” he whispers.
Hermione keeps muttering under her breath as she swipes through the spacious room like a very neat, competent tornado—every pillow she turns over goes back to its place, every drawer she opens gets immediately closed; she even folds the blanket back on the sofa with an efficiency that would make Molly Weasley herself take out a notepad.
“Would you have gotten something to eat otherwise?” Draco asks, expertly swirling a neat portion of pasta on his fork.
He plucks up the courage to look into the stormy grey eyes; Draco’s face is open like a book, emotions on display for Harry to read and he’s flooded with relief. Relief that Draco still stands by the words he said when Harry first brought it up, relief that they were able to move past it, that Draco is still eager to call him his friend after Harry almost murdered him in a murky bathroom. That Draco always rushes to reassure him, ready to repeat it a thousand times if needed—it’s something they have in common, two boys carrying a burden of guilt, lifting the other up when needed, making sure the other is okay.
, it was my ability to make their imaginations run wild and keep them on their toes, always so eager and… hungry,” he speaks lowly, his long fingers toying with the now empty bottle. “It’s not about what’s
“That was fast,” Draco points out, switching the telly off and settling against the pillows. Harry sits down close, their shoulders bumping, and feels he can finally take a well-deserved breather.
Harry shakes his head. “I know we can’t.” He lifts the vial. “Grab on to this, it’s a Portkey. Come on!”
“Lust Potion.” Draco swallowed thickly. “So. Is it working? Do you feel a sudden and urgent need to have your way with me on this couch?” He asked, unable to stop himself, and even managing a slight smile.
Each time Draco finds something special, his enthusiasm is so contagious Harry drops everything to join him on the couch and listen as Draco talks about the gravity or peculiarity of his find of the day. Harry is always happy to listen, to watch Draco gesture animatedly as he tells him old Black family histories his mother used to tell him. Sometimes, Harry watches Draco’s hands, how carefully they hold the books as if they were precious heirlooms (they actually were, more often than not, if only because of their age). Draco has very long, slender fingers and Harry sometimes thinks his hands were made to handle delicate objects—thin glass vials, antique leather books, the finest quills, and champagne glasses. One time, Draco caught Harry staring down and there was a little crease between his eyebrows as he quieted down and stopped gesturing, and Harry immediately felt bad because he already knew that meant Draco was unsure if he was boring Harry or not. If he was ‘too much’, as he once said so himself. Harry couldn’t very well tell Draco he was staring at his hands but since then, he always made sure Draco knew he listened; sometimes, he would let Draco plop his feet in his lap, in a casual, reassuring gesture, and play with the hems of his tailored trousers while Draco’s smooth, low voice engulfed them both in a calm bubble. And sometimes, Harry would sit on the floor, between the couch and the coffee table where their book of the day was placed, and maybe lean on Draco’s legs, with his head against Draco’s knee as they talked.
“I need you to understand, Harry,” Draco says, and it doesn’t escape Harry how he hasn’t used his last name once since he came. “I probably would have come back even if you hated me, albeit with quite a bit more dejection. So…”
Ginny turns ashen. “She says that? About my dad? No, wait,” she raises a hand, shuddering. “I don’t want to know. Harry,” she turns her attention back to him, clearly distraught with the mental image of her parents getting in on. Serves her right. “So I’m assuming his age would be a problem?”
He collapses on top of Draco and Draco, surprisingly, doesn’t mind the warm, solid weight, and even his own come dribbling out of Harry’s arse and down his softening cock still sheathed inside him. Potter smells like sex and sweat and Draco swears to never come near a bottle of Amortentia, surmising it shall be a special case where ignorance is, indeed, bliss.
“Hnnng—fuck,” Draco whimpers, trying to pull him up for a kiss and Harry goes willingly. “Yeah, god, yes, feels so good—” he pants out between kisses, sucking Harry’s tongue into his mouth.
about bloody Malfoy, about his shiny hair, long legs and tight little arse. Malfoy, who never seemed intimidated by him and always made it crystal clear Harry was a nuisance and absolutely Not Special, no matter what anyone in the entire Ministry had to say about it. It drove him crazy and Harry sometimes thought it was the masochist in him finding it hopelessly attractive, how Draco found him as unimpressive as a fly on the wall of his immaculate office and yet never tried to swat him away.
“I didn’t think much of it but then, I remembered Kingsley telling him something once—something like, ‘
you,” he says slowly, punctuating every syllable. “And no-one else.” He looks at Harry with an almost amused expression.
The ‘emergency kit’, as the Minister put it, was more of an Order of the Phoenix thing than any kind of Auror standard. During the post-war trials, Harry and his closest circle watched with trepidation as more and more Death Eaters went free, with some of the Wizengamot members straight-up refusing to take Harry’s account of the events into consideration. That, in turn, prompted them to think the unthinkable—the Wizengamot could have been infiltrated. With tensions running high and so many criminals on the run the Aurors struggled to keep up with locking them up, the Order members had to be prepared for the worst. If there was a possibility of a revolt in the Ministry, they would have had to go under the radar for a while—an old habit of being always vigilant, one Alastor Moody had imprinted into the Order with an iron fist, has resulted in Harry keeping his old, trusty Mokeskin pouch in a locked drawer in his desk, with the essentials hidden inside. Just enough to survive, become invisible and, most importantly, safe. It’s been ten years but old habits die hard and the mere knowledge of it being there within his reach, has brought Harry an unusual sense of security throughout the years.
“You know how I hate to ruin a good moment,” Draco purrs, pulling at his lower lip playfully. “But, alas. Potter, you have to get me out of here,
For now, he lets it go. “All right, so we can’t Apparate. We’re going to need to move the Muggle way.”
That brings Draco to four. Four times, Potter suggested they could grab some dinner and four times Draco played it down as teasing and distracted the man with assets other than food (although not impartial to some form of eating). In his vehement crusade against any form of emotion deeper than where his cock can reach, Draco had once made Potter come three times in one night; the image of him completely incoherent with pleasure now forever etched into Draco’s mind. He wanted to believe Potter really meant it, but the amount of couple-y things they’d been doing was already mind-boggling enough without the addition of dinner dates and staring at Potter’s smile for extended amounts of time.
Draco frowns, looking around as he takes off his jacket and Harry gets momentarily distracted by his arms but quickly goes back to examining the bar. Just as he initially thought, all the people scattered around the bar are men of varying ages. And then Harry’s attention is drawn to a small, narrow rainbow banner hanging off one of the shelves behind the bar.
actually do Healing, just… wandless. And, to Harry’s utter astonishment, once he had learned how to channel his magic and connect it to the source of an injury, it felt brilliant to be able to do. According to Hermione, it’s an old, primal branch of magic, used back before wands were even invented, and still practised in some parts of the world. Channelling the magic flesh-to-flesh is supposed to ease the transition, and some old books vaguely hint at Core Magic and eye contact playing a part. Harry doesn’t really care about the technicalities as long as it does its job in keeping him out of Mungo’s for as long as possible.
Draco’s stalling; he chases Harry’s mouth and tongues at its seam until Harry lets him in. He tastes like caramel and it’s really hard to let him go, but Harry breaks the kiss and places his thumb between their lips. “Draco.”
Harry stands up and Summons a change of clothes, looking for his toothbrush. “And you never wanted to do anything about it?” he asks, rummaging in his pouch.
Draco seems to be reading his mind—he still manages to flip Harry two fingers while in the middle of a coughing fit and gesture wildly to himself until Harry caves. He Summons a glass, fills it with a muttered Aguamenti and passes it to Draco.
“Our results were inconclusive and I don’t know if the team the research was handed over to made any progress,” Draco says, resigned.
“A year, huh?” Harry murmured, inhaling the sweet honey-patchouli scent Draco always seemed to emanate. The telly was turned down to a low, buzzing background noise and Harry could hear Draco’s calm breathing and the soft, pleased purr he let out at his gentle ministrations. He slipped his hand under Draco’s tee and palmed at the place where his heart beat steadily against his ribcage.
“You really worked with them,” Harry breathes, eyes skimming over the parchments. “And—you sat on all this—for how long?” Harry can’t stop staring at the lists of names, at all the evidence it would take the DMLE
“Oh,” Draco breathed out quietly, right against Harry’s temple. “You twisted thing,” he murmured, dipping down for a deep kiss. “You genius deviant, Potter, you—” Draco praised, touching Harry’s neck and chest, following it with lips and tongue as Harry laughed weakly and ran his fingers through Draco’s hair.
“I— I like to feel it. So your lips get all,” Draco said and his hand travelled up Harry’s shoulder and into his hair. Fingers tightened between dark locks, sending a dash of heat down Harry’s neck. “I would ask you to go harder.”
He hiked up Harry’s leg over his shoulder and Harry cried out as the angle changed, digging his fingers into the soaked sheets. Now that he had access, Draco’s hands massaged along Harry’s legs, rubbing soothing circles into the overheated skin, a stark contrast against the unrelenting thrusts of his hips. He turned his head, kissing and licking over Harry’s foot and ankle, brushing his lips at the side of the arch, and went lower, nosing at the coarse hairs on Harry’s calf. Harry had never considered his legs or feet to be erogenous zones but holy fuck, it felt so good, so sensual, the smallest touch set his body further aflame.
“Why did you need me here?” The question hangs in the air and Harry isn’t sure anymore, only knows that Draco made this disappointing night better by just showing up. It feels too big to say for some reason, like Draco would maybe laugh at him or ask him to elaborate and Harry has no answer to that, not yet.
“You’d be surprised,” Harry says with a smirk, forever unable to forget his first meeting with the Sorting Hat.
They’re kissing again and Harry feels as if Draco is telling him everything he needs to hear with just his hands, his lips and tongue, with the way he holds him. He doesn’t need any answers, he already knows everything there is to know—they’ve let each other in completely, in ways Harry never thought he would be able to—he’d given Draco his heart a long time ago. Right now, he has also bared his soul, for his lover to cradle in cupped hands and hold it to his chest when it’s too much, when it’s too big and slipping through the cracks, when it threatens to break him from the inside. The only thing left that Harry wants to do, is to share his body with Draco—and he couldn’t imagine it any other way.
“Leave the boots,” he said, and paused as soon as Harry looked up at him with a raised eyebrow. “Unless—” Draco shook his head. “Perish the thought,” he said and smiled, cradling Harry’s jaw in his palm. “I want you bare.”
When they had finally worn each other out, Potter told Draco nice things, like how gorgeous he was, and how he’d maybe wanted them to do that for some time. How it might’ve resolved their animosity sooner rather than later. It was as shocking as the fact Potter was a cuddler, and an enthusiastic one at that.
, they had said. Hermione, with a heavy, knowing sigh that should have been infuriating rather than comforting. Ron, with a little more of the acrimony Harry had felt settling into his muscles. One hand washes the other, cheques and deeds slid over polished mahogany, champagne bottles opened with a hefty pop as estates that had been seized were released to their rightful heirs one after the other.
,” Harry whispered into Draco's mouth, his tone almost scandalized but quickly betrayed by a small shiver somewhere around his hips.
“I… Well,” Draco stutters, clearly caught off guard, and it is indeed a glorious sight—a mobster turned traitor, with a gun under his jacket and a Dark Mark burned into his skin, rendered speechless by a seven-year-old. “Thank you, I suppose. You’re not entirely awful yourself, child,” he says haughtily, his Glamoured face taking on the faintest pink tinge.
? What the fuck were you thinking? What do you think they can do about that, we have no power over there, you bloody—”
Harry tangles his fingers in the white-blond hair and hears Draco moan as he grabs it and then pushes Draco’s face and that sinful, brilliant tongue just exactly where he wants it, where he
In the end, he has to cast three more times until the Diagnostic Charm doesn’t find any signs of lingering fracture. Healing complete, Harry curses the two brutes to the fiery pits of hell for making a sport out of beating virtually defenceless people bloody. He briefly wonders if Malfoy considered using his gun at the time but stifles the thought—it’s neither important nor relevant, and untangling Malfoy’s veiled motivations can only result in a headache and a deep-seated need to knock back a tumbler of whiskey.
Malfoy throws his arms up in frustration. “Well, how was I to know you’d Portkey me out of the Ministry into the middle of nowhere?!” He gathers himself and adds: “Could’ve just said so if you wanted me alone.”
Hermione’s eyes go wide and she elbows her fiancé in the solar plexus, hard enough to get out a muffled grunt. “That is
life, which would probably be, I don’t know, two months? From the looks of things?” Harry finishes and just knows he might look a little deranged.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry manages to choke out, twisting and straining under his hands. “Please. Fuck, please, yes,
Ron and Hermione watch Harry scramble for words in silent indignance until Hermione takes pity on him.
. It wasn’t Narcissa—it was never meant to be Narcissa, it was Robards’ wife. The Family wanted the DMLE to know they had found her in France so they had leverage, not over Draco, but over Robards. Which means…
That out-of-character statement startles a delighted laugh from Harry and Draco flushes a deep red. It only makes Harry laugh harder, toppling over and grabbing Draco’s knee to balance himself.
“I’m serious,” he huffed and scooted a little closer. “Do you think—” he trailed off, turning his head to look at Harry.
“You’re not a Healer and yet you give a diagnosis,” Malfoy says dramatically, his shirt parting a little as he relaxes into the bed. He smirks. “Just admit you want to take a closer look at my devastating body,” he purrs, propping himself up on his arms and letting the shirt fall open.
“So what’s that about me being hot?” Draco asks playfully, his fingers toying with the buttons on his robes.
They go to a fancy French restaurant and Harry wishes he knew something about the place before he got there—he immediately feels underdressed and out of place, and when Daniel arrives, he only says Harry looks nice and Harry smiles weakly and wishes they had gone somewhere else.
, each thrust punching the breath out of them. Harry held Draco by one hip, his other hand wrapped around him, across his shoulders, nose buried in the warm dip of Draco’s neck.
Harry notices Malfoy's face twist into a sneer a second too late to react before his wand flies out of his hand, stolen by magic, only to land several feet away in the sand. There’s another incantation, muttered with a violent hiss, and then, all Harry can feel is blinding pain in his wielding arm, it throws him to the ground and Harry can see the mobster he’s just bested, with half of his face covered in ugly burns, slowly move in on him. Harry wants to counteract but he can’t feel the wand in his hand, not with the pain quickly spreading along his arm, and the man appears to be the gloating kind, regarding him with a loathsome grin as he keeps himself upright on wobbly legs.
him to see those parts now. Even though Draco’s the one in his custody, it’s Draco who’s been holding a proverbial gun to Harry’s head until now, lowering it more and more, and the moments he forgets about his walls being down, he’s at his most beautiful.
“What?” Harry interrupts, panic already clutching at his lungs. “No, I need to stay here, the Family—”
It was getting dark and the old black and white TV babbled on, basking them in silvery light as joyful, well-dressed Muggles advertised their products in the same grating, high-pitched voices. At times, it drove Harry mad but Draco loved the damn contraption, still mesmerised by the moving pictures and the stories told in the movies. The pictures ended happily most of the time and Harry could see the appeal they carried—his heart always broke a little at the sight of Draco’s face devoid of all worry as he escaped into the world behind the shiny glass. One of these days, he would get a Muggle car, Harry thought, and take Draco to the drive-in cinema they had in the next town over. Soon. When all the rumours died down, when everything would be a little less frantic. He would even learn how to properly drive the bloody thing, just to see his lover happy, to see his reaction to the grand screen, and to kiss him breathless in the backseat under the thick blanket of the night.
answer?” Hermione asks, drawing air quotes around the ‘fun’ bit, her wine sloshing dangerously in her glass.
She looks at Harry with her signature scrutiny, studying him like a book; and while Harry feels a bit exposed, he reckons there’s no use in hiding why exactly he’s here, or why he’s reacting so viscerally to the possibility of Draco not making it.
“I just wanted company?” He tries, annoyed at the telling warmth at the tips of his ears. It’s not like it should be something embarrassing.
“Fuck, Harry—” he breathes, not entirely present, his eyes unfocused with arousal. “Oh my— Fuck, get
“I’ll pay triple if you never mention it again,” Weasley croaks, dabbing napkins at the front of his shirt as the group erupts in laughter.
Draco raises an amused brow. “I don’t know, should you? Or should I prepare that solution myself tomorrow? Or should you come back in a week? Take a holiday? I’m sure that our trauma victim can wait for their potion, it’s not—”
Draco looked to the ceiling, and then at Harry again, clearly displeased he had to actually spell it out. “As you may know, winged creatures maintain a certain degree of…
It strikes a chord with Harry and he’s slightly surprised he can relate to Malfoy in regards to what might be his deepest fear. It’s an ache that has sat under his skin for years, never really gone, only reminding him it’s there from time to time, like a bad knee when it’s about to rain. It’s a very particular kind of despair, to want to be wanted. To have nothing to offer and still be cradled close to someone’s chest like something sacred. To have a purpose without having to scratch his fingers bloody in an attempt to keep it.
,” he says, looking at Harry with an intensity that makes his heart stutter. “People disappear and are never found. Gold gets passed around and suddenly, you’re arrested for a dead body you’ve never seen in your life. Are you following?”
“Potter, you have to understand it’s not the question of liking or disliking,” he says slowly, shaking his head. “It’s a matter of life and death. As long as I’m useful, I live. See, even right now.” He gestures around them. “I have useful information so they get Harry Potter, the Saviour himself, to be my big, strong bodyguard. If this ends well, and, don’t take it personally, I think the odds are not currently in my favour, I’ll find something else to be good for.”
Their collective moan cuts through the air as Harry slowly pushes inside Teddy, inch by inch. Draco holds his cheeks open, his fingers sure to leave bruises as they adjust to the pressure, the tightness, the indescribable feeling of
—” He babbled and then froze, string-taut and drenched in sweat, and came, shooting all over his chest and Draco’s fist. It only took seeing Harry helplessly shake in the seat, his hole clenching tight around his cock, and Draco was coming too, letting out a loud moan into Harry’s open mouth.
He can tell Draco wants to say something, maybe that he likes what he’s seeing, maybe wants to learn it, too. It makes Harry’s palms sweat. He wonders what Draco would say if he ever knew about the Concealing Charms. About his tattoos.
that are to be sold, exhibited, or distributed, and that have not changed their owner, in the sense of multiple members of a single bloodline, for at least four generations are to be subject to the Standardised Magical Artefact Security Tests. (…)”
and he calls everyone ‘dada’ so forgive me for thinking she might not take his word for it!” He grinds out, switching Fred to his other arm.
“I was made an offer,” he barks. “One I couldn’t refuse. And there were some additional perks, too.”
Harry looked up at him, almost shyly, and softly pressed their lips together, not really kissing, just a steady, warm touch. “Don’t move on,” he said, a little abruptly.
The preamble to their carefully planned evening is awfully anticlimactic—Harry opens the whiskey and they casually sip on it from a couple of tea mugs they find in the room, not talking much while they get ready to leave. Harry squints as the first sip of alcohol hits his throat and savours the lingering burn in his stomach that slowly spreads out to his limbs. For the first time in weeks, he can feel most of the tension that’s been holding him by the skin on his neck dissipate into something a little more bearable, something familiar enough to be fine to handle for the rest of the night. Harry’s careful not to go overboard—liquor makes him loose at the seams, and somewhat soft, which can lead to him saying or—Merling forbid—
Harry’s pulse spikes at that. Coming to terms with the fact that the man he had considered his mentor for half of his life was not as perfect as Harry was comfortable believing was one of the hardest things he ever had to do. Malfoy doesn’t know what Harry knows, Malfoy didn’t find out his clock was up at seventeen, he didn’t have to go out and
A ragged breath broke the silence and the pit of guilt in Harry’s stomach started to fill with something else entirely. He heard Draco exhale again and it was nearly a gasp, a repressed thing that tore out of him on instinct, and Harry watched the quivering wings as his pulse slowly sped up.
Harry lets out a heavy sigh. “Draco, I have to follow the procedure, and this way, no-one will be able to get to you, if things—” He trails off, unwilling to consider the option of things going south. “I’ll come back. There’s still a price on your head and this will keep you
“It’s similar to a Slashing Curse but it has a… toxicity component, so to speak,” Draco explains. “It’s supposed to keep the wound from healing up naturally, to exhaust your opponent,” he says, picking up one of the bottles. He then mixes in a few drops from an amber bottle Harry can’t recall the label of. “This will be unpleasant,” he warns, corking the vial and giving it a shake.
He doesn’t know how long they stay on the roof. It feels strangely anticlimactic, to have a heart-to-heart with his supposed enemy under an array of stars dashed across the inky sky, talking about seducing mobsters, cocaine, and Quidditch, of all things. There’s a tiny, sedulously folded away part of Harry that wants to believe Malfoy—it’s the part that watched a sixteen-year-old boy unable to kill an old man. The part that still lives because that same boy once refused to point his finger at Harry and say
“And nothing after… that?” Harry doesn’t know why he’s asking, why he’s so curious about Draco’s private life, or about the people he’s been with. He thinks about the last few years, about the future ahead of them and can’t really bring himself to picture Draco getting married, or even dating some faceless, imaginary man. It unsettles Harry in a very strange way, makes something ugly roll in his stomach and for a second, he feels like the shittiest friend in the world—that emotion he can’t quite name shouldn’t be there, prodding against his ribcage like a thorn, poisoning and tainting his conscience.
“Hey,” he murmurs. Slowly, carefully, he plucks the stirring rod from Draco’s fingers and places it on the table, and turns him around.
Harry freezes, his heart battering against his ribs, the weight of the decision he has to make dawning on him like an anvil to the face. “What—”
“Well!” Ron pipes in, terribly displeased with his barmy theories going unacknowledged. “You’re not that touchy with Hermione! Or— or me!”
Suddenly, Luna gasps in wonder “Oh, he must really resemble Draco! Is that why you picked him, Ginny?”
Free to run their own operation after their deranged master’s fall from grace into a literal grave, those who were still wealthy enough after paying all the war reparations had formed a pure-blood wizarding alliance. Or, more accurately, an elite neo-Death Eater club that had quickly evolved into a carefully constructed, hierarchical crime family with its black, oily tentacles pulsing around the very guts of banks, and institutions, and even whole cities. Their goal: power. Money. Revenge.
They never talk about their childhoods much, is the thing. It did happen a few times—two or three drunken nights on the couch or out on the terrace—things like this would spill out at some point, unprompted and never pushed, like a seeping wound that healed itself over time. Neither of them asked, the other just started talking and they would listen, silent and present, a human gauze to sop up all that’s spilling out, the good, the bad, and the dirty. They never mentioned it the next day and that was okay—they both understood it was something the other needed, some things had to be said and locked in a drawer, filed away in the past so that it could be moved on from.
Malfoys hums thoughtfully. “No, that wasn’t their intent, wouldn’t want to get into trouble over some worthless Death Eater scum, now would they?” Harry looks at him in puzzlement and Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I can’t believe I have to explain this to you, don’t they check your wands?”
They both brush it off and, after some awkward fumbling, leave for lunch, shoulder in shoulder, and the silence is a little more charged this time and Harry has no idea how to turn all of it around.
The laughter stops—Draco looks down at his food, now pushing it around his plate with a strangely mournful expression.
Dmitri mutters something in what Harry assumes is Russian, glaring at him with disdain, and spits on the ground. Clenching his jaw, Harry twists his fingers a little more and the mobster lets out a raspy cry. He can feel his injured hand burn hotter with every second they waste—Dmitri has to undo the spell and Harry will squeeze it out of him if he has to. Dmitri’s face looks even worse from up close when Harry leans in, regarding him calmly. “Do you think that just because I’m with the Aurors, I won’t make you?” he whispers dangerously.
With shaking hands, Draco manages to open his flies and Harry groans at the release of pressure on his already filling cock, now tenting his underwear and leaving wet stains on the thin, white cotton. Draco’s fingers ghost over his erection but there’s an unspoken vulnerability, a slight tremble and a barely-there pause before Harry fully gives in—he rocks his hips pointedly, hissing at the slightest friction, trying to catch his breath.
They go back to their room after a while and Harry’s glad to find a small electric kettle and a few bags of complimentary tea in one of the cupboards. Malfoy watches him with fascination as Harry plugs it in but quickly turns away when he’s caught. He walks around the room, examining every Muggle thing he can find: playing with the light switches until Harry tells him to stop, poking the long-used-up air freshener by the door, and even pulling the ceiling fan rope to find it out of order.
“Spoiled git,” Harry huffs, and adds before Draco can form a retort: “It’s open twenty-four hours, we can go later tonight.”
“Bye, Draco,” Luna says, trying to kiss Draco’s cheek and Draco smiles at her and bends down so she can reach his face.
Draco stares at his hands with hunger and Harry bites his lip, feeling the low thrum of the Glamour Spells over his skin. His heart is racing, strangely terrified of what he’s about to do and it shouldn’t be a big deal—it feels
“One of the days, there will come something we can’t run from, Harry,” he whispered, and Harry kept kissing his hair and whispering nonsense into the moonlight strands.
They use the old entrance; Harry actually only knows about it by accident—he’s friendly with the janitor on their floor and the old man mentioned maintenance staff often uses it for convenience as it leads to a side corridor near the Atrium. When Harry and Draco finally reach the main hall, they find it completely empty. It’s awfully unsettling, reminding Harry of that one fateful night in the Department of Mysteries in his fifth year as their steps echo off the high, arched ceiling, without a single soul in sight.
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco goes silent but definitely feels Harry staring a hole in the side of his face. Finally, he breaks. “Look, if he were a breakfast food, he’d be porridge. Perfectly bland and regular but also nutritious and a choice that’s…”
“You’re here,” Draco said quietly as soon as Harry stepped through the Floo. He looked as if he had been pacing his living room for the last few days if the bags under his eyes and guarded look he greeted Harry with were any indication.
“It’ll be fine. It’s nothing, remember?” Draco nodded, swiping his thumb over Harry’s lower lip. “Make us some tea? I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
Freddie isn’t too keen on the idea of going back to sleep so Harry brings him along to the living room. Draco is quiet, almost subdued and Harry doesn’t know what to say to make it go away, to restore the balance from twenty minutes ago before he opened his idiotic mouth and asked all the wrong questions. The conversation is a little stilted but the baby acts like a tiny, gurgling buffer and soon, they’re back to their usual banter, arguing about kids’ names (Aramantha is a horrible name and Draco must be insane to think it sounds distinguished) and betting who will get married next (Harry’s money is on Ginny and Luna, Draco has a feeling about Dean and Seamus). They put on the telly in the background and it acts as a small distraction. Something clenches in Harry’s stomach when he casts a sideways look at Draco who’s pretending to watch some medical show, knowing full well that Draco can’t stand the sight of blood. The crease between his brows doesn’t disappear until they all doze off with the baby napping on Harry’s chest sometime later.
“Sometimes it seemed… almost sentient.” Draco huffs and shakes his head again. Harry gets it—years of friendship with Hermione have taught him that people like her and Draco believe some things have just no right to exist, even in the world of magic, and being confronted with things like sentient potions usually causes frustration rather than sparking any academic curiosity.
Harry wanted to dip his tongue in them. One after the other, a slow, wet swirl over the left, then the right, maybe lick up Draco’s back and taste, and
Harry swallowed. His heart was racing; now that his suspicions turned out to be true, Harry wondered if Draco’s reaction had anything to do with him, with this strange, tender thing they’d been doing where Harry put his hands in that hidden, intimate place on his body, or if it was just a physical response of that very body, not yet at terms with its enhanced creature senses.
The next thing he knows is scorching pain, almost as bad as when he was hit. Harry arches off the bed, trying his best to keep his arm from moving and there are strong fingers wrapping around his shoulder, lightly pinning him down. He groans and rolls over just a bit, grabbing onto the nearest thing which ends up being Malfoy’s thigh. It doesn’t matter, it’s as good an anchor as any to stop the thrashing, and Harry doesn’t acknowledge the hard, warm muscle underneath the thin fabric of Draco’s trousers, nor should he, because it’s irrelevant, and therefore it’s completely all right to dig his fingers in and squeeze.
Malfoy speaks very matter-of-factly but Harry knows the meaning behind his words. Narcissa was probably grieving her husband even before he died, living with the knowledge he would never be back, the knowledge that her family would never be the same again after the horrors they had seen and could do nothing about.
Seamus stares at her unblinkingly, an impressive feat with how droopy his eyelids were getting, until he just takes a gulp of beer, discouraged by a sharp, warning glance from Draco, of all people. Harry feels something warm expand in his chest because Draco is turning into a mother Dragon and that’s something Harry is absolutely going to tease him about later.
Luna’s expression turns thoughtful. “Well, you said you wanted a companion. And Archibald is a lovely person—he’s very kind and polite, just like you!”
Draco’s still unsure, still torn between running for the hills and allowing himself something he’s probably never considered an option—he searches Harry’s face, almost shyly, and traces a long finger over the freckles dappled across Harry’s cheekbone.
by coming here,” he growls, propping himself on the metal table. The chains around the legs jangle ominously as Malfoy leans forward. “They have someone inside the Ministry,” he says urgently, “possibly in the very DMLE, and you plan to pin it to your office board next to the bloody cafeteria menu!”
It begs to be squeezed, and slapped, maybe even bitten, and Draco feels he’s the man for the job. And he would, if only it weren’t for the solid shell of numerous Glamours and Concealment Charms the Department insists on slapping over their employees’ faces on a daily basis.
He hears some light footsteps and Neville’s friend (Amy, he reminds himself) emerges from between the greenery with a happy spring to her step. Immediately, it strikes Harry how kind and down-to-earth she seems; she’s wearing a pair of wellingtons but that’s about it in the gardening getup department. The rest is just a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. If anything, Amy looks more like a student than a Magical Botanist. Her blond hair is tied in a ponytail that bounces cheerfully as she approaches, and there are freckles all over her face that’s currently split in a wide grin.
Suddenly, Harry squashed down the strangest need to be gentle with him and it must have been his innate defiance holding him back when he dove back in and wrapped his lips around that patch of skin, tasting the sweat and imprinting Draco’s scent on his tongue.
Harry looks down at his hands, carefully folded in his lap. “Yeah.” He feels a hot flush crawl up his neck and face, setting him aquiver. He waits.
“Still got it!” Blaise shouts from the kitchen, and Pansy laughs, and drinks to that. Draco rolls his eyes.
“Potter, we don’t have time, I’ll explain it on the way,” he says firmly, his deep voice filling the small space. “He says he will only talk to you and we both know we don’t have nearly enough evidence to keep him here against his will,” he adds, bitterly.
He brushes a thumb across Harry’s cheek, his breath slowing down. “Wait, wait, fuck,” he whispers. “We need to stop.”
Harry tilted his head and smiled, feeling his ages-old penchant for mischief rear its head to the surface and it must have been the added variable of Draco being so close bringing out the schoolboy in him. “You gotta,” he gestured vaguely around Draco’s head. “Look more, uh. You know.” Harry bit his lip. Raised a brow. “You wanna make his ego suffer? This is how we do it.”
“I regret every single instance I have ever had a conversation with you,” Draco said and took a swig of his lager. It was some artisan-craft thing Harry didn’t know the name of but it had a nice colour so at least Draco wasn’t in a complete slop stage. “I should have known better, shouldn't I?” Draco sighed, pursing his lips.
Draco rolls his eyes and scoots closer, hooking his leg over Harry’s hip. “Yes, you do. Caring is literally at the top of the List of Things Harry Potter Does. And we talked about this, remember? You will give up your comfort just to appease everyone around you and call it kindness.”
, where Draco’s breathing was relaxed as he melted into their embrace and Harry was able to keep him safe. He focused on the smooth tones coming from the gramophone, on the way Draco smelled and the way Draco’s nose dug into his neck. Harry took deep, steadying breaths and, inexplicably, didn’t think about all the things they could have done if they had more time. He thought about fifteen minutes ago, two days ago, a month ago. Draco kissing him. Draco making love to him. Draco smiling at him as he scooted over on the sofa. He thought about all the time they had together and another wave of helpless panic hit him as he couldn’t remember the last thing Draco cooked for dinner or the colour of the mugs they had their last tea in.
“—my arse, I know,” Harry says, taking them both in his hand, hissing at the contact. “It’s all ready for you,” he purrs into Draco’s ear, guiding his fingers lower, down to the spot he wants them the most.
“Auror Potter, if I didn’t know you any better, the mere thought of undergoing such a procedure would render me violated to my very bones,” Malfoy says haughtily and Harry gives up, letting him vent. “Am I to take your word for it? Wandless, surveilled, on your mercy—”
Harry’s discomfort reaches unsettling levels, his thoughts racing, running over all the pros and cons, before he speaks. “Draco Malfoy is safe. I need to speak to the Minister, do you know where he is?”
talents were still at the Ministry’s service, he scoffed, saying that Harry would be helpless without him and that someone needs to be captain on this bloody sinking ship, sailing the dark and unfriendly seas of bureaucracy. In reality, Harry thinks Draco simply likes his job and the guidance he can give in his position makes him feel like he can help young people with their careers. He doesn’t need to tell Draco that, though.
“Don’t ever hide,” Harry whispered around the kiss. “Not from me, from anyone. There’s so much of you, Draco, and I’m— I think I’m—”
The sight of an unmistakable bulge tenting Draco’s trousers, however, prominent and straining at the dark fabric, made Harry’s own cock twitch.
They soar and crash time and again and take each other apart in every possible way until they both collapse from exhaustion in a heap of tangled limbs and tousled hair.
“Oh not at all!” Luna rushes to comfort him. “I think he already forgot he had a date.” They all look at her in silence and she shrugs a little. “His memory is not what it used to be. For what it’s worth, he had a lovely time, Harry.”
“Maybe I’m too busy wanking myself,” Harry lies, and his cock twitches just like it does every time at the thought of listening in during one of Draco’s outrageously long showers. It’s either all teasing, or Draco has actually been touching himself a few feet away every other night, and Harry isn’t sure which his body is reacting to so viscerally.
Malfoy tenses a little, leaning his forehead on the railing. “I don't know, I was high for most of it.”
“It’s also good for the—environment,” Harry groans, desperately trying to keep himself from coming. Which he still cares about, damn it all to hell.
“Welcome home,” he says and spreads his arms with a wide smile. “The baby is alive, the flat is intact, Draco’s here. He’s not helpful at all.”
Something fiery clenched inside Harry’s stomach, a desperate, consuming want setting his nerves on fire. “Do you want to stop?” he asked, so quietly there was a chance Draco had missed it. What he definitely didn’t miss, though, was Harry’s own erection, slowly hardening under Draco’s hot, questioning gaze.
And then, six months ago, everything had changed. It was a patrol-turned-raid, an unexpected encounter with a pack of neo-Death Eaters in one of the back alleys of wizarding London’s underbelly. They were surrounded in a matter of seconds, thankfully right after Harry had fired a Patronus to get some help. Spells cut the air in whirrs and rumbles and Harry and Draco fought back, taking down one opponent after the other, working in tandem like an efficient machine programmed to defend.
Potter looks genuinely baffled and even looks down at Draco’s tented trousers. “Aren’t we?” He tilts his head and smiles. “Because you’re—” Draco hisses as Potter squeezes the bulge, damn him to hell. “—sending me some seriously mixed signals here.”
“Potter, are you out of your bloody—” Draco starts and is silenced with another searing-hot kiss. Potter climbs into his lap, straddling his hips, and Draco bites the inside of his lips trying not to moan. He hears a quiet rustle and the room around them vanishes behind a thin, glossy veil when Potter covers them both, head to toe, with his trusty Invisibility Cloak.
Harry’s brain goes to autopilot as pleasure takes over—he’s incoherent, he’s moaning and whimpering and it’s so unbearably good, he might come from just that. Draco laves his hole with hot, deliberate licks, still holding his cheeks apart, his stubble scratching Harry’s over-sensitised skin. All he can focus on is just pushing back as far as he can with little twitches of his thighs, baring himself to the white-hot bliss that threatens to tear him apart, to the way Draco groans in pleasure as if he’s getting off on it just as much as Harry is. He hoists Harry up by the hips so he’s kneeling on the bed with his legs spread shamelessly, face buried in the pillows. Harry moves his arms, searching for something to hold on to, and Draco’s hand finds his, guiding it to the back of his head.
Harry’s hand lingered near the base of the wings, right above the place where the godly-smelling oil slowly trickled down Draco’s back. He wanted to bury his face there.
Later that day, the gang ends up at Harry’s house for a spontaneous get-together. Harry has long given up on figuring out why its always his house, of all places, that has ended up being the ultimate social pilgrimage destination, but he never complains. It’s always a pleasant surprise to come home to Ginny and Luna making dinner in his kitchen as Kreacher looms in the shadows with an expression of a particularly ugly gargoyle, or meeting Ron and Hermione right on the stoop and going inside together to hang out and talk about their respective days. Sometimes, Draco pops in uninvited too, forever overdressed in his slim waistcoats, button-down shirts and fitting trousers. It always baffles Harry how Draco can just step in through the Floo, unceremoniously plop down on the couch and demand tea looking like that. He looks like a tabloid photograph, a celebrity after a particularly heavy red carpet party, all classy, proper and completely debauched. It drives Harry mad wondering if Draco sleeps in dress robes, or takes showers in a suit.
Draco frowns, sniffing around the kitchen. He shuffles towards Harry and wraps his arms around Harry’s waist, hooking his chin over Harry’s shoulder. “What are you making?”
Harry can’t believe him. He also can’t believe himself for entertaining this for so long. “Of course I do! Malfoy, don’t push your fucking luck—”
The man, to Draco’s utter mortification and Potter’s clear amusement, lets himself in as if they were going to materialise out of thin air (and that vision is just more nightmare fuel, thank you very much). Draco curses his life and the lunatic who’s used the word ‘mysteries’ when naming the department since the definition of privacy in these cursed dungeons is flexible at best.
“Apparently, pampering you is now my job,” Harry says with a lopsided smile. He’s feeling a little tipsy but still sees Draco’s eyes darken just a fraction, contrasting with the smile still plastered to his face.
Draco nodded frantically, simply said, “Yes,” and, “fuck, you’re wet,” pressing his forehead against Harry’s.
Potter has stayed over nine times at Draco’s place, usually achieving it through wrapping himself around Draco’s slim frame
His friends cast a quick, nervous look at each other. Hermione tries to take cover using her hair and the binder, Ron suddenly seems very interested in modern art, examining one of the pictures on the wall.
“Do it,” Malfoy says hoarsely. “I accept your conditions.” His eyes are the only thing that betray him, shining with renewed determination but a shadow of fear, too, almost unrecognisable in the deep, calm silver.
“You need to get some sleep,” she says tiredly, sitting down next to Harry and treating him with a severe look.
“That’s what I thought,” Harry murmurs, trying to control his breathing. “Take off the fucking shirt.”
“Oh yeah, Ron, he’s great at conversation, as soon as he’s done pooing and drooling,” Harry deadpans and Draco makes a disgusted sound.
All the things Harry’s been learning about Draco are now blurry at best, all the times Harry had thought he was right about something became a moot point in the argument embodied in Draco’s person. Getting him to drop his guard is a non-stop game of chess Harry has to pretend he’s not really playing while letting Draco win all at the same time. It should be exhausting, to analyse his every move without looking, to keep peeling off the layers of his meanings, but the closer Harry gets to Draco’s core, the sweeter the gratification.
Of course, that kiss was a ruse. Draco wouldn’t have been caught dead participating in an act so clichée as kissing his secret, forbidden lover before letting him run off to save the day. And, of course, Draco would know how to distract Harry long enough to pickpocket him. Which means—
Draco digs his fingers into his shirt and twists the fabric, and Harry’s left breathless when their lips catch against one another, not really kissing, just prolonging the moment, and it has no right be so arousing but Harry feels like he might explode if he doesn’t taste Draco, and touch him, and be the only person he looks at, even if it’s just for a while. It’s weeks of pent-up desire compressed into one moment; it’s them, standing in an empty launderette at three in the morning under sharp, fluorescent lights, their electric buzz and the machine’s steady churn the only sounds in the background.
settle down, heavy on his shoulders. The floor looks empty while it should be bustling with Aurors at this time of the day and Harry takes a quick look at Ron who looks just as alarmed as Harry feels.
“And now, I’m choosing you,” Draco says and kisses him, turning them around and pressing Harry against the wall.
Harry slid Draco’s glass away and out of his reach, and replaced it with his hand before he could talk himself out of it “Come on.” He entangled their fingers and his heart might have given up at that point, the moment Draco’s fingers went willingly, almost on instinct, his expression not yet caught up with the rest of his body. “There’s something in the loo I need to show you,” Harry said with a crooked smile.
“Fuck you,” he spits and throws his jacket on the bed, the leather holster following shortly after. “Fuck you, Potter.”
you sent me aren’t going to cut it,” he adds, still remembering crumpling up Draco’s letter and fishing it out of the bin later. Pathetic.
The place looks really nice actually, in a quiet, suburban kind of way. There’s a small patio in front, surrounded by white, wooden boxes with sumptuous lavender bushes that permeate the air with a calming aroma mingling with the smell of coffee and croissants. A few white wrought iron tables are scattered in no particular order, with matching chairs, each decorated with a dainty pillow or a folded blanket thrown over the elbow rest. A lilac awning covers the space and it’s adorned with ropes of fairy lights that must give the place a romantic touch after it gets dark. Harry jumps a little when a young waitress smiles at him as she steps outside, accompanied by the silvery tinkle of a bell hung above the french door. His grimace of anguish must look nothing like the easy smile she sent his way because the girl quickly grabs a watering can that’s left under the windowsill and proceeds to focus all of her attention on watering the plants, studiously avoiding Harry’s gaze.
Harry quietly treads to Ron and Hermione’s bedroom, casting a dim, wandless Lumos, and opens the door just enough to get his head through the crack. He smiles at the tiny orb of golden light in his palm and sends it floating into the room. It flutters over little Freddie who’s, thankfully, still fast asleep, snoring softly in the makeshift crib Harry had Transfigured for him. Harry can’t really blame the little guy for being that knackered, he’s had his fair share of rude awakenings today.
“He’s… not mine,” Harry says, feeling stupid he even needs to clarify that but Draco looks like there’s some intense thinking going on inside his head—his lips are a little parted and he’s blinking too much. His hand fiddles with the collar of his shirt and after some mild struggle, he manages to open the top button.
Their mystery witness runs a hand through perfectly messy, platinum hair and shoots him a devious smile.
Harry feels a soft, small hand on his shoulder and hears Hermione’s soothing voice, but he can’t take his eyes off Draco long enough to focus on anything else. He hears more shouts in the background, more footsteps as Kingsley screams out orders to the Aurors and people run around to find all the intruders still roaming around the building.
There’s no reversing that damage and Harry doesn’t expect Malfoy would react well, were he to bring it up. The fresh injuries are a good distraction as Harry stares and stares, his stomach caving in more and more, until he finds his voice, just enough to force a hoarse whisper. “Fuck…”
Harry opens his mouth and pauses. “I… no. He always uses memos. Always.” He shakes his head. “But that still doesn’t mean anything.”
Draco chuckles. “Well, at least you kept those two alive,” he jerks his head at Harry, then at Ron. “Gods know England needs all the Saviours and gingers it can get.”
Two months, however, is just enough for the Family to hire the best lawyers they can find. It’s ideal for quick damage control and setting off to find and eliminate their most important witness. The witness who’s currently seven feet away from Harry, possibly finishing up his coffee. The witness who’s probably the worst person for an Auror to be babysitting, seeing their volatile track record with said Auror isn’t anything to brag about.
Draco opened his mouth, then closed it. “I need them, ah, smoothed out,” he croaked. “The… grey-ish spots, it’s dust, and grime, it should come right off,” he said quickly, tucking his hair behind his ear in a nervous gesture. “You can just comb through them with your fingers,” Draco added, so quietly Harry almost missed it.
He thinks about the Surveillance Spell and the wonders it might work if his professional morals were anything but strict, he wonders if Malfoy really puts his money where his mouth is, if the repercussions are worth the thrill—they’re not, not in Harry’s world, not when the stakes are so high. Harry has decided to be methodical about it, cautious and calculating, leaving no room for mistakes or slip-ups. It’s not about Malfoy, and definitely not about Harry—it’s about one of many attempts to fix the world, ones that sometimes feel like scrubbing a hallway with a toothbrush but still keep him sane.
he look like Draco? Would it be a good or a bad thing if he did? Does everyone suddenly find Draco attractive and if yes, what’s it to Harry? His stomach feels a little tight at the thought of dating a Draco look alike. It feels wrong for a reason Harry can’t quite put his finger on, it’s not like anyone could replace Draco, that’s just
and awful, and Harry needs to stop spiralling. He looks at his friends, possibly wearing a spectacular deer-in-the-headlights expression.
Daniel is extremely good looking, too. His hair is a dark shade of blond, perfectly coiffed without a strand out of place, and even with the wind blowing outside it stays in place without looking like a helmet. It doesn’t get attractively tousled when he runs his hand through it or fall into his eyes when he bends over the menu, and lacks the moonlight glimmer Harry’s so used to seeing in blond hair. His eyes are the bluest blue Harry’s ever seen and they make his face look soft and kind, without any sharpness or bite. Those calm, soothing eyes combined with his soft, rounded features make the man look like an actual fairy tale prince. He smells nice, too—it’s nothing fresh or sharp, the cologne he uses is more subdued and earthy, like a fireplace with the fire put out, maybe like a house with the windows closed—it doesn’t make Harry feel anything but it still perfectly pleasant and somehow fits Daniel, with his kind face, gentle demeanour, and calm, neutral voice.
He eyes the remote stuck between the sofa cushions. After everything that’s happened, Harry’s not really in the mood to put the telly back on. Not even Graham Norton will manage to make him smile right now.
“What?” Harry pauses. “Why— How did you come to that conclusion?” He feels his face is heating up again and it’s not fair, to end up an apple-cheeked maiden, thrown into
It could have been the weather—the non-stop feeling of a light, freezing drizzle, turning the insides of their collars cold and wet, making their hair curl and stick to their foreheads, or those three weeks of wandering with the knowledge that there are still five left and someone could come after them any given day. It could have been any number of the little things that come with living in close quarters, but suddenly they were screaming at each other with thunder rolling in the background as if Odin himself was sick of the sour tension lingering in the air.
as he cards shaking fingers through Harry’s mess of dark hair. It gets easier with every downstroke and Draco’s broken whimpers only spur him on, making his cock leak onto the sheets every time Draco sobs in pleasure.
Harry grinned and waved at the bartender, then he gently plucked Malfoy’s miserable pint out of his hand. He ignored the strange spark he felt when their fingers brushed. For now.
Harry’s heart is racing so fast, it’s about to jump out of his chest. Draco’s there, alive, even paler than usual, wearing a pair of soft joggers and wrapped in bandages. His hair is sticking out in every possible direction, his face is still a little bruised and Harry wants to burst out laughing with the tremendous relief filling his lungs to the very brim.
. He moaned and sped up his movements, thinking about coming all over those gorgeous freckles, wondering if Potter would have let him, if he would have liked it. The things he wanted to do to Potter,
His lips stretch into a smile around the bottle. “I knew where to look for quality entertainment,” he says cryptically but his smile falters. “It was too late, though. Their eyes were on the prize and they were already making a move.”
“Why are we here?” He turns his head to look at Harry, and Harry’s heart does that annoying, stuttery thing again. He stifles it, though, clearing his throat.
Draco tries to jerk out of his grip, refusing to look him in the eyes. “What is your problem?” he hisses. In the background, the man looks at them curiously.
Harry shifts back and hauls Draco upright to claim his mouth once again. With a racing heart, he slides Draco’s jacket off his shoulders as he sucks a bruise into his neck, laving the spot with hard, hot swipes of his tongue. The leather holster with the gun follows the jacket to the floor, its clatter echoing in the silent room. Draco is holding on to him for dear life, letting out soft, barely audible whimpers as he lets Harry devour his mouth again, and again, and again.
“Harry, language!” Hermione calls right before the door closes behind them. Harry can still hear Ron’s muffled voice for a few seconds, something along the lines of
They slowed down a bit but still kissed, dizzily, with Harry’s mouth seeking out Draco’s, with soft, slow licks right at the seam of the other’s lips, and it quickly turned into something more urgent, with dragging hips and low moans.
They reach a small town square, already starting to bustle with people going back from work and school and while it’s slightly unsafe, Harry can appreciate the advantages of blending into a crowd and becoming faceless for a little while. He takes a look around and is struck with how peaceful this nameless town actually is. Cast iron benches line the square, already bathed in the afternoon sun, a statue of some Muggle hero stands in the middle, proudly watching over the area as people walk around, engrossed in their business.
, a sure indicator he has lost his bloody mind after all, deciding to sacrifice all his himbo brainpower solely to the pursuit of sexual gratification.
“It’s,” Harry huffed with some sort of relieved amusement, putting his wand down. “It’s perfume. Magical, but still—just perfume.”
He pauses as Draco’s fingers wrap around his wrist. He gently guides Harry’s hands so he plates the last pancake and turns the stove off. And then, Draco pulls him away, turns them and promptly devours Harry against the kitchen counter.
,” he gasped, thighs already shaking as Draco massaged his hole with the pad of his index finger, and buried his nose in the soft flesh between Harry’s thigh and his cock. Gods, he smelled amazing there, his scent was the strongest in that intimate place, heady and delicious. Draco dived back in, laving his hole with hard, stabbing licks, until he breached the muscle and slid his tongue inside.
them when he’s all patched up. Draco paces around the room, casting wards on the door and windows, throwing various Privacy and Repelling Charms and Harry’s mildly impressed with his sharp efficiency; Draco is taking all the precautions he would himself. He watches Draco move around the room; he puts the kettle on, pours himself a glass of the whiskey and downs it in one go, then takes off his suit jacket. Draco’s taking off that bloody shoulder holster and checking his gun for any moisture when Harry hears him humming; it’s an unfamiliar melody and the sound is soothing, reverberating in Draco’s chest in a low tone as he opens the first aid kit, examining its contents.
kind of way. Like when you blow me,” he says, and Draco snorts at Harry speaking his language. “Do you expect anything in return?”
“Tell you what,” Harry relaxes against his shoulder, easing into their casual closeness with a relaxed sigh. “I’ll invite you to join us next time,” he murmurs, knowing it would make Draco happy.
Draco’s still and quiet as he keeps staring, his eyes following Harry’s every move, regarding him from the top of his head, down his arms, and zoning in on the tiny baby boy who bravely stares right back with a clear mutual fascination. He hasn’t replied to Harry’s jab and, knowing Draco, it was reason enough to be concerned.
Draco swallows the words with another kiss and Harry half-expects him to ask if he’s sure or to say something nice and tender but Draco thinks better of it and shifts them so he’s on top of Harry. “Yeah. All right,” he says simply, privately. “Turn over for me. On your stomach.” He says the words so softly, Harry can’t help but stare in complete adoration, his heart leaping out of his chest.
Usually, once Harry started to touch himself down there, it was  rather difficult to stop, but he couldn’t bring himself to press any deeper, not with the way a single drop of wing oil trickled down Draco’s forearm, and definitely not with the knowledge Draco was about to fuck him
,” Draco sighs, earning a snigger from Dean and Seamus, “and molest Potter about his private life, or lack thereof, through socially inappropriate questions.”
And then, there’s Potter. Potter, whose eyes are nearly black, who’s still hard as rock and leaking down Draco’s shirt, who, Draco suddenly realises, is very much
, he’s glad they’re at a bar so he can drown the feeling it left under a generous layer of low-quality lager.
Draco loves the feeling. He loves the easy slide into Teddy’s fucked-out little hole, loves the squelch of Harry’s come already inside, loves sucking on those pierced nipples as he fucks up into his spoiled, greedy boy. This, what the three of them have, Draco wouldn’t trade for anything else.
something, and he likes to think he’s better at doing than talking, so slowly, carefully, he takes one of Draco’s hands in his.
He smiles when Draco graces him with a pointed look but still lets him prop his hands on the edge of the bench, on both sides of Draco’s hips.
true—vacationing with Harry Potter himself, eh?” Zabini says with delight in his voice but then, his expression darkens. “Also, why am I here? I was worried! I thought you were dead! I basically performed a Dark bloody ritual to find you!” he says, reproach and concern etched into his face. “I want to help. Draco, there’s someone in the Ministry, I’m sure of it. Do you really trust the Aurors?”
Harry lunges forward into the kiss, palming at Draco’s ribs, his heart, tracing his scars with trembling fingers, kissing his apologies into Draco’s mouth, and in exchange, Draco whispers reassurances between choked breaths and hot swipes of tongue.
“How did you know we’d— I mean…” Harry trails off, trying to match the last pieces of the puzzle. His head still hurts from the fall and he takes another sip of coffee, hoping it will help.
Draco was already staring at him with trepidation when Harry came into the kitchen, after politely slamming the door in the Vault Man’s face. The apparent drop in Harry’s mood turned the air a little heavy and questions were bound to be asked, questions Harry would rather not answer, knowing Draco all too well.
Daniel kisses him. It’s a soft peck, it’s tame and safe and all the things that Daniel is and he doesn’t taste like chocolate or wine, doesn’t smell like citrus and spice and the thought of his lips on Harry’s doesn’t send a shiver down his spine like it ought to. He breaks it off after a second or two like he’s been hit with a Stunner and if Daniel is surprised he doesn’t show it, being the kind, polite, perfect model of man that he is.
There’s not much time to ponder over all the events that led to this moment—Harry opens his desk drawer and memories of the Horcrux hunt flood his mind like a river after a drought. He allows himself to run his fingers over the soft, worn leather for a second, feeling strangely emotional thinking about everything he went through with his two best friends. His jaw clenches at the thought of what needs to be done now; Harry ties the pouch around his neck and hides it under his uniform. With its weight secure and solid at his chest, Harry casts one last look at his and Ron’s office, wondering how soon he will get to see it again.
Finally, they sit down in the dingy waiting room chairs, arm in arm, both nursing a cup of awful hospital coffee, both wearing grave expressions. They sit in silence that’s tense but companionable, something they’ve become adept at through years of friendship, and Harry’s grateful Ron doesn’t flood him with questions as soon as they have a minute alone.
Harry’s breathing heavily, feeling some of his anger dissipate, replaced by an aching, empty space as he watches Draco wipe some of the blood with the back of his hand.
He doesn’t have time to think when the horn of an oncoming truck blares at them and the last thing he registers is how bright Malfoy’s hair shines, illuminated by the deadly glow.
It’s because Harry now knows that Draco smiles when he’s woken up with a kiss. Because Harry now sees that Draco deliberately lets his smile reach his eyes when he looks at him. Because Harry now understands they might have been afraid of the same things all along.
Draco really rubbing off on him that much? And if he is, is it a bad thing? Harry doesn’t think it’s a bad thing. He likes Draco, likes talking to him and spending time with him. Sure, the prat is just as dramatic as an Old Hollywood diva but he’s also sharp, and witty, and fierce, sometimes for the both of them. And as has recently become very relevant, Draco is his rock, no matter how ridiculous it may sound—he’s reasonable when Harry’s not, he’s strong when Harry can’t bring himself to be, and he’s always there when Harry needs him. And he doesn’t set him up with complete strangers behind his back like some traitorous (but caring) friends apparently do.
For now, Harry lets himself melt into porcelain skin and almond-smelling sheets, and waits for the inevitable endgame.
“Really?” Draco asks wryly. “It’s your wand arm, correct? I imagine it will be quite uncomfortable to cast with it at the moment,” he says airily, rinsing the washcloth in the bowl and wringing out the excess water. “And your left hand isn’t as accurate wandless, I saw it back there.”
Harry kisses him one more time, claiming him with teeth and tongue, and rolls him onto his stomach; his cock slips hot and snug into the dip between Draco’s cheeks and Harry rolls his hips, once, twice, leaving a wet trail marking the flushed skin. His magic feels juvenile and beyond any control as Harry brushes his hands all over Draco’s back and down his flanks, feeling it ripple off his fingers in smooth, delicate waves. Draco’s legs spread on instinct and Harry hisses as his slit drags over Draco’s hole, pink and tight, and his mouth waters at the very sight.
Potter wears his huge, ridiculous heart on his sleeve which resulted in a total of five times he told Draco he likes him. While Draco prefers to be rather careful with his emotions, always painfully aware of the weight that words can carry, Potter says things like that as if it were breathing, unabashedly playing with Draco’s hair, and kissing the tip of his nose, and making lemon red snapper for dinner because it’s Draco’s favourite. It should be disconcerting but Draco quickly forgets why when he’s busy casting protective spells all over Potter so that no important parts are lost to an unfortunate spill, while the bastard cooks naked, for Draco to taste and behold.
Draco rolls off of him and Harry whimpers at the loss of his delicious, comforting heat. It doesn’t last long, though—Draco immediately takes Harry into his arms and kisses him with a satisfied sigh, hand moving down in between his arse cheeks. Harry blushes for some ridiculous reason—Draco’s
The four of them chat a little more and then, it’s time for Harry and Draco to go back to their respective dwellings. They leave together to Disapparate outside the flat after having said a somewhat stilted goodbye and Draco seems to be in a hurry to get home. Harry shouldn’t feel hurt about it—after all, Draco did come to rescue him from a miserable end to a miserable day without batting an eyelash and even seemed to enjoy himself until—
“He was… short.” Harry’s face must have taken the colour of the contents of Draco’s glass by now. There’s a pause. “Oh my God, fine!” He throws his arms up in defeat. “Just because of the wedding!”
, with a mix of curiosity and some sort of innocent abashment evident on his face. “So when you say— Love chair, you mean,” he swallowed.
There’s a snort and the man speaks again. “It’s ridiculous, isn’t it? It doesn’t even look like him,” he says, skimming the article, and groans. “They always manage to mention the fact he’s single. And his arse, why is it always the arse?”
He doesn’t tell Malfoy what’s going on—he would never take that leap and risk sharing his suspicions before getting a solid confirmation. So as soon as they wake up, the only thing Harry can do is to fidget. He spills his tea, distracted with dark thoughts obstinately buzzing in his mind, trying to swat them away like flies that just wouldn’t get the hint. He shovels down his breakfast like he’s been starved and only slows down at Malfoy’s disgusted expression from across the table. He takes off his jacket with too much force, pulling off a button, throws things instead of putting them down and nearly rips out the pages of the magazine he tries to distract himself with.
He smiles at the crease between Draco’s brows, entirely more adorable than worrisome. “Draco. What do kids eat?” Harry asks and is treated with a patented murderous glare and an irritated scoff.
With hot, sticky lungs and his lower lip bruised under his teeth, Harry starts to move his hand in time with those delicious huffs—full, excruciating strokes, head to hilt, twisting his wrist and thumbing the slit. It’s perhaps the most erotic thing he’s ever done, listening while Draco touches himself and doing the same, thinking about him. He wonders if Draco’s cheeks get flushed when he’s close, if that flush reaches his chest, mingling with the thin sheen of sweat beading at his skin. If he bites his lip, or maybe lets his mouth fall open, pink, soft, and gasping, and perfect to lick into, and Harry’s hand speeds up as he imagines Draco’s filthy mouth stretched around him, imagines thrusting into that perfect heat. Draco would look into his eyes, definitely, just like he always does when he teases and flirts, just like he did when the stormy silver darkened with an invitation that Harry accepted as if the devil himself coaxed him to.
“It’s cake! What’s not to like?” Ron shouts incredulously, always first to stand by any and all food. “And look, they gave me samples!” He points to a large pile of boxes on the kitchen counter.
When Draco finally moved, Harry instinctively slid back to the end of the bed before the wings swooshed past, their heavenly-smelling feathers nearly grazing the tip of his nose.
means, or why a complete stranger would like him to sit on their face, but he tries not to think about it too much.
Harry can’t keep a straight face anymore and he bursts out laughing as he pulls Draco back. “Wait—” He snorts, kissing all over Draco’s face. “I love you. I fucking love you.”
“It’s not that bad,” Harry mutters, and turns at the sound Malfoy makes. “You’re lucky they came after you and I had to get you out in a hurry. You should see some of the safehouses I’ve been to. Or where I grew up,” he adds quietly, despite himself.
“No, no, that’s… amazing,” he says and something flips in his stomach. “I mean, I. I like listening to you. And just… talking. To you,” he finishes awkwardly.
“I think Neville mentioned a new coworker he has, too,” Dean pipes in, grinning. “What is it, Hermione? Are you and Ron the only ones who can throw their hats in the ring?”
Malfoy stands before him, shirt hanging on his elbows, and looks to a distant point above Harry’s ear. His torso is covered in bruises; most are already devoid of the usual angry, purple-red tint, though there’s still some faded, dark spatters of broken blood vessels around the marks. Most of them are centred around the ribs, but there’s a particularly nasty one on Malfoy’s abdomen, where it’s lightly dusted with the coarse, dark-blond hair growing under his navel. Harry’s mouth tastes acrid as he looks him over, positive that if he commanded Malfoy to turn around, he would find the same bruising around his lower back; the kidneys are a sensitive area and one well-placed hit can bring an opponent to the ground as fast as any spell. All of the bruises are large and soft around the edges, the result of blunt force, like the tip of a heavy, standard Auror issue boot. He takes a step closer, inspecting the strange discolourations scattered without a pattern and immediately realises they’re Stinger marks. A mean way to cast them, too, the intent visible in every scab already struggling to heal.
Just as Draco moves to touch him, Harry grabs his wrists. “Hands stay here,” he murmurs, putting Draco’s hands back on his hips. “Fuck, I love it when you push me down like that,” Harry whispers, and then, he starts to move.
a hitman. It became very apparent, very soon, that I’m as good at killing as you are at leaving things alone,” he smirks.
“There are spells, sure, but those used to be cast on women back in the day.” He grimaces. “You know, when arranged marriages were all the rage, and the brides-to-be weren’t exactly as pure as their rich old betrothed would have expected. But, mind you, it was merely a physical procedure, now an outdated one, and thank Merlin for that.” Draco rests his head on Harry’s and the comfort of being able to talk to Draco about it makes something in his chest ache.
“You’re so gross,” Ginny grimaces, looking at her brother with disgust. “We could tie a bag of food around your neck, you know, like the ones horses have?” Next to her, Neville snorts into his glass.
Harry kissed him. He kissed Draco like he was his whole universe (he could have been, actually) and immediately knew he didn’t want to kiss anyone else for the rest of his life. Draco melted into him, opening up and letting Harry take what he had craved for years, moaning into his mouth at his own taste on Harry’s lips and tongue. They took their time, not setting any rhythm, just slowly, agonisingly tasting, and licking, and swallowing the soft sounds and whimpers the other was making.
He smells just like he always does, like sweet, delicate almond milk, now mingling with the crisp smell of a hospital, and Harry buries his nose behind Draco’s ear and inhales, completely unbothered by his bout of neediness. Draco doesn’t seem to mind, positively melting into the embrace, letting out an exhale that sounds as if he’s been holding it for at least as long as Harry waited for Draco to wake up.
is doing fantastic, what’s more, he’s running away with the love of his life, who’s probably young, tan, ripped, and has good hair. Harry pictures them in the Bahamas, Archie rubbing sunscreen on smooth, lickable biceps, the lotion on his veiny, arthritic hands glistening in the Caribbean sun. Tanned himbos are bringing them coconut drinks and in the meantime, Harry masturbates his youth away using his own tears as lubricant.
When they broke apart, Draco’s eyes flashed red right before he closed them and Harry knew he wasn’t supposed to see it.
Hermione counts them out loud on her fingers. “Luna, Ron and I, Neville, and now Ginny, I suppose. That’s four I know of.”
so he hoisted him back up by the hair and coaxed his mouth open with his tongue, eliciting a desperate groan from the back of Harry’s throat.
Harry hooked his fingers at Draco’s belt buckle and pulled him closer. Kissed him, hard. “You are,” he said, fumbling to undo the belt, “the most beautiful thing,” he continued, pulling it out of its loops, undoing Draco’s fly, “I have ever seen,” Harry finished, swallowing Draco’s moan as he slid a hand into Draco’s pants, finding him hard, wet, and
Draco looks at him for a few more seconds before biting down a smile and the moment is over. “If you tell anyone I said this, I’ll murder you.”
Teddy’s thighs are shaking uncontrollably as Draco keeps a firm grip on him, and slowly, carefully, Harry pushes inside the white-hot, tight bliss.
When Maggie was getting her jacket, Harry paused for a second, a silly idea forming in his head. He ran to the kitchen while Maggie stood in the hallway with a bored expression, tapping her fingernails against the screen of her phone, the one and only courtesy she was going to give him that night. Harry searched the fridge door, looking between colourful magnets, magical postcards, grocery lists and Alarm-Charmed reminders until he found it—an elegant, white business card with a phone number printed in a minimalist font, charmed to interchange with the name of the card’s owner.
Harry gets a Floo call from Mungo’s sometime after he wakes up from a sixteen-hour nap. He feels groggy and his head hurts so much it feels like it’s about to split in half, something he hasn’t felt since his scar-hurting times. He combs through the bathroom cupboard and hears the roar of flames just as he downs his last vial of Painkiller Potion, making a mental note to replenish his stash.
And just like that, the moment is over and it feels like switching back to reality from a lucid dream, like waking up in the middle of a crowded street after having sleep walked for three years. The sounds from outside are audible again—cars pass by, people keep walking and Harry has to keep breathing.
And now, Junior Curse-Breaker Harry Potter was due to arrive at Malfoy Manor in three days time, to go through roughly sixty percent of Draco’s most prized possessions and determine if they could be deemed
“Fuck, yeah,” Draco groaned, clenching around the two fingers Harry had up his arse. “Your cock, now. Wanna feel it.”
“I’m not asking—” Harry chuckles. “I think there’s enough facial hair between the two of us,” he says, absently scratching at his beard. It’s very neat, even if Harry says so himself, and he keeps it short—he’s been told it makes him look more refined and goes well with his position, uniform, and status. Harry doesn’t really care about all that, he just likes the way it feels and—quite frankly—hates razor blades with a passion, only resorting to them for… other areas, while also being absolutely pants at Shaving Charms. He hopes it doesn’t look too bad. The beard, that is.
,” he says urgently. They need to be ready to leave as soon as Harry makes that poor excuse of a gangster reverse the curse. Draco pauses, looking Harry in the eyes with an unreadable expression, and eventually releases Dmitri; the man falls to the ground, wheezing and coughing as his lungs finally swallow some much-needed air.
With that peculiar advice, the three of them enter the narrow corridor leading to a small door at the end. The whole space is dimly lit by a single, dingy lamp and smells like an attic. Holding back a sneeze, Harry notices someone has clouded the enchanted one-way mirror—possibly for privacy reasons—but the silence accompanying him as he approaches the door bears something unspoken and the door handle feels just a bit colder than usual when he presses it. Kingsley and Robards stay behind and Harry wants to roll his eyes at the little show he has to put up with just to pander to the whim of some madman.
Harry finds himself conflicted as he lies down in bed that night, staring a hole into the ceiling. He wants to think about what happened until it’s deconstructed to bare atoms, until he has all the fleeting touches and furtive glances labelled and categorised, spread out before him so he can make some sense of it, read it like a textbook and uncover their true meaning. On the other hand, it feels like something sacred, something so fragile it would burst into a thousand pieces at the slightest prod and he doesn’t know whether finding something underneath would be more terrifying than finding nothing at all.
He felt his arousal reach its peak, and he scrambled for purchase, trying to pull Draco in, his hands slipping at the small of Draco’s back. He was soaked, oil generously dripping from the glands and Harry risked sliding his hand higher, just a fraction higher, until he felt the wet tips of the downy feathers brush against his hands.
Harry kisses him, cupping his face in both hands and spells his clothes back on with a thought, something Draco is begrudgingly impressed by, considering he’s just rocked Potter’s world so hard, his thighs are still shivering.
“That would be brilliant,” Harry says, running his thumb over Draco’s lower lip. “But we’re getting some breakfast first. And then, remember we have lunch with our friends. It was at two, I think?”
His entrance is anything but grand—not a single Auror looks up from their desk, not a single quill stops over parchment between one letter and the next, hastily folded memos fail to cease their erratic fluttering in pursuit of their recipients. Suppressing the instinct to roll his eyes, the stranger takes a look around, inspecting the room. There was no need for a Notice-Me-Not after all—they’ve all been busy lately, no doubt, and he knows exactly why.
exactly who they wanted to kiss in a room full of people and it turned out to be their spouse or secret lover, or… you know. You’ve been to the Department of Mysteries. You saw the,” he gestures vaguely, “pink room. What do you think they study there?”
“Not always,” says Draco and there’s a bitter note lacing his voice. “What is it about people that always makes them want what’s worst for them?” he asks, probably not expecting an answer. “First, my bloody father, then, all those mindless gangster-wannabes…”
He trails off, noticing Draco has gone strangely quiet. He’s looking at Harry with an expression that suggests he might have overshared, and Harry immediately feels bad and annoyed at feeling bad because that means Draco’s right, and he really doesn’t like being a burden. While Harry can admit there’s a grain of truth to what Draco’s saying, he can’t help but think that being seen is as dangerous as it is intoxicating.
Draco interrupts him with a hard kiss. “Make me forget,” he whispers urgently against Harry’s lips. “Fuck me, use me,
Recognising his friends before they even enter the office is a fun game Harry plays to pass the time between meetings and the occasional mission in the field, and those have been scarce since his promotion—perhaps Harry missed them a little but not as much as he
“Malfoy,” Harry lifts his hands in a placating gesture. “I’m me, remember? I don’t bloody want it, I’m not going to abuse it, I just need to cast it. It’s procedure—you’re still a criminal until you testify,” Harry says, tired. He wants to lie down.
“Your place,” Potter repeated. “You have a flat, I presume? I heard Malfoy Manor was sold,” he shrugged. “I want to come over.”
“God, I miss London already,” he says dramatically, throwing himself on the bed to watch Harry make their tea. “To think right now, I could be nursing a glass of vintage Ogden’s in one hand, and a pair of tight bollocks in the other.”
Before they can take a better look around, a familiar lynx Patronus bursts in, rumbling in Kingsley’s baritone. “Potter, Weasley, where the hell are you? East wing, now!”
. I taught my house-elves how to make tea like they do, even bought an antique samovar, and never went back to the ways of my English forefathers,” he says, his lips curving into a mean smile. “I hope Lucius is having a blast, rolling in his grave.”
He ran to the living room where Draco was standing behind the sofa, looking at the TV. He was holding on to the backrest, digging his fingers into the worn fabric so hard his knuckles turned white. Harry ran up to him and cupped his face, looking for any signs of distress or injury but Draco wasn’t looking at him. His eyes were glued to the television.
Harry snatches the paper from his hands, too quick for Draco to do anything about it, and immediately incinerates it with a flick of his wrist. He ignores Draco’s soft gasp at the display of wandless magic and refuses to look in his direction. It’s not that it makes him uncomfortable—Draco always gets a strange glint in his eyes whenever Harry does it, ever since he stopped bothering to hide his powers, and it makes him feel…
His attitude drives Harry mad—his lazy-relaxed pose, his prissy, posh clothes, and that smirk. He wants to wipe it off that chiselled face. He clenches and relaxes his muscles—once, twice—taking advantage of the control he has over his body and restraining the nearly primal instinct to punch Malfoy’s lights out.
They’ve always had each other’s backs and never talked about it—an unspoken bond between two Auror partners that Harry only dared wish to be something more in the dead of the night, in the privacy of his own thoughts. He saw a vicious yellow beam of light charging straight at Draco’s back and threw himself in the way without a second thought, holding up the strongest Protego he could muster. It hit, hard, shattering his defence, though luckily only after it had mitigated the full force of the blast. Everything that followed got very blurry, very fast, and promptly faded to black, accompanied by the pops of their backup’s Apparitions.
forget I know how to look after myself,” he says coldly, with the slightest tremble in his voice that only somehow fuels Harry’s rage. “You said I was a free man. You said—”
“You, Potter,” Robards says calmly, clearly satisfied Harry’s put it together. “Malfoy was an… inconvenience, I’ll admit, but we have adapted. As it turns out, some parties find you to be quite a nuisance, especially if they’re planning to take over the Ministry,” he says, his tone suggesting he’s talking about the weather rather than a
For a brief moment, Harry wonders if it’s actually concern for his withered loins that drives Ginny, or if winning the bet is just a victory lap for her competitive streak that’s the main motivating factor here. Either way, it looks like she thought of everything, the sly fox. “Ginny, I don’t know—”
Draco doesn’t say anything else, just licks another deliberate, wet stripe over his arse. And then Harry cries out as Draco pulls his cheeks apart with his thumbs and slowly drags his tongue over his hole.
And Harry can’t say no to him, can’t give up that soft, plush mouth that clings to his like honey, leaving a touch of wetness in its wake that Harry wants to get drunk on. So he kisses back, brushing Draco’s temples with the tips of his fingers and cupping his cheeks, swallows those small sounds and hums his joy along the seam of Draco’s lips.
!” Draco suddenly shouts and kicks the nearest chair, sending it flying across the room. Harry stops it mid-flight with a wave of his hand before it crashes into the nearest lamp.
and helps Harry peel it off without messing up the wound. “You should learn—everything is about either power or—”
He fucks Harry for nearly an hour, hot and slow, pressed against the shower wall with rivulets of hot water dripping down on them, easing Harry’s sore muscles. He ends up sobbing and shaking with pleasure as Draco slams into him from behind with one arm around Harry’s torso, the other holding him by the jaw. It’s wet, steamy, and perfect—by the end, Draco turns him around and Harry comes all over their chests, with his back against the tiled wall and thighs around Draco’s waist.
, not for the power at the tips of his fingers that could turn death away, and not for the scar on his forehead.
“I had no idea,” Harry repeats and is so afraid that he’s lying because even a blind man would see it, so how could he not have known? “Just flaunting it when…” He trails off, trying to clear his head. This is the only chance he will get to make this right. To not lose Draco.
Harry sags into the opposite chair, his back to the two-way mirror, and feels Malfoy’s gaze following his every move. He wants to grit his teeth, knowing Malfoy is probably convinced he’s the one playing the role of the hunter in this little scenario. What Malfoy doesn’t know is Harry has changed quite a lot, too.
“Tsk, tsk, tsk,” Malfoy shakes his head and slides his wand into his sleeve. Harry’s only half-aware he files the fact away, just in case. “Quite a lot of surveillance spells you’ve got there. Mind deactivating them?”
real but… is it though? Are memories erased by Obliviation any less real? Does Amortentia make people truly fall in love?”
He had filed a leave request due to the whole Antiques Roadshow project, seeing it was the Ministry itself that had ordered it, and his superiors at the Wizengamot not only asked he kept working from the Manor—the paranoid old bats wanted all the reports Flooed directly to them instead of having the papers owled, grumbling about interceptions and Muggle airplanes. Draco only rolled his eyes, yet to learn about an owl that flew that high.
“Ohh,” Harry gasps, “that’s right, don’t stop,” he says, grabbing Draco by the hair and kissing him hard.
He got to work just fine in the morning, expecting everything to go smoothly and without any hangups—nothing bad ever happens on Fridays. Fridays are sacred—every single Ministry Worker seems to tread carefully, with a strange kind of giddiness, doing everything in their power to make things light and easy. The lifts make fewer stops, the interns don’t trip over their own legs, the solicitors seem less feral, and statistics show that even crime rates are lower on Fridays, as if the criminals of London collectively decided to give the Aurors a break once a week. Which, in consequence, makes Harry wonder about the existence of a weekly Crime Bulletin, announcing the upcoming misdeeds, introducing changes in hierarchy, maybe sharing a scone recipe or two, and finally, closing with a kind reminder to refrain from any criminal activity on Friday, unless someone’s on a deadline (read page seven for extortion etiquette). Harry chuckles at the concept, making a mental note to share the idea with Draco later.
They dry off, and only after Draco’s sure Harry isn’t hurt and okay to walk, they finally have the pancakes Harry made—Draco sits on the counter with Harry standing in the vee of his legs. Harry absently thinks it has to be one of the best mornings of his life and at some point, finds himself planning the next ones they could have. Judging by the look in Draco’s eyes, as they laugh, and talk, and eat, Harry’s not the only one. Amused, he remembers how he once wondered about Draco’s posh clothes—it took just one night together to discover that Draco Malfoy doesn’t, in fact, shower in a suit. And he doesn’t sleep in dress robes. He sleeps, and showers, and walks around the bedroom completely, gloriously nude, striking, pale and gorgeous, and Harry adds that fact to his list with a goofy smile.
“It’s your house,” Draco said with a hint of amusement, turning his head to brush his nose against Harry’s cheek. “I’m just a tenant here.”
They wrestle for a while and roll off to the floor, Ron trying to wiggle out and crawl away, Harry trying to pin him down, accompanied by the girls’ giggles and Draco’s exasperated chuckle. Finally, after a little help from some handy wandless, wordless magic, Harry manages to come up victorious, sitting down on Ron’s back who’s lying face-down on the floor with his hair sticking out and a red, grumpy face.
The only thing that mattered in all of it was Draco. A lighthouse in a storm, his side the safest place Harry could be, his hands cradling Harry’s head, his first kiss in the morning, and the last one before falling asleep. A life with Draco was worth everything they had gone through—a wizarding war, a Muggle one looming over their heads, all the hiding, the pretending, and the terrifying knowledge it was either this, or nothing. They lived happily, yet carefully, not drawing too much attention, just enough to be invisible, just enough to be another face in the crowd. They would share a polite wave with a neighbour or two, have a few drinks in their garden just like any other young gentlemen would deem appropriate on a Saturday evening, they would even exchange some pleasantries with the milkman, while fetching the post in the morning. Harry doesn’t remember the last time he held Draco’s hand out in the open or the last time he kissed the sunlight off his shoulders. It was the price they agreed to pay for safety. For love. If he could go back in time, Harry would have agreed all over again, he would have gone underground and lived in the dark, his only light the one in Draco’s eyes when he looked at him.
“See, Ron, I’m expressing my affection!” Harry cranes his neck to look at his best mate, currently picking at the carpet with spite and pointedly ignoring him.
Granger turns to Draco and Draco straightens, ready for whatever’s to come. “Just for the record, I won’t blame you for Harry’s recklessness. I expect you two can keep this under wraps at work?”
Malfoy’s getting his deal. Harry’s head spins with the gravity of the news—Malfoy was telling the truth, Malfoy is a target, he’s hunted by the mafia, and Harry’s job is to now make sure he doesn’t end up six feet under before the trial. He needs to make sure Malfoy gets up on that stand and tells the Wizengamot everything they need to put them all away, to end the Family’s reign and send them where they belong.
,” Malfoy laughs, his fringe falling into his eyes. “Does the male form make you uncomfortable, Auror Potter?” he asks, biting his lower lip. “Or is it the opposite? Do you like what you’re seeing?”
“My mum is looking for my little brother, he got lost again,” the girl sighs, leaning on the backrest. “I’m supposed to ‘wait here, not go anywhere, and stay out of trouble,’” she recites in a tiny, bored voice that makes Harry chuckle. He has heard that one too many times in his life.
They had nowhere else to go, in every sense of the word. No vaults, no shelters, no basements or secret passages they could hide in, not a Protego in the world was strong enough to shield them from that force, one that wipes out everything it meets. There was nowhere to Apparate, no way to predict a safe destination, no clue as to where they could go. The wizarding world was out of the question as well—those bridges were burned a long time ago, when Harry snatched Draco out of its tightening, post-war grip, never to be seen again.
. His first name coming out of that mouth must have sounded like the filthiest come-on because five minutes later, Draco was devouring Potter against the railing, licking up the thick tendon in his neck, and Potter, face flushed, eyes nearly black, was asking if Draco wanted to go somewhere more private.
There’s a subtle, simmering anger lacing Draco’s every move—it turns his kisses more biting, drives him to desperately rock his hips in harsh, stuttered jerks, goading Harry to be more forceful. And while Harry’s self-control keeps that force at bay, just like it kept him from simply mounting Draco right where he stood so many times, his swelling arousal is making him erratic, rushing to explore Draco’s body while it’s his for the taking.
They’re standing on a desolate beach in darkness; tall, spiking cliffs loom over them like hellish gargoyles and the only source of scant light is the waxing moon, fully visible in the cloudless velvet of the sky. The torrential roars of the storm are gone leaving Harry’s ears ringing with just the waves rhythmically clashing with the shore—he must have taken them several miles along the coast, away from all the tempest. He combs his wet curls out of his eyes, casting a small cleaning charm on his glasses. The little beach must be inaccessible to the public—there’s no rubbish lying around, no sign that any Muggles ever wander here, only flotsam littering the shore and filling the air with the smell of seaweed and dead fish.
“That this”—he thrusts his hips sharply, making Harry cry out.—“is reckless— another thrust, their cocks sliding together hotly—“ill-advised—ah!” He presses his forehead against Harry’s, biting his lower lip. “Completely unprofessional,” Draco whispers and leans over to the nightstand where Harry’s wand is lying.
Harry has trouble falling asleep that night. He can’t stop thinking about what Draco said and how he looked at him, trying to decipher all his little tells and what they meant. But more importantly, Harry can’t help but think about the things Draco didn’t say—the things lurking behind subdued smiles stifled with subtle coughs, hidden in those strange, somber glances. He thinks about the date tomorrow, and the things Draco said about Daniel. After some substantial tossing and turning, Harry finds himself annoyed with Draco, with that presumptuousness making him say things he’s convinced Harry wants to hear.
The silence between them stretches but it’s not uncomfortable; Draco stares at him and Harry’s a little dizzy with the emotion rumbling behind Draco’s steel gaze. “Yeah. Yeah, okay,” he whispers.
“We could get in a lot of trouble,” Draco says weakly, already knowing trouble can go fuck itself it it means he gets to do this.
“Oh dear god, you think it’s some sort of a heart-versus-logic scenario,” Draco groans, and Harry laughs.
It dawns on him that what Draco said wasn’t true. There was something very wrong with Daniel and that was the fact that there was absolutely
Draco looks at Luna with a smile. “129 years old, what a ripe age, indeed.” He turns to Harry and nudges the top of his head. “And Ol’ Noseless? He was, like, what? Seventy? I’m sure you could handle a more… refined gentleman.” His voice sounds a little choked and on one hand, Harry grateful for his restraint not to laugh in his face, and on the other, wishes Draco would get it all out of his system already.
“Yeah,” Harry said, picking up the pace, and he pushed Draco forward and face-down on the counter, arse up, and fucked harder into him clenching his teeth from how hard was trying not to come. “Can you come like that?” he asked, finding the thought impossibly hot, the way Draco would keen and arch, and finally give in, admit he fucking likes this, and Harry, and the fact they were actually, unashamedly, and thoroughly enjoying this fuck.
Draco looks at him with pity. “I could have ten and I still wouldn’t be half the animal you are.” Ron laughs and flips him two fingers.
Draco lowered himself onto the bed as soon as possible, not bothering to hide his rush. Their collective moan at the skin-to-skin contact was muffled by hungry mouths and a thick canopy of feather and muscle poised over Draco’s back in a severe arch. Oil was slowly trickling down his flanks, in the valleys between his ribs, leaving a glossy curve over his iliac crest.
Draco would hate it, Harry thinks, if he told him, really, how careful he’s being. How he can’t help but treat him like the finest china that would shatter with one false move. And it’s not because Draco is a wilting, delicate flower, too fragile to grab, to push, to
He fell onto the sheets, elbows digging into the cotton, breathing heavily with his face in his hands. Harry’s heart was just about to jump out of his throat at the knowledge that he hurt Draco, that he did something he maybe shouldn’t have. The wings were shaking, curling inwards, undulating in irregular shivers as Draco tried to regain control. Pellucid oil was now freely trickling down the ridges of his spine, down, and down, pooling in the dimples at the base of Draco’s back.
“Malfoy,” Harry cuts him off. “Those are the conditions and they’re not up for discussion. We’re doing you a huge favour here so you can either take it or leave it,” Harry says in a final tone.
Harry just scoffs, not really keen on telling Ron and Hermione about the voice thing. If George and Angelina are happy with their babysitter, Harry’s not going to have a hand in her losing her job. Not that they would fire her, but better safe than sorry.
“Good boy,” Harry says and Teddy whimpers softly. “I know what you want. You beg so sweetly, you’ll get whatever you want.”
“Not for another year or so.” Draco searches his face and shakes his head with a smile. “Potter, I knew I was gay since I was ten years old. I saw a Quidditch magazine with a Stuart Partridge spread, you know, the one that used to play Chaser for Puddlemere?”
Harry drags his hand over his face. “It’s a long story,” he mutters. “It came out during the whole Zabini thing.”
Harry wondered if being dead would always feel cold, and dark, and so scary he couldn’t breathe, but he supposed if Draco wasn’t going to be there with him, it didn’t matter either way.
“I need to mend your ribs, arsehole,” Harry says matter-of-factly. “Can’t imagine how you even breathed. I’ve had a few broken myself, and it sucks.”
The cool, black silk made him shiver on contact as he took himself into his hand and let out a breath he felt he’d been holding at least all day, if not for longer, much longer than he’d care to admit. His thoughts immediately centred on Potter as his wrist moved in a steady rhythm, squeezing and twisting on every upstroke, his chest rising and falling rapidly, faster, higher, in tandem with the arousal unfurling at his very core. With his other hand clutching the sheets, Draco brought himself off to memories from two years ago, blurred and intertwined between images of Harry now, of his watchful glances and lingering hands, and his sandalwood scent, just as sweet and heady as Draco remembered.
“I was the informant, true,” Robards says, shrugging, his wand still raised. “But there can be no betrayal if the fight is for a different cause.”
“He’s not cheap, but I think he might be what you’re looking for. His pavlova is to die for,” he adds with a dreamy note to his voice and Harry bites down a smile at the git’s unconditional love for everything sweet.
“What…” Malfoy breathes, staring at Harry like he sprouted a second head. He’s quiet for a while and Harry lets him process it all—Merlin knows he’s going to need some time as well. “
Malfoy looks at him with an open mouth, slowly shaking his head. “Potter, I do hope you’re aware we’re
Harry orders their drinks and pays—a beer for himself, a glass of whiskey for Draco—and they take a seat in one of the booths. Harry chooses it carefully—not too deep inside, well-concealed in the shadows, with a clear view of the entrance and most of the patrons. It’s increasingly surreal with every second they sit there and Harry watches Draco opposite him, sipping his whiskey and regarding him with a soft, curious glance.
“A… man came to the bullpen this morning. Says he’s with the Family,” Kingsley says cryptically and Harry’s coffee is immediately forgotten.
Harry freezes. What does Draco have to do with anything here? His heart beats a little faster at Luna’s comment and that’s just ridiculous. Does it matter if the bloke looks like Draco?
Harry snorted a soft laugh. “Right, a tenant. A gorgeous,” he kissed the side of Draco’s neck, “mysterious,” another kiss, going up, sealing every word with a brush of lips, “brilliant tennant,” he purred, earning a pleased hum from Draco. “Whom I love,” Harry whispered and spun him around to finally capture his lips.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked and his voice was something else, and Harry suddenly felt nervous so he took a step closer, trying to look as cocky as people tended to think he was. He reached out and ruffled Draco’s hair, messing up his perfectly coiffed fringe.
Draco Malfoy sucks cock just like he argues—once he manages to surprise Harry, he goes all in, with predator-like efficiency, stripping Harry of all his defences and inhibitions. And just like with arguing, swallowing Harry down isn’t some unconscious, natural thing, it’s an
Draco stares at him like he hung the stars and Harry’s stomach flutters like it’s made of butterflies. Finally, the crease is gone and Dracos’ lips curve in a small smile. “They’re going to lose their minds, you know.”
Kingsley casts a quick look at Robards who’s examining his nails way too attentively to ever be believable, leaving the talking to the commander-in-chief. The Minister’s eyes darken. “You might be—” Shacklebolt clears his throat. “You might be
His idiotic heart sped up a bit but Harry squashed the feeling down as worry slowly crept in—in the last six months, Draco had adamantly refused to see anyone during his heats, least of all Harry. During his… time off (Harry had once, erroneously, called it
“Fuck,” he whimpers, “fuck you’re—so big—god, Potter—” Draco babbles, leaning his sweaty forehead on the headboard.
our Concealers down,” he says seriously, a smile tugging at his lips. He fumbles with Draco’s belt with his free hand and Draco inhales sharply through his nose when his cock springs free from his open flies. Potter’s smiles like the Devil himself while still managing to make it look innocent. It never fails to get Draco’s cock wet. “And I’m too turned on to focus on a third.”
“Well I’m not coughing up blood anymore so that’s an upside,” he says testily, and Harry squirms on the bench, guilt clutching heavy at his lungs. “Cunning fuckers, they left the face intact so nobody saw.”
The rooms are upstairs, accessed from an outside terrace with rusty metal railings and old lamps filled with dead flies. There’s a snack machine two doors down from their room and Harry spots Malfoy eyeing the skittles and rolos behind the glass. Harry checks the room number on the door with the one attached to their key and hysterically mourns that for seventeen years, he has successfully avoided rooming with Draco Malfoy only to now share a dingy hotel room while making sure the tosser doesn’t get murdered.
“Someone might come in,” Draco says weakly, a little impatient, already feeling his short-lived, stony resolve going all down to harden his treacherous cock.
He thinks about Daniel’s kindness, about how amiable he is, and finds himself wanting more than that, Daniel is lacking the balance Harry so desperately needs, the riveting, electrifying push-and-pull he thrives on, the stir of fire deep in his belly, the intoxicating, drunk feeling of being alive, making mistakes, and coming home.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything for a second, taking a sip instead. “Figures? Know me that well, do you?” he asks wryly.
against his skin. And while he can see the allure, Draco engaging into situations like that makes his stomach churn.
The man traces the tip of his nose along the tendon under Draco’s ear. And then, he places a soft kiss to the side of Draco’s neck.
Malfoy’s face is flushed with agitation even from a distance. “Blaise, trust me when I say this, Potter is the only good one in a basket of spoiled eggs. He’s— He’s different. That’s why I went to him.”
Something ugly wraps its fist around Harry’s stomach and he closes his eyes for a second. “Are you sure— This isn’t what you need right now. I know you’re feeling—”
“Duly noted, you git,” Harry says, quiet and private. He files the information away, puts it in a little drawer labelled
Draco turned in his embrace, facing the television and laying his head on Harry’s chest. Harry planted a few more kisses to his messy blond fringe.
“Spread me,” Harry says like he’s asking Draco to pass the bloody salt, and Draco helplessly obliges, and holds his cheeks apart as Harry lifts himself up a little higher and reaches behind him to line up Draco’s cock.
—his left thigh swells and bleeds as the spell slashes and grinds his flesh deep enough to send him stumbling to the ground with a hoarse scream. With two opponents left, they divide and conquer—Harry tries to disarm a muscular man with an impressive moustache who’s sending enchanted scimitars his way, slashing the air with a metallic whirl. Malfoy takes on the last one—and it’s a woman, with cropped, ginger hair and tattoos on her neck—who fires nasty Dismembering Curses one after another.
After a while, he gently disentangles himself from Draco, sits on his haunches, and starts unbuttoning his own shirt.
“All right. Just— Wait. Everyone, wait,” he says, watching the group with a strange intensity and zoning in on Draco and Harry. “Just, please— Tell me: did you lot know about this?” He wiggles a finger between the two of them, looking at his fiancee almost pleadingly.
Draco didn’t answer, still struggling to slow down his breathing, curled up in front of Harry, his fingers tangled between platinum locks.
He goes out with Daniel after getting a few extra hours of sleep in the afternoon and it’s just as Draco said it would be—absolutely perfect.
They’re so close their lips are almost touching. When Draco finally speaks, it’s a warm breeze laced with unspoken danger, low and quiet. “I need you to set me on fire.”
Harry follows Draco’s line of sight, admiring the attraction. It’s a vintage one—not like the London Eye, with its modern, alien-looking capsules, shiny glass and chrome steel. The Ferris wheel at this small town fair must have been assembled overnight; the seats have red leather upholstery encased in ornate wooden frames that remind Harry of an old circus from black and white movies he'd watched since he got a TV at Grimmauld. There are buzzing yellow and red lights lined around the base and cheery, old-timey music is playing somewhere in the background. He’s secretly glad Draco’s knowledge of Muggle engineering is scarce enough that he doesn’t question the technical condition of the wheel that has most definitely seen better days.
“So you want me to believe you just brought all this”—he waves the folder between them—“here out of—what?—the kindness of your heart?”
Draco buried his face in Harry’s shirt but tried to push him away at the same time, shaking uncontrollably and slowly letting his tears fall. The echo of the siren still rang in Harry’s ears as he looked down at Draco, wanting nothing more than to make everything go away.
Draco moves away and leans back in his chair. Harry follows him with his eyes and it has to be enough, his small smile and a glass of water have to suffice in showing Draco how much Harry appreciates him.
“I don’t like the sound of that, if you can believe it,” Draco sniffs, pursing his lips. “Is this really necessary?”
“You’re spiralling,” Draco says calmly, the tiny crease between his eyebrows betraying his calm facade. “What are you thinking?”
With that said, Potter Vanishes all of his own clothes and they both groan as the hard ridges of their cocks rub between their stomachs.
Draco sighs, absently kissing Harry’s finger pad as he traces it over his lips. “Potter, I’m not what you want me to be, or rather what you think I might secretly be,” he says amusedly, but there’s an underlying anxiety in the way he chooses his next words. “And while I am capable of change, I might never become that, not fully.”
The hand disappears, a little too fast to be casual. “Give yourself some time,” Draco says softly. “It’s not some ridiculous initiation into the world of people who shag, it’s just a stupid concept. You’ll know when it’s right.”
“And you found that out before or after he was all over you?” He scoffs. “Do you even realise he could have—”
“Here’s Daniel’s details, I’ll have him owl you,” Ginny says, pushing a small business card into Harry’s hand. “Bye!”
Harry frowns, feeling his curiosity spike again. “Want to tell me that story?” he asks carefully, quietly, taking an unfair advantage of the little moment of calm before the inevitable storm, no matter what happens tomorrow.
to babysit?! And we’re related by blood!” If there’s a little bit of hurt in his voice, Harry chooses not to address it for now, focusing on Draco’s childish ‘
Draco looked, for lack of a better word, completely debauched. His chest was blotted with a gorgeous pink flush, hair in disarray, and his lower lip was red and spit-slick so he must have been worrying it under his teeth for some time now. The whole look made Harry dig his fingers into his thighs.
“Draco,” he says softly, returning the tentative touch, and he hears Draco’s breath hitch. “I was an idiot, you see. I was looking, and looking, for Merlin knows what, going on all those ridiculous dates,” Harry huffs. “And there was something wrong with every single person. And I thought maybe there’s just something wrong with me—”
“Draco. I don’t want—porridge. I don’t want perfect—I don’t want good and safe—I—I want to buy you stupid brioches—I want it all—the movie nights—the snobby wines—the scars and—”
“Weasley— just,” Draco clenches his hand into a fist. “Hold on to this woman? Hold on to her tight.”
“Harry, Draco!” Hermione, ever the mum of the group, rolls her eyes at their antics. “Honestly, it’s like your thirteen again,” she shakes her head with a fond smile.
“Salazar, even washing our bloody undergarments must take place under the thick blanket of the night, mustn’t it?”
Malfoy takes a look around, probably feeling they’re close. He raises a cheeky brow at Harry. “Any orders?”
Draco chuckles, swirling the wine in his glass. "I suppose that person is all of those things. But I'd like to think they're not only that."
He sees them through the large front window, hunched at a table in the very corner; it’s a smart move, he has to give them that—he wouldn’t have paid any attention if he didn’t know who he was looking for. Malfoy suddenly leans back and Harry finally recognises his companion—Blaise Zabini. He curses under his breath, trying to recall seeing the name in the Family’s files as several worst-case scenarios flash through his head. His instincts tell him to barge in there, wand blazing, Obliviate Zabini and drag Malfoy out by the scruff of his neck—what the fuck is he thinking? However, years of Auror work and a certain level of restraint Harry discovered he had developed with age stop him dead in his tracks. Seeing as Zabini isn’t exactly killing Malfoy, Harry decides to find a good vantage point, which ends up being an empty bench across the street and, with curiosity sparkling down his back, fully focuses on the monitoring spell Malfoy has clearly forgotten about.
“Ah, yes! Well,” he says and pauses, regarding Harry with unrestrained fascination. “Trust is a peculiar thing, isn’t it? I trust you’ll tell the truth, however uncomfortable it may be, yet…”
Draco means and he’s not sure if it’s the haze of arousal or the fact that the longer they do this, the more certain Harry is he’s been in love with Draco for longer than he’d anticipated, but Harry knows he wants it. Wants it to be Draco. And it’s not some bullshit about flowers or initiations—Harry wants him, wants his heart and his body, wants Draco to do all those things to him, and wants to wake up next to him and do it all over again.
“Ah, yes, all work, no play,” he gestures vaguely. “And yet, you’re not as dull as I thought, Potter.”
There’s one more thing in the room that Harry notices, and quickly looks away, feeling his face burn. A large mirror on the ceiling, directly over the bed; he’s not sure if it’s a standard in honeymoon suites in general, or if just this one was designed specifically to give him a half-hard-on just thinking about what they could do with that. To the side, Draco quietly looks around and doesn’t say a word about it, which only further flusters Harry, who’s now wondering if he noticed, what he’s thinking, and why he’s not saying anything.
“And I,” Draco hesitated but saw something (again, hypothetical) in Harry’s face. “I would wrap my legs around you.” And he did just that, in one swift move, pulling Harry closer with just his calves and Harry felt those long legs could wrap around him tenfold, squeeze all reservation out of him if Draco allowed it. “And. And—”
, you’re incredible, let go for me,” he urges him on and Harry feels the wet head of Draco’s cock as he presses it against his thigh, and it’s so
If any of the witches and wizards rushing chaotically around the building had ever bothered to learn about the non-magical world, they would have realised the dashing stranger is wearing the material equivalent of three months’ worth of their salary. But even those ignorant of Muggle fashion houses can’t help but cast a furtive glance at the man’s lissome form, and some look around in confusion as the heady smell of quality cologne reaches their nose seconds after he has passed. Most, however, just get out of his way on instinct, only half-aware of the raw, alluring power he seems to carry as naturally as he breathes.
Harry just stares, helplessly, with his mouth open, and thrusts shallowly into Draco’s hand closed around both their cocks.
Eventually, not much is said at all, not after Draco invites himself into Harry’s shower and then proceeds to take him apart piece by piece, moving them onto the bed afterwards. They end up thoroughly christening the room, with Draco in his lap, chest-to-chest, his long legs wrapped around Harry’s waist, as they slowly rock back and forth with Harry’s cock buried deep inside Draco. They collapse to sleep hours later, sweaty and worn out, with angry red scratch marks still hot across their backs. The bloody ceiling mirror remains unmentioned.
“Hi!” He says, his voice way too high to sound normal, confirmed by the barista’s brows riding a little higher up his forehead. “I’m— Uh, just. Just looking around.”
something he won’t be able to come back from. All those plans quickly go out the window though, when after such a long time of abstinence, Harry feels a pleasant buzz extending at the edges of his vision in soft bursts after only two shots, and instead of taking it slow, he decides to celebrate the feeling with two more to reach that blissful, longed-for numbness.
“I think it was magic,” the kid says in a small voice, as if she’s been told it’s impossible far too many times, taking the leap and telling one more person about it, hoping they’ll hear her out.
Harry wants to melt into him. His throat is sore, there are tears in the corners of his eyes, and Harry is so in love he could die.
Suddenly, he notices a figure at one of the tables, at the very far corner of the large room. Sitting by a white oak bookshelf is a man, hunched over a newspaper. He’s clearly a wizard—he’s wearing a set of day robes that Harry would normally categorise as ‘completely outrageous’ but he sets the thought aside, seeing that the man is a friend of Luna's. There’s a flash of a pair of shiny dragonhide boots under the table and a checkered flat cap on his head. Only when Harry squints a little, his eyes still adjusting to the dimly lit interior, he notices the man is holding a magnifying glass, hovering it so close to the paper he’s reading, he grazes the tip of his crooked nose with every turn of a page.
Aside from that single instance, he doesn’t speak with anyone else but still effortlessly maintains the impression of someone with a natural posh drawl, quick as lightning and sharp as a needle, had he chosen to say something. If anyone watched him closely, perhaps they would catch him casting a quick glance at a young male intern bending down to pick up some papers scattered across the floor, where he dropped them after colliding with an angry-looking solicitor. Perhaps they would even notice a barely-there smirk, quickly replaced by stony, determined indifference as he proceeds to the elevators, looking at the guest badge with slight disdain as he slides it into the inside pocket of his suit jacket.
They moved to Draco’s bedroom solely for the sitting space Draco’s king-sized bed was able to provide. Harry was finding it increasingly difficult to keep his hands from shaking—he was going to touch Draco’s wings,
“He stole my phone,” Ron says, disbelieving, as he takes a grave gulp of coffee. “I… I had no idea, mate. It was in my desk, I always kept it at work and he must have been snooping—”
The calm before the, quite literal, storm lasts for a whole three weeks, full of watchful curiosity and small kindnesses stuffed between heaps of mockery and exasperation. They’re at their third hotel, somewhere further in the North; the air is imbued with salt and stone as a storm brews over the inky expanse of the sea. Sharp, cold rain still lashes their faces and shoulders with every gust of wind, even with the
As soon as Harry steps into the Minister’s office, Kingsley and Robards nearly jump out of their seats, clearly displeased with being told to wait in the corner like a bunch of children. The report he gives is succinct and pointed with a slam of Malfoy’s file on Kingsley’s desk.
They’re getting closer and Malfoy can now hear them too. There are voices, two, no, three men. They’re close. Harry activates the Portkey and holds it out.
“And I don’t wonder anymore—now, I know. Such a waste, to put you in Gryffindor,” Draco clicks his tongue.
“You’re not a child, so I’m not going to tell you to take a nap,” Malfoy says, sitting up, always ready to have some fun at Harry’s expense. “We just ate, so it can’t be hungry-moody— Although the food so far has been substandard at best,” he adds with a smirk, apparently unable to stop himself. Harry’s jaw clenches and a small part of him wants his suspicions to be true. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d just recommend a proper wank—how long has it been, Auror Potter?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, tapping his lower lip with a slender finger, and Harry doesn’t plan on giving him one. “Would you say that it helps? I, for one, find the act soothing, when all is said and done, don’t you think?” His white teeth flash in a teasing grin. “Of course, I usually have someone on hand, some pretty thing that’s willing to help me out—”
is what it should feel like. It feels like falling, or more like the moment right before hitting the ground, extended in time—all air is gone from his lungs, his body weightless.
Harry would be lying if he said things were perfectly normal or uneventful, even eight years after the War. Apparently, the Wizarding World is more sentimental than anyone would have guessed—he’s still haunted by reporters who never falter in coming up with outlandish theories about his private life, his friends, his clothes, and even his non-existent exercise regime, eagerly pointing out the apparently
“Mm,” Harry nodded against his scalp and tightened his hold around Draco’s waist for one more second. He was almost painfully hard, having slowly rutted against Draco’s thigh for the past ten minutes, felt his cock heavy and sticky in his pants. “Want you.”
“You want to know how it went? Living with Muggles?” Harry growls, unwilling to discuss Lucius Malfoy of all people. “I didn’t eat, not proper meals. I didn’t sleep in a bed, I had a cupboard. I didn’t get clothes, only hand-me-downs. I only got glasses because a teacher at the Muggle school I went to noticed I needed them, I—” He exhales. “I’m not saying growing up with Lucius must have been a picnic—”
Harry turns his head to see Hermione exclaim in triumph as she crouches on the carpet, wrenching out a thick binder, adorned with numerous colourful bookmarks, leaflets, and ribbons, from under the sofa. “Yeah, that’s fair.”
Roughly thirty-five minutes later, Draco was balls deep inside a moaning, sweat-drenched Potter, after barely having made it through a rushed drink.
he didn’t want to hear, lingering at the edges of his strength, and wondered if Draco was the strong one all along, if that song was coming from Harry’s bleeding soul.
Harry was quiet for a while, murmuring ominous incantations and taking notes in his file every two spells or so. He was using a Muggle pen and Draco was briefly distracted thinking about how stupid some wizarding quirks and traditions were. “You’re doing something good here,” Harry finally said, looking up and down Draco’s body splayed in the chair. It made his skin tingle, eliciting an obstinate itch to either spread his legs a little wider or cover himself from head to toe. Anything, really, to make something happen.
Everything feels like an out of body experience. It’s barely midday and Harry has trouble connecting the dots between waking up next Draco who was warm, naked, and who smiled as Harry kissed him good morning, and whatever purgatory nightmare he’s in now. Draco—bleeding out onto a marble floor; Draco asking Harry unbelievable, absurd questions; Draco, who Harry thinks he might be in love with.
The kiss was irregular, broken and renewed with a shifting kind of energy each time they dove back in, like the Autumn weather outside; in was the sun, warm and careful, unsure if it was welcome, then out, and then back again was a thunderstorm, cold, wet lips and a biting lash of electricity down Harry’s back, all the way to the tips of his toes.
going to the Aurors’ office, you’re going to a secure location until I know exactly what’s going on,” Harry says, already seeing Draco’s pale eyebrows ride up his forehead.
and bore the stinger scar to this day), he’d always barricaded himself in his flat and came back to work three days later as if nothing happened.
“Fuck, Draco.” He moves closer to him on the couch and Draco nearly recoils, it looks like he’s nearly forcing himself to stay put, and Harry’s heart breaks a little. “Have you gone mad? I’m the one who should be apologising,” Harry says and he’s angry, at himself, at his stupid hot-headedness. “Fuck, I was such an arsehole. Everything I did I— I had no idea. And all this time—
“That’s why Potter’s here,” says Malfoy with a strange expression. “But what really intrigues me is—why are
“Like that,” Harry said quietly, looking at Draco’s parted lips. “That’s what I would do.” Slowly, he undid one more button on Draco’s shirt, revealing a pointy collarbone and the sharp tip of a faded, silvery scar. Harry wanted to cut his tongue on it. “And this. And I would—” Harry slid the tip of his index finger up Draco’s neck, pressed it into the dip of his pulse point and traced it up a bit, stopping under his ear. “Leave a mark. Here.”
“I missed you,” Harry says in a low voice; Draco would laugh it off if he only didn’t feel exactly the same. Last night was nowhere near enough, he thinks, perhaps no amount of nights with Harry will ever be enough.
“Hermione, I am disappointed in you,” Harry looks at her with mock scandal, unable to lace any malice into his tone. He doesn’t really mind talking about it. The ‘thinking about it before sleep’ part is the hard one.
He thinks about the time Draco found some old tomes that turned out to be dark spellbooks; they probably belonged to Sirius’ ancestors and the horrifying curses they found inside were dangerous enough for them to decide to return the books to the Ministry. Harry took them in on the next day and got the dressing-down of the century from Robards for just throwing the tomes in his satchel, and then a second one from Draco for the exact same thing (they already touched them at home, it’s not like they were cursed). There was also a time Draco found a book on Black ancestry, hidden in a secret compartment in one the many bookshelves of Twelve Grimmauld Place. They studied it until wee hours of the morning, both eager to learn—Draco being his mother’s son and Harry being Sirius’ godson and the master of his house. The one tome they didn’t discuss too much—or look each other in the eye for two hours after spelling it open—was a small book in a golden cover, depicting a plethora of sexual positions and practices that should make any respected pure-blood clutch their pearls in justified indignation. With the tips of his ears burning red, Draco croakily explained that such guides were a common occurrence back in the day, especially in the high society, and they left it at that.
“Before you have a meltdown,” Malfoy says with an eye roll. “One: there are no magical regulations against Muggle firearms, did you know?” he asks excitedly. “Two: while I may not be an expert on
Harry bites his lip. “D’you—” He feels a blush creeping up onto his face. “Do you think I’m nitpicking?”
A few days after the bar fiasco, they move to a new hotel in a town just a bit larger than the last one. The change of scenery does them both good—the room is bigger, more spacious, and there’s a park across the street they make use of from time to time, and slowly but surely, they slip into their usual back-and-forth as if nothing happened. It’s more charged than it used to be, there’s something orbiting between them like an afterthought, but they both do their best to steer around it, enough for Harry to finally feel like he can breathe.
“Shh,” Harry placed his thumb over that beloved lower lip, one he would have never tired of kissing, not in a thousand years, not in a thousand lifetimes. He waved his hand again and their old, dusty gramophone came to life—the last record they had listened to flew onto the turntable and the arm turned, placing the needle just in the right place. The slow, dulcet notes of piano and trumpet sounded in the sunlit space as Draco’s favourite record played with a soft, static crackle. It was Frankie Carle’s
Harry sometimes still thinks about that day. Still thinks about Draco’s detached grace and the sliver of nervousness peeking from behind the polite mask glued to his face. Still thinks about how he was
Harry can already feel static concentrating in the air around Malfoy, the binding spell working just as expected, and the ozone-like smell of magical discharge pushes him a little further over the edge. They don’t have much time left.
Harry lets out a heavy sigh, half-relieved, half-wistful; it ruffles Draco’s hair a bit and he smiles sheepishly. “None, except for the Reparo I had to cast on the vase over there,” Harry points to the nearest bookshelf where a jade green vase stands, inconspicuous and without a trace of any damage. Harry hopes Hermione won’t use any Diagnostic Charms when she gets back.
,” he starts and Harry wants to protest but only clenches his jaw, remembering his own feelings at the time, and bites back the ages-old need to defy Malfoy, as instinctive as breathing.
Harry’s friends were… sceptical about his choice, to say the least. But it soon turned out Malfoy put his money where his mouth was—he turned out to be excellent at his job and with each case he helped them solve, Harry grew more and more curious about the man he had become. Somewhere along the way, Harry started visiting the forensics lab to personally ask for help and Draco, however surprised he looked, always did his best to provide. Slowly but surely, Harry found himself visiting the lab on breaks, just to watch Draco work, or sometimes ask Potions-related questions that always got an answer, no matter how silly they must have been, no matter how busy Draco was. Harry doesn’t remember the first time he dragged Draco out of the stuffy, fume-filled room to get lunch together but suddenly they were actual colleagues and then he called Draco his friend in a conversation or two, earning himself a knowing look from Hermione, and a rather puzzled one from Ron.
Harry can’t bring himself to look at Draco, not now, not when he has just asked a question so personal, Draco would be right to tell him to fuck off and stop sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong. He risks glancing up and sees Draco smile easily, without any awkwardness, and Harry thinks about friendships in American Muggle films, how the characters understand each other without a word, how they tell each other the silliest, deepest, or most private things and how much of that can be translated to him and Draco.
“Are you seriously asking me if I had sex with your sister? What’s wrong with you?” Harry can feel his face must have taken an impressive shade of crimson by now and he’s honestly annoyed—it’s Ron who should feel bad about that question! None of the others, however, share that sentiment, all four of them looking at him as if he were an interesting new species they’re seeing for the first time. A true missing link to society’s endless layers of people who apparently shag each other all the time. Harry sighs. It’s not like it was a real secret to begin with.
of Valentino, this is expensive stuff. And his clothes? Sure, it was jeans and a t-shirt but slightly more high-end if you took a closer look,” Draco explains, giving off the air of a private investigator. Harry rolls his eyes, remembering exactly how close of a look Draco had the opportunity to get.
at antiques, he knew their origins, the materials they were made of, the spells that might have been laced into the objects. At some point, they made a habit out of ending their day in Draco’s study, a large spacious room with two desks where they poured over their respective paperwork in companionable silence.
, one that’s meant to be intimidating, but even his faded Dark Mark looks like a funny skull peeking from under the rolled-up sleeve as it contrasts with his flushed cheeks and tousled hair.
If Pansy weren’t in Paris right now, planning a wedding she didn’t really want, she’d be ransacking his liquor cabinet. Or maybe she’d even go straight for the cellar had it so happened she wasn’t the one to break it off. She’d uncork a dusty bottle of red Pauillac and say something about Draco getting over himself, and Draco would sit on the big barrel in the corner and say something about pots and kettles. They’d get positively trollied and top the evening off with a rancid shot of Sobering Potion before bed, and then Draco would wake up the next morning and call the whole thing off, and keep existing among his numerous treasures, proudly living up to his birth name.
“Really,” Harry rasps, trying to pull him closer, locking his thighs around Draco and feeling his muscles burn.
The man’s features remain predatorily calm as the woman immediately looks up without him even having to clear his throat. He speaks a few quiet words and watches the receptionist hurriedly stamp a visitor’s badge and hold it out to him. Seeing his arched brow, her smile wanes and the woman simply places it onto the mahogany desk, clearly having changed her mind. Gracing her with a polite nod, the man swipes it off and leaves without another word.
Later that night, he still thinks about it as he slowly cards his fingers through Potter’s hair. The man is blissfully asleep and Draco briefly wishes for things to, just this once, stay as they are.
Harry turns around with a flourish, swings his arm, and all air leaves him as he punches Draco square in the jaw with a particularly mean right hook. Draco stumbles once again, and Harry swears he sees a drop of blood splatter off to the side when he throws the punch. His suspicions are confirmed when Draco straightens and there’s a narrow trickle of bright-red blood at the corner of his mouth.
—you have to answer honestly. On my part, I can assure you I’m not interested in your secret Auror base where you breed new generation soldiers, or anything like that—”
“You mean, like, hallucinations?” Harry’s heart is hammering in his chest, immediately wondering what it would smell like to him, what that smell would make him see. He feels almost sick, with fear, with the knowledge that if he just opened one of those vials, he would know. He would maybe have an idea, a turning point which he could go from, pointed in the right direction. His stomach sinks at the persistent thought that he could also feel nothing, see nothing, he could get physical evidence of something Harry’s been scared of his entire life.
Things between them shift ever so slightly after that day. They learn each other as if they never met before and at times, it feels like sailing in the night with no lighthouses on the horizon, just following one will-o'-the-wisp after another in circles, impatient and hesitant about what they’ll find when they inevitably clash.
Draco pipes up at that on instinct, but Harry shushes him. “But that wasn’t the case, at least not entirely. I was too stupid, too… blind to see,” Harry takes a long, uneven breath and isn’t sure he’s brave enough to say it. He’s scared and excited and only finds the bravery to continue because of the way Draco is looking at him. “That I already had someone perfect right before my eyes. All this time, Draco.”
It’s an unspoken rule. They don’t disturb the tension-ridden bubble they have both inadvertently stuck themselves in, walking in circles along its delicate walls, careful not to break that imperceptible balance. It didn’t become a habit as much as an unspoken prompt; evident in a single glance, an off-hand joke, or a momentary pause between one of them putting their hand on the bathroom door handle and actually pressing it. It could have been Harry’s imagination but he is almost certain Draco has picked up on every single one of those signals, as there is something daring in his nightly activities when the temptation becomes too much for Harry not to indulge. Just like with most things that Draco does, he puts on
oh my god, ahhh!” Harry whines, as his cock twitches and he bites down on the pillow he’s lying on, and twists his fingers into the fabric not to touch himself right now. The unbearable drag of pleasure is just too good, he wants it to last, wants Draco to keep fingering and stretching him until he can take his cock and they can come together and Harry’s adamant to hold it in just a little bit longer.
The chair didn’t even creak, holding the weight of two grown men with the help of some hefty magic, and Draco picked up the pace, fucking into Harry fast and hard, holding him by the ribs and revelling in the wet, slapping sounds of flesh against flesh. They didn’t really need any extra lubrication—Harry was already all wet with his saliva, and Draco’s cock had been leaking since they started rutting on the couch, and it only added an extra edge to the fucking, an
“All right, all right,” he says and wraps an arm around Harry’s shoulders. Heavy, comforting, grounding. “But don’t be, though. It’s forgotten.”
“Sir,” Harry breathes, jogging up to him. “Where is everyone? I can’t reach Ron, and what’s with this maintenance—”
It’s all Harry needs to let go completely, to fold Draco into a bone-crushing embrace and thrust his hips once, twice, and then he’s coming, his bollocks tight against Draco’s arse, cock buried deep inside him as Harry pumps Draco full of his come. Draco follows seconds later, shooting white stripes all over the headboard, some of it dripping down Harry’s fingers.
Draco takes a grave gulp of his wine, trying really hard not to burst out laughing. He can’t say anything yet, he wouldn’t take away the opportunity from Harry, to see their friends’ faces. There’s also a small part of him that’s terrified Harry’s not going to show up because he has changed his mind about everything in the last hour, but Draco likes to be a rational man in most situations. Even though discovering that his years-long infatuation with the Prat who Lived is very much mutual could not, by any standards, be considered ‘most situations’. He absently wonders if all the sex they had in the last sixteen-or-so hours has anything to do with his absent-mindedness. The mindblowing, toe-curling, heartstopping sex with the man he’s so in love with, it might honestly kill him one day. In moments like this, Draco curses his light complexion because he’s quite certain his face is now the colour of the Hogwarts Express. He fiddles with the top button of his shirt and feels a sting of pain from what Draco knows is a large purplish love bite, courtesy of Harry. The ones above the collar are all Glamoured—Draco wouldn’t dream of getting rid of them for reasons he can’t quite put a name to, he just knows his stomach flutters at the very memory of Harry’s lips latched onto his neck. And many other places, too.
“The Minister isn’t coming. We’re just waiting on a few more friends,” Robards says in a blank voice.
Draco’s cheeks flush an impressive shade of Gryffindor crimson and Harry suddenly has an urge to ruffle his hair. Instead, he smiles.
