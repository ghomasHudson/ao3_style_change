There was a disjointed series of knocks on his door.
“Hush. I need a nap.”
“Malfoy.”
“No problem, Harry.”
Potter yawned, covering his mouth. He blinked a few times, his eyes remaining on Draco. “I might as well get it out the way now.”
“You’re really fucking smitten, aren’t you? Oh Merlin—” She jumped excitedly in her seat. “Please tell me that’s why you tormented Harry for so many years? Because you
Potter said nothing as Draco set to work, racking his brain for a number of spells that might make the link if he could manipulate them enough to give him the parameters he wanted. He whispered them, following through with minute movements of his wand.
It was hardly a one-sided infatuation.
So, he ambled into his kitchen that morning, a little less put together than usual. He was dressed, of course, his hair brushed back enough, his tie wiggled into place, but there was Potter, sat at the table, and Draco was starkly aware of the slouch of his own shoulders and the frown on his lips. Potter didn’t seem to notice, a hand tugging at his own hair, as he stirred a steaming cup of tea.
? The remaining magic is so old that it’s essentially useless!”
Draco reminded himself of that simple fact as the man himself came sauntering into the office. He might as well have been carrying the decapitated head of the next evil tyrant, for the entire office jumped to its feet with a raucous cheer. Even the bloody portraits were saluting Potter. Draco scowled.
Potter was on his doorstep, swaying dangerously close to the steps, his attention drawn to the few plants that dangled around the entrance. He looked heavily intoxicated: the shaking, the dazed expression, the smell.
“Don’t lecture me, Potter.” Draco rolled his hands into fists and crossed his arms.
Draco pulled him closer until his hair tickled Draco’s neck and his body didn’t end where Draco’s began. The covers tugged themselves free from beneath them, only to lay across the two men. It became their personal bubble of warmth and safety, and the sunlight danced across the ceiling for Draco as he pressed a kiss to the top of Harry’s head.
Fuck professionalism.
“What did Granger say?” Draco asked, ignoring his question and the offering of warm hands. Draco pulled his blanket tighter around himself. “She saw us last night.”
From an outsider’s perspective, it seemed completely random. There was no well-known correlation between the two forests, at least nothing that jumped to mind. They both had trees and dog walkers and… the same natural magic that vibrated through all forests of the world. Could this be related to the runic symbols and that ancient form of magic? Draco could only guess at this stage.
Now, he wished Potter wouldn’t look away so quickly. He would change that, even if lying became useful tool.
Draco picked it up, metaphorically, and lifted his chin. “Don’t worry about that, Potter. Fletcher and I are as clean as they come.”
“It’s a shame he’s no longer around to keep your prospective husbands at bay then. Isn’t it?” Fletcher swiped back, not bothering to hide the glee she garnered from a swift back and forth.
“Right. Perfect.”
Suddenly, Fletcher’s concoction seemed twice as appetising.
“Surely there are better ways to approach this ridiculous search than this? What’s that muggle phrase…? We’re looking for a needle in a 300 square mile national park.”
“I almost got into three car crashes just trying to get here, Malfoy – none of which were caused by my driving. If you’d seen that, I think you would’ve jumped out the window by now.” Potter responded, not taking his eyes off the road.
He pronounced it painstakingly slowly, like a child toying with a new word.
, you can hardly stay on my doorstep.” Draco said, “Do you have someone who can—?”
Perhaps, their minds were under-developed. There was always the possibility they’d been raised in the wild, or perhaps they had learning difficulties. But why had they gathered together? The elder members - which Draco now classified as those with seemingly matured minds – showed signs of having lived in the urban world. When he raised his points to Potter and Fletcher, they only came up with the same possible conclusions.
One night, Draco tiptoed across his room at 12:08 am. His fingers wrapped around the cold doorknob and tugged, wincing as the hinges betrayed him, creaking. Harry was on the other side. He stopped Draco with a hand simply pressed flat against the door. And with bleary eyes, he stepped into the room, hooked Draco’s wrist into his grip and led Draco back to his bed.
“We should stay past sunset tomorrow to observe. Fletcher says the surveillance spells would flag any dark magic but maybe the group is discussing something or…” Potter yawned uncontrollably, his face scrunching up as he brought a hand to cover it. “—er, plotting…”
Potter sighed. “What do you want me to tell you? You saw it for yourself; he has the development level of a young child, perhaps a five-year-old.”
Weasley had never quite deserved Harry. Draco knew that much.
away, and Potter had brought this… thing?
A glance backwards showed Fletcher staring out the window with wide eyes. Draco considered that he had never asked where Fletcher grew up and judging by her reaction, it hadn’t been in the countryside like Draco’s upbringing. Although, it hadn’t quite been the true countryside, rather a large estate to roam.
Although, there was a difference. Draco was feeling something he hadn’t felt for a long time, something he couldn’t place.
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Potter said once he’d returned, taking the large step up into the driver’s seat. “Here.”
“I saw it on the internet, so yes, I believe so.” She grinned, nudging him and his coffee cup.
A nearby rustle snagged his attention. Draco paused, looking west as the other two continued onward. He frowned, categorising it as wildlife, and turned to catch up.
The kind of conversation that didn’t revolve around insults or work, the war or their regrets. It was ordinary. He asked about Draco’s weekend plans, his interests, his friends, and for what it was worth, Draco replied without objection. Words didn’t get stuck in his throat and the world didn’t seem so dark when he talked, when he had a foot in Potter’s universe.
Potter was back the following evening, dressed in ridiculous muggle pyjamas with yellow bears printed on the bottoms. Draco cast a disgusted look at them before the blanket hid them from view. Potter said nothing. And Draco resisted the temptation to fall asleep there and then.
“It’s been five fucking years since the end of the war, you know?” Draco continued with indignation as Fletcher fixed him with a pained expression, which read ‘
“Right, let’s go then.”
By the time they made it back to the group’s campsite, it was abandoned. Besides, a few dead carcasses were scattered around the fire, skinned to the bone, of course. Fletcher had to look away. The same runes were carved into three points around the campsite border, the same pattern. Draco noted them down.
“All the professors are banging on about NEWTs being around the corner-” Harry said, his eyes shifting to meet Draco’s as they laid inches apart. He blinked. “-and that we should make the most of—”
“Huh?” She frowned.
Harry grinned and he had that mischievous look in his eyes, it sparkled. “Nothing in particular. I just saw you brooding and figured you wouldn’t mind a chat.”
It was an unsettling idea really – to sleep in the same room as Potter and leave himself vulnerable in such a state – but Draco had long ago given up being afraid of the inevitable. If Potter was to attack him, Draco probably wouldn’t even fight it. He’d lie there and not make a sound.
“Oh, hey…! You should know I don’t usually drink this much! It’s just the… the alcohol helps me sleep sometimes.” He slurred, rocking back and forth, moving from the balls of his feet to his heels. “Did you know Muggles have their own versions of sleeping draughts? None of it fucking works on me though, I just… lie there staring at the ceiling, trying to remember if I could have s-saved one more life. Everything could have been different if I’d been a little… quicker, or smarter, or…”
Draco frowned.
“We should head back. I need to catch Kingsley before he leaves.” Potter said, looking across at him.
“Fine, the van is also doubling as our lodgings for the duration of the trip.” Potter said simply, his fingers drumming against the steering circle. “A quick extension charm and we’re set for the two nights.”
“They’re not… I can’t be sure.” Draco said after some time, once he’d exhausted every kind of magic he could manage.
After all, that dream could only harm one person: Draco.
Then, behind their mugs of tea, the clouds unleashing torrential rain onto the streets outside, Potter had leant across the chairs, across the narrow space that separated them and had given them space to quietly grow and forgive, and he had kissed Draco for the first time.
“Well, this is remarkable character development!” Fletcher clapped her hands together and sauntered towards the van to drag the side door open. “Hop in, Draco the muggle.”
His mother was noticeably concerned for his sanity and confused when Draco had asked. She couldn’t understand, even once he’d explained in the only terms that he understood it. Even still, she sought out the very best for her son and three days after Christmas, Draco had his first appointment with the only wizarding therapist in the country. It wasn’t a fruitful business, he heard, it was a so-called muggle occupation, after all. But his mother had heard from a friend of a client of theirs that the service was not only remarkable but might just spark the next wizarding fad.
Draco said nothing, suddenly thinking of his vaults filled with gold in Gringotts (the safest place on Earth according to all but the Golden Trio). Even after the Ministry’s heavy war reparation fees and taxes that ripped most of his family’s wealth to shreds, Draco had enough but so little that he could withdraw it all in two trips. He could quite literally spend his entire lifetime wealth on a birthday gift for—
Draco tugged them violently away and nodded in Fletcher’s vague direction. “
can choose. It doesn’t always matter if we remain the same or change or grow, as long as we recognise the choice.”
“It was the strangest thing. The man – Ares – he seemed to be, for all intents and purposes, a child.” Draco said, expanding. “He was our age. Although, his conversational skills seemed to be level with that of, perhaps, a… five-year-old?”
“Bye,
Instead, as Draco stood there, his legs quivering like an anxious child’s, Potter started walking again and strode past, his friends in tow.
“What do you want, Potter?” He asked.
Another fifteen minutes passed before Harry’s warmth vanished. Draco opened his eyes quickly, finding Harry sat up at the other end of the bed, aggressively rubbing his eyes and yawning.
“Fuck the bloody newspapers. All they do is lie and pry.” Harry squeezed Draco’s arm. “At least we give them
Strong arms – toned from a long summer of working out – tugged him closer, the adjoined hands glided around his chest to rest at Harry’s waist. And a kiss to his temple, before Draco’s head rolled back against the wall.
“It makes the rest of your life a little easier though.”
Harry’s entire body shivered beneath the contact, inches away from falling apart in Draco’s arms from something as seemingly innocent as lips against skin.
“Where are you going?”
Draco hushed her, pressing a finger to his lips. “Let him sleep.”
Draco didn’t even consider her delirious accusations. They were nothing more than that: accusations, with no evidence to back them up. Draco had made it clear for the decade he had known Harry Potter. He didn’t care for the man, nor the new world order he supposedly symbolised. The new world order that still hadn’t arrived.
“Maybe if the man gets a good night’s sleep,” Draco commented as their drinks were placed before them. He took an experimental sip of his wine, smiling politely at the waiter, as Potter chugged half of his beer in one swig.
“The country thinks
Draco sat up straight, tilting his head as he stared towards the door.
“So, Malfoy, would you come to my funeral?”
And Draco, rather annoyed by all this casual name tossing, took an aggressive bite of his chocolate and stared out the front window. “Are we leaving then?”
“Hey, how’s my favourite dork?”
, and for some reason or another, Potter had stuck around. Perhaps it was the way Draco flippantly answered all of his not-so-nonchalant questions about his personal life, maybe it had egged him on.
of their heeled shoes as they departed, leaving an empty room in their wake.
“Harry,” Potter managed to mutter from inside the plant pot despite his state.
“They’re not going to disappear, Draco,” Harry said into his neck, engulfing his boyfriend in a hug and a series of chaste kisses to the rest of his exposed skin. “You’re
Unfortunately for Draco’s sanity, they then spent the next hour going through her infinitely long train of thought. The sun had set by the time he’d allowed to raise his head and stretch.
Another heavy yawn. “Amaz—ing, now let me sleep.”
I'm hoping that the next chapter will be up by the end of this week! Thank you for reading and let me know what you think.
“Goodnight.” Potter said firmly and walked away to the couch.
Another ten minutes was spent stood at his side before Potter rolled onto his arse and stared up at Draco, a smudge of brown puke at the corner of his lip. The toilet was flushed a final time, once Potter had wiped his mouth, and then he was on his feet. He still looked unwell, his gaze unfocused, but the sway was far less pronounced, and he looked tired, not drunk. It was almost a relief.
Fletcher nodded silently, her gaze dropping to her lap under the watchful eye of their boss. Draco held his ground, maintaining eye contact. “Understood, sir.”
Not that he’d be pacing whilst Potter was in the room. Although, now would be a wonderful opportunity to do so as Potter provided all the details on the case that had been above Draco’s and Fletcher’s clearance until now. It would all sink in a little quicker if Draco could move, but he remained in his seat, staring at his page of notes as Potter’s voice grated on his ears.
Together.
Draco didn’t understand what that meant, where they were going to ‘pop into’, but he maintained his grip on the handle on the door and waited. The minibus was steered off the loud, busy motorway (another word Draco had picked up from the signs), and it veered around a sharp turn until it pulled to a stop under a large shelter. There was a strange contraption besides the unusual parking spot Potter had chosen.
A few content warnings and notes to make:
They filed in, Fletcher taking the lead to place her files on the corner of Shacklebolt’s desk, and perched on his two guest chairs, feeling out of place.
“Why does Potter get first name privileges?”
Some time ago, once this had become
“More.”
Draco cast a glance over his shoulder. Potter was standing a few feet away, hands buried deep in his robes.
“What did Granger get him?” He asked suddenly. “Weasley. What did she get Weasley in return? A year’s worth of stationery and a brand-new scarf?”
the villain. So what was the point of exploring any more of his cursed storyline?
Potter stared at him like Draco’s remaining intelligence had slipped out of his ear overnight. “And if they see us as a threat and attack?”
“I’ll freely admit that I held a grudge! You hurt my fucking feelings in first year and knocked my ego, so I was a dick to you.” Draco shouted, waving his hands around in crazy gestures. He probably had a deranged expression on his face, one to fit the madness. “I know that and I’m sorry, alright? I never wanted you to
So, with nothing useful left to read, Fletcher set to work perfecting the application of the tracking spell to a map. She had applied it the day before and despite the challenges of consistently tracking this number of people under a single spell, nothing had collapsed yet.
There was silence, aside from the mumbled swear words coming from the back seat.
His eyes were on Draco, trailing down his bare chest at an agonisingly slow pace, and he was taking slow steps towards the bed. The low-hanging sun was casting rich shades of gold and vibrant orange upon Harry’s body, dancing around his movements, illuminating him in a shimmer.
under his breath and Draco caught sight of a glimmer in the air, although it vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
Harry was close, so close that Draco could count his eyelashes.
It was paid in a few moments, a tip left on the tray for the waiter’s collection. Draco was ready to go, hoping to apparate home the first chance he got and jump in the bath to wash the day away. He stood. Potter stayed still.
?” Fletcher echoed in amusement.
“If you want to take a break, that’s okay.” Harry said quietly, his voice close to Draco’s ear. His hands shifted slightly.
“It does,” Harry said firmly, finally luring Draco’s gaze to meet his and he smiled. “We choose who we become, Draco.
“Oh, and take Malfoy with you - this is probably within his area of expertise.”
“Potter, I haven’t worked out what you’re up to yet, but I highly recommend you carry out your schemes on your friends instead. You—"
“You’ve hardly seen anything yet.” A teasing smile graced Draco’s lips as he gestured at the nearby door.
Draco laid there silently, his arm pinned beneath Harry’s neck, his body delightfully warm. The breaths skimming his shoulder were steady and Draco let his thoughts slow. Did he deserve such a glimpse of peace?
A throat was cleared behind him. “Malfoy.”
By the time Draco had answered all the questions Fletcher could conceive on the spot, several pages of paper were filled, a scrawl of ink portraying vague words. They settled back into observation once she’d spiralled into a deteriorating loop of indecipherable mutterings.
Draco had stubbornly resisted the suggestion. He'd already played his part in fate, he'd been type-cast as the villain, he
It was long enough to ignite a small albeit irritating reaction. Potter’s face hardened, his jaw clenching. Then it eased, replaced in a blink by a casual smile and shrugged away.
“I bet you don’t know about the muggles that raised me.” Potter interrupted, he rubbed his eyes as he spoke, and his throat strained as if he was swallowing a yawn. “I'm surprised the, er, Daily Prophet hasn’t done a bloody four-page spread on the topic. You see, my bedroom for ten years was the cupboard under the stairs. Not the kind of grand, extravagant staircase at your house - we lived in a semi-detached, three-bedroom house with narrow, steep steps to the first floor. I suppose I was still small enough at that age, but I was lucky my Hogwarts letter came when it did. That’s what Hermione says anyway.”
“Brilliant, let’s head over together.”
“Oh,” Potter’s face fell in disappointment, looking like the child he had once been, but it soon perked back up. “Yeah, but he wanted to sort out the few Aurors they had left first, and he’d just kinda got… stuck there.”
Thank Merlin. Draco wasn’t exactly the type to spend his nights rummaging through dark forests.
Potter appeared at the counter halfway through. “Want any help?”
“I reckon you could get a job somewhere else. The country isn’t as bad as it was five years ago and there is still a labour shortage.” Potter said.
“Is that an insult?” Draco responded, opening his working day with a question. His lips hadn’t wrapped around words since
That entire, ridiculous situation had been Theo’s idea after all - something about getting in touch with their fates, finding true love, walking the path destined for them. Theo did regularly spout a sludge of bullshit.
, it read. Potter was smiling at it, ripping away the plastic to take a bite from the chocolate within.

I believe my descriptions are respectful to the communities that suffer from similar conditions, however please call me out on anything where necessary.
“Touché.”
“But it’s a far more efficient use of space. You can read and I can sleep.” Harry said, smirking. “Wouldn’t you agree?”
The nurse appeared a few minutes later, dressed in a tidy, blue uniform that had small stains scattered across it – a coffee stain here, ink there, milk on the hem. She had her hair tied in a bun at the top of her head, and a hospitable smile on her lips. Her greeting was short, sweet, and professional, eyes skipping fleetingly to Potter’s forehead.
“I suppose the garage will do,” Draco said within a grin.
The remaining hour crawled by, occupied by a specific variety of pop music Draco couldn’t quite categorise. It was soft, led by piano or guitar, and the voices were soothing, singing of the magic of love and the pain and everything between. The songs had a different spark to those in the wizarding world, but they embed themselves into Draco’s heart with the clever lyrics and universal emotions they tugged upon.
Fletcher ran into the office at approximately 16:34 on Tuesday and slapped the tracking map onto Potter’s desk.
So, he smiled slightly. “Nothing she probably didn’t already know.”
“My point stands.” The left tip of Draco’s lips wavered, almost tipping into a smirk. “My father would be appalled at the company I keep.”
It was out of the blue that they were going to meet in public and fly together in the open air and limitless sky, and ignore the whispered gossiping, sharp glares and endless ridicule that was bound to occur on Draco’s side. And all of a sudden, on this bland Saturday morning, Harry was eager to humiliate him?
A silence bloomed in the air between them, Harry's hands still holding Draco, one curved into his hip, the second tracing his bicep. The guests passed with polite smiles and the
. Heavens above, can you imagine?”
Potter tilted his head to the side, shrugging last night’s robes back onto his shoulders. “Coming?”
They landed unsteadily on a pile of obtruding tree roots. Potter tugged him quickly behind a wide tree and pointed in the direction of two people. A wizard and a witch. Both untidy and unkempt, both with wands in their hands.
“It’s not exactly legal to stay overnight on the roadside,” Potter said as he moved his wand slowly from left to right.
“Maybe they suspect the Ministry is following them. The muggle police dropped the case weeks ago, but it was enough to grab our attention,” Fletcher suggested.
He’d missed Harry Potter more than he cared to admit.
In the silence, Draco and Fletcher wrote up their conversation – the relevant segments, at least –for the case file, knocking heads together as they mind-mapped possible conclusions from their disconnected notes. Fletcher took to doodling small creatures along the edge of the parchment. It began with the outline of a niffler, followed by Luna’s interpretation of a nargle and a lanky sasquatch. It was entertaining enough, to switch between her sketches and the dull camp before them.
“Fine,” Potter folded his arms, “But you’re paying next time!”
Harry spoke up in the pause. “Does she help?”
It wasn’t too shabby, being the centre of her scrutiny, potentially being the pivot point in this case. And having one-to-one communication with one of the cult members? They could have this case solved in a couple of weeks with Fletcher’s problem-solving skills, Draco’s intuition, and Potter’s… brawn.
Potter jogged over, the wind tousling his hair to an even more dire state. “What is it?”
“Have they carved the symbols anywhere else?”
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Draco drawled.
“Yes, indeed, it’s, um, one of the muggles’ better-made drink concoctions.”
“Potter is not a prospective husband. I’d rather marry a swine – and invite the wretched Prophet! – than spend the rest of my sinful days looking at Potter’s stupid face.”
“And now?”
Potter was rising to his feet, so Draco turned his attention back. There was an amicability present as Potter left the room, a wave bidding him goodbye. Whether they had received the answers they desperately wanted or not, he had made an impression.
“You two do not have licenses for combat action! And I am not facing off twenty-odd wizards of unknown magical ability by myself.” Potter hissed, his face turning a startling shade of pink. “It’s not worth the risk.”
Draco edged closer, ducking as his gaze found a group of wizards and witches wrapped around a dwindling fire. Their ages varied hugely. Several teenagers were chasing one another around the camp, childlike grins on their dopey faces, passing a couple of wizards of a more senior age. The latter were perched on a log by the flames, heads together, gesturing animatedly.
Draco began to wonder whether he was in his right mind after all.
His lips lifted into a small smile.
in a rough scrawl that certainly didn’t belong to Fletcher. But he turned it over and found her elegant cursive,
”I can’t be everything you want, Harry. I’m not… that’s never going to be me.”
“Yes, sir,” Draco and Fletcher answered automatically, shifting slightly in their seats now that the pleasantries were handled.
The Professor would be stirring in his grave.
“Do you need a guide?” Potter was staring at the road now as he tugged the vehicle back into the steady flow of traffic.
That was until Potter clapped his hands together jumped to his feet. “Come on, we’ve got a lot of ground to cover today. Let’s split up and meet up in three hours?”
He rejected the question, dismissing it to become a faint bulb blinking intermittently in the back of his mind. Yet, as he swirled the wine around the glass, watching the yellow-gold liquid swash against the sides, the question returned. That of Potter’s smile. Of Potter.
Fletcher offered to buy him dinner if Draco closed the case in six weeks. She said this through a mouthful of chocolate and washed it down with swig of the tea she’d brought, so Draco was a little sceptical of her genuineness.
family like yours and all. ” Harry was saying, straight-faced. “Admittedly, it doesn’t usually precede sleep, but I’m sure you can handle it.”
Fletcher shook Draco awake at around 10am, risking her own decapitation, and less than an hour later, the three of them were crouched in the same hillside spot, peering down at the group of suspects. Besides the childlike mannerisms they’d discussed in detail already, nothing remarkable was worth observing.
There was no obvious magic tied into the scripture.
“Marvellous.” Fletcher exhaled with relief. “I guess this is an appropriate time to warn you that I sleep-swear?”
Potter’s gaze landed on him lightly, looking tired and distant but still so darn Potter-ish.
The meeting began in all its dullness.
“I do, actually. Well, some days.” Potter said, his tone level and devoid of emotion. “I can’t claim it’s anymore efficient than apparition, but it does the job.”
It took another minute to coax Griffin into settling down in a chair to answer a few questions. Once he had, he shifted his limbs around in discomfort, as though they were too long and unfamiliar, and made a pointed effort not to meet Potter’s eyes.
“Yes, sir.” It was taunting, perhaps enough to warrant a reaction but Potter didn’t stir. He laid perfectly still, looking so small and harmless and worthy of kindness, and Draco watched him for a while.
Harry smiled and in one quick movement, his lips pressed against Draco’s. They were soft and warm and chapped from the winter air and… gone. They were gone before Draco could even close his eyes. Harry’s lips said something.
“I wasn’t a normal First Year, I guess you could say, what with Voldemort trying to kill me. But at least Hogwarts fed me properly. And even when the Dursleys started, er, feeding me three meals a day, they put bars on my window like I was a criminal.” Potter was talking to the fire at this point, a distant look on his face. “I used to wish I had a different childhood, a
“You really need to work on your ginormous ego—” Draco remarked as he laid down in the vacant space beside Harry and let the covers fall on top of him. His toes were cold from the stone floor. The chill was spreading from his toes to his hips and above, egging on his muttered complaints. “Ordering me about, clambering into
They were out into the bitter cold air by the time Harry spoke again.
“It has some interesting articles. They aren’t far off with their theory about the Fodger Giant Uprising in Thailand!”
“Don’t –” Draco’s voice cracked. “Don’t thank me.”
He couldn’t reverse time. But from now on, Draco would protect Harry or die trying.
Draco considered it, turning back to the campsite. “They don’t have any other mode of transport.” He realised, “Although, all of them look to be of age, why wouldn’t they apparate? Why this forest?”
Potter pulled open a door that seemed to roll open along the length of the abomination and gestured to take a seat. Fletcher easily climbed in, slinging herself in one of the seats near the front.
“What could he remember about the cult and the forest?”
Potter was laughing by the end of the story, clutching his stomach, as Fletcher flushed a dark shade of red, that snaked up her neck to her cheeks. The laughter, Potter’s laughter, was strange to hear – so close to Draco, within the same conversation as him. It was rough and throaty and flowed out of Potter with a natural ease.
“No problem.”
Draco looked at him. Harry paid no attention; he was preoccupied adjusting the blanket, shifting it so that it wrapped around Draco’s shoulder. “It was fine,” Draco said.
Draco levitated the crate out of his arms and sent it inside, grabbing two of the packed bags himself. Potter didn’t resist, the slump of his shoulders easing a fraction and his face looking less deathly pale. No wonder, the bags were crammed with groceries, brands and logos that Draco didn’t recognise aside from the few that Fletcher brought in for her weekday lunches.
He traced each photo with his gaze, seeing his dad in a new light with each frame, finding his grandparents in the fragments of life left behind. They seemed to smile right at him, from behind the veil, their kind eyes looking into his, before their portraits reset and their eyes shifted away.
“Arsehole.” Fletcher slapped him on the arm as she left the kitchen with a small skip in her step. Draco watched her plod across the room and throw her body into one of the desk chairs, wrapping her knees up to her chin as she flipped open yet another of her books.
Did anyone have
. He nearly looked alive, rather than looking like an exhausted 23-year-old with nothing better to do on the weekend than stalk a creepy cult through the forest.
Draco exhaled heavily. “We’re one step closer.”
It released a whining creak as he pushed it open and found Potter sat on the grass verge, his hair twisted in a crown of moonlight. The man didn’t react to the door opening, nor the sound of Draco slowly lowering himself onto the edge of the minibus.
“That cashier was a judgemental cow, he kept staring at my hair like I was a teenage delinquent. I’m twenty-five fucking years old – oh, sorry, Harry. Language.” She leant forward and through the gap in the front seats. “Here’s your change, and the receipt.”
Then, there was a distant patter of voices and Draco felt a light wave of magic wash down his skin. He froze once again, tilting his head towards the thick forest to his side, and stared in the direction of the magic. Almost automatically, his legs rallied his body forward. It was instinctual, and the magic felt familiar, though unsettling.
wrath ever manifested towards Draco, he would be running for the hills with his dignity intact.
Fletcher tugged him to Case 341’s specially allocated room a couple of times a day to discuss another theory of hers. She had a hundred and one suspicions about the group’s activities and their grand plan. Draco shot down approximately 60% of them. Meanwhile, Potter occasionally appeared to offer a comment or two. Sometimes he was already in the room, curled up behind his desk, reading the same case file over and over again. In those instances, he didn’t seem to hear Fletcher or Draco; they might as well not be there. Potter’s mind seemed to be elsewhere anyway.
Fletcher nodded, all too happy to answer, as Potter nudged the owl until it perched on his wrist and walked over.
The patronus fizzled out, dropping to the floor in an array of emerald sparks, as Draco’s knees gave way and he sank to the rug. Pain flooded his body, a torture beyond control, without end.
Draco glared at her.
“Good boy,” Fletcher commented slyly.
“I lied.” Draco said and wanted to clamp a hand over his mouth a second later. Potter slightly lifted his eyebrows. “I…I don’t like my job. The Ministry is still fucked up and everybody is ignoring that. The work can be interesting…but if I could get a job anywhere else, I wouldn’t hesitate to quit.”
Draco turned back towards the road. “Yes.”
Draco laid against the headboard of his bed and turned towards Harry.
Draco made a move to stand up, to usher himself out of whatever alternate universe he’d stumbled upon. But Potter rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, it was a hard, foreign weight on his shoulder that somehow didn’t feel out of place, and Draco paused. His mind listed all the possible schemes of Potter’s this action could be linked to, eliminating the least likely. Only a short list remained.
“We take them in by force.”
He was probably right. Draco hardly felt safe here, surrounded by muggles in their death traps. From the glimpses he’d seen of the driving in the centre of London, Draco would rather risk his life on the outskirts. Not that it seemed to be much better; there were car horns blaring ahead, behind and to the side and cars skimming each other with inches to spare.
There wasn’t a lengthy chance to appreciate the flustered look with which Draco had been bestowed. Fletcher blocked his view with her fat head and stuck a flow chart in his face to interrupt the moment.
The wards bristled as Harry stepped through the iron-wrought gates into a large courtyard. They tickled his skin, sensing him to be the rightful owner of the property. A scattering of autumnal leaves danced around his legs as the feeling blossomed into a warm wave of energy wrapping around his body.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was not sure why he had no choice in the matter, yet his body complied. Draco leant back into the sofa, reassuming his previous position, and Potter’s head wriggled in place, settling. There was hair tickling his neck and Draco strained away from it, twisting his body into an incredibly uncomfortable position to guarantee minimal contact with Potter, and Potter, unaffected, continued to nuzzle into Draco’s shoulder, his legs tucked beside him.
Limbs wrapped around Draco, lethargic limbs that took their time to curve around his cold frame and squeeze gently. Harry smiled against his chest, Draco could feel it: the extension of his lips, the slight hardness of teeth. He kissed the space between Draco’s shoulder and his collar bone, the moment after. Draco pulled Harry closer.
“Malfoy,” Weasley said simultaneously, his fingers curled around his wand.
They stared up at the two apparent leaders for instruction, often cross-legged on the floor with fidgeting fingers. They threw tantrums and stomped their boots on the ground or wailed until they received the inevitable life lesson that they’d only be ignored.
Why did it sound so
“What?” Fletcher stared at him.
“Great. I’ll make a start on dinner then?”
“What are we doing, Potter?” Draco interrupted suddenly -
“Judging by their hygiene states, they’ve been living here for several months, I’d say. So, it’s possible.” Draco answered lowly. “I assume muggles don’t usually trample around the woods in thin clothes muttering under their breath?”
“Potter, I—"
They stood there, with their thoughts and emotions, and Draco wondered how long it would take him to love this house as much as Harry did. Not long at all, he concluded, as the house’s magic danced happy patterns along his skin.
“Come with me.” It was poised as a demand but it seemed to be a question. Potter’s tone was gentle and he never spoke to Draco like that. “Malfoy
Perhaps twenty members, Draco counted as he crouched behind a large boulder, and they were all dressed in robes barely thick enough to stay naturally warm. A few that had strayed from the centre had long muggle coats dangling off their shoulder. The wards shimmered in the air a few feet from his position; they would be enough to subtly deter muggles from the area, but any half-competent wizard would be capable of detecting the diversion effect.
Without thinking, his fingers reached for the closest image - stretching closer and closer to his family. Gone or not, they were his.
“Malfoy.” Potter said pointedly. Draco was beginning to tire of his own surname. “I want to show you something. Let’s go.”
She tugged him over to a stump of tree, only a foot of the pre-existing tree jutted out of the ground. It was covered in a dark green moss, but Fletcher wiped it away with her sleeve. Similar runes emerged in the bark, wrapping around the circumference of the tree.
Her eyes swung casually around the room and paused when they fell upon Draco and dropped to Harry’s sleeping body. She stepped forward, her mouth opening, an accusatory expression on her face.
“Or we can end things. I’ll be fine, we’ll both be fine.”
One moment, Draco was strolling down the corridor, his chin held high, his posture perfect, pretending as usual as though he wasn’t crippled inside. Then he saw Potter, walking as part of the Golden Trio, and they locked eyes. Potter gave him a Look and it had rippled out of Draco before he could stop it. It had been piling up, the guilt and the horror, until it burst and so now, Draco was yelling across a semi-empty corridor.
“Why is the sky blue?” That was a muggle expression that Draco had picked up recently, though he had not had an appropriate opening to use it. Honestly, Harry should be proud, but he only looked pissed off. And Draco backtracked. “Should I change who I am to satisfy your ideas of emotional stability?”
The sickly smell of disinfectant drifted in Draco’s direction, drudging up old memories of his father’s last days in hospital. But Draco reminded himself that he was here as an investigator, a consultant not being paid enough for day trips to witness questionings. Any complex emotions that arose from a simple scent were set to the side for a later emotional crisis.
She grinned. “That’s Draco-speak for
“Has our nation’s golden boy got an anger issue? I guess you didn’t get your temper from the Dark Lord after all.”
Draco’s chair swallowed the weight in his feet, eased the burden, but even still, he toyed with his fingers, twisting and interlocking and grazing  the wrinkle-free fabric of his suit.
A lone photographer stalked the entrance, hoping for a glimpse and a small commission for yet another minor news story. He wouldn’t make a single knut if Draco had any say in it.
There was a heavy exhale. Then, a chuckle. Potter was laughing quietly, his shoulder shaking against Draco’s, as he said, “I never thought I’d hear you say that.”
Posters were plastered in both, one had the rockstars of the 70s - Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks - the other had Quidditch posters from the floor to the ceiling. Otherwise, the bedrooms hardly seemed lived in. Every other belonging was neatly tidied away, dresser drawers closed and trunks tucked in the corners. Harry smiled sadly.
Potter blinked heavily and looked across at Draco.
The surveillance spot where Potter and Fletcher had previously been lounging was bare.
“I can’t… I’ve got a hot date with Luna Lovegood,” said Fletcher nonchalantly, dusting off her robes.
Potter rolled his eyes. He did that a lot; it was getting on Draco’s nerves.
“They seem to match the criteria.” Potter said, his tone a fraction stiffer than usual. “A large group of more than ten individuals, magical abilities, we’ve witnessed them carving runic symbols that likely match those at the crime scene, evidence that they’ve been living in the area for several weeks.”
“Did they diagnose Mr Griffin with anything specific?” Draco asked the lingering nurse, as they both stared through the glass.
Draco requested the bill sometime after their plates were wiped clean and he had mere droplets left in his wine glass.
Draco was more focused on obtaining every strip of information he could now. The earlier this investigation was concluded, the better.
the end.
The scene looked stripped of all useful clues, but they silently set to work anyway, splitting off in separate directions to track down the subtlest of hints that might assist the investigation.
The surrounding buzz, the chatter of the few other occupants of the pub, consumed the air. If Draco had not been in his current company, he might even say it seemed like any other time at a pub: booze, laid back conversations, a natural ease. The sort of atmosphere that they didn’t belong in, not together.
“Welcome home, Harry.”
Hey! Let me just say, Writing is
“I never told you this but… a
However, there was only so many words one could read. After a couple of hours, Draco could feel his brain substance melting and dripping gradually out of his ear. His eyes weren’t much better either, he had to rub them repeatedly to regain focus.
Draco hadn’t been kissed in practically years. There had been a bit of fooling around in sixth year, girls being used as stress relief and mindless distraction. Yet, in the longest time, nothing had given Draco butterflies quite like that…
Satisfied with the compromise, Fletcher nodded and smiled to herself. This only opened a hundred other possibilities in the case’s solution for her. Fletcher was often a nightmare to work with, especially when all the puzzle pieces of a long case started slotting into their rightful place. She became intensely unreserved about her opinion and theories. A few interns had been spotted literally running away from a case meeting with her. Draco had the advantage of being a friend, but he could still expect to be prodded several times an hour with new links she’d made. Fletcher wouldn’t stop until she sussed out the intricacies of this cult.
“I’m not uncultured, Potter.”
Then, a wave of dark magic washed over Draco as he stepped over the threshold. It must’ve affected the other two in a similar way; they both shivered, unable to combat the chilling feeling that trickled down their spines.
Draco’s eyes snapped to his. This was hardly the time. Then again, Harry could never choose the right moments, he made them.
, he had Draco’s legs intertwined with his own, their feet stretched out to the other side of the alcove, his back pressed to Draco’s chest, soft cushioning beneath their bodies.
“I only said you were swearing in your sleep.” Potter explained, turning away to spread syrup across a pile of pancakes. “Quite loud, actually.”
He was washed over by a sense of vulnerability, curled up opposite the Chosen One, who was just a man. Really, Draco had always known Potter was only a boy and then, only a man, but… but they’d never been caught in such a strange scenario.
a paid extra in The Potter Show.
“You’re under that stupid invisibility cloak, aren’t you?” Draco asked the open air, praying to Merlin himself that he wasn’t making a fool out of himself.
It was, in fact, an extremely peaceful half an hour. Fletcher seemed to take note of the atmosphere too and relaxed into a slightly-less-than-perfect posture as Shacklebolt rattled through the items. Nonetheless, Draco was still eager to escape to their little nook in the case 341 office. There he could experience complete peace and work through all the problems that were supposed to unravel with a simple tug but didn’t.
And here they were, apparently the finest the Ministry had to offer: Auror Potter and his two consultants. What a striking trio.
“Do you really have no one who can come and get you?” Draco asked, leaning against the wall. “Granger, Weasley, Finnigan?”
“Yeah...?” Harry said, his gaze lifting from the wet grass that was smothering his boots. With sparkling eyes, it landed on Draco, infinitely heavy and light. It matched with a small smile and his pink cheeks and the slight tilt to his head and his stupid messy hair and everything about him.
None of the texts seemed to provide anything relevant to the case. The group was still an unknown. Its actions were harmless, besides the one accused crime, and half of its members didn’t seem developed enough to hatch an evil plan. Although, the anonymous tips the Ministry had received suggested otherwise.
A weak smile was returned, alongside a small nod. “Thank you, Draco.”
Draco’s fingers slid up Harry’s nape, into knotty hair, and smiled unapologetically. He was happy too; Draco was allowed to be happy, to have Harry, to have moments like these before the world grew too big and complicated again.
“Are you still drinking that?” He asked, wet hair drooping over his forehead. “The tea?”
The forest split into a more obvious clearing after a further three hundred yards. There was evidence of muggles trampling all over the place, no doubt the police Potter had mentioned. But there were scraps of yellow tape that suggested they were in the correct place, as well as a long dead fire in the centre of the clearing and a vague scent of basic maintenance magic.
“No, I didn’t, Draco…” Fletcher drawled, rearranging the files she clutched against her chest. “I don’t pay as much attention to Harry as you do.”
Potter had the same tired look as Shacklebolt, Draco noticed after begrudgingly watching him speak for the past hour. They both carried the weight of the world on their backs, stupid fools. With all they’d done, they should be solely caring for themselves – unlike the
Potter dove into his pocket and withdrew a small recording device. It was muggle technology and a simple memory share would be more efficient, but the residential home had approved it and the other two had a strange overreliance on their technology. The device was placed into Fletcher’s palm and she stashed it away.
This proximity to Potter wasn’t helping Draco’s straying mind. He couldn’t maintain his hold on the theories that slipped around his mind, each of them taunting his lack of knowledge. Each idea gradually morphed into the realisation that he could hardly bring himself to look at the suspects, that the devil on his shoulder was tempting him into glancing over at Potter.
Out of nowhere, he straightened his spine, his nose pointing to the ceiling, and said,
“Draco, I’m a beer drinker.”
earnest. He looked like he genuinely cared. A frown pushed through onto Draco’s lips.
The next update will be out as soon as I can manage it - work and the perpetual cold is really draining all my energy at the moment :/
knows Shacklebolt is up for the Minister position. Didn’t he already turn down the role after the war? They’re going to force him up on the highest pedestal eventually; nobody else wants the job, let’s face it.”
“You should know that the conversation Fletcher and I were having earlier…we didn’t— she acts like that sometimes,
“Here,” Potter held out a portkey in the form of a kettle once they were back at the minibus. “The same settings as last time.”
Potter shrugged. “Alright. Do you know your way out?”
Niemi
As they landed down the street from the Ministry, tucked neatly behind a large dustbin, and Potter pulled his arm away, Draco found himself wanting to spend a little longer in his universe.
The minibus parked up on the roadside. A few faces appeared in the surrounding windows, nobody ever
Routine was a simple thing after two nights. Draco and Fletcher wrote, Potter read his file. There was a natural division through the room; the gradual redeemers and the national treasure. No matter how many reforms the Ministry made, it would always exist.
There, he could see smiling faces with familiar noses and cheekbones and tousled black hair. He could see a trio of people, people that looked like him: a young boy, an older woman and a man. The pictures moved in a short loop: the woman brushing a stray hair out of the boy’s eyes, smiles splitting into grins, the man adjusting his crooked hat, another boy bursting into the scene. Sirius.
was when tires screeched to a stop behind him and he pivoted to see Fletcher’s wild hair caught in the wind as she leaned out the minibus window.
Potter didn’t seem to care whether he received an answer and instead kicked them headfirst into a normal conversation.
“What if these wizards aren’t the perpetrators?” She asked an hour into the surveillance.
“Anything else we should know, Juniper?” asked Potter, eyeing the front door.
“No, you have a huge crush on Luna Lovegood.” Draco said, and when Fletcher opened her mouth with denial printed upon her expression, he added, “Don’t deny it! She’s the new editor and I’ve seen you not-so-subtly pick up a copy every month since her promotion.”
He watched Draco from his narrow half of the bed. It was another ten minutes before either closed their eyes. Draco spent the time scouring Harry’s face, memorizing each slope and shadow and curve. Harry looked back at him.
“Only one interviewer please,” The nurse stopped Draco with an outstretched hand. “Arthur often becomes agitated when there is too much attention on him. This should have been mentioned in the debriefing.”
Potter shrugged, “My best friend is a 6-year-old.”
“The same runes?” Potter whispered.
“Just go home,” Draco paused, weighing up the viable options. No matter what happened now, he wanted to be on the amicable side of Potter. So, he tagged on a foreign, “Harry.”
Draco shrugged it off with a small smile and disappeared into the bathroom.
Draco.
They set off once more, sliding back onto the same road as before and gaining speed with a dissatisfactory rate. Draco settled once more into his seat, arms crossed and eyes out the window. He saw more cars than he expected to see in a lifetime down this endless strip of road.
The pair of cult members were crouched around a particularly average tree, their wands tracing the same symbols in the air that he’d seen before. His suspicions had been correct. Now, he just had to unveil the truth. Whatever that entailed.
sign, a quick stumble back to Draco’s flat upstairs, hours of kissing and movement and drowsy talking. No doubts or hesitation, only arms wrapped around shoulders and waists and warmth between bare stomachs and the hum of Potter's voice against Draco’s neck.
There was quiet once more – aside from the rowdy game of tag the younger camp members were playing below.
Draco was tugged into the fireplace.
Fletcher led the way upon Draco’s prompting, and they both emerged into a large space with low hanging lamps. There was a couple of desks in the distant corner, propped against three neatly lined up twin beds. A sofa was sat in the near left, facing a small kitchen and its adjoining dining space.
But it was a fool’s prediction. Tarot cards were used by the uneducated, the wizards and witches who failed to see the inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Forecasting life events that never happened, foreshadowing apocalyptic disasters that had not yet come to be. It was child’s play in the complications of fate.
“I wish,” The nurse scoffed. “Arthur’s parents were long gone and he had no brothers, sisters, or kids to speak of. Any distant relatives they managed to track down didn’t respond, the nasty buggers! What’s family for, ey? If not to lend a helping hand when you’re in trouble.”
“We would if we travelled by portkey.”
Fletcher read despite the darkness, a small orb of light on the tip of her wand illuminating the words of the latest Quibbler. She occasionally made a comment on a delightfully misguided article, laughing under her breath as she read out the headlines or simply stating “Oh, they got halfway there on this one!”. Draco glanced back when there was a particularly pointed sigh, the kind he associated with Fletcher stumbling across a picture of Luna Lovegood.
“Yeah, it looks like they’re in…” Fletcher enlarged the map, bringing the details into focus, then planted her hands on either side of it. “Hargate Forest? Either of you been there before?”
“She’s fine.”
There was a smear of sauce on the tip of Potter’s chin, enough to draw a gaze that couldn’t quite move away, except when it gradually shifted up to the rest of Potter’s features. Across his full lips, his blemished skin, the small indent on his nose where his glasses had been sitting, his emerald eyes.
Fletcher passed around the sandwiches and chocolate she’d been carrying in her bag, and they munched in silence, staring around at the surrounding forest. They remained there, crouched on the ground for around twenty minutes. Fletcher was muttering some mathematical calculations under her breath, but besides her, the world seemed still. A soft breeze rustled the trees’ branches every once in a while, and birds chirped in the near distance, but it all seemed so far away.
I hope you enjoyed it! Please let me know :D
Draco took a long inhale. “Fuck the papers.”
, they said.
Harry was looking at him, through tired eyes, and he smiled. He did that so effortlessly. “C’mon, I’ve got a class test tomorrow and I wouldn’t mind getting 6 hours of sleep.” Said Harry as he slid beneath Draco’s sheets and sunk into the pillow.
“We can regroup tomorrow and run through the interview,” Fletcher suggested, probably sick of the quick-fire back and forth.
An eye roll later, Potter deadpanned, “It’s about time I had one of those, don’t you reckon?”
The man stared at him, cocking his head to the side. He appeared to ponder it for a moment, then shook his head decisively.
. Can’t that be enough for now?”
Fortunately, the faint magical imprint that the group had left made tracking them down far easier than the prior week. Draco was able to detect a trail that followed the stream’s jagged route, upon the manipulation of a simple level three tracking spell, and they set off, tracing the river’s outline with their boots.
From the intel Fletcher had gathered, the former member of the Dartmoor Cult wouldn’t necessarily respond to any hard-hitting questions like they’d hoped. Fletcher had written a list but later had to strike off more than half of her questions when she’d heard more about the condition of the subject.
“My apologies, your highness.” Said Harry, fully settled now into his place. He clutched the duvet in one fist, his hair splayed across the silk pillowcase and his glasses abandoned to the side. “I promise not to make any demands for 18 hours of the day.”
He was sick of hiding and staying silent and dodging disgusted glances of fellow students. He was tired of being holed up in classrooms and his dorm room, never staying anywhere else for more than a fleeting moment. It wasn’t much but at 1 am, after he listened to the rest of the Eighth Years wander to bed, he slipped out of his room and tiptoed down the stairs to peer into the common room. It was empty, just as he liked it.
Nothing that couldn’t be drowned out by other thoughts. Draco was well trained in dismissing the flashing alerts in his head, the searing memories. Wasn’t everyone after the war? Ignoring, moving on, pretending, silently suffering.
A roll of his eyes later, Draco knocked his body against Potter’s solid side. “Shut up.”
A bribe of new, tailored robes had won him over in the end. The Malfoys were not as wealthy as their ancestors, not anymore.
“Right then. The plan is to observe them for a couple of days and set up a few surveillance and tracking spells. That way, we can continue to monitor them from the office.” Potter said, tipping his head towards Fletcher. “Juniper has been researching the most efficient spells for this number of wizards.”
His threat fell upon deaf ears as the waiter approached with the bill and Draco busied himself with his robes, dismissing the implication of Potter’s words. Another promise.
“No, not at all. Fletcher and I will just slave away over here. You continue wasting away all you like.” Draco said, a bite to his words – so much so that Fletcher lifted her head from the desk and shot a warning look at him.
Draco should have seen it coming.
Draco considered it, how silent the forest might be, how easily a loud crack will travel through the trees and reveal them.
In tune with an English spring, the afternoon was bitter. Swirling above, the clouds offered nothing but light drizzles of rain, woven with freezing winds that nipped at Draco’s skin. They huddled beneath a tree on top of the hillside, shelter charms cast strategically above as to not leave any noticeably dry patches.
Potter moved through the door, forever leading the way. Draco made to follow, running through all the questions he wanted to ask, connecting them to each of his individual theories.
Potter was staring at him, a frown on his face. Oh, how Draco hated that frown. He had no idea which intricate emotion was lying behind the frown, but it couldn’t be good. For Salazar’s sake, Draco has just screamed at the chosen one with half the sanity of a long-term prisoner of Azkaban. He noticed Granger’s and Weasley’s expressions now. The latter had his wand out, primed for an attack, and Granger, she was staring like Potter but with something piercing in her eyes.
They set off, Potter’s hands clutching a circular, cushioned pipe of sorts as the car’s engine roared to life. Draco had read that much about the muggles’ preferred means of transport – for his own safety really – but he still couldn’t quite figure out how the thing worked. They were propelled forward, merging into the rest of the cars with ease, with a constant tremor that must stem from the engine he’d read about.
“It’s the bloody weekend,” Harry groaned and pushed against Draco’s chest for a moment, threatening to roll away. He stopped and collapsed back against him, his arm returning to Draco once more. “What do you want?”
“Fuck off, Draco. I know it tastes like crup shit,” She snapped with a roll of her eyes. Draco laughed without thinking. “Oh, gosh, sorry, Harry. I’ll really watch my language from now onwards.”
she found out. Pansy learnt everybody’s secrets. In fact, Draco had better begin planning his counterattack this very moment.
“I still don’t understand this case.” Fletcher said, staring down at the group, head tilted to the side.
“I don’t want to.”
He pushed through the wild undergrowth and stopped a hundred yards in. Voices drifted over, woven with casual incantations, nothing more than simple spells.
Draco cast a quick stinging hex to her exposed calf, all he could reach at this angle, and took satisfaction in the muffled scream she released. He’d been waiting the entire week for the opportunity.
home, as much as the long arms that wrapped around Harry when Draco reached him.
When he woke, Potter was rummaging through the kitchen cupboards, looking tired, but his bed sheets were rumpled. Draco smiled.
“I promised no such thing,” Potter said over his shoulder. His eyes looked sunken from the drive, but a smile toyed at the corners of his lips. “Seatbelt on.”
“I sleep.” Potter answered sharply.
“What about people like you?” Potter asked.
“It’s awful really, what’s happened to Arthur.” She continued, clinking her spoon against the cup as she stirred her tea. “No family to speak of, no memories of his long life. The only thing that ties him to his old life is his body. Isn’t that sad? Poor man.”
A sip or two later, Potter was throwing up once again.
casual conversation since they first met – well, it ended. Draco rose back onto his feet and turned to go back to bed. Something prompted him to linger. He looked at the man tucked in the grass.
Draco came to a simple conclusion as his eyes grew too weary to remain open. It was consolidated when he woke up in the early hours of the morning, warm, Harry’s arm curled around his waist, his body lightly pressed to Harry’s.
“Except they do, Harry. They prod and they poke until the worst in people are revealed, until they find dirty secrets and the ugly truth, then they publish it on their fucking front pages!” Draco shouted, whirling on the spot to grab the latest copy of Witch’s Weekly that Mrs Weasley had left behind, and stabbed the front cover of their faces. “And they’re not wrong! Just like the papers say, I’m unpredictable and evil! I’m unhinged, unstable, and
“Do you wanna check the carvings?” Potter asked, loosening the cloak around Draco before tugging it off completely.
“Mmph. Ron doesn’t snore so badly in the mornings.”
“Goodnight… Harry.”
Draco said nothing. He kept his eyes glued on Slughorn during his usual drivelling, they shifted to his cauldron once they were set today’s task. He completed it before anybody else, slinking out of his seat to Slughorn with a small vial. Even he fixed Draco with an awkward look, dismissing him from class in an instant, although Draco couldn’t tell whether he’d heard the rumours or whether it was the same look that all the teachers gave him. Pity.
They were led to a small room, large enough to fit a few chairs around a desk and a tea trolley. It was adjoined to another room that was much more spacious, a small window offering an internal observation point. Through it, Draco could see Arthur Griffin.
Eyes were closed, lips were pouted, his nose was sharp. It was Potter in his simplest form.
“Yes…we should,” Draco replied absent-mindedly, tracing the symbols with the tip of his index finger.
“Right, well,
“No… I don’t,” Fletcher flashed them a blinding grin. “But I do have a life. Have fun without me, boys.”
He shouldn’t let his thoughts betray him either, sway him towards staying a little longer, a little later. Maybe he’d waste the whole night away, legs dangling off a barstool, Potter right there, an arm’s length away at most. They’d drink away the years of hatred, swallowing the regrets and the pain with a swig of vodka.
“Do you spend much time in the muggle world, Malfoy?” Potter asked, rolling the minibus forward and veering it gradually back towards the road.
The three of them had been allocated their own room, a few doors down from the packed Auror office. Draco was glad to have the space to breathe, he had enough room to pace behind his desk without rustling the feathers of his usual neighbouring co-workers. He’d learnt that wasn’t wise given his social status.
His last words stung with a snarky tone but Potter smiled and nodded. “Cheers.”
“They’d hear us coming,” Potter bit back.
Draco narrowed his eyes, “Why do we need—?"
“Why don’t you tell Potter about the great porridge incident with your last boyfriend? That’s a delightful tale,” Draco prodded his work friend from across the table with a wicked grin.
“You came!” She shouted across the small car park.
It took a long moment for Draco to catch up and then he had to pause, contemplate honesty, and say, “Well, I don’t like my colleagues or the institution, but yes, I suppose. It pays the bills.”
That was the vulnerability of love.
Fletcher had risen before him, evidenced by the gentle clicking of a spoon against china as she stirred her morning tea. There were low voices too, the other being as almost as familiar as Fletcher’s rough voice.
“There’s nothing definite we can tie to them?” Potter asked, patience grazing his light tone.
Several hours were spent ransacking the surrounding perimeter for any dormant traces of magic that might just offer a clue to the group’s location. Nothing was found, besides a few mangled rabbits in the hollow of a tree and a faint smell of blood that was probably emanating from the rabbits.
“Hello, mister.” A man in his early twenties approached Draco. He looked around the same age, dark skin imbedded with soil and a splatter of blood on the corner of his lips. His black hair grazed his shoulders, looking unwashed and uncombed. Dressed in the same thin robes of the campmates, Draco knew there was no denying this man belonged to the cult.
The darkness returned, along with the press of Potter’s body. It alleviated as they arrived in a wooded area, the sun blocked out by the huge canopy of branches and leaves above, but Potter’s body remained. His shoulder stayed pressed to Draco as they swept the surrounding area with their eyes, seeking their subjects.
. He shouldn’t have awkward situations dangling in the way of a perfectly respectable work relationship. His father had always underlined the importance of balancing politics in a good job. So, here Draco went… reconciling with Harry Potter.
“Malfoy.” Potter said pointedly, rolling his eyes and silently transmitting a message of ‘
“It’s good, right?” Potter actually smiled, opening his own bottle and chugging the iced tea.
Fletcher cleared her throat as she nodded slowly in an awkward act of empathy, a pained expression on her face. “Were the authorities able to trace any family?”
Was Harry Potter volunteering to drag a clueless Draco Malfoy around muggle London? That would be a sight to see. Perhaps he could almost envision it: taking the grubby tube, chatting as those escalator contractions lifted them up to ground-level, strolling around the city’s landmarks, stopping for a coffee, Potter’s smile.
Draco didn’t want to let go of Harry after Hogwarts. Even if they had still been rivals, it would’ve been true. Some part of Draco had always been tied to Harry, just as their combined actions somehow led to the Dark Lord’s downfall. He didn’t believe their connection would be constrained to a school rivalry and friendship. Harry was more than that, they were more than that. And so,
“Brilliant,” Potter set off in a brisk walk, glancing over his shoulder expectantly until Draco caught up. “They have this fantastic risotto Hermione has been raving about for weeks, I’ve been meaning to try it.”
“Are you coming?” Potter said, stepping into them. His face was engulfed by darkness as he looked over his shoulder. “I swear on my rarest Chocolate Frog card that I have no intentions of killing, maiming or seriously harming you.”
Macmillan’s heavy breathing filled the air as Harry crawled onto Draco’s bed, settling in a cross-legged position, and tugged on his wrist. Draco stumbled and followed without the chance to protest. Harry flicked his wand and the bed curtains all closed. He muttered a
Arthur Griffin had been in residential care for five months, following a sudden appearance on the main street of Princetown in ill-fitting clothes, a wild look to him, and then a subsequent stint in St Mungo’s. No family had appeared to visit nor look after him.

“Auror Potter said you wanted a word, sir? How can we be of assistance?” Fletcher asked, her fingers twisted in the fabric of her robes.
Then it vanished from his lips, withdrawing. Draco opened his eyes, the fingers around his neck sliding to settle at his chest.
“Shall we go for a fly?” Harry asked. His PJ bottoms had risen enough to display toned calves and perpetual scars.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. Potter’s game was a confusing sort. It must be a longwinded trick. He didn’t like it; he didn’t like complications. Potter was complicated and deceiving and brave. Draco didn’t want to know what his games entailed.
The sun was peeking over the horizon by the time Potter moved again. it was only a couple of hours before breakfast when he rose from Draco’s shoulder, pulled his glasses from his pocket, slipped them onto his nose and stood up. Potter stretched his arms to the ceiling, his t-shirt rising to reveal a sliver of skin before it fell into hiding again.
“Nervous?” Potter asked.
“Just over there.” Ares flapped his arm in the direction of Potter, Fletcher and the camp. He grinned toothily and hopped on the spot. “Can I come visit your house? I’ve never seen a
The three of them walked deeper and deeper into the forest, along a lightly marked path that had been moulded by footfall. The trees grew taller and wilder, the roots were stuck out of the ground at awkward angles as they looped back to the trunks. Draco stepped through it all, glad to be wearing the most durable pair of boots he owned.
“Good with kids, huh?” Fletcher asked once he was within earshot.
“Do you reckon 100 yards east will be out of earshot?” He asked, more to the map than Draco.
Fletcher shook her head. “Since this is an opt-out situation, I actually have a couple more leads to follow up.”
As he changed – certainly not into any of that awful denim that Potter was sporting again today – he could hear the faint chatter of Fletcher and Potter in the other room. They must have worked together many times in the past year. The pair seemed to have an easy friendship and he hadn’t heard Fletcher act so casual around anyone besides Draco at work.
Potter didn’t save the bleeding Wizarding World for Draco to form a mild case of attraction for the man. He was untouchable, the Saviour, the recipient of Witch Weekly’s most charming smile three years running, a national treasure.
The magical aura shifted into unfamiliarity.
It was bare, aside from a couple of reports Fletcher had put together in the past five days. Draco hadn’t seen him read a single letter of them – inconsiderate prick.
“Is a luxury hotel too basic for the great Harry Potter?” Draco laid the bait, waiting for Potter to step in his snare, to snap back with the boyish bitterness Draco knew.
So, that was that. Whatever casual conversation they’d been having – their
Potter unlocked the back of the minibus, tossing Fletcher her bag, before he began casting a charm on the interior. It appeared to be a standard Undetectable Extension Charm.
“I thought this lead would be the one,” Fletcher said into the air, drawing his gaze away for a moment.
Harry’s cheeks flushed pink, he adjusted his position to better lean against Draco and nodded. “Yeah, er, I’ve never slept better.”
“A petrol station,” Potter answered as though Draco was a fool. “We wouldn’t get very far at all without refuelling.”
The room stilled as Draco looked away from Potter. It didn’t move, nothing changed, just as nothing changed at 2 am on a Thursday night. He should move, there were plenty of adequate sofas placed around the room but none of them were so perfectly adjacent to the fire, so he didn’t.
“Is Juniper asleep?” Potter asked, his eyes flickering up to the mirror that was positioned to hang from the ceiling.
The hours ticked by and Fletcher’s shoulder became a steady source of heat as the temperature plunged in the late afternoon. They watched the group, Fletcher played with her tracking spells, Draco brooded over Potter’s words, over his body.
It ceased a while later, once Draco had analysed every paint stroke of the door.
Draco stared at it. His slender fingers trailing down Harry’s arm to delicately trace its outline, the same look of disbelief crossing his expression. Always the same incredulity. Draco leaned down to press his lips to the tattoo, soft lips grazing the skin with a tremble.
Draco knew he’d have to build a semblance of friendship with both of Harry’s friends – but that was a challenge for later months (and years).
“Wise decision,” Said Harry, fighting a yawn with no success. He looked at Draco for a stolen moment then his eyes closed. “Professor Dumbledore would be proud.”
Harry tilted his head to the side, looking at Draco, all shadows and harsh angles. “Goodnight, Draco. Sleep well.”
place, he’d conjured some cushions and spread them across the stone. Against all odds, they hadn’t yet been stolen nor vandalised by any mischievous students – a miraculous feat, in fact. (Fred and George would be disappointed in their legacy)
inscriptions that Draco had to read.
Potter looked relaxed in his role, their lives at sake, his tanned hands wrapped sturdily around that wheel. His left hand occasionally dropped to a short, lumpy stick that was protruding vertically out of the elevated platform that separated their legs and shifted it into a new place, but his hands primarily stayed in the same place, moving up and down the wheel.
Draco opened his mouth, following the sinking descent of his heart, and nodded. “Right, goodbye.”
A large bottle of orange liquid was shoved in his direction, without much of a choice. Draco took it hesitantly, eyeing the plastic lining, and read the printed words.
Slender hands steered them around the teeming streets, streets that were filled less with cars and more with drunk revellers, celebrating the last evening of the weekend. Draco watched as they soared past pubs he hadn’t seen before and along roads he’d only seen from high above. It was as though they were unravelling the mystery neighbourhood Draco had never bothered to explore, his neighbourhood. In the twinkling streetlights, it was almost captivating. Then they slipped into the wizarding community within, to terrain that was far more familiar yet only a couple of streets long, and Draco was relieved to be home.
As Draco dropped to the road, Potter spoke two gentle words.
“I… don’t know,” Draco was the first to admit it. “But it felt old, that wasn’t magic from the modern world.”
It shone with a beacon of hope and Draco pulled Harry closer with a smile.
The funeral was a quiet affair.
’s lips against his skin. What a frightfully delirious situation. Not that Harry wasn’t used to it by now; Draco could easily trade the hours spent reducing Harry to a whimpering mess, with a simple kiss to his soul mark.
The infamous day itself was cold and miserable and Draco could feel the Dark Lord’s presence engraved into every wall and floorboard. It was stronger on the 25
Fletcher spotted the group another three miles downstream and silently pointed through the trees. The three of them carefully treaded around the camp’s perimeter, in sought of the best surveillance point, and settled in a slightly heighted area that still had direct oversight to the group.
The silence hung between them for a moment too long. Potter’s dangerous gaze didn’t faze Draco in the slightest as he contemplated the wisest response.
Not wanting to hear another rumour concerning his crazed outburst, he skipped dinner.
Draco, meanwhile, stared into the forest, roughly in the direction of the group.
“Really, Fletcher? The Quibbler?” Draco interjected.
The words made Draco pause in the doorway, his arms hanging limply by his sides. He almost turned, ready to argue with every bitter bone in his body. But he stopped. He resisted the temptation to look back at Potter and pushed onwards. He left Potter alone in the common room, no different from usual.
Granger and Weasley walked past their table on the train after boarding and Draco knew that only meant one thing. He glanced over his shoulder and lo behold, his eyes caught Potter’s. They were bright and he’d had a haircut, black strands of hair no longer tickling his nape.
“You see,” Potter said. “I’ve never been very good at following instructions.“
“Malfoy, it’s no trouble.” Potter caught his gaze, holding it, unafraid. So fucking stubborn. “Just tell her, yeah? Anything at all.”
Draco took it immediately, curling his fingers around crackling material. “Thanks.”
“I’m sorry, I’m not sure I know what that means.” He answered innocently and offered his hand forward to shake, a favoured custom of muggles. “I’m David Brent. I live in the village over the hill, what’s your name?”
Something niggled at him though. It was like an itch tucked behind his ribs that he couldn’t scratch.
“To be vulnerable.” Potter propped his elbow against the side of the sofa and pressed his cheek into his palm. His voice was picking up its usual tone. “I guess it’s my turn again.”
“Go on, tell me about your day,” Harry said, looking rather pleased with himself that he’d successfully cut Draco off with only so much as a glare in response. “I dare you.”
The police force couldn’t find a scrap of evidence to support any claims they might have conceived from the convict’s jumbled ramblings. Only one witch, integrated within the police, needed to step into the crime scene to detect the overwhelming dark magic that resided in the area and alert the Ministry.
“Stop calling me that!” Potter demanded, thrashing his arms in the air, his beer can narrowly missing Draco’s head. “Call me Harry, everybody else calls me Harry. Everyone knows my stupid name…”
So, even if Potter was determined to trap himself with a former Death Eater in expanded yet confined lodgings for two nights, that wasn’t Draco’s problem.
Draco supposed that should have been a question, but he could tell by the grave tone of voice that it was, in fact, a pleading statement. He swallowed. He nodded once.
He flew loops around Draco, brushing his shoulder when he flew parallel before splitting off to the closest spectator stand and shooting into the far distance. The air was filled with Harry’s laughter and soon, it mixed with Draco’s. He raced Harry around the posts and to the ground and up to the sky. He chased Harry, on his tail but never managing to push past, as he set unconventional courses, determined to thrown Draco off.
They departed, Harry at his heel once he’d managed to roll off the sofa in his disorientated state. They split as they usually did, pausing at Draco’s door. Harry didn’t say anything. He only squeezed Draco on the shoulder and left, the blanket draped over his shoulders.
Draco’s hands were roaming up and down the highs and lows of Harry’s body. His fingers were dancing across the thick fabric of Harry’s sweater, skimming the belt hooks of his faded jeans, yearning to reach even the tips of his toes (only held back by Harry himself blocking the way). Kisses were being pressed into the mess of curls on top of Harry’s head, sweet nothings murmured into his ears. Each time Draco’s hands strayed, be it to Harry’s jaw or his lips after stealing a gentle kiss, they returned loyally to the snug sweater.
Another night wasted alone. He’d be tucking himself into bed soon; oh, what a thrilling life he led.
There was no answer and no Potter. Draco slipped his shoes on, clutched his wand and paced around the van’s exterior to check for the man. No sign. Draco frowned.
If there was a single thing that caught Draco’s eye when he looked at the Dartmoor Cult, as Fletcher had officially started calling them for case consistency purposes, it was the behaviour. Many of the individuals acted like children.
“How were your holidays, Draco?” Pansy asked. Her parents were nowhere to be seen either.
- in the way he didn’t want to say it.
Despite the many, many reasons he didn’t deserve such an easily achieved peace, he wished it would return. If only so Fletcher didn’t continue casting sad looks interwoven with a hint of sadistic pleasure.
“Draco, love, you don’t call anybody by their first name.” Fletcher swiped back. “Your poor friends aren’t even offered that rare gift. Is now really the appropriate time to discuss your appalling attachment issues?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed, his defences rising steeply to their maximum height. “What are you implying, Potter? Are you trying to suggest I’m not good enough to—?"
“Congratulations, Parkinson.” Draco smiled, taking her hand to closely examine the ring. It certainly looked like 24 carat. “Who’s the lucky wizard?
Draco stared out of the window as they drove the final miles out of London. He watched as office buildings and shops gave way to houses in the suburbs and bungalows until they gave way to a higher concentration of parks and fences. They travelled along wide roads until they were surrounded by only cars and trees, huge trees that were cut back but clearly twice the size of their minibus.
“You’ve been spending far too much time with Dumbledore’s portrait,” Draco said, using his valuable choice to ignore Harry’s heavy words for a while longer. He watched Harry grin sleepily. “For now, I will choose to sleep.”
She caught up to him another ten minutes later, understanding dawning on her face upon seeing Draco, legs stretched out across the floor, a file spread out across the desk. Without a word, she smiled and left.
He had glided silently across the room before he was aware of his body moving and he opened the door. It threatened him with a low creak but ultimately revealed Harry, looking dishevelled and wearing those ridiculous yellow pyjama bottoms. He stepped into the stairwell.
Potter narrowed his eyes slightly, casually switching the minibus’ engine back on with a loud rumble, and moved his hands to settle at the top of the steering wheel. Intent on avoiding the implication of that gaze, Draco shifted his attention to the long fingers that wrapped around the wheel and fidgeted from left to right.
“Harry, I owe you an apology,” Pansy said from his right side. Her voice was charming and light, precisely designed to win over even the least susceptible recipient.
The breeze turned to the sky, sending its energy through every brick of the structure until the house stood taller, looking down at Harry.
Draco’s lips met Harry’s a little more forcefully than he intended – heat of the moment – but Harry’s mouth parted without hesitance. There was an instant heat that rose up Draco’s body, curling around his lungs and squeezing them tight, as Harry’s hands scrambled for purchase on Draco’s jacket, insistently tugging Draco closer, deeper.
“Coming?”
When Draco rose the following morning – surprised he was still alive and unhurt – he cast a long look across to Fletcher’s sleeping figure and over to Potter’s bed. It was empty. In fact, it looked like nobody had slept in it at all and Draco didn’t have enough faith in Potter’s skills to believe he perfectly made the bed after a long night of restful sleep.
Patting his hair as he sat up, Draco blinked across the room. His eyes adjusted slowly to the sunlight, drifting in and out of focus, and fell upon Potter.
“I’ll listen to whatever you have to say, Draco.” Said Harry. “Go ahead.”
So, Draco cared about enough people really. He didn’t need to wade in Potter’s problems for a feeling of self-assurance, fixing them wouldn’t elevate his low level of self-worth anyway. The public would make sure of that.
Draco lifted his eyebrows smugly, his gaze directed at Weasley. Of course he had seen Harry coming - he could probably sense Harry's presence with his eyes closed by now. But Draco had just let Granger go tumbling into her self-dug hole and hoped she’d plunge a little deeper.
When he turned up to the case 341 office on Thursday morning, there was an empty jam jar and a note. Draco frowned and picked up the latter. It read a simple,
A brown-bricked, two-story house stood before him, neglected in appearance with the overgrown moss and ivy that draped itself over every inch of free space, but it was larger than he’d expected (even with his knowledge of the Potter fortune). The windows peeked through slim gaps, dirty and grey, large cracks splitting the upper right glass frame into three parts. The chimney stack was clinging onto the final slates of the weathered roof, hovering precariously over the semi-detached garage at the far right of the driveway. But all things considered, the building wasn’t in bad shape.
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said in return, eyes scouring every inch of the walls for a history that nobody ever had the chance to tell him. His hand reached back, another soft hand sliding into it and squeezing it tight. “Don’t you think so?”
He loved Harry Potter, in all the ways love existed. In its finality and pain and joy.
Draco slept for a couple of quick hours, his body melting into the mattress. It was dreamless, meaningless; it allowed plenty of time for body restoration, but Draco still awoke. As seemed to be the trend, Potter wasn’t there when he did.
When they slumped back to the minibus at sunset, the silence was soaked in exhaustion. Draco was overwhelmed with the urge to apparate back home and crawl into his mother’s bed. He hadn’t seen her in two days, it felt far too long.
This was the implication Draco wanted Potter to fuck him into another realm.
“Not at all. Only for people like her—” Draco exhaled audibly. “People like her didn’t deserve to be demonised. They made a number of ill-informed decisions. Maybe they were trying to save their families, trying to save their own necks, Merlin knows. But Fletcher should be allowed to live without the unbearable torment.”
. I’d apologised to Luna and Weasley and Granger, even if they hadn’t accepted it, and the teachers and all the bloody house-elves I could find. I guess it all came out at once when I saw him that morning.”
. It was the spitting image of a sixth-year’s disastrous attempt at a draught of living death. Draco knew to avoid suspicious substances like these; he’d learnt that the hard way in the summer of fourth year.
Draco peered down at the writing on the packaging as he accepted the food from Fletcher.
He coughed quietly, shifting the bile in his throat.
Yet, he shook his head.
The music floating from some sort of radio in the centre became the only sound within the interior of the minibus. It was muggle music, strange tunes and raspy vocals repeating in different versions.
Harry opened his eyes.
Draco hardly had the time to contemplate what a strange name
“Harry!” He moved slightly at the sound, his shoulders tensing. Draco repeated in a whisper, “Harry…!”
. The warmth seemed to linger on his lips. And he had spent his evening trying to keep his hands by his sides, since far too often he had found them grazing his lips. He wanted to know the bumps and ridges of Harry’s lips as well as he knew his own from today alone.
“Draco—”
Winter was beginning to ease when something changed.
Fletcher’s cackle was the first sign of concession. It came from the exact spot they’d been sitting, and Draco exhaled.
The portkey jerked at his core as it threw him across the country moments later. He landed in a grubby alleyway behind the Costa coffee shop like Potter had promised.
“Ouch! Draco!”
“Yeah, all right.” Potter agreed, brushing off his trousers. “Let’s head back to the van.”
Where would the fool have gone? To watch the camp, perhaps. What a dangerous idiot he would be, to go alone and swamped in darkness.
It was only a blanket, made of wool, but Potter smiled at it the first night that he found it in his spot. He threw it across himself by hand and tucked himself in, nuzzling into the corner of the couch. And so, Draco fell into a new habit. Every night, he made a slight detour in his beeline for the couch, scooping up Potter’s blanket. And Potter would smile at it, his lips lifting sleepily. Draco wanted to know what he was thinking.
The suspects Disapparated. Potter pulled the map back out of his back pocket and located them back in Dartmoor Forest. Their strange activity had concluded, that was the only silver lining. Whatever they were completing, it was over for tonight, Draco hoped.
“Good, you might be looking at a few late nights in the upcoming months. You will both be assisting Mr Potter on the Dartmoor Forest Cult case. I want it dealt with as quickly and discreetly as possible.” Kingsley said, leaning forward on his desk, still looking ever the most intimidating guy on the entire floor despite the exhaustion. “You are not to share any of the details with your colleagues nor anybody else, this is highly confidential. Is that understood?
He was… Potter was… right here, strolling around the corner.
Draco stared in disbelief. They were wizards, they could apparate in a matter of seconds to their destination that was several
“I would say it’s no problem, but…” Draco left the room, speaking over his shoulder. “That would be a lie. Come on, then.”
She indicated to a listing of incantations on a nearby piece of parchment.
At the very beginning, fearful of finality, Draco held on with his pinky finger. The very concept of commitment was lost to him, foreign. He fled like a deer meeting its first car, curious enough to linger but far too terrified to move at first, much alike a boy falling for his first love - out of control, helplessly spinning and anticipating the bone-crushing end. Because there was always an end. To life, to love.
”I know you’re rude, bigoted and so fucking wrong sometimes that it’s painful, and I’m worse. It is possible that we can get better together though, you know:
Draco hummed in acknowledgement. “Where do you live, Ares?”
Anybody could’ve told Draco that. Weasley snored so loud that Draco could hear it clearly from his dorm room, one floor below. It was infuriating. He didn’t know how Potter had endured it for seven years. Draco wasn’t sure he’d last until the end of term.
“Well, life sucks, Potter, so—"
“Is it everything you imagined?” Draco asked, moving in line with him.
He said., “Don’t leave for work without me. We can go together.”
“For now then, we should assume they’ve remained within the same area.” Potter said, pulling off his outer robes to reveal denim jeans and a scruffy (and perhaps unwashed) t-shirt. Hardly the professionalism Shacklebolt had insisted; Draco and Fletcher both wore full suits beneath their robes, although Draco’s was more noticeably tailored.
Ms Bixley didn’t understand at that point, but she watched him leave at lunchtime with a long list of remarks jotted on her notepad.
Potter gave him a short nod, exhaustion lining the small movement. “Go for it, Malfoy.”
“He’s a pureblood! And really rather great! Even my father approves...” She blushed and the pink in her cheeks stuck. “I like him, Draco.”
“Fine,” Said Draco.
“Surely, this is enough suspicious behaviour to warrant bringing them in for questioning?” Draco whispered while his brain ran in circles, trying to figure out this group’s confusing actions. He took a bold step forward and snapped a twig in the process.
“You’re in charge of the music, Juniper.” Potter said over his shoulder.
He set to work on their dinner, using whatever he could find in the bare cupboards, and ignored Fletcher’s attempts at conversation. She stood at his shoulder regardless, watching him slice and stir and peel. The food was served forty-five minutes later, once they’d set the table and settled down.
“Right – it’s a long drive to Devon so buckle up. We’ll probably stop once or twice for lunch and some petrol. Any questions?”
That much he could agree with, quiet was bliss.
“Try it, Draco. Life isn’t fair but you can make it a little bit simpler.”
Now, Draco was no mastermind chef, but he managed to whip together a semi-decent French dish from the sparse ingredients Potter had stocked their tiny kitchen with. It was fortunate that Fletcher had set the standards so low last night, for Draco’s dish didn’t look half as appetising as he hoped. But as Potter and Fletcher took slow first bites, he was mildly relieved that neither so much as flinched at the taste.
“This is our only lead for now and it seems promising, so we’ll stick with it.” Potter said. “Of course there’ll be time to explore other leads once we return to the office on Monday.”
“That doesn’t sound fair.” Potter remarked, “A secret is worth far less than a dinner.”
“You can come in!”
“You’ve mentioned,” Harry said, almost irritably. He stared at Draco pointedly, his eyebrows lifted to emphasise something unapparent. “
“It’s your funeral, Potter.”
“Goodnight, Potter.”
“Kent?” Draco repeated, immediately striding over and towering over the map. Potter leaned forward from his relaxed position with a frown.
Draco looked across at him, finding light amusement dancing across Potter’s stretched lips and the scattering of freckles.
Then Potter entered the room, nabbing a chair a few feet from the door.
“Red tape,” He answered as though that explained everything, and continued rummaging through a nearby bush. There were twigs knotted in his hair and he looked quite uncivilised.
Ever obedient to Draco’s wishes nowadays, Harry tugged the sleeve of his sweater until it coiled in rolls around his upper arm, leaving his lower arm on show.
“Fuck you, Draco, and
“Are you going to sit there all night, Potter?” Draco asked, admittedly more snarkily than intended, after he hadn’t moved for an hour.
“There’s only one way to find out,” Potter interjected, folding the map up quickly and grabbing his cloak. “Who’s coming?”
His gut instinct was telling him they were wasting their time. Aside from an extremely strange incident with the seven-fingered convict, the group hadn’t appeared to cause any more trouble. They had an understandable diet of birds and small mammals, and had made the questionable decision to renounce from society. Besides those two general brackets of concern, Draco felt it was a little extreme to label them a cult.
He fixed a pleasant expression to his face. “Hello there.”
Draco was gone before he could conjure the effort to bite back. He stumbled further into the forest until he was a respectable distance away, before taking care of his business.
He hadn’t even quizzed Potter yet about the insane reasons they weren’t travelling by portkey or the floo or standard old Apparition. All in all, Draco was a little too bewildered to comprehend it.
“Numerous irreversible effects of an unknown curse, St Mungo’s said,” She peeled herself away from the window and moved over to the tea tray, pouring three cups of tea. “Milk and Sugar?” Fletcher and Draco shook their heads. “They said there was significant brain damage, little to nothing they could do about it though.”
He never thought he’d see the day that he missed Potter. Draco realised he’d spent his entire holidays wishing for one particular person’s company. And some of the emotions, no matter how reluctant they had been, were making sense.
He smiled.
“Hush,” Harry’s voice urged in a soft tone. He exhaled particularly heavily, the hot air grazing Draco’s knee.
Her eyes scanned the situation momentarily as she nodded, settling upon the correct response. It was a simple, “Yep. I think one of the young ‘uns had wandered out of bounds and set off one of the alerts I’d rigged.”
”Harry, who-“
“No. We’ll retreat and watch what they do.” Potter instructed firmly and Draco was reminded of the infuriating fact that he was in charge. “Now, come on, let’s find Juniper before she wanders into their warding.”
“I told you not to call me that!” He injected, the strength of his outburst toppling him forwards, his arms clutching Draco’s as he murmured into Draco’s shoulder. “Please.”
“So, they’re smart or they have ulterior motives.” Potter sighed and pulled his knees up to his chest, resting his chin on top. “When will we start getting answers?”
“I certainly would not,” Draco replied briskly. He made no move to leave and stayed in place. Potter watched him for a moment. Then he rolled his cheek back against Draco’s thigh and smiled.
The silence was broken by the obvious choice in speaker. Potter said quickly, “Kingsley’s up for promotion, did you know?”
Potter was stood at the rear of the vehicle, unlocking some small compartment in the side. He lifted a single eyebrow at Draco’s hesitance and beckoned him over.
Potter was nodding, Draco was vaguely aware of that fact, and was probably saying something to accept the apology in a noble fashion. He, meanwhile, was entirely focused on reining in his severe case of blushing. Not much availed, he kept his gaze on his porridge as Pansy made small talk. Granger asked them stilted questions and Draco provided pained answers. Harry’s foot bumped into his every once in a while, and he’d throw fleeting glances, but Draco stayed still.
The latter appeared unfazed. He walked around the couch and settled into the opposite end, ignoring the wand that followed his movements, pulling his knees up to his chest. Potter summoned a blanket from across the room in a murmured command, it settled across his body. Draco was still staring, shamelessly so, but his wand had fallen to his lap.
“Malfoy?”
Draco just nodded and Harry’s touch was gone as quick as it came, though it skimmed his lips for the briefest of moments. He clasped the door handle in his palm. “Goodnight.”
So, Harry wasted the afternoon away in Draco’s arms, the hours ticking past in their own little space. And he loved every inch of Draco against him, and every second.
“Mr Potter will be reporting to me on a fortnightly basis and he will be briefing you.” Shacklebolt looked as though he was going to say more but restrained himself. His eyes narrowed slightly in Draco’s direction instead. “I expect full professionalism for the duration of the case. You’re both dismissed.”
Potter stepped through the back doors, carrying what seemed to be a crate of canned drinks and packaged pancakes. He caught Draco’s eyes as he reached the kitchen and looked away.
And the time passed in a strange haze of note taking and reading. Fletcher pulled several books out of her backpack at one point, slapping them down on the desk and beginning to trawl the pages.
He’d ducked into the shop, still in sight behind the glass. Draco sighed and turned his attention to the contraption he was holding limply, giving it an experimental squeeze. The entire column jumped to life, a mechanical whirl making Draco jump a few inches into the air. It seemed to whizz through the long piping that connected the column to the nozzle. The fuel, he supposed.
“Because it can be beautiful.” Potter answered easily, blinking into the flashing lights of other cars. “Anyway, I’m sure Juniper would be happy to help.”
He stumbled. He wasn’t as prepared as he’d thought he was.
“What?” Harry said groggily. He lifted his hand to rub his eyes and Draco’s body went cold, not even a ghostly warmth remained on his hip.
Draco reluctantly pulled himself together for a spot of research, but he caught Potter leaving out the corner of his eye. He swore there was a light smile floating on Potter’s lips.
He wasn’t the cause of flutterings in Draco’s heart, he couldn’t be.
“Back to Potter?” Harry scoffed, “I was quite enjoying Harry.”
It wasn’t even a Weasley-made jumper. No - Harry had raided Sirius’ closet in 12 Grimmauld Place a while after the trials, once he’d gathered enough courage to step through that arching doorway once more. Amongst the few items of clothing that remained from Sirius’ adolescence and his short-lived bout of freedom, Harry found various sweaters that resembled Lupin’s taste more than his godfather’s. Either way, they’d become natural additions to Harry’s closet and hadn’t moved since.
Even still, there were ruptures and arguments. All triggered by Draco, his actions and words.
Draco tucked himself up on the sofa with a glass of wine once he’d locked the door and slumped against it for a moment, processing.
A strange sensation flooded Draco’s chest as he understood Potter’s words as a simple confession. He was being honest to Draco of all people.
Draco looked away and scoffed.
Potter parked up fully on the edge of the road, receiving a few loud beeps from cars passing by – no doubt for his shocking parking – and climbed out the car, dropping a good foot’s length to the ground.
“The dark circles and the late-night stargazing would suggest otherwise.” Draco continued and even in his tired state, a sneer came to settle on his expression. “Forgive me for asking an obvious question.”
“You really need to sleep more,” Potter whispered, his eyes scanning Draco’s with concern, disregarding the simple fact that he was the sole reason that Draco didn’t. (Well, maybe not the
“We should head back before sunset,” Potter spoke for the first time in hours as the sun ducked behind the cloud coverage. His gaze swung slowly from Fletcher to Draco to garner their reactions. “Have you managed to apply the surveillance spell for tonight, Juniper?”
“I didn’t want you to fucking die!”
Draco felt a yawn grow within himself and fought every instinct in order to keep it concealed. It won.
. Who the fuck was he if not that? But Harry’s intentions didn’t seem vicious. So, Draco absorbed Harry’s sharp glare and sighed. “Come sleep, Harry. It’s too late for this conversation.”
“Why? Is it going to change anything?” Draco snapped back quickly.
It was a momentary peace, Draco’s feet padding across the kitchen floor, his fingers sliding around a cool glass. It was a respite from the strong smell of booze and the deposits of an intoxicated stomach. Then, Draco was beside Potter again, holding the glass to his lips when he dragged his forehead upwards to offer a drunk smile.
Draco immediately narrowed his eyes, pushing away the heavy feeling of case hopelessness away and focusing on the ticks that gave away Fletcher’s lie. The discrete fidgeting, the tips of her ears flushing a deep shade of pink.
Nobody came here, even his mother only made a visit once a blue moon. His friends - the ones he had left - insisted on meeting in a public place, occasionally stumbling back to Parkinson’s for the night. Did they even know his address? Not even owls flew here.
So, it was a long seven years after the Battle of Hogwarts before Harry - having completed his Auror training and personally arresting the majority of the remaining death eaters before he swiftly resigned - received an unusual owl from the Ministry’s Percival Graves requesting his presence.
“Hey! Luna is a talented writer and active advocate in the fight for feminism,
Narrowing his eyes at the nature of the man’s behaviour, Draco opened his mouth to respond.
. “Usually the fame would wear off after all that time, but alas Potter still holds the nation’s hearts in his hands. Did you see that five-page feature that the Prophet printed on Sunday? Most of it wasn’t even true!”
His fingers wove into the long strands of Harry’s hair. It was soft, as he’d always suspected, and knotted and it danced through his fingers until Potter woke up. He dragged Draco upstairs by the same hand and delivered him to his dorm.
Anyway, Draco was somewhat content with the uninteresting life he led without any unnecessary and pointless dreams to juggle. He had plenty; he had his mother and his studies and his friends and Potter, he supposed. Although, in the eyes of the world, nobody truly had Potter.
“I’ll remind you, Draco, that it was you who mentioned the boy and proceeded to recount your entire history with him.” Ms Bixley observed him over her glasses, all-knowing and all-seeing. She raised her eyebrows. “As I’ve explained before, you are in control of our conversation. Although, perhaps this boy is somebody worth talking about.”
“I just had a conversation with one of the suspects.” Said Draco as he lowered himself back beside her and took his place once again. It was damp.
It was half-past one when Potter decided to show himself and pad across the common room with sleepy eyes and drowsy limbs. He clambered onto the centre of the couch, slinging a blanket around his shoulders.
“Let me guess, Draco slept right through it?” Fletcher cast him a dry look. “I knew you’d be a fucking heavy sleeper.”
“You want me to spend my inheritance on a pub meal?” Potter scoffed.
No matter how long he observed their behaviour and no matter how many pieces of parchment he filled with notes and remarks, he couldn’t understand.
childhood, my parents. I still do but I can’t do anything to change it, just as much as I can’t change the Dursleys.”
The comfortable quiet was easy to adjust to, Draco found, when Potter settled into his own work, scribbling away at paperwork. They didn’t say anything worthwhile, besides Potter offering to grab an extra coffee for him.
It was a relief and a respite, to have a companion. A companion that didn't stare, didn't prod at their sensitive history, didn't flinch at the slightest of movements.
“Go to bed.” Potter said, “We’ll be spending the morning reading every damn book in Juniper’s bag.”
“Get to work, the both of you.” He said instead. “I’m going to grab some lunch. Don’t cause any trouble.”
An entire weekend wasted.
Stay safe,
“I agree,” Potter said as he sauntered into the office, and Draco had to stop his jaw from slackening. He never thought he’d hear Potter of all people agree with him.
2. I have never been to Dartmoor National Park nor many of the places described - the south scares me - so my descriptions are likely to be quite inaccurate. Apologies to any resident readers.
Potter’s eyes waited, a hand on the wheel. His body was pointed towards Draco. Was that anticipation Draco sensed in his body language?
“Hey! I do not pay him that much--!” Draco began to argue, but Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office door had opened, and he halted. “Forget it. Good morning, sir.”
“Great. Let’s focus today’s investigation on finding any similar markings, ok? We’ve only got an hour of daylight left.”
They were connected, by souls, by love. By choice.
He lowered his gaze to the pot-bellied character that was printed repeatedly on Harry’s pyjamas. What use did an 18-year-old
Draco hummed to himself, still processing all the small hints this might give them. He spotted a familiar head of black hair down below and pointed. “That man, with the medium-length, black hair and dark skin.”
Percival Graves' office had been cramped, towering stacks of paperwork balancing on the four corners of the desk, but Harry had perched on the worn sofa chair quietly, accepting the bland tea that had been offered. Then, with a stern expression and flourish of apology, Graves had explained the reappearance of his grandparents’ house’s paperwork during the ongoing Ministry reform and administration system overhaul. His hands clasped on the desk, he had grimaced.
Sleep came quickly. Although, Draco’s mind still wandered as he lay there.
Draco turned away from the clearing.
“Life is not that simple.” Draco frowned and clambered to his feet, slipping his bare feet into his slippers. He began to walk away, heading for the safety of his bed where quiet would reign supreme.
Draco adjusted his stance under, what must be, Potter’s invisibility cloak as the hot touch seeping through the fabric of his robes disappeared. The steady flow of body heat from his side didn’t move though, not even as Draco stretched the cloak to its limit, taking a small step away. He tried to forget the man beside him and focused on the case.
Potter and Fletcher were already out the minibus and staring across the road with their hands on their hips by the time Draco had figured out the seatbelt’s unlocking mechanism. He yelped as it sprung free, gaining the attention of the other two.
“And yet he’s everything at the same time?” Ms Bixley remarked, scribbling on her notepad with one of those curious muggle contraptions. A pen – pointless, if you asked Draco. “I’d suggest you figure out
It was strange how easily an unusual experience can morph into a state of normality.
He dropped his book to the floor after a few minutes of feigned interest and pulled his own blanket to his chin, casting his eyes warily to Potter. Surely a few hours wouldn’t do any harm. Potter never woke anyway. Draco would be gone by the time he rose. Reassured by his own fatigued logic, Draco curled into his corner and let his eyes flutter closed. Sleep didn’t usually come easily, haunted by twisted visions and nasty thoughts, but Draco drifted toward it. It beckoned him, singing a gentle lullaby. He exhaled.
“Of course. Draco!” Fletcher not so subtly glared, beckoning him over.
“Yeah, yeah, just leave me with the riff-raff, it’s alright.” Potter interrupted, grinning at the passing waitress. “I’ll see you later, Malfoy.”
Draco laughed drily, only the once. “Especially if I couldn’t take Fletcher. She is a pain in my pompous arse for forty hours a week.”
Draco pulled his arm away from the scorching touch of Potter once they landed at the rear of the van, immediately pulling the back doors open and climbing inside. It wrapped his cold body in a bubble of solid warmth, as though he was bundled up in a blanket by a roaring fire, and Draco exhaled.
By now, Draco was quite indifferent to the ridiculous spectacle. All Potter had to do was fire a half-accurate hex at a mildly threatening squirrel and everybody in the forsaken vicinity began a round of applause, even rising to a standing ovation on one occasion. Everybody except Potter’s friends, Draco, and Juniper Fletcher.
Potter shrugged.
Potter had found him in his dusty library of loanable books, supposedly in sought of a first-edition copy of
“Harry Potter's official booty call, hm?” Draco mulled it over, mostly ignoring Harry’s comment. “I suppose that's a better title than half the bullshit everybody else claims.”
Harry succeeded for a while, until Draco unleased the competitiveness he’d been constraining (perhaps under the premise of being a gentleman). The fire ripped free inside of him and Draco reached Harry in an instant, he soared ahead, glancing over his shoulder. Harry was grinning, his eyes shining.
“Malfoy, add any of your own suggestions to the list.” Potter continued. “We’ll locate them this afternoon.”
Draco made his way around the house at his own pace, standing in doorways - his tremendous height bringing his head almost to the door frames. Occasionally adjusting his coat, he swept through each room, before finally finding Harry in the kitchen once again.
Potter and Draco swiftly shook their heads.
There was nowhere to go and nothing to do on this Saturday morning, besides stress about the countdown to NEWTs. But the room was bright and the sunlight flooded the dorms so easily in this tower; Draco couldn’t sleep, missing the perpetual darkness of the Slytherin dungeons. He even missed the people, perhaps not some of the despicable personalities. Maybe he was still one of them.
He rightfully deserved the deadly glare Fletcher shot at him. But she groaned, and under Potter’s peaked interest, she recounted the latest incident of many which ultimately led to her last relationship’s destabilisation.
They had reached the broom shed and Harry summoned his broom without a word. Draco followed suit, and before he knew it, they were soaring high above the Quidditch Pitch. The wind was whipping through his hair and curving around his body. Draco felt free. Harry was soaring nearby, weaving through imaginary obstacles and speeding past Draco once in a while with a yelled “I’ll race you!” But by the time, Draco’s mind had caught up with the words, Harry was a hundred yards ahead, laughing and looking over his shoulder.
At precisely 3:45 pm the following afternoon, the three of them arrived at the steps of Semele Residential Care and stared up at the shiny building. They were early, as Draco had insisted, and clutching the coffee Fletcher had brought in a half-hearted effort to liven them up. The coffee had enough time to kick in since the interview wasn’t scheduled to begin for another fifteen minutes.
“You saved my life too.” Potter was still talking. His eyes were on Draco. “I never thanked you for that. Thank you, Draco.”
The cloak was removed a moment later, revealing Fletcher’s grin and wild hair besides Potter’s own, plus an expression that was bordering on a smile.
It was once Potter disappeared to the toilet that Fletcher laid her snare.
So, he twisted, and he laid still. He waited for a rest that didn’t want to come.
Draco strode over, pulling the passenger door open and clambering inside. “Under the implied promise of an overtime bonus, of course I did.”
He tried to retaliate with little success; Fletcher was a master at non-verbal protego spells. When it was bordering on uncivilised, if they hadn’t long passed that line, Draco spotted something.
Then, they were trundling into Dartmoor National Park and Draco was overcome with relief. He couldn’t wait to step out of this death trap and find his land legs again.
It ought to be noted that they were wasting their own weekend and the department’s resources, at this point. These surveillance sessions were not fruitful, and their supposed work wasn’t worth a single Knut of the overtime they were claiming.
they wouldn’t see us coming.” Draco scorned, crossing his arms as he leant against the back of the sofa.
It must have been a trick of the light.
“Definitely the front,” Draco repeated, watching as Potter slid that door closed, and he walked around to the other side of the ‘
Her chatting, meanwhile, began grating on Draco’s patience after a further two hours huddled in the cold. She continued regardless, talking to herself when Potter and Draco’s murmured responses lapsed into stony silence. They were staring out at the group when the moon reached its peak.
Let it be forgotten that some sections of that statement also applied to Draco.
Surprisingly himself, Draco remained. He crouched next to Potter for twenty minutes, his hand moving up and down the length of Potter’s spine.
He shouldn’t see Potter turn up late after a long night at the pub, looking worse for wear and his glasses hanging crookedly on his nose. Draco should not see Potter’s exhaustion when they’re the only ones left in the office on a particularly late Wednesday night.
Because dreams were nothing but threats in disguise, as he’d learnt in recent months. All they ever did was lift his spirits, give him a moment to dream, only to watch them all crash and burn.
In amongst the bizarreness and complexity of the case that he had to contemplate, there was Potter’s smile. It was lodged there, in the forefront of Draco’s mind, and Merlin, Draco remembered a hundred glimpses of the same smile all at once. He’d seen it from across the Great Hall when Potter and his friends were laughing, the spitting image of a perfect high school experience – if only for a second, when the real experience hadn’t been so horrific. Potter had smiled when he played quidditch, when he snatched the snitch away from Draco with inches to spare, when he found the professors’ cheesy good luck speeches funny, when he was scheming. Some days Potter had smiled so much that not even Draco could keep count; toothy grins, tight-lipped strains of his lips, bold, delirious beams of glee. Many days he hadn’t smiled at all.
And yet, there were a thousand and one memories all slotted into that one smile. Had Draco sought to be on the receiving end all this time?
“They must have walked. Otherwise, why would they travel three miles in an entire week?” He elaborated, a small crease appearing between his eyebrows.
You were either on one side of the revelations or tou were the target.
Draco had never quite approved of the pattern, but he’d uttered far too many compliments to the way it clung to Harry’s waist and hugged his chest, that Harry had awarded it as his favourite date outfit – the second-best being no clothes at all.
He nodded stiffly, his eyes flying to Granger and Weasley. They seemed displeased when the two joined them, offering weak smiles, and huddled closer on the other side of the table. Draco was wedged between Potter and Pansy, his knees knocking together to avoid Harry’s.
Eventually, Draco’s thick skin outlived his colleagues’ perseverance and he proved himself worthy of at least a shred of their respect, with the speed that he solved cases. Back then, all he had to do was gather the evidence, write a thorough report, and send the aurors to a specific location for a straightforward arrest or two.
“Juniper wasn’t kidding about swearing in her sleep.” Potter said as he packed a few items into the cupboards and began fixing up some sort of breakfast for himself.
“For the love of Slytherin, tell me it’s not true.” She hissed at him. Draco pressed his lips together as she stared at the side of his face. “Draco. You did not scream at Harry Potter like… like an
After all, they were as different as they were the same. The past was history; Draco was a new person and Potter had changed too. They learnt this as days passed and conversations ebbed and flowed.
Several hours later, the portkey spun him to the rear of a pub. He could hear jolly singing inside, likely from drunken workers who had bunked off a full day of work. The smell of pastries drifted his way as he walked around to the front of the pub and looked up at the creaky sign.
“I’m so—” Harry interrupted himself with a deep yawn, the hot air hitting Draco’s chest as he exhaled in a rush. “—tired. But I’m happy, here with you…”
“I thought you didn’t know any of her secrets…” Potter retorted, eyes fixed on the road ahead.
Harry had come out of nowhere; one moment, Draco was taking a detour to the library, making the most of his free period with the looming pressure of exams hovering over him. He had a plan: find a seat somewhere in a dark corner of the library and ignore human existence for two hours until he wrapped his fatigued head around five of the examinable arithmancy assignments. Pansy was under specific instructions not to speak to him until the weekend.
The kettle released its final hiss, releasing a burst of steam, and provided itself at Draco’s disposal, who swiftly poured himself a cup of tea.
