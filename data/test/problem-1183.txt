Draco kissed him again, a little bit loving, a little bit naughty. “I’m very truly not.” He paused, then smirked. “Though I’m fairly certain that Weasley is going to have an aneurysm when he finds out!”
Draco sighed. “Soul bonds in an arranged marriage are coveted, but not nearly as much as political advantage in a marriage. My mother wants to bring our family back to the brink of respectability and as far away from the war as possible. The Greengrasses are traditional, proper, and completely removed from both wars.”
He walked about the room, tidying up before lunch, when he spotted an unusual object on the floor. Was he this messy when he was their age? He could hear Hermione in his brain shouting that no, he was much worse, but these kids would lose their heads if they weren’t attached. He noticed a small object on the ground near one of the desks,  He figured he’d best pick it up and store it in his desk until someone claimed it. He squatted down and examined it. It looked like someone's ancient runes project. He didn’t know much about the subject, but he did know that this crudely done work was surely not going to get a passing grade. He sighed and picked it up, when suddenly he felt himself spinning and the world went black.
peanuts in it when we were still inside on those cramped cushion chairs, and I’m
But as his eighteenth birthday approached, the King and Queen began to worry. What if Dumbledore’s enchantment failed? What if the Prince still wasted away? Neither of them could bear it. He was their only heir, and their joy. And to lose him would mean the end of their line.
Potter nodded. "She's settling in all right. I can pass on word to her you're doing okay, if you'd like?"
Draco gaped at the man. He was barely allowed to be alone in the same room as a girl, let alone kiss one…his father had always stressed not giving any woman more hold on him than she should be allowed. So all his visits with women—and girls—had been carefully chaperoned. And yet now, he was supposed to kiss one? As a dragon?
“Do you mind if we do it tomorrow, I actually have some things to do before class?” Harry asked, finishing getting dressed and swiftly heading for the door.
“And of course,
are the expert on what is right, are you not Potter? The rest of us mere mortals should worship the very earth you walk on, shouldn’t we?” Malfoy spoke a little louder, still staring at the floor.
Hermione nudged her boyfriend again before offering a more useful answer “If you mean physically, yes, I believe he would be interested. I see the way he looks at you on the rare occasions you are around. But you have to know he has been in a… may I say party mood since the beginning of the school year, so if you are looking for a serious relationship, I’m rather uncertain to what he would have to say to be honest.”
Fortunately, the cage was magical so all he had to do was manage to touch it long enough to cast the spell so it would come off. He consequently got off the bed, picked up his wand on the nightstand and waited patiently for Potter's squirming to diminish.
“I never said I wanted to kiss you.” The Slytherin gainsaid, relaxing a little. Arguing with Potter felt like a less dangerous territory.
“No”, he hissed once more. "I don't deserve to still be alive."
“Honestly, I like the nerd, I need the Dom.” Harry admitted, slowly lifting Draco’s head, looking at him with eyes full of hope.
“Why? You want out of the tiny cage Potter?”, Malfoy answered, featuring his characteristic smirk.
Everything with Malfoy was complicated and filled with ambiguous emotions. But things were also simple and real. He never felt more himself than in the Slytherin’s company. With him more than anyone else, he was not the savior. He was just a teenager, entangled in a stupid fight with the school bully, nothing more.
To his surprise, the black-haired boy laughed, before standing up too and said, a little too loudly to Draco’s liking: “No problem, Draco, sleep tight. Just don’t forget what I said on the tower. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, live a little. You said you wanted to kiss me that night, well here I am! Seriously Malfoy, I can’t be more obvious.”
It made him think back. It was now November. He had been back in Hogwarts for more than 2 months now and not a single one of the teenagers in this room had tried to have a go at him. Not an insult, not a jinx, nothing. And now that he was really looking at all of them for the first time, he could easily understand why.
They both took their position and bowed appropriately. Granger casted a Cautio almost immediately so Draco couldn’t cast small jinxes anymore and thus forcing him to cast stronger hexes.
They were not ignoring him in particular; they were ignoring the past in general. It was so obvious now. Everybody here had decided that they all well deserved to be stupid reckless kids. To finally live the adolescence they had been so violently deprived of. Because of the Dark Lord and his followers. "Because of me." he couldn't help but whisper to himself.
'Because it's what I do', he thought. Yes My Lord, I'll do as you asked. Yes father, I will honor the Malfoy family.
Harry thought of Snape, whom he had hated so much. Sometimes even more than Voldemort himself. Snape who had switched sides and was also a broken man. Not unlike the stunning blond boy sitting in front of him.
“You mean using Potter as a DADA tutor so I can take naps during Lukewarm’s lectures? I still can’t believe he hasn’t noticed it yet. Last week, I argued that the disarming charm made orange light so I could see him do it from up front.”
Harry took the arm off his lover’s eyes and started stroking his mark again. “Like you weren’t using me?”, he pointed out.
“I wouldn’t mind being back in the cage. Got me crazy horny all the time.” Harry practically begged, directly sending all the blood in Draco’s body to his cock.
Malfoy shrugged. “I would.”
‘Here goes nothing’. Draco whispered to himself, still looking straight at Potter before casting: “EXPECTO PATRONUM!!!”.
Both boys took place to start the duel. “On the count of 3?” Harry asked. “Fine by me.” Draco answered with a sneer.
Harry had absolutely no clue how Malfoy had guessed his plan so thoroughly. Maybe he was a powerful legilimens.  Maybe he was actually capable of empathy.  (The first one was way more likely). He decided to let it go and simply nodded.
That same boy quickly sat up the bed and screamed: “I beg you pardon???”
Harry obviously had not thought about that.
“Never mind, I should just go, I have class.” Harry finally replied, quickly getting up and picking up his clothes from the floor.
“Voldemort’s last orders for us were to get into a glorified freighter and follow your ship, sending out a long-range message to something called the ‘Caretaker’ in the hopes it would kill you,” Malfoy said. “It was a suicide mission. But it was either that or face down Voldemort’s own private brand of justice for the disloyal. It was an easy choice.”
As Draco lay panting and satiated in Harry’s arms, the magic of their bond tingling around them, he smiled.
Draco sighed, and decided that maybe he needed a bit of a rest as well.
“What guilt could you possibly have? I don’t recall hearing of you torturing muggles to satisfy some evil bastard’s kinks.”, the Slytherin probed, glaring at Harry like he was insane.
And now, they were all laughing and drinking and eating, together. They were all happy, together. While
They were all to duel one pairing after the other, so they could all watch and learn. It was way more official than what they usually did in that class and it was putting Draco on edge. Granger, having been in close encounter of Potter’s magic for years, would annihilate him.
Draco was sitting in the middle of the eight-year common room. Not far from him, Finnigan was telling an apparently very funny story to... heck he couldn't recall half of their names. Hufflepuff boy number three, big nose Ravenclaw girl... and what were the twins’ names again? He remembered thinking every single one of them was
“Why not? We already know we are sexually compatible; we just had a very non life threatening conversation, you obviously like me and I do recall mentioning I like your nerdy side like 3 seconds ago. Plus, we could talk about our shrink visits and I could tell you about all the Slytherin more or less legal things I did here over the years.” Harry accepted.
The night was over.
“By the way, I cried earlier because the pain was so grand that it made my guilt go away completely. That had never happened before. But when you stopped it came crawling back and it was a horrible feeling. But it was not your fault.” Harry finalized.
“The next step of what, I might ask?” Malfoy inquired, getting more impatient by the minute.
“Why do you think I stopped today? Why do you think I took off the cock cage??”
“Why didn’t you tell me?”, Draco insisted, but with a gentler tone.
“Great, because I’m not sure I can have anymore rough sex with you if you don’t. I need to know my partner fully consents to what we are doing. Not just accept it even though he hates it so he doesn’t go insane.” Draco firmly demanded, finally looking straight into Harry’s eyes.
“You saved my life as well. We’re even Potter. Don’t play the savior hero card with me, the last thing I need right now is your pity.” Malfoy hissed; his grey eyes fixed on the grey floor. He was dressed in white shirt and trousers that were about 3 sizes too big. He was indeed pitiful, but Harry was not about to tell him that. He took a large breath and said:
“So where do we go from here? I’m not sure I can keep this up now that I know of all your inner... I will say, struggle.” Harry was still holding his chin in place, but the grey eyes were quickly moving around to not look at the green ones.
Draco got the message so instead of replying something even more obnoxious, took a deep breath and hunched himself on the table, not unlike how you act when you need to explain something trivial to a 6 year old kid:
He started paying more attention during Longbottom and Weasley’s duel. It was actually quite interesting to watch. They couldn’t be more opposite. Longbottom was fierce and kept casting powerful attack spells but was getting tired from never defending himself. Weasley was a lot more calculating, took his time before casting and was clearly thinking ahead. Weasley finally won after casting back to back Impedimenta and Petrificus Totalus. The first one having slowed down Longbottom too much to dodge or block the full-body bind. Draco was actually impressed by the clever way Weasley had played this.
“If we walk hand in hand, people will see”, Draco hesitated.
Then Potter let go of him. He still had that look. Draco knew at that moment that they would talk about this again. There was so much to say. So much history between them.  So much things he knew Harry hadn't told him about the war. So much to apologize for. But not tonight.
“Your patronus is a stag”, he stated, looking at him with wide green eyes.
“Of course, the great Savior of the world would accept to help a Death Eater get better at defending himself. Don’t kid yourself Granger. This year in Hogwarts is only a delayed sentence for me. The minute I’m out of here, I’m dead. Unless I learn to properly defend myself. And who else is better to teach me how than the DADA king?”
“You seem far away suddenly Malfoy. Are you okay?” Harry inquired looking genuinely concerned.
In short, it was working. Malfoy was resurrecting before his very eyes. It was so beautiful to watch.
"I do know." Harry said, quickly touching Draco's arm with a giant grin before going back to his umpire spot.
So Harry did the only think he knew out to do: he acted. Turned around swiftly, grabbed Malfoy by the collar once again, and kissed him passionately.
But for all that to happen, the Slytherin prince needed to be shocked awake, if only to solidify their plan to get him out of that cell.
“Yeah. Hermione had been suggesting it to me for months now. But I’ve been able to avoid doing it, mostly because of you. If the horniness the cage gave me goes away, I might not have a choice.” Harry admitted.
That made Draco go back to that day in the common room when he had asked Harry to suck
Harry finally grasped on what was happening. He had flirted with Malfoy to wake him up. The Slytherin had liked it. Then realised it was not real and got mad. Malfoy fancied him. Romantically. The revelation made him go for the truth.
Arrived at their bedroom doors, they finally looked at each other for the first time since the kiss, their eyes once again in union, filled with the same question: to whether or not speak. As if other words would kill the moment. The new day should bring things back to normal, with them ignoring each other or shouting insults at each other.
choices.
"I think you moving on is not about being told you did the right thing or not. It's about you accepting that you took that decision and that there is nothing you can do to change that. You can't live your whole life thinking about what ifs Draco, that's not healthy... just move on."
He said it hundreds of times a day.
Harry Potter was not good at reading the universe signals, but somehow knew in that particular moment that they would not be disturbed. No one would walk in, no one would catch them in a loving embrace and no scandal would break out the next morning.
"No Potter, let me stop you right there. I don't need to hear for the hundredth time : it's complicated, you were a kid and so on. I made the rational decision to save the lives of my family and myself. And I need someone, no, I need YOU to tell me I did the right thing. That NO, I shouldn't have denied the dark lord. Please Harry, I'm begging you, you're right, I can't stay on that tower forever."
“Well you
"Hum… well actually, regarding that…" Draco blurted while Hermione was nudging Ron quite hard for asking such a private question. But Draco couldn’t take this awkwardness anymore, he had to ask: "I'm very sorry but… you two are not angry at me? Or even suspicious or I don't know. I don't understand how you're not convinced I'm planning on maliciously seducing him in order to eventually kill him in his sleep or something?”
Malfoy had explained that last part with an ambiguous look in his eyes. In one way he sounded more of himself, more assured. In another, he sounded defeated, resigned, knowing their plan was not compelling enough for the Wizengamot.
“So this is over then?”, Harry implored.
“I have to admit… it is fun. I…”
Draco Malfoy – Hermione Granger
Harry walked towards him and touched his forearm. “To be clear, that doesn’t mean I think you should rot here", he insisted cautiously. He could feel the need for Malfoy to jerk his arm off of his touch, but he didn't. Harry smiled, and backed off. It was a start.
The Slytherin still had not replied to the threat. He could think of a million snarky things to say but all of them seemed to have the potential to make things escalate to a level neither of them wanted to go to.
He then finally channeled enough courage to take a couple steps back towards the dorm rooms. Still facing him, he breathed: “I can’t Harry. Us kissing is a terrible idea. I hope you understand.”
He then turned around and painfully walked the longest 10 feet of his life, leaving a very horny and baffled green-eyed boy behind him.
, just didn’t seem possible for them.
Malfoy stood slowly, not half as affected as Harry had hoped. “Really, I don’t see it”, he answered, turning around his chair to try and catch the invisible spider, and thus falling into Harry’s trap.
him. Hard.
“Leave that to me Potter. I have a plan. Then we can go and convince the wizarding world that the nice Gryffindors and bad Slytherins can be friends. It will work. But you better not be messing with me and flirt with me just to make
Harry had voiced his clarifications in the most relaxed and comfortable way. That actually freaked Draco more than the words he had spoken.
That finally got Draco's attention back to the couple. He could only blink at the Gryffindor boy. “What? I mean the point is to help him figure out how he feels, I guessed it could be great to start there. Less feelings, less complicated. And perhaps he doesn’t even like Harry. He may just think he has a nice arse or something”, Ron blurted, looking at his girlfriend like the blond wasn’t there.
It was now his turn. If the Weasel was that good, Granger would make him eat his own balls. The only way out of this was cheating.
Malfoy finally opened his eyes. He looked malicious and cunning and ready for battle. He was mesmerizing. He took Harry's breath away.
“Well that’s good enough for me”, Ron answered with a little smile.
Is every person that was on Voldemort’s side a bad person? Harry was not so sure anymore.
“I don’t pity you Malfoy. To be honest, I don’t give much of a shit about you, I’m just trying to do the right thing. You, rotting in here isn’t right.”
“You know the lubing spell worn out by accident; you have to know I never meant to shag you dry on purpose. I would never do that Potter.” Draco explained slowly, never taking his eyes off Harry.
“No, I won’t take the dark mark.”
“Back so soon Potter? Hufflepuff girls all have your autographs? The Minister wasn’t available for a pint on a Tuesday night? With so charged an agenda, I’m surprised you ever get any sleep at all.”
There was music playing when they got to this square.

“Er,” Harry looked at the pile of fan mail and presents that had been collecting in the corner of his office since the start of December. “I’m not sure?”
He wouldn’t do only that, really. With his face so close to the wing, the wind was somehow louder, faster. But Harry was a professional. He could cast a Jelly-legs Jinx and an
“I mean, you said that, but I thought you were in a snit,” Harry said. “Are you serious? Why wouldn’t we go?”
“What do you mean?”
He could hear it through the pipes.
“Done with you?” Harry said. “What makes you think I’m done with you?”
about me.”
“Don’t laugh. You know I’d rather not get any at all. You were the one who dismantled the Curse Bomb that got sent to me last year!”
territory on less than twenty-four hour’s notice. Harry and Draco had dealt with much worse in the past, both together and individually, both as partners and before they were even adults. Harry and Draco were the best Auror team in the Ministry, and a small detour from inside the plane to outside wouldn’t stop them.
Draco rolled his eyes. Yes, Harry Potter was brave and loyal and rudely attractive, but it was a miracle that mouth of his had yet to get him killed. “Any tart retorts to help suss out
Every part of Harry was shaking. His legs, his fingers, his heart. “I… don’t know what I’ll do.”
It was absolutely silent, other than the rustle of fabric, but it hadn’t
. Harry had trained with them all, excelled at them all, and the fact that Malfoy was entering at a disadvantage was no secret to either of them.
“Given my treatment since I became your guest, I think I’ve earned plenty,” Harry said. The pool of ichor he was in had risen up to his collarbones by now, oozing through his skin and seeping deep into his bones. He was immobilized, alone, and at the mercy of a kidnapping, murdering, not-human entity he knew basically nothing about. If he somehow did manage to get out of this, Draco will probably tear him a new one for getting into this mess.
“How…” Harry swallowed, tried sucking in air once again. “How do you even send it? Do the Fae use owls these days?”
“Potter, what the bloody hell is this?”
we could have been sitting down together to read
“Right. That’s good,” Harry said, “because I think I’m going to black out now.”
“Give or take,” Draco said. He set up the standard set of monitoring spells around Harry, added four more for his own peace of mind and then grabbed Harry’s file. “It was after hours when Filch found you unconscious in the empty Defence classroom. There were no witnesses, no spell damage, and no signs of an attack, but all of your vitals have been steadily dropping since you were found.”
next big story. Draco had made the following two years of lost days less terrifying, purposefully talking to Harry about everything from PTSD to Muggle candy, and ushering in every Wednesday with his precision record-keeping and ludicrous notes:
much of a tiff.”
Harry reached for Draco’s hand, and Draco just let his fingers get pulled into the grip. The pressure on his sternum had swelled into a churning in his belly as well, and Draco’s heart refused to pinpoint why.
“That’s why everyone is avoiding the case.”
Draco blinked. “What?”
“It’s a

are standing on the wing, dodging curses from Canadian wizards. If you dare try to convince me that this is how the Muggles do it, I swear I will launch you right off this thing.”
Draco reached for his hand.
A collective groan sounded through the classroom. “Yes, well, life is hard, get over it.” Harry chuckled, remembering those days of essay writing and desperately trying to write bigger to reach the parchment length faster.
And he did. Harry knew exactly what he had to do.
“Er, no,” she said. “But you told us to tell you immediately if Mister Potter woke up.”
Malfoy’s fingers were overly slick as they flicked against his arsehole and pressed in, steady, sure. The breach brought back the same roaring feeling from before, the avalanche, the symphony. Harry lost himself to it, the feeling of Malfoy filling him, of lips and tongue and teeth. He let Malfoy mark him, posses him, claim him; he let himself have the first real moment in his life where he could prioritize his pleasure over his obligations, his responsibilities, his burden.
Potter blinked, and looked over at the door where Draco was standing. “Malfoy! I didn’t realize you were here. It’s the middle of the night on a Friday. I thought I was the only one around.”
Draco needed to focus on his breathing. On the pressing pain that squeezed against his sternum. He couldn’t care this much about what happens to Harry,
“But this doesn’t complete the bond, it’s not at sunset by the Great Lake,” Harry whispered, eyes closed.

to see where it went. But it was pretty clear that Draco wanted it to go so much further than Harry did. Draco wanted everything to change. He kept walking.
Draco snorted.
It was everything. It was too much. The heat of Malfoy’s mouth, the pressure of Malfoy’s fingers, the cluster of revelations casually tossed at Harry’s feet. They could never be what they were, not after this. But they could forge something new, perhaps. Something mighty.
“St. Petersburg has
you’re stuck with here. Your only hope when we get out of here is to tell everyone I’ve tricked you with my Death Eater ways into keeping me company. Or just use your favourite line when people see us: it’s a coincidence! We just ran into each other!”
“Absolutely nothing. Again my magic was never pulled. You just got lucky, well, relatively speaking. I’m not sure if you would consider this situation lucky. Had I not happened to cross your path, I never would have been aware or felt that anything was wrong with you. I wasn’t in the bond.”
“Pay attention, mate,” Ron said. “They’ve finished debating the theory bits and they’re ready to tell us what the problem is in words we understand.”
Harry nearly snarled. He hoped Malfoy’s skin would bruise, a harsh blue ring around his neck that would stay visible above the flash of Command gold.
Of course, he and Ginny had actually been dating at the time, official acknowledgement from the

“No.”
The next morning was another morning of gently shifting around each other in the kitchen as they made tea, after they had carefully skirted each other in the bathroom, making even less eye contact through the shower steam. Only a dozen letters came through the post that morning, and only ten of those were from concerned fans, angry fans, or inquisitive reporters.
Yesterday morning, Harry had burst into their office, triumphant. “We got the smuggler case!”
Draco narrowed his eyes because he wasn’t a damned princess, but he couldn’t just leave the adorable imbecile stuck like that. He took the arm.
“Your fault for not agreeing to go to Fiji,” Harry said, peering over Draco’s shoulder. “It’s odd that he didn’t mention your name. I put it down with mine on all the forms.”
“I think the odds of me surviving a fall into the big emptiness were really, really slim,” Harry said. “So naturally, surviving was unavoidable.”
“Are you mad?” Draco asked, a bite in his voice that had been absent for years. “Who even wants flowers stuck here at the arse end of the castle? My students have potions that need to sit in the moonlight, and you’re going to block my fucking windows with shrubs?”
“Draco,” Harry said, “I would have bloody remembered you telling me you loved me at
“Not if I can help it,” Draco said. He turned to Harry. “If it’s all right with you, I’m taking you home.”
They straightened their clothes and made their way to the kitchens, “Good Morning, Victoria.”
for Harry Potter. And then you’ll go.” He shook his head at Harry’s stunned face. “Can I have a roll, please?”
Goosebumps immediately covered his thighs as the air touched the exposed skin. His cock was already dripping precome, the pearly line of it stretching down from the rigid tip to hang past Malfoy’s chin. The situation was intoxicating, in a way Harry wasn’t able to put words to, and the heady mix of power and deferral and redefined boundaries made his head feel full of gossamer and sparklers.

on Harry. Not only was he bored out of his mind of being trapped inside the hospital room (the only comfort being the visiting hours, when Hermione would turn up with books on the subject of old soulmate lore), but he had soon begun to feel a distinct pull towards Draco. Whenever they were alone, Harry had to fight the urge to go over to Draco’s bed and curl up against him. Harry had thought about asking for a screen to put up between their beds, to keep him from staring at Draco, but that had seemed silly and he had dropped the idea.
“I’m sorry, Professor Potter,” Sam said in a tiny voice. “I just really wanted to find my soulmate.”
“Ugh,” Harry said. “There’s

hallucination that wouldn't leave him alone. He was keeping his head down.
“That’s fine,” Harry said. “Narcissus doesn’t bloom ’til spring. We’ve got the winter.”
Draco smiled, “Ok, well, now it’s different, when you lost your balance, the worst that would have happened would have been maybe you’d have slid off the bed a bit. You weren’t in any danger, I did it to steady you, just to be helpful. It was different.”
“I’ve got good new and bad news, then,” Harry said. “Because if you love me, I have absolutely no intention of rejecting you. But you’ll have to give up all your rehearsals. You’re out of Tuesdays, so it’s one shot at everything now.”
It must have worked, because with a soft flutter, blue words appeared in front of them:
Like a commanding officer should.
Harry did, and let himself stare into those clever grey eyes. They were so calm, offering so much more stability than whatever it was roaring under Harry’s skin. He took a breath and kept staring, until he could see it, the feverish burn deep inside Malfoy’s eyes. What they were doing was capsizing everything for Malfoy, too, taking the familiar and forging it into something molten and new. But Malfoy handled it with poise, with confidence, with authority.
and all. Things were very different here. Harry and Draco went to Quidditch matches together on weekends, got curry together, crashed on each others’ couch, and stole each others’ cold tea during long cases. But they weren’t together. There had never even been a hint of it — no drunken half-confession, no tentative bump of fingers against each other, no charged near-kiss under the mistletoe. He wanted it, though. Harry proposed to Draco because his instinct felt like this was the most right thing to do in the world, and Draco was going to murder him for it.
, which means you’re just showing off to get your knickers out of their twist.” He stumbled as the plane bounced, missed with his
Harry frowned. “Sorry. Didn’t mean it like that. It’s just, if I woke up in quarantine, and
“It’s not? Bummer. Does this mean I have to kiss you again?”
In reality, Harry and Draco just played a lot of Exploding Snap, because after one disastrous attempt at Wizard’s Chess, Draco refused to play with anyone other than Ron.
Draco paused. He wanted, he
“I don’t?” Harry sighed, nipping at Draco’s lower lip.
“A whole pile of presents for Our Saviour, after all this time?”
The dishes had seemed simple enough—right until the moment he’d pulled the bowl from the water and noticed that it had food still clinging to it. And not only that, but that there was food along the outside of the stupid thing as well, now. He’d stuck it back in the water, wincing with disgust as he put his hands in the dirty pail with it, then began to try to wipe it clean under the water.
"You witnessed this, Mister Potter?"
“How many?”
Draco sighed. He supposed it was true. After all, Lord Voldemort was gone. And the Malfoys had chosen each other over him at the end. “And…when would you want to move in?” he asked.
for Harry, just pointed out someone of Harry’s size for her to estimate from. The robes weren’t finished until the very day of the ball, and Draco had no time to take the robes to his friend in person, so he sent his page to deliver them to Harry, and hoped that they would get to him in time.
She sighed. “Fine. But this…isn’t going to fit him. It’s made for a woman!”
He ended up throwing a bunch of things in the pot, then stirring it, but at the end, it looked rather grey and gross. He wouldn’t have wanted to eat it himself, and he highly doubted Potter would either. Chancing a bit more magic, he closed his eyes and pictured his own favorite meal—a stuffed pheasant with potatoes and greens. When he opened his eyes, the food in the pot was still stew, but it looked far more edible, at least…
Draco’s mother looked around. “But…where is your entourage? Surely you didn’t come all this way alone?”
Potter reached through the bars, pointing his wand at Draco. "If you say one more word, Malfoy…"
But oh, how he wanted it.
Draco nodded. “So you force father to insist that I come live with you…”
Harry frowned for a moment, then nodded. "Yeah."
Draco smiled, then settled back and continued the story once more.
“Yes, Harry.”
"Very well. Mister Potter, I believe you had something to add?"
"There's no proof. And even if I did, I wouldn't. For you."
Draco felt a wash of relief when his father appeared from the midst of the crowd. “Who are you, and why did you bring a dragon here?” he asked, and Draco could hear the growl just below the surface of his words.
"Wait. You knew it was me? And you didn't mind?" Draco felt a bit dizzy. Was he breathing? Maybe he'd passed out somewhere back there and this was all an hallucination?
Draco nudged Harry’s shoulder with his head, and Harry turned to blink at him. “What, Draco? Did you need something?”
Draco smiled. “I’ve always been good with horses.”
As time drew closer to the Prince’s birthday, the King and Queen began to find ways to keep their son inside. He had fittings. He needed to pick the menu. His father wanted to have him attend regular meetings with ambassadors or counselors he didn’t have time to meet himself. And always, they made certain Draco was never alone. Even at night, one or both of his personal guards stood at the door to his personal tower. No one would hurt their son. Not if they could help it.
Draco bristled, but said nothing. Too soon. He couldn’t risk his only chance.
“What, Moony? I mean…look at James! Look at what happened to him! He trusted Peter, and what did that rat do? He sold him out!” Sirius turned back to Harry. “Friendship counts as nothing. You need to protect yourself. Besides…it wasn’t like Lucius was in a rush to help your father when Lord Voldemort tried to take over his land…”
Twelve invitations were sent out to all corners of the land, inviting the great witches and wizards, but in all their plans, there was one they neglected. The same wizard who had helped them conceive a child. He was a wizard most did their best to avoid, for he was bitter and dark, and usually more inclined to cause misery and sorrow than joy. So despite his help, the King felt it best not to invite him with the rest. When the wizard heard of the Prince’s birth, but no invitation arrived, he decided to make his displeasure known.
“Harry, I really don’t think this is a good idea…” he growled as Potter passed him.
“Quite a bit,” Lucius growled, turning to his son. “I will give you five minutes. If you have not returned with the prince in that amount of time, I will be coming after you.”
Robards scowled down at him. "Despite Snape's dubious affiliations, this boy still had a hand in the headmaster's death."
Harry smiled, too, pleased that Draco didn’t seem upset any longer. “I guess so. And…I can’t imagine this with any other guy, Draco. Just you.”
“Ah…fuck…Draco…oh…” Harry’s hands settled on Draco’s hips, pulling him down against him as they moved together. “Yeah.”
He turned back to the stricken couple. The Queen was clinging to her husband, tears streaking her face. “Please,” she begged.
Draco felt his breath speed up at that. Someone else who suspected the true story behind the feud between their two kingdoms? It was too good to be true. “I…did. I simply didn’t realize any Gryffindor would ever admit to it.”
Draco’s heart did a leap at that. “What?” Harry was…waiting for him?
Soon Draco was chafing under these restrictions. He was quite a clever young man, and he knew that something was bothering his parents. But as his father had forbidden any mention of the Prince’s fate, he was simply unaware of his impending fate.
Potter frowned. "I can't pass on any substantive messages, Draco. I could get into real trouble if I did."
“Yeah,” Harry said, a soft smile answering Draco’s.
“Obviously, it does to you, Draco,” Harry said softly. Draco looked up to see Harry standing at his shoulder.
“Diagon Alley. Madam Malkins. The Hogwarts Express, even. Are you saying someone twisted your arm for that?”
“He’s not. I just…” Harry looks around, as though he hopes Draco will pop out and shout ‘surprise!’ but he does not. “I wanted to talk to you about him.”
Then Potter had stopped the others. "No. Mrs Malfoy helped me. And I doubt she was doing more than standing here with her family."
"Wait…‘she says?’ You don’t know?"
The Queen stumbled forward, taking up her son in her arms and weeping loudly.
Harry’s eyes were narrowing now. “What if I said I might be able to convince him?”
“Draco? Are you all right, sweetness?” his mother asked when he appeared, brushing some hair from his forehead.
Potter frowned. "Stories?"
In only a matter of moments, Draco appears in the living room of the flat, his bags beside him. “See you around, Potter,” he says, and then he is gone.
“Ohgod…” Harry’s eyes closed, his hips jerking up at the contact.
Draco glanced back and forth between Harry and his father. Lucius did seem to be accepting this far too easily. And while he’d been scolded for playing with Harry as a boy, now that Draco thought about it, he’d gotten off then far too easily. He couldn’t help wondering if his father had, indeed, known who Harry was all along. “Besides. It’s too late, father. He is my First. Or…he was.”
The dark wizard turned to glare at the man who had spoken, then laughed. “Dumbledore? Are you their protector now? Go home, old man. Your power is fading. You can’t save them.”
“You mean, your room?”
Mother and Severus tried to argue me against it, but I was long set on my path by then, and nothing they could have said would have changed my mind.
Potter came back down the steps until they were face to face again. There was an expression in Potter’s eyes Draco had never seen before. He tried to ignore it. “Isn’t it obvious, Draco?”
"Of course, Malfoy. I promised."
"I could try to help…"
After that, both seemed to tacitly agree that silence would be better. After all, if they were overheard…
“No! Why?”
Potter shook his head. “Actually, your father gave them to me. And…well…you see how small my home is. It’s not like all of it could fit in there anyway…”
A smile grew on Potter’s face. “Why? Am I making you uncomfortable, Draco?”
Draco smiled. "Wouldn't miss it for the world." He wished he could see the other boy's features, but through these masks, nothing was distinguishable. But then, he might have put this off again. And it overdue. "Could we go someplace more private? Talk?" he asked, fighting back his own nervousness.
“What do you mean he’s asked after me? Have I done something wrong?”
Sirius made a face. “That’s not the same thing at all, Dumbledore!”
Draco felt Harriet still beside him, and shifted his hand, pulling her gently with him. “It’s all right. He’s not as bad as he seems. Really.”
Before Draco could continue, Potter shook his head. "I can't, Malfoy. I need to do another round before my replacement gets here. Next time?"
Draco blinked. "He did? When?"
“And children?” she asked him shrilly. “How do you intend to have heirs with another man?”
It worked.
already.
The problem was, now that he was here, facing Harry—Potter, he thought to himself insistently—he couldn’t figure out how to start. He decided to start with his wand, pulling it out of the pocket he’d stored it in. “Did you want it?” he asked, handing it over, handle-first.
dream…”
"I'll let you know." He was watching Draco now, which made him nervous. He covered his reaction by settling at the table in the centre of the room. The chair wasn't comfortable, but at least it wasn't his bunk. He tried to be grateful for the change of scenery. Even if it was just more grey walls.
“Excuse me?” How dare this idiot insult him so? “Do you know who it is you’re speaking to?”
He moved to his own side of the bed, hanging his robe up before slipping under the covers, then, not looking at Potter at all, shut off the light. “Just…stay on your side, all right?”
"Like no bird I ever smelled," Fenrir growled.
Once Draco finished his story, short as it was, both of them were silent for a time.
“Yes! Because I thought I was going home!”
Draco flushed. Even though he'd hoped Harry might get the message, he hadn't considered how he might react. "Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you."
Harry didn’t seem to want to slow, though. And really, Draco wasn’t about to stop him. "How far do we have to go?" he asked.
Draco nodded. “True.” He looked up to meet Harry’s eyes again. “So…you aren’t disgusted by it?”
Harry smiled. “I promised, didn’t I?”
Because there was obviously more to it than even Draco had realized, and with the retellings, the feeling of that last dream was growing inside him. As was the urge to lean over and kiss Harry to find out if it really felt as good as it had in his dreams. “I don’t know…”
Draco turned to glower at him. “No one asked you to, Potter.”
Draco wasn't sure he believed him, but the threat wasn't going to stop him. It was the only entertainment left, and he wasn't about to give that up until it was taken from him. "No? You think not?"
Draco turned, and saw that the woman was clinging to her husband again. "I’m sorry. I can’t be…this. What you need. You have two sons to take over. I’ll be back. When I’m ready." Then he turned and ran down the stairs. "Harry! Wait for me!"
Kingsley smiled, which only confused Draco more. "And for the record, you are?"
, Draco. It was
Draco wasn’t sure whether he should be relieved or not. As of yet, he hadn’t touched on Harriet’s true identity. “What exactly are you implying, Severus?” He used the man’s first name pointedly, hoping it would quiet him.
One day, a young king came to court Draco for his own. The king was from a far-distant kingdom called Gryffindor, and he had traveled a great distance to meet the prince and woo him. Upon arriving, he went directly to the throne room to meet the king and his son. When Draco saw the state of the man, he refused even to speak with him. The king’s hair was grubby and bedraggled, and a thick beard covered his face. Even worse, he still wore his stained traveling leathers.
"We were never friends." His benefactor paused, realizing what he'd said. "Look, I can't trust you. You've proven that. This doesn't exactly help matters."
"I meant…"
“But that’s assuming you wouldn’t choose the person you want to be with, Draco.”
"Please… can't you stay, at least?"
“Indeed.” She glanced back at Harriet. “Very well. And how many heirs do you intend to bear my son?”
“He’s busy,” she said with a slight scowl. “Come back another time.”
He regarded Harry's hand for a long time before taking it, squeezing it in his own. "I'd like that."
“He did? And you…why? You know…” Potter’s voice dropped, and Draco shifted closer, trying to stay hidden but get close enough to catch their words.
There was some shuffling behind the door, then it opened slowly. “Draco?”
It wasn't an official fact, but many began to speculate on Harry's preferences, though no one had direct experience since the Weaslette and Cho Chang left the picture. Draco himself couldn't help but hope. This year, he might finally have a real chance.
"It's fine. If you don't mind, I'd rather not banter with you today. I'm not exactly in the mood."
“Be careful there, Harry…their court isn’t like home. And…who knows what they’ll think when you arrive with their Prince who’s suddenly a dangerous beast…”
Part of Draco wanted to deny someone could force him, even Voldemort. But he'd also expected no one would believe him if he'd said the spells had been used under duress. "It did, sir," he finally managed.
As it was, he was only able to force himself to dance with a small handful of partners before he made his way to where his parents were sitting on their dais, watching the dancers.
“Well, whatever you thought, it was obviously wrong.”
“Just one more? If you’re still feeling uncomfortable, then…you can go. Okay?”
"Right." The problem was, now he had the chance, he didn't know what to tell Potter. "Um… did you want to hear anything in particular?"
"I think you have something of mine,
“Is it really that bad?”
Twinkling eyes met grey. “I assure you, my lord, you will not,” the wizard said with a smile. He turned to the Queen. “If I may, highness?”
“Why would I want you dreaming about me, Malfoy? We hate each other!”
But there's another part to the story. Do you know that bit? About what else was in Pandora's box? Ah, well, that happened, too. And because of it, because I finally understood, everything changed again.
All he could do now was hope he found someone who wasn’t scared of dragons. Or who would at least allow him a chance. Better still if they were coming to the palace for the feast.
The wizard shook his head sadly. “Unfortunately, that is something I am unable to do. No wizard can completely undo that which another has done. But I can weaken the effects enough until someone can find a way to break the spell, sire. If you will allow?”
“Maybe…” Sirius met Draco’s eyes, and Draco nodded to say that Harry’s words were exactly what he’d meant. After all, right now, Draco felt like they were his only friends in the world.
his feet were about to fall off, they arrived. Unfortunately, when he saw the peasant’s home, he began to wish the trip had never ended. Better that than to live in a place like this.
The next morning, he woke up in his own bed. He had no memory of the other boy or even their visit to the beach that summer.
The young man nodded. “So you all keep telling me. I wish I’d met him.”
Draco was shocked. He'd expected to have to fight harder. "Really?"
So it came to pass, the war of Voldemort ended. Harry Potter was victorious, as he was always meant to be, the Wizarding World was safe, and those who served the Dark Lord were rounded up for trial. At least, those who remained.
Draco blinked. “And she chooses to look like that?” he asked with a bit of a sneer.
Draco nodded again.
But forever ends quicker than most people think. Particularly in terms of “happily ever after.”
Draco realized nothing he could say would help. He took a last look at Harry, trying to apologize to the other boy without words. Harry seemed resigned, and nodded, and Draco turned and went into the house.
Draco echoed his father’s glare at them, then swished his tail, causing the crowd around them to scatter before moving towards his tower. As his father had said, it had been covered in vines somehow. Draco couldn’t understand how that had happened.
And through it all, the food, the arrangements for the contest, Harry sat and talked to him. Apparently, Harry had lost his parents when he had been quite young, and had only just managed to regain his crown. Remus and Sirius—also known as Moony and Padfoot, had been his father’s two closest advisors, and had helped Harry recover his kingdom, along with a small group of others, some of whom were working now to restore his father’s castle to its former glory. “It’s not nearly as beautiful as your family’s palace, of course, but I’m fond of it…”
"I didn't ask to get him in trouble, Draco. I'm just curious."
“How do I know you’re not going to hex me if I do?”
That Harry Potter could ever consider someone might not want him was more than Draco could handle, and the only thing he could think of to stop the bubble of hysterical laughter was to tug Harry close and kiss him.
“All right,” Draco sighed. He wasn’t sure this was a good idea, but who else could he tell? “The first…You decided you wanted to make peace. So you came to ask me a favour…”
So this note stated that if he wasn't let out for a day, he would commit suicide. He gave them a week to allow it, and then… well, the note made it quite plain Draco would do something drastic.
“Like this,” Draco said, and shouted “
Draco saw it, then, how this conversation could go. Potter would try and bring up why exactly Draco gets the worst assignments, the most paperwork, the hardest evaluations, and the smallest office. Draco would make a pointed remark about why exactly Potter shows up every morning looking like he hadn’t slept at all the night before. The words would turn into barbs, and every second would become an increasingly tense reminder of what had happened the last time Draco and Potter were alone in a bathroom together.
Harry did, sliding his shirt off over toned muscles and bronze skin. Draco was a professional and refused to react, even if Harry was more outrageously fit than strictly necessary. But when Harry twisted to the side to show his back, Draco couldn’t help the sharp inhale.
“Another roll, please!” he said instead.
as a Healer, because you claimed to be unfit to marry until you had a proper career.”
“Ah, see?” The Collector said. “No one turns down my invitations.” They turned to Draco. “Have you come to give me an exchange?”
Which is how Harry got to press his nose to the cold airplane window and feel the push against his chest as the plane took off. How he got to feel Draco’s bony fingers clutch at his knee while the engine roared in acceleration. Sense Draco’s shoulders tense as they crushed up against his own. Study Draco’s lips as they twitched in curiosity at ads in the airplane magazines. Hear Draco’s voice roll and lilt through an entire French conversation with a flight attendant.
Still no yelling. Harry was fine. He figured at most Draco would yell, but not get to the point of yelling and throwing things. “The Department of Transportation is already embarrassed at having to give up the case. Whoever catches these smugglers would really show up the wizards who claimed that ex-Death Eaters could never accomplish anything.”
hot showers, and get some food. I paid an idiotic amount of Muggle money for a bag with
Draco remained calm, “This isn’t about tarts, Mother, and you know it.” His smile said a thousand words, and he knew she understood all of them. She had changed the order because she knew Harry liked them. This was her subtle pureblood brand of petty retaliation because he wouldn’t sit still and shackle himself to someone he didn’t love like a good boy. She disapproved of Harry because of his family, his gender, his lack of manor-bred decorum, and his general impulsivity.
“It would have been a safer bond, yes,” Draco said softly. “Better. No need for some specific act to seal the bond or the enforced proximity. But then I would have been used as a weapon to make sure you were killed before the war even started.”
“It means that to complete the bond, and for Draco’s magic to mix with yours as well, you two need to kiss. At sunset, by the Great Lake.”
“Draco,” Harry said, and he couldn’t breathe again. His ribs were collapsing and his heart was expanding and he was glowing and terrified and ecstatic.
“This isn’t coercion, Potter,” Malfoy said. “You get to choose. I order you to take these off, or I order you to accept my authority and walk away. Simple enough.”
“We should kiss now,” Harry said. “Because tomorrow, I’m gonna be interested in
give it to him. Do
“I mean, if I’m being honest, it was an accident. I was never going to tell you.” Harry tried take a breath, tried to get more air in his lungs than the gasping air around him allowed. “If I never told you, you’d never have to say no, and I’d get to keep our dinners and our jokes and our bets on the Ministry interns. I’ve seen the smartest, sexiest, richest people in Britain hit on you. If they never even got a date, then someone like me wouldn’t have a chance. But I could be your partner, the best partner you’d ever have. I could duel by your side while you threw curses like a sexy bastard, and I could watch you do that thing where you scrunch up your nose while you’re trying to solve a case. I could… it’d be enough for me. It’d be nice.”
“You told me you didn’t want me to flirt with you in public,” Harry said. “When we started this. So it wouldn’t give us away.” Draco could feel those stupid green eyes studying his face. He refused to look.

“The Ministry can only book a flight back for Monday, so whoever takes the case gets an extra two days in Montreal.”
“It absolutely is, and I guarantee I’m a better singer than you,” Draco agreed. “Mind, a kneazle is a better singer than you, so that’s barely a boast.”
Then he stomped back to where Harry was, and yanked at the ropes around him. “If you’re not insane, does this mean you’re an idiot?” Draco flicked his wand to cut Harry bonds, then picked up the ropes and threw them over the wing with a yell. “Harry,

. And yet, somehow, I’m so stupidly in love with great idiotic Harry Potter that I actually find this whole farce endearing! Charming! Practically heart-melting!” Draco glared up at the atmosphere, to where Merlin himself had probably settled for the rest of his immortality. “Is this because I was a Death Eater? Is this the penance I have to pay for the rest of my life?”
“Think we can jump over it?” Harry asked.
“I’m not going to let you saddle yourself with the black mark of being with a Death Eater,” Draco swallowed. He wanted to snarl, to snap, not sputter. “It’d stay with you forever, long after you’re done with me.”
Draco drew in a sharp breath but quickly tried to cover it by clearing his throat. “So. Soulmates. I wish I could say I’m surprised.”
“What?”
Draco had sat beside him while Harry shook in the bathroom, shooting hexes at anyone who tried to sneak a glimpse of the
“Draco?” Harry said again, uneasy.
“I can get you bigger windows if you like,” Harry said. He wanted to offer Draco more, offer him everything. “Maybe a skylight. You could tell me what you need, and we can work on it together.”
Harry blinked. “Wait, what?”
“Potter, it’s earsplitting.”
and kill Harry or something. As if Harry going on record multiple times saying that he trusted Draco with his life, thank you, wasn’t enough. But Society pages always kept note of how Draco would turn heads in whatever poncy fashion he kept managing to pull off on an Auror’s salary. The Ministry couldn’t help but study Draco’s

“Marry me,” Harry said instead.

“Samantha, what does this have to do with today’s lesson?”

Malfoy stood waiting for Harry to recover, unimpressed, slick arms folded across his bare chest. Lithe as he was, Harry could still barely see the lines of any bones under his skin; Malfoy was all taut, corded muscle, coiled like a spring around a long, lean frame. “I figured I would stop fighting fair when you gave the command to lock the Holodeck doors,” he said. “I bet there’s even an order that absolutely no recordings be made of what happens here today.”
“Oh, I’m sure,” Draco said. “This one here looks well-read, and it’s bookmarked at chapter fourteen. Is that one of the plotty bits? I’ll just read it and check —”
“Draco, stop.
Harry sighed and tapped his whole foot on the tile this time, yanking it back immediately. When nothing happened again, Harry looked at Draco, licked his lips, straightened up, and stepped fully onto the orange tile.
“He does? How do you know?”
And with that, Malfoy sank down with the grace of a falling feather, his back straight and his lips still tilted into a cocksure smirk.
Malfoy snorted, infuriatingly elegant. “Of course.” He spun around and strode on bare, bony feet to the medic station on the far wall and began rooting around. “The sort of sparring that has nothing to do with you intimidating me, as an act of intense loyalty to your very clever Captain.” He came back and tossed a handheld Regenerator at Harry, who snatched it with lightning reflexes, despite the sharp ache in his pelvis the stretch caused.
It was the sound that did it. The hard rattle of two dice knocking into each other. Two.
The plane dipped and they both wobbled, steadied. Harry focused on his wrists. Until Draco let go, Harry would go through a lot to keep them there, even if the plane fell out of the sky.
Harry and Draco were seated in their shared hospital room sitting across from each other at a small table covered with the books and notes Draco had been poring over.
Harry nodded, obeying. He was quiet for a few minutes, then asked softly. “How’s your mother?”
Then Malfoy was gone, down the hallway with the soft hydraulic

“You are.” Slowly, Harry reached out and gently stroked the back of Draco’s hand. “I can’t believe I never saw it before.”
“Will you let me make you come?” Malfoy asked, a breath away from Harry’s skin.

Harry let out a shaky laugh. “Well, at least you didn’t misspell it to the Pacific Ocean.” He swallowed. “A kiss at sunset. Okay. But Draco’s parents and Celandine are coming at noon.”
“Oh! Yes!” Hermione said, grabbing a mildly protesting Sam and dragging her out of the office.
Draco paused, took a breath, then said: “Would you like me to show you where they are?”
“Right,” McGonagall said. “Well, we best go and take care of that, haven’t we? Hermione? Miss Jordan? Care to help me?”

“Of course, now as this is a new bond, I’m sure you both know it’ll take about 2-3 months to settle. In that time, it’s recommended that you not be more that 15 feet apart, increasing distance and length of time as it becomes comfortable. Draco, as a professional courtesy, I went ahead and filed the paperwork to put you on Bonding Leave, so you’re good to go, just pop in and catch me up on any cases you have ongoing.”
He turned, saw Draco, and said, “Oh,
“That’s —” Harry gasped. “That wasn’t… no.”
The next morning, Harry woke up to a note from Draco:
“When you and your over sized ego are done insulting me, maybe we can get back to practicing… oh and acknowledging I’m right as well.. Because, well, I am.”
The Slytherin got the reference of course but felt now or never was the time to be honest instead of snarky. “I want to move to France, change my name and start a bakery. Never look back.”
“I know what you’re doing you know”, someone behind him declared.
The blond boy instantly understood his lover’s predicament when he noticed his Cock completely dry, not even a drop of lube on it. The spell must have worn out at some point. Blaise had mentioned this could happen if you cast it in a hurry, which had been the case today.
“Do you really believe that?”, a voice said behind him.
When they reached the lake and sat on the grass, it took them both about 3 seconds before they started furiously laughing at their owe expanse. It was like they both had been caged for months and were finally out of it.
“Wow, what a stupid plan. You really exceeded yourself this time, Potter”, he answered with a scowl.
A couple times, when the savior had been forced to watch Voldemort live through his nightmares, he could see death eaters around. Most of them were not murderous at first. All they wanted was make sure their traditions would not get lost in a sea of new wizarding families. Was it stupid? Yes. Dangerous? Well, looked what happened. But surely, with the crazy snake gone, they could talk to each other. Muggle-borns could prove that they are lot less powerful and are as useful as purebloods. The purebloods could voice what there are afraid to lose and compromises could be made. Yes, this could work.
Harry actually had a casual meeting with the Minister that night, like Malfoy had guessed. He could bring Malfoy along, that would grandly help him and his future career. He could play seekers games with him at night. He could make out with him on the Ravenclaw table for that matter. The Wizarding world would forgive him anything, just like the staff and kids here let him wonder at night and let him do whatever he wanted.
“What do you want from me? The only reason you would risk appearing queer to get me out of here is because you need me. So tell me. Then I can make what you want happen as quickly as possible and never have to see your duplicitous face ever again.”
The grey-eyed boy closed his eyes again. He looked so young and vulnerable in that room, in those clothes, in that light. He gulped and without opened his eyes, said: “So if I get out of here, would you want to give this a shot? Dating a man? Dating me?”
“It is.” He replied with a smile. Potter knew. He knew what that meant.
Still, he felt the need to sit with him. The Gryffindor couldn’t see nor understand the signals the universe sent him, but he could always
“You seem surprised. Didn’t you just say that you knew what I was doing? Maybe you had something else in mind?”
It took a second to Harry to really integrate what the blond boy had just said. When he had, the only logical reaction was to laugh. Loudly.
"Look Malfoy, I..."
Harry started laughing while shaking his head in tenderness.
them.
“You really think if I was, I would tell you? Let me remind you I’m an excellent secret keeper, smarter and more cunning than both of you combined. Simply telling you my intentions are pure should not be enough.” Draco argued with more spite than he initially intended.
“Fine, Potter you win. I’m going to tie you up spread eagle to that bed instead”, he informed the other boy.
The same thing that had happened twice happened again: Hermione looked at him intensely while clearly considering the better answer to give him, but couldn’t, because Ron instantly said: “Are you? Planning on killing him I mean?”
Malfoy then looked at him with the same eyes he had when Harry had first opened the door of that small room earlier. Broken and so immensely tired. Malfoy had absolutely no fight left in him. None. The war had done so many victims among the green-eyed boy’s friends and family, he had never stopped himself to think further. This was bigger than him. It was about rebuilding the wizarding world. All of it.
He had won.
“Bloody hell, Potter, why didn’t you tell me?” Draco yelled, roughly turning Harry around so he could finally eye him properly.
“Why…?” Malfoy managed to get out in a muffled voice.
“Harry, I’m sorry but I can’t. I told you, both my choices are bad here” Draco explained glaring at his shoes, scared to look at Harry’s green eyes.
“Then why are you being so difficult and mean?  I just wanna help.” Harry tried to sound as nice as he could, since he could not understand what was going on in the other boy’s mind.
Harry didn't say NO, but... Draco still felt the ball in his gut fade a little. He took one last look at the ground and realized that Potter was right again, killing himself away in guilt wouldn't bring back Dumbledore or anyone else who died in the battle.
At that, the young Malfoy couldn’t help but glare at Potter for the umpteenth time that night, but noticed to his great surprise that Harry was looking right at him this time, with what could only be described as a come hither look.
, just like I am.” He spoke most of that very quickly but slowed at the end to put emphasis on the fact that Malfoy had done nothing wrong, if maybe acting a little cowardly. But nobody should blame a sixteen-year-old for that.  Malfoy should be at home, drinking posh tea in his posh pajamas with his annoying posh friends like any posh kid who went through major trauma.
What should happen now is Draco shouting a clear : "what the bloody hell are you talking about, do you have rats in the attic or something?", but no words came out. The blond boy was somehow more mesmerized by how she had said it than the fact she had said it. She giggled it. Like 12 years old girls do, and not adding: "if you hurt out precious saviour, we will curse your death eater ass into next week." It was pure, undeniable gossip. Nothing more. This was unequivocally the weirdest day of the young Malfoy's life.
Cock. He had noticed Harry seemed impressed and surprised by his boldness.
Here we go again. In defense class this time. Harry and Draco yet again arguing over something silly, more for the sake of the arguing than anything else. It has happened pretty much every day since the beginning of eight year.
Potter smiled. Then walked away from him.
Of course. They were an odd number of students and Potter was too good for any of them to face up anyway, so Lukewarm had made him the judge.
"And then, me broom flew straight into the Great Lake, it was bonkers!"
"What I'm saying is I think you should be happy to be alive. I think you should stop coming here all the time, it's gloomy and cold. I think you should come to the party downstairs, get pissed and make out with someone. Live a little for Merlin's sake!  The war is over Malfoy."
The Gryffindor nodded, took a deep breath. Draco could see all the thinking that was going in his mind. All the questions newly answered. All the new ones that this situation brought.
was miserable, and alone. So alone that not only was he not invited to their weekly parties, he wasn’t even aware of their existence until his little encounter with Potter in the Astronomy tower the week prior. “We don’t invite people; we just drink with everybody that happens to be in the room on Friday nights. You don’t have to be invited Draco; you just have to show up.” Harry had said.
Draco might have won in more than one way that day.
He didn't say no.
Harry Potter was hugging him. No, Harry Potter was hugging the crap out of him. Thinking that he was probably more drunk than he originally thought, Draco just let himself melt against the other boy.
"Do you think I should have said no to the Dark Lord... when he asked me to kill Dumbledore, I mean?"
“You’ve been doing that for like 15 minutes and I still think you are wrong.”
!” Harry cast, noticing too late Malfoy executing the totally wrong hand movement for the Cautio charm, but the right one for a perfect and very powerful shielding charm. The dancing feet spell rebounded on the shield and soon enough Harry was dancing like crazy in the middle of class.
Suddenly, Draco realised that his breathing had slowed. He noticed a hand very gently stroking his back. He found himself yelling: "What, you think I should go back to being a petty pretentious asshole like nothing happened? Is that what you're saying Potter?"
They were meeting in a little conference room near the cells and Harry had managed to get him alone. He knew a lot of powerful members of the Wizengamot would not agree to this meeting. They could want to hear the whole conversation or not let them talk at all. This could go south any second, so he had to make his point quick. He did not have time for Malfoy to be scared and sad.
That particular row was not entirely their fault though. Professor Lukewarm, the new DADA teacher, had paired them together for some reason.  Boring as he was, Harry suspected it was not for the sake of seeing them have a cool duel together. He probably made a pointing system in his mind or something and paired them accordingly. That man was the only person alive able to render duelling boring.
to be somewhere else. He spent all his free time on the tower and fell asleep on the cold floor almost every day. Most of his time, he spent like this: looking down where Dumbledore’s body fell. Trying to stop that guilty feeling that was eating away at him. And during all these long lonely hours, the only thing in his mind was that word:
"Potter invited me. But I don't feel like I deserve to be here. It... it isn't right", he answered quietly, his eyes still fixed on the group listening to the cursed broom story. He couldn't help but notice Potter was now among them, laughing wholeheartedly without a care in the world.
Fortunately for the both of them, all that control that Potter had given him over the last months gave him the courage to not do it. Not yet. He had to make this right first.
“Wow it’s like you
There, he said it. Still looking at that spot on the ground where he perfectly recalls seeing the body be. He asked a yes/no question or purpose, realizing that this moment right now was crucial. He needed Potter to say it. No. He couldn't let him leave without saying it.
“Everything, of course. It started because of your guilt; it went on because of mine.” Harry decided to go with it, feeling the discussion had reached the point of no return for them. These things just could not wait anymore to be said.
the man who made all of us miserable. Do you seriously think I’m gonna go and ask people for things for the rest of my life because of that??” Harry asked genuinely.
The flirting mood was back, even stronger than it had been five minutes ago. Both boys were standing up near the couch, that way being even closer than they were sitting down. The blond felt trapped once again.
“I honestly thought this was just… you know… the next step.” Harry offered, sounding unsure of himself but still it was more or less the truth.
Maybe Hermione had be right, maybe Potter was just looking for a shag among other shags, to explore his youth in a well-deserved break from all the drama that went down the last few years. He had thought himself about doing that, but he felt like he didn’t deserve the fun. He deserved to spend every damn minute on that tower, yelling sorry over and over again, asking himself what he could have done better.
The blond boy showed a wide range of emotions in the few seconds that followed. Fear, rage, arousal, sadness, resilience. If only Harry could see, he could have understood so much. So much more than Draco was usually willing to divulge, actually.
Harry really pondered the question but answered quite rapidly: “Dating a bloke? Yeah why not? Dating you, I don’t know, you are quite difficult. And I still have no idea on how to convince the Wizengamot to let you go.”
Draco made a subtle yet clear head movement suggesting Hermione that she should go. She nodded and followed Harry to lunch.
"Why did you come then?", she asked again with a look that appeared to be... just interested in his well being. This couldn't be happening.
"Yes, but I should not have, I actually was about to head out to bed", the Slytherin muttered. But he didn't get up. Something told him this conversation was important.
‘you two being able to have a polite conversation will set the tone for the entire year. Every 8
Malfoy was the key. If Harry wanted to unify the whole British wizarding world, that was who he needed. If they could walk side by side in front of the press, showing a clear reconciliation, it could show everyone that nothing is beyond repair.
"So why are you here? You never come to those parties." Weasley asked with a cleared voice, not having food in his mouth anymore. Had he eaten that whole sandwich/meat pie during the hardly 10 seconds he spent looking at Hermione? And what the hell had that thing been anyway? Just when he went to ask, Granger used this time to answer Weasley's question in his place: "Because Harry asked.”
Then, Malfoy’s eyes stopped moving. He smirked, then closed his eyes and shook his head. “You did that on purpose. You wanted to say something so insane I would be forced out of my funk.” He got up and walked to the nearest wall and leaned his forehead on it. “That might just be the meanest thing you’ve ever done to me. And may I remind you, you once sliced me open.” He turned around, leaned his body on the wall. “You’ll be glad to know I’m back Potter. Your plan worked flawlessly.” He was looking right at Harry, his eyes full of betrayal and hate.
“I came to get you out of here”.
“Don’t be daft Potter. Cast a jinx at me. Cast 10 for all I care. If any reach me, I will gladly admit defeat and proclaim you high and clear: Potter, the great knower of all.
That word, “no”, would have changed everything.
They were both shouting now. Naked, vulnerable and on the very edge of a breakup they both desperately wanted to avoid. Harry had brought up the Dark Lord, and thus the theme of the war, a subject they had both dodged many times but evidently could not anymore.
“Like I said Draco, he likes you, but I’m sad to say, you might not be looking for the same thing.” Hermione remarked, before standing up from the couch, and taking Ron with her someplace else. Harry stood up from the group and walked to sit with Draco. None of the others seem to notice his leaving.
“Think for a minute, Potter. They will know we met. If we tell the exact same stories, they will know we arranged them during this very meeting, and all of what we will be saying won’t be usable as definitive proof that I am not a despicable bastard who needs to be put away for good. You shouldn’t have come.”
The Slytherin replied immediately, but barely moved at all, mostly by the shock of it. The kiss was mostly tongue and teeth; the sitting side by side position was uncomfortable, and the whole thing was over in a few seconds.
Draco lay down on the bed, putting in left forearm over his eyes. Harry sat crossed legged near him. “So… basically, all this time, I was the Dom, but you’ve been the one using me”, Draco laughed again, more genuinely this time.
But the prick was is no shape to confront the Daily Prophet right now. He needed his brain rewired and his old self brought back. A new and nicer version of him would not do the trick. He had to come in front of the whole world and be a gigantic arsehole, and Harry needed to be standing by his side, accepting it. That was a way stronger message. ‘We accept each other. Exactly as we are. No matter what. No more carnage, no more death, no more division.’
And so, they went for a walk around the castle, Then on the school grounds. Finally noticing the knowing looks in everyone’s eyes. Noticing the total absence of surprise at their holding hands. Basically, everybody knew they were together. They had just been way too caught in their own heads to see it.
“Implied? Yes it was, Potter. Happy to know you are still eloquent as ever. Still, I never
‘Find a third option’ Potter had said. Move to France? Jump off the window? Scream ‘PLEASE MARRY ME’? Nothing but crazy ideas came to mind.
“Scared Malfoy?” couldn’t help but reply.
“Your movement needs to be sharper Potter. You’re way too slow, I would have time to jinx you 10 times in a real duel during the time it takes you to cast it. You move like an old snail trying to take his final steps in life.”
“Are you asking me out, Malfoy? I mean you just said you wanna stop fucking but NOT end this.” Harry said in a sultry voice, walking dangerously close to Malfoy.
“No”, Draco whispered to no one.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea.” The blond boy managed to enunciate after taking a long breath. He had to get away from him. He slowly got up and started dressing.
“You said it yourself: I’m a cunning little bitch who uses people and doesn’t care for rules. You, on the other hand, are
“I could have gone into the forest sooner. So many people would be alive right now if I had.” Draco went to protest but Harry put a gentle finger on his mouth and continued: “I know what you’re about to say. That it’s not my fault. That thinking like that is illogical, nay stupid. That a lot of people, including you, have done way worse things during the war and I can’t seem to hold a grudge against any of them. And I tend to agree. But when I close my eyes at night, I see them Malfoy. All of them. Fred, Lupin, Tonks, even Snape sometimes. I dream I’m killing them with my bare hands. Or I dream they are all alive and well and I’m dead and the world is such a better place. I wake up less and less happy every morning and pretty much the only times I feel okay is when I’m with you. When you’re especially rough with me, I feel the guilt go away and it feels sooooo good.”
Malfoy was sitting on the couch closest to the fireplace, poised as ever, is in emerald green silk pajamas. The moon light made his hair a shiny silver in a very cold manner. His face and hands were however warmed by the fire light. His whole body was glowing.  The stillness of the trees outside and the otherwise empty room made his presence ever more impossible to ignore. Harry was mesmerized.
, wouldn’t work against a stunning spell and the point was to prove to Malfoy that he was casting it wrong. He had to cast something mild, only quickly enough.
Harry hadn’t cum in two weeks now, so it made sense that Malfoy assumed he wanted out because he was getting frustrated, and he even though he was, that had nothing to do with his current emotion.
Approaching the sheet, Draco hoped he would be paired with Potter, but doubted it could happen. DADA was never his best subject and Lukewarm’s system couldn’t possibly take into account the fact that he had gotten better in the last few weeks.
Malfoy had not killed Dumbledore.
“NO!! God no. I’m sorry, I just can’t keep having this conversation naked. I’m not that a good person that I won’t jump you and cage you if I get the chance.” Draco explained, throwing his clothes at Harry so he could dress as well.
“Your trial is in a couple days and I plan to get you acquitted”, he précised.
“Simple. You get out of here at once. At the trial, we both tell our versions of what happened honestly. That way it’s not going to sound rehearsed.  I mean we were on opposite sides. Of course, our versions of what happened should sound and be a little different. Then I don’t know, come what may I guess.”
“Are you saying you’re queer Potter?” Malfoy queried, sitting back in the chair, trying to sound angry, but looking strangely hopeful.
Not that there was actual duelling happening. They were debating over the right hand movement of a new shielding charm Lukewarm had thought them. Not as strong as Protego, but could last a lot longer. Perfect against a weaker opponent who keeps throwing small jinks at you.
The green-eyed boy knew he should say yes. But the milking always left him feeling empty, tired, and frustrated. And he was already feeling all three of these things to a full extent. He needed a nap. He needed out of that room.
He got up to pick up a warm blanket on a nearby couch, only to sit back down to cuddle with Malfoy, spreading the blanket over them both.
He then realised the ropes were gone. He finally opened his eyes to discover Malfoy looking absolutely mortified by what just happened.
Harry had just come back from his nightly walk around the castle. Even the eight years had a curfew, so they would get some sleep, and be able to pay attention in class, but no one dared to reprimand him for any of his multiple breaks of the rules. Prefects feared or admired him; Professors were mostly thankful to be alive. A few of them understood his need for these walks of loneliness in the calm dark of the castle at night as his way of grounding himself once more. Those, like McGonagall, just smiled and said nothing when they would pass him in the hall, even particularly late at night, they would let him be. Harry of course felt unworthy of being so privileged but soon started to enjoy wondering around without his cloak.
Draco couldn’t stop thinking that just by saying that single word then, so much would be different now. So many deceased people would be alive. He himself would probably be dead, but quite honestly, who would care? Lucius was rotting away in Azkaban, still chanting the dark lord’s praise. Narcissa wasn’t half the woman she once was, slowing sinking into depression and despair. All his friends had left for France or even father away without a single glance, even if they knew coming back to school was mandatory for his probation. They left. Even if the loneliness was barely bearable, he couldn't lie to himself, should the roles have been reversed, he would have done the same thing.
Harry watched the proceedings with interest as Draco looked over the papers she’d handed him.
Draco nodded. “Or like Warlock March, which is more magically apt.”
“Is that enough for me to get a new roll, please?” Harry asked.
. They were friends. Well, sort of. Now apparently
It was Draco who figured out that the kidnapper was Fae, who spent whole nights in archives and who emerged with records of similar events documented from hundreds of years ago. It was Draco who triangulated a 30 kilometre radius where the Collector was situated from hundreds of different forests.
“Um...I suppose so, I’ll need to call in some additional help and it is very last minute, I’ll have to charge extra for that on top of the cost of the new dessert.”
bad, right?” Harry asked.
“Come on, let’s get on the brooms,” Draco said. “When we get to Montreal, we’ll go to dinner and I’ll teach you how to properly woo someone, since you can’t manage it yourself.” He looked over his shoulder and winked at Harry as the whole world stretched out before them. Draco’s grin was crinkling his face, and his hair flopped over his eye, more beautiful than any duel, any dragon. “Race you?”
“What kind of orders are those?” Harry snapped. He
“Don’t think you’ve earned that information,” Harry said. He tried to convince himself that the heavy thudding of his heart was from the ichor, not from deep, squirming fear for anyone who’d come for him.
But he knew that if he stayed, there would be no restraint. There never was, between the two of them. This would just be the culmination of a lifetime of confrontations, of contentions. Harry could choose, and whatever choice he made would redefine the parameters of every moment between them for the next 70,000 lightyears.
All too soon, they were interrupted by a small squeak behind them. Draco broke the kiss, keeping a tight hold on his husband to be, their foreheads still pressed together. Without turning, he took a shaky breath and said, “Yes, Mimsy?”
Harry blinked. “I thought you needed to get away from me?”
Voldemort, who calmly destroyed a ship carrying Harry’s parents, Neville’s parents, and thousands of other Starfleet officers, just to make a political statement about the ideals
In a series of bright colours that defied both pattern and reasonable aesthetics, the line of square tiles stretched out in front of them, marching into the grey. Each the size of a small table, they made a gaudy path that swerved and twisted and looped far beneath them before swinging up in an arc over their heads and meandering off again.
“I know,” Draco said softly. “And I love you too much to let you sacrifice that for someone like me.”
Draco bit his lip. “If we jump over, does that count as landing on it?” He turned to the die. “Can we have another roll, please? So we can
“What?” Harry said looking down at him. “I was just thinking, five months ago, I woke up in a world where I was alone and doomed to be married to a woman I didn’t want, and then you showed up as a patient in my hospital and turned everything upside down. You never can just be boring can you, Harry?”
“Do you think,” Harry said that night, into the dark. “That I was supposed to shake your hand, back when we were eleven? And that’s what our mark’s about?”
“That was not nearly enough cheering, you miserable excuse for a partner.” Draco left the bundled-up smugglers and came over to undo Harry’s body bind. But the smile was there, tugging up the edges of Draco’s stern lips, and Harry was forgiven.
“Malfoys don’t do trades,” Draco said, then pointed his wand at the Collector and said “
“Do they know right away?” Hilary raised her hand and asked.
Harry snorted. “Not the time for your poncy word commandments. If the official blue
“Draco,” Harry said, “What
just to prove his point. “Go on an arial plane with me, he says. It’s like being on a broom, he says. An eight-bloody-hour flight to Montreal will be an experience,
Harry turned with a soft smile. “I’m planting flowers.”
He just wanted to be a person joking with his coworker about avoiding the paperwork. A person who might, someday, have this coworker as a friend.
“Draco,” she smiled sweetly, “I don’t see what all the fuss is about, they’re just tarts darling.”
But Draco decided that he didn’t want that. Not in this moment, in the middle of the night in an old bathroom with echoing pipes. He didn’t want to be the rival, or the antagonist, or the one who never got invited to pub nights.
“It’s a what?”
Draco watched as Harry walked across the tile and thumped into some kind of invisible barrier on the far side. But otherwise, nothing.
“Muggles call ‘em Daffodils,” Harry said.
His heart sank when he recognized the handwriting.
He sighed and glanced over at the bed beside his. Draco lay motionless between starched sheets, looking almost angelic in the light filtering in through the curtains. Harry had never seen him this peaceful. It was a good look on him, even if Harry missed his wit and sarcasm.
“You know what,” Draco said, resting his forehead against Harry’s, “I actually have something to do before we complete the bond terminally. I have a letter to compose.”
“Oh, that’s not a problem,” Draco smiled sweetly, signing the pages on the clipboard and handing it back to her. He took Harry’s hand and turned to leave, “You can charge them to my mother’s personal account.” And with that he swept out of the room taking Harry with him.
to be you,” Weasley had said, when they were strategizing. “I can distract him in the common room while you go. Harry only really gets distracted by you behind closed doors, and we both know he won’t take off his clothes in your room, ‘cause he’s scared of Zabini’s hidden recording devices.”
. “I always thought it was your destiny, too. I occasionally felt pity over the way Admiral Dumbledore took your unwavering courage and groomed you to be Starfleet’s sacrificial lamb.”
Draco sighed. “
The die wiggled, and hopped into a tumbling roll that landed on Six.
“You plan to maintain your authority like this?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the shameless display his kisbet, unable to hide where the flush of heat in his body had settled. Trying to not betray what the sight of Malfoy on his knees did to Harry’s heart and mind and entire understanding of how the two of them were supposed to

“I just want this...wedding...to be an elegant, dignified, respectable affair.”
?” Draco blinked. “I only mentioned it to you once.”
Draco shrugged. “It’s not like we agreed about where to go in the first place. And if it’s just sex, we can just fall back on our system: you Floo when you’re free, and I’ll come. Roll the dice, please.”
He watched Malfoy try to stare him down. It was the stare of Cursebreaker Malfoy, the one used to pull apart the nastiest hexes the Ministry had ever seen. Whatever Malfoy found, though, didn’t satisfy him.
“Correct, but this was poorly made. Soul Beacons are very old, very complicated magic even experts in soulbonding aren’t even sure how some of these things work. From what I can see in the memory, a lot of the runes are slightly off or in some cases poorly translated. Like here, the rune for “draw” was mistaken with “tie”. Tie can mean “to come in even in a competition”. In that sense draw and tie do mean the same thing, however, tie can also mean to connect or link, so can bond.”
And so Draco stood at Weasley’s nod, overtly bored with his Ancient Runes textbook. He strode over to where they were playing and watched for a round or two as Harry got trounced pretty bloody badly by Longbottom.
“Then maybe,” Harry said. “Maybe we let them talk? It’ll be loud for a while, but it wouldn’t be so bad.”
Sam shrugged, looking embarrassed. “I meant to say “by the ocean” but I guess I got that wrong as well.”
There was a kneazle waiting at the next tile they stopped on.
“Yeah! I didn’t really master the dice until after I landed on a space full of bobtuber puss, so things are a bit, er, slimy.” Harry took a breath. “Which I think I deserve, for the dick things I did. I shouldn’t have kept you a secret from everybody. I shouldn’t have ever done
Draco tilted his head in acknowledgement. “You’re not wrong. Technically, I wasn’t the first Healer sent to deal with you, though. You’ve been out for nearly three days, and practically every medical professional in here had a crack at you before I came along.”
into existence above them. With a groan, Draco reached for it.
“Yes, I assumed that much,” Draco said, a teasing glint in his eyes.
. It’s probability magic!”
“Are you insane?” Draco studied Harry’s face, apparently genuinely worried about this.
wants you, Draco!”
Draco turned back to Victoria, who looked very much like she wanted to melt into the wall rather than be in the middle of this personal dispute.
“Draco, owl for you.”
“Harry, wizards all over the country would kill to be in my shoes, but you’re choosing me. Do you have any idea how insane that is to me?” He cupped Harry’s cheek and stroked his hair gently. “I don’t know what I did to deserve you Harry, but I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy.”
They were still lying on the teddy bears when the parchment
Harry’s cock stiffened and throbbed, the ache in his groin far different than what it was before — and far, far worse. He tried to ground himself, to press his teeth together, to count to ten in Andorian. But it wasn’t enough to stop the way Malfoy’s command thrummed through his bones. Not enough to stop his body’s heady response to the shape of Malfoy’s body, kneeling at Harry’s feet and absolutely certain of his power. “You’re abusing your power,” he gritted out.
“That’s what you wanted when you brought me here, wasn’t it?” Malfoy said. He pressed the palm of his hand into the wall beside Harry’s head, close enough for the smell of olive oil and skin to fill every breath Harry took. “To make me submit? Fall back into the intimidation pranks we used to play on each other at Hogwarts? Haven’t you played enough big boy war games to learn that power doesn’t always belong to the one who huffs and puffs the most? We’re both different from when we were at the Academy, Potter. That’s not how power works out in the deep dark depths of space.”
“And the Potters are not,” Harry said.
Draco perked up, examining mode in full swing. He looked beautiful, Harry thought fleetingly, his eyes alight and determined. Harry shook himself. He couldn’t go around thinking about Draco as
Draco needed to pen an equally polite and pointed response. And he would. As soon as the thought of getting married, even for the sake a formality, didn’t make his ribs feel like they were caving in.
“I didn’t say that last one,” Harry called back. “Robards did. All I said was that I thought it would be fun. You know, traveling the Muggle way.”
“I cancelled them and replaced them with miniature lemon ricotta cheesecakes. They are much more appropriate for a summer wedding. Don’t you agree dear?”
“Normal people just send an owl.”
right now.”
Draco sat up a little straighter, staring at Harry. “
against the tendons of a pale neck.
And so Draco sighed, a touch dramatic, a touch indifferent. “Fine,” he said. “Give me your trunk key, then, if you want to stay and keep your glorious winning streak. I’ll get them myself.”
, because it was always Harry, that made Draco mock and challenge and engage and reach out.
days?”
“Oh. So I wouldn’t be wrong to assume I’m now wearing an identical mark to match yours?”
Draco was yelling. Not frowning, yelling and throwing. The thrill of the fight was still in Harry’s veins, even as his heart was lurching, because his body never understood that being in this kind of danger was bad.
It took three strides to the trunk, a quick slide of the key, a twist, and the lid was popping up.
Maquis would represent. After that, it was a campaign for the “genetic purity” of spacefaring, and soon Voldemort’s black mark of a fleet, curling in formation like a giant snake amongst the stars, became the symbol of everything Starfleet fought against.
“You found a space with brooms,” Draco said with a laugh. His eyes were disgusting, and he had spilled some whiskey on his pants, but Harry was
“Your key?” Draco said.
Draco took a breath, spun back to face Harry, and easily hopped over the hole into nothingness to land on the white tile. He moved across two more tiles, stopping at what he saw.
