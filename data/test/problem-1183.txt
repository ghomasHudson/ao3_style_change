Even though Harry promised himself he wouldn't pleasure himself until Draco's needs were fulfilled, he couldn't help but fondle his erection through his jeans. He was so incredibly aroused, he could feel his pre-come seeping through his trousers
"Harry, I swear to Merlin—" Draco cut himself off before harshly grabbing Harry's erection through his trousers and forcefully squeezing it. Harry winced in pain, dropping his book bag back onto the stone cold floor.
"That was hot as fuck." Harry breathed out, chuckling in disbelief. How the hell have they not gotten caught yet? It was all sheer luck that nobody thought too hard about Draco's appearance.
Draco found himself face to face with Harry's cock once again, but with much more excitement about it than the first time. He wasn't able to properly pay attention to it when he was riding out his orgasm. This time, Harry had his full and undivided attention.
"Can we still put carrots on Daddy's plate?" Scorpius' voice chimed in, holding onto his Papa tighter.
Draco began to pick up the pace, sloppily slurping the full length into the back of his throat and bobbing back up to swirl his tongue around Harry's slit.
Understanding where this was going, Harry wordlessly locked the door to their dorm and activated a silencing charm. Draco felt Harry's magic coarse through his body and he shivered as it caressed his skin.
He bit down on his lip as he pushed his finger inside, breaching past the tight ring of muscles. He only allowed himself to go down to the first knuckle before pulling it back out slowly.
Draco keenly wrapped both of his hands around Harry's right thigh and Harry looked down at him with a confused expression. He decided to not interrupt the man on a mission since he was quite curious to see where Draco's mind was going.
"The draught of living death, when consumed, will cause the drinker to fall into a deep, death-like sleep. This can be indefinitely, so it's a very dangerous potion to work with. This is why we won't be brewing it." Slughorn flicked his wand to change the slide.
Draco's climax rippled through him, riding out his high as his body jerked with pleasure. He could feel the hot spurts of come shoot out of his pulsing member. He continued to roll his hips into the sheets, making a mess of his seed beneath him.
Draco's flaccid member began to pique in interest once again at the thought of servicing Harry Potter. Instead of dwelling in that fantasy, he decided to make it a reality and get to work right away.
"Shit." Harry cursed, overly aroused by Draco's words. It was all too much for him. Draco eating him up like he was starving, him savoring every last drop of liquid that dribbled down Harry. It was so hot and erotic, Harry was sure he wasn't going to last much longer.
"Ah yes, the draught of living death." Slughorn remembered upon looking up at the projected photo on the screen.
"It's all yours, my love." Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair and rested his hand on top of his head, as if to guide him.
Harry pulled him into a tight hug and Draco nuzzled his nose into his neck, letting himself get lost in Harry's scent for a moment. He placed a gentle, chaste kiss to Harry's skin before tugging back from his grip.
He couldn't succumb to this as well, especially since he just consented to the idea of letting his children wear their swim trunks into the bath. They convinced him by declaring: "Papa, this is playtime, okay? Not bath time. We bring water toys, too."
Draco tried so hard to keep the scowl on his face, but as soon as he saw the cheeky smile on Harry's face, his lips went against him and the corners curved upwards.
"Yeah?" Harry replied, now rubbing soft circles on top of the fabric with the same finger he was using previously. He wasn't directly touching Draco's erection just yet, but it was enough to tease him.
"Hermione didn't finish her revisions. Someone contact the Auror's, this is an emergency!" Ron dramatically gasped, his hand holding his chest in despair.
Albus dropped himself on the floor, landing on his bum with a small "oof". Scorpius stared back at his Papa with wide eyes that were glazed over with fear. They aren't used to Draco raising his voice with them.
"Mm—yes! Ready." Draco was a slut for Harry's magic abilities, he always has been whether it was the feeling of his magical aura when he was nearby, or the way he always seemed to flawlessly execute his charms.
"I'm sorry I yelled." Draco started, closing the heavy door behind Scorpius who was shifting on his feet in discomfort. Draco let himself examine him for a moment. His whole face was contorted in thought. Rosy lips were puckered in concentration, eyebrows furrowed and twitching about. He was contemplating something and Draco knew it. "What's on your mind, little one."
Draco was squirming atop the sheets again, hopelessly trying to rut his erection against every surface possible. He knew he was still not allowed to touch it and it was screaming at him to be taken care of.
"Harry. Close." Draco trembled and Harry's eyes instantly fell down to the prick in his hand to watch his sweet release.
He pushed his arse backwards, hoping to feel the silicon shape against his hole again, but Harry was quicker on his feet. He waved his wand away from himself, causing the object to move in response.
"Stop marveling and fuck me with your fist already." His whine was soft and the tone of his raspy voice was doing a number on Harry's forgotten cock.
The worst aspect of the situation, Harry concluded, was that he had no time to rid himself of his morning erection. With every step he felt his prick rut against his trousers, teasing him inappropriately. It was not the time nor place to be aroused and Harry was well aware of that.
Harry's eyes met Hermione's for a brief moment and her face held a confused expression. He shook his head to brush it off, but she still looked deep in thought as she turned back towards the front.
Harry shuddered underneath the soft flicks of Draco's tongue against his head. The wet smacking coming from Draco's lips as he enjoyed licking up the pre-release off of Harry was a delicious sound to hear. It was driving Harry insane.
He threw his wand to the side and hooked his fingers around the bottom seam of his sweat soaked shirt. He sat up slightly in order to pull it up and over his head, throwing it in the same direction as his wand went.
His tongue swirled around the digit, greedily licking up Draco's salty arousal. He quietly let out a moan of appreciation before popping his thumb back out. He continued to clean up all of his fingers and Draco's eyes absorbed every erotic movement.
's and then float off to dream land. Why did that have to wait until the morning if that's how they both felt?
." Harry mimicked in the same tone as him. The playful grin he was trying to suppress finally made its way to the forefront. He just couldn't help himself. Draco was just too adorable.
His hand wasn't even on it yet, but he could already feel the heat radiating off of his swollen flesh.
"Daddy!" Their collective cheers echoed throughout the hall, and Draco finally felt the two boys scurry off of his feet. Before he could process his next move, he found himself staring back at two boys who were tripping over air in attempt to be the first one to the office.
As Harry approached the door, he couldn't help but detect a slight adjustment to the usual atmosphere that hung over the entryway to his dorm. He could hear quiet movements in the room, but he couldn't discern the exact source it derived from. He knew it obviously had to be from Malfoy, but that's as much as he could gather.
Draco's heart fluttered at the fact that Harry was still using the pet names he called him during their impromptu play. It made the situation feel more real, and not like it was just a one time thing or that Harry was just using him to get off. It made him feel cared for and appreciated. It was all Draco could ever ask for.
It poked at Draco's entrance and startled him, causing him to frantically search for Harry's whereabouts in the room. When he saw Harry still sitting in the old wooden chair in front of him, his eyes furrowed in confusion, but quickly changed once the member started to apply more pressure on his rim.
He popped off his member again and watched it slap against his stomach before shifting his gaze to Harry, who was now groaning at the lack of touch.
He sunk onto his knees, sandwiching Draco's face between his callused hands. His face was now inches away from the teary boy and Harry's eyes ate up every inch of his face in hopes to figure out what was wrong.
"No, my love. You have to be patient." Harry wasn't sure if he was saying this to Draco or himself. He hopelessly wanted to wrap his fist around his rock hard erection again, but he couldn't allow it.
A hand on his wrist stilled his movements and Harry's whole body was consumed in hot fiery embarrassment. He was
"Papa, look what I made!" Scorpius held up his new invention with a proud smile painted upon his face. Draco blinked back at his son with a blank expression, confused as to what he was being presented with. He stared at the abstract sculpture for a few moments in hope that an understanding would dawn on him, but it never came.
Draco's head whipped towards the front of the room, ripping his eyes away from Harry. Harry's thumb faltered for a moment before continuing to tease the cockhead between his fingers.
Draco used his left hand to swipe up as much of the viscous liquid as he could. At the same time, he brought his knees up towards his chest and spread them wide, letting his legs hang comfortably in the air. His most vulnerable parts were on display for Harry once again, still hidden under a thin string of lace.
you." Draco replied, only mouthing the curse word so the kids didn't hear, but Harry heard him loud and clear.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows in contemplation. He wasn't sure how to go about this. He's never asked to suck someone's cock before, it always just happened. He felt quite lost and he wished that Harry would take the hint.
He stroked his hand along Draco's spine until his fingers grazed upon the short hairs on his neck. he brushed through the knots until his hair felt soft to the touch.
Harry's mouth watered when he noticed the pre-come dribbling onto Draco's skin. He had the sudden urge to lap it all up with his tongue, but he suppressed the feeling.
"Come on then, my love. Work your magic." Harry patted his upper thigh in signal for Draco to make his way over and Draco obliged without hesitation.
"You try standing in front of an audience fully erect while making eye contact with a man who's masturbating to the sight of you." Draco said while fumbling with the fly on his trousers.
"I think Daddy would want some carrots on his plate, Papa." Scorpius giggled. It was only fifteen minutes ago when the dynamic in the household shifted drastically. The sugar from their 'desert before dinner' was rushing through their veins and Draco was finding it very difficult to keep them still at the table.
"Yes, carrots Papa! Daddy's just like Santa's reindeer!" Albus' spoke through laughter. "Just like his
Draco finally let his mouth off of Harry's cock, which was already growing flaccid under his touch. He rested his head on Harry's hip, catching his breath and trying to calm himself down.
"Take off your knickers. I want a good look of that gorgeous prick." Harry instructed, still swirling the head of his cock with his thumb.
"Harry—" Draco gasped, leaning into his touch. The tears threatened to spill from his wide eyes and Harry finally noticed his emotional state.
with his new living arrangements. He begged McGonagall to adjust the system, to let him stay with Ron instead, but she wouldn't budge.
Draco's right hand feverishly clawed at the air before coming into contact with the sheets and gripping onto the silk in an attempt to stabilize himself. He was up to three fingers now and his body was greedily devouring them all.
"I know so." Harry purred, a wicked grin splaying across his face. Draco whimpered at the sound of Harry's voice and his hands found their way behind his back, clasping together. "Come on. Lie back my beautiful boy. I want you to finger yourself for me, can you do that?"
"Uh, yeah. Got it." Draco replied warily. He lazily waved his arms around underneath the water, feeling the silky liquid graze upon his skin.
"So this is where all the action is tonight?" A voice cut through the sound of screams and laughter, and the noise instantly died down.
Harry seized his quill in his hand once again and dipped it into the ink pot before letting it dance about the page in front of him. Draco eyed him, completely gobsmacked and still fully aroused.
"S' only you." Draco whispered almost breathlessly. Harry's eyes lit up at the sound of Draco's voice and that unfamiliar feeling surged through Draco's body yet again.
"I've been s'good Harry. Please. I'll be so good." Draco pleaded, begging Harry for his sweet release.
He rubbed two fingers down the front of Draco's cock until he reached his balls. He pressed into the heated flesh, feeling them move underneath his touch.
"Oh, that's quite alright, my boy. You're just in time for the slide show! Why don't you join Mr. Malfoy in the back." Slughorn gestured towards the back of the room and Harry's eyes followed to search for the familiar head of silver hair.
"Almost got it, Harry! What an extraordinary guess! The last thing you would need to do is, most obviously, cut it at the base of the root."
Draco whimpered under Harry's intense stare and his hips spastically rolled about the sheets. Harry reached out with a finger and ran it along Draco's jawline before situating it right under his chin.
"...right again Miss Granger. Moondew is used in liquid form as the next essential ingredient to the draught of living death. Can anyone remind us how we might prepare that flower?" Slughorn's voice was mere background noise, fading in and out of Harry's conscious.
Draco hoisted himself up onto his knees, straddling Harry's legs. He bent over at his waist and his mouth desperately searched for Harry's thick cock.
His gestures were sporadic and frenzied. When his swollen prick met the bed, he began circling his hips, hungrily rolling his erection through the mess he's created.
Going back to the task at hand, Draco kicked himself over Harry's propped up leg and spit directly into his hand, coating Harry's flesh with a layer of it. Draco proceeded to spit into his hand again, this time wrapping it around his own cock to lather it up.
"You look a little flustered, Draco. Are you sure you're alright?" Harry pushed, not really understanding why he wasn't dropping the subject altogether. Maybe he
Harry felt the hand detach itself from his and he heard the screech of the stool slide out as Draco sat himself back down again.
It was then when Draco fully registered Harry's state. His prick was fully out and settled in his hand, watching Draco like he was a valuable art piece hung up at The Louvre.
The darkness of the hallway filled his senses and he sought out for the light switch stationed on the wall to his left. One stride forward and he was nearly toppling over Albus' stuffed pygmy puff that was carelessly abandoned on the floor. This action seemed to trigger a reaction from the end of the hallway.
He scanned the room once more to ensure that nobody caught him in the last second. Still, not a single soul was glancing their way or staring at them with wide eyes. They were safe.
He recklessly pumped into his fist, rocking his hips against his chair. His back arched into his slick movements and he let himself go, right in the middle of a potions lesson.
Harry's eyes were squeezed shut as he cried out. He was overstimulated and hyper aware of the tongue greedily swirling around his slit. His legs were squirming against the bed and the extra movement against Draco's erection sent him straight into his second orgasm.
"There's no saving you now!" He bent down and scooped him up, attacking his round cheeks with a plethora of kisses. Albus' screams crescendoed into a thunderous roar and Draco began to hear faint ringing resulting from it.
"Sorry Professor. Overslept." Harry panted, holding his wobbly knees in his hands. He swallowed down the thick spit that collected on his tongue and then gasped for more air. '
"Harry. Yes." Draco whimpered, barely audible. His movements faltered as he neared the end of the bed, and his eyes sought out Harry's. The pout on Draco's face grew prominent when the silver ones locked with the green.
Harry's hand traveled towards the button on Draco's dress pants and he swiftly unhooked it from its loop. The noise from the zipper sounded deafening in the mostly quiet room. It was almost as if it was trying to inform Slughorn about the indecent behavior taking place in the back of his classroom.
"Wow, two words now? Don't get too ahead of yourself." Harry joked, leaning in to place a small kiss on Draco's nose to ease the frustration his taunts have brought along.
It was the way his own cock twitched inside his jeans with every whimper that fell from Draco's spit coated lips. It was the way his voice enclosed around Draco's body as if they were ropes tying him to the bed while his words teased every inch of his skin.
Harry slid his hand further up Draco's leg, pausing where the inseam of the trousers met at his crotch. He gently tapped a finger against the stitching and Draco swallowed back a groan.
"I charmed the dildo. Is this alright, my pretty boy? Are you ready or do you need more time?" Harry raised his wand, putting a stop to the movements so Draco could respond.
The sound of wet slurps as Draco gagged on Harry's cock thundered around the room. Harry gripped at the sheets with so much force that his knuckles turned white.
Draco bucked his hips into the touch, even more needy for release after a five minute denial. "Hurry, Harry. Gods, I might come in my trousers."
"No, I guess not." Draco breathed, his voice timid and small. Harry could sense that Draco was unsure with himself. Even though he agreed with Harry, he still made no effort to act upon the aching lust he felt.
and Draco has never been more excited to have a cock in his mouth in his life, but that had nothing to do with the size. It was the fact that it was
Draco melted into his stool and his hand attached to his forgotten cock, not being able to disregard the aching need for attention any longer.
Draco's erotic gaze had Harry stuck in a trance. He wasn't able to do anything, but gape at the filthy movements Draco was performing on the bed.
"Papa, but you have to!" Albus whined, stomping around on the bathroom floor. This was the ultimate test and Draco knew it. If he couldn't say no to this, then who the hell knows what he will be putting himself through in the future. The thought made him shudder with fear.
"Mr. Malfoy. Come up closer to the table, I promise, it doesn't bite. Only unless you want it to!" Slughorn joked, being the only one to laugh at his attempt at comedy.
"Hey, don't let me stop you." Harry teased, finally falling out of his stiffened state and regaining his confidence. He's been dreaming about this moment for longer than he would like to admit, and he wasn't about to ruin it by not taken advantage of the situation. That is of course, if Malfoy was willing to participate as well. He wouldn't push anything onto the other boy that he didn't want.
Harry's surprise didn't linger for long. He found himself taking the lead, controlling Draco's desperate movements. The boy clung onto Harry like he was scared he would leave him, but he wasn't going anywhere. Harry wouldn't ever dream of it.
"Ha ha, very funny." Hermione rolled her eyes and nudged Ron's back, causing him to lose his footing.
"Papa no!" Albus screeched, squirming and laughing underneath him. He relinquished Iggy from his grip and as soon as she hit the ground, she rolled off towards the wall. Draco's foot was soon enveloped in his sons tiny hands, and he used every ounce of strength he had in his four year old body to push his Papa away. "'Corpus! 'Corpus, help me!"
"I—fu—My apologies Sir, but I am unable to recall how to do so." Draco struggled, his voice sounding strained. His whole body lit up in flames under the attention of his classmates.
"You're a noisy one, aren't you? Gods, I can only imagine how you'd sound unrestrained. Singing out a beautiful melody of pleasure while I fuck you into a mattress."
Their heads were just inches apart and Harry felt compelled to coat his lips with saliva. Draco watched with an intense stare as Harry's tongue darted past his lips and ran along the bottom one, leaving behind a glossy shine.
Draco, of course, didn't like that he wasn't being taken seriously and he shot daggers back at Harry. They were meant to be intimidating, but to Harry, it looked far from it. It made him want to laugh out loud again, but he suppressed it in the back of his throat.
The musty aroma in the air instantly assaulted Harry's nostrils upon slipping into the room. His eyes were immediately drawn to a debauched Malfoy who was sprawled out atop his silk bedding, as good as
It was something they never brought up. Never during the war, never after the war. They recognized that they were both severely damaged, but they would never dare initiate a conversation about it. It was vital for their relationship to be strong for one another. They were only living for each other.
Draco's body twitched and the magnetic force of Harry's cock became too strong for Draco to resist any longer. His hand automatically reached out and he laced his elegant fingers around Harry's sensitive prick. Harry let out a strangled cry at the unexpected touch.
Draco moaned, loud enough for not just Harry to hear, but also Millicent Bulstrode who sat at the front of the room. Draco quickly masked it with a cough and Harry waited a few moments for the attention to draw away before continuing.
"Gods Draco—You don't know how many times I've—" He cut himself off, choking back his spit, and then continued. "I've thought about this for so long. You for so long—Merlin you're gorgeous, Draco. Look at me, my love."
Draco whimpered, letting his eyes fall shut. He was hyper aware of Harry's warm touch on his face and the way his fingers brushed back and fourth in attempt to sooth him.
Harry peered at the empty table next to his, noticing the ingredients that were splayed out across the top.
"Come for me, Draco. Right here in the middle of class with everyone around. I want you to come knowing that someone could turn around and see you fall apart under my touch. Come for me."
Draco went to pick it up, but Slughorn stopped him yet again. "Boy, haven't you learned anything in my class! What do we do with ingredients we aren't sure about yet? I'll tell you what we don't do! We
"I love you, Papa." The words were whispered into his ear and they were instantly trapped inside his mind, echoing off the walls of his skull.
She is the strongest person Draco has ever encountered in his lifetime. She did everything to protect Draco. She wasn't just hearing the muffled sounds of a meeting from two floors down and occasionally picking up on real words. She was living in it. And it was all for
Harry was mesmerized by Draco's hands, he always has been. But seeing them disappear inside of him and come out slicked in lube was by far his favorite state he's ever seen them in.
As Harry took in the sight, he concluded that this was a new kink of his: watching a completely debauched Malfoy under the attention of a full audience.
He feasted his eyes on Draco's cock, watching the way his glistening head rutted between his skin and the fabric. He was mesmerized by the way it slipped in and out from under his knickers.
Draco hummed again, but didn't make an effort to move. He just laid there with his eyes closed and a blissful smile on his face, not a care in the world.
There was precome on his trousers and where his cock continued to tap against his shirt. He must reek of pure sex and knowing that others could probably smell him, made him even more painfully aroused.
He looked unbelievably beautiful and Harry couldn't hold back any longer. He came in his own hand with the thought of painting Draco's sharp features with his seed. Thinking about spilling inside of the warmth of Draco's mouth.
him that Harry was in that building. He had no cogitation of what they assigned him to. He obviously wasn't filling out paper work because that's what Harry did
"Papa. We Merpeople. Me, you, and 'Corpus." He stated, pointing to everyone as he acknowledged them. Draco instinctively turned to glance at Scorpius when Albus' tiny finger waved in his direction.
"Hey." Harry cut him off. He took Draco's cheek in his hand and caressed the smooth surface with his thumb. "Of course I can do that for you, there's no need to worry. This is all for you, remember? I'm here for
Harry ran his fingertips over the outline of Draco's bulge and he watched as the boy shuddered underneath his touch. Harry was truly fascinated by the way he was able to make Malfoy melt with just a simple caress.
Sure, Draco had no idea why Harry had such a reaction; he believed it was out of discomfort from him being so close, but that didn't mean it wasn't
"Harry please." Draco breathed, reaching his hand out to grab ahold of Harry. He clutched the cotton fabric of Harry's shirt in his fist and tried to pull him up.
Hesitant, Draco decided to respond with, "what are you playing at, Potter?" Harry noted that his usual defensive tone seemed watered down with arousal. He couldn't help but let the corners of his mouth twitch up into a smile.
"Such a pretty boy." Harry's words of endearment were almost enough to cause Draco to spill all over his silk sheets and make a mess of himself.
The whole bed started rocking back and fourth with Draco's body as he began to pick up the pace. His hips moved in sync with the silicon object, meeting it half way as it hit against his sweet spot every time.
"Add another. I know you can do it." Harry ordered, wordlessly summoning the lube for his own needs. Draco didn't seem to notice. He was too dazed out while fucking himself on his fingers.
Harry wrapped his own arms around Draco's back, drawing circles into his pink tinted skin. He snuggled into Draco's touch, squeezing him in fear that he'll slip away.
Harry's hands were gripped around the arms of the chair, his knuckles white. He refrained himself from stroking his cock any more, saving his erection as a treat for Draco after he was finished. He knew he wasn't going to have to wait much longer, but the agonizing pain he felt was growing unbearable.
"Papa you have to be King of Mertown. You just have to be!" Albus splashed around in his space, still overjoyed by the fact that his Papa agreed to play with them.
"I don't want to hear a single word from you, alright? Do you understand me, Draco? Not a single sound from those pretty lips of yours." Harry warned and Draco's face instantly lit up. He wanted to chuckle at the humorous sight, but swallowed the sound back down before it could come out.
time. I did tell you when I came in to not let me interrupt you, didn't I?" It took everything in Harry to
He desperately tried to compose himself. His tie was loose, his buttons were in the wrong holes, and parchment threatened to escape out of his satchel. His nimble fingers worked at correcting every error pertaining to his appearance so that he could look presentable when he stepped into class.
"Stop." Harry heard a small whisper coming from his left and he was so overcome with relief that he almost stood up right then and kissed the very lips that spoke that word.
His hip movements grew spastic as his prick jerked across the hair covered skin. He was a moaning mess, which was doing a number on Harry's overwhelmed erection.
Harry sucked in a sharp breath as Draco began to fondle him, kneading and tugging his sac with gentle care. The extra hand on him and the pull on his foreskin was drawing him dangerously close to finishing.
"Does someone not remember what happens when little boys are around fat feet?" Draco asked, lifting his eyebrow in question.
He leaned in and placed a soft kiss on Draco's nose, not being able to resist the urge. At the same time he reached around Draco's backside and pinched his cheeks. Draco jumped back with a yelp and scrambled down towards Harry's legs.
"That's it, Draco. So so pretty." Harry praised, raising his head to appreciate the beautiful image of the boy leaning over with his lips hugging his cock.
He could identify the fact that they were still holding onto their sugar high from the chocolate he let them have hours before. He was just waiting for them to crash, which he felt might be soon considering the show of tears they're putting on right now.
Draco rode it out against Harry's leg, continuing to drain every drop of Harry's seed from his prick. The come felt hot on his tongue and it tasted utterly divine.
give Draco what he was asking for, but he wanted to tease him. He wanted Draco to beg for him. Harry found it so incredibly hot that it made his knees weak.
The way Draco's tongue poked out in concentration as he leaned into the table was driving Harry insane. He idly wondered if Draco would take the hint if he stood up and left to 'use' the restroom. Harry concluded that he would, but he didn't think he could manage a trip to the men's room in his current state.
"Now who can tell me the other potion that uses powdered root of asphodel as an ingredient?" Slughorn scanned over his students for any raised hands. Draco's head whipped toward the front of the room, remembering their current location.
"That's not what I'm asking. Do you think you would be capable of it?" Harry whispered. He noted that their faces were only inches apart from one another. He could stick his tongue out and run it along the curve of Draco's lips. It was tempting.
Spreading his knees further apart, he slithered a gentle hand past his hard cock and pressed a single finger to his already pulsing hole hidden under the lace string. It didn't feel as pleasurable as it could have, considering he wasn't lubed up, but he mostly did it for the visual effect. He was putting on a show, was he not?
Even with Harry's reassuring words, he was still quite embarrassed to express his wishes out loud. He rolled his head off of his elbow where it was propped up against and stuffed himself face first into the covers.
Draco tilted his head in order to see it from another angle, but doing so still didn't seem to help him figure it out, so he gave up on trying to solve the mystery.
As they stood in the ensuite, Harry ambled up behind Draco and enveloped his arms around Draco's waist, pulling him flush against his chest. Harry's lips instantly found their way to Draco's neck like a magnet and they quickly got to work by pressing quick kisses below his ear.
"Just making sure you're alright. Can I not do that?" Harry raised an eyebrow, questioning him. His eyes flickered down towards Draco's adam's apple and he watched it as it bobbed with every swallow. The sight was erotic and images of him sucking on his sensitive skin ran through his mind.
Draco sat achingly still, not daring to move a muscle. He desperately tried not to think about Harry's previous movement, but his breathy sigh was still echoing around in his head.
"Wouldn't dream of it, Malfoy." Harry chortled back and Draco slowly removed his hand. Harry followed suit, detaching his own contact from Draco's erection. Draco whined softly in displeasure, ready to seize Harry's hand once again and position it back on his cock.
"Harry, Harry—Oh fuck—Harry." His name kept rolling off Draco's tongue like a mantra while he drowned in self pleasure. Draco made a strangled noise and he reached out to clutch the sheets beside him.
"Alright pick up the knife. Remember, it is best if you crush the bean with the side of the blade." Slughorn guided and Draco reached out for the tool with a shaky hand.
The only noise Harry could hear was the muffled requests coming from Draco, but he didn't understand a single word he was saying. The sight made him laugh inside of his mind, but he didn't dare to let it sound out loud. He knew it was hard enough for Draco to vocalize his desires, and he wasn't going to make him feel even worse about it. Even if it was a humorous sight to behold.
Draco's breath caught in his throat and he let out a strangled moan, arching his back against the bed.
"I want you to come for me Draco. I need you to come for me, darling. I don't want you touching yourself, okay? Just let your hips do all the work."
"Ah yes, Miss Granger!" Slughorn called enthusiastically. Draco's eyes followed to where Harry's friends were seated, just a few rows ahead of them.
Water spilled over the edge of the tub and pooled on the tiled floor, but Draco couldn't find it in himself to care. He could barely hear his children's laughter over his own as he screamed out for mercy.
"I only swing from Daddy's arm for now, okay?" Albus peered up at Draco, staring at him with wide, innocent eyes.
Did that mean Harry was going to let him down in the morning? Surely he would come forward now if this felt as real to him as it did for Draco. They could do their quick exchanges of
"Pretty in pink, I see." Harry gestured towards the lace panties that were hugging Draco's hips. His face grew almost as red as the
He could feel Harry's hearts beating underneath him, drawing more attention to the reality of the situation.
raising them to be strong, polite young men. I think you make one hell of a Father." Harry reassured, squeezing Draco's shoulders in his hands.
"Oh—Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck." Draco repeated under his breath as he rolled his hips into Harry's delicious grip.
Harry bucked his hips up, desperately fucking his own fist. He needed to slow down. He was already so close to spilling over and he had no intentions of stopping their fun any time soon.
"So good, Draco. It's so good." Harry praised under his breath and watched as Draco's innocent eyes peered in his direction, almost as if he heard his approval.
Draco lowered himself down onto the freshly wet surface and lined up his erection with the flesh beneath him. He flushed his bare chest against Harry's thigh and situated his face back in front of Harry's cock.
The fluctuation of his sing song groan brought Draco back to earth. It was then when he began to remember why he was in the bathroom in the first place.
"Touch yourself. I want you to fuck yourself on those pretty fingers. I want you to pretend it's me."
"Draco. No." Harry's expression was stern, his eyebrow raising in challenge as if saying: 'Go on, do it. See what happens, then.'
The gesture was innocent, but at the same time so incredibly erotic that it made Harry's member twitch. It wanted nothing more than to be under Draco's touch.
Harry could sense how plump Draco's cheeks were as they slid across his unclothed skin. He was hit with the sudden temptation to grope them in his palms and knead his bum until they turned crimson under his touch.
He quickly realized how off schedule he was when he stepped into the eighth year common room and noticed there wasn't a single soul in sight. It was then when his muscles began working on their own and they swiftly carried him to his destination.
He would grip his hips so tightly that Draco would wake up with his fingerprints bruised into his pale skin. He wanted nothing more than to mark what should be rightfully
Harry finally let go of the softening prick and tucked Draco carefully back into his trousers, cleaning him up with a wandless cleansing charm before quickly fixing himself up.
to live with Malfoy, but for all the wrong reasons Harry never dared to envisage previously. But at least him and the boy got along now, that should be good for something, right?
"Oh no." Ron stopped in his tracks and froze, his features showcasing his trepidation. It was enough to draw Harry's attention and force his body upright in concern.
Harry had no idea where all of these filthy words were coming from. The only thing he knew was that it turned him on and he didn't see himself stopping anytime soon.
Draco arched into a full body spasm, his heavy cock shuddering in Harry's hand. "Yes. That's it, Draco. Come for me."
Draco wanted to call out, but instead he held his tongue between his teeth and surveyed Albus as he tumbled to his knees to cradle the plush toy in his arms.
Harry's promising words floated through the air and grabbed at Draco's beating heart, closing around it in a warm embrace. It was all he needed to hear to know exactly how Harry felt.
"I told you, I'm just making sure you're okay." Harry answered, reaching out for the broken utensil. Before Harry could grab it, Draco threw the pieces off to the side, launching them across the back of the room.
"Ok, ok, I'm sorry." Harry held up his hands in surrender and that goofy grin featured on his face once again. "It's only me, remember. You can tell me what you need and I'll give it to you. I'm not going to make fun of you for it." His joking tone shifted into one more serious, letting Draco know he meant every word he spoke.
Draco's eyes flitted down to the floor before he made his way after his children, and he spotted the pink fluff of Iggy once again abandoned on the floor.
He would reply. Draco knew this was probably not true—to an extent at least. The relationship they had through Hogwarts was something Draco still couldn't quite explain.
As they made their way through a handful of homes, they quickly discovered that the exploration of the bedroom that could potentially be theirs, was the most sentimental. It felt so intimate. It was their space to
He sensed the change in texture when his palm reached his lace knickers. He let his hand linger over his bulge for a moment, tickling the head with the pad of his finger. A wave of moans drew out of his own throat and his legs dropped from above him and on to the bed, his skin rubbing against the silk sheets.
"What?" Harry hesitated and a familiar feeling of dread crept up his spine. It almost made him nauseous.
Harry's words erupted through Draco's body with so much force that it drove him right onto Harry's lips. Draco was sloppy and uncoordinated, but he couldn't find it in himself to care.
"In case you forgot," Harry started, using his opposite hand to hold down Draco's hips against the seat. "We are in the middle of potions right now. You need to control yourself or we'll get caught."
"It's just easier for me and I'll be able to make you feel really good, I—" Draco spiraled into an explanation. He shouldn't have asked. He knew he shouldn't have asked. He was making a fool of himself.
Harry's other hand found it's way to his own swollen prick and he began to stroke it in time with his fist on Draco.
Harry, on the other hand, was loving every moment of this situation as he pumped a tight fist over his cock.
"So is this what you get up to every night when I get back from the common room?" Harry casually asked, pretending to take interest in the pieces of parchment lying on top of Draco's desk. He ran his fingers over the smooth wood of the chair, waiting for a reply.
"Hello?" Slughorn tried again and the room bursted into millions of whispers, all wondering what was wrong with Draco Malfoy.
Harry threw his head back, basking in all of Draco's touches and caresses. He groaned loudly and bucked his hips forward in search of Draco's mouth.
"Princess Papa! We come to take over!" Scorpius shouted, hanging off of Draco's right shoulder. Albus was clutching onto the opposing one in a similar stance as his brother.
"Yeah, I guess." He said, absentmindedly tickling the end of his quill against his bottom lip. His eyes flickered towards the other boy and he noticed that Draco's gaze was drawn to the movement. He shook himself out of his trance and his eyes jumped up to meet Harry's.
And each time their eyes locked, Harry's chest felt so warm that it suffocated his insides. He was falling for the git and nothing in his life would've prepared him for that.
"No! Papa! No Merpeople out of water!" Albus screamed over the sound of water filling up the porcelain tub. They were in Harry and Draco's ensuite. It was their favorite bathtub to use when they played 'Merpeople' because it was considerably large. Actually, it was probably bigger than Harry and Draco really
"Do you think Daddy will like my dance I did for him?" Scorpius asked, his hands gripping the sides of the dark oak desk. Draco made sure the ink pot was set aside and out of reach. That was a disaster just waiting
He lifted Scorpius out of the tub and continued with the same pattern of movement, drying him, hugging him, then kissing his face.
Dousing his cock with more lube, he grabbed the base and squeezed firmly causing him to let out a strangled cry. With his opposing hand, he trailed his fingers up his shaft, pressing his thumb on the nerve point just under the head.
He could feel the air flow running between his cheeks and tickling at his rim. He naturally spread his legs wider and arched his back.
Soon Harry was withering under Draco and his balls clenched in his grip. The white spurts of Harry's come hit the back of Draco's throat and he moaned at the taste. He suckled on Harry's opening and the second wave of Harry's ejaculation hit.
Draco let out a deafening moan and his eyes rolled back in pleasure. Draco continued to grind down on Harry, leaving desperate kisses all along his hip bone.
about what you have to offer. I'm rather busy focusing on something else entirely and you should be following in my footsteps as well."
"He looks like he was just properly fucked." Seamus joked to Dean, who rolled his eyes and elbowed his ribs, laughing along with him.
The two boys didn't dare to stop and think about what was going on. This was so unlike anything they've ever done before. It was so out of their element, but it was also oddly natural between the two of them. They slipped into their roles seamlessly, almost like they did this every night.
sound, he lifted the soft fabric of Albus' hippogriff t-shirt (a joke Harry came home with one day. I mean really, it's been
He wasn't sure when the transition went from 'King' to 'Princess', but he decided to not correct them. If it made them laugh, who was he to tell them to stop?
Draco succumbed to Harry and finally crawled over top of him, relocating himself across Harry's chest. He snaked his arms around Harry's neck and hugged him tightly.
"Walk Papa! You have to walk, okay?" Scorpius instructed like it was the most obvious thing in the world. Like Draco should've
Harry drew lazy circles on the back of Draco's hand, slicking it up with left over lube and pre-come. Draco's own hands were fairly dry at this point, but Harry still noted that he was holding onto the hand that Draco fucked himself with at the beginning of the night.
"I thought something was actually wrong." Harry retorted, feeling considerably less slumberous than he was moments ago.
Prince. I explain, okay?" Albus drew in a breath of frustration and his eyebrows scrunched together.
The amount of times he cried himself to sleep at the age of 17 in his four poster bed at the Manor. The way he could hear the monster of a man from two floors below speaking thoughts of how he planned on torturing Harry Potter in
"I love it." Draco made sure he looked interested enough for Scorpius' liking. He had an intense focus on keeping his laughter at bay. He blurred his vision in attempt to hide the image from his mind. He was so close to accidentally letting out a cackle right in his sons face and he wasn't trying to break any hearts tonight.
His head tiredly rolled over Harry's shoulder and stopped when his face was pressed against his neck. Draco breathed in the musky sent emanating off of his warm skin and he pressed his lips upon the soft flesh.
"Let's start with the first ingredient, the powdered root of asphodel. You should have learned this in herbology, but I'll jog the memory for those of you who might've forgotten. It comes from the plant asphodel, also known as
"Great." Harry quickly peeked at the rest of the room before noting that nobody was paying them any mind. He acted fast and placed a brisk kiss against the corner of Draco's mouth before pulling away completely.
When he didn't get one, he panicked only for a moment before realizing that he wasn't being hexed into oblivion either. Noting that that was probably a good sign, he decided to push his luck even further.
"Mine. Not Harry's." Draco stated. His face was now an inch away from Harry's and he stared coldly into his eyes.
They already finished devouring their meal (with a fourth of it still on their faces), and Draco decided to get a start on creating Harry's plate for when he arrived home. A simple task, really. At least that's what Draco thought it would be. '
"It's fine." Harry finally spit out after a few seconds of regaining his composure. He began drawing careless swirls across his paper again, mentally thinking about scenarios that would initiate the flaccidity of his erection.
The small whimpers escaping his mouth sent Harry over the top. His erection was painfully hard, but he wasn't going to let himself have the pleasure of stroking it quite yet. He needed to cater to Draco's needs before himself.
The intense emotions hit him all at once. Suddenly the foreign emotion he felt earlier began to make sense. Harry Potter owned his whole entire heart and for some reason the revelation didn't upset him. It didn't anger him or make him shut down. It made his eyes well up with tears.
Draco's only response was another whimper, quiet this time and Harry found himself feeling proud of his control.
"And what do you plan on doing when I get up, might I ask?" Harry cocked an eyebrow, demanding a response. He knew what Draco had in mind, but he wanted to hear him
and smiled innocently up at Harry before reaching out and taking the shaft in his hand. He gently shook it around before leaning in and tapping the head against his lips a few times, placing small kisses on it each time.
"Need you so bad, Harry. So so bad." Draco's words slurred together, drunk on pure sex. His hand found its way back to his arse and he immediately began fingering the ring of muscles between his cheeks. "I'll be so good for you. Promise."
"Fuck." Harry breathed out and his hand instinctively sought out for the sweaty waves of hair on top of Draco's head. He entangled his fingers through the untamed locks and gripped at his scalp. Draco drew out a long cry of pleasure around Harry's cock and the vibrations sent shivers up his body.
He's had some pretty ludicrous ideas in the past, but Harry thinks wanking in the back of a classroom takes the medal for his worst.
Harry had to refrain the urge to vigorously pump their cocks as the wet sounds would be a dead give away as to what they were up to.
"You both are. You're gonna be the greatest wizards of all time." Draco replied, not holding back the growing smile on his face.
"Something wrong, Mr. Malfoy?" Slughorn placed a supportive hand against Draco's shoulder to steady him.
"I think I'm gonna call it a night." Ron announced, his words slurring drowsily. Hermione followed with a quick agreement, stretching her arms above her head and yawning.
"Fuck." Harry cursed, squeezing the base of Draco's cock which encouraged a quiet, indecent moan to slip past his lips.
Harry's right hand was completely soaked in his own bodily fluids and it continued to be coated in sticky liquid as he discreetly thrusted into his tight fist.
It took Harry's mind a few moments to grasp onto what Draco was asking him to do, which was a moment too long for Draco's anxious mind.
"We are bad guys!" Scorpius shouted, bright eyed and gleaming back at Albus. "We take over the town!"
Knowing that Draco would be good to go, he placed his wand on the desk behind him, leaned back in his chair, and worked his own magic on himself.
"What are you playing at?" Harry's ears picked up on Draco's whisper, but he pretended he didn't hear the question.
The delectable whimpers pouring out from Draco's throat was music to Harry ears. He loosened his firm grip on his cock and lightly shook it around, focusing on the feeling of his sensitive head tapping against his shirt.
This morning was different, and for a minute he felt disoriented after his eyes absorbed the bright sunlight pouring into his dormitory through the tall windows. It was typical for him to wake up to the sunrise. Every morning he watched the beautiful view while perched against the window sill inside of his joint dormitory.
"Harry." Draco drew back, breathlessly whispering his name. Draco on the other hand, still had images of Harry playing with his hard prick on the forefront of his mind. He wanted to show Harry how much he meant to him. He was never good at expressing his emotions with words.
"Not sure why I said it like that." Harry said honestly. He let out an embarrassed laugh before looking down at the blank parchment laid out in front of him. He dipped the tip of his quill into the jet black ink and mindlessly created abstract shapes across the page. He was desperate for a distraction. Anything to get his mind off of the heat in between his legs.
Now, he could still declare that he took in his environment with amazement, but he definitely couldn't say his intentions were completely innocent. Not when he was close to orgasming while watching his debauched childhood enemy crush ingredients at the front of the room.
Right now, the two boys were head first inside the fridge, their faces flushed and tingling from the cool air.
His cock twitched in his hand as he stoked upwards towards the head, pulling his foreskin up in the process. It rolled over his cockhead, covering it in an erotic embrace.
"Wha…" Draco replied breathlessly with his eye lids half shut. He subconsciously swiveled his hips to move his swollen prick against his slick fist.
"You think so?" Draco whispered, seeking more of Harry's approval while he lowered himself back on to his haunches.
They were clouded with lust, desire, and something else Harry couldn’t quite figure out just yet, but he knew his eyes were mirroring the same exact emotions.
Harry held the small piece of metal in between his two fingers and tugged his fly down, opening the flap and exposing his pants underneath. He pulled out his swollen member and gave it a few strokes before massaging the spongy head in his palm. He lifted his chin and stared directly at Draco who now stood at the front.
The words echoed in his head, stuck on repeat like a broken record. It was the same Harry he met years ago on the train, eager to please the boy he has heard so much about while growing up.
"Shit." Draco muttered under his breath and discreetly fumbled to shove his swollen cock back in his pants and button it close.
"No, you hold it, ok?" He pushed the creation closer to Draco with a huff and Draco's eyes began to strain, forcing him to refocus the world around him again.
Harry's eyes scanned every feature on Draco's face and his smile grew larger by the second. Draco couldn't help but grin back at the man and his heart fluttered like he was a bloody sixteen year old with a school crush.
Harry stared back with dark eyes, fisting the locks of hair tighter in his hand. Draco whimpered and his eyes faltered back to his prize ahead.
"Tastes so good." Draco groaned breathlessly before impatiently picking it back up and latching his mouth back around it. He slurped up Harry's juices greedily, swallowing as much as he could. Draco was making such a mess with his spit, it began to pool amongst Harry's pubic hair.
"Harry—" Draco breathed out, his teasing finger trailing over his crack. His legs were now back up in the air and bent at the knees, giving him full access to his own arse.
"That's fair." Draco innocently leaned in closer to get a decent view of the lines he was creating and it made Harry's body physically tense up.
"I'll try." Harry chuckled, knowing it was inevitable that Draco would find himself left alone with the kids once again.
"Harry?" Draco vacillated quietly. Harry rolled his neck around to peer back down at him. Harry's strong stare almost deterred Draco from continuing, but he then reminded himself of the conversation they previously had.
He maneuvered around Draco's body, settling himself back in the same position he found Draco in when he entered their room. Images of Draco withering on the sheets ran through his head like a flip book and his hand automatically drifted down towards his erection.
"I am not going to feed Mr. Malfoy to a throng of angry wolves, Mr. Potter. You are the only one I can confide in to ensure his safety. I assumed I could trust you with a task as great as this, was I wrong?" Was all she had to say to shut Harry up. He had something to prove now and he wasn't known to ever back down from a challenge.
Harry licked his lips at the thought, picturing the pretty stain of Draco's orgasm pooling against the fabric of his uniform.
"Yes, he'll love it sweetheart." Draco reassured, ruffling his curls up. "Now I think we have some 'cheesy cheese sauce' to get to if I'm not mistaken."
"Not right now. We will talk about it in the morning. Right now I just want to lie here and take care of you if you'll let me. Does that sound alright, Draco?"
"The powdered root of asphodel is also used in the Vitamix potion. The effect of the potion gives the drinker a burst of energy, which greatly sharpens their reflexes." Hermione answered loudly, but to the boys in the back of the room, it sounded like it was coming from down the hall. The voices in the room began to fizzle out again.
The base of the creation was built with all different colored legos, not having any real pattern to it. '
"My love, not yet, okay?" Harry reached out with the hand that released his prick moments ago and clasped it around the one that was still held out to him. Draco let out a small sigh of pleasure, eating up the contact from Harry's skin.
"Princess Papa?" Scorpius questioned while meeting Draco's gaze. Albus began to cackle and hit his small hands against the bubbles that littered the waters surface, sending droplets of water flying in every direction. He was acting like it was the funniest thing in the world, and to him, it probably was.
He felt proud of himself when he heard a low groan coming from Harry's direction. Unable to hold them up for much longer, he let his legs fall to the side and his extremely erect prick was now on full display.
"It is best to not approach the plant until it is standing fully erect. It will comply to your touch more easily, giving you full reign to its root for harvesting." Slughorn continued to speak as Harry gently stroked Draco's erection through the fabric of his trousers. The boys hips bucked up in his chair, searching for more pressure to relieve the ache.
His fingering on the page was more harsh than the previous soft flicks of the parchment between his fingers. He didn't even realize his change in movement until he felt the paper rip beneath his grip.
He removed his hand from Draco's hip and placed it on top of his own crotch, palming the achingly hard outline through his trousers.
"Merlin, am I raising them to be spoiled brats when they grow up?" It was a genuine question, but Harry seemed to think it was
Harry soon found that Draco's presence was shockingly enjoyable when he let his guard down. Surprisingly, their personalities flourished together when they weren't shoving hateful comments down each other's throats.
He watched as Harry lifted himself up, his erection coming into view once again and it made Draco salivate instantly.
"Well alright, you little brat." Draco teased and wrapped his hands around the base of the toy, releasing it from his sons grip. Scorpius let go
"Up." Draco whined, pulling harder at his top, but it was not effective considering how weak he felt after the ejaculation he just experienced.
He rolled his hips, fucking his fingers frantically and Harry stared, his eyes darting over the scene not knowing where to look. "That's it, Draco. Such a good boy riding your fingers for me."
The hand that was around Harry's length dropped down to fondle his balls. This gave Draco's mouth access to the full length of Harry's phallus and he couldn't wait to sink further down on it. So that's exactly what he did.
"Like I said, don't let me stop you. A boy needs his pleasure, it would be rude of me to stop you, don't you think?" Harry cocked his head to the side in question, lifting an eyebrow. His tongue slipped past his lips and coated the bottom one. At the same time, he allowed himself to take in the view.
"See my love? All you have to do is ask and I'll give you anything you need." Harry began to push up on his knees, preparing to stand up. He felt Draco's hand fall from his shirt and he watched it hit the bed.
"Papa almost hurted her! He going to squish her with his fat feet!" Albus exclaimed whilst dramatically laying down on his back and holding Iggy up above his face. "I save Iggy from fat Papa feet!"
His hand found its way back into the patch of curls hugging Harry's now limp prick and he absentmindedly combed his fingers through it. His eyes fluttered shut and his body went limp against Harry's leg, completely spent and exhausted.
"Look! 'Corpus! I found Iggy! See?" He beamed, shoving the pink ball of fluff in Scorpius' face causing the poor boy to go cross eyed.
"Since you asked so nicely..." He trailed off and went to collect Draco's dripping come in the palm of his hand. He rubbed in the slimy fluid with his fingers, coating his hand up in the natural lube.
Draco's fingers grazed over his own pale skin and his hyper sensitive body twitched underneath his touch. His finger drew teasing circles around one of his erect nipples, while his left hand began trailing down towards his half hard prick that was hidden beneath
He arched into his own touch, urgently seeking out for more. His feet dug into the mattress, frantically flailing them about. An overstimulated Draco was certainly a sight to see and Harry found himself lucky enough to witness it.
"That's quite alright, Professor." Draco had never felt more humiliated in his life, standing in front of his classmates as he desperately tried to suppress a moan.
Squeezing the base of his cock, he drew his eyes away from his it and back to Draco. His complexion still appeared to be flushed and the tips of his usually tamed hair was beginning to curl.
"S'good. Fuck, so good Draco. So good for me." Harry praised, transitioning from a gentle teasing on his cock to palming himself through his jeans. He watched Draco squirm about the bed, desperately rolling his hips up into the air.
This intense craving and need to be loved, not just by anyone, but by Harry, has been brewing ever since the day he met the small boy on the Hogwarts Express, he just didn't understand it then. It just made him angry.
The pre-come that gathered atop his slit spilled over and Draco's eyes followed the bead as it dribbled down the length. Draco's tongue caught the salty liquid before it reached his hand and he moaned in approval, indulging in the delicious flavor.
Harry didn't have a direct view of what he assumed would be a glorious sight, but still, the image of Draco laying on his stomach and knees with his arse propped in the air was doing a number on him.
"Draco—" Harry swallowed. His eyes were fixated on Draco, devouring every twitch of his body and every expression written on his face.
"Finger yourself, my love." Harry slid further down in the wooden chair and rolled his hips upwards, pleasure instantly surging through his entire body.
He wiggled his bum up in the air again and let out a stubborn whimper, moaning Harry's name repeatedly. He hoped he would look too irresistible in Harry's eyes to say no again. He hoped Harry would give in and pound him into the mattress until he saw stars.
"I said I'll take care of you, so I'll keep my promise to that. If you come any closer, this ends. Do you understand?"
Draco's hand found its way to Harry's bollocks and he massaged them in his palm, encouraging his sweet release. His tongue was repeatedly lapping at Harry's slit, begging for his come. It didn't take long for Draco to get what he wanted.
"Such a pretty cock, Draco. Wish I could see the rest of your body. Want to see your pretty little hole clench around the air, begging for my cock." Harry's voice was hushed, almost inaudible in fear that someone would overhear him, but it was still loud enough for Draco to pick up on his seductive words.
"Hurry, Daddy! I show you my legos now!" Albus impatiently tugged at Harry's trousers and Harry reluctantly pulled back from Draco to acknowledge his son.
Ron's high-spirited expression transformed into one more sombre when his friends words registered in his brain. It was a delicate subject within their small group, rooting from the many scares they've had over the years. It was a natural instinct for Harry to assume the worst, and sometimes that fact slipped Ron's mind.
They were all seated at the stations in front of his and Draco's, leaving a row of empty ones in between. It was normal for Draco to situate himself in the back of the room. He preferred to keep a low profile nowadays.
With a pair of Harry's swim trunks on (because he couldn't find his own, of course. Not because he just wanted to wear Harry's), he shamefully trudged back into the ensuite with his head hung low. He ordered his boys to wait on the floor while he went to change. He's aware of the fact they they're old enough to be in the water while he steps out for a moment, but it still freaks him out nonetheless.
"Maybe then you would use your opposing hand to stroke it, that usually calms most herbs. Of course I only know this from experience with other
He didn't have the heart to tell Scorpius that Harry wouldn't actually see his dance. He prayed to Merlin and anyone else listening that Harry would go along with it. He could be quite dense sometimes.
"Of course that's what you would focus on." Draco laughed, breaking his character of a damsel in distress.
"Hey! What happened to the 'I miss you so much, Harry! Please come home now! Fuck the Ministry tell them to bring my husband home!'?" Harry mimicked Draco from his letter. This earned Harry an extra punch for swearing once again in front of their children.
"So tight 'n perfect for me. Such a beautiful bum, Draco. Look how badly it wants to be filled. Filled by my cock. Watching it pulse, begging for me—Merlin Draco, I could come right now."
Frustrated moans broke past Draco's lips, vocalizing his disagreement. Draco's knees gave out beneath him and soon his whole body was lying flush against the mattress.
He shifted uncomfortably on his stool, subtly trying to rearrange the placement of his erection so it wasn't straining against his pant leg. Something about Draco's low tone was not helping his problem in the slightest.
His right hand was drawn to his erect nipples, just like they were before Harry came in. The residue of lube trailed along his chest as he drew mindless circles over his skin. Draco puckered his lips and blew out cold air along his sternum. The air instantly clung onto the wet surface and his whole body reacted beautifully to the sensations.
Draco arched his back and Harry was able to make out the gorgeous curves of his arse cheeks that were held proudly over his head.
The warmth of Draco's mouth was intoxicating to Harry. Amazingly for him, Draco loved having it there. His tongue tickled every surface and swirled laps around the inflamed skin. His taste buds were on high alert, taking apart and examining every unfamiliar flavor.
Draco bottomed out with a cry and squeezed his eyelids shut. Before he knew it, the dildo was sliding back out and ramming into him all over again.
"Is this okay?" Harry asked, trailing his finger along Draco's jawline. His hot breath tickled at Draco's lips and entered through the opening of his mouth. All Draco could do was nod his head in agreement.
"You taste delicious, Draco." Harry praised after sucking on his last finger. "I wonder what you would taste like around my lips."
"Papa, come on!" Scorpius stood at his feet with his small hand held out to Draco's. "It okay, Papa. It will be fun." Oh how Draco hoped Scorpius wasn't lying.
"Asphodel can be used for both magical and mundane reasons. Usually you wouldn't see straight asphodel as a potion ingredient, but rather powdered root of asphodel, which is what we see here." Harry registered Slughorn's voice and the reality of being in a classroom settled in Harry's mind once again.
But he understood everything now. The way he felt under Harry's fixation, the excitement he got after riling him up. He always made sure he was the center of Harry's attention.
Harry repeatedly brushed back the sweaty silver locks of hair that clung to Draco's forehead. As Draco rode out the aftershocks, Harry shushed him through it, whispering praises into the thick air of the room.
since the incident and he still found it funny?) and blew raspberries on the soft skin just above his belly button.
Fire pooled low in Draco's abdomen and his bollocks drew up in anticipation. He was babbling nonsense, whining and moaning out Harry's name in the midst of his incoherent sentences.
Harry's arm covered his closed eyes and his opposite hand threaded itself in Draco's hair. Draco hummed in appreciation, leaning into his touch with a soft smile on his face.
It was a difficult task though. If Harry could get away with it, he would be bending Draco over the lab bench and fucking him senselessly into the cold metal tabletop.
"Stay." Draco demanded, looking directly at Harry's right leg. Harry couldn't help, but chuckle at the boy.
"Bossy too." Harry observed, smirking back at the pout forming on Draco's lips. Draco stared back at Harry with wide pleading eyes.
Draco couldn't help, but think. Coming up from the base were two tower like structures, made of blue and purple legos.
The ritual he did with the kids wasn't something Draco ever partook in. It was Harry's special greeting for them and he never found himself on the receiving end. Harry's moves were graceful and gentle, and he understood why the kids loved it so much. He felt special.
"Sorry, the knee. I apologize for—" Harry's arm began to speed up and Draco was lost again. Lost in his own headspace where only him and Harry existed.
"Mr. Malfoy. You look quite dreadful. Are you running a fever?" Professor Slughorn questioned, but the boy completely ignored him.
Don't get Harry wrong, Malfoy was still an insufferable git that made Harry's insides churn every time he spoke, but now those feelings began to pool lower down in his groin rather than his stomach.
"Come here." Harry gestured towards Draco, who looked pretty content where he was, gently twisting away at the wiry curls.
"Oh my—fuck me—nrghh." The moans escaped past Draco's lips with little effort. His mouth was now wide open and Harry found himself imagining he was shoving his cock inside.
"I can't allow it! This is my Kingdom, Princes! You can not dethrone me!" Draco fought back, pretending to put effort into pushing his clingy children off of him.
"Drop your hand, Draco. I want you to stay just like that, can you do that for me?" When Draco moaned a quiet approval and lowered his hand, Harry casted a spell on the phallic shape. It was a charm to let an object work on its own, but Harry was still able to have some control over its movements. Harry read about it in a book one afternoon while being forced to sit in the library with his friends. He knew it would come in handy one day.
"No." Draco growled and then proceeded to dramatically go through the process of lifting his knee back up, more rough this time.
"—and then Prince 'Corpus will come in? Got it now Papa?" Albus finished and Draco realized he just missed the whole of Albus' explanation.
"Just dandy, sir." He gritted through a toothy smile before stomping down on Draco's foot. His hand immediately unlatched from Harry's crotch and went straight to his leg to cradle it.
when I came home. You were the loudest out of the three of you!" Draco rolled his eyes, but the smile on his face was still prominent.
of the refrigerator, his teeth clattering as he went through the vegetable drawer to find carrots for his Dad.
Draco, lost in his own world of bliss, rolled his head to the side, feeling the soft silk sheets caress his cheek. What he didn't expect was to see Harry Potter staring back at him.
He was late for his lecture, having overslept the first pleasant slumber he's had in a long time. He was accustomed to waking up at five in the morning with sweat soaked pajamas and an exceedingly high heart rate.
"Looks good." Draco managed to get out before swallowing back another whine of pleasure. His eyes met Harry's once again as he stood back up, noticing their wild and hungry stare.
Slughorn's giddy expression faltered when he took in Draco's appearance. He looked ill, sweat trickling down the side of his flushed cheeks. Slughorn brushed it off, knowing it could be quite humid in the back of the room on occasion.
"I will be right here next to the tub to play, okay? See I can still see you guys when I'm sitting here." He demonstrated by sitting on the damp rug that was placed at the foot of the bath.
"Holy fuck Draco. So fucking vulgar." Harry growled low in his throat. Draco let out a breathy laugh on top of his hand, the cool air hitting the wet surface and making his hair stand on end.
Draco's body shivered, the erotic words slipping off Harry's tongue were definitely taking a toll on him. Draco's moves were hesitant. Harry was definitely the one with all the confidence in the room right now. He pushed the thought to the back of his mind though, knowing it would only cause him to spiral if he dwelled on it for too long. He
Harry believed that Scorpius looked adorable like that, though. It was only for the shear fact that he did resemble Draco.
"Need you." Draco reached out his arm in front of him, grabbing at the air towards Harry's cock. His hand hovered a foot away from where the boy was lounging back in his seat.
Draco's inner self spoke and Scorpius clambered towards the couch, carefully holding his masterpiece in his hands.
Draco's opposing hand curled around Harry's shaft, squeezing the hot flesh with gentle care. His lips littered wet kisses underneath the swollen head as he began to stroke at the base.
He took a few careful steps in Draco's direction, making sure he stayed upright. His swollen member was in Draco's direct line of sight, positioned half a foot in front of his debauched expression.
"Gods gift to the world, right?" Harry teased, noticing Draco's glazed over stare on his hand. "Come on then, show me how a pretty boy like you would put it to good use." Harry's words danced off the tip of his tongue and they affected Draco immediately, sending him into a flurry of soft whines.
Since Harry still had the vial of lube next to him, he silently accioed Draco's dildo over to him. Just like the last time Harry used the spell, Draco was oblivious to it. He was more focused on his own hand snaking back between his crack.
Harry ran his tongue over Draco's bottom lip, coating it with his own saliva. For a moment, he forgot about his erection completely. He was too worried about Draco to care about his own pain.
"It's not good to hang from things like that, Albus. It's not safe. You could've gotten hurt, or your brother could've gotten hurt." Draco's voice was soft as he calmly tried to explain the situation to his boys. He could see the cogs turning inside of Albus' brain. As he desperately tried to process the information, Draco remained silent in order for him to put the pieces into place for himself.
"It's good that you got some rest." Draco's whisper cut through Slughorn's voice and Harry's attention was instantly drawn back to him.
Draco took a moment to watch Harry through his eyelashes. His eyes were dark and suggestive, unlike anything he's ever seen before. He felt a tight pull on his lace panties as he devoured the sight. His prick was jumping with excitement, desperately trying to break free from its restraint.
Harry clicked open the lid to the lube and directly spilled it onto his angry head. The contrast of the cool liquid as it hit his heated member sent waves of pleasure up Harry's body. He took his prick in his right hand and stroked it up towards the head, letting the pad of his thumb circle his slit.
"Fuck Draco, such a good boy. Doing such a good job. Fuck." Harry breathed, letting another moan rip out of his throat. The feeling of Draco's tongue slithering around his length alongside the feeling of Draco's cock rutting against his leg was overwhelming.
Harry lowered himself onto one knee, directly in front of Albus, and slipped a towel around his tiny frame before engulfing him in a tight embrace. He placed a loud kiss on his left cheek, then his right, one on his forehead and finally two soft pecks atop his button nose. It was a ritual he did every time he got off of work, whether it was him coming back from the Ministry or him coming out of the home office.
"Hurry 'Corpus!" He chortled out, letting his guard down for a beat. Draco took this temporary moment to remove his foot from Albus' grip without hurting the little boy.
"Oh fuck." Draco's head sunk back to the bed, his eyes fluttering closed in pure bliss. The silicon prick pushed through the first ring of muscles slowly, careful not to hurt the body it was intruding.
"Hello King Papa, I here to be Prince!" Albus' started after explaining how the game will work. Draco guessed that he didn't explain it well enough, because he was still confused as to what they were doing exactly. He could've sworn they were the 'bad guys'.
"Albus Severus, get off of the refrigerator door right now!" Draco ordered, scrambling towards them in panic. Albus was hanging off of the door handle, lifting his feet up in the air and swinging back and fourth, completely oblivious to the dangers that could unfold. Scorpius was now sitting
His tongue ran gently over Harry's slit, lapping up the bead of pre-come that threatened to spill out. The bitter taste mixed with the salty flavor of Harry's sweat created the perfect concoction. Draco was salivating profusely.
"Look how wet you are." Harry said, fascinated by the slick shine that coated his full member and the string of cloudy precome that dangled from the slit.
He lowered himself down onto Harry's knees and wriggled his bare arse over the newly exposed skin. The hair on Harry's legs stimulated his exposed bottom and he visibly trembled over the sensation. Draco flashed Harry a wide smile, unable to contain his excitement.
Harry, who looked like a deer caught in the headlights, could feel the beginnings of his own arousal as he ate up the delicious sight ahead.
Harry's fingertips ran up and down the sides of Draco's towel covered arms as he placed one quick peck to his forehead followed by two small kisses on his nose.
The soft silk felt delightful against his erection. The smooth surface teased every inch of his skin as he rolled his hips down harder into the mattress. His gaze never faltered from the fierce green eyes that looked back.
Harry's grip faltered, wanting to savor this moment rather than finish so quickly. He slithered his hand down lower and he rolled his balls in between his fingers, pulling on them and kneading them with the palm of his hand.
When eighth year began, he felt sorry for the boy. It was like the Malfoy he once knew was dead and all of the life was drained out from behind his eyes. For some peculiar reason, the sight of him looking so fragile strained Harry's heart.
"Harry. Oh, fuck, Harry." Draco keened, his eyes falling shut as his head rolled back on the cushion. He looked thoroughly debauched. His hair clung to his forehead in wet waves and his lips were slicked with his own spit. Harry wanted nothing more than to attack them with his own.
. I'll take care of you, yeah?" And with that, all of Draco's worries drained out of his body and were replaced with a deep unfamiliar feeling that painted his skin with gooseflesh.
He shifted his weight on his feet and spun around to face his troublemakers. He didn't know whether to laugh at the sight folding out in front of him, or have a heart attack.
"What's got your knickers in a twist? It wasn't like I made a joke about the birds nest that resides on your head." Ron questioned, adding a cheeky remark at the end. It wouldn't be Ron without a tantalizing comment. All in good fun, of course.
He used his lips to swirl his spit around the slit before seductively looking up at Harry through his eyelashes and taking the full head into his mouth.
"So hot." He breathed out, not being able to tear his eyes away from Harry's lap. Harry teased at Draco's slit with the pad of his thumb, swirling around the bead of precome that spit out.
This opened a whole new territory that Harry desperately tried not to cross. He found himself watching Malfoy do simple tasks, like folding his clothes and putting them away or brushing his hair in the morning.
The small blissful smile across Draco's face as he looked up at Harry with wholesome eyes was what almost made Harry succumb to Draco's wishes.
Draco's glossy eyes honed in on Harry's movement and he instinctively licked his lips. The sight looked utterly delicious.
Draco was the first to pull his hand back, but it was only when he lifted it towards his face when Harry understood why.
"Never mind, you're too far gone to understand, I'm afraid." Harry smiled back at the boy and he found himself wanting to kiss those pouty lips once more.
Harry's fist twisted along Draco's length, coming almost fully off of it before plunging back down. The hand on Harry's thigh subconsciously inched towards Harry's balls, desperate to feel the heavy warmth in its palm.
Harry held his head down for a few moments while Draco gagged around him. The sensations felt too good to let go so quickly. He eventually let Draco pull himself back up his shaft, tugging up his foreskin as he sucked in his cheeks. He twisted off the tip, letting Harry's cock bob against his stomach.
"I wanna see those pretty swollen lips around me, taking me all the way in." Harry's hand untwisted from Draco's hair and made its way along his jaw, settling under his chin again. He tilted Draco's head up to look at him and ran the pad of his thumb against Draco's plump lip, rubbing his spit in.
The boy's light headed movements were sluggish as he returned to his previous position on his back. Sweaty tufts of blonde splayed across the emerald pillow case that was propped up against his headboard. The subtle leverage of his head granted him the alluring view of Potter.
His grip tightened on the desk chair and he pivoted it around on it hind legs so that it was facing Draco's bed, giving him the best seat in the house. With swift movement, he slipped into the chair and spread his legs wide in a dominant position.
"Fuck." He breathed out and glanced down at Harry's hand that was dangerously close to his cock. "I'll keep my hands still, Harry. You do it. Get me off, please. Need you so bad." Draco whined and wiggled his hand out from under Harry's.
lying next to him. Harry was tempted to point that out as well, but decided against it. "Sit up then, let's get a good look."
He felt a chuckle rumble in the depths of his chest and escape through the smile on his face. He closed his eyes, shaking his head in amusement. "Yes, only from Daddy's arms from now on."
"You have no idea what you do to me, Draco. Fuck, no idea." He moaned and rolled his head back, basking in the relief his prick was feeling under his attention.
In that moment, Harry concluded that he would be the one to restore Draco's happiness. It was difficult at first, and at times it still was, but he's made an immense amount of progress, and it couldn't have made Harry feel more elated with the outcome.
Draco quickly scrambled to sit up with Harry and his breath rapidly increased in rate. He sat back on his haunches in the middle of the mattress and patiently waited like the good boy he is.
The same classroom he sat in as an eleven year old boy years ago, whose intentions were completely innocent as he took in his environment with amazement.
Disregarding the insistant pain in his chest, Harry's hand slid back up to his prick as it bobbed against the fabric of his button up shirt in excitement.
Draco's eyelashes fluttered at the seductive motion and his lips parted slightly. He couldn't help but draw in a shaky breath.
Draco's eyelids flew open at the reminder, absorbing as much of the scenery as he could. Sure enough, he was still situated in the back of the classroom as Slughorn droned on about the draught of living death.
pick it up with our bare hands! You never know the reaction it could cause. Crouch down so you're level with it."
He could only hope no one would be using the utensil after him, considering his own precome would soon be smeared all over the handle.
"Yeah! We bad guys!" Albus' added, hanging off of Harry's neck while chewing on the edge of his towel. Draco sheepishly stared back, wondering why the hell he hasn't made an effort to move yet.
"Harry." Draco whined, drawing out the last syllable of his name. He was achingly hard and desperate for Harry's touch to be back against his thigh.
Harry leaned in and placed his first kiss, right under Draco's eye on his left cheek. He pulled back and instantly shifted to the right side, touching his lips to the softness of Draco's skin.
Harry took one look at the come soaked sheets and wandlessly spelled them clean. Draco stared back at him in complete awe.
"Want your cock." Draco mumbled, still looking down at the sheets. His grip on Harry's shirt tightened, eagerly pulling at it once again.
From Albus already creating white long beards out of soap, to Scorpius utilizing a plastic strainer to make it "rain" on Draco's head, he was a giggling mess.
"Are you alright?" Harry finally spoke up and swiveled his neck towards Draco to give him his undivided attention. Harry devoured the sight in front of him, looking for any hint to help him solve the boys distress.
Draco whined in protest, lowering himself on his fingers a few more times before reluctantly pulling out. Harry made sure he was staring right at Draco's swollen hole, not wanting to miss the way it repeatedly clenched around the air.
"Harry, can you recall from herbology how we would handle the plant in preparation to cut it at the root?" Of course Slughorn would ask him a question in this very moment. Harry had no idea, of course, but he'd be damned if he didn't take a wild guess.
It wasn't like he had a big stomach, although that wouldn't matter to Draco if he did. What he did have was a small beer belly growing in and to Draco, it was all the more for him to love and cuddle with.
These days it was incredibly rare to stumble across the famous Harry Potter roaming the long corridors in the ministry and Draco preferred to keep it that way, although he had a feeling they would be seeing him more frequently in the future.
"Albus, can't I be like the Little Mermaid? She had legs, didn't she?" Ever since their Auntie Hermione, also known as Auntie Nee by Albus, played the Lion King for them, Rose, and Hugo, they've been obsessed with all things Disney.
Draco held his open mouth over the head, blowing hot air against the severely red skin. Without making Harry wait any further, he captured the tip inside of his mouth and closed his lips around the thick flesh.
"I know how it feels, Iggy." He breathed out and stepped over her, making sure he didn't stumble over her again.
Draco's hand flailed under the table, searching for anything he could grab onto to ground himself. He latched onto Harry's thigh, gripping the fabric tightly as he struggled to keep his squirming body still.
