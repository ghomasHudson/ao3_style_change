Hermione smirked thinking of their former Potions professor. "Why not you take Draco with you? Snape always loved Draco. It might soften him into telling you some stories. Plus I am sure Draco would love a chat with Snape."
Hermione’s eyes went wide. “Bloody hell is right! Harry, are you sure? It is a huge step and you have not been with Draco long.”
Hermione smiled at Ron. “Oh Ron! I am happy to see that you got your stubborn head out of your arse finally.” All three laughed. “So where do you want to start shopping? Muggle or wizarding shops?”
Hermione smirked. “I am glad I was there to help. Oh, I know how helpless you would be without me.” She teased. “So do you have a plan for the proposal?” Kreacher popped back in with the tea and left a moment later.
Remus rolled his eyes at Sirius. “Of course you want to sleep even though you have been dead love. Though, a good cuddle with you sounds like quite nice.” He kissed Sirius on the cheek. Sirius blushed a bit.
For several minutes she just stared at the letter. And without another word, she picked up the doe figurine and placed on the floor in front of the desk and stepped back from the figurine.
Harry got up and hugged her. "Thank you for always being here for me. Say hi to your parents for me. Sweet dreams to you as well. I love you too, Hermione."
Harry looked at her nervously. “Would it be stupid to ask Ron to come along? I know we’ve had some rough times but this is such an important moment and it just doesn’t feel right without him.”
Harry collapsed on top of Draco. Both felt boneless. It took them a few minutes to collect themselves.
Draco grimaced and nodded "You really do not have to, Winky. I am not very hungry. Do not bother making breakfast for me."
Draco pulled Harry into an intense kiss as they made love. Harry sped up a bit to Draco’s surprise. “Love, do-on-n’t stop.” He whispered.
Narcissa looked at her son. "I doubt he would do that. He saved us for a reason and I am sure he would not be that petty."
Hermione gave him a lovely smile. "You are not half bad company yourself. Let me know when you are not otherwise engaged and we will certainly have tea together. I will be seeing you soon, Sev."
Hermione stood up first. "Well, I best be getting back home. Thank you for breakfast. And I truly am happy for you both."
Once inside Harry conjured his stag and it walked between him and Draco as they walked to the visitor area. The guard steered them into a room and when they looked inside, there they saw a disheveled Lucius waiting for them.
Harry blushed. “Don’t be such a wanker! I asked them to visit, Ronald. And it is my house. I can choose who to invite. I didn’t want to tell you this especially in this way but Draco and I are more than just friends. We’ve been together for awhile and he has been living with me. I’m sorry I should’ve told you sooner but it was never the right moment.” He looked at his friend awkwardly as he moved closer to Draco.
"I most certainly did. I am glad he contacted me. And why are you smiling like that? You are making me nervous." Draco said.
"It's fine, Draco. Really it is. After everything I'm just happy for her and Luna. To be honest, I was a bit surprised though. How about you? Dating anyone? I always thought you were with Parkinson." Harry said.
Harry was curled into Draco’s side when he woke up. He thought of their first time the night before and smiled to himself. He kissed Draco’s shoulder but the love of his life did not move or make a sound so he got up to use the bathroom and get dressed. Harry checked if Draco had woken up but he had not. He quietly went down to the kitchen to make himself breakfast. During his meal, Harry received an owl from Narcissa about coming for tea. He replied that he would be there around one o’clock. He looked the time and realised how late it was. It was already noon. Harry quickly finished his breakfast and quietly went back to the bedroom he shared with Draco, only to find Draco still asleep. He was surprised but he knew it had something to do with their activities the night before. He tiptoed out of the room to use the guest bathroom to get ready for tea at the Manor. After he was finished getting ready, he checked on Draco one last time. Harry kissed him on his shoulder again and left a note for him on the nightstand saying he was summoned by Narcissa.
Narcissa looked at both boys and smiled. "Who is ready for some tea? I certainly am. Winky, bring us some tea and sandwiches please."
Severus nodded. “Very well. I am quite pleased to know that you will be living with me soon. Let me know when you have discussed everything with your parents and I will come by to assist you.” He smiled softly at her.
Severus’ eyes went comically wide. “Uh, Hermione, uh, you would like to be my wife someday and take my last name?” He blushed a bit. “I mean, I would be honoured if you took me as your husband. I just want to make sure you are not making a rash decision.”
As Harry arrived back at Grimmauld Place, Draco greeted him angrily. “Potter, I woke up and you were gone. You should have woken me up to say goodbye. I mean after last night I thought you would have enough sense not to disappear and not have me wake up alone. At first I thought I dreamt it all. Loving you and being with you but then I looked around realised that it really happened and the person I love just up and left after we were intimate. What was so bloody important? I saw the note you left. What did my mother want that was so important you could not wait and say goodbye to me?” He was livid.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Do not think you are getting out of telling me what I witnessed upstairs you two." Giving them a stern look.
As Severus approached the floo, he waved as he disappeared. He landed gracefully in Grimmauld Place. Once he had dusted himself off, he looked around to spot Hermione but he did not see her. He wandered into the kitchen and there she was getting afternoon tea ready. Severus watched her for a few moments before he announced his arrival. To his astonishment and delight as he thought about the two witches who had stole his heart, he realised Hermione was everything Lily was not. He could not help but smile. Severus cleared his throat to get the witch’s attention.
Harry held Draco’s hand. “I would like to say something. Whatever was in the past, I can’t think of a better present with all of you. I propose a toast of sorts. Here’s to new beginnings and snakes shedding their old skins! Out with the old and in with the new! I truly love my new family.” He smiled like a loon.
When Harry and Draco righted themselves and saw that Severus was there smirking. “Well, Potter still clumsy as ever I see.” Something caught his eye. “I suppose congratulations are in order.” Eyeing the rings on their left hands.
Hermione watched Severus thoughtfully. "Thank you for your kind words regarding my parents and Ron and helping me calm down earlier. I truly appreciate it. And I hope you do not mind me calling me Sev. I never asked if it was all right to do so."
Harry's head whipped around in shock and stared at Draco. "She's with Zabini? I wasn't expecting that. But I'm glad she found someone. Hold on, did I hear you correctly? You're not into women?"
Potter smiled at Winky. "Thank you Winky. I appreciate it. And you may call me Harry if you'd like."
Draco blushed at what she said. "Thank you, Hermione. I really appreciate your support. It means the world to me." He gave a bright smile.
Harry looked a bit shocked at Draco's admission. "Dray, umm, I want to be with you. I enjoy kissing you much more than I should considering we are supposed to be only friends for now but I don't want to be your friend. Honestly, I want to be your boyfriend. I don't want to wait! Screw everyone else! The people who matter most to us already know that we have feelings for each other and accept our relationship and just want us to be happy." He reached out and took Draco's hand.
Harry smirked at Lucius. “About that, Severus has been resurrected due to his sacrifice and Dumbledore’s sneakiness. And Severus does accepts us, you bloody git! Without having to be a spy, he is a pretty decent bloke. And he is more of a man than you ever will be, Lucius. You are weak and always will be.” He sneered at Lucius and smiled at Draco.
Hermione playfully smacked him and laughed. "Very true. You two are quite the pair. I hope he comes to his senses. Losing your friendship all because of his opinion on the Malfoy family is pretty idiotic. I will talk to Molly and hopefully he will get an ear full from her and starts to see the errors of his ways. Either way, I think you will get support from most of the Weasley family. Knowing George and Ginny, they will have a running bet on how long it will take you and Draco to get together officially after hearing about your friendship."
Harry looked at him. “Are you sure, love? There’s really no rush.” He placed his hand on his face and leaned forward and kissed him once again.
Hermione gave him a worried look. "I think it is time to start calling our former professor by his first name, Harry. But that is besides the point, why did Severus summon you? What happened?" Giving him an expectant look.
Severus was at a loss for words and grimaced. “You can not be serious. I am a Death Eater. You can not possibly trust me that much. Um, this was a mistake. I should not have come.” He looked away from Hermione and started to stand.
Again Severus sneered. "Ahh, the brightest witch finally speaks. But let me get this straight, you all thought it was a brilliant idea to say that incantation without knowing what it would do? Though, I suppose I should be thankful that you, Miss Granger, were the one who used the incantation to resurrect me considering your friend, Potter here, can be quite incompetent with his magical abilities. Regardless of Miss Granger's abilities as a witch, this reckless idea reminds me of when Potter used my very own sectumsempra spell against my godson in sixth year without thinking of the consequences." Harry looked at Snape sheepishly and diverted his eyes from his former professor as Hermione looked surprised and she blushed at Snape's words.
Harry smiled widely at him. "Brilliant! I was hoping you'd say that you'd like share my bed with me. And Dray I will always try to keep you safe." He kissed Draco's cheek and pulled them into Harry's bedroom.
Hermione stared into his eyes. “I know we have not been together very long but I want to be as close to you as possible.” She turned bright red. “We do not have to do anything but I need you, Sev.”
Harry faced Draco and placed his hand on Draco’s face. He looked into his eyes and slowly closed the distance between them. At first it was a slow, chaste kiss. Draco pulled Harry as close to him as possible to deepen the kiss. They both moaned into the kiss. When air became an issue, they pulled away from the kiss.
Narcissa pulled away and gave him a small smile. “It was worth the risk. I wanted to give you the best possible wedding gift.”
Lucius watched them, still sneering, and spoke calmly. “Well, I suppose it makes sense that my son is a poofter. You were always obsessing over the Boy Who Lived for years. You rarely shut your gob about him until Voldemort was resurrected. It was not natural how you nattered on about him and when you ceased your prattling I guess that is when you formed these repulsive feelings for The Chosen One.” Draco was blushing a bit and could not look at his father.
Harry paced back and forth in the sitting room, thinking about what he had discussed with Draco and what Narcissa had said to him. He was going to marry Draco and spend the rest of his life with the man he loved. All he could think about was finding the perfect engagement ring. Something caught his eye as he continued to pace but he couldn’t focus. Hermione was suddenly in front of him looking worried.
Both ate their dessert but Draco kept eyeing Harry curiously. When they finished, Kreacher cleared the table once again.
Harry chuckled. "And you're quite the mood killer, Malfoy! Though I do agree, we've been nattering on about our feelings for quite awhile. By the way, the Sorting Hat almost placed me in Slytherin but negotiated myself into Gryffindor. I know the shock, the Saviour of the Wizarding World almost ended up in Slytherin. The press would have had a field day with the information. And imagine if that actually happened. Everyone would think I was the next Dark Lord to rise. Though, after fellow students hearing me speak in Parseltongue, it started the rumour that I was the next powerful dark wizard. One of the worst moments in my Hogwarts days. Everyone was being so ridiculous. Such abhorrent behaviour in my opinion."
Potter's face soured a bit. "Mrs. Malfoy, it's slow going but it will be ready for the fall session. At least that's what Headmistress McGonagall has been saying so far. She's impressed by the progress everyone has been making. Actually, you and Draco should come by and see what we've been doing."
Molly interrupted with an announcement that tea was ready and everyone bustled into the cramped sitting area. At first, it was in silence but then everyone relaxed and started talking about a variety of subjects.
Narcissa chuckled softly. “All I need to know? Oh, so you are holding back on me. And what is this “all I need to know” involve, I wonder. Should I continue to poke fun at you until you tell me?” She teased him mercilessly.
Harry smiled so widely and responded by kissing Draco with such fire. And Draco quickly responded back with just as much fire. Harry pushed Draco down flat on the bed without breaking their kiss and straddled him to deepen the kiss even more. Both were moaning and they could not get enough of each other. Harry pulled away desperate for breath. They were panting heavily.
Hermione laughed softly. “Sev, are you forgetting that we have magical abilities? If you would like, I could show you my memory in the pensieve.”
Draco sniffled a bit. “I am not in the mood for surprises, Potter. I just want to stay in bed and feel sorry for myself.” He sighed.
Before anyone else could say anything, Draco launched himself forward and hugged him tightly. Draco was gasping for air as he was sobbing into his godfather's robes. It seemed when Severus heard him sobbing, he immediately wrapped his arms around Draco and rested his chin on top of his godson's head.
Draco snuggled into Harry and kissed his neck softly. “Harry love, I think I need some rest after that. Care to join me?” He smiled impishly.
For a few moments nothing happened. All of the sudden, the air swirled around the figurine. The doe looked like it was dissolving and the particles were churning in the air. Minnie, Hermione, Draco and Harry all stared in wonder as the particles started to form into something solid with black fringes. The shape of a human being materialised but there were no distinguishing features. The particles seemed to be vibrating until they shattered into a million pieces and vanished into thin air only leaving just the bat like Professor Severus Snape. Everyone gasped in shock.
Sirius spoke up. “Snape. I mean Severus.” He looked at the floor. “Umm, I understand your ire but I do not think you should attack Narcissa for what she did. She wanted to help Harry and show him how much she loves him. I believe this was her way of telling him, bringing us all back for him.”
Harry holds Draco tightly. “I will be there with you while you tell him and if he acts up I will lay him out on his arse for being a racist arse. I promise you will not have to do this on your own, Dray.” He kissed him on his cheek.
Draco sheepishly looked at Pansy. “I was trying to impress him, Pans! At the time I did not know that he was treated like a house elf at his relatives’ home. I seriously thought everyone worshipped him. None of that was true though. He did not even know he was a wizard until Hagrid told him. How was I to know?” He frowned at Pansy.
Ron was seething and red as a tomato. He looked like he was about to blow another gasket. Before he got a chance to respond more people arrived by floo.
Harry laughed. “Narcissa, you are bloody brilliant. I don’t think I’ve seen Severus blush like that before.”
Hermione's eyes sparkled with happiness. "Do you know what he has planned for the next get together?"
Harry nudged Draco back. "Thank you. I'm sure I'll find an appropriate time to get another pet. Funny you should mention learning Parseltongue because Ron knows some from me talking in my sleep so I think it's possible to learn it like any other language that exists. I could teach you if you would like."
Hermione kept opening and closing her mouth as she struggled to form words. She finally gathered herself enough to say something. “I, uhh… Sev, I am not sure what to say. There are no words to truly describe what I am feeling right now. I am so over the moon happy.” She smiled brightly at him.
Draco yawned. "Dray, I think it's time for sleep. Let's head upstairs. Kreacher will clean up the table." He grabbed Draco's hand and his suitcase and they headed upstairs.
Draco huffed out a laugh. "Of course, the Saviour talks in his sleep. How am I not surprised? Why don't you start teaching me after you get yourself a snake? That way I could practice properly."
Hermione blushed and looked at him curiously. "Thankfully I was able to find my parents. And with the help of some doctors and nurses at St. Mungo's, their memories were fully restored. Gosh, they were furious at first but they realised and understood that I was just trying to keep them safe. And with Ron, I am so incredibly relieved that there was no ugly breakup fight. That would have been absolutely devastating for everyone involved and I am not sure if our friendship would have survived such a trauma, Sev." She gave him a sad smile and saw how he smirked when she called him Sev.
Draco was in shock and wasn't sure how to respond. He kept opening and closing his mouth trying to form the appropriate words. "I can not lose you either, Harry. You have always been a fixture in my life. I do not want to imagine my existence without you. Until now I never believed in the phrase 'there is a fine line between love and hate' but you challenged my belief and I am glad that you were the one who opened my heart to forgive and move on from my past. I also never thought this kind of connection could exist because of how I was raised. I mean look at my parents. My mother keeps informing me that my father was much different in the beginning of their relationship but it is a little hard to picture my father actually happy and at ease. My mother was the only one who really showed me love. I know that sounds insensitive considering your upbringing with the dreadful Dursleys. But you also had the Weasleys and they are the very definition of a loving family. I can see that now after experiencing such terror in the Manor. I still feel uneasy in my family home. No matter how many renovations my mother has done to it, I will never feel safe there. It is forever broken. But then I reconnected with you, and I feel safe once again. Like everything is going to be alright. I feel like I have a bright future and it, of course, involves you. I finally look forward to living again. I have you to thank for that because you defeated Voldemort and you gave me another chance. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure I am not dreaming. I know that sounds silly but it is the truth." He smiled fondly at Harry.
Harry nodded. “Fair point. I can always ask Molly for help.” He leaned into Draco. “Thank you for your support in all this. I couldn’t handle it all without you. I love you, Dray.” He gave him a soft kiss.
Harry finally acknowledged her presence. “Oh Hermione! Thank Merlin you’re here! I need your help.” He gave her a panicked look.
Harry had tears staining his cheeks. “Narcissa, I don’t know what to say. This is truly the best gift I’ve ever gotten other than your son’s heart. I can’t believe you would risk your life for me again.” He went over and hugged her. “Thank you.”
Blaise and Pansy see their best friend and attack him with a double hug. “What are you two doing here?” Draco looks at Harry suspiciously.
Throughout his childhood Draco kept hearing about The Boy Who Lived and he was always curious about the hero. His father was livid that Potter "defeated" Voldemort when he was a baby. Though it was really Lily Potter who defeated Voldemort since it was her ultimate sacrifice and love that kept Harry safe.
Harry slowly pushed himself inside of Draco until he bottomed out. Both needed a moment to catch their breaths before continuing. Draco nodded and Harry pulled out and pushed in a bit faster. Once Draco was acclimated to Harry’s size completely, Harry started to stroke Draco’s erection again. Draco begged him to go faster and so he did. Both were chanting each other’s names.
Harry smiled fondly at Draco. "I'm just relieved that the whole Voldemort ordeal has ended and we can all move on with our lives. Ever since I lost Hedwig, I haven't been able to think about getting another pet. I still miss her terribly. But I do think my next pet will be a snake. It'll give me someone else to chat with. I know that makes me sound mad but I always enjoyed my conversations with snakes."
Hermione smiled back. “That would be lovely if you helped. Oh! I am so thrilled that we will be living together!” She blushed. “And before you know it, we will get married. Can you imagine me as Hermione Snape?” She gasped at what she just said.
Hermione had tears in her eyes. “Ohhh Harry! You deserve everything good in life and I am incredibly happy that Draco is that for you. I did not realise how deeply in love with Draco you were. I mean I knew that you were in love but not this invested in it. I saw you getting married but not this soon. With that being said though, I support you and of course I will assist you with getting an engagement ring.” She smiled widely.
Hermione bit her lip nervously. She squeezed his hand and lifted her other to his face. Slowly she reached out and touched his chin. Hermione turned Severus’ head so he was facing her. “Sev, please look at me.” And he did. “Please do not be embarrassed considering I had been the one who said that I wanted to kiss you in the first place as I was leaving the Manor the other day. Honestly, I have been hoping upon hoping that you would ask. And to answer your question, you most certainly have my permission to kiss me.” She blushed as she stared into Severus’ eyes.
Narcissa gracefully sat at the table and she instructed Harry to sit as well. “The reason for this visit involves Lucius. I went to see him yesterday and I need to talk to you about what he said and what happened.”
Hermione squealed a bit. "Oh my goodness! Harry that is just the sweetest! I really do hope you get that future with Draco. You both deserve happiness especially together."
Hermione poured tea for them. “Sev, honestly, I do not know. Ron has always had a cruel streak in him. Both Harry and I have been exposed to it unfortunately. It is most certainly not fair to us that he uses us, his best friends, as his own personal punching bags. It is why I snapped and actually punched him which is the second time I have ever hit someone. That first someone happens to be your godson when we were in third year. Both deserved it for being bloody awful.” She smirked.
Draco had tears running down his cheek. “Yes, Harry James Potter, I would love to marry you and one day call you my husband.”
Hermione shyly looked at Severus. “Yes they left and will not be back until late. Sit, the tea is ready.” She placed everything on the table. They both sat down.
Harry smiled. “Actually, Narcissa has saved the day twice. She lied to Voldemort in the forest and now you’ve brought my family back. I really don’t know how to thank you for everything you’ve done.”
Once Severus was ready, he went to say goodbye to Narcissa. “I am heading out. I am not sure when I shall return.” He smiled at her.
The morning after the debacle involving the infamous Lucius Malfoy, Harry wanted to lift Draco’s spirits up. He quietly left their bed and went downstairs to compose letters to Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini, his boyfriend’s best friends. He sent his owl to deliver the letters. Now all he could do was wait. In case Draco’s friends did not write back, he opened the floo and added their magical signatures to the list of people who had access to his floo. Harry turned to go back upstairs but was interrupted by two Slytherins arguing and stumbling into his living room. In front of him was Pansy and Blaise bickering like a married couple. Both stopped dead in their tracks staring at Harry. It was one of the most painfully awkward moments in his life and he had his fair share of those.
Draco gave him soft smile. "I am also quite pleased you are back as well. And thank you. It means the world to me that you support me. Mother was thrilled to know I was planning to date Harry. We are not really official yet but it is only a matter of time. We wanted to give everyone a chance to get used to the idea of us spending time together but in private and with people we trust we show more affection."
Draco kissed Harry on the cheek. “It may not have cheered up me up but it most definitely distracted me from yesterday’s cock-up with my father. Thank you for trying. I love you with all my heart, Potter.” He softly kissed Harry’s lips.
Headmistress McGonagall whispered the chant to open the gate. Both Harry and Draco stepped through the threshold of Hogwarts. McGonagall smiled at them both. "Welcome back, boys. Please call me Minnie since you are no longer students. What is your business here at Hogwarts?" She looked at them curiously.
Once they were on the floor that Harry's bedroom is on, Harry turned to Draco. "I was wondering if you would like to have your own bedroom or you could stay in my bed with me. It's up to you. No pressure."
Draco opened the gate and locked it behind himself. When they approached the front entrance, Narcissa greeted them. "Severus! How is this possible?" She was shocked to see him.
Harry gave her a sad smile. "I always thought the same thing about Ron. I guess we'll see if he comes around. If he doesn't, I'll tell Molly and I'm sure she'll get him to see sense. She usually does."
Harry put his arm around her shoulders and squeezed. "You're right. I'm sure whether he's back to his normal annoying self or not, it'll be an enjoyable visit. Oh Hermione, I really can't wait to see Draco again! I know it sounds silly but I miss his company already. I'm being ridiculous, aren't I?"
Harry looked between the two Slytherins. “Umm hello welcome. I have called you here because yesterday, Draco had a dreadful experience. I thought it prudent to contact his best friends to cheer him up. I know we’ve never gotten along in the past due to unfortunate circumstances but I think that should change.” He stopped his rambling.
Narcissa came forward. "Hello Harry. It is lovely to see you again. I wish it were under different circumstances. Draco is resting at the moment. Before sending for him, I was hoping to talk with you first. I was wondering if we would be possible if Draco could stay with you for awhile. I think he desperately needs a break from the manor. I would understand if that would be too much but you are the only person aside from Severus I trust with the care of my son. I know how much he means to you and I feel you would take great care of him." She smiled warmly at him.
Severus' eyes visibly widened at the nickname because that is what Lily used to call him before Hogwarts and their early years at school. "I suppose you make a good point, Hermione. Though Draco has you and Harry now." He smiled sadly.
Back in the sitting room Draco was still holding Harry who was had stopped crying. They were snuggled into each other when they were interrupted by someone shouting.
Draco stared into Harry's eyes like he was hypnotised. "I slept quite peacefully. Laying next to you did the trick. I am so grateful to have you by my side. I am really lucky." He smiled at Harry.
Harry sighed nervously. “I plan to propose to Draco tonight. I was hoping you could make his favourite meal and dessert for tonight. Also, don’t say anything to Draco.”
Hermione turned to Harry. "How about you come home with me? It will give Severus and Draco a chance to catch up." She smiled fondly at Draco and Severus. And Severus' eyes widened and he looked because of her use of his first name so boldly but it also warmed him since it was the first time since Lily that someone called him by his first name in such a lovely manner. He actually noticed everyone looking at Hermione in a strange manner except for Minnie who was smiling.
Hermione chuckled a bit. She takes his hands in hers. "Harry I really am happy for you. I hope Draco gives me a chance to be friends with him. And I have always wanted to talk potions with him. He is bloody brilliant at them! Have you decided when you will see each other again?"
Both were panting and moaning. “Potter, I need you to fuck me now.” Harry pulled out his fingers and Draco stopped him. “I want to face you while you are inside me.” Harry nodded, knowing he would not be coherent if he spoke.
Draco went to Harry and took him by the hand. He lead them to a sofa where he held Harry close as he cried softly. Draco gently rubbed his back and whispered sweet nothings into his ear, to help calm him. They silently sat there for what seemed like hours.
Harry stared at the tray. “Thank you. Yes he’s a Slytherin and he loves expensive items.” He nervously laughed.
Harry looked at her. “I’m not sure your reaction was why he broke down. Lucius said some pretty beastly things to both of us. I do agree with you, Narcissa. I didn’t think it was the best idea to visit either but I supported Dray’s decision to confront his father and I didn’t want him to be alone when he did.” He gave her a sad smile.
Severus chuckled along with her. "I think you have every reason to worry especially when Weasley is involved in Golden Trio shenanigans. But in this case, I think Harry is in good hands. I trust Draco to keep him safe even if it is from Harry himself. Speaking of Weasley, I thought you two were an item but the way you talk about him it does not convey that. I do not mean to pry if you do not wish to share certain information." He looked a bit embarrassed about asking personal questions.
"My darling Draco, that is something you will have to ask Mr. Potter himself. He is the only one who know the answer." Narcissa said coyly.
Harry places two tea cups onto the kitchen table and got milk and sugar. He gestured Draco to sit. He poured the tea for them both and sat down next to Draco.
Hermione looked at him sympathetically. "Here's an idea. Draco, you could come with me and use my floo. And from there you could apparate."
Again Severus sighed loudly and turned back to face Narcissa. “Bloody hell woman! Why must you know everything? You know what, forget it. I will just tell you so you leave me bloody well alone. We kissed a few times. One was quite passionate since I know you will ask about what type of kisses we shared. However, I am not telling you every sordid detail of our encounter.” He huffed out the response and turned on his heel and walked away leaving Narcissa before she could say anything else.
Sirius finally looked around and visibly relaxed. “Does this mean Voldemort is gone for good? Bloody hell! I never thought I would see that day!” He smiled and chuckled. “Where is Lucius? I would love to punch him again.”
Severus spurted a bit before responding. “I will have you know it is none of your business, Narcissa.” He blushed.
Lucius nodded and Draco continued. “I know you and Mother always wanted me to marry a pure blood witch and have children. That has always been the plan. It was not until a few years ago that I realised that it was not something I wanted. I never said anything about it, fearing that I would disappoint you and Mother. I had been at war with myself for years and suppressed my true wants from showing. It was not until after the war and the trials that I was finally free. I did not have to abide to the plans and I could be myself. Father, what I am trying to say is that I am gay and I am dating Harry. I thought it would be prudent tell you before you heard the news from someone else.” He could not look at his father for a moment.
Severus smirked. "I remember Albus was always irritated that he needed a replacement for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post each year. Such fond memories." He heard chuckling behind him and saw Albus' portrait laughing.
Draco smiled shyly. “Thank you for being so kind to me considering all the bad blood between our families. I hope to change that.”
Harry watched as Draco disappeared through the gate. He apparated back to Muggle London. As he approached his street, he noticed the reporters had left much to his relief. He slipped into his house quickly and quietly. Once inside he prepared his dinner. He leisurely ate once it was ready. As he finished his meal, Hermione popped in.
Potter smirked. "Draco, do you have a problem with me calling you by your first name? I thought we were over childish antics." He took a huge bite out of his sandwich waiting for Malfoy's response.
Harry looked at Draco so lovingly. “Dray, I love you beyond words. I can’t wait to call you my husband someday. I can’t think of anyone else who I’d want to spend the rest of my days with.” He kissed Draco’s forehead softly.
Draco was about to say something but was interrupted by someone tumbling out of the floo. It was revealed to be Ron.
Narcissa noticed that her son entered the room. "Ah Draco darling. You finally graced us with your presence. Come sit." Her eyes were dancing with delight.
Harry smiled warmly at Hermione. "Thank you. You're a true friend. I'm sure Draco would be delighted to hear that you want to be friends with him. Draco said he'd owl me when he was able to get together."
Narcissa immediately knelt down and joined Harry and Draco on the floor. “I am so sorry, darling. I did not mean to upset you. I just do not think it was prudent to visit your father.” She squeezed her son’s hand.
Molly stepped forward and hugged them both tightly. “Welcome my dears! It is so lovely to see you. It was good of you to come for tea. And Draco welcome to the family!” She gave him a kiss on the cheek and gave him an extra hug.
Severus was in awe of the young witch and was at a loss of how to respond. "Well, umm, Hermione that is quite spot on. I do not ordinarily participate in such displays of affection but like I had said it was not unwelcome." He smirked at her.
Hermione looked like she was going to burst and finally piped in. "Minnie found a letter from Dumbledore for Draco. It contained instructions and an incantation to say. None of us knew what it was going to do. Draco and Minnie thought it prudent to involve me in saying the incantation to ensure there were no mistakes."
Harry nodded and pulled Draco as close to him as possible. Both fell asleep with only thoughts of love and happiness.
Harry gave her another quick hug. “Thank you for the tea. I will owl you about his decision. Goodbye, Narcissa.” He apparated as she said her goodbyes to him.
Harry snorted. "That's definitely something George and Ginny would come up with. They love to tease everyone. I really do hope I don't lose Ron. It would make things so awkward if he doesn't get his head out of his arse especially since I plan to bring Draco to the Burrow at some point to properly meet my family."
Harry looked at Kreacher. "Please make us all breakfast, Kreacher. Hermione, good morning. We'll explain everything once we're dressed. Go downstairs and we'll join you shortly." He smiled at her.
Hermione smirked. “Actually, I do have Polyjuice on hand because of Severus. He tinkered with the potion so you do not end up looking like another person who already existed. Now it just alters your features. You are still you but unrecognisable. For example, it changes your eye colour, your hair, your mouth, your voice and nose. Just enough changes to your face to make it a fairly good disguise. Oh and it will correct your eye sight too if you wear glasses. It is quite brilliant!” She handed Harry a small bottle.
Severus nodded. “I am sure Narcissa will be pleased.” He smiled slightly. “I must take my leave. If you need me I will be the library.” He nodded to both of them and walked away.
Both Draco and Harry got cleaned up so they were presentable to the Weasleys. Once ready, Harry intertwined their hands together as they stepped into the floo and shouted “the Burrow!”
Draco turned bright red when Harry kissed his cheek. "I enjoyed today as well. Thank you again for returning my wand. I really appreciate it. I have missed my first wand quite a bit. I will owl you about getting together again. Goodbye Harry." He stepped forward and hugged Harry tightly. As he released Harry, he started to kiss Harry's cheek but his ex-rival turned his head which caused him to kiss his lips. Harry softly kissed back. When they stepped back from each other, both boys were blushing.
Hermione pulled back. “Sev, I do not see how anyone would not fall in love with you once they got to know you. You may be one of the most prickly people I know but behind all your armour is a brilliant soul. You deserve all the happiness and love in the world and I am beyond delighted that I am the one who has the chance to love you. I am quite pleased that Dumbledore had enough sense to save you. No one deserves another chance more than you, Sev.” She smiled softly at him and continued. “After Ron I did not think I would find love again, not to mention I was not entirely ready either, but that all changed once I saw you materialise at Hogwarts. I just felt it in my bones that we were destined for one another.” She smiled shyly at him.
Hermione smiled brightly. “I like the sound of it too.” She thought for a moment. “The day I marry you will be one of my happiest and most memorable days ever in my life. Right up there with when I was accepted into Hogwarts and my first day at Hogwarts.”
Draco was so lost in thought that he did not notice Winky had arrived. "Master Draco, Mr. Harry Potter has arrived for tea. Shall I escort him into the sitting room?"
Draco looked at Harry. “You can move now. I need to feel you.” Harry started moving his finger in and out causing Draco to moan. “Mo-or-re, please.” Harry nodded and added his index finger. He continued to pump into Draco faster. Both were moaning so loudly. “Mo-or-re…” And Harry added his ring finger and hit Draco’s sweet spot every time he plunged back in causing him to shout Harry’s name.
Severus observed his godson. "You should not have to hide your relationship or cater to others' sensitivities but I do understand considering he is the Saviour of the Wizarding World you need to proceed with caution. It is a wise decision on both your parts. Your family is not in good standing in our world right now and the press may assume you are trying to redeem your family's name by spending time with their Saviour. Though, no one who matters will think that of you. Let us go inside."
Harry smiled back at her. "Of course, I am happy to help in whatever way you need as long as Draco agrees and feels comfortable with staying with me. I want what's best for him just as you and Snape do."
Ron scanned the room. “Bloody hell I’m surrounded by snakes! What gives Harry? I stop coming around and you replace me with Draco’s lot? Being friends with these snakes is betraying me and my family! Why the bloody fuck are they here?”
Draco sat on the garden bench wondering how tea time would go with Potter. Again, his nerves were getting the better of him. He always wanted to be friends with him if he could not have more.
Harry took the letter that was attached to the owl’s leg and opened it. He chuckled. “Looks like Hermione made good on her threat to tell Molly about Ron’s behaviour the other day. Molly would like us to come by for tea.” Errol was still staring at Harry.
As Draco chatted with Snape, Minnie was seated at her desk when she noticed an envelope with "Mister Draco Malfoy" written in Dumbledore's handwriting. She looked at it curiously. Harry noticed that she was staring at something.
Hermione stared at Severus in shock. She suddenly stood up and walked to where Severus was sitting. She sat on his lap. “You really mean that?” She looked at him.
Remus sighed. “Siri love, you do realise that you have been dead for quite some time. And I do not see Voldemort here and this place feels lighter and the decor has changed. It has a woman’s touch. Narcissa’s I presume.”
Narcissa huffed out a chuckle. "Draco, stop being overdramatic. It will be fine whether there is an article or not. Remember, Harry does not care what the press think of him. He has never cared all that much. I am sure that line of thinking still stands. He cares for you deeply and he would never allow anyone, especially the press, influence him otherwise. Just go to him and forget the potential consequences. I am sure it would be a happy surprise to see you again."
Hermione kissed his cheek softly. “Yes I do Severus. And I am certainly not the only one who believes that either. Harry defended you despite your history with him, Dumbledore gave you another chance at life, Draco loves you like a father, Minerva respects the bloody hell out of you, Narcissa trusts you with her son’s life and I fell head over heels in love with you. You need to start believing in what others see in you. It saddens me that you do not. I think about how you grew up, what you endured in school and who you associated with and I look at what you have become and I can not think of a better person to come home to every night for the rest of my life. It makes me love you even more.” She kissed him gently.
Ron looked a bit peaky to say the least at Harry’s words and solemnly nodded. It seemed he could not find the words to say to his friend. Harry nodded back curtly.
Severus sneered at Harry. "Potter, may I ask why you and my godson were in the same bed? Though, I am pleased you took my advice but I do not support you two jumping into bed together so soon after getting together."
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and leaned forward until their noses touched. He tentatively began to kiss Harry. Slowly their kiss grew passionate as they were moaning and explored each other. As breathing became an issue, they pulled back panting. Both looked at one another with love in their eyes. Draco nuzzled Harry’s neck and sighed contentedly.
Draco stepped forward and Hermione launched herself at him and hugged him. "Draco, welcome to the family!" She pulled away and smiled at him. "I will be seeing you both soon!" She disappeared into the floo.
Draco smirked. “Potter, speechless. That is something do not witness every day.” Harry whacked him in arm. “Harry, I love you too. More every day as well.” He kissed Harry softly. They cuddled even closer to each other.
Severus caressed her cheek. “Hermione, you never cease to amaze me in every way possible. How do you do that?”
She walked up to him and once she was right in front of him, she got on her tippy toes and placed a soft kiss on his cheek. Before apparating away, Hermione smirked and waved goodbye to a very speechless Severus.
Harry slid closer to Draco and gently entwined their hands together. "Draco, another reason why I wasn't so upset about Ginny liking someone else was because I also had a thing for someone else. And that someone was actually you. When you invited me for tea I got really nervous and wasn't sure if I could come and spend time with you. I haven't told anyone about who I'm interested in and my friends won't be so thrilled about who it is. But I thought we could be friends and see where it goes from there. That way each of our friends could get used to us being around each other. I really hope you understand what I'm trying to say to you." He looked a bit panicky.
Harry stood in front of Hermione. "Thank you for coming by and having breakfast with us. I am so lucky to have in my life. I don't know what I would do without you." He hugged her tightly.
Hermione looked curiously at Severus. “Whatever it is you can tell me, Sev.” She placed her delicate hand on top of his and gently squeezed.
Once again, Draco blushed and grumbled under his breath. "Seriously Mother quit teasing me over this. I will take your advice and see him as soon as I am presentable."
Narcissa took a few bites of breakfast. "My darling, are you looking forward to seeing Mr. Potter?" She smirked exactly like she did last night.
Hermione walked into the kitchen. "So how did the 'proper goodbye' go? Tell me everything." She teased.
Harry looked at Draco and smiled. "Hermione would be perfect to recite those words. You remember how important pronunciation is to her, right? She used to lecture Ron and I all the bloody time about how we could potentially get killed if we said something wrong."
Once both prepared their tea, they waited for it to cool. "So, Draco what did you want to say to me that you were unable to say in a letter? Was it that complex?" Harry teased.
Harry squeezed Draco's hand and boldly gave him a short kiss on his lips. He pulled back. "Draco, let me know when you would like to get together again. Welcome back, Professor Snape. It was good seeing you again, Minnie. I'll keep in touch about coming back. Let's go, Hermione." He hugged Minnie and waved goodbye to Severus. Hermione hugged Minnie and Draco while saying goodbye and smiled warmly at Severus. Harry took her and they disappeared into the floo.
When the morning light shone through the bedroom window, Draco started to stir. Once he was awake, he realised that there was something warm pressed up against his back. At first, he was startled but remembered what happened last night. He smiled because he was Harry's boyfriend.
Once he was alone again, Harry headed upstairs to get ready for bed. Again, his thoughts drifted to Draco. He really couldn't wait to see him again. Every time he saw him, his heart fluttered. Harry wasn't able to refrain from thinking of their second kiss. It was longer and more passionate than the first.
Draco had a tear running down his cheek. Harry kissed it away. “Harry, you reached out to my friends? I really do not know what to say. I am so bloody luck to have you in my life. I love you so much, Potter.” He kissed Harry softly.
Harry huffed out a chuckle. “This surprise is worth it.” He gets off the bed and literally drags Draco out of bed. “You are coming with me whether you like it or not.”
Draco finished his lunch and called for Winky. He told her to find his best casual Muggle clothing. Once he made his way up the stair to his bedroom, he showered and got dressed. Winky had left him black skinny jeans with a dark green t-shirt. A perfect Malfoy outfit that was appropriate for the Muggle world. He looked in the mirror to make sure he looked flawless for his Harry. He approved of his appearance and left his bedroom and made his way down the stairs.
Lily gave James a scathing look. “If you were in Hell, why would you have your best friends and wife with you? Unless it is hell having your family around you which is deeply disturbing to think about! Ugh, sometimes I wonder what I saw in you in moments like these!” She huffed.
Harry yawned and Narcissa noticed. “It has been a tiring day. You should head home, Harry darling. We could all use a good rest.”
James bit his lip and sighed. “I don’t want to be compared to the likes of Lucius. He’s a horrid human. Narcissa, Draco I’m sorry for my outburst. I hope you can forgive me for my momentary lapse in judgement. Draco, you seem to be a far better person than your father is and Narcissa I’m glad you came to your senses and thank you for helping my son. And Snape I never apologised for all the years of torment I caused you during our Hogwarts days so I’m sorry. It wasn’t right of me to ever be that cruel to you. We were stupid kids back then but that’s still no excuse. As far as Harry, I have to thank you for keeping him safe. I’m always letting my anger and prejudice cloud my decisions and judgement.”
Hermione stopped at her bedroom doorway. “Well, this is my sanctuary. It is not very big since most of it is filled with books.” Severus stepped forward and looked inside her bedroom. In the middle of the room sat a queen sized bed. Bookshelves filled to the brim lined the walls from floor to ceiling. There were books stacked up on the floor as well. The whole room screamed Hermione Granger.
Draco watched their interaction and was pleased that his mother and Harry got along well. His father wouldn't approve of how friendly he was with the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
Draco bumped Harry in the shoulder playfully. "I am relieved that the war is over and the good guys won as well. I am sorry you lost your pet. I am sure you will know when you are ready for your next pet. Actually, I wish I had the ability to talk to snakes."
Harry pulled away. “I love you too Draco.” He leaned towards the bedside table to get his wand and that is when Draco stopped him. Harry looked at him confused.
Severus watched with curiosity as he held Hermione’s hand. “I am not at all surprised by Mr. Weasley’s shrewdness. He was never one to hold his tongue when necessary.” He sneered at Ron.
Harry grabbed a fist full of Draco’s hair in one hand and pulled him into another searing kiss. He started to caress Draco everywhere. They shifted a bit and both gasped as their erections touched. Harry slowly removed Draco’s trousers and pants and then his own. When they were both starkers, Harry could not stop staring at Draco’s body.
Pansy huffed out a sigh. “I am deeply sorry this afternoon did not go as planned. Though I did enjoy Hermione punching Weasel. Definitely a highlight. I do hope you feel better my darling Draco! I am so incredibly happy for you and Harry.” She hugged them both.
Draco glared at his mother. "Mother, I do not know what to do. I know I should write to Harry but every time I start a letter it comes out wrong and then I just can't think of anything to say."
Severus was shocked by how candid Hermione was being around him. "You and Lily may be the only exceptions in regards to muggleborns. You both shine like stars in the night's sky." He looked quite embarrassed by what he just said but still he continued. "Ahh very well, we will have continue our banter as you call it another time. It would be quite a delight to have you over for tea some time and it would be lovely to get know you more as well. Well, let me walk you to the gate."
As soon as they were out of Narcissa's sight, they entwined their hands once again. Draco opened the front door and walked down the stairs with Harry trailing behind. When they reached the gate where Harry could apparate back to the Weasleys, they looked at each other.
Harry sheepishly looked at Draco. “Your mother went to visit your father yesterday. He was still spouting hate even after our visit. She is forbidding you from ever visiting him again and I agreed with her. He is too toxic for us all. She also petitioned for divorce and the courts granted it. She changed her last name back to Black. Also, you have a choice whether you want to keep the name Malfoy or change it to her maiden name. All your father’s money is going to you despite him trying to cut you off. Your mother and I joked that you should give it muggleborn charities. We also had tea together.” He looked at Draco nervously.
Narcissa nodded. "Severus, if you have a chance at true happiness, do not disregard the possibility of it happening no matter who it may be. Life is too short as you know all too well." She walked away leaving him with his thoughts.
Hermione was practically tomato red. "Thank you for being so good-natured about my behaviour. And it is not every day you are hugged back by the half-blood prince." She teased back which earned her a blush from Severus.
Severus stared into Hermione’s eyes. “Uhh, I, Hermione. What do you mean by the way you feel about me?” He looked at her curiously.
Hermione nodded. "I know they will be fine. I just worry because I am not there with them. Whenever Ron and Harry did anything without me they would some how mess everything up or nearly get caught. We joke about me being the brains in the friend group but I really am most of the time. I should be comforted in the fact that Harry is with Draco who is just as intelligent as I am. Gosh, I am making myself sound so superior to my friends." She chuckled to herself and blushed.
Blaise chuckled a bit. “I think that is as good as it will get for you, Potter. I am sure once she gets her head out of her arse and actually gets to know you she will like you. I mean Draco loves you so you can not be all bad now, can you?” He genuinely smiled at Harry.
Draco gulped and eyed the front door. "Our floo was disconnected after the war. The only way I can leave is by going out the door unfortunately. I knew this was going to happen. I do not want you to get into trouble with the press because of me. It was silly of me to come here and put you in danger." Draco was panicking.
Kreacher’s eyes bulged a bit and nodded. “Oh yes Master Harry! Kreacher would be pleased to do that for you.” He popped out again.
Harry shook his head. “Today has been absolutely barmy! Dray, I am sorry my plan to cheer you up didn’t go the way it was supposed to.” He looked at Draco sadly.
Hermione smirked. “Sev, breathe. I would not have agreed to living with you if I did not want that. It was a brilliant idea. Me and my books will be very content at Spinner’s End with you. Stop worrying so much. I love you and you love me. That is all that truly matters.”
Draco looked at Harry intently. “I am sure they get their heads out of their arses for your sake. And if they do not, we can have Molly sort them out. She is a very scary person when you get on her bad side. I know she would be happy to help you if there is an issue.” He smiled at Harry.
Draco finally swallowed his nerves. “Father, you have no right to insult me or Harry! I am so tired of having to explain myself to simple minded bigots like yourself. Mother and Severus are proud of me and still love me for who I truly am. If you can not get over your prejudice, then I do not have a problem losing you or being disinherited by you. It would be a relief to be fully free of the tarnished Malfoy legacy.” He looked at his father defiantly.
As luck would have it, Severus’ thoughts of Hermione were interrupted by Potter who had just arrived at the Manor as he, himself, was leaving. Of course, Potter had to speak to him and it was about some nonsense regarding bridging the gap between houses and blood statuses. All he wanted to do was leave so he could see Hermione and thankfully he got his wish when Narcissa interrupted their conversation. Though, she made a comment to Potter about his date with Hermione which embarrassed him but that gave him to the opportunity to escape since he would be late otherwise if he did not leave immediately.
Hermione nervously stammered. "Gosh, um-m, I am really sorry. I did not mean to be so forward with my thanks. Once again, I feel embarrassed by my behaviour. Though, I am delighted to know you do not mind me calling you Sev." She gave him a shy smile.
Harry came back down and once again sat next to Draco. “Dray, want to cuddle a bit before dinner is ready?”
Draco rolled over after feeling movement on the bed and opened his eyes to his Harry swatting a freakishly odd owl. “Bloody hell, Potter! Why is there an owl in our bed?” He glared at the owl for disturbing his sleep.
Draco sighed loudly. "I do not even know how he would react if I sent him an owl. What if he informs the Ministry that I am harassing him?"
Once Winky cleared the table, Severus proceeded to leave the room. “Narcissa, I will be in my potions laboratory if you need me.” He walked out of the room.
Draco rolled off the bed. "Harry, I am going to get dressed. I will see you in the kitchen." He was smiling like a loon.
Blaise looked at Pansy. “I believe that is our queue to leave as well. Potter, thank you for such an eventful afternoon.” He smiled.
Lily walked over to her son and hugged him. She pulled back a bit. “Ohh Harry dear, I am so proud of you and the man you have become despite the challenges you have faced. I have always just wanted to be happy and at peace. I can tell that Draco anchors you, much like how I anchor James.” She smirked. “Nothing is more important to me than seeing you in love and smiling like a loon because of your Draco.” She walked over to Draco. “Thank you for loving my son and making him happy. You both deserve to be happy.” She surprised Draco by pulling him into a hug. At first, Draco did not hug back but slowly he put his arms around Lily. After a few moments, Lily pulled back and smiled at him.
Draco pulled away and walked back to where Harry was. Hermione could not stop staring at Severus like he could disappear again at any moment. Harry was stunned into silence. Minnie smirked fondly at Severus.
Draco looked Harry in the eye. “Love, I’m so sorry how he reacted. You didn’t deserve that kind of treatment. You are so deserving of love and happiness! And I will always remind you of that every day when you are feeling blue.” He kissed Draco’s forehead and then gave him a sweet kiss on the lips. “Come on, let’s go home, Dray.” He took hold of Draco’s hand and apparated back to Grimmauld Place.
Harry stared at Draco in wonder. "Actually I'd love to come by for a seekers game. It would be nice to make more pleasant memories here. The piano? How am I not surprised you play. Would you ever play for me? I always liked the sound of the piano. I have to agree that it's peaceful." He said hopefully.
Harry cast a spell so Lucius was not able to talk. “Mister Malfoy, that is enough beastly behaviour from you! You will not speak to your son in such a dreadful way. There was a reason I spoke so ill of you at your trial and I do not regret what I did for your family. I knew that if Draco and Narcissa did not have you around, they would thrive because they are actually good people without being controlled by a lunatic follower of Voldemort. After Draco did not identify me at the manor and Narcissa lied for me to Voldemort in the forest, I believed in them and I thought they deserved to live their lives free of your influence. I reconciled with your son and we became close and now we are dating. Narcissa has been supportive and just wants Draco to be happy. And if you do not want to lose your son completely I suggest you think about how you feel about his happiness. He has been through enough, don’t you think? Does he not deserve to be happy and free?” He released the spell and gave Lucius a sneer. Lucius recoiled a bit.
Harry chuckled at what he said. "Your mother is a wise woman. I'm glad you got the courage to visit. You're always welcome here any time. I really enjoy your company."
Harry shook his head as he chuckled and wrote a quick reply. Once he was done he attached the letter to Errol’s leg and the owl flew off in zig zags.
Harry blushed furiously. "I thought we could hug and possibly repeat what happened a few days ago. But only if you're comfortable with doing so."
Hermione swatted at him playfully. “And I love that I am the only one to reap all of the benefits of your softer side. I would not want to share you. You are all mine, Severus Snape.” She smirked.
Severus nodded. “I do. The moment I laid eyes on you upon my return, I felt a strong pull towards you. It was like nothing I ever felt before. It was like we were connected in some way, that we were meant for each other.”
Hermione nodded. "Indeed a lot has changed since first year. You can tell me if you do not mind sharing." She gave him a small smile of encouragement.
Severus blushed and looked so embarrassed. "I do not realise that Harry did that for me. Thank you for letting me know. Um, I forgot to ask, what brought you to the manor?"
After the exciting turn of events at Hogwarts, Draco was exhausted and decided to settle into bed. His thoughts were of Severus and Harry. He never thought he would ever see his godfather again. He felt awful because of how he treated Dumbledore before he died. It was incredibly thoughtful of Dumbledore to find a way to bring Severus back. He was beyond grateful. His thoughts started to drift as sleep took over.
Once they walked out the door and out of the protective barrier, they apparated back to Grimmauld Place. They landed in the sitting room and dropped like rocks into the nearest seat. Both sighed in relief that tea at the Weaseley’s was over.
Harry looked Ron. “I’ve never been more sure of something than Draco. So will you go?” He looked at floor nervously.
Sitting in the box was Draco's wand that Potter stole during his ill fated visit to the Manor. "Potter, you really did not have to return my wand. Besides, its allegiance is to you now. I am sure you did not think about that little important fact."
Harry felt Draco flinch at Ron’s words and held his hand tightly. “No, Weasel, it’s not a joke. I can be friends with whoever I choose. You’re not my keeper. And there’s no reason to be so fucking crude! You can be such an arsehole, Weasel! It makes me question why I’m trying to stay friends with you. First, Lucius lashes out at Draco. Second, Pansy attacks me but she and I are okay now. And now you’re attacking me in my own home and questioning my decisions. No we’re not fucking as you said so eloquently and no Draco didn’t dose me with a love potion. I thought I could trust you to be there for me. I thought you wanted me to be happy. But here you are just being your fourth year self again! Betray you? How dare you use your family against me! Let them make their own decisions! It’s not up to you, thank Merlin!” He snarled at Ron. He held Draco close to him.
As Draco and Hermione chattered a bit, Harry decided to see what Hermione was going on about. He got up and went to his front door. He gasped in surprise, every reporter from nearly every paper was there on the pavement. He blinked hoping he was hallucinating but sadly they were real. He knew what this meant. Someone from the wizarding world told the press that they had seen Draco Malfoy enter his home.
Hermione searched for the perfect words to say. "Severus, I believe the reason for your resurrection was that you meant a great deal to Draco. I think Dumbledore knew that his father was not going to escape Azkaban and he would need someone to help his mother out. Plus I think our world needed you too. You played an important role and Dumbledore thought after what you did, you should be rewarded and reunited with your family. The remaining Malfoys. No one deserves a second chance more than you do, Sev. I truly believe that." She blushed because she called him by a nickname.
"Mother, why did you have to embarrass me even more? Can you not see I am already suffering?" Draco angrily said. He felt like he was going to cry but he had to calm himself. He already allowed Potter to see him vulnerable in sixth year. He could not allow it again.
She shook her head. "No, just this peculiar letter appeared on my desk after you and Draco arrived. It is in Dumbledore's handwriting. It is for Draco."
Draco sighed. "I suppose now that we are officially together, we should inform Mother, Severus and eventually Father." He snuggled even closer to Harry.
"I'll be sure to do that the next time I see Andromeda. Enjoy the rest of your day as well." He waved back and followed Draco to the front door.
Harry stepped closer to Draco and kissed his cheek. "I truly did enjoy today. Thanks again. You're pretty amazing once given a chance. Hope to see you soon."
Harry walks into the kitchen and makes dinner for himself. He thought back on the day he had. It had been quite eventful. He was absolutely exhausted but extremely happy. As he finished his dinner, all he could think about was his day with Draco and his talk with Hermione. Two of his favourite people in the world.
What seemed like seconds later, Hermione emerged from the floo and dusted herself off. "Harry, what did you get yourself into this time? I swear I feel like I am always saving the day." She gave Harry a pointed look and acknowledged her surroundings. "Oh forgive my manners. Hello Minnie and hello Draco. It is very nice to see you both again." She smiled at them.
Hermione blushed. “Sev, are you asking me to live with you?” She teased. “I mean I am sure my books would appreciate the change of venue.” She smirked. “And I would not mind it either.”
Suddenly, he was being nudged and someone was calling his name. He did not understand what was happening. As he slowly woke up, he realised his mother and Severus were hovering over him with a look of worry upon their faces.
They held onto each other tightly. As the kiss deepened, Harry and Draco were pressed up again each other once again. Both were moaning softly and continued to kiss incredibly passionately until each were desperate to breath. They slowly pulled away from each other panting heavily.
Severus sputtered to answer at first. “You really are a cheeky one, Miss Granger.” He chuckled lightly and nervously bit his lip. “Well, um, I do not want you to think we are moving too swiftly but I suppose I am asking you to live with me at Spinner’s End.”
Draco mulled over his words. “I want to experience it the Muggle way. No magic. Just us. Please.” Harry then opened the draw and got lube. He was about to reach for a condom but Draco shook his head. Harry smiled lovingly at Draco and nodded.
Harry sighed sadly. “I’m so lucky to have you all here. I couldn’t ask for a better crowd of friends. Who would’ve thought I’d be exchanging a Gryffindor for two Slytherins. The sorting hat was right. Slytherin is where you make your real friends. All because of Draco’s behaviour and what Hagrid said to me about Slytherin I basically begged the sorting hat not to put me in Slytherin. In these moments I regret that I was so close-minded about the house of the snake. But at the same time I wouldn’t trade my friendship with Hermione for anything. I don’t think we would’ve been as close if I had been placed into Slytherin. No offence.” He chuckled and smiled at Hermione.
Hermione was startled by such a kind gesture from Severus and looked at him curiously. "Why are you being so nice to me? Not to be rude but you have never been one to be kind especially someone like me."
Minnie had heard enough. "Severus, there is no need to be so beastly towards your godson and former students. Though, you do bring up an excellent point." She looked at him sternly. He nodded and finally stopped sneering at Harry, Draco and Hermione. "Your old posts as Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts professor are still open if you are interested in rejoining Hogwarts. It is up to you." She said desperately trying to change the subject.
Hermione handed another bottle to Ron and she drank half of a bottle herself. “I thought we should all take it because we could all be recognised. And yes I have a bunch of bottles in my purse just in case I do not want to be bombarded by all our fans.” She chuckled.
Both chuckled at the house elf. "I had better get inside before mother herself comes out here. I had a lovely time with you once again, Potter." He smirked.
When Draco and Harry arrived back, they were greeted by Severus and Narcissa looking quite livid. Narcissa broke her silence. “What were you two thinking? Are you both mad? What on earth possessed you to visit my vile husband?”
Sirius put his arm around Remus. “I certainly would not mind getting to know Draco and reconnecting with Narcissa without Lucius’ influence.” He smiled at Narcissa and Draco. “For Harry’s sake, I think we should all try to get along. There has been enough pain and heartache. We all need to get over ourselves.” Everyone looked surprised at what he said.
After Narcissa left, she went up to the Malfoy secret library where they kept the family’s blood magic books. When she had heard how sad Harry was, she thought of something that she had long forgotten about. There was a spell that could bring back loved ones. She grabbed the book that had the spell. Narcissa flipped through the pages and finally found the the perfect spell. She looked over the words.
Draco mulled over what to say. “I do not think one word covers how I feel. Incredible, loved, content and many more words and emotions. Never in my wildest dreams, I thought this sort of thing would happen for someone like me.” He caressed Harry’s cheek. “How about you, love?”
Kreacher woke them telling them they were needed at the Manor. And they straightened themselves out. Holding hands they apparated to the manor.
Severus stood up first and offered his hand to Hermione. Without hesitation, she took hold of his hand and he pulled her towards him. For a moment, time stood still as they stared into each other's eyes. As soon as they realised what they were doing, both looked away from one another embarrassed.
Hermione quickly grabbed his hand ensuring that he would not leave and had tears in her eyes. “Stop, Sev. You are not a Death Eater. Maybe long ago but not now. I trust you with my life and my heart. You are none of those negative things that I know are swirling in your head right now. What I said was true, you have a brilliant soul despite your prickliness. And when you initially joined Voldemort, you did it because you wanted a sense of belonging and you were hurt because of Lily. There is no shame in that. We all do foolish things when we get hurt or do not feel like you have anyone to turn to. You made a mistake, granted a ginormous one yes but you made up for it tenfold because of your love for Lily. You saved our world by keeping Lily’s son safe nearly every year at Hogwarts despite the possibility of being caught. An evil man does not do that. An evil man does not risk his own life by being a double agent with his loyalties on the side of good. An evil man does not feel love in his heart. An evil man does not do the right thing. An evil man does not worry about the safety of those around him. A good man would watch over the child of the one who got away long ago. A good man would sacrifice his own safety for the greater good. A good man would fall in love. A good man would always do the right thing in the end. A good man would be vigilant of how important the safety of those around him are.” She stressed every word she said. “Those are all the reasons why I believe you are the truest kind of hero and one of the bravest men, Severus.” She caressed his cheek and smiled at him softly.
James stepped forward. “Bloody hell! You’ve grown so much!” He saw the ring on his left hand. “And you’re engaged!” He looked over at Draco. “A Potter marrying a Malfoy? I feel like I’m in an episode of the Twilight Zone.” Everyone chuckled aside from Draco. “So Harry care to explain what’s happening?”
Narcissa stroked Draco's hair. "Darling, I am not alone. Severus is here and you can always visit. I just think you need a break. You need to heal from what you have experienced and I think being away would do you a world of good." She kissed the top of his head.
Harry pulled Hermione into a hug. "Thank you! It's a relief to have your support. And of course I want you to be happy too. I hope you find it someday. You certainly deserve it after having to deal with me and Ron." He chuckled.
Hermione watched Harry as he blushed and smiled. "Harry, you can tell us anything. We just want you to be happy."
Harry faced Draco and kissed him softly. “I missed you too, Dray. How did your visit go with your mother and Severus?”
Eventually, he got ready for bed. After he turned his lamp off, his last thoughts were of Draco and his lips and their kiss. He fell asleep with a small smile on his face.
Once Harry and Draco were ready, they walked to the floo and said “Malfoy Manor”.  Of course as they landed, Harry stumbled like every other time nearly taking Draco with him.
Severus interrupted. “What is done is done. There is no turning back. All that matters is how we act now. A lot has changed. Old friends lost, new friends found.” He smiled fondly at all his former students.
James looked down at the floor, embarrassed. Lily smiled at both Hermione and Severus. “You always did like them feisty, Severus.” She teased. “The past is just that, the past and that is where it should stay. It would do you some good, James, to actually grow up. If our son can put aside his differences so can you. We have a chance to spend time with our son and that is what should matter. And it sounds to me that Draco and Narcissa were in a tight spot and were just surviving the second war. Both saved our son and his friends so I think we should give them a chance.” She smiled at Draco and Narcissa.
Draco's eyes widened at the nickname. "Dray? Honestly I have been better. I really do appreciate your concern and hospitality. Tea sounds lovely."
Draco smiled. “We already know Harry can barely stick the landings when it comes to the floo. And thank you, Sev. It happened just a few hours ago and I wanted to inform Mother.”
As Draco finished his breakfast, he tried his best to calm his nerves. Of course it was a fruitless activity especially when flashes of his dreams kept plaguing his mind. He remembered how he felt when Potter kissed him in his dream. It made his cheeks flush thinking about how he wanted Harry to kiss him in reality.
Hermione smirked and chuckled. “I think I was clear about my feelings. Well, at least, my actions should have been quite obvious but clearly they were not. I have held your hand, hugged you, bantered with you and kissed your cheek. I would have actually kissed you, I mean really kissed you, but I was not sure about how you would react. I did not want to humiliate myself so I just decided to give you a kiss on the cheek.” She was blushing ferociously.
Later that same day, Harry and Draco approached the gates of Hogwarts for the first time since the war hand in hand, both were nervous to be back. Harry was anxious to hear more about his parents and Draco was anxious to step foot in a place where he had betrayed so many. Headmistress McGonagall was at the gate to greet them.
Lily smiled softly at Severus. “None taken, Severus. I can not imagine what you are feeling right now but I think I want to make peace with the past. We all did something wrong back then but we have a second chance and I think we should take advantage of that.” She looked at him hopefully. “Only if you want to, that is.”
Severus patiently listened to her. "I am glad to know you have more confidence and trust in my godson's abilities than Weasley's. That is quite understandable that you needed time to heal. I assume you did find your parents and were successful in restoring their memories. Hermione, I believe you are too good for someone like Weasley and I am pleased to know you were able to gently free yourself from that relationship. No one really got their feelings hurt. And you two were able to stay friends. That is the best possible outcome." He gave her a sweet smile.
Harry chuckled softly. “I think wow is an understatement. I love you too, Dray.” He shuffled them up to the top of the bed.
Severus rolled his eyes at Harry’s rant. “Potter, you are like your father in many ways but it seems that you have learned from his mistakes. You are a seemingly better version of what he was. You saying that you could be the person who could bridge that gap is very Gryffindor of you. Though if anyone could do it, it would be you. I am pleased that you have made friends with some Slytherins. They make brilliant and cunning friends and that can always be useful. You making my godson happy and in love is quite nauseating but I am thankful. Draco deserves to be happy. As for you and I am pleased that we have worked out most of our issues. I will not argue that we are all just people because that is quite true but it is the long standing traditions of our world that caused the gap in the first place. I am not sure if there will ever be a time when blood status will not matter and what house you are sorted into will not matter. It is a lovely kind of thing to think about though. I do hope it happens. Between you, Draco and Hermione I am sure you will think of something.”
Draco smiled so widely at Harry. "Sometimes you can be such an oblivious idiot you know that?! I keep forgetting that you can be so barmy at times but then you always remind me by something you say. I can not wait until we can show our friends that we are a couple. Imagine Pansy's face when we tell her. That is something we need to film for sure. Blaise, I know, will be ecstatic for us and it seems Hermione will be too. I can not imagine Weasel is going to be pleased considering how he reacted to our friendship. I think I might have had a mini heart attack because I just realised that I also need to inform my father of our relationship at some point and it will have to be in person unfortunately. As you know my mother will be over the moon and sharing it with everyone she knows. And I will have to agree with you that Pansy can be quite terrifying so I do not blame you for being a bit anxious around her."
Draco deepened the kiss a bit and slowly pulled away. “Anything for you. I love you too, Harry.” He kissed his forehead. “Love, you want to take a rest?”
Harry spoke up after a few moments. "Hermione thought I should ask the school portraits and you about my parents and what they were like since I'm interested in knowing more about them. And Draco would like to speak with Professor Snape if it's not too inconvenient for you, Minnie." He smiled warmly at her, to which she nodded at.
Hermione smiled sweetly at him. “Oh Sev, we all know that Ron would have held me back from my fullest potential. No matter what somewhere down the line, Ron and I would have imploded. It is just a simple fact. You, on the other hand, would always challenge me in every way possible. I just know it. Speaking of challenging me, I have a brilliant idea.” Severus looked at suspiciously and Hermione smirked. “I think you should take me to bed, Sev.” She blushed ferociously and stood up. Tea time forgotten, she pulled Severus up and pulled him toward the stairs. Once they were on the second floor, Hermione gestured Severus to follow her and he did.
Once Severus was alone with his thoughts, he smiled because of what had happened with Hermione. He could not wait to see his young witch again. He laid on his bed and stared up at the ceiling waiting for Winky to tell him that dinner was ready. When he closed his eyes, all he saw was the day’s events unfolding in his mind. Severus could not think of anything else but Hermione and the feel of her lips on his. He softly moaned to himself thinking of how his body reacted to hers and he could not wait for their next encounter.
Narcissa smirked. "See Severus, nothing to worry about despite what Hermione may have interrupted. A reasonable explanation. Thank you, Harry, for taking great care of my son. It warms my heart to know he is such capable hands."
Harry smiled softly at the house elf. “Could you set up two extra bedrooms? Narcissa resurrected my parents, Sirius and Remus and they’re staying here.”
Harry chuckled. “Dray, I swear if I didn’t know any better I’d think you were a cat.” Draco laughed. “But yes I’ll join you. Anywhere you go, I go.” He kissed Draco ghostly soft and stood up. He helped Draco up and pulled him out of the room and up the stairs into their bedroom. After removing their clothes aside from their shirts and underwear.
Harry eventually pulled away. “Dray, there’s something I’d like to tell you. Don’t worry it’s nothing bad but it’s definitely important. Will you please look at me, love?”
Harry leaned into Draco’s touch. “You’re right. There’s no one word to describe how I feel right now.” He smiled softly. “Dray, you deserve everything good in the world.” He leaned in and kissed Draco’s forehead. “I believe it with every fibre of my being.” He then kissed the tip of Draco’s nose, causing both to chuckle.
Draco stared at Harry. “I did not know you spoke at my father’s trial. I always wondered why my mother and I were spared but my father was not. It was your words that kept him from freedom. I appreciate your faith in us and thank you for providing true freedom.” He grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed it while he kissed him on the cheek. All the while, Lucius still looked disgusted with the display but did not say anything. The guard was smirking the whole time.
Winky was smiling while she continued to jump on his bed. She was yelling "HARRY POTTER IS COMING TODAY! HARRY POTTER IS COMING TODAY! HARRY POTTER IS COMING TODAY!"
Ron laughed. “Joke’s on her I suppose. I’ve already made too many mistakes with our friendship. I let my prejudice get in the way. I’m no better than Lucius if I can’t let go of the past. If the ferret makes you happy I suppose I can deal with him being around for the long haul. Bloody hell Harry you’re getting engaged!” He grinned.
Hermione walked over to Harry and hugged him. “It is going to be okay, Harry. It is devastating to lose a friend especially to bigotry.”
Blaise cleared his throat. “This is sickeningly sweet and I am delighted to see our Draco actually fucking happy but I think the purpose of our visit was to cheer him up and not be privy to your bedroom life.” He chuckled softly.
The salesperson nodded and smiled back. “You’re very welcome, sir. And congratulations to you and your soon-to-be fiancé.” She wrapped the rings up and handed them over.
Draco placed his hands on Harry's cheeks as they continued to kiss. Harry put his arm around Draco and deepened the kiss. By the time they ended the kiss, both were out of breath and were pressed up against each other. They were blushing ferociously and stared at one another. Draco could not resist and pulled Harry into another breathlessly searing kiss. Each moaning into the other's mouth. Neither could get enough of the other.
Harry began softly tracing the scars on Draco’s chest. He noticed how his breathing became more erratic as he continued. Harry smirked at Draco’s reaction. He followed one of the scars with his finger and it ended right at the top of his trousers which earned him a low moan and shiver from Draco. He carried on caressing along the trouser line. Draco started to buck his hips a bit and moaned even louder.
Harry blushed even deeper. “Male. He prefers silver or white gold. Green is his favourite colour and he likes snakes.” He fidgeted.
It was Harry's turn to blush ferociously. "Umm, I, uhhh, hmm, really didn't realise I had such an effect on you. I'm astonished that anyone would feel that way about me. Ugh, I wish we didn't have to wait to be more than friends. It's, uh, almost painful not be close to you. I can't believe just admitted that and I should learn to think before I speak. Now, I feel the need to hide and never be seen again. I really need to talk about something. Hermione will definitely be pleased that you'd like to get to know her and find her brilliant. As for Ron, I know he and his family aren't your favourite people in the world but thank you for hoping he has a change of heart. Though I'm not so optimistic but Hermione has said she'll talk to Molly about his behaviour. I guess we'll see what happens after Molly speaks with him. He hasn't always been the most loyal or there for me kind of friend but I'm so thankful I have Hermione's friendship. She's literally my rock. She truly is my best friend. And then there's you. Someone I've never imagined I could get along with. It was an instant connection. Of course there's still some teasing and the snark but truthfully I wouldn't want it any other way. I think, uhh, you're quite brilliant and lovely to be around. I never thought I'd say that about you but I have the tendency to judge before knowing someone and I am sorry about that. We were both foolish children back in first year. I'm happy to know we've moved on from our foolishness. As for your friends, I'm truly looking forward to getting to know Blaise but I'm slightly terrified of Pansy if I'm being honest. Our last encounter wasn't exactly awe inspiring as you recall." He chuckled a bit.
Sirius nodded. “That would be lovely. I could use a rest. How about you, Remy? Have a lay down with me?” He affectionately smiled at Remus.
Harry smiled back at her. "Thank you for having me this afternoon. It's been surprisingly a lot of fun. I do plan to visit again. Draco and I plan to have a seekers game at some point."
Blaise rolled his eyes. “What Pansy means is thank you for contacting us about Draco. We really appreciate it. It was quite thoughtful of you especially since it would involve spending time with former enemies.” He smiled at Harry and held out his hand. Surprisingly, Harry did not hesitate and shook Blaise’s hand and smiled back at him.
Sirius was the first to speak. “What in the bloody hell is going on? What is the meaning of this? Get away from my godson you Death Eater scum!” He looked furious.
James huffed. “Bloody hell! Why the fuck am I in Malfoy Manor of all places? Am I in Hell or something?” He continued to curse under his breath.
Severus flinched a bit. "A great many things have changed since I first met you, Hermione. If you will let me, I will explain myself as best I can."
Harry started walking into the kitchen and put water into a kettle for tea. "I hope you know that I really don't care what the papers say about me. I'm used to good and bad press. I don't have the Daily Prophet delivered anymore because I got tired of hearing about what silly gossip they had written about me. Now, I only read the Lovegood's Quibbler. And I'll always give Luna an interview without a second thought. I trust she won't make anything up or deviate off topic. Any other paper is just a load of bollocks when I'm mentioned."
Harry chuckled. “I returned Regulus’ necklace to him. The one that was a horcrux. Though the one he has is a replica that I thought was the real horcrux. He really seemed fond of Regulus so I thought it just made sense to return it to him. And ever since I gave it back to him he’s been kinder and more tolerant.”
Severus arrived at Hermione’s childhood home and was nervously pacing at the front door waiting for her to answer. He had never more anxious in his life and that was saying something considering what he had been through.
Hermione and Harry were stunned into silence it seemed because Snape almost seemed playful and more tolerant of them. And since Harry and Hermione didn't know Snape very well other than being in his classes and he was always so mean. But this Snape seemed lighter and oddly a bit nicer and they didn't know how to proceed or act around this "new" Snape.
Draco looked at Harry intently. "Harry, that was just abhorrently embarrassing. Do your friends even know manners? Hermione could have at least knocked before barging in." He looked annoyed.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand back. "I'm glad we both enjoy each other's company. Next time we should have a seekers game. Let me walk you out." He reluctantly released Harry's hand. He stood up and started walking back to the terrace with Harry following behind.
Draco hugged his mother back. "I love you too, Mother. I will be in touch. I am sure Harry would not allow me to forget to write or visit you." He smirked at Harry.
He looked at Winky kind of confused. Then realisation set in and his eyes went wide that Potter was here, in his house, ready for tea. "Yes Winky please take him into the sitting room. Also, inform Mother of his arrival. I will be there momentarily." Draco needed to compose himself before entering into hell. He sighed and did a few breathing exercises to prepare himself. He had to remember to be on his best behaviour. Finally, he walked into his house.
As Harry returned to his seat across from Draco, he also thought he did not want to let go of his ex-rival's hand.
Draco glared at Potter. "Thank you, Chosen One. I so appreciate such a grand gesture." He said sarcastically.
Severus rolled his eyes. “Yes, one should always respect the books and their feelings.” He gave her an amused look. “I am not trying to rush you or anything but I was wondering when you would like to move your stuff. I mean you do not have to move at all if you do not want to. I just mean I would like to know.” He rambled.
"Yes I do like you too. You better start believing it because it's definitely true. I wouldn't lie about something like this. It's not a joke, I swear. I really do like you and want to be your boyfriend at some point in the future. As for our friends it would be too shocking for them to understand if we were together right away. I think we should all get together sometime. You, me, Hermione, Ron, Blaise and Pansy I mean. I want to get to know your friends. I hope they will eventually accept me into your life." Harry said wistfully.
Hermione took her wand out and pointed it at the doe figurine. "Semper fidelis. Te mihi revelare." She spoke the words from the letter slowly and pronounced them carefully.
Severus rolled his eyes. “I am not at all surprised, Miss Granger. Though, you are the only one to reap all the benefits of my so-called softer side.” He quirked his eyebrow up and smirked.
Draco looked surprised by how the Weasleys weren't concerned. "I'm relieved to know they trusted me with your well being. Blaise is one of the few very open to meeting you. He always wanted to be friends with you and admonished me for being awful to you and your friends. He will be happy that I made amends with you. And yes I agree time flies when you are having fun. I do not remember the last time I lost track of the time when spending time with someone. It is refreshing. Thank you for coming by for afternoon tea with Mother and I. I really enjoyed spending time with you. We should do this again sometime."
Severus deepened the kiss and held Hermione close. After a few minutes, he pulled away. “Hermione, you are one incredible witch. I do not know what I have done to ever deserve such a treasure. The way you describe me and how you explain why I am a good man and how others see me in a positive light makes me want to believe that I am good. For so long, I was convinced otherwise. It is quite difficult to change the perception of one’s self as you know but I do trust what you are saying is true.” He grimaced. “Wait, you really wish to spend the rest of your life with me?” He looked at her curiously.
Draco chuckled. “I do not wish to disturb your highness but I also do not want to make Mother sore.”
Narcissa nodded and smiled. "Thank you Harry. We appreciate your help. I will go fetch Draco. I will return shortly." She walked up the stairs leaving Harry and Severus alone.
Harry moved as quickly as possible and dragged Draco up the stairs and into their bedroom. He passionately kissed Draco as they shuffled towards the bed. The back of Draco’s knees hit the end of the bed. Harry pulled away and smirked. He pushed Draco onto the bed and crawled on top of him. At first Harry was kissing and nibbling on his neck. Then he started giving Draco butterfly kisses on his face. Due to Draco’s impatience, he pulled Harry into a searing kiss. Both were moaning loudly and unabashedly.
