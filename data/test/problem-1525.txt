Also, hah, that last bit was cheesy as fuck, so sorry about that
“Come on, Draco, just give the bird an extra Knut,” Pansy wheedled.
“Ginny?” Harry echoed, head suddenly clearer. He craned his head to look at her, eyes curious.
“Just…” Weasley shifted nervously. “Just.”
He exhaled roughly, gazing at Draco with a desperation that split Draco open. His eyes were so deep Draco drowned in them, fucking cliché as it was.
someone from Witch Weekly? What is that? Who does that? Just… what the fuck.”
“Oaf?” He shouldered closer to Zabini, gaze murderous. “Oaf? Do you—“
Theo jabbed the tip of the wand deeper into Draco’s sternum, and he hacked in response. The pressure of the wand felt somehow non- threatening, though Draco knew it could do serious damage. In fact, this whole thing felt like a sort of emotional response, a desperate ploy for
“He’s alright,” Blaise replied firmly.
And pinched that exquisite, pudgy, soft roll of fat clinging to the lean skin of his hips..
Harry bit down, sucking on Malfoy’s pulse point, laving over it until Malfoy tipped his head back with a very un- Malfoy groan that made Harry want to quite literally jump him. Need pooled in his stomach, throbbing want that went straight to his cock.
“That’s not all he’s seen, Ron,” Ginny purred around the smallest spoonful possible of slop.
Pansy looked irritated. “What does that have to do with anything?”
So far, he was pretty sure he’d just alluded rather vaguely to a ‘misunderstanding.’ Plus, the Headmistress was no fool. She probably didn’t need Draco to explain what she’d seen. She did seem to enjoy watching him try, though; her beady eyes held a glimmer of something suspiciously like laughter while he struggled to finish his sentences. Even more so as Potter finally raised his flushed cheeks and started to haltingly add to the story. Unsurprisingly, he blamed the whole thing on himself, which was the stupidest thing Draco had ever heard. Not to mention unnecessary; the way he’d spun it, they weren’t even in for a detention. He tried hard not to be endeared by the contrite looks Potter kept casting him from under his lashes, and failed miserably. As per usual.
“Oh, come on, Pans,” Draco cackled. “That’s pretty funny. You stalked the girl for a month last year, and you bump into her by accident at this weirdo positivity centre? After you stole her mail and blocked her Floo for
- to describe as endearing.
Malfoy stiffened.
And it smacked him in the face like green eyes and apples and a thousand batches of Wistful Draught.
Draco nodded, disappointment welling in his throat, which was ridiculous, really, because Pansy had never been here, he hadn’t been expecting her, and he’d only thought she was here for about two seconds.
! Whether they knew better at age eleven or not, they still fucking joined Voldemort in the end, didn’t they? They let Muggle- borns be tortured and killed by their own parents, and didn’t do a thing. They—” Ron choked off a sob, voice rising uncontrollably. “They
Harry wanted to lick into him, dissolve all his tension. He compromised by moving closer, taking a step towards the other man.
Draco gave him a pleading look; Blaise’s eyes were like delicious pools of stubborn chocolate. Draco sank back down into his seat with a moan, covering his face with his hands.
“I’m sorry, Potty, am I the one standing in a bloody broom cupboard with this knob, —”
The hallway had narrowed considerably by now- Draco double checked to make sure the walls weren’t just fucked up from the alcohol, and just about ascertained that it was not the Firewhisky. That meant he’d gone too far. The corridor was wider at the beginning- he should go back. He turned, swaying alarmingly, and spotted a smallish wooden door set in a deep cranny in the wall, almost at the beginning of the hallway.
Was it stupid?
They waited until the scent of vaguely musty lemon cake she carried with her had faded away, and the tentative clunks of her walking stick had died down, and then carried on down the stairs in a more subdued fashion, only elbowing each other when strictly necessary.
His eyes glided over Harry, and they felt like stroking fingertips, landing obviously on the bulge in Harry’s boxers. He stared for so long it was entirely inappropriate, and Harry wanted him so badly it felt painful.
Malfoy looked ghost- white, the shadows under his eyes prominent.
, Draco had to be imagining that he’d just glanced at his mouth.
Draco nodded slowly. “It’s not weird?”
“Nice,” Harry nodded, impressed. “So what’d they do?”
Pansy rounded on Blaise. “Do you mind, Blasius?”
**********************************************************************************************************************************************************
Draco clenched his jaw, a muscle working near the bone. He stared Zabini down. If this had been a Gryffindor, or for that matter, anybody not in Slytherin, they’d have been on the ground clutching a vital body part by now, but the Snakes had a code of honour between themselves. They tried not to turn on each other. Even so, there were other unspoken rules. Rules about family, and respect towards other people’s relatives, distant or not. In pureblood world, birth and loyalty were everything, and the family name was not to be trifled with.
The boys stepped off, and stood beside each other, both slightly dishevelled, with twin flushes working their way up their necks.
Draco had one half- second to think,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. By people who want to get into your pants,” Draco snapped, leaning away from Blaise and his shameless mouth.
Draco was perplexed. “As in me personally or people in general?”
She giggled into his shirt, and the sound was muffled but so fucking familiar to him. He’d grown up with that giggle, and his chest heaved once as he squeezed her even tighter, his mind for once not spinning as he absorbed her into himself as much as he could. And then, having overcome the urge to sob into her hair, he gripped her shoulders hard and set her at arm’s length. Pansy peered up at him, eyes red- rimmed and peaceful.
this person- this secret writer. That was why he’d been so wound up about it. Why he’d wanted to badly to know.
- Draco surreptitiously massaged his wrists, suppressing a moan at the thought of Potter holding his wrists together with that precise, unshakable pressure.
Draco thought firmly.
And there it was.
His stomach growled, a faint edge of queasiness curling through him, and Draco was just about to slump fully to the table when Pansy elbowed him hard, staring at the doors to the Great Hall.
The room sobered a little, Ron’s eyes becoming shuttered and sadder, as they always did when he was thinking of Fred.
McGonagall nodded. “Thank you for coming to see me. I hope, Mr Potter,” she raised her voice not unkindly, flicking a pointed brow at Potter. “You might learn to differentiate between ‘emergency’ and ‘showboating.’”
Zabini huffed a laugh. “Date? No. Fuck, no.” He rubbed the back of his neck self- consciously, fingers precise and sweeping. “We were more like brothers- the summer was tough, for everyone. We became too close too fast for it to be romantic. It was like… we needed each other’s advice, and companionship, and support. There was no time for any of that.”
Come on, Draco.
Thank Salazar the key had worked, because it had a tendency to be temperamental—
“Didn’t make that cle- ear,” Draco drawled in a sing- song tone.
“Wha-?” Draco said sleepily. He opened his eyes a half- inch, brain processing everything that had just been said, and then his eyes flew open with a jolt, and he sat up immediately. There was a yelp just to his right, as though somebody had sprang away from his bed quickly.
“Think he’s just hurt, mate,” Weasley muttered, homework timetable in hand. “I don’t think it was really about what happened when….”
Her tone was unsure, but the woman nodded professionally, gathering three menus in her slim arms with a practiced snap and leading them ahead to a set of stairs. “Just this way, please. Silver guests are seated downstairs.”
It also did not help that the classroom was packed with students, unlike most of Draco’s other NEWT classes, and it was horribly hot, the air stifling and unpleasant. Draco had been put near the back- advantage of having a surname starting with ‘M’, but unfortunately ‘M’ was also very close to ‘P’, and with that came issues.
“Stop being a child,” Zabini hissed, knocking his arms down and turning away. He’d evidently not found what he was looking for, as his eyes were anxious and his voice thin when he spoke.
He staggered to the door, lurching when he reached the handle so that his full weight, combined with the heavy mass of books in his back, fell directly onto the door. It swung open at blinding speed, crashing into the musty interior wall, and Draco fell bruisingly hard on his hands and knees, staring at the unmistakeable floor of-
The class moved into action, books being picked up and chairs dragged across the classroom and bags dumped down in different places.
Harry grinned, and took Malfoy’s cock in his hands, licking over the base in broad, flat strokes until Malfoy groaned aloud.
Fucking god, Potter’s eyes were so green.
“That’s what I thought.”
They smiled back, friendly pockmarks between bricks like a million sunshiny dimples. Black flowers ghosted around Draco, and the air billowed at him. He blinked.
why it looks good? My hair looks good messy because it looks like I’ve just—"
“Got it down to a science, have you, Potter? Tell me… how long did it take you to get him whipped? Not long, I imagine… all the boys are just
whoa, it's been months- really hasn't felt that long, but I guess time's moving weirdly nowadays. I've been updating my other fic a little more often, so this baby's been pushed back a while. Anyway, hope you guys enjoy chapter 2 :)) know it's been awhile coming
“Sorry, Mrs Finchman!” He scowled at Blaise and bent closer to the old lady. “Crime and punishment, you know.”
“No problem,” Theo replied quickly, giving Draco an almost motherly little smile and taking a seat once he’d slipped behind his desk and into his chair by the windows.
It was kind of incredible, actually. He felt like just asking Potter if he could wait just a minute, so he could step away and maybe have a mediwizard confirm what he knew but couldn’t quite believe—that his pulse was racing faster than the time Blaise had found a baby Hippogriff crouched in Draco’s walk- in wardrobe.
It did things to him, okay?
“I know,” Potter said, head hung, and Draco felt this fierce, clawing ache to stroke his hair in comfort, and maybe possessiveness, he didn’t know. “I know he is.”
Harry shivered. Fuck. He needed to get a grip. He fumed to look at Malfoy, breath catching from the pure want he felt buzzing at his fingertips. But Malfoy was still staring absent-mindedly out of the window, and fuck. Harry was normally . . . not clingy, but he felt it like a punch to the gut. That mewling, pleading side of him wanted to curl up and sob, let the hot wet inlay of tears on his cheeks soothe him. Catharsis. Not an orgasm- fuck, he was so bloody hard – but still. Release. God, but he wanted to get fucked, goddamnit, and
Weasley drew back, shoulders puffing out as he worked to think of something to say in return. Draco rolled his eyes and turned irritatedly back to the book, nerves wrung out from battling the potent effects of the smoke and this moron’s idiocy, because maybe Draco had said some stupid stuff - okay, a lot of stupid stuff - in sixth year, but everyone knew he hated failing at anything. Draco cared about school more than was comfortable, most days, but now that fierce desire to win was stumbling over the choking mist of steam the fucking potion was giving off, and the imbecile he’d been shoved with. It was just… too much.
The weight of Malfoy against him, the hard press of their cocks together, that rolling… Harry was wrecked. His breaths were coming raggedly, and he couldn’t think of anything except the pleasure. When his lashes fluttered open slightly, Malfoy was grinning down at him, unbearably smug.
“Yeah,” came a sullen voice.
“That makes no difference, Ron! Godric, can’t you just let go of what happened? They’ve all fucking made amends. Slytherins have been dragged in and out of the Wizengamot’s Court a thousand times since the end of the war. Every single one of them has paid their dues, sometimes when they didn’t even need to. They don’t need you giving them shit for stuff they’ve already done penance for! Let go of your outdated conviction that Slytherin is bad, Slytherin is evil. They’re
Nine thirty.
Anyway, he digressed.
“I- sorry, Professor,” he said, swallowing his pride.
Not Draco.
“So…?” Blaise probed confusedly, and Draco groaned.
Ron slackened against the sofa. “It’s only that-- well, we spent years insulting the git. He spent years making your life hell.”
Malfoy smirked, a slow drag of the lips that made Harry’s heart pound hard against his ribcage. He struggled to stay resolute.
--softened Draco. It was ludicrous, and frankly unfair besides. Potter already had so much. He already had
He could imagine Pansy’s face right about now; disapproving as hell, mouth pursed and eyes flat. “Please tell me you didn’t, Draco,” she’d say acidly. He grinned.
“I’d rather overuse Expelliarmus than be the first one to fire off an Unforgivable!” Potter spat. His shirt gaped open at the front as he swung his body round entirely, and Draco watched with a slack jaw as he
The War.
Cool water slid down his throat, soothing away the ragged feeling from the corrosive heat of the Firewhisky. Draco inhaled deeply, breathing in the scent of clean wax polish off the table, garlicky rich scents from other tables and the sweet mist of Pansy’s perfume.
Draco flinched, realising he’d been staring for at least twenty seconds, and straightened, finally staring Potter determinedly in the eye. To his surprise, he was met with not aggression or annoyance, but humiliation. Hot embarrassment was thick in Potter’s gaze, and Draco frowned, feeling like he’d suddenly missed a step. He was filled with the urge to smooth that expression away, tilt those lips up and make his green eyes sparkle.
He’d set his wand down, trying to hold onto the contentment fast dissipating in his stomach, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling on the edge of his happiness, the one that made warning bells start flashing in his head. The one that told him this wasn’t enough anymore. After all, when Draco had started this shit, he’d been lonely as fuck, and desperate. He’d had no expectations. Seeing the response had been like giving a starving person food. But after a while… the person’s appetite is bound to increase. He tried not to think about the fact that maybe this wasn’t sating his newfound desire for… something, god, whatever the hell this was.
“How d’you figure that?” Draco asked, then yelped from a particularly sharp jab to the ribs.
“Ginger newt.”
“Alright,
Much as he tried, he couldn’t bring himself to hate it.
**********************************************************************************************************************************************
“We’re
He stared at Zabini, floored.
Draco took a deep breath in, trying not to just lose it and hit Potter. A particularly inviting expanse of pale skin, exposed by Potter’s loosened tie and open collar, beckoned him. Draco wanted to bruise it, maybe throw a punch or a jinx, or just
Firstly, he’d need to know which player went in which shower, which was impossible unless he saw it for himself, and he’d need to check the wall  after each player went in. But for that, he’d need to be in the changing rooms at the same time as Gryffindor, which was honestly impossible. Practices didn’t mix. It gave other houses an opportunity to spy on each other, and promoted dirty tricks in the locker room. Back when houses sometimes did split practices and were on the pitch training at the same time, several of the best players got jinxed in the showers by the other team training, or hexed in front of the mirrors. It was a minefield for poor sportsmanship.
He tried to form words, to defend himself against the incredibly low blow, because no matter the animosity between the two of them Draco had always thought Potter was too noble to ever mention that day.
Draco sat stiffly in his chair, refusing to even spare a glance at the broad back or head of dark, tumbled curls—
Draco wasn’t going to worry.
Harry rolled over with a groan, cheek damp with- he recognised with a faint sense of disgust- drool. He reached an arm out blindly, fingers groping clumsily over the bedside table until he felt the cool slide of lenses and metal underneath his fingers. Coughing, he grasped his glasses by the nose bridge, opening them and stuffing them onto his face hastily.
Draco thought infuriatedly--  that, even though it was angry, made Draco’s eyebrows flick together for a second, his breath to still, before he got a grip.
“Will you give them a bit of a heel, Gin? Not too high, mind.”
It would have been easy to just Vanish the oatmeal verbally, but Hermione’s hearing had become incredibly sharp with pregnancy; the Mediwizards said the baby inside her was fuelling not only her magic, but her human senses. She could hear whispers from a mile off, and they had no chance of muttering Vanishing spells without her hearing. It had taken weeks for Harry to master non- verbal magic; he’d never been great in school, and it was more difficult now he was older. Ron was in charge of the wandless stuff because it came more easily to him in his family home; there was a definite air of Weasley magic permeating the place, and he could draw on it without too much hassle. But the non- verbal spell was Harry’s responsibility, and he pressed his lips firmly together, flourishing his wand in a small, precise motion under the table.
he told it, ducking his head to the page and immersing himself in the first paragraph.
“Wonderful.” Pansy sat back, looking satisfied.
Immediately, his face looked severe and bony, cheekbones too sharp, ears noticeably prominent. Draco pulled the strand out again, and took a breath. At first glance, it was great- now he was wondering with relief how he could have doubted—
“He was hot,” Ginny supplied helpfully. “Just a bastard.”
He needed a plan.
Draco cringed.
“She made me come with her,” Malfoy gritted out. “To pay it a visit. I didn’t recognise it before… the way it revealed itself reminded me… I just remembered.”
Draco choked on his chicken, letting the hunk of meat fall from his hand and land with a clatter on his plate. The surprise of seeing those green eyes fixed on him made him swallow, hard, for multiple reasons, most of which he would have preferred not to think about. Draco recalled with a wince the nights spent staring at the swathes of material covering the top of his four- poster, visualising those very same green eyes, trying to pinpoint the exact emotion they stirred up in his belly. He had never succeeded. He glanced up again through his hair, which had fallen forwards over his forehead. No; Potter was now engaged in conversation with Weasley, who had become if possible more gangly and red- headed since the War. Draco had heard rumours that he was with Granger, and it had made his stomach leap, not in joy for the happy couple, but because secretly he’d always thought maybe Potter would… well, he’d always hated Granger for being close to Potter, And after Granger’s little Cinderella act- he had become familiar with Muggle fairy tales while haunting the London bookshop every day- at the Yule Ball, Draco hadn’t slept for weeks, thinking feverishly of ways to uglify her permanently. He told himself once again that it was only that he hadn’t wanted to see Granger happy. Or Potter. It was because he hated Potter. Hated him.
Thanks for reading :)
Pansy snorted. “Not company, that’s for sure.”
Once he got to the kitchen, Harry turned awkwardly, sending a spark of his magic flaring out so the lights flickered on.
“That’s alright, m’boy, it’s your partner you ought to apologise to. Look! Mr. Potter had to hold him back. Are your wrists alright, Mr. Malfoy? No chafing?”
“What?” He said, warm breath tickling Harry’s cheek.
“What?” Draco grinned. “This?” And he did it again, mouth open in an exaggerated ‘ahhhh’ from the fiery heat in the back of his throat.
She paused, and when she spoke again her voice was edged with something heavy, meaningful.
If he listened carefully- Draco turned the shower off and stuck his ear close to the stall door- yes, they were gone. There was no sound of damp feet, no voices echoing against the hollow wooden walls of the Quidditch changing rooms. He opened the stall door and wrapped a towel, hanging from a nearby rack, around his waist. Draco cast a quick Tempus- it was nearly six. He was late for dinner. Cursing under his breath the amount of time his teammates took to get dressed, Draco pulled on his school uniform at top speed, combing his fingers through his wet hair. There was no time to gel it. Staring despondently at himself in the mirror, Draco’s inner Narcissa winced at the sight of his rumpled shirt. Even worse, still damp from the shower, he started to sweat from the starchy cotton against his skin. Draco pushed his shirtsleeves up, threw his tie on- thank Salazar Lucius had drilled him in the art of tying  an excellent half- Windsor; his fingers fairly flew as he knotted the green and silver material- and ran out of the door with his Quidditch bag, stuffed full of gear, banging against his leg.
Truthfully, all throughout school, Draco had never wanted to be more than friends with anyone, anyone except… well, Potter. It made him cringe to think about it, cringe and shiver and swallow hard, because no matter how much he tried to pass off those feverish daydreams and years of fantasies as a misguided crush, there had been something visceral there that he hadn’t felt since. A mere flash of green eyes, quickly shielded by dark fans of lashes, had been enough to make his heart race. A brush of pale skin, or the sight of the soft fall of Potter’s black hair had made him ache, a full- body ache, as though he were missing something essential. He’d lain in bed, lips parted and reaching, hot and slick with sweat and longing, thinking with such intensity of Potter, Potter, Potter. He’d recognised the tiniest twitches of the other boy’s lips, had studied him for so long with such fervour that he could see his every emotion play out across his face like a Muggle film. Potter had been his constant, a bright sharp obsession to cling to in his greying world.
Draco was completely still.
“We’ll do it. As long as it’s casual.” He looked Draco in the eye. “No dirty tricks, mind games, trying to injure us. A practice game, that’s all. Nothing else. Deal?”
Draco’s lips twitched. “Pans, you
There was a pause, in which they both looked at each other, Draco in mild hostility, and maybe a little curiosity, and Granger with an open amusement that bewildered Draco entirely.
Blurrily, he could make out Ginny standing a few metres back, and he coughed, clearing his throat.
Ron leaned in confidentially. “Mental, isn’t it? Dipping the poor kid in water. I tell you, these Muggles…” he shook his rumpled head disbelievingly, and then brightened. “Did I hear Ginny come in?”
“So, Zabini,” Draco said, hands tucked into his pockets as they walked briskly up the first floor stairs. “How come you’re talking to me civilly now?”
The other boy’s smile grew, and he spun to lean his back flat against the wall, lacing his hands behind his head with a lazy easiness that made Draco’s stomach flip.
Potter’s voice became harder, sharpened by something that mingled defensiveness and urgency. “These weren’t from this week.” He gestured to his wrists for the first time, a careful slide of fingers over the bandages, and Draco winced, unable to meet the other boy’s eyes. Blaise, beside him, was still.
He allowed himself a minute to breathe before going into the showers, and sort out the tangle of thoughts knotting itself stubbornly in his mind. He closed his eyes, and mentally plunged into the melee.
Harry did so.
Zabini scoffed. “Who else had inside information on the most underground, secret stuff the Death Eaters did? Who else has been trying to clear his name with the bloody Ministry ever since they basically put his father
"Well how do
“Actually…” Pansy said, quiet as a mouse, and the boys snapped to attention.
“Ah, Draco,” Blaise said, clutching at his heart. There was still a smudge of chocolate mousse at the side of his mouth. “You are so cold to me now. So cruel. I remember a time when you used to look at me with soft grey eyes, so trusting over your green Slytherin tie. I remember how you used to blush when we made eye contact. I remember thinking how, for a virgin, you were surprisingly
*The Great Hall*
. The same way he just couldn’t stop jiggling his leg under the table, despite how it had begun to throb and pulse with uncontrollable adrenaline. The same way he just couldn’t shift on his seat so his arse was slightly less tensed and his stomach less compressed. He was paralysed by an invisible hand that clamped down over his nostrils and squeezed, a silent weight that pressed on his chest and suffocated him, a spectral something that made his pulse flutter in erratic little bursts like the wings of a butterfly.
“Right. Okay.” Draco frowned, trying to process. It felt like a great weight had been lifted from his chest. When he looked between Potter and Zabini, it no longer felt weighted or painful. “Okay.” He gave Zabini a cautious smile, and received a dimpled counterpart in return.
But when it came down to it, Draco Malfoy had begged.
And then? He was going to find out who the fucking mysterious writer was. Anonymity was all very well, but Draco had had his fill of it.
Draco tried to gather his wits. “So why are we talking about—?”
“Exactly!” Draco said irritatedly. “We’re the only ones whose opinions he can trust. And I say,” he tapped his foot on the floor in emphasis, “it’s disgusting.”
In the bathroom, Draco stared into the mirror at the single blond strand hanging just over his forehead. He couldn’t decide if it was aristocratic or pretentious, and it was important to get a good balan—
Ginny stalked over to his wardrobe, doors akimbo and a slew of shirts sliding out over one another, various colours starkly contrasting. She ran a finger over the hangers, looking at him with a furrowed brow, and hooked a practiced hand around a hanger, withdrawing a black Yves Saint Laurent shirt, polka dotted with tiny white speckles. It was loose and silky, slipping over the metal hanger like water.
“When was this? Come on, Draco, are you making this up?” Pansy giggled.
“My Aunt Bellatrix inherited this house.”
Like, really?
“Fucking hell,” he muttered.
A particularly well- aimed jab from the knife inside Draco’s head made him hack into the sleeve of his robes. Zabini recoiled, looking disgusted in an aristocratic sort of way that made Draco long to punch him. He gritted his teeth, trying to stay lucid.
He gave himself an appraising sort of look in the mirror, running a brush through his hair, and then messing up the front so it was soft over his cheekbones, falling a little bit in his eyes and corkscrewing at his temples, damp from the shower.
Yay! What does everyone think?
one of those moments.”
It was going to be a long morning.
Draco kept his eyes glued to the ground, slowly doing a half- turn and making his way over to where Potter was sitting- or rather, in his eyeline, the thick chair legs. He shoved his hands in his pockets, throat dry, and stood awkwardly behind Potter’s chair, just out of sight. Madly, he wondered if it were too late to do a good leg workout for some extra muscle enhancement. He settled for a frantic, rather unsubtle arse flex under the clinging fabric of his trousers, and was rewarded by an explosive snort from behind him, undoubtedly from either Pansy or Blaise. Draco dragged his eyes up the chair legs, painstakingly dragging over the polished base and back of the chair, the armrests, and then there was the broad line of Potter’s shoulders, a silkily clinging shirt, pale neck exposed a fraction of a centimetre above the collar. Dark, thick hair curling round his temples, ending in an unfairly endearing peak at the nape of the neck. His back muscles were tense, still under the shimmering shirt, and then they fucking
The Floo connection ended, and Harry went back to his notes. Despite the weight of what had happened, Harry knew both of his best friends well enough and trusted that their relationship would survive this hiccup. Confident that everything was fine, he took one of the manuals, settled himself on the couch, and continued reading as if there had been no interruption at all.
"Would you like to open it yourself?"
His mother laughed, her voice tinkling with the drops falling from the watering can. "It pleases me to do so, Draco," she answered. "Such simple pleasures make my day seem much more rewarding."
Harry and Draco already knew that most Metamorphmagi didn't develop the skill to change the more fundamental aspects of their body until after puberty. Teddy, at eight, would be able to change his hair and eye color easily, and some softer parts such as ears and his nose, but it wouldn't be until he was of age for him to be able to change his weight, height or skeletal structure.
Rogers scratched his head while deep in thought. "A security detail would be too obvious."
Molly Weasley had taken to prowling along the corridors in her highly frenzied state, which caused Harry's levels of concern to spike up even more.
It was those precious moments, right before, that Draco saw the determination that the green eyes exuded, the singe-minded intent to strike down the maniacal murderer in front of him to save the people who meant everything to him.
"Well,
"I mean it, Harry," the man said, squeezing his hand in a comforting manner. "Thank you for everything."
"Eugh, that was terrible!"
"However," and at this she looked more matronly and strict, "I would heavily advise you, Ginny, to limit your training for this pregnancy." At Ginny's move to speak, Rosewood cut her off immediately. "Your first pregnancy was fine, but this one... the diagnostic spells indicate a highly fluctuating magical core. It would be dangerous for you to be out and about after you are past the sixth month mark. I recall telling young Mrs. Weasley to stay home for her entire pregnancy for Rose, but since you're in much better health, I can professionally vouch for you after month number six. Until then, I would still advise you to take it easy on the aggressive flying."
As Malfoy prepared to leave, he gave the two Aurors a friendly smirk. "Thank you for having me over, last night and this morning," he said. He gave a meaningful glance towards Harry, and the latter knew that he was also silently thanking him for everything else they couldn't mention in front of Ron. "James is a wonderful child, and so is Teddy. I'm looking forward to seeing them again, if you don't mind."
"He...He's -"
"Mr. Malfoy," Kingsley said, this time with a softer tone, "Mr. Potter spent that meeting telling me everything he knew about you, and your family. Oh, he still hates your Father, naturally, but he was insistent on sharing information about both you and Narcissa, in an effort to convince me of the true extent of your involvement in the war. He therefore provided Pensieve memories-" Draco blanched "-that indeed showed a much different perspective."
"Astoria is very close to having our son," he said suddenly into the silence. He had hoped to be much more articulate but apparently his eloquence had gone away to wherever his Malfoy pride had disappeared to when he Flooed in the first place.
"No, he doesn't," he said slowly. "But I do."
"We know why we're here."
Draco waved him off. "Weasley was right. His predictions have been accurate so far. It's hard to feel scared when I've got a good team on my case."
After all of the trauma from the war, Harry and Ginny had easily reunited, falling back into their relationship as if the break had never happened. Getting engaged, Moving in, having a child together... Now, though, this one big shared responsibility seemed to be breaking down their comfort zone.
Harry flushed. "Er, sorry, I didn't actually think about any of that, actually..."
"So are you in?" Weasley asked.
After two long years of the wizarding world fidgeting in anticipation, socialites Draco Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass have finally completed their contract and tied the knot.
Harry nodded. He turned back to their Healer. "And you're sure that both Ginny and the baby will be safe if we do this as soon as possible?"
"I apologize," Malfoy countered immediately, cheeks slightly pink. "To be honest, your appearance was not at all expected, and this led to quite a shock."
"OH," Ron said, aghast. "I can't believe I never mentioned it to you!" He glanced quickly at Harry, who of course knew exactly why his friend hadn't mentioned it. The topic of that particular day hadn't exactly been something they wanted to remember. To be honest, Malfoy had actually helped to improve their moods by the end of that night.
Harry just sighed. "Not for now, but we'll tell you about it when it gets sorted out," he promised. Macmillan nodded, said his goodbyes and disappeared.
Ron blurted out "I hate this!" and promptly drained the rest of his mug before bringing it down heavily and banging it on their table. Harry didn't care, since his Solum Sanctuarii bindings would prevent anyone from noticing them. He was surprised, therefore, when someone did.
"Malfoy," Harry said, his voice suddenly laced with trepidation, but also pride. "I'd like you to meet my son, James."
Finally, she leaned back down on the bed and placed her arms around her, as if hugging herself. "I-" She tried to say. "I fainted."
"I'm sorry," she continued, voice still soft enough that Malfoy couldn't hear. She spoke quickly, which Harry took to mean that she was pressed for time. "They've threatened to take legal action against me unless I fix the falsified documentation that the Liaison Office gave. It's an urgent matter, you see, and I needed to go tonight, but I waited to see you first, for James."
Ginny seemed to see it in his eyes. "No, Harry, this isn't about you. It's not your fault. I'm doing this because it's what's best. For all of us."
"Still haven't figured it out, I see."
Sometimes, they had James, Al and Scorpius as well, though the latter two were usually kept in the enlarged crib while Teddy spent time with Draco and Harry kept an eye on a crawling James.
Unfortunately, Teddy had run back to Harry, which meant the blond had his full attention back at Harry.
"I think it's brilliant!" Ginny said, hugging him from behind. "With your
"I've never really been one to stick to the rules, you know," she whispered conspiratorially, and Draco could even swear that she had winked at him. His breath caught at the sudden affection he felt for her, and he had to stop himself from hugging her in public.
"No, you're absolutely right," Harry agreed. It was then that he noticed their empty cups. He checked the clock on top of the fridge.
Mother and son quietly glided through a hallway, led by two Aurors. The door at the end would lead to the courtroom, where they would have to give their personal testimonies. The Aurors explained some protocol, but both Malfoys merely remained silent. Draco admitted that had he chosen to speak, all of his resolve would seep away and he wouldn't have the strength to face the full Wizengamot to save himself and his mother. He'd rather he saved his words for when it would really matter.
Harry couldn't avoid the warm flush he felt on his cheeks at the unprompted compliment.
Ron remained quiet for a while, and Harry was afraid that he had overstepped his boundaries, but then the redhead nodded and said, "Thanks."
"Yes, I did, actually," Harry said with pride, giving his guest a brilliant smile. "It took a bit of talk with Ginny, of course, but she agreed that James Sirius was a great way to honor my father and godfather."
"Yes!" Draco said, excitement shining in his eyes. "I've only started, Potter, and I've already figured out two possible leads for you to work on! It's based on- why are you holding your arms out like that?" he asked suddenly. He couldn't help it, it was a distracting sight. He was surprised that Potter seemed to become even tenser at his words.
"It's your responsibility, though," Hermione admonished, sounding like her old prefect self.
Draco sighed inwardly. He had no idea either, but he did his best to justify it, as much to himself as to his mother. "I've just been thinking about it... I know that it goes against our traditions, but... I felt this... need... I can't explain it, Mother, but I... I want to be a part of his naming as well."
Alongside the warding, there were also the special legal policies to complete the casting of
"Yes, I knew that," Potter said calmly, nodding in assent.
It took two more hours before the Healers requested for Draco's presence in the delivery room.
His comment made Pansy laugh heartily. "Oh no, a mini-Draco! Merlin help us!"
Draco was pink in the face, but Harry had a harder time guessing what he was thinking until he actually spoke.
Harry agreed wholeheartedly. The Healers had told him then that Ginny's had been difficult because she had carried the boy to more than full term, and had to be induced to go into labor. Other than that though, they just received a mild scolding for allowing Ginny in the presence of a "highly stressful competitive environment". Harry knew though, that being with her team had really helped Ginny in more ways than one. She had really belonged out there, and her mood and health were always high up where Quidditch was concerned. Come to think of it, Harry would bet his vault that Ginny's health would have deteriorated if she'd been forced to stay home and rest. It just went against who she was, and Harry was proud that she had such a strong constitution. James was perfectly healthy, a mix of the best between the two of them.
No, Harry hadn't been told. But he had always assumed that living under the same roof as Voldemort would have unhinged a normal man, more so a teenager. He shook his head, so that Malfoy wouldn't feel as if he had been interrupted.
"You learn something new everyday, eh?" Harry drained his glass.
Wearing down the carpet in front of his office fire did nothing to soothe Harry's nerves, but he couldn't stop. A sudden sense of recklessness had overcome him, and his feet took up the challenge of using his pent up energy. He felt like a tightly wound coil at the end of its limit. The Floo roared a vivid emerald, and the brunet was immediately on his knees to take the call he'd been expecting from Malfoy Manor.
Ron and Hermione had not, as Harry expected, started screaming at him. However, both of his best friends were rendered speechless for quite a while, and he merely spent their confused silence, patiently waiting.
The Auror smiled shyly. "For letting me through. For this," he said, gesturing between the two of them.
"My friendships..."
can only be invoked by persons of high status."
She lazily shrugged her shoulders. "I'm afraid this wasn't part of the plan, but it's a better guarantee, isn't it? He'll never let go now. He'll never find out. He'll never doubt us. There's no need for you to keep pressuring me anymore."
Draco sat beside him. He was done Vanishing his bottles anyway. "How's the new life treating you, then?" he ventured with a little trepidation.
"How… How could you! HOW COULD YOU!" Yelling out those words, he felt all of his welled-up emotions suddenly ebb away, leaving a feeling of nothingness in his gut. Not for nothing was he one of the cleverest wizards of the time. He knew it in his heart to be true, and all evidence did point towards the fact.
"Anyway," Harry had explained, "Teddy will be meeting the Tonkses with Andy, so he'll be Flooing out after dinner. So at least it'll be quieter for you."
They settled in their usual past-midnight habit of sharing a bit of Firewhiskey between the two of them and just basking in the warmth of the fire. Not that anyone really knew how often this type of thing happened. Though it wasn't as if they were hiding some terrible secret.
"Oh. Just a Charm to fix up the temperature in here. I like to keep Scorpius moderately comfortable." He turned his head to look at Harry with a trademark eyebrow raise. "That's not a crime, is it?"
The shell-shocked blond heard the voice calling his name, and he felt his blood run cold. He turned reluctantly towards the source. There, in the dim light of his makeshift prison, was…
"Our betrothal contracts were written so as to favor our respective needs for ambition, and we both still have those drives to take care of even now. I don't believe much has changed in our situation except for the new heir. My career and interests just happen to be more lenient than Astoria's demanding and Portkey-setting lifestyle. I see nothing wrong with taking my own son away from his nurse elves a few times a day, even if it means missing some unimportant or redundant parties."
"Would you like to come through?"
"At least we'll be suffering through it together."
"Oh, Harry," Ginny breathed. He knew that
Malfoy shook his head, a smile on his lips. Then he surprised Harry by asking him, "Are you married as well, too, Potter? I'm afraid I haven't the faintest idea and never thought to ask before. Given your privacy wards, of course."
Harry couldn't help but chuckle. "Kreacher's pretty good at it. And I've told you, Ginny and I want to raise our kids first hand. No elves. Not that there's anything wrong with that," he quickly added for good measure, "but it's just not me."
"Mother!" he huffed, trying in vain to disentangle himself from her affections. "Surely such behavior is unbecoming of a Malfoy!" he chided, the tone of his voice betraying his obvious relief of being reunited with her.
"Actually, I've already said yes," he said, to the shock of his wife. "I sent off my response right after I'd figured it out."
The first thought that Harry had was, how in the fucking hell could she have been photographed? Harry was sure that his
Ginny gave out a little giggle and flipped her hair. "I wanted to surprise all of you, so I requested for an earlier Portkey. Maybe I should've just told you, but well... I kinda missed you and wanted to do something special."
Apollo laid a hand on his shoulder. "Relax, Harry," he tried soothingly. "Let's just trace back our investigation. Pedal back a bit, you know?"
"I see," his mother all but purred behind him as they walked towards the sun room that Narcissa and Astoria seemed to love so much. "And how has your time with Scorpius been?"
"Draco," Harry heard Arthur say politely, which gave him enough motivation to lift his head and find out if he was hallucinating or not.
"I don't know," Potter shrugged. "I guess where I'm from, it's quite a personal experience for parents to name their child."
The air hung heavily when Harry absorbed Draco's calm words. "What?!" he blurted out. "But - but I'd have known when - if he…"
"Ron and I just had a few drinks after work, and we ran into him. This was last year. Turned out the pub was his, so he stayed with us for a bit until the person he had to meet arrived. That was pretty much it."
Draco remembered that day at the Minister's Office, when he had been given his probationary release. Potter hadn't been yet under the
In fact, Draco somewhat missed it.
"What's this all about, Gin? Why are you so upset?"
Sure enough, in a haze of green smoke, from out of the fire came Ginny, eyes bright and blazing and looking expectantly at Harry.
"As for the invitation to apprentice in France, well that was a surprise as well, but something that I immediately approved, given your academic records in Potions and your personal endeavors at Malfoy Manor. I hear your brews are of such high quality and up to the standards of even St. Mungo's."
This time, Malfoy nodded and looked thoughtful. Harry knew that this part of the story was at least familiar to the blond, so he didn't offer any more details.
Harry nodded. "Historically proven, too."
He didn't even have the chance to gasp in furious surprise as a force grabbed him from behind his navel. In the blink of an eye, Draco was gone.
"If it makes you feel any better, Ron and I and every single Auror are supposed to do this. Ironic, isn't it?"
Draco felt something in him snap. "I am not a young boy any more, Mother. I am allowed to grow and change, and I am most definitely not supposed to be under your scrutiny, which, if I may be bold as to say, is completely out of hand."
One of the things about Ginny that Harry appreciated was that she was easy to talk with, even with potentially embarrassing emotional topics such as this. She made it seem so easy. Being with her would definitely be a joy, he was sure.
Stretching his arms above his head, he was suddenly disoriented. Hadn't he fallen asleep in that stiff and stuffy chair? But he was currently laid out on luxurious silk sheets, on a regal four poster, in a room that was no less elegant. To his left, the full length windows had their drapes opened, which explained the sun in his eye and his reason for waking.
This time, Harry saw the first comfortable smile on Malfoy's face, the kind that he remembered seeing that one night at Grimmauld, when the two of them had unwittingly shared some very personal information to each other. Seeing it again was quite endearing, and it warmed Harry right up.
"Six weeks," she answered tentatively, trying to gauge his reaction.
It was about an hour later, when Hermione was with Teddy in his bedroom, Harry was in the middle of a heated discussion with Ron and Malfoy about the Pince case. All three men were startled from their serious conversation when the Floo suddenly roared to life, spitting out emerald embers in front of the hearth.
Perhaps it was part of the
Harry groaned in irritation. This meeting was not at all going as planned. All the blond had to say was yes. "One," he said somewhat forcefully than intended while counting out with his fingers. "you are right here next to me and that is close enough. Two," he continued, waving two fingers in front of Malfoy's face, "I care about you and I think the same goes the other way around. Three," and this time he poked his three fingers into Malfoys chest. "Three, not even your stubbornness will prevent me from doing so. I want to protect you and I will."
Harry didn't even bother himself as she hurried out the bedroom. He just closed his eyes and counted to a hundred. He never even knew what number he was on when she had gone. He was deep in his head, in his cupboard under the stairs. He just kept counting. And counting. And counting...
"Now, Teddy, what did Granma Andy say about rushing at Cousin Draco while he's holding Scorpius?" Harry asked sternly with his I'm-a-father voice.
Ginny stood up, shoulders still obviously shaking. She moved slowly towards one of the windows overlooking the street. "I know," she said softly, meekly. "That's why I'd already made up my mind before I even came here."
"Of course," Harry replied, smiling. "Teddy's your cousin, so that's not a problem at all. As for James, I'm sure he'd love having another reckless man to look up to as a role model."
"Yes, Potter, your visually graceful mastery of limbs really adds to my telepathic comprehension of your unspoken thoughts."
"Have the two of you discussed the matter yet?" Narcissa asked sweetly, acting as if she hadn't been asking that repeatedly for the last weeks. Draco rolled his eyes, but Astoria surprised him by answering her mother-in-law bluntly, but as politely as she could.
Harry was thoroughly enjoying himself. Ron almost always fell asleep through the first twenty minutes, while Hermione just didn't find the movies as interesting, preferring factual or intellectual types instead.
Draco wordlessly took the china from the brunet while trying to remember as much as he could from the previous night. As he closed his eyes, he could feel the stirrings of a mounting migraine, no doubt the result of his inebriation. When he gave an involuntary flinch at the pain in his temple, he heard Potter chuckle behind him though he couldn't see him.
Also, Harry made all sorts of reasons just so he didn't have to acknowledge that he liked Malfoy telling him what to do and how to do things. Because it wasn't true. Not at all.
"Wanker."
Ron looked utterly gobsmacked. Harry felt Confunded. "Did Draco Malfoy just buy us our drinks?"
Harry and Ron laughed and joked with their co-trainees on the way to the showers. They were a pretty solid bunch, being the first class to take on the Auror training straight after the war. They all shared the burgeoning need to do something, to make the wizarding world a better place to live in. After all, everyone knew that it was after a war that law enforcement was most needed.
Malfoy mockingly rolled his eyes. "If that classified as pretty to both of you, then Merlin help us, you two are obviously lacking in taste".
When Harry was taking too long to answer, Hermione shook her head. "No, no, I'm sure this is just a little bump in the road. I mean, you saw what happened to me and Ron. I'm sure the solution is just beyond our sights..."
Malfoy's lip curled up in amusement. "The Malfoy elves are fully equipped to provide any and every request, no matter how unique or distinguished one's palette is."
"Would it be possible to ask you to kill me now?"
Harry gave a hollow laugh. "You can put your faith in my department, a hundred percent. We've looked into the minds of so many damn criminals that it's become second nature to see things their way. That's why I pushed for the MMI in the first place. I learned from the war that... well, you really do have to keep your enemies closer."
"It's..." she paused, perhaps trying to decide the right word to use. "It's difficult."
"Good morning to you, too," Harry quipped. "You were up early."
After making sure to divert all his calls and mail from his flat to Grimmauld Place, he settled James' bassinet in his room (he adamantly refused to keep him in a separate bedroom while he slept) and carried his son to the drawing room, where a cheery fire had been stoked by Kreacher. For the first time in a while, Harry felt relaxed and calm. He knew that Hermione would probably berate him for having Kreacher serve him again, but at that moment he couldn't care less. It was just him and his son, and he needed all the help he could get without bringing any more people into his business.
Luckily his subordinates were supportive of the idea that both Head and Deputy Head were such loving family men, and eagerly volunteered for enough work load to give Harry and Ron enough time to concentrate on their private lives. This was highly appreciated, of course, especially since Harry had both Teddy and James to take care of that week, since Ginny had gone back on her regular training schedule on James' eighth month. She made it a point to come home every night instead of just the weekend, as it was the best compromise she and Harry had agreed on. Thankfully, Molly and Andromeda were always ready to help during those weekd when Harry still had to go to work during the day.
"We're having a baby."
He had been taking care of a follow-up case in his study that time, so he was sufficiently distracted from Ginny and James. Despite the Eilert case being closed, there were several more related cases that needed to be looked into. While this wasn't the responsibility of the MMI, Auror Stone of the DMLE had personally asked Harry's department to help them create mind maps for the victims of the Eilert operation. Since the now-illegal trade and distribution of Persephone's Poison was reported to the public, previously unsolved cases were now cropping up. The most common report involved some witch or wizard who made official reports to the Aurors that a friend or relative might have been a victim of the Eilert potion. Since more than two thirds of these complaints were proven to be people who merely couldn't get over someone getting married to a person they didn't approve, the Aurors needed updated profiles from Harry's team so that they could instantly distinguish whether the accused persons fit the mind map of a victim under Persephone's Poison.
Hermione nodded. "It must be very hard for you, Har," she said, "but I think you've been doing well with the arrangement. I mean, Ginny's told me how difficult it's been since you had Jamie, and how she's been pushing herself to come home as soon as she can and spend as much time with both of you when she can."
"You're good at this, Potter."
Draco smirked. His best friend had been the subject of a scandal years ago when she had inexplicably fallen hard for the Quidditch hero, Oliver Wood, who was a half-blood but known to favor the more muggle conventions of marriage and family. From what Draco had observed, she was still quite happy and enamoured of her husband until now. Despite their typical pureblood contractual marriage, their partnership was largely dependent on compromise. Perhaps they didn't have too many drastic changes - He knew it was largely because of Wood's insistence that they be more involved with the kids, and Pansy would usually humor him. They still brought up their children in much the same way as expected of purebloods, with nurse elves and limited emotional involvement - but there was a touch of warmth and affection that showed through the couple and their children whenever Draco came by to visit.
What surprised him was the easy civility that they now had between them. Sure, he probably wouldn't be best mates with them, but the short time he had spent in their booth was proof that they had gotten over the worst years of their lives.
Draco shook his head minutely, but his brow remained furrowed. "No, there's nothing wrong," he said softly. "Actually... my tea is exactly how I take it. But how-"
… You just believed you'd bumped into some random stranger and let it go. Just like
Harry was settled on the floor, reading through several policy manuals that trainees were supposed to learn by heart. He sorely missed having Hermione's neat handwriting annotating his notes, and Ron's shameless scrawls, doodles and swearing on his books (Harry's, of course, Ron never did write in his own books).
Harry slumped his head onto the table again, groaning. He was definitely not looking forward to that family meeting.
Hermione nodded in agreement. Ron laughed hollowly. "Good luck with that, mate," he said in sympathy.
"We trust you, Helen," Ginny said.
Ron picked up on Harry's misery, and suddenly understood that this night was just as much for Harry as it was for him. "Er, got problems, too, mate?"
"Molly, please," he said gently, "the Healers will figure out what's wrong with her. No need to fret, now."
"I've still got a copy of the files we haven't sent down to Archives," the redhead suggested. "That's really all we can work on. I mean, what were the
"You're sure you don't have any idea who might have motive to threaten you?"
"What are you doing!" Astoria cried, sounding panicked, grabbing Gerard's arm. "We agreed not to incriminate ourselves by harming him!"
Hermione stopped what she was doing to look at him, giving him all her attention. "In a way, you remind me of Harry." At the look of incredulity on Draco's face, she laughed softly. "He's got quite a family history, though it's not really for me to share, but... well, he never had parents, and he never really had a father figure to guide him. He had the same fears as you, but look at him now. He loves being a dad, and it comes to him naturally, as I'm sure it will do for you," Hermione said with a note of conviction, busying herself with pouring him another cup.
He moved over to where James was and pulled him into his arms, bringing him back with him to the sofa. "This tyke here, almost drove me and his mum up the wall one time because he wanted to have a dragon. It was the stupidest tantrum ever."
Harry felt warmed by his words, and was a little embarrassed about it. "Thanks, Percy."
"You'll have bad days, too," Potter's voice suddenly called his attention. "When they just won't shut up and you'll probably slip the occasional swearword in between while you contemplate why you had ever decided that you wanted kids. Then you realize that it's all worth it anyway."
Hermione laughed evilly. They all knew what it meant to be in front of Molly's wand. They all knew what it did to a certain Bellatrix Lestrange, after all.
Potter quirked an eyebrow in mildly disguised interest, a reaction that Draco had been aiming for. "You - you were really calm and level-headed?"
Narcissa was still eyeing him dubiously.
"Fuck you."
"Anything else?" Harry repeated, ignoring his comment completely.
"She's preggers, my wise friend," Pansy drawled. "It's not the easiest thing in the world, you know? It turns angelic little girls into the Devil, I tell you. And I speak from experience."
It seemed as if Narcissa needed more time to process her son's words, unexpected as they were. She sniffed. "I must say, I am quite shocked at your sudden insistence, given the awful experience with Daphne. I've even begun a new list of young socialites whose personalities seem to suit yours more. Apparently there is no longer need for me to continue the search. Although," she paused, causing Draco to look up at her inquisitive tone. "May I ask how your uncharacteristically rash decision came to be?"
Draco raised his eyebrow, but settled in one of the chairs near his wife, prepared to focus on the most recent issue of
"Well, there you are. Congratulations, Mr. Malfoy, you are now a free wizard."
"Yes, we'd sort of established that a while back," Harry said with a slight smirk. Malfoy glared at him, though, so he schooled his expression into what he hoped was a serious one.
"You don't know the half of it -"
When Draco had Flooed on the Monday right after their night out, he wasted no time in telling Potter, Weasley and Macmillan that the most common traits of the botanical ingredients had been the manipulation of the mind and heart, they were quick to conclude that Hal Pince had been a possible victim of the potion. His mind, heart and soul were wholly devoted to protecting the Eilert family despite whatever harm he may have befallen while doing so. It was no wonder that the MMI could find nothing incriminating in his mind or his actions. Potter was correct in assuming that Pince was merely a pawn who held no real value to the masterminds, but had turned out to be the key to unraveling the mystery.
"You alright?" Harry asked Ron when they reached the more private space. The redhead shook his head.
"Dracooooooooooo!" A multicolored blur crashed into Malfoy's legs and Harry had to hold Teddy back a little so that Malfoy wouldn't lose balance.
Though it felt like forever, the Naming had actually only taken a quarter of an hour, with the rest of the time spent caring for baby Scorpius.
"Stupid higher-ups," Draco heard Weasley mutter under his breath.
"May I bring Scorpius along with me?"
Malfoy cocked his head to one side. "Alright. You're… er... you're good?"
"We can call up other blood wards. Not just the Malfoy ones."
The elder Weasley took a deep breath as if to steady himself. "We think it best that you hear from Healer Rosewood."
"We'll figure it out when we're there," Harry said shortly, not wanting to imagine any more reasons to have to spend extra time with Malfoy, whether in public or in private.
The tension in their conversation melted away completely. Harry grinned. "I've already stuck with him for nearly 8 years. What's another hundred years?"
"I told you already, there's no need to thank me," the blond said, somewhat impatiently. "And your coffee's obviously done. Any plans on heading back soon?"
His kidnapper took the last few steps until his face was finally revealed from the shadows. He had a hard look about him, features stony and roughly hewn, expression gritty and menacing. He meant nothing good. Draco at least was smart enough to admit the fact, and his last hope was to somehow stall whatever the man's plans were until help came.
"Oh, yeah, sorry," Harry said, "it's an electric fireplace, so I'll have to switch it out with magic and then have the Floo Network connect me."
"Er.. that's good," he finally replied. "Um, thanks, I guess. It's my job though, plus Ron and I would never let anything bad happen to you."
"If you need something," Narcissa admonished, "I would appreciate you keeping my expensive clothing out of it."
"Ah," Draco nodded noncommittally, understanding that this made his ex nemesis unsure of what to say. "Yes, that sounds just about right, that man was never in the heat of things, the useless bastard, but he did have the occasional exposure to actual relevant information. How very fitting for a man who was, quite literally, a rat." He was trying to make it sound off handed and casual for the sake of Potter, and it seemed to have worked a little, as the Auror's lip twitched as if he were trying not to smirk.
"I apologize, miss," Draco said immediately, not realizing that he had put her on the defensive. "Not many people have interest in such books, and I was just a tad surprised. You do not look like someone who would even look at a Potions manual, let alone be interested in purchasing it."
Harry shook his head. "She needs about a day or two to get approval for an international Floo call. I expect she'll get in touch by tomorrow morning."
of them.
"The Malfoy wards will protect him," Ron pointed out. "His family will be safe behind those. But he still comes out to the Ministry when he's consulted. I guess we can convince him to limit his visits to just the Ministry, so that the wards on the complex will at least be substantial protection from external threats."
The new Mrs. Malfoy was adamant on making their relationship very accessible to the public, and she may be somewhat credited with bringing Draco Malfoy into the spotlight after his low-key life post-war. During their courtship, we were all whisked on their romantic adventure around Europe, and we were privy to the littlest details of their lives. Throughout their long engagement, we observed the support they had for each other, as they pursued their respective ambitions. Now considered one of the most photographed witches in modern times, Astoria Malfoy has made it clear that she has her sights set on Continental Europe and wishes to establish better international relations with foreign societies in order to broaden the presence of the British community beyond our borders. She has already been successful in organizing the most ambitiously far-reaching galas the country has ever known, earning herself attention not only here but also abroad. Of course, her successes are nothing compared to those of her husband's.
"Nothing is wrong with that, my dragon," Narcissa whispered. "I do not take sides in this, for I am still the descendant of an old and powerful family. I was raised with the same expectations, but I admittedly had my own... misgivings about some of them. I understand Astoria's frustrations - you two have entered a magically binding contract, and must therefore forge into the future with these mutual goals in mind. Both of your ambitions depend heavily on your public persona, and it would do you well to remember that.
Draco gave a little laugh. "You are the worst parenting advisor."
"Alright?" he asked tentatively.
The man merely cocked his head to the side as if trying to decide how to carefully say what was already on the tip of his tongue. Harry waited patiently, but when Malfoy said nothing, he decided to confront the awkward issue.
This time, it was Harry's turn to sigh. "Just shut it, alright? You, Malfoy, you are worth it."
He had opened up his Floo access to the trio a few months back since it was a much easier way for them to communicate, but this was the first time that a house elf had popped him immediately to the fire to answer, saying that a Mrs. Weasley had insisted it was an urgent call. He could almost feel every single Malfoy ancestor shiver in their graves, which made him greet Hermione even more warmly that he would initially have.
Draco took a deep breath. He couldn't believe she had taken this for granted. No wonder she and Weasley had had problems. "Magic is highly dependent on the well-being of one's mind, body and soul," he explained. "That's why it is very difficult to use magic when under pressure, and only the more powerful or well-practiced wizards are able to do so. It's also how Dementors make it hard for anyone to use magic - they cause severe depression and anxiety, weakening the mind and soul without having to harm the physical body. Yes, I'm aware that the concept is very abstract," he said pointedly, "but what we currently know of magic is that it is a direct reflection of one's being. What happened to you... Merlin, it's a good thing Potter took notice! When a witch or wizard is under constant stress and anxiety, it causes their magic to fluctuate dangerously, and possibly even weaken beyond repair!"
"Hello, Teddy," Draco greeted warmly, letting the little boy hug him around the legs. "You just keep on growing and growing, don't you?"
Harry nodded, expression somber. "We have to be careful and keep it professional. I don't want to be taken out of this case just when it's hit so close to home."
"Yes, I believe so," Malfoy answered slowly. "Come to think of it, they did fight an awful lot whenever Mother did something nice for me..."
"You never stopped being part of us, Gin," Harry said, now moving to hold her closer. She let him pull her into his embrace, and Harry felt like something inside him clicked back into place.
When they had finally ended the call, Ron turned toward Harry. "It doesn't make sense. How in the hell could our mystery person have gotten access into the wards if they needed to be invited in? Lucius is out, and Malfoy, Astoria and Narcissa are the ones under threat. It can't have been the elves, they're bound by ancient magic...and an ancient set of wards like that... how?"
Ron had agreed and applied immediately. Harry, on the other hand, had been torn with his decision for a while. He had realized that without the special privilege, he would have to wait another three years to become a full Auror instead of just one year. He wanted, no, needed to be out there, fighting Dark Wizards and helping those in need. He couldn't stand waiting even a few extra years if it meant being useless.
"Go on then," said Ron, leaning back and rubbing over his middle. "Tell us all about how Harry caused mayhem in the Ministry yet again."
When he waved the call in, he was surprised to see Hermione's head in the green flames. "Everything alright, Mione?" he asked. His friends usually respected his requests for privacy, so he knew that this call was rather important.
"Harry?" Ginny's voice carried through the hallway and into Harry's study. The sound made James stir from inside his bassinet, and Harry called out, "in here!"
"Are you telling me," he said in a low voice, filled with trepidation, "you cooked meals for your family, before you were eleven?" It didn't fit with what Draco knew of Potter. He, along with the rest of the wizarding world, was aware that he had been raised by Muggles, and that they were not particularly close. But to hear something like that...
Something changed in the expression on the Potioneer's face, which Harry noted immediately.
"Well? What do you think?" he asked.
The late afternoon sun touched upon the edge of Harry's desk, forcing him to squint at the glowing curtains in frustration. He hadn't even realized until then that he had wasted away all of the daylight hours with his head bowed down, shuffling through piles of paper for his latest case.
Potter also got his closure; the brothers explained, under Veritaserum and out of fear of the Aurors, that they had used the secret weapon of their forebears to provide a highly controversial service to families who like the Eilerts, wanted to take only specified individuals, even against their will, into marriage. The only common factor among all the deceased victims was that they were previously engaged to someone who was desired by one of the Eilerts' clients. This service had been going on for years, but the carelessness of Hal Pince had proven to be their downfall. The deaths were supposed to look like accidents or suicides, but Pince had apparently failed at that - he had used the potion on the victims but had simply messed up the dosage. Such a simple oversight had taken down a long-standing serial murder case, which once again had proven Harry's claims over the MMI's success rate. Later, he had taken great care in recording every corner of their minds and memories to add to the official reports. Before any of them knew it, the case was brought before the Wizengamot, and finally closed. With both Eilerts, as well as their conspirators (quickly hunted down) taken into Azkaban, and all records and ingredients of the potion confiscated, the MMI were given a commendation by the Minister for Magic himself, and Draco given a special recommendation within the Department of Mysteries.
"Grounded... figuratively? Like in Muggle terms?" Hermione asked.
"I - I just -" Ginny's eyes suddenly filled with tears. "I just found out the other day, Harry! It's true, but I didn't mean for it come out before you even found out! I don't know how -"
He led her to a door off to the right, which led to a stairway. The couple went up the steps to reach another door at the landing. Ginny frowned at Harry, but he just motioned for her to open the door. The sight that greeted her took her breath away.
, Draco thought to himself.
"Got a lot on your mind?" Ginny inquired, digging into her shepherd's pie (which Harry insisted was subpar compared to his own recipe. Ginny couldn't really tell the difference, both were alright). "You seem to be a bit... off."
Draco nodded. "It becomes extremely dangerous for childbirth, because the mother's magic is supporting two individuals. The slightest fluctuation would have caused irreparable damage at the very least. Potter was wise to point it out, even though he probably didn't realize the severity, either."
"Oh," was all Draco said. Harry imagined the gears in his head as the blond made calculations and predictions in his head until it was obvious the decision had been made. "Alright, I'd love to stay."
Ron's face was completely crimson, and it clashed horribly with his sweat-soaked hair. Of course, Harry didn't look any better, his jet black mop plastered to his forehead and dripping with perspiration.
Not that they mattered to Harry, either. He just noticed these things, that was all.
Thankfully, Malfoy had finally translated the previous translations he had made, and the team was now much more productive in tracing the various shipments of botanical ingredients from Sweden into Britain. Now, Harry and Ron were cross referencing the list of apothecaries that had recently stocked and sold corresponding proportions found in the recipe. Just that small amount of information meant that the list was now narrowed down to six proprietary shops located around London, which was where most of the murders had taken place. The 7 victims had nothing in common as far as the Aurors could tell, except for the fact that they were dead. Harry, therefore, was placing all his hope on Malfoy figuring out what the potion was for in order to better understand what the Dark Wizards were after.
Narcissa paced slowly in front of them. Her expression as cold as the marble under her feet, though Draco was sure that there was a blazing inferno underneath the ice.
"Just another month," he heard Ginny whisper from behind Hermione. "Then we'll be alright."
serve your
There was a bit of an awkward moment then. Harry was aware that Malfoy and Ginny had always been right on the edge of polite for the most part, but their relationship was even less than an acquaintance and more of a reluctant tolerance for each other's presence. Thankfully, a shriek from the hallway told Harry that Hermione had just come out from Teddy's bedroom and seen her sister-in-law. Ginny immediate ran towards her, with Hermione trying her best to waddle into the sitting room.
His mother saw his expression as he sat down opposite her, and she guessed correctly at his thoughts.
"Ron…"
"Your wife has made it a point to complain about you at least once, every time I see her."
"What are you talking about?" Draco eyed them skeptically. "Oh. Oh. Of course." He shook his head in mock pity.
"How dare you lay your filthy hand on me!" he shouted. "You'll pay for this!"
"Oh, I'd worry more about the other head I've got," Draco smirked.
Harry bit his lip. "No current relatives with a high enough degree of Malfoy blood relation, and no one else was keyed in. So somehow the security failed. Anything higher? Something we can layer over the existing wards?"
Draco avoided his mother's inquisitive stare. "Biggest understatement of the year, that."
Hermione nodded, brow still furrowed. "Okay, but please call me right after, Harry."
Astoria let out a quiet sob, perhaps unaware that she had made any noise at all. Draco smoothed his hand against hers, trying to find a way to alleviate her physical tension.
"After three years of marriage to you, I have yet to develop a tolerance for your unmatched ego." At Draco's smirk, Astoria kissed his cheek, squeezed his arm and they turned on the spot.
Ginevra gave out a very unladylike bark of laughter. "Oh, they'll be in for a treat! Harry's mind will be so complex and convoluted that they'll probably spend days just analyzing his!"
. It was still quite early, but deciding that he was too much awake already, Draco hastily threw on a robe and went down to his study. That was where he spent most of his days anyway, since there really wasn't much for a former Death Eater on probation to do out of his home. In truth, he cherished these moments of quiet since it allowed him to focus on his personal interests without a deranged evil Dark Lord threatening his life every other day. Yes, this was a pleasant change to his daily routine.
Harry leaned back and thought back. So far, they had been able to take turns in watching the kids so they both had enough time to take care of their own responsibilities while also being there for their children. However, this sometimes involved sudden exchanges between Grimmauld Place and the Burrow, where Molly and Arthur now lived again after moving back from France (Ron and Hermione having been given the use of Shell Cottage for their own family.)
When Malfoy nodded sagely, Harry suppressed a chuckle. "Imagine that."
Harry snapped out of his daze, unaware that he had completely zoned out in the middle of the conversation. He quickly apologized to Ginny and went back to eating his chips.
Hermione stared at the wall behind Draco. "Ron and I found out about Hugo. It wasn't really an accident, but it wasn't like we were trying, either. It just happened. Ron, of course, was over the moon. I was...in shock for a while. But I got over it quickly."
"Under strict confidence, Mr. Malfoy, he also provided me with Voldemort's memories as well." Draco looked up at the Minister, confused.
: (flustered) Y-yes Mr. Potter. (rifles through notes) Ms. Granger, our readers also have a lot of questions for you. I'm not sure if you are aware, but a large number of your fans are young women who admire you for being a role model.
Ron read his mind. "Mate, those are the mind maps. The entire intellectual framework of the Auror Corps in that single box."
"But still," Harry said, trying to find words to explain what he thought. "Doesn't it feel... strange? I mean, to be married to someone that you hadn't been close to or- I dunno, it sounds weird that you have to spend the rest of your life together, and you still have to learn to like each other on the way?"
Molly, whom Harry suspected was trying to compensate for the failed relationship between him and Ginny, was helping her only daughter to deal with her unplanned motherhood for the few days a week that they had James and Albus. Ginny could have stayed the whole time at Grimmauld Place, but she insisted on staying with Molly and Arthur when she had the kids, in an attempt to 'give Harry some space'. They then shared the weekends, back at Number Twelve again, unless either of them were called to work on short notice, or the occasional big Weasley Sunday lunch was arranged.
Malfoy seemed at a loss for words. "King's Cross... Afterlife… You
Was this his stalker, then? Draco immediately reviewed everything he, Potter and Weasley had gathered over the last few weeks. If this really was William Howe, he was definitely not what Draco had expected. At all.
Two years. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for waiting patiently, and encouraging me to keep the tale going. Love, Idishi <3
"Harry," the blond said nervously, the green flames adding pallor to his already pale complexion. "Mother just… she…"
"Oh." Harry looked dumbly at Draco, feeling even more so on the inside. He smiled sheepishly. "Sorry, guess I got carried away there…"
"That might take days," Astoria huffed, now seemingly calmer. "But I can talk to the officer in charge of international departure, if you want. My status here should be enough to get us a day or two off from the regular processing period."
"It's a month and a half, Harry, it's-"
"So... nurse elves?"
just going to Obliviate him,  but for now… let's see how much fun we can have with our guest."
Unbidden to his mind, Harry recalled the unfortunate birth of Tom Riddle, whose mother had inexplicably died an hour after delivery. He didn't want that for Ginny or for their child.
Ginny ignored his puppy dog face, and instead pulled him towards the door. Harry held her back, however. "There's one more thing I forgot to show you! One of the deal breakers of this place."
"Malfoy!" he greeted warmly as the blond stepped out gracefully. In his arms, he firmly supported his drooling son.
Narcissa rushed forward to embrace him. "Oh my dragon, I would do anything to protect you. And Scorpius. Yes, it won't be difficult to find a strong enough ward for his safety. I must begin looking…"
rather than saw, the depth of... their understanding? It had certainly felt odd, as if magic was crawling up his spine. In those secret seconds, Draco
"How would he even be exposed to it? The mind map isn't enough to explain when he was ever dosed, or if it was just once or long term…" Harry finally turned to face Ron, who was slumped in his own chair looking dejected. Never before had they had a case so near to themselves.
Draco was beginning to understand what she meant, though the entire concept of DNA and - what did she call it? - Genetics. "So what you're saying is, you hope to find a pattern in the Black family bloodline?"
"Distracting me was not a fair play."
"You take care of that," Harry said. "I'll just stay home, thanks."
"Yes, I would," she said, laughing at his reaction. "And relax, Harry, that won't be in a few more years, so we'll have time to iron out the details then."
With a pang, Harry realized that this would be the closest he would have to having a brother. "That's right, Ted," he said, his voice a little tight. "You're gonna be the best big brother! We'll have so much fun tomorrow. Sleep tight!" He kissed him on the forehead, then left the room, casting the usual monitoring and protecting wards on the door.
Resignedly, he walked out and headed to the west wing conservatory, where he knew Astoria was currently reading. He would have to confirm with her and deal with the situation his mother had singlehandedly dealt them. Two weeks in the south of France might sound like the perfect holiday for other busy wizards, but he knew better. Endless fancy parties and hands to shake and people to impress were just a small part of the itinerary.
"So," Weasley was saying, "the only actual suspect we've got in custody is Hal Pince, but unlike the ones we've apprehended in the past, he'd had a mental failsafe in the form of a custom-cast Memory Charm placed on him in advance. The Obliviators still haven't been able to conclude if it was a modified Obliviate, or something new and unheard of."
"There we go," Draco said easily, to Potter's confused face. "I was merely checking if the old you was still alive in there somewhere. You were making a good impression of a flobberworm that I feared I had lost you for a moment. Don't disappoint me, Potter."
So it was, that after the five minutes that had passed following his arrival at the Manor, Draco found himself less joyful, all thoughts of Potter and" James gone, with only the single intention of proving to his mother that there was nothing wrong with him and Astoria. With a determined look on his face, he excused himself and headed straight for his wife.
"Somewhat. Wizarding families only became smaller at the onset of Pureblood hysteria in the Middle Ages. Marriages at the time were highly scrutinized and so were the births. Parents avoided inheritance conflicts by limiting their heirs and keeping the lines 'unified'. Somehow though, the later generations paid for it. Something changed in the magical capacity to conceive." His face took on a bitter expression. "You might notice, there's only one Parkinson, one Goyle, one Zabini, and so on. The luckier ones are the Notts and Greengrasses. My mother's family also had a lucky generation - she had two sisters, and they had several cousins among the Blacks. The line died out, though. The Malfoy family has only ever had one heir for the last six centuries.
Malfoy seemed to think on it, but then shook his head. "No, sorry. This was all quite sudden and unexpected."
"There is an ancient law, I have learned, that can and will allow me to enjoy my privacy again, to live my life freely without worry of being caught unawares by reporters; without being closely scrutinized by people I don't even know. I think, after all I have personally been through in the last eighteen years, that I at least deserve this without having to fight for it. I therefore plan to formally invoke the ancient right to
Draco raised an eyebrow. Had Potter moved? And why did the address sound faintly familiar? He ignored the burning curiosity, and waited for the Floo call to be connected. At last, there was a roar, and he could clearly see the image of a dark drawing room, with Potter sitting on the couch as if expecting a call at that very moment. He looked confused. It took a couple of seconds until Potter found his voice.
When Potter began testifying for Draco, that was when his brain almost imploded. Here was his greatest enemy, in the perfect position to ensure Draco's downfall, and of course he had to act the bloody Savior! They never once made eye contact, nor did Potter even acknowledge that he was there in the same room. But the words he said with so much conviction... about how he knew Draco so intimately from their schoolyard spats, how he had seen through his taunts and eventually realized the danger he was in when Voldemort had returned... and how Potter had been in the Astronomy Tower with Dumbledore.
Ginny wiped away the tear tracks on Harry's cheek. "I love you," she whispered, voice still weak but eyes full of fierce joy. "Now say hello to our son."
Draco thought for a while, and then the answer was clear in his head. He knew what to do, and where to go.
From the other side of the room, Narcissa lay down a sleeping Scorpius. Her own brow was marked with worry, and it was with immense self-control, Draco knew, that his mother could keep her face as calm as it seemed. Astoria sat close to their son, hands clutching subconsciously on her silk robes.
Hermione sputtered, while Ron's eyes widened somewhat comically. "You let her go?! Just like that?" he exclaimed.
In no time, the burly man appeared in the green flames. "What's up?" he asked casually.
: And how does that help, exactly?
She had hit the nerve. "I...I'm afraid of not being able to… It's not like I had a perfectly good role model growing up." There, he said it.
Draco looked at him, surprised. He knew about Ginevra, and assumed the same for Weasley and Hermione too, would be obvious recipients of the benefits of
"Are you sure?"
As he settled himself into bed, his last thoughts were still on his former nemesis. He knew Malfoy was one of the sharpest wizards he knew, and he hoped that the wards on James would work on him as effectively as it had on everyone else. In any case, the attention he had given Harry's arms was possibly because he was already quite perceptive, even when he wasn't trying.
The meeting goes on for a bit longer, with the only truly intriguing news revealed when Voldemort discusses the prophecy that had led to his decision to kill Harry. Severus files the information away for further thought. He leaves when the other Death Eaters leave.
He thinks he knows the answer already, but he doesn’t want to think about what it would mean. About how much of the responsibility he has for this boy’s continued suffering.
After a particularly unsettling nightmare in which Harry had once again been Lord Voldemort, he’s had enough. He just won’t allow himself to sleep again until he figures out how to get rid of these terrible dreams. And as seems to be a pattern in his life this summer, there’s only one person to go to for that.
“And you weren’t eliminated from the journal competition as early as you led everyone to believe last year?”
Harry looks at Ron and Hermione inquisitively. “Have you heard about this before?”
He cuts her off. “Ron doesn’t want to talk to me, I know. And if he does want to talk to me, he can do that himself.”
Will Ron and Hermione's reconciliation with Harry last? Will Harry decipher the golden egg's hidden message? How will things between Harry and Draco continue to develop? Will Harry or Snape guess the other's identity soon? Find out next time in Chapter Five: The Oh-So-Intimidating Professor!
Wearlily: “sigh” you have been watching too many movies.
He sits in the Champions’ tent while the others face their dragons. Fleur, Cedric, and Viktor leave him one by one. He hears the crowd roar in support for each of them until there’s only Harry left to walk out. Screams from the crowds are the only things he hears as he waits.
Harry chuckles at how basic smalltalk has suddenly become so useful, and then he pauses for a moment.
“Have a good day then!” Neville Longbottom says with a smile and a wave,
Harry and Draco both roll their eyes at each other after she leaves.
“Kreacher!” Harry yells, jumping to his feet.
The numbness Harry had been feeling earlier returns, stronger than ever. He worries that he might forget how to breathe as the numbness seeps into his throat and slowly chokes him.
Draco had been watching Potter attempt to fight the Hungarian Horntail, and his expression could not be called anything short of
But of course, that’s when Ron and Fleur stumble through the door. Ron runs right into Harry, knocking him away from Draco. “Oh, hey Harry!” he exclaims.
After reading that message from Draco, Harry takes a few minutes to just reread it again and again. Even though he knows that Draco didn’t mean for it to be romantic, Harry can’t stop the blood from rushing to his face. He never in a million years would have guessed that he’d be this desperate for
” The spell hits the Horntail’s chest harmlessly and seems to make the dragon even angrier. Its teeth are easily visible as it lets out another snarl.
Harry tries to focus on simple tasks like reviewing his Hogwarts supplies list to see what he needs to buy before the summer ends. But he’s never able to reach the end of it before he inevitably reaches for his journal to see if Snape has replied.
“So he had you

Wearylily: fine *fingers crossed*

Bestfriend: YEAHHHHH
With a heavy sigh, Harry runs a hand through his messy hair in frustration and flips open his journal with the other. His partner’s last answer and question awaits him:
Last time: The Champions participated in the second task and Draco devised a plan to figure out the identity of his mysterious journal pen pal.
“Sirius,” he breathes as he closes the distance between them.
Rita Skeeter won’t leave him alone, and it seems like she twists everything he says into merely a semblance of the truth. For example, he said, “I forgot about the spell until the dragon was about to scorch me!”
The adults quiet for a moment. They all nod resignedly and mumble their consent to allowing Harry to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. If Fleur hadn’t chosen that moment to squeeze Harry’s hand gently, he thinks he might’ve either passed out or fled from the room.
confronting him about it. I find it hard to believe that the sympathetic boy we’ve come to know could possible be the spoiled brat Potter.
Last time, the students of Durmstrang and Beauxbatons arrived at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament, Harry learned about a concurrent competition that involves guessing the identity of someone you talk to through a journal, Harry guessed his first journal partner correctly, Draco framed Harry for creating a pathetic note, and Harry's name was drawn from the Goblet of Fire.
Hermione plasters a smile on her face as she turns to face him. Inwardly, she vows to investigate Malfoy and figure out what’s going on. Harry might not trust her, but he certainly shouldn’t be trusting that
“The boy claims that he’s been doing all his chores ever since he got back!” she laughs.
“Draco,” Harry replies, seemingly uncertain about what to expect.
As Harry starts to leave the Great Hall with his friends, he’s stopped by a hand on his shoulder. “Harry,” says Dumbledore gently.
!” he hisses. “Do you wish to make fools of yourselves, and the entire Slytherin House by association, at the upcoming Yule Ball?”
For a while, they don’t speak. They just sit on the little hill where Draco used to sit with Cedric. The vibrant hues of orange clash, fade into, and reflect over the lake. Draco watches them battle for so long that he’s almost forgotten he’s not alone this evening.

Harry interrupts him abruptly. “Let me guess! More research?”

Harry leans over to Ron and murmurs, “Who’s the really upset-looking one?”
“Excellent, Draco! I suppose it’s time for you to officially meet the other Death Eaters, then.”

, why did you go along with Ron?” Harry feels his eyes begin to water as he turns his gaze back to her once more.
While Draco was distracted by his paralyzing thoughts, Harry had taken the initiative to further things along. Suddenly, he’s brought Draco’s lips to meet his, and they’re
When he looks back at Harry, the young wizard is no longer alone. There are three other boys standing near him, all much bigger and tougher looking than him. Remus notices Sirius tense beside him, so he puts a hand on his shoulder, reminding him that their place is merely to observe for now.
The three headmasters, plus the Minister for Magic, then stride into the room mid-argument. “Dumbledore, this simply isn’t possible! You can’t let him compete!” hisses Fudge.
to see if, just possibly, someone overlooked that little loophole. But of course, it doesn’t work.
Harry thinks to himself glumly.
. He silently casts a corporeal Patronus to distract the Horntail. As the stag races to the mother dragon, he tries to stealthily sprint to the nest behind her.
Draco gasps as he feels some of his strength drain away rapidly.
“Yes, Master?” inquires the grouchy house elf from immediately behind Harry.
So he writes back,
“We haven’t seen him.”

That evening, the Great Hall buzzed in anticipation of the announcement of the Triwizard Tournament Champions. Harry, however, was not as excited for the event as he had been that morning. News of Malfoy’s note had spread around the school like wildfire, and everyone seemed to believe Snape’s accusation that Harry had written it himself. Everyone shook their heads pityingly and whispered to each other when they saw him. Whispered had followed Harry ever since he first stepped foot inside Hogwarts, but these felt different. These whispers seemed to crawl under his skin and take residence inside him, multiplying beyond measure until the only thoughts he had left were just as pathetic as everyone thought he was.
Draco doesn’t say anything immediately. But then he ruminates aloud, “So you’re plotting against the Dark Lord?”
Cheers greet him as he enters the arena where the Hungarian Horntail awaits. Despite having seen a miniature representation of the dragon only an hour or so ago, Harry still feels his stomach plummet as he gazes at the real beast: it’s about fifty feet long with menacing amber eyes, large spines protruding from its back all the way down to the sharp tip of its tail, and sharp black scales covering its entire body like armor. Thankfully, it’s chained up. But Harry realizes that after he takes a few steps closer to it, it could easily reach him with its tail, and its fire could reach him anywhere in the arena. And of course, the nest with the golden egg is right next to the dragon. So he’s going to have to go over there at some point in order to complete this deadly task. At least,
The day after the Yule Ball, Harry finds himself beginning to panic about the second task. He still hasn’t figured out what it is, and if Draco’s idea about trying to open the egg underwater doesn’t work, then Harry doesn’t know

Later that night, after celebrating his performance in the first task with his fellow Gryffindors and hearing the shrill screeching sounds released by the golden egg when he opened it, Harry finds himself holding his journal. It had been a little while since he’d last opened it.
“His eye injury was from a potions accident, like I thought.”
Then Draco squeezes Harry’s shoulder, grabbing his attention. “It’s true, Harry. You have more practical dueling experience than anyone at this school. And that’s what you wish Defense Against the Dark Arts would teach, right? So why wait for Umbitch to teach what
He had clearly been waiting for her last name, so Hermione had stammered out, “Granger!” Hopefully she sounded smoother than she suspected she did…

“Draco,” Voldemort purrs, turning to face him now. “How marvelous that you resemble your father so closely. To what do I owe the
Harry forces himself to pay attention as Dumbledore picks names from the Goblet. Fleur from Beauxbatons. Ron claps profoundly for her, and Harry tries to join him, though he does so half-heartedly. Viktor from Durmstrang. Both Ron and Hermione cheer. Harry barely maintains a smile. Cedric the Hufflepuff from Hogwarts. Harry hardly hears the name. But then… the Goblet flashes blue again and sends out another name. Harry’s daze is shattered when Dumbledore calls out, “Harry Potter!”
These interactions were written by my best friend XD
Wearylily: I visited Tom Riddle’s grave
“Good,” he says slowly, while backing away from them. “I shall see you in detention if you change your minds.” Severus then makes it clear that he’s addressing the entire group now by sweeping out an arm to gesture to everyone. “Now, I would like to see those of you who are experienced dancers pair up with those who are not.

wards covered her privacy. While showing photos of either of them was no longer illegal, he had assumed that with his strict bindings, no one would have been able to notice her or photograph her in such circumstances. She could make herself be noticed when she wanted, but seeing the look on her face in the photo, Harry could tell that it was a candid shot, and this puzzled him.
"Well, what?"
"Yes, well, I've figured out that majority of the items are categorized under botanical ingredients, which have a short life span. You can't use botanical ingredients unless they're fresh, which means that if we figure out what the items are precisely, you'll be able to track down any recent transactions for them."
Draco turned serious again. "How are things with Ginevra?"
"I heard things did not go well with Daphne."
"You wanted to talk?" he asked somewhat dumbly, not exactly sure how to react to Malfoy's somewhat childish behavior.
"This is really good," Ginny mumbled around her roast beef sandwich. Harry thought it was funny that she could be so informal with table manners, quite like Ron, actually.
Draco recalled how he and his mother were shocked that they were given a private trial, saving them much embarrassment and making it easier in the long run to rejoin society without much shame.
Harry laughed even harder at the memory of him knocking on Draco's Floo in the middle of the night a couple of months ago, drunk and beyond reason, just to rant violently about a row he'd had with Ron and Hermione. Sure, they were his best friends, but Draco definitely got an earful of colorfully descriptive adjectives in the process. That he didn't repeat a single insult to either Ron or Hermione when they made up meant more to Harry than anything.
"Da-aah! Wah - muh muh - ah! Daaaa!"
"I am thankful for my recent realizations," Draco admitted. "Spending time with, er, less traditional individuals, has opened my eyes to issues which I might have missed or deemed insignificant had I continued to blindly follow the rigid pureblood ways.
." He took a scroll of official-looking parchments from the podium and began to read out. "Mr. Harry James Potter, of sound mind, body and core, has presented his request to the assembled representatives of the Wizengamot. How does the Assembly elect to respond?"
"Yes, I already knew that," Malfoy gave him a patented smirk. "Goodnight then, Potter." The call faded.
"How would you know?" she harrumphed.
Draco looked at him oddly, but the look vanished and Harry figured that he'd imagined it.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You keep my secrets, I keep yours," he said, eyes twinkling. "The ultimate Potter and Malfoy conspiracy, and no one would be the wiser."
"I didn't realize..." she murmured, more to herself. Then she looked up at him. "Harry told me that I was putting up my own obstacles, making out to myself that things were more difficult than they were, just so I could push myself further... I never really thought it was possibly as dangerous as you just told me now..."
Something must have shown in his expression, because Harry immediately looked flustered. "You probably had really grand birthday parties or whatever when you were younger, so you wouldn't get it. But I never really got to celebrate mine, not until I got to Hogwarts, so it isn't really a 'thing' for me, alright? Not a big deal or anything. I seriously just forget about it now."
"I'm also just perceptive," she replied while waving her wand to do up the dishes in the sink.
Potter let out another shaky breath and tried to lean back into his seat. He suddenly turned to face Draco with an expectant, almost hungry look in his eye. He said nothing, but the gesture made something inside Draco melt. There were no words, but it was clear as Veritaserum that Potter was looking for reassurance from him.
"You're in no position to demand anything," said the man ominously as he moved closer.
Narcissa's expression closed off for a second, then warmed again, She really did have quite a warm relationship with Lucius despite being arranged as well. That was up until he had ruined their lives with his mad desire to follow the Dark Lord, but Narcissa was above blaming him for that. Despite denouncing him publicly, she could agree with the desperation he had clung to on the last days of Voldemort's coup. They had gone through that hell together, as husband and wife, both looking out for their son.
"Master's letter does not contain any bad magics," the elf replied. "Special delivery is for when letter can open only for Master and no one else."
"I don't know what expression you mean, Mother."
"I'll alert the team." Harry immediately went into his element. "You stay and keep an eye on the Malfoys, I'll send a team to protect the Manor."
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Is it just me, or do you actually sound terribly glum?"
When Ginny remained quiet as if to formulate her argument, Harry melted into the couch feeling helpless. "What do you even want, Gin?" he asked softly, weakly. He felt defeated. "Be honest. Do you still even want to marry me? Do you want to be with me? Do you want this for the rest of your life?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes at the brunet. "He's doing fine."
"How can you fault us for that, Gin?" he asked, voice still low, standing up again and walking away from her. "It was all a twist of fate, it was all just by chance that Ron and I had gone out with Malfoy, that we had asked him to come over, that Teddy came to stay, that Malfoy met James and that Hermione joined us, and that everyone was having a good time. None of that was expected, but it was expected that you wouldn't be here. Honestly, Ginny, what else do you want me to say? Because I honestly don't want to hurt you by repeating all the old shit that we've alerady talked about before but can't seem to actually figure out. So tell me."
"Relax, Gin," Harry said, thinking to himself that he had to soothe her first before they could tackle the problem with James. "Did you check his nappies?"
"You'll have to tone it down, mate," Ron called out from across the table, laughing. "Looks like your face is about to break!"
"Malfoy, I-" he tried. "It's not-"
Draco accepted gratefully, holding it close and staring at the liquid as if he could divine his future from its depths. He said nothing, but it seemed his face was betraying him a lot today, and Hermione was reading him like a book.
The other half, of course, is rookie Ginny Weasley, whom everyone predicted to be this year's weakest link. Having been recruited to play on the starting seven after only two months in junior training, many fans were doubtful of her skill, claiming instead that her high profile relationship with Harry Potter was the only cause for her immediate acceptance into the team. Granted, that particular accusation was what brought about the sudden rush to bid against the Harpies in the first place. After the great financial losses all around, of course, hers is the name on everyone's lips.
"You can hardly call me Granger anymore, Draco," Hermione said. "And anyway, it's Weasley now."
Well, to Astoria at least. Draco thought he had enjoyed the gala more because he had his little boy to provide ample distraction.
It took a lot of effort for Draco to hold his tongue when her meaning became clear.
"Did you consider 'frantic and anxious and worried about stretchmarks and unimaginable pain' to that idea?"
"You may now commence your interrupted moment of emotional expression," he said quietly to the brunet next to him, who was obviously still trying to wipe away tear tracks, before jabbing an elbow into his friend's chest. "What? You deserve to go crazy considering your fiancée is in the middle of a medical situation. No one can fault you for that."
"Yeah, that's right, the Malfoys had a really,
"I don't know!" Astoria cried, shaking her head. "I don't know, I'm sorry I can't tell you much more. I'm just sure it’s him, I'm sure! Please don't be angry at me!"
Once again, he was waiting in his study for Malfoy's owl. The blond was always out and about, away from any Floo. They had therefore been exhausting their owls with the frequent exchange of letters over the last few weeks, but Harry liked to think that he and Malfoy had the same work ethic. Despite not having any personal links to the case, Malfoy had been nothing but hardworking, and the other Aurors (and even Ron) had begun to admire his determination. Even the resident potioneers had taken to asking him about his experiences in Europe, or his take on several new theories on the Wolfsbane Potion. He had earned the respect of every individual in the Auror Corps, and Harry felt a bit proud of the blond git, though he kept it to himself. He had always scoffed at Malfoy's overzealous vanity, which was usually mentioned at least once a week on the Prophet, but he felt relieved to know that the accomplishments in Potions Mastery were for real, and he, Harry, would be hard pressed to find anyone as good at it than Malfoy. Now he definitely understood why the Department of Mysteries were 'extra protective of their secret consultant - he was worth the trouble.
"Is everything alright?" he asked, concern etched on his face. She couldn't seem to look him in the eye, focusing instead on the window so her back was turned to Harry.
That little thought put a small smile on his face, and he was able to go through the rest of their lunch without further interruptions.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy nodded. "Naturally they had to keep the nature of my consultancy top secret. I can't even begin to tell either of you the incredible things they keep down there.:"
"That means we're kind of cousins, too, Teddy," Malfoy said, his throat tight. Harry once again thought about how surreal this all was.
New chapter! :) Real life got in the way a bit, but I couldn't not write haha. Thanks for the comments, I appreciate it when someone takes the time to read and THEN leave a comment :)
"I have decided as well," she continued, much more quietly this time. Draco remained silent, knowing she would explain anyway. "I hope this does not come as a surprise to you, or even a shock. I hope that you will be able to understand my own choices."
"Sorry, once again our conversation ended up being too serious."
"Why do you seem shocked, Potter?" Malfoy asked, genuinely concerned. Harry looked at him with disbelief.
Harry was instantly wary. He automatically steeled himself, his stomach stuck in a flurry of emotions that cycled between relief, apprehension, excitement, anger, longing and nervousness. Apart from Ron, Hermione, Arthur, Molly and Andromeda., there was only one other person keyed directly into the wards of Grimmauld Place that they could Floo in and out with ease.
"Just you wait," Draco threatened. He could feel the resistance on his appendages give just a tiny bit, which meant there was a chance he could overpower it through sheer force of will. But that was a bit of a challenge, given everything he'd been told.
: And anyway, our schedules will fit quite nicely. I mean, working under Harry's department takes up just as much concentration and time as both her jobs put together, so it's not like we're missing out on something. Maybe when we get kids-
Draco shook his head. "I usually sleep in on Saturday mornings, so it's nothing unusual. I'm sure my wife is still asleep as well. I choose not to work on weekends either, so it's not like I have to force myself to get up."
"Why all this?" he finally said, frown on his face where his Malfoy Mask would usually hid his emotions. "Why even suggest the
"That's really sad though," Hermione sniffled, her cheeks shining with unchecked tears.
Seeing Astoria in her element, acting as the beautiful and witty diplomat in charge of liaising with the highest levels of wizarding politicians and celebrities, reminded Draco what had attracted him to her in the first place. In fact, Narcissa was right. Perhaps he had allowed himself too much time away from her, which had possibly made him forget that he also had to act the part of her husband. At his point, both sides of their original contracts had already been fulfilled satisfactorily, but he concluded to himself that it wasn't reason enough to stop doting upon her. Especially now that they were all in the shadow of a supposed foe, Draco decided that he needed to take more care of his family.
"I'm not!" Harry argued. He thought about his words this time, knowing how Draco tended to read too much into what anyone said. "Look," he started again. "I'm offering my condolences because you're my friend, and it sucks to lose a parent. That's all. I still hate him for everything he did willingly under Voldemort, but that doesn't stop me from
"Whatever it is, you'll get through it," Potter said with conviction, squeezing Draco's shoulder in a comforting way. "And I would never judge you, Malfoy. Not after everything we've been through. You deserve more than that."
After splashing his face with cool water, he went back to his bedroom and cast a quick
Malfoy laughed, and Harry was grateful that he was able to slightly defuse the tension. "Thanks, Potter," the blond said. "Now if any of this gets out of the Manor..."
Draco laughed.
" Harry exclaimed. "Maybe that's how your world works, but not mine, and I'm telling you to quit thinking like we're in one big monopoly game. I'm not going to suddenly call in a debt or whatever, that's just stupid-"
"I have been blessed enough to have made a new name for myself, and to have such a high regard for my profession within the ministry itself, in only a few years. Of course I know the benefits we reap from making friends and forging new alliances in all those official events that we attend. It was the only reason we are where we are now. But I realized lately that I no longer put too much stock in the social aspect of our society."
Draco turned a doubtful eye at his mother's conclusion. "You're selling me out to Gryffindors."
No one had ever asked him that, as he would have only had to think about doing so for his future grandchildren. He was silent as he pondered this odd question, and missed the way that Potter was glancing at him from behind his cup of tea.
"What d'you mean, that's what he meant?! Oi! George, you git! I want my house still standing after this party!!"
Ginny's eyes continued to inspect the living room. Harry gave her a short tour around all the rooms. "Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen with a breakfast nook and dining room, and an office."
"Harry..." she whispered, her breaths shallow. "It's not that I don't love being here, with you and James-"
Draco now had the urge to track down Potter, thank him, then promptly punch him in the face. He shuddered at the Muggle-ness of it, but he didn't think even a Cruciatus would ever be as satisfying.
Draco wondered when he and Potter had had such a friendly conversation outside of work. With a pang, he also realized that Potter was probably too guarded to confront people face to face; that he probably relied on the Floo Network to communicate and coordinate with other colleagues.
Then he remembered his real source of panic. James!
"Well it's no wonder the Wizengamot would say nothing about why they allowed our release."
Harry's expression turned cold. "You're not thinking of leaving, are you? You wouldn't
The Auror Corps were ecstatic when Harry Potter had agreed, and were very accommodating of Harry's insistent demand for compromise. It took very little for the Ministry to agree to Harry's requests to be included in the formal training of the next incoming class of trainees; to not be treated in a special manner by trainers; and for there to be no bias during evaluations. He wanted no special treatment (even though the Corps had already proactively prepared such special comforts for their Savior). Thus, he was able to begin training as an Auror, with an almost equal footing with his co-trainees. He could live in peace knowing that a big part of his achievements in the Auror Corps were to his own merit.
Something moving.
Harry chuckled. "Thank you for telling me. Though, I've got to admit, as much as I enjoy our occasional emotional exchanges, it's starting to feel a bit too maudlin."
she had told him.
He leaned back onto his chair, closed his eyes and heaved out a sigh. Of course he knew that being an Auror meant more than just hunting down and fighting Dark wizards. But after five years on the job, he still couldn't get over how much he hated anything to do with parchment work. With another sigh, he made himself as comfortable as possible, and dove back into his reports.
"Ah." Draco was unsure on how to respond to his mother's observation. Inwardly, he cursed himself for letting his Malfoy Mask fail. And then cursed himself again for letting his mother, of all people, be the one to call him out. And accuse him of adultery in the same breath. Clearly, his skills in taking in details from brief observations were inherited.
To his surprise, Draco shrugged. "That makes two of us."
"You are radiating pure joy, dear," his mother finally stated airily. "Trust me to know that I have not witnessed such an expression on your handsome face in quite a while, and it gave me quite a shock."
"It's true, though," Malfoy insisted. "It's not like we go into it with nary an idea of what it's about. I chose Astoria, and I offered to court her formally. In the end, she chose me, too. Our families both agreed, and our contract has been going strong. I see nothing wrong or odd about that."
"Gin," he prompted. She brought herself down by a notch to give him her attention. "C'mon to the roof, you might be able to celebrate more properly there."
"Hermione's like that, you know," he said quietly. "When we got married, everything was just great, and it still is, for the most part. But every time we talk about family, she just goes cold on me, and it's obvious that she doesn't see it the same way I do, even though she doesn't say it. At least Gin wants a family. I'm not sure if Hermione's sure about having kids just yet." He shrugged weakly. "That's why, since we found out she was pregnant, it's been- It's never a big fight, or some crazy argument where we stop talking to each other. Instead, it's like we're both dancing with each other, tiptoeing carefully around something so we don't set it off."
I miss reading your comments and reviews! Will post the next chapter soon!
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What?"
"Really, I assure you," he said insistently. "I am fine. Astoria is fine."
"I was talking with-with Healer Lows. In the Floo-"
"The last favor my mother and I ever did for my father was to ensure that his death would at least pass by in quiet honor, not in scandal."
"Don't say it," Draco interrupted her, eyes blazing. "Don't you dare finish that train of thought!"
Malfoy nodded in understanding.
Harry was dumbfounded. "I - I love you, too Ginny, it's just..." his voice broke, and a teardrop betrayed him and slid down his cheek. "I don't know what to say or think..."
"Er…"
Ginny's grin widened. "Flattery will get you nowhere."
"Do you think your mother will be amenable to you going to France for six months?" he inquired with a lightness in his voice.
He wanted to deny that he had ever been caught staring at Draco when the latter wasn't looking. He thought Draco stared back at him some of the time, too, but he didn't try reason why it made him flush with embarrassment and guilt when that happened.
He couldn't believe it, but…
But that wasn't even the best part, because-
"Too much?" Potter repeated with disbelief. "I want you safe, Malfoy, how is that too much?"
The man let out a barking laugh this time, sending goosebumps down Draco's petrified arms.
: Ron and I have no qualms about such matters. He understands my personal need to focus on the law, and it's not really a big deal between us, to be honest.
"It'll do," Draco chuckled. "I'll be in my study, but I'll see you at dinner before I leave."
It wasn't something thrown lightly, and Draco felt breathless that this was being offered to him so freely and willingly by his former nemesis.
"Hey, Gin," Harry said, sidling up next to her and blocking out Molly Weasley. "Miss me?"
Their testimonies were quite the same, both choosing to provide truths but not giving details when not prompted. This way, they were able to keep a semblance of privacy with the memories that they'd rather remain forgotten. At least that's what Draco thought his mother had done as well. He definitely didn't include everything in his story. If the Wizengamot didn't ask, then they didn't need to know.
They had expected to wallow the rest of their lives in a derelict cell and treated like scum. This was no prison to them anymore. It was like an extended private holiday, which he and his mother would spend doing whatever it was they loved. They would get through this.
Potter nodded. For a while they stood there, staring at each other. For some reason, it didn't seem awkward at all. Until Ginevra walked into the room and stared at him.
Ella's expression brightened. "Not everyone had the clearance to travel internationally in the window that you and Astoria were jumping from here to France and back. There was probably higher security for the event you went to, what with the international heads and all. I'm sure the French government would have controlled traffic. That could be another angle to check."
"Six weeks."
"Oh I'm sure it did, but it's not publicized in the way that you probably imagine," said Ron offhandedly. "It's usually between the two families, and it doesn't matter to anyone else because it's usually assumed to be true. I mean, no one really bats an eyelash about it because it's the way things have been for centuries."
"Oh, nothing new. Just trying to talk me out of training, you know?"
"You've met him before?" Hermione asked incredulously. "When was this?"
At the precise moment, two Healers came out and motioned for Ron to approach them. As the nervous redhead crossed the hallway to converse with them, Harry walked back towards where Ginny was sitting, holding a sleeping James in her arms.
"Where's that cake, then?" Draco remembered, simultaneously stretching out the kinks his back had received from falling asleep on the couch. "Are we getting it somewhere, or do you conveniently have a secret stash of sweets somewhere?"
After giving the house elves their orders for the duration of their stay, the couple settled in for the day, exhausted from their international Portkey. Scorpius, seemingly unbothered by his first jump to another country, slept soundly.
"No, in literal terms," Harry answered. "She hates being grounded from flight, and the same thing goes for the rest of her life. And I can see that. The reason she has been happy Chasing for the Harpies is because she really feels happiest when she is in the air and pushing a team towards victory. There's a fire in her that won't ever become satisfied if it had to be kept down. And being with me kind of does that now."
"No, they weren't," Draco said, eyes narrowing and zeroing in to Potter's guilty gaze. Hermione released him from her hug and he crossed his arms in front of himself, still staring accusingly at the man who always made his blood boil. "How did you even manage to make it to our door when we had our private ward closed off to anyone?"
"I do, and I'll do everything in my power to help you," Harry murmured, then flashed a smile at the blonde. "Now that we've sorted that out... get the fuck out of my floo. It's still just before sunrise, you bastard."
Draco looked at his wife but remained silent. He and Astoria had indeed been forced to reexamine their original marriage plan, since Narcissa had insisted. Indeed, everyone in the wizarding world knew that traditional Purebloods usually had their first children immediately after the marriage. It was the whole point of family alliances, to have the heirs to carry the bloodlines and last name. However, Astoria had never given the impression that she was ready, so Draco had felt no need to broach the subject.
"Do you need me to get you anything?" he prompted, eager to please.
"Yes, to parade him as the youngest Malfoy brat," Gerard interjected smugly. "And I never had to worry about raising the brat meself. Our plan still followed through! Happy accident, indeed!"
As it was, Hermione's estimation was off only by a few minutes. By that time, Harry had settled down a little, now supporting a babbling James (hidden completely via
"Fuck that, you're just kipping on my couch until you get sick of it and Floo back to your own fluffy, pretentious bed."
He shuddered, which prompted Harry to refill his drink. The steam, which floated visibly between them as Draco sipped, seemed to help ease both of them.
"Yeah, I know. But can't you at least come back here earlier than what you'd planned?" He hated that she wanted to be away with the team all the way until her seventh month, or Merlin forbid, the eighth if she could find a way around it. "I wan't you home, safe. I want our little boy or girl safe."
"I said stop it, Gerard," Astoria snarled. "I just want to get this over with. Explain what you had in mind when you brought him here. We don't have - "
"And the whole idea is to bait this mysterious enemy of yours and have them become frustrated at your lack of fear. Seeing you go about with your daily itinerary will hopefully lead them to question why you didn't feel threatened. People who go about such methods always want attention, they want you to notice them and make it all about them. They want you to react to them. The best way to deal with that is to show them that you don't give a fuck."
"Nothing, Draco," she replied smoothly, "it was simply written on your very face that you had a good time while you were away."
"Fuck you, Malfoy," Harry said, not unkindly. "And no, I'm not a vampire, though you shouldn't have readily opened up your home to me, you know. Tsk tsk, you know it's basic personal security," he added, this time with a little smirk of his own.
For a while, it seemed that his wife had no words. Being Astoria, it was a bit odd that she had nothing to say for a change, and that worried Draco.
Draco was still confused, so he waited.
Harry studied Malfoy's apparition. His Auror's skills were honed to perfection, and his brain had automatically begun cataloguing whether or not Malfoy had any malicious intent or ulterior motive. Unfortunately, the Gryffindor in him also reacted to the perceived helplessness and desperation. With a sigh, he laid his book down and tilted his head in inquiry.
"Oh stop the histrionics, Potter," Draco drawled. "Despite your complete trust in old magic, even you can't be stupidly ignorant enough to have expected
It was a very simple nightly ritual that he and Harry had unknowingly established during their long weekends together: have dinner, wash up, feed James and Albus, put them to bed, and then read together. Or at least, Harry would read aloud and Teddy would laugh at his antics.
Which, to Draco, meant that there was a lot more that was going on beneath the surface. What concerned him, however, was not the fact that there were problems to uncover, but the realization that he wanted to make Potter feel better about it somehow.
With shaking hands, Draco ripped the envelope open and slowly read the words. With great difficulty, he handed the papers back to Hermione, before admitting, "I cannot make sense of this information."
"Save the world?" Ginny supplied. This time, it was Harry's turn to playfully smack her arm.
Once again, Harry thought amusedly to himself, Draco Malfoy somehow saved the day. It wasn't something he would readily admit to, but over the last few months, he had really gotten used to having the man as an outlet for the kind of conversations he could neither expect nor ever ask for from Ron and Hermione. Or anyone else, if her were being quite honest.
"...that we might just be fine... being apart."
She snorted at that. "Not good enough," she whispered.
There was a complex expression shadowing Malfoy's face. "Too simple for you?" Harry asked, somewhat amused. "Not enough obscure constellations to suit your taste?"
Her eyes fluttered a bit, as if she were responding to his voice. After a few more moments, Astoria sat bolt upright, only to be held by Draco firmly in his arms.
"I feel terrible that you still haven't caught up, so why don't I help you a bit?" The kidnapper laughed darkly. "Anyway, it might make this more fun if you knew how long you've been playing the fool, eh? We've got some time alone to talk, you and I, before my partner gets here. Then we'll have some real fun."
It wasn't Draco.
Ron nudged him again, nodding towards the crotchety witch in front, who had finally stepped off the podium. With a jolt, Harry realized that it was his turn to speak, and he nervously approached the space that the witch had vacated. Despite having done this quite a lot in the last two months, he still found that he was trembling. This time, however, it was because he actually had something worthwhile to say, and he fully intended to make sure the entire magical population would listen.
Ginny's return from Canada wouldn't be for another week, and he felt he still needed that much time to prepare. After all, it wasn't every day that one asked their fiancée if breaking their engagement was for the best. No, that kind of conversation needed a lot of warming up.
Potter theatrically rolled his eyes. "I just didn't think you'd appreciate having a great big stag barge into your private residence crying out the woes of Harry Potter..."
he wondered to himself.
It was such a beautiful tableau, he thought to himself with a grin.
"You're okay," he breathed gratefully, moving instantly to Ginny's side to put his arm around her and celebrate the face that she was alright.
He couldn't imagine what it had been like for her, returning to a Voldemort-controlled Hogwarts, going against Snape and trying to steal the Sword of Gryffindor for Harry, taking punishment and dishing it out with equal fervor, and readily fighting on his side at the final battle. And the whole time, she had known nothing about his whereabouts, his safety, or even his plans. She had gone through the year just going on whatever was speculated on Potterwatch, and then she had seen him seemingly dead in Hagrid's arms. Harry recalled seeing her unmoving in the Chamber of Secrets, the dread he had felt when he thought he had come too late. It had never been easy for the two of them, he mused bitterly. But that was why they had worked so well together for years - they had gone through almost the same things, together and apart. They had lost family, they had their minds and souls invaded by Voldemort, and they both had had a lot to live up to. They shared the passion for Quidditch, the immense dislike for anything ostentatious and unnecessary. They fit together, both in the big things as well as the tiny details. It just made sense for them to be together.
"He was very pretty, though, to be fair," Harry added, pretending to be on his best mate's defense, but his joking tone pretty much made it clear that the redhead was going to be the butt of that day's jokes.
"Er..." He had no idea what to say, given that he had just literally broken down in tears and was interrupted by an archenemy-turned-mate. "Why?" he asked hesitantly.
Harry couldn't help but be a little curious. It wasn't difficult to get Hermione flustered, but he had long since become sensitive to his friends' reactions, and he took her warning tone seriously.
"Darling," he crooned, kneeling in front of her and taking her delicate hand in his. "There is nothing to worry about now. The investigation is going smoothly, and even the actions of this mysterious stalker have been by the book."
He looked into Potter's eyes as if to find some sort of confirmation, and found it in the way that Potter wouldn't meet his gaze.
The next day, Draco would be sure that he had had another nightmare, but for the life of him, would not be able to remember a single thing about it.
It took Draco a while to adjust to the fact that he was on all fours on the floor. He immediately tensed and struggled to stand up.
"-can barely breathe-"
No, Harry would keep this quiet until they got down to the bottom of it all.
it was a bloke, alright?" Ron insisted, though sounding sheepish. Harry couldn't help but burst out laughing. He still looked a little roughed up from last night, but the coffee (and potion) seemed to have countered his hangover.
He was already "in the future".
She turned back to face him, eyes streaming with tears. "I know you were having a perfect morning, alright? It just hurt to see that I wasn't part of it. Like I didn't even have to be here for all of you to just have this amazing picture of a happy family of something. Just... it hurt, alright?"
They were all still waiting for the other shoe to drop, for that moment when the suspected wizard would become so annoyed or so overconfident that he would give himself away. The Auror watch was still tailing William Howe, but it was so far inconclusive.
"No, Gin, it's nothing, I swear," he ensured her. "It was a bit of a surprise, actually, but I invited him over and we were able to catch up a bit."
It took him most of five hours, which consisted of much cross-referencing, crossing out notes, crossing over to different shelves, getting cross-eyed, and being irascibly cross, but he was finally able to at least narrow down how the item names were created. It most resembled an archaic shorthand from Scandinavia, and Draco was sure that none of the resident potion masters at the Auror Corps had access to the manuscripts his great-grandfather had kept in one obscure corner of the library. From there, he was able to transliterate the items and note which category they most probably belonged to. The excitement and pride he felt at making two conclusions in just one day made him so smug and ecstatic, and he rushed to the drawing room to contact Potter immediately.
Malfoy seemed taken aback by the sudden change in the ambience. "How did y- never mind. I - I need your help. You and Weasley. I know it's early, but -"
Ginny took a napkin and wiped away the stray bits of egg on Harry's chin. "Unfortunately, Harry, you do look like a crazed maniac right now, it merits a photograph!"
"What's wrong, Ron? Are you alright? Is Hermione?"
"Well, maybe she's just really not there yet, Ron," Harry said, relieved. "Remember, Muggles don't usually marry until they're well into their twenties. Sure in the Wizarding world, we come of age at 17 and build up our careers from then on. But in the Muggle world, it just means more schooling after. So marriage doesn't actually come into the picture for most people until they're about 25."
"Bloody fucking hell!"
Astoria turned back to face Draco, looking perturbed by his question. "I did tell you that I wasn't the least bit interested in having children. Did you listen? And anyway, when I discovered my pregnancy, I tried to hide it. But Gerard finally convinced me to keep our child."
His mind couldn't stop thinking about the absurdity of sharing drinks and laughs with Potter and Weasley. Sure, they had gotten over their animosity a couple years ago, and they had been pretty mature about it. They had even been at Draco's wedding, he and Astoria had made sure of that (as it was also a well-calculated move on their part, which played out to their advantage).
Draco groaned to himself. Despite the intricate matrix of hidden passageways in the Manor, there was simply no way through to his own suite without passing by the doors of said room. Which meant he either had to Disillusion himself, (which was absolutely ridiculous given that he was in his own home) or just wait until the elf announced the guests had gone (he had never been a patient man). In the end, he decided to casually walk towards his rooms at a brisk walk. He considered doing a quick Notice-Me-Not, but then figured that it was unnecessary given that all he had to do was cross a doorway as quietly and unobtrusively as possible.
Instead of joining her lover in celebrating, Astoria seemed to be troubled, at least to Draco. "Be quiet, Gerard. We must do something about your threats and kidnapping. Draco has friends in high places, and we must carry this out flawlessly if we are to remain unscathed. We are already running out of time and I refuse to be dirtied by your impulsive little game."
Hermione likely had no idea what it meant, but Draco was pretty sure that never,
Draco sighed and received the papers from the redhead. He absolutely
After lunch and the extra special dessert (during which Teddy had insisted on using candles for Harry to blow out and make a wish), Kreacher helpfully offered to take care of the mess (both in the kitchen and the dining room) while Harry and Draco went to checkup on their sons.
"You've done well," Draco addressed the elf, suddenly remembering Hermione's lessons on house elf etiquette. "Thank you. Please go back to the other elves and inform them that any letters similar to this shall be treated with caution."
: Oh my bad. (rolls eyes at HP) I meant to say, she's been travelling around with the Holyhead Harpies, you know, she's training for the National team and everything, so they've got her working day and night. She practically lives with them, so you can barely catch her here.
Harry, meanwhile, was caught in an onslaught of visions and memories full of blood, pain and guilt. Then he found himself running down a familiar corridor and into a flooded bathroom, with mirrors all around. At the other end of the room, bent over an old lavatory, was a blond someone. Harry's instincts told him to draw his wand. The man in front of him turned around to face Harry, and morphed into a teenager. His face was stained with grime and tears, his lips beginning to form into words, possibly a curse. Harry's bones told him it was the Cruciatus.
"My appearance?"
: Sorry, think of it like... well basically we gather information about criminals, their background, their motivations behind curses, basically looking into their head. So while the other departments in the Auror Corps focus on material such as evidence, witnesses, spell damage... the MMI looks into the how and why, so we can figure out much more about the criminal, and the case as well.
he wondered sleepily.
"Don't apologize," he said sternly. "I've already come here prepared to play the part of loyal and supportive friend, which I intend to pull off with flying colors. That includes being a good listener to your whinging. Now, before we continue this little bonding session, why don't we actually go somewhere? Didn't you promise Arthur Weasley you'd go and take a break?"
"I've always had them, you know," the blond continued, now speaking quietly. "Since the Dark Lor- since Voldemort had come back. I could never sleep well after that. And sixth and seventh year... After the war, they got worse. My mother was so distressed because she always woke up to me screaming. Can you imagine that, Potter? An adult, crying so loudly in his sleep that his mother had to come and wake him."
After a rather slow morning of parchment work, Harry finally gave it a rest and stretched his arms up as if he were a cat. Wondering if lunch that day would be courtesy of him or Kreacher, he wandered over to the kitchen. On the way, however, he spotted Ginny huddled in front of the fire.
"Stop it, Harry," Hermione groaned. "No, we won't judge you or think any less of you for telling us what we think you want to tell us."
Knowing that Teddy would always move faster when in high spirits, Harry felt no shame in knowing that he could relax this time and not have to fight his godson into his clothes.
Potter, on the other hand, had gone the non-traditional route, not having a betrothal contract before the engagement. When Draco had inquired about it, he was rewarded with a confused and blank stare.
"Been working on these for a while now," he had said brightly. "Instantly warms up when it's needed, and the charm is child-safe and everything." He gave a brilliant smile as Ginny excitedly took the knitwear and cooed over it. "Glad to have a new baby Weasley to give them to now!"
"It's hardly any different from hiring a wet nurse or a nanny, is it?" Harry told her.
Malfoy looked up when he heard his son's name. "Scorpius? I want the very best for him! I don't want to be... be like..."
"Thanks, Harry," she said, collapsing on the foot of the bed and closing her eyes. "I never imagined a baby could make me feel this knackered when it's not even out yet."
"Come to me later, Draco," the matriarch said seriously, before turning gracefully and walking towards her own suite within the Manor.
"Do we tell Malfoy, or…?"
: Shut up, Ron. Anyway, I was a bit surprised, but then I figured that it was another chance for me to do even more, to be more involved with the important cases.
Draco laughed, which made Harry smile again for some reason. "Mother is used to conducting her social life within the Manor," the blond explained. "It wasn't too much of a change for her. The Fidelius has only helped to boost her confidence that any actual danger apart from life-threatening cards will be kept out."
"I've missed a lot, I know that," she said, shaking so bad that Harry decided to comfort her. It was just what they did, they comforted each other, even though they were hurting each other. "I've always hated being away from James, but now I can't fucking accept that he's even more at ease with fucking Malfoy than with me! And I did all that, it was all my fault!"
Malfoy's hand clenched ever so slightly at his words, so Harry knew he was on the right track. He had guessed correctly. Malfoy didn't believe he could fulfill the requirements of the ritual.
The embrace was sudden, but Draco welcomed his mother's show of affection. Though she was slighter than him, it felt like her slender arms were holding him up and keeping him aloft of his problems. For a terrifying second, he felt sixteen again, helpless and alone. Deep down, he knew that it wasn't the pregnancy that worried him so, but his wife's nonsensical words.
"That was hands down the cheesiest description of love." Draco closed his eyes. "But… you sold it well."
Draco merely nodded.
After finishing the paper, he sighed and sat back onto the couch. With the engagement finalized, he and his betrothed had much to do in the way of planning, and he wasn't eager to get entangled in it. Thankfully, they both agreed that they needed to focus on their own plans before marriage, and decided that two years was sufficient time for that. After all, Draco still had to go back to France for another year to start training for his Potions Mastery. Meanwhile, Astoria was still a busy socialite, and wished to make rounds in Europe in order to build rapport with neighboring wizarding circles. Draco hadn't minded in the slightest; in fact, he applauded her for her understanding of personal ambition, something he had hoped to find in his future wife.
Ginny bit her lip. "You know we were pretty lucky that James' delivery was perfectly normal, if a bit of a challenge."
Draco watched him for a moment before mentally shaking himself. “I need more coffee,” he declared. “Anyone else?”
Draco was playing recklessly, and he knew it. He was still boiling with anger at his parents’ presumption and dismissiveness, and he was taking it out on anyone who got in his way, teammate or rival. He’d missed what should have been an easy opportunity to catch the Snitch, too busy violently knocking his opponent off course, earning himself a loud reprimand from his Captain the next time he swerved near the goalposts.
“I… of course not. Yes.” Draco’s mind was reeling, trying to synthesize everything he’d just heard. “Thank you. For telling me.” He paused, took a deep breath. “For what it’s worth, I care about him, as well.”
Hermione shook her head at him. “Honestly, Harry. Ronald told me about you two flirting at the gala. And then you had that string of letters all from the same owl, and then you suddenly started disappearing several evenings a week with no explanation and no hint of who you were with. Also, you went to all of the Wasps games. It was pretty obvious.”
“Excuse you,
. Never heard a thing; never saw them on the off days. It was bizarre. Also, turns out it’s still pretty boring waiting outside a closed door in the hopes that something will happen.”
Harry covered his mouth with a hand to hide his grin. “Pretty buggy out here. We should probably get back.” He turned and began to jog back toward the lights of the party in the distance, ignoring Romilda’s desperate mix of declarations of love and shrieks of disgust as moths continued to flock around her.
As though summoned by Harry’s despondency, there was a knock at the door. “Harry?” came Draco’s voice.
“Oh my god, is that Loony Lovegood? This ought to be interesting.”
“Not your fault. Bathroom, then dinner?”
decisions at sixteen.”
“It’s lovely, Mother,” Draco said, looking around curiously, “but I must admit it’s not at all what I expected.”
Harry shrugged. “Fine by me. Pizza work for everyone?”
Sadiyah nodded. “Yes, but luckily, I haven’t had to hide anything from him—we got together after I witnessed his son having an accidental magic incident. They were both so panicked; I was really glad to be able to help them understand what was happening. I ended up getting really close with both of them, and—” She shrugged, and Blaise smiled.
“Alright.”
“Potter, may I speak with you?”
“I wish I could disagree. And I’ve had Polyjuice Potion a few times, so that’s really saying something.”
As Draco landed on his back in the snow, the air pushed from his lungs by the force of it, he could faintly hear Teddy laughing from what must have been several meters away. “That was wicked!” He felt relief wash over him. Thank Merlin for cushioning charms.
“That’s precisely why I like it,” Draco said. “I can drink my wine and enjoy the breeze without having to worry if my stomach is going to decide to expel itself from my body.”
“Good chemistry is hard to come by.” His rapid turnover in significant others wasn’t exactly a secret, so he couldn’t bring himself to be truly offended.
“Aye aye, captain.” Harry gave a little salute, and Draco snorted. Pansy narrowed her eyes at him, then sighed.
Sweat-slicked skin and the cling of leather under your fingertips
“It’s creepy.”
“Hey, don’t cry. It’s okay, really. I’m happy for you.” And he found that he meant it. He hadn’t even thought about tonight’s eliminations, he realized. He liked everyone who was still here; he had no idea how he would have gone about choosing who to send home. But this… this was a good reason. A happy reason. After the toxicity of the last two elimination nights, it was a relief. It felt right.
“There’s a pizza oven out back,” Harry pointed out.
“That’s up to your Healers.” His mother’s voice was firm, and Draco couldn’t help feeling an exasperated fondness at her overprotectiveness. Or, at least, he couldn’t until he remembered just why he’d been playing so recklessly in the first place.
“Yes, I’ve noticed; we seem to have new junior staff in every day at the main office.”
Harry didn’t know if his laugh was amusement or relief or just unbearable joy. Probably all three. He rolled so that he was poised over Draco. “Good to know,” he said, and leaned down to kiss him again.
that he was—
At Perry’s name, Draco’s face took an interesting and rapid journey from shocked, to sheepish, to smug. “And what do I owe dear Peregrine, then?”
“No one but the crew saw,” Draco promised him. “We unlocked the door as soon as we realized what was happening. They just think that something broke down.”
It wasn’t as though Harry and Malfoy were still
“I don’t understand.”
“—so, I don’t know. It just feels hopeless, and it’s only been two weeks. I’m starting to wonder if it might be better just to admit defeat.”
Draco pulled back, and his face was even paler than usual, his expression repentant. “I still should have— ”
Draco melted into it, his hands rising to frame Harry’s face, thumbs caressing his temples, lips parting to allow Harry entrance. Harry poured all of his tangled emotions into it, not wanting to stop, but eventually having to as the need for air became a somewhat pressing concern.
He was glad of his prescience when they landed and Draco promptly fell to his knees over the toilet and vomited spectacularly. Harry grimaced, but crouched next to him, rubbing circles on his back. “What can I do?”
He’s…” Harry waved his hand broadly, trying to encompass everything that Draco was.
Harry gave a small huff of laughter and leaned in, not bothering to answer.
“I can’t believe you arseholes made me come as Xander,” Ron grumbled, picking unhappily at his oversized, printed button-down where it hung open over an oddly fitting t-shirt. “Xander’s a tit.”
It felt… nice. Pleasant. A little strange, maybe, to be kissing someone so calculatedly. He wasn’t sure he’d ever paid such close attention to a kiss before. But it wasn’t
Harry huffed a little laugh. “No, we were never… I mean, yeah, I loved her. I
“That was all
Harry cackled as he flipped the contents of the pan. “Long after we broke up, I promise. It was, uh—” he rubbed the back of his neck, looking sheepish. “—well, a commentary on my perpetual singleness, actually. She told me that if no one was going to be here in the mornings I might as well be comfortable.” He shrugged one shoulder. “She’s terrible, but she wasn’t wrong; it’s comfortable as hell.”
“And what about you?”
Ron had been completely kind and reasonable about Harry’s disappearance after the match. “It’s fine, mate. I probably wouldn’t have wanted to talk to me just then, either, if I were you.”
I find him lying on the ground without me, eyes closed, listening to The Fugees. There’s a bottle next to him, though it’s still mostly full, and his face is splotchy like he’s been crying.
“I could try to explain, but you wouldn’t understand a word I was saying,” Draco told him loftily.
“I mean, not really,” Harry said with an odd sense of deja vu. “But he knows all about Wizarding genealogy, so he had a better idea of where to start than me or Hermione did. He showed us a bunch of books from their family library, and it turns out that the Potters were black and my grandmother was Indian. I sort of wondered for a bit if I might still have family there, but her family had been in England for a few generations by the time she was born, so it seems unlikely.”
“Meaning we slept with them. Cheers.”
“I should be asking you that,” Harry responded, stretching languorously. “You’re my guest, technically.”
Draco hastily removed his apron once more and headed upstairs to clean up and change.
of negotiation amongst the adults, they decided that if I wanted to keep pursuing dance, Auntie Amani would tutor me in magic so that I would know how to use my powers safely. As I got older, I felt a bit isolated, not being able to tell any of my friends about that part of myself, so I asked her to start introducing me to people in the wizarding world. Now I live a bit on both sides. It’s unconventional, but it works for me.”
do in your off time while we’re busy nosing around each other’s business?”
Or so he thought. But that had been before Ginny and Pansy had gotten engaged.
The top of his head as he drops to his knees
“Shit, hold on.” Harry stepped through the open panel of the huge shower, wincing at the contrasting streams of hot and frigid water as he fumbled with the knobs until they returned to a warm, gentle rain. He let out a breath, pushing his once-again-soaking hair out of his face. “There, now it should be—”
A wand returned.
he thought, feeling giddy.
It was a relief when Pansy and Draco came to brief him on the next day’s date. They came by earlier than usual, interrupting him as he once again sat amongst a chaotic spread of puzzle pieces, unable to concentrate well enough to put any of them together.
“I said—” And then Draco’s eyes went as wide as Harry’s as his mind caught up with his mouth. He looked suddenly panicked. “Fuck. I didn’t mean—”
Now that it was safe to look, Harry glanced over at him, his brow wrinkling in confusion. “But you put your bag into our boot when we were arranging everything; I saw you.”
He could see Draco smirk slightly out of the corner of his eye, even in the dim light of the moon. “I thought Gryffindors were supposed to be brave.”
“Fair enough. Cheers.” Harry took a sip of wine, giving an appreciative hum. “That’s lovely.”
“Pansy, Blaise,” he nodded. “Hey, Draco. I’m glad you’re here! I should have mentioned it yesterday but I completely forgot it was even happening until Ginny showed up at my workshop and practically dragged me out by my hair.”
Harry was immediately on alert. “Is something wrong?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, breathing heavily. “Yeah, just… give me a sec. It’s been awhile.” He let his head fall back against the pillows, and Draco, despite looking thoroughly wrecked already, managed to smirk down at him.
“Master Draco is out by the pond,” the elf responded in a croaky voice somewhat reminiscent of Harry’s old elf Kreacher.
“Yeah, she’s asleep, but she’s only been down for about an hour.”
Draco snorted. “
Perry gave him a small smile. “Relax, it’s not bad. I don’t think.”
“Not exactly.” Sadiyah looked at him for a long moment and then sighed. “It’s just that… Harry, you’ve already made up your mind. I’m not completely oblivious, you know. I’m not sure why you’re going through the motions at this point. Why not just tell him?”
“I mean, you still don’t really drive or use phones or anything, though,” Harry agreed reluctantly, grimacing at Ron’s look of outrage. “Sorry, but you know it’s true.”
Draco shrugged. “Too salty.”
“In love. Yeah. And have you ever seen Draco Malfoy comfort anyone but you?”
“Now, resist testing your finished product, please; we’re all going to try everyone’s at the end to see how you all did,” Nancy called to them from the front of the room.
“That depends. Was it a dreadfully boring repetition of the same three moves you use every time we fuck?”
“They changed it,” Harry explained. He was oddly moved by the gesture. The fresh setting made it easier to separate the space from the rollercoaster of the past two evenings.
Greg dumped the contents of the bag in the middle of the clearing, letting everyone scramble for their own food rather than trying to hand everything out himself. Harry waited for the initial rush to die down before grabbing himself a roast beef sandwich and some sort of peanut butter granola bar. He had just unwrapped his sandwich and was in the process of taking a bite when a loud rustling nearby caught his attention.
Even over the tang of sweat and stale alcohol, Harry could smell the leather of Jack’s jacket as they wrapped an arm around him. Their hand slid up his chest as they pulled him into a slow, sensual grind, their other hand clasping his hip. Harry’s eyes soon fell closed, the proximity overwhelming. One of his hands met the one on his hip; the other, he looped backward around their neck. As they danced, the hand on Harry’s chest splayed out, making his skin tingle. At one point, he felt their fingers sliding across his skin as though searching for something. He could feel his heart pounding under their palm. As the song came to a close, Harry turned to face them, but they’d already melted back into the crowd.
Harry laughed. “Fine, you can
for your humiliation. That was one of the highlights of my year.”
“I… suppose that would be fine, yes.” Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about this development, but he suspected that he wasn’t being given a choice in the matter.
with Pansy. And was not particularly subtle about it.”
echoed back at him. At a nod from Blaise, he took a long drink and a deep breath, and then ventured out into the crowd.
“For now.” Pansy winked and the two disappeared onto the dance floor without a backwards glance.
As soon as he reached the street, he took off running.
“Oh.” Luna sounded disappointed.
“Well, no, it was technically before he left.” Harry raised an eyebrow, and Perry added defensively, “It was really soft! He shouldn’t have left it laying around. I would have given it back before we all left. Probably.”
“God, yes,” Ginny and Ron spoke in unison, before turning to glare at one another, causing Harry to snort and Hermione to try to bite back a laugh.
“Draco, dear, you know you’re not getting any younger. I’d already been married several years and had you by the time I was your age.”
Harry raised an eyebrow and, when Draco didn’t drop his legs or his gaze, smacked him once more, making him groan and his head flop back as his cock twitched, giving him away. “Fuck.”
“Of course,” Chris said, unperturbed, “I expected no less. If you decide you’re interested, I’d prefer to start you sooner rather than later, though, so I’d appreciate it if you could give me an answer before the end of the year.”
“Alright,” Harry exhaled. He downed his margarita for courage, setting the glass aside. “Here goes nothing.” Standing, he took a few steps back before launching himself forward into the water with a large
In response, Harry stepped closer and leaned up, kissing him. Draco smiled into it, hands finding their way to Harry’s hips as he responded. He felt Harry’s tongue brush against his lower lip and met it for a moment before pulling back.
“Harry. Do you feel any of that when you think about me?” she prodded.
“Oh, I found her in the woods on Monday. She’d injured her leg, and I patched her right up. She’s been a lovely guide while I’ve explored.”
“Oh lord,” Draco said, effectively pulled back into the moment. “Do I want to know?”
“Miss Parkinson is being away from the house, but Dilly can be passing along a message to Mister Malfoy, if Sir wants. Mister Malfoy has been awake for several hours now.”
Greg sighed sadly. “I’m going to have to clean out the oven and start over. Unless someone knows a charm for that?”
Harry had to admit she’d done a good job with them—she was working in pencil, and her sketch was made up of a good deal of cross hatching and a plethora of straight lines that somehow managed to capture the curves of his toes and ankles with impressive accuracy. “It’s quite good, actually,” he told her. “I thought you hadn’t done figure drawing before?”
Harry winced in sympathy. “Right. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
“Sure thing.” As they reached the front of the short queue, Harry ordered Draco’s tea and a cappuccino from the bored-looking teen manning the counter. She waved her wand lazily and the drinks began preparing themselves while Harry and Draco stepped to the side.
Draco huffed a laugh. “Well, I had a show to run, didn’t I?”
“Outsourcing.”
“I was actually coming to ask you that,” Draco admitted, his smirk disappearing. “Pansy asked me to check in on you.”
. “I suppose they aren’t the only people to make an unexpected match in recent years. Did you hear that Mrs. Nott seems to have struck up an acquaintance with Xenophilius Lovegood?”
She observed him for a few moments and then shrugged. “Okay.”
that I would not tolerate—”
He turned a corner and was confronted by a tall cabinet.
“Hmm.” Harry turned his gaze back out over the ocean. The more time he spent around Cormac, the more he thought that the appeal of his body was far outweighed by his grating personality.
Harry grinned. “Well, then. Hi, Draco.”
“Yeah. I really fucking do.” He closed his eyes and leant his forehead against Draco’s, huffing out a quiet laugh. “Fuck, this day, I swear. I’ve got bloody whiplash. Merlin.”
Teddy wrinkled his nose. “New York sounds stupid.”
“Honestly? I’m ashamed of how I behaved. Watching the episode where I was eliminated was a real wake up call. My family and friends were
Just then, the door to the flat slammed, making him curse under his breath in panic. He’d thought he’d have more time before Draco got back from his date; he usually didn’t come home until dawn. There was no way Harry was going to get himself healed before Draco made it this far, and Harry, like the idiot he was, hadn’t even closed the bathroom door. He contemplated spelling it shut now, but he was still tipsy enough that he wasn’t sure he could control the force of the spell. He didn’t think that accidentally knocking the door off its hinges would be particularly helpful to his current predicament.
They worked quietly for a while, listening to the gentle strains of the classical Christmas music that Narcissa had set to play on the wireless. Draco carefully calligraphed each piece of parchment, settling into a rhythm and enjoying watching each precise curl and swoop of script take shape. He hadn’t been looking forward to his task at all, but he had forgotten how satisfying he found formal writing. The more casual scrawl of his regular correspondence just wasn’t the same.
“Do you—” Harry started, but he could hear his voice shaking. He stopped, took a deep breath, and started over. “Do you have any idea how many people died so that it would ‘turn out okay’?”
“You were never supposed to know.”
“Xander.”
“Okay...” Draco answered, feeling suddenly wrongfooted. Shit. Had Harry noticed Draco watching him and changed his mind? Did he not want to be friends after all?
. When he rose, pushing his hair back out of his eyes, Ginny was cracking up once more, and Ron was looking at him, eyes wide with betrayal, hair freshly soaked.
Harry stared, trying to keep a straight face. Leela had not been exaggerating. The canvas was made up of splotches of vivid colors arranged into a sort of… well. He couldn’t come up with anything, actually. It reminded him a bit of Dobby’s portrait of him from his school days, in that he had no clue which parts of it were supposed to be him.
, led his little gang directly over to Harry and his friends, hands in his pockets, somehow managing to saunter across the room despite the absolutely packed bar floor. “Well, well, well,” he said, voice and grin both dripping with pure sin, “What
Pansy had hired Draco as co-producer as soon as the show had been greenlit, and Harry found himself surprisingly glad to have him there. They’d become friendly enough over the years, and Harry knew from experience that Draco was good at reining Pansy in when her need to be in control started to get out of hand. He’d done an impressive job talking her off a ledge when the flowers for her engagement party hadn’t been the right shade of red, for example.
Draco stood and watched it, and, as Teddy had directed, remembered. The freedom of flying down the slopes. Harry’s carefree laughter carrying on the wind. That almost-kiss. “It’s lovely,” he told Teddy.
Pansy sighed. “I was hoping to contact the Portkey station for Blaise’s luggage.” Blaise raised an eyebrow and she made a face. “I just don’t want to lend you my clothes! This whole… gender-fuckery fashionplate thing is cheating.”
” He gave a sideways nod at Harry, who was still glaring at Malfoy with his arms crossed, “but I didn’t fancy that hair. Besides, I look amazing in this suit.”
Some time later, Draco flopped onto his back with an exhausted groan. “Fucking hell, my whole body is shaking.” He looked over at Harry and stretched his arms with a wince. “Kayaking was a terrible choice. Next time, you’re doing all the work.”
Once they were dried and rested, Harry and Sadiyah decided to take a stroll along the boardwalk. They bought a couple of ice creams to cool themselves off and chatted amiably as they walked. Harry asked Sadiyah more about her own childhood, curious about her unusual education.
“Not great.” Harry tried to think of what else to say, but came up short.
“Hey, Harry!” came a call from the patio. Making his way out, he found Ron and Greg looking interestedly out toward the lake. “There’s another building down there; is that ours, too?” Ron asked.
Malfoy shuddered. “Worse. They’re trying to arrange a marriage.” He gestured across the room with his head towards where Ginny Weasley was chatting with a pretty, petite brunette. “Not that Astoria seems particularly interested in that plan either, thank Merlin.”
“Nonono!” she cried, eyes wide, jumping between him and her easel. “It’s so awful!”
“Oh. Right.”
effort, would you?” He walked back to the side of the field, shaking his head, and blew the whistle again to restart the game.
Harry obeyed, unwrapping the final gift in his lap. He took the snowglobe from its box and lifted it up to his eye level, taking it in. When he noticed the trio of little sledders among the other figures, he huffed out a surprised laugh. “Where on earth—?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco laughed. “It’s been a long time since Hogwarts, Harry.” He paused before going on. “Feelings about what?” His voice turned teasing. “Are she and Ginevra looking to make it a threesome?”
“—okay.” Harry’s brain was still sorting out her rush of words, but she seemed so panicked that he went into crisis management mode. “Breathe.”
“Is that so?” Malfoy returned the smirk, his eyes glittering with something promising. “Well then, good riddance. Definitely his loss—and our gain.”
The audience applauded, albeit with slightly less enthusiasm than they had for the others.
“And this surprises you?”
Harry had hoped that he could sneak back into the cottage without his friends realizing that he’d been out all night, but he should have known better. Hermione was curled up on the sofa in the front room with a cup of tea and a book when he walked in. She looked up and raised an eyebrow at him, saying nothing.
“That was really lovely. Thank you,” Harry said sincerely as Dermot moved the guitar back to its place next to the couch.
“I don’t… I mean, yes! But is… hmm.” Draco cleared his throat, seemingly unable to formulate a coherent sentence, which Harry thought was fairly promising, as far as quality-of-kisses went. Finally, he settled on, “When did this happen?” He gestured vaguely in a way that Harry took to mean ‘When did you decide that you wanted to kiss my face off?’
Malfoy spends the night sometimes, when he’s too drunk to get home or when he pretends he is because he can’t stand the thought of going back to the Manor. I never call him on it. This house has too many rooms, anyway, so it’s no big deal, and it’s kind of nice to have someone around in the mornings.
“Damn. I hoped I’d at least get you through New Years.” Harry didn’t sound…
“That isn’t the point, and you know—”
Harry blinked, taken aback. “Did he tell you that?”
They landed near a paved path surrounded by lush gardens. Harry looked around in wonderment. “This is gorgeous. Where are we?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s head snapped up. “She— But you said it was fine!”
“Harry.” The voice was closer now, right behind him. A hesitant hand slid up his arm, elbow to shoulder, before grasping gently to turn him. Harry kept his head down, but, once again, those damnably gentle fingers lifted his chin, forcing him to look.
Jack held Harry’s gaze as they took a sip of the whisky they’d just been served. “You tell me,” they said, finally, leaning casually against the bar and immediately undoing all of Harry’s mental efforts to quash the panic that Jack seemed to consistently instill in him.
“Me? I would never.”
“So I met this guy while I was in America who was really into rock climbing, and we ended up out in Colorado for a while. This must have been, oh, ‘97, ‘98?”
Harry grinned. “I just realized that since you’re a personal trainer, if you were a Muggle, you’d actually be pretty aware of them. Athletes use them as performance enhancers sometimes. I think it’s illegal though?”
Harry closed the door behind himself, looking down at the floor where the puzzle lay. “You finished it,” he said dumbly. Walking over, he took the final piece from Draco’s hand, looking at it and then up at him.
“None of our business, Potter. The point is, there’s no audio or video recording outside the main room. Can we move on, please? Now, the cabin is off in the woods at the end of the grounds to avoid distractions—”
He’d gotten a taste of it on their London excursion, of course, but it was different without Harry there to help wrangle him. Teddy was in a particularly energetic mood, and Draco thought that he might actually collapse at some point while Teddy ran on happily ahead of him. He made a mental note to start exercising again.
“Yeah. She’s sleeping now, thank god, but I don’t think I’m going to make it out for dinner tonight. I’m exhausted, and I’m not sure when Ron’s going to be here to pick her up.”
Harry unlocked the front door of the cabin for the third time in as many days. To his surprise, the interior had been rearranged and redecorated—the walls were a dark teal, the sofa pale grey and arranged against a wall with a low table in front of it, and the brick fireplace had been replaced with a gas stove. The dining table was now a hightop with tall bar stools, although it was set just as nicely as before.
“You okay?” he asked, concerned. “Did you swallow wrong?”
“I do beautiful plating of my food, I swear! But it all flew out the window the second I picked up a brush.”
“I’m fine, mate. Great work.”
“Hi, Harry,” Rose greeted. “Can we talk to you for a minute?”
Harry tried to read her expression, but couldn’t parse it. “Sure. Do you want to go into the other room, or…”
“Oof!” Draco’s eyes were bleary with sleep as he attempted to understand just what was happening whilst simultaneously getting his breath back.
Harry was shaking. “We needed people. We needed allies. There were barely enough of us to hold on.”
“Funnily enough, no.”
The first long, slow thrust burned, and Harry found himself hiding his face against Draco’s shoulder as he tried to adjust. It had been a long time since he’d let anyone do this. Once Draco was fully seated, Harry clung to him tightly, willing him to stay still.
“So what am I supposed to do, then?” she asked.
“I can’t believe we’re leaving tomorrow,” Ron said sadly. “I thought a week would feel like
Resisting the urge to push a few of the nearly-white strands out of Draco’s face, Harry crept into the kitchen, trying not to make enough noise to disturb him. He began preparing his own tea, making sure to put a silencing charm on the kettle. After a moment, he decided to make one for Draco as well; he could just put it under a stasis charm for whenever he woke up.
Someone gasped. The light of the firework began to dissipate, but was soon followed by two more. After their initial explosion, these fizzled down into the shapes of two hippogryphs cavorting around one another. Harry laughed. What followed was an impressive display of what Harry now recognized as WWW fireworks. Fred and George had perfected the spellwork over time, and the formerly chaotic production had more order to it now, painting an array of ever-changing scenes above them in bright, sparkling lights.
“Ooh, Harry, look!” Luna said, taking Harry’s arm and pointing at the board of specials. “They’ve got blood!”
“Romilda.”
Stepping back into Harry’s space, Draco wrapped his hands around the back of his neck, rubbing his thumbs in circles at the base of his skull. “Well. You’re a complete idiot—”
Draco’s eyes fell shut at the sensation of it—the burn, the stretch, the unbelievable fullness. It had been a few months since he’d done this, but he would swear that it had never been this intense. Wrapping his legs around Harry’s hips, he pulled him down until there was no space left between them at all. Breathing heavily, he opened his eyes to find Harry’s face still inches from his, his green eyes burning. Harry leaned in, kissing him again, long and slow, and Draco let himself fall into it, sliding his hands into chaotic black curls and tugging lightly. Harry groaned, pulling back just enough to ask “Can I move?”
“I guess I won’t be wooing you with my skill in the kitchen,” he managed, and Harry cackled, falling forward so that his head was on Perry’s shoulder.
“Harry,” Draco sighed in fond exasperation. “I’m just going to the loo; I’ll be right back. You won’t even have time to miss me.”
Eventually, they were stretched out naked on the bed, and Harry was above Draco again, kissing him. He found himself cataloguing the feel of every place their bodies met: his rough leg hair catching against Draco’s finer fuzz, the soft skin of stomachs skimming together, his now fully hard cock sliding alongside Draco’s, making them both shudder. Finally touching like this was heaven, and also almost hilariously surreal. To go so quickly from desperately in denial to desperately turned on was bizarre and wonderful.
Harry was seated, slumping, at the table at the far end of the room. He had a half-formed carving of what looked like it was going to be a niffler in front of him, but he wasn’t working on it; his elbows were on the table and he was turning it absently in his hands. He didn’t look up at the sound of the door.
It felt like something they’d been doing forever. It felt like a revelation. They continued kissing for several long minutes, oblivious to their surroundings. Hands buried themselves in hair and slid over muscular shoulders while lips and tongues met and parted and met again until finally Harry pulled back with a light nip to Draco’s bottom lip, making him shiver even as he fought to catch his breath.
It turned out that spending time with Teddy wasn’t as difficult as Draco had anticipated. The child was an endless well of energy and ideas, and he wanted to show Draco absolutely everything—his room, his toys, his books, his favorite nooks and crannies of the house. All Draco had to do was tag along and make appropriately impressed noises. Having been raised in high society, this was a trick he was intimately familiar with. Still, Draco had been exhausted by the end of the day, and he woke up late on Sunday, the combination of jetlag and the undivided attention of an enthusiastic eight-year-old enough to knock him out for a full twelve hours. Thankfully, his locking charm had held.
Hermione’s expression relaxed. She eyed him up and down before tilting her head in concession. “Fair point.”
“Ron’s the only one who isn’t working full time, other than Molly, and she’s with Bill and Fleur right now.” At Draco’s questioning look, he added, “Fleur’s pregnant with their third kid, and she’s too far along to manage the other two without help. Bill’s supposed to be on leave, but there was some emergency, and all the curse breakers got called in.”
“We’re going to be in a Muggle automobile for
Chris Costleigh was the oldest of Calpurnius’ children and had been involved in K&C since its inception. She had been the one to oversee the training of Draco and the cohort who had joined at the same time as him back in 1999, and she had moved to the UK to run the London office when it opened a few years later. She was a tall, straight-backed, no-nonsense woman who would have reminded Draco of a younger Minerva McGonagall had McGonagall decided to swap her robes for an impeccably tailored skirt suit and sensible heels. She’d been a wonderful mentor to Draco over the years, and he was pleased to see her.
“Fuck off,” Draco muttered into his shoulder. Harry could feel his smile against his skin. He kissed a line up Harry’s neck and then rolled off of him with an unpleasant squelching noise. “Eugh, okay, yes, that’s disgusting.”
“Fair enough. What about Monday?”
“Yes, but I suspect it was more so that they couldn’t hear me telling them to hurry up than so that we didn’t have to hear whatever they’re up to.”
“Yeah, I think so,” Harry said, letting her pull his attention back from Ron’s endearingly odd explanation. “I mean, not right away; we want to wait for everything from yesterday to blow over, and he needs to tell his parents so that they don’t murder him when it gets out. And it’s still complicated. I mean, Merlin knows Montague has reason enough to kick me off the team already; this will be the final straw for sure if he hasn’t already decided to fire me. I have to figure out what to do if… well.” He grimaced, feeling himself slump. “If my Quidditch career is over.”
“Don’t talk while we’re working, please, Harry; it can change the planes and shadows of your face.”
“This okay?” Harry asked, glancing up, his mouth mere inches from where Draco’s cock was straining at his clothes.
“Hey!” Harry greeted her with a hug as she joined him outside the pretty, rustic cabin that they’d been sent off to for the night.
Harry ran a thumb across Draco’s bottom lip and then leaned in to kiss him. “No,” he said with a smirk as he pulled back.
“What the—”
“Shit! Sorry. I didn’t hear you.” He righted the little figure and stood, pushing his glasses up slightly and wiping his face quickly and self consciously with his sleeve. As Draco moved closer, he could see that his eyes were red-rimmed.
“Go home. I need you to go home.”
“Sorry,” Perry said, rubbing his eyes, “that was shitty. In my defense, I’m in the process of being rejected.” He sighed. “I just meant… you really don’t have any sense of how people see you, do you?”
“Mmm.” Harry let his eyes fall back closed, and Draco reached out to push a lock of chaotic hair from his face. Harry’s lips turned up in a smile. The thought flitted across Draco’s mind that he could get used to waking up to this, but he pushed it firmly away.
“Yes, well, Mother threatened me with canapes if I didn’t leave.”
Draco didn’t respond immediately, and Harry could feel the panic begin to take hold. Fuck. He’d know this was a bad idea, he’d
With a sigh, he resigned himself to another night of fantasies and frustration. At least he now had that ‘sir’ echoing in his mind; if nothing else, it would add a new twist to his imaginings.
They continued to rock slowly, every movement intentional and heavy with something that Draco wasn’t sure he could bear.
He wanted more.
“So you really are in love with him, then?”
