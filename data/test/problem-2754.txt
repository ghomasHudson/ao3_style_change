“No need.” If he’s about to have his heart broken, Draco will be twice damned if he doesn’t do it with dignity. Or if he lets Potter take carefully established bureaucratic protocols down with it.
“What does that mean?”
“About my reputation? Even you know me well enough to answer that. About charitable giving? It contributes nicely to the spirit of the social season. About the scapegoating twats who turned a coerced, quite literally tortured, seventeen year old onto the streets without parents, a home, or the chance to finish his education? Not a whit.”
There are probably productive things he could do in twelve minutes. Though, upon surveying the room, he can’t see any. Which doesn’t mean that Draco won’t. He’s got an ice bucket; maybe he could carve the ice into little animals? Does Draco like animals? Or maybe he should do something in another room in case Draco doesn’t like this one.
He turned over and pressed up to kneel beneath Potter, and reached back, threading his fingers through the nest of Potter’s hair to pull him into a kiss, humming his assent into the end of it.
“Oh.” Harry looked up and smiled a smile that Draco was rapidly coming to enjoy. “That would be great.”
It may be unseemly to record this all in so much detail, but the truth is that I don’t want to ever forget a second of it. I don’t know how I can be here, feeling this, doing this, after all I’ve done, but here I am. And I find I don’t care whether the eggs are crap or the room’s too warm. I don’t ever, ever want to lose an instant of it, to overlook any of what’s transpired.
“Well,” Malfoy said. “I suppose that means you’re saved from the blobs, then.”
Harry Potter has done many things to surprise me. I’m beginning to suspect he might never stop.
Potter obeyed.
Only an hour, though. Potter was talking to Ron Weasley this time, when the slate beneath them cracked into dozens of pieces. Weasley took it in his stride, crouching to repair it quickly. Potter looked quite ready to run back to the void. He settled for craning his neck frantically until he found Draco.
“Dire though the situation may be, we are not here to remedy your wardrobe.”
Harry looked out over the water and took a long sip of his coffee. “The foundation isn’t the only thing there. You know that, right?”
.” The lock clicked open and Draco pushed the gate open just far enough for them to slip through, then closed it again.
“Yes, fuck yes.”
“Okay.” He held Draco’s gaze. “Okay.” He broke it, and walked to the door, pausing, just barely, at the handle before proceeding through the door.
The room was massive and, Harry felt, rather too bright. With its cavernous ceilings and glaringly white walls and sparkling floor and rows and rows of lights, there was nowhere to hide. Nowhere to look, even.
“But what’s in it for you?”
He licks his lips.
“Though,” Draco frowned, “We don’t know how long it’ll take, for you to translate and for us to do what the snake tells you.”
“You worried that you would get in some sort of trouble if you went?” Draco asked, concerned.
Because of the look on Harry’s face when he woke up to find that, true to his word, Draco had stayed the night.
“The thing is,” Harry said, starting again. “I’m a lot better, but I still get tired after a while. I skipped a few days of the exercises once, and it got harder to control it all, just in maybe half a week. And I still see Healer Barrett, and I still can’t really lie. Which, if you’re going to do any sort of undercover work, you have to.”
“Hmm?” Draco searched for their last shared train of thought. “Our apples?”
Draco examined him.
Without the heat of Draco’s body above him, Harry is suddenly freezing. He follows Draco’s lead, pushing himself to stand.
“He is,” she agreed, tucking Finch-Fletchley’s elbow more securely into her side. “But dreadfully handsome and has the Turner Prize. Who could blame her?”
Harry sounded heartened by that. Braver. “I’m not really ready to go.”
Potter was thick and firm and hot in his hand. Perfectly weighty, shockingly soft. Potter dug his fingers into Draco’s arms and gasped, panting and rocking his hips in time with Draco’s strokes. Draco almost moaned at the sound of Potter’s pleasure gasped out into his neck.
“Potter, on the other hand.”
“Oral.”
“All of this,” Potter went on. “This. The art.”
Draco laughed and pushed off. “And I’m moonlighting as an actual dragon.”
“I think you’ll find that Mister Snake was rather uninspired.”
The darkened carousel emerged from between the trees without warning.
“Yes, sir. He and the maitre’d are…well, favours are owed.”
Draco pulls away. Catches his breath. Listens to Harry’s gasping breath, feels the heat of his body. He kisses the tip of Harry’s cock once, and leans back so he’s sure he’ll be heard.
The look he gives me is so withering as to kill the average house plant, but at least he’s looking.
Draco sighed and levitated their drinks towards them. Pansy snatched hers so firmly that her ring echoed against the crystal. Blaise was more composed, though first among them to take a sip.
“I’m sorry.”
“Draco.
He thinks about Harry’s declarations in the cloakroom, tries to remember all the words he was too shocked to really hear. From the recesses of his mind, he pulls out sentence fragments he can almost be sure of. Things about wanting that weren’t in the past tense. Things about hope.
Harry scoffs. “Oh, is that all?”
Draco took a chair opposite. “How are you feeling?”
“I don’t think Potter knew that. Did you, Potter?”
“A boggart?” Draco repeats, eyes falling on the quivering oak wardrobe. He drops his wand arm. “What do you mean, a boggart?”
“That Auror Potter could yet harness the power of the Elder Wand.”
Harry dreamed of Malfoy that night, and the next, and the one after that, and the one after that, each night’s adventures more surreal than the last.
I don’t shiver, but I do swallow, hard, and resist the urge to stand there, watching.
“I appreciate your saying so. Thank you. I’ll let you know as soon as I’m able. Shall we practise, in the meantime?”
“Never,” Potter whispers.
Still staring down, Harry quirked his mouth into a wry smile. “Didn’t think you’d take this much convincing.”
Draco frowns.
“Malfoy? I’m sorry.”
“But she’s honest with him. What is it, 'entrap and deceive'? She doesn’t do that. Everything that happens, they always know each other.”
“You still want to bring out the ten Sickle words after all that lying?”
He was glad of her company, though. He’d been on tenterhooks for going on twenty hours, thinking every noise might be Harry coming to knock on his door. He’d begun to wonder, and then begun to go a bit mad wondering, if Harry might not come at all. If absence would be his answer, and Draco would never see him again outside of a perfunctory evaluation, if that. He’d reassured himself that if Harry didn’t come it was for good reason. Good reasons for both of them; Draco didn’t want to compromise Harry’s wellbeing, nor did he want a partner who wasn’t fully aware of what was on offer.
“Exactly.”
He could see Malfoy clench his jaw. “No. What? What do you want to understand?”
Harry follows the line of Draco’s fingers as they grip either side of the undone fabric. “Please,” he murmurs. “Please.”
“Professional,” Draco counters. “It was professional. As is appropriate in a professional setting.”
“What a shame,” Pansy went on. “You might like them.”
“What?”
“Oh.” Queasy recognition is written across Potter’s face. “Three sisters?”
Harry steadied himself on an armchair and looked up. Malfoy’s fists were bunched at his sides and his face was flushed, pupils dilated and his mouth slightly open. He was breathing heavily and his shoulders were tense. The bulge in his trousers was beginning to recede though, Harry noticed, it was still impressive. Rather like Harry’s own, which was, for reasons he didn’t especially want to consider, becoming larger.
“Let’s eat,” Luna went on. “Shall we?”
“Just men?”
“So…?”
Draco was still watching them when Potter let Granger go and turned to him, with a cordial smile that Draco was too startled to match.
Potter looks him up and down and tries for a suggestive smile, but it comes out looking a bit nervous. Draco’s puzzlement at that mix must show, he’s sorry to realise, because Potter mimics his own formality. “It’s fine. I’ve replaced everything else already and don’t want to slow your work any further. Thank you for asking.”
“Some purebloods were.” Draco’s jaw tightened. “I was a 16 year old trying to save his parents’ lives. Now I am a renowned biomagicologist who has made the Muggle study of the body central to his research and practise.”
Harry didn’t look away. “Right.”
“So I did.” Draco turned and leaned back against the railing. His features were cast so deeply in shadow that Harry couldn’t make out his expression. “That’s why I took some.”
“So I recall. But will you be able to make the same sort of effort with Phillips and Robards watching?”
“Your theory is a load of dragon shit.”
“Yeah?”
But that’s of no matter now. Harry isn’t here to complain; he’s here to practise. He pulls the cloak over his shoulders and jumps.
His breathing speeds.
Harry and Greg both looked at him, the latter blushing.
“Into what?"
Millie interrupted him. “Harry, really, don’t let Pansy stop you. She’s maybe half as quick with her wand as she is with her smart remarks. And we’d like to have dinner with you.”
“No,” Potter interrupted, reaching a hand behind him to encircle Draco’s wrist. “Leave them, come fuck me.”
She nodded, looking even more harried than she had at the start, and signed off.
“Cheers.” Draco raised his glass and waited for Millie to clink hers against it.
He agreed. There’s an “accidental” entrail-expelling curse in his future.
At half two he turned back the covers and shuffled to the window. The moon was almost new and he could barely make out the grounds, though he knew the map off by heart. The terrace gardens, the field beyond. Orchards to the left and the stables to the right, paddocks behind them. He thought of taking a Thestral out, just for the change of pace.
“Maybe.” Harry lifted his shoulders. “Is that what you want to focus on when I’ve said I’ll come up to your flat?”
Draco raised his glass again. “Cheers,” he said, and threw it back, with mental apologies to the Jameson family. He sat it on the bar. “Fancy a dance?”
Draco sighed. “Fine, then.” He glanced down and raised a hand to the single button on his jacket.
“What are you doing?” Potter breathed.
“You’ve always been an arrogant twat.”
“No, I expect not. Not doing things the Malfoy, pureblood way, remember? Even if it does have occasional benefits.”
“Merlin.” Robards leaned back. “An Auror with the power of the Elder Wand. The possibilities…”
Draco cast another Alohomara, practically under his breath, and pulled the gate back so they could slip through.
“That’s it?”
Harry inhaled deeply and blew out his cheeks on the exhale. “That’s… Wow.”
“Quickly, Granger.”
“For that,” Malfoy said.
The response comes so quickly he’s barely worn a path into the rug.
On the one hand, Draco hasn’t cursed all of his ancestors and damned him to hell or anything.
“Yeah,” younger Draco whispers. “Volunteering?”
“I’ll remember that. Do it again, properly.”
“Merlin. I don’t know. I hadn’t thought of it. England is home. I’ve never planned to leave.”
It had always been a sound, though. He hadn’t expected silence to echo.
Potter looked as surprised as he did pleased. “Oh. Right then. Thank you”
When Harry tilts his toes to brush Draco’s, Draco almost gasps. And then he remembers his resolution. If the gasp is what he’s afraid of, then it’s what he has to do.
He rolls his hips against my face; I’m beginning to think he wants me to have more of him, too. And at this angle, I can. I lick him in time with my fist, both speeding as I detect the first hint of a proper moan. He’s opening under my tongue, loosening for me, letting that tight ring of muscle contract and release against the tip of my tongue, between my lips.
“I’d rather not cast a charm.”
“Dumb,” Harry said.
“It would have kept acting up.”
“Stop that.” Potter looks up and Merlin, his eyes are even greener when they’re watering. “There’s no need to take it out on the woodwork.”
Potter laughs at that, soft and low, and Draco can’t do anything about the way his heart swells, however minutely, at the sound. “True. But you’re the one who came to apologise. Put me out of my misery, one way or another.”
Instead, he creeps closer, balancing on the balls of his feet, until he’s pressed against the wall just beyond Section G.
Potter gaped.
“Yes,” Harry breathed. “More?”
“No, nothing else.” Harry’s chest is tight. He's running short on polite chitchat.
“The Vampire Vixens, covering the Celestina Warbeck classic "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love."
Flint shifted as though to rise, but he seemed to think better of it once he got a look at his cohort.
The elves had arranged four settees around a central coffee table, and covered it in cakes and fruit and a full tea set. With, he noticed, the least fragile of the Malfoy china. He really needed to find some way to reward Galder that wouldn’t set him to prostrating himself to the point of inconvenience. Weasley sat with Robards on one settee. Head Unspeakable Croaker looked uncomfortably at ease on another, with Granger next to him. The Minister and Millie, notepad perched on her lap and quill in hand, took the third.
Draco wondered if Martin-Davies would let him swap out the Chateaux Margaux for something a bit stronger.
“Okay.”
“Force to be reckoned with, I’m telling you.”
“Magical spoonbills are exceedingly rare. The whole species is on the verge of extinction and to find a successfully fledged adult, let alone a magical one, is of extraordinary import. You see, their feathers can be used—”
“Yeah,” Harry answered. “I do.”
Harry spoke just in time. "If you're trying to reach the Aurors, you've got the wrong number."
“Just between, or are we including the ones after?” She and Blaise share a smile that almost does put Draco off his breakfast.
“And…?” Pansy prompts.
“Right then. Well. Okay. What have you got?”
Draco squinted at Potter, then made for the room, with Potter, and Granger, and Millie on his heels.
“First? My, Potter, don’t tell me all the sneaking around is what did it for you.”
She and I both know that’s not what she says when she means it. I’ve had her yelling all manner of obscenities and Goldstein’s more of a dunce than a hero if he doesn’t realise she’s more of an “on your knees,” “fuck me harder,” “if you come now I’ll slap your fucking face” kind of a girl.
He closed the bill presenter with a snap. The sound of the leather seemed, to Harry, to resonate far more than it should.
“Move it.”
Harry shook his head. “Felt like I was there, but was it…?”
Potter glanced over, but didn’t stop pacing back and forth on the opposite side of the room. Of course he wouldn’t know how to behave in a gallery. Not enough of a posh arsehole for the basic rules of decorum.
The trees stretched over Harry’s head threateningly, a few bare branches giving the moonlight a sinister glow. With a deep breath, he closed his eyes and disappeared as well.
With a groan, Draco slumped back against the upholstery, sprawling sideways and taking Harry with him, until they were wedged together on the settee.
“Mmm,” Draco agreed. “Why don’t I think that was Millie’s idea?”
Malfoy drank deeply and focused his attention on the skyline.
Malfoy doesn’t wait for an invitation, just gives Harry a look and walks.
” Harry’s eyes fluttered shut and he suppressed a moan as Draco shoved into him fast and hard. “
He nodded.
Draco gaped. “You’re mad. Give up magic?” It wasn’t the first time he’d heard a patient say it, but hearing it from Potter, of all people, ignited something in him, something outraged and disbelieving. “You wouldn’t care at all? Merlin.” He shook his head. “Merlin. Might as well take the Wand out and have done with it.”
With a final note, Draco closed the relevant file. “Any other questions for today?”
He felt Potter sit back, felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end as Potter’s hands roamed over his thighs and up his back and down again to his arse. He canted his hips, pressing into Potter’s touch when Potter grazed a fingertip over his hole. He realised he never should’ve doubted; it might not have been saving the world from Nundus, but of course Potter would be the sort of man who made sure his partner came.
“No.” She narrowed her eyes. “I don’t think I will.”
“Oh? That’s it? ‘Oh?’”
“Mmm. And?”
The bell dings again.
“Oh, yeah, Hermione?” Harry turned towards Malfoy. “Throwing money at things and holding on to dark books? I can see how he’s been instrumental to
“The charms work is consistent with patterns favoured by pureblood families. Concealment charms, primarily, with Anti-Intruder Jinxes on the drawers at the left.”
“You’re a coward.” Potter made up the half-step between them. “Always were.” He fisted Draco’s robes. “Full of excuses and accusations and fancy words, but when it counts? Nothing to back it up.”
. Just don’t, okay?”
“And then, about three weeks ago, I walked into Gawain’s office, told him about it, and gave notice.”
a letter to Dean Thomas, offering him the kind of exposure Harry knew he’d been working towards for years? Were those really pamphlets for every sort of programming Harry could imagine and then some, available to wizards and Muggles alike, together, at the same time, free of any sort of cost?
Draco winced.
“You were alone the first time I saw you.”
“You do realise—” Draco stopped. “Do you realise? That you can say no? You can leave and stay a wizard?”
“To touch you?”
be on the table?”
It doesn’t come. Instead, he twists at one of my shirt buttons, plucking it open.
And then there had been desks…
And he jumps.
“Yeah. Well. Having made this conversation more awkward than I could’ve possibly imagined, it might be best if I go in search of that snack.”
“Phillips,” the young man offers. “Right that way, sir. First left, next right, and straight on to the front office.
Luna wasn’t the sort of friend who usually bothered with doors, or expected anyone else to, but Harry almost wished he’d gone for formality when he appeared with a pop and saw everyone in the room pause mid-sentence. He was relieved it was just Luna and Ron and Hermione, though the level of nervous concern vibrating through the room had him more on edge than he could remember being in ages.
“Yeah.” Potter balanced it in the centre of his palm. “Don’t think I’ve ever had this kind of apple, either.”
“I will handle this.”
He scowled. “Maybe I like doing things the old fashioned way.”
Draco frowned and started to apologise.
Malfoy snorted behind him and Harry snapped his head around and glared. Malfoy seemed either chastened or shocked, and Harry didn’t much care which so long as he started moving again.
It’s…Merlin. His chest fills instantly, and maybe it’s the rush of breathing through the feint but it feels like something more. His heart races and he almost skims the back of a settee before shooting up to circle the area. Coming up without any sight of the Snitch, he zigs down an aisle, and another, charting courses he’s walked a hundred times before.
Granger leaned forward urgently. “We can offer you resources, assistance, access to magical artefacts that—”
Draco sighed. “Make me a list when you need things. I’ll do it.”
“I do. Your arse is delicious.” I press a kiss to his thigh. “I could eat it all night.”
"Brill!" Lee cackled. "Let's do it then, shall we?
Draco’s client clears his throat. He looks Potter up and down with such unabashed lasciviousness that Draco’s skin crawls in sympathy; he clearly wants the great saviour’s attention.
“He could’ve fucking killed you, mate.”
“Pardon?”
Harry peers over his armful. Malfoy seems to have cottoned on to the hole – oh, holes – in spite of his over-long jeans. “Oh. Sorry.”
“Heir of Slytherin Charms Slytherin Heir.”
Next to the Arabic version of the pamphlet, he noticed a folder with the gallery’s logo stamped on the front. With a bit of a furtive glance around, and a touch of guilt, he lifted the front of the folder.
As much as he wanted to stay, she’d never led him wrong. He holstered his wand and nodded reluctantly.
Draco aims for a cabinet with the Black family crest on the doors and sets it down next to the bureau just as Potter moves to step around.
Startled from his routine, Draco pauses. “They’re sorted newest first.”
“I would appreciate that.”
The intensity of it hit Draco square in the chest. He swallowed against a thundering lump in his chest. He tried to sound even. Calm. “It does.”
He’s not sorry. Not at all. There’s more thick hair across Potter’s thighs, which are muscled and trembling, just like the rest of him. He leans forward to grab Potter’s arse, catching a nipple in his mouth as long as he’s there.
“Breakfast.”
£     £     £     £     £
“Too bad,” Draco replies with total nonchalance. “I’d wager you looked good in them.”
This, Draco will admit, if only to himself, is something he thought about. Harry, naked save his boots and trousers, kneeling over him, about to take down his flies and reveal himself. Draco thought about it more than once. His cock twitches at the sight. Years in the making, and it’s just as good as he imagined.
“I…” He struggled for the words. It was all too much to wrap his head around. “You…”
Draco didn’t think it was possible, actually. Not when he was fucking Potter’s face. Not when he was lacing his fingers through the bird’s nest of Potter’s hair. Not when he tugged and could feel the vibration of Potter’s whimpers straight down his shaft.
“Salazar, even.”
“Good. Great,” Draco said. “Last time the description seemed to focus you, but if it’s distracting now let’s try without. Close your eyes and think of it. Imagine really being there, and how you would feel.”
I tried to draw back, to speak. It came out as a whisper, and a gravelly one at that. “You’ll ruin it.”
“Almost,” Draco confirmed. “Not Pansy and Greg and Millie and Blaise. Not Crabbe, either, or Theo or Daphne. They were good friends, no matter how it looked from the outside. And particular things about how my life went. I’m glad I played Quidditch, that I was a prefect. I’m glad I did my Potions NEWT. That worked out exceptionally well in the end. And there are plenty of other things. I’d like to think there were good things about me then, even if the obvious looms large. And about my life. I don’t regret it all. But I would change parts of it.” He sighed again. “You can imagine which ones. And I did change them, as soon as I could.”
“I wouldn’t advise testing me.”
“So new to the task, and you already want more.”
“Shall we move to the next?” Draco set his fork down to cue the change of course before anyone had a chance to answer. Potter’s fork disappeared from between his fingers.
Harry spread his legs further and sank down on a third finger. “Then you won’t care if I can’t speak.”
As their laughter begins to dwindle, Lupin’s portrait speaks first. “As wonderful as it is to speak with you, I suspect you have much more work to do. We’ll have plenty of opportunities to catch up now that you know about me. Why don’t you go back to your work?”
Harry nods slowly. Almost, Draco thinks, still nervously. Harry scoots down the bed, bracketing Draco’s legs with his own, and lays his fingers against the waistband.
“Really?” Potter didn’t sound like he disagreed, just like he didn’t expect Draco to say it.
It tasted as perfectly fresh as any Draco had picked as a child walking through the orchards or stopping to rest mid-flight. The hint of pear, the thickness of the flesh. Draco swallowed. “It’s perfect.”
“Why not?”
“I thought you wanted me to agree.”
“The Minister isn’t bothered about those sorts of things. Weasley, on the other hand…”
He’d skipped it just once, when Millie and Blaise dragged Pansy and Greg along with them on a trip for his birthday, all of them staying at Draco’s, which quickly began to feel quite a lot like an older, drunker, funnier version of the Slytherin common room. Pansy had come close to making up for a decade’s worth of missed shopping opportunities, given the chance to use her royalties for once. Greg had visited every museum and walked more miles that Draco could keep track of. Millie and Blaise had wandered the city drinking more than their share of coffee and wine and looking disgustingly in love all the while, and Draco could’ve bought Pansy yet one more pair of shoes for every quick-witted jibe that left them all laughing. He’d only wished it was longer, and his flat felt woefully empty in their wake.
“Rather.”
Out that door you know it’s cold and damp and when you walk through it you find it’s hushed and hard, too. You don’t like hard. There’s too much hard out there. You come here for easy.
“Is it possible that your head’s got even bigger than it was at school? Have you inspired haberdashers across the wizarding world to new widths?”
“Lie back,” I order, getting to my knees. He hesitates. “Lie back,” I repeat, ”Or I won’t fucking touch you.”
Malfoy’s professionalism is back in full force. “I have a number of obligations in this position. Tuesdays and Thursdays are the only days when I can give your project the necessary oversight.”
“Not the other way? What about you?”
“You did. I’m certain you can do more.”
She nodded. “Safe with Ron. I’ll stay until the press clears so there’s someone out of the void.”
Harry hums in response, sucking the head of Draco’s cock and it’s not even the warmth that gives Draco pause, or the softness, but the intensity of it, the sparking, shooting pleasure of Harry’s hand and mouth moving together.
but—”
He locks eyes with me, and I move, press forward until I feel his pucker against my fist. I let go and slide my cock through my fingers, further into him, and further still. I can feel his body struggling to yield to me, and it makes him so tight around me, so fucking tight, and if I hadn’t already come this would be over far too soon.
Potter paused. Draco didn’t think he looked at all surprised. “They’re under a lot of pressure, you know.”
“Not at all.”
Potter, all business, nodded at Robards and Wardwell in turn. “Of course.”
“But then wouldn’t it have been an issue before the implant?”
His robes dragged in the pile of leaves, and he didn’t hear Potter follow behind him. He put a hand to the tree trunk, then drew his wand and cast a diagnostic charm. “Not dead,” he yelled over his shoulder.
“May I?”
It worked, just like I knew it would. Like I’ve known it would.
“Yeah?” Harry breathed.
Harry has to lean forward to even see what he’s pointing out. Malfoy’s fingers smell like lavender. “That? That’s tiny.”
Pansy would fall sincerely at Potter’s feet like the rest of these idiots. Of
“You inherited a pureblood estate. There would’ve been a wine cellar, certainly, as well as a full bar. And as you can see here,” he leads Potter down the aisle, “the Black family was one of the many Pureblood lines with a soft spot for Muggle liquor. It most likely would have been hidden somewhere in the house, but it appears they had a full complement of Muggle liquor as well as our more familiar magical drinks."
Just like that, Potter sagged, dropping his arm and the leaf along with it. He held out his wand to Draco. “Thank you.”
“Thanks,” Potter replies, a smile creeping in at the edges of his lips. “I wasn’t sure.”
“Seriously, Malfoy? Are you still 11? So stuck in your own world you can’t see what’s right in front of you?”
He scoured the shelves in a panic and started flipping through volume upon volume as quickly as he could. He was still reading when Galder set a tea tray on the far end of the table, when Lobsey removed the untouched food again, when the sconces flared to life at sunset. He was so focused he almost missed the sound of heels approaching.
Instead, he rests his sweaty forehead against the edge of the desk and puts all of his energy into breathing.
Malfoy looked exactly and not at all how Harry remembered him. His jaw was just as sharp, but it moved with less viciousness. His eyes were as bright, but not as cold. He wore jeans and wellies and a sweater that had been pulled over a shirt, and while Harry thought it might be cashmere it was more clearly evident that Malfoy had been in such a rush that half the collar of his shirt had got caught and remained stuck down beneath the wool. It was clearly posh, but unaffected, and Harry wasn’t sure what to make of that, but he thought he could feel the bird’s chest rising and falling against his own, and that was something.
He’d wanted to say it, or at least to try.
“Well done.” Draco smiled, and Harry met it.
Potter’s lungs sounded clear. His heart rate was still quicker than Draco would’ve liked.
When Flint yielded some fifteen minutes later, Marchbanks rose and announced special testimony from Harry, describing him as, “an expert whose duties to the Ministry made him unavailable for open public comment at the time of the second reading,” and called a voice vote to yield the floor. The ayes were overwhelming, though Draco noticed Flint and a few others keep their mouths firmly shut.
The beat. You’re here for the beat. You can still feel it at your back. When you push him off you and to the wall, when you brace one hand at each side of his head, you can feel it in your palms.
“I’m fine.”
Harry could barely breathe at the sight before him. Malfoy was shackled to one of the interrogation room’s heavy wooden chairs. Someone had got him one of the coarse grey uniforms prisoners wore while awaiting trial. Harry didn’t even know if that’s what Malfoy was now. A prisoner. Or if it has been a nod towards propriety, or if it was meant to make Malfoy look guilty from the off, or if someone else had got as distracted by the bare planes of Malfoy’s chest as Harry had.
She knew that I meant it with Harry. It was her opener, once she’d tucked the Hallows back into her robes. An accusation. “You think you love him, don’t you?”
“Perhaps I should, then, beg your pardon on account of an exceptionally busy few weeks.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Well, then?”
“I’m less certain of that,” Draco answered. “Probably not straightaway. And actually, Pans, maybe I’ve spoken too soon. Having the option of the void might continue to be advisable.”
V          V          V          V          V
"It seems I've Vanished something, I'm afraid."
Draco relaxed, awash in relief and the tiniest bit of disappointment. He nodded for Harry to go on.
“He is. Re-fledged, then. Since his injury.” Draco looked at Harry significantly. “Sometimes it takes more than one go, especially after such a deep wound.”
“Okay?”
“He most certainly did,” Pansy interrupted. “Shall I introduce you?”
He managed, albeit shakily, to flip Harry two fingers and give him some ghost of the Malfoy smirk.
“And, not to be a broken record, but you, know, it would be okay—the good ones are good. We should enjoy the good ones, don’t you think? And I just—it would be nice to see you happy. To see you…I know you’ve been fine, you’re okay, and that’s good, but it’s okay to want more even though—”
"I've got a mobile at the ready." He fished into the pocket of his robes and returned with the slim white iPhone.
It’s everything he can do not to squirm.
Potter eyed the length of silk. “No. You agreed.”
“Stop it,” Potter insists, trying to pull his arm free.
support in his campaign to become one of
The touch wasn't gentle, not even at first, but neither was it overwhelming. Malfoy's hand was firm and certain, and Harry took the cue to follow it, holding Malfoy's eyes as Malfoy came to stand right in front of his chair. Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
He doesn’t expect Potter to be so demanding. He doesn’t expect the clash of teeth or the persistence of Potter’s tongue, doesn’t expect Potter to suck at his lower lip. Doesn’t expect the humming moans that escape Potter’s mouth when he pulls Draco’s body against him.
“You want me to shut up while you do it?”
“I’m fairly certain you’ve just told Blaise,” Draco retorted.
“Okay.” Draco walks forward on his knees and takes the tube from Harry. It’s his favourite kind. He wonders if Harry’s remembered that, too.
Definitely amusement. “And why did Granger take such barbaric action?”
, Draco’s brain offered. That made sense. Potter might pity him. Or maybe he had the hero’s urge to rescue, and it overrode all sense. Maybe this was the sort of thing Potter
H. I. J.
“Or you could just have me fuck you.”
“Mmm, delightful.” Potter eyes the head.
She laughed. “Neither that trying nor about to become that much more interesting. Only one is for me. One is for the elves to take to Greg, even if he’s not the gala type, and one is for you to take to Harry.” She held a flute out to him. “He’s starting to get a little peaky from all the attention.”
He might’ve fumbled it again, so I planned to kiss him properly this time. Get him weak in the knees. He’s implied that he rather lacks experience in this area; I didn’t think it would be difficult. We were standing a foot apart, I tilted my head and parted my lips and brushed them against his.
“No. Or yes, but only incidentally. To have this.” He twined his fingers between Harry’s and squeezed. “To do this, together.”
Draco let his pants and trousers drop, and followed Harry in stepping out of his shoes and socks so they were standing, facing each other, naked.
“Okay?”
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “Me too.”
He thrust back again, trying to encourage Malfoy’s fingers to hit the necessary spot, and when it came close he released a low, promisingly sibilant, “Yesss.” He pulled his head up and faced the box, swallowing heavily and sliding into a series of low moans when Malfoy’s fingers sped up.
The hare dissolved. Harry had the feeling it had been more than a wildlife fact, but even for Luna it was cryptic.
“Leora has been… reticent, in the past. She feels it’s… well, in any event, she’s… unavailable to us.”
“Course.” Draco leaned his head in and rested it against Harry’s, then turned just enough to press a kiss to his cheekbone.
“It was the politic thing to do,” Draco defends.
Draco was determined to go back to sleep on that note. Except the sound of the Floo was bloody irritating. And sort of…off.
Hermione rested her hand on Ron’s arm. Harry strongly suspected Ron would pull away if he tried the same.
There is a glimmer, there, of something. Something that feels, if not good, at least better than the other options.
But he
Draco hummed and put the shield up.
“Mmm.” Harry groped for Draco and one corner of his mouth quirked into a smile when he found, and draped his arm over, Draco’s waist. “Thanks.”
Harry was almost side-tracked by the non-answer, but filed it away for later and continued on. "Do you have need of or interest in favours from any Ministry personnel?"
“Yes. I placed my friends’ and housemates’ safety over the Hippogriff. Can you blame me if you think of it like that?”
“100 miles?” Harry tries to estimate their proximity to Malfoy Manor. Wishes he’d paid better attention in…well, primary school, so the knowledge would probably be lost by now anyway.
“No?”
The sight of it does something to me. I have to think of anything but this, of—, of—
Higsbee arrives so quickly, Draco half wonders if he deserves a raise.
Either way, the rain kept Draco from walking the ten minutes to Sola. He had been relying on the walk for a chance to clear his head, but at least—thanks in no small part to generations of Malfoys past—there wasn’t a Michelin-starred restaurant in Paris that didn’t have an Apparition point.
Harry nodded and hugged her, gently guiding her away from the bathroom in the process. “Not if we can help it, promise. And we’ll come find you as soon as it’s done.”
Potter’s face darkened. “I don’t care.”
Croaker huffed, his face taken on shades of Granger’s
He replaces his wand. Potter is still staring at the now-clean spot, his mouth hanging open just far enough for Draco to be tempted to stuff one of his quills into the gap.
Draco couldn’t help looking at him like he’d gone a bit mad, but he took it and let Harry push it in.
He moans, quietly at first, as I take one into my mouth and let it drop again, moving to lave the other, and back again. He bucks against me. I do my level best not to do the same to the mattress.
This kiss is slow, deliberate. When Harry opens his mouth, he’s met with the soft heat of Draco’s tongue. He takes Draco’s hand in his and squeezes, and feels the pressure returned.
“That was a medical question, not a pleasantry.”
“So it is about him,” Pansy said.
“You’ve got no idea what you’re on about.”
Draco didn’t know quite what to make of her.
“Okay.” Draco felt himself relax just a bit. “Good.”
The exit from the gallery to Diagon Alley had sealed itself at midnight.
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
“More,” I whisper, leaning over him. “That’s more.”
A voice emerged from Harry’s left. “
, if you’re that concerned with getting a bit of Malfoy on you, you’re perfectly free to leave without the records.”
“Speed is of the essence for you, I realise, and I freely admit that this is a less expeditious option, but you may find that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. At a minimum, professional obligation compels me to ensure that you are aware of all the alternatives before committing to a surgical option that is likely to have serious and lasting effects.”
Harry had worried about the same thing once or twice, when he’d shut his Floo and spent whole days at a time alone after the war, out of reach for anyone but Hermione and Ron. He’d needed that, though. That peace. “Maybe. It isn’t that easy to find, though.”
“No, it’s excellent. I’m very pleased that you’re trying new things. Besides which, it’s completely in line with the atmospheric charms we’ve already tried. Did you use a wand?”
“What?” Millie prompted, with a skrewt-handler’s cautiousness.
He groans. “Yes, fuck me, suck me, please, just do it.”
And Merlin, but it was electric. Warm and strong and all-consuming, and Draco didn’t know how long it was, exactly, before he felt Harry’s hands at the front of his robes. “Can I?”
“The things you might need to say to Granger?”
“Rita Skeeter wrote her post-war ‘tell-all.’”
“Fine.” Potter grabs the napkin from Draco’s hands.
He swallows audibly, and remains stock still otherwise.
"Please, Potter. I'm cashmere, you're..." he trailed off, gesturing up and down with his glass, gin threatening to slosh over the edge. "Jeans and plain white t-shirts."
Potter nods, his breath coming quickly, the vein just above his collarbone pounding.
He saves it by perching on the arm of the chair. “And a drink? Would you like a drink?”
Besides which, it’s a shocking lapse from his employees. The
“I’m—” Draco thought of half a dozen objects. They all died in his throat. He wanted to. As much as he didn’t want to want to. He compelled himself to move forward, though his legs felt strangely loose, as if they might fall out from under him.
“We in the Department undertake a number of magical research projects as, again, you may be aware.”
“Yes.” Malfoy blinks. “Far less offensive. Though you do look like an overgrown sixth year.”
“I suspect we should wait on trying anything new. I have started work on a list, though. Would you like to discuss that?”
“Mmph.” He rolled over and took the pillow with him.
“Oh.” The syllable barely makes it out of Draco’s mouth.
Malfoy’s lips were pressed together so tightly Harry could barely see them. “Posh arseholes make the world go round.”
have lasting side effects. Potter will either be less able or less inclined to use magic.”
“Yes,” Harry said, and that, at least, felt true.
Silence.
“Maybe you were just being rude.”
Draco narrowed his eyes and refused to answer.
Potter looked out the window. “I got that letter you mentioned.”
“For now. What else is going to change?”
“And,” Pansy asked, “how’s the sex?”
You keep saying this,” Blaise interrupts, “that it’s better this way. Why?”
“Just for that, I’m keeping these.”
Potter exhaled, and took a shuddering breath in. “Like your fingers inside me.”
“What are you going to do about it?” Potter stepped closer, his breath shallow and quick.
“The blobs?” Draco asked.
he’s probably incompetent with a surveillance spell and would have no way to say, send a team to retrieve the photos or, you know, bring you up on criminal charges for attempted blackmail.”
“Is this actually why you asked me here? Because your note said—”
“Except total humiliation.”
Draco shrugged, fighting sudden self-consciousness on top of his nerves, and repeated himself. “Why not?”
Draco drops the letter and raises an eyebrow. “You can’t tell?”
“Yes.” Draco smiles, reaching to pull down the quilt. “Harry.”
This made sense. He could do this. This made sense, and he didn’t have to think. His body moved and his mind was blank, and he didn’t have to think about Malfoy.
He perched on the edge of the bed. There was a tightness in his lower back and an ache at his temples, and he gave himself permission to lie down.
I swallow my outrage at that “all right.” If he’ll only say my arse is all right…well, it’s a good thing I’m a man on a mission. “You’re telling me you don’t want to be fucked because you lack proper hygiene?”
He crossed one leg over the opposite knee, buttoned his shirt, and waited.
“Yes,” Harry managed, and then, “Please.”
Draco walked around him, running his hands over the curve of Potter’s biceps, sliding over the planes of his back, reaching around to trace the ridge of his ribs and the thin indent in musculature that led to his flies. It was more than he had expected. More muscle, more tension. More overwhelming.
“Everyone would say you walked on clouds, if asked.”
“Hiding in the presence of Gryffindors? Really, Draco, must you fulfill only the worst parts of the Slytherin reputation?”
Draco stares at the note. Reads and rereads and wishes there was more of it. Wishes there was anything to go on, other than the implication that Potter will be here, to see him, presumably to talk, though maybe to smash more bottles.
“I’m so, so sorry. I told you.” Frustration tinged Potter’s voice. “And you can’t put those back with a spell, they’re just gone, dead, look at that, the tree, what if it killed the tree?”
“Just a suggestion.”
“I can hardly have him leave in this condition. Imagine the damage he could cause.”
,” she whispered. “
Draco hums and reaches out to grope the bedsheets for his discarded belt. He thinks Harry is wrong about that. He also thinks the brooms can wait.
He could’ve come just from that, he was sure, and then he felt one of Harry’s hands slide up his thigh, to the crease of his arse, and up, a finger tracing up his balls and finally wrapping around his shaft. Draco whined, low in his throat, and canted his hips for more.
“Do you think that was true for him?” Hermione’s voice was low and tentative.
Draco raised his hand. "If I may? A suggestion?"
“Yes, well,” Draco continues, feeling some obligation to defend his magical heritage, “the Magical collection is quite impressive as well.”
Draco freezes, unsure that he’s heard Potter correctly. Sudden-onset rage can distort one’s hearing. “Pardon?”
“It’s not the same thing,” Draco insisted, his voice taking on a new edge. “You’ve been fighting this all along, Mill. How can you turn around and say it’s nothing?”
Once convinced, he’d thrown on a t-shirt, his best Muggle jeans and an old leather jacket he’d picked up in le Marais fixed his hair, and been ready to go before the rest of them. Pansy had been last down, in a strapless leather dress that was as scandalous as it was gorgeous, even by Draco’s standards, and Blaise and Millie had Side-Alonged them to the beach.
“Harry,” he replies, softly.
Harry nodded. “You’ll stop it again, if it needs stopping?”
“I’ve cleaned them,” he mumbles, helpless to fight the blush that’s blossoming over his cheeks.
Potter’s mouth moved against his, and he felt as though he should move in return. That was what one generally did. Kiss back. But this couldn’t be a kiss. It was impossible.
“You sure? You’ll tell me if anything…?”
“If you’re unwell it’s best for you to leave.”
“So much.” Harry draws the waistband of Draco’s trousers down a fraction and sucks on the skin just above his hipbone.
So of course it was Harry on the other side.
He didn’t remember the walk to the foyer, but he wound up there anyway. Galder was waiting, and did him the not-so-small mercy of not asking any questions, instead declaring that he would send on Master’s things and tell Mistress Pansy and Master Greg that he had left and sent best wishes, and that Galder was at his service at any time.
“Look,” Draco repeats, gasping. And he is looking, and trying to breathe. “Looking.”
Draco didn’t bother disagreeing. He caught Potter’s hair between his fingers and tried to pull him back to the task at hand. “Yes.”
"Are you talking in your sleep?"
Luna takes my hand and drags me to the edge of the sea. I think we're in Crete somewhere. Luna loves the Mediterranean Sea. The sand is fine and bleached white. The sea is a beautiful clear blue.
"Harry," I breathe, gripping his hand.
He remembered tackling Draco, taking wands from him, and a hurried whisper.
Draco!" I raise my voice. "I
" he murmured, moving to Harry's other wrist.
There are raised voices coming from the room where Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook were kept. Frowning, I walk through the open door.
Arthur follows me to Draco's room. He's fidgeting, but I feel calmer in here. I don't understand why.
“And I’ve checked my schedule.”
“Mmm,” he breathes, nodding.
Because Harry is very good at omelets, and it turns out they go very well with Draco’s fruit.
“What? You’re kidding me.”
“No, sir, no. It’s just–it’s quite a long time, but not in the way you might suspect.”
“It’s remarkable that you can do it for so long, magical outbursts or not.”
“If we take the Wand out, then?”
“We have been following your work,”
Harry takes in his meaning and looks more than surprised. “You want to see my room?”
Twilfit is magnificent. Almost as magnificent as her work which, Draco thinks, may be magical in effect as well as construction. She’s chosen a lapis that he never would’ve given a second thought—almost sent straight out of his office, truth be told—but that looks superb with navy and silver trim, and is cut to perfection.
“Well then, problem solved.”
“So close,” he gasps. “Please fuck me, please, don’t stop.”
- Aside from these signs – usually minor abrasions, un- or inexpertly healed, no more specific indication as to where he goes. Longbottom claims Fidelius keeps him from disclosing.
“Good afternoon,” Draco offered. “I trust that Kate has made you comfortable?”
“Yes.”
, he thought, and then the deep black sky and its million stars overtook him.
The charge that had been building beneath Harry’s skin skittered through him. It felt like sparring, like the moment before an ambush or a thunderstorm.
“Raise your knees for me?”
I told him I was in love.
The mission to seduce Potter is proceeding well enough, though his routines don’t make it easy. I’ve determined that he does tend to work in the library in the afternoons, though rarely without Granger’s company. He also always arrives to and leave meals in the company of one or both members of the ugliest “hot young couple” to grace the wizarding press in decades. They, and the rest of his followers – they really should have called it “Potter’s Army” – have made it difficult to get to him alone.
“How…? How, exactly?”
“Yeah, okay.”
He reached out for Harry, twining his fingers through his hair, running them through again and again. And then Harry pulled off and opened his mouth wider, and Harry took him in all at once, and Draco missed it for arching back, groaning, panting as Harry worked up a rhythm.
Draco did his best to hide his confusion. Potter’s abilities were far beyond what he had expected. “Right.” Draco broke off a spring of the yew hedgerow that grew at the border of the path to his left. “
“Do you want to try once more, with love?”
“It is, but that’s kind of the point, I think?”
Draco reached into his robes and pulled out a card. He slid it across the Minister’s desk.
And wouldn’t Potter be delightfully defiant about
By the time he’s regained his equanimity, they’ve moved on to other topics.
“Well.” Draco shifted in his seat. “To be entirely candid, I’m fairly certain you’re not going to like it. And, as you’ve already made your choice, it’s not relevant, is it?”
And then I press up and it comes out in almost a scream. He drops the duvet to slam a fist into the headboard and looks at me with such bewildered desperation.
Harry isn’t satisfied by it, though. Instead, he pulls Draco closer to him, his nails digging in to Draco’s shoulder blades, his calf wrapping around Draco’s leg.
“Anal.”
Unfortunately, I panicked. Told him I missed him.
Malfoy turned with more grace than he had any right to, and Harry might've remarked on the cosmic unfairness of that, if he wasn't completely occupied with taking in the swell of Malfoy's arse under the bottom of his coat. He ran his hands back and over it, feeling the firm muscle and watching, fascinated, as Malfoy tightened and then relaxed into his touch.
“Pardon?”
Draco paused, but couldn’t see any harm in admitting it. “I did.”
“Ah. Well, thank you. Anyway, in the hope that something would click I redid all of the initial physical tests this morning, but outside of the void and without you and Granger there. Just the two of us.”
Then Draco pulled away and Harry whimpered, bereft, stopping only when he felt the head of Draco’s cock press against him, and Draco’s body fold over his owns. “Ready?”
“Isn’t it though? Probably ought to be punished for it really,”
“Yeah. It did.”
And he goes. Pulls the flesh into his mouth. Scrapes his teeth against the tendon. Tastes the bitter remnants of aftershave and soap, the naked promise of skin.
He shakes his head again.
“Why?”
Malfoy frowned. “It’s good for Muggle-wizarding relations.”
“You’re the one who’s got to perform, Malfoy. My arse will be in fine condition.”
“To…make things better, I suppose. I’ve told you this.”
Harry grimaced. “I think you just have.”
“I found it downstairs,” Harry went on. “If you can never fix it, why are you doing this?
“That’s not—”
“Work?” Malfoy repeated. “I imagine you’re as familiar with the task as I am.” Malfoy gave him a considering look, then scanned the room, seeming to judge the distance of the diners closest to them. “Not that I’m averse to a more in-depth discussion. I would, for instance, be curious to know what evidence was sufficient to convince the higher-ups to propose certain recent initiatives.” Malfoy punctuated the question with a raised eyebrow that looked so much like Wardwell’s that Harry wondered, momentarily, if the Unspeakables gave lessons.
There will be banners, we’ve decided, hung across Diagon Alley. He’ll charm them to open at the conclusion of his speech. I suggested we continue on, one more night in the streets together.
Higsbee hesitates.
“Spanking.”
“Malfoy, I’m just curious.” Harry could see Malfoy shake his head furiously, but if he said anything Harry couldn’t hear it.
“Yes.” Draco sets down one letter and takes up the next, ignoring Pansy’s crossed arms and pout.
Draco bucks into him with a throaty groan. Potter doesn’t back away. He hums his approval and meets Draco’s hips. He raises one knee to steady himself, braces a hand against the cupboard, and opens his throat. They establish a rhythm, Draco fucking Potter’s face and Potter urging him on with a flick of his tongue. Potter’s fingertips dig into his arse to pull him closer until Draco is gripping Potter’s mad, flyaway hair and chanting, “I’m gonna come, fuck Potter, I’m gonna shoot down your throat, fuck, you’re gonna taste me for days, fuck, fuck, yeah, like that,” and Potter still doesn’t pull away. He smiles around Draco’s cock and buries his nose in the blond curls at Draco’s base and hums and sucks until Draco comes, gasping for air and yelling for Merlin. Potter sits back and waits until he catches Draco’s eye, pointedly swallows, and grins up at him looking so fucking
Minutes later, he felt Harry jerk again, and this time Draco followed him into sleep.
“No,” Draco replies. He’s so different to how he was on Thursday. It’s weird, just
Draco waited.
"Now, lovely listeners, as you know, we've added a bit of magic to keep things interesting! Wherever our contestant lands… and - STOP!" Jordan bellowed.
The pause before he turns to go gives Harry just enough time to eke out one creaky syllable: “Stay.”
“Almost as though you haven’t shared the entirety of the thought,” Blaise adds.
“Brooms?” Harry looks to Draco first, then to Phillips, wondering if perhaps one of them has a shrunken set somewhere in their robes.
“What will it mean for a child, to be tried for proof of their blood status before they even enter the Great Hall?
The snake, its eyes closed and tongue flickering, brushed Harry’s face. “
He pushed back from the table, eyes still trained on Malfoy. “Yes?”
“You seemed so sure yesterday.”
“To extend that metaphor: over time, the musculature around the eyes weakens. The wearer becomes more dependent on them than they would’ve been previously.”
Potter laughed, a short huff. “Is that how fruit works?”
Malfoy sighed. “Potter…”
Malfoy was slumped forward, his arms resting heavily on the table, his head hanging between his bent shoulders. He looked exhausted, Harry thought. Defeated.
Draco let Pansy’s voice wash over him.
Harry wasn’t sure where to begin. The idea of using Inferi… He could practically feel their cold fingers wrapping around his ankles just for hearing the word. And then, the idea that someone might think that Squibs
He looks for the other arm, wonders if Potter’s habits have changed at all. Then realises his arm is concealed. By Jordan. Realises it’s not just a picture of Potter sucking cock; it’s a picture of Potter sucking someone else’s – Lee Jordan’s – cock.
“This is…yeah. This is.”
“No,” Harry laughed. “To the hexing. Yes to the date.”
He nodded across the room at their former schoolmates. “Them. You’re so calm about it. Is that a bit of head-tilting, too?”
She shifted uncomfortably. “You weren’t, then?”
Draco and his colleague have forbidden any spells unrelated to the trial and they’re all sweating by the time Phillips announces that the trial can begin. Harry’s newly glad the heat refuses to break, or else he might be the only one wiping beads of sweat off his brow.
“He named them though,” Greg piped in. He shrugged at Draco. “Figured a celebratory ride wasn’t out of line.”
“Right.” Draco took a shuddering breath. “You’ll tell me if anything hurts at all?”
“The St. Mungo’s Benefactor’s Ball. You will escort me. You will be impeccably dressed and entirely charming. You will convince everyone in attendance that you are completely enamoured with me, while I convey relatively warm, if residually sceptical, feelings towards you.”
Pansy flushed, and he could tell her voice was carefully controlled. “England is my home. I won’t let them drive me out.”
. That kind of ability doesn’t go away. Besides which, we know it hasn’t.”
” he repeats.
"Not going to turn around?"
He steps down the aisle, away from Draco. If he can’t smell him, that will help. If he can’t see his hands, that will help too.
“Assume, for the moment—difficult though this may be—that we’re trolls in disguise, wholly incapable of putting the pieces together. Why?”
All he can feel are fingers wrapped around his arms, his wrists, his shoulders, like so many Inferi pulling at him, until he slips under icy cold waters.
Easy.
He was curious.
I told her, of course – perhaps through gritted teeth but with no less certainty than usual – that she need only beg if she wanted me to break in her arse.
“Count of three.”
.” The latch on the stall door rattled before the rope rose. Potter held it in the air. “Enough?” He bit the word out through a clenched jaw, which looked to Draco as though it was straining.
“Yes,” Draco drawled, reassured by what he found to be a fairly convincing imitation of nonchalance. “Master returns.” Unease still coiled in his chest, but the appearance of ease was deeply ingrained second nature. “You may stand...” he trailed off, failing to match this elf with a particular name.
Potter made a sound Draco’d never heard from him before. Surprise, maybe.
Draco bit back a smile. Six years of astronomical success at Barclays had got him a bit used to leaving people speechless, but seeing it on Potter’s face came with an extra edge of nostalgic charm. “All a bit unfamiliar? Fine, then. How did you get here?”
He thinks of Malfoy’s back, as yet unmarked. Wonders if a shoulder blade would be as satisfying as the inside of a knee, or the arch of a rib.
*  		*  		*
“Whoever it is, best not keep them waiting.” She stood and held out her hands, helping him to his feet.
This afternoon got considerably more interesting.
*          *          *
“Rumour is that Robards’ wife is deeply devoted to root vegetables.”
(or so)
They repeat the same routine in coffee and side tables. Draco lobs furniture at Harry. Harry dodges it. He tries making jokes, too, hoping to jar Draco from his unwavering focus on a row of folding tables and nightstands.
“No.” Potter’s blankness didn’t budge.
It was a matter of minutes, then. Seconds, even. Potter kept his eyes open, and Draco looked back, and saw the flush on Potter’s cheeks and the hint of a smile at the edge of his mouth, and Draco came so blindingly hard the world flared at the edges and distilled down to just that image, burned into his memory forever.
He could do this, this simple mechanical task. One step after another. Lift a knee, twist at the waist, extend, push off. Repeat. Repeat.
“Do you have the key?”
Still. He had wanted to know badly enough to go back this time.
“I don’t think you will.”
No. It has to be true.
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“Yeah.” Harry looked away, his eyes on the ceiling.
Draco, peeking between his fingers, looked towards the bar and let out a plaintive moan, flattening himself over Harry to, it seemed, try to hide behind the arm of the settee.
Tawny owls are England’s most common. They are, therefore, a popular choice among those who lack imagination, those who have every desire to blend in among the masses, and those who send communiqués to wizards living in the Muggle world with any regularity. Potter fits into all three categories, but tawnies are so damn common nowadays that Draco doesn’t think anything of the bird perched on the ledge of his office. Just opens the window to shoo it towards the mail room.
“Is that everything?”
He almost gave up when Padma came from next door to tell him it was DMLE headquarters, not a bloody zoo, and he should get a damn charmed mobile like the rest of the world. When he asked her about Malfoy, her glower turned into something he couldn’t quite place and she went on a bit about how they’d barely known each other then and while it hadn’t seemed particularly pretty, how was she supposed to know?
Warily, Draco hands one over.
“Binns?” Draco raised his head again. “A pay rise? What for?”
Potter’s voice took on an accusatory edge. “You said you respected my choice.”
Draco couldn’t bring himself to argue the point when one of his favourite among Potter’s talents promised to make itself known. He hummed instead, and leaned his head back against the wall. “Get on with it, then.”
Draco shifted again. “Of course. Are you feeling unwell?”
“Harry.” Luna’s voice was calm and steady. “Do you think people are capable of change?”
Separate piles.
Thinks back to the ways he’d justified it after. No more demands to throw over the women his parents insisted he escort to fundraisers. No more having to watch Harry’s face fall when he promised
What if Harry feels like a stranger?
He pauses. Lets out a breath. “Yes.”
– Dead, Azkaban.
“I guarantee you, I’ve had more interesting lovers.”
“Shhhhh,” Draco hissed. “They might not have seen us.” He pulled Harry around a plump Wizard in an unusually tall hat. ”Just stay quiet and we can get to the door without –“
When we joked about it after, the charity stuff, was that a lie too? Cause it seemed like things started to change between us then. You were being more honest with me, not sucking up and following me around and stuff. And all those Quidditch games. You really did seem different. Less angry, less like you were trying to push me away. Like you wanted to be there. Like you liked taking the piss which, for Merlin’s sake, Draco, I liked it too. There aren’t a lot of people who will just treat me like that. Like a normal person instead of the saviour. And you always have, except when you’re taking the piss about that too. Do you know how much I like that you’re just you around me? That you hate doing charity (even if you were beyond an arsehole to that old lady) and you make fun of everything and you’re not walking around just pretending like the war never happened? It’s not that I didn’t know you might have been trying to fuck with me, but there were so many moments where I was just sure that you weren’t. Where I liked spending time with you so much, and then wanted you so much, that it was worth it to take the chance. And it seemed you liked it too. You smiled, and sometimes it seemed like you were scared the same way I was. In a good way. Like when I took my shirt off, on the pitch that time. I’m glad you weren’t just grossed out, though I guess I know that by now. But I was scared, cause I would’ve – I wanted you to touch me then, already. And I think, having read all this, that you wanted to, too, and you were just scared of what it meant. But were you really that angry afterwards? Was it because you were being a bad Slytherin, or because you were being a good one?
“More than waiting for a letter that I’m then not allowed to open, full of medical advice I’m not supposed to take or, apparently, know about, even though you and whoever wrote it already do.”
“Fully intend to keep my word on that.”
“What, do you have Acromantulas down the other end?”
“How do you propose that we best accomplish that?” Robards asked.
“Mmm.”
At last, he tucked his wand into his robes. “That’s all for the day. Shall we go inside?”
Except I still am, a bit. Madame Pomfrey says it’s normal for you to take some time to heal from injuries like this, and that she has to keep you asleep, but that we won’t know the extent of the damage until you wake up. And I hate just seeing you lying here like this. I’d rather tell you all this in person.
Wardwell hummed her agreement. Potter gave another brusquely professional nod, and Draco noticed that the tilt of Potter’s head seemed to include him in the gesture.
That made more sense.
“Alright then. Do try not to destroy anything, would you?”
The yew dropped to the slate.
“Exactly.”
“Oh. Yeah.”
, whatever you want.” He went from carding his hair to tugging at it. “Look through them, see if anything jogs a memory, if there’s anything you want. We need to solve this case. Legilimency has never been my strong suit. If I can’t guess what you want, tell us? Name your price, and if we can meet it, we will.”
,” Draco retorts, his patience evaporating alongside the specks of saliva now dotting his counter, “you should file a complaint with the Office of Boring Paperwork. Surely they’re better suited to investigating mislaid sex toys.
“As I wouldn’t have needed to do if you didn’t work in a glass box and live under nineteen different enchantments that probably aren’t even registered w–”
“Yes.”
“It can wait.” Potter paused, seeming to search for the right words. “I— I was thinking of what someone said to me last night, at the party. It was something about trying things, being willing to see things in a new light. I didn’t want to do that at first, but…I think they were right.”
“I do.” Draco answered, pushing Potter’s jeans down his thighs. “And you will.”
He slipped in beside Harry, who was gushing over an elderly witch whose granddaughter was apparently well on the way to single-handedly revolutionising the role of the Beater.
“There were then, too.” He opened his mouth to object; I dropped a hand from the wall, pressing a finger to his lips. “Come now, Potter. You haven’t arrested me yet. What’s another day?”
He was better rested than he’d expected. Even two long wanks hadn’t been enough to put thoughts of the Ministry out of his head. He’d tossed and turned and had a dreadful time falling asleep. Between dreams and the long process of calming down once they woke him, he hadn’t fared much better once he managed it. At three in the morning he’d cancelled his breakfast tray and told Galder not to wake him till noon.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. “Oh.”
Potter sat cross-legged in the middle of the rug, surrounded by the cat and her kittens. He looked up, and the smile fell off his face. “Oh. I was expecting Lobsey.”
“Which doesn’t grant you insight into… whatever. It’s up to you.”
The office was right where Harry remembered, though he felt more disoriented than he would have if he’d been trying to find somewhere entirely new. The gallery felt like a maze and he found himself unsure of how anything connected to anything else, and he was pretty sure that wasn’t the product of a confusing layout. He hadn’t had any trouble before, after all.
“Yes,” Draco said simply.
She started to shake her head, then paused. “You’ll tell me more, or have him tell me more, as soon as you can?”
* * *
Draco’s first order of business was to take copious notes. His second was to call Granger.
“He emerges,” Blaise intones, passing Pansy a pitcher of mimosas.
“Even if those do contribute to my happiness.”
“Potter,” Draco said, to no avail. “Harry,” he tried again. “Harry!”
“I know that,” Harry answered, but even he could hear that there wasn’t much conviction behind it.
“No. I don’t think so.”
“Does it change the way you feel?”
That fucking Hallows charm was hanging from her fingers. She’d knocked the circle at its centre totally out of alignment so the sheets were dusted with a fine white powder, though clearly an adequate amount had reached its final destination.
“Nevermind,” Harry said. “It’s not—I—I don’t even know yet, and, anyway, I—If you have a moment, I—There’s something else I’d like to discuss.”
“Pansy,” he tries again, softer this time.
“That was luck. I could’ve done real damage.”
“Hermione…”
Tonight brought the next stage of my plan: properly socialising with our saviour.
“Bloody buggering fuck.” Malfoy turned and strode from the room.
“That’s –
I’d be happier about it if it undid the actual curse, though. It matters a lot less if you won’t wake up. Madame Pomfrey took you off all the potions yesterday and said you can wake up any time, but that you won’t until your body’s healed enough. That it could be just a day or two more of rest, or it could be that you lost too much blood and were out for too long. It’s not that I’m not still mad at you over some of this stuff, but I don’t want that awful conversation to be the last one we ever have. And I still really need to know if you were telling the truth, for sure. And I really want to tell you I love you again, so you can hear it.
Harry frowns.
“Thank you,” Draco said. “For everything.”
“I wanted to ask you something.” Anxiety flashes across Draco’s face and Harry rushes to assuage it. “Not something bad! I don’t think so, anyway. I mean, you might, but, okay. Look.”
“The Minister’s Office was required to consult you to ensure minimal disruption. In this case that means Millie, and Merlin knows you’ve never had a problem holding back with her.”
By the time he’d caught up, Harry’d moved on.
Potter stares at him and doesn’t move to leave.
Harry sat on the hearth until his legs were numb. Then he Summoned parchment and a quill and wrote another note.
“Until you get your own Robards and Croaker.”
My stomach drops as soon as the words are out.
“Hmmm.” Draco unfolds it, draping the fabric over his chest as he examines the hem. “How fortunate. There’s a label.” He glances up. Potter’s eyes are locked onto his chest. He runs a hand across the fabric. “Often is, in older, custom-made items. ‘Lavinia’s Linens, Made for Elladora Black, 1873.’ Fairly conclusive. Here.” He holds it out for Potter, who shifts back nervously.
“I don’t—”
Draco thought it best to redirect. “Pansy, that would have been a useful observation to share at the time, don’t you think?”
“Hey,” Harry offers.
yesterday. “The Boy Who Grieves.” Utter tripe, but hard to miss, and a major lapse to have let it slip my mind.
“Malfoy.”
“And as you saw earlier,” she continued, “Draco’s in the process of beginning practical rehabilitation so that Edgar will regain full use of his wing.”
“Kingsley sent me a note after we met. Cho, too—it was the one for kids to learn Quidditch, she’s in charge of that. Both hoping I’d be there.”
They stood on opposite sides of the doorway until the sound of her heels receded down the hallway.
“Potter, I realise that you are not renowned for your intellect, but isn’t it possible that going to pub night and setting out to get drunk may not be wholly incompatible?”
“That’s right.”
Then he pushes back against my face, grinds into me with a desperate whine, and I’m coming, coming, spilling all over my hand, all over my trousers, moaning into him, and the vibrations only seem to urge him on.
He’s in front of the wards at 6:58. He knocks at seven on the dot.
I lead him through a thicket of trees. He is clearly having misgivings, but the trail is short. Soon, we're standing in a large clearing. There are wildflowers everywhere. Directly ahead are several house-like hives. Luna painted them a long time ago. They look like little cabins.
Maybe it's time to come clean to Blaise and Pansy? Especially considering Potter almost kissed me.
He snaps out of his shock and turns on his heel. Thank the gods. I was briefly worried he would be an ass about it.
"We could. Ron and George have free time after the shop closes and Bill is a professional curse breaker. Luna and Ginny are both free too. I'm sure they'll be eager to help." Hermione looks at the book thoughtfully. "I'll send them all letters."
"That brings me to another matter... Harry, don't you think you should retire from being Malfoy's healer?"
"I don't know. Draco asked for a moment alone with Lucius. When I went back to the room, he was gone. I only left for ten minutes." Arthur starts wringing his hands.
"It's okay, Mother. I'm glad you're here now." I swallow roughly. "What were you looking for?"
"I heard that." Blaise smirks. "I look forward to working with George. Don't let me down, Weaslette."
"Orgasm denial spell. You can't cum until I lift it."
He heard Voldemort lie about how Harry had died. Heard Neville defy him. Heard the taunts and jeers.
Hermod holds out his leg. I tie the letter to it and give him an owl treat. "Fly safe."
"You keep bees?"
Closing the door behind me, I have to drag Ron back upstairs. He's holding a red envelope in his hands. A howler.
A mist of gold envelops me. It tingles on my skin. Every few moments, the mist gets thicker. It feels like it's straining, pushing against something.
Granger narrows her eyes, watching me. It's almost like she knows how I feel about him. I immediately close off my expression, donning the Malfoy mask.
I know this is just fanfiction, but I want to be clear. I stand with BLM and I always will. As for transphobia... well, Rowling has severely disappointed me. I'm agender and demiboy. I'm not a woman just because I happen to menstruate. My pronouns are he/them. Trans rights are human rights. I'm not sure if I'll continue writing Harry Potter fanfiction after BooT is done. I probably will be focusing on my original novel.
He seemed surprised. I guess he was expecting grandeur, but I hadn't wanted that when I moved out. I had chosen a large piece of land in South France. There are plenty of trees around my small home. All different kinds. I need them to work with.
"I like it long," I mumble after a moment. "I take better care of it usually."
Ron looks uncomfortable as Hermione disappears through the door. Silence falls.
I grin and we situate ourselves so I'm spooning him. I hold him to me and kiss his shoulder.
I wish I had known then what I do now. I wish I could have protected Harry from all the abuse he dealt with. There is something I can do now. I can be here for Harry. I can be supportive.
"Would Snape do that?"
"I think you probably have time for a quick conversation," I say, folding my arms.
"Wait, seriously?"
Harry stared at Draco, stunned - not because of the proclamation, but rather he could feel the blood rushing to his face. He thought all his spare blood had gone to his cock.
Draco moved down his body, his mouth finding spots that turned Harry into a wanton mess. Draco wasn't even being rough with him, every kiss was soft, every drag of his teeth gentle.
After a lot of bribing (Pansy has dibs on being our wedding planner if we get married) and threats (I'll let Luna design our dress robes), Pansy finally agrees to take Harry to Crabbe so they can all bring him to the aurors. I have been forbidden to go with and I have to go meet with Healer Powell anyways.
My eyebrow raises as I lean against the window. "Did we?"
The fifteen-year-old Harry throws magical instruments in a rage, catching my attention for the first time. I've never seen him so upset before. I glance at Harry who shrugs helplessly.
There's a soft pop and the butterbeer is replaced with a firewhiskey. I smile a little and down the drink. "Speaking of, I almost kissed Draco Malfoy tonight."
The cottage is filled with warmth and light when we arrive. It's a little surprising until I remember Minty. She is bustling through the living room, dusting a shelf when Luna opens the front door.
"This is something Harry should tell you himself, but I'm going to explain a bit first." I lean back in the chair and look at the ceiling. "Anthony has been abusing Harry for months. Mostly, from what I gather, it's emotional abuse. That's what Hermione says anyways. He justified controlling him by claiming Harry was more likely to cheat on him because he's bisexual."
It takes a moment, but then we are in a dark room. Weak light from the moon is pouring in. It takes my eyes a moment to adjust. I glance outside, but even the moon seems dark. Almost like it's shrouded in smog.
I grin. I can't help it. It's nice to see my family all together and getting along. I just wish I knew where Blaise and Pansy are.
I'm holding Draco tightly to my chest, shaking my head. "No. Draco didn't want to go there. If he is stable, there's no need. Mione, do the spells?"
For which I’m more than thankful. For the past four years, their friendship has been the best part of my life… until Harry.
I open my mouth to say more, but my voice fails me. Instead a broken sob escapes my throat. Harry holds me tightly as I cry into his neck. I can feel him shaking too.
"I won't let anything happen to you," he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lucius and I run to Draco's room. I hear him shouting about someone locking him in a room and ripping out his hair.
"Luna… you came." Draco's voice sounds faintly surprised.
There's a woman magically suspended in the air. She appears to be unconscious. My stomach sinks further as I recognize her from Hogwarts. I've never spoken to the muggle studies professor, but I've seen her around.
would affect Luna? Your mother? Me? Or even Harry? You are so loved and you are refusing to allow anyone to save your life! We are all going to be heartbroken if you die!"
"No, nothing is wrong… I just… I was getting close and that just isn't happening until I get to pleasure you too."
"It turned out fine. Yes, he did that interview, but he still can't come near you or hurt you again. That's a win in my book."
A long silence follows her words, only broken by small sniffles. Luna stands up and hugs her. I've never thought of it before, but Luna is like a pillar of support in this family. It makes sense - she has always been the type of person to see into the heart of something broken and put the pieces back together.
"Draco is right," I hear myself say, looking at the tray of food. It's almost half empty.
He didn't want to think about Snape any longer.
(See the end of the chapter for
I look up at my father. His face is twisted into a sinister smile. I don't understand. The ice is spreading. My vision is getting dark. I think I'm dying.
Harry stumbled out of Snape's memories, mind reeling. So, that was his role in all this. It wasn't just that Voldemort had 'marked him as an equal'. There was a piece of Voldemort's soul inside of him. Harry was a horcrux.
I stare at Harry. I wonder how that played out. I'm a bit scared to ask, but Harry seems calm enough. If there had been a fight, I would have woken up.
Thank
Draco hummed in acknowledgement.
Yes, dear Readers, this reporter was as shocked about it as you are. As we all know, Mr Malfoy is a convicted Death Eater, who spent three months in Azkaban for his crimes committed during the Reign of You-Know-Who and the War. Since his release, the world has not seen much of him but it is rumored that he has made a close acquaintance with one Ginevra Weasley - famous Quidditch player and once a sweetheart of Harry Potter. It is very likely that Mr Malfoy has used this “friendship” to sneak back into Mr Potter’s life.
Standing up from his desk, he slips his arms around my waist, pulling me closer. I melt into his arms. Honestly, after five years, I would have thought some of the magic of being with him would wear off, but it hasn't. I'm still as in love with this man as I always have been.
I decide to let Ron explain. I'm more interested in looking out the window. My room has a good view of the street in front of the hospital. I should be able to see Harry when he comes back.
I don't wait for him to respond. I just clap him on the shoulder and leave hurriedly. Luna should be done with the potion by now. I really hope this works and we can break the curse over Draco. But even if it doesn't, I'll keep searching for a way. I won't stop - he simply means too much to me.
Harry could almost see it. A life with Draco. Children. A big family. A house filled with love.
Dumbledore finally arrives. I lean against Harry as the prophecy is explained, the bottom dropping out of my stomach. It's ludicrous because Harry is completely fine and well beside me, but I can't help fearing for him when Trelawney says that either Harry or the Dark Lord must die.
"I just…" I swallow. "I just need to confront my fear, right?"
I take another bite of bread. I will never say so aloud, but she's right. Ever since I was a child, I loved my hair being brushed. My mother used to stroke my hair to soothe me to sleep and whenever I cried.
"Stay safe."
"Harry, what's going on?"
All this begs one question:
"No."
"Alright. I'll meet with them. But… you were already able to schedule the procedure? Before they even met me? Before I even had the consultation?" I ask, taking a calming breath.
"No. Let go of me," I hiss, grabbing his hand. "I don't want to see you ever again."
I nod and watch the final memory form around us. We're in a kitchen and there's already a fight going on. Harry has his back against the wall. Goldstein is crowding him against it.
"Draco," I murmur. "Should you be taking that potion? We don't have to have sex, but your heart…"
A behaviour most unlikely for our Golden Boy.
"I like you, Draco. That's why I'm using your given name. I want to get to know you better," he murmurs.
"Manhandling his healer is
"Blaise and I aren't dating," I say, folding my arms.
"You do?" I ask, kicking at the floor.
"But the scent isn't Draco's," he finally protested weakly. "Draco smells like iron."
Harry hastily obeyed, desperate for more. He wasn't entirely sure what more was, but he trusted Draco to give it to him.
"Explain why my son is here!"
I open my mouth to question her sanity, but she conjures a tray, bowl, and mug in front of me. Then, she fills the bowl with soup from her wand. Tea fills the mug next. Mrs. Weasley doesn't give me time to speak. She takes a piece of warm buttered bread and puts it in my mouth.
"As soon as we can… I want to sneak away with you. There's probably somewhere in the castle that hasn't been destroyed where we can have privacy," Harry murmured, speaking into his ear.
"Arthur, can my father and I have a word alone?" I ask.
"Wait… what?"
"Elliot wasn't happy. He saw me leaving with Anthony. He lectured me for about fifteen minutes." Harry sighs, handing us each a mug. "Finally, he allowed me to get a word in. I told him about DAISIES and he was relieved... but..."
"Why would I?" Draco shrugs. "Either way, I was in trouble. I couldn’t hide from the Dark Lord. If I tried running, he'd kill my parents. The only thing I could do was to wait for Amycus or Alecto to come. I would be punished, but I deserved it anyway."
Harry shook his head. "You look normal. Like the pointy pale git you are. I just can't think straight with you so close."
His admission startles me, but only for a second. When his words fully sink in, I can’t help the smile.
"Yeah. Bill came by while you were sleeping. The curse is broken." I hesitate for just a moment. "You are the bravest man I know. I can't even imagine how terrible that was for you, but you still kept going until it was done."
"I think that would be a good idea. Hermione can give you a referral." I kiss his shoulder again, pride swelling my heart. Draco has come so far.
"How do you know that?" Ron asked wearily.
"Just make sure your clothes are on before Hermione comes back." Ron winks at us before taking a book and leaving.
"Like I said, he's insane. Harry broke it off with him and he doesn't want to accept it."
I can't hear anything. My heart is thundering in my ears. I feel hands pulling me up. The person wraps their arms around mine.
filthy, but Harry wanted more. Every time Draco's tongue moved, Harry moaned around his mouthful of pillow. Draco hadn't even touched his cock and he felt like he was going to orgasm.
"Why not?"
"I'm going to tell you something. You can't tell my parents or say a word about it to Pansy yet."
The rest of the conversation turns into a loud buzzing. I pull a pillow over my head and try to block it out. The noise stops abruptly. Thank the gods. As I drift back into sleep, I feel someone lift my head and tuck the pillow back under it.
"We need to talk, Harry. Mr. Malfoy, can you wait in your room, please?" Elliot doesn't wait for an answer. He just walks off in another direction.
"How is this relevant?"
"You have such a filthy mouth," I purr, running my thumb over his swollen lips. "I should wash it out with soap."
"And Potter?"
I pause, grimacing. Luna forced her friendship on me after the war. She apparently grew fond of me when I kept sneaking down to the cellar to bring her food and water when she was being held prisoner at the manor. We did talk a lot during that time.
"You were very brave, Draco. I'm proud of you," he murmurs.
"Quit fretting, I'll stay with our lovely little dragon." Ginny grins as a flush spreads over Draco's delicate skin. "I heard your dad calling you that an hour ago. It's cute."
Morgana. Ron is right. I need to break up with Anthony.
Malfoy was barely breathing. He had to do something. There wasn't enough time to get to the hospital wing before Malfoy died of blood loss.
I remember vividly how scared I was, but I had been so desperate to save my mother, I would have let him kill me. Anything to not have to hear her screams anymore.
"Dreams are a great place to manifest whatever we want," Luna interrupts. "What song was it?"
Turning in his arms, I meet his half lidded gaze. His eyes are bloodshot, but they have a surety about them that I haven't seen since fifth year. I reach for the bedside table and grab my glasses. I need to see him clearly.
I tip the potion into his mouth, just remembering it now. Draco swallows it all. His face smooths out a bit. He stops clutching at Zabini's arm.

"What?! I didn't sneak! Please, let me go!" The little girl starts begging, thick streams of tears falling down her cheeks.
"Well, someone has to. You two need your strength for your stroll down memory lane." Ginny shrugs. "I need your help with Ron. He's insisting on helping Blaise and George with the howlers, but I'm fairly certain he's not going to like what he sees if he does that."
Draco's hand moved further up his chest, resting right over his heart. Harry pulled Draco down until he was lying on top of him. They froze in the middle of their kiss.
"Sounds like a plan," I say, smiling faintly.
"Blaise is protecting him from old habits," Ginny says when no one else volunteers any information.
between us."
"Well... the other things I want you to know first are that I'm sorry that Anthony showed up here tonight, I'm sorry you fought with him. It must have been... unnerving to say the least." Harry squeezes my hands. "The last thing is I really like you. I had a crush on you in Hogwarts... but now I really, really like you. I want to be with you and only you."
Watching myself crumple to the floor, I feel the rush of panic through my body. I hold the petrified wood my mother gave me tightly. The familiar thrum of my family's magic pulses against my fingers. It's soothing.
"How are you and Ginny doing?" I need to change the topic before my nerves cause another episode with my heart. It's already beating faster than it should.
"That's going to be a change. Are you sure you're prepared for it?" Harry asked, looking at Ron.
"I…" he clears his throat. "I'm sorry. I didn't know you were so miserable."
Potter hears her despite her whispering. I feel him step closer to us. Then, he crouches next to me. "I'm Harry Potter, Malfoy's healer."
"Love, are you alright? You look peaky." Harry places his wrist against my forehead.
"Did you just notice the engagement ring box that you've been pressing into my ear?" I can't stop myself from teasing him.
"I am fine. Pansy woke me up from a nightmare and gave me the potion before it got too bad," I reassure her, but she still frowns. She's counting the irregular beats over and over again.
"How can you possibly know that?" Draco's voice comes out as a whimper.
Harry's eyes meet mine. For a moment, his expression is unreadable. Then, a gentle smile forms on his lips. "You know… that sounds ideal to me."
I've never told him I'm gay. Blaise might have kissed me in front of him, but… I feel my heart leap to my throat. That wasn't my father. That had been Crabbe. Crabbe had watched Blaise kiss me.
"Okay... how about you tell me what happened from the beginning?" Hermione suggested.
I'm tempted to pull his hand away - make him come untouched - but I'm going to do that when I tie him up tonight. Instead, I obey his demand and pound into him. Desperate moans fill the study.
Harry grinned, assuming that meant yes. He decided to let Draco have a minute to settle himself. Instead of trying to move, Harry watched his mate in fascination. Draco kept flickering between his normal self and his veela.
"Are you sure? He has so much trauma there. If the curse is working by attacking his heart based on the trauma, he would know he should avoid the manor as much as possible." Luna tilts her head, looking worried.
(See the end of the chapter for
I smile a little and touch her hand as the familiar diagnostic magic washes over me. It's quiet for a moment. The sound of Hermione's quill scratching notes onto the parchment beside her is all I can hear.
Draco's mouth started at his nape. Harry could feel the press of his mate along his back as Draco's body covered his.
"I don't want to think about it."
I felt the sense of comradery with Draco as soon as I heard Anthony's nose break - it was so satisfying, I couldn't help it. I actually like him enough to consider him a friend now.
"Well... a few were unaccounted for and some were released." Granger tilts her head. "Didn't you know that?"
Harry was certain he would never tire of kissing Draco. He loved everything about it. The small sighs that escaped his lips, the way Draco pressed him into the bed when Harry sucked on his lower lip, the way
"He was my only hope. The Dark Lord was torturing me and threatening our family. You were too busy trying to get in his favor to see what was going on," I say quietly. "I didn't switch sides when I gave Harry my wand. It happened long before that in my sixth year."
Draco's words surface in my mind.
"If you don't, I'll have to get creative," Amycus sneers, pointing his wand at the girl. "I've gotten a few ideas from our lovely headmaster."
