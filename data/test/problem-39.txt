“Aww,” the crowd lamented in disappointment, but then dispersed to go dance or find other people to exchange body shots with. Harry decided to be opportunistic and sat in Draco's newly vacated – and still wonderfully warm – chair.
Then all their attention turned to a woman floating upside down over the table. She had displeased the Dark Lord by not only teaching Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, but also by writing an article for the Daily Prophet encouraging the Wizarding World to not just accept and tolerate muggleborns (and even muggles), but ALSO marry them and have children.
He was staring with nearly murderous intent at Harry until this line came out of his mouth: “The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”
Draco sneered, knowing that Harry loved Hogwarts too much to risk getting expelled. “Yeah, like you'd dare do magic out of school.” Then sheer curiosity took over. “Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.”
He had done it! It worked! Draco had succeeded! This news was enough to have him shouting in glee and dancing all over the place. His mood wasn't even dampened when that imbecilic Divination teacher walked in and nearly caught him, but he managed to get behind her and evict her from the room before she even had a chance to see him there.
“Sorry Harry,” Seamus called out from the Gryffindor table. “It's just that none of us can recall if you can sing. Also, you usually tend do avoid doing things like this.”
The moment they were out of the bathroom, Snape cast a lightening spell on him, scooped him into his arms, and practically flew him over to the stairs, down two floors, and into the hospital wing. Draco was still more or less out of it when he was tucked into a bed and Snape explained what happened to him. Madam Pomfrey quickly got to work and Draco fell asleep – probably a magical one brought about by the Mediwitch.
Seeing someone who interested him, Draco strode confidently up to the bloke. Halfway there, an enormous man who looked like he could be paid to pick normal sized men up and tie them in knots with his bare hands stepped in Draco's path. He was leering most unpleasantly and dared to grab Draco by the arm.
Harry looked stunned, but that didn't stop his next song from being sung. “Oh you're a loaded gun, yeah, oh there's nowhere to run, no one can save me, the damage is done, shot through the heart and you're to blame, you give love a bad name!”
Draco slumped onto Harry, almost knocking them both over. “I really can't tell you. All I can say is that I was told to do something and I HAVE to do it or the people I love will pay the price.”
At one point, James2 got his grandfather alone and asked his most pressing question: “How in the bloody hell did you Marauders pull off the Portkey Prank of '76???”
Narcissa – having a lot more practice at taking insults with grace – placed her delicate hand on her son's shoulder. “It's alright, Draco. I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.”
Draco sat near the back of the Leaky Cauldron watching in amusement as his friend Blaise persuaded (flirted heavily with) Hannah Abbot until she gave him permission to introduce a muggle phenomenon call Karaoke to the Wizarding public. Once he had permission, he jubilantly rushed over to a decently clear area and expanded it a bit so that he could set up a small platform for a stage. Then he conjured up a microphone that was magically connected to the speakers he conjured up to go with them.
Then Draco pumped him full and literally passed out on top of him. At first, Harry simply thought that he was recovering from an orgasm and its accompanying lethargy, but no. Draco was well and truly out.
They looked over to find Peeves lurking at the very back of the alcove. Exchanging a concerned look, both wondered if it would be worth the waste of breath to try to convince him to go away and mind his own business. Both ALSO wondered if they could cast a spell on him to scare him off – or at least hex his mouth shut.
The lesson was... weird. It consisted of Snape trying to break into Harry's mind and Harry trying to defend himself – and supposedly in the process, learning how to defend his mind from such attacks at all times.
This made Harry wonder what she planned to do, and if he still had any sort of obligation to stop her now that he was no longer an Auror. With a shrug, he decided that unless she threatened the pointy git's life, he'd just ignore it and let things play out.
Madam Malkin must have thought that offending such a famous customer might have undesirable consequences, because she protested: “That's quite enough! Madam, please...”
Draco slipped out of his bed and tried to be as silent as possible as he summoned a pair of his favorite pants and pulled on the silky cloud of softness. Then he turned to look at the man in his bed. It was still a bit strange to him that he allowed
Draco threw a pillow at him. “Fuck you, Potter! I'll consider speaking to my parents again when they apologize for the last – OH... – three or four YEARS of my life!”
Potions with Slughorn – later that day after lunch – was fairly boring because Slughorn kept fawning all over Harry – and by extension, his friends. Miss Know It All was showing off again, and even telling their very Slytherin Professor that she was muggleborn (she means Mudblood, Draco said to Nott, both sniggering) managed to lose his interest. He was very quickly turning out to be a disgrace to Slytherin House!
So, Harry made excellent use of his Auror skills by arranging an 'accidental' meeting. In a lift. That suddenly and inexplicably broke down the moment the two of them were alone inside it.
Then she turned around with a chuffed smile and strutted to Draco until she could grandly present him with the mug.
He quickly told them the plan and gave them their orders, more than a little smug that the Dark Lord had specified that Draco was in charge and that they were to listen to him and – more importantly – NOT get in his way as HE did what he was supposed to. Still, as confident as he was that he could lead anyone through anything – having superior blood to almost everyone here (especially that mangy Greyback) – it was one thing to lead them and quite another to actually do the deed.
As the world seemed to fade, Draco stared vaguely at the ceiling, but still managed to see Harry's grief stricken face hovering over him. His hands were out like he wanted to grab Draco's hand – or perhaps his whole body – but was afraid to make things worse.
Harry looked over to see Auror Ginger pretending to down a shot of something. She then looked over to Harry and Ron to let them know she was actually sober and fully aware of what was going on. Then her look turned challenging, reminding them that they were supposed take some of the potion. A quick feel of their pockets revealed plenty of Galleons to help them party rather a lot more than strictly necessary.
“Deal!” Harry agreed enthusiastically before trying to steal Draco's soul via a kiss. After that, they fell into bed and didn't plan to leave it for a long time. Except...
Draco was silent for a long time. He didn't fidget, nor did he hold Harry in return. He simply... let his mind go blank. After a long time – perhaps even a couple of hours – he took a cleansing breath.
After Harry was dared to give Draco a blowjob and dragged him to the Potions' ingredient cupboard to do it, Draco is given a dare of his own...
After everyone laughed for a bit, James put a hand on Harry's shoulder. “So, son, aside from marrying a pretty blond arsehole and having a LOT of kids, what have you been up to?”
When Harry arrived in front of Draco, Lucius was trying to protect his son with his very body, but Narcissa was smiling softly at Harry, her hand gently tugging Lucius away. Harry stopped short, simply staring at Draco for a long moment. Draco simply stared at Harry in return. So much he wanted to say, but none of the words would form in his utterly bone dry mouth.
Draco looked at Harry, noticing that Harry now looked afraid that he was about to be tossed out on his arse and never talked to again. He wrapped his arms around Harry a bit tighter and shook his head.
Just when Draco reached for Harry's belt, he managed to remember that they were in a rather public place with no real guarantee of privacy. He stopped Draco by grabbing his wrist. Draco looked upset to be denied.
By this point, most of the other Professors were able to join them. The way Final Exams were spread out during normal years – 5 out of the 7 years had to take their exams during normal class time, as obviously the OWL and NEWT students took theirs separately. But since Harry was monopolizing the entire Fourth and Sixth Years for an entire day (possibly two depending on how things went), the rest of the teachers were only able to test the first three years. Which meant they had a bit of time to come and watch Harry's exam.
During the summer between First and Second Year, Draco got so bored that after ordering all his house elves to dance and sing with him for the hundredth time, he lay on his bed and wrote on his arm.
He then looked over and noticed Harry giving him a concerned look. It took his mind a moment to clear away a foggy feeling, but then he sneered. “As I was saying,
Alright, so it wasn't a perfect plan, but it had a chance, and that was more than he had with this Merlin cursed cabinet!
Then he decided that his best bet was to use all his lurking and sneaking skills to avoid all attention, especially any sort of battle. Unfortunately, a fully masked Death Eater spotted him and didn't care who he was. Based on his size and shape, Draco suspected that this was Rowle, taking advantage of an opportunity to get back at Draco.
Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart. “Really, you shouldn't accuse – dangerous thing to say – wands away please!”
In the meantime, he occupied himself with tearing the entire Prophet into minuscule pieces. Thankfully, he didn't have long to wait – or unfortunately, depending on how you looked at it, since he didn't have time to calm down. Harry arrived home about ten minutes later with Ron and Hermione in tow.
Draco smirked. “I'm leaving something to the imagination to entice you with. Maybe you'll come back sooner.”
But then he recovered his composure, or at least his blustery anger. “WHO SAID YOU COULD FOLLOW ME AROUND MY HOUSE, POTTER?!”
Draco promptly pressed his lips together, picked up his wine glass and took a sip from it, and then looked at Scorpius (ignoring the fact that he was still in Harry's lap). “As you were saying?”
This was highly intriguing to Draco. So much so that he lost all track of who was singing what. Pansy went a few songs later, deciding it was time to up the heat in the room by singing a song that had NO illusions about not being sexual. She sang a cult song called
Draco felt about a thousand percent better than he had last night. He smiled at Harry and gave him a kiss. “Good morning.”
Before Terry let him pick a slip, he held up a hand. “Also, no one should be allowed to say what their dare is until after it's performed. I should think half of the fun will be watching people do crazy things and having to guess what the dare was.”
Since no one was currently looking at him, Draco looked over at Harry, who despite probably not being able to see clearly due to the fact that his eyes were almost swollen shut, compulsively looked over at Draco. They both knew what Draco had done to those two at Voldemort's command. Also, it was the last time they had written to each other. Hastily, both looked away.
Harry made extra sure that both Ron and Hermione were asleep, and then pushed up his sleeve and stared at his blank arm. Once again, a massive amount of confusion filled him. When he'd been dating Ginny, their few stolen hours alone had filled him with a happiness he'd never known. Even relatively recently, when she'd taken him aside on his birthday and kissed him, he'd felt a need to get lost in it.
Astoria giggled as the drop was placed on her nipple. “My sister told me all about this place and we agreed that I simply HAD to come here at least once before our parents insist that I get married and be a good little wife.”
A couple of days later, Draco could just spit fire! He was outside their potions classroom as Pansy was regaling them all with an article in Witch Weekly – all about Hermione Granger being Harry Potter's girlfriend and toying with him by playing with Viktor Krum's heart too. He and his fellow Slytherins watched avidly as The Golden Trio read the article Pansy tossed at them, but rather than get upset – or give any indication that it wasn't true – Hermione simply smiled and waved.
He'd been Marked and given an important mission. If he succeeded, he would secure his place in the Inner Circle and redeem his father's mistakes. If he failed, the Dark Lord promised to kill him. In all honesty, he was probably expected to fail – as that would be the ultimate punishment for his father.
Rather than state the obvious – not even in a snarky or sarcastic way as was called for – Harry chose to roll his eyes. “I was trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir.”
Nearly the whole month until he had to go to King's Cross passed before he realized that he hadn't received anything new from his imaginary friend. Had he or she stopped existing? Excited and nervous about this new chapter of his life, Harry did something he'd never done before: he wrote first.
As the potatoes cooked, he grabbed the Prophet that had been delivered that morning but he hadn't read yet.
Narcissa stood up. “I'll go too. Please, my love, please just rest and get better as soon as possible.”
Amelia gasped in delight. “Ooo! I bet that was when daddy was walking into the Forbidden Forest in order to let Voldemort kill him!”
Harry laughed. “Well I didn't think it would be a good idea to make the Maze up of nothing but dangerous magical creatures that the students had to defeat, and so the challenges require a little bit of everything.”
Unfortunately for Draco, he only made Harry all the more angry when he made fun of Hagrid to Umbridge. And then angrier still when he made fun of Ron on their way to the next class. At this rate, Harry was definitely going to punch him again!
As summer wound down, Draco still felt quite a bit of pain from his Mark. He could bear it just fine if nothing touched it, but even the slightest touch sent hot sharp pains shooting through him. Thankfully, he'd seen his mother wearing short sleeves enough over the years that he knew that she didn't have any sort of mark on her from when his father was Marked. A quick read through the information on Soulmates reassured him – prior to receiving his Mark – that only intentional messages got through.
Meanwhile, Peeves was rolling around near the ceiling in manic anticipation, rehearsing a bit of a ditty to sing during the distraction.
“Don't go just yet! I've been trying for ages to figure out how to ask you something, but I think that no matter how I ask it, you'll get mad at me,” Harry rambled on.
To Draco's amazement, Harry kept his word. He was so determined to have Draco in every way possible that he spent hours worshiping him and working him up. Draco gasped in astonishment and fell apart at least three times before finally
The dummy must have been magicked at some point to help the student, but now he barely had enough magic left in him to murmur a bit when Draco picked him up. Draco carried him over to the piano and – using all his new repair skills – figured out how to return the dummy's ability to talk. As he suspected, it was charmed to spout reassurances and compliments.
“Right,” Ginger agreed. Then she patted the mostly naked boys on the backs. “Good job tonight. I think we got about as much information as we could've expected. Ron, be a dear and make sure Harry gets home without propositioning the first person he comes across on the way.”
It was a bit of a gamble, but since the Room of Requirement was apparently one of the places that the fighters were using as a home base, chances were good that Harry would come here eventually. And he was right. Harry showed up and it took Draco keeping a firm grip on their arms to keep them waiting until the right moment.
Rather than run off like he wanted to, Draco studied his sexy black dragon hide boots. “You think about me?”
Strangely excited to have something in common, Harry told her all about his class and his practice pots. Looking genuinely happy, Narcissa summoned her personal elf to bring them her pottery wheel – which she duplicated – and several kilos of clay. Lucius watched in bemusement and a sense of surrealism as they proceeded to spend the entire afternoon making pots.
Anaya put a hand on his arm to comfort him. “I don't think daddy will really be mad, so he'll stop dad from murdering us.” When they weren't in school, they often called Draco dad, even though he technically wasn't for most of them. Being married to Harry made him sort of their dad, and so they considered him that when he wasn't terrorizing them as their potions professor.
Not needing to be asked twice, Harry grabbed his cloak and rushed off to the same classroom he and Draco had been occasionally meeting in for months now. Draco himself looked almost demonic with a weary red tinge to his eyes. They had barely shut and locked the door when they flung their arms around each other and simply held one another tightly.
The two of them were almost frantic, tearing at each other's clothes in their haste to be together as soon as possible. The moment they were both naked, Harry cast all the quick prep spells that Draco had taught him on himself. Then he lifted himself onto the nearest desk so that he could pull Draco into him and wrap his legs around him.
Draco was utterly grateful that the castle was more or less empty during Christmas hols. It gave him the opportunity to basically camp out in the Room of Hidden Things the entire time. Even when he ordered (via message coin) the Imperiused Madam Rosmerta to poison the bottle of her finest Oak-Matured Mead that Slughorn had ordered to give to Dumbledore for Christmas, with a very lethal poison. Unfortunately, nothing he did to the bloody cabinet worked.
Draco couldn't help but blush and feel a little guilty. “Oh come now, mother! I'm 21, surely you can't expect me to be entirely celibate.”
Harry wasn't sure whether to say anything or not. He was about 90 percent certain that the poisons all flashed black, red, or some combination containing black or red, and so, this shouldn't kill the irritating git. Instead, he shook his head.
Rather abruptly – and completely unexpectedly – the lift stopped between floors. Obviously, its doors did not open, and so, they were trapped. Draco just barely suppressed a growl of frustration.
Hermione couldn't help but giggle, which she hastily covered with a hand. Draco turned to glare at her. Harry simply spun around to see what was so funny, even as Ron was giving her a look that said: they're nutters, the both of them!
In desperation, whenever he needed a break, Draco took to using things hidden in the room – such as a magnificent piano that insulted the player whenever they missed a note – to relieve his stress. In one moment of pure madness, Draco dressed up in a gaudy Victorian whore's costume and sang and danced his little black heart out.
Harry tore at his hair and roared again, this time from frustration. “You're not LISTENING!!! I'm trying to tell you that I AM bloody fucking happy! YOU make me happy – despite pissing me off on a daily basis – and I want YOU to keep on making me happy for the rest of our lives!”
After a hard battle that Harry wished he'd had an unrestricted view of, Voldemort disappeared and tried to possess Harry. While literally inside Harry – and considering what had just happened, Harry actually felt a least three times more violated by this thing forcing his way inside him – Voldemort taunted Dumbledore, telling him to try and kill him while inside the boy.
Harry abruptly pulled back so that he could strip off in a great rush. When Draco realized that Harry was stripping rather than calling things off after all, he grinned and grabbed his wand out of his pajama pocket to cast a spell that had all his clothes fly off him (and then fold itself and form a neat little pile). The moment they were naked, Harry pulled on Draco as he flopped onto the large cushion.
Harry seemed to read his mind and shook his head slowly back and forth just one time each. “I only want one thing from you: How did you give Katie that cursed necklace?”
Encouraged, Harry opened his mouth and used his tongue to lick Draco's open too. This pulled a happy little grunt from Harry. They both got lost for a bit, simply kissing and exploring each other's mouths. After a bit, Draco pulled back to look at Harry suspiciously.
Harry was moaning and rubbing Draco's back encouragingly. Pleased that things seemed to be going in the right direction, Draco kept pushing his luck. He worked open Harry's trousers and pants until he could work that thick and puffy shaft with his hands and mouth. Harry gasped and arched his back as this never before experienced sensation made his mind practically explode from the pleasure. Just when he was getting close to orgasm, Draco shifted his mouth again.
I feel like I cheated you out of some really hot sexy times, but literally JUST as I got to that part, my son came in the room to chat and completely killed the mood. Sorry! However, the real point was to get the boys together and the smut was just added for fun anyway, lol ^_^
See, he'd been forced to deny it for so long that he'd come to believe it. Despite being bonded to Draco Malfoy, he could never admit it. They could never be together. And yet, when he was alone at night, it was not Ginny he thought of. Not Ginny he longed for.
The two of them paused to kiss for nearly a minute before Harry wiggled impatiently. “Look, that's getting a bit uncomfortable. Move or something!”
Lucius felt like the explanation needed to back up a bit and provide clarity. “So... you're saying that you've been staying with Potter all this time?”
Amanda purred from happiness and ran her hands through Draco's hair. After a moment, he pulled back and grinned at her. She practically glowed as she returned his grin.
Nah, why would Harry sneak into their compartment when the two of them could easily meet up in secret later on? That said, Harry must be as mad at Draco as he was at Harry, because neither of them had written a word to each other via their bond all summer. Maybe it was possible after all that Harry had foolishly risked his neck by sneaking into their compartment and hiding. If caught, the five of them would be able to hex him nastily and claim that they were just defending themselves from his attack. After all, HARRY would be the one coming to them in their compartment – rather than the other way around.
“When he tells me that he's okay with letting people know, and not a moment before,” Draco informed her firmly, giving her a kiss when she pouted in disappointment.
Draco shook his head as if trying to shake away unpleasant ideas. “Why do I want to tickle you so badly?”
“I'm not the one to do things like that,” Harry stated, rolling his eyes. “I wouldn't ask if I didn't genuinely want to know these things. Didn't I JUST say that I think we should be friends?”
“Sure I do, just not any time soon. I've got a few things I want to do first,” Daphne replied. She then held out her right pointer finger so that a drop could be placed on it, which she smeared on the tip of her tongue before kissing Theo. A moment later, she repeated the action before kissing Pansy. “Our parents might actually manage to get Astoria married before me, even though I'm older.”
“Start bending me, it's never enough, 'til I feel all your pieces. Start bending me, keep bending me un.til I'm. com.plete.ly bro.ken. in!”
Draco only resisted a little as Harry pulled him clear of everything. When he was certain there would be no splinching, he Apparated them directly to his kitchen, where he carefully set Draco in a chair. Then he promptly scanned for everything, finding a nearly lethal amount of alcohol, combined with muggle drugs such as cocaine, crack, and meth – not to mention traces of ACTUALLY lethal poisons that COULD be taken safely in small doses.
Satisfied, Draco did his best to return to his mother before she noticed that he wasn't where he was supposed to be. Unfortunately, she was smart enough to see through his excuse and stared him down upon his return. “Where were you?”
He wrote letters to Sirius and his friends demanding answers, but none came. For three days, Harry wavered back and forth between restless and furious energy, and lethargy and apathy. That night, Uncle Vernon came into his room while he was staring listlessly at the ceiling. Vernon was holding a coil of rope that turned out to be four smaller coils of rope. Just enough to tie Harry to the bed.
The woman carefully administered just one drop of potion in the indicated spot, and then watched as Harry bent over (Huh! Ron was SHORTER than him in these bodies!) and licked the drop off his neck.
Hermione was staring at him with wide eyes while Ron was pointing a shaky a finger at Draco as if he was seeing something impossible – such as a ghost, according to muggles.
Draco simply rolled off Harry and watched him get up and run off toward the voice that was getting closer to where they were hiding in a small clump of trees near the lake. Grinning like an idiot, Draco slowly got up, brushed himself off, and leisurely walked back to the castle.
Draco moaned in longing, not just accepting the kiss he wanted so badly, but escalating it as much as Harry would let him. A suddenly sense of queasiness alerted him to the fact that Harry had Apparated them somewhere. He opened his eyes and looked around for a moment before Harry lifted him up out of a chair and pressed him into the bed they were right next to.
To Draco's surprise, it was packed! It looked like word had spread from last time. Now, as he looked around, he recognized Hogwarts Alumni from various years, including what looked like almost everyone from his year.
Not daunted in the slightest, Amanda turned her smile on him. “That's because I was in with those studying for their NEWTS while you were with the Sixth Years. It was a big group. I don't blame you for not remembering every face there.”
After that, they both sang their parts together – until it was Draco's part again: “'Cuz I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it, sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it, sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me!”
A moment later, Draco was standing next to a table, giving a rather intent look to one bloke in particular. That bloke choked on his drink incredulously when he noticed Draco eyeing him, and gulped in apprehension and awe.
“What the fuck are you doing?!” Draco demanded, holding his wand at the ready to hex Harry. To his utter shock, Harry dropped to his knees and looked up at Draco with such pleading in his eyes that Draco forgot all about his plan to hex the infuriating git. “Er...”
Harry gasped and rushed to kneel by his side. “No! Oh God no! Draco! I didn't... I didn't mean... DRACO!”
“No no,” Ron assured him in his soft and fluffy feminine voice. “You look nothing like me, aside from the red hair. I'm dead certain that you're a famous muggle bloke that sings.”
Harry gave him a look of disbelief mixed with anger. “A cursed opal necklace. HOW did you give it to Katie?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Hermione, unless that spell can somehow sneak me past a dragon, I really don't care!”
They ended their song and dance by petting each other suggestively and breathing into each other's mouths. When the music stopped, Pansy kissed Draco on the cheek and nudged him with her shoulder. “See? MUCH hotter!”
sexy in his shiny black leather trousers and sheer silver button up shirt. He confidently gestured to the waitress attending that section of The Club. “A round of Firewhiskey for everyone!”
As Harry was once again on his hands and knees on the floor panting, Snape looked at his watch. “Our hour is up...”
Turning to look out the window, Draco decided to drop the subject completely. He just couldn't admit to having a Soulmate. Ever!
“Er...” Harry droned, not entirely sure whether he should be offended or... nodding in agreement... Unable to decide, he focused on eating his pastrami and muenster on rye.
Alright, so, I know I didn't tag dubious consent for this, but that's because I knew that the suggestion to shag *wasn't* a magically bound dare, and thus, even though these silly boys try to use the excuse of having to because of a dare, they're actually both just really eager, lol ^_^
As the deep star-studded black of night faded toward morning, their spirit visitors also faded. But by the time they were gone for good, they had hugged and said everything they needed to say to Harry and his kids. All in all, it was one of the best nights of Harry's life, and he went to bed feeling utterly at peace with the world.
Turning away for a moment, Draco spelled the piano to play itself. Naturally, it was a song that Draco wanted it to play.
The mere reminder of everything he'd been through this past year almost made Draco vomit, but he managed to hold it down. After gulping and several deep breaths – all while glaring and keeping his wand aimed at Dumbledore's heart to illustrate how deadly serious he was – he answered the question. Almost compulsively.
. Draco couldn't help but snicker to himself because there was NO WAY he was going to make such a fool of himself by singing such an insipid song. IF he became obligated to sing – and the look on Pansy's face make it clear that he probably would be – he was going to choose a song that he sounded good singing and he was going to be stone cold sober as he sang it!
And then it was gone and Harry could hear the Death Eaters laughing even as Voldemort watched him with interest. “You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me. But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by lucky chance, and I'm now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,” he whispered to his snake, which slithered away to where his Death Eaters stood watching.
Happy for an excuse to get away if even for only a few minutes, Draco did as he was told, despite his mother's indignant protests on his behalf. Out in the courtyard, he turned the men into small boulders. This would prevent them from escaping before Bella could dispatch them, but also had the advantage of if she forgot about them – which she was likely to do – he could turn them back and release them later.
But Voldemort trailed off, walking closer to Harry, who didn't have anywhere to escape to. With a strange expression, the Dark Lord regarded Harry, looking almost puzzled. Then... he reached out and tried to tickle Harry's armpit. Harry twitched in confusion and tried to sidle away.
Taking this as a good sign, Harry pulled his shirt off. Draco was so excited that he forgot he could cast spells to get undressed in seconds. Instead, they both tore their clothes off and tossed them away carelessly. In less than a minute, they were both diving onto the cushion and kissing so enthusiastically that it resembled a mini battle fought with their mouths.
Terry took this as the actual question and explained that: “Any dare written on one of these slips and then given to the person you wish to dare is magically BOUND to do the dare. They CAN'T chicken out!”
Harry couldn't decide whether to be elated or furious! On the one hand, Draco was being completely honest
Snape looked rather disgusted, but he did not let up. In fact, his tickling got a bit more intense – if that was possible. Harry's intense concentration of a moment ago vanished, and his screams got louder than ever.
Just then, the woman in charge of the Karaoke called up the next singer. “Draco Malfoy, get you're fit arse up here! It's
Draco shrugged. “Most of the time, I can manage it just fine. But if I DON'T – if I miss a... 'dose...' I'll die...”
“Right,” Harry agreed in frustration, running a hand through his hair in a way that unconsciously fluffed up the back.
Harry shook his head, now feeling much less dreamy and more like he wished he'd just kept his mouth shut. “No! Look, I know what you're thinking, that I was raped or something –”
Sighing, Draco visibly relaxed and returned the kiss until Harry remembered that he had Divination and rushed off before he was late.
Harry didn't quite know what to think of that. He thought and thought, but nothing seemed right. Finally, he decided that an imaginary friend would HAVE to think he was special.
Harry and Ron had an entire silent conversation in a series of looks before nodding at Ginger in understanding and acceptance. Even so, Ron muttered under his breath: “Mione's going to
He stood up and marched over to Draco, glaring at those who were currently offering him things. “What do you think you're doing?” He demanded of a man that looked intense and angry.
Despite what I make it sound like at the end, I do not have plans to continue this unless I get some irresistible plot bunnies, lol ^_^
“Well count me out!” Hermione muttered fervently. "I have no need to waste any time on such foolishness when I have homework to do!”
Draco narrowed his eyes, not happy at all to hear that Harry planned to stalk him again this year. “Caught between the lines, my life of worthless lies, shedding my skin to begin a life I don't know how to live in, I can't take it, I've seen it all, and I've walked it tall, lived in this sin, where do I begin?” He barely had time to take a breath before a different lyric abrupt followed. “You made me a, you made me a believer, believer, you break me down, you build me up, believer, believer.” Prior to this, Draco was confused but not too mortified as he was sounding smooth as glass and not truly embarrassing himself, but now, he felt as if someone was trying to pull his skin off and expose his secret core.
Draco felt all alone and a bit lonely, ever since his parents had left for an extended world vacation. When they'd first left, he'd been elated to be on his own and able to do whatever he wanted. Now he just wanted them to come home so that he could talk to them and see if maybe THEY could figure out the mess he found himself in.
Draco put real effort into pulling his arm free this time. “Let me go Potter, before I really do have to hex you!”
Once again, Harry gave Draco every incentive to stay the entire weekend. When Draco woke up on Monday morning, he was in an excellent mood. He read Harry's note letting him know he'd gone to work, stretched languorously, and then Apparated home. One thing was clear, no matter WHO Harry was trying to date, Draco had an incentive to attend the
“Sit down, Malfoy, and finish this conversation with me without attracting every eye in the pub,” Harry ordered as the Waitress arrived with their drinks. She set them down and didn't dare disobey the look Harry gave her that plainly stated he'd hex her if she didn't shove off and leave them alone. “I've already cast a bunch of privacy spells around us, so no one else should be able to hear a word we say,” he explained even as he cast detection spells to ensure their drinks were clean. They were.
After Auror Ginger left the room, Ron turned a confused frown on Harry. “Oi, mate? I have no idea if I'm supposed to cover my eyes when I get dressed. This is some woman's naked body, and I'm pretty sure Mione would get mad at me for ogling it if she were here.” He focused very hard on his feet in order to get his knickers on without looking at the part between his legs.
But Narcissa cut her off. “Please Miss Parkinson. While I appreciate your concern for my son, please consider your words carefully.”
Draco snickered softly, giving Harry one last tiny kiss. “Good luck!” After that, he turned and left. Harry felt his brain melt as he watched him go, and then literally shook himself and raced off toward Gryffindor tower.
Draco entered the lift without really paying attention to where he was going. He was just finished up shopping in his favorite high end muggle shop and was planning to go to his favorite club. His life tended to follow a nice pattern – business during the day, relaxing during the evening (often including a bit of shopping), and exciting new lovers every night. All in all, life was good.
Harry literally had to hold onto the chair he was sitting in in order to stop himself from running up on that stage and snogging the bloody fuck out of Draco at the end with he finished off with: “
Downing the last of his tea, Harry also left the room, arriving in his dorm just in time to get in bed before everyone else woke up.
Baffled, Draco decided that it would be fun to conjure two or three hundred tiny physical representations of a blasting hex. In other words, chocolate chip sized bombs. The moment Harry got home, he was planning to play a fun game.
Harry laughed softly and gave him another kiss. “I could always do my best to make you feel better.”
Even so, he was half certain that he couldn't quite keep every trace of fear off his face. Currently, it seemed like his worst nightmare was coming true. If they could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was genuinely Harry, he'd be shortly given to the Dark Lord and summarily murdered. The only good in the whole situation was that the Dark Lord wanted it over as quickly as possible, and so, Harry would not be subjected to torture first.
The utterly fantastic little ripples made Draco's whole body shiver even as a storm seemed to be gathering at the base of his spine. With a roar, he dug his fingers into Harry's hips and surrendered to the climax sweeping him away. The whole world went white for a few seconds, and then Draco collapsed onto Harry, feeling like he'd be perfectly comfortable going right to sleep with Harry as his bed.
Harry screamed from pain beyond anything he had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end... to black out... to die...
Taking his hand, Draco led him to the cushions. They got to their knees, and then lay down so that Harry was on his back with Draco on top of him. The first kiss was soft, almost hesitant.
“Not so fast, sneaky young sirs!” A voice that neither of them relished hearing at that exact moment said.
here wants to tease himself with my body. Alright then, place a dozen drops up my body and enjoy the show as he licks them up.”
Harry was stunned to see a rather cozy little area off to the side. It had a bunch of plush cushions and was romantically lit by a bevy of candles. Good thing the castle was basically fireproof!
Although he would admit – silently to himself, in his head – that he was beyond grateful that the bloody cabinet worked on humans too, and not just an extremely lucky bird.
Harry kissed him and they both got lost in the kiss for a few minutes before breaking apart and helping each other to their feet. As Harry got dressed, he couldn't help but appreciate the sight of Draco pulling on his silky blue pajamas.
Harry was now humming in thought as he examined every millimeter of the dragon. “Hmm... I guess I would have assumed that you'd get a really colorful tattoo of a dragon in Slytherin colors, but this is plain black. That said, it's done in a stylistic way that makes it look really good.”
Worse! Almost immediately, the only thing Harry was looking forward to – the Quidditch match between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor – was canceled because of a double attack involving Hermione! Utterly morose, as he waited for the right time for him and Ron to sneak out under the invisibility cloak, he decided to complain to his imaginary friend.
But rather than take this seriously, Draco simply snogged the breath right out of Harry's lungs. Harry's brain immediately went blank. Before he could even attempt to remember why he was so mad, he caved in and gave Draco every bit as good as he got.
him into the bed. This proved to be exactly what Draco needed as he arched his back and got tighter. When his orgasm hit, those magical little flutters made Harry groan rather gutturally and pump him full. The two collapsed into a heaving pile and swiftly passed out.
Harry raised his wand higher in a clear threat, but Granger protested, grabbed his arm, and tried to force him to behave. Meanwhile, Madam Malkin wavered for a moment before seemingly deciding that if she acted like nothing was happening, it wouldn't. She tried to resume hemming Draco's sleeve.
Harry had an uncomfortable feeling he knew what she was going to say – that it was starting to look a lot like it was headed in an even more unpleasant direction. “You'll just have to come pick me up each week,” he mumbled.
Taking advantage of the fact that Draco was thoroughly distracted, Harry lifted him up and carried him onto the bed so that he could conjure up some Gryffindor ties and bind Draco's hands to the head board. Then he shifted to focus on working the rest of Draco's clothes off.
“So, in the spirit of being up front, I feel I should let you know that when we get together, my group of friends and I tend to snog each other and do lascivious body shots – and I fully intend to participate. I just want you to know that no matter HOW into it I get, I'm NOT going to end up in anyone else's bed tonight,” Draco explained.
Harry blushed, not able to BELIEVE that he was about to lick Ron all over in public. Ron was surprisingly mature, volunteering to go first.
When ready, he pulled the dummy into a slow dance that was basically swaying in circles around the small makeshift dance floor.
From that day on, Harry always had to wear long sleeves, which seriously confused him, since if there really wasn't anything on his arm, then why did he need to cover it? Even so, all his short sleeve shirts (that were handed down from Dudley and were so big that they were almost long sleeve shirts anyway) disappeared, and when he did get new hand me downs, they were always the long sleeved shirts. His aunt claimed that the short sleeved ones were too worn out for Harry to wear.
Harry ended there, determined not to be won over so easily. But to be honest, by the time summer was over and he was back on the Hogwarts' Express, he forgotten all about his anger at Draco. Thus, when Draco led his two lumbering henchmen into their compartment to threaten them, Harry was a little... softer toward him.
Harry quickly explained that he had a curse on him in which everyone who looked at him wanted to tickle him. This made Lupin stroke his chin in thought and wonder if he had any books that could help. In short order, Harry was packed up – with help from Tonks – and ready to go. On a long and VERY cold broom ride to someplace he'd never been before.
Harry breath was inexplicable ragged now. “Malfoy???” He gasped out softly, not sure what to say or how to respond.
Draco shook his head in confusion, the strangest look crossing his face. “I... don't... remember that...”
“These are papers to write magical dares on,” Terry explained, turning to grin at Padma in a way that suggested that he was trying to impress her, but she simply rolled her eyes and shook her head.
Needing no further invitation, Draco picked a medium pace to begin with, making little grunts and moans as his body continually felt like a pixie was punching him with pleasure. Even Harry was gasping and panting and making noises that reassured Draco. They both focused on what was happening to the point that Draco didn't even feel Harry digging his nails into his back.
As he was still reeling, not even noticing his parents running around calling his name, he saw his aunt killed and couldn't quite find it in him to feel more than the tiniest twinge of sadness. Voldemort almost certainly didn't love her either, but he seemed enraged by the death of the mother of his infant daughter. He blasted away the three people dueling him – McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn – and turned to murder the woman who'd done it: Molly Weasley.
NOT that he planned to tell Ginny that she was right! They were broken up for good now and there was no need for her to have cause to say I told you so!
Draco shrugged and snorted in amusement. “Even I'VE heard you telling them over and over that they need to work together. It's really their own fault if they lose points for not listening.”
Harry felt like an overcooked noodle! He'd paced himself during those hundred laps by starting with two burpees, running 10 laps, doing two more burpees and so on until he'd ended the whole thing with his last three burpees. By that point, he didn't have enough energy left to stand and Ron had to drag him to the shower room where they could grab a quick shower and change into the standard uniform for Aurors in training when they went on training missions.
“Alright Ron,” Harry conceded, especially since he got a better look at himself and realized that Ron was right about them not looking the same after all.
Harry really did try not to trip over his own feet, but he couldn't stop watching Draco long enough to concentrate on his own dancing. The woman that had insisted Draco dance with her was basically rubbing her body all over his and their dance was a spicy hot emulation of shagging peppered liberally with genuinely skilled and flashy tricks.
Draco had a sudden and unpleasant gush of bile rise up into his mouth to have it pointed out to him so bluntly that he was blatantly reluctant to commit murder.
“Ah, I see. Well I guess I wouldn't mind. All I really want is to travel the world and take pictures, so really, I might not BE home long enough to create those heirs anyway.”
Harry sighed in defeat. “Yeah... I suppose I understand. After all, I've half convinced Ron and Hermione that you somehow slipped Katie that necklace. If I suddenly smiled at you across the Great Hall and said that you had no idea Katie even had the necklace, they'd wonder what got into me. Worse! I might have to explain this whole thing between us!”
Before Harry really had a chance to register what was going on – his head was in SO much pain it was all he could do to open his eyes and pay attention, and clearly not very well at that – Voldemort flicked his wand at Harry, which forced him onto his back with his hands resting on either side of his head. Bellatrix looked very eager to begin the torture, her wand in her hand and at the ready. Voldemort straddled Harry's hips and began by lifting his shirt and tickling his sides, making him laugh and squirm despite the pain in his head.
After staring at him for the first 10 minutes or so to see if he was going to say anything, Umbridge had focused on her paperwork and didn't look at him again, until Harry paused – a good three or four hours later – to look at the back of his hand. That's when Umbridge looked up at him.
Draco gave them a look that made it clear he wasn't going to say a word on the subject. Sighing in defeat because they knew he'd NEVER give in if he didn't want to, they looked around the shop and gathered up things for him to try on. It was a LONG couple of hours before they finally found the perfect thing. By that point, they almost didn't have time to get ready before meeting their other friends at The Club.
Harry felt his anger deflate abruptly and sighed as he let Draco go. “Don't let haters who know nothing about you win.”
Sadly, Draco was so in need of a nap – and maybe a good meal or two – that he barely managed to follow instructions. His finished potion was merely passable, and probably wouldn't work very well anyway. Not having the energy to care that Slughorn once again favored Harry, Draco simply packed up his belongings and left the moment the bell rang.
He gasped as his stomach heaved, and then reflexively gulped when nothing came up after all. A strange feeling of being watched again made him look up. In the mirror, he could see Harry standing there staring at him.
“You will,” Draco promised, running his hand through Harry's hair, grabbing a thick handful, and holding onto it as he gave Harry a kiss to remind him to hurry home if at all possible.
And so, they resisted the urge to speed up until both were starting to get drowsy from sheer exhaustion (more from studying than their gentle shagging). Suddenly, they had to speed up and finish or give up and go to sleep. Only thoughts of getting caught in the morning gave them the incentive to finish.
Draco growled in frustration. “I HAVE family and friends! I still... I still can't stand the thought of waking up tomorrow to find that nothing's changed. That I should be in Azkaban but I'm not. That my parents want me to be happy but I don't deserve a moment of it!”
The look on his face should have confirmed to anyone with an ounce of observational skills that he was not himself. He looked almost drugged with dreaminess when he focused on his bride-to-be. Even Harry could see it!
Anaya, Vihaan, and Hunter (Parkinson-Malfoy) were the only Potter kids in Fourth Year, and so, they felt a bit like they were on their own when it came to relying on their siblings. That said, Anaya and Vihaan were both Hufflepuffs, and so, managed to invoke the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor qualities of their mothers (and father), and take charge of their house. Under their command, Hufflepuff did surprisingly well and made it to the center of the Maze fairly quickly.
Also, perhaps because Draco was the only one literally bleeding, and therefore had proof that he had fought (even though he hadn't really), he was released first. That said, being forced to lay there on the floor as his parents (and Greyback, but who cared about him) were tortured... well, it felt almost a hundred times worse than being tortured himself.
Pansy yawned before taking a sip of her wine. “Alright, so, we've gotten to the inevitable argument during dinner AND the reminiscing about the Dark Lord, and now we've reached the inappropriate sex chat portion of dinner. Does this mean that I can brag about my night, or can we finally get back to what the bloody hell is going on?”
Looking rather horrified to suddenly be the center of attention, Draco took a deep breath and tried to step down, but he couldn't. Without warning, his mouth opened and his rather posh and smooth voice burst forth.
“We THINK this is the man who owns the establishment AND makes the potion we're investigating. Should you happen to spot him, let me know immediately.”
For the hearing that Harry had to attend, and then a few weeks later when he rode the Hogwarts Express back to school, the best solution they could come up with – other than casting spells on everyone who saw Harry to help them control their urge to tickle him, was to cast a spell on Harry that made him slightly blurry to those that looked him. It seemed to work in that no one in the Ministry or on the train tried to tickle him. The problem was that the spell was only temporary and had to be renewed every hour. The other problem was that Harry could not cast the spell on himself – which is not to say that he couldn't cast the spell at all, simply that the curse itself seemed to make it impossible for him to cast anything on himself that would negate the curse.
Unfortunately – as it meant no kissing – their next interaction was when Umbridge was inspecting Grubbily-Plank's class. Draco had complained about getting slashed by a Hippogriff, and Harry'd earned yet another detention by pointing out that it had happened: “Only because he's too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do.”
Harry gasped and pressed a hand to his chest, astonished to find that that one simple action had hurt him far more than all the tiny bombs combined. Hermione pulled him into a hug, humming faintly as she rubbed his back. Meanwhile, Ron was inspecting what was left of the pile of bombs, even going so far as to throw one at his arm to see what it felt like.
Harry stood up and walked over so he could pull Draco into his arms. “I'm serious. I love you and want to marry you. I've been brooding over how to ask you for weeks! I thought about making grand romantic gestures, or doing it in public so that everyone knows how I feel about you, but then I realized that you'd probably say no and murder me on the spot if I did that, so then I thought maybe a SMALL romantic gesture – such as dinner, but...”
Scratching his cheek, Harry nudged Hermione with his elbow. “Why would Soulmates need to write to each other on their arms?”
Before Harry could fully make up his mind, an already harassed looking waitress trudged over to Draco and tried to give him a becoming smile.
Knowing that the classrooms on the seventh floor were rarely used for anything other than group practice and illicit romantic meetings, Harry decided that he could take a bit of a risk. Casting extra spells on the door to prevent anyone – such as Peeves – from hearing them or trying to come into the room, Harry (still holding Draco with one arm) quickly cast a spell to levitate a few desks together. Then he transfigured the lot of them into an actual bed. A big one that was as comfortable as Harry could make it.
Harry gave him a look that was just short of rolling his eyes. “Draco, we share an underwear drawer, remember? I bloody well KNOW you've got an illegal time turner.”
Harry nervously ran a hand through his hair. “Erm... I should probably go. I've got LOADS of stairs to run up before curfew.”
By this point, it was clear to everyone in the pub that this song was intended to incite lust. Draco was wearing a sleek and casual suit, but Pansy was wearing a sexy, flirty red dress, and as they danced, nearly
And then finally, he got to the point: “And here his is... the boy you all believed had been my downfall...”
Still confused but willing to do anything her Lord ordered, Bellatrix lifted her skirt high enough that she could step her feet to either side of Harry's hands, lower herself until her knees were pinning down his arms, and then more or less sit on his head. His laughing and the fact that it was clearly involuntary made her... surprisingly into it.
Harry didn't have time to do much more than glare at Draco before Umbridge came bustling breathlessly around the corner. She was beyond delighted and well into jubilant when she saw Harry lying on the floor.
Draco shook his head. Then he sighed. “I'm just really busy this year, so unless we're going to do something productive, I think I'll just go to bed and rest up for...” Again he trailed off and refused to say anything more.
Draco shook off his melancholy and walked over to Harry. He put his arms around Harry's waist and snuggled him tight for a moment before giving him a kiss. Harry hummed slightly before giving Draco a tiny smile.
Infuriatingly, it was only a couple of days later – the morning of the Final Task – when Rita Skeeter published a nasty article about him and Harry had to bite his tongue to keep from shouting at Draco – who was roaring with laughter with all his friends at the Slytherin table. Not just laughing, but making hurtful faces at him too.
This was an excellent start to the plan. As soon as they were relatively clear, one of the minions was sent ahead to cast the Dark Mark above the Astronomy Tower in order to attract Dumbledore's attention and prompt him to return sooner than he'd planned to. Even so, with the sudden arrival of several extra people who didn't even belong in the castle at the moment, plus a couple of other students, they had a job of standing their ground.
Harry looked at Draco, tilting his head curiously. Draco gave him a small smile that was shockingly shy – considering how confident he usually was. Harry tentatively returned the smile.
Harry let out a tiny yelp of surprise when Draco gently nipped his right buttock. Before he could wrap his head around the fact that Draco had literally kissed his arse – a couple of times – Draco shifted until he was quite comfortable between Harry's legs. Harry couldn't get a good view of him – especially since he was pressing his forehead into the bed and moaning without any sort of shame now – but it felt like Draco was face to arse with him now.
For one insane moment, he thought that the Dark Lord was threatening to have him bitten and he looked to his father to see if he was right. His father was steadfastly ignoring all humiliation by staring into his lap. His mother shook her head at him almost imperceptibly before resuming her deadpan staring at the opposite wall. Perhaps because Draco hadn't truly responded, the Lord grew bored and called an end to the laughing.
Draco felt like he was punched in the chest. No! Full body slammed by a wall! All of the emotions that he'd had to lock up and deny for so long came flooding back into him without warning, making him stagger a bit and cry and blubber, chanting the word: “Yes!” Over and over until Harry silenced him with a fiery kiss.
Narcissa pressed her face to his chest and cried as silently as possible. Draco simply stroked her back for a few minutes, letting her cry without acknowledging it. When she was able to sit up and compose herself, she took hold of Draco's left hand – since she was sitting on his left side.
When Granger sobbed out something that was likely a lie – that the sword was a copy – Draco was sent to fetch the goblin Griphook. Again grateful for the excuse to leave for a bit, Draco took his time getting to the dungeon. Half of him hoped the prisoners all listened and didn't give him trouble, which would be an excuse for the Dark Lord to punish him. The other half hoped that Harry would jump on the opportunity to lead a small rebellion, overpower him, and escape.
Snape drawled in his snide voice. “The staff has been informed of your predicament, which is why we all tolerate you looking like a blur in our classes. To be honest, I feel it improves your features greatly.” As he said this, his other hand was now tickling Harry's other side. “And NO, I do not want to be tickling you, but I cannot stop myself, Potter, so you may consider yourself unfortunate.”
Draco said nothing since it was a promise he didn't think he could make. Faint tickling prompted him to raise the arm that his mother still held the hand of. They both looked at the spot his pajamas – that Madam Pomfrey simply must have spelled him into – revealed above his wrist. Narcissa gently pulled up his sleeve so that they could read what was written.
Since Harry had actually explained the rules a few times during class, none of the students had anything to ask. However, one of the parents was rather confused about something.
It was – somewhat ironically – the NON Unforgivable spells that Draco felt had less justification for learning. Honestly, who would ever have a need to cast a spell to make hundreds of tiny non existent drills bore into every bone in a person's body? Or a Curse to turn a person's insides into their outsides. Or make their blood boil.
At this point, enough of the audience was tipsy enough that they leered at her and promised to touch her all night if she wanted. And not all of the promisers were men! Grinning and winking at a couple of the ones she was interested in, Pansy kept control of the microphone after her song was over.
In concern, Harry tried to gently pat Draco awake, but that didn't work. He got a bit more forceful, but that didn't work either. Then Harry bit his lip in concern as he wondered if he should bring Draco to Madam Pomfrey. Except... he didn't think that Draco would thank him for taking such a risk when all he probably needed was some good sleep.
Ron was surprised to hear his name hissed at him urgently as he passed a dark alcove on his way to dinner. In his single-minded determination to get to the Gryffindor table as soon as possible, he nearly ignored the urgent beckoning, but sheer curiosity stopped him in his tracks.
Draco seemed to struggle with a bit of rage for a few moments until sighing in something akin to defeat. He checked his watch again, ran a hand through his hair in agitation, and then shrugged.
Auror Ginger rolled her eyes. “Oh please! Everything is properly covered! It just LOOKS like no one is wearing anything because what they are wearing is tiny and revealing.”
“Alright my lads and ladies, this here is a really fun game that muggles play called Karaoke. Basically, it's simple. Gather up your Gryffindor Courage – the drink – and come up on stage. Once here, choose a song you want to sing, and I'll play the music for it while you sing your little heart out,” Blaise explained, and then selected a song. “I'll even go first to show you how it's done!”
Amanda was smiling a bit dreamily. “Does it really matter, Draco? I've not yet had a chance to meet Harry Potter; thank you so much – Mr. Potter – for defeating You-Know-Who! I've sent in a bunch of letters for you to the Daily Prophet, but I'm quite sure you must not have received them.”
Taking a breath, Harry continued. “You will be going into the Maze, which has been designed so that each house will start at a different corner, and ALL of you will have an equal chance of making it to the center of the Maze. You'll encounter all sorts of obstacles; some of which are magical creatures, some of which are puzzles or riddles, and some of which are challenges you won't realize are challenges unless you solve them.”
Harry could only vaguely remember hearing the song before, but he had the nagging impression that it was meant to be screamed melodically. That said, no matter how it was
Draco walked into Harry's kitchen to find Harry staring a bit blankly at the bacon as it fried. Before going over and wishing Harry a good morning, Draco took a minute to think. There used to be a time when Harry would have been grinning like an idiot as he cooked, but now, Draco couldn't remember the last time he caught Harry smiling. Instead, Harry had been quiet and withdrawn.
Blaise, Theo, Vince, and Greg all stood back watching him in utter bafflement. This was more or less normal for Vince and Greg, but even Blaise was scratching his head. “Should we try and stop him?” But before they could make any decisions, Draco roared while tugging on his hair.
And by that, he literally meant his bed, here in the Manor. The first few times, it had been a random thing in a hotel room. Then it had happened once or twice at Harry's place, but eventually, Draco had an urge to invite him back here, and they'd had their trysts here ever since.
Deciding that since Ron had been honest with him – despite be clearly reluctant to do so – he'd be a terrible friend if he lied or deflected now. So, Harry held up his hand and showed Ron the writing. “She had me writing lines with a quill that used my own blood for ink.”
With a groan of profound relief, Draco emptied himself inside Harry. After a moment of simply savoring his orgasm, he collapsed onto the cushion next to Harry. They both panted for a few moments.
Suddenly, the music changed and the Entertainer called out from her spot on the bar: “Draco Malfoy! There's not a bloody man in here that can dance as well you, so get your fit arse over here and dance with me! As while he does, if you haven't signed up for a spot on the Karaoke list, do so!”
He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not. Whenever he was in company, he wanted to get away, and whenever he was alone, he wanted company. He thought he really might go and visit Hagrid since he had not talked to him properly since the half giant's return.
Draco couldn't decide whether to be happy or angry when he saw Harry enter the Great Hall for the feast after all. He decided to focus on telling everyone how he'd broken Harry's nose. It was strangely satisfying to relive that glorious moment over and over as he told the story several times. But then Dumbledore stood up to make a few announcements and Draco felt that he'd show less emotion or anything telling if he concentrated on making his fork hover over the table.
Hermione and Ernie Macmillan were talking about Umbridge throwing a fit when she couldn't get into Dumbledore's office, Hermione saying: “Oh I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head's office. Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed up, power crazy old –”
Draco managed to delay answering long enough to drink a good quarter to third of the bottle – before Harry grew concerned and took the bottle away from him. “It makes me sad because as much as I want you happy, I want you happy with ME...”
Draco snorted in amusement. “There are only two reasons for a Soulmate bond to exist, and I can bloody well guarantee you that it's NOT so that we can help each other!”
It took him banging his head on the wall several times before he could wrap his head around this information.
“I always want to give you whatever you want,” Draco said, and then immediately looked like he was wondering why he said that.
Harry didn't even have the presence of mind to care what that was referring to, but Ron and Ginger had spotted the fact that the Polyjuice was just beginning to wear off and it would be noticeable to take a swig of it right then. Ginger gestured to Ron that the Mission was more or less accomplished, and so, they'd best leave.
“I already made plans with my friends before we got together, and had you said you were coming home early tonight, I'd have canceled on them, but since you're not... I think I'll go. Erm...”
Harry suddenly felt sick! It didn't help at all that Draco loudly told all his friends that Hagrid would probably be sacked even if he did turn up. And then LAUGHED at both Harry and Hagrid until Harry managed to grab his blood stained picture (the Bowtruckle he'd been holding while drawing it had scratched him nastily and run off), and escape in the direction of his next class with Ron and Hermione.
Four men wearing club uniforms appeared from the crowd. “So sorry, Mr. Malfoy! Let us take care of this.”
Harry felt vulnerable all of a sudden and shrugged as he turned to sit at his table. “I dunno. Having a family of my own as soon as possible sounds like a brilliant idea.”
“Erm...” Harry wasn't sure how to respond for a moment. He didn't want to sound like a bloody shrew by screeching that Draco couldn't do ANY of that, but on the other hand, he actually COULD understand fucking around when drinking with his mates. Hell, Dean and Seamus occasionally teamed up with George to get them all pissed out of their minds so that they'd do the BARMIEST dares.
Narcissa had probably been quietly snickering over her son's words, but she decided that a show of support was definitely called for. She stepped forward and fixed her cold gaze on Harry and his weasel.
Harry looked mockingly around the shop. “Wow... look at that... He's not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!”
When an orgasm rolled over him, Harry once again threw his head back and cried out obscenities. This made Draco grip his hips even harder and groan into Harry's neck. They both slumped together with absolutely NO desire to move for the foreseeable future.
The Hufflepuffs made their way to the north side of the Maze while the Ravenclaws headed to the east side. The Gryffindors trekked south, which left the Slytherins marching to the west. The Sixth Years cheered on their Fourth Year Housemates from the stands of the Quidditch Stadium – which was where the Maze had been constructed. Parents were given the choice between literally walking on top of the walls or flying around on brooms, and they'd divided fairly evenly in half between the two. Once everyone was in place, Harry shot off an impressive dragon firework provided by Ron and George.
Still, whooping: “I did it! I did it!” He swept the dressing dummy into a somewhat lively dance that was gratifying in that the dummy was more than happy to praise him: “Well done, good on you, I knew you could do it!”
Back at Hogwarts, the crowd burst into raucous celebration, assuming that Harry and or Cedric had just won the TriWizard Tournament. Only... nothing could be further from the truth...
This managed to calm Draco down just enough that he could pause his tantrum to growl at his parents. “We're not dating, but he made a commitment to me to help me get over my depression and make me feel better and it hasn't even been three months and he's already moving on to someone else!”
“Potter! What in the bloody hell are you doing?! Let me go! Let me – I swear I will hex your grimy barbarian hand clean off if you do not – urgh!” Draco's indignant litany was cut short when Harry threw him again the shelves so that he could shut and lock the door with locking spells that not even Hermione could unlock.
But then all hell broke loose and everyone flooded back into the castle and so many reinforcements arrived. Even the house elves were fighting! But Draco noticed that strange things kept happening. Shield spells popped up out of nowhere to protect those fighting against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Draco was suddenly filled with a hope so profound that it felt like it stabbed him in the gut with a sword. He gasped and couldn't catch his breath because of it.
She shrugged. “You'd probably snog everyone here, grope and grind on the dance floor, and take off to go shag your girl in about 10 minutes or less. The good news is that when the two of you DO decide to go shag, it also helps with your stamina, so you'll last a bit longer than normal.”
Chuckling, Harry shook his head and refused to say anything more as he resumed his journey to the loo.
Harry looked him over curiously but otherwise said nothing for a long time. As the minutes passed, Draco's agitation grew. He also kept checking his watch. As 9 PM drew nearer, he lost all patience and pounded on the call for help button several times.
Harry shrugged, looking at Ron before tilting his head so that the water could get his hair wet. “I'm fine.”
Draco couldn't help but be drawn to the action, watching said hair nearly crackle from magic as it resisted even an unconscious attempt to tame it. “I love how your hair always looks like you just fell out of bed.”
Harry shrugged. “Perhaps not technically, but since the ONLY way that situation would work in their favor would be if their entire Year links hands and carries that flag out together, I'll consider anything else as not following the first rule of working together with their Housemates.”
Draco stood up and slammed a hand on the table. “You mean to say that Slytherin is the ONLY House that doesn't give its Prefects such a big tactical advantage!”
Narcissa laughed and kissed her adorable son. “Well, what if her parents don't want her writing on herself? At your age, they probably won't believe her if she says she didn't do it. And you wouldn't want her to get in trouble, would you?”
Greyback was more than happy to cut in and assure them all that he was more than willing to come along uninvited – wouldn't pass up the chance in fact. However, considering Draco's clearly wavering resolve, the other Death eaters were happy enough to pass the time with insults and taunts. Until all of them lost their last bit of patience and snapped at him to do it or stand aside.
Harry didn't want to think just now how maybe all the times they'd kissed and shagged had been the real act and this was Draco's true self. That was just too depressing to contemplate!
People gave him drinks and Draco more or less shrugged as he accepted them and drank them. He even saw when people spiked those drinks with various things and drank them anyway. When it got to the point that they were openly offering him drugs and potions that could be harmful – and Draco took them anyway – that's when Harry got fed up.
Stunned by the news that Vince had died, Draco lay next to Greg, torn between standing up and officially joining Harry in the fight and staying to protect one of the only friends he had. He listened when Harry stood and the conversation revealed that the Diadem had been a Horcrux destroyed by the Fiendfyre. They were already discussing Vince as if his death was of no consequence to them, except they weren't quite heartless enough to actually wish him dead.
But Harry cut him off by grabbing him and pulling him close for a demanding kiss. Draco stiffened in protest for about two seconds, and then relaxed into the kiss. When his hands found their way into Harry's hair, Harry responded by Apparating them both back to his bedroom.
Scorpius stopped at the last moment, preventing them all from going any further, since he was in the lead. “What if dad murders us???”
But Harry cut her off. “I already know that he'll tell me to keep on living my life the best I can despite the curse. It's what Madam Pomfrey told me, and you KNOW she's the type to keep a person in hospital until they've been cured. But Dumbledore told her that since there are ways to manage this curse, I have to keep on going as long as I can.”
and had the ability to weigh your options through the filter you normally have to prevent you from blurting out the unvarnished truth.”
Harry made a gesture that wordlessly and wandlessly cast a summoning spell on Draco, who flew into his arms. “I said I'd rather kiss you.” He proved his point by doing exactly that.
They were soon tearing at each other's trousers, conjuring lubrication and frotting together oh so heavenly even as they held each other tight. Draco's hands were on Harry's hips, guiding them both a bit frantically. Meanwhile, Harry's hands were tangled in Draco's shirt, practically yanking on it in his determination to keep their kissing every bit as hot as their frotting was.
Reality crashed on Harry enough to make him agree and get to his feet to follow Ron out of The Club so that they could Apparate away. By the time Ginger had Apparated them to the Ministry Mediwitch, Harry was in a GREAT mood. The potion he'd just taken made him giggly and happy in the best possible way.
In the morning, Harry was beyond delighted that Draco hadn't managed to escape during the night. Then he mentally kicked himself for making Draco endure sleeping while tied up. He gently vanished the Gryffindor ties, then set about waking Draco in the best way.
“I FUCKING CAN TOO!” Blaise shouted, pointing at Pansy and gesturing emphatically for her to join him on the floor. “PANS! GET OVER HERE AND HELP ME PROVE THAT WE'RE BETTER DANCERS THAN DRACO!”
Slowly, Harry came to the realization that he wanted Draco to be his first experience with a bloke. After all, it was bound to be good, and if it turned out to be awkward the next morning, Harry wouldn't have to worry about it being unclear and a potential relationship. He would go into it KNOWING that it was just going to be a night.
Harry felt an enormous weight press down on him, making his heart speed up like he needed to run away again, but he pushed that feeling away and nodded. Carefully, he set the plate aside and crawled into bed so that he could pull Draco close and hold him for as long as he needed.
Hermione gave him a far too knowing look. “Harry, it's not really a choice. If you are interested in blokes, then you're probably going to fall in love with one, and once you fall in love, gender doesn't matter.”
Draco looked a strange cross between gleeful to hear that and confused by the situation. “I didn't know, but erm, sir? A rack???”
“Wake up a minute,” Harry insisted, still in a whisper to avoid disturbing his boyfriend. Aside from the first morning in which Draco had woken Harry before his Alarm Charm went off, Harry had done his best to wake up and slip out of bed before anything could disturb Draco's slumber.
“I'm not going to be home at the usual time tonight,” Harry informed him. “I, er, well, I have to do a bit of special training tonight, and I have no idea when I'll be home. So...” He kissed Draco, sad that they wouldn't be able to kiss until he fell asleep tonight.
As it was being sung, Draco felt justified in slinking off to the loo until he could come up with a good excuse before Pansy dragged him up on stage again.
Draco harrumphed and gestured for Blaise to get on with playing his song. It had a bit of a lengthy instrumental intro, and then the song was sung in a slow and intense way that sounded just a bit creepy. Enough people recognized and knew the song that he could hear them singing along with him. Which was interesting to say the least and nearly made him laugh with mental images of the entire student body of Hogwarts singing this in the Great Hall at dinner.
As he was emotionally coming to a better understanding of his feelings for Ginny – that as much as he felt a sort of love for her, he seemed to really want her as a symbol of everything normal in life he was missing out on – well, the more he grew confused.
Harry was silent as he also sank to the floor and contemplated his sudden dilemma. On the one hand, offering to donate a 'dose' to Draco at this exact moment was clearly wrong – considering what Harry now knew – BUT NOT offering could potentially be fatal. He ran a hand through his hair, sincerely wishing that he'd known all of this before setting up this situation.
When the music reached the right spot, he took a deep breath and began the soft and slow part. It was an American song, so not too many people knew it – especially since the Wizarding World didn't always listen to muggle music.
Harry nodded in acceptance. “I know that better than anyone.” He then narrowed his eyes, suspicious all over again. “You didn't steal your dad's illegal time turner and go snatch them from right before they died, DID you?”
More than willing, Draco did exactly that, thrusting into Harry so fast and hard that both of them couldn't help but gasp out: “Ah ah ah!” Both felt something akin to lava rolling over them, which made Harry unable to catch his breath for a moment before a squeal escaped him and just wouldn't stop.
Suddenly, half excited and half terrified, he ran up the stairs, casting an Expelliarmus the moment he burst through the door. After seeing Dumbledore's wand going flying over the rampart, Draco took a careful look around.
And for the most part, this was true. There was one group in the corner that looked like a bunch of fashion models who had just come from a photoshoot. One of them – who was facing away from Harry – even reminded him of... Draco actually.
He took a deep breath. “Alright Potter. If you're serious enough to marry me, then I'll honor my vows and never leave. Er well, I might need to leave your side temporarily to vent anger or do things, but not... permanently...”
“WHY did we have to return home NOW?” Another asked with a sneer that indicated that he was a bit repulsed. “I REALLY didn't need to see my son in his pants with a naked lover about to shag in the ballroom.”
Harry rolled his eyes and gave Draco a LOOK. “I already told you! I've been brooding over how to ask you to marry me! I couldn't smile because I was so afraid that you'd say no!”
Seamus shook his head a couple of times, as if trying to rid himself of cobwebs. “That's... alright... I had no fecking idea what a powerful curse that was! I was screamin' at meself in me head that I don't wanna to look at Harry at the moment, much less tickle him, and me hand didn't care. It moved on its own!”
Draco shrugged before nodding. Narcissa nodded in return. Once again, she whispered into his ear so that no one could possibly overhear her. “Just know that my loyalty is to you above all others. If it comes to it, I will stand with you – even if you chose to stand with him.”
