“What about you, Malfoy?” Harry changed the subject. “Why are you working for Oliver? Surely you have enough of an inheritance to never have to work.”
Harry’s eyes slowly blinked open.

(198).  Kreacher was absolutely horrible in Order of the Phoenix, but he, like Regulus and like Draco, was a product of the environment that he was brought up in.  Kreacher’s attitude improved so much when Harry took the time to treat him well and show him compassion.
This final chapter brought to you by 4 Coors Lights, 1 mint tea, way too much packing for a move, and a roommate leaving for several days.
His leg ached more than usual, his temper flared, and he was dreading his first transformation outside of the walls of Grimmauld Place.
“I’m not sure there is ever a right time to tell your boss that you’ve been lying to him and manipulating him into a relationship with a callous elitist. So, you can’t put it off until tomorrow.  It feels like this might be a good time to fake some Gryffindor bravado and tell Oliver the truth.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, but Neville reached over to pat his shoulder.
“Malfoy!” Harry began, realizing that Draco had started briskly walking away as soon as he saw Harry. “Seriously, wait up!”
“We’ve decided that we’d like to move in together.” Oliver said.
“Maybe,” Draco said, thankful that Ginny couldn’t see through the quilt and notice the blush he could feel spreading across his face.
“With each other, you bloody idiot.”
In Half Blood Prince he’s given the absurd task of killing Dumbledore.  He doesn’t do it. He’s a smart kid, and yet he uses indirect methods that are easily thwarted because he doesn’t want to be a killer. He’s only putting up a half-hearted attempt because he’s not brave enough to stand up to his family.
“Well,” Hermione cleared her throat and fidgeted a little bit. “They weren’t really sure what was going to happen. You didn’t get bitten when the full moon was out...but there was a full moon that night. There isn’t really a lot of werewolf research, since it’s not exactly ethical to test out what happens if a werewolf bites someone the day of a full moon. As it turns out, you did...well. You transformed last night. That’s why you’re restrained. They were hoping to keep you from injuring yourself or other people. But you still scratched yourself up pretty bad in isolation.
“And?”
"Oh, you found something all right," Draco muttered as he put some of the plant he had been looking for into a pouch and turned back to see what disaster awaited him.
“That’s for Percy.” Harry said quickly. “The other container is my dinner.”
“Gin, you know it’s more than just Percy turning out to be just as bad, if not worse, than anticipated. I had started to actually
Harry barely had time to cough before a voice spoke up.
“Two shots of Firewhiskey, Tom,” Oliver said as Tom quickly filled the glasses and set them in front of him and Percy.  Percy raised an eyebrow, but before he could comment, Oliver raised his glass in salute, “To Gryffindor and old friends!” Oliver clinked his glass with the one Percy had reluctantly picked up.
The following morning, Draco woke up to the sounds of birds chirping, and the smell of breakfast wafting up the stairs. He rolled over to see Cormac still asleep and smiled to himself. He slipped out of bed quietly, and headed downstairs to see what the house elf was cooking
(457). This is an odd thing for Narcissa to admit to a room full of Slytherins. Why would Draco be able to recognize Harry any better than the rest of them? It’s not as though he SHOULD have been spending a lot of time with him at Hogwarts since they were in different classes and houses. Years and years of Draco’s obsession, and attempts to cover up his crush, are coming back to haunt him as he’s forced to stare into Harry’s disfigured face. But then, Draco does something both incredibly brave and incredibly stupid. He lies to Voldemort and all of the Death Eaters and says that he doesn’t know that it’s Harry Potter. It’s obvious to the reader that this is a lie because it has been made clear that Draco Malfoy has, up until this point, gone out of his way to see and spend as much time as possible with Harry.
“You know Malfoy, you could consider not being a condescending arsehole?” Harry yelled, his anger nearly sparking at the ends of his fingertips.
“Why would you think that?” Oliver asked.
“Well, you wouldn’t, would you?” Draco said, crossing his arms and looking away. “It wasn’t on the front page of the Prophet when it happened, and your name wasn’t mentioned so you wouldn’t have noticed.”
McGonagall looked like she was going to say something else but shook her head before calling out, “Tilly!” A small House Elf wearing what looked to be a cloth placemat appeared. “Can you please make sure Mr. Potter’s belongings end up in his quarters?”
“Have you finished the report on owl sightings yet?” he asked, crossing his arms impatiently. “These are all of the disputes we received regarding under-age magic. I need you to read through them tonight and debrief me tomorrow morning as soon as I get to the office. Put the report on my desk as soon as you’re done.” And before Harry had a chance to respond, Percy walked into his office and closed the door.
Also established in the introduction, Draco Malfoy is a coward. That wasn’t my focus when I was reading the first few books (and even I have my limits on how often I can re-read these books in one calendar year), so I don’t have the specific page numbers to back up this assertion, so you’ll just have to trust me on it. He surrounds himself with bigger, more intimidating people than him (Crabbe and Goyle). He’s afraid of rejection so he throws his money, power, and family name around in order to ensure that he’s accepted (i.e. buying the Slytherin Quidditch team Nimbus 2001s in Chamber of Secrets). But he also doesn’t want people to know that he’s afraid, so he continually overcompensates by being mean to Harry Potter because he wants people to think that Harry’s casual rejection of him meant nothing. He also can’t tell Harry how he really feels because the only thing that would be worse than Harry Potter rejecting his friendship would be Harry Potter rejecting his love. Anyway, keep in mind that Draco knows that he likes Harry Potter and he is doing his damnedest to make sure Harry doesn’t figure it out.
“There’s always unofficially an opening for the Potions position. Professor Slughorn has been saying every year that he would love to retire, and he has yet to do so. But, I really can’t in good conscience recommend that job for you.”
” Harry hissed, and grabbed Draco’s arm. “Can I speak with you for a moment.” He gave a strained smile to the estate agent who was grinning cheerfully.
******************
Unfortunately, we both know that by the time that the epilogue rears its ugly head, Harry Potter no longer hates Severus Snape. While not directly connected to Drarry, this does set the precedent for Harry forgiving his first-year grudges and opens up the possibility for Harry to move on from the enemies stage at some point.
“Go on,” Harry rested his chin on his hand, anxious to hear what sort of plan Draco had concocted.
“I wasn’t peeping on you at Madame Malkins, if that’s what you’re worried about.” The trademark Malfoy sneer flitted across his face before he sighed. “But long enough. Far longer than I probably should have safely, given the number of Legilimens crawling around the Manor the last few years before the war ended. I was a bit obsessed with you. I kind of assumed you had figured me out.”
“Well, in that case...I’ll think about your offer,
“You’ll nothing, Potter. Now, I recommend you back up off me before I decide to incinerate your insides with some very intricate dark magic. As you like to point out so frequently, I’ve certainly been raised with the knowledge.” Draco was able to use Harry’s shock to his advantage and pushed his way past and out the door before Harry could respond in any way.
The next morning, Harry woke up very confused and very hungover. Neville found him sitting on the couch with his head in his hands.
“There’s nothing wrong with it,” Draco said solemnly. “But sometimes you can’t do everything on your own, trust me I know. If the aurors are supposed to be a team, then you have to let them help you.”
“But if someone were here and that someone was acting like a miserable mess… I think I would recommend that they think about
Draco nodded and headed out, while Harry turned around and pushed the lift button several times, even though he knew that would not make it arrive any faster. When he finally made it back to his desk an eternity (but actually, only a few minutes) later, he noticed that Percy was in his office on the phone.
“Mr. Potter, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen someone carry in quite that much soot via floo travel.”  McGonagall quirked an eyebrow as her eyes traveled up and down Harry’s ashy and disheveled appearance.
“Yes, of course, Quidditch is just life or death, isn’t it?” Percy let slip out. He managed to school his features from outright annoyance, but he couldn’t quite stop his mouth.  Wood was clearly just as obsessed with Quidditch as he had been in school.  While Percy had been reasonably up before sunrise for academic purposes, Wood was up studying his Quidditch playbook.
Malfoy. And lo and behold, he’s the same old selfish prick he’s always been.” Harry huffed. “Clearly cares more about his reputation than actual people’s happiness.” He turned on his side and away from Ginny.
“Neville, I’m flattered. But you love Luna. Lunaaaaa.” Harry somewhat sang into Neville’s side.
“N-no?” Harry stammered. “I mean, yes, but what do you need?”
All quotations in this chapter (unless otherwise noted) come from my copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (US hardcover edition, 2007)
“You wish.”
“I...uhhh…” Harry stammered.
He looked up to see low clouds swirling overhead, and a chill filled the stadium. The match continued, but more and more people in the crowd started paying attention to the odd weather instead. Harry instinctively reached for his wand and made his way down a few steps to the edge of the platform so he could get a better view of what was going on.
“Are you busy?” Draco asked, slamming his palms on Harry’s desk.
There are two not-Draco centric moments in this book that are key to Drarry.  First, Harry is introduced to Slughorn in this book, an ambitious but generally not-evil Slytherin. This is the first time that Harry meets somebody from Slytherin house that isn’t involved in some way with the Dark Arts. It’s important for Harry to learn that being a Slytherin is not synonymous with being a Voldemort supporter. The Slytherin brand has been corrupted over the years, and now Harry is starting to see that there’s a possibility for Slytherin redemption.  The reader also sees a bit of this with Narcissa Malfoy visiting Snape. Harry doesn’t witness any of this, but the reader is exposed (possibly for the first time) to a Slytherin caring about the fate of someone else as well as admitting that she does not agree with Voldemort’s plan.
“I guess it’s a good thing you have me, eh?” Draco retorted. “While you’re doing that, I’ll drop hints that the Weasel is interested in Oliver, and set up a meeting with a to-be-determined colleague for next week. The plan will be for Wood to meet with this colleague at the Leaky Cauldron and then proceed to have a business dinner at La Sirene.   You will also schedule a work meeting for Weaslebee that will take place at the Leaky Cauldron at the same time. Since the colleague won’t show up, they can bond over the incompetence of others and hopefully, Wood will ask Percy to dinner so the reservation won’t go to waste. That should impress Weasley enough for him to accept.”
“All my ideas are much better than ‘half bad,’ I’ll have you know! And since, I’ve got you upright per Ron and Hermione’s request, I’ll be off. Pansy and I have plans. But let me know if you need a swift arse kicking again. I’m always happy to help.” And with that, Ginny left Grimmauld Place via the floo with as much dramatic flair as she had entered it with.
After his detention, Harry returns to the common room where we are treated to one of my favorite book scenes that should have been in the movie but wasn’t (I’m only a little bitter):
“I think the classics are good.  Uhm, so are the Weird Sisters? I guess it’s all good if you like music?” Harry said, quickly trying to figure out how to salvage the situation.
“So you’re firing me because I’m a werewolf?!” Harry bellowed, unable to contain his frustration any longer. Robards flinched, and a healer entered the room to see what the commotion was about, and handed Harry a cup with a potion to help relieve some of the pain from his first shift.
“What are you talking about?”
On about lap six, he noticed a few students had gathered in the stands.  By lap ten, it was more than a small crowd.  He sighed to himself, he should’ve known better than to openly fly on the pitch wearing his old seeker jersey, especially when school was in session.  Harry figured this was probably his cue to stop his quidditch endeavor and go to talk to McGonagall as he had really intended. He came to an abrupt stop on the ground and walked directly toward the castle, ignoring the gaggle of children whispering and following behind him.
“Why would it make me feel better?”
"Has it ever occurred to you to watch where you're going?" Draco said, picking himself up off the ground.
“I can’t pretend to understand the inner workings of your mind, Potter.” Draco crossed his arms angrily. “We need to fix this, and quickly.”
******************
“This house was very lovely. I’m sorry to cut this visit short, but I really must be going. I’ll talk to my boss, and we’ll be in touch.” He turned back to Harry. “If you tell Oliver about this, don’t bother speaking to me ever again.”
“I shouldn’t have brought up your past. If I’ve learned one thing through all this, it’s that you aren’t the same person that you were when we were at Hogwarts. You were a good friend to me, and you did the right thing...eventually.”
“I understand the need for discretion perfectly.” Draco said, turning toward where Cormac had just re-entered the room.  Cormac briefly fumbled the scrolls and quills he was carrying before placing them on the coffee table in front of Percy.
(641).  This is the second time in two hundred pages that Draco has deliberately defied Voldemort’s orders related to Harry Potter. It also shows that Draco is no longer going to follow the expected path of the Slytherins and Voldemort’s followers.
******************
There were two scenes fairly early on in the book where both Hermione and Harry acknowledged that Draco could actually be right. This is a big shift from their previous thoughts of Draco, especially from Prisoner of Azkaban when they are adamant that Draco can only do wrong and Hermione punches him. Hermione agrees with Draco in Care of Magical Creatures when Draco insists that the blast-ended skrewts are terrible and she says
"I think I found something," Harry called. Draco rolled his eyes and kept walking to a spot that he believed would have the mallowsweet. Then a scream pierced through the air.
“Morning?” Draco rubbed his eyes, and yawned. Why was Ginny here this early? Was she here last night? Conversations from the night before started to come back to him in bits and pieces, blurry in ways that suggested wine and explained his headache.
“Do you?” Draco interrupted.
“I guess I did,” Draco stopped walking away and turned to face Harry. “What did Davies do?”
was scarred.
“I believe I owe you an apology,” Wood said, shuffling his feet uncomfortably. “I should have listened to you when you warned me about Percy in my office. I also didn’t expect Percy to fire you after I mentioned our conversation to him. Were you able to find employment elsewhere, would you like me to give you a recommendation to make up for everything?”
“Well maybe it doesn’t need to be a full fledged date.  Oliver feels like an idiot for picking something Percy hated and Percy wants to be recognized for having taste. I suppose I could sacrifice one of the vintage reds from the Malfoy cellars for the cause. Pinot Noir or Cabernet?”
Before Draco could respond with his true thoughts on the matter, the waitress appeared at their table.
“Not that I’m trying to be disagreeable,” Draco replied slowly. “But I don’t exactly think I’d be welcome at a Weasley wedding.”
“Set them up with...what?” Harry asked, still not understanding. “With who?”
“Draco, I didn’t know you would be stopping by. I’m rather busy.”
“It might surprise you, Potter,” Draco said. “But you’re not the only person who has to work late sometimes. I happen to be a...very essential person in my department.”
“Oh, Potter,” Draco said, leaning in so him and Harry were inches apart, “I
It didn't take very long for everything to fall apart. Draco and Harry were both grumpy as they trudged through the forest. Harry, wanting to appear brave and like he knew what he was doing, veered from the path and towards a group of trees that surely had mallowsweet.
thing, Harry!” Draco laughed.  “At least I hope you figured out how to be more observant.”
His leg healed as well as could be expected, but Harry was dismayed to see that he had developed a limp. Hermione offered to make Harry a wolfsbane potion, but Harry declined. Instead, he barricaded himself in one of Grimmauld Place’s many unused bedrooms once a month. The pain of transformation was a reminder of his failure to save Ginny and he thought it was a fair punishment.
Meanwhile, Harry’s luck was only slightly better.  He managed to catch Percy when he was in a lift reading the latest article in the Daily Prophet about this year’s World Cup plans, and Oliver Wood’s name happened to appear in a quote in the first paragraph.
“It took you long enough to come to that conclusion,” McGonagall smiled sagely. “I always had a feeling that you’d end up wanting to pursue a different career.  I really believe that you would have been a great auror, Harry. You want to save the world, but there are other ways to do that.”
Harry remained looking genuinely confused.
“Oh, Potter, didn’t see you there.” Draco said, swiftly turning on his heel and picking lint off his robes in a bad attempt at nonchalance.
It’s not fair to Draco’s Book One characterization to suggest that Malfoy not seeing the snitch was because he’s a bad Quidditch player. It’s already established that he has some decent broom skills. I really think that Malfoy is not in it for the snitch, he’s in it to see Harry.
“Oliver wasn’t thrilled about having a Friday night meeting out of the office,” Draco told Harry . They were seated at a table close enough to the bar that they would be able to hear Percy and Oliver’s eventual conversation, although Harry had some extendable ears in his pocket just in case.
Draco and Harry fumbled for a moment before Harry awkwardly placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders and Draco placed his somewhat sweaty hands on Harry’s waist.
“Yes, Potter,” Draco let out an exasperated sigh. “We need to lay the foundation by having them interact in some way. Then we can send them off on a date or something. But we have to make it seem natural, the last thing I need is for Oliver to think I’m setting him up.”
“I quit because, like you, I realized I wasn’t doing what I wanted.  And you may have overstepped
“Oh, Harry. Stop.” Hermione burst into tears which caused Harry to nearly have a heart attack.  It was not made any better by Hermione rushing at him with a hug.  Harry awkwardly patted her significantly less bushy than normal hair.
July arrived, and with it, Harry’s birthday.  He was surprised to see that, despite his months of solitude, he still had to spend most of his day fielding owls as they delivered cards and cakes and gifts.  He allowed himself a small smile as he read through the letters at the end of the day.
Pansy was out of town for the holiday, so he expected his flat to be empty when he arrived home. So it came as some surprise when he could hear loud voices from outside the front door. He opened the door slowly and breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that the voices belonged to Ginny and Harry who were lounging on the living room furniture.
“Sure, you deserve to have some input into your wedding, but honestly, shouldn’t the fact that you get to marry her be enough?” Draco knew that if he were ever fortunate enough to find someone to look beyond his past and marry him, he could get married in the Shrieking Shack and would still be overjoyed.
“Have fun with Hogwarts Hottie.” Draco winked. Harry watched Draco walk away and refocused his attention to Roger.  Roger smiled at him and Harry felt like things were finally looking up.
“This has been going on for weeks?” Harry was absolutely livid. “Why, for the love of Merlin, did you NOT TELL ME SOONER?!”
Then about 85 pages later, Harry Potter dreams of Draco Malfoy again. Because Draco is always on his mind.
it was that they started feeling so miserable.” Ginny said.
“You know, ‘must not tell lies’ and all that rubbish,” Harry shrugged, suddenly feeling awkward. “I, uh, have to admit it’s somewhat nice to see someone suffering at work as much as me,” Harry tried to smile at Draco, though it teetered on being a grimace.
“I guess the only way the Weasel could forgive you for your romantic involvement with his sister is if she decided not even the
“You’re firing me?”
“Ron and I just wanted to thank everyone for joining us tonight, and tomorrow.” Hermione began. There were some polite nods and smiles from around the room.  “Now as you all know, Ron and I did not exactly have the most pleasant of beginnings. I was somewhat, well, a bit of a know it all-”
Chapter 3: Carry Me Home
“Is it really called The Burrow?”  Harry just laughed in response.
“Because I don’t trust you to go by yourself.” Harry explained.
Harry thought to himself… bright lights meant it was at least 7AM, which meant he was already running late. And to make matters worse, he was twisted in the sheets yet again, with the cusp of a memory calling to his mind. He had the disconcerting thought that Malfoy had made an appearance in his dream last night, which was something that hadn’t plagued him since his Hogwarts years. Maybe he shouldn’t drink so much firewhiskey before bed, he mused to himself, grabbing his robes off his bedside chair and combing his fingers through his hair. Sure, he didn’t exactly look well-groomed, but one of his only joys at work was frustrating Percy with his somewhat disheveled appearance.
Step Three: ship Ron and Hermione. Their relationship is set up as an enemies-to-friends-to-lovers romance as well, but they get through the Enemies stage by Halloween (mostly) in the first book. Ron and Hermione’s constant bickering throughout the series (and it resulting in love) is the peer relationship that Harry is exposed to the most during his formative years. Harry has no idea what a healthy relationship looks like--his aunt and uncle are monsters, his parents are dead, and he lived in a cupboard for the first decade of his life. So, to Harry, the natural course of a relationship involves years of bickering and rivalry before some catalyst (like a mountain troll, or a wizarding war) finally forces you to acknowledge your feelings for the other person.
Now that the foundation of Draco’s path has been set, it’s time to explore Harry’s path.  On page 130, Harry Potter dreams of Malfoy making fun of him. And on page 143, Harry stresses about making a fool of himself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy. Whether he wants to admit it or not, Harry Potter cares what Malfoy thinks and wants to impress him. If Malfoy’s side of the rivalry was established at his rejection on the train, then Harry’s side of the rivalry is established at the second Quidditch match when Harry is willing to face Snape (and what Harry perceives as certain doom) and play in the match just to get back at Draco.
There’s enough hope for him that when Harry is trying to escape from the fiendfyre that Crabbe unleashed he circles back despite Ron’s protests in order to save Draco:
“Listen, Potter,” Draco began. The pair sat down in the red, vinyl booth of the diner as the waitress brought over a kettle and empty teacups for them to fill. “You know I’m happy for you and your upcoming nuptials, but you have been absolutely miserable to teach with since you proposed to Ginevra.”
“But did you see that wronski feint?” Oliver exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air. “It was incredible! He’s nearing retirement and still nearly as good as Krum was in his prime. Amazing. We should keep our eye on him if he ever wants to work in the Department of Magical Games and Sports when his Quidditch career is over. You know, I’m going to need an expert Quidditch player for the Quidditch League Headquarters opening soon.”
“Oh, Harry!” Molly Weasley’s voice rang out. “I’m so glad you finally made it!” Harry was immediately enveloped in a hug.
(125)
Finally, the wedding weekend had arrived.  The night before, Hermione requested that all of the Weasleys and Harry be present at the Burrow so that they could run through the schedule for the wedding.  Everything had to be perfect, and she wanted to make sure that everyone knew exactly what they were responsible for.
“No offense,” Ginny smiled. “But I’m glad it’s not.”
“Sod off, Malfoy.” Harry punctuated the statement by tossing the vial back immediately.  Wolfsbane potion wasn’t exactly known for being pleasant. As he waited for the slightly swampy aftertaste to hit, he was surprised to be left with nothing but a faint sense of vanilla on his tongue. He couldn’t hide his shock and Draco couldn’t keep from looking smug.
“What is going on, you look-” Harry began in an unsettled tone before Ginny cut in.
“Yeah but this,” Davies said pointing to Harry and then to himself. “This is just shagging. It’s not meet-the-parents (or best friends). It’s not spend holidays with each other. It’s blowing off steam after work. It’s getting laid.”
“‘Look, Draco,” Ginny replied. “You need to fix this thing with Oliver and Percy immediately. If you can manage to do that, I’ll help you fix the situation with Harry.”
Over the next few days, Harry and Draco didn’t see much of each other at the Ministry of Magic. It turned out that it was harder than they anticipated to have a casual conversation with their bosses. Draco had the distinct impression that Wood was not listening to a single word he said if it didn’t have to do with Quidditch.
“Yes, well, beggars can’t be choosers. Now let’s get us both a drink while we scope out the scene.” Draco said, sauntering up to the bar and ordering two sickly green drinks without consulting Harry. “Drink up, Potter.” Harry took the drink from him and gulped half of it down.
******************
“Watch where you’re going!” Harry said, whipping around to see who bumped into him.
“But you went to Christmas dinner and their engagement party!”
Hermione is talking about Cho and Harry, but she could just as well have been talking about Draco and Harry. They would both feel guilty about their feelings, thinking it’s an insult to either of their families to be involved with the other. They’d certainly be worrying about what everyone else might say if they started dating. And they would both have trouble working out what their feelings are towards each other because they’re each so involved with the opposite sides of the wizarding war so it’s all very mixed up and painful.
"MALFOY!" Harry screamed as the snare bound his left arm. He couldn't believe he was going to die here and his last words were going to be Malfoy. How embarrassing.
“Yes, my social life acutely feels that pain,” Harry replied, not quite grasping Draco’s train of thought with this.
“They’re going to keep you here for a little longer, to make sure there aren’t any other side effects and to try to heal you up as best as they can. The only people who know so far are the healers, and me and Ron since we were your emergency contacts. They’ll have to tell the head of the auror department, probably, but with the wolfsbane potion you should be relatively okay. I’m going to see if I can push some werewolf reform through the Department of the Regulation of Control of Magical Creatures.”
Hermione’s explanation actually makes Harry consider his own feelings:
“He’s not--”
“You always were the most clear-headed when on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch or trying to keep your wits about you around McGonagall.  Maybe that’s the best place to be.”
And while the obsession bit is unquestionably accurate, the ‘rapidly becoming’ part is less so. This quote happens nearly two-thirds of the way through the book and is a testament to how un-self-aware Harry Potter truly is, because he thinks he is only now becoming obsessed. However, there are 400 pages of book filled with moments that show that he has always been consumed by thoughts of Draco Malfoy.
"Did you at least get what you were coming here for?" Draco asked Neville.
He thought.
“Or I’ll… I’ll…” Harry stammered, anger and annoyance intermingling too closely for him to finish his threat with words, so he just pressed his arm into Draco to finish his point. Draco’s eyes dropped, but not to where Harry’s arm was now digging in. No, if Harry were being honest, it looked like his eyes dropped to Harry’s mouth. Harry couldn’t be certain though, because as quickly as Draco’s gaze had dropped Harry felt a wand pressed into his abdomen.
“Harry,” he said calmly. “You must know that there’s no way for you to return to work. We can’t have an Auror who turns into a wild animal during the full moon. Besides, your condition is...it’s unprecedented and there’s so much more that we don’t know. You could be entirely unstable. We’re worried about the safety of the rest of the auror department. The healers are hopeful that in a couple of weeks your condition should be manageable enough for you to return home. But you won’t be returning to a normal life.”
So far, I’ve discussed Draco’s path and Harry’s path, but there is a third path that is also crucial to Drarry’s formation.  I recommended in the intro that shipping Ron and Hermione was necessary to ship Drarry because they bicker constantly and still end up together and it’s the relationship that he’s closest to growing up. But in Order of the Phoenix, Harry is also exposed to his parents' relationship. He always assumed that they were this perfect, loving couple. But he discovers in Snape’s Worst Memory that Lily Evans couldn’t stand James Potter (at least in their fifth year), and this really shakes Harry. Luckily his godfather and Remus Lupin are there to explain that Lily didn’t hate James, and that once he 'deflated his head' and 'stopped hexing people' she started dating him and fell in love. Another enemies-to-lovers relationship for Harry to base all of his relationship expectations on. Sirius also leaves Harry with this important nugget of information, which I think that later on Harry will really take to heart:
“Draco,” Harry said. “It’s fine. I’m fine. I have a new job lined up that I think I’m going to enjoy much more than working for Percy. As for your job, I don’t know that you needed to go so far as to quit. And I’m….sorry for the things that I said in that row house. I was out of line.”
“Obviously. Percy made some comments about any man worth knowing would be aware he has a more ‘refined’ taste… So can we get them both somewhere that meets Percy’s ridiculous standards that also won’t bore the pants off Oliver?”
“Mind if I cut in?” Draco Malfoy drawled. Ginny waggled her eyebrows and backed away leaving Harry no choice but to accept. “It is a waltz, after all.”
“Easier said than done,” Draco walked into the lift when it arrived and lowered his voice so the other people around them wouldn’t hear. “But they work on different floors, so how would we get them in the same place at the same time?”  A few paper airplanes flew in as Draco and Harry continued to muse over how to make this happen. The lift made a few more stops, and a variety of witches and wizards came and went.
At half past seven, Percy Weasley strode up to Harry’s desk and placed a stack of papers in Harry’s inbox.
As mentioned in the introduction, Hogwarts is a time of awakening for Draco--he’s learning to question that status quo as he’s introduced to opposing opinions. Granted, this early on in the book series he’s not ready to apply this critical thinking to his own family. That takes some time, and also is going to take a catalyst (like things getting bad for him and his family) before he’s able to do so. But, in the first three books he can at least figure out that he has a crush on Harry Potter.
“Ah, well in a shocking turn of events Potter, we seem to be in the same boat as far as bosses go” Draco drawled, inspecting his fingernails in an attempt to seem completely unaffected by an encounter with his school rival. “Where exactly were you getting food from?”
"I DON'T KNOW HOW." Draco replied. It felt good to get it out. "YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN."
Draco thought to himself.  He didn’t know a lot about Percy, but he knew enough to know a Weird Sisters concert was so far out of the realm of enjoyment for an uptight dud like Percy.  Now he was going to not only have to work late tonight, but he was also going to have to figure out a way to fix this in time to create the Christmas holiday Harry needed their bosses to take so badly. He pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath.  He would stay calm and he would solve this problem.
“I did.”
“Potter, you look like a fish. Just spit it out.” Pansy smirked
“You’re pretty cool and collected for a bloke who’s about to get married.” Harry said, while he adjusted his tie.
******************
Harry returned to Grimmauld Place with very little fanfare.  He had missed Ginny’s services while he was in St Mungo’s. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley had all stopped by briefly to check on him.  He turned them away so he could deal with his grief, guilt, and lycanthropy alone. It wouldn’t help them to know the role he played, or that he blamed himself for not being unable to save Ginny.
At the end of the last chapter, the seed had been planted that Draco could move on from the Dark Arts, and here is yet another moment to water that seed and help it grow into a redemption arc. Harry hadn’t personally witnessed anybody turning their back on the Dark Arts successfully before, but he can’t deny that he saw Dumbledore fight against them. Maybe there’s a chance that Draco, too, could change his mind. After all, Draco is only seventeen and he has the rest of his life ahead of him to see the error of his ways.
After the article about Hagrid comes out, Draco is the first to break the news to Harry. He plays it off like he didn’t want to be the one who told him, but honestly why else would Draco be carrying around a folded newspaper in his pocket if it WASN’T to bring it up to Harry and to have an excuse to talk to him.
“Well,” Harry paused.  He had tried to come up with ideas, but by the time he got home from work it took all of his energy to deal with Hermione and Ron who were always loudly arguing about wedding related things. Ron, having no experience with muggle weddings, could not wrap his head around some of the traditions that Hermione insisted were necessary for their celebration. “I thought about it...a little. But, err, I don’t really have any suggestions. We have to figure out a way to have them run into each other, right?”
“Oh, hello. Come in, I guess,” Roger said reluctantly.  “I wasn’t expecting you.”
Draco picked the letter up and read it quickly. It was from Cormac telling him that one of the chasers had backed out of the tournament, so please, for the love of merlin, find a seventh because he was too busy to find one himself.
“I’ll pay you back,” Harry was getting desperate now. “Double. Just please give me the pancakes.”

(640)
“It’s your name.”
“It’s been awhile since you were here for breakfast,” Cormac said groggily when he made his way downstairs a little while later. He sat down at the kitchen table across from Draco and snapped his fingers. The house elf came running over with a steaming mug and a plate of toast.
Plastering a smile on his face, Harry dropped the owl report in front of Percy, “Here you are…
“Fine, as long as he doesn’t slow us down,” Draco turned on his heel and headed back toward the forest with Neville and Harry close behind.
“Of course, any friend of yours is welcome here, there’s plenty of food.” Mrs. Weasley grinned, although it faltered slightly when Draco appeared from behind Harry. Draco stuck out his hand for a handshake, but she didn’t take it. Instead, she wrapped him up in a bear hug as well. “Happy Christmas!”
“What else did Pansy tell you last night?” Draco groaned and wondered if he had mentioned that Harry Potter was occupying some of his thoughts. “And why are you practically knocking down my door and bombarding me with questions this early in the morning?”
“Harry, mate, it’s getting late, yeah?” Harry attempted swiveling around to face the new and familiar voice but his sense of equilibrium was so far off, he fell right out of his seat and onto the ground in his attempt.
“I guess I haven’t really considered what happens AFTER the wedding... I’ve just been so caught up with the pomp and circumstance.”
“The clientele here isn’t ideal,” Draco said, also surveying the crowd. “You helped me pull off this first date for our bosses, so I’ll do you a favor. Pay your bill and follow me, Potter.” Draco left some coins on the counter and stood up heading towards the door.
“But I made samosas just for him!” Mrs. Weasley cried, holding the platter in front of her.
“Have you, Harry?  And here I was hoping you learned first impressions aren’t
Draco, without hesitating, grabbed Harry’s wrist and they spun out of sight.  Only Ginny had been close enough to see the exchange, and she smiled to herself as she explained to her mother a few minutes later that Harry was sorry that he had rushed off so quickly, but that he had a lovely time.
“I have to ask,” Harry began again. “What are you doing here this late? I really thought I was the last to leave the Ministry every night.”
"EXPECTO PATRONUM," he bellowed. As he flicked his wand the devil's snare creeped further up.
Harry closed his eyes and tried to think of a happy memory. But every time he did, he pictured Ginny's face and was reminded of the terrible day that turned him into a werewolf and a disgrace. He shook his head to clear it
“What makes you think everyone isn’t going to make fun of you for this?” George answered.
“Oh,” Harry said, clearly not expecting him to actually ask this. “He decided to try to profit off sleeping with me by writing to Pansy about our...relationship, if you could even call it that.”
(671)
“I’ll be quick, I promise.” Draco was beginning to wish that he had written something down. He preferred to be much more prepared than this, but there wasn’t enough time. “Oliver you’ve got to end this thing with Percy. You shouldn’t bring him to the Quidditch match, and more importantly you shouldn’t buy this house with him.”
He also makes a comment about how ‘they make them okay at Hogwarts’ when he’s looking over at the Ravenclaw table after the Beauxbatons students arrive. She’s also the first person that Harry asks to the Yule Ball. She, of course, says no because she’s going with Cedric. This leads Harry to make this startling realization:
“I’ll have what he’s having,” Oliver said, gesturing to Percy’s beer. He hadn’t pegged Percy as a beer guy, but he supposed the man might not be quite the same as he had been at Hogwarts.  A foaming pint appeared in front of him. He took a large swig and nodded at Percy.   Percy, slightly confused, nodded back. Oliver took this opportunity to speak,
Harry winced as the morning light shone through his shades on Monday morning.  Was there anything worse than blinding bright light when you were hungover?
In this same Potions class, Malfoy makes it known that he knows a lot about the Sirius Black situation. I’m not sure how much of the story he actually knows, but he knows enough about it to know that Harry should be bothered. All Draco should know is what the general public knows: that Sirius Black was arrested for murder and escaped prison. But he knows more than that. Surely, the story of his first cousin once removed is not something that is widely discussed in the Malfoy household. There’s no reason to discuss someone who has been burned off the Black family tapestry and if they really did believe that Sirius was the one who betrayed the Potters they wouldn’t want to talk about it since it was the day that Lord Voldemort was defeated. Which means that Draco Malfoy went out of his way to know a lot about Sirius Black because he cared about knowing anything and everything that had to do with his crush, Harry Potter.
I, uh, didn’t read the epilogue during this reread because I don’t like it. So, I give you permission to ignore this section as well.  Looking at the series as a whole, I think there’s room for fanfiction to pick up where the books left off and finish Draco’s redemption arc, which could involve Harry becoming friends (or lovers) with Draco.  The enemies plot and the groundwork for friendship are there, so now it’s up to the shipper to seal the deal.
“Right, thanks.” Harry sighed. “I, uh, have a lot to think about. If you don’t mind, I think I’d like to be alone right now.” Hermione went to protest, but Ron patted her shoulder and the two of them gathered their belongings and left.
“Not as much as I would have liked,” Harry sighed. “I drew some unwanted attention when I was out there.”
“Of course I hated you,” Draco replied. “But I also liked you. A lot. I was so concerned about blood status and how my family saw me that I was terrified by how I felt about you, so I may have overcompensated a bit.”
“No Professor,” Harry and Draco said in unison, and then they turned to glare at each other, as if it was a personal affront that the other person responded too.
"That happens sometimes, after a traumatic event," Neville said. "But you figured it out before, and you'll figure it out again."
(198).
The first five books are the foundation of The House of Drarry. We have cleared the construction site with my three steps to success and we have poured the foundation of enemies/rivals. But now, we shall start to see the fruits of our labor by building the framework of the house, which is of course, Half Blood Prince.
“I’m a what?” Harry asked, his brain taking a moment to register what Neville had said. “Right, yeah. Me. Werewolf. Awoooooo.”
“Yes, Percy.  Cormac and I are hardly
“And also, we only needed a chaser. The position of seeker has already been filled,” Draco snapped.
“Worse?” Harry said, pushing Draco’s legs off his desk. “How could this possibly have gone worse? They hated each other. That isn’t even close to what we wanted.”
“It’s not just that, it’s...” Harry trailed off. He thought about telling Oliver everything: that he and Draco had been pulling the puppet strings behind the scenes this entire time, that Draco knew better than anyone that Cormac’s relationship with Percy was not strictly work based, that Percy was just using Oliver to get a down payment on this house until Cormac made a commitment. But then he remembered the look on Draco’s face when he walked out of the flat the day before, and he hesitated.  This hesitation was enough for Oliver to turn his attention back to the work on his desk and dismiss Harry.
Meanwhile, Draco is stirring up trouble. By fourth year, he has figured out that the best way to interact with Harry while also hiding his true feelings is teasing. He also knows that he has to initiate contact because Harry certainly isn’t going to make the first move. At the World Cup, the Golden Trio happens to find Draco Malfoy in the forest. Sure, this could be a coincidence. But maybe Draco was keeping tabs on his favorite boy-who-lived. Then on the train, Draco seeks them out and appears in the doorway, once again inserting himself into Harry’s conversation.
“Oh,” Harry took a sip of his tea trying to hide the redness of his cheeks. “I guess...I guess I never really considered another option. Ginny just seemed like such an obvious choice. It’s certainly what has been expected of her and I for years.”
“Is that everything you remember?” Robards asked sternly.  Harry rubbed his head with his right hand.
“I have two questions for you.” Ginny squinted her eyes suspiciously. “Why were you fighting with Harry? And why were you both looking at the same house for your bosses?”
“Thank you.” Ginny whispered in his ear as he passed her to exit.
“Is everything okay out here, dumbass?” Pansy whispered harshly, sticking her head out the door and glaring in Draco’s direction.
Second, Ron and Hermione. “It’s not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, he had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later.” (283).  Ron and Hermione are at odds with each other for a lot of this book. In fact, the only time they seem to agree with each other is when Harry is obsessing over Draco and they roll their eyes or tell him to drop it. But, as mentioned previously, this constant bickering resulting in them ending up together is not a shocking turn of events for Harry because it’s the only sort of relationship he’s ever seen. Which means that Draco and Harry’s constant stream of insults and rivalry being the predecessor for an eventual relationship is not completely out of the question.
“Percy is gay?!” Harry exclaimed. Draco pressed his palm to his forehead.
If you’re still not convinced and require actual, canonical ,support of Drarry I have provided it. Proceed with caution.
“When can I get back to work?” Harry asked impatiently. Robard‘s eyes filled with pity.
“I guess.”
famous...
"Malfoy!" Harry yelled. "I think whatever this is, is afraid of light but I can't reach my wand. Can you send a patronus?"
Harry had sent an owl to Davies before shit hit the fan at work inviting him to be his plus one to Weasley Christmas and Ron and Hermione’s engagement party. It had been a bold move, but Harry prided himself on being a man of action.
“You’re probably right.  Gotta save some of my jokes for the reception anyway.” George winked as he went to grab his suit jacket off the hanger next to them.  Just then, a somewhat distressed Ginny popped her head in.
“To Gryffindor, I suppose,” Percy said while tossing his shot back. Oliver winced as he took his but for all Percy’s face gave away, he might as well have been drinking pumpkin juice.
“I did… but now I’m curious as to why we’re taking out the best bottle of liquor this old dodgy place has to offer?” Harry asked, genuinely confused why Ron had chosen the bottle they’d been saving for ‘truly good news.’
“Those sound truly fascinating. I’d love to see them.” The familiar voice spoke.
“Nothing besides you, love.” Pansy looked Draco dead in the eyes as she said it.
“It’s just, the wedding might be all we really get and agree on, you know?” Harry fiddled with the napkin in his lap.  “Ginny wants to go off and play for the Harpies. She’s not exactly interested in really settling down and starting a family.”
“Taking a risk? That doesn’t sound very much like Malfoy.” Harry pondered.
******************
“And also, we’ve been spending so much time together, it seemed like the next logical step on our relationship.”
“Well, I placed an order for take-away at that diner,” Harry pointed distractedly next door to the ATM. “But they only take cash, and I didn’t have enough muggle money on me and I really just don’t want to go back up and face Percy.”
(713)
From his new vantage point, Harry watched as panic rippled through the stands.  The overwhelming feeling of despair that suddenly filled his chest alerted him to the arrival of what was causing this mayhem: dementors. And not just one or two, which occasionally cropped up and were usually swiftly handled by the auror department. This was an entire hoard of dementors, more than Harry had seen in one place in a long time. A stag burst from his wand as he rushed towards the pitch.  The crowd raced and pushed their way towards an exit focused on saving themselves, but Harry only had eyes for the Quidditch teams who were wandless and under attack.
“I’m going to have dinner with Cormac McLaggen, I believe he was a year or two younger than you at Hogwarts.  He’s very well connected at the Ministry, and I think a relationship with him could be very advantageous.”
“Do you have plans today, Ginny?” Draco asked.
“I’m trying to apologize and tell you that you were right, you prat, just let me say I’m sorry!”  Draco pushed Harry’s shoulder playfully. “And thank you, you know, for not selling me out.  You could’ve so easily blamed everything on me and you didn’t. You were right about warning Oliver about Percy, and I should have told you sooner. I’m sorry that I pushed you to keep setting them up just for our benefit, and I’m sorry that you lost your job because of it.”
“I will.” Harry grunted while hoisting his other bag over his shoulder and limping toward the floo. Ron made a move to help him lift the trunk, but quickly thought better of it.  Harry hadn’t been exactly receptive toward unrequested help since the accident. Grabbing floo powder, Harry nodded at Ron and Hermione before yelling “Hogwarts!” and letting the green flames whisk him away.
I hesitate to bring this quote up as evidence of Drarry, but:
Meanwhile, Draco is having some self-reflection as well.  In Chamber of Secrets, Draco started figuring out some truths about himself. He was able to ignore them for several years and hide behind his pureblood security blanket. But now, in Half Blood Prince, Draco is starting to discover some truths about his family.
“Thank you for your concern, but I think I can handle picking some mallowsweet,” Draco sneered.
And it’s true. I disagree with a lot of Dumbledore’s actions, but I have to admit that he has a knack for understanding other people’s motivations, even if his own are questionable.  As Dumbledore is preparing for his death, he explains all of the ways that Draco is not a killer. He points out that Draco’s first few attempts were
“You know that the goblets refill automatically, right Malfoy?” Harry chuckled. “How much did you drink to have the house elves cut you off?”
Draco bent down, picked up the wand, tossed it to Harry and quickly scrambled down the hill back to the relative safety of the path.
The relaxed work environment that Harry and Draco had been enjoying since setting up their bosses came crashing to a halt the week before Christmas. Harry arrived at his desk ten minutes early, but found Percy standing in front of it with his arms crossed and a stack of papers already in his inbox. Draco found himself in a similar situation when he arrived to work that morning. The only difference was that while Percy was quietly seething at Harry’s desk, Oliver’s frustration had already boiled over. Draco had to duck as Oliver ripped a bat off his wall and hit a well aimed decorative bludger towards his head.  Oliver, having just noticed that Draco had entered the office, dropped the bat unceremoniously at his feet.
“Merlin knows I owe you that favor after all the times you’ve talked some sense into me.” Harry smiled back. “Now, I have to go perform my best man duties.  I’ll see you at the altar.” Harry squeezed Hermione’s shoulder as he walked toward the door.
(294) because he’s thinking about Draco.  Later in the book he’s almost late to a Quidditch match because he runs into Draco in the hallway and can’t decide if he should follow him or not.
“You know as well as I do that this is standard procedure, Mr. Potter. We have to do a full investigation any time there are casualties. From what you’ve told me, and from other eye witness accounts, it sounds like Ms. Weasley put up quite a fight out there. But she shouldn’t have been fighting in the first place, much like yourself.”
“Yes, I’ll, uhm, get right to that, Gin. Ron, George, be right back.” Harry began to leave the suite and tried to not let Ron know how panicked Ginny sounded and looked.
Chapter 2: I’ll Be Your Thrill
“He made himself comfortable at the Hog’s Head last night,” Neville explained. “So we’re here to pick up some ingredients for a hangover potion in addition to everything else.”
“Oliver, can I talk to you?” Harry asked the next day at work. He had been skulking around waiting for a chance to catch Oliver when Draco wasn’t present.
Harry and Draco reappeared in an alley a block from an Indian restaurant that was near the Ministry. Harry felt his stomach flip as he recovered from their abrupt disapparation. Their shoulders bumped into each other occasionally as they rushed to get to where delicious food was waiting for them. The thought quickly passed through Harry’s mind that the feeling in his stomach was not entirely unpleasant and he wondered if there was more to it than just the effects of side-along apparation.  He didn’t have time to dwell on it because he found himself seated at a table with a menu propped in front of him.
“Yeah, Hermione is constantly on me about my ‘savior complex’, I suppose she might have a point though,” Harry shrugged and brushed the torn napkin bits to the side of the table.
qualifications and yet… It. Doesn’t. Taste. Like. It.” Harry emphasized each word with a sharp jab to Draco’s chest. Draco, while somewhat matured from their Hogwarts days, was certainly not above rising to Harry’s bait.
“In the most basic way to human nature, Potter. Sex.” Draco responded. “You are familiar with sex, right?”
“Can I have your attention?” Hermione asked, tapping the side of her glass to get everyone’s focus.
“Ron! Ron!” Harry heard Hermione’s frantic whispers, and sensed movement in the corner as Hermione shook Ron’s shoulder. “He’s awake.”
people are too ignorant to acknowledge it.
“She’s in a full blown anxiety attack. Luna and I did our best to calm her down, but well, Luna isn’t exactly a wealth of comforting words at a time like this. And I’m not known for my bedside manner. I’m much too blunt for this type of thing.”
“Just because the outcome wasn’t what we had planned, doesn’t mean it was a failure.” Draco replied evenly. He waved his wand to straighten out the papers that had been displaced when his legs returned abruptly to the floor. “At least they interacted with each other. It would have been worse if they hadn’t acknowledged each other’s existence. We can learn from this and work it to our advantage.”
(174-175).  Then, when Harry finds himself in Malfoy Manor and up close and personal with Draco’s face, he notices that although he looks a lot like his father, Lucius, Malfoy’s expression was full of reluctance. Harry is starting to figure out that Draco Malfoy is not his father and that there’s still hope for him.
“I didn’t know how to say it without sounding like an absolute prat,” Roger said “So I hoped that by not responding you would understand.” Harry stared at him blankly.
“Because, as Ginny reminds me at every turn, ‘Hermione is much too good for me’. It’d be difficult to make fun of me for marrying someone out of my league.” Ron said with a self-satisfied smirk.
“It was a werewolf, Harry.” Hermione’s voice hitched slightly. “The wounds are cursed so it’ll take some time for them to heal, and as you know with Bill...they’ll never really heal properly so…”
“It. Contains. Everything. It. Should.” Draco mimicked Harry, poking his own finger into Harry’s shoulder. Then he added, in a much calmer tone, “I may have spent the better part of the last three years working on a variant that didn’t taste like it had been pilfered from the bottom of the lake.”
“I can’t tell you much, since you’re part of the investigation,” Robards answered. “But several wizards associated with former Death Eaters were apprehended at the crime scene. We have reasonable evidence to suggest that whoever fired the spell responsible for what happened to Ms. Weasley, also attacked you.”
“I brought a friend,” Harry said, carefully removing himself from her grip. “I hope that’s okay.”
“That’s only part of it,” Draco busied himself with eating his food, as Harry waited for more of an explanation. Instead of elaborating, Draco swore.
"I thought that I saw mallowsweet, but it was devil’s snare. And then Malfoy here wouldn't help me."
Finally, the gang ends up on the train.  The second that Ron comes into the train compartment and talks about Draco, Harry sits up straight and is way more engaged in the conversation.  He’s thinking about various theories regarding Draco when he’s interrupted to go to a Slug Club meeting which he uses an excuse to spy on Malfoy some more. First, he thinks about using the cloak to get a look at Malfoy on the way, but then when that doesn’t work, he follows Blaise into the Slytherin compartment. Also of note, this idea (to follow Blaise) interrupted his conversation with Ginny, and at this point the hints for them eventually getting together are in full force.  Giving Draco priority over Ginny is a big deal. Once in the compartment,
“We can’t keep doing this, I have to tell Oliver what’s going on.”
“For fucks sake, Potter,” Draco said. “If you were any slower you’d be moving backwards.”
Ron looked up and over at Hermione who was brushing away tears. He took a deep breath and explained to Harry that Ginny hadn’t made it.
“I’ll take it,” Harry smiled back and waved the waitress over to take their orders.
*** Please be advised major edits have occurred and the previous six chapters were edited/added to which results in a longer one chapter. We plan on there being 5 chapters total***
“You’re right, as usual.” Harry ruffled Ginny’s hair, “I’ve got some thinking to do and I know that this isn’t the right place for that.”
“Uh, huh. Sure. Okay. So...food?” the waitress asked again. She dramatically flipped the page over in her notepad.
“What do you mean, they don’t even like each other? Oliver seems pretty smitten to me.” Draco responded.
Ginny sat down on the foot of Draco’s bed and continued, “Pansy is worried about you. You’re incredibly overworked. But I think I have a solution. My brother is just his type, you should try setting Oliver up. Maybe then you can see Cormac more regularly.”
“But maybe more people would have died if I hadn’t been involved!” Harry argued. He could feel his eyelids getting heavy.
“I guess my ‘miserable mood’,” Draco sighed, replaying the events of the last week. “Probably started when I had a row with Har--, I mean, Potter in the terrace house we were looking at for our bosses.”
“I’ll think about it.” Draco answered quietly. “But working for Oliver hasn’t been so bad lately.”
“What can I say, l’ve always been a hopeless romantic for a getting together at a wedding story.” Ginny grinned as she grabbed Pansy by the waist and pulled her out towards Harry and Draco on the dance floor.
He was so caught up in the implosion of Percy and Oliver’s failed date (and the mountains of work that followed), that he hadn’t had time to think about the fact that Davies had never responded. But now that the Holiday Trip was back on, and Harry was back to a more manageable schedule, he realized that it had been several days since he had spoken with Hogwarts Hottie.
“Oi! My future wife is talking!” Ron bellowed when the conversation didn’t stop. “Thank you.”
“Evidently.” Draco said, staring hard at Cormac.
“I’d rather not have this cretin any closer to me if I can avoid it.” Draco finished, setting his wine glass on the table where it quickly refilled. Neville sighed.
I will leave you with the predecessor for the sexual tension of the sixth book duel:
“No, I’m not really in the mood for Quidditch right now because of…” Harry trailed off waving his hand dismissively, but Draco knew he was referring to Davies. “Besides, I don’t have a broomstick here.”
One of my favorite theories about Harry Potter is that he absolutely has a type and that is Quidditch Seeker. You’ll remember that I’ve already theorized that Draco only joined the Slytherin Quidditch team as Seeker because it was a way to get to spend more time with Harry (and an excuse to talk to him). Draco will inevitably become the fourth seeker that Harry will be attracted to.
“We don’t have time to explain, JUST GO.” A flash of light narrowly missed them and Harry wheeled around to see that the dementors were not their only problem. Magical Law Enforcement had been dealing with underground factions of former Death Eaters for several months, and it seemed as though one of these groups had decided to orchestrate this attack.  Harry shot a stunning curse toward one of the masked beings and looked around.  He saw Ginny hop off her broomstick.  Harry sent his patronus to clear a path and she ushered the rest of her teammates towards the relative safety of the locker rooms. He was relieved that Ginny was out of the fray, and turned back to survey the situation.
“Now that I have your attention,” Malfoy leaned on the desk. “Why did you let them go to a concert?”
“Yes, Potter,” Malfoy answered.  He had hoped that by picking the diner, Harry would feel as awkward as he did so they would be on more even ground. “It seemed like a fitting locale, since this is where it all began and now we’ve successfully convinced our bosses that they like each other so much that they’re going to move in together.”
line earlier, but I think making that the Drarry line is a mistake. Harry and Draco have been obsessed with each other since book one, Harry is just finally figuring it out. I think the more appropriate Drarry line from this book is this one:
Harry was still distracted by Draco in the back of the row that he all but missed the officiant saying Ron could kiss the bride.  He whipped his head around in time to watch his two best friends share an intimate kiss before joyful music began to play and sparks shot off behind the altar.
As the pair walked into the Ministry of Magic to finish their reports, Draco had a moment of regret. He really wanted to get a job without the help of his name to prove that he was different from his father, but Oliver Wood certainly tested his patience. He knew he would be stuck writing up the report about Quidditch pitch and supply quality while Oliver Wood reported on the more exciting play-by-plays. But that was the price he paid to be an assistant. What he really wanted was the British Quidditch League position, but the only way he’d’ be able to get it is if he dealt with whatever grunt work Oliver Wood threw at him.
“Harry,  your assistance,
“Sorry that I have the audacity to prefer a higher caliber of vocabulary. We can’t all grunt our way along with the language of a caveman.”
” She said, gesturing frantically for Harry to join her outside.
want to do with your life.  Being an auror was a great wish at 14 when the whole world was in wartime chaos… but we’ve all grown up and changed. Maybe it’s time your career path does too.” Ginny added, with more seriousness than she almost ever had around Harry.
******************
“I could say the same thing about you,” Ginny scowled. “You were just supposed to be a spectator at a quidditch game today. If you’re allowed to help out then so am I.”
All quotations in this chapter (unless otherwise noted) come from my copy of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (US hardcover edition, 2003)
Prisoner of Azkaban, though my favorite book, suffers from being the most re-read. It also doesn’t help that by book three of reading and taking copious notes, I’ve become a little bit bored. Especially because it’s more of the same vibe as the first two books. Draco and Harry are still firmly in the Enemies/Rivals phase, Harry has absolutely no idea that he’s bisexual, and Draco is still too afraid of his crush on Harry to make any real, life changes.
Harry and Draco sat down at a table and the same waitress as before brought them a menu. Draco glanced over the top of his menu at Harry.
******************
Harry was in the groom’s suite with Ron and George.  Ron was the most calm Harry had ever seen him.
“Yeah, sure whatever,” Draco said to the now closed door. “I’ll just find out who it really is in the morning if they haven’t already snuck out by then.”
Step One: read between the lines. Harry Potter is canonically a single-minded, himbo-in-training who does not understand his own feelings, so his thoughts and actions cannot be taken at face value. Consequently, we only see Draco through Harry’s bespectacled, unobservant eyes, which means the motivation behind any of Draco’s actions is up for interpretation.
Harry barely had enough time to catch his breath after delivering Percy’s unnecessarily complicated coffee order before Draco appeared out of nowhere in front of his desk.
“Mr. Potter, while I’m glad that you’ve made yourself at home, the feast is moments away from starting and you’ll miss the sorting if you don’t come to the Great Hall right this second.”  The patronus’s tail swished twice before vanishing. Harry stood up as quickly as he could, and started making his way to the start-of-term feast.
“Insufferable, really,” Ron added.  “Ow, still got that right arm on you!” He yelped as Hermione elbowed him in the ribs.
“It’ll also be good to spend some time together outside of work,” Oliver added. “It’s been awhile, you’ve been very busy.”
******************
“Yeah, he’s been an utter tit the past week. You’d think that he’d be happy to be free of that twat, McLaggen. And yet…” Pansy reached down and made a grab for one of the acid pops in Ginny’s lap.
“Cretin?” Harry’s chair squeaked as he scooched it closer to Draco. “You’re even a snob with your insults, Merlin.”
Harry skirted the edge of the party, staying close enough to the bar for a refill. But he made sure he always had a clear exit in case Draco happened to wander too close. The last time they spoke, Draco had made it clear that he would prefer that Harry never speak to him again. Although Harry was not usually one to shy away from confrontation, he felt like it was easier to just avoid any potentially awkward small talk all together.
Another thing to note in this scene, is that Draco is interested enough to strike up a conversation with Harry. Given Draco’s obvious disdain for anything that isn’t pureblood, it seems reasonable to assume that he wouldn’t just talk to anybody out there (heaven forbid he talk to a muggleborn accidentally), so something about Harry intrigued him enough to take that risk.
“You set Oliver up with...
“Haaaaaarry Potter,” Ginny sang as she walked over to him. “Dance with me.” She grabbed his hands and pulled him out on the dance floor.  Harry put his hands on her waist as they swayed to the beat of the music.
“Goddamnit, Ginny” Harry muttered at the insufficient funds error on the ATM screen before looking up at Draco.
“Yes, now please finish clearing out your desk and leave as soon as you’re finished with that.”
?” Harry asked. Neville nodded, and Harry promptly turned his head and threw up into the grass.
“Smooth, Potter,” Draco said, waving his wand to clean up the mess. “What’s wrong with him?” He directed towards Neville.
As McGonagall spoke, Draco continued to sip his wine. He was acutely aware of Harry’s presence a few seats away from him. He tried to focus on McGonagall’s speech but the entire situation was making him feel very antsy.
"It can't be that secret if they trusted you with it."
“Well, I think we should set them up,”
“I don’t give a flying fuck what you think, Potter” Draco spat. “You already took the potion, so if I had messed with it, it’s little late now, huh?” Draco went to turn away but Harry roughly grabbed his arm and spun him around to back him into the wall.
The first mention of Draco Malfoy in Chamber of secrets is in the first chapter, when Harry Potter is desperate for Hogwarts interaction and is even willing to admit that he’d be glad to see Draco just to make sure that he hadn’t imagined his entire first year. Draco’s name pops up again twenty pages later when Harry is rescued from Privet Drive by the Weasleys and taken to The Burrow via Flying Ford.
“Percy, probably,” Oliver grumbled and narrowed his eyes. “He works here in the ministry, but I’m not sure I would have pegged him for a gambling man.”
shitty.” Draco replied. “But it seems like Quidditch helped, and you know I wouldn’t have let Pansy run that article even if she wanted to.”

Draco Malfoy clearly can’t stop talking about Harry Potter. Their summer holidays are only like two months long, so if Lucius is not exaggerating, Draco brings up Harry Potter more than once a week.
“Thanks, Headmistress.” Harry responded, eager to be alone again.  While he knew solitary confinement was bad for his ‘emotional healing’ as Hermione put it, it was certainly better for the unbridled anger he always had bubbling under his skin since the incident.  McGonagall seemed to accept Harry was not in the mood for further interaction and nodded at him before turning around and briskly walking away.
At quarter till, Percy Weasley strode into the Leaky Cauldron looking a bit put out and headed towards the bar. Draco and Harry shuffled closer to each other with pained looks on their faces, and Harry swung his invisibility cloak over both of their heads.
Harry gulped,audibly, but managed to pull himself together, “No, just, uhm, surprised, I guess.  Figured you’d end up with a nice pureblood witch.”
“Oliver!” Harry couldn’t hide his shock.
“Shunpike!” Draco exclaimed. Harry raised an eyebrow, not following Draco’s train of thought. “He works in the Magical Maintenance Department and owes me a favor. If we can get Percy and Oliver into a lift at the same time, then I bet Stan can get it to stop.”
“I hope your momentary stroke of genius pays off,” Draco hissed in Harry’s ear as they rounded the corner of a shortcut and hurried to the maintenance room where they could watch their plan unfold.
“Didn’t understand that what we were doing was wrong.” Draco pressed on.
“Oh wonderful! I’m looking forward to this. I haven’t had seats this good to a Quidditch match since the World Cup was in England and I went with my family!”
“Cheers!” Ron yelled boisterously.  Harry clinked his glass with Ginny and Pansy.  He was happy for his best friends, but he couldn’t help feeling wistful about not having that type of bond for himself.
“You remember Ginny Weasley, I’m sure,” Draco said gesturing to the redhead next to him as an introduction. Cormac was beaming.
“What do you need?” Oliver asked impatiently. “The portkey will be ready any minute.”
“If only we could coordinate them getting stuck in one of these,” Harry said, tapping the wrought iron frame of the lift. “It would definitely be a conversation starter, but I have no idea how we’d pull it off.”
***********
“Yes, ok. When will dinner get here?” Percy asked, without looking up at Harry. Harry wasn’t sure what irked him more: the fact Percy expected dinner without ever having asked for it, or the fact he was going to have to figure out what Percy wanted without giving away the fact he hadn’t expected Percy to want anything at all.  Harry stared down at his hand where
“Interested,” Oliver repeated absentmindedly. But Draco had worked for Oliver long enough to recognize the wheels turning in his head. He slipped out of the office as Wood distractedly tapped his quill on the desk.
“Agreed,” Harry responded. The thought of Percy finding out that he was interfering with his love life was a little concerning, but having a social life again would be worth the risk. Harry tapped his wand on the wall to call the lift. “Why don’t we have them run into each other, casually, in the office?”
Draco walked through the front door of the flat that he and Pansy shared. He immediately noticed two pairs of shoes tucked into the corner by the door to Pansy’s room, and a denim jacket thrown over a chair that he knew he’d never seen Pansy wear.
This is not something that Draco has ever done, perhaps his brush with death has made him bolder. He then spends the entire class making innuendos (bad ones, because he’s 13) while also having Harry help him with his potion ingredients (
” Ginny asked incredulously.
“Possibly, but based on all of the testimony we’ve received, your involvement with the auror office is too much of a liability. Now please, get some rest.”  As Robards left the room, Harry drifted off into a fitful sleep wracked with nightmares of the Quidditch game and what his future would hold.
“I assumed it was your idea!” Draco exclaimed.
talk him out of it?”
(129). It’s not just Harry being obsessed in the immediate moment of action, now he’s dwelling on it. And he will continue to dwell on thoughts of Draco Malfoy. He spends an entire page theorizing about Draco, and Ron and Hermione remain unconvinced and even share skeptical glances at each other.
The tea kettle began to glow a radiant blue behind them, but nobody reached for it.  Draco wasn’t used to being this honest and open, but he knew he was running out of time, so he powered through.
The pair made their way back to the bar to order another round.  This time Harry chose the beverage: a deep red drink with gold smoke billowing from the surface.
The sun was only just beginning to rise when Harry woke up.  After weeks of taking the dreaded early-morning shift at the Auror Office, he had hoped that on his day off he would be able to sleep in, but no such luck.  The only thing that Harry had planned for the day was attending the Holyhead Harpies’ game.  He didn’t need to be at the Quidditch pitch until the late afternoon, so Harry took his time getting ready and cleaned up Grimmauld Place a little.  He wanted to invite Ginny over after the game, hopefully to celebrate her win, so he thought it was probably a good idea to put away his laundry and make sure that no unwanted magical creatures had made a home in any of the less frequented rooms.
Harry was speechless. He couldn’t decide what felt worse: to be fired by Percy Weasley, of all people, or to know that his dream of becoming an auror was crumbling in front of him.
“Well maybe I don’t order it for me,” Draco said sheepishly.
Draco, thoroughly confused why Cormac was entertaining anyone other than him at 8PM on a Friday night, managed to pull his wits together.
“It makes sense, with our combined incomes we can afford some place much nicer and closer to work.” Percy added.
“Oh, we’re not-”
Ginny thought to herself. To Draco she exclaimed, “But I didn’t mean Percy, you absolute dunderhead! I meant my brother Charlie.”
It took a few days, but the vintage pinot from Oliver (provided by Draco) and a bouquet of roses adorned with small, enchanted broomsticks with a small handwritten note signed by Percy (but purchased by Harry) seemed to do the trick. Harry left the office on time, and felt particularly good about how this was all going.
Harry doesn’t know that this is Malfoy yet, but he figures it out when he sees Draco’s dot in a bathroom with Moaning Myrtle later. He interrupts and they fight. Harry immediately regrets the spell that he used, even though it was in self-defense, and he falls to his knees besides Malfoy trying to save him.  The scenes after this duel are primarily about the horcrux and his trip with Dumbledore, but his main concern before he left was Draco. So yeah, sure, Harry, you
Ginny’s voice broke Draco out of his reverie. “I heard you finally realized I’m here for Pansy and not just for laughs?” Ginny chuckled as she leaned against the door frame. Draco covered his head with his quilt.
Harry Potter accused Draco of faking his injury in an attempt to get Hagrid fired. Harry assumes that the other benefits are making him and Ron do his potions work. But there were benefits Harry never considered. So far, the only times that Draco is able to interact with Harry are when he seeks him out to make fun of him, or on the Quidditch pitch (which as mentioned, I think Draco only joined for Harry). By faking this injury, he’s also able to use it as an excuse to sit next to Harry in Potions, a class in which he is otherwise expected to sit with the Slytherins, and nobody else (especially not Harry Potter) will think it’s for any other reason.
(196)
The potential for a shift in attitude regarding Draco is also established in Hagrid’s hut after the article about Hagrid being half-giant is published.  Hagrid is obviously very upset about it. Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, and Harry all try to comfort him by giving him examples of people who do like him and are happy that he is at Hogwarts. Hagrid points out that it’s okay for other people to not be universally liked, because at least they’re not half-giant. Harry immediately speaks up and reminds Hagrid that he has shitty relatives too. Dumbledore provides further evidence of shitty relatives by telling them about Aberforth and his preoccupation with goats. The point that both Harry and Dumbledore were trying to make, is that it’s possible for a person to have problematic family members without being problematic themselves. This logic, I think, could be important in Harry eventually being able to accept Draco. If he is willing to accept that he (Harry) is a decent person despite being raised by the Dursleys, he should be able to forgive Draco for having Lucius as a father (this is of course, assuming that Draco has made some life changes and is committed to becoming a better person, which I think he’s on the path to doing by the end of the series).
Draco was so busy feeling sorry for himself that he didn’t notice the man stepping back from the ATM and collided with him.
You could say that when it comes to plot, this is where we Set It Up
“It’s about Percy.” This caught Oliver’s attention. “I don’t think that you should move in with him.  I think it’s too fast, and I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
"I don't know Neville," Draco muttered. "I think maybe this one has already come true." He narrowed his eyes at Harry, only to discover that Harry was already glaring back at him.
“Wow, Potter. It’s truly a wonder they didn’t promote you straight to Head Auror with those keen observational skills.” Draco drawled sarcastically.
He loved his mother dearly, but he had made it a point to avoid going to Malfoy Manor to visit.  It wasn’t that he didn’t want to see her, it was just that being in the house that morning had reminded him of a lot of bad memories of his teenage years and of his father. As soon as he had finished his filial duties, he quickly spluttered out a ‘have to get to a Quidditch Match’ and ‘love you’, and left.
“No doubt,” she took in his disheveled appearance. “I figured it would be harder for you to refuse the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor if I made my case in person.” McGonagall took a seat in the armchair opposite Harry and crossed her legs.
“Your boss is Percy?!” Draco guffawed. “Oh that is rich.” He backed away quietly, hoping that Harry wouldn’t notice. Luckily for Draco, he had plenty of muggle money on hand just in case there were muggles to bribe near the Quidditch match earlier.
If Draco had his way, he would have continued to avoid Harry Potter for as long as he was employed at the Ministry of Magic. He spent a not insignificant amount of time replaying the events of Christmas Day in his mind and he’d never be able to look Potter in the face after his unceremonious departure.
“Let me spell it out for you,” Draco said, pulling out a notebook. “We are essentially in charge of Percy and Oliver’s lives” Draco paused because Harry looked like he was going to interrupt, but Draco stopped him. “Don’t deny it, I know you have a calendar for Percy just like I have a calendar for Oliver. We can just...make them ‘accidentally’ meet up at the same time.”
"What?" Harry called out. "Did you say something? Are you making a patronus?"
but he apparently had since he was woken up by a very aggravated silvery cat patronus.
“Actually,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I think I should go with Draco.”
“I’m covering the Quidditch match between the Harpies and the Cannons for The Prophet today, and I figured Oliver was going to make you go to report on, I don’t know, something boring probably,” Ginny crossed her arms and shrugged. “She also mentioned again that you were more fun to be around when you actually had time to shag your boyfriend. Can’t say I think highly of your choice in men though, McLaggen was such a prat in school.”
“You really thought this through,” Harry responded once he had a chance to let it sink in. “If only you could apply this same work ethic to your actual job.” Harry waved his finished report in Draco’s face and pointed to Draco’s abandoned report. Harry cleared up the empty bottles and packed up his stuff.
During the day, Harry was thankful for the open floor plan in the Improper Use of Magic Office. The constant stream of people running in and out, and the fluttering of paper airplane memos overhead almost made him forget that he was stuck on desk duty for the foreseeable future. Almost. But now that the work day had ended, and everyone else hurried out of the office towards the magical toilets and floo powder fireplaces, the empty desks mocked Harry.
“Well that was certainly eye-opening, Cormac. Thank you ever so much for letting me know we had apparently broken up.” Draco said pointedly.
“What do you think I’m possibly going to do in the forest, Potter? Sacrifice a unicorn to bring You-Know-Who back? Perform an elaborate ritual to break Death Eaters out of jail?
“Err, hello, Professor,” Harry replied clumsily. “I wasn’t expecting you.”
“That explains the pain,” Harry said through gritted teeth.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.” She said warmly.
“I have to ask--”
******************
, Oliver thought to himself as he made his way toward the floo and the large glass of firewhiskey that would be waiting for him at his flat.
“Well… Wasn’t Ginny’s initial interest in you because you were famous and her brother’s best friend?” Draco questioned, “And besides, just because you defeated a Dark Lord doesn’t mean that there aren’t people out there who like you for you… And maybe you wouldn’t have to look that far to find them.” Draco paused, his pulse racing. Then added quietly, “Maybe they’re in this diner.”
“What about him?” Draco asked Harry, tilting his head toward a slender man with cropped dark hair and a tattoo running up his right bicep.
“Am I interrupting something, boys?” McGonagall asked.
“Well,” Draco threw back his drink. “If it’s not too late when I leave here, I’ll go over to Cormac’s for the night and we can finally have breakfast together. We’ve been talking about it for ages, but I’m always working too early in the morning.”
Draco wasted no time in exiting the office and opening the note.
“Those were excellent seats...” Percy folded up the paper and stuck it in the pocket of his robes. “I have to admit that it does sound like Oliver Wood is at least more competent than Ludo Bagman was.”  This, Harry knew, was as close to a compliment as he could have hoped for from Percy. When they returned to their office, Harry sent off a memo to tell Draco that the seeds had been planted and he was ready for phase two.
Draco handed Madame Pomfrey the goblet and turned to leave, but noticed that she had promptly handed the goblet to Harry who was looking at it suspiciously. He stopped in his tracks.
“Tick-tock, tick-tock.” Pansy pointed at her wrist where there wasn’t even a watch.
Draco got off on Harry’s floor and rolled his shoulders to release some of the kinks that had developed from being hunched over his desk all day.  Oliver’s foul mood had translated to a work day that rivaled some of his worst pre-set up days.  When Draco rounded the corner to Harry’s desk, he quickly realized Harry’s day hadn’t been much better.  Harry was sitting in his chair with his head down on his desk, lightly banging it against the wood and muttering to himself.
“Oh, it’s yOu. Neville! Have you always been so tall?” Harry asked from the sticky floor.
“And how am I supposed to know about Oliver’s accomplishments?” Harry asked.
“Yes. It was your idea! Remember?”
“Wouldn’t Percy be invited? If it’s a Weasley family party?” Draco was confused.
“Please, at this point, you can call me Minerva.”
If you take Harry’s acceptance of Dumbledore being a fool at seventeen and learning the error of his ways, Regulus’s attempt to take down Voldemort but keep it secret because he was trying to protect his family, and the transformation that Kreacher underwent when he was finally shown love, you can start to see Draco’s redemption arc. Going back to the sixth book when Narcissa declares that Draco is too young to understand, Draco going along with trying to murder Dumbledore not because he wants to do it but because it would protect his family, and the mercy that he’s shown in that moment by Dumbledore...Draco is well on his way to being redeemed. It’s just going to take Harry Potter putting the pieces together for it to happen.
“Err, yes, I’ll let Malfoy know. What do you have planned instead? You don’t have any other appointments for tonight.” Harry asked curiously.
“To send the most dull and conservative person alive to a rock concert? You may think I’m slow, Malfoy, but even I could see that spelled trouble”
“There are other ways to save the day besides being a glorified wizard cop. Especially if it’s motivated at all by trying to prove that frilly pink toad wrong“
“Yes, I think you’re right about that.” Neville said patiently.
“Uh, thanks.” Harry was taken aback slightly. “Do you want to go to The Burrow with me?” The words tumbled out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them.
“Oh,” Harry stuttered. “Oh my. That’s. That’s amazing!!” He stood up and gave  them both a hug. He tried to ignore the tightness in his chest as he thought about how his two best friends were making this important life step without him. He didn’t want to be left behind, and yet, they were moving into unchartered territory and he was stagnant. Harry squirmed out of the group hug when he noticed that Ron and Hermione were focused very intently on each other, and went back to his spot on the couch. He flicked his wand and turned on his portable TV to distract himself as Ron and Hermione, still embracing, backed towards the stairs to head to the room that they shared.
“Great, so you have captaincy in common,” Draco said, pushing Harry closer to Davies. “I’ll let you two talk about that, I think I see my boyfriend over there.”
“I didn’t know werewolves could get this drunk,” Harry said to himself. Then he turned to Neville and said in what he believed was a whisper but was definitely not, “I’m a werewolf, Neville.”’
“We can’t keep lying to Oliver and Percy.  We can’t let them buy this, or any, home together!”
If Chamber of Secrets was the beginning of Draco’s clarity, then Goblet of Fire is the start for Harry.  There were hints about a crush on Cho Chang in Prisoner of Azkaban, but by Goblet of Fire Harry has finally discovered romantic feelings--not that he has any understanding of them whatsoever. And to quote Hermione after the first task when Ron and Harry are forced to deal with emotions they don’t understand:
“I know. The emotional labor of explaining their own feelings to them is
"Doubtful," Harry said. "But now I'm curious, so please enlighten me."
“I’m not sure about that, I heard a very different story about your level of ‘poise’ during Quidditch tryouts sixth year.” George teased.
“Where did you have in mind? Hopefully not anything that’ll keep me too late, I’m hoping to see Cormac this evening.”  Harry tried not to be disappointed that Draco was still going to McLaggen’s.  Harry had hoped Draco would’ve cut him off after the quidditch incident, but apparently Draco didn’t realize he deserved better.
