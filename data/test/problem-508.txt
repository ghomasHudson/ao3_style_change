“Oh,” Draco says, surprised but pleased. “That’s very thoughtful, thank you. I usually take as many as can fit the mug.”
What happens after that is a blur. The last thing that Draco remembers clearly is Potter telling him to
“Oh,” Draco says again, stunned. He searches Potter’s face for hints that he’s misheard, but there’s only Potter’s smiling at him, a smile as warm as the sun and bright like starlight, a hopeful question in his eyes. “Did you say dinner?”
"Potter," Draco says, and his voice comes out raspy and urgent. A slow smile breaks across Potter’s face, and Draco realises with slow, burning indignation that Potter
Unhappy at all the faces looking at its food, it leaps off his plate and takes to the air, making a protective circle that spirals wider and wider until it’s circling Draco. It lets out a tiny roar of displeasure at Pansy and Blaise, who sit on either side of Draco, and they promptly shift further down the table and away from the dragon that’s now snapping at thin air.
Harry didn’t think it was possible, but the bathtub of the Blue Room is equally unusable. To Malfoy’s apparent relief, the taps turn. To Malfoy’s obvious disgust, no water comes out, no matter which direction he twists the taps.
“Quiet, Zabini,” Draco says, and holds his cup out for a refill. “No nagging till I get my coffee. You know the rules.”
It doesn’t take long for Draco to get used to this, to Potter waiting for him in the mornings with a grin and a "breakfast?", or to Potter chewing on his quills and spinning around on his swivel chair as he flips through the case files, idly throwing out ideas. This becomes Draco’s new normal, and he even grows used to the way Potter steals his coffee and buys him another one to make up for it.
“Malfoy, you are such a prat,” Harry says, but instead of getting angry, he’s laughing, the corners of his eyes crinkled in amusement.
“So, you’ll be your usual self then,” Harry says, looking down at his cup of Butterbeer suspiciously. He tilts it this way and then, watching the liquid slosh inside the cup, then abruptly sets it down on the table and takes a careful step away from it.
“You mean ‘brilliant’,” Malfoy corrects, smiling serenely. “Of course I am. That is both my gift and my curse, to be brilliantly underappreciated by the common folk. I have learnt to live with it.”
?" Potter says, staring at Cheng Wu in a manner that could almost be called unfriendly, at the same time that Draco says, "Erm, we’re not–we’re–we work together. In the same Ministry."
There’s a long pause. “Erm, I was talking to the dragon actually,” Potter says, very clearly trying not to laugh, “but erm, yeah. Good night, Draco.”
Draco’s contemplating if he can bring himself to try a Very Berry Whiskey when a familiar voice says from behind him, “I wouldn’t, unless you enjoy tooth-achingly sweet things.”
Potter does so, laughing. The flurry of snowflakes that flew in with him melts on the doormat as he stamps his shoes. His cheeks are pink with cold, and the lower half of his face is hidden under a mountain of a scarf that he begins to unwind. He looks adorable, even bundled up as he is, and Draco turns away to hide the sudden flush that rises hot against his cheeks.
Potter’s frown softens even further until he just looks puzzled, but he obediently bends forward to give a dragon a cursory once-over. “Yeap,” he says, “it’s definitely mine.”
It takes a long time before Harry finally feels the potion loosen its hold. As soon as he does, he grabs the potion cleanser and drains it dry in one gulp.
“What about brooms?” A familiar voice says, and Draco silently curses his luck before he turns around, a smile plastered across his face. Potter’s wearing one of his Weasley jumpers—this one is bright red, with the ‘H’ knitted in a shade of buttery yellow, and it’s old and hangs slightly off one broad shoulder. It’s one that he’s worn countless times before, and is clearly a favourite. It’s Draco’s favourite too, as his gaze lands on that tanned patch of skin tucked in-between the curve of Potter’s neck and the collar of his jumper.
, Harry thinks. He drinks some more, and continues reading, and finds himself giggling at the financials that chart the rise and fall of the latest wizarding stocks. It’s dull and boring and a section that he normally skips, but somehow he can’t help laughing as he looks through a row of meaningless numbers.
“It’s our galaxy,” Malfoy says before Harry can ask. “I went through a phase where I was really into astronomy at one point, and Mother redid my room as a Christmas present for my fourteenth birthday, and I know, I know, what twenty-eight year old still has astronomy wallpaper tacked up in his room, right?” He gives a short, embarrassed laugh. “Anyone would have taken it down ages ago, but it took Mother a tremendous amount of effort to do, and anyway, I like the reminder that there’s something bigger than us out there, and I guess I should probably stop trying to salvage my reputation here.”
The light slanting through the trees is warm and gentle on their faces, and Harry’s trying to argue about the chances of the Falmouth Falcons, the uninformed fool, and wincing because one of the Horntail’s claws have gotten tangled in that shaggy mess he calls his hair again. It’s roaring its tiny roar of frustration, but Harry doesn’t stop; just carries on arguing and walking while he fumbles blindly trying to get it out, and gets badly nipped for his effort.
“You’re mental,” Harry says, but smiles as he says it, and his smile is somehow warmer against the light from the sconces lining the dungeon walls.
They end up sitting there talking until they’re almost late for work, and end up having to speed-walk back. When they part ways again in the lifts, Draco expects that that will probably be the last he sees of Potter for another five years.
"Oh," Draco says, nonplussed. His eyes flick around the room. His desk is the only clean spot in the chaos of files littered on the floor, and in contrast, it looks like a giant went rampaging through the rest of the office.
Potter just moans louder in response, his lips tightening around Draco’s cock, and Draco’s hips automatically snap forward on their own accord as he comes unexpectedly. His body curves gracefully over Potter as he comes, his hands tightening in Potter’s hair, groaning as he rides out the last waves of ecstasy that rack his body.
“Uh.” Harry gently prises Malfoy’s fingers off and steps back, trying not to stare too obviously at the way Malfoy’s wet shirt clings to his chest. The distance gives him time to regroup, and his brain thankfully comes back online. “I’m fine. Just got a bit wet, that’s all. What about you?”
a prat,” Harry says with feeling. Still, he can’t help but laugh, partly due to the intense relief that Malfoy
He leaves as the morning rush begins, ducking hurriedly out the door to a flurry of sudden whispers, but he already knows he’s coming back.
"Potter," he says, voice low, and Potter turns to him, swinging his wand. The light spills over Draco and off a row of the stolen dragon scales, each one palm sized and strung up neatly on a thin metal wire that spans the entire length of the warehouse. Potter takes a step back and lifts his wand higher, and the light runs down the length of the wall to illuminate the entirety of the stolen exhibits, a multitude of dragon fangs and claws and scales and horns that glimmer iridescently under the light.
,” Harry says indignantly, “and I was told that there was an amnesty declared for the party today. Came to see if it was true.”
"Oh." The animosity leaves Potter’s face, and he belatedly sticks out a hand and introduces himself. "I’m Harry," he says to Cheng Wu, although he’s looking at Draco, and there’s something loaded in his expression.
The smell of treacle tart wafts all around the room until his stomach growls. There’s a familiar aroma underlying it that Harry
Malfoy shrugs. “Couldn’t lift my arms to towel it dry. It’s fine. You want something to drink? Tea, something stronger?”
He debriefs Fossey on the events of the previous night. She sighs when he tells her Potter’s suggestion and says exactly what he predicted she would say: that they hardly have the manpower to deal with their current workload, much less set watches. They beef up the wards on the evidence storeroom, but that’s the most that they have the capacity for. Draco doesn’t tell her about Potter’s offer to speak with Robards–as sincere as Potter was, Draco doesn’t think that he’ll get anywhere with Robards, and there’s no use getting Fossey’s hopes up unnecessarily. Debriefing done, Draco settles in for a long day: he’s still got two more boxes of files to get through before the meeting, and an entire office to help clean up.
They stay like this for long moments, breathing in the feel of each other’s bodies in the dark. Potter stroking Draco’s skin with his thumb, over and over again, pulling something warm and dark to the surface every time he does it. Potter’s hard against him again, and Draco’s own erection presses back against the inside of Potter’s thigh. They remain as still as statues, politely not mentioning each other's arousals, until Potter begins to fidget again.
He hurries into his clothes, still sleep-muddled and clumsy. By the time he’s done he’s woken up enough to send off an urgent owl to Potter, but completely forgets that Potter had worked his own ping into the tracking and tracing spells. He startles when the owl comes back less than five minutes later, carrying Potter’s chicken scratch of a scrawl informing him that Potter’s waiting outside the Malfoy gates, because the wards won’t let him in.
Malfoy coughs some more until his entire face is pink, and doesn’t reply. He’s still not looking at Harry, but it doesn’t matter. Harry knows he’s right. Still, he has to summon every ounce of his Gryffindor courage to say, “Because I feel something for you, you dolt,” and it’s worth it, to see Malfoy’s gaze snap up, to see an expression of wonder spread across his face.
Harry has never in his entire life wondered what Malfoy smelt like, and now he’s grappling with exactly what he’s supposed to do with this new-found knowledge. He’s suddenly very conscious of the fact that if he turned his head just the slightest fraction, his lips would brush against Malfoy’s cheek.
Cheng Wu blinks innocently back at him. "I’m sorry, but I don’t understand English," he says in perfect English, and laughs uproariously when Draco pulls a face of utter disgust and scowls at him.
The scent hits him again, stronger now that he’s standing right in front of the cauldrons, and he breathes in deeply, trying to identify what it is that he’s smelling. For a long moment there’s nothing but the quiet hiss of the flames as the potion simmers.
Harry fully intends to take a quick shower and Floo straight to the pub to drown himself in drinks like Malfoy had presumed, but the hot water turns out to be a soothing balm for his tired shoulders and his bad mood. It washes away both the dirt and the irritation that settles over him, and he doesn’t think about Malfoy, or about why he’s so irrationally annoyed at Malfoy keeping things from him. Harry stays underneath the hot spray, his mind a blissful blank, until his fingers begin to wrinkle.
"Why, yes," Draco says, surprised. "But Fossey’s got me working on a huge dragon smuggling case, and we’ve got an international meeting with our Hong Kong counterparts in three days, and-"
The coffee’s still warm and goes down smooth and easy. There’s the slightly sweet aftertaste of chocolate, and a happy warmth begins to spread slowly throughout his body as Harry drains the last drop. It almost feels like he’s being enveloped into a comforting hug, and suddenly the day looks a lot brighter. Grudgingly, Harry can see how Espresso Patronum became so popular.
“Right,” Harry says, but he doesn’t move. He watches Malfoy stand there with his head lowered, and fights the urge to break something.
“Enjoy,” Graham says monotonously as he slides a mug over the counter to Harry. He doesn’t even bother ringing Harry up, just goes back to his book and ignores the money that Harry leaves on the counter.
“Get off,” he snaps, harsher than usual because his partner is dying and there’s an assassin trying to kill them and he has no time for niceties. They make it to the door.
Cheng Wu has to head back to Hong Kong for the press conference, so Draco volunteers to escort him to the Port points. Potter doesn’t say anything, just darts them a look and follows Fossey back to the office silently.
The dragon perches at the edge of Draco’s plate, greedily gobbling up the small chunks of steak that he cuts for it. It eyes Theodore suspiciously, one claw placed protectively over its food as it bares its teeth.
Harry stands before his open locker and stops in the middle of shucking off his trousers, his ears pricked and listening. It’s just gone past six on a particularly brutal day of Auror training, and almost everyone has had their shower and cleared off for the pub. The air in the locker room is still heavy and damp with steam, and it clings uncomfortably to his skin; condenses into tiny drops of water that run down his bare chest. He wipes it away absently, still listening, and hears it again.
"Some of us aspire not to be like you, you absolute disaster of a human being." Draco flicks a scornful finger at Potter’s messy hair, currently made worse by his bedhead, and Potter merely grins in reply.
"Oh," Potter says slowly. "I—I thought—" He doesn’t finish the sentence. There’s a look of hurt scrawled on his face as plain as day, as if Draco were the one who had betrayed him, who had told him that he wouldn’t have, not with
They maneuver Malfoy back onto the bench and Harry gingerly runs a hand over Malfoy’s left shoulder to check for bumps. It doesn’t escape his notice how Malfoy goes quiet and still under him, body tense against his touch.
“It’s nothing you haven’t seen before, Potter, there’s no need to concern yourself with protecting my maidenly virtue,” Malfoy says, huffing out a laugh. But he winces and stops, his shirt bunched up around his chest. His face is strained with discomfort. “I think you might have to cut this off me. I can’t lift my arms up.”
"A sensible suggestion," Draco says, which is how, for the second time in his life, he ends up finding himself in a cupboard with Potter.
Disappointment rises up and sits heavy in his stomach as he walks back, until he rounds the corner and sees Malfoy sitting on the bench in front of his locker, his left arm tucked protectively against his chest. Malfoy’s still in the same clothes as before, his right arm resting across his knees and his head bowed low as he curls into himself.
“Can I–I’m going to wash your hair now,” he says. Below him, Malfoy nods and tilts his head back until it rests against the rim of the tub.
"Hang on. Did you know that this was happening? Did Potter tell you what he was going to do?" Draco demands.
“Perfect,” Potter says, and smiles down at where the Horntail’s trying to bite his fingers. Privately, Draco wonders whether Potter’s a masochist. Potter had one of the greatest dark wizards of their time as his own personal nemesis, is constantly getting himself into situations where he ends up injured, and on top of that, has now procured himself a pet whose primary function appears to be the maiming of his fingers.
"What– how–" Draco hugs him back, too relieved for words, and is startled to discover that he’s trembling from tension and the adrenaline.
"Alright, alright," Potter interrupts, with a desperate glance at his wristwatch. "There’s no time. Look, we’re staging an ambush. We got a tip-off that your offices are going to be broken into and that someone’s after some exhibits in the evidence storeroom, so could you just get into this cupboard with me and stay quiet?"
. That was—well. He couldn’t very well yell at his boss for being far more perceptive than Harry gave him credit for, but it didn’t mean he couldn’t be annoyed about it.
“Potter,” Malfoy replies, and stands up, wincing. Before Harry can stop himself, he takes an instinctive step forward, hand outstretched. He catches the underside of Malfoy’s left arm—his bad arm, Harry realises too late—and any lingering awkwardness between them is swept away by concern as Malfoy swallows back a gasp.
Draco turns his attention back to his housemates just as Theodore says decisively, “It can’t be Potter’s. He hates Draco.”
Draco doesn’t need any more convincing. He all but shoves his way in and slams the door closed behind them, which Potter locks with a flick of his wand. Another flick for a Silencing Charm, and then it’s just them, and darkness, and silence, and
"Yes," Draco whispers, shaky. Potter presses one warm, large palm against the obvious bulge in Draco’s trousers and gives Draco’s cock a brief squeeze. Draco’s cock twitches in response, and Potter’s quick fingers make short work of Draco’s trousers, pushing them down to his knees.
They go through four more trial potions, with Malfoy running through a standard list of questions before they go out for field tests. And maybe it was a lingering side effect of the Focus Pocus, or maybe it was eleven years of preparing Uncle Vernon's morning coffee, but Harry’s description of each of the fusion coffees seems to impress Malfoy each time. Malfoy doesn’t come right out and say it of course, but Harry can tell by the way he purses his lips, or lifts his eyebrow.
“And maybe you need bigger glasses. Anyway, as I was saying, we’re the world’s first magical fusion coffee shop. The concept of this brilliant idea was, of course, conjured up by yours truly. How, you ask? Well, let me tell you! Most potions taste awful and take too much time to make, so why not infuse a potion with something delicious that you can not only purchase everyday, but also start your morning with? Hence, Espresso Patronum! The big secret is
Malfoy sighs. “Alright fine. As you know, we’re a magical fusion coffee shop. All our drinks have a potion or elixir effect—”
It doesn’t escape his attention that this is the most civil that he and Harry have ever been with each other, and he’s vaguely surprised to find that he’s actually having a decent time. Distantly, he wonders what it would have been like if they had started out friends instead of enemies in different houses.
Malfoy sighs. “Fine, fine. Fire away.” There’s a put-upon tone to his voice, but he pulls two wooden stools out from underneath the work table and offers one to Harry.
"No speak English, you wanker!" Is the last thing that Cheng Wu says, laughing like a demented little goblin as he reaches the Port point and fishes the Portkey out of his pocket. He gives Draco a cheeky wink, and Ports away still laughing, the remnants of his laughter echoing oddly around the Port point before it fades away in the next second.
Then Potter starts going, “psspsspsspss,” which Draco can’t help but laugh at, and which, incredibly, seems to do the trick. The dragon gets up and shakes its wings out grumpily before climbing onto Potter’s palm, where Potter transfers it to his shoulder.
He finishes, and turns to set beakers aside when the Amortentia catches his eye. It seems to shine faintly with its own glow, and he brings a beaker up to eye-level to examine it more carefully. A dim memory of Slughorn lecturing them on it floats up from the dim recesses of his memory, on how the potion only creates obsession, not love.
In an instant, Potter’s gaze sharpens, and his face loses that slack, dreamy look. Almost immediately they both pull back at the same time, their gazes averted. The dragon’s looking between them, and if dragons had facial expressions Draco would have sworn that this one was smirking.
Draco glares at him in speechless fury for a long moment. “And what am I,” he finally snaps, “chopped liver? Not good enough even to be your sworn enemy? Well guess what, Potter, you can’t just brush six years of hatred under the carpet and pretend that it doesn’t exist! I won’t let you!” His voice rings out through the corridor, loud and commanding, and just a little bit shrill.
It’s close to midnight when everything’s finally over and done with, and when Cheng Wu finally Ports away from the Ministry’s official Portkey point with the last prisoner. Draco stifles a tired yawn as he walks down the quiet hallways, and enters to find an equally silent office, lit only by the soft blue of the Christmas tinsel on the wall.
“Basically,” Malfoy says disdainfully. He turns off the flames with a flick of his finger, and dissolves the wards over the cauldrons in another flick.
does. Regulation 193 of the Sale of Magical Food and Drink Regulations states that all experimental fusion food or brews are not to leave the permitted premises without the explicit authorisation of the Ministry. And since you don’t appear to have a warrant or the relevant forms, I’m afraid I can’t let you do that.”
“This is foul,” Harry says as soon as he sets the cup down. He wrinkles his nose in disgust, and Malfoy frowns.
Draco scowls, because he’s been working on this for a month with no progress, and really, who is Potter to tell him about risks when Potter’s just been undercover for the last few weeks? "Look, Potter, I really don’t–"
At the end of it, Malfoy says, “Cheers Potter, that helped immensely. I don’t suppose you’d ever consider giving up the Aurors in favour of coming to work for me, would you?” He clearly means it as a joke, because he’s laughing at the notion even as he says it.
presumptuous of you,” Malfoy says, and finally turns around. Harry’s heart clenches strangely when he sees how pale and tired Malfoy looks.
"Tell me what you want," Potter says quietly, still kneeling, still looking up at Draco with something dark and unreadable in his face. The dim wandlight casts long shadows across Potter’s cheekbones, makes them look sharper than they are. He looks almost unnaturally handsome in this light, and Draco has never wanted him more.
The only thing that Harry learns about the rotating cast of baristas is that all of them wear their work shirts with the sleeves rolled down and cuffed tight at their wrists, and that they all seem to enjoy 80s Muggle music, which baffles most of their wizarding clientele. The Slytherins don’t care, and once or twice Harry even catches one of them singing softly along with the song playing. This doesn’t quite match up with his suspicions that Malfoy is
“Yes,” Harry says in a rush, in case Malfoy changes his mind. He can’t bear this version of Malfoy, who is being unnaturally polite and who talks to him so carefully like he’s made of glass. “Of course I will.”
“Ugh, this is what I get for hiring Hufflepuffs,” Draco says, but despite his annoyance, there’s no heat behind his words. “Well, you’d better treasure this apple Potter, cause it’s the last free one you’re going to get.”
“Leave it, Potter. It should sort itself out by next week,” Malfoy says, but sits patiently as Harry runs two more variations of the healing spell. He chuckles quietly as Harry hisses in frustration when none of them take hold.
Draco has always been partial to green. Green’s the Slytherin house colour. It’s the colour of his favourite travelling cloak hung up by the door, the shade so dark and muted that it borders on black. It’s the colour of the apple that he snatches out of Harry’s hand just as Harry’s about to take a bite.
seeing him like this, wrecked and disheveled, love bites on his neck and his pants shoved down around his knees, his cock out and begging for attention.
Harry scans the shop, but it’s just Susan behind the counter. Now that he’s had a chance to take a good look around, Harry realises that Espresso Patronum is subtly decked out in the Slytherin house colours. Sure, it’s got the usual wood paneling that every hipster joint west of Shoreditch seems to have, but the booth seats are a dark, muted green that matches the trim on the walls. In what Harry can only assume passes for a Slytherin’s version of humour, the door to the shop is located at the far end of the shop. Every customer who comes in is forced to walk past an entire wall of stern-looking Portraits, who murmur amongst themselves as they ruthlessly critique the patrons’ outfits.
“Oh, that’s no problem,” Harry says at once. “Molly’s taught me a whole variety of cleaning spells.” He casts without thinking, and Malfoy’s left freshly scrubbed and blinking indignantly up at Harry.
“Honestly Draco,” Blaise says, his sharp voice cutting through the chatter filling the Great Hall, “you’re an addict. No one below the age of twenty needs three cups of coffee to start their day. That’s just wrong.”
Susan remarks on it one day, in one of the rare times when she’s behind the counter. “It’s so nice to see them making a friend. Well done, Harry.”
"Yes," Draco says, and he’s laughing again as he pulls Potter to him. "Yes, you absolute unsubtle disaster, yes."
“Malfoy, you’re a genius,” Malfoy proclaims, and looks expectantly at Harry, waving his hands in encouragement.
"I’ve been transferred to your Division," Potter says in lieu of a greeting, and Draco stops dead in his tracks and stares at Potter.
Harry doesn’t realise until he says it, but somewhere along the way, he’s lost the conviction that Malfoy’s
"Uh," Potter says, looking up at Draco, their faces barely inches apart. Draco doesn’t pay him any attention–his gaze is fixed on something beyond Potter’s shoulder. Potter turns to look and swears softly when he sees what Draco had spotted: a thin grey webbing that crawls up over the door and the walls, pulsing with magic and almost invisible in the gloom.
. He’s learnt over the course of several weeks’ observation that Malfoy is not usually a morning person, and on the few occasions that he does see Malfoy in the front of the shop, Malfoy’s always harried and half-awake as he checks on something or the other.
“What’s there to say?” she replies, and winks at him. In many ways, she’s his favourite Portrait out of all of them.
“I don’t care about Grim Graham,” Harry says impatiently, and Malfoy very unsuccessfully tries to choke back a laugh. “I’m going to need more than that. Have you been holed up in here all this while? If you were, how did you know what was going on outside? And what the hell is all this?”
Malfoy overhears this anyway, and shrugs his uninjured shoulder. Harry’s scowling now, worry thrumming through him like a live wire as he looks at Malfoy and sees how tired he looks. He doesn’t know what expression his face makes, but Malfoy’s eyebrows knit together, and he’s overly cheerful—
Things more or less go back to normal after that. Malfoy gets the necessary license for two more Restricted potions after the success of the Confidence Cafe Au Lait goes viral. The Daily Prophet writes a glowing write-up, and the Tattler Magazine proclaims him one of the
Potter doesn’t return for the rest of the day, and Fossey’s door remains firmly closed. There’s a restless, uneasy energy in the office that unsettles Draco, and he’s glad to leave it behind when the end of the day finally rolls around. He goes home to a dark house and no one waiting for him. He stands there for a long time in the empty parlour, staring into the shadows gathering in the corners, listening to the Portraits muttering sleepily to themselves, and, for the second time in a month, feels incredibly alone.
“Ow, you little bugger!” Draco exclaims, but he doesn’t drop it, and his fingers flatten out, away from the Horntail’s sharp little teeth.
“He is, yes,” Draco says, watching the dragon flop to the table in an apparent food coma, its lizard eyes half-closed in contentment. “But he always looks as if he’s on the edge of murder. It makes one distinctly uncomfortable to be alone in a room with him. I never quite know if this will be the moment my short life tragically ends with Nott plunging a knife into my back.”
They make six more arrests over the course of the day, but no one that Cheng Wu identifies as a major player. Nevertheless, it’s still a win. They spend two hours dealing with paperwork so that Cheng Wu can take the triad members back to Hong Kong under the international extradition treaty, and then another two hours working with the Aurors on the papers for the magical trace evidence. The warehouse is overflowing with magical residue, and nobody's happy about having to sort through the residue for evidence of the use of illegal curses.
And then Potter’s hands are on him again, deftly pushing him down to the floor as the cupboard door bursts open to a shower of spells, Potter casting madly the moment he gets a clear shot.
Next to him, Hermoine looks up from buttering her toast. “Is he?” She says in tones of faint surprise.
, but of course that doesn’t do anything, so he crouches down and pulls out a rolled up leather kit from the endless depths of his Auror bag. "Sirius’ old lockpicking kit," he says in explanation and gets to work. After a minute, the lock finally turns with a satisfying click.
"Might have to look into changing that. It’s a single Ministry after all, we’re all one team. And your annual budget is how much, did you say?"
“Gladly,” Draco says, smirking, and lets the dragon scramble onto his shoulder, where it’s content to stay as they resume their walk.
“What?” Harry says, and he’s too confused to be offended. “Susan said it was on the house.” He nods to Susan behind the cashier, and Susan gives him a smile and a little wave back. The coffee shop’s almost empty. It’s early, the sky still an inky grey despite the dawn, and the uncaffeinated zombies have not yet arisen to descend upon the shop for their daily dose of caffeine.
, of all people, wants him. In reply, Potter presses his growing erection against Draco’s thigh, and Draco breathes, "
The next day, Draco comes into work late. He steels himself for Potter’s silence; for Potter to ignore their usual breakfast routine, and is relieved when Potter’s seat remains empty. He opens his case files and keeps his head down, works diligently at sorting out the remaining paperwork for the dragon case; at filing the appropriate forms for the transfer of the exhibits to Hong Kong for the triad trials.
“I’ll... see you around.” Harry looks slightly uncertain as he forces the question into a statement, but Draco nods.
There’s no other word to describe the set-up that Malfoy’s got going on. A long wooden table sits in the centre of the room, filling up most of the space. On it are six cauldrons lined up side by side in a neat little row. Each has a number etched into the side, and all of them are bubbling merrily away under the protective shimmer of a ward. The cauldrons are matched by six small notebooks that lay open before them, and the air is thick with a mixture of exotic scents that Harry can’t quite identify. The rest of the room is filled with bottled ingredients, neatly labelled and carefully arranged alphabetically on shelves that span the entire length of the room. Harry turns, his eyes travelling down the shelves, and realises that Malfoy’s been watching him when their gazes meet straight on.
“Which are?” Harry asks, yanking the door open, and Malfoy blinks at him in an astonished sort of fashion. Harry prompts helpfully, “Your trade secrets, you were going on about them, and just about to spill.”
Potter smiles again, a quick flash of teeth, before his mouth envelopes Draco’s cock in hot, wet heat. Draco’s head falls back against the cupboard with a thump, his mouth open in a soundless moan as Potter deep throats him in one smooth motion, his lips sliding down the entire length of Draco’s cock, until Potter’s nose is pressed against Draco’s stomach. Potter pulls back slowly, deliberately, until Draco's cock slips out of Potter’s hot mouth with a wet plop.
Malfoy says it casually, but Harry can tell that he’s unhappy about his current state. Harry says at once, “of course. Anything you need.” He’s still damp from the shower, towel still wrapped around his waist, but he doesn’t give a second thought to his state of undress. “Let me see.”
“Draco,” he says, and is equally surprised as Draco when it comes out as a plea. Draco’s face shifts from anger to confusion, and for a wild second, Harry thinks he’ll give in. Draco’s eyes are silvery grey beneath those long lashes, and they dart wildly from Harry’s face to where he’s holding onto Draco. Still.
Fossey tells him, and Shacklebolt shakes his head. "We’ll have to look at that again, that’s just outrageous. That’s the Aurors’ yearly welfare budget," Shacklebolt mutters, and behind him, a Quick-Notes Quill starts flying across the page. Fossey gives them all a triumphant look and blows out her breath in a sigh of relief.
"It’s so nice to see everyone’s getting along with each other," Potter says pointedly, and the two of them settle into a sulky sort of truce.
“Oh, psh, it’s nothing. Here, let me see,” Malfoy leans forward to read over Harry’s shoulder, so close that Harry can feel Malfoy’s hair tickle his ear. Malfoy’s saying something that he’s not paying any attention to because Malfoy smells like a newly opened bag of freshly roasted coffee beans and smoke.
The streets of Hogsmead are full of chattering students who shoot them curious looks as they pass by, but Harry’s full attention is on him, and Draco feels his cheeks grow warm. The smell of cinnamon wafts through the air, rich and intoxicating; and the bright sunlight glints off the shop windows, soaking the streets before them in a soft glow. The afternoon stretches before them, endless and inviting; a million possibilities sparking at their fingertips.
They go back and Potter spends an inordinate amount of time considering the baked goods on offer, before following Draco’s lead and picking up a rosemary focaccia. They spend a very enjoyable fifteen minutes sitting outside at the same table as the day before as they eat and talk. Potter’s table manners are even worse this time– once he’s done draining his coffee with loud gulps, he reaches over the table and casually filches Draco’s cup. Draco stares, outraged and with his mouth full of food, as Potter brings it to his mouth and takes a long, casual swig.
At first he thinks it’s a deformed lizard, and sends a couple of nasty thoughts towards Mrs. Norris’ way about cats who spend entirely too much of their days snitching on students, and too little time catching pests. Then the dragon huffs out a little puff of smoke in its sleep, and Draco abruptly stops and stares. He stoops down until he’s eye-level with the step, and watches as the tiny dragon rolls over, its small claws flexing, and carries on sleeping.
Potter’s babbling gives way to a faint moan as Draco’s hand slides up the length of Potter’s cock until he’s thumbing the tip, stroking Potter in the same way that Potter’s stroking his hips. Everything seems to fall away, the world constricting until it’s just Draco’s hand on Potter’s cock, slowly stroking him, Potter’s cock leaking precome, and Potter’s still got his hands around Draco’s hips, his fingers digging into Draco’s hip bones as Draco picks up the pace, his hand twisting on the upstroke, Potter moaning straight into his ear.
Draco swallows, but holds Harry’s gaze, and is proud when his voice comes out steady. “No, you’re quite right, never trust the word of a Slytherin. But we respect the rules of neutral ground. I’m not going to spit on fifty years of tradition just to get back at you on one day when I have the rest of the entire year to do it.”
To his surprise, Harry actually goes along with it. And because dragons don’t understand irony, when they present the Horntail the collar, the dragon actually paws at it in a pleased sort of manner, and eagerly stretches out its neck for Harry to put it on. It makes a rumbling noise once the collar shrinks to the right size and settles around its neck, which Draco realises after a moment is the dragon version of a cat’s purr.
Draco stares at Potter and says very carefully, "Is this something that I should know about? Not that I’m complaining, you understand, I just need to know if this is going to be a regular thing with you."
“It’s from the first task of the Triwizard Tournament,” Potter says as he takes a seat on the step below Draco. “It’s supposed to be a Hungarian Horntail.”
And just like that, Harry’s annoyance evaporates like it was never there. “It’s okay. We’re good,” he says, and means it.
Beside him, Potter laughs. “Yeah, that happened to me the first time as well,” he says, chuckling. “Sorry, should’ve warned you.”
“Malfoy, your back says otherwise. It looks like you fought a Troll and lost. And if it wasn’t a big deal, you would have told me from the start.”
, not be Scourgified like a common dish towel! Ugh, this is foul. I don’t feel clean at all, and if your spell mucked up my hair, there will be hell to pay.” He runs a tentative hand through his hair, scowling.
“Be careful with that,” Malfoy warns from behind him, and Harry turns, only to find Malfoy’s face barely inches from his as he reaches for Harry. Harry’s so startled that his hand gives an involuntary jerk, splashing the Amortentia everywhere.
“Not much to do today, Potter.” Malfoy looks deranged and frenzied as he dashes around the laboratory with an armful of roses. All of the cauldrons are going at full tilt, and the air is heavy with the overwhelming scent of coffee and treacle tart and broomstick polish. “I’m going to be spending most of it finishing off the flowers for the wedding tomorrow. You can leave if you want to.”
"Took you long enough, Malfoy. What, did you get sidetracked fixing your hair?" Potter says amicably, and Draco scowls at him.
“No,” Malfoy says firmly. “Absolutely not. If it’s a bathtub that you insist on, then fine, let’s head back to mine. Unlike you, I’m absolutely sure that: one, I have a tub, and two, that it’s of an acceptable standard of cleanliness, because
Draco does. It’s a children’s game set of Quidditch, and comes with a child-safe version of Quaffles, Bludgers and the Snitch. There’s even a set of child-sized Quidditch robes, and Draco smiles as he shakes it out. It’s exactly Teddy’s size.
Then the rumours were that Malfoy was starting a zoo full of magical creatures (which Harry thought was highly unlikely but duly investigated anyway), which then morphed into Malfoy experimenting on magical creatures.
They’re face to face now, so close that he can feel Draco’s breath on his cheek every time Draco exhales. He’s surprised to find that he’s still holding onto Draco’s arm; that Draco still hasn’t pulled away. Abruptly, the anger dissipates, and Harry can feel that familiar gnaw of worry start up again in the pit of his stomach.
, and that includes our Director. We’ve got the space for one more person, but absolutely no budget to hire anyone else. You’ve seen our offices, our Division is the most underfunded in the entire
“But to be certain, you may walk me to my rooms,” Draco says, because Harry’s looking at him like he can’t understand why he’s standing there and not in his arms, and the funny feeling is back in the pit of his stomach.
"Pretty lousy news to get first thing in the morning," Potter says, setting the quill down and standing up a little bit too quickly. "Let me make it up to you. Fancy some breakfast? We could go back to the bakery."
,” Potter’s saying. “It keeps wandering off to explore, and it’s not like I’m going to keep it chained to my bedpost, am I?”
“Goddamnit Potter. Did any of that get in your mouth?” Malfoy says, setting down the beaker and grasping Harry’s chin with a thumb and a forefinger. He pulls Harry’s head down and peers into Harry’s eyes, checking his pupils. Malfoy’s too close. Harry’s brain explodes with incoherent yelling.
“Okay, first up. The Focus Pocus Double Espresso.” Malfoy looks at Harry expectantly, and Harry takes a deep breath before lifting the flask to his lips. This was what he wanted, and now that he’s gotten it, he can’t find a good reason not to drink exactly what he had asked for.
“What is this, a Ministry inspection?” Malfoy huffs. “Are you happy now?” Harry’s attention is drawn back as Malfoy throws up a glamour over the crates of coffee. “Now, if you’re quite done with having a poke around!”
. And knowing Malfoy, he’d probably been working furiously at it all week too, trying to understand where it all went wrong.
Another of his Shield charms explodes in a burst of silver sparks that fall into his hair and he has to squint against the sudden burst of light in his face; blinking spots out of his eyes. He falters, and this is it. He doesn’t have time to do anything else, and he doesn’t know where Potter’s gone.
. I’ll take your suggestion to Fossey, but I can already tell you her answer’s going to be that we simply don’t have the manpower."
Draco’s intrigued to find that he likes Potter this way, all broken and desperate for him. Potter babbles nonsense as Draco wraps around a hot hand around the base of Potter’s cock, gives it an experimental short stroke. Draco’s still hard. He palms himself through his trousers with his other hand, squeezing his cock gently through the material, but there isn’t enough space in the cupboard for him to work them both, so he turns back his attention back to Potter.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Well, why haven’t you put a magical collar on it yet? That way you’ll know where it is all the time, so you don’t have to hunt for it. Mrs. Norris will know that it’s a student’s pet and not to be harmed, and the collar will let it know to come to you when you want it. You could have gotten one at the pet store at Hogsmeade.”
“Fine!” Malfoy throws up a hand in exasperation. “I didn’t want you to worry, alright? You have better things to focus your attention on. For example, like getting a shower and then pissing off to the pub like the rest of our colleagues.”
Secretly, he thinks that Harry might be wondering the same thing too. Harry keeps looking at Draco as if he’s never quite seen Draco before: surprised and amused and slightly wary all rolled into one. But they continue talking: about Quidditch; about Draco’s conspiracy theory that Professor Trelawney’s secretly a functioning alcoholic; about whether Professor Binns realises that he’s dead or whether he still tries to use the loo, and if so, how that would go - “I
Draco rolls his eyes. "Oh come off it, you of all people know our manpower limitations! You’ve seen first hand the budget we’ve been given!"
Draco goes with him, and gets distracted by the worktable set up right next to the row of cabinets. It’s cluttered with petri dishes full of strange, unidentifiable blobs; corked test tubes filled with different coloured formulas and half-done potions; half-chopped ingredients laid out on a cutting board. They’re clearly running an illegal potion business on top of the smuggling. Draco doesn’t recognise half of what they’re brewing, although he recognises a couple of restricted and illegal ingredients carefully laid out in precise amounts on the table.
“There’s no need for that,” Malfoy says, as Harry unlocks his locker and fishes out his wand to perform a basic diagnostic spell. “I already know it’s a sprained shoulder.”
They Apparate into the grounds to see Malfoy Manor light up like a Christmas tree, lights twinkling one by one up the drive. Gravel crunches under their feet as they make the short walk up to the Manor from the Apparation point, and the heavy double doors swing open silently to reveal the parlour, brightly lit and empty. The rooms beyond that are dark, and there’s the feeling of an expectant pause as they step over the threshold, as if the whole house is holding its breath.
“Uh huh.” Harry looks at the row of cauldrons bubbling away on the table and is so certain that he’s close to uncovering
On Saturdays, Harry comes in for a quick breakfast, and once he’s done, he lets himself into the back room and taps on the lab door for Malfoy to let him in. Malfoy won’t give him access to the laboratory wards, which he assures Harry that Harry shouldn’t take personally, because no one else has access either. None of the Slytherins bat an eye at the arrangement anymore, not after he and Aiden had a yelling match about it that had nearly brought the shop down one Saturday.
, it feels like he’s constantly got coffee on his mind. He smells roasted coffee beans everywhere he goes, even when he’s deep underground in the musty basement of the Ministry packing away his files. It happens all week, and it drives him crazy to the point where he asks for a Healer to check if he’s been Cursed. The Healer unhelpfully pronounces him in the pink of health and sends him on his way.
Draco can only watch through half-lidded eyes, grunting unwillingly every time his cock hits the back of Potter’s throat. Potter looks absolutely wrecked in the dim wandlight, his hair even messier than usual with Draco’s hands carding through it, his face smeared with drool and precome. Draco watches his cock slide between Potter’s lips, gleaming wet with spit, and the absolute wanton enjoyment on Potter’s face when his cock pushes obscenely against the inside of Potter’s cheek.
Malfoy is practically hopping with glee as he scoops out generous amounts of the potion into a beaker and labels it. As Harry watches, Malfoy pours out a fraction into a cup before adding in more ingredients, mixing and stirring and whispering the incantation to a spell under his breath. After a while, he comes over with a lukewarm cup of coffee that he sets before Harry.
It goes on for more than that. Harry spends a few minutes watching Malfoy struggle with an immovable tap before he finally gives up, glaring at it like it had mortally offended him.
"Can’t get rid of you, more like," Draco snorts, but the answering smile that breaks across his face is genuine. Potter is very carefully not looking at Draco as he stuffs his hands into his pockets. "What are you doing here?"
"You’ll probably have to set a guard on the evidence storeroom," Potter says, which Draco snorts derisively at.
“Aren’t they?” Malfoy says, voice ragged, and he sounds so tired that Harry has to physically restrain himself from reaching out to Malfoy again. Malfoy’s curled into himself like a wounded animal, and Harry's heart gives a odd little twist to see him this way.
been on his mind. Besides Mother, Teddy and Aunt Andromeda were all he had left of family, and he was determined to spoil Teddy—at least, as much as Aunt Andromeda would allow him to get away with.
He hurries down the steps as Malfoy calls out, “Hang on, just give me a second,” and so Harry’s left standing in the middle of the bathroom, facing the opposite wall to give Malfoy some privacy and listening to the splash of water.
Harry’s laughing again because Malfoy is ridiculous, and there’s a small smile playing on Malfoy’s lips. He shakes his head fondly at Harry, says, “Come on,” and walks across the room to open a side door that leads to the bathroom.
“Version One,” Malfoy says brightly. A quill is already in his hand, poised over a fresh page of his notebook.
“I may? How generous of you,” Harry says, teasing, and laughs. Draco would frown, because he doesn’t see what was so funny about that, except that Harry’s already pulling at his hand.
“No, Malfoy, it’s amazing,” Harry says, when he finally finds his voice. “This is incredible.” He looks around, awed, and Malfoy relaxes a fraction. Curious, Harry reaches out a hand to touch a star, then thinks the better of it and stops, his hand hovering inches away from the wall.
“Oh, a multitude of reasons.” Draco waves a lazy hand, still watching the dragon, and pretending like he doesn’t notice how Potter’s still looking at him, his gaze hot and intense. He starts ticking them off his fingers. “My good looks, my natural charm, my impeccable fashion sense, my gorgeous hair—Nott would kill to have this shade of blond, I’ll have you know, and he’s been hankering to know how I get my hair to be this soft, and won’t believe that it’s natural. Well alright, part of it’s the leave-in conditioner too. Mother gets it delivered in from France. But don’t tell Nott that. The not-knowing is
that leaves Draco feeling clean and chilled. He moves back as far back as he can as Potter tucks his soft cock back into his boxers and zips up his pants, feeling more and more like he’s been dismissed, like a transaction that’s just been concluded.
"Found a cupboard we can try and hide in," Potter says, and Draco looks up from where he’s picked up a vial filled with a clear substance to examine the threads of faint green, silver and blue running through it.
A flush creeps up the side of Draco’s neck as he side-eyes the dragon, wondering if the rumours about them and their enchantments are true, even when they’re in miniature. Potter spots him looking at it, and after a moment’s hesitation, offers Draco the dragon on his palm. Draco extends a hand right next to Potter’s, and the dragon looks up at him intently before it stalks over onto his hand.
Blaise gives a derisive snort, but doesn't say anything else. He doesn’t have to. Draco flushes again. His huge, and frankly, rather inconvenient crush on Potter is well-known amongst the Slytherin contingent. The good thing about the Slytherins is that they protect their own, and he knows that his secret is safe with them. The bad thing about the Slytherins is that
and whatnot, while Mother would clutch her wine glass and pretend she didn’t understand what was going on.”
“Not at all,” Draco says. “The modern models are very safe. There’s a speed limiter and a height restriction, so they can’t fly as high or as fast as some of the brooms we used to have when we were young.”
“Oh,” Harry says, flushing once the full implication of what Malfoy said hits him. He looks around a bit uselessly. The locker room is as empty as it was a half hour ago, and it’s just him and Malfoy, and how would this work? Was Malfoy intending to strip off all his clothes? “Here? Now?”
was why Potter had disappeared for three weeks without a word. He doesn’t know what to make of it—why Potter would care, why Potter’s doing this. He looks up when Potter comes out of Fossey’s office, but Potter avoids his gaze; just snatches up his cloak and leaves the office without a word.
to his division, what the hell is that all about–and then pulls up short as a thought strikes him. He stares at Cheng Wu, eyes narrowed.
It happens so frequently that Harry’s sure that Malfoy’s got to be doing it on purpose, and looks up in outrage when Malfoy’s left hand brushes up against Harry’s arm again when he reaches past Harry for an empty beaker. But Malfoy’s not even looking at him—his head is bowed over his notebook as he frantically scribbles away, while his left hand gropes blindly around the table. Harry helpfully slides the beaker into Malfoy’s empty hand.
This was a bad idea. Harry doesn’t know what he was thinking, trying to talk to Draco like a normal human being when he clearly
He doesn’t really. Malfoy knows it, because he shakes his head and mutters something disparaging about Harry’s lack of respect for the fine art of potion-making under his breath before explaining, “When your base is unstable, it has the potential to turn into any number of different potions. Add an ingredient out of order or stir the potion one too many times and you could end up with a Shrinking Potion, or an Awakening Elixir, or something else entirely. That’s why potions like these are so hard to make. And that’s why I’m going to charge people an
“I could, erm. I could help you with that if you want.” Harry doesn’t know why his face heats up, and he isn’t sure whether he’s blushing, but Malfoy shakes his head.
“That’s nice,” Malfoy says, leaning back into Harry’s hands, his eyes falling shut. “I wonder if this is how cats feel? Maybe that’s why they’re always asking for scratches and tummy rubs, the pampered creatures. We spoil them too much.”
When he opens his eyes, it’s to see Potter with a vague look on his face. Draco watches as Potter’s gaze drifts down to Draco’s mouth, to where Draco’s biting on his lower lip, worrying it between his teeth. Potter’s eyes dilute, and his lips part soundlessly as he breathes in deeply. There’s the faintest whisper of Potter’s breath on his cheek, and for a second, Draco thinks Potter’s about to kiss him. Which is when the dragon suddenly turns its head and sneezes.
Draco is not one of them. He ignores Harry in favour of concentrating on what Blaise is saying about brooms and presents, but then gets distracted again when, down the hall, Ginny pokes her head out of the kitchen. She waves a flour-covered hand at Potter, and he grins and blows her a kiss in return, which makes Draco’s heart do a funny little dance to see. Ginny just laughs and ducks back in. She’s replaced by Pansy, who sticks her head around the doorframe to shout, “Harry, did you remember to bring the port that we asked for?”
Draco dives to the left, and tucks and rolls out of range. He doesn’t get a chance to see where Potter’s gone, because a well-aimed curse flies dangerously close to his left arm and rips his sleeve. He throws up a shield that shatters almost instantly when another curse hits it, which buys him just enough time to duck out of the way–dodging a second curse that had been going right for his heart. They’re outnumbered, too many faces snarling out spells all aimed in his direction, and he falls back, still casting wildly. It’s all defensive spells now, just trying to buy themselves some time.
It feels like Draco’s waking up from a dream, and maybe that’s why his voice comes out soft and sleepy; why he forgets to be unpleasant to Potter. “What is it?”
Draco walks to one of the windows as Fossey talks to the bored secretary sitting behind a desk, trying to wrangle a last minute meeting with the Minister. The enchanted window shows a bird’s-eye view of the Thames; of London spread out below. The buildings are tiny and grey as the river winds its way through the centre of the city, glistening faintly like a jewel. Draco watches the clouds drift lazily across the sky and breathes in the beauty of the city painted gold under the late afternoon light, feels the tight bands around his heart loosen a little.
It’s on Harry’s third visit to Espresso Patronum, just as he’s managed to snag himself a seat by the window and a free apple from a blushing Susan Bones from behind the counter, that he meets Draco Malfoy once again. It’s five years after the war on a bright fall morning, and he’s thinking of nothing but the missing heirloom case waiting for him when someone rudely snatches his apple out of his hand as he’s about to take a bite.
Potter shrugs. "Won’t know till we spring it," he says, but he waits for Draco to make a decision, and this– this is exactly what Weasley was talking about, Potter charging in with no plan except
“Why didn’t I notice this?” Harry says, more to himself than to Malfoy. He frowns as he tries to replay the events of that day, but he can’t recall the wards going off, and he certainly doesn’t remember Malfoy ever indicating that he was in any way injured, which, he supposes, really says a lot about his observational skills.
The room, when they find it, is old and shabby. The lights are dim, and the wallpaper’s peeling. But that’s not the biggest problem-
What he had expected was for Malfoy to get flustered and come up with all sorts of excuses as to why that would be a bad idea, but what he gets instead is Malfoy lighting up immediately and clapping his hands together in delight.
“Go ahead. You can touch it if you want,” Malfoy says, decidedly warmer now, and Harry glances back to see him smile. The star that Harry’s fingers brush against abruptly flares up, before the words ‘Sagittarius A’ appears next to it in spidery writing. As Harry watches in wonderment, the words melt away to be replaced with basic information about the constellation it belongs to, the right ascension, the declination, the mass, and distance.
Potter stops him, takes Draco’s hands in his and says, carefully, "I thought I had to wine and dine you first." There’s a long pause, and then Potter says, "Erm, that was me trying to ask you out on a date  by the way. In case that wasn’t clear."
And now here they are, meeting for the first time in five years, and Potter’s already getting cross with him. It almost feels like they haven’t left school behind.
Malfoy avoids answering by abruptly throwing back his head and draining his glass in one go. He emerges from the bottom of the glass coughing as the Firewhisky goes down, but that doesn’t deter Harry, who says, in a testing sort of way, “Malfoy, do you… is it possible that you might… feel something for me?”
"Good, good," Fossey says, smiling in satisfaction. "I know this is your case, Draco, but we couldn’t keep you in the loop on this. Robard isn’t going to like having the rug pulled out from under him. I wanted to limit the fallout to the people who can get away with it when the shit hits the fan. You, unfortunately, aren’t one of them, so I thought it was best to keep you out of it until everything was settled." She shrugs apologetically at Draco, who, mystified, just nods back. "Right then, it’s about time for me to have a long chat with Minister Shacklebolt. Good job, team, now let’s go claim our pound of flesh."
"Oh," Draco says, the first thing he’s said since Potter sat down. "If Robards is sending you off on last minute missions, he either trusts you, or you’re done something to piss him off."
Malfoy flushes and doesn’t answer immediately. He tries to cover it by taking a sip of his drink, but there are splotches of pink rising high on his cheeks. “Ah, I didn’t think you’d pick up on that.” He clears his throat several times, and Harry waits him out. Finally, Malfoy says, “Sometimes, the Manor acts in what it thinks is best for the inhabitants of the house. It is not always correct, mind you! But these magical houses tend to have a—well, not a
“H-harry,” Draco says, and his words have already begun to slur. That’s when Harry realises that it isn’t your run-of-the-mill, let’s-kill-the-Deatheater poisoning episode. This is quick-acting, whatever it is that they’ve slipped him, and it’s taking its toll on Draco
The darkness of the cupboard is jarring after the soft ocean light of the office. The cupboard is small, barely large enough to fit the two of them, and Draco finds himself pressed right up against Potter’s chest. He doesn’t know where to put his hands. He tries to cross his arms, but there’s no space for that, and his elbows keep knocking into wood when he places them by his side, so finally he presses his palms against the back of the cupboard, on either side of Potter’s face.
"Tian ah, I’m dealing with idiots," Cheng Wu says, deadpan, and turns away. He gives orders for the exhibits to be bagged and tagged while the two of them try to put themselves back together.
“Oh,” Harry says again, smiling slowly, his heart beating fast. He reaches tentatively for Malfoy, and Malfoy meets him halfway. Then Malfoy’s pulling him into a tight hug, and Harry buries his face into the crook of Malfoy’s neck and breathes in the scent of coffee and closes his eyes.
"A quickie," Draco repeats monotonously. "I don’t know what kind of man you think I am Potter, but you’re going to have to wine and dine me first."
"So it wasn’t just because of the potion?" Draco demands. His heart is hammering in his chest like a hummingbird in a bone cage.
“I do,” Malfoy says, perking up. “We used to be regular visitors when I was young, and I remember quite a bit of the layout and how the rooms look like. The house should still remember me, I think. Old memories, you know, and anyway, I’m related to a Black. Grimmauld should recognise loyalty, if nothing else.”
At this point, Draco hasn’t slept properly in four days, and so he assumes that he’s hallucinating when he opens the door to the office pantry and finds Potter there instead, looming out of the shadows of what appears to be a cupboard like some deformed gargoyle. He looks back at Potter staring out at him, light reflecting off his glasses, and says politely, "Oh, sorry, I thought this was the pantry," and closes the cupboard door on Potter’s red face. Behind the closed door, Potter makes a strange noise; half squeak, half spluttered outrage.
Potter shakes Cheng Wu’s hand, then takes Draco’s arm. "Are you alright?" he asks quietly, his eyes searching Draco’s face. Draco nods back, exhausted, and relieved.
Then he tips his head back and swallows. The coffee goes down sweet and easy, and he feels it kick in almost at once. Malfoy’s muttering, “I always knew he was prone to dramatics,” so soft that Harry shouldn’t be able to hear, but does.
Harry sees it the moment after it happens: Draco walking towards him, unsteady on his feet, his pupils blown.
"Fossey—wait, hang on." Shacklebolt rings his secretary, and after a while she walks in with a Communications officer. It’s Hannah Abbott, who does a double-take when she sees Harry Potter, and then again when she sees Draco. Then she catches sight of Cheng Wu, talking in low tones with Fossey, and walks right into a chair.
“No,” Draco says, then pauses when an epiphany strikes him. “Oh, oh, did you not heal yourself because you’re into hurting yourself? Do you
done. Potter clearly doesn’t want this, and oh Merlin, Draco’s still hard. He keeps rubbing at his wrists, trying to rub the humiliation away, and it isn’t working. Potter’s standing some distance apart, trying not to look at Draco, at their hands folded into each other.
“Potter, are you okay?” Malfoy says, alarmed, and Harry coughs and coughs until his face is red. Mercifully, the Portraits wait until Malfoy hurries away to get him a glass of water before starting up their teasing.
“That went so much better than I could have predicted,” Malfoy says when Harry rejoins him at a table right under Queen Vick’s frame. He’s frantically scratching away at his notebook, his quill moving rapidly across the page, and there are ink stains on the fingers of his right hand. Harry doesn’t know why he’s noticing these things. Then Malfoy looks up at him and smiles. Malfoy’s face is bright and warm like the sun, and something catches in Harry’s throat.
“Hand me a towel, would you?” Malfoy calls out again, and Harry has to bite back a sigh as he reaches for the white fluffy towel hanging off the rack. He would suspect that Malfoy’s doing this deliberately, except that he knows Malfoy isn’t—this is just the way Malfoy is. He turns to find Malfoy walking down the steps, naked and dripping, and quickly shoves the towel in Malfoy’s direction and turns away again.
“Oh, he did,” Draco says, as Blaise nods in affirmation. “Long lectures about making sure not to give Muggles
For a panicked second he tries to remember what Snape taught him about Legilimency and Occlumency, but those lessons were almost a decade ago and nothing comes to mind. He tries to empty his head, but it’s already filled with panicked internal screaming, and he’s pretty sure if Malfoy actually were rooting around in there, he would know all of Harry’s deepest, darkest secrets by now.
, and honestly, Draco’s amazed that Potter’s made it this far. Privately, he thinks that he needs to have a proper talk with Potter about the importance of having a proper plan once this is all over.
!" and a faint, dim light emerges from the tip of his wand. Potter drops to his knees. There’s more than enough space in the cupboard to fit Potter kneeling, and he places his wand on the floor beside him. He looks at Draco’s cock and licks his lips, deliberately dragging the tip of his tongue slowly over the top of his lip, and Draco swallows audibly, his throat clicking.
Harry’s impressed. It sounds insanely brilliant and difficult, and yet Malfoy’s not only doing it, he’s doing it
“I’ll meet you at the Apparation point in ten minutes,” Harry calls out, his face heating up even as he shakes his head at Malfoy’s cheek. Malfoy just lifts a hand in a short wave as he walks away.
"Right," Draco says a little desperately, because he’s ridiculously hard; had been since the moment Potter pushed him up against the wall, and he absolutely cannot wait for another hour. "Know any deserted corridors where stray Howlers won’t find us?"
So Harry says it again, “I do, too,” his voice gone soft as warmth blossoms across his body, laughing as Malfoy begins to smile back, bright like the sun.
This would almost be romantic, Draco muses, as he watches the leaves slowly rain down around Cheng Wu, if not for the fact that they’re knee-deep into discussing further plans for the case. He’s nodding as Cheng Wu details what he intends to do back in Hong Kong, chewing a mouthful of food contemplatively, when a shadow falls across their table. Draco looks up into the sunlight and sees the outline of a figure in shadow. He squints, and it resolves itself into Potter’s face frowning down at him.
Potter wraps one hand around Draco’s cock and strokes, and Draco can’t help but let out a soft gasp, his hands tightening around Potter’s arms. Potter swipes a thumb over the tip of Draco’s cock, and Draco shudders, gasping again. Potter does it again, and again, eliciting a faint moan from Draco, and Draco can almost
Blaise rolls his eyes. “I never agreed to those rules,” he says, but fills Draco’s cup anyway. Harry watches as Draco eyes the coffee greedily, a small smile tucked into the corner of his mouth. Draco’s always had an expressive mouth, a mouth made for sneering, for smirking, for snarling. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever noticed Draco smile before, not until now. It softens his face; makes him look gentler than he actually is. Harry can’t stop staring.
Cheng Wu takes over then, and he’s exactly as smooth as he looks. He explains the significance of the Sun Yee On, and hints delicately at the political boost that such an announcement would bring for Hong Kong’s Minister of Magic. He ends with, "I do apologise for the rush, but our side was very adamant that an announcement had to go out today. It’s been two days since the arrest, and there have already been rumours in the press. They need to get ahead of any leaks."
The bathroom is large, and done up in lots of muted greens and greys. A large pond with numerous lily pads is painted onto the walls, and a tiny frog hops off a painted lily pad and into the pond with a splash as they walk in. Harry’s gaze is immediately drawn to the tub, which takes up the length of one wall. It’s a soaking tub large enough for two people, and deep enough that he thinks he could swim in it, with steps cut into the side and leading up to the tub.
He doesn’t expect to see Potter again, so it’s something of a surprise when he comes in early the next day, only to find Potter waiting for him at his desk again. Potter’s got a blank expression on his face, twirling one of Draco’s quills idly between his fingers as he stares out at the empty office.
Fossey doesn’t quite believe it until Robards grumpily sends over the paperwork for her to sign off on. Potter’s paycheck is still coming out of the Aurors’ departmental budget, and Fossey is over the moon about that. She assigns him to Draco’s case, and Potter promptly takes over Cheng Wu’s vacant desk.
"Oh, go wash your face, Abbott, you’ve got drool on your chin," Draco tells her scornfully. But this Hannah isn’t the same timid girl he used to know in school, and she flushes a deep red before giving him an extremely dirty look and the finger, which makes Cheng Wu choke on laughter.
. He tries a basic healing spell, but it’s as Malfoy said: he’s taken spell damage, and the healing spell won’t catch. It glows soft and golden even under the harsh fluorescent lights, but it lingers over Malfoy’s skin instead of sinking in, before finally dissipating into mist.
poison your Butterbeer. You’re quite safe, Potter.” After a moment’s deliberation, he selects Bilshen’s Firewhiskey - aged for thirty-nine years, with a strong smoky flavour, and an aftertaste of figs and peat and smoke - and pours it into a new cup and hands it to Harry.
Afterwards, Potter had made it a point to step outside with Draco and his mother, standing close enough to them so that they would appear in the photos together in tomorrow morning's Prophet, but not close enough to imply they were friendly. Draco had been sick of it all, of all the political manoeuvring and politely waiting in the wings for the axe to drop, and he had approached Potter, said, "Potter," and had been vaguely surprised when his voice came out low and rusty, and shakier than he had expected. "Thank you."
“Can I?” Harry says, and when Malfoy nods, he leans forward, bridging the small gap between them. Slides one hand up Malfoy’s jaw, and gently swipes his thumb across Malfoy’s cheekbone. He fully means to pull away, but he can’t seem to stop touching Malfoy. He cups Malfoy’s cheek, and rubs his thumb gently against Malfoy’s skin until Malfoy’s breath hitches. There’s a long moment as Malfoy’s looks at him, eyes wide and stunningly clear, and oh gods, Harry can’t help himself.
“You’re hopeless,” Draco says, shaking his head as they continue on. “What would you have done without me? Just let the wound fester, and wait until you die of blood poisoning? So this means that I’ve saved your life, right ? Do you owe me your firstborn now? Because if you do, that would actually be helpful. Takes a lot of the pressure off my shoulders to produce the next Malfoy heir, you know? Although I’m not sure how Mother might take to it once she learns that the latest Malfoy came from the loins of a Potter. Though I’d say she’d hardly have cause for complaint, not after that entire debacle with Father. Oh well, I’m sure we can work it all out.”
Potter kisses like he’s desperate, like he’s starving, his mouth hot and demanding. Draco kisses back just as fiercely, like his life depends on it, until he feels Potter begin to falter, his lips a question under Draco’s, and abruptly, Draco stops. He tries to pull back but there’s just hard, unyielding metal behind him and Potter’s hands clamped around his wrists, anchoring him in place, so he sees it when it happens, when Potter finally pulls away, when Potter’s face finally clears. First, the horror, slowly creeping across Potter’s face. Then Potter abruptly loosens his grip on Draco’s wrists and steps back, shaking his head wordlessly, looking sick.
Right now, the tinsel’s cycling through shades of sea-foam green, and the light that fills the room that has that strange, shifting quality that makes it feel like they’re underwater. Draco helpfully points out, "That’s where I sit."
“Oh my god,” Harry moans, as passerbys shoot them scandalised looks, “please, for the love of Merlin, stop talking about it!”
"Are you single, and is your Division hiring?" This last one is screamed out by a very eager journalist who has jumped to her feet, and the whole room laughs.
“Hibiscus, to counterbalance the wormwood,” Malfoy says. “Very good, Potter. Are you up for a field test?”
“Oh,” Draco says, smiling. His heart is soaring. He says, “That would be nice,” his voice cracking a little around the edges.
was Pritchard and his lack of attention to details,” Malfoy says, sighing. “In many ways, he’s my least favourite Slytherin. I’m only telling you this because he fucked up your order, but if you ever say a word, I’ll deny all knowledge and claim you made it up.”
"That’s right, Potter," Draco murmurs when he finally gets his breath back, caressing Potter’s hair gently, his voice liquid like honey, "you love sucking my cock, don’t you? You suck cock like you’re made for it."
, aren’t you? Do the Twiddledees know? What am I talking about, of course they must know. Wait, is it
" Almost instantly, everything comes to a standstill, faces turning back to look as a figure hurries forward out of the darkness of the warehouse. As he steps into the dim wandlight, the image before his eyes solidifies itself into Cheng Wu’s familiar face, a streak of dirt smudged across his face, his eyes wide as he reaches Draco and immediately folds Draco up into a tight hug.
