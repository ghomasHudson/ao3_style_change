“No, I just got here,” Harry said, his head spinning. “Are you…” He couldn’t even fathom what he had just seen. Thanks to Hermione, he had come to terms with the fact that two girls or two guys being together was perfectly normal. But his ex-girlfriend, sweet Ginny, who kissed him first, had been swept away by another woman? The idea did not repulse him, but it was so bizarre he had trouble coming up with a sentence to voice. “Are you two dating?”
Part of Harry was slightly put-off. But he appreciated the scenery - and the power source that he could tap into if things went wrong.
Malfoy's figure was close to being translucent. Harry could almost see his features. "Did not. That Granger girl can produce one hell of a Stinging Jinx."
“Well done,” said the moderator, a short, mustached wizard. “You really pulled through at the end there.”
The other three young wizards were staring at him as if he had gone mad. His tangent had obviously gone right over Harry’s and Ron’s heads. Only Hermione appeared to have the faintest inkling of what Draco was talking about, but even she looked perplexed.
The two best friends remained in the kitchen, Harry awkwardly bundling up his scarf and Ron standing with his hands in his pockets.
Being a star Quidditch athlete and a relatively coordinated person, Harry rarely felt uncomfortable in his mortal skin, but this was the first time he’d ever shared that flesh with someone he truly loved. His movements seemed fluid and graceful, yet powerful and desperate, like the first real torrent of rain after a dry spell. And Draco…the curves of his body felt like pure paradise, and Harry ran his hands over every single one, not worshipping him, but
Nothing. Luna slams the lid of the last box in frustration. She skimmed everything from the past three years. Perhaps she didn’t look hard enough.
The windows of the library seemed to be doused in liquid gold as the sun disembarked. Four students sat in one corner behind a heavily stocked shelf, their books open and ignored. Typically, at this time of day, they’d be either bent studiously over their work, eager to get it finished, or outside, blowing it off completely. But for a few minutes, the essays and compact passages had been put aside.
The sound of muffled bass and drums followed them until the silent dungeons, save for the crackling of a muted, lavender-colored fire in the grate. Their robes draped over one arm, the other wrapped around Draco’s shoulders, Harry supported him all the way to his bed. Draco fell to the sheets immediately, muttered something incomprehensible, and sat up again, pulling off his shoes.
“Don’t worry about it,” Joey replied, and her dark eyes finally landed on Draco, lounging casually against the counter. “Hello, Draco.”
“More or less...To be honest, I only put up with him to humor you.” That surprised Harry a bit, but he supposed it was fair. “Also, there’s another thing that’s weird about all this - he’s a lot nicer now than he used to be, especially when you’re around. Haven’t you noticed?”
“Yes, I’m working with Kingsley Shacklebolt himself,” Percy said pompously, prodding his glasses back on, “And I’ll tell you this…” But what Percy was about to tell them fell by the wayside as he broke off abruptly at the sight of Draco Malfoy, who had become very still.
Hagrid was eerily quiet for a few moments, and all they could hear was the rustle of Athena’s feathers, the crackling fire, and the pounding of the rain. Hagrid’s face was unusually hard to read, and he regarded his tea thoughtfully.
“‘Bye, then.” Harry closed the door carefully behind him, then pressed a disbelieving hand to his forehead. Draco Malfoy had
“That was amazing,” Harry whispered as Draco sat down, and his smile sent warmth flowering in Draco’s chest.
“Dr. Patil? Here?” Luna blushes, realizing that she’s about half-dressed and buzzed out of her mind. “Isn’t there anything
Harry’s heart soared at the prospect of studying alone with Draco, though he wasn’t sure why. “Alright, then. Goodnight if I don’t see you.”
Uneasily, Joey watched houses and trees blur by, the buildings getting taller and taller with each passing minute. She resisted the urge to take out her wand, but she sensed its presence, humming almost indiscernibly with power. Twelve inches of white mahogany and a dragon heartstring core had kept Joey safe for years. But even it could not protect her from an enemy she couldn’t see. Joey glued her eyes to the window and mirror but did not glimpse the veiled figure again.
“I…” A bit flustered, Draco reached into his pocket for the parchment he’d been writing on earlier. “Yeah, I do, actually.”
“Harry…” Ginny began as she waved the first group down, “Look, I know we haven’t spoken much since…”
Harry immediately sets upon the food, using his fingers and pieces of naan to scoop - or rather, shovel - food into his mouth. Draco watches for a moment with a mixed expression of disgust and amusement, then begins to eat his lunch much more daintily, taking intermittent sips of the lassi.
Draco frowned as they entered a clearing, the same one in which he’d been attacked by Buckbeak all those years ago. “What are we…?”
“It’ll turn out fine,” Draco said softly, and he slid his arm over Harry’s shoulders, pulling him closer. “You have wonderful friends.”
Draco took it hurriedly and raised it to his lips. Harry watched in shock as he downed the entirety of the water in about three seconds. Draco stifled a belch and handed the container back to a composed Luna. “Thanks.”
Draco opened his mouth as if to say something, closed it, and tried again. “Do you still have the necklace I gave you?”
“There’s your red robes, Harry,” Ginny pronounced as the light of the spells revealed the perpetrators.
Still blushing, Luna wordlessly opens the door to the doctor’s office, and gestures for Harry to enter.
“See you in a bit.” Ron waved goodbye, and Draco returned the action, still slightly thrown that, after all this time, he was properly friends with a Weasley.
“You want this. Don’t you?” Kind, breathless, yet achingly sad. Luna can almost see Padma, leaning across the table, wanting endearments to fall from her lips, yet biting them back.
Draco’s jaw clenched. “I like children just fine. Look…” He sighed, pressing the heel of his hand to his temple. “I’m not cut out for the whole domestic, raising kids affair. I think you’d be a great father, Harry. But I…” He tutted resentfully. “I’d make a mess of it.”
“Let me see,” Draco spun Harry in a circle by his shoulders, then lifted his arms and patted his torso, rigorously examining him for any sign of damage. It was a strange sensation to have Draco’s hands all over him, but Harry managed to avoid feeling too abashed, reminding himself that the contact was for scientific purposes only. “Nothing.” Draco’s face split into a wide grin. “It worked! You’re perfectly fine, right? Nothing hurts?”
“I can walk by myself, Potter,” Draco grumbled, but he didn’t pull away. “I’m only letting you help me because you’re so cute.”
Ginny's face was tearstained, and she had put on a red turtleneck. Stepping forward, she wrapped her arms around Harry's neck, standing on her tiptoes to be level with him. Harry returned the hug, understanding then how much he had missed her warmth.
Harry woke late, about an hour before lunch. He dressed in Muggle clothes, moving through his morning routine without thinking, and it wasn’t until he entered the Slytherin common room and saw his friends’ stony faces that he remembered today’s date.
“That’s comforting,” Harry replied, falling forward deliberately, and trying to roll out of the way. Draco pinned him to the ground with a knee to his chest, hand pressing on his trachea - Harry gasped, then ceased struggling out of shock as an inky black pooled in Draco’s silver eyes.
“You think I’m stupid or something?” Harry murmured, his breath hot in Draco’s ear. “You think I can’t tell when you’re aroused? Arousing people is my
“Maybe I am, a bit,” Hagrid amended, “Never occurred ter me, boys bein’ together, but it’s not hard ter wrap me head around. I mean, look at what I had fer parents! But that’s not the interestin’ part. See,” He began, and Harry felt they were in for a bit of a ramble, “Ever since you were kids, Harry wouldn’t stop blatherin’ about you ter me, Malfoy. Ron an’ ‘Mione did it, too, but Harry was the worst. Kid was obsessed.”
George was by far the best gift-giver out of the whole company, delighting his family and friends with customized Weasley’s products. Harry especially loved the model Snitch that spun dizzyingly around his head, disappearing and reappearing whenever it pleased. Ron gave Hermione a gorgeous yet simple silver necklace with a tiny, book-shaped pendant. It was in excellent taste, and both Hermione and Ginny oohed and ahhed over it.
The two of them settled into silence, but it no longer felt thick and oppressive as it did before. For the first time since Draco met Potter eight years ago, the Slytherin felt comfortable - content, even - being alone with him. It was a strange, but not unwelcome, feeling.

Professor Dahlia had cleared the space just as she had done for the boggart, stacking the desks against the wall. But this time, there was no cabinet, only empty polished wood floor. The thirteen students shuffled in apprehensively, dropping their schoolbags by the wall. The professor herself hadn’t yet arrived, which no one considered odd; Professor Dahlia was the tardiest of all the Hogwarts teachers, but none of her students complained much about the classes being shortened by a few minutes.
He touched a pale hand to his forehead, surprised to find it slick with sweat. He looked down at himself, even though he couldn’t see, and noticed how hungry he suddenly felt.
“Just a minute…” Ginny pulled out her wand and touched it to her throat. “Sonorus. COME DOWN, PLEASE.”
Emerald curtains hung forlornly around an empty, neatly made bed. Harry stared at it as he strapped on his Quidditch gear, wondering where its occupant had gone.
And follow the voices they did, the chatter that grew louder and louder as they approached the greenhouses. The glass walls, obscured by the mist, appeared suddenly, and the trio bumped into it more than once. Feeling their way down the row of greenhouses, the students finally made it inside the glass, where the humidity was just as prevalent.
The door to the classroom suddenly opened. Professor Dahlia stopped at the threshold, surprised to see them, a half-eaten pastry clutched in her hand and a roll of parchment tucked between her arm. There was a beat of awkward silence as she looked at each of them in turn, three students inexplicably hanging about the hallway nearly an hour before class.
Harry was well aware that facing dozens of wizards on his own, unarmed, was reckless and stupid - precisely the kind of decision that Antigone had often warned him against. But Draco’s life was on the line, and Harry would be damned rather than sit and do nothing.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry muttered under his breath, and Draco looked startled at the words, but he regained his composure quickly.
“It takes a lot of power to break those,” Marisa said, awe-stricken. “I’ll have to keep my wand aimed at you all the way down, all right?”
“Thanks,” Ginny replied, “If we work hard, we just might snag the Cup. Luna!” She called suddenly, her face lighting up.
The secretary knocked once on the door. “Come in,” Commander Danjuma called, and Joey was let inside.
“Well, he’s…better. As I described in my letter.” Narcissa frowned. “I do wish you’d stop calling him Lucius. He’s your father - you should address him as such.”
“Hermione. Ron. I’d like you to meet Draco Malfoy,” Harry said, gesturing the blond forward. Malfoy shuffled a bit closer, but he looked uncomfortable. The only recognizable behavioral trait he still had was his posture; his rigid spine and proud shoulders demonstrated confidence that did not show on his face.
Something squirmed, unwelcome, in her insides. She felt it, like a parasite feeding off her fear, its maw black with it. Joey fell to the floor, curling and gasping, as helpless as she had been the day bullets had wrung fire above her head.
a man and a woman,” Draco said, anger inching into his voice. “They always intended for me to marry a rich, pretty, pureblood girl. Homosexuality, in my father’s eyes, was an unnatural abomination. He forced that idea into my head from a very young age. I hated myself, Potter,” Draco’s voice broke, but he quickly cleared his throat and pressed on. “Sometimes, I still do. And when my father found out that I was gay…”
Although the dim green light of the dungeons posed a stark difference to the warm colors of the Gryffindor common room, the fire burning cheerily in the hearth was just the same. Ron and Hermione, the latter snug in the former’s arms, sat on a loveseat as they reviewed an essay.
Draco shook his head. “He - well, we both felt that it wasn’t a good idea for him to come right away. Since Lucius would likely recognize him.”
“Do you remember how this all started?” Harry asked suddenly, and Draco glanced up as if surprised that he had more to say.
The letter reaches Draco at breakfast, carried by an unfamiliar owl with speckled brown feathers. It drops the envelope unceremoniously by his porridge and takes off again, wings flapping hurriedly.
“It’s not supposed ter be. ‘S not fair either, if you ask me. People oughta be able ter love who they want,” Hagrid’s expression hardened, and Harry wondered if he was talking about someone else. “Point is, you got ter get used to it. Toughen up, rely on your friends.”
Faraday shook her head gravely, not bothering to hold out her hands this time. “Not good. If I’d succeeded, you wouldn’t look so distressed. Whatever’s inside you is beyond my reach.”
And dark it was, within the pedestal. The four wizards crowded in, but the cramped space unexpectedly gave way to a damp, spiraling stairwell. “I hope you’ve brought different glamours,” Melocotones told them by the wandlight. “Where we’re going, people don’t take kindly to Muggles, and they’ll kill an Auror uniform on sight.”
Wake up.” Igbo, warm and familiar, rolled off both their tongues more easily than English ever would. Latifah shook Joey even harder. “We’re going to miss the sunrise.”
“Come on…” Draco was sure he’d seen the Snitch fluttering somewhere around the Ravenclaw side, and he silently willed Harry to drift that way, on the edge of his seat as he watched him fly.
Draco’s thumb brushed against Harry’s shoulder, his silver eyes glancing at him with the hint of a question. Harry reached up and squeezed his hand comfortingly. Draco nodded, almost imperceptibly.
“Found it!” Draco cried presently; they had finished cleaning the house and were rummaging in the attic. Compared to the rest of the house, it was positively cramped, dusty, and completely disorganized. Harry had anticipated running across a few Dark objects, maybe an enchanted mirror, or worse, preserved body parts. Instead, the items deemed unworthy for the modern Malfoy household were pleasingly ordinary: a gramophone, and a stack of records -
“It’s no bother, Madam Pomfrey,” Harry panted slightly as he placed Draco’s head on the pillow, “But wouldn’t it have been easier to move him with…” He was momentarily distracted as he accidentally caught a whiff of Draco’s damp hair. It smelled a bit like gardenias after a rainstorm, and Harry almost sniffed again before he realized how creepy that would be and stood up instead. “Magic?”
“Well, I was wondering if you could educate me a bit on what it means to be part of the LGBT community. What kind of discrimination do you face on a daily basis? Are there differences between the treatment of LGBT people in the Muggle and Wizarding Worlds? Or in the United Kingdom versus America? What about Hogwarts versus everywhere else?”
The dim moonlight is watered-down milk, and Draco watches for only a moment before turning away, struck speechless.
“Best if you shut it,” Harry advises his mate. Hermione is bristling like an angered porcupine, but she doesn’t flounce away like she normally does when Ron makes observations about attractive girls. Harry eyes them both, quite certain that something happened between them over the summer but he’s unwilling to bring it up.
“Maybe,” Harry said uneasily. “He said there are rumors of a spirit roaming about the village at night, but he hasn’t been here in a while. Hard to say if it’s true or not.”
“Any sign of magic and the fireless authority will snuff it out. Most wizards have left the country, but a few remain. As I do.
Harry looked from the spots of wreckage and glanced at Draco, vaguely wondering if he had been one of the Death Eaters that destroyed parts of Diagon Alley during the War. As if sensing Harry’s thoughts, Draco’s brow furrowed, and he didn’t speak for the whole walk, keeping his head resolutely forward.
Ron scoffed. "Nah, are you kidding? I'm sure he worships the Chosen One even more now." He playfully punched Harry in the arm, and the brunet laughed and shook him off. Secretly, Harry was immensely relieved that Hermione and Ron hadn't been entirely put-off by Draco's gift. Although that probably had a lot to do with the fact that Harry left out the part about their midnight rendezvous and simply told his friends that Draco had given the necklace to him before bed.
“She’s fine,” Draco muttered, seemingly to himself. “Barely grazed her leg, she’ll be fine…Potter!” He realized and immediately knelt by his side. “You…you…” Draco made a sort of strangled noise and wrapped Harry tightly in his arms.
“No,” Draco cut in before Harry could explain, “I don’t think it’s that. Although I’m not positive it’s entirely magical, either.” He rubbed his left forearm anxiously. “It might have something to do with, you know…my past experiences.”
“Yes, you are,” Harry said insistently. “We both know how much you’re risking just being with me. Hell, you know that more than I do.”
Harry moved into the light, aiming his wand at the fighter. “Stay back!” Dahlia hissed. Up close, Harry could see the eyes of the opponent, which landed on him, then widened in fear.
“This isn’t something we should interrupt,” Draco said suddenly, stopping without warning and yanking at Harry’s robes to hold him back.
“Suit yourself.” Ron brings his own to his lips, striking the lighter and cupping his hands around both. The end of the cigarette glows a brief, fiery orange before he inhales, coughing a little.
“No. No, you’re safe,” Charon told them, waving them off, but Joey could tell from Draco’s twitching hands and Harry’s moving eyes that they, like her, were still on edge. “They don’t suspect us. I’ve spent over a year buildin’ their trust. All they know is that someone’s coming.”
As the pair entered the dining hall, Harry spotted Ron and Hermione, who both looked a little pink in the face, at the Gryffindor table with Dean and Seamus. Hermione noticed them first and gave a friendly wave of acknowledgement.
“Ah.” Harry nods sagely, but he can’t pretend to remember all the football stats Ron makes a point of rattling off any time they’re together. Harry is more interested in the game itself.
Harry, Hermione, and Ron all exchanged meaningful looks. Of course, they remembered what had happened at Malfoy Manor the previous year, but this was their first time hearing about anything in particular happening between Draco and Luna.
did Harry choose that slimy, no-good Slytherin? Besides being straight as a white oak wand, Ron didn’t know Malfoy terribly well - not that he wanted to - so he couldn’t say he was attractive. His personality was awful, to say the least. True, he did become a bit nicer this year…
On Wednesday, marble-sized bits of ice pounded the castle’s windows; the sharp noise caused many teachers to cast Muffling Spells in their classrooms. The strangely inclement weather kept everyone fixedly indoors, and if the students did have to venture outside briefly, they used their heavy textbooks to shield their heads from the pelting hail.
Draco’s silver eyes shone with pride and excitement. Then, caught up in the euphoria of his success, he suddenly took Harry into his arms. “Thanks a lot for helping,” He said breathlessly.
“More.” Draco’s eyes opened in anticipation, taking in the glow of the office, a workspace they’d marked as their own. “I want you.”
“Where should we go for dessert?” Draco puts his fork down. He’s barely touched his food. Harry’s used to Draco’s sweet tooth, but right now, it seems a little annoying, like a petulant child who demands candy before dinner. Or maybe Harry is overreacting, which would make him the childish one.
“Shut up for a minute and listen,” Harry snapped, surprising himself. Joey looked affronted at his bluntness, but she schooled her expression and shut her mouth. “You don’t trust Draco anymore, do you?”
No one but the glittering, immortal heavens above, and her friend, can hear her. Outside, a pale man is pushed to his knees, torn sleeves revealing a mark of black dishonor on his left forearm. His soul, tortured and broken, lies bare for the taking. Deep within the forest, fate and death weave their unforgiving tapestry, wavering between the strength of the power-hungry and the faith of the despaired.
Still unable to meet his eyes, Harry begins, “So how…” His voice catches. He clears his throat and tries again. “How’ve you been?”
There were whispers, too, students with their heads together between the bookshelves and throwing Harry surreptitious glances when they thought he couldn’t see. Unfortunately, Ron’s optimistic prediction for boys showing interest in Harry did not come true. Harry heard predominately dissent, phrases like “that’s unnatural,” “maybe he’s just confused,” and perhaps most irritating of all, “I bet he’s secretly a poof.”
“Yes, of course. I’ll take you to see Dr. Patil right now.” Luna’s gaze is compassionate as she stands, a clipboard in hand, and gestures for Harry to follow.
“Oh, it’s no bother,” Harry replied, his footsteps soft on the carpet as he followed Draco to the door. “Feel free to drop by or call any time. Day or night.”
Pink chrysanthemums, sitting in a vase on the windowsill. Fingers tangled in sheets. The shouts of Padma’s parents over the phone, the click and giggle as Luna hung up for her, head on her shoulder.
“I’m done,” Harry sighed three hours later. In front of him, covered in scrawls and multiple crossing-outs, a long piece of parchment held his completed outline and introduction paragraphs.
Draco mumbles something unintelligible, head shifting on the ratty cushion laid on Harry’s thighs. The movement brings a jab of clarity to Harry’s mind, and he immediately, perhaps a little too roughly, shakes Draco’s shoulders.
The floor begins to tilt. The frozen Harry at the table disappears in a puff of smoke. The building trembles beneath them, and the lights flicker. Dr. Patil’s brow furrows as her chair slides to the wall. “I may be a figment of your imagination, Mr. Potter,” She says, voice wavering like radio static, “But that can’t stop me from wishing you luck.”
With a snap, the bone jolted back into place. Draco grimaced, then reached up and felt his nose, which had straightened out completely. “Thanks,” he said reluctantly.
Harry’s fingers flipped the pages, and Draco wondered what they’d feel like up his ass, working him loose while he growled filth into his ear. Maybe Harry would let Draco fuck his face, let his cock plunge over and over until his voice was hoarse. Or maybe Harry would be the one to take control, pinning, or even tying Draco to the desk, taking him over and over until Draco was begging for mercy.
“Well, more or less, but this is Malfoy we’re talking about, Harry! I only made an effort because he’s
"That didn't sound like Malfoy at all," Hermione suddenly said, and at the same time, Ron wondered, "People call us the Golden Trio?"
A pair of green eyes met their counterparts in the mirror, narrowing critically. Harry had never given much thought to his appearance, but he felt that tonight was as good a time as ever to make an effort.
Hot guilt rose in Harry’s throat. He recalled porcelain and glass shattering, curses flying across the bathroom, blood dripping onto wet tile as the sixteen-year-old knelt in pain...
The stars dominated the sky that night, the moon only a sliver as it hung above the ocean, its reflection twin wavering in the waves. The drizzle from that morning had faded in the late afternoon, the clouds now far behind them. Harry had the feeling that it wouldn’t be the worst weather they’d encounter on the voyage. There was still plenty of distance to cover, and he didn’t trust his luck one bit.
“I assure you, we are looking into it,” The witch reassured. “We are glad you are safe. I see you’ve found a haven at the finest wizard academy in Asia. Ray,” She nodded slowly to him, “It is always nice to see you.”
“No more,” Luna promises to the cold air, to the few snowflakes that sting her cheeks. Perhaps this is cruel, giving back heartbreak to those who didn’t want it. But even crueler, she thinks, is to keep away the truth.
“Draco.” Harry’s lungs filled with a panicked kind of relief. Draco didn’t look up. He ran two hands through his hair, staring at the floor. “Draco, are you all right?”
Firelight gilded nearby leaves in soft yellow as the garden gate creaked open. Voices and the clattering of plates and utensils grew louder as Joey approached, her footsteps deliberately audible on the grass. The party dining outside quieted as she approached, and several faces turned in her direction.
Three by three, each trio was announced, causing the graduates to mutter amongst themselves and crane their necks to look for their partners. Ron and the Vernier twins were partnered, to no one’s surprise and their great relief.
Finally, he punctuated his last detailed sentence with a blot of ink and looked up. The couple had gone. A few feet away, Draco closed his textbook, slipped it into his bag, and quietly walked over to Harry.
“I’ve got it,” Luna said, appearing from nowhere, and she untangled her wand from her hair and cleaned the spill with a wave.
The wizard, uniformed in a purple-and-orange striped apron, looked affronted at the question. “Of course not! They never melt until they’re in your mouth and stay animated for up to a week after buying.”
“Enough. Twenty wizards against their fifty, but most don’t have wands. Ye should be fine. Lotsa cover in battle and they’re not expecting ye. That’s not ta say there’s no guards,” Charon warned. “Expect trouble.”
“No, there isn’t,” Draco says, but Harry fumbles for the doorknob. A door is where it wasn’t before. “Oh. How the hell did you…?”
“The mask,” Dahlia repeated and took a deep breath. “I helped her bind it, but I can’t take it off myself. It can’t be taken by brute force. She needs to touch it, at least, while I perform the unbinding spell.”
Aware that his best friend wouldn’t fall for feigned sleep, Harry instead made sure he was brushing his teeth when Ron arrived. But a half-hour later, when the lights had been extinguished, and pajamas donned, Harry found it hard to sleep. He lay as the house creaked and groaned in the wind, his mind buzzing with possibilities and his heart spinning in a shower of sparks.
“It’s a shame we have to be here,” Draco murmured. He turned towards the direction of their cabin, shielding his eyes from the sun. The sound of conversation, splashing, and laughter rose from the ocean, but the upper decks were still and quiet. The Muggles had all made a beeline for their hotels and the beach when the ship landed. “Where’s Joey?”
“Filched some cheese sandwiches for later,” Ron said conversationally as he joined Harry on the weathered log that had rolled from the small copse of trees nearby.
With a burst of smoke and heat, Draco was seventeen again, coughing up soot as he stumbled down a stone hallway. Curses fired above his head, and the sound of screaming children tore through the night, ripping through his conscience.
Three years ago, Draco would have assumed she referred to his former Death Eater status. But much had changed since then, and he’d become a sort of oddity at Cambridge Auror Academy for many reasons. Dating the Chosen One had boosted their joint infamy, as they’d expected. Being the only student to pass the first-year Experimental Potions exam had made him an object of jealousy and admiration. And, of course, there was the whole mind-reading rumor which Draco hadn’t publicly addressed…
Narcissa gave him a stern look. “I don’t have much of an appetite these days,” She told him. Though she spoke hoarsely, the clipped cadence and austere pronunciation were the same as before. In the back of his mind, Draco noticed that he’d been talking more like her recently, subconsciously avoiding the chilling drawl of his father in an effort to be less like him. “This is a hospital. They wouldn’t starve me, young one.”
Harry doesn’t blame him. He remembers, how it took months for Draco to open up, and even more time to let him in. As Draco’s edges grow blurry, the memories remain sharp, the scent of pine and marijuana and car engine smoke outlining the streets of Ashfell.
“Why not now?” Harry nudges him with his shoulder, keeping the atmosphere light. “I’m just wondering -
Johansson emerged onto the landing for the fourth floor. “Rebecca Lee Crumpler ward, third door on the right. Good day, sir,” She added, in a pained tone, and disappeared down the stairs to help the next visitor.
“Holy hell, Draco,” Harry tutted, taking out his wand. Draco flinched at the sight of it. “Calm down, I’m trying to help. Hold still.” He pointed it at Draco’s face and flicked his wand sharply. “
He turned, and in seeing his profile, Harry glimpsed the thing he was worried about. If he had longer hair, slightly more turned-down nose, he’d look just like…
“Well …it’s just like I said at Diagon Alley. I like you, Malfoy - Draco. I like you a lot more than a friend.” The butterflies soared again through Harry at the sound of his own confession. “Honestly, I never thought I’d ever feel this way about you. But I do. I can’t deny it.”
The silence that followed was only a little awkward. Draco had no problem letting the time simmer away, but Harry seemed keen for discussion.
“Lost your hearing, did you?” The blond snipped, but Harry was so relieved to see his friend that he didn’t bother to think of a comeback.
“Where’s my passport?” Draco said suddenly, patting his jeans. They’d been preparing for the landing all morning, packing and preparing for Muggle customs.
“Dark forces are gathering this side of the world,” Melocotones replied. “Hecate knows why.” And he said no more after that.
Harry frowned and moved Draco’s face with his other hand to see his expression properly. The fact that Draco let him do this without protesting led Harry to believe that he couldn’t possibly be truly conscious. Draco’s silver eyes were half-closed and glazed with sleep.
Draco aimed, willing the wheel to crash into Harry’s just as it reached Dahlia and Dao. The flames spun gaily, spurting towards the sky in a brilliant flash of light. Proper Fred Weasley form would include colorful smoke and perhaps bursts of translucent butterflies, but Draco and Harry didn’t have the materials. Still, the rush of heat and light were enough to distract both Dao and Dahlia, and under cover of the dancing flames, Harry grabbed his former professor’s arm and cast a Disillusionment Charm over them. They sprinted for the trees, Draco throwing a fervent glance over his shoulder as he heard someone scream - Joey, Rabbit, or someone else, he couldn’t tell.
Marisa stopped in front of one cell. The tiny wildcat leaped from her hand onto the floor, tail swishing agitatedly. “Stand back from the door, Mrs. Malfoy. Your son is coming in,” She called firmly. She traced a complicated pattern into the metal, an enchanted password that Draco forgot as soon as he saw it, and the door slowly slid open. “You have fifteen minutes, Draco.”
A gesture of friendship, or perhaps something more, hangs before Harry like a gem. He hesitates, wondering what path taking it would place him on. He hopes the strangeness and misery of that morning has led him to something more wonderful than he can imagine.
Pain shot through Harry’s chest at the words, mostly because of how much they resonated with truth. He almost reached for Draco’s hand, but as he hesitated, Draco clasped both of them tightly in his lap.
Luna runs her fingers along the sill of car window. She can’t chase after a woman she once had her heart broken by. Any second chances will have to wait.
A satisfied smile drew itself across Professor Dahlia’s face. “You are going places, Harry Potter,” She proclaimed, walking back to her desk and settling herself down. “My greatest hope is that, as a teacher, I can send you to the right ones. Have a good rest of your day.”
Familiar voices roused Joey from a shallow, unsatisfying slumber; she groaned, feeling as if she’d been walloped about the head for hours, and kicked ruthlessly in the stomach for good measure.
“Draco?” But the boy had already fallen asleep, and Harry watched him for a while, his lips parted, chest rising and falling with slow breath.
“Well, you all have earned it,” he beamed at them, “Four thousand points. I’ll admit, a few of us teachers didn’t think you’d be able to do it.” He chuckled, twisting at his walrus-like mustache. “But I knew you had it in you! So, the grand prize…” Slughorn spread his arms, making himself even more enormous, and the students leaned in, “A ball! The last Friday of the year. Wear your best fashion, children, and be prepared for what I’ve been told will be a ‘magical night.’” His laughter boomed over the chatter that had immediately erupted. “Ah, anyway. Further details will be posted soon.”
Instead of replying, Draco reached over the side of the bed and grabbed his schoolbag. He rummaged through its contents, hand grasping something at the very bottom before resurfacing. Clutched between his fingers was a green-colored pin.
Harry broke off as Professor Pomona Sprout waved her hands for silence at the front of the greenhouse. She wore her flyway grey hair in a bun today, a pair of goggles with dark-tinted lenses perched upon it.
Outside, a particularly loud crack of thunder startled all three men and caused the hut to shake slightly. Athena woke for a moment, clicking her beak worriedly for a few seconds before tucking her head back down.
As they passed through the doors, Draco suddenly looked back again at the landscape. A syrupy twilight began to fall over the forest-green mountains, the last of the day’s gold sunlight finally breaking through the clouds and pooling where shadows did not yet deign to fall. The Slytherin’s brow furrowed, and his lips moved slightly as if to speak.
Ron gave Draco an appreciative once-over. “Huh. It’s a good thing you came along.” The redhead placed the boxes back, he and Hermione going to the barrel to scoop out the live, squirming gummy worms.
“In any case, it doesn’t matter who you two end up with. I’m sure you’ll do great things in the future.”
Justin exchanges a look with Luna, gold-rimmed glasses reflecting the lamplight. “You know what? I think we’re good here. The program’s basically running without me at this point.”
Summer shifts fill abundantly at The Raven and the Mushroom, so Draco takes his time eating a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup, nibbling with all the delicacy of a prince. Harry’s knee bounces; he twists his hands.
“It is?” Draco said skeptically, but he dragged himself to his feet and followed Harry from the living room.
Ignoring Esther’s protests, the five friends clambered through and entered the Gryffindor common room. The bright tapestries, flickering fireplace, and soft sofas scattered about usually made Harry feel right at home, but he was still fuming about the Fat Lady’s display of anti-Slytherin sentiment.
“Harry? Draco?” She called, panic swelling. She appeared to be in a hotel room, with ivory-colored curtains and dark, wooden furniture. Almost immediately, a door on the far side opened, and Harry poked his head in, hair damp and a hand over his eyes.
At seventeen, a pale hand silently drew back the curtain. Draco, half-dressed, his hair hurriedly brushed, leaned over to mutter, “Fifteen minutes, Potter.”
“Did something trigger you?” The blond said quietly, and Harry glanced at him, surprised that he knew what he was experiencing.
“Draco, we need to leave. Right now,” Harry hissed, and Draco lowered his wand, the seriousness of what he had done immediately registering within him. He nodded once, then the duo quickly moved out of the booth and headed for the door. Patrons stared as they left, their eyes burning holes into their backs.
Padma nodded at both of them - she seemed to be in a good mood, all smiles, her long hair plaited back to reveal silver-ensconced, teardrop sapphires dangling from her ears. By contrast, Gavin tapped the table impatiently, eyes narrowing as if they’d been waiting a long time.
The pair drifted to opposite sides of the room, Draco muttering incessantly in Latin while Harry siphoned dust off the floor with his wand, sweeping it in wide circles. He glanced at his boyfriend every so often, their eyes meeting, and Draco smiled as if to say,
Draco did a double-take as he noticed the fifth figure that stood, silent and brooding, at the back of the group. He was tall and lanky, like Ron, but with none of his warmth and charm. Eyes almost the color of pitch, even in the sunlight, regarded the students as if they were children he had been forced to babysit. He nodded at Draco, whose hand drifted to his trouser pocket on instinct.
“I’m sorry I’ve been acting so strange.” The headlights illuminate the letters on a route sign, and they flash silver. “Lately, I feel like something’s missing.”
“Harry, listen to me.” As Harry began to break free, Draco grabbed him, pulling him close. Though his own face was ashen, Draco held him and whispered, quickly, urgently, and slowly Harry relaxed enough to be let go. Then, both of them looked at Joey. “Are you okay?”
“Purging…” Joey frowned as Ray grabbed something else from the drawer - a wide-lipped, jade basin. “Oh, God. This is going to make me puke, isn't it?”
Between Here and the Stars is going on a brief hiatus. The story will return on March 4, 2021, with chapter 9.
“The Dark Lord, that’s what happened,” Draco said grimly. “At first, my family’s position on his side looked desirable, at least on the surface. But slowly, our reputation began to deteriorate, because…” He trailed off, looking unwilling to spare too many details. “Well, it’s not relevant. The point is, after we lost the war, no one wanted to be associated with the Malfoy name. Overall, we managed to retain a fair amount of influence, but we lost all credibility with the other pureblood families. The Parkinsons haven’t spoken to us about the betrothal ever since. Actually, they haven’t spoken to us at all, save for Pansy. She tried to keep our relationship going, but it didn’t last long. So she became resentful towards her family for not trying to maintain ties with me. Eventually, she realized that falling for me in the first place was a mistake.” Draco paused here, meeting Harry’s eyes briefly before continuing. “I suppose, in the wake of heartbreak, she’s convinced herself it’s all my fault. For not trying hard enough to truly love her.”
Dao smirked, retrieving a folded newspaper from her pocket. She tossed it onto the concrete, and a bolt of ice shot through Joey as she recognized the mark seething beneath the headline:
The four students traipsed up the hill to the castle, chatting and laughing. The sun shone, the lake sparkled, and a breeze meandered through the trees. Invisible stars had aligned, and Harry, for once, felt utterly all right with the world.
Harry can’t see too many of her features from this distance. Malfoy’s blonde hair spills to his shoulders, held back from a pale face with a lacy black headband. He walks with perfect posture, purposeful and fast, as if late for a meeting with the Queen.
“Harry.” Professor Dahlia’s voice was steadier now, and she brusquely wiped the dampness from her face. “I must ask you not to mention this to anyone.”
Draco hadn’t yet emerged out of his shell entirely, but Christmas and the following weeks had made the Slytherin considerably warmer to the others, and they to him. In fact, he did a better job of hiding his stress than Harry did; the Gryffindor talked much less than usual, his mind mulling over ways to come out to his best friends. Ought he wait a couple weeks so they could get over the shock of Ginny and Luna? Or should he do it as soon as possible to get it over with? Harry wanted to plan the conversation word-by-word so he wouldn’t mess it up - but at the same time, he felt he shouldn’t make so much fanfare over it.
But he always came back to Draco, his slim, black silhouette and silver eyes that creased at the edges with a smile. Harry found him within the crowd, half-dancing, half-talking to Henrietta.
“Can’t exactly do that if you’re hanging off Malfoy’s arm all day, can we?” Ron asked, though there was less vitriol in his voice than Harry expected.
“I wish my boyfriend weren’t so famous. Kidding,” Draco said quickly when Harry bristled. “Sore subject?”
Harry stared at him for a moment, but at the despondency in Draco’s eyes, he decided to oblige. Pressed close to him within such a small space, Harry could feel Draco’s body shaking from the aftermath of the altercation. Wordlessly, Harry reached over and clasped Draco’s hands in his own, firmly but gently. He gazed at them for a moment, pale fingers encompassed by darker ones. Then he looked up at Draco - to Harry’s profound surprise, the young man was crying.
He stopped when he saw her. A torn, red envelope laid near Dahlia’s clenched hands. Tears streamed silently down her face as she read the letter, hardly a foot long. When she noticed Harry, Dahlia gasped, moving as if to hide it, but she recognized it was too late. “Harry…” She started.
“Really? I wasn’t sure if just ‘hanging out’ was your thing.” Harry propped his arms upon the fence bordering the arena. “I’ve always reckoned you to be - you know. The fancy dinner date type.”
I make playlists for every fic I write, so here is a short one for Melancholia, including tracks from the story itself (Blue Moon, parts of Deftones' White Ponty, etc) and other story-appropriate songs from Radiohead, Frank Sinatra, and The Smiths.
“Some kind of cock-sucking expert?” Harry suggested. “You could say that.” He stepped back from the desk, unbuttoning his own shirt, tossing it to the floor. Soon he was stripped bare, and Draco felt himself getting hard all over again at the sight; toned stomach soft enough at the edges, sculpted arms, brown thighs ascending into dark curls surrounding a stiff, eight-inch dick.
“I’m your leader because of my experience in the field. I came to Cambridge from New York City, but that’s not where I’m from. I’m not
“What’s up with me? What’s up with me?” The question seems to be one that he’s asking himself, as he wanders into his bedroom with Pansy on his heels. “Great question. For Christ’s sake, Pansy…” Draco groans, pressing his hands into his face as he flops onto his bed. “Everything is wrong with me!”
“Positive,” Ron replied, tossing a green apple back and forth between his hands. “Honestly, I can’t be bothered. Schoolwork is enough for me this year. I want to keep things laid-back, you know? Speaking of which,” Ron threw the apple to Harry, who caught it out of reflex, “I’ve got a Herbology essay to write that Hermione’s gonna help me with. D’you mind if we stay here? You’ll make it for sure, anyway.”
"I'll handle this, Potter," Draco shed his robe, draped it on the chair behind him, and rolled up his sleeves. "Potions is my best subject, you know. And you don't have that tattered book of yours to help you out this year."
The buzz of cicadas and July’s setting sun brought life to the untended garden - not that it needed it. Overgrown vines of honeysuckle and jasmine ran up the wall. Rosebushes and carpets of weeds, clover, dandelions, and daffodils sprawled across gravel paths. Magnolia and yellowing pine trees loomed at the edges, their flowers and needles perfuming the air. Farther down, a small citrus orchard grew wild. The scents reminded Harry of a few weeks prior, when he, Ron, Hermione, and Draco, had been presented with a box of fragrant teas for an afternoon with the Minister.
The serpentine streets of Manila’s basement remained empty and dark for a few lucky minutes. Draco spotted a tiny gap between two buildings that closed on the other end and pulled Harry into it. They took a moment to catch their breath. Battle had not yet exploded into a cacophony in the city, but Draco heard shouts and the telltale sizzle of spells being cast. The dragon was nowhere to be found.
By Sunday, every person in Hogwarts castle knew that Harry James Potter was bisexual. Harry felt the stares burning on the back of his neck all weekend, in the hallway, in the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms, and the library. Though the center of attention was nothing new to him, Harry didn’t want to get used to it and spent most of his time outside with Ron, Hermione, and Draco, in the cold, shaded spots next to the lake where students didn’t linger.
Joey thought, with an eye-roll behind the secretary’s back for good measure - Draco’s mannerisms must have been rubbing off on her. The English Ministry of Magic, Joey had found, had a terrible track record of making meetings on time. She’d accept it as an intimidation or weakening tactic towards enemies, maybe. But the Head Auror, deliberately making a valued subordinate uncomfortable? Downright tasteless.
She watches his face for as long as she can in the rearview mirror. His lips might have moved, mouthing something, but the distance is too far to tell.
The narrow gap in the cliff had turned out to be the entrance to a broad stone passage carved by nature. Joey heard a stream rushing by, but the cave itself was nearly pitch-black, and she kept one hand on the right wall, carefully logging the mercifully few turns they came across.
“Some girls have been getting antsy ever since you came out,” Ginny continued. “They think you did it for attention since you’ve never been seen with a boy.”
The question came so suddenly that it startled Harry, who choked on his cornflakes, and he barely managed to swallow them before promptly launching into a series of sharp coughs.
I want to see them,” He said bitterly, “Especially my father. But no matter how angry I want to be at them, it’s You-Know-Who I’m angry at. Him and all his mindless followers.” Pure, unadulterated hatred for the Dark wizards who so ruthlessly beat him and his family down was displayed clearly on Draco’s face. So unnerved was Harry by the Slytherin’s expression that he focused on writing the letter and didn’t look up until he had finished.
“I’m sure you’ve been thoroughly briefed on your mission already,” said Melocotones as their footsteps echoed in the dimness, “But allow me to refresh you on the details.
Harry tilted his head, squinting, and Draco groaned inwardly. He knew that look well. “Wouldn’t you want your magic to be precise?”
“Corked vial,” Draco said, holding out his hand. Unsure whether he was addressing him directly, Harry looked around for a vial, and one materialized on the counter. But before he could take it, the container flew into Draco’s outstretched hand, and the Slytherin uncorked it as if nothing had happened.
“Draco, what happened?” Harry asked, stirring, and Draco let go of him, allowing him to sit up. Harry furrowed his brow and pressed the heel of his hand to his forehead as if trying to knead out a headache. “That was…that was your magic, right? You attacked me?”
I’ll let you all have a free period for the last bit of class,” Professor Dahlia announced as the students took their seats. But she showed a smile and a spring in her step; she was pumped for the upcoming match as well. Curiously, Dahlia was wearing both Slytherin green and Ravenclaw blue. Apparently, if she couldn’t cheer for her own house, the professor would cheer for both sides.
Harry’s muscles trembled from climbing two flights of stairs, but he was still careful not to move Draco’s fractured arm too much as he lay him down in an empty bed. The only other occupants of the wing were a bloody-nosed young boy and a disgruntled-looking girl whose hair had apparently been cursed off.
“A few representatives for us in our government decided to bring us back from the brink, to have us breed with Muggles. As fast as possible and against our will. Many thought they were building an army.
“I’m okay,” Harry said, but he sounded dishonest even to himself. “I’m just…tired. And cold.” As if on cue, the air rushed with a breeze, rustling the trees behind them and making the water ripple.
“I see,” Narcissa said regrettably. She glanced across the cell, and Draco followed her line of vision to the silent form sitting on the opposite bench. “Perhaps today, he will.”
Now able to breathe normally without feeling sick, Harry leaned over the cauldron to peer inside. Simmering within a thin, yellowish solution, small pinkish leaves floated, spinning and swimming in the heat.
“Deftones,” Draco continues, “It’s odd to see metal mixed in with all this, er…” He waves a hand at the Billie Holiday, Eartha Kitt, Dean Martin. “Older music.”
“Damn,” Harry sighed, moving his queen with his wand. Even after all these years of playing Ron, the redhead still managed to crush him every time. “Well, there you are. She’s ripe for the taking.”
Harry flipped to the correct page as Draco pored over his own book, making a note of the ingredients. With a flick of his wand, Draco caused cobalt flames to erupt beneath their iron-heavy cauldron.
Together? Harry wonders, but then Draco smiles, in his warm and self-satisfied way, and Harry figures he means togetherness in the same way that thunder accompanies lightning. Inseparable, natural.
“We had something,” Harry says, running an anxious hand through his hair. “And it all turned to shit, apparently.”
“I dunno,” Harry said, feeling a strange mixture of confusion and elation. “I guess I thought…I deceived you both, I never told you.”
“Ten seconds back in the house, and you’re already telling me what to do,” Harry said with an exaggerated sigh, but he slipped off his trainers and headed for the kitchen, ignoring Draco’s grumbling in response.
“We had nothing to do with that,” Draco cut in, “Which you might have known, had you bothered to do any magical back-tracing.”
A gust of wind, blowing stray litter down the street, shook Harry from his thoughts. They were out in the open, on solid ground now. He went through the trained motions, keeping his bag close, looking over his shoulder every once in a while, taking note of any strange eye contact. Harry wished fervently for his wand, usually settled safely in a concealed holster on his forearm. But it, along with the other supplies, bumped around somewhere in his backpack. If someone attacked with magic - Harry’s blood grew cold at the realization - they’d have no way to defend themselves.
“Potter, you seem fascinated with the outdoors,” Sprout said dryly, making Pansy giggle. “Could you tell us what potion Burrowing Roots are used in?”
The thought was preposterous. But still…everything she said made sense. He decided not to linger on it for now. “All right. Thanks for the insight, ‘Mione.” He kept his tone casual, but alarm bells were going off in his head. Even if Harry wasn’t falling for Draco, his feelings meant that he was able to feel about boys the same way he was supposed to feel about girls. And yet, he really liked girls. Girls were soft and gorgeous and forgiving.
“There’s a Hogsmeade trip tomorrow. Gavin and I were planning to go out together. Do you want to join us?”
Draco arrives a few minutes later, rosy-cheeked and out of breath. The object in his hand is so small that Harry can’t tell what it is until he opens the car door again.
“I told you already, I’m going out with some friends.” Draco strides by him, rolling up his sleeves, apparently in a hurry. Harry catches a whiff of cologne. “Ugh, where are my boots? I left them here.” Draco crosses his arms, glaring at the space next to his side of the couch.
“I did, didn’t I?” Draco smirks as he settles himself onto Harry’s lap. A pale hand reaches up, mussing his dark hair as he leans in for a kiss.
Harry tilted his mug to one side, formulating a reply. “There’s still give and take, though,” He said finally.
“There are children brutally murdering late taxpayers?” Joey said skeptically, though she’d heard of worse things.
At this, the Great Hall erupted into excitement and protests. “Five hundred thousand points?” Shouted a loud fourth-year. “She must be mad! All the houses’ points combined have never gotten that high!”
As the night wore on, the younger students began to trudge off to bed, shoes in their hands and smiles on their faces. Harry met up with more of the seventh years - Cassandra asked him to dance, as did Erin, Luna, and Ollie. Ron asked him as well, and they performed a rendition of a slow waltz as the Weird Sisters played a much faster rock song. Harry felt like a real teenager in those moments, joking and chatting with his friends, spinning in wild circles with Luna, joining Ginny’s chain of dancers, watching the others as he sipped punch with Hermione.
As the door swung open into the deserted hallway, Draco’s heart sped up at the promise of sneaking around with Harry. As much as he disliked hiding, there was something indescribably thrilling about doing something they weren’t supposed to, walking briskly down the hallway after hours, the torchlight flickering across Harry’s face, hands entwined. They found an empty classroom soon enough and slipped inside, Harry laughing and Draco shushing him as he locked the door with his wand.
The little gesture of friendship was enough to make a lump form in Draco’s throat. “Thank you,” He said sincerely, and it was then that the grate slid open.
The two Slytherins slipped out the back door of the shop into an alleyway. It was colder here in the shade, and a breeze swept behind the building, carrying the sickly-sweet smell of Honeyduke’s excess. Theodore seemed to have lost some of his unflappability; his nervous hands fidgeted, dipping into his pockets for a box of cigarettes.
Once Gavin was out of sight, Draco slumped, burying his head in his hands, his breathing barely ragged. “Draco?” Harry rubbed soothing circles on his back, painfully aware that a few stray eyes had watched the commotion at their table.
“No worries, I know it’s always something with you Aurors,” Hermione replied with a good-natured smirk. “Ron often comes home with strange injuries. Oh, but it’s been too long! How’d your exams go?”
Draco placed his hand on the back of Harry’s neck and pulled him close enough to hear him whisper. “Right now, Potter,” Draco murmured, his clipped yet treacle-sweet voice sending shivers down Harry’s spine, “You have permission to touch me anywhere.”
“Thank you,” Joey said as she took it. “Are you sure this will work? No one knows what the poison is yet.”
Harry took off his glasses and set them on the nightstand, climbing into the bright orange sheets. He lay his head down, listening to the howling of the wind outside. Sleep’s dark and firm fingers pulled him into a dreamless void.
“I’m pleased that you’re willing to try,” Draco said simply, clasping his pale hands in his lap. “But if you don’t mind, I wish to be alone right now.”
“Are you sure they will, Miss Melodrama?” Draco asked bitingly, and Harry gave him a good thwack in the arm.
If he was honest with himself, Draco almost jumped at the chance to go home. He wanted to leave the cracking noise of spells, the dampness of blood and rain, for the safety of Cambridge and St. Mungo’s. But then he caught the fierce look in Harry’s eyes, and Draco knew that the man he loved would stay behind amidst the danger and smoke. Draco couldn’t sit still at home, not if he knew he could stay and watch Harry’s back. Harry would do the same for him.
Draco pulled his eyes away from the oddly beautiful scene and set his gaze upon the Head of the Auror Office, whose name was Caroline Danjuma, according to the gold nameplate set upon the desk. Danjuma herself was already standing, and though she was at least a foot shorter than Draco, she radiated leadership. The charcoal gray Auror robes seemed even more imposing draped around her clearly muscular figure, and her dark brown eyes followed Draco sternly as he edged into the room.
Number one: Surely, every single person at Hogwarts, living or dead, knew that he and Harry were romantically involved. Their discovery would lead to some sort of consequences, but Draco tried not to think about that right now.
Malfoy Manor had grown even dustier in the months since Christmas, the must and mold making Harry wrinkle his nose. He pointed his wand rapidly at the large windows, and they all swung open, letting light stream in. All the furniture, including four couches, a few armchairs, and half a dozen ottomans -
“Yes, you kept it hidden quite well,” Hermione added as Ginny softened. “But I’m glad you two finally told us. I can’t speak for the rest of Hogwarts, but we’ve no objections to same-sex couples.”
All the breath he had seemed to be sucked out of Draco’s lungs. Behind him, he heard Narcissa say, “What’s he talking about, Draco?”
“This is how you do it: You sit down at a keyboard and you put one word after another until its done. It’s that easy, and that hard.” - Neil Gaiman
His heart rode on a swing, fluttering between the memory of a girl he once loved and this impossible boy. Then a word hit Harry like a truck, and something started to make a little bit of sense.
“It’s run by the government,” Harry said bluntly, and his partners were satisfied with this explanation.
Melocotones’s grin grew even broader as they approached. “Auror Potter and Auror Malfoy, your reputations precede you,” He said, shaking their hands enthusiastically. “My name is Henderson Melocotones. I’m very excited to work with the two of you.”
“Merlin’s sake, it’s one in the morning,” Draco exclaimed in a hushed voice. “You should sleep if you’re to retain any information.”
“It made us realize,” Hermione continued as if she hadn’t heard him, “That we need to be there for you.”
“I wasn’t exactly forced into it if that’s what you’re wondering.” Draco laced his fingers with Harry’s, their knees and shoulders touching, and rubbed his thumb soothingly on the back of his hand.
“It’s fine, I got it,” Draco muttered quickly, leaning down and grabbing the quill. Their fingers brushed, and the butterflies in Harry’s stomach started swooping. His expression must have given something away, for Draco smirked knowingly for the briefest moment before sitting up again.
In answer, warm memories bloomed between them. The bubbling steam of a potion, their dimly lit kitchen, laughing himself hoarse with Ron and Hermione, sharing tiramisu on the stairs of Malfoy Manor. These moments were special to both of them, and Harry knew they’d need them all.
Ron told himself firmly. Maybe Harry was attracted to Malfoy’s talent? Ron wouldn’t dare admit that Malfoy was smart, but he knew things about potions that went over
“You?” Joey’s wand was out in a flash, but she didn’t point it yet, anger coloring her voice. “You tried to kill me.”
Lucius’s head was bowed; he appeared to be sleeping. His pale hands and feet were bound to the wall by long chains; the more Draco looked at them, observing their length, the faster he realized why they were there.
“He doesn’t, actually,” Harry shot back. He was pacing back and forth on the carpet as they argued. Hermione was growing visibly more and more uncomfortable as they raised their voices, but a look of curiosity came over her face when Harry said that.
“Remember, it’ll only get easier and easier with practice,” Dahlia said with a grin. “It might look simple, but there’s a lot of concentration that goes into it. Take turns trying it on your partner, but don’t use any other spells for now.”
“See you later?” The bushy-haired girl said to Potter. She phrased it as a question but gripped her lanky boyfriend’s arm with enough purpose to indicate that their parting was non-negotiable.
“Not again,” She muttered to herself, wiping her mouth. She resolved to focus on the krasue’s face, which had twisted into a cartoonish mockery of human anguish.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbles, pulling himself away, though Draco only seems slightly perturbed. Maybe it’s the few sips of alcohol, their closeness, the melting-silver look in Draco’s eyes, the smoke. But for a moment, it seems like Draco’s about to kiss him, and for a moment, Harry doesn’t know if he wants him to.
With a deep breath, Draco sealed the decision. He would tell Harry his secret and hope the Chosen One wouldn’t abandon him. Like everyone else had.
As Harry and Joey crept forward, the stranger’s head twisted to see them. He pulled up the hood of his cloak.
“Yes, then,” Draco decided in Harry’s silence, and Hermione looked away. The volume of Harry’s classmates’ chatter rose in his ears as he felt himself moving towards the Charms classroom.
"Harry, my family's all sitting together," Ron informed his friend, "And there's only one open seat left-"
“Who’s grabbing who now?” Harry teased, and before Draco could stay something about this not being the time, he yelled, “Dragon!”
“Right.” Harry bobbed his head, making his glasses flash in the light. “Thank you. It shows you trust us.”
Padma is scarcely halfway through her coffee when she notices the brain map has become stationary again.
“Sweet. Okay, take a look, everyone,” Professor Dahlia pointed her wand at Owen, who raised his own weapon defensively. “Owen, I want you to Stun me. Go on, right now.”
I want to let y'all know that I have accidentally sucked myself into writing an Among Us fanfiction, along with the aforementioned Drarry fic. I meant to publish the Drarry one first in February, but that may be delayed. I'm telling you this because I may be taking a break soon! Thank you all so much for sticking with the story thus far :) (c. January 2020)
“Merlin, no. Children of said murderers. I was talking to a few people; apparently, they all stay in the homes ’round this courtyard.” Harry took a deep breath, looking up at the windows. Joey followed his gaze; light shone from a few, though she didn’t see anyone.
“Hiding…” Padma taps her lips thoughtfully. She’s seen this a few times before, the flash of regret in the subconscious, the brain rebelling against such an invasive procedure. No person has yet managed to beat the Lockhart system, and Harry won’t today.
Harry thinks the unmade pullout couch, the dishes piled in the sink, and the records strewn about their shelf bear a fair comparison to a disaster area, but he doesn’t argue. Draco and his graceful steps, the way his fingers run thoughtfully over the records, look perfectly at home.
Harry did not feel rightly equipped to deal with his friend’s pleading at the moment. The sun had barely crested the horizon, and the Burrow’s residents were only just starting to stir. But the Gryffindor blinked away the tiredness from his eyes, grasped Draco’s wrists, and pried his hands away from his clothes.
The corners of Joey’s lips rose. “Yes. We have.” Then her face fell. “We might not be done yet. That explosion was not a coincidence. The person, maybe a mercenary, sent after me obviously has a lot of resources. Considering that, and the masked witch in Cambodia…” She trailed off.
The last few minutes of lunch consisted mostly of eating food - as it ought to be - and avoiding conversation. Ron had no idea what he could possibly say to a person whom he shared mutual hatred with for seven years, so he decided to say nothing. The conversation was mostly broken by Harry, who unsuccessfully tried to keep Malfoy engaged with the others.
Suddenly, a flash of gold caught his eye. Harry’s vision narrowed in on the Snitch. None the worse for the storm, the tiny ball fluttered gaily near the ground. Harry quickly glanced back up across the field, where Draco hovered as he scanned the pitch. Harry wanted to be sneaky but didn’t think he’d get another chance to catch the Snitch, so he dipped his Nimbus forward and sped towards the ball.
Harry almost jumped up and down for joy, but he kept still. “Joey’s gone for help. I’ll get you out of there.”
Harry seemed to pick up on Draco’s discomfort, because he said, “Sorry. You-Know-Who. So…was that who you heard?”
Potter takes immediate action, Disarming Goyle, who foolishly tries to retrieve his wand. Granger shoots a Stunning Spell at Draco, who jumps behind a three-legged wardrobe. He hides from the chaos of the young dueling wizards, looking for a clear path to somehow retrieve his wand.
The crowd thinned in a darker part of the city; the streetlamps were fewer and far between, the only sources of light a blinking neon sign in a tattoo shop, the cold, faraway moonlight, and the Patronus. The air, thick with humidity and farther away from the restaurants, carried a light scent of sewage. Draco wrinkled his nose, but as Harry and Joey appeared unbothered, he made no move to cover his face. The elephant shrank slightly as it squeezed into a narrow alley, the sides adorned with garbage and a few wooden pallets.
Tears streamed silently down Harry’s cheeks as he chewed, and Draco felt a sudden spike of panic. “What’s wrong?”
Harry shrugged. “He’s just odd.” Like Luna, he supposed, though not in the same way Luna was. She had a sort of faerie quality about her. Carraway’s mind seemed to be barreling ahead of him - or was it the other way around?
For the first time, Joey let her gaze linger on Dahlia’s neck, where the skin had burned and blackened like a splash of ink. She looked over at Dao, whose eyes were closed - she still appeared to be breathing.
“Wait!” Harry blurted. “Do you know what’s going on with Dahlia? I didn’t hear of a funeral or anything.”
“Why are you stressing over it so much?” Ron asked, bemused at how anxious she seemed. “It’s not like we have to go that in-depth about it.”
Narcissa’s blue eyes twinkled for a moment. Then her face fell. “Yes. I suppose we ought to discuss something else.” She frowned. “You recall my letter. Your father and I will likely go to Azkaban.”
“I can barely see the greenhouses,” Ron remarked, squinting through the cloudy air. “Which one are we in, five?”
Harry watched the Slytherin crumple into himself the only way he knew how, crossing his legs, folding his hands, and looking away. “Do you still hate me?” Harry asked quietly.
“My parents…” As she’d told her story, Joey had shown no signs of stopping, but now she paused. Her face was kept carefully expressionless, save for her eyes, as hard and dark as coal.
“Memories, not so much. Only if they’re deliberately brought to the surface. But we can basically talk to each other without speaking, yeah.”
“Don’t be so naïve, Draco,” Lucius growls. “You’re still of use to us.” From inside his coat, he procures a tiny vial filled with clear liquid. \
All three of them looked out the back window and saw only the headlights of the car behind; an innocuous old lady slouched over the wheel.
Across the poster flew a russet-feathered eagle made out of tissue paper, its beak glinting with aluminum foil. As the trio watched, it swooped down upon a serpent made out of green bottle-glass shards, picking it up and tearing it to red pipe cleaner ribbons. Then the image rewinded, and the scene repeated itself. The rest of the sign was covered with colored stones and gravelly pebbles, providing an earthy backdrop.
The necklace around Harry’s neck grew warm as he entered the dorm, and he was entirely unsurprised to find Draco lounging on his bed, his face buried in his Potions textbook.
“Nope, I’m afraid it’ll have to hurt for the rest of the day,” Harry said solemnly. “‘Course I will, hair-gel-for-brains.”
“Fuck off, Justin.” Pansy glances at Harry, fast asleep, round glasses still on his face. “Isn’t he, like, fifty?”
He thought. The cobblestones, the midday sun, the university students and churchgoers, the cafés, the wizarding pubs, the Academy with its polished hallways and lively student body... That’s where he wanted to go.
Draco tutted and swatted his shoulder. “Don’t sound so surprised. Besides, that’s usually your job, and you’re not doing it, so someone had to. Now go,” He said, with a Malfoy jut of the chin, “I have plenty of shoes to throw.”
“Come on, up you get,” Ginny said, shaking him awake, then gently did the same to Hermione. “You’ve got seven flights of stairs to climb.”
Justin hums along to the rock song, which he actually quite enjoys. “I am not listening to you anymore. La la la, doing my job here.”
Feeling dazed and confused by Draco’s change in personality, Harry walked out of the compartment, not noticing that there was someone there until he bumped into her.
“We should have stayed friends,” the Harry on the tape laments, “I think I was just swept away by him, you know? He made me try new things, showed me new places…”
Harry understood what Draco was telling him. He felt it in his touch, fingers threading through the locks, careful with the tangles. Draco cupped his hands, pouring warm water to wash the suds out.
This chapter explores the fragility of new relationships and the steps that must be taken to strengthen them. Human connection, new friendships tripping over old ones...even as the characters grow older, they learn that the childish rivalries and bitter social fights are not childish at all, but a very real part of young adult life.
Hermione placed her bag on the floor and slid down the stone to sit. Harry followed suit, though Draco remained standing, rummaging about in his satchel for something. “Today should be easy for you,” Hermione remarked conversationally.
His voice echoed strangely in the enclosed space, but - yes, there it was! - something silver bloomed from the tip, bright and substantial. He thought he could make out wings this time, but before the Patronus took shape, the light faded.
Paper crinkles as Draco takes another bite. Strange, how a memory can be hungry. Harry watches his jaw move. He can’t see his legs, but he knows they’re crossed beneath the table. Somewhere, in the busy nook of the café, a burst of high-pitched laughter erupts. Teenagers, maybe, out for a bite after school. Harry can’t realte to their energy.
The hopelessness of their situation suddenly seized Joey, and she clenched her fists, tears stinging her eyes. They’d been so close to declaring their terribly drawn-out mission finished, to returning to safety and home.
A moment of sticky silence fell over the room. Next to Harry, he could hear Draco’s breath coming in anxious, shallow spurts.
“I’m glad Potter’s finally getting this done,” Luna says, gazing at his sleeping form sympathetically. “Poor thing was miserable every time he walked in.”
Dao replied sharply in Thai, but the meaning was apparent as she gathered crackling, ash-black energy between her fingertips. She would not back down.
“Love you, too,” Harry whispered. Exhaustion began to overtake him as well, and he stayed on the bed for a few minutes, listening once more to Draco’s breath and the night silence. “Heh, Tomorrow Draco. That was quite funny,” He remarked presently, but his boyfriend slumbered on. “Well…goodnight.”
All this and more did Harry scrape from the corners of his apartment, and fills two bulging, plastic garbage bags. As he stands in the doorway of the apartment, he looks back at the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom. Nothing appears to have changed. But Harry feels it, the emptiness that gnaws at his heart, soon to be replaced by an even wider void.
“No!” Sobs tore from Harry’s throat as Draco slumped and the spell broke. The dementors, eager for easy prey, retreated to the heart of the forest. “We need to go back,” Harry insisted, struggling to pull his arm from Joey’s iron grip, but even as he spoke, he saw silhouettes moving through the leaves, red shadows quickly making their way through the leftover smoke.
Harry furiously tamped down the butterflies fluttering in his stomach. “Address what?” He asked, but he knew exactly what.
Too late, he tried to school his expression, but Draco caught the jagged flash of panic across his lover’s face. “What?” Draco demanded, and forgetting his own apprehension, peered over the edge of the parchment.
“Uh-huh,” Draco panted, fervently hoping he wouldn’t fail today just because he didn’t run enough at Cambridge.
, had just put up its loading walkway. Harry could pass for a model, Draco thought, on the cover of some glossy and unmoving Muggle magazine. Though perhaps not with the round spectacles. The twenty-first-century youth didn’t appreciate a bookish beauty like Draco did.
“Killing someone rips one’s soul,” Draco whispered to Joey as Dao took the amulet and looked it over. Harry was shaking his head, lips pressed together. “One could take the piece and place it into an object. It’s very Dark magic. The Dark Lord himself used it. I have no idea why Dahlia would do it, of all people.”
There was no more time for pleading, for shouting. The wand drew a sharp X in the air, and the two figures fell into the dust. Joey suddenly wished she was far, far away, for they were close enough to see the blood, draining away in scarlet from their necks, seeping into the dirt.
“My family in Nigeria, and connected families around the world, have a sisterhood. We’re small but widespread, sworn to be loyal to, and protect, each other.”
“Oh, right.” Padma laughed uncomfortably. “Well…Love comes from unlikely places.” She and Gavin exchanged a knowing glance.
“Oh no, you don’t, Auror Malfoy, not by yourself,” Connors scolded. She carefully lifted Harry by one of his shoulders, and Draco followed her example on his other side. Swiftly, they began to carry Harry off the muddying battlefield, Connors leading the way to a thick tangle of trees.
“There was a girl,” Draco blurted before he could stop himself. He winced, wondering if talking about it was a good idea, but it was too late. Harry leaned forward attentively. “I think it was around November when the Snatchers found her.” The words caught in his throat like barbed wire, but he clenched his fists and pushed on. “She wasn’t the first Muggle-born that we -
Nikki ignored him, knelt by the dragon’s head, and reached for its snout, opening its mouth to reveal a row of glistening, pale-yellow teeth, each as long as Joey’s arm. Draco yelped in alarm as Nikki pried the sleeping creature’s mouth open. Kevin sidled beside her, procuring a large bottle filled with a bright green potion. As it splashed upon the dragon’s tongue, Joey exchanged a meaningful look with Draco. They had brought the same potion, but Antigone had told them it was best to inject it.
Harry kisses him, hard, uncaring of what people will think of two blokes snogging at a football game, of all places. “I will.”
“We’ll be back before you know it,” Harry told his friends. He took Draco’s hand as they followed Joey to the portal.
“She never told me.” Ron looked utterly betrayed. “Why’d she tell you and not me?” He shook his head, looking at the ground before meeting his best friend’s gaze. Harry saw that Ron’s blue eyes had filled with tears. “It’s like…I don’t even know you anymore.”
“You’re injured. Sit down,” Joey ordered, and to her surprise, she heard Harry do just that, not without a huff of impatience.
“Count yourself lucky. Most juniors, especially not pairs, don’t see this much action early on,” Antigone said with an arch look. She began to walk away, giving Harry and Joey no choice but to follow. “I know the last mission went slightly awry…”
“That sounds really cool,” Ginny said enthusiastically. “A toast, then,” She added, raising her bottle of butterbeer, “To the future and to flower gardens. To 1999.”
“Choke me,” Ginny pleads, and Harry knows her well enough to guess she’d hate it, but she’s searching for something to fill her, so he obliges. He grapples with that feeling, too, the gnawing emptiness that reaches for lust and love like a fumbling hand on a high shelf. Harry’s fingers close impersonally on her pale neck.
Draco’s expression was carefully blank as the group walked to the dining hall. Harry could only guess how he was feeling; only a year prior, Draco had been on the side of murderers, destroyers, people who had stopped at nothing to strike down the students of Hogwarts. All that was over now, but Draco would still have the memories: tearing through the castle, trusting no one, fighting a battle he’d never wanted to be a part of.
Hermione thought for a moment. She still held Ron’s hand, but now she lifted and kissed it. “You know,” She said with a smile, “I felt that way about Ron once. Around sixth year, I think. So, to answer your question, I’d call it the prelude to falling in love. You might not fall in love with them, of course, but it’s on the horizon.”
No animals made so much as a peep, the fog thinning as Harry walked deeper into the forest. He raised his wand, turning slowly in a circle and trying to slow his breathing.
Draco pressed a light kiss to his temple. A few students walking nearby stared at them obnoxiously, but one hit of the trademark Malfoy glare and they quickly looked away. Draco smirked at their reaction, and asked, “I think Ron and Hermione went to the library. Want to join them, darling?”
.” Draco reaches up to tug at the end of Harry’s red scarf. Harry sighs heavily but joins him, lying faceup on the cold, hard surface. The chill seeps into his coat, but he barely notices.
Harry knew it was in the cabin next to them, deep within his bag. He’d recalled it before, in practice, but it had been much closer and within his line of sight. It’d be better if he stalled. “Joey, what the hell are you doing? Voldemort is dead, Draco’s not-”
“Luckily, he’s here,” Harry announced and stepped from behind the tree. Before Rabbit could react, he slammed both his hands into their face as hard as he could. It wasn’t as effective as a punch, but he knew that his knuckles would not fare well against the wooden carvings, and he was right - his palms stung.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a confused glance. “Yeah,” Ron said, eyeing his best friend. “You alright, mate? You look a little clammy.”
Draco didn’t turn, even as Joey moved to stand beside him. He slouched, unmoving, staring with disbelief at the witch.
“‘What, me?’” Ron mocks, though Harry has known him long enough to take it as friendly teasing and responds in kind with a punch to the shoulder. “Yes, you, Potter, football captain. I thought you were making a bid for Head Boy?”
“Five, please,” Joey requested. “The others will be here soon.” Two of them, at least. Joey had told Draco and Harry an earlier time on purpose.
“I don’t know,” Luna said thoughtfully. “I think I’ve heard it before…from my mother, maybe? It’s blurry.” She picked up the hem of her dress and wrung it out, spattering the cobblestones with water. “Oh, dear. I should change; I don’t think waterlog-chic is appropriate for a candlelit vigil.”
Joey strained her ears, searching for stray footsteps or the sizzle of magic, but no enemy wizards had followed. Instead, there was only the steady drip of rainfall, the occasional rumble of thunder, the burbling of the stream.
“Careful, boy,” Lucius said quietly, a malicious glint in his darkening eyes. “One slip up from you, and the Ministry will toss you in here with us. You know you deserve it. You know what you did.”
“If you really want my opinion, I think we should rest. For a few hours, at least.” Draco’s brow furrowed as his gaze rested on Joey. “You don’t look well, Joey. I mean that in the best way possible.”
Draco’s head nodded slowly, then shook his head. “I…” He closed his eyes tight, pressing the heel of his hand into his forehead.
Hot water dribbles through the grounds, and Harry leans against the counter as he waits for the coffee machine to finish. “Nope. Misdelivery, maybe.”
A woman with long chestnut hair and bright black eyes gazed desperately at them. The bench must have been nearly a hundred feet away, but her soft voice carried easily when she spoke.
Hermione’s face tinged with red. “It’s not any of our business,” She said adamantly, “Really, could you have any less tact?”
Reluctant as he was to admit it, even to himself, Harry knew that his hands shook at the idea of sex because of uneasiness more than lust.
Two gentle hands landed on Harry’s and Draco’s shoulders soon enough. “Let’s go,” came Luna’s soft voice, and they followed.
Draco shrugged dejectedly. Where would he even begin? The first time he saw the Dark Lord, he glided like the worst kind of ghost into Draco’s living room, poisoning the house with his whispered words and that detestable snake. Or perhaps Draco could tell Harry about when the insignia was burned into his skin, making him cry out in pain as masked faces looked on. But what had that voice said, that fateful night, echoing years later?
When he emerged on the other side of the passage, Harry wondered why such a terrible idea had come to him in the first place. His frustration with Draco had faded, and with its absence came an instinctual fear. The Shrieking Shack was as spooky as ever, old beams creaking with every gust of the November wind. A rust-colored splatter lingered on one wall, and Harry’s knees started to shake. He could almost hear a high, cold voice, hear a snake slithering along the floor…
“What?” Pansy shrugs nonchalantly, sipping her beer. “Don’t tell me you don’t find Luna pretty when she sleeps.”
“Oh my, that was a pretty goal,” Luna sighed, flapping her blue flag above her head. “Go, Ravenclaw!”
Harry resolutely hung up, and the deafening foreignness of Ho Chi Minh City came rushing back. The moon, a shy, barely visible sliver, was nothing compared to the streetlamps and neon splashes that edged their way into the dark alley.
“I’m okay, Potter,” Draco replied, expression softening. “Besides, this will be good practice for when we’re openly dating.”
“We should get off soon,” Joey said as she sat down, and Harry perked up, nudging Draco. “Get our bearings.”
He barely raised his voice, but the words melted through the crowd’s murmur like warm rain through snow. Draco had put away his wand and remained seated, but something terrible shone in his eyes, like the gaze of a serpent poised to strike. His hands, visible on the table, twitched as if holding back the instinct to fight. Icy fear pierced through Harry when he saw and heard Draco, because he knew, without the shadow of a doubt, that the Dark Mark had risen beneath the gray fabric.
A few moments of silence ensued. Hermione and Ron, sitting across from each other, gave Luna a glance; the blonde-haired girl was watching Draco with bright, curious eyes. Draco, who was trapped between Harry and the window, pointedly avoided her gaze. Harry could tell by the tension in Draco’s shoulders that he was uncomfortable, being the outsider in a tightly-knit group.
The blow echoes off the cold marble of the dining room. Narcissa bows her head, cradling her cheek. The look of a caged animal shines in her blue eyes, which remain resolutely fixed to the floor. She doesn’t cry. She doesn’t allow herself to cry.
Professor Slughorn had strolled to his fallen student, a look of grandfatherly concern displayed on his face. “Anything I can do to help, Madam?”
Harry held the letter up slightly so Draco could read it over his shoulder, and they both scanned it carefully.
“Watch it, Potter,” Draco said warningly, but his voice seemed to be coming from Harry’s right. Suddenly, he bumped into something soft and human-shaped; Harry reached behind him to gauge his surroundings, feeling increasingly confused. “You’re grabbing my face,” Draco grumbled, and the spell fell away. Harry discovered that his back was pressed up against Draco and was so startled that he jumped away - only the clasp of Draco’s cloak seemed to have caught on the edge of Harry’s robes. Tangled and bewildered, Harry fell to the ground, the Slytherin landing unceremoniously on top of him.
“Apologies, I’m awfully tired. You can drop that Professor nonsense,” Dahlia said with a wave of her hand. “Quit this year. Anyway, anyway,” She shook her head at Harry, whose expression begged many questions, “I need your help to take down Dao.” She spoke quickly, energy charging her words, though she never moved from her slump against the tree. “Most wizards around here cast from an amulet, but her power stems from something else entirely.”
Ray shook his head. “The guards I placed must have scared them off. Maybe they have given up.” His words were stiff, almost robotic; Draco dismissed it as his way of showing anxiousness.
Luna drifted towards a large rock. With a twirl of her wand, she transfigured it into a carved stone bench. It was straightforward but lovely magic, and Harry couldn’t help but be impressed by it.
The eighth years’ last class of the day was Herbology; during Defense Against the Dark Arts, the only other class they had all together, Professor Dahlia gave them a quiz and Harry hadn’t yet had a chance to speak with Draco. That week, he barely spent any free time in the Slytherin common room, but when Harry asked if he was okay, he always responded with a resounding “yes.”
“I could freeze to death out here with you,” Harry says, breathless in the open air, the black, incomprehensible abyss, studded with jewels.
“Come on, let’s have it, then,” Hermione snapped, stepping forward, and before Pansy could even register it, snatched the magazine right out of her hand. Pansy gaped.
Despite his curiosity, Harry could not linger on that night; academic deadlines were fast approaching, and he and Ron found themselves scrabbling to turn in unfinished dissertations and look for the odd missing worksheet.
“Andromeda doesn’t need much of our help,” Draco continued. “She loves taking care of Teddy, and I think we should let her. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to be absent from his life. I want to be there for him as much as I can. I know you do, too.”
“Goodbye, Luna,” Her friends chorused. Harry noticed that Ginny’s cheeks, already pink with the December chill, had blushed a darker shade when Luna spoke to her.
“These memories would have been destroyed, had they got their hands on it,” Rabbit said, swinging the vial in a silvery circle. “You should be thanking me.”
Harry can describe Draco’s childhood nearly as well as his own. Cold marble walls, a sprawling garden, dinner parties, strict parents he fought tooth and nail so they’d allow him to go to public school, to be normal. Harry, however, would rather keep his past close to the chest.
The commander raised her hands. “Don’t look at me. I’m trusting your instincts, Aurors. This is your call to make. Joey is engaged right now, but as soon as any three of you want to leave, you can. Your mission, as Auror Malfoy pointed out, is done. You have a minute to decide if you are to help Dahlia or not.”
“I’ve been to the Quidditch pitch before, Potter,” Draco said dryly. Nevertheless, he picked up the black coat and Slytherin-striped scarf draped on the back of his chair.
“They’ll die.” Joey looked at the dragon, at the dozen or so wizards, armed with God-knows-what, in the cramped space.
“No, no…” Malfoy’s voice is a little hoarse, and he clears his throat, tugging at his blazer. “I’ve got it.” It takes the better part of a minute and a few tricky twists, but he finally untangles his possessions and straightens, cheeks flushed with embarrassment.
. Potter?” He got to his feet unsteadily, then without another moment’s hesitation, he sprinted towards his prone boyfriend.
“Do you want to be partners?” Harry asked Draco, but before the Slytherin could reply, the professor raised her voice over the excited class.
“I’m going to take that as a compliment,” Hermione laughed, squeezing his hand affectionately. Her dress, which was silky, light blue, and layered, shone with every slight movement. The thin white ribbon tied around her waist matched the one at her neck, which glittered with diamonds, as did her ears. Hermione’s hair was as thick as ever, not sleek, but she had seemed to embrace its natural waviness and opted for a full, natural style that Harry thought suited her wonderfully. “You look dashing yourself, Ron.”
“That’s not comforting,” Draco mumbled, gripping his mug so tightly that his fingers turned snow-white.
“It’ll mean a lot to me,” Harry implored. He tried giving Draco the same pleading look, but the Slytherin had deliberately turned his attention to the owl again. Harry added, “If I tell him about us…”
“No.” Padma unscrews a bottle filled with viscous liquid and puts together a syringe. “I think he’s trying to wake up.”
“Stressfully.” The Dursleys had gone on a couple of trips to Europe when Harry was a kid. The weeks to himself, babysat by Ms. Figg and her homemade summer lemonade, hadn’t been all bad. He could at least go out into the backyard to escape the smell of cats. But the frantic hours before leaving, Vernon or Dudley shouting at him to get one thing or the other, Petunia making him haul trunks into the boot - Harry didn’t remember it fondly.
- only a clumsy teenager, rendered useless by one smile from a pretty, brilliant girl. He doesn’t mind it one bit.
“Well, I’m glad you called,” Hermione said, relieved. “It’s good to know you two are safe. And is Joelle okay?”
The office is dim. Harry sees another version of himself, the day he recorded a tape for Patil. The past Harry sits as still as a statue, unaware of the people talking next to him.
[Reader’s Warning: The following scene contains multiple uncensored expletives, including unacceptable and highly offensive anti-gay slurs.]
“Yeah, but it’s not really fair,” Pansy insisted. “We all put in the work. He should have done the same.”
Ron shrugged and plopped his bag down next to a curly-haired, bright-eyed Ravenclaw. As Harry settled into the seat next to Anaya, she glowered at him and purposefully moved her books between them. The stone on Harry’s chest grew slightly warm, to his lack of surprise.
They recognized both masks from nearly four years ago. A fearsome boar, with carved tusks, stood slightly taller and more broad-shouldered than his companion. The other wizard’s mask was carved into a serene rabbit, its eyes glittering as black as midnight.
“He might not come,” Hermione said from his left. “Not everyone comes to their house’s Quidditch games.”
Half of Hogsmeade seemed to have the same idea. Raucous laughter and cheerful conversation ebbed from every packed table, which was tended to by a small fleet of the waitstaff. Madam Rosmerta, recognizing the Golden Trio right away, bustled over to them as soon as she finished pouring someone’s drink.
Sunlight sparkled for the briefest moment on the Snitch, and as the Chasers moved away, Harry dove, wind whistling in his ears as he pursued his target. The ball began to zigzag widely, near the ground, and Harry followed its path, the Nimbus beneath him twisting back and forth as the Snitch sped towards the middle.
Potter possessed infinite grace, an attribute that Narcissa had often attempted to teach Draco and various other young purebloods during pre-Hogwarts etiquette lessons. According to her, grace meant mostly patience, but perhaps a bit of mercy and compassion, as well. It was the ability to be polite under pressure, to remain smiling in a bad situation, to encourage others and the self to continue living even in the darkest of times.
“Right. But I just wanted to clear the air. I hope that there are no hard feelings between us and that we can remain friends. I miss talking to you, like normal.” She turned to look at him, and Harry met her dark eyes.
“Oh.” Harry looked a little disappointed. “Well…Actually, Draco, I was hoping you’d stay a little while. Just for the New Year fireworks, over the Thames; you can see them great from here. After all, I’m going to be your boss, now. Wouldn’t hurt to get to know each other a little better. Unless you’re too tired,” He added.
“Whatever the penalties are for even mentioning it,” Joey replied, “I’d rather not find how severe they are.”
“It’s them,” Harry said shakily, and everyone else’s face took on the same mask of fear. Only Draco looked confused, and he tapped his friend impatiently on the shoulder.
Harry feels only a sliver of that, if any, when he looks at Draco now. There’s a vague fascination, sure, a wanting for friendship, a kind ear, a different perspective. But love?
The Slytherin common room was scattered with about a dozen students, either studying or talking near the fire. Sunbeams filtered through the green water, painting the picture windows with faint stripes. Draco, Harry was unsurprised to see, had his head bent over a Herbology essay and a textbook. He sat by himself, no one in the room paying him attention. Trying to act as inconspicuous as possible, Harry sidled next to him and bent down slightly.
“Yes, Lovegood?” The voice within is stern and female, tinged with an Indian accent. Luna opens the door all the way, beckoning Harry inside.
“Athena must be out hunting,” Harry remarked, nodding to the empty perch near the open living room window as he handed Draco his tea.
Draco sighed exaggeratingly, but he pulled on his black coat and began to button it. “All right. I don’t have much to do, anyway.”
“I’m me,” Draco concluded morosely. “They’d forgive you instantly if you broke up with me, you know.”
McGonagall nodded in reply, then, sensing the seriousness of the following discussion, sat down at her desk and folded her hands.
At one point, a stranger cloaked in midnight-blue came forward and uttered a command. Both the mother and son pulled up their left sleeves. The standing wizard pressed a wand to their forearms in turn. The mother’s mark was flat, pale, and unresponsive. The son’s writhed and smoked, and he winced, but he spoke through the pain.
"It varies, actually," Professor Slughorn called to him from the safety of his desk. "But the drinker's personality does tend to change a bit."
“I have not. We can go inside, but only because I’m hungry,” Harry insisted. Draco only smirked and shook his head. The Slytherin slipped his hand out of Harry’s but walked so close to him that their shoulders nearly brushed. As they neared the dining hall, Harry stopped, an idea forming in his brain.
Passed from Hyacinthe to another, senior Healer, and a Ministry official affiliated with St. Mungo’s, Draco finally ended up in the Ministry itself, in front of the Head of Aurors office.
Joey tore off a bit of her croissant and ate it. Ducks on the river nearby began to swim over, interested; Joey ignored them.
“She’s so pretty,” Harry sighed, and both Joey and Draco looked at him, surprised at his dreamy tone. “We should help her.”
But despite it all, Draco loved Harry, and he knew it, and some part of him ached for the opportunity to see and hold him again. As long as Harry didn’t say anything stupid. Which was certainly not impossible.
Every spray of water, every rustle of fabric, reverberated like a gong in the early morning stillness. Harry dressed as quickly and as quietly as possible, listening attentively for any sign of his peers waking. For the past week, he and Draco had gone through the same routine, staying ahead of the crowd, lingering in classes when teachers were nearby, sticking in groups. Hermione had given them plenty of warning about what happened to gay couples who didn’t take precautions; Harry had no idea if students would dare try anything within Hogwarts walls, but he wasn’t about to risk it. Already, kids from all houses had been getting bolder and bolder, catcalling Draco and Harry in the hallways, sending Tripping Jinxes, and generally trying to make their lives worse.
“Sure.” Harry hastily rummaged about for a few Sickles, leaving them on the table before following Draco into the streets.
Luna shrugged. “I have no idea. All I know is that I’ve only ever had a crush on three people: Neville, you, and Ginny.”
To escape from the stifling setting of the classroom, Draco and Harry took their conversation outside, to one of Hogwarts’ many roofed walkways next to the dining hall. Snow had begun to fall faintly, dusting the branches of a nearby tree with powder. Harry shook slightly in the cold, having forgotten his extra-thick cloak, but Draco didn’t seem bothered at all by the weather.
“No.” Luna takes a step back, boot landing on her own footprint. “What does that mean?” She asks again.
Harry hesitated to touch it, remembering that the last necklace he had known Malfoy to give had been cursed.
“All right, all right, I’m going. ‘Night, Malfoy.” Grinning, Harry shut the door behind him and made a beeline for his and Ron’s shared bedroom just as he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
Draco’s brow furrows. “I feel like we’re not talking about the same thing,” He says, drumming his nails on the table.
Draco took a moment to answer, breathing in the warm night air, gazing up at Harry’s smirking face, haloed with a faraway crescent moon. His stomach had settled, and the water had helped the pounding in his head fade somewhat. “I think so.” He lifted himself up on his arms, the lights of Ottery St. Catchpole glittering beneath them.
“They’re from Wiltshire. Her uncle used to be proper good at football. Nearly made it to England national, but he shattered his knee.”
Ron and Hermione arrived, as Harry had predicted, ten minutes before the time Joey had given them. Harry leaped to his feet to greet his friends, Ron clapping him on the back and prying off Hermione’s embrace before she pounced upon Draco with the same overwhelming protectiveness.
“Have you?” Harry mutters bitterly. He catches his own reflection in a mirror hanging nearby, sagging shoulders, drooping eyes. Lonely, indeed.
“Did I know him?” Harry echoed. He remembered seven years ago, unsure of himself in the vastness of King’s Cross, holding a nonsensical ticket and laden with possessions he hardly knew how to use. He’d heard Molly Weasley’s voice first, cutting through the faceless crowd like a lighthouse beam of comfort, and seen the rest of the family, dressed in threadbare robes and holding beaten trunks. All six relatives seemed happy and carefree around each other, none of the children ever ducking for a scolding blow like Harry had at the Dursley’s. They glowed with warmth and familiarity, Fred among them, teasing his siblings and his mother, reassuring his sister along with George. Unexpected tears pricked Harry’s eyes as he realized, not for the first time, that the happy little unit would never again be whole. “Yes. He was a good friend of mine.”
Draco only smiled wryly in response as they parted ways. A fragment of regret rose through Harry’s chest as he watched him go - he was happy, of course, to hang out with his best mate, but a part of him couldn’t help but imagine a reality where Draco could openly spare a kiss of farewell just as Hermione had.
Footsteps echoed loudly through the third-floor corridor as Harry dashed to the boys’ bathroom. Slowing down at the entrance, Harry pulled out his wand, unsure if Draco would attack him or not. The sound of muffled crying and running water made Harry hesitate, but curiosity and sympathy pushed him forward.
“Weasley?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Not well. My lot didn’t really get along with his. Why do you ask?”
Owen explained Oliver’s and Erin’s story game. Ron and Hermione nodded understandingly, though Harry could tell from their faces that they found the game a bit childish.
The couple graciously accepted the compliment and Antigone moved on to speak with the rest of her graduates. Draco’s silver eyes glittered as they swept across the few young Aurors at their own table, and Harry knew he, too, was wondering about their fellow partner.
“Grab them firmly and don’t let them bite you,” Harry said, raising his voice over the gnome’s squeals. He flipped the creature over, grasped its feet, and began to swing it in a circle, faster and faster. With a slight grunt, the young wizard flung the gnome over the low, stone wall. “Not bad,” Harry shielded his eyes from the sunlight as he watched the creature fly through the air and land a good fifty feet away. “Go on, give it a try.”
As you may have noticed, the chapters thus far have all been in a 3rd-person POV that focuses mainly on Harry, as the canon books do. However, this chapter focuses more on Draco's POV, and is the first of a few chapters that may do so throughout the series.
“Who knows,” Draco muttered. The Following’s movements were so unpredictable that at this point, he wouldn’t be surprised if their masks waited on the other side of the Cambridge portal.
Harry allowed himself to relax once they were seated, two mugs of butterbeer placed before them by a harried waitress. He spotted a few familiar faces in the surrounding multitude, but no one he knew well enough to spare him a second glance. According to Ron, he and Hermione would be off somewhere else - though when Harry asked him where exactly, Ron’s ears had turned red, and he mumbled something about Transfiguration homework.
Draco thought that his childhood years spent attending countless Malfoy Manor banquets, parties, and gatherings would prepare him for a nearly five-hour-long reception.
Harry flicked his wrist, and his wand slid into his hand. Joey didn’t follow suit just yet - she looked back and forth down the unpaved road, stepping into the shade of a roof behind them when she saw two silhouettes about a hundred feet away. She could not see their faces.
“I helped a bit, but Ginny did the wandwork,” Luna said, smiling at her friend. “She’s wonderful at artsy charms like this.”
Rose petals, powdered unicorn horn, jackalope spit, manticore blood, dragonfly wings. The closest replica of true love turned sluggishly in the pot, bright purple, and smelling of burnt toast and rotten oranges. Vigilant hands chopped ingredients, stirred the sludge, and lifted robe sleeves to noses to hide the stench.
. To sabotage criminal activity, steal live cargo, and release it into the right hands. Harry was almost nostalgic for the simple search-and-destroy Horcrux quest - almost.
“We need to find Rizal’s statue,” Joey said, recalling Commander Antigone’s words. “Another Auror will meet us there.”
I’m not all right, didn’t you hear them? Didn’t you hear them, Potter?” He looked up, silver eyes hollowed with shame.
“No.” Draco readjusted his school bag and strode away as quickly as they had stopped, leaving the shorter student hurrying to walk beside him. The Slytherin wore his usual emotionless visage, but after eight years of knowing him Harry was beginning to figure out that that expression hid busily stirring thoughts. And then it dawned on him, brightly and suddenly, why Draco had been making such a big deal about Sunday.
“Hm?” Draco blinks to bleary consciousness. Then, as if electrocuted, he sits up, eyes wide. “Oh, hell.”
“Perhaps she did, once,” Draco said dismissively. “Now she’s just taking out all her anger on me and the rest of my family. She probably can’t wait to see the day I’m shut in Azkaban. Hell, that day might come in less than a year.” Draco looked up from his twisting hands and gave Harry a weary, hopeless look. The wind began to pick up for a moment, sending the trees shivering, their twigs rustling dryly in the wind.
A shadow began to saunter, half-hidden behind a dust cloud. Fear pierced deep into Draco’s heart, uninvited. He exchanged a glance with Joey - she’d seen it, too.
“The poppy was jealous of the beautiful rose and hated it. But…” Gavin paused, thinking. “The rose had never known hate, so she chose to be the poppy’s friend.”
“Oh, you,” Draco sighed. He waved his wand again, muttering under his breath, and the painting flew to its space in the wall. “I wonder if we can find flowers,” He said, mostly to himself, “Put them on the mantle.”
The Chosen One fastened the necklace; the stone felt chilly against his neck. Harry looked at Draco, who was watching him intently. “It’s not warm.”
“I’m sorry, Draco.” Harry’s fingers were still, nothing but warmth emanating from them. “If you want me to leave or stay, talk or listen, it doesn’t matter. I’ll do it. I want to help you on your terms.”
But I do know I want to marry Hermione Granger.” He smiled broadly at the admittance. “She’s the one.”
“You seriously need to take a shower before you go anywhere,” Draco said critically, though he didn’t move away. “Don’t wash your hair, though.”
It was with great reluctance that Draco placed his wand in his bag, firmly out of reach. He’d gone without it before, but this time felt worse. Four days journey, one day to meet Faraday, and Merlin knows what would befall them next. He hated not having any protection.
When he was younger, about twelve or thirteen, Draco used to make lists. He’d organize his assignments, plots of revenge, snappy insults for Potter, people whom he liked, people whom he wouldn’t mind seeing dead - or at least seriously maimed. Crabbe and Goyle used to make fun of him for being so methodical. Draco let them if only to entertain himself.
Joey hadn’t known Draco for very long, but she figured even a complete stranger could sense how the air around him turned to ice. He stood, walking a wide circle around Dahlia’s body to lay a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “This is something we can discuss back home, Commander.”
Ginny gave him a swift, friendly kiss on the cheek, then bounded away, saying, “I’ve got to find Luna!”
High school, soccer field, autumn dew. Long legs and lip gloss and a voice that commanded attention. Later there was anger, frustration, any slivers of friendship snatched away in lieu of an inner struggle that Harry learned about years after.
He sat down in the grass and watched as a figure, robed in flowing, forest green, met two others by a worn wooden bench.
Anyways, a big thank you to the readers that have made it this far! You guys, and of course, my lovely and anonymous beta reader, are the reason I can keep putting out fanfiction. As I become an adult, and my life gets more hectic, it’s going to be harder to make fan content, but the Harry Potter fandom will always mean a lot to me.
“He still hates me,” Draco remarked resentfully as he poured hot water. “You’d think he’d gotten over one little spat from ages ago.”
Joey thought an established crime ring would do a slightly better job hiding a four-ton, brightly colored dragon. Yet the beast, the size of a small bus, slumbered out in the middle of a courtyard lined with blue and green paper lanterns. Its scales, whitish-silver, reflected the colors, appearing to be bathed in ocean-filtered sunlight. The dragon’s wings were folded neatly against its massive body, its slim, horned head resting on its clawed paws.
Joey felt for the chain of the potion and lifted it out of her shirt. “This isn’t registered with any Apparation offices,” She said softly. “If it works, this could take me all the way to Cambridge.”
The door to Ginny's room was partially covered with a Holyhead Harpies poster, and Harry paused to watch a Chaser score a goal before knocking. When he was met with silence, Harry pressed his ear to the door and rapped again.
“We will,” Harry promise, and the break in his voice caused tears to gather, unwanted, in Draco’s eyes. “We’ll show mercy, Dahlia.”
“They’re not aiming to kill,” Hermione whispered. The colors of the spells were mostly red and blue, and the absence of green showed that she was correct. “How’d they get past the defenses?”
“Have you got a player or not?” Draco presses irritably. “Cover your ears, if you like. I want to hear what’s on it.”
The ship, sleek, white, and relatively small, looked speedy, but it would take its time weaving through the Pacific, giving its Muggle passengers all the time on the wide-open sea they needed. Draco dropped their bags, along with the extra supplies Henderson had lent them, in his and Harry’s tiny room. He then climbed to the top deck, wringing his hands nervously over the railing and watching for the vessel’s departure.
“Anyone hungry?” Hermione offered. She and Ron half-watched them from a plaid picnic blanket. She had been reading a book while he spun pebbles with his wand. Hermione rummaged around in her bag for cloth-wrapped sandwiches and a thermos full of what Draco hoped was tea.
Harry raised an eyebrow at that, but he didn’t wish to start a row. On a whim, he said, “Fancy taking a walk through Hogsmeade?”
“I told you this was a bad idea, Potter,” Malfoy muttered. His close proximity to Harry, and the way their faces instinctively leaned towards each other as they talked, somehow made Ron feel angry. Who did this upstart traitor think he was, trying to get all buddy-buddy with
Cold, indifferent. The aloofness that Pansy had found herself so attracted to is now directed at her. “Fine.” That’s just fine.
Day by day, Harry’s perception of Draco changes. He’s always been annoyingly clever since school, but Harry finds himself appreciating,
“That Ron or Hermione with yeh?” Hagrid asked, and Draco removed the cloak’s hood. His silver eyes were wide and anxious, reflecting the flickering firelight. Hagrid frowned as he recognized the former Death Eater. “An’ what’ve we got here? Malfoy spawn…Come ter drive me out, is that it? On’y been here two days.”
Near the portal, the uniformed wizard loudly cleared his throat. Joey looked at each of her partners in turn, her gaze conveying what they were all thinking:
“The Weasleys are kind people, they’ll warm up to you soon enough,” Harry said reassuringly. “I promise.”
The disappointment in his voice must have been obvious, because Hermione briefly rested a hand on his shoulder. Draco tensed at the unfamiliar touch, but it wasn’t malicious, rather a gesture of reassurance. “It’s not because of you, I promise. I know myself; I’d definitely scold Harry when he got out, and he probably wouldn’t appreciate that much.”
“One, two, three…” Ginny lowered her wand with a flourish and blew her whistle loudly. The Quaffle dropped, caught immediately by Willow Amara. The Bludgers began their paths of destruction. Harry and Fiona rose above the chaos, both scanning the air for a glint of gold.
“Not exactly. I don’t fancy, er, a particular person. Although I do find them attractive. Objectively. But lately, I dunno. It just feels right being with them. It’s similar to how I feel about being with you both, but not quite. It’s hard to explain,” Harry sighed. He felt like he was grasping at straws.
“Yeah, Draco’s been through hell and back,” Harry admitted, and Hermione inhaled sharply at his language, glancing at Professor Dahlia. The teacher’s face remained unreadable as she let him continue. “But so have the rest of us. I dare you to tell me that thinking of happy memories was a walk in the park for all of you,” He challenged, looking around at his peers. “I dare you all to tell me that last year wasn’t hard. But you can’t, can you? Not honestly. Because we’ve all been through hell and back, one way or another, and comparing how much we’ve suffered isn’t going to help a damn bit. So, don’t sit there and bleat that Draco’s not strong enough to cast a Patronus,” Harry said roughly, directing his words at Pansy, “Because that would be an insult to every bloody person who’s lived through the war. And you’d be completely wrong.”
Harry glanced down at his dented watch as the people around them finished their breakfasts, shouldered their schoolbags, and stood from the table. “Ten minutes, we’d better get a move on.”
“Strong personalities. Yes. I’ve heard that one before.” Draco holds out his hand to pull Harry from the powdery sand lapping at his shoes. There’s another ocean flowing in his eyes, gray and deep and knowledgeable. “I’m fine with that. You match me.”
“Anyway,” said Draco, placing the bones back inside the hollow, “I’ll show you everything else later. For now,” he brushed off his hands on his trousers, “Flowers.”
“They should be here soon,” Luna murmured, squinting into the shadows. She whistled, low and steady. “Come on, little one. Bring your mama.”
Justin has heard this account before, so he tunes out Dr. Patil’s youthful tales of traipsing about the MIT psychiatry labs and continues watching Luna’s hands.
Draco pursed his lips, and glanced around at the students among them to be sure none of them were listening in. “Of course, I’m worried,” He admitted, lowering his voice, “But Valentine’s might be the best day to go to Hogsmeade. I know a lot of people will be there,” He continued, accurately reading the skeptical look on Harry’s face, “But they’ll all be wrapped up in their silly little romances to notice anything suspicious going on with us.”
“I thought you agreed with me,” said Ron, “That Malfoy’s up to something. No way he’s suddenly decided to like Harry after trying to get him killed less than a year ago.”
That future felt so real that Draco could almost touch it. He sensed it thrumming like a heartbeat, alive in his fingertips.
“I dunno, let me think.” The first people to come to mind were those that were left in the Order of the Phoenix. Surely they’d know best how to handle Dark wizards…and yet, Harry sorely disliked the idea of dragging them into yet another conflict. But there was someone from the Order who had enough power and people at his command to deal with this new threat properly…
Finally, they broke apart once more, both breathless. Harry’s eyes urgently searched Draco’s silver ones, trying to gauge his reaction, but the Slytherin looked as dizzy as Harry felt.
Harry leans his head back against the seat. He’s tired, too – he hasn’t stayed up all night in a long time. Not since high school, which he doesn’t want to remember. Those five years are a blur, mostly, and Harry wants to keep it that way.
“I can’t thank you enough for taking care of Teddy here,” Draco said, pale fingers resting at the base of a wineglass. “I know it’s a hassle keeping this house neat, especially with a two-year-old running about it.”
“We’re down to wandless magic,” Harry pressed. “Draco and I…together, we can do things others can’t.” His tone was delicate, trying to be modest, but Joey knew the truth. She was speaking to the Chosen One, for Christ’s sake, who had figured out two-way mind-reading with his lover, who may or may not have been a Dark magic amateur.
“I guess if you’re so desperate to know, I might as well tell you,” Malfoy said with a shrug. He slowly pulled down his left sleeve while making searing eye contact with Harry, continuing to walk towards him until the Gryffindor suddenly found himself against the wall. “I cut myself because…” He paused, turning his pale and wounded forearm so Harry could see it properly. The cuts were unmistakably deep, deliberately so. “I love it.”
“Apparently.” Draco held out his hand, helping him to stand. Ron and Hermione drew near, and Harry was surprised to see that her face was streaked with tears.
“Because…” Harry met his gaze unswervingly, green eyes glittering with sincerity. “Because of who you are. Because of how, even if you don’t realize it, you’re willing to give yourself a chance by being friends with me. I like you because of how you light up whenever you’re talking about Potions and go on these long tangents that go over everyone’s heads because you’re so damn smart and passionate. I like how you tap your quills against the desk when you’re concentrating. I like how you say what’s on your mind around me. You can make me laugh, but it’s even better when
Harry turned, opening his mouth to call back to her, but Draco met his gaze, firmly shaking his head. They split away from their old professor, moving in tandem, slowly making their way through the grass.
But the future is unchangeable, and Draco keeps walking, unaffected by the world collapsing around him. Harry stops the car with a squeal of the brakes and jumps out, nearly stumbling on the trembling ground. Behind him, the very earth begins to fall away, revealing a tar-black void beneath it. Gasping, Harry scurries away from the edge, towards Draco.
“Please,” The woman said, nodding to the colorful cushions placed on the floor. Harry sat first, and the others followed suit. Draco took a deep breath, senses filling with the burning sage and a lavender scent that seemed to come from the many candles lit at the room’s edges.
“You ought to come as well, Draco,” Luna said thoughtfully as the fivesome arrived at the castle’s interior.
“He wanted a way out,” Harry repeats, later, in the Weasley-Granger kitchen, the three adults washing the remnants of their dinner. “An easy way out, it seems like. Instead of just
The sun has dipped into the ocean. Harry doesn’t look away from Draco, but he can tell from the rosy light on his face that the day’s end is near.
“Please, Harry,” Hermione said earnestly, “I hope you never again feel scared to tell us something like this. You know we’ll always support you.”
Cold bathroom tile pressed into Draco’s spine. He blinked, staring at the ceiling. How had he gotten here?
“Sounds gruesome,” Luna said with a mildly intrigued expression. “Well, I hope you can get over your shock soon because there may be another one coming.”
“The Chosen One?” Cassandra, a bright-eyed, black-haired girl, reached her hand out. Harry took it a bit hesitatingly, and she shook his whole arm vigorously. Tabitha, a more reserved, bespectacled brunette, only nodded to him in recognition.
Harry tried not to panic. Gryffindor had plenty of room; as long as he got the Snitch first, they should win. He rose above the field, trying to get a better view, and watched as Ginny, Willow, and Danny approached the goal in perfect formation, dodging and weaving around their opponents, tossing the Quaffle with terrifying skill. Another clang echoed, and Harry let out a cheer before diving down to search the ground.
The sight of seven red-robed wizards emerging from the trees sent Harry’s senses into overdrive - molecules of air against his right hand moved with agonizing slowness as he let go of Draco and reached for his wand. Harry bent his knees, automatically getting into a fighting stance, though his mind already knew they were hopelessly outnumbered. Sweat slid down his forehead; Harry was aware of every drop, reminding him of how pathetic the situation had become. So close to home, yet the chance to return had been snatched from Harry and his team once again.
A scattering of sunbeams broke through the clouds beyond the pair of wizards, gilding the sky in silver. Draco’s hands clenched and unclenched at his sides. He looked up at the sky, then back to the gravestone, his gaze glaring and restless.
A school of silvery fish flitted by the window, chased by a larger purple one. A grindylow twisted itself between a strand of seaweed, thoughtfully gnashing its teeth. In the distance, a mermaid crossed the scene, swimming from the surface down to the depths of the lake.
"Draco does have a big mouth, so that makes sense," Ron agreed. "But the content is weird. He regrets? How can you feel regret if you don't have a heart?"
The kitchen activities continued as usual; Harry flipped a pancake, and it gave a hiss while Draco rummaged about in the fridge, bottles clinking against each other. Suddenly, Harry was hyperaware of how both of them stood, almost back-to-back in the small kitchen. He felt Draco without touching him, without seeing him, and a tiny, intrusive part of him planted an image of them in this exact position, facing away from each other, wands up, each protecting the other as violence waged a senseless tantrum around them.
“Thanks. I hope so, too,” Luna reached over and took Ginny’s hand as if it was the most normal thing in the world. If Harry had seen them do that three months ago, he might have felt a stab of jealousy - but now, he was just glad that Ginny was happy. “And you, Harry?” Luna’s pale eyes looked towards him with luminous curiosity.
Instead, Draco lifts a pale finger and taps Harry’s nose. “You have freckles,” He mutters, and the discovery seems to confuse him.
“They’re explosive, and very sensitive…” Hermione mused, “Perhaps they’re needed for heat-inducing kinds of potions. You know, how Fire Mint is used to make Pepperup Potions.”
but also be…” Harry trails off, realizing. “I’m in my head, aren’t I? Have I been here this whole time?”
He tastes of sweet liquor, fingers tangling in her hair. Draco pulls Pansy up to meet him, and she straddles him, lost in his mouth and waist. Her hands rest on the waistband of his jeans. She fumbles with the zipper.
“Do you know the password?” Draco asked as they rounded a corner; the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s office came into view.
It took Harry a few minutes to convince Draco that card games could still be played without enchantments, but he managed. Slipping the deck into his pocket, he came to Joey’s cabin and knocked on the door.
“Nice one,” Hermione said appraisingly, then continued, “Yes, for the extended essay. You know, the really important paper that’s due at the end of the year for our class?”
!” Dahlia incantated as the spell flew towards her, and the charm absorbed most of the power, but for a moment, it sizzled against her skin, and she briefly shut her eyes in pain.
“Oh - it’ll be a surprise. But I thought you should know that it’s going to happen soon. Don’t say anything,” Ron requested earnestly, eyes widening.
They broke apart, both panting and glaring at each other with equal parts hostility and lust. Harry was unexpectedly struck by how sexy Malfoy looked, with strands of hair over his face and silver eyes glinting with sinful anger. And his lips…Merlin, he could kiss them for days. But Harry had more on his mind, and judging from Malfoy’s expression, he did too.
“Yes…” The tiger mask’s lips stretched wide over fangs, created the illusion of a cruel grin. Harry had no doubt that Dao’s face had formed a similar expression beneath it. “Yours first, I think, Draco.”
A sudden explosion of vegetation as the room swelled in size. The sharp, spicy scent of multiple blooms and herbs filled Draco’s senses. He gasped as grass rushed suddenly beneath them, carpeting the floor in green. Flowers and bushes of all kinds, chaotically arranged as if to mirror his thoughts, surrounded them.
“Why just us two?” Ron said. “Ah, it’s because we’re not geniuses like you,” He immediately realized, giving her a teasing grin. Hermione rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t help but smile.
Ron’s gaze dropped to their entwined hands, and when he spoke, it was with the voice of someone holding back tears. “Hell, I don’t even know where to start.” He cleared his throat and met her eyes once more. “Hermione, you’re everything to me. You’re brilliant, in every sense of the word, and talented, and funny, and beautiful, and…” He stammered, searching for the right words. “I honestly don’t know where I’d be without you. I’m the luckiest man in the world to have met you. I love you more than I could possibly say, and I would really love to marry you, so let’s get a move on, shall we?”
Ron turned over in his sleep as Harry took some parchment, a quill, and ink from his trunk. He paused, waiting to see if the redhead would wake up, but Ron’s eyes remained closed. Harry frowned, gently closing the lid; he realized he was keeping many secrets from his best friend these days, more than he ever had. It stung to know that they were drifting apart, but hopefully, the distance was temporary.
“I certainly hope so,” She replied, taking two mugs out of the cabinet. With another casual flick of her wand, two teabags flew from a drawer and into the mugs.
Something strange happened to the shadows; they bent, as if strangled, in a blink. Harry ran to the other side of the fountain. He was alone, Dahlia’s last living memories hanging from his hand.
“It’s fine.” Joey’s frown did not fade as Draco cast the translation spell, and Harry shuffled awkwardly to the cash register.
Draco felt a twinge of disappointment; he’d been hoping it was Luna, whom he’d written a letter to yesterday. He’d sorely missed her, but he knew how busy she was studying botanical magic in Iceland. “Do I know him?”
All three Aurors glared at this request. Ray took one look at their expressions and said, “I must know your intentions first.”
Draco flipped open the paper, eyes widening at the headline. Harry must have read it a hundred times.
“I am,” Harry said unconvincingly. “It’s great that we won, but…” He stopped, unexpectedly choking on the words.
The two Aurors walked into the silent darkness past the garden gate. Harry removed his everyday robes, and Joey tossed him the charcoal-colored uniform to drape over his clothes. Following the routine they’d built up over the years, Joey offered her arm, and Harry took it; with a snap, they appeared at the Cambridge portal, the sparkling blue circle activated.
Professor Slughorn patted Draco on the shoulder, which the young man flinched at. "Of course you do, m'boy. And now," He continued, addressing the whole class. "One per pair must administer the potion to the other. Er…Misses Patil, you should trade partners with Blake and Roswell. The effects will be too, ah, disastrous between siblings. There we are. Take just a sip, everyone. We wouldn't want half the class clinging to the other
“Potter,” Draco said softly, but the boy kept right on sleeping. The Slytherin rolled his eyes and tried again, louder. “Potter!”
“I’ll lend ye the proper robes,” Charon said as they followed him down a crowded street. “And remember ta act the part, ye hear?”
Harry couldn’t stop himself from smiling against Draco’s lips, his hands falling to his neck in a relaxed, yet protective manner. He’d surely never get tired of this, Harry thought, kissing Draco, whether outside or in the castle’s dungeon. He somehow tasted more intoxicating in the golden light of spring, like butterbeer and peppermint and flowers all at once - though perhaps Harry could attribute that to his serotonin-fueled imagination.
It takes a bright purple car, spewing smoke and bouncing along the countryside path, for Harry to realize that something is wrong. Honeysuckle, dangling from the windowsills, the cinnamon-apple scent of baking turnovers in the kitchen, Lily opening the curtains to admire the twilight, the moor wreathed in heather - the scene is familiar to Harry, but the car looks like something he once saw in London.
“I know, Potter,” Draco said brusquely, but Harry remained patient, reaching to touch Draco’s right wrist, lifting it higher.
Thus, Harry avoided the bulk of the student body as much as possible, spending the weekend in the Owlery with Athena or on the Black Lake’s far side with Ron and Hermione. Monday’s classes were tense, to say the least, and Harry didn’t get through the day without a few insults and not-so-sneaky kicks aimed at him from beneath the desks.
“Chapter four is about LGBT people. That is, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. Apparently, they’ve existed for centuries, but only now are they finally beginning to be considered as more than sub-human in wizarding legislature.” Hermione said all this very fast.
Teddy squinted into Draco’s face. “Oh, damn, I did.” They scrunched their nose, and the blue faded to a pearly silver.
“We ‘lose,’” Padma said, making air-quotes. “Nothing actually happens if we don’t make it. What’s our tally, Ollie?”
Harry whirled around, but the forest remained tight-lipped. A breeze blew through the trees, causing the skeletons of autumn leaves to skitter across the ground. Harry strained his ears; was that breathing he heard?
“Oh, this…” Draco tossed the pages onto the bed for Harry to see. “Just my end of the term research paper. It helps me take my mind off things.”
Laughter filled the abandoned classroom as Harry siphoned off the gore and semen from himself, the desk, the floor, and the corpse with his wand. While dressing, he pocketed the Slytherin tie as a trophy before adjusting his own. Harry bent over Draco Malfoy’s cooling body, pressing one last kiss on his soft, lifeless lips. Wearing an expression not unlike his enemy’s trademark smirk, Harry slipped out of the classroom and locked the door with a flick of his wand, leaving the boy inside to rot.
Harry focused on the light of the tiger Patronus, the silvery protection that growled a few meters away. Whether Dao liked it or not, the light magic would grant him and Draco safety, too.
Draco lightly pressed down on Harry’s shoulder - he immediately understood, sitting down as Draco stood over him. “I’m just fine,” Draco said softly, straddling his boyfriend. “And I’ll be more than fine in a minute.” Harry’s breath hitched as Draco settled onto his lap, leisurely unbuttoning his shirt, leaning forward to brush his lips over Harry’s jaw. Draco smirked satisfyingly as he felt Harry get hard under his ministrations. After so many years together, he never tired of the sway he held over Harry and in turn, the power he had over Draco.
In the early evening, twilight glittering on the white snow, the work had finally been completed. Stifled from the warmth and labor inside the house, Harry, Ron, Hermione, George, Ginny, Luna, and Draco bundled up in their various coats and scarfs to venture into the fresh winter chill.
Rabbit smartly didn’t wait before answering. “Dahlia Balgenchit.” They meandered towards the fountain, vial dangling from their pale fingers like bottled moonlight. From behind, they looked exactly like Draco, and Harry tussled briefly to reconcile the instinct of love with the knowledge that Rabbit was no friend of his.
The empty corridors seemed to stretch for miles under their quiet footsteps. Dawn filtered from gray to pink through the enormous windows, illuminating the cobblestones. Sitting in one panel of light near the staircase was Luna, softly singing a song under her breath that she evidently made up as she went along.
Immediately, the rabbit-faced witch stepped back, her dark eyes wide. For the first time, she looked unsteady, caught off guard.
“I apologize for my offenses toward you in the past, Granger,” Malfoy said sincerely. “And that goes for you as well, Weasley.”
“So, um…” Harry began cautiously as they headed toward the Tower. “Is-is there a word for a feeling that’s greater than friendship?”
Draco picked up one of the twigs and plopped it into the water, sending a bit of it splashing over the edge. “So? What’s the plan?”
With great effort, Draco steadied himself and met his eyes. His blond hair was disheveled, gaze muddled, shirt crinkly, and musty with lack of washing. Still, he managed a slight smile, lips chapped. “Hey, Potter,” He greeted casually as if he hadn’t been missing for days. His voice sounded terribly hoarse.
“Head out of the gutter, Potter,” Draco tutted, and he pulled Harry to the stairs. They sat at the top, Hermione’s and Ron’s murmurs and the clinking of dishes echoing indiscernibly through the banisters. “I talked to Andromeda earlier. About Teddy.”
“Now, now. We’re all friends here,” said Theodore Nott, slowly raising his hands in lazy surrender. “Came to see my baby sister,” he patted Tabitha’s head, who looked disgruntled at being patronized, “and lend her some money for this little ball you kids are having.”
“No, I ought to get to bed,” Harry said. “I still need to write that dissertation for Slughorn on the differences between…what was it again?”
“There’s a door in this wall,” He says, pressing a hand against the plaster. The building groans; Draco clings to him, shifting to accommodate the slant.
“The spirit,” Harry said shortly, as Draco pulled out his wand, warily glancing between his two colleagues. “I know.” Then, he softened, and added, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.”
Under the leadership of Headmistress Minerva McGonagall, the houses of Hogwarts School had begun to interact more and more with each other. During meals, the dining hall was no longer separated into blocks of green, red, yellow, and blue; though not everyone wanted to venture into inter-house cliques, still others were willing to try. Even the Slytherin table was dotted with children wearing yellow ties, as Hufflepuff first-years had formed a friend group with their outcasted peers.
be careful,” Professor Sprout insisted. “Five points from Gryffindor and be sure it doesn’t happen again.”
“If you fill this out correctly and we finish early, I’ll ask your mother if we can go out for ice cream. Would you like that?” The tutor coaxes.
,” He said fiercely, holding Harry’s gaze, “Want to hurt those I love. I don’t want you to be afraid of me.”
“Stupid question,” Draco amended. The chances of such a small explosion occurring right near them by accident were microscopic, assuming that explosions happened moderately often in Bangkok. He was positive they did not. “What now?”
Harry stood in front of Ginny's door for a moment longer. Part of him wanted to enter, to tangle his fingers in her hair, to hold her until her tears faded. Instead, he started back down the stairs for dinner, the green-sealed letter heavy in his pocket.
“Can’t risk jostling that arm too much,” Madam Pomfrey, “Besides,” She added with a knowing smile, “You seemed so eager to help.”
“I’d help you more, but I’ve still got five left…” Her intelligent gaze swept the room, landing on something promising. “Why don’t you ask Draco to help you? It looks like he’s done.” Harry turned to watch the blond, who shuffled his notes into a stack and dried off his quill.
Gossip permeated the corridors of Cambridge just as much as they did at Hogwarts. However, the older students had mastered the art of subtlety and low whispers, so the information passed around was more accurate - and more slow-moving. So, it wasn’t until a day after the new girl’s arrival that Draco even knew that she’d come.
“Yes. My father never cared about them, obviously. But I helped them on their way.” Draco couldn’t help but puff his chest a little; he was proud of what he’d done, how he’d found these girls better work.
Harry slipped off his outer robes and dropped them on the ground next to his schoolbag. He walked into the other room, voluntarily placing himself in danger’s path - though, of course, that was nothing new.
“I suppose we still can,” Harry decided and ran forward, scrambling up the shallow slant of the dragon’s side and clinging to its back. “Come on, then.”
“I’m all y-yours,” Draco stammered through the last word as he stifled a yawn. “Hold me, will you?” He turned, letting Harry embrace him from behind, and they swayed in place to the soft music.
“This way,” Harry decided firmly, and he led them down a narrower street, crowded on one side with stalls selling food and trinkets, the other towering with apartment blocks.
Harry was the most emotionally perceptive person she had ever met, unfortunately for her intentions.
The man raised an eyebrow. “Is this true?” He asked, and they nodded. “Fine.” He stamped Joey’s passport and waved her over.
“I’m sure you know if I trust you or not,” Harry said bitterly, reaching for the doorknob. “You’re smart enough to tell.” He stormed out without another word.
“Can you stay with me?” Draco whispered, both of his hands now gripping Harry’s. The ghosts of his tears glistened on his face, and he made such a pleading, childlike expression that he looked like a different person.
“Mum!” Not again. Not again. Tears fill Harry’s eyes - the days, the weeks he’d spent here, all for nothing. He knows that they were minutes, really, spent in jest, because he couldn’t imagine, didn’t even want to
"Oh-ho!" Professor Slughorn exclaimed, overhearing Malfoy. "Such advances, Mr. Malfoy! Don't go breaking his heart, now, Harry. He's delicate."
Lastly, and certainly not least, a colossal thank you to my readers. From the very beginning, your supportive comments kept me going. Seeing that my writing made someone cry, or enormously happy, never failed to make my day one hundred percent better. I consider it a pleasure and an honor to write for the Harry Potter fandom, who has been there for me since the moment I discovered you all on the Internet. I look forward to continuing to write the series, and I hope you can welcome my upcoming original character as warmly as you have accepted my version of Draco and Harry.
and doing so is a delicate process. Pair up, and let’s see…” The professor counted their number and added, “And there should be one group of three.”
Hermione and Ron had no such desires to branch out. No longer eager-to-please children and satisfied with each other’s company, they sat with Ginny, Dean, and Seamus as always. Luna or the Patil twins occasionally joined them, and the Gryffindors welcomed their company with apt congeniality.
Harry looked up from the form he was filling out. Professor Dahlia leaned over the little group of Gryffindors, who were completing applications and writing letters.
“We don’t even know what it is yet,” Draco said, rubbing his shoulder soothingly. “Maybe it’ll be easy.”
We’ll think of something. Her words echo through the caves, nearly devoid of hope - but not quite. As long as oxygen fills their lungs, as long as their minds can summon any sort of strength, they aren’t dead. Not yet.
“I think you just blew through a whole damn month of memories, Potter,” Draco says, judgement painting his voice. Harry doesn’t mind it. “Slow down, would you?”
The cacophony of voices speaking from behind her mask seemed to take on new meaning. Harry’s blood ran cold with the thought of his joining them.
This time, it was Harry who kissed him first. Draco’s ears were deaf to the whispers and exclamations, eyes closed against the incredulous faces, his other senses overflowing with skin and gardenias and the hum in Harry’s throat. The Three Broomsticks' patrons could have all been making the most obscene, hateful gestures at them, and Draco couldn’t have cared less.
Something gray and feathery thunked against the window, then vanished. Harry and Draco squinted through the rain, which was still steady enough to obscure the atmosphere. The shape shot up once more, and Harry could see it was an owl clutching a letter in its beak, drenched and dazed from hitting the window.
Possibilities tumble through Harry’s mind - blackmail, a shaky audio of them conversing, heavy breathing the uneasy background to it all. He feels sure that whatever was on that tape was a work of a stalker. Not a soul in Ashfell knows he’s even met Draco, let alone spent time with him.
“What do you mean?” Malfoy replied, exasperated, as he put a stopper in the potion. His pale grey eyes met Harry’s green ones briefly, then he realized what the Gryffindor was looking at. Making a sort of strangled noise, Malfoy quickly yanked down his sleeves and made to carry the flask to the professor’s desk.
“Harry, listen to me.” Dahlia’s fingers closed weakly around his wrist. “And Draco.” With every inhale, her breathing grew shallower. “So many…” She shook her head, blinking rapidly, gaze unfocused. “Can’t. Mercy. You must…” She paused, tears slipping down her temples.
“None of that,” Dahlia reminded with a faint smile. Then her expression hardened. Her wand tip lowered, pointing directly at Dao’s heaving chest. She said something soft in Thai. Dao’s eyes grew wide with fear; she stopped struggling. “If I kill her with the mask on, it will be a fate worse than death.”
“Wonderful, everyone’s present,” Professor Sprout said as Owen, a Hufflepuff, sidled into the room bashfully. “Now, today we’ll be looking at-”
Despite this assertion, Draco saw many more animals than he did people as they wound through the trees. A few tiny lizards, in shades of brown and green, scattered about the ground. Colorful birds, whose faces were streaked with black feathers, flitted through the overstory. A black snake wound its way lazily over a thick branch - it took Draco a moment to spot it, and he grabbed onto Harry in fear.
Closing his eyes, Harry sighed under Malfoy’s touch, even letting audible whimpers escape his lips. Malfoy chuckled, speeding up slightly, and Harry remembered that he was supposed to be in charge.
Draco sat next to his boyfriend and cut to the chase. “McGonagall said I can see my parents this weekend. I’m leaving for St. Mungo’s early on Saturday by Portkey.”
Invisibility Cloak!” He shouted, wand pointing towards the house. Shimmering fabric shot out of an open window, and he caught it deftly, spinning in midair and Apparating, Malfoy Manor looming in his mind with all the intensity of a nightmare.
“You don't have to do anything,” said the second woman, and Joey realized with a jolt that it was Dao, her eyes wide and young, her face smooth save for the crinkled brow. “Only come back home. Please.”
“Faster…” Malfoy groaned, his hips matching Harry’s torturously slow speed. The tip of his knife gouged into his arm, and he let out a high-pitched moan as Harry plunged particularly deep.
He blinked his eyes open to the bright afternoon. Draco sighed. “Honestly, I was gone for hardly an hour.”
“Hello.” Draco lowered the pages, which were covered in his neat, cramped cursive, along with a few sketches Harry couldn’t quite make out. “You can come in,” The Slytherin said. “Close the door behind you.”
“Hear what?” Draco’s words slur, and Harry glances at him, horrified, because he can see straight through him to the leather booth.
Breakfast passed with a peaceful mundanity, the smell of cinnamon, eggs, and black pepper drifting from the enchanted plates. Luna did most of the talking, describing an encounter she had with a thestral that weekend, her flow broken only by Hermione’s skeptical questions.
He thought bitterly, and felt a stab of resentment towards Draco, for approaching him first, and towards himself, for falling for him.
There was nothing sexier than someone with power who knew how to use it, and that fact became painfully clear the night Draco walked into the office of Harry James Potter.
do it.” He turned to Joey. “After all, you’re leading this mission. You ought to be in the thick of it. You need to be with the dragon.”
“Do you mind helping me out today?” She said, keeping a close eye on the players as they lined up to score against the first potential keeper. “The few people who were going to try out for Seeker decided not to once they saw you sign up.”
Harry gave an exasperated huff and opened his mouth to argue, but Hermione lay a gentle hand on his arm. “Let it go for now, will you?” She pleaded. “Give it some time. We’ll all learn to get along.” They all looked across the Slytherin common room to Draco, who studied by himself, focused on pages and pages of notes. “In the meantime, you two should focus on passing tomorrow’s test.”
“Table for one, miss?” said an old, pale man with rheumy eyes. His chin barely came up to the host stand.
“Hagrid’s back!” Harry exclaimed gleefully. He’d been keeping in touch with the former gamekeeper ever since he’d left to work with Charlie Weasley and his dragons, but Harry hadn’t known when he’d be returning.
“Joanne’s asleep,” Faraday informed them as they came in. A series of thin, yellow candles stood in glass holders before her, and as she lowered her hand, all seven flames sputtered into smoke. Eyes as blue and wise as the ocean fell upon Draco. “Something troubles you.”
For a long while, neither of them say anything. Harry’s feet are tucked beneath his legs. He feels young in the worst way, a kid sitting beneath the kitchen table while adults go about their busy, confusing day without giving him a second thought. His mind is scattered, puzzle pieces that crumble to dust when he tries to put them together.
For a moment, Draco turns around, and his eyes are clear, sober. He opens his mouth to say something.
This time, there was no hesitation on Harry’s end, and he let his other hand trail down Draco’s chest as he kissed him, coming to rest comfortably on his waist. Draco gave in and tilted his head again, their mouths moving clumsily against each other.
“Two wizards would not dare to attack us here,” Ray said firmly. “I think it is wise to see what they want, at least.”
“Okay.” At that moment, their faces brightened, and Harry felt that he’d made the right decision. “But promise me you’ll give Draco the same apology when you see him.”
More so now, Luna reflects, because through multiple mail slots she’s pushed little nuggets of truth. The world will change, she believes, if only very slightly. With every tape that’s played.
In no time, two sides had formed: George, Ron, and Hermione stood on one side of the yard while Harry, Draco, and Ginny held their ground on the other. Luna drifted between teams, giggling whenever snow got in her hair and making snow angels.
Harry would have continued to pick along this trail of thought had someone not opened the door and yanked him inside the dormitory before he could even knock.
“We’ve got career meetings today,” Hermione informed her classmates as she poured milk into her porridge. “They’ll take the place of first period, but it’s with our head of house, so we’re with Professor Dahlia anyway. And you with Slughorn,” She added for Draco’s benefit, and he nodded as he buttered his toast.
Before the witch could make a move, Ray lifted his hands and flicked his fingers. The door slammed, and the foyer was thrown back into hushed whispers, the noise of the street and people cut off completely.
A few minutes later, the four students traipsed out into the freshly-fallen snow, the ends of Harry’s and Ron’s scarves flapping in the wind. They walked as quickly as possible through the cold, heads bent, and voices silent.
Sorrow began to sink into Harry’s skin; he tried to shake it off, pulling Joey ahead, straining to hear the sound of Draco’s following footsteps.
