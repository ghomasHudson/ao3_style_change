If this place was so beautiful, why was it empty on a Saturday night….? What’s wrong with it….?
did she say?” Harry looked around the kitchen for a moment, “And how did you know I had anything to do with it?!”
Draco could look in any direction from his home and see no one and nothing. His nearest neighbor wasn’t for miles. It was simply him, his cows, his horses, and his sheep. No people. Just how he liked it.
and restrooms Draco?”
“What Charlie? All too much for you? Feeling scared, embarrassed, vulnerable? Hmm I imagine that’s what Harry was feeling all those months he was with you.” And on that note, Draco decided he would go and find Harry.
As Draco led them further into the home, Harry took full advantage of walking behind the father. He noticed Draco was once again in muggle jeans that tightly wrapped around his ass and he wore another fitted shirt, but this one felt more formal and definitely more Malfoy. It was probably expensive, and Harry was feeling a little under-dressed.
No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t figure out what had gone wrong. Why had Draco said he loved him if he didn’t? Was Harry just another
Harry stayed silent a moment longer, he wanted to watch Draco’s cockiness drop.
“You know, when you said out in public, I kind of imagined more of the public being around…” Draco commented after the kiss.
“I-I don’t know…” Harry grew quiet and looked off towards the wall. “It’s nothing. Have you…have you told anyone else?”
or Ron trying to hex me or something.” Draco thought the last one was probably a joke but chose not to laugh just in case.
Harry watched as Draco’s face went through a myriad of expressions before settling on frustrated but surprisingly calm, “He isn’t here.”
feeling some of the worst pain I’ve ever felt. I’ve forced myself to think terrible things about myself, about you. I have most certainly not ‘moved on’. I wish you would have just…talked to me. We could have figured something out, Draco.”
Draco seemed to understand and nodded in agreement. The conversation came to a halt when they heard a loud thud from upstairs and felt it was best to get the boys to get some sleep. As much as Harry wanted to get caught in the doorway with Draco again, he noticed Draco hang behind him as they exited.
His father continued to stare. “I see. And what are you thinking about when you do…
Starting at a very young age, Ron Weasley was his best friend. The Weasleys became a second family to Harry. He loved it the Burrow. It was a stark contrast to his life in Godric’s Hollow because the Burrow was always filled with people. The Weasley’s had seven children, so their home was always loud and exciting. Being an only child, Harry loved the idea of having brothers and sisters (but secretly also loved the idea of having his parents all to himself).
“Harry…I’m here. Talk to me.”
“If he’s your uncle, he’s mine too, right? We’re brothers…right?” Scorpius no longer sounded as sure as he did earlier.
“Let me go get Teddy…” Draco walked out the room and Harry couldn’t help but watch as he did. Even if they were lounge pants, they definitely weren’t baggy by any means. His mind fluttered to his thoughts from this morning before pushing them back down.
He looked at his father and suddenly felt very nervous. As his mother began to release him, his father stood up and started walking towards him. The two made eye contact and Harry let out a quiet, “Dad?” before he too was wrapping his arms around his son.
As his body and head recovered, the events of last night came flooding back to him. He slowly put on some clothes and begin to head to the kitchen. Molly was finishing cleaning-up breakfast and motioned for Harry to sit down. “Figured you needed your sleep – kept you a plate warm, dear.”
.” Draco smirked as Harry led him inside the Burrow.
“No. And I don’t want to talk about it. You and dad can sleep easy knowing your son is safe from the evil Malfoy family.” He bitterly shot back at his mother before removing himself from the table.
be the one apologizing? He shoved the man into the ground… “I’m sorry for pushing you so much to come back and help.”
“I 100% agree. It does feel…natural.” Draco took this moment to move closer to Harry on the bed. He took the man in his arms and held him there for a moment until he felt the man stir.
Harry knew this was true. He had heard it a million times growing up. He knew all about what Lucius Malfoy had done, but if this was the case – then he would have to show his father that Draco was not his father.
Harry smiled, but still couldn’t shake some of the anxiety from the situation. He knew Draco was right, but he was so tired of people being in his personal life for the past 25 years – he was doing such a good job of laying low. And now…this.
“Stori and I were just talking about the first Christmas we spent together.” Draco looked from Harry to Astoria before continuing, “…it was terrible!” The two busted out laughing and Harry felt out of place, so he politely smiled.
They did end up talking the next day and every single day after. It took Draco the next two weeks to fully come to terms with everything.
And without fail, some heavy breathing and several minutes later, Harry pulled off to sit at the end of the bed. Draco moved up behind him.
“I-I can’t believe that worked…” Draco sounded exasperated.
“Draco, do you think we were flirting back at Hogwarts…?” Harry watched as Draco changed positions and placed his hands behind his head and laid back onto his pillows. Harry stayed in this position and looked down at Draco.
“Hey Oliver! What can I do for you?” Images appeared in Harry’s head of what he could do for Oliver and Harry forced himself to re-focus.
Harry was terrified, but ecstatic. He didn’t care what anyone had to say about their relationship – well, anyone except Hermione and Ron.
“All this to say, that’s why I came over. I need you to watch Teddy Saturday night…I have a date.” Harry tried to hide the flush on his face but knew it was useless.
Harry nodded his head as if to signal he understood, when clearly, he didn’t. “Okay – so what’s the original plan?”
“Yes! Yes of course!” Sirius knew he had scared his godson and switched his tone quickly. “I just want to make sure you know…I’m here for you. If you have any
It's been a while since I updated and this one is short...sorry! This story WILL continue - I'm just also working on other stories at the same time.
“You know what Harry. This was a mistake. I can’t deal with this right now. We weren’t ready for this.” And just like that…Draco walked away.
“Oh, no, I’m not going. What did you have in mind?” Harry gave a grin and before he knew it, Draco was abandoning his routine yet again for Potter. He quickly dressed and made his way out of the dormitory to meet Harry at the Quidditch pitch.
The evening of Charlie’s arrival was filled with Molly hastily putting up decorations and preparing the Christmas meal, which still wasn’t due for another two days. Charlie and Harry kept their distance, and no one commented on the two.
He is mid-snip when he hears a strange
Once his family had enough, Harry walked Oliver out the door and down the pathway towards the street.
Harry and Charlie walked away from the party and into the Burrow – as if on instinct, Harry went towards the stairs. Charlie grabbed his arm and led him into the living room. “I don’t think going up there is a good idea for us.”
“One more question Draco –
By this point, the Prophet was already running scathing editorials on the Malfoy family. Speculation surrounding their freedom and why Lucius wasn’t killed on site mounted and it was all becoming too much.
Tomorrow would begin the second term of the year and their actual final year at Hogwarts…
“What do you think they’ll say?” Draco tried to hide the concern in his voice but could tell it was seeping out.
“No, Ron. I can’t. There are some things I can’t talk to YOU about.” Harry saw realization dawn on Ron’s face.
A date between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy could never be easy...
Harry spent the remainder of the feast alternating between trying to catch Draco’s attention and trying to
Lily inhaled, “Well, then we will figure it out. I’ll talk to your father.” She hugged her son one last time before she too walked out the room.
When he worked in his fields, he thought on several occasions that he heard the familiar
Best to move on.
“Bye Scorpius! Bye Mr. Draco! Thank you for having me.” Teddy flashed a smile and Harry still couldn’t believe this kid.
Harry smiled, “No, I know. I meant that I surprised myself. I didn’t know I was going to do it until I did it. I’m like that sometimes…I can be a bit…impulsive, I guess.” Harry looked down at his lap.
“Just after the way he spoke about you at your birthday.” Harry stood confused. “He never told you how he went off on me and I nearly hexed him into next century?” Harry, still confused, shook his head and Charlie laughed.
Then I switched to Hermione yesterday, but she kept wanting to
, but I’m sorry for you…”
“Oh, you didn’t have to get me something Oliver. I-I feel terrible. I didn’t get you anything.” Harry was getting nervous. He could feel a lot of eyes on the two of them. Oliver didn’t seem to mind or notice.
Draco was sure. He knew how he felt about Harry and he knew better than to allow himself to feel those things if Harry wasn’t ready to return the feelings.
phobic. And you just gave me a lot of both.”
At first, they were dealing with the fallout from their relationship in the Prophet. Harry was right. People were pissed. And honestly, it came from both sides.
Harry wasn’t sure what emotion he was feeling, but luckily he could read Hermione’s perfectly.
“No. It’s what I want. If you’re sure, I’m sure.” Harry moved in to kiss Draco again and it soon turned heated once again. Harry pulled away and looked at Draco.
So, that was that. Harry was…oddly sad about the conversation. Not sad because he wanted to be with Ginny, he honestly thought this was the best idea. But sad at the loss of normalcy he had experienced with Ginny. Even though he was glad that she too did not think re-establishing their relationship was a good idea, he couldn’t help but feel empty about the situation. At least back when he was with Ginny, he could look forward to something and someone. It made times in the forest more manageable, but even he had to be honest with himself, he wasn’t really thinking about Ginny. He was thinking about the idea of Ginny. The idea of having someone who you loved and who loved you back – like he watched Hermione and Ron develop. But this conversation with Ginny was right – Harry didn’t really ever love her like he was supposed to.
Harry dropped Teddy off at Hermione and Ron’s that night under the pre-text of “Don’t you want to have a sleepover at your Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron’s?” Teddy always loved staying over at their house, so he didn’t question it too much when he got dropped off on Saturday.
Harry decided to push the thoughts away and make his way to his house table for the sorting and the feast. The first night back was awkward. Harry and Dean had always slept in beds next to one another – the boys in the Gryffindor dormitory were creatures of habit and never thought to change their sleeping arrangements after five years together.
On instinct, Harry moved closer. He had no idea how his movements would be received but figured he should at least try to comfort the man. He moved into hug Draco. As he wrapped his arms around the man, he felt Draco tense up before finally releasing and hugging back.
“Ah – yes, of course. How could I forget about the hot fudge?” The wizard waved his wand and began on the boys’ ice creams.
Draco’s eyes moved from Oliver and right on Harry. “What do you care? You know, I came to talk to you – congratulate you for your win, but I see you have someone to do that for you.” Harry noticed the hurt behind Draco’s words.
Harry broke the kiss and looked back at Draco and smiled before turning his attention to the children in the kitchen.
He knew little things like how he liked his tea in the morning and how his day was just by seeing the expression on his face when he walked through the door.
“Oh…this is about being gay then, is it? Wait…you aren’t…
“Yes. Yes Harry it would! He’s not a good person Harry! Just – just date someone else!”
“No, no one special for me in Romania. That’s not to say I haven’t had my fair share of brief relationships – on and off again romances, and the occasional one-night stands, but no one ever really stuck. Mom kept hoping there would be. She included it in nearly every single letter she wrote, but alas – nothing for me. What about you? I know you and Ginny were together for a while. I don’t want details, that’s my sister and all, but are you two still together?”
Sure, he had heard about her. He knew Draco had been married and by now he knew the story pretty well, but…he never thought she’d resurface. Which in hindsight might have been foolish of him. She wasn’t dead. This was Scorpius’ mother, of course she would come around eventually…
Harry stared at Charlie. Charlie stared back. Harry couldn’t read the expression on Charlie’s face, so he decided to channel his Gryffindor spirit and continue.
“Just leave it Hermione! Obviously, we aren’t talking to each other, so obviously, yes something happened!” Harry’s frustration was rising – he really needed to work on controlling this anger.
Draco decides to stay back during the winter break as a way to find solitude and peace from the other members of his dorm while also processing the letter from his father.
He decided to get up out of bed and go down to the fireplace in the common room. He was chilly and in this moment all he could think about was laying in front of the fireplace, maybe reading a book and enjoying his peace and quiet.
Harry couldn’t control himself and his mouth fell open in surprise while his godfather continued. “We’ve known for a while…”. Sirius laughed and added on “Yeah, we’ve known since you were 11 and wouldn’t stop talking about that Quidditch boy! What was his name Remus? Chestnut or something?”
Harry smiled and walked towards it. He moved his hand over the sofa and Draco watched in shock as he transformed it into a twin sized bed, equipped with pillows and blankets.
Draco Malfoy made the Slytherin team that year as well. He even ended up in the same position as Harry, seeker. This only fueled their budding rivalry.
Okay, this is why Hermione had taught Teddy to refer to people’s significant other as their
Harry watched from his seat as Draco entered the room in a surprisingly good mood. He seemed to be laughing with Crabbe and Goyle, with his girlfriend Pansy following close behind. Harry was strangely happy to see Draco happy for once, but something about his demeanor was off-putting. This was the same boy who only two weeks ago had been sobbing in the boy’s bathroom and refused to attend any of his meals. And now he suddenly was…giddy?
“Right, well, I think we both have enough to apologize for, so let’s just put this behind us, eh?” Charlie gave a small smile that Harry returned. Before Harry could walk away, Charlie continued “Look. I don’t know what happened with you and Draco, but I do know that while I may have been your first love, I certainly won’t be your last. You’ll find someone to love who will love you back. I hope you can forgive me…for everything”.
Draco froze and stared at his father wide-eyed.
“As soon as he does, you’ll be the first to know.” He smiled at his godson who returned the smile and moved the conversation towards Uncle Charlie’s dragons, a favorite subject of Teddy’s.
He motioned towards his small dining table and Harry began to unpack the bag. There must have been a charm placed on it because the man just kept pulling out more and more food. Once it was all laid out on the table, there was no place for plates or utensils. Harry looked at Draco as though he was expecting him to do something about it and when he found no response, he flicked his wand and the table doubled in size and plates and utensils began to be laid out in front of them.
“Scorpius! Isn’t that a funny name? His dad’s name is Draco, which is also funny…” Teddy was bursting at the seams while talking. The minute Draco’s name was mentioned, all eyes turned to Harry – who went red.
– this one sounding much closer. He quickly decides to turn around and that’s when he sees it. Or sees…
Draco read the letter three times before giving it to Harry. When Harry was finished, he looked at his boyfriend and saw him crying.
Or so he thought.
“No…what Ginny?” Ron must have also sensed the tone in his sister’s voice because he sounded like he didn’t want to hear this rumor.
But nothing would match the memory of his own father after the war.
As soon as Draco saw Harry, his face changed. It looked like he was dropping a mask he had put on and revealed what laid underneath. Draco kissed Harry back, then broke away, “Goodness Potter. Wait till we get in the castle – don’t want to give these young kids a show.” Draco smirked, but Harry kept his grin.
“I see…” Draco definitely wasn’t expecting this.
As Draco made his way to the eighth-year dorm and towards Harry’s room he couldn’t help but notice the increase in stares he was receiving since sitting with the Golden Trio for meals. Just when he thought the whispers had died down, they sparked back up. On several occasions he had walked to classes the past week and heard ‘death eater’ and ‘murderer’ murmured under the breaths of students. It no longer seemed as though he could keep keeping to himself. Students were growing more brazen and it was becoming harder not to react.
much – way more than he will likely ever love you. Because unlike you, Draco didn’t abandon him. And Death Eater? Really? Where were
In the midst of his fighting, he felt a cold hand touch his back. It was at that moment that he realized his shirt had ridden up and he must now look awful. He heard the owner of the cool hand speak to Ron, “I’ll take him home. Just tell me where I’m going.”
“Has Mr. Draco sent anything yet?” Teddy bounced in his seat as he held his fork in his hand, hair flashing various colors.
“That was…” Draco seemed unable to form words. He just looked over at Harry and smiled.
“Well, before you do Harry, Charlie says he has news and he wants to tell the whole family! Charlie, what is it son?” Arthur smiled at Charlie and waited for Charlie to start.
“Yeah, well, you know…she asks about all my former classmates who also happen to be saviors of the wizarding world.”
“I’ll get it!” He came running down the stairs in his final outfit choice – dark jeans and a maroon button-up.
“Sorry…” Harry felt the need to apologize and wasn’t sure why.
He never did learn why…part of him figured a certain ‘Hero’ might have had something to do with it, but knew those thoughts were dangerous. Instead, he just simply let it go.
Draco noticed the laugh caught Harry off guard and was now wearing a concerned face.
“I see…” Harry let out before making his way to Draco’s neck “…that you’ve been watching me for a very long time apparently.” He moved to the other side and continued, “You know I like treacle tart.” More kisses on the neck, “and you knew I lived at Grimmauld Place.” Harry stopped and looked at Draco’s face. “If I didn’t know any better, I would think someone had a crush.”
at him?
couldn’t find you? Or how about in the astronomy tower? Or wait, you never showed…”
“Okay Potter. I don’t want details of your sex life, I’m looking for a reason for the break-up…unless they’re related…?”
“I actually have to tell you something…” Harry looked down at the ground and Draco grew concerned.
“Draco…?” Draco looked up at the man and quickly realized he was supposed to respond.
Draco reached out to grab his arm and pull him back down. Why was everyone grabbing Harry and pulling him down?! Harry shot a glare at him but sat back on the bar stool.
“That doesn’t mean we’re married Scorpius. There are procedures that would have to happen. And one of us would have to ask the other if they even wanted to be married to the other.” Draco was continuing to look only at Scorpius. Teddy had gone quiet and was finishing his ice cream in silence. He had gotten really good at learning when to contribute and when to allow Draco and Scorpius to have their moments.
“After this morning, I thought for sure you would never come back up here.” Draco’s eyes fell on Harry.
He pleaded in his head but knew it was useless.
“Potter.”
Draco looked up and he met the eyes of the man in front of him. He hadn’t noticed how much he had been avoiding those eyes all meal. “Fine.”
“Oh come on. Hunting bad guys? Saving the world? That’s your brand, Potter. That’s what you do.”
“Harry and
Harry decided to escalate their normal make-out session. When Draco arrived at the astronomy tower, Harry pushed him against the wall and kissed him hard. Harder than he ever had before. The two continued this way while Harry allowed his hands to roam Draco’s body all the while gaining his own confidence.
get Harry to help his father? What was his father capable of doing from inside Azkaban?
“It’s okay if you’re not Draco. I- I heard what happened… We can, talk about it if you want…” Harry had no idea where all of this coming from, but it felt like the right thing to do.
Draco couldn’t agree more. He’s felt that they felt right for a long time…
He placed a glamour on himself, went to Gringotts, and exchanged the money.
“That’s why I was late to dinner.” Harry said it so matter of fact. It was off-putting.
Kill Albus Dumbledore? This is the most powerful wizard in the world…how was he, a sixteen-year-old boy, going to kill this man?
Once the conversation stalled, Harry grew uncomfortable. Draco broke the tension and appeared to want to get to know one another a bit more…
, but I meant it in all ways – physically, mentally, and emotionally. I will always check on you Harry.”
Draco beneath him, and Draco him, Harry would pull away.
Draco’s eyes went wide at his son, “Why did you think that?”
bends down to pick up a book?
Draco couldn’t figure out the tone in his father’s voice, but something about the feeling of the room gave Draco a knot in his stomach. The room was heavy, and Draco could feel the magic creeping through the walls. He moved to sit in the chair opposite his father, but as he sat – he refused to meet his father’s eyes. He could feel them piercing into the top of his head.
They resumed conversation as if nothing happened in the doorway a mere few yards away. The more glasses Draco drank, the chattier and warmer he became. He began to ask questions about Harry’s recent dating history – which he found was a quick conversation. After the discussion of Ginny, which Draco rolled his eyes about, and then to Charlie, which Draco seemed
That’s how the four of them (Draco, Harry, Teddy, and Scorpius) ended up in Harry’s private box for the next Chudley Canons match.
“Nothing. Just happy is all. We’re about to graduate. I’m going to go on to play professional Quidditch, Ron is going to be an ass-kicking auror and Hermione is off to do her favorite thing in the world – continue school.” Hermione and Ron weren’t convinced but chose to drop it anyway.
“Is that true Harry? Did you die?”
“What? No – why would you ask that?” The boy looked back down at his plate.
further, and he knew Draco had more experience than him, but he wanted to end their first semester together with something special.
“At the risk of taking this too fast, you should probably go back to your room. This is a lot for one night.” Harry seemed saddened but understood.
“Right…I’ll see you soon?” Harry registered that the nerves had come back to Draco’s voice.
. Anyone else ever have that tightness in their chest? No? Is that just me? Oh, well then that makes sense! It’s always JUST ME. It’s JUST ME who realizes their sexuality
his son did what he did.
Draco spent his days trying to keep himself occupied. He fed his animals, swam in the lake, cut his grass, and ventured in to town. He was in the middle of doing one of his favorite activities, brushing his horse, when he heard it.
“I regret using that spell every single day. I didn’t even know what it would do…Not that that’s an excuse or anything. I just…I don’t think I intentionally wanted to hurt you. And when I saw you lying there…” Harry cleared his throat and Draco thought he could see tears forming in his eyes. “I thought about you while I was away seventh year. And when we met again at the Manor…I was so relieved to see you, but I didn’t know why. Part of me was glad you were alright. Then the fire…” Harry didn’t look at Draco, which made him glad. He didn’t want to have to deal with those emotions right now. “All of the commotion of the battle and the trials and just…everything. It was a lot at the time.”
“That’d be…great actually. Thank you.”
Teddy runs straight into the father and Harry watches as the beloved ice cream cone goes straight to the ground. It splatters on both Teddy’s and the father’s shoes, but all Harry can focus on is Teddy. He knows the tears are coming and he’s already bracing himself to console his godson when the father suddenly bends down.
Harry wanted his old Draco back. The one he had for just a few months before Astoria came back into the picture and made Draco depressed and anxious all the time.
“She seems open about it now…I mean, just based on some of the comments she’s made.” Harry remarked and wanted Draco to keep talking.
But those days were obviously gone. His father was in Azkaban and his mother was…well, Draco honestly wasn’t sure what was happening with her. But she had changed.
Harry liked Draco more and more each day. Now that the truth was out there Draco was noticeably happier. He knew he had Harry and that gave him a sense of confidence. So long as they could live in their astronomy tower bubble…they’d be fine.
But Draco wasn’t ready to let Harry go.
He knew Draco was an amazing father just based on how he was with Scorpius, but Harry always figured that was his own kid, so of course he was good with him. He felt Teddy would probably be different…but he wasn’t.
“Thought I would come and watch tryouts, if that’s okay with the
“Well…I don’t know if it’s true, but…” Ginny was hesitant. “Just say it Ginny! The rumors at this school usually have
“Ew!!!” The boys at the table said in unison, but Harry couldn’t be bothered to stop.
Draco laid in bed that night, unable to sleep. Honestly, he hardly slept anymore anyway, but tonight, it wasn’t the war keeping him up. It was Harry. Stupid, arrogant, annoying Potter. Who the hell did he think he was? What gave him the right to come barging onto Draco’s property and demand he leave with him?
Oliver looked at Harry, “What did I tell you, Harry Potter? Your future is bright.” And kissed him. Right in the middle of the Quidditch pitch…and it was perfect. Harry felt his knees go weak and his heart stop.
Draco let out another exhale, “I didn’t want it anymore. I regretted getting married the minute it happened. It was like something washed over me after the wedding. It suddenly hit me - I was free. I wasn’t in Azkaban. I fought and survived a damn war, I deserved to be free. So…I told Stori. I told her I was gay and that I wanted a divorce. That’s when she told me she was pregnant. She wanted me to stay; I told her I couldn’t. I knew it was selfish, but I needed to live my life.”
He learned that the professors were
Harry made sure to avoid Charlie as much as possible for the next two weeks. He was doing a great job of it. He would wake up early and go into town to “shop” and return only in time for dinner and bed. He decided to spend his time in town talking with Kingsley about possible jobs. He knew that once Charlie left he would need something to occupy his time. Otherwise, that feeling in his chest might consume him and kill him…Okay, he was being pretty dramatic about the whole thing. Which is why he took careful steps to distance himself and attempt to allow himself time to deal with all of the feelings that had been bubbling up for the past 6 months.
Scorpius. No, that doesn’t mean Draco is his
After only three weeks back, sixth year was shaping up to be the most difficult year yet. Hermione constantly looked like she was going to pull her hair out and Ron looked like he would fall asleep anywhere at any time. Harry also thought he started to see little looks exchanged between the two friends. Neither of them seemed to comment on it, but Harry could tell something was shifting in the friendship.
When Draco looked at Harry’s face, he saw a huge grin that Draco couldn’t help but notice lit up Harry’s green eyes.
“You’re married?” Harry felt this was an unimportant detail to be asking, but Draco had a firm face on, and Harry thought best not to question it.
. That’s what I’m supposed to say.” Harry placed his face in his hands. Why had Hermione taught his godson how to be politically correct…?
“Potter…can I help you?” Draco kept his eyes glued to the top of the man’s head – refusing to allow himself to look further.
“Hmm…I don’t know about flirting. I mean, you were
“I guess you got what you wanted Potter.” Draco’s voice cut into Harry immediately. He thought he had seen Draco in the stands earlier, but thought he might be imagining things…
“What? No, I – I don’t think so. She’s still at St. Mungo’s last time I checked.” Harry’s voice got softer and Draco couldn’t help but think about ‘
“Well, you gave me that title – so I guess I don’t really have a say.” Harry couldn’t help the smile that crept upon his face.
“That’s enough Malfoy. Go.” Oliver’s chest had grown, and he was standing slightly in front of Harry. Harry felt that this position made it look like he was protecting Harry…but Harry didn’t understand from what.
After they gathered the treats for the sheep and his new gloves, they made their way towards the produce and vegetable stands. When Draco took out his reusable bag, he thought Harry was going to have a fit.
Harry looked up at Draco and moved to kiss him. It started chaste, but quickly escalated as Harry began to push against Draco. Draco maneuvered himself to laying with his back on the bed and an excited, kissing Harry on top. As things continued, Draco knew this was a position that made Harry back off. He had noticed by now that any time Harry could
family sitting around
Harry shook his head and re-focused on the conversation, “Sorry about that, got distracted.” Harry smiled at the three at the table, “What was the question?”
“Of course son! We love you!” His mother was still crying.
Harry left the shop and ran to meet-up with the blonde man. Harry tried to not let himself get too excited when he saw the smile on Draco’s face upon seeing him. He also tried to not get too excited when Draco said, “Looking good today Potter. A break-up looks good on you.”
Draco dressed himself more quickly than he ever would were it just himself and made his way into his living room.
What a Harry Potter thing to say. Draco loved the way Harry was smiling, but also felt Harry wasn’t thinking this through. “Harry…do you understand what that would mean? Us dating? You’d be coming out…people would stare. They’d likely say things…probably not great things. I mean, I’m a death eater Harry. I’m probably the least popular person in this school right now. Not to mention the Prophet! They’d have a field day!”
“Hey kid, you don’t look so great. Get any sleep? You weren’t too much for Mr. Draco were you?” Harry shot Draco a look and was returned with one that said, ‘They Kept Me Up All Night and I’m Dying’.
“Close your mouth, Potter! Had to make sure I looked good for my
He found Draco in the hallway outside of Charms. He ran up to him and without thinking threw him up against the wall.
activities up here…” Draco winked and invited Harry over to sit down.
That was until Hermione Granger found him.
Draco remained silent for a moment, “Oh – how?” Draco let out before correcting himself, “Or, I guess that doesn’t matter. It’s Rita Skeeter…she’s capable of anything I suppose.” Draco caught himself looking down and looked back up to Harry, “How are you feeling about this?”
“Yes, well, even if that is true…”
Anything to make all of this stop.
Oh, that was something else that had changed. After much discussion, Charlie decided to leave his dragons. He insisted it wouldn’t be forever, but he told his boss at the sanctuary that after the war and the loss of his brother, he couldn’t be away from his family any longer. He was gone so much for the past 7 years and had missed so many memories with the family. With Fred’s passing, he decided to step-up and be the big brother he needed to be for George. He offered to come help him re-open the store and after much
As Harry sat in his normal spot near the fire, he could no longer stay silent. “Draco, what the hell is going on? Why are you acting so…formal?”
“I – I think I am bisexual. And…I think…I like you.” If Draco’s heart skipped before, it came to a full stop now. Draco didn’t realize he never responded until Harry kept talking, “Draco?”
Instead, Draco was stopped, abruptly, mid-way through his fantasies by a cold stare coming from his doorway. Draco quickly threw the covers over his body before feeling his entire body freeze. Lucius Malfoy said nothing but gave Draco a piercing stare before turning and leaving the doorway. As soon as he was gone, Draco felt a cold chill run over his body.
and asking – what does this mean for
“Show off.” Draco rolled his eyes but felt a small smile creep upon his face.
Silence hung in the air for several minutes while Draco composed his thoughts. Harry Potter…liked guys. Harry Potter liked…him. He started thinking more about it. It just didn’t make sense…he and Harry hated each other. They always had…right?
Beyond just the tournament, the year was difficult for other reasons as well. As the year wore on, thoughts began to develop inside of Draco, and he began to have dreams late at night in the Slytherin dormitory. These dreams started innocent enough – a distorted face approaching him and smiling. The next night maybe the face would begin a conversation. The next night perhaps some…flirting.
Draco didn’t think they would ever take him in after some of the terrible things he said to them. But Arthur and Molly chalked it up to him being young and impressionable and quickly forgave.
His favorite tree could be found in the library. It was smaller, but when you moved closer to it, you could see it move. The tree had charms placed upon it so it moved with a slight burst of wind – or even if you just blew on it, it would sway. It held snow on its branches that would melt off then re-form. It was a truly magical tree.
As soon as his father saw him, he came rushing towards the bars, “Draco! My boy! You have to help me. You have to speak to him – get him to let me out of here!” His words were rushed, and his voice sounded erratic.
The Weasleys had strangely took him in as family. It took a while for them to come around, but when they did, Draco quickly realized why Harry loved them so much. Being an only child, Draco had never experienced a family quite like this. There was so much love in that house… even with a person missing.
away.
“Yes. I’m married. To a wizard in Scotland.” She remained stern.
Harry saw red. Memories started to flood into his brain of Charlie. “Why is it every time a man kisses me, he feels the needs to have a
It took every ounce of him, but Draco pulled back and stood up off the bed. “I think I should be getting home. It’s getting late and people will probably be wondering where the Big Bad Death Eater drug their Savior off to.”
“It’s beautiful. But…why is it so empty?”
“And what about your dad, Harry? He
“Yes…Hermione.” He figured he should extend the same courtesy.
“If it’s not too much, I mean, we haven’t really talk talked in a while, but…why did you guys break up?”
Harry looked around nervously as he began to take off the cloak and maneuver back into the hallway.
“I went to Romania right after graduation because I knew this was not the place for me. I needed to be with people that felt as I do – who looked for adventure and felt that there was a higher purpose to life than some office job at the Ministry. The dragons were an added bonus.” Harry smirked and allowed Charlie to continue.
Quidditch (even more than Ron and Harry!). He would make them practice for hours and hours, day after day – Harry didn’t mind. He would give these stirring speeches before each match and Harry made sure to be front and center and listened very closely. He hung on every word the boy said.
The last week of his fifth year was a blur as was the train ride home. When his mum picked him up at the station, Harry couldn’t speak. As soon as he got in the car and they started driving away from King’s Cross Station, Harry broke down in sobs. He hadn’t realized how long he had been holding it in.
Harry decided to spend time that night talking with some of the Weasley children. He didn’t want them to be surprised when Draco arrived the next day and he wanted to make it clear that this is what he wanted. If they cared for him, they’d be on their best behavior. At first, they had all been taken aback by Harry’s sudden burst of confidence and emotion. They had grown strangely used to seeing Harry sulk around the house. But they all quickly realized this Harry was a much better Harry and agreed. George even remarked, “Well, if he’s good enough for our Harry, then he’s good enough for us! Plus, that means we won’t have to watch you mope around the house anymore. It was getting to be quite depressing.”
you know about me. I will not be speaking to him for you. You will be convicted. Because you are guilty. And you will stay here and rot away until you die the death you deserve.”
Once Harry left, Charlie let out an exhale and ran his fingers through his hair. As soon as Harry was upstairs, Draco entered the living room.
It was in that moment that an idea crossed Draco’s mind. Possibly a foolish idea…but an idea nonetheless. He would circle back to it later.
. It wasn’t Ron. Hermione made her way into the room and sat on Harry’s bed and took his hand.
Harry decided to cut the tension with a probably too personal question, but figured
“Oh…right. So, do you think everything Harry said about Charlie was true? I mean, it looked true…especially the way Charlie reacted. But how could all of that have happened without us knowing?” Hermione looked at Ron.
“And what about your son? Where is
“Of course Harry! But like I said, they are beneath you. Trust me, you wouldn’t be interested.” Harry felt strange at the thought of Draco knowing what he’d be interested in.
to help you exactly?”
They knew this plan was cowardly, but no matter how they tried to work it out, they just couldn’t figure out a plan in which they could convince Lucius to cancel the wedding. So, they’d flee.
“You. He wants YOU to bring him food.” Draco pieced together that she meant Harry.
“Right, yeah, I get that. Ginny and I didn’t date long, but she was someone to think about during everything. Someone to get back to…” Harry followed Draco’s lead and looked off as well.
“All true, Potter.” The two turned to start to put Draco’s broom back and head towards the castle.
But just as that thought crossed his mind so did another…
Harry was overwhelmed by the response.
“Take your breakfast to your playroom – I’ll be there in a bit.” Draco and Harry watched as the boy grabbed his plate and moved out of the room.
They turned the conversation to Harry, who also obliged and gave the boring details of giving sixteen-year-old wizards and witches their apparitions tests. Harry noticed, as he spoke, that Draco watched him with great interest. He seemed to hang on every word Harry said – nodding at appropriate times, making snarky comments, and even smiling when Harry made his own jokes. Once Harry stopped speaking the tension in the air grew and the two simply stood and looked at one another.
“I don’t know what you want me to say. Yes, I knew. I told
He held the letter in his hand and made his way back to his seat. As he sat down, he noticed Draco eyeing him with a confused look on his face.
Draco looked up in complete confusion, “Lost Granger?” Draco’s eyebrows shot up as he spoke, and he pushed for his voice to
Before things continued with Draco, Harry knew he needed to talk to Oliver. He found the man sitting outside one Saturday afternoon and decided to approach.
Draco snapped his attention back to Harry before relaxing his face, “You’re right, you’re pretty awful.” Harry was taken aback by the comment, but saw Draco crack a smile – so Harry returned it. The smiles quickly turned into outright laughter on both of their parts.
The two talked about everything and actually started to get into heavier and more personal conversations about family and the war. Harry could tell Draco was still guarded about his father and his actions but seemed to be okay talking about everything else. Harry thought he knew a lot about what happened during the war, but he was wrong.
Harry might have agreed to a sleep-over too quickly, but Draco had changed...right?
He found the store eventually and looked across the street to find a beautiful pub. Emerald green with black and silver embellishments. Harry felt it looked like Slytherin house threw up all over the outside but couldn’t deny it was gorgeous and refined. Definitely owned by a Slytherin…
These thoughts were dangerous to Harry, so he had to stay away.
Harry stayed in his trance all the way back to the Gryffindor dormitory and as he walked through the portrait hole and into the common room. He was so much in a trance that he didn’t notice Ron waiting in the common room. When Harry saw Ron, he smiled but was met with a scowl.
Ron also had a deep love of Quidditch. When they were young, James would take the two boys to Puddlemere matches whenever he could. Harry loved seeing his father interact with Ron – almost as if the two were brothers. And Harry knew Ron loved these days too because it was his chance to get away from being one of seven and just be…Ron. Both boys would dress in their Puddlemere jerseys and bring banners in support of their favorite players.
opinions on the matter.”
“…like you did with Charlie…?”
Harry gave up trying to talk to Ron and Hermione. Neither of them fully understood. Hermione was
“I know what I am. I want to be here. I want to make sure you’re okay.”
“But-but what about Oliver…” Harry heard the sadness in his father’s voice at the loss of his super star possible son-in-law.
He would repeat it until he could find the focus inside of himself to open his books and study. Books open, parchment scattered about, he heard a knock at his door. Draco looked up in alarm. What if this was his father?
“Well, for us, yes. I didn’t want us to have to worry about the Prophet or people asking to kiss your hand or trying to hex me. I imagine we will have to cross that bridge eventually I mean…if you still want to…that is.” Draco lost his confidence quick.
Draco was leaning against the door and running his fingers through his hair. “Take deep breaths, it’s okay.” Was all Harry could get out, he didn’t know what to say. “That was bloody brilliant!”
“Let’s tell them.” Harry looked at Draco dead-on.
“Good. Now, I do think you should go back to your room.” Charlie watched Harry’s face fall. “Not because I don’t want to do anything with you, but because it is late and it’s been a very long and…loud day.”
But the Kiss didn’t come. Instead, he was freed. No consequences. No stipulations. Freed.
Once they reached the pitch Harry looked over at Oliver, expecting him to head back to the castle. But instead, Oliver gave a wave and said, “I’m gonna watch practice from over ‘ere! Can’t wait to see how the team is doing!” before moving to head up to the stands. Harry moved into the changing room and found a giddy Oliver Wood still sitting in the stands, ready for practice. This guy really loved Quidditch.
Sure, when he was a child, he thought he would. His father was his hero. But years of trauma made that no longer a reality.
I’m slowly but surely working on this piece! I am determined to see it through. As always, comments/kudos welcome!
“It just…wasn’t working. It used to work. It used to work really well actually.” Harry got a goofy smile on his face and Draco grew irritated.
“This isn’t a good time, Malfoy. Why don’t you go back to the castle?” Oliver’s voice grew confrontational.
“Oh…she just…left Scorpius?”
“ ‘A bit of an uproar’ is an understatement. What strings did you pull…?” Harry kept looking around trying to take in all the pieces of the restaurant.
“Yeah – of course. It’s no problem. It’ll be good for Scorpius to have some interaction.” Draco smiled and Harry melted.
“You – you don’t have to get him another one. I can get it.” Harry tried to reassure the other man.
So now he just grows wheat. And has tripled his original sheep count…
“How did you know you were gay?” Draco’s eyes widened. He wasn’t expecting that at all.
Harry found himself slowly moving closer and closer to the man as he spoke, but Draco never moved.
Draco could feel himself in his pants and knew his pajama bottoms weren’t hiding anything at this point, but he could also feel Harry…
“That’s not true!” Draco gave Harry a look that screamed a sarcastic ‘Really?’.
He got custody of him two weeks after the war and at the time Harry couldn’t possibly understand why someone would give
Harry was beginning to notice that he was possibly coming out of his
After his flying with Harry, Draco returned to his room with growing agitation.
that.”
about coming back? Not the rest of the team…?
“Harry. I’m sorry for leaving you like that yesterday. I should have handled it better…I just wasn’t prepared for that.”
“Ron, why don’t you go up to the dorm. I’ll be there in a bit. I need to speak with Draco.” Harry watched as Ron left up the staircase.
“So, I wanted to see if you were also not going and we could do something…together.”
Harry read the letter and couldn’t help but laugh several times before finding a quill to respond back.
“It’s not important. Eat up Potter. Get some rest – I’ll see you tomorrow.” Draco left without hearing Harry’s response.
Draco remembers seeing the cottage for the first time and looking over its overgrown greenery climbing up the sides. The ten or so sheep in the field, and the one or two cows out in the field grazing about. Draco had never really been one for animals, but now found himself the owner of several.
Molly gave a knowing smile. “Of course, dear. Draco will always be welcome in this house – regardless of what
“So, the people in town really like you, huh?” Draco quickly turned his head towards the man with a confused look on his face.
during the war? You weren’t there. You don’t know what it was like. Draco fought for what he believed he had to. He and his mother ended up saving me in the long run. And as for me? In case you don’t remember what brought you here in the first place, the world already knows about us. It’s out and I highly doubt that being with me will
is to blame for these perverse thoughts?” His father’s words stung.
“Oh…right, yeah okay.” Draco stood and began to make Harry a plate. As he placed more and more food on the plate, he noticed Hermione and Ron sharing a look. Before he turned to leave, he thought of one more thing, “Ron, if they have treacle tart – will you grab some and bring it to Harry later?”
Well, the answer is yes.
all break! I came out about us to my parents and you weren’t there to talk to! You’ve avoided me since we’ve been back – you couldn’t even
That was going to be another conversation…and one Harry wasn’t ready to have just yet.
Draco wrote to Harry that night and the two men decided it would be best if they spoke to their respective children separately, but with similar information. Some things would obviously be different, Teddy’s use of the word ‘partner’ for one, but the idea would be the same – Harry and Draco are
After a week or so it died down. Now they received a couple of howlers every week, but for the most part the world seemed to have moved on.
“Harry…” was all Remus could let out.
When it was clear he wouldn’t, Harry continued instead, “Well, that makes sense. What are you going to do now?”
A year ago, he would have jumped at the opportunity. Took it as a badge of honor and felt special to be included. But as he sat at the table, something didn’t feel right. If he did this, if he took the mark, then that would be it. His fate would be sealed. He would forever be associated with these people who had infiltrated his home. The people who made Draco’s blood curl and his entire being uncomfortable.
Harry felt his heart fall. Ron looked ready to murder Dean for many reasons and Hermione simply put her arm around Harry. Harry knew he should look away, but he couldn’t. Dean looked…happy.
The Patil sisters quickly realized that neither Harry nor Ron were happy to be there with them. They left them as soon as they could, and Harry didn’t really blame them.
But logical, rational Harry was always overshadowed by emotional Harry saying, “You’re not worth someone’s love. No one wants to be with you. Draco just wants to be friends. He doesn’t see you as anything more, just like Charlie. You fall in love too easily and this is your punishment. You’re doomed to hurt forever.” Harry knew he was being dramatic again, but still he couldn’t pull himself to move past it. He had felt more for the two men in his life than he ever did for any of the girls he had ever dated or thought he
He hadn’t realized how in his own head he had been until he heard Charlie say, “Harry…you still with me?”
“You don’t want to go public…?”
Harry heard a faint, “Night Harry” before closing the door behind him and letting out a long exhale. He made his way down to his own room and prepared himself for bed. There were so many thoughts swirling in his head,
No matter what he did, he always found Draco Malfoy staring at him. The boy would find any excuse to insult Harry. When the three of them would walk down the hallway, Harry could hear Draco whispering “mudblood” and “blood traitor”. But Harry always tried his best to stay strong. He could hear Sirius’ voice in his head, “Never stoop to a bully’s level. That’s how they win.”
at anyone, then they wouldn’t outright say anything to him. Maybe mutter something under their breathes, but nothing direct.
“This was….nice. Could we meet-up again sometime?” Harry asked in what he thought was a cool manner, but actually came out a bit nervous.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Part of him was relieved to finally hear Charlie admit to all the things Harry had been thinking. He knew that Charlie knew about his feelings and he knew that Charlie didn’t stop them. Part of him had been so mad about it for so long. But after everything that Charlie had just said, only one piece continued to stick out to him, “He said you deserved someone better. Someone who loved you”. Draco had said that…even when he was only pretending to be Harry’s boyfriend. That didn’t sound like something a fake boyfriend would say. And hadn’t he said something similar on the day in the Malfoy library? Maybe Harry really did mess this whole thing up.
Draco laid back on his bed and closed his eyes. So many thoughts flooded into his brain at the same time.
about…anything. You can ask me. I know it’s probably embarrassing to ask your parents and honestly, there are a number of things they probably won’t be able to help you with. So, I’m here.”
“Oh, thanks.” Harry took a bite of his bacon sandwich before asking, “Where’s Charlie at?”
Harry laughed and began to move towards the payment counter while Draco moved to levitate the ice creams towards the door.
On the day Draco was set to leave, Harry came and surprised him on a Tuesday. He took the day off saying he knew Draco would need someone with him. And Draco did. He cried harder than he had at any point in the past two years. Possibly harder than he even did the first night he stayed on the farm. It took him so long to leave because he went up to each and every animal he had to say a personal goodbye.
“Oh – so…what?” Why in the hell was this man here then?
At first, this made Harry uncomfortable and unsure. He went back and forth between elated that it was out and anxious about what it all would mean. He hadn’t been ‘out’ about a relationship of his since Ginny…
Harry pulled back quickly. “Sorry…that was…forward.”
helpful, but Harry understood what he meant. He needed to spend time with Draco and get to know him. As a person, not as just another gay man he now knew.
Draco didn’t respond. He simply went back to his books.
Lucius Malfoy would spend the rest of his days in Azkaban Prison and Draco vowed to never visit his father again.
“I get it, Potter. It’s fine.” And on that, Draco took it as his cue to leave.
Over the years, Harry had seen Lucius Malfoy on several occasions. There were times in Diagon Alley when the Potters would run into the Malfoys while doing back-to-school shopping. In those moments, there were harsh words muttered under the breaths of the patriarchs of both families and fierce glances between the sons. Then there were times when Lucius would come up to the school for matches or meetings.
The third emotion hit several days after Harry’s departure. Sadness. Draco already knew he was lonely
When Blaise ascended the stairs, he was not disappointed. He found Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, shirtless, and engaging in a very heated make-out session. The boys heard him let out a soft, “I knew it” before he took off running.
Hermione fixed her expression into a determined look and responded, “I’m listening.” She closed her textbook as if to show that he had her full attention. “Is it about Harry?”
But Harry thought he would have more time to adjust to it.
Several weeks passed with no word from Astoria. It was extremely concerning.
The two never stopped talking it felt like. They could talk about everything. They talked about work, family life, potions, politics…everything. Harry was worried that with their different upbringings and everything that had happened during the war that the two wouldn’t see eye-to-eye on many things, but it turned out Draco had more sophisticated thoughts on a lot of things than Harry did.
But by far, his absolute least favorite animal he owned were his goats. He hated their weird, dangly beards that reminded him of a certain deceased headmaster of his and their little beaty eyes. They were such odd creatures – they always seemed to end up in weird places around the farm and even though he never actually purchased any, more and more always seemed to arrive.
Scorpius and Teddy seemed like they would combust at any moment from excitement. “You’re gonna get married?!” Teddy screamed at Harry who was still looking at Draco.
“Do you…do you want to go grab breakfast?” Draco offered up to break the tension.
“It is what it is, Harry. But what I’m saying is, I understand Ron’s hesitation. This…” He motioned between the two of them again, “won’t be easy.” Draco knew that was an understatement.
“Oh yes! He tried to get out of it at first, claiming he couldn’t return and then immediately ask for time off, but I insisted! He’s missed too many family events already and you’re just as much of a brother to him as Ron is!”
“I need a shower…” Harry shook his head and prepared himself for the day.
“I would love to, but I can’t. I’m sorry. I promised Hermione I would be over early to pick up Teddy. She and Ron have an appointment for Rose in a bit.”
. Besides, if Harry wanted us to know, he would have told us. Let’s go home.” Ron sighed as he and Hermione disapparated back to the Burrow to deal with Charlie.
“More or less… but I was actually going to say protective. I know he cares a lot about me, and I know he’s pretty much over me and Ginny. And I mean, he’s cool with Charlie being gay…so I don’t think that parts going to be the problem.” Harry’s eyes grew wide as he realized what he said.
“You went and told the Weasleys that we kissed?”
(See the end of the chapter for
While getting to know Hermione, another wizard appeared at their door. He did not look as friendly. He was pale and had platinum blonde hair slicked back. He had already changed into his robes and his whole appearance terrified Harry. He introduced himself as Draco Malfoy and held out his hand for Harry to shake. Harry immediately recognized the last name. “My father says your father was a Death Eater. He says he was a follower of Voldemort and I’m not supposed to trust you. Your father lied to the Ministry and that’s the only reason he’s allowed to be free.”
Draco rolled his eyes and made his way towards his room.
But Scorpius had been to Scotland a few times by now and Draco was getting better. He knew Scorpius would come back. And every time he did, he was happy and healthy. He was happy about being home and he seemed to rather enjoy his time with his mother.
“Yes, he was, but…” Draco was hesitating, “it was all true. Every single piece of it.” He looked at Harry and knew he was likely thinking about Blaise’s last statement. “Blaise had every right to be upset with me. I…I have been talking about you quite a bit.” Draco brought his eyes back down.
Harry was the first to speak, “So…” but was immediately cut off by lips pressing into his. Harry needed no time to recover and responded back quickly.
As he looked at the Savior, he couldn’t help but feel jealously creep upon him. The boy…
“Wait. So you
“…I don’t know what I’m going to do without him Harry…” Harry wanted to yell and scream at this woman for making Draco this broken man. Harry stayed quiet and held Draco again.
Harry relaxed and let a smile come across his face. He never will get over hearing Oliver Wood compliment him.
Oliver continued to come to practices. Harry liked him there. He was a sense of stability during a very unstable time.
discussion, George agreed.
“You’re pretty good at charms, huh?”
Draco’s life is what he would now call, comfortable. He doesn’t own much because he doesn’t need nor deserve much. There are times in which he reflects back on his past life and thinks about all of the material possessions he once owned. They were beautiful. But now, that feels like another time…another person.
Harry and Draco made their way to the dining room where upon entering Harry immediately stopped dead in his tracks. Narcissa Malfoy sat at a small dining room table, sipping a cup of tea, and apparently waiting for them to join.
“Oh! Nothing. I was just teasing Harry about the little
He dressed himself and went down the steps of Malfoy Manor. He noticed the house was silent – so his mother must already be asleep. As he entered the library, he saw two armchairs sitting across from one another and in front of a roaring fire. He stared at the seats before hearing his father’s voice, “Sit Draco. We are going to have a little talk.”
may have to say.”
“I’ve been thinking…” This couldn’t be good…
The summer after the war was nothing but trials and funerals. The whole season was a blur, but Harry could clearly remember Draco’s trial. He remembers the pale boy looking paler and more of a boy than ever before. He looked scared and frail as he sat before the Wizengamont and awaited Harry’s testimony. The one that would inevitably free him of his pending prison sentence.
Harry relaxed and smiled, “You called in a favor? For…me?”.
Harry smiled as he wrote and scolded himself later for it. He sent the letter back and tried to fall back asleep but was once again affronted with thoughts of blonde hair and grey eyes. Harry knew he wouldn’t be falling back asleep any time soon and moved his way towards a much needed and long shower.
, the next
And on that note, Draco began to walk away. It was in this moment that he realized he despised his father, and always would. But it was also in this moment that he realized – he was free.
“They’re playing Harry. You know how they get. They won’t notice we’re gone.” Draco stopped and smirked while looking at Harry. “Plus, I’ll be quick.” Harry didn’t like the look in his eyes.
When Draco entered, he saw the mess of dark hair coming out of a blanket. “Harry, you okay?”
Harry was surprised at the thought. “Why would you think that? I thought you hated him.”
“Yeah…well…that may be true, but we aren’t…together or anything.” Harry felt the need to defend this to Draco. Draco seemed to perk up at the comment before Harry continued. “What about you? Making plans for the big day?” Harry watched as Draco’s face fell again.
“Ah- I see. Well, very pleased to meet you Mrs. Greengrass. Your grandson is wonderful, he’s all my godson talks about.” This made the woman even more giddy.
Harry smirked, oh, this is how she was going to be.
real.” Harry’s heart dropped as he spoke the last words. Part of him had begun to doubt if they were ever…real.
“Draco was…nice actually. He listened to me and tried to give me some advice, I think. I feel…terrible about what I did. All those things I said. I’m so embarrassed.” Harry looked down at his shoes. He could feel the tears coming but insisted on pushing them down.
Harry couldn’t help himself, “Draco” he tried to sound stern but realized it came out breathy. He tried again, “Draco…are you sure about this?”. Harry hated himself for asking, but knew it needed to be asked.
Harry didn’t respond. Draco continued, “It doesn’t have to mean anything…” Draco was starting to feel panicked for some reason. The more Harry didn’t respond, the more nervous Draco grew. It wasn’t wrong what had happened…
Harry stayed in his room the following two weeks. Even after some of the madness had died down, he remained. He left for classes but continued to receive his food in his room – he never asked for Draco again, so Draco figured Harry just had a house elf bring it. Merlin knows the house elves would be more than happy to bring THE Harry Potter his meals.
Potter.” Harry could tell Draco was growing nervous the closer he got to him. Once he reached the still sitting man, he moved to sit in his lap, legs straddled on either side.
It had been seven years since the war and Harry was still adjusting. Everyone kept saying it would ‘take time’ and so he gave it time…but time apparently doesn’t heal all. He still had nightmares, he still grew nervous in crowds, and he still got recognized when he went out and public. Time didn’t change any of those things.
“We are going to town.” And on that note, Draco marched right back inside and began to prepare his things to take into town with him. Harry followed behind in a confused shuffle.
Harry awoke the next morning at 6am by a familiar tapping on his window. “Fucking Malfoy, doesn’t he know what time sane people wake up?” he muttered to himself before opening the window and finding another note – this time the owl flew away immediately, obviously not expecting a reply.
“Ron was…less enthusiastic. It was strange really. He actually didn’t say much of anything. He just kind of sat there and nodded his head. When I told him I was bisexual, he hugged me…He said he was happy for me. But when I told him about you…that’s when he shifted.”
“Goodbye Potter.” Draco turned to make his way back to his barn, but heard Harry following quickly behind him.
Harry was the last to arrive at the restaurant, even though he was technically 15 minutes early. When he made his way to the table, he couldn’t stop his heart from pounding. He looked at the two sitting at the table and quickly noticed how
to continue this, I think I should head back to the Burrow. I kind of left in the middle of a conversation and didn’t tell anyone I was leaving…”
But as soon as Harry arrived at Draco’s pants, he heard a “Harry…stop. We should stop.”
Harry returns to the farm and enjoys a meal with Draco...banter ensues.
Below the information was what looked like an address and more statistics about the coach. Harry looked up at Oliver, “I…I don’t understand.”
“Oh – um, didn’t really want to go home. With…everything. Doesn’t feel like home anymore anyway…” What was it about sitting near Harry Potter that made Draco want to spill his guts to the man?
“What are we doing now?” Harry’s enthusiasm for this work was getting borderline concerning.
He rolled out of bed in nothing but his pajama bottoms. He looked over at his robe but decided against it – he wanted the fire and didn’t want to get too hot to enjoy it. He put his slippers on and made his way down to the common room. He looked around at the emptiness and smiled. He had grabbed a book from his room before he left, but now all he wanted was to lay down. He started the fire and laid in front of it, eyes closed.
The man who opened the door was gorgeous. Platinum blonde hair slicked back with a few stray pieces falling straight into his face. A fitted black suit with a black button-up beneath. He looked so handsome that Harry almost forgot what he came over for.
Draco cracked a smile back, “I guess you’re right…”. The four of them continued to watch the game and Draco pretended to be sad when the Canons lost, but Harry saw a smile break out on his face anyway.
They came back to the dorm and went into their respective dorms with a quick discussion on needing to do homework and take a shower.
. Ron was training to be an auror. Hermione was focusing on her parents and planning to start her distance classes from Hogwarts. Ginny was going back to school. Percy re-gained a position at the Ministry. Bill remained with the Ministry working as a curse breaker and George was making plans to re-open Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes with Charlie.
Harry walked through the doorway and followed Draco towards the back of the house to the library, which after many Saturdays quickly became, “their spot”. “Have a seat, can I get you anything?”
Harry didn’t know what to say. Luckily, Oliver spoke for him, “Well, sir, that’s up to Harry. But I know he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do after Hogwarts. I wanted him to know he had…options. It’s just a tryout – nothing’s solid.”
“I know we’ve never really talked about me and my ‘coming out’ and I also know you’ve been too polite to ask, but…but I want to tell you. Now.” Harry just continued to nod. If Draco wanted to talk, then Harry would listen.
Harry shifted his body on the bed and placed his hands in his lap. Charlie felt that this pose made Harry look much more innocent than the man who had been kissing him merely seconds prior. “Oh, right…yeah okay…talk, sure.”
“You know it’s true Draco. No one is going to let a gay Death Eater, whose family supported Voldemort during the war have custody over me. Even if you are shagging the Savior.” Her eyes flickered over Harry and that was all it took for him to enter the ring.
The thought wasn’t as shocking as it probably should have been. Thinking back on it, it all made perfect sense. Things with Cho never worked out (obviously for many reasons), but ultimately it was because (as he could now acknowledge) he actually fancied Cedric. He never allowed himself to entertain these thoughts in the past. They seemed silly and trivial compared to the events in his life. But now, with nothing else to focus on, here they were.
“Yeah, can’t all be naturals like you. Do you remember that time in your third year when we played against Slytherin and Malfoy saw the snitch? But you came out of
As if he could hear his thoughts, Draco turned to see Harry staring. Harry was expecting another altercation like their one in third year and was fully prepared to reach for his wand, when he suddenly noticed Draco’s face change. Draco was…smiling at Harry. Harry threw a quick smile before quickly turning away. His face flushed and he felt his heart race.
As Harry finished reading the letter, he grew nervous. A pub. In Diagon Alley. Clearly Draco wasn’t thinking this through. The Boy Who Lived can’t just show up for a date in Diagon Alley with a former Death Eater… Shit.
Astoria would come back and take Scorpius at any moment. Scorpius began to ask questions about his father’s behavior, but Draco simply told him he was ‘tired’ or ‘working too much’ and his son accepted it.
Draco rolled his eyes and shifted himself toward Harry, “No. I thought it would rain last night, so I’m checking to see if it did. That would adjust what we needed to do today. But looks as though the rain was light and therefore, we will continue with the original plan for today.”
“Oliver, this is truly an amazing gift. I don’t know how to thank you enough.”
“Oliver…? Can I sit with you?” Oliver looked up at Harry with an unidentifiable expression.
Once the line went down and they were towards the front, he could see it. A beautiful display case filled with flavors of ice cream that seemed never ending. Each flavor seemed to be giving off a different smell that permeated through the case and out into the store. Teddy couldn’t be happier.
The first night back was slightly awkward, but Draco quickly realized that the rest of the eighth years felt as he did – let’s just get through this. They all retired to their dorm that night and took a quick tour before finding their rooms. No one questioned when Draco had his own room, the same way Draco didn’t question Harry and Ron rooming together. It was just how it was supposed to be.
Molly Weasley came bustling down the stairs and gasped when she spotted Draco. “Oh, Harry! I didn’t know you invited guests! That’s delightful! Come in come in!” She immediately tried to feed Draco, but remembered she was setting up for a party and decided to leave the boys alone.
The two flew around for an hour before Draco saw Harry begin to aim back towards the ground. When the two touched down Harry let out a loud yell that startled Draco.
him. And while we don’t know how, we do know that you are strong Harry. I’ve spent my whole life trying to protect you. I talked a lot about Death Eaters because I wanted to make sure you understood that men like Lucius Malfoy were evil…I did this so you could stay away from these people. That was me trying to shield you from the evils in the world. But that was also me not remembering how strong you are. I’m not going to pretend like I’m happy about this, because I’m not. But I’m going to trust my son and defer to his judgement. If you say Draco is not his father, then I believe you.”
Hermione took a deep breath, “Well, it’s not really my business to tell. I just saw Ginny crying earlier. Her and Harry had been talking in the Gryffindor common room. But I don’t know anything else.”
So maybe that’s why his mind was starting to wander towards his former nemesis. He always did find him rather attractive…a git, but an attractive git. And now, there was no denying it, Draco Malfoy was hot. Fatherhood suited him very well…
Harry kept his eyes on his food throughout dinner. He was careful not to look at Charlie. Molly noticed rather quickly and asked him if he was alright – to which he replied “yeah, just feeling tired. I’ll probably head to bed soon.”
Here you go! Kudos/comments always welcome!
“Maybe. But the more I looked for you this time, the more I had to really think about why I was doing it… So, when this case came up, I thought it would be a good opportunity. If I did find you, I could ask for your help. And then maybe you’d come out of hiding and…back to…” Draco thought for a moment Harry was going to say ‘me’, but quickly changed his mind. “…the wizarding world.”
“Let’s see how this goes, huh?” Harry smirked and Draco bounced back.
“Malfoy this is absolutely none of your business! This is between me and Harry.”
“Yeah, well, I learned a lot from it...if you know what I mean”. Draco winked and Harry felt heat rise up on his neck and pictures flooded into Harry’s head.
Harry dressed himself then went to grab Teddy and put some clothes on the still sleeping boy. He apparated the both of them to Hermione and Ron’s and was met with quite a site. Ron, half asleep on the couch, still in his pajamas as if he too had been awoken by Hermione (which he probably had) and a rather frazzled looking Hermione.
Harry always knew Draco was intelligent. He came just behind Hermione in their class, but he didn’t know he was this…sexy. No, brilliant. He meant brilliant. But maybe his intelligence was…sexy.
“Yeah, well, I didn’t want to label you if you hadn’t done so yourself. It’s important to let people speak their own truth.”
“It’s nothing big. Just something I wanted to do for you.” Oliver shot him that smile and Harry felt his heart flutter.
Harry couldn’t have that. “Hey! Look at me! Stop that. It’s okay.” Harry grabbed Draco again and began stroking his back before he felt Draco pull back and continue with the letter.
Silence.
Harry immediately turned angry. “He’s not Ron! I know we’ve had issues in the past, but he seems different now!”
The months between the drunken night at the pub and his party went by very slowly. He tried to spend as much time asleep in his room as possible, but also felt he owed several people an explanation and an apology.
“Well, Hermione, yes, I’m gay. Very very very gay. And I slept with Charlie and I fell in love with Charlie and I outed Charlie and myself. So, we are all caught up – can I go to bed now?”
He grabbed Teddy, said a quick goodbye to Scorpius, and apparated to Hermione and Ron’s. When they arrived, Teddy didn’t ask questions – just went straight in, started talking about Scorpius again and was happy to be whisked off towards Rose’s room upstairs.
“Yeah well, I typically go to the Burrow for Christmas. But with everything that happened with Ginny…I don’t know. I just didn’t feel right…” Harry finished and looked down at his hands in his lap.
Draco hasn't seen Harry since the kiss and has spent the remainder of his holiday wallowing in self-pity.
His father simply put his hand on his shoulder and gave it a light shake while giving a half smile. Charlie knew his father would miss him, he always did, but he would be fine.
“That’s great Harry! Is it just for the evening or…does Teddy need to stay over with us?” Hermione was taking this completely differently than her husband.
With only a couple of days left before his return to Hogwarts, Harry decided to come out to his parents. He knew they would be okay with it, but part of him was still very nervous. There’s a difference between your best friends being gay and your own son.
“Um, yeah, he’s cool. He’s our friend, you know?” Harry tried to make his voice sound as causal as possible.
Draco figured his mother must be grieving the loss of his father and decided to let her be. But this meant more time
Harry was at Malfoy Manor with Teddy on a Sunday morning, as was custom by now, when they heard someone trying to get through the wards. Draco opened the door to see a grubby-looking man outside the gates holding papers. Draco went down to the gate to retrieve them, but when he came back, he was pale.
“Uh, yeah. Feels great.” Draco looked around the pitch.
this would happen. Even when we were together? You knew you’d be getting married.” Harry didn’t understand any of this.
When Draco noticed Harry enter, he tried to fix himself. He sat up and began to slick his hair back. “What is it with you and restrooms, Potter?”
Harry immediately thought to himself,
As they were heading towards the changing room, Ron caught Harry’s attention. “Oi! You see who was at practice?”
“Sod off, George!” Harry watched as Ron pushed his brother back and gave a small smile to Draco.
Harry didn’t know what to think. He actually…didn’t care.
Remus and Sirius looked at each other and shared a look that Harry figured meant they were communicating without speaking. When they finally broke their gaze, Sirius looked at Harry.
“I don’t really care what they said about you, dad. I mean, I do, but I also know it isn’t true. You’re the bravest person I know…well, next to mum.” James smiled at his son, “then why get so angry, son?”
Harry didn’t want to hurt him, but instead felt a strong urge to sit down in front of the broken man, so he did. “I’m not here for any of that Draco. Like I said, I’m here to talk. Did you and Blaise…break up?”
Charlie stood firm and kept his eyes locked on Harry. “You know, I kind of thought you were going to be together for a while. I figured you two would be…forever, as cheesy as that sounds.”
Two weeks after the incident with Draco, Harry and Oliver were walking back to the castle after a rather late night of training. They had started a discussion about the upcoming winter holiday and Harry had asked, “What are you plans? Going to Scotland to see your parents?”
Draco’s letters became fewer and fewer, but they never stopped. Harry considered writing back on several occasions but could never bring himself to do it. He found himself thinking about the blonde-haired man constantly. He would replay lazy Saturdays between the two of them in his head when he was feeling particularly upset. Sometimes these thoughts helped, other times they made the feelings worse.
He was so lost in his own thoughts that he failed to hear someone calling his name from behind him. It wasn’t until hands were on his shoulders that he even realized someone was there.
They had the plan for merely 12 hours before it exploded in front of their faces. The next morning, as the two were heading to their first class, they made a spontaneous decision to be a little late for potions that day and sneak off instead.
“Would you like a beverage, Pot-
Draco had no idea what he was going to do about his father and the deadline. He had no idea what the deadline meant or what would happen if he missed it. But he did know one thing.
godfather) has told me all about your father. How shite he was in school and how he never fought for anything in his life. Just ran away. When the dark lord returned, what did James Potter do? He ran.”
He also kept going back to the look on Draco’s face as Scorpius talked about his mother. Did something happen? Why weren’t they together? He didn’t say his mother died…but he did say he stayed with his father.
Harry sat down at the table across from his dad, his usual spot. He opened his mouth to speak but was silenced by James continuing.
Honestly, Harry wasn’t okay either. He didn’t tell Draco about the meeting with Astoria. At first it was because he was waiting to see what she would do, but as more and more time had gone by, it just became better that way. Maybe she was gone for good… Maybe what Harry said worked…
“It’s a little more complicated than that. We wanted different things…” Draco left Harry’s gaze and moved towards the counter-top “Or rather… the same thing really”.

“What did you say Malfoy?” Harry was livid when he ran up on Draco.
“It’s not so bad. We really weren’t meant to be. He went to Durmstrang and was essentially molded into a professional Quidditch player from the age of like 8. He thought brawn was better than brains. And don’t get me wrong, brawn is really
Harry couldn’t sleep…again and the moving posters kept making it more and more difficult to not indulge in his new-found thoughts. He wasn’t averse to indulging, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it with Ron so close…and snoring as loud as the Hogwarts Express. So, he decided to make his way down the spiraling staircase and into the kitchen. As he moved further down the stairs, he could tell a light was on and someone was rummaging around. Upon further inspection – he saw the outline of Charlie (an outline he now knew too well) and what looked like a bottle of Firewhisky on the table. As Harry hit the last the stair, Charlie turned around quickly.
“Yeah. That’s for sure. But it’s less about work and more…other stuff. I mean, don’t get me wrong. Work sucks. Being an auror is actually kind of awful…” Draco would have never thought Harry Potter, the Savior, would say something like that.
It was in these moments. Right now. Just the two of them – he felt…good. It was also in these moments that his mind didn’t wander to his father or his family or…any of it. He made sure to just be present. With Harry.
“Well…I heard from Pansy Parkinson that Draco is…getting married.” Harry could actually hear his heart stop. He heard its final beat, then nothing else.

“Right, sorry. It’s gotten better…I just like to… be sure, you know?”
knew. Everyone knew…After you and I started hanging out, I kept pushing myself to not think about you or think it could be anything more. I went back to Blaise because I knew he was available. He let me because he wanted more from me.  It was fine until last night…” Draco got quiet. Harry immediately thought back to Blaise saying, “say his name yesterday while we were…” Harry’s face flushed.
“I’m around enough. We share a dormitory, several classes, and now the same table for meals. I notice things.” He had a point. They did seem to be around each other a lot lately. And Potter had noticed…
Harry forced himself to try to be calm and ended up coming out sounding more hurt than angry. “What do you want me to say? Do you want me to tell you how I think I was falling for him and now I can’t bring myself to write him back much less go near him? Want me to tell you how I messed everything up because I have no confidence and I don’t feel like I’ll ever actually be loved?”
He hadn’t been to Malfoy Manor since the war and wasn’t thrilled about journeying back and remembering the events that took place there.
With thoughts of Draco still swirling in his head after his rather explicit dream, Harry thought about indulging himself. But his mind seemed to be at war with his body. His body knew what is wanted – obviously. The dream had made is quite sure of what it wanted. But his head couldn’t wrap itself around it.
Draco finished his tea and placed the cup in the sink. He rinsed it out, cleaned it, and placed it on the drying rack with the rest of his dishes – one plate, one fork, and two glasses (one for water, and one for tea). He dried his hands and began to put his boots on.
she was going to have with me – until I fucked it all up. It would be hypocritical of me to be mad at her for wanting to live the life she wanted. I just wish she was here so Scorpius would have a mother…” Harry heard Draco choke up on the last words before he turned to look at the floor.
“Oh…” Draco didn’t know what to say. Or if he was supposed to say anything.
Harry sat silent for a minute. He had another question but didn’t know how to ask it. “Mum, why do Sirius and Remus kiss like you and dad?”
Harry and Dean had been hanging out quite a bit that year. After his talk with Hermione, Harry allowed himself to enjoy his time with Dean. He also allowed himself to think there might be a possibility Dean could like him too. Dean always wanted to be around Harry, he never said “no” when Harry suggested they hang out. He always sat really close to Harry during meals and would engage in really deep conversations late at night in the common room.
Harry forced himself to interact with his family and went to the Burrow on several occasions over the break. He ate meals, opened gifts, and flew around on his broom…all the while thinking about Draco. As stupid as he felt, he hoped Draco was thinking about him too.
you ate treacle tart whenever it was offered…” Harry was beaming at the fact that Draco was caught.
“Um…thanks, Sirius. I’m…I’m okay for now. But…I’ll come to you if I do need anything.” As embarrassed as Harry felt in the moment, he also felt very safe. He appreciated his godfather for coming to him and offering to talk with him about this. He also suspected, if the situation did arise, he would need to talk with him eventually. Just, not right now.
Draco had decided weeks ago that of all of the people to talk with about the ‘father issue’, Hermione would be it. She had reacted well to Harry and Draco’s relationship, she was even the first to befriend him at the start of the year, and she was, even if it pained him to say it, the smartest in their year…possibly in the whole school.
“Shouldn’t I be asking you that?”
That was all real, right? Like, he hadn’t dreamt this, right?
“Yeah, well, be that as it may – it certainly felt like shit when I told her that.”
Harry tried to keep his feelings in check when Draco described his relationship with Theodore Nott.
“Really…still with the Potter? And I can handle complicated.”
He hates the idea that someone is out there still propagating all of the

By the time Christmas Day came around, Harry was down-right nervous. He’d been around Oliver loads of times by now, but there something
“Yeah well. Here we are.” Harry felt a grin sneaking up on his face.
Harry thought the Prophet outing their relationship would be the worst that could happen, but now Astoria is back and is looking to take Scorpius... How will Draco and Harry face this new-found obstacle?
The tension must have been too much for Harry too because he quickly said, “Think it’s time to head back. People will likely be getting back from Hogsmeade soon.” And without waiting for Draco’s reply, started moving back towards the castle.
“Uh-huh, well Potter, I was cleared by the Ministry. You may remember. You were there.”
The two were broken apart by a cough coming from somewhere behind them.
The handwriting at the bottom of the letter changed.
“I see…” was all James could say. He agreed with his son’s actions, but he knew he couldn’t say that. He didn’t want to condone his son engaging in violence. When he looked at his son, he could see tears swelling in his eyes.
“I’m sorry that happened to you Astoria. I’m sorry you fell in love with someone who couldn’t give you what you wanted…I really am. But you understand…you have that now. You have a husband who I’m sure loves you very much.” Harry watched as Astoria’s mouth twitched into a slight smile. “Doesn’t Draco deserve to be happy to…?”
“Ah – yes. Well, like I said, I would take care of things. I imagined that the Savior and a Death Eater going out on a date in Diagon Alley would cause a bit of an uproar, so I felt it best to pull some strings and here we are.” Draco looked proud of himself.
Draco Malfoy loved Christmas. It was easily his favorite holiday of the year. Growing up at the Manor, Christmas was a very important time. The house was always decorated beautifully – several trees, all immaculately dressed to perfection with piles upon piles of gifts seated neatly underneath.
Astoria narrowed her eyes as if she was thinking deeply about what Harry had said. “When Draco and I got together, we were happy. I knew what he had done in the war, but I also knew, like you claim to Mr. Potter, that that wasn’t all he was. He was kind and caring and smart and funny. He was everything I wanted…” Astoria paused as if she was catching herself getting too emotional. “He promised me a family…a happy life. That’s all I wanted for myself. I wanted to be a wife, and a mother, and be happy…”.
“I’m aware, Potter. And if that’s all the advice you have for me, have a great day.” Draco turned back to his grass and continued cutting. He could feel Potter growing agitated next to him but refused to acknowledge it.
The whole school watched as Blaise went flying straight out the doors of the school. Students started to disperse when they saw McGonagall and Dumbledore, but the two quickly placed a silencing and immobulus charm over the entire room.
Harry looked back at his rumbled bed and thought back to his actions only a short while ago.
“You’re not THAT much older”. Harry tried to make his tone sound light-hearted and that he wasn’t internally screaming.
“Which it is…” Draco watched as Hermione shot him a look.
be married.” Lucius’ tone never changed.
Harry smirked before taking the letter back into bed with him.
Draco noticed the members of the table exchange looks, but he dismissed them and quickly turned to follow Harry.
“Draco isn’t like his father. And I’ll make you see that. I think you’d actually really like him…”
Just, not here…
He simply went from his room, to his bathroom, to the Great Hall, to class, to the library, and back to his room. In the library, he found a table at the very back that didn’t require him to look at anyone. It was just him and his books. He spoke to no one and no one spoke to him.
He had to constantly be reminded that he

“D-dad, what. What are you doing here?” Draco was trying to fix himself and tucked his shirt back in. Harry didn’t know what to do – so he just stood there.
“I get it Harry. It can just be…us for now. So long as there
“Huh? Oh yeah, sorry…just processing is all” Harry took a deep breath before continuing, “And Charlie, I really should apologize too. I should never have outed us like that that night at the pub. It was a terrible thing to do and not a great way to show my feelings. I’m sorry.”
“Harry…we aren’t angry…we’re just concerned. Why didn’t you tell us you were with Malfoy?” Hermione’s voice was calm – Harry could tell she had been preparing herself for this conversation since the scene this morning.
“You’re a hero? That’s why people know who you are?” Harry could tell the boy didn’t know where to begin with the story or which questions to ask.
“Hey, Savior of the Wizarding World, you are definitely not the worst person. You’re talking to a death eater – you could be much much worse.”
“Where’s Harry?” Draco had to catch himself, “and Ginny?” there you go Draco.
After the war, Harry was in no position to date. He was in a constant state of depression and had a baby to take care of. Ginny thought as much and never brought up the question of starting their relationship back up – but once Harry moved into the Burrow, it became unavoidable.
Thankfully, the change with Ginny was welcomed. Shortly after arriving at the Burrow, Harry knew he had no intentions of re-kindling any sort of romantic relationship with Ginny but didn’t know exactly how to approach the conversation. The two had drifted far apart during the past year and now with the death of her brother, Ginny was different. And if he was being honest with himself, Harry was different too. The conversation between the two happened just one week before Ginny was due to return to Hogwarts for her final year.
“Shit!” Harry yelled when he landed and realized how close the two were. “Sorry…I’m terrible at apparating and this farm is huge. I never know where I’m going to land…” Harry looked over at a startled Draco.
“Ron?”
“That’s good, right? Granger was okay with it, Weasley not so much?”
Harry and Draco ended up meeting in the astronomy tower every night for the next 2 weeks. It quickly became Harry’s favorite part of the day. The two talked about literally everything they could think of. But there was one topic they always avoided – fathers. Harry honestly didn’t want to talk about his father nor Draco’s and Draco didn’t seem to want to either. They just pretended like this obstacle didn’t exist.
He had been bracing himself for it so much that when evening came and he heard a knock at the door, he jumped in fright. He opened the door and found a Harry Potter with absolutely no emotion on his face. Weird…
He told him about coming out over the summer and about how not many people knew. Harry even told him about Dean…. He wasn’t sure why, but before he knew it – he was spilling everything.
“Theo…really?” Harry squeaked out, trying to keep his cool.
Draco continues his work in his field out near his lake. He’s learned that there are much faster ways of cutting grass than this odd hand tool he purchased at a store in town (apparently, this is for trimming hedges), but he likes this method. It takes a long time and makes his day go faster, gives him something to do.
about the two of you and how perfect he was?” Harry stayed silent. In complete disbelief that
“Draco! You haven’t told him! This directly concerns him!” She was trying to keep her voice level, but he could hear it beginning to rise.
Harry didn’t understand. None of this was making sense. “Why didn’t you tell me?” was all Harry managed to get out of his rattled brain.
Harry was anxious the rest of the week. Part of him knew it was because he was going to his former nemesis now ridiculously attractive father’s house for a playdate that would invariably be awkward, but another part knew it was because of the house he would be going to…
He returned to the Manor and found it empty. His father was sentenced to Azkaban and even though his mother too was freed, she couldn’t handle it. She drove herself mad with worry over her husband and found herself put away in St. Mungo’s. Draco was alone. And he quickly found out that the Manor was the
“Oh…um, I didn’t realize… I’m sorry.”
Harry wondered if these people would have given him the same welcome, bonded with him over the same topics. Draco and Oliver were very similar – both valued their schooling and took great care to make their families proud. Both men loved Quidditch and excelled at it. And both men took care of Harry…or at least
Draco saw the way Harry’s face changed quickly into anger, “Ah! Why are you still such an arsehole?” and just like that,
Harry doesn’t seem to have spotted Draco yet, but instead seems to be looking around in utter confusion.
Harry disappeared for a while, then returned to find a concerned Hermione and Ron sitting next to one another in the living room.
“Oh, Harry…” Hermione’s voice sounded pitiful.
He re-plays the scene of Harry Potter rolling out of Hagrid’s arms and jumping to defeat Voldemort. It’s his favorite memory from the war. It’s the moment he felt hopeful for the first time in a long time and as he watched the Dark Lord die (for good) he felt relief wash over his body.
“Yes, at Hogwarts and because like I said, fighting a war Potter.”
“Yeah – like what?” Harry was being defiant.
The first question out of Harry’s mouth was a question that Draco too had been asking, “How did he know you and I were friendly?” Draco noticed the way Harry blushed on the word ‘friendly’ and it took everything he had not to smile and to remain focused on the conversation.
The longer Harry laid in bed the more he spiraled. He began to think of all the terrible things Draco had done while they were at Hogwarts and as a Death Eater. He began to think about all of the Malfoys and even though Narcissa and Draco helped Harry in the end, what if this was all some larger plot. What if Draco really hadn’t changed and was just waiting for an opportunity to find Harry at his weakest so he could….
The next morning, Harry awoke with the worst headache he had ever experienced in his life. It was at that precise moment that he swore-off Firewhisky for good. As he glanced around his room, he saw a small potion bottle next to him on his nightstand. There was a note that read, “Drink me, I cure hangovers”. Harry drank the vial and immediately felt relief.
“Why do you sit back here anyway?” Draco was surprised at the continuation of the conversation.
“Yes. Discussions took place this summer. Arrangements have been made…we marry after graduation.”
Apparently that was the wrong thing for Draco to say because talk about it he DID. Draco heard everything. But to his credit, his upbringing taught him it was rude to make faces while someone was speaking. So, he sat and listened with a neutral expression on his face. He only made a face twice – once when Harry said he was gay and once when Harry went in
“At the risk of losing the
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
But things took a turn one night in early August. Draco was sitting at the dinner table with his parents and being served their dinner by the house elves. As he sat there, thoughts began to pop into his mind, and he began to feel familiar feelings running throughout his body. He continued to engage in normal, polite conversation with his mother and father – listening as they discussed day-to-day items from the Manor and their estate. But once dinner was over, Draco quickly excused himself from the table and made his way to his bedroom.
Professors Snape and McGonagall came running around the corner and quickly took the children away. Snape took the three boys to the Hospital Wing while McGonagall ushered Harry to a separate room. She began asking him what happened, and he honestly couldn’t even remember. He knew Draco had been insulting him and he knew he used magic, but he had no idea how. He didn’t even remember saying a spell…
“Oh…shite ‘arry. I’m sorry. I didn’t…I thought that was a rumor or like a joke. I didn’t know you were…” Harry jumped in before Oliver could finish.
As much as this weighed on his mind, he couldn’t stop thinking about the kiss. It was…perfect. It was everything he ever thought kissing Harry Potter would be and more. As much as he wanted to block it out and pretend it didn’t happen (because honestly that would be easier than acknowledging it did indeed happen and that Harry had run off after), he couldn’t. He replayed it every night before he went to sleep for the rest of break. He knew it was dangerous. He needed to block it out – make it go away. There was no use focusing on it.
“Another? You’ve been obsessed with me before?” Harry gave an expression of disbelief.
Harry wasn’t prepared for this response. He sat up on his elbow and looked at Draco who was smiling at him. “You agree? You’ll write? You promise?”
When Harry arrived at the astronomy tower, Draco wasn’t there. Harry decided to wait and took out his homework from the day. He could barely remember even going to classes after the events of that morning, but felt it was best to at least attempt to do work. After an hour, Harry heard footsteps on the stairs. When Draco arrived, he looked surprised to see Harry there.
they looked together. Perfect, even.
“Oh, um, and you raise him…alone?”
“Harry…Harry Potter. I know he helped you and your mother. He can help me too. Talk to him Draco!” Draco stood incredulous.
The next morning, the Hogwarts rumor-mill was back up and running. And if Harry thought in his final year he would be immune to being involved, he was wrong. He wasn’t sure how, but someone found out about his and Draco’s argument last night. And just like last time, the rumor varied person to person.
“Please. A lad like you? You’ll have plenty of options when you get out of here. Your future is too bright for you to be terrified.” Oliver spoke to Harry like they’d been friends for years. Harry thought talking to Oliver again after all this time would be strange, but they seemed to settle back into their natural rhythm.
Some memories hurt more than others. The memory of seeing a disfigured Harry Potter dragged into his home and held up for him to expose (which he knew he couldn’t do). Or the screams of Hermione Granger being sliced open by his aunt. The look on Luna Lovegood’s face as Draco brought food down to her and the others in the cellar of his childhood home.
“You got me a present?” Draco couldn’t help the look of shock on his face.
“I’m gay, Potter.”
Still looking at Draco, he noticed he was quiet for a long time. Draco seemed to be expecting an answer and his face was falling the longer it took to get one.
“Of course.”
“Oliver…” Harry really didn’t know what to say. He felt foolish, standing almost naked against this wall. He also felt very embarrassed, because Oliver was right….
Harry told himself many times over the next several months that he should stop. His feelings were getting dangerous. Charlie would smile at him across the room and Harry’s heart would stop. He would accidently brush against Harry while moving around the kitchen and Harry would go weak. He knew he should just stop. Stop having sex with Charlie. Stop looking at him from across the room. Stop watching him after a Quidditch game. Stop waiting for him at night. But he couldn’t. He didn’t want to.
Harry sat and began to be served by a different house elf than he had seen before. He began to wonder just how many house elves the Malfoys had. As he was about to start-in on his meal, anything to get this over with, Narcissa looked at him and asked “So, Mr. Potter, I believe my son is quite taken with you.”
By the time his fifth year came around, Harry knew he couldn’t fool himself any longer. His obsession with Oliver Wood, his fascination with Cedric Diggory, and now his
Draco and Harry hadn’t spoken much since the night he brought him dinner. Draco wasn’t sure who was avoiding who at this point but did know he wasn’t going out of his way to interact with Potter either. Their last conversation had hit too close to home for Draco. So, Draco decided to go back to keeping his head down.
Who all could he have been with…?
“I see…and does he know about me? Does he know about Scorpius?”
“Okay…so you think you’re bisexual? Potter, one kiss doesn’t make you bisexual. Kissing another guy doesn’t make you bisexual. It’s about how you
He would never ask Harry to do anything for his father.
“Harry. I feel like we should talk. The things he said…” Harry could tell Draco was struggling to say what he wanted to say.
“Trust me, Draco. They do.” Harry looked away and Draco had a faint smile cross his face. “You ever think about marrying one of them?”
But instead, all he felt was fear – he wanted to run out the library and go back to the safety of his room (or where there once was safety).
Draco spoke with so much passion that he would actually end up sweating a little bit and it would gather at the top of his hair line. He would move his arms and body around to explain certain spells and potions to Harry and Harry listened intently. Harry was enjoying his conversation so much that he soon found himself yawning and wanting to lie down.
“You have to come back.” Draco stared at Harry and blinked his eyes a few times. Surely, he misheard the man.
“Guess we’re the only ones here.” He heard a familiar voice and immediately popped his eyes open and sat up.
“Yeah. The second time…that was not me at my best. But, Blaise had enough. Obviously, I wasn’t doing a good enough job of hiding my feelings for you and Blaise took it upon himself to out me and our relationship. He told people very…personal things and I was hurt. I didn’t give a shite that he ended things with me. I was upset because now
“True. But haven’t you seen the flock of students lining up to date me? I’m very sought after you know.” Draco kept a serious face for as long as possible before cracking into a smile.
Well, no. Actually, he never hated Harry. He envied Harry, he was infuriated by Harry (at times), he (though he would never admit it) admired Harry, and he…found Harry attractive.
Harry thought the conversation was over, but found his godfather still sitting on the side of his bed. “Harry, we do need to talk though.”
Draco made his plate and began to eat in silence. The way he preferred it.
Here's a short epilogue to wrap-up the story, hope you enjoyed! Kudos and comments always welcome!
“Her name is Ginny. She’s lovely actually. And he didn’t exactly turn me down…”
“Your most inventive yet my boy! Always keeping me on my toes!” The wizard behind the counter flicked his wand to begin the concoction. And a large cone of ice cream – topped with all of Teddy’s favorites appeared in front of him. He watched the ice cream carefully as his godfather paid and they began to exit the shop.
and instead, just allowed himself to let it happen.
“Draco Malfoy uses a reusable, muggle shopping bag?!” Harry’s voice was far too loud and was bound to catch attention.
Oliver took a drink of eggnog before answering, “Yes sir. With my build, keeper’s the best position for me I believe.”
Not even two months back and the Hogwarts rumor-mill was back up and running. Harry had, fortunately, never been in the rumor-mill but over the years had found that the mill proved to be scary accurate.
“Don’t bother, I got it. Take care of yourself, Potter.” And with that, Draco was gone.
“This isn’t my concern Potter! That’s no longer my world!”
– he decided to leave certain parts to just he and his godfathers. Harry tried not to look at his parents while he spoke, instead choosing to focus on the floor or a wall.
Only a couple of chapters left (I think)! Enjoy!
The marriage. Harry’s mind kept going back to it. Draco had been
Charlie turned left to go into his room and waited patiently as everyone around him sluggishly dragged themselves into their respective rooms and beds. Charlie grabbed Harry by the arm and pulled him into his room. He threw Harry up against the wall and kissed him – hard and deep. For a split second he thought he had made a mistake as he felt Harry tense up. But then, he could feel the exact moment Harry relaxed and kissed back. Harry opened his mouth, only slightly, but enough for Charlie to push inside. As soon as he was in, he quickly pulled his whole body away. He needed to see Harry’s face. Needed to make sure this was what he wanted.
Harry had always loved quidditch and after seeing the World Cup, he had wanted to go to more and more professional games. So, as soon as he was able to, he purchased himself a private box. The box was large enough to hold 10 people comfortably and offered a house elf that would help prepare you and your guests food and drinks while you enjoyed the game (for this reason, Hermione chose not to accompany him much).
would act to such a public act.
The year was beginning to wind-down and Harry was getting nervous. He knew he barely held it together over the winter break – he didn’t know how he was going to handle an entire summer. The day before the end of term, Harry and Draco found themselves in their usual spot doing their usual…things when Draco slowly pulled back from Harry. Harry was sad at the loss of contact but looked into Draco’s eyes and felt a sudden rush. Draco was staring directly into Harry’s eyes…
“Well, I wouldn’t use those terms, but yes. More or less. But you don’t have to. You can continue to sit alone and talk to…no one.” Her tone sounded dismissive, but he knew her. She was using a tactic to get him to go.
Charlie immediately shot an aggressive look towards the blonde-haired boy. “It isn’t polite to eavesdrop Malfoy.”
Voldemort was defeated on October 31, 1981. No one knows exactly
But once the dust settled and he found a routine at the Burrow, he did try dating. He tried to go out and meet girls, but nothing felt right. He chalked it up to feelings from the war or knowing he had a kid at home to take care of, but part of him also knew he wasn’t living his true self. He still liked women and found them attractive, but there was something nagging inside of himself. Something that kept making his eyes drift away from the women in the bar and towards their boyfriends/husbands. Something that made him want to date men…
Blaise was still hurt and was growing suspicious of where Draco disappeared to every night. He decided to take it upon himself to figure it out and followed Draco to the astronomy tower. He knew what Draco used that spot for and decided to wait at the bottom of the tower for enough time to catch Draco in the act.
Draco finally found words in his head and he couldn’t just sit here and listen to Harry ramble any longer. “Potter…where is all this going? What are you trying to say…?”
Harry decided to change the subject and tell Draco about his meeting with Kingsley. “I haven’t told anyone else about it, but…what do you think?” Harry was worried about the mention of muggle-borns and an acknowledgement of the war, but he forced himself to remember that this was a different Draco.
Harry returned to the room he shared with Ron and began to dress for bed.

her to have him! I’ve spent the past four years trying to make sure Scorpius felt loved and supported. I’m never going to leave him.”
interested in, there wasn’t much else to say.
Draco awoke slowly the next morning after a rather decent night of sleep. Going to bed on a full stomach did wonders for your sleep, apparently. But as he awoke, smile plastered on his face, he slowly remembered…Potter.
“’Night”. Harry looked up at the moving posters, smiled and turned on his side. He drifted off to sleep that night with a permanent smile on his face.
What could this mean? If his father had sources at Hogwarts, then who knows what he was capable of achieving from Azkaban.
“I’m here for my son, Draco.” The woman replied back.
He didn’t appreciate the tone in Harry’s voice, “Yes? Sorry if it isn’t up to your standards Potter. But as I said before, you can be going.” Draco made his way inside and slammed the door before Harry could get in. He heard the man curse under his breath, then heard the familiar
“Narcissa!” Lucius hissed out the name before he was met with a hard look from his wife.
The day was winding down and night was quickly approaching. For a moment he wondered why Harry would choose to come now, but that thought soon fled when the man approached him.
After talking for what felt like forever, he stopped and looked at her. She paused as if to take in all of the information then asked a question Draco was hoping she would bypass, “Draco. Why did you father think you and Harry were in a relationship before…?”
Draco looked over at Harry in horror, “We
to say. “Draco, I want us to write to each other this summer. I know we said there were complications and I know we aren’t ready to tell our fathers, but I don’t think I can go a whole summer without hearing from you.”
“My father happened, Harry. He found your letters…I had been keeping all of the letters you wrote me from the first month. I wanted to be able to go back and read them…but that was foolish. I should have been smarter about it.” Harry watched Draco’s face fall before he continued.
They were all met with quite a scene. Blaise was yelling and throwing hexes at Draco, who was attempting to speak but was too busy putting up protection spells for himself.
promised to give me. And that was taken from me!” Astoria’s voice grew and she quickly looked around before lowering it again. “But now…I have that. And I intend to give it to my son as well.”
Harry noticed the shift in atmosphere in the room. Their tones had shifted from aggression and annoyance to…pity and understanding. Their body language no longer screamed ‘defensive’, but now they both somehow looked more open. And it honestly looked like Astoria was thinking about what he had said.
If his eyes had been open, he would have noticed his mother entering the room with a tray of desserts, followed closely by the rest of his family. Harry would have never known they had an audience if it wasn’t for his godfather’s whistling. Harry would be having a conversation with Sirius later.
“Oh – right…” Was all Harry responded with and the two went quiet again.
“Harry, we have to talk about this.” Charlie said with hesitation and trying to compose himself. He hated to stop what was happening but knew this was going to need to be discussed.
He didn’t realize exactly
Harry opened and closed his mouth several times, unsure of what to say.
As soon as he stepped on the train, he searched for Draco but couldn’t find him anywhere. When students began to walk into Hogwarts, Harry looked around for that familiar blonde head. He spotted Draco far off in the distance talking with Crabbe and Goyle. Harry ran up to him, but as soon as Draco saw him Draco looked away and walked off. Harry stood in front of the castle confused.
Harry flipped around and saw Oliver with his head in his hands and moving towards a bench to sit down. “No Harry. I’m sorry. This isn’t how this is starting. I can’t just

“You don’t have a house elf?” Draco asked as he took a sip of his drink before returning the glass to the table.
Harry followed suit, still laughing and still annoying the shit out of Draco.
The two discussed various topics while drinking glass after glass of whisky. They were typically light-hearted mixed with funny stories of their days of Hogwarts (never anything
Draco’s face was cold. “What did you expect to happen Harry? I’m a pureblood. I’m the Malfoy heir. I
Draco glared at Harry while answer, “Riding horses is difficult Potter! It isn’t just, get up on it and go! They can be…temperamental!” At this point, Harry was full-on laughing his ass off. Draco, annoyed, continued to gather his tools and stomp away towards the fence.
Harry and Draco continued their meetups in the astronomy tower every night for the next month. Over the course of this month, the rumors and whispers about Harry began to die down for the most part. Once people started to realize they had never actually
“We-we’re friends. You had a difficult morning, I thought you might need to talk.”
No, Ron was right. He needed to learn
Happy Christmas, Draco.
Because he does.
Harry spent the rest of break dodging questions from his parents and godfathers about the man. As perfect as the moment was…his heart still felt as though he cheated. As soon as Oliver left, Harry’s mind went back to Draco.
Draco looked down at the clippers in his hand and shook his head. “Yes? I’m cutting my grass.”
“I was going to tell you when we got back to Hogwarts, but my father started marriage discussions in August before we came back. By then…it was too late. I felt it was best if we just…ended things. Part of me thought about telling you. That’s why I waited for you that day after Quidditch practice, but when I saw how hurt you were…I just couldn’t add to that. I knew it was best for you if we just dropped it. Let you move on…and you did.”
Lunch went by rather quickly. Conversation flowed smoothly, thankfully. But Harry was all too happy to leave the table.
On the Monday of his third week into term, a mound of brown hair pulled out a chair at his table at the back of the library and sat down. She opened up her books and began to study.
Draco tried very hard to not bite back but had had so little interaction with others that he just couldn’t help himself. “And I wonder how on earth you two managed to convince McGonagall to room you together.” Draco hoped it sounded cheeky and not mean – but he never really did learn the difference.
Harry still managed to arrive to classes, but no one ever saw him getting
Sure Draco. Keep telling yourself that.
“I know you aren’t a death eater anymore. I know you probably never truly were…” Draco rolled his eyes at whatever pity Harry was about to throw at him.
“Oh…I see. And she didn’t like that…?” Draco rolled his eyes before answer.
“Oh – I didn’t even think about it like that…” Draco tried to calm himself down. Harry was ignorant, it wasn’t his fault.
Harry tried to enjoy his time at home, but a large part of him missed Draco. He had to keep reminding himself that it wasn’t a long time to go without someone…especially someone you just started dating. It had only been two months and Harry felt like a lovesick fool.
Harry didn’t know how to answer the question exactly. He knew he wanted more of what just happened but wasn’t sure how much further or more open he was ready to take things. “I-I don’t know. I kind of just want it to be…us for a while.”
No, that didn’t seem right.
“But you are a Malfoy man. A pureblood. You belong to one of the wealthiest and well-respected houses in the pureblood families. Your activities must stop. You are not to act on these…
“I want to hear about all of it. Whatever you want to tell me.” Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco sounded…sad somehow. He knew he was still trying to sound confident and suave, like always – but there was something in the way he spoke that sounded like he just wanted company. So, Harry obliged.
“Daddy! Daddy!” the hug was interrupted by Scorpius and Teddy running into the kitchen. Harry released the man and stood off to the side while Draco wiped tears away from his eyes, “Can Teddy spend the night? Pleaseeeeee.”
“You can close your mouth Potter. I was just as shocked as you were the first time Scorpius came home from a sleep over and started talking about ‘Harry Potter The-Boy-Who-Lived’. His grandmother and I had a discussion, but it appears she has not stopped.”
Harry paused. When he thought back on it, two things really upset and scared him in that moment. “The word they called my Sirius and Remus…it’s a bad word, a really hurtful word. That caused me to get really upset. But I also can’t stop thinking about what happened with my magic…dad, I didn’t even say a spell. I don’t even think I was going to cast one! It just came out of nowhere!”
drunk he had allowed himself to get until it was too late. George had decided it would be a good idea to give toasts “to the man who is leaving to sleep with his dragons!”. Seamus and Dean went first, each giving some variation of “I don’t know you too well, mate. But I’m happy for you and I hope you never meet our girlfriends…I don’t think they would be ours for much longer.” Charlie gave a half-smile and glanced over at Harry.
Before he knew it, he was out of his seat. If it wasn’t time for their first class, Harry would have looked ridiculous getting up the way he did. But everyone in the Great Hall was getting ready to transition to their first class so Harry had to fight through what felt like a mountain of first years to get to Draco.
“It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.” Harry was worried Draco would freeze up.
“I like you too.” Draco let out and let the words hang in the air.
Oliver walked with Harry as he continued down to the pitch. Harry tried to let out a laugh, “Right… Um…So, I didn’t know you’d be coming back. Must be weird being here…especially after you thought you’d gotten out.”
He wasn’t prepared to open the door and find the star of his very recent fantasy standing in his doorway, wearing no shirt and looking very disoriented.
Draco mirrored his tone, “I- I don’t know if I can…”
house?” Harry couldn’t help but notice the way Charlie stood
He would drop Teddy off with Rose and let them play while he could have his grown-up time with his two best friends. Completely Draco free.
what Draco always hoped for…
have a problem with gay people…”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He moved towards the table and sat opposite the man. “Oh…”.
Harry continued the kiss and followed Draco as Draco moved Harry on his back. The two continued in this position until Harry pulled back and looked at Draco – taking him in. “Draco…I think I’m ready”.
Draco decided to stay silent and wait for Harry to speak. He watched the broken man stare at his glass of water until he eventually looked up at Draco like he had just realized he was sitting there.
“Me? Come to the Burrow? On Christmas day?”
Harry went to bed that night still thinking of Draco. The more he fought the thoughts, the harder they pushed until he finally gave in and replayed the scene at the shop again in his head. It was during this replay that he noticed Draco was wearing muggle clothes, tight jeans and a tight black shirt that cut off at his bicep. Draco looked…good.
While he waited, Draco decided to sit next to Hermione – a safe bet. Just as he sat, George moved away from his spot near the fire and looked directly at Draco. “So, Malfoy, I hear you’re quite smitten with our young Potter. You know, he was once with a Weasley man…that’s a lot to live up to.” George threw a wink at Charlie who seemed to be sitting awkwardly in an armchair on the other side of the room.
It took a while for Molly to
“Oh… I, I see. Well, that makes sense, we’ve been hanging out a lot. He’s probably just jealous.” Harry attempted a laugh. “There’s nothing for him to worry about, right?”
Harry tried to concentrate on his first practice of the year, but his mind kept alternating between Draco’s sudden dismissiveness and Oliver’s sudden…presence. Harry was exhausted after only going at it for an hour and decided to call it for the day. The rest of his team looked just as relieved as him – the first day of classes was difficult for everyone it seemed.
Draco just sat there and kept listening, intently. He never made comments other than the occasional grunt of acknowledgement or “right, uh-huh”. When Harry got to the part about Dean and the kiss, Draco shifted. He looked uncomfortable. When Harry told him what Dean did after, Draco looked puzzled. “Wait. He…turned you down. For the Weasley girl?”
was a much more suitable name for a muggle apparently. But unless he is in town for supplies, they leave him alone.
“He’s not a professor, he’s an apprentice. And Ron is just being…annoying.” Harry was annoyed that
Draco pulled back to where his forehead was resting against Harry’s – both of them had their eyes closed. “I love you Harry Potter.”
Draco debated with himself for what felt like several minutes. No one had been in his house, and now here Harry was, trying to stay over? What was he playing at? Was he going to kidnap Draco in the middle of the night?
The date continued this way through dinner, drinks, and dessert. Before they knew it, the check had come and gone, and they were getting ready to leave. Except it looked like neither of them wanted to…
“Potter. Say what you’re trying to say.” Draco could hear the frustration in his voice and didn’t care. Either Harry needed to say what he needed to say, or he needed to leave.
“Merlin, Potter. I’m going to be sick.”
Draco had no words to witnessing a nearly nude Harry Potter walking into his kitchen.
But maybe a relationship with Draco wouldn’t be so bad…
Hermione and Ron gave Harry a confused look. “Then if you’re not with Oliver, mate, what’s going on?”
The two finished up their meal, paid, and started to head towards the door. Harry turned to look at Draco only to find Draco already looking at him.
“Of course dear! Go on up to bed! I’ll send Hermione up in a bit to check on you.” Hermione shot Harry an empathetic yet knowing look. One that said, “I know you’re not sick, but that’s okay…”. Harry made a mental note to not be alone with Hermione anytime soon.
