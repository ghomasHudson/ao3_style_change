“You know, not many people know it—" said Parvati, pausing dramatically, “—but I’m actually a bit of a
Years ago, at Mrs. Figg's house one lonely summer while the Dursleys were on holiday, Harry had seen a man on television melt a block of steel into a puddle. Staring into Malfoy's eyes, Harry thought he could see that very pool now—silvery, molten, and bright.
But despite reason, despite the evidence, Harry couldn’t help feeling that Roman was capable of murder and more.
He grabbed a bottle of chestnut extract and left the closet, ignoring the sensation of a bird taking flight in his chest.
And strangely, though Harry hadn’t felt the truth of his words while he was saying them, he suddenly felt warmth bubble in his stomach, like a glug of good butterbeer.
After classes that day, Harry found himself, as usual, in the library. Without Quidditch, the near-constant barrage of schoolwork and impending N.E.W.T. doom had turned the eighth years (Harry, Ron, and Hermione included) somewhat into recluses. Not that he would ever admit it, but Harry welcomed the distraction. And except for Potions, his marks seemed grateful for it.
"Not much, but the copper will oxidize and lighten the shade of the potion, which will make it easier for you to make value judgments."
Harry stared at her. Suddenly, a laugh leapt from him, short and unexpected. “Never mind, Luna,” he said, grinning, “...never mind.”
Her face was naked and sunken, robbed of its former beauty. When she smiled, it looked grotesque—as if the edges of her mouth had been tugged up by an invisible puppeteer.
For a split-second, Harry had the urge to throw his cloak over Malfoy as well—but the thought of Malfoy so close, pressed up against him, was paralyzing…
Inside, the eighth years were in their usual state of disarray: Neville was in the middle of a heated argument with Dean, Seamus was chatting up a poor sixth year girl, and Parvati was, as usual, talking someone’s ear off. Harry found Hermione curled up on the windowsill, reading a newspaper. A look of concentration was etched onto her face. Below her, Ron shuffled a deck of cards.
With a nimble leap, the kneazle landed on the flagstones in front of Harry. Crookshanks's mewling grew louder.
"What do you want, Potter?" said Malfoy, wary at once, though he didn't seem surprised to see Harry. Perhaps it was because he'd seen Ginny leave nearly in tears.
At once, sea-foam green bubbles poured from it. They jitter-bugged across the water's surface. Harry held his breath, then sunk into the bath. As soon as the top of his head breached the surface again, he felt the room shift, then right itself.
And yet, when the cloaked man rounded the corner, Harry had the curious feeling that the man knew exactly where he was.
Surreptitiously, Harry slid the envelope into his bag and left the table. He walked out of the Great Hall, then turned the corner out of the Entrance Hall into an empty corridor.
, thought Harry quickly. The fibers closest to him began to glow orange. They spread across the web, catching like lighter fluid.
Harry's pot of ink was running dry. He bent down, rifling through his schoolbag for a spare, and felt something fall out of his pocket. He reached for it, but he was too slow: Malfoy trapped it underneath a glossy dragonleather shoe.
Nine o’clock came reluctantly that night. When Harry arrived at the dungeons, he found Boughbranch at her desk. Two cauldrons sat on adjacent tables in front of her.
The hour and a half that followed was much of the same. Boughbranch would arrive now and then, dispense advice, and retreat to her study. But there was one event that stood out above the rest.
When Harry, Hermione, and Ron climbed through the portrait hole, they were met with a peculiar sight. The room was largely empty, as was to be expected on a Hogsmeade night, save for a huddle of first and second years and two familiar people: Neville and Luna. Luna was sitting at Neville's feet, and she appeared to be tying what looked like wreaths of fresh cranberries around his ankles.
He hurried after Ginny through the Hogsmeade gates. When he caught up to her, she linked her arm through his and smiled.
But Harry wasn't so sure. Professor Roman, gaunt, pale, and still smiling widely, seemed too bloodthirsty to be wholly human.
Harry thought wildly. Malfoy, who had just emerged through the smoke, coughing violently, stopped dead in his advance.
The classroom was tumultuous again as students brushed off, pulled each other to their feet, and returned to their desks. Harry settled into his chair and opened his bag.
thought Harry, grinning. Immediately, as if by an invisible string, Malfoy was flipped upside down and hoisted in the air by his ankle.
These were the thoughts currently dominating Harry's mind while in Herbology. He was too preoccupied to even notice that the Flower of Quetzalcoatl he was meant to be tending had suctioned to his thumb and was gurgling happily.
Malfoy was lounging at a desk, long legs stretched across three chairs shoved together. Dread settled in Harry's stomach: Malfoy was thumbing through a garish pink magazine.
Harry had no use for either. He wrapped Malfoy's wand in some newspaper and returned the other to his trunk.
"Knight to 5D," said Ron. His knight decapitated Harry’s king in one fell swoop. Ron eyed it moodily.
With a start, Harry realized that was how he’d felt all those nights in Classroom No. 10, in silent study beside Draco Malfoy.
Voldemort had scarcely entrusted the knowledge of his Horcruxes to his Death Eaters; certainly, Malfoy knew nothing of them. He and the rest of the wizarding world were forced to believe one thing: Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and it was simply some esoteric force inherent in him that had finally conquered You-Know-Who once and for all.
Harry held his breath. He wondered if they could hear the pounding of his heart; it nearly broke his chest. An excruciating silence passed.
Ron sat at his desk, chewing the end of his quill and staring at his answers.  Hermione was asking Flitwick a question.
Or Harry slicing Malfoy open, seeing him bleed out, his blood swirling on wet tile; Harry watching Malfoy point his wand at Dumbledore, then faltering; Harry rushing into the Fiendfyre, pulling Malfoy out of the scorching flames that licked at their ankles.
Luna had materialized at Hermione’s shoulder. Hermione, wincing at her trodden foot, shot Harry a grateful glance.
Gone were the trinkets and silver toys; the office was clean and bare, save for the paintings decorating the perimeter of the room. Harry’s gaze was drawn to the frame hung above the simple wooden desk: Albus Dumbledore snoozed quietly, half-moon spectacles dangling from his nose. Harry felt a pang.
On Thursday night, the gentle pitter-patter of rain fell like scurrying mouse feet upon Gryffindor Tower. The gold clock above the mantelpiece read half-past midnight.
An impressive four minutes later, pink and short of breath, he arrived at the dungeons. On the board, Boughbranch had written the instructions for a hair-restoring potion, along with a note that she would be by periodically to check on their progress.
But then Splog stopped, because next to Harry, Malfoy raised his hand. It was an unusual sight: Malfoy usually spent Transfiguration staring into space or doodling on spare parchment.
McGonagall set the parchments down and joined him. Placing on spectacles, she pulled the nearest parchment from the top. She scanned it briefly before setting it down.
, thought Harry at once. The violet bolt of light rebounded on Malfoy, who leapt nimbly to the side.
Harry did. He didn’t want Ron to see it; he didn’t want anyone to see it. But it wasn’t like he could say that. Harry shrugged.
It had been a strange comment, thought Harry. Malfoy knew very well that Harry could do a Vanishing spell, as the Eighth Years had practiced it in Transfiguration just that day.
"She's in the pipes," Harry muttered. He squinted suspiciously at the largest faucet, expecting at any minute that Moaning Myrtle would come swooping out of it.
As they watched Hagrid lumber away, leaving giant boot prints in the snow, Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty.
In the center of the room lay a vast tub the size of a small swimming pool. Decorating its perimeter were faucets of all shapes, gold and silver and shimmering.
From the tip of Harry's wand poured serpents, slick and silver. Hissing, they shot towards Malfoy, coiling around his legs, wrapping around his wrists.
Through November, he continued to meet Malfoy in that damp dungeon classroom. They’d duel; Harry would win, Malfoy would insult him, and then they’d duel again. In between shooting jets of fire and blasting desks apart, they’d slump on the ground, catch their breaths, and Harry would ask Malfoy about the four uses of buttercups or the ingredients of a Forgetfulness Potion. Rolling his eyes, Malfoy would oblige.
When he arrived, he was met with an unpleasant sight: Draco Malfoy sulked from his desk. Dismay filled Harry. But Malfoy didn’t look the least bit surprised.
Ever so slightly, Malfoy smiled. Harry's gaze dropped to his mouth. Red bloomed on Malfoy's lower lip, dark and wet.
"You’re not worth it, Malfoy," he grunted. He grabbed his schoolbag, turned heel, and stalked out of the dungeons.
and he and Malfoy were engulfed in a bubble-gum pink concoction that immediately smarted and sizzled. At once, Professor Boughbranch doused them off in an icy jet of water. They were left shivering, soaked, and thoroughly embarrassed.
is made of conspiracy theorists and crackpot old journalists who couldn’t get a job writing in their village bird-watching column. It’s written with
Splog looked momentarily surprised. Then he said smoothly, “True, very true. Ten points to Slytherin...and we will begin exploring this very contradiction now, if you will kindly turn to Chapter Six…”
Ash from the magazine Harry had burned out of Malfoy’s hand. Ash on Malfoy’s fingertips. Fingertips on his face, drawing him closer...
“Yes, yes, come in, come in,” said Professor Splog genially. He winked at Ron and patted his gelatinous stomach.
When they arrived, they found Peeves crouching on the flagstones above the Great Hall’s entrance. He stuck his tongue out at them as they entered.
Luna beamed. “I really worked hard on that article. Daddy finally let me publish under my own name, you see! He says I’m finally good enough for the front page. Of course, I don’t think I’ll be working for the magazine full time, since research into Moon Frogs really isn’t making the strides it should be…”
” hissed Malfoy. But it was too late: an animal-shaped streak of black shot out from between his legs and headed straight for the door.
"I don't think Malfoy would try to kill someone," said Harry slowly. "Not now, not without Voldemort over his shoulder. Unless…"
"Well, it can be. Certain strains of it are toxic. That's why it's used in minor quantities in the Draught of Peace," she explained. "We worked with it in fifth year. Should be in chapter eight of your Potions book."
"Whenever, mate," Ron agreed, though he still seemed perturbed by Harry's news. Absentmindedly, he brushed one of Hermione's stray curls behind her ear.
“Well, when you see people as they are, nothing they do surprises you,” said Malfoy simply, “ or disappoints you.”
Harry wrenched away. He took a deep, staggering breath. For a moment, fear flickered in Malfoy’s eyes, barely discernable—but then Harry shoved him into the opposite wall, and Malfoy’s eyes turned to black.
"Well, Goyle wants to kill me now that his father's got life in Azkaban, Pansy left me to marry her Swedish plank of a cousin, and Zabini's a conceited prick. Oh, and Crabbe got
A loud sound tore from Harry’s mouth. He crumbled; his insides turned to silk, rippling with pleasure.
Breathing hard, Harry put out the fire before it spread to the wooden desks and chairs. Then he popped Malfoy, who, for the third time that evening, collapsed heavily onto the floor.
“Get off,” Harry said irritably, shoving him away. The cloak slid off the two, and Harry picked it up.
At last, he said lamely, “I don’t think really you’re a coward, Malfoy, not anymore.” Malfoy raised a sceptical eyebrow, and Harry amended, “Well. You could’ve made better choices. You could have cared about something beyond yourself.”
He flushed deeply, understanding what Malfoy had seen; he could scarcely think from the embarrassment.
Scowling, Malfoy pulled his shirt back down. Harry watched the trail of hair disappear underneath his trousers.
usually about things Harry was fine never talking about. Harry found the whole thing highly uncomfortable and entirely unnecessary.
know what the case could be—” he continued, undeterred by Malfoy’s sharp look, “—but it doesn’t explain why
Something unfurled in Harry, bloodred and reckless. In that instant, all reason fled in utter abandon. Harry lunged across the desk.
"Are you sure?" he asked. Anxiety snaked through his belly. "It's alright if you've changed your mind."
Harry felt a sense of loss as Ginny jogged back to her team. But, to be honest, he didn't know what he'd planned to ask her anyway.
“Today we shall be leaving behind elemental reactions and beginning—shall we say—a branch of corporeal transfigurations,” said Splog, reclining in a pose of ultimate relaxation. “Let us see who did the reading...who can define for me Bertrand’s Law?”
He pushed aside his robes and slid up his shirt. Against the hard expanse of pale skin, a violet bruise blossomed. As Harry watched, the edges of the bruise faded into ugly yellow.
It was bewildering to experience not one, but two expressions of Malfoy's kindness within the hour. It must have shown on Harry's face, because then Malfoy said, with a shifting, grim look, "The Carrows were the worst, after Him. Murderous animals."
“It’s faulty,” repeated Malfoy, frowning at the deep crack. The snitch’s gauzy wings fluttered tiredly. “Supposed hero of the wizarding world and can’t even afford a proper snitch. Why’s that?”
"My Dudders, on the other hand," he continued proudly. "Bound to wrestle one day. Built like an ox, he is."
"It's true, Petunia!" declared Vernon, turning even ruddier. "I've always known, even when he was a little grub. That boy's grown up to be a pillow-biter if I've ever seen one.
He returned to the dormitory, undressed, and crawled underneath his covers. His face was still sore, and all he wanted was sleep.
Malfoy drawled, leisurely flicking through the pages. “‘Most Charming Smile Award.’ Impressive, Potter. That should go on your chocolate frog card.”
For the umpteenth time in nearly five weeks, Harry had lied to Ron and Hermione. He'd needed an explanation for his disappearances, and it was easier to pretend that he was still behind in Remedial Potions than to explain that he was secretly dueling Draco Malfoy. But each time, shame writhed in his stomach; this, along with mounting trepidation, accompanied him as he climbed down to the dungeons.
"Oh, by the way, Harry," said Hermione as if she had just realized something, “why isn’t Ginny with you?"
Logically, Harry knew that a ghost could do him no harm—even if that ghost had been a vengeful, deranged murderer. But under the Bloody Baron's gaze, Harry began to regret his life choices that had brought him to this moment. If he hadn't said anything, the Baron would have floated right past him; if he hadn't gotten high, he'd never have come across it in the first place. The fault lay, Harry decided, with Draco Malfoy.
Blinking away tears, Harry tried again. This time, he breathed in, quickly removed his mouth, and breathed out. Smoke fluttered from his lips like a sigh, leaving behind a faint burn of candied cinnamon.
Malfoy’s face tightened, rigid with anger. In the dim light of the dungeons, it looked like it was carved from the shadows.
Harry raised his gaze to Malfoy's eyes: he saw something like victory flash there. But there was nothing to be victorious about, because
Besides the scowl twisting his face, Malfoy seemed healthy. Beneath bare, flushed shoulders peeked the top of white bandages.
He caught his breath. Then he tapped his wand on the spot where Malfoy used to be. Shimmering, Malfoy materialized. He was scowling, but Harry detected fading panic in his eyes.
But to Harry’s surprise, a grin broke across Malfoy’s face. He chuckled, all white teeth and crinkled eyes, and something lurched in Harry’s stomach.
"Today," he said smoothly, eyes glittering, “we duel. No spoken spells. Otherwise—there are no rules."
had direction. Ginny had announced that summer she was going to play for the Harpies, and Harry didn't doubt it for a minute. Hermione knew what she wanted too. She was headed for the Ministry, blazing with purpose to rid the world of house elf injustice or "blood purity" ideology, or both. Even Ron had decided on Aurorship.
"So…" Harry said conversationally, tapping his quill again. This time, Malfoy took no notice. "You really don't know what you want to do?"
Malfoy's expression gradually eased. He shook his head, then let out a strange little derisive laugh. It broke off quickly, awkward in the silence.
"So, let me get this straight," whispered Malfoy, eyes bright, "You won't tell anyone…because you're
Malfoy’s eyes slid to Harry’s. Then he looked away. Harry watched him—the line of his jaw, his throat, his collarbone.
behind them. Harry and Hermione took their usual seats along the front of the classroom. Ron, just returning from McGonagall's office, joined them. He looked pleased about something.
“What’s happened?” yawned Ron. “And why are you looking at Harry like he’s told you he thinks McGonagall’s fit?”
"And Malfoy blowing up Roman's desk," chortled Ron. “To be honest, I didn’t know the prick could duel like that.”
problem, Potter. You're fast, but you make mistakes. And you make the same ones over and over again."
Looking disappointed, the gargoyles split aside. Harry stepped into the empty space between them and was spun upwards in a golden spiral into the office.
Feeling like an idiot, Harry placed his hands on the table. Parvati clasped them between her own, wheatish and smooth.
Repelled by an unseen force, the ropes Malfoy’s spell had conjured threw themselves back at him. He darted to the side, but a tendril wound its way around his forearm. Malfoy vanished it with a jab of his wand.
Harry shrugged again. After the Battle, the Ministry had retrieved the snitch from the Forbidden Forest. Harry had accepted it with reluctance. At least the stone that had been inside it was forever hidden, unremarkable on the forest floor, just as he’d intended.
Something about Malfoy’s words felt strangely personal. Harry wasn’t sure what to say. Malfoy examined his fingers.
Malfoy was frowning. He looked like he did when he was puzzling over a particularly challenging essay. “You ask if the Man ever had a chance. A chance for what? Change? Redemption? We would assume that if he had choices, then perhaps he had a chance. But what were his options?”
As of late, Classroom No. 10 had come to serve as their informal study hall. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement. Harry got to avoid Ron’s questions, Hermione’s insinuations, and strangers’ incessant stares. And Malfoy had someone to insult a few hours a week. It probably should have struck Harry as strange, but it was no stranger than what they were doing already. In any case, he didn’t see the point of thinking about it too much. It seemed to work for now (as long as “Remedial Potions” served as an excuse, anyway).
Panic flared on Malfoy’s face. Undoubtedly, he’d be in more trouble than Harry if he were caught lurking around after hours.
But the ghost that turned to face him wasn't Myrtle. Gaunt-faced, with horrible, blank staring eyes and robes spattered with blood—was the Bloody Baron.
At once, Harry was hyper-aware of every sensation in his body, from the cold-born goosebumps sprouting on his arms to the pain nibbling his cheekbone.
Malfoy cast him a sidelong glance. “Well, I’m the one who brewed it, aren’t I? It’s not really nicking then.”
The incident with the Bloody Baron came back to him, clearer than any dream. Had he fallen asleep after it or before? Deathly cold, Harry shuddered and dressed quickly.
Wordlessly, he held out the Firebolt. Smirking, Malfoy took it (Harry winced) and offered his own broom.
ridiculous, but it’s right about one thing. No one’s seen her. She’s…” Harry licked his lips again. “…in the country, right? ”
It didn't matter, thought Harry, fingering the parchment. She wouldn’t be able to figure it out. Harry barely believed it himself.
Malfoy whipped out his wand, but it was too late. Peeves flipped upright and cried, “STUDENT OUT OF BED! STUDENT OUT OF BED IN THE DUNGEONS!”
They'd been working in silence for nearly an hour, but while Harry rooted through the cupboards, Malfoy said suddenly, gaze fixed above Harry's head:
In the dungeons, Classroom No. 10 had shifted slightly. It was now four doors down, so Harry turned three wrong doorknobs before finding the right one. Finally, he entered the classroom, locked it, and cast a Silencing charm.
Harry shook his head, sure he must have misheard her. But then a door opened: inside lay a dazzling, high-vaulted chamber of pristine white marble.
Malfoy pulled up his shirt. His stomach—the inches Harry could see—was pale and hard. Red scratches crisscrossed across the skin. Below it was Malfoy’s navel, followed by a trail of dark blond hair.
“You heard Boughbranch. I’m not coming back here,” said Malfoy, “and your half-wit arse needs all the help it can get.”
"Why would Harry be with Professor Boughbranch?" questioned Hermione at once. "Harry, you haven't got detention
He hit Malfoy with an Immobulus Charm. But the second before Malfoy froze, a flash of light, like a darting flame, shot from his wand. It pierced Harry's left trainer as he leapt aside.
From the depths of his trunk shot out a grubby velvet pouch. Grimacing, Harry shook off a chocolate frog wrapper. Inside the pouch were two wands: one of blackthorn, which the Ministry had recovered from Malfoy Manor, and one of hawthorn. Malfoy's wand.
Harry felt Malfoy’s glare. As forgiving as Splog seemed, he doubted Malfoy would have been given the same treatment.
“Which is excellent,” she continued, “because I’ve decided you’ll be joining me for Remedial Potions for the foreseeable future.”
And with a flick of his wand, the sachet transformed into a glass pipe. Malfoy lit a small flame underneath it. Then he closed his mouth around the pipe, inhaled, and breathed out. Smoke curled from his lips, the same color as the flames on the walls. Or maybe the smoke had no color at all, and it was only the torchlight painting the whole classroom faintly golden.
, Potter,” he whispered. His robes whipped around him; his wand arm trembled. Harry, too, felt himself slide forward. He just needed Malfoy to—
But when Harry arrived, Hagrid was nowhere to be found. Instead, he found Luna and, for some strange reason, Parvati Patil on their knees in Hagrid's vegetable patch.
“Not to mention,” continued McGonagall gently, “that despite your great accomplishments as a wizard, Potter, you are still lacking formal higher education. Now, occasionally we hire based on career experience...however, seeing as you are still a student…”
Narcissa Malfoy sat on the matching sofa, looking nothing like the woman he'd seen earlier that night. Her lip had its signature sneer, and her lustrous locks were elegantly pinned. She had glinting blue eyes, and she wore red lipstick.
That night, Remedial Potions took place. When Harry entered, he found Boughbranch and Malfoy in deep conversation.
Harry’s anger mounted. Mercilessly, he continued, “You would be. But still all you do is mock everyone. Make jokes at their grief. You deserve
"Never mind," said Neville, flushing, before Luna could respond. "Aren't you meant to be with Boughbranch?"
Professor Sprout, looking on critically, said, “If these don't help your pest problem, nothing will.” When she saw the three, she tapped her watch pointedly and headed for Greenhouse Four.
Harry’s bruised eye was fading, yellow at the edges, but it still hurt to touch. He shot Malfoy a disgusted look.
conjecture, and probably a boatload of hallucinogenic drugs. It’s what reality shows like Britain’s Got Talent are to
And here he was now, watching Ginny turn circles from the bleachers and brooding over a certain Slytherin.
“Fine,” he said, trying to be conciliatory, “tell me something then. How did you, someone who—and don’t get offended, Potter, I’m only being realistic here—is utterly mediocre in every way, end up defeating the Dark Lord?”
Malfoy was just playing with him, Harry decided. He hadn't even been in class that day. Logically, Harry knew it was because Malfoy treated house points like chump change, but he couldn't help fixating on Malfoy’s absence like he did his other strange behaviors. He felt pathetic for giving the whole thing so much thought. He should've gagged at the letter, scoffed at it with Ron, and tossed it in the rubbish.
Harry paused. He could beg Hermione—but it was getting increasingly difficult to be around her and Ron nowadays. And he had a strange unwillingness to leave quite yet; unlike the common room, the classroom was quiet. Even Malfoy's company had been...somewhat pleasant. No, that was too generous. It had been tolerable.
“Women aren’t birds,” she said automatically. “...And it is, essentially.” She blushed. “Harry, you still haven’t said anything.”
Indeed, the kneazle was inching towards Harry, its black ears pressed flat against its head. Suddenly, a loud
Malfoy sighed. With a tenderness that Harry didn't know he was capable of, Malfoy brushed Narcissa's greying hair out of her face.
Harry raised his chin. He refused to lower his gaze, even as Malfoy stepped toward him—stepped too close.
It was a secret; that much was obvious. Harry had more to lose than Malfoy did. He knew that. But he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
"Bloody git," cursed Harry, checking his watch. He tore up the stairs to retrieve his bag, then hurried out of the portrait hole before anyone could say anything else to embarrass him.
"Far left…" he muttered. With difficulty, because his fingers felt like dangling egg noodles, he turned the tap.
It took extraordinary force of will not glance up at Draco Malfoy, to only shove those words into his bag, to just pretend that he hadn’t seen them. But his pounding heart didn’t listen.
His heart stopped the moment the envelope was dropped into his lap. At once, he glanced around: Hermione was giggling over
The envelope was of uncommonly fine stationery, ebony and sealed with a dark blue wax peacock. It contained no name—only the words '
He surveyed his surroundings. Ron was spooning baked beans onto his plate with gusto. Hermione and Ginny looked to be in deep discussion, likely at the current state of Harry's right eye.
Harry was flummoxed by the sudden turn the conversation had taken. “Don’t talk about things you have no idea about, Malfoy.”
Harry watched his retreating back. Annoyance crept up on him. He realized that Malfoy didn't believe Harry would ever tell McGonagall—and, Harry admitted, he was probably right. It wasn't really his business, after all.
in Azkaban. But by acting as an informant, he got away with just ten years. If his murderer isn’t a Death Eater—who else would want him dead?”
When he returned, Boughbranch was examining a file instead of retreating to her office like she usually did. Harry thought he knew the reason why.
"Vampires aren't allowed wands, Ron. Not to mention Professor McGonagall wouldn't let a vampire teach students," hissed Hermione.
muggles, Potter," said Malfoy matter-of-factly. "As a species, sure. They're stupid and small-minded. But maybe the one percent of individuals are an exception. Rare ones, mind you."
The next morning, Harry’s face, windburned, glared back at him from the bathroom mirror. He touched his cheek tentatively and winced.
Harry’s watch read five minutes to midnight. He didn’t have time to consider if this was wise. He hastened down Gryffindor tower, crept out of the castle, and climbed up the hill overlooking the Black Lake.
The class was in disarray. Hermione was breathing heavily, her bushy hair standing upright as if she'd been electrocuted, and Luna had been Stunned, a dreamy expression glazing her face. By the look of him, Seamus had received the brunt of Malfoy's blast of fire.
The second eyebrow joined the first. Then Malfoy’s brow smoothed. Cool amusement glinted his eyes. “Realize what?”
He crossed the room and opened the door. The kneazle, which had been mewling softly, shot out without a backward glance.
Harry found his seat. Homeworks were being passed to the front of the room. He busied himself by making a show of opening his textbook and examining its contents. Determined to avoid Splog’s eye, he didn’t notice until too late that Draco Malfoy had taken the seat just to the right of him.
“This stain will never come off me,” said Malfoy. His voice was so low, Harry strained to hear it over the fire’s crackling. “I’ll always be branded as a Death Eater.”
“Shit,” muttered Harry. Fumbling through his bag, he pulled out his invisibility cloak (ignoring how his fingers shook) and pulled it over himself.
he doing here, in a freezing dungeon classroom with Draco Malfoy, when he could be drinking smuggled Firewhisky and playing Wizard's Chess next to a crackling fire?
But instead, a small crease appeared on Malfoy’s brow. He looked away, at a point above Harry’s shoulder.
But during Remedial Potions, there was no avoiding him. Luckily, this evening Boughbranch had decided to tutor Harry more closely. As a result, besides the occasional sneer, Malfoy kept to himself.
Finally, the common room was empty. Everyone had gone to bed. But Harry was wide awake—agitated, even.
It was only a matter of time before Malfoy brought up what he’d seen. Harry prepared himself for the embarrassment. Defiant, he lifted his chin, glared into Malfoy’s grey eyes, and waited.
It didn't matter that the dungeon was cold and dark; at times, the lights blinded Harry momentarily, and sweat trickled down his back.
And then he saw it: the firelight had thrown a ray onto the Black Lake, and in the distance was a golden glimmer.
Malfoy scoffed, but his eyes betrayed him. He looked away and ran a hand through his hair, which fell, as always, like silk.
Harry didn’t eat at breakfast the next morning. He’d rehearsed it in his mind: what he’d do when Malfoy showed up, or if Malfoy tried to stop him in the hallway or speak to him in class. But Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.
Malfoy swung his bag over his shoulder. Hands in his pockets, Malfoy bent over Harry's desk. "Want to come with?" he whispered conspiratorially.
Harry willed his heart back to his chest. The initial alarm he’d felt had faded—there was no chance she knew who the note was from—but he felt uncomfortable, as if she were seeing him naked. He itched to grab the parchment from her hands.
At that moment, Harry wondered if it were true that Ginny rarely cried, or if she just didn't like anyone to see it.
name. I suppose when you breed like rodents you run out of ideas. It’s a wonder one of the Weasleys wasn’t put down to save them a few knuts—”
Harry’s stomach was churning. His chicken looked flabby, lifeless. He imagined Ron thudding the dungeon door open, seeing Harry’s hand knotted in Malfoy’s tie, his lips pressed against—
believes your mum killed your dad. And, honestly, it doesn’t matter what people say, about her or about anyone. If you counted the number of things people have about me—of course, you probably started half of them—”
. Pain flaring, he hissed sharply—but then Malfoy’s body was on his own and there was no room to speak, no room to breathe—there was only damp forest and sharp mint and warm lips.
“Seeing your father’s murder all over the papers must be hard,” reasoned Neville. “So, hearing people talk about it all the time must be even worse.”
Harry didn't know which part exactly set him off, but the way Malfoy had been treating him, as if their relationship was
The fading bruise revealed ropy scars, long and thin, as if someone had taken a cruel knife to Malfoy’s abdomen.
And yet, in other ways, nothing had changed—Malfoy was still as uncreative as ever. There was some comfort in that, mused Harry.
Harry wasn’t stupid. He knew what Malfoy was asking of him, and why: Malfoy had no friends, a castle full of people who would be glad to see him gone, and a probation to match. Ron and Hermione would call it Harry’s needing-to-save-people thing. They might have been right. But it didn't change the fact that Harry had the thing.
"All this time," Hermione pressed, "we've been thinking it was an old Death Eater. Someone who resented Lucius Malfoy for informing on them. But what if it was someone at the Ministry? What if it was a guard—an Auror?"
It looked as if that were the answer Malfoy had least expected. He seemed at a loss. At last, he said quietly, “How can you know that?”
Soon their potions were completed and given Boughbranch's nod of approval (Harry's a rather reluctant one). Malfoy strode from the classroom, wasting no time in escaping Boughbranch's discerning looks. Harry finished cleaning and left a few minutes later.
It didn’t make sense. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy the entire day: he hadn’t shown up for meals or classes. So, why would he show now? But Harry had a lurking feeling he might. After all, Thursday was a dueling night.
His girlfriend’s wide eyes shot to Harry’s sweat-slickened forehead, where he was sure his scar gleamed like signpost saying
“Our standards are very high, Potter,” she said at last. “Now, in past years, our Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers have been spotty, but Professor Roman is certainly qualified. So, bar some unforeseeable conflict, no open position exists.”
Harry made a split-second decision. He hurried out the open door and turned sharply down the Charms Corridor.
"I never knew you were so concerned for my future," said Malfoy. "Well, Potter, the last thing I am is jealous of
"Oh, but it has, Harry," said Luna happily. "Neville came with me to return a book I borrowed from Professor Boughbranch...she's very kind, she asked all about Daddy's magazine...and we heard her tell Malfoy you both had Remedial Potions at eight tonight, and for him to tell you
Harry looked up. He met Malfoy's gaze. Then, quite deliberately, he placed his wand to the parchment and burnt it to a crisp.
As she flounced away, Ron sniggered to a tomato-faced Hermione, “Merlin, you don’t pull any punches. And what on Earth’s a Sickle Back, by the way…”
"I only regret harming the mistress," it croaked, though its mouth never moved. "Lesser men wend to far moe wondrous lengths to forbear what they fear than to obtain what they desire."
He shoved Malfoy's chest, firm and hard and much too real under his hands. Malfoy fell back as easily as if he were made of paper. His breath stuttered.
“You should be thanking Fred,” spat Harry. “The Weasleys, too. If it weren’t for them, and everyone else who saved Hogwarts, you’d be rotting in the dirt with your dear father.”
Ron grinned conspiratorially at Harry, wiggling his eyebrows in a way that Harry never cared to see again. “I just assumed it was a steamy note some bird passed Harry. Now,
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Hellebore oil," he explained, “is a tranquilizer. Kneazles are wild animals—they aren't
"Smart touch, that copper is," she nodded. "Potter, you shouldn't have much trouble with this. As I recall, last time you simply switched the order of the powdered petrified eggs and the aloe."
sounded in the corridor. Peeves’s cackling followed, along with the terrified squeals of young girls.
Harry made his way to the corner of the library where the books for lowerclassmen were kept. Under the denomination CMC-SCA, he found what he was looking for:
The flames hissed; the potions bubbled. Boughbranch coughed; she turned a page. Malfoy seemed to be waiting for something.
Harry shrugged, his desire to correct Malfoy vanishing into the starless night...his heart was thrumming; he was high on his win.
It was different. Malfoy was hard where Ginny was soft. Even his lips were rough, pressed against Harry’s. And he was tall—taller than Harry, even, by a couple of inches.
“You did. He may have been just a Death Eater to you, but to me—he was my father,” said Malfoy bitterly. “And Crabbe was my friend.”
A deep shame weighed on him. It wasn’t as though last night was a surprise. Strangely, now that Harry thought about it, it had felt...inevitable.
Harry shut the book and placed it back on the shelf. It didn't tell him anything he didn't already know or, more importantly, mention the hellebore—but Malfoy had
Harry’s gut twisted. Feeling the need to do something with his hands, he ran his fingers through his hair.
“Ah, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. Holding a stack of parchments, she had appeared from behind a tall cupboard. “Have a seat.”
Through their bickering, Harry spotted the newspaper that had slid off Hermione’s lap. It was that morning’s Daily Prophet. On the front page was a photograph of a man with salt-and-pepper hair and a deep-etched scowl, as though he had never felt happy, not even for one day of his life. Above the photograph was the headline:
“Poor you and your dead mum and your dead dad,” mocked Malfoy. “Dead parents can’t die. Our parents made their choices.”
Malfoy lay there, eyebrows raised. Then they lowered. His jaw set. Harry wondered if he'd gone too far. But then Malfoy spoke:
His hair was uncharacteristically tousled, his cheeks pink. He held out his hand. Harry tossed the wand back.
“They’re two of the suspects in the Malfoy case, remember?” said Ron, scribbling. “The two Aurors who guarded Malfoy’s cell the night of the murder. Clive Hawkes, the Head Auror, assigned them.”
The three made their way to Charms. The conversation weighing on him, Harry took his seat. He watched the door for Malfoy.
Then, as Harry began to clean up, she said, "Don't forget, you two, I need that essay on Wolfsbane and Polyjuice potions tomorrow. No exceptions."
Frowning, Harry thought his handwriting was not too bad. He didn't want to think about Malfoy's handwriting in any form, because it reminded him of other things…
"I just wanted to get a rise out of you," he replied. "It wasn't worth it, though. You're awfully dull, Potter, anyone ever tell you that?"
Malfoy had begun to pack up. "Go right ahead," he said neutrally. He raised his hand. "Professor, I'm meant to see the Headmistress at half nine, as she informed you earlier."
“Of course he’s dead, Potter,” he said, watching Harry carefully. “And my mother didn’t kill him either, in case you’re wondering. She’s never killed anyone.”
Harry snuck a glance over and realized he’d forgotten his sandthorns. He went to grab them; Malfoy’s low snort went ignored.
"It's alright," Ginny cut him off. "I guess it was pretty adult of you. I can’t exactly hate you for being honest, can I?"
Not to mention—it was silly and superstitious to rely on the reaction of some strange beast. There were certainly enough existing reasons to be distrustful of Malfoy, and a flighty kneazle wasn't one of them.
“I don’t hate Muggles because I think they’re filthy," said Malfoy. "I hate them because they’d blow us all up in our beds if they had the chance. Their primitive minds couldn’t handle us living alongside them.”
“Wouldn’t be a surprise,” said Harry darkly. His eyes searched the Slytherin table, but a certain blond head was nowhere in sight.
Malfoy decided to attend class the next day. He didn't spare Harry a glance, as if nothing unusual had happened. From Malfoy's perspective, Harry supposed, nothing had; he'd simply meant to mess with Harry's head and then had forgotten all about it.
Thoughtfully, Ron remarked, "It's just as you said, isn't it, Hermione? That day at the lake. You said it could have been Aurors that killed Lucius Malfoy.”
"You wear chains, and you're dead. Surely, you're regretful. But she hasn't forgiven you." He recalled the loathing that twisted the Grey Lady's face as if it were just yesterday. "I'm not completely in control of what I'm saying at the moment," added Harry hastily.
But then her thin chest fluttered, and her dull eyes blinked once, slowly. Looking into her flat gaze, Harry got the impression of a shallow, still pond.
Boughbranch called from the front of the room, "I don't have a problem with your chatting, boys, but I need two flawless potions by the end of the hour."
Ron snorted, itching his nose with his quill. “Give him a break, ‘Mione, you sound like Mum. He’ll tell us soon enough. Won’t you, Harry?”
Again, Harry jerked away, breathing unsteadily. He had to. But Malfoy was merciless. He tugged at the stinging hairs on the nape of Harry’s neck, and, wordlessly, Harry obeyed, baring the column of his throat.
Harry walked over and snatched up the parchment. It looked like a page torn from an old book. The language was archaic, and the contents weren't anything like they’d read in class. But there was one passage that stood out to him, and not just because Malfoy had outlined it in red ink:
Malfoy glared, sullen. "If you're talking about my wand, it's useless anyway. So, thanks for nothing."
quite useless. Oh—I'm being told I should be interviewing a guest! How exciting! How are you doing today, Mr. Curly?"
Relief passed over Harry. “I knew it was ridiculous,” he said. “We know your father’s dead, right? It doesn’t even make sense.”
, Malfoy," he hissed, "is that you think you're better than everyone else. You think you're better because you come from money, and status, and 'pure blood.' You think you're better than me because you read old books on some dusty shelf, and because you think that all I care about is Quidditch. And so
It was unlike Malfoy to waste the opportunity to torture Harry. But Malfoy only worked beside him, occasionally both disparaging and correcting Harry’s potion-making. Harry had long since stopped resisting the help. He wasn't an idiot. Why should he complain if Malfoy was getting him out of Remedial Potions faster?
“I’m back,” she announced unnecessarily. “And guess who else is—Malfoy. I saw him leaving Professor Flitwick’s office.”
Ginny was captain of the Gryffindor team. Eighth years weren’t permitted to compete, much to Harry’s and Ron’s horror over the summer (“You’ll have more time to study for your N.E.W.T.s!” Hermione had said brightly).
Then, abruptly, he stood and shoved his homework into his bag. He crept up to the eighth-year dormitory.
"Aren't they, like, illegal—and dangerous?” continued Harry. “I thought you needed a licence to own one.”
hell," gritted out Harry, clutching the right side of his face. It throbbed like he'd fallen twenty feet from his broom onto it.
He’d thought he hated Malfoy. And yet he let Malfoy shove him against walls, smirk into his ear, bite his collarbone. Each time he thought of what people would
When the ninety minutes were up, Harry poured his potion into a vial and set it on Boughbranch's desk. From this angle, he could see Malfoy back in the store closet. Harry didn't know what else he needed, since his potion looked irritatingly perfect.
With a great clattering, the fire ants all over Harry exploded, transfiguring into showers of peppermint humbugs. The countless candies bounced, scattered, and rolled across the stone floor.
Harry supposed not. He thought for a minute, watching Malfoy's pale face, stubborn and set. Despite Malfoy’s efforts to appear stoic, there was a touch of something vulnerable in his grey eyes.
At last, Harry said, “One day, Malfoy, you’ll lose someone you care about. Maybe then you'll understand."
“You could say my father deserved what he got,” said Malfoy. “Or you could tell me that I deserved worse. I know you think it.”
Damp, hot breath ghosted along it. Boneless, Harry stared at Malfoy. His blond hair lay in damp strands across his brow, and he panted, mouth so swollen and red-rimmed and
At half-past one, nestled in wool carpet, Harry stared dully at his half-finished essay. He was comfortable and warm, and whatever he and Malfoy had smoked earlier, combined with the bath, did nothing to stop his eyelids from drooping once again. He was drifting...
of Pince’s bell, and wanting to run and hide and rip his hair out every time he remembered Malfoy’s scent, Malfoy’s warmth, Malfoy’s lips...
Thankfully, in the weeks that followed, neither Ron nor Hermione pressed the issue. They seemed to be of the mind that Harry would tell them about this mysterious girl in his own time. Of course, Harry never would, because there
Harry chuckled. "I know you'll hate this…but you're more like Hermione than I ever could have thought."
Harry squeezed himself out of the doorway and got to his feet. Carefully, aware of his every footstep, he crept to the living room. Familiar beige carpet scratched his bare feet.
“Fuck,” muttered Malfoy, struggling to extricate himself from between the desk’s legs. He shoved his way out and, stumbling, stood up.
Harry likewise collected his ingredients and left the closet. While powdering his beetles, the suspicion he'd had when seeing Malfoy in the pet shop began to grow.
Ron considered Harry with clouded blue eyes. Then he glanced after Ginny. "I hope you know what you're doing," he said at last.
It was with the same odd flatness that he’d told Bellatrix Lestrange that night at Malfoy Manor, eyes filled with fear, that the Stung boy sitting in front of him might not be Harry Potter.
But despite Harry's trepidation, the morning really was rather pleasant. The sun embraced them through the chill; strangely, it had yet to snow. It was the first Hogsmeade trip of the year, after all, and nothing—Ginny's plot, memories of Death Eaters and Aberforth and Ariana—could quell the cheer in the air.
This time, there was no mistaking Malfoy’s low snigger. Harry's relief at brewing a passable potion dissipated, gone like smoke. Embarrassment replaced it in a hot wave.
Ginny ignored her. To Harry she said, “You can’t go in there looking like that—Hermione will go mental. Let me see it.”
Harry’s heart might have stopped then, but he barely noticed. Malfoy’s eyes were silver stars; his scent, like rich wood, washed over Harry.
Harry's hand shot up to his face: so he was. When he drew his fingers back, they were red and slippery.
“It’s just that,” said Harry firmly, “I’ve been thinking about, potentially—if it’s possible—teaching?”
He pulled the scroll of parchment from his bag and passed to Ron. Hastily, Ron unrolled it, eyes flitting across the page.
He couldn't for the life of him see the angle Malfoy was playing, and that unnerved Harry further—his stomach felt clenched in unease. It didn't help that Harry couldn't ask Ron and Hermione for advice like he always did. It was as if he was hiding a secret he never asked for, one that he wasn't keen to divulge, for a reason he wasn't yet sure of.
“I may be old, but I’m not stupid!” called the Fat Lady, though she could not see Harry. “Students frolicking about, canoodling at all hours—no decency, no
"I hit a table," grumbled Harry, climbing down the staircase. He'd had a terrible night of sleep, and Hermione's questions were grating.
But as it had with the ceiling above his bed, the moment that Harry focused on her she transformed. Narcissa’s hair fell into greying straw; her eyes dulled; her face turned gaunt.
And then there was the issue of last night. Harry had been furious. His mind had been invaded, and that memory…of him and Ginny…
Malfoy examined him as if he were a peculiar creature he had found on a stroll through the woods. Then he reached out and plucked the snitch from Harry’s hand. His fingers grazed Harry’s palm, warm and dry against the night’s chill.
Once again, Boughbranch had written instructions on the blackboard. She sat at her desk, glancing at Harry over her reading spectacles.
Still contemplating the strangeness of that whole interaction, he climbed four flights of stairs to the library. But when he arrived, he saw that Ron and Hermione were, yet again, nowhere to be found.
He couldn't tell if the words were coming from him or someone else. His chest hurt with the ferocity of his battering heart; he was hot and cold and numb and
Malfoy’s smile dimmed. He looked away. He ran a hand through his hair, then seemed annoyed how it fell around his face.
Through the haze, Malfoy raised his wand—and Harry's ears filled with a piercing cry, one long, shrill note that drove any thoughts of spellcasting from his mind.
At the foot of the large armchair by the fire sat Harry and Ron, staring blearily at their half-finished Potions essays. Classes had been unrelenting, but the warm fire and red wool were cozy, and the two were fast becoming lulled into a stupor.
“It wasn’t just that,” Harry said slowly. “I faced him before then, you know…and yeah, I was lucky, and I had lots of help, and I still don’t exactly understand whatever prophecy was made about us—but I fought him, and won,” finished Harry plainly. “More than once.”
Carefully, Harry stood up. It seemed that Malfoy had pushed him, and he'd hit his head on the wall cabinet before falling.
She conjured two flesh-colored strips that resembled bandages. Harry held his breath as Boughbranch poured a drop of Malfoy's lilac-hued potion over one strip, and Harry's slightly muddier potion over the other. A moment passed. Then, like grass, dark hairs sprouted from each of them.
“I don’t like you, Malfoy,” said Harry, attempting to steady himself. “In fact, I think you’re awful.”
Irritation swelled up in Harry once again. “How many times have you wished Ron or Hermione dead? How many times have you made fun of my parents for dying?”
"But—Neville?" said Harry. "You two are always together...and in the common room, after Hogsmeade, we saw you tying berries around his ankles. What was that?"
Harry slid down Malfoy’s sleeve. White skin, dusted with pale hair, was exposed. Gently, Harry turned his wrist, and Malfoy yielded. The Dark Mark was revealed once more.
“Oh, of course not,” continued Hermione. Her eyes glinted playfully. “Ginny’s with that Gryffindor Keeper now.”
Harry retrieved his ingredients from the storeroom and began measuring out a vial of salamander blood.
Harry used the distraction to unfold his letter. It consisted of only one line. In elegant, swooping script, it read:
Harry watched Hermione leave, but his mind was elsewhere. Malfoy’s absence should have been a relief, but it just made Harry think, and remember…
A blonde, curly-haired girl disentangled herself from the group. She looked vaguely familiar. Her girlfriends giggling behind her, she strode towards Harry.
But as he recalled the incident, what he remembered most was the ghost of Malfoy’s breath, warm and spiced. It was always spiced, as if he only drank cinnamon Firewhisky.
Turning back to their essays, they continued like this for some time (Harry wasn’t sure how long). Whether it was the plant itself or the spice-scented smoke drifting through the classroom was uncertain, but everything seemed to have slowed down.
"Oops," said Harry. He pulled out a tuft of dry grass from the ground and shredded it between his fingers.
Harry looked up from the kneazle-cat hybrid he'd been teasing with a toy. Ginny remained fixed on the box of treats. The cat took the opportunity to swipe the toy from Harry's hand.
“Right.” Malfoy raised a brow and looked pointedly at snitch. “You going to throw that thing or what?”
“I thought you knew,” Harry said awkwardly as Malfoy stared at the page. “It’s really not a big deal, I mean, it’s just stupid gossip—”
" Boughbranch looked up sharply, and Harry lowered his voice to a whisper. "The whole reason you invaded my mind was to get that fucking thing."
It was true that the Ministry had published a highly revised version of events. After much pressing from Kingsley after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry, Hermione, and Ron had finally divulged theirs and Dumbledore’s secret. Kingsley had kept the knowledge of Voldemort’s Horcruxes (and of the three’s countless crimes in destroying them) out of the papers. Inevitably, rumours both true and false abounded. But only those close to them knew the truth.
Frowning slightly, he said, “I just kept thinking...they’re not my family. They’re just people I happened to live with. I didn’t belong there. One day I’d get out and never look back. So, that’s what I did.”
Or he’d make everything better, press that mouth somewhere useful—Harry’s throat, Harry’s shoulder. Malfoy never went farther than that. Harry wouldn’t admit he wanted him to.
For a moment, Harry’s heart stopped. A flame leapt to his face. Surreptitiously, he glanced up. Around the Hall, students scrambled onto their tables to avoid the exploding Detonators.
But only Harry and Malfoy were bleeding. Roman's gaze lingered darkly on Harry's cut cheek, then Malfoy's bloody lip.
“What did I say? Oh—that again. George, was it? Or Fred?” Malfoy shrugged carelessly. “Not much difference either way, is there?”
Hot shame flushed Harry's face—humiliation that Malfoy could play him so easily, embarrassment at his own reaction.
It was the most Malfoy had ever spoken in class. And it was certainly the most…earnest Harry had ever heard him, maybe ever.
Left a bit discomfited by the abrupt interaction, Harry walked out and checked his watch. He decided it was about time to meet up with Ron and Hermione.
At first, it didn't seem very much like a dream, because Harry opened his eyes and found himself in his own bed. He tried to sit up, but an indomitable force pressed down on him, pinning him to his mattress. The most he could do was lift his neck, and even that was exhausting.
Harry took a steadying breath. Then, leaning in as close as he dared, he hissed, “Malfoy, I’m going to
Hastily scribbling an answer to his last unfinished question, Harry got up and turned in his quiz. He surveyed the room: everyone else, Flitwick included, was otherwise occupied.
They flew for nearly a half-hour without incidence, the snitch well hidden. One moment Harry thought he saw it—but it was only Malfoy’s sleek blond head far below.
Boughbranch frowned. “I’ll be there in a moment,” she said, and then to Harry and Malfoy, “Thirty minutes, boys, and those potions best be passable. Or you’ll both be back tomorrow.”
Harry didn’t want Ron to see it. He didn’t want anyone to see it. But he couldn’t very well tell his friends that.
As the hour approached eleven o'clock, the crowd still showed no signs of dissipating. Ron was scrutinizing a chessboard across from Neville. Hermione was curled up in the corner with a book called
“Yes, yes, don’t you think I know that?” a woman snapped. With a start, Harry realized she was Professor Boughbranch. “But the boy must face justice for once in his life.”
“Gentle the flame, throw in the ice-steeped Tulsi with the seeds, then bring it to a rapid boil,” said Malfoy with a cursory glance.
"Well, I'm doing alright, aren’t I? On track to Aurorship even with Potions, thanks to you, 'Mione. McGonagall reckons I just need to work on Transfiguration and Charms, pull more than Acceptables, and I'll be set."
“Women aren’t birds,” said Hermione automatically. “...And it is, essentially.” She blushed. “Harry, you still haven’t said anything.”
Malfoy peered at Harry. His gaze had softened, and he seemed...almost astonished. Then, after a moment, he looked away.
“Must’ve slithered out, the little worms,” he grumbled to himself. He nudged Mrs. Norris. “Come, my sweet, it’s suppertime.”
Hermione straightened and shot Harry a glance, but she left with Ron. Soon, the noise of the classroom dwindled.
before he crumpled to the floor. Dizzy, he squinted across the room, where a Malfoy-shaped blur was slumped, motionless. Harry scrabbled for his glasses and shoved them back onto his face, but it was too late: Malfoy was already on his feet.
Comments are being moderated to filter out flaming or homophobic content. It may take a few days for your comments to appear, but I appreciate every single one. They make my day brighter, so thank you, really. :)
“If you needed my help, you should have just asked for it,” said Malfoy, scowling. “I’d forgotten how pitifully useless you are. Now, thanks to your fat head, my potion’s gone to the dogs.”
Harry laughed. Malfoy’s eyes widened; he looked pleased. The pain marring his brow had faded. Emboldened, Harry continued.
Ginny looked at her shoes for a few uncomfortable moments; Harry examined an interesting stain on a bookshelf. Then Ginny broke into a bashful laugh.
"...I suppose I'll try that," Malfoy was saying to her. She tottered into the storeroom behind the counter, presumably to fetch whatever he wanted. Harry eyed the door.
, Potter," remarked Malfoy, leaning over the desk. "Are muggle schools really so substandard that you never learned to write properly?"
"Over here, Harry," called Ginny, laughing. Sunlight kissed her freckled face, pink from the early November chill. Her long hair rippled, fiery, as she tossed it over her shoulder.
Malfoy's smile waned. His tone turned serious. "Stay out of it, Potter. It's none of your business.”
Roman had been insistent. It was clear that he didn’t want Malfoy chucked into Azkaban for something that Harry, Hermione, and Ron had done themselves at least a few times.
This evening, when the clock struck eleven, Harry stepped out of the Gryffindor portrait hole. He’d told Ron and Ginny he was headed for Remedial Potions. But Harry’s lessons were over, and his Potions grade had picked up.
For once, Harry felt like he would do alright if he were tested: he was doing well in his classes, even scraping As and Es in Potions. His sleepless nights in the library had paid off, and loathe as he was to admit it, Remedial Potions with Malfoy had helped—though Harry was glad it was over.
"Yeah, well, don't think the Ministry would want word out that they're interrogating their own employees, would they?" replied Harry.
“You’re on, Potter,” said Malfoy softly. “I’ll meet you on the hill overlooking the Black Lake at midnight—don’t need Filch spotting us on the pitch. And bring the Firebolt.”
"Well, gesundheit to you, sir," said Luna cheerfully. "You don't seem very happy, Mr. Curly. Is it the gnomes in your garden again? They're quite lovely, aren't they—"
Harry pulled his cloak tighter around him. Shrouded against the shadows, he crept along the corridor. As he reached the corner, the voices became words.
Desks across the classroom lunged at Malfoy, whose eyes widened. His Reductor Curse shattered the desks closest to him; he dove for the ground, but it was too late—a desk leg drove solidly into Malfoy’s ribs.
As the sounds of rummaging and rifling filled the classroom, Harry saw Malfoy tear off a piece of parchment, scribble something, and fold it in half.
That morning at breakfast, enchanted snow drifted from the Great Hall’s ceiling, dusting all its inhabitants with a faint iridescence. But at Harry’s corner of Gryffindor table, faces were anything but cheery.
Ron eyed Harry's head lolling on his sister's thigh and said, “So, remind me again. Why aren't you two together?”
classroom. He didn’t need to conjure fire anymore; it was warm enough, pressed against Malfoy. But he often did anyway, out of habit. At times, the heat would become unbearable, and they would pull apart, breathing raggedly. Harry would rest his cheek against cool, damp stone and close his eyes. And for that moment, his mind would be blissfully empty.
So, Harry and Malfoy sat across from each other in silence, accompanied only by the sound of scratching quills.
And for Malfoy to look stunned, as if it wasn’t what he’d been hinting all along, from that first day in Potions to that Quidditch match, where he’d caught Harry’s wrist and
It was a thoroughly unpleasant experience, attempting homework while battling thoughts about his meeting with McGonagall, ignoring the incessant
He looked around the room, smiling. Nobody raised their hand. It seemed silly, Harry thought, that he’d never wondered where Vanished objects went.
Indeed, snow was falling gently, kissing the back of Harry’s blazing neck. Cold and wet against his skin, it trickled underneath his collar.
“What’s happened?” yawned Ron. “And why are you looking at Harry like he’s told you he thinks McGonagall’s fit?”
Suddenly, Harry realized that he was breathing quite hard. He couldn't identify the moment when he'd first started getting worked up.
Snores rumbled under canopied beds. Carefully, Harry opened his trunk. He pulled out his Firebolt and a golden snitch with a large crack splitting the middle. Then, donning his invisibility cloak, he hurried out the room, down the staircase, and through the portrait hole.
Victorious, hot blood pumping through his veins, Harry soared downwards. His heart felt lighter than it had in weeks. Together, the two of them descended onto the hill overlooking the lake.
Then there was a gruff “Get in, Potter,” and Harry was shoved bodily through a tapestry into a cramped storage closet.
“—Nimeria, please,” a man was saying. “Consider, for a moment, the consequences of such an action. You’d be sentencing him to a life in—”
no parents, at least none who know he exists. Family isn't an excuse for shitty life choices, Malfoy."
Unsatisfied, Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. When Harry reached for the snitch, Malfoy grasped him by the wrist.
“Dudley is my cousin. And I thought I knew all there was to him—I mean, he used to chase me all the time, looking to beat me up. He even set my Aunt Marge’s bulldog on me—”
The blood of the body turned cool. Teddy stiffened with rigor mortis. His face was a rictus of pain, of fear. Harry had had this nightmare before.
sad about it, only he was pretty delighted about the fact that Draco had decided he didn’t need to be discreet around Harry, even after the disaster of first year.  “It does,” was all Harry said.
“I know he invited you to dance with me.” Malfoy’s voice came rapidly. “It might, upon first inspection, seem that obliging him wouldn’t serve for spite—but you must be aware, he was taunting us. He knew you wouldn’t actually dance with me.”
“She worried she had damaged him.  Psychologically.  That her obsession had made it so that he couldn’t get on without her.”  Andromeda’s voice was flat.  “That was why she did it.”
“I meant blokes.”  Draco was finally done with the series, so Harry played a card, and the pile exploded.  “Snap!” Harry called, and got the pile.  “How come you’re not married?” he asked, thinking of it suddenly as he tried to shuffle the exploded cards into his remaining ones.
As much as Harry disliked reading, he could be really focused if he was intent on something.  Painstakingly, he read through each paper, following the letters with his fingers so they jumped around less.  He searched for Cecil Vance’s name, as well as addresses or any locations he could find with a map.
“I’m going to get you hard whenever I want.” Draco was panting now. “I’ll ask you to play with your big prick for my pleasure. You’ll only touch it for me, Harry, and I’ll watch you—I’ll watch you—I’ll watch you—get fucked—”
“No. The fact that I botched your exam is not confidential. It is, in fact, highly public knowledge.”
“You were so good,” Draco said, nuzzling against Harry’s neck. “You were perfect.” His hot breath was on Harry’s ear. “Just say no if you don’t like it. That’s all you have to say.”
Though this was a very Kavika question, Harry found himself frustrated by it. This wasn’t fair, because when Harry was with Kavika, he knew her well enough to trust her, and trusting her made him feel like he could share. “I don’t think there’s anything I can do,” he said at last, trying to share anyway. “Teddy is his own person. I have to let him be that.”
Hermione shrugged. “It’s not as if you get punished for it. Back Voldemort, be a party to the murder of innocents, join a mass murdering bigoted death cult—it’s all fine.”
“I would wager you that if I still had my practice, every single patient would be talking about Reveal. Honestly,” Kavika went on, “I was wondering when you would talk to me about it.”
Next, he owled Andromeda, letting her know what had happened.  Harry had linked her to the wards so that they could alert her if anything went wrong, and he made it clear she should not come to fetch Draco unless any of his wards alerted her, or if she did not hear from Harry within three hours.  Harry didn’t expect his trip to the warehouse should take longer than that.  After that, all that remained was to put protections on Draco himself.
Harry flexed his wrists and relished the freedom of the movement. His eyes dropped to the man on the floor but, somehow, he was the one that felt stunned.
"Goodbye, Teddy." Draco waved goodbye and Harry's sweet boy did the same. "I'll see you again." Harry's heart clinched when he looked up from Teddy and held Harry's eye meaningfully. Harry could've sworn he winked but it happened so smoothly and quickly that surely his mind had to be playing tricks on him.
"Yep, I wonder how many of them are going to get stuck in there this year?" he said, gleefully, and Hermione clucked her disappointment. "C'mon, Hermione! It's a right of passage that at least three get stuck. That prick Jansen was in there for 3 days during his first training week." He chuckled. They were always alright -- for the most part. He nodded at her work. "How's the fight against pureblood laws going?"
"And it's not like the bloke's a stranger to making himself scarce. There are whole years of his life that are simply unaccounted for in any of our ministry records."
Harry laughed. "I don't know, mate, we've had pretty crazy lives. I reckon if we go down the road of what could have been, we'll be going all night."
"I had to handle something for the new business before I leave on Sunday," he said, examining his nails cooly and trying to appear nonchalant.
Any common place that Draco might think of to meet up in the wizarding world would raise a lot of questions and probably garner attention from the press if Harry Potter himself were to show up with a captured and bound prisoner and just sit and wait...
"What an awful analogy, Potter." Draco rolled his eyes and wiped away a tear. "You know you always catch the snitch, of course we'd win in overtime."
"Now, I will not hesitate to penalize any of you for insubordination but how about I make this easier on the lot of you? Is there anyone here who has no qualms about making sure that Potter faces justice here, no matter what that means?"
"How charming..." Draco said, dryly. "Yes, it's possible. Or the floo could've been tampered with. Bottom line, even if Harry did manage to leave in enough time to somehow intercept Ginevra's arrival at Holyhead, it wouldn't have given him much time at all to do anything nefarious before casually making it back to the Hogshead." Draco reaffirmed.
Draco apparated them to a lush hillside that looked out over a little town that Harry didn't recognize.
"McGonagall still hasn't figured out how to break the wards. It's become quite the little sanctuary this year." Malfoy smirked.
"That plot twist wound up being the reason why the wand was never really able to work for Voldemort and how I was able to use it against him to defeat him." He smiled, triumphantly. "The wand refuses to harm its rightful owner, you see."
They looked up to see Harry and Draco both visibly touched but still pointedly not looking at each other.
"It might be nothing but... The whole pureblood family nonsense just made me realize something. Fawley, Flint, Shafiq, Ollivander... These families are all part of the Sacred 28 and, specifically, those who somehow managed to stay completely neutral in both wizarding wars... Well, Ollivander
He had to find out and he needed a floo. Any place associated with Harry would surely be under heavy surveillance so Andromeda was out and, if the ministry knew about Blaise and
"Look Malfoy, I'm going to be straight with you - you're talented. No one can dispute that. But your attitude is shite and do you
So when he arrived that evening to find that the entire atrium of the Ministry of Magic had been completely transformed for a black tie event complete with little clothed tables, seating charts, and a band, he had had half a mind to turn right back around and nope right on out of there.
"Oh, no -- hunny, you didn't. See I'm right here." He squeezed him tighter. "I guess Hermione was right, after all! Turns out I really was still the master of that thing. Who knew?" He chuckled and took a moment to count his blessings. "And you did so
"Eager, Potter?" he teased as he reached down to stroke Harry's bulge through the denim. Draco's lips captured the moan that escaped Harry's while his fingers worked to free him. The idea of Draco Malfoy touching him at all was already too much to process but, when those same slender fingers made their way around Harry's cock whilst Draco's tongue relentlessly continued its ministrations, Harry was sure he would come undone.
"Ahh! Don't point that laser stick at me!" He got up and backed away towards the edge of hall. "I don't know what kind of weird, freaky deaky cult shite this is," he looked down at his robes, "but I've got to get home!" He threw his own wand on the floor to a chorus of gasps and then tossed off his robes to don jeans and a tshirt, instead.
worked that part out because, Merlin! How in the bloody hell was taking the time to work out Cedric Diggory's dick-print-landmark not a clue for you?!"
Harry nodded, carefully, feeling oddly giddy and pleased with himself and incredibly aroused by the evidence of having pleased Draco.
Jaws continued to drop as they walked past and Harry couldn't help but laugh mirthfully. He nudged Blaise with his elbow. "You're right, this
"Oh," he said as he did it and felt the difference. It was another moment before it dawned on Harry what Malfoy had been insinuating. "Oh. Oh!" His face began to heat up once more and Malfoy smirked.
"Well, I'll be! Teddy, who is this man? Do you know him?" she asked of the little boy who buried his head against Harry's chest and shook his head in response. "Merlin, the last time I saw you, you weren't much bigger than this one!" She nodded at Teddy. "I would say congrats on the wedding but I'm much more a jump ship and follow your heart type of girl, myself." She looked between them knowingly and winked. Harry and Draco both flushed and Harry had to wonder, again, just how many people in his life had figured out that he was bent as fuck for Draco Malfoy.
Draco couldn't help the smile that overtook his face as his stomach filled with something fluttery. If he were alone in his room then, surely, he would've done a proper happy dance but, since he was in public and that was just undignified, he had to settle for a quick, discrete fist pump.
Draco pulled back and his eyes softened as he searched his and he nodded slowly. "Ok, we'll take our time with that. Build up to it, go slow. Is there anything you know you
It was now Sunday and he was sitting crossed legged on the floor in the common room preparing to meet up with Draco to
Harry contemplated this. Draco no longer caring about him after all of this would surely feel worse than a carefully aimed
want to have this conversation right now. "It was nothing. Look, Blaise, I've got to go. I'll talk to you later," he said as he started to walk off but Blaise reached out and put a hand on his shoulder to stop him.
They were sat at the same red and white checkered table that they sat around the very first time Harry had brought Draco to Kamal's, only this time Draco was the one making quick work of Kamal's signature dish while Harry's...
It was then that Draco finally let go of Harry's waist and the other boy removed his arm from his shoulder to wrap his bare chest in a hug with one arm and cover his privates with the other. Without a second thought, Draco removed his good robes (incredibly gratefully that he'd actually worn clothes underneath it today) and wrapped it around Potter, buttoning it with deft fingers as they stayed carefully concealed underneath the invisibility cloak. He looked into his eyes and realized that, ever the cavalier Gryffindor, he had never once seen Potter cry. Not even the time when all his bones were removed from his arm or that time he fell 100 feet off his broom. But right now, though his face was carefully blank, tears streamed unbidden from the boys eyes. It was just enough to make Draco's heart ache but then, voices from the Leaky Cauldron reminded Draco of the reality of the situation.
"Put these on, please." He tossed them towards the bed without looking. He was almost surprised when Draco did as he was told without protest.
Here comes the ironic part: In my attempt at self-destruction, I actually went to muggle London! I partied non stop with muggles for a good 2 weeks and, in the process, I learned that I actually really liked Muggles! The Muggles I met were fun, complex, caring human beings, even to me -- a stranger that they didn't even know didn't deserve their kindness.
Harry blinked back at her, surprised. A small smile curled his lips as his eyes were drawn back to the colorful bouquet and his heart warmed, fondly, in spite of himself.
Harry took a deep breath and focused on relaxing his bum as the tip of Draco's tongue tried to gain entry. Slowly, Draco's tongue began to stretch him. He was incredibly hard and tried reaching a hand around his front to stroke his cock but he received a quick swat on his arse.
. I know you're scared, but I need you to listen to me carefully. You can say a lot about the many ways I probably failed Ginny as a husband, but, I can guarantee you that if you could ask that woman right now, she would tell you that she
"Oh, this is going to be fun," smirked Blaise as he wrapped an arm around Ginny's waist and they began to walk. Harry walked so that he was on the right of Blaise. Hermione was next to him with Draco, Ron, and the girls close behind.
"Audrey, we have a sensitive matter that I need you on," he said as he closed the door. She straightened up, listening raptly. "Marietta Poles, the Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Transportation is being blackmailed over an affair she'd been having."
When Harry finally calmed down, Draco pulled out his wand and pointed it at the tree trunk. He carved the initials HP+DM into the bark and encased it with a heart.
If Draco could open his eyes then he would roll them at the barely hushed voices of his best friends who were clearly plotting outside his bedroom door. As if Potter were a reason to stay. If anything, he were a reason to run screaming in the opposite direction! And this was all his fault to begin with!
He and Ginny gave each other wry smiles and then shrugged. Penelope had insisted that now was not the time to let the public in on their breakup. He felt grateful that their friendship, at least, hadn't skipped a beat.
"Penelope Periwinkle." He shook it reluctantly. "Looks like you're in need of a Public Relations Witch." She smiled brightly.
"Yes, so I've heard," she said, brusquely. Was she angry that he was getting married or that he hadn't told her himself? He couldn't tell. He had thought she wouldn't have wanted to know. He hadn't worried about father. Now that the sensationalized rescue of Ginny Weasley and the upcoming nuptials to Harry had Draco painted as Britain's new, gay darling, he'd undoubtedly collected every
Draco played his part as he sat perched cooly on the edge of Blaise's desk, nary a hair out of place or wrinkle to be found in his pristine business robes. He even nodded along right on cue, too, as his partner and the floating head in the hearth covered all the usual pleasantries.
"Mmm, I love it when you talk dirty to me." She smirked. "Why are you still here? Shouldn't you be somewhere off snogging the savior?"
"Ron... Me and Gin haven't been good in years..." He swallowed thickly. "You know its hard for me to talk about that kind of stuff..."
"Hello, mother." He hesitated for the briefest of moments before taking the seat across from her. He was surprised when she looked at him, head on, instead of avoiding his gaze. Still, a deep v set in her furrowed brow and Draco braced himself.
"What's the matter? Not your type?" the bloke whispered in Harry's ear as he bent down to pull him to his feet and then did
Actually getting to a point where we could consider each other friends and eventually partners, however, took time. We'd done a lot of stuff to each other over the years and trust had to be built on both ends. But, trauma is the type of thing that, when you can talk about it with someone who makes it safe to talk about and who also gets it without making you feel judged, you really can't help but to get closer.
Harry nodded. "I started practicing those mindfulness exercises in your book last night! It was actually helpful." It wasn't nearly as easy to focus as he'd expected but it did help him to stop worrying so much about how the feast was going and he'd had a restful night's sleep.
"Only that he had a stocky build and wore a hat that covered most of his face. Gwenog did say that the first bludger of the game flew a little too close to the bloke and, when she went to bat it away, he yelled at her in a thick accent..."
"Oh, for Merlin's sake!" Draco fought to keep the emotions at war with each other from contorting his face. It was the first day of their 3rd and final year of training and he'd consistently been top 2 in their class in years previous -- by a landslide, even -- but, would it ever be enough? By sheer necessity, he already worked harder than everyone else, faster than everyone else -- everyone, it seemed, except Saint Bloody Potter!
"Harry's innocent, father. I'm just helping him find his wife to clear his name," he said, staring directly into grey eyes in a quiet standoff. "And if you don't care what happens to either of us, then you should at least care that the moment you draw attention to my involvement, then you also open this family up to yet another investigation by the ministry where they'll surely find that Ginevra Potter went missing from a property that's still placed in
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Harold Pots came to in a room full of strangely dressed kids screaming and brandishing wooden sticks that were shooting out weird lasers.
in close and snogging him senseless as soon as old tufty-hair got out the words: "Then I now pronounce you
Ron nodded and then his gaze wandered as if a lightbulb had gone off. He gave Harry a sidelong glance for a moment and then turned to Hermione wide-eyed. She gave him the "
"You know, the old me would've simply snatched this--" He waved the map in his hand. "--and used it as evidence to get you expelled and not have to tell you anything. I mean I could definitely make a case for invasion of privacy and stalking..." he said, smugly.
Harry leaned on Draco, heavily, as they trudged through Terminal 5 towards the DMT designated floo and apparition ports. The adrenaline that had carried them through this long week had finally gone and Harry supposed that he could sleep for a year straight if any one would let him.
Draco couldn't help his laugh, "Potter, you don't get married in pureblood families for something as silly as love. But, my bride to be is very... agreeable. I'm sure we will get along."
"Harry, I'm sorry -- I really am," he offered, sincerely. "We're going to find him. Now, please, go home and get some rest."
"I'm wandless, not a damsel in distress, Potter," Draco said snarkily as he pulled away from the touch, hoping to hide the shiver that ran through him.
What Draco appreciated, Harry did not know because they were interrupted by the sound of someone coming up the front steps.
Hermione hushed Rose, who started to cry when she placed her safely in her basinet, and went out into the sitting room, wand raised, to see the commotion. Her mouth dropped open when she came upon Draco Malfoy trying to push past an angry, flustered Ron.
Unlike London or other places that had established wizarding communities, the whole county of Surrey was practically muggle. He and Mrs. Figg were the only connections to the the wizarding world that Harry even knew of from there.
"Draco, I vow to love you wholeheartedly, including the joy and the fear. Moments of anger and sadness and jealousy as well as moments of happiness and gratitude and pride. In the grief and in the healing. It's all beautiful and it's all worth it because it's you."
He found himself lost in green eyes that were now mere inches away. Harry stared back at him as if he were something both precious and terrifying and Draco burned with the need to never ever be the thing that Harry had to fear again.
Draco smiled shyly and Harry reached up to pull him closer. Luckily, Draco took the hint and bent to capture Harry's lips with his own. Harry finally felt himself begin to melt and let go as his tongue twined with Draco's. As he lost himself the intoxicating scent of citrus and Draco, he couldn't help but wonder why in Merlin's name he had been fighting this all night when this moment made him happier than anything else in the world?
If it weren't so bloody dark, Draco was sure he would have paled. No wand should be that powerful and, yet, here Harry was, pulling away from him in a rush to head
Harry moved to the middle of the bed and did as instructed, resting his head on his forearms. Draco moved behind him, leaving him feeling incredibly exposed with his arse up in the air. Long moments went by without anything happening and Harry's face flamed when he looked back to see Draco studying him, reverently.
act, things always fall to shite! Tell me, how are we supposed to trust you when you could keep something like
"Watch me, Harry! Watch me!" Teddy -- with his signature shock of electric blue hair -- implored as he flew around their heads then aimed his broom upwards. "I bet I can do the Wrongski Feint!"
Needless to say, the witch was beyond surprised to find a bizarre looking gizmo with a horn toddling aimlessly around the legs of her kitchen table instead of her daft cat.
Harry shook his head. "No. As far as I can tell, he's just another power hungry megalomaniac -- Draco, hunny, are you ok?"
" He swirled around and swung the bat down with brute force, pulverizing a nearby vase and smashing the table it'd been sat on.
"When she actually did it... Oh, I could hardly believe it! I ran out after her as soon as I could. She had waited and she was crying but she smiled because she was finally going to be free, you know?" Harry winced and Draco frowned at his big, dumb friend. "Sorry, mate... I meant free from the lying, and the cheating, and the disrespect that she hated just as much as you did, Potter --I swear she did! She hated hurting you but she was just so afraid that she would hurt you worse by telling you the truth..."
15 minutes later, he had finished eating and still no Harry. Kamal came by to take his empty basket.
Merrywhip rocked on his heels. "No, really, I'm very sorry. I sometimes get a little excited to have such an astounding protege in my mist!"
Draco held his eye. "I didn't know. I decided all of this this morning and officially owled in my resignation this afternoon."
Draco searched earnest green eyes and contemplated the question, thoughts of Harry Potter swooping down and plucking him from a sea of fiendfyre and confidently marching into his Wizengamot trial playing like a reel in his mind. He sighed, knowing that the answer was yes, unequivocally. He could never tell
Harry nodded obediently and reached for his wand, pointing it at his fingers so that they were slick with lube. Draco hissed his pleasure when Harry sunk two fingers into the partially stretched hole and took Draco's cock in his mouth again, letting his fingers explore until--
Ron signaled to the band and waltz music began to play. "Headmistress," he bowed his head towards a smiling McGonagall. "May I have this dance?"
on that letter -- prints, magical signature, anything we can possibly trace." Reynolds nodded and made haste. "And try to get a timeline on when and where she might've disappeared from. Jansen, find out if she showed up to work on Monday, check in with your eyes and ears around Holyhead to see if they noticed anything suspicious. Stevens, she usually floos to work so check with DMT to see if there was any unusual activity from her regular floo points --  Percy Weasley is the Department Head, he'll know where to check..." Harry directed, bemoaning the thought of Percy having to find out this way but they needed to act
Harry blushed but leaned in to breath into his ear, all hot and throaty like. "I don't know, Draco, the way the colors reflected off of the cock flushed against your abs was pretty beautiful. Magnificent even.
Harry was about to argue that it wasn't wise but then the endearing look of excitement on his face tugged at his heart.
Draco froze, lips slightly parted. He had no clue how to answer the unexpected query. He'd never allowed himself to ponder that question because it was an impossibility. The dating part was one thing (if dating meant shagging, then he had always had whoever he wanted -- in a very discrete way...) but it was the
"No, thank you, Boply. I wouldn't want to disturb them. I'm just here because Pansy wanted me to grab some things for her, I won't stay long. When you say that Grandpapa Parkinson is playing gobstones, it wouldn't happen to be the monthly gobstone game with Ollivander, Shafiq, Flint, and Fawley, would it?"
Harry let out an exasperated sigh and shot them a terse, apologetic smile as he waved his wand to let it in. Of course this one also carried a letter written on parchment with
Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now all seemed to come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone.
Harry was brimming with excitement as he made his way back from the floo. He felt hesitant to get his hopes up too high -- knowing his luck on this case, in particular -- but it did sound like they had a real shot at the prick this time! There was finally a chance to close this chapter and actually live out his
"Mr. Potter... Sir?" He glanced back at his partners in crime who nodded in encouragement. Harry shared a wry look with Draco before he turned in his chair to face them.
"What in carnation is taking so long?" Robards asked as he finally stepped into the cell. "Justice must be served!"
"When I think about where we started and how far we've come... I still find it hard to believe we're here. And to think, it's really all because you are the
"See, where I think Grindelwald got it right is that we weren't meant to blend in with muggles and be mediocre.
"So far so good," he said as he reached for an eggroll. "You know I get to lead the new trainees through their first simulation next hour?"
But now, Harry's traitorous mind kept fantasizing about Draco taking over in that bossy, assertive, possessive way that he had when they'd made love. He swallowed as his eyes traveled lower to the tent in Draco's pajama pants and he blushed fiercely at the thought that, right now, he would like
Draco sighed and continued to stare at the ceiling though he wrapped his arms around Harry's waist which only made his chest warm more and lust pool in his groin. "I don't know... I've just never done it... Sex that's more than a hook up, relationships, pillow talk and all that stuff... Never appealed to me." He rolled his eyes and shook his head. "The universe is cruel. I guess it's my karma that the one person in the world I'd actually want that with is the one person I'd probably be strung up by my ankles just for having the nerve to want it with... And who I already know no one in his life could ever possibly approve." He gave a wry smile but there was deep sadness in his eyes.
Sebastian growled, running a hand roughly through his hair in frustration. "No. No! This is your fault, Potter!" He pointed at Harry abruptly, eyes wide as if something had just become apparent. "I thought it'd be enough to beat you but, apparently, the original lore is true."
dejected years of acceptance and dull muggle drudgery before I discovered wandlore, and, the tower of lies came tumbling down!"
?" he asked from somewhere far, far away as his mind was still malfunctioning as it tried to process information so at odds with everything he knew about the Australian man who'd befriended him.
"And Ernie told us that you're in his muggle studies classes and all about why you want to take them." He felt his cheeks heat up. "We all think it's wonderful! It might take some time for people to see you in a new light but, you're right. If Dumbledore said it, it must be possible." She smirked and Draco smiled.
"Harry?" he called out again but, again, he received no response. The wand temporarily forgotten, he felt goosebumps as he looked out into the still abyss, suddenly terrified at the thought of the next flash of light to come. Afraid of what it might reveal. He almost willed it to never show, to keep him in the dark forever, but of course that's when it shone brightest. Draco's heart dropped. There, to the left where Sebastian's killing curse had flown, lay Harry's silent, crumpled form.
"Quite frankly, Blaise, I don't know if there's any way that I can say it that's going to make it make sense.
And it had been hard, for all of them. While Narcissa still gave him the cold shoulder years later, she had started sending him hand-knit (not magic knit, mind you) scarves and hats and blankets on his birthdays and Draco had heard from multiple accounts that his father was overheard bragging about him when he'd made
Harry and Draco exchanged incredulous looks before Harry was being ushered out the door and Pansy closed it with a snap behind him.
Harry didn’t really think about grown-ups having mums, but of course they did.  He supposed Mister Malfoy’s mum must be very beautiful.
When Harry thought about that, he thought of the person who had stepped on his face, who had tried to kill Dumbledore, who had let Death Eaters into Hogwarts; he thought of Death Eaters, who had killed Sirius and Lupin and Tonks and Fred. He thought of how Malfoy had let Luna be locked up in his basement; he thought of how Malfoy had watched his cronies torture Neville. He thought of Malfoy using the word Mudblood, over and over and over.
Over the following year, Malfoy didn’t get any easier to work with.  He was always sullen whenever Harry went to him for help and sneered just as much as he always had.  But he always did help, and he never charged, and usually he was able to give some useful information within a few days at the very most.
Harry looked at the bottle, trying to think about real feelings.  It had hurt Malfoy, bringing him this; Harry could tell that much.  It was obvious why.  Malfoy thought Harry thought of him as a machine who was only good for potions consulting, for getting work done.  Harry should feel guilty about that.  He should regret it, and yet the only thing he could think was that he was the machine.  He was the one without real feelings, because he couldn’t feel anything just now at all.
“Ron saw Malfoy miming it,” Harry said. “Him stomping on my face. Malfoy always wanted to show off for his friends.”
“It’s been mentioned,” Teddy said, with a small ironic twist of his lips, but he adjusted his stance.
“Have they?” Draco whispered, his breath moving hair by Harry’s ear. His tongue touched the place he’d bitten.
“People think casting a Patronus is about intent, like an Unforgivable, or concentration, like Apparition. It’s not. It’s about letting a feeling inside of you escape and take form. To do it, you have to relax. Take that cloak off.”
“Right. Sure. Of course. ‘Thank you so much, Draco. We just love ex-Death Eaters showing us entire ballrooms full of bigoted purists who are actively agitating against the Minister of Magic and occasionally spouting off supremacist slurs—’”
“A fawn,” Andromeda had called it.  That was what you called a baby deer; fawns had spots on their backs.  Harry didn’t care; the fawn was dumb.  It looked dumb, and helpless, and pointless.  The fox had been much cooler.  Harry didn’t understand why, if Draco was going to leave Patronus to spy on him, he wouldn’t leave the fox.  A fox would do a better job than a fawn.
“I would’ve done it eighth year, if he’d asked,” Harry said. “I’d get rid of the Dark Mark for anyone who asked.”
Harry watched the whole thing with wide eyes, jumping a little when Mister Malfoy made a blue mug and a white one with flowers painted on it float toward him.  After adding the milk and vanilla-looking stuff and stirring the pot a bit more, Mister Malfoy danced a trivet onto the table, then spelled the pot on top of it.  Using his wand some more, Mister Malfoy made the hot chocolate pour in an arcing stream from the pot into each of the mugs, then gave the blue one to Harry.  “I apologize for the lack of marshmallows,” Mister Malfoy said.  “They’re a bit of a trick to transfigure safely.”
Harry thought of Malfoy, that triumphant smile, with Malfoy on top of him. Malfoy frantically cleaning the wall, when Travers had been terrorizing Fairchild. Malfoy lifting his chin, facing Shacklebolt, saying,
Do you know how long I’ve dreamed of seeing you like this, he’d said, and when Harry shifted a bit to see the look on Draco’s face he saw that Draco’s eyes were full of wonder. He looked as though he could barely believe it was happening, like it was magical, unreal, his hand on Harry’s cock—the back of one finger stroking along the side now, Draco’s breath hitching as he did it, his eyes glued to it.
“I’d rather talk about how Lucius is the worst,” Harry said, but he consented to the subject change, and they spoke more of Harry’s godson, and what it meant to have someone he loved be a student, training for a profession that could get him killed, or at the very best, break his heart.
The teasing left Malfoy’s face instantly, replaced by a blush, and Harry wondered at how many times he could get Malfoy to change colour in a conversation, even with Malfoy no longer being in love with him. “It wasn’t fair, exactly,” Malfoy said, his voice light and quick. “If you had expected that I would use wandless magic—I’m sure you would have been prepared for it.”
“I don’t know, Harry,” Draco said, seeming very interested in his scroll-thing all the sudden.  “Where were you going last night when I left the room to get that Cure-All?”
The next morning, Harry didn’t find coffee waiting on his desk. Instead, he found a wooden box, finely carved, but simple, beautiful. In it were at least ten different phials in various shades of aqua and green, two packets of light blue powder, a box of tea bags, and a sachet with some herb Harry had never smelled before. Atop all these was folded parchment, which—when Harry unfolded it—turned out to be at least five pages of small, neat script.
,” Draco said.  “Haven’t you understood any of this?  Potter.  If you—you who are rich and famous and as good as pure-blood, and the most celebrated wizard of our time—and for some reason you wanted to be with me, and we had a stork brought us a miracle pure-blood baby so that my mum could have the pure-blood grandchildren she’d always wanted—don’t you understand?  That still wouldn’t be enough, because I’d be with a man.  She’d still think someone was wrong with me; she’d still worry that I wasn’t happy, and she’d still blame herself, because she—she dressed me up when I was a child, and she let me put on her cosmetics.”
“Dunno, could be high,” said Nyala. “The bloke who dumped him is dancing with the fittest Auror in the room.”
” Harry shouted, tapping the door with his wand, which he had just slid out of his sleeve.  The door popped open, and the driver looked on in shock as Harry slid out of the taxi.  “Come on, you stupid deer!” he called after him.
Kavika had ignored this as well. “Emotional support can be about communicating your feelings and your problems,” she said. “It can also be about spending time with someone you care about, doing something that you like, and getting to hear about someone else for a change. From what you’ve told me, you don’t particularly value isolation. Why, then, are you isolated?”
crazy.  Things might get out of hand.”  Putting down his wand, Malfoy eagerly turned to Harry.  “I’m very good at magic.  I have a practice wand.”
Finally, Draco looked up, and he looked absolutely terrible.  It was not the lack of hair—his hair had made him look so gorgeous that having it all shaved off should have made him look a lot less gorgeous, but that wasn’t the problem.  In fact, the lack of hair brought out the delicacy of his features, the sharpness of his jaw.  He would have looked just as good as ever, except that now the thinness had verged into skeletal territory.  There were large hollows under his eyes, nearly purple on his pale skin.  His eyes were too big.  Harry felt like he could see individual bones in Draco’s hands.
Draco played with something on his cuff, as if it wasn’t quite straight or even, but everything about Draco was always perfect, so Harry wasn’t sure what he was doing.  Draco went on, “Father bought me almost everything in Diagon Alley, for my first day.  He said he wanted me to be prepared, and that I—I was well off, and should look it, and that the other children should—they should look up to me.  But I realize now that what he meant was that he wanted me to be comfortable and make friends, and that—that he was proud of me.”
“If you want me to tell you you’re tops at potions every time we meet,” Harry said, settling in in front of his Pensieve, “you’re going to have to wait.”
, Vernon had said.  When Harry had been the one who was a child, Draco had never once told him not to be a nuisance, even though Harry probably had been.  Draco had almost always given Harry things to do, never once even seeming like he was entertaining Harry for the sake of entertaining him—except that first time he had taken Harry flying, and even then, he hadn’t just been trying to keep Harry busy.  He’d been trying to make Harry happy.
“No.”  Scowling, Malfoy drank his shot, and Harry had to turn away from the long pale line of Malfoy’s throat as he knocked it back.
“I don’t know!”  Draco exploded.  “I don’t know why you would even—you’ve just asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up, as though—as though I had thousands of choices arrayed before me and I saw the one where I was a Death Eater and my parents were in Azkaban and that was the choice I consciously selected!  And then you insulted my working in a shop!”
“What about my parents?” Harry said, louder, as the owl landed on Mister Malfoy’s shoulder once more.
No one was waiting for him at home.  Even Kreacher worked at St. Mungo’s now, and the only thing Harry ever did at Grimmauld Place was sleep and wish he could go back to work.  Sometimes he brought work home because even the sleeping part was impossible.  It would certainly be impossible now, with this pressure against his sinuses.  As Harry began gathering his things—tucking his wand into his sleeve, his case files into a satchel—it never once occurred to him that Malfoy wouldn’t be up at this hour.  Malfoy was always up.
. Of course he was willing to do whatever it took, whatever was asked of him, because he was not the one in a position of power, because he was not the one who had learned everything he needed to know, because he was not the one who moved the pieces on the board. Shacklebolt was meant to be better than Dumbledore. He was meant to be
Underneath his skin was pale.  He’d got a bit of hair on his chest, just a light dusting of blond.  The scars across his torso were long and thin, raised white that looked almost silvery in the pale light of the room.  It was late afternoon, and the fire had gone out.  Harry’s heart ached at how beautiful Draco looked.  Even the scars were lovely.  Draco’s shirt was stripped to his waist, still covered in blood.
Harry watched them go, then lifted his eyes to find that Malfoy had lifted his own gaze back to Harry’s face. “I’m very proud of you,” Malfoy said, “that the world is ending and you—you’re in here snogging, instead of feeling that it’s your responsibility to save it.” Malfoy shifted uncomfortably on the desk, and at last, Harry understood.
Harry felt like he shouldn’t have to explain this, and yet he understood better now why he did.  “If I tell you,” he said, “are you just going to use it against me?”
“Look how many there are,” Harry said, gesturing to the cabinet.  “Besides, I don’t want anyone to know we’ve been here.”
All of Malfoy’s over-confident insouciance seemed to have slipped away, replaced with a stiffness that was almost hesitant.  Harry guessed the question about his mum had set him on edge; Malfoy didn’t like to talk about it.  Feeling a bit bad for having asked about her, Harry said, “It’s still a help, nevertheless.” Harry picked up the phial Malfoy had said was an indicator solution.  It was a smoky dark liquid that almost seemed to move of its own, like a rolling mist trapped inside of glass.  “You said something about the administration process?”
Afterwards, Draco said he needed to look at the files.  In the spirit of helping, Harry read a few of them, but after two or three of them he gave up.  Draco was going to read them anyway; he could just tell Harry what they said.  Maybe if they got in trouble, Harry could help with magic, so he decided to practice the spells he’d learned over the last week.  In the evening, Harry got to have more chicken salad and beef wellington, and then Draco made them biscuits and tea.  After dessert, Harry thought they might do something fun like they usually did, but instead Draco said he had to read more of the papers.
This was a lie. With the magic active beneath Malfoy’s skin, Harry could begin to draw it out, but the binding spell had been made with Malfoy’s blood and Voldemort’s, as well as the sacrifice that lived like a ghost in Malfoy’s skin. Wrestling with that spirit would not be the same as an exorcism of a human ghost—those took days. Still, the spirit that had been bound here would have no desire to leave.
Harry stopped, waiting for Milligan to say something, but instead she said, “Mm-hm,” soothingly, waiting for him to go on. She must sense his impatience, and Harry was fucking this up. He hadn’t meant to fuck it up, but he was. “And Ron and Hermione,” Harry ploughed on. “They are two, but in some ways they’re ‘the one’ for me. No one will ever be as important as they are to me. And then there’s Teddy. There can be someone that I love,” Harry went on. “But I don’t believe there’s just one person out there, waiting.”
“That’s part of the reason we’re here, nephew.” Rodolphus reached out in the IC:WUT/UC, perhaps squeezing Malfoy’s shoulder. “Please. Be seated.”
“No, Harry.”  Draco gripped him by the shoulders.  “Harry.  I don’t want you to ever act in a way you don’t feel.  Whatever you feel or don’t feel is okay; don’t let anyone tell you differently.  Do you understand me?”
And cups of coffee still appeared on Harry’s desk intermittently, prepared the way Harry liked it, waiting in a bubble of warmth.
Harry wanted to snap, because he felt impatient. Malfoy had cut him in a thousand ways, when they were young, not to mention that he had been a blade who sliced through everyone else he touched as well—Hermione for her blood, Ron for his family, Hagrid for the sheer front of his existence. But sometimes, in moments like these, Malfoy acted as though forgiving such wounds and adoring the person who had given them were the same thing, and they weren’t. They weren’t. “Of course, I remember,” Harry said, very gently. “You also told me that you’re a knitter.”
Draco’s nose pushed under Harry’s ear, Draco’s breath hot on Harry’s throat. “Has no one ever done that to you before?”
“No, no. I know of him, just as I know about you. You should know, Harry, I saw about half the population of MACUSA on a regular basis when I lived in the US, especially under the current administration.” Milligan sounded as though she didn’t particularly approve of the current administration. “I didn’t treat Vinicius—obviously, I wouldn’t tell you if I had. But I thought you should be aware that the wizarding world isn’t all that large, even in the US.”
“And I didn’t fancy taking care of a ten-year-old once again, but here we are.”  Andromeda headed off toward the kitchen, and that was the end of that.
“What I don’t understand is why it matters so much to you,” Harry went on, his voice very, very clear. “Is Lucius Malfoy paying you?”
“And it seems like it would be difficult,” Malfoy said quietly, “looking into it when no one else seems to care as much as you do.”
“Wow,” Harry breathed, as Draco finally finished. “Wow.” At last, now, he could feel the come, as Draco finally slid out and Harry’s arse immediately squeezed to try to keep him, try to keep anything, even the cold, unpleasantly oozing come. Draco settled in beside him. “Wow,” Harry breathed again. He felt loose and empty. “Wow. I don’t think I’ve ever been fucked like that.”
Harry took a second to close his eyes, thinking about how Draco had treated Harry when Harry was eleven.  Draco had had been so gentle and so kind, and here was Harry trying to drop the homosexual agenda on a fourteen-year-old.  Maybe he should have thought this through, first.
“I should have stopped you,” Mister Malfoy said, but he still didn’t sound angry.  “I didn’t—I wasn’t thinking.  Would you like to have a lie down?”
, however, caused Harry’s clothes to lift him the metre he needed to catch Malfoy’s hand, and then Malfoy was hauling him up, angling the broom to catch him. After an awkward moment, Harry was settled behind Malfoy on the broom, and Malfoy was whisking them away.
“Harry, you . . .” Draco took another step closer, and with the way the brows went up and his jaw loosened up, he looked almost gentle.  “You don’t think it’s . . . ?”  But Draco didn’t finish the question, and instead went on, “Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Then it wasn’t . . .”  Draco angled his face away again.  “You didn’t—it wasn’t because you’re bent?” he said in a rush.
Kavika smiled. “That’s so good Harry,” she said, in her gravelly voice. “And what do you want for yourself?”
Draco’s eyes darted toward Alby, and Harry’s heart froze for a moment in his chest.  When it unfroze it beat too rapidly, filling Harry up with the need to touch Draco all over again.
After the morning in the library with Malfoy, Harry had spent the time between and after teaching his classes communicating not only with Robards and Ron but also the Aurors Ron trusted who had been working on the open investigations believed to be connected to Lestrange and Greyback. Harry had already given them the gist of Malfoy’s intel, so once Malfoy handed over the memory and gave his verbal authentication, Harry thought they would be able to leave.
he couldn’t. He couldn’t think. Not just now. Not yet. He couldn’t look between them, at her. Not yet. Breathe, he told himself. In through the nose; out through the—“But I can’t,” he began, then stopped. He hadn’t meant to speak.
Harry shouldn’t say it.  He really shouldn’t say it.  He wasn’t twelve.  “You know, you really lost that Quidditch match on your own.”  Apparently, Harry was twelve.
The last time this had happened had been recently, actually. Nyala had been facing her Boggart, and Teddy had died. Malfoy had been there. Had Malfoy put his hand on Harry’s shoulder? But no. Malfoy hadn’t touched him. Malfoy never touched him at all, not even a little bit, not since—since before that day in Harry’s office.
Two months ago, the nature of the correspondence had changed, Matinsky claiming he had found something that would revolutionize the industry of potions.  When MACUSA questioned him, Matinsky claimed to have discovered the Fountain of Youth, but upon further investigation, the U.S. Auror found that the fountain had been discovered by a young witch Matinsky had murdered for the information.
“I think you’re probably a damn good one,” Malfoy said, then immediately flushed red.  “Give me that,” he said, taking a quick sip of the Wood-Eye Lye.  “You weren’t meant to ask me any questions before I had the counteragent,” he added, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
Memories were used for all sorts of things, including conveying information. They could be solid evidence at a trial, for instance. They could also be, and frequently were, porn. But Malfoy wouldn’t show him porn. Would he?
Harry’s soul abruptly left his body, and he turned into a machine. “Very good, Zabini,” he heard himself say from afar. Casting Accio on the Boggart, Harry also saw from afar; he saw himself put it in its trunk, just as though nothing was happening; he saw that his hands were not shaking. His body turned to face the class, and he was not far away at all; he was inside of it, but he was not a part of it. He was not a part of the voice that said, “We may not think of Riddikulus as a combat spell, but sometimes the unexpected can force an opponent off their guard—much like Riddikulus itself. Can you think of some other spells that could be used in such a way?”
was what Harry had meant to say, except it felt so much like what had been said to him in his childhood—what Snape had said, what Petunia had said.
“Harry.”  Draco touched his arm, and Harry finally looked up.  “I’m so glad that you’re okay.  I was so worried I—I wouldn’t get you back again.”
Harry’s hand froze on his coffee mug. Possibly Teddy should be corrected, but Harry didn’t want to talk about how Malfoy was in love with him, and this was pity, Harry realized. He felt humiliated for Malfoy because he pitied him. Harry almost felt compassion for him, the way he had for Snape, the way he had for Voldemort, the way Harry had for Malfoy sixth year, when Malfoy was so helpless and afraid. At least Malfoy being in love with him meant Malfoy was consistent in attempting the impossible.
Harry looked around the room—at Savage, Spragg, and Penelope, who were all red-faced and furious, at Baggot, who looked like he wanted to be anywhere else, at Povey, who looked like he thought he was in charge. “I do have a position,” Harry said, his words coming slowly. “If this institution does anything to get in the way of Theodore Lupin’s Order, I quit.”
“Yes,” Draco said, picking up his dishes with his wand and taking them to the sink.  “That’s why we’re going to use disguises.”
Whatever it was, they’d done it to Hermione too.  Her words about Ludville had been exactly the same as Ron’s; she never would have even mentioned the case on her own.
“A few times,” Teddy said, acknowledging that Harry had rejoined him on the path with only a short little glance. “A few years ago.”
The hope had faded, and something like warm humour had replaced it. “Fishing for a knit scarf, Potter?”
Jerking his gaze back to his mixing, Malfoy went on doing whatever it was he did.  It seemed a lot more extensive than a usual ID.  Harry wanted to ask, but Malfoy had told him to be quiet, and besides—Malfoy was probably brewing some kind of cure for this.
“I suppose I needed ingredients.”  Draco didn’t sound very interested, and Harry didn’t correct him.  “That book.”  Sounding troubled, Draco nodded again at the ledger.  “I use a lot of words, don’t I?”
“I guess,” Harry said doubtfully.  He wanted to tell Draco he seemed to have a skewed frame of reference, but he still wasn’t sure exactly what that meant, so he refrained.  “Is he friends with the brown-haired girl?  Granger?”
“Come sit with me,” Draco said, charming the dishes so that they floated into places on the blanket, then sitting down on the blanket himself.
“Malfoy . . .” Harry waited, because Malfoy had to know why he was here, but Malfoy had fixed his gaze on the Veritascope on Harry’s desk, leaning over to look at it. “You’re failing my course,” Harry said.
Harry’s next therapist was Doctor Septimus Duggins, a very young bloke fresh out of uni. He had bright, clear eyes in a face so fresh it always seemed just a little flushed, as there was nowhere for blood to hide. Harry had already been to one session with Duggins, but so far, he wasn’t feeling any closer to him than he had to Milligan. Harry suspected himself of being biased against Duggins’s youth, which was why Harry made himself return a second time.
“And we weren’t friends,” Harry said, hoping maybe the answer had changed since they’d last talked about it.  That had been a while ago; maybe Draco had just forgot what great friends they’d been at the magical school where they learned magical things.
Harry was so high up he could see a weird pile of rubble in the distance.  This was it; he’d failed at his first attempt at flying, which Draco had said he was really good at.  Draco.  He was very nice, and the ground was coming very fast, and Harry didn’t want to feel what it would be like to slam up against it, his body flattening out like a splattered bug on a windshield.  The air rushing by no longer felt nice, but threatening—it was there, but he couldn’t grab onto it.
me.”  Tentatively, Draco reached his arm across his chest to lift up to his opposite shoulder, gently touching her wing.
A gleam of triumph sparked in Malfoy’s eye. “I’m terribly witty, you see,” he went on. “Everyone wants to be my friend.”
“You’re not actually trying to catch it,” Harry complained at one point.  “You just keep showing me stuff.”
“Draco,” Harry began, but Draco was already climbing down the side of the bunk bed, which didn’t have a ladder.
Harry was sort of all right with that, though.  After all, Draco was a genius, and he was also a cheater at Quidditch.  Some things didn’t change.
“Mum made that up to indulge me,” Draco said.  “She obviously thought I was some kind of mewling infant in need of cosseting, but I’m eleven now.  I’m off to Hogwarts soon.  How do you think the other wizarding children will react if they see my mother mollycoddles me?  I—I mean . . .” Draco scowled.  “How do you think they
“First, stop losing it over Mum.  Second, stop losing it over Harry Potter.”  Draco twisted in his arms to look up at him.  “I was obsessed with you, you know.”
“And I need to be with you,” Draco said, “because I read those other files, and I have a better idea of what to look for.  Also, I know more about the wizarding world and could more easily field questions from anyone who stops us.  Therefore, it makes sense if . . .”  Trailing off, he fiddled with the placemat some more, and Harry felt his heart sink.
Inside, the air was hot and close with too many bodies, too much talking, too much carbon dioxide. It was loud with breath and speech and resentments of too many years, too many different opinions, too many different ways of looking at the world. Baggot, who thought things could go back to the way they were before the war; Savage, who thought the war was still happening; Penelope, who thought she was the only one who understood the real dangers of now; Spragg, who was so convinced the problem was within that there were never any other enemies; Povey, who thought everyone could just get along if no one ever voiced a dissenting opinion.
“He’s brilliant, isn’t he?” Malfoy asked, and Harry felt himself grow more embarrassed still at the naked admiration in Malfoy’s tone.
He shouldn’t have given Draco an ultimatum like that.  He’d lost his temper, and he’d wanted Draco to remember, and Harry hadn’t felt able to explain just how imperfect he was.  The truth was, Harry knew that he had problems.  He knew he was what Ginny would call
“Is it so I can be Minister for Magic, really?  Do I really think that’s going to happen, if I’m hanging about with a boy-lover like
A strange light was in Draco’s eyes, an almost manic energy.  He was still upset about his mum, Harry realized.  Draco was a little off, but it didn’t mean he wasn’t being sincere.
“I never said all Aurors are blood purists,” Harry said, because that was how Vinicius had taken it. He read
“You wanted me to pass a failing student last year.” Harry turned to Fudge. “The only difference now is the
Draco was still staring, his expression blank, his eyes still unusually bright.  “It was much more than one bad thing,” he said finally.
Malfoy blinked.  “Really?” he asked.  “I’ve gone to the trouble of creating an absolutely brilliant solution to all your problems, and what makes you curious is the colour?”
Draco picked up the trainers off the floor.  “When you came to me—about the case you were working on—you said . . .” Going to put the cloak and trainers he’d collected into the cupboard, Draco turned away from Harry.  “You said others from the Ministry could be involved.”
Draco-in-Harry’s-body touched the hair on the side of his chin, as though he had forgot it was there.  “I asked you, once, but you . . . I thought it was because it looks . . . .  You started wearing it that way when you were around twenty-eight.”
“I’ll bet I like doing it for you.  I like doing it for Vince—I like helping him.  And you help me, don’t you?  I bet you help me in other ways.  I bet you’re clever in other ways.  Aren’t you, Harry?”
Harry had never thought that someone who grew up with parents who loved him and children his age who didn’t bully him could be lonely, but Draco was.  He was so desperately alone.
“Yes, you are.  You’re friends with Weasel-boy, not me.”  Draco’s eyes had an almost manic light in them, and Harry realized Draco must be feeling the claustrophobia as well.  Harry tried to imagine living three years in the space of a day, trapped with someone you thought hated you.  No wonder Draco was behaving this way; this wasn’t healthy.  “And you’re still friends with him,” Draco was going on, throwing his arms up in disgust.  “You talked about their kid; I know you see them—you’re still friends!”
Dark Arts,” Fudge said, pretty much as disingenuously as possible. “Wouldn’t being bad at Dark Arts make one spectacular at Light Arts?”
“I got a phone number from Aunt Petunia.”  Draco was holding him so close that Harry was kind of talking into Draco’s hair, arching his neck around to look at Andromeda.  Harry pushed away.  “I called her on the mobile phone at my house.”
“No.” Harry’s hand moved over the scar on the back of his hand. “Yes. A little. It reminds me of something I would do, but I didn’t, and it makes me . . . it makes me worried. For him.”
Ron turned back to him. “You think him coming to the holiday party with Astoria means he’s not in love with you?”
Not even seeming to notice these asides, Shacklebolt stood with his gaze locked on Harry’s. Sometimes Shacklebolt’s constituency complained that the Minister was a little wooden, somewhat lacking in expression, but Harry had known him for years. He could see sympathy in Kingsley’s eyes at the same time as he could see his famous, unyielding resolve.
Instead, Kavika said, “Now is normally when I would ask you how you are, Harry,” she said, “only I’m not going to.”
“You get me so hard Draco.” Harry pushed against him, his dick sliding along Draco’s hips again. “You feel that? How hard you get me? I want you so much. I like you so much. Draco.” Harry kissed him again, but it was like Draco could barely register it, like he couldn’t even close his mouth, his jaw hanging as he gasped for air.
When Harry arrived before them, however, Malfoy was standing straight, a look of disdain in his face as he regarded Greengrass, who was ranting. “It’s a wonder you would even be seen with her, after the disgrace you have brought upon her—upon yourself.”
“But, um.”  Harry was trying not to pry too much, because he still remembered Draco saying he wasn’t privy to every detail of Draco’s life, except Draco had said that he was in love with him.  “You said,” Harry said, trying to think of a way to remind him of it that didn’t put Draco in a corner.  “You said you—felt differently.  Than you’ve said.  Before.”
“When do I become discreet, then?”  Draco turned to stare back up at the ceiling.  “When does that happen?”
“I’ll just jot down my address on this note you were so kind as to send me,” Malfoy was saying, smiling like he thought this was all some kind of joke.  Producing a biro from a pocket—and it was strange to see Malfoy with a biro—he scribbled on the parchment.  “Then you may call on me to your heart’s content, and I shall provide my services to the best of my—”
“I thought you might like it if there were spells to learn.”  Draco’s brow furrowed.  “You do like magic, don’t you?”
Harry could feel blood rushing in his ears, but he knew he had interpreted wrong.  He must be interpreting wrong.  “We’re not roommates,” Harry said, trying to speak without inflection, because no way was a ten-year-old talking to him about whether his grown-up counterpart was sleeping with him.  Just no way.
“Oh, she’s somewhere.” Malfoy waved a hand at the crowd on the green below. “You’re not needed at Rombe Pickle?”
“The money was just in my account.  I figured I’d better use it.”  Ron shrugged.  “Hey—what were you looking for?”
: Ron. Hermione. Could he see them? Did he want to see them, now? These were important questions to ask, because it could happen—it had happened—that he went to them and they were not what he needed, and he could see in their eyes that they wanted to help and could not, could not. What did he want? Who did he want?
Harry had told the Level Ones to find a partner they could work with for the next few weeks, same as he did every year when Wandless Combat progressed into hand-to-hand. The trainees had all been moving about; Harry hadn’t really seen how Malfoy and Teddy had ended up together—whether they had been the only two left, whether Malfoy had actively sought Teddy, whether Teddy had been reluctant to join Malfoy or indifferent. Harry probably would not have been able to tell. Teddy always looked indifferent.
“Not bribes,” Harry said.  “I mean, I’m sure the department would be paying a researcher to do it, if Robards didn’t have a stick up his arse.”
Greengrass’s expression only grew more arctic, but Harry thought it might be as incensed as he had ever seen him. “I don’t have to go through
Harry didn’t know how he was meant to communicate with all the years and history between them, with everything Harry knew that Malfoy had experienced and seen.  When Harry had been a child and Draco had been the adult, Draco had known just what to do.
“After the coup, some of the wizarding community resisted his rule.  A lot of them died, before—before Voldemort was defeated for good.”
“It absolutely is, one-hundred percent. And it’s got worse since you even last heard; let me tell you.”
“That’s what I thought.  It’s exactly what I thought would happen, when I went to Hogwarts.  I would make good friends with a boy who would play Quidditch with me, and he’d come home with me on hols.  It wouldn’t be Vince or Greg, because we’re already friends, and they don’t read, and it can’t be Theo because—well, now you know about Theo.”  Draco looked back at Harry.  “I’m glad it’s you.”
Harry thought about the Timothy Tree, its roots steeped deep in the wizarding world of blood hatred and purism. He thought of Draco Malfoy, who had sat under that tree, talked to it, come to know it, then destroyed it using the skills that he had learned, studying under its very leaves. The Academy was not a place where you learned the real history of the magical world, where you learned to protect not only your own worlds but the other worlds, the worlds that were not your own, the worlds that were different from you and frightening because they were unknown.
“And can you, er . . .” Malfoy hesitated. “Can you tell me again? What to do. With the memory. I think it—it helped.”
Then the black was squeezing them, colder and tighter than before, everything swirling away into nothing but cold.  There wasn’t even air to breathe, and then they were in the sitting room, and stars were swimming in Harry’s eyes.
“Harry.” Draco kissed him—not a teasing kiss; it was a kiss that felt like Draco needed it. “Harry,” he said again, sounding almost desperate. “You’re perfect.”
Kavika nodded. “Very well. Move forward. You teach a week of classes, no Draco. A month. How do you feel at the end of the day? Are you thinking about what you did? Are you reminded of it? What about the other trainees—will they react?”
Harry couldn’t hear anything from within the flat. The whole building was under a Silence Charm, wedged as it was on a non-magical street. The faint scent of cinnamon hadn’t been charmed away, wafting out to the street from somewhere within Malfoy’ flat.
Draco’s voice was soft, and Draco was behind him, so at first Harry wasn’t aware that Draco was casting another spell. Then Harry’s mouth began to water.
Outside was raining, the last of April a chill mist that washed over Harry’s skin. He wanted it in his mouth. He wanted it all the way inside him, until his chest was full of cool gray nothing, soft and muted, nothing.
“Some of these aren’t even people I talk to all that much,” Harry said, looking at the list that contained old Hogwarts mates from Quidditch and the DA, Teddy, and the Weasleys. “I can’t just go to them and say, ‘look, I know we haven’t talked in months, but I need to dump all my problems on you now because I was suicidal a few months back.’”
“Aren’t you meant to be my therapist?” Harry gave them half a smile. “You’re not meant to depress me.”
“I hadn’t guessed you would be into it like this, Harry,” Draco said, almost conversational as he fucked him.
Yin’s eyes grew even more sympathetic. “Why shouldn’t it? You were hurt. If you broke both your legs, would you blame them if they hurt years after the fact?”
Harry knew he’d done the wrong thing.  It seemed insensitive, now that he thought about it; it was just what Harry would have wanted—something to occupy him, keep him busy.  He’d gone so crazy after Sirius’s death partly because there had been nothing to do.  At least after Dumbledore had died, Harry had known exactly what to do.  Then with Remus and Tonks and Fred and everybody, the only thing to do had been to go on.
His arse was still loose, though, and aching. Draco had called it a cunt. “Yes,” Harry breathed, “I want it inside me.”
“But.”  Harry bit his lip.  He couldn’t help feeling betrayed.  “You said—you don’t even like him!  I mean—me!”
“We’ll also have to . . .” Draco coughed a bit.  “Er, they used to check wands at the Ministry.  For security measures.  A wizard’s wand is personal, but would you mind . . .” Pausing as though he couldn’t finish, Draco pulled his wand out of his sleeve, and at last Harry got it.
“Er,” said Harry, because there was no way Uncle Vernon was actually worried.  “He will be.  But my cousin won’t.”
Draco had called it, but Harry had never read the files Draco had taken from his desk at the Ministry.  Still, perhaps there was something in the papers Vance had had that would help.  After all, Vance was obviously doing something wrong, having broken into Harry’s house and casting that spell Draco had said was dark.  Maybe there was something in these papers about him.
“Teddy. Your godson?” When Harry nodded, Yin said, “Okay, these dreams are the worst. Mothers have dreams about forgetting their children. My best friend had a recurring dream about forgetting her Niffler.” Yin made a face. “As if you could forget a Niffler. They get into
“Because you’re not going to pass this class,” Harry said, “and I try to help trainees who are struggling.”
“I brought canapés?” Nyala said, hopefully holding them out, one in hand for Harry, the other in her other hand for Teddy.
“Remember I said the solution has several steps?”  Draco glanced over, and Harry thought that he looked really tired.  “I’m writing every step down in this ledger to make sure everything is done properly.”
Yin was focused on putting an entire banana in the blender. “Draco Malfoy? Former Death Eater Auror trainee?”
Startled out of his smirk, Draco almost laughed a real laugh.  Then he coughed.  “Yeah,” he agreed.  “Maybe you should have.”
“Don’t I know it!”  Draco waved his arms, never too concerned with contradicting himself.  “How does this work?”  Stalking over to Harry, Draco bared his wrist, then pointed at it with his wand.  Before Harry could do anything, the cuff-button on Draco’s dress-shirt was pulling open, the whole sleeve furling like some kind a furious wind was whipping it up Draco’s arm.  Draco thrust the Dark Mark in Harry’s face.  “How does
Malfoy flinched. “I’m sorry we can’t all master Dark Arts at young ages and faff about killing Dark Lords when we were seventeen.”
Draco was on the stoop, looking extremely pristine in the evening summer light.  He had on his typical “muted palette”—blue-grey dress shirt with well-fitting trousers and waistcoat, both of which were dove grey.  His hair shone in the sun.  He was beautiful.
“The indicator solution is to see whether you have been affected by a specific ingredient,” Draco said, pouring the three potions into low, shallow bowls.  “I don’t know what ingredients were in the potion that fell on you, so we have to test for each ingredient it could possibly be.”
Harry almost drew his face out of the Pensieve, because he certainly didn’t have to listen to filth like this, when Malfoy’s quiet voice cut through Parkinson’s ranting.
“Good.”  Draco turned back to the fire, which still had its green and blue, plus the yellow and red of natural fire.
As soon as Harry Apparated, he was pressed in on all sides—people wanting to touch him, ask him questions, shout at him, demand that he perform magic. He tried to answer as he had at Rombe Pickle—“It doesn’t hurt to disappear;” “There aren’t other dimensions that we know of;” “I have to see where I’m to go before I can take you to your grandmother;” “I’ve never been to the moon;”—but soon the crowd became too insistent, and Harry was struggling to breathe.
Harry looked up from his schedule. “I should think making me fall off my broom third year gives you all the happy memories you need.”
him, and it had been so long since he had felt this way. Harry couldn’t remember the last time this had happened.
Casting about, Harry found Draco’s wand sitting on the bench next to a leather-bound ledger.  Draco must have set it there just before administering the potion.  “Here,” Harry said, taking the wand over to Malfoy.  “Do you know any spells yet?”
“All the time.”  Draco appeared so fixated on the fire that Harry glanced to check whether something was wrong with it.  “They,” Draco began, then paused again.  “They wanted me to be someone I’m incapable of being.”
,” Draco said, and Harry looked up to see the chair lengthen into a sofa.  “Come sit beside me, Harry,” Draco said, and Harry wondered whether he’d seen Harry looking longingly at the chair.
The wand flew out of Malfoy’s grip, but he was rushing to knock it from Harry’s own before Harry could fully catch it. Malfoy slid down, his leg sweeping out to knock down Harry as he tried to recover from Malfoy’s rush, but Harry expected this. He had taught them this, and yet then
As soon as Harry heard, he put the potion from his latest case in his pocket and Apparated to Malfoy’s flat.
“Of course, I will,” Harry said, taking his hand off Draco’s shoulder.  “Come on.  Aren’t you hungry?”
“I’m not even going to touch it,” Draco whispered. “I’m just going to leave that big, thick prick between your legs, and you’re going to get off just from pleasuring us, aren’t you—”
Harry heard the traditional answers: Tarantallegra, Expelliarmus, Engorgio, Reducio, Lumos, Aguamenti, the Bat Bogey Hex, heat spells, cold spells. He did not have to think about them to accept them and discuss them; he did not have to think about it to point out that Protego was definitely a combat spell and didn’t fit the category. He had to stop when someone suggested a tree-growing spell, because that one was slow and might not work. Sensing that he was actually having to think about it, which might mean he would have to think of everything, Harry said that they would come back to it. Usually they did practice next, but if he could keep them going for long enough he wouldn’t have to think at all; then they would go and he could finally be alone, alone, alone—
Bennet argued Proudfoot had other solutions—a graduated unObliviate, so non-mags would slowly remember pieces of the Wizarding World they had already seen. Astoria said Proudfoot was a spineless worm who would never get them a Deal, and now they were back to the beginning, with some of the table saying change needed to come about through the Ministry, and others saying that change needed to happen in the streets.
“Will you be spending Christmas with Andromeda?” Harry thought to ask, just as he was about to leave.  When Andromeda had mentioned Malfoy visiting, Harry had been thinking about how awkward it might be to have to see Malfoy there when Harry went to visit Teddy.
“I know,” Draco soothed. “You need this lovely prick in your mouth. Do you want to lick it while I cast the spell on it? Just so you can have a little taste.”
Draco had also explained to Andromeda about the de-ageing potion, and what had happened at the Ministry as well as at Harry’s house.  “I’d gone with him to a warehouse,” Draco said.  “P—Harry said he thought it might be the base of operations for an illegal ring he’d been trying to pin down.  I’d . . . been helping him with potions identification before that.  I suppose I never mentioned it to you.”
“Let me take the hairband off,” Harry said, licking Draco’s chest, his stomach, his own come all over Draco. “I want to watch you come.”
“Let him run to daddy.” Robards scoffed. “He’s already put this Department in the shit-can. We’ll see what the—”
“Right,” Malfoy said, still sarcastic. “Instead you want someone who hurt you, who was a Death Eater, who hurt your friends—”
“Tried it,” Malfoy said, quickly pulling his sleeve down and shoving his hand into his pocket. “Anaemic for a week.”
“Like this,” Draco said.  “Gather the water suspended in the air around you—” He showed Harry with his wand—“and
“Yes,” Harry said, relieved that he didn’t have to explain. “They always want to know how I killed Voldemort.”
That night Harry had bad dreams. In them was someone he desired, someone who made him ache, but every time he touched them, he began to bleed. At first the cuts were little, as though the person were a parchment and he was too sharply swiping his finger against the edge of them. He ignored the scratches, thinking he was only being careless, but then the wounds grew deeper. “You’re hurting me,” Harry told the person.
“Well. I wouldn’t call on him in class.” Kavika smiled at his poor joke but did not speak. Harry glanced down at his hands. “It would happen less. But probably because they’d all assume I’d murdered him.”
By now, Finnigan and Ha had also stopped their sparring, but while Ha was actually paying attention, Finnigan was just staring at Malfoy. Because Harry had thought about it earlier, he recognized the expression. Malfoy hadn’t even needed to take off his shirt—though the fact that his vest appeared to be the entirety of his upper body-wear today possibly didn’t hurt.
“Brilliant,” Malfoy said, snapping his fingers again. “Are we sure we want to enchant them? Mark, you’ve said holding magic items might be intimidating for some non-magicals—”
“The thing—the meeting—isn’t until Friday. We have plenty of time,” Malfoy said. “Worried I’ll run away?”
“What?” Harry asked, having become rather mesmerized by the repetition of Malfoy’s bony fingers untying lace after lace.
Draco waved his wand and the silver fox faded, sucking back into Draco’s wand.  “I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco said quietly.  “Next time I’ll ask your permission.”
“You’re not even going to do that much for me?  Take your manky salad so I don’t have to smell it any longer?”
“As you know, that little Death Eater no longer—” Alby cut himself off, apparently having caught sight of Draco.
Harry tried to picture saying 'suitable attire' as an eleven-year-old and couldn’t.  In some ways Draco was strikingly like Hermione when she had been eleven, only she’d never talked about popping off to France or Belgium, and The Floating Monk was one of the most upscale restaurants Harry knew about.  “I’m afraid,” Harry said, trying to think about how he should phrase this, “we shouldn’t go out.”
Gradually, a form began to materialize. After another minute or so, the form became a boy—not older than Travers had been, when he was expelled, eighteen or nineteen. The form was translucent, like a ghost. Like a ghost, he wore clothes he must have died in: a long tunic, hose, no shoes. His hair fell to his shoulders, and about his head was a band of cloth.
“Oh,” Harry said again, his loose arse jerking against the pillow as his cock filled up. “Oh,” he said, as Draco filled it up more. Then Draco was tightening the seminal vesicles inside Harry again, which somehow made Harry’s whole body focus on the unnatural looseness of his arse; he needed his arse tight in the same way as the rest of him. He needed it full, and he felt himself grinding down into the pillow to get pressure on it, to get some kind of tension in it, his cock and his balls tighter and tighter while his arse was just—needy. “Please,” Harry panted, grinding his arse down into the pillow. “Please, get—get in me, put something in me.”
When Harry glanced at Malfoy, he was saying something to Mark, and Mark was responding with a question.
Draco hesitated again.  “I’m saying neither of us has ever been particularly nice to each other.  While I’d like to try that at some point—now isn’t that time.”
“Oh, the Ludville case,” Shacklebolt said, when Harry was done.  “Don’t worry about that.  Mysteries has it under control.  I’m sure it will all get cleared up in the end.”
“I don’t know.” Nyala’s head bowed. “He’s been so busy with the Order; I feel like he hasn’t had the time . . . People change, you know.”
“I thought so.” Malfoy’s voice was triumphant, but nothing like the softness of his voice when he had bested Harry in sparring. “I heard Goyle’s trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I’ve got you here . . .”
Harry cut in before Mister Malfoy could decide what to ask.  “But I don’t need anyone to take care of me.”
“Darling.”  Brushing Harry’s fringe aside, Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s scar.  Then he did it again, holding Harry and murmuring things, little things that Harry couldn’t hear, and yet the tone soothed him.  Draco’s hand in Harry’s hair soothed him; the warm hard length of Draco’s body soothed him.
“Never happen,” Malfoy said. “Too many members have investments tied up in the Diagon Association. Shackleshit will never build a coalition.”
Nyala’s presentation was perhaps the most impressive. She hadn’t cast spells for almost an entire week, which had proved a problem in some of her other classes, but this repression of magic allowed her to create a tiny dark shadow out of thin air. It wasn’t an Obscurus—too easily subdued for that, and not something that could cause damage, but the demonstration of knowledge was still impressive. Harry found himself wishing that Malfoy had thought of it, because surely he would have been able to create such a thing with a history of repression of Occlumency skill, and Harry very much wanted him to succeed.
“I meant, I wasn’t exactly sure when it happened—whether you’d remember on this interval or the next.”
Bending to sweep the papers off the floor, Draco picked them up and then began heading for the stairs.  “That was Cecil Vance,” Draco said as Harry followed him downstairs.  “I think it’s safe to say he’s involved.  That was a dark spell he used.”
Did others see that he was beautiful now? Or did they think that because of his hair, his skin, his eyes—which were rather sunken—that he was unattractive?
“Astoria always wants a revolution. Prepare your ears; here’s the food.” Malfoy tapped his wand, and the sound bubble broke, admitting the voice of a bloke who was standing with the tray.
When Harry cast his Patronus, a crowd roared its approval for the silver stag, then pressed in to ask him what it was, begging to see it again. “It’s a Patronus,” Harry told them. “I’ve sent it to see my friend and ask him how he is.”
Harry thought he might drool. The sight of the pink prick was too much for him, even softening, and his own prick was aching enough for the both of them. He moved down for a taste—
“I was dosed with something,” Harry gritted out, realizing that must be why he was reacting this way.  “I had tea.”
,” said Harry. “Draco Malfoy was part of a murdering death cult. He tried to kill my best friend. He let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. He stepped on my face. He tried to get my friend sacked. He—”
Draco looked down at himself, the frown back on the harsh, unforgiving face.  This time Harry knew the frown wasn’t meant for him, but he still didn’t like it.  He recognized the clothes, of course—Draco was wearing the scarlet robe, gloves, tunic, belt, breeches, and boots that Harry had worn when he had first shrunk down to his current age and size.  He wondered whether Draco had the knobbly orange socks on, too.  “Not always,” Draco said, sounding sort of at a loss.
Maybe Harry could Floo him and ask him where he got his mini quiches. Was that the sort of thing that he could do, now? To someone who had called Hermione what he had, to someone who had tried to kill Dumbledore, to someone who had laughed when Cedric died? Yes. Harry supposed he could. A question about mini quiches was the least Harry could do, after Nyala’s Boggart, though now that Harry thought about it, a question about mini quiches wasn’t really thank you. Had he said thank you? Was saying thank you to Malfoy something he could do?
Finally looking back at him, Draco smiled.  “You’re funny, Harry.  That’s something I never knew about you.  You’re very funny.”
“You’re holding on too tight,” Harry said, trying to make his voice as soft as he did for Rose.  Reaching out to Malfoy’s wand with one hand, Harry touched Malfoy’s little white knuckles with the other, tugging his fist a bit.  Malfoy’s grip loosened, and Harry repositioned Malfoy’s grip on the wand.  “Do you feel the magic inside you?”
Bottles and phials crashed to the floor.  Adult-Draco was not going to be pleased, Harry thought distantly, but adult-Draco would only blame himself.  He probably thought his younger self should be punished for saying hateful things, rather than forgiven for his obvious terror.  Harry had thought himself so grown up at fourteen.  It seemed so young, now.
“Cross-referencing” didn’t sound very much like him, but Harry didn’t say anything.  Maybe he got smarter when he got older.
When Harry imagined heartbreak, he still imagined an old cartoon of a heart literally breaking in half. The strange thing was that he felt that way now, as though his ribcage was opening, like the muscles of his chest were slowly sliding apart to make more space within, and yet it didn’t hurt—it was a sweet feeling, growing thicker and bigger and warmer and kinder.
Harry gripped Malfoy by the nape more tightly. “Hold still,” he said, knowing that knitting and reknitting feeling of scar-healing could be in the very least itchy, and at most quite painful.
Malfoy held up a vial. Harry could tell without a second glance that the swirling silver thread inside was a memory. “Pensieves. Library.” Slipping the vial back into his cloak, he swept toward the door. “You coming?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, feeling warmth settle across his back, then press up against his side.  He was warm all around, and Mister Malfoy kept telling stories Harry could no longer hear but could feel in the rumble against him.  Everything was dark, and a magic fox slept curled in his lap.
“Keep on it, Harry,” Draco whispered, letting go of the dildo. Harry had to grip it now, gripping it so he could suck and work it in his mouth.
, Andromeda had said.  Draco was eleven, but maybe you could do it then as well.  Harry, having not had much experience with being a normal teenager, had had to take Andromeda at her word.
Taking off his glasses, he turned on the tap, filled his hands with water, and dipped his face in. When he stood straight again, he dried his face with a towel, put his glasses back on, and saw Draco Malfoy standing there quite still, staring.
Harry grew, memories crashing into him in a rush—Hagrid, Hogwarts, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Voldemort.  Auror training, Savage, Robards.  Draco Malfoy, Cecil Vance, illegal potions, the warehouse.  The glass bottle falling off the shelf.  He could remember being a child, the confusion of seeing Dudley all grown-up, Draco making cake, making his nose-hairs grow, making a Patronus whose meaning Harry now understood.
“Do you think I wanted to go on?  Believe me, the last thing I’d ever want is to taste your scarred face, your righteous, Gryffindor—”
Perhaps Draco had adjusted his tastes for Harry, making more common dishes he thought a child would like.  Probably young Draco was used to eating very posh things, only Harry didn’t have much experience making posh things.  “Fettuccini alfredo?” Harry suggested, because at least it had a fancy name, and he knew that he could make it.
“Let’s test it.”  Harry stood to get a glass for the indicator solution, but once he was at the cabinet, he realized only a very small glass would allow them to submerge their thumbs deeply enough, since the phials were narrow and didn’t hold much liquid.  Digging through the cabinet, Harry found a few shot glasses, which he’d forgot he had.  He never used them, since no one was ever here to use them with.  It was a shame, since he’d had a bottle of good Firewhiskey someone had given him that he’d been meaning to drink for a while.  “Hey, do you fancy some Firewhiskey?” Harry heard himself ask.  Maybe he’d been thinking about Malfoy’s mum.
“He’s not failing Defensive Flying,” Harry said, hating this, hating every second of this. “Baggot said Malfoy was a fantastic student, and Malfoy’s always been excellent on a broom.”
It was incredible that he wanted to do this to Malfoy, whom he had disliked, to whom he had been indifferent, and then Harry was touching him, a hand on his shoulder, a hand on his waist. Harry remembered getting to touch Malfoy’s waist when they were dancing, the warm soft heat of him, and he abruptly wanted Malfoy so much that it was difficult to think, and then his mouth was moving toward Malfoy’s and Malfoy melted like liquid in his arms, gone soft and warm and pliant. His head tilted back like a girl in a non-magical motion picture from the 1930s, his mouth yielding instantly to Harry’s, his hands coming up clumsily to cling to Harry’s neck.
Harry looked over at Draco, whose head had turned on the couch to watch as Harry cleaned.  “I don’t know,” Harry said, finishing up the rinsing spells.
“Now you’re worried for me.”  A ghost of a smile touched Draco’s lips, turning them slightly.  “That’s sweet.”
Third year.  Dementors, Lupin, Sirius, the Shrieking Shack.  Harry could barely remember Draco at all in it, but he’d been there.  He’d tried to get Hagrid fired—again.  Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Flint had dressed as Dementors.  Draco had seen Harry outside the Shrieking Shack and had reported on him to Snape.
“That’s not what I meant at all,” Andromeda said, still chuckling.  “I meant he doesn’t like hearing bad things said about you.”
Malfoy stomped over to the couch as though it was an extremely arduous journey, then flopped down into it as though exhausted.  “I don’t understand how I could be friends with a Gryffindor,” he said, so dramatically that Harry half expected him to throw a hand over his brow.  “Aren’t they all brutes?”
Harry put his head back on his pillow.  He had always known Draco would fix it.  He was probably the best wizard in the whole world.  Suddenly Harry didn’t feel angry anymore; he felt sad.  “Will I remember being ten?” he asked, trying not to let his voice catch.
Malfoy had on a pink shirt, magenta trousers, and what seemed to be a magenta cape, draped over one shoulder. On his arm, Astoria had a Mohican, eyes circled in absolute black; she was wearing a dress like a cloud, floating and shimmering. These clothes were ridiculous. They looked shockingly good. They both looked really gay.
so that he wouldn’t think about other things. Exercising didn’t help; he thought too much when he exercised—though sometimes he went on a run. At four-twelve?
Harry tried to think this through, because Draco had really seemed to like them quite a lot when he’d been younger.  Even as a teenager, he hadn’t complained when Harry had made them.  And he’d complained about basically everything else Harry did.  “Did your taste buds change?” Harry asked, trying to come up with an explanation.
“Yes,” Mister Malfoy said, moving his wand over the wobbling bread.  “My mum’s and my birthdays were three days apart.  Every day in-between was both of our in-between birthdays.  Your and my birthdays are almost two months apart.  Do you know what that means?”
have intuition about Malfoy, he realized, and he hoped to Merlin’s shaggy beard that just now, that intuition was dead wrong.
Malfoy looked miserable. “They just . . . they all just discovered magic, Harry, and what if someone thinks they can fly, or a fight’s broken out? And Astoria, she’s by herself out there—I mean, with Gareth, Achar, and Bennet, of course, but what if there are NDEs, and it’s true what Rune’s said about magical medicine. What if there are broken bones we could cure, or how are we even going to regulate all the people who want magical remedies for—”
Harry kept rubbing the side of the cup. “I don’t want history with him,” he said finally. “I want . . . I sort of want to pretend we don’t have history at all. He’s just someone with a hopeless little crush, and I’m just . . . I’m just a person who feels kind of sorry for him.”
Harry looked up.  He was in a smallish room with just one window.  The bed was in the middle of one wall and the door being knocked on was on the wall opposite.  To the right of the door stood a cabinet with a large bowl and pitcher sitting atop it; to the left was a chest of drawers and another door.  He was in a bedroom, and the second door was the cupboard, Harry guessed.
“Kill the spare,” said Voldemort, the other arm slowly rising, trailing shadow, the thin white finger unfurling, pointing over Harry’s left shoulder.
The six weeks of Wandless Combat focused on disarmament. Today was the first day of hand-to-hand; after that would be a unit on wandless magic, and in the last quarter, they would combine hand-to-hand with wandless magic to create strong defense in situations where a wand could not be used. From the beginning, however, Harry had stressed the importance of warm-ups—partly because wizards just weren’t used to it. When you could use magic for everything, the importance of one’s physical body sometimes got forgot.
Hermione looked worried and stressed and so much like she loved him, as though she wanted to make his every problem go away.  “I can still help you.”
Harry didn’t remember the last time he had seen one so close. Malfoy had jumped directly in front of the non-mag, thrusting himself between the man and the Dementor, and now—and now, he was getting Kissed.
“About to have our fourth.” The Order meetings were going well. That wasn’t exactly what he wanted to talk about.
“Right.” Harry passed his thumb over the scar on the back of his other hand. “You said you wanted to discuss my treatment.”
Harry wanted to reach up and rub his scar on his forehead, but instead he rubbed the scar on his hand—a habit he’d developed long after either scar stopped hurting. He never used to be a fidgeter, but he thought about it now, why he was doing it. It was because he didn’t want to think about Malfoy.
“Good,” Teddy said.  He didn’t tend to be particularly talkative, though Harry had had some experience to prepare him for Draco’s verbosity, since Harry knew Rose Granger-Weasley.
Harry held up his hands.  “All I knew was that she was in Janus Thickey,” he said.  “I didn’t lie about being friends.  It just—hasn’t happened yet.”
This made Harry chuckle. “Right. I just mean, I was always doing things that I thought weren’t getting done. But when I killed Voldemort, and the war ended—I didn’t know how to put Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban for longer than he got. I didn’t know how to remake the Ministry. I think a part of me thought . . . I wouldn’t need to.”
His voice was still soft, but Harry figured he’d better do what Mister Malfoy said, so he went and sat at the table.
“Oh.” Malfoy took a swift breath, and Harry could hear the recollection in it. “I was—don’t . . . half of the things I said then were at least seventy-five percent falsehood.”
“Yeah, get my lips around it, get in in my mouth, this gorgeous dick.” Harry kissed him again. “I want to feel it in my throat. I want to have no choice but to swallow all that hot come. I want it; I want to be close to you; I want all of you; I love you.”
“You want to give him a fair shot at being your boyfriend?” Yin actually sounded a bit annoyed by this. Harry thought maybe mind healers weren’t meant to sound annoyed—Kavika never had, but something about Yin’s annoyance made him feel better, like they were a real person, with real reactions. “No one deserves to be your boyfriend, Harry. No one even deserves to be your friend. You get to
Harry didn’t know why, but this fact made him even hotter, and Draco must have found it hot too, because the pace of the fucking increased. Harry arched his back to try to get more of it, more and more. Then his cock began to grow.
“Very good.”  Draco beamed at him.  “Now I’ll read you the next part, and you’ll get the hang of it.”
The next three days fell into a sort of pattern.  Draco was always up before Harry, which gave Harry doubts about how much Draco slept.  The bunk bed stayed, however, and even though Draco was always telling Harry to go to sleep when they were lying there, he always answered Harry’s questions until Harry actually slept.
Draco was teasing, Harry was fairly certain, but he put his head back on the pillow anyway.  “Draco?” he said, after another minute, looking back over the side.
Just then, muffled sounds became apparent over the Hearing Raid, interspersed with a clicking with which Harry was very familiar.
“I mean, important grown-ups,” Malfoy said, irritated.  “People of statues in the wizarding world.  People of—of influence.”
“You didn’t tell me so last time we had drinks together,” Harry said.  “But you did tell me one time when we were having lunch.  Do you want to sit with me?”
The second session was rather more about Harry’s specific troubles than Harry exactly wanted, as Doctor Sibanyoni had really seemed to want to delve deeply into Harry’s non-magical childhood, and Harry had already talked to Kavika about that a great deal. Harry understood some things now that he had not when he was young, things about abuse, about neglect, about the developmental difficulties such things could cause for children. With Kavika’s help, Harry had seen how some of these experiences had shaped his life and still shaped his character in ways he would not have otherwise seen or understood. Though he had reached a good place with Kavika, Harry could also understand why a new therapist might want an understanding of Harry’s background in order to treat him. After all, Harry’s childhood had been foundational for him, just as it was for every adult who had once been a child.
Malfoy touched his wand to the cup, Banishing it. “Have a chocolate,” he said, producing a bonbon from somewhere in his robes. It was in a little paper cup, like a proper sweet.
“Ron Weasley?” Harry said, excited again about the idea of having friends.  “Is he the red-head one?”
people hurting each other and killing each other over ideology that’s—over any ideology! I want to stop people killing each other, and hating each other, and—and being cruel! You think that’s what Death Eaters
“Very good,” Draco murmured, and Harry felt his chest expand.  He’d never been a good student, but then, he’d never had a teacher like Mister Malfoy.  He was sitting close now, and Harry could feel the warmth of Draco’s arm through his sleeve.  He smelled nice, like cake and fire.  “Polaris is part of Ursa Minor,” Draco went on.  “Draco’s tail is between the two bears.”
Draco, who had followed him into the kitchen, made a face.  “I detest salad.  Do you call this a kitchen?”
“No.” Harry looked down. “I know. I know. I was just . . . I feel . . .” Harry looked down at his hands, thinking of April, how it was meant to be miserable and instead it was sunny. There was nothing he could do about that. “Helpless,” Harry said suddenly, able to name the emotion.
This was an invitation, warmly and freely made. Recognizing it, Harry gave him half a smile. “If it’s still with Robards, I’m not sure I want to know.”
“I thought I would be fucking, mainly.”  Draco looked away, idly doodling with his wand over one of the burned books.  “But as it turns out, no one wants to fuck a Death Eater.”
“We have fish all the time, but—not like that.  I got to have chips once with Aunt Bella.  Mum doesn’t—it’s very greasy, isn’t it?” Draco asked hopefully.
Harry watched the blush fade, then said, “I thought he preferred you.” He waited as confusion clouded Malfoy’s face. “I thought it was rebellion, maybe, or what I said about the Force. And then he found someone—someone like a godfather, but who hadn’t been there to raise him, to disappoint him—”
Kavika smiled a little. “Well, it’s definitely true that no Malfoy wants to disappoint Malfoy Manor.”
In the end, the Board of Regents came to unanimous agreement. Teddy Lupin was allowed to graduate, Draco Malfoy to advance to Level Two.
Malfoy was often by Teddy’s side, for some reason—in Wandless Combat, but then sometimes Harry saw them in the corridors—not always together, but a few times. He even once saw them talking together under the Timothy Tree, its leaves a carpet of brown and red at their feet, Teddy’s hair sunny blond next to Malfoy’s duller colour. Teddy sometimes unconsciously mirrored people he spent time with in physical appearance, but Harry had never seen Teddy do it with anyone he didn’t like.
Mister Malfoy’s smile was almost a real one.  “Would you like to try some more magic?” he said, instead of answering Harry’s question.
“I had hoped that the Order of the Phoenix would keep him busy,” Harry said, half expecting to be asked what the Order of the Phoenix was. Kingsley and Kavika had announced the resurrection of the Order directly after Kingsley’s resignation, repurposing the Order into a public-facing political organization rather than a secret team of guerrilla spies fighting against militant coup. Duggins, however, didn’t ask about the Order, and Harry went on, “But when I told Teddy the Order needed volunteers, he said he was ‘busy with other things.’ I just don’t know
.” Harry could tell he had been grinding his teeth against anger; it wasn’t good. He and Kavika had had arguments before about expressing anger. She told him he needed to let it out; he told her he was tired of being angry. He didn’t want it any longer.
“Or like bring their daughters to exclusive Ministry parties. No, wait. Look.” Ron nodded over toward the Greengrass daughter. Kavika had moved away, and—Draco Malfoy took the young woman’s arm. The holiday party was fancy dress, and Malfoy had on a cream-coloured thing that made him look like a fairy tale prince, except for the face.
Harry’s heart was twisting in his chest.  “He was attractive in school.  I just didn’t realize it.  I looked back on it afterwards—how he looked—and realized he was.”
Gasping, Harry ripped the pillow from his face, then struggled with the bedclothes. He was tangled in them, the wet layer of sweat somehow making them more complicated. “Accio wand,” he said, and this time, it snapped into his hand. Banishing the covers, he was panting, covered in sweat. Still hard. “Accio glasses,” he croaked.
Something closed around Harry’s heart, and he realized once more that it was pity, warmer than before. “And no one else would buy it for you either?”
Kavika was silent for so long that Harry began to play with the Magbricks, just to keep his hands busy. After a minute, he clunked them down on the table. “I mean it. What would be the point?”
“But you showed it to me,” said Harry, really distressed about this now.  Maybe Draco wasn’t going to remember either, the way they had been friends.  “And there was a queen who was really stuck-up, and they put her in the sky too.  They put her in upside-down.”
“I just . . .” Harry picked up the smoothie again. He’d put it down at some point. “I notice it more. I used to notice it, but . . .” Harry put down the smoothie. “He told me he was in love with me.”
Malfoy didn’t move. “You weed the non-magical way, don’t you. Gives you something to do with your hands. Focus your mind.” Sliding his hands into his pockets, Malfoy went on, “I have the same thing with cooking. Never did it when I was younger; we had . . . . It helps. What do you do in the winter?”
Harry knew he should have used that time to do something constructive—sleep, or work on the illegal potions case, but he couldn’t.  Ron and Hermione were being controlled; he needed to help them, and Draco was up there alone, convinced his father was a murderer.  Draco had seemed so pleased about it on the train after Cedric had died, when they’d all been going home.  Draco had said Voldemort would come for Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first; he’d
“Expelliarmus,” Harry told another wizard a few metres away, halfway through casting Cruciatus at a non-mag. Almost simultaneously, a silver shield popped into existence around Teddy and Harry, and an Avada Kedavra bounced off of them. The wand of wizard Harry had just disarmed floated from its owner to Harry, and in the other direction, Harry found Malfoy on his broomstick, who had cast the Protego, now disarming the witch who had cast the AK.
“I said just lick,” Draco said. “Don’t suck it until I tell you too. Nice little pretty kitten licks, Harry, like it’s a nice lolly for you. Okay?”
“Of course you were, after all you’ve been through,” Malfoy said, soothing. “If not, you may come as my guest.” He touched Travers’s arm, and Harry could see the way these kind words, this gentle tone, could be almost . . . compelling, if they hadn’t been coming from Malfoy. When Travers seemed to hesitate, Malfoy dropped his hand and said, “If this is about what happened at Academy . . .” Trailing off, Malfoy glanced toward the ballroom as well, the crystal clear glass, the magic light spilling onto the lawn. “Everyone in there understands what you did,” Malfoy said. “Perhaps they find the methods rather . . . uncouth, but you know behind closed doors, they support it. The Force needs more people who aren’t grovelling to Shacklebolt. Why do you think I’m at Academy?”
“But wizards can cast a Patronus. Muggles can’t. Surely that’s something,” said Josias Flint, one of Marcus’s cousins.
Malfoy jumped, and Harry immediately let go. “Sorry,” Malfoy said quickly, moving back into Harry’s space. “You can—you can do it.”
“Yes, Instructor Potter,” Malfoy said, and he kissed him. Malfoy kissed him thoroughly, and this felt like teaching too—the way that Malfoy did it was slow, careful, testing, as though noting what Harry liked and then expanding on it. What Harry liked was Malfoy in his mouth, Malfoy filling him up, owning him. Soon Malfoy’s legs were wrapped around him, cradling him close, and Malfoy’s upper body had surged up to plaster against him, enveloping Harry in his arms, kissing him so intensely that Harry couldn’t think or know or feel anything but Malfoy.
Looking at that face, Harry could believe they weren’t friends in a way he’d never been quite able to before, and it had reminded him of one tiny detail that seemed to be missing from this whole scheme.  “If we’re not friends,” Harry ploughed on, “why would you come to the Ministry with me?  If you’re going as me, and I’m going as you.  Do other people think we’re friends?”
“No.” The forcefulness with which this answer came to Harry felt as though it should have made everything so much simpler. “He doesn’t. Not at all. But there’s . . . it’s like, there’s something in my brain that can’t—it can’t get over who he was. Even though he’s a different person now.”
Harry’s hands slid down Malfoy’s sides, to his thighs. Gripping them, he pulled up, and Malfoy obeyed, lifting his arse to sit on the desk, to spread his thighs for Harry’s body, to tilt his head back for Harry’s mouth, to open his lips for Harry’s tongue. Harry pulled away, and Malfoy was leaning back so far he’d likely fall back against the desk, if Harry wasn’t holding him to sit upright. “Kiss me,” Harry said.
The training room was long and open, with wood floors and mirrors along one side, which were helpful for correcting stances and demonstrating wand motions. “Well, of course,” Malfoy said, suddenly dropping his bag by the door and coming in farther. “If you want to do it naked; that’s fine. Nudity doesn’t bother me.” He sniffed. “It’s good for you.”
Harry supposed that if you were a teenage boy, a tall gay man being extremely competent with his body might be appealing somehow. Fleur had said that Malfoy was well-made. Harry turned to look at Malfoy as well.
Thank you all for your very kind response to this story.  I hope you continue to enjoy!  If you want to talk, you can find me at letteredlettered on tumblr.
. If you honestly think I could bear his constant prattling about Muggles—you, my friend, are off your nut.”
“Do you want to . . .” Tugging Draco’s hair again, Harry wet his lips. “Are you going to fuck me, now?”
things like that. It’s not fair of you, to me; you’re not being fair to me, knowing that I—I never brought it up. I stayed away. I tried to stay away; I . . .” Malfoy turned away, teeth baring in frustration.
and Flint and those bastards on the Council. Do you know Flint’s son was one of those NDEs at that meeting Malfoy busted? And his mum’s still on the Council?”
Forcing himself to put his glasses on, Harry stood up. Cast cleaning spells on himself, then the bed. A cooling spell as well. It helped with the throbbing between his legs, but he was still thick, still aroused. How could he still be hard, after that? Why wouldn’t his cock get the message? What was wrong with his body, that it could not understand his heart? Harry took a shower. When he closed his eyes under the room temperature spray, he saw Malfoy, that bright happy smile Malfoy had had, after he had defeated him in the sparring match at the end of last term. Opening his eyes, Harry did not close them again.
“He actually told Hilda that he wants Ted’s Order of the Phoenix to bring down the entire Department.”
“Oh,” Draco said breathlessly.  Then he straightened up, puffing his chest out a bit.  The colour began to fade from his cheeks.  “That’s—that’s all right, then,” he said, repeating Harry’s words.  “I mean . . .”  He flapped a hand.  “
Harry followed.  “I saw something while I was falling.  Some old stones.  I think there used to be a building nearby.”
After making sure Draco was safely arranged on the couch, Harry enlarged Draco’s clothes again.  The sandwich was gone, so probably Draco had eaten, but Harry got out water biscuits just in case.  Then Harry had a quick shower and changed his own clothes, summoning them from Grimmauld Place.  Dressed and clean after a day of watching Draco age, Harry set to work fixing the floral-print chair.  He’d always liked that chair.  He hoped it was salvageable, and trying to repair it was better than sitting there watching Draco be unconscious.  That was all Harry really wanted to do.
had already reported on his lack of intention to be an Auror. Nyala and Malfoy advanced to Level Two with very little fanfare. Baggot had given Malfoy highest marks.
It had kept happening: seeing Malfoy, remembering the dream. Then remembering that moment with Malfoy above him, besting him, smiling down at him. Then remembering the way dream-Malfoy had ground his hips against him, the way dream-Malfoy had held him pinned, then leaned down to trail his breath against . . . but that hadn’t happened in the dream, had it? Was Harry remembering the dream, or was he inventing more of it?
“Different.” Harry set his coffee down again. “I didn’t really see him with groups of students. Usually just Icarus, or maybe a few other close friends. They didn’t—they treated me more like . . .”
“You mentioned that before.”  The smile was growing now, but it wasn’t mean.  Just—amused.  “Do your aunt and uncle have a cupboard under the stairs?”
“I don’t want any,” Harry called, not even opening the door.  His finger was on the address, but there was nothing he could do with it.  If only he could get to London.
“What—what colour will it change into?” Harry kept his shoulders straight, even though he was a bit worried about having a differently-coloured thumb.
“Yes,” Yin said, because Harry had told them that almost straight after it had happened. “And you liked it. Is it safe to say you want him physically?”
“Sometimes it means not being true to yourself, but other times it can mean being respectful towards others.  Come, let me—”  Leaning forward, Draco started wiping Harry’s cheek with the napkin.
Malfoy suddenly looked so naked, his eyes large and his brows up like the wind had been knocked from him.  “Don’t you?” he asked, his voice cracking.
Suddenly Draco stood and turned, scroll in hand.  “What are you doing here on a Sunday anyway, Savage?”
“I’m sure a spider would love it.” Teddy turned seriously to the first kid. “Shrouds are what ghosts are made of.”
“You shouldn’t be out here without shoes,” Mister Malfoy said, as though noticing the socks at the same time.  “Really, Potter, haven’t we stood outside long enough?”
