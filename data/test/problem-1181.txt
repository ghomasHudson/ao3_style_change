. It hit him how much he needed to release the tension that had built between them.
They walked back to the living room, where Narcissa sat on the black armchair still as ever; she stood up immediately upon recognising who was in Draco’s company.
for good measure in order to tie and glue the three unconscious wizards together.
“I should go”.
His cheek glistened in the light- it was wet- and it made Harry’s heart cramp just a little.
“Damnit Potter”, he cursed, although it came across as more of a moan.
Harry cast an Anti-Disapparition jinx before removing the wizards’ wands and stupefying them once more.
“Can I come in?”
A helpless moan from Draco interrupted him as the former wrapped his arms around Harry’s back.
“Why did you come to my house just to yell at me?”
“Be there in a second!” he yelled, turning down the heat on his stove, wiping his messy hands on the apron he’d borrowed from Molly- “for no particular reason, Molly, I just don’t want to have to wash my clothes every time I cook”.
“You gonna come untouched Draco?” Harry urged him on, “you gonna come just from my cock fucking you so hard you’re not gonna be able to walk for a week? Hm?”
Harry’s obsession with Draco Malfoy had never quite subsided. Despite not thinking he was a Death Eater anymore, Harry continued to observe him, study him. Malfoy did the same. What once was rivalry had turned into a sort of intense mutual respect, and though they hardly ever talked in privacy, it was often that their eyes would meet when they trained or worked in groups. Of course they insulted each other just as much as they had when they were teenagers.
, Potter”, he whined, “you’ve got quite a- ah- mouth on you”.
His white-blond hair was far from its usual pristine state, much like the rest of Draco’s body. He looked completely debauched and Harry couldn’t get enough of it.
And it worked. Harry felt the wall around him, he saw the room around him. His memories refused to reveal themselves, refused to manifest. He saw Draco in front of him, the look of equal parts shock and joy on his face. And he smiled. And the wall remained.
“You did it”, he repeated again, almost yelling, “oh, Harry, you’re incredible!”
, Harry wanted to say to him.
Draco’s eyes widened and he made brief eye contact with his mother before she lowered her eyes. A million questions raced through his mind. He’d never told his mother that he knew, that he knew as surely as he knew his own name, that it had indeed been Potter they had captured. He had been too afraid of Narcissa’s response, too afraid that she still believed in the Dark Lord, too afraid she would reject him and he’d lose the only thing he had left in his life. It occurred to him that Narcissa had kept the same deed- saving Potter’s life- a secret from him for the same reason.
“Trust me, Potter”, Malfoy replied slowly, confidently, “I know how to have fun”, and then he winked at Harry and turned around to walk back to the fire.
Harry smirked, and then removed his fingers.
Harry paused, not quite sure how to continue. He wanted to be honest without coming across as condescending, or- god forbid- like he was trying to therapise him.
“Harry, please”, Potter said and motioned for her to stay seated, “may I sit down?”
Conciliatio and just about everything
“I mean,” Harry said, “you’re definitely a power couple.”
“Was that rude?” Marcus half-whispered, half-mouthed, glancing down at his offspring.
“His dad told him that Remus attacked Sirius and bound him to him, well, Sirius got bound to Remus and couldn’t escape and that was obviously an evil werewolf thing, and that was why Sirius excommunicated or whatever.” Harry scrunched their nose. “I mean, for one, that’s not true at all, because Sirius tried to disown himself, but the Blacks never made it magically or legally binding, but, whatever, the point is that if the rest of the magical world pretended like queerness wasn’t, you know, a thing, the purebloods did it in spades. Full on cone of silence. Except for when they had to try to explain why the heir to the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black wasn’t coming around anymore, which, you know, throw in some homophobia and werewolf hate. Why not.”
“For computers?” a girl with glasses added.
Then Blaise arrived, Draco pressed handouts with the general outline of the event into their hands and
Luna fought a sigh. “Either he’ll understand that you’re a good person doing a good job with plants and things and also trying to reform someone who at the very least is slightly prickly and might even still be a blood supremacist, but it’s not entirely your job, anyway, or he’ll be offended by something that’s not even real, and he’ll leave.”
He was cute like this, all rosy and contented, with Harry’s red beanie undermining the rather gothic effect of the rest of his outfit. Draco took his arm again, and Harry’s brain stopped working for a moment.
Draco retreated to the depths of his armchair and crossed his arms.
“The Lees have attended this school since 1374,” Addie said. “And every last one of them has been a Slytherin.”
He tilted his head to watch the petals.
Astoria shook her head, and then said brightly, “It’s been so nice having the iPod, Harry. We’ve spent a lot of time listening to it. It was really thoughtful of you to bring to Draco, and I’ve sort of shoved in and monopolized it. But your playlists are so good.”
“You know, that actually might work?”
“I want to see what your magic feels like.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Is Susan—”
“So he’s out then,” Astoria said in a flat voice.
Draco pressed his lips together.
Draco’s eyes snapped open.
Harry coughed.
Cho narrowed her eyes. “But then she would know it’s dangerous?”
Harry scratched their cheek.
Because, fuck it.
The words echoed through Harry’s head all night and into the next morning.
“Ms. Black,” Narcissa said. “I would expect an auror to know that Azkaban dissolves marriage bonds.”
They glanced back out across the dance floor.
Harry heard himself gasp. There it was, in black and white. Published. Written.
◻ boots: cotton swabs, nail clipper, concealer, deodorant
“Do you remember Blaise?”
Right, Harry thought, and turned to the folder again.
“Well, I know it’s not what you’re used to—”
At least that was progress.
“Ms. Black,” he said, wrapping his hand around her wrist, “and I will be in the shed.”
Harry had been searching around for a nice jumper. He ripped off his pajamas—shutting Malfoy up effectively, he noted—and assembled a decently nice outfit. Of course, Malfoy was wearing a soft burgundy cashmere sweater, but we weren’t all made of money (or class, his brain added unheeded; Harry did have a vault filled with gold, but no inclination to acquire fine knitwear). But charcoal grey chinos and his latest Molly Weasley jumper (strangely in emerald wool) was passable. He gathered up his gifts for Teddy and Andromeda and beat Malfoy to the door.
“Harry Potter is dead!”
He looked completely and utterly debauched. Harry loved it.
“Can I come in?”
“Not only do you need to concentrate, you need to build a wall around your mind, a wall so strong that nothing can penetrate it, metaphorically speaking of course. Do you follow?”
“Fuck”, Harry agreed.
“No longer speaking in hypothetical terms, are we Potter?”
” Draco cried, “right there, fuck, right there”.
Sirius Black falling through the veil, feeling his body jerk as he wanted to lunge forwards, follow him into the unknown, because a world without his godfather wasn’t one Harry wanted to live in.
Harry laughed, pulling Draco in for another kiss. For a second all the built up tension seemed to melt away as their lips met once again, and it was sweet, but it all came rushing back in an instant when Draco shifted once again and their cocks brushed together.
And he paused, considering what he was about to offer.
“Bold of you to assume I have any interest in any of them”, Malfoy replied in his infuriatingly calm manner, refusing to move from the spot and show submission. He always spoke calmly when he knew he had the upper hand in an argument.
“Sir, does that mean I will be working alone? Millsworth won’t be back for another week.”
“Harry Potter is dead!”
Draco got up, resuming his initial position. Harry tried to prepare himself. He felt better.
“Is this you admitting defeat, Potter?”
so he tried a more complicated lock-breaking spell.
, something stirred in Malfoy’s heart. And his cock. He was being fingered, after all.
“So fucking beautiful”, Harry murmured against Draco’s pale skin. Draco bucked his hips again as Harry continued lapping at his nipples, enjoying every sound he could elicit from Draco’s mouth.
, along with
Harry sat down on the bed, watching Draco in front of him, beginning to explain.
“What, were you expecting a tux? I’m sorry to disappoint”, Draco quipped, as if he had read Harry’s mind.
He thought about the past days.
In Draco’s seventh year he knew he was on the wrong side, and he found he could not switch.
Draco also did not complain; in fact, when they were done, he’d mentioned how much he’d liked the sauce.
There was a knock on the door.
He snorted.
Again.
“Say it”, Harry urged him.
The kiss was wild and raw and messy. Both moaned and held onto each other as if for dear life.
“Potter”, he urged again, breathless. Merlin, he needed something to satiate his thirst for touch, his hunger for The-Boy-Who-Lived.
So he said, “I should go”.
Narcissa’s eyes, previously focused on her book, shot up to meet her son’s. Draco thought he saw a flash of hope flicker in her eyes, but it died quickly as they turned to ash once again. He made a gesture for her to stay, and got up to walk to the door.
In Draco’s fifth year at Hogwarts he’d realised the restoration of the Malfoy name was up to him.
The next two days followed the exact same routine. They’d work well to break down the curses of the cave, and when it came to taking a break they’d bicker throughout its entirety. It was never actually serious, more of a competition to see who could rile the other up more.
Harry had expected him to be skinny, gaunt almost, but he wasn’t. In fact, he was muscular, but densely so, and his skin was taut over his lean, long legs as well as his stomach, where a little trail of hair (just as white-blond as the rest of him) lead down to his leaking cock. Harry peppered kisses all over his neck, relishing in the little whimpers he got in return, and when he felt hands on his back and neck he caught Malfoy’s lips in another heated kiss, giving him an experimental grind to the hips.
“Potter”, he whined, letting his head drop back against the wall.

“Besides”, he continued after Harry hadn’t said anything for a while, “my cock is bigger than yours”.
Draco looked at his wand in Potter’s hand, almost incredulous. Potter cleared his throat lightly and extended his arm further.
his kisses were, how
And so he did, and as Harry tried to infiltrate Draco’s mind he felt the resistance, he felt the wall Draco had been talking about.
The reply came roughly a day later.
Potter paused. And Draco took the wand. He almost wanted to shut the door, to say
Yet Draco was still surprised when he opened the door to be faced with none other than Potter himself.
And again.
Malfoy lifted his head to look at him once more, studying his facial expression.
Figuring he wasn’t in any position to be denying the saviour of the wizarding world anything, Draco motioned for him to come in.
That was his excuse for continuing to follow Malfoy, to seek him out when it wasn’t necessary. What once was clearly hatred when they looked each other in the eye had morphed into something else, equally intense, but Harry couldn’t place it.
Harry wasn’t too sure he needed it to understand how Occlumency worked, but something within him made him agree. Maybe it was a need to give Draco reassurance, maybe he wanted to show him that he cared, too.
“Does that feel good, Draco?” Harry teased, “do you like feeling my fingers inside you? Bet you wish it was my cock instead”.
“Anything, Draco”, he reassured him, although he strongly suspected he knew what Draco wanted.
That constant repetition of Harry’s surname drove Ron insane; he didn’t know how Harry could possibly put up with it, but his friend seemed to show no signs of backing down. Ron didn’t know whether to think
“Harry James Potter, you insolent bastard!”
, fuck, you’re going to drive me insane”.
He had no reason to come back. His business there was done.
He sent the letter off, and surely enough even before he went to bed the following night, his owl returned with a reply.

, he told himself, over and over until it became a mantra he couldn’t get out of his head. Even when Draco whispered
On his way home he made a realisation, one he’d been dreading to make. He was attracted to Draco Malfoy. He wanted him, in every way. And seeing him face his boggart like that had nothing but solidified that.
“You’re not protecting yourself correctly. You need to get a feel for the resistance you need to build up. Why don’t you-”
. Long, silver ropes shot out of his wand and wrapped around Harry and pulled him towards the wizard.
Harry nodded, but then something crossed his mind.
And for the first time since the war began, it truly felt like things might get better.
And so he raised his wand and whispered, “
“You don’t need to apologise. She’s like this most of the time”.
Harry wasn’t too sure he needed it to understand how Occlumency worked, but something within him made him agree. Maybe it was a need to give Draco reassurance, maybe he wanted to show him that he cared, too.
? Are you mad? I made a tactical error that has nothing to do with being arrogant and everything to do with assessing a situation!”
Draco’s voice was soft and calm. It occured to Harry that this was the first time he’d ever heard Draco speak without an edge in his voice. It was surprisingly pleasant, listening to him talk.
Draco walked over, sitting down beside Harry on the bed.
“Fuuck”, he moaned quietly.
And so he did, and as Harry tried to infiltrate Draco’s mind he felt the resistance, he felt the wall Draco had been talking about.
As he spoke he reached out to cup Harry’s face with his hands, his eyes wide in amazement and joy. Harry saw his pupils dilate as they stared at each other once more. Draco, now blushing furiously, quickly withdrew his hands.
“I came to reap what I sowed, Potter”, Draco finally said, his voice back to his haughty, usual tone, “since you so boldly stated you, and I quote you on this,
“You’re aroused”.
“Draco, use the spell, I know you know it!”
“Harry Potter is dead!”
Narcissa nodded, and Draco too sat down in the third armchair of the room. It was the only furniture in the room; in fact, it was almost the only furniture in the entire manor.
Potter made his way towards the living room once more, Draco grabbing his arm before he got there.
“You undoubtedly ensured my victory in the battle against Voldemort”, Potter continued, and both Narcissa and Draco winced at the mention of His name, “and I had to come here in person to let you know that I truly appreciate that”.
Harry nodded.
”. Harry set up every imaginable protection charm around them, including a weather repellant one at the end. He proceeded to set up their tent and its interior, making sure their equipment was all there and organised, before stepping back out again. For a moment he paused, and he was struck by the memory of the months he spent with Ron and Hermione hunting horcruxes. He recalled how incredibly awful it was, the tension, the anger, the
He was interrupted by a peck on the mouth.
His hole clenched around Harry and that’s all he needed to be thrown over the edge too. He thrust a few more times into Draco before collapsing on top of him.
He felt the heat gather in his face as he realised what he was listening to: and he really didn’t need to hear any more about his friend’s cock. Or Malfoy’s cock. Or anyone’s cock. Merlin, it was the first time that all he really wanted is to immerse himself in his Herbology textbook.
“Potter”, Shacklebolt said, “if only you could arrive this punctually as well.”
He wanted to run his hands along every bit of that gorgeously smooth skin, wanted to kiss Malfoy’s lips until they were pink, he wanted to hear him moan and whine and
Narcissa formed the beginning of a sentence, but burst into tears before anything coherent came out. She rushed out of the room, ashamed, overwhelmed.
“I’m never going to master this”, he huffed, frustrated with himself, “I told myself I wasn’t going to let anyone in. I’m not afraid. So what am I doing wrong?”
lets go watch malfoy in the corridor

“You can’t do it.”
again,” Britney said in a conciliatory tone, examining her split ends. “We didn’t really discuss the themes or literary content in depth, so, like, there’s a lot still to be said about such a rich play.” Elspeth looked disgruntled. Harry knew there was an essay about Shakespeare on the O.W.L., and he didn’t trust Malfoy’s interpretation of the Bard.
BETRAYYYED
, because that damn owl with the black envelope was closing in and she wasn’t ready to take Sirius’ word for it that Draco’s life was in danger. Her son would say something if he needed her. But the letter hit her as it fell from the owl’s claws, darkness enveloped her, and now she was struggling against white silk bonds in the middle of a pentagram in Walburga’s sitting room.
Rubbing his forehead, Harry groaned. “Why does anyone bother with Amortentia anyway? It’s Halloween, it’s not Valentine’s Day.”
Draco piped up now and again but seemed content to let the two of them chatter away. Pomona couldn’t tell how much he understood. He’d been passable at Herbology, but it had never been his passion—smart, but hadn’t applied himself. At least not in her class.

“Oh, they are,” Hermione said. “But Jason is trying to drag at least one corner into this century.”
Somewhat unfortunately, he chose to use the hand that had been holding the towel, and things got drafty.
“Hey,” she said. “Don’t be worried. They’re all really accepting. Especially Harry.”
⊱ ────── {⋆
“You made these?”
“Astoria,” Hermione said, shoving the papers at Draco and taking Astoria’s other hand. “I’m so, so, so sorry.” Her eyes were bright with tears.
Draco bit his bottom lip, but the smile crept out.
“Cool,” she managed. She closed her eyes.
“Ass like you, Malfoy,” he gasped. He’d be damned if he didn’t finish his insult thanks to an ill-timed flashback. Piña coladas, Potter, imagine the maraschino on the end of the paper umbrella. And the tiny slice of pineapple. Maybe he could kill Malfoy and flee. Just him and a beach and tiny cocktail umbrellas.
readers can always rely on us to ask the question on every magician’s lips: Is Potter single?
“I have to keep stirring this damn risotto, but like, say your piece,” Andromeda said. “I assume this isn’t a social call.”
We sat down over beers and Ljutenica, an aubergine-tomato paste, spread on bread and topped with cheese, to discuss his sexuality.
“Where is it?”
Right, Potter. Stop objectifying your colleagues.
Harry shrugged. “Still counts, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Ok,” Neville said after a searching look. He stepped away from Blaise, who suddenly found that he had to lean against the doorframe. Neville’s brows drew together, then he gaze flicked to Draco and back to Blaise, and then Neville was kissing him, hard and fast but sweet.
Of course she had a boyfriend. Or a husband. They were getting to be that age.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Can’t we just send him the seeds? Do you even have the equipment to measure compressive strength?”
If Malfoy had been flirting with him, then Malfoy was interested, and if Malfoy was interested, then Malfoy would want to be close to him, and if Malfoy got close to him, then he could figure out Malfoy’s syllabus, and if he knew Malfoy’s syllabus, then he could put Malfoy in this same awkward position of having perfectly planned a lesson and having it blow up in his face with a swift, “Sir, Professor Potter just taught us about the Cold War. Yes, sir, all of it. In great detail and with great nuance about the complicated relationship between the United States and Russia and the proxy wars in the global south.”
Dear Neville,
“Fine,” Sirius said. Her bonds still tied, he jerked her to her feet, held out one hand to Hermione, who shrunk the blackboard and the tome and crammed them into her pockets. Narcissa felt the familiar jerk of Apparition.
“Funny, because it’s actually Black shit.”
“I don’t know if I’ve ever passed, not really,” Draco said eventually, his tone serious. “Maybe for a bit at school, but since then, it just seems stupid to cut bits off yourself to fit into a box that you don’t even like. I mean, here,” he gestured around at the classroom, “it’s all professional, of course, but I’m quite sure my students intuit my preferences.”
Harry blew him a kiss.
☇ figure out if mood rings are like real/magical
“Thank you,” he said softly once they were out of the shop. “I can pay you back when we’re at school again.”
Harry felt a blush creep up his neck and onto his cheeks, and he was thankful for the dark.
Like the broken record of a waking nightmare the memory replayed itself over and over until Harry was back in Draco’s room again, finally. He was breathing heavily, the sound of Voldemort’s shout a terrible tinnitus echoing in his head. Draco was breathing just as hard, his skin damp from a sheen of sweat. His eyes were closed and he was trembling slightly. Instinctively, Harry extended his hand to Draco’s shoulder, steadying him with his touch. Draco opened his eyes, and a single tear rolled from his left eye to his jaw, dropping onto his bedsheet.
When he was satisfied with his work he reconnected their lips, and their kiss became more forceful, more heated, and Draco’s hands found themselves at Harry’s side, pulling his body flush against his own.
He opened the door and was faced with Draco. Contrary to his expectations, he wasn’t overdressed at all, wearing an emerald green turtleneck and simple black trousers.
Draco also did not complain; in fact, when they were done, he’d mentioned how much he’d liked the sauce.
Harry’s arms found their way around Draco’s body and they embraced each other, melting into a warm hug.
comments & kudos are greatly appreciated <3
protection, not
“Draco”, Harry said again, trying to at least get his attention from afar. Draco turned his head slightly, his ear facing Harry.
before casting another
“Fuck, Harry, I-”
And then the scene disappeared and Harry was back at Hogwarts, an army of Death Eaters standing before him, Voldemort leading them to face the fighters on Hogwarts’ side- on his side- and he realised Draco was amongst them. Voldemort spoke, and it was just as Harry had remembered: arrogant, his voice drenched in the illusion of victory.
“-but it’s not the arse of a top. You sure that you have nothing to concede?”
They’d since moved to the much more comfortable sofa in front of the fireplace, both mostly staring into the flames. Harry told Draco about how Sirius Black had once managed to communicate with him through the flames of the Gryffindor common room’s fireplace.
Draco simply nodded, and led him back to the door. Without another word, Potter left.
“Potter”, Draco said with a curt nod, no less surprised at Potter’s second visit than he was at his first.
Ron nearly choked on his own saliva. Now that was something he wasn’t expecting to hear, but he wasn’t quite disturbed enough to back away. After all, knowing Harry and Malfoy, this could still end in a fight.
“You’re not going to deny it”, Harry whispered, “are you?”
for Harry to finger him, it was too much to ignore.
“You’re such a drama queen”, he grinned.
“But Parkinson-”
A flash and he repeated it.
He’d once taken such pride in being the son of Lucius Malfoy, the heir to the Malfoy estate, and the purest of wizards in his mind. But as the years went by the façade of honour and greatness crumbled quickly; his father’s eyes sank impossibly far into his head, surrounded by dark blue rings which stood out especially against his sickly pale skin. For the better part of the last three years, he’d looked awful. The more Draco watched his father’s fruitless attempts at pleasing the Dark Lord, the more he realised that Voldemort’s faith in his father had disappeared.
With a
It was already going a lot better than it had gone with Snape trying to teach Harry. But he still struggled and after a second or two of holding on he felt his mind pouring out as memories flashed in front of him.
Draco’s chest was rising and falling rapidly with each breath, his entire chest was tinted a delightful shade of pink, similarly to his cheeks. His mouth parted and he emitted little whines with every thrust.
. It also struck him how different he felt in that moment. He was comfortable. He realised that he felt
And he loved it.
“No I didn’t think it was going to be cursed I just-”
Draco’s eyes widened and he made brief eye contact with his mother before she lowered her eyes. A million questions raced through his mind. He’d never told his mother that he knew, that he knew as surely as he knew his own name, that it had indeed been Potter they had captured. He had been too afraid of Narcissa’s response, too afraid that she still believed in the Dark Lord, too afraid she would reject him and he’d lose the only thing he had left in his life. It occurred to him that Narcissa had kept the same deed- saving Potter’s life- a secret from him for the same reason.
In the two weeks following Potter’s visit Draco and Narcissa had told each other the truth, the truth about how each of them had concealed Potter, and it felt good to be honest. Their lives continued with little change.
“Mm, more than”, Malfoy replied. Then, weighing his options, more quietly added, “want more. Please”.
Never in his life had Harry felt the way he did as they moved their lips together.
“I have a case”, Shacklebolt said matter-of-factly.
What had started out as a debate on the very
For a moment, they were silent, both too breathless to say a word. Harry pulled out of Draco, who hissed a bit at the cold air, and effectively collapsed on top of him. It then hit him that he was now lying chest-to-chest with a layer of Draco’s spunk between them, but he was too tired to be bothered. Harry fumbled around for his wand, found it, and cast a simple cleaning spell. They were warm and dry, and it couldn’t have been nicer for either of them.
A few years ago there had been a lot. When their rivalry bore no actual weight, before it was burdened with the lives of dozens. Draco had never understood why Potter would choose the poor Weasley boy over him, over power and pride. After all, Draco had been brought up to believe that those were the most important things in life and that they came with blood status. So he’d spent his childhood resenting Potter for rejecting his hand on his first day at Hogwarts, resenting him for rejecting the values he thought to be the only ones that mattered. He’d spent his childhood settling for negative attention from Potter, figuring it would be the only way he’d get it at all.
“Wait, stop”. Harry retreated immediately.
But that had been years ago. The war had divided them cruelly and Draco had stopped hoping to ever get on better terms with Potter even before he’d realised his feelings. That he was on his doorstep now threw a wrench in the works.
“Apparate home”, he says to Malfoy, who had been silent the entire time. He nods.
In an effort to make themselves as small as possible, they had not left the safety of the manor in weeks.
here, with Malfoy, standing in front of a cave dripping with dark magic.
“You did it!” Draco gasped.
, Ron asked himself as he kept his ear pressed against the door.
Harry yells “
“No I didn’t think it was going to be cursed I just-”
“Oh, Draco”, he sighed as they broke apart to breathe.
A small huff of a laugh escaped Malfoy.
He scribbled his signature and sent the letter off to Malfoy Manor before going to bed for another fruitless attempt at sleep.
They’d since moved to the much more comfortable sofa in front of the fireplace, both mostly staring into the flames. Harry told Draco about how Sirius Black had once managed to communicate with him through the flames of the Gryffindor common room’s fireplace.
It was a strange sound to his ear, his voice so guttural. On the other hand, Malfoy seemed to enjoy it: the faint, white-blond hair on his arm stood up as he shivered slightly. They still weren’t touching, as if any move could ruin this careful balance between them, right on the verge of breaking the unspoken agreement of hatred between them. Arguably they’d already crossed that line, Harry mused, considering he was eyeing Malfoy’s now hard cock, watching a small pearl of precum form at its tip.
“Fuck, Harry, Harry, Harry”, Draco chanted, his knuckles turning white and a drop of sweat running down his temple.
Draco’s cock was heavy, rosy-pink, and bounced slightly against his stomach as Harry fucked him. It was leaking precum; Harry decided he would taste it one day.
He was overcome with a sudden understanding of his feelings and it felt like a tidal wave of emotion crashing over him, enveloping him in the warm, salty water, pulling him forwards against Draco, their lips crashing together.
“I came to reap what I sowed, Potter”, Draco finally said, his voice back to his haughty, usual tone, “since you so boldly stated you, and I quote you on this,
Now that was unexpected. Draco raised an eyebrow, waiting for Potter to explain himself.
, Ron thought as he tip-toed towards the wooden door. Wand perched firmly in his hand, he placed his ear right next to the coarse wood as he listened to their conversation.
“Off”, he demanded as he unbuckled his own and stripped naked.
stop, you git”, Malfoy snapped, but he sounded (and looked) far too fucked out for Harry to take him seriously. His hair was messy, his chest rising and falling rhythmically with his heavy breathing. He was gorgeous. If his hard on wasn’t nearly pulsing in his hand, Harry could have stared forever.
“I told you we should have called for backup. I told you and you
Draco was still grinding down on him, the need becoming almost unbearable for both of them. Harry reached for his own wand from his back pocket, vanishing their trousers and pants with a swish and flick.
Silence once more.
spot, the one that was so hard to reach by himself, the one that sent him so bloody close to the edge that he just managed to breathe:
Malfoy sighed when he heard a cap flick open, and though Harry’s arm had been released from his waist, he pushed his hips up further anyway.
Harry continued walking as Malfoy backtracked into the wall.
“Point is, Potter, I know you can do this, even if it takes work. I’ll help you get there. It’s the least I can do after-”
They looked into each other’s eyes, and Harry opened his mouth to say something when Malfoy interrupted, “I know the things she did at Hogwarts, you don’t need to remind me”.
Harry held out his other hand and mumbled something against Draco’s lips, and out of his night-table a bottle of a clear substance flew into his hand. He popped open the cap and poured a generous amount into his hand.
As he spoke he reached out to cup Harry’s face with his hands, his eyes wide in amazement and joy. Harry saw his pupils dilate as they stared at each other once more. Draco, now blushing furiously, quickly withdrew his hands.
“Don’t act like you don’t like this better”, he replied, and he wasn’t quite sure where the confidence came from. Just to prove his point, he shifted in Draco’s lap. Draco drew in a sharp breath in response.
“Not so bad yourself, Malfoy. I’d still top.”
Malfoy turned around to sit down by their now extinguished fireplace and asked, “what were you going to say?”
“I love it”, Draco said quietly, as if more to himself than to Harry.
“This wall, it has to be strengthened by will, not fear. You must
“You’re so pretty”, Harry uttered breathlessly, “knew you’d be even prettier when you’re fucked. If only you could see yourself, Draco, how pink your cheeks are, how your chest is rising and falling as fast as I’m fucking you. If only you could see your pretty cock, so hard and begging to come. Why don’t you, Draco?”
“Harry, please”, Draco moaned, again and again and Harry wouldn’t grant him the satisfaction.
And then Harry finds his voice again and yells, “Draco! Draco, use
And when Lucius raises his hand Draco finally lifts up his wand and points it at his father. All that comes out is a whisper, but it’s enough.
No reply from Draco.
Harry scoffed. Now this was the Draco he knew; yet he couldn’t help a small smile creeping up on his face.
Finally,
“What the hell?
They both touched the Portkey and were sucked through whatever strange wormhole Portkeys created, then finally Harry felt solid ground underneath his feet again. Not only solid, but very wet as well. It was pouring with rain.
“Don’t be ridiculous”, Harry seemed to have found his voice again, “Let’s get back to our project, yes?”
protection, not
“I could hardly call it a job well done if I haven’t actually seen you do it, Potter”, Draco retorted, making sure to emphasise Harry’s surname.
“I like men too”, Harry finally said.
He lowered his wand in surprise.
They’d been given weeks for the project, and even Ron had finished a while ago. Then again, it wasn’t hard to imagine that Malfoy’s constant shenanigans made it hard to get any actual work done. It would be even less of a surprise if their teacher had denied the bitching pair to work in their classroom.
“I don’t know anyone nearly as skilled with it as you are”, Harry finished.
, now thin, white lines barely distinguishable from the rest of his skin. His nipples were hardened and pink, and Draco made a delightful sound when he brushed his thumb over one of them.
“Ironic, isn’t it, Potter”, he said, a red flush from the alcohol settled high on his cheekbones, “how we’re sitting here now. After all these years. I don’t even feel the urge to hex your face off.”
Walking up to Malfoy, Harry placed his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder softly. He knew it would earn him an insult if he simply interrupted. Malfoy startled slightly, and stopped speaking his incantations as he turned to Harry. They made eye contact and for a fleeting moment Harry thought Malfoy looked almost vulnerable.
looking into my mind, finding doubt. I was afraid for my life, for the lives of my family”.
Harry nodded.
He shouldn’t enjoy riling Malfoy up as much as he did, but he loved seeing his eyes light up as he hurled insults back at Harry. He loved getting a rise out of him, making Malfoy slowly lose his composure, watching his cheeks turn hot and blush, not even noticing that Harry only said the things he did to get him to react. Except he caught on just then, and within a second he was back to dangerously calm.
“Er, thanks”, he finally managed to stammer, gesturing for Draco to follow him into the dining room.
And he wanted to see Draco laugh. He wanted to see him giggle so hard he would hold his sides and couldn’t breathe. He wanted to see Draco be fascinated, be excited by new things he discovered and old things he was passionate about. He wanted to see Draco feel, see him as he truly was.
He came back balancing two plates of pasta and two wine glasses and with a crooked smile.
He said nothing for a second, simply looking into Malfoy’s eyes, still trying to decipher what Malfoy was feeling in that moment.
They were standing next to Harry’s bed, the textbooks and parchment paper on his desk seemingly superfluous now as they stared intently at the other. Harry’s brain hadn’t caught up to the moment, what was meaningless banter a minute ago was now quite real, and Malfoy’s teasing comments were now quite real as well.
“Please, Potter, don’t be a git. Just”, and even though he couldn’t see his face, Harry knew he was blushing, “please, your fingers, anything, I want something inside me”.
“You’re afraid”, he simply continued, “of someone like-”
“Another”, he said, and gasped as Harry did so.
“I don’t know anyone nearly as skilled with it as you are”, Harry finished.
Truth be told, Harry did not want anyone seeing the horrors he had seen. Anyone who was in the war knew it was awful, to say the least, but there was something about walking into the Forbidden Forest, something about looking around at the dimly lit trees, thinking it was the last thing he would ever see. It was a horror he couldn’t subject Hermione to, and a horror that was too personal for him to ever trust an instructor with.
“Potter”, Draco began, then hesitated again.
“Hmph”, Draco grunted, “don’t know”.
Harry reached for Draco’s cock with one hand, stroking it quickly, and oh god it was too much, it felt so good, and Draco was so overstimulated from Harry’s constant pounding into his prostate and his touches and just about everything about the situation that was turning him on impossibly much.
Steadily he pulled out almost all the way before slamming back into Draco, picking up an almost brutal pace.
“Fuck off, Potter, let me sleep”.
With a cry, Draco came, long ropes of come covering their stomachs. His abdomen clenched along with his hole as he rode out his orgasm. Along with the look of pure bliss, of complete euphoria, on Draco’s face, it was enough to push Harry over the edge himself.
Rematerialising in front of him was the Room of Requirement, fire chasing up a pile of furniture, flames licking at tables and chairs, devouring everything in its heat. Then he saw Crabbe, clinging onto a chair desperately, losing his grip and falling into the fiendfyre. The last thing he saw was the fear in his eyes, the terrible, awful fear that Harry knew all too well, the type that only came from knowing you were about to die.
In Draco’s fifth year at Hogwarts he’d realised the restoration of the Malfoy name was up to him.
“I’m sorry if it doesn’t live up to the gourmet meals you usually eat after work”, Harry mocked, only realising afterwards that he perhaps shouldn’t have admitted to knowing Malfoy’s habits after work, but Malfoy didn’t seem fazed.
Malfoy nodded, then turned back to the crates and cages in front of them, all filled with creatures. They’d found a notebook detailing all orders and contact details, including crate and cage numbers along with their corresponding creatures.
for him in that moment.
. He wanted to devour him. Harry’s skin was burning with desire, and steadily, he watched Malfoy fall apart beneath his tender touch. But oh, if only he knew how
“Fuck, please, Harry”, Draco whined, “please, let me come, I’m so hard, your cock feels so good inside me. Please, oh
Harry decided he was going to go to his favourite muggle club as soon as he was off work. Miraculously, he’d had so little paperwork to do that he finished an entire hour before his shift ended. He’d spent it very productively, watching the clock slowly indicate the passing of time. His lucky bastard of a partner, Millsworth, had been on holiday the past week, so he’d been in his own company during that time, mostly working at his desk. He longed to get back into the field as soon as possible.
Draco sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose; Harry had seen him do it before, in the Great Hall at breakfast before an exam. He knew all his habits, how he behaved when he was angry, when he was frustrated, when he was upset. Harry knew all of Draco’s
his vision went black.
Harry found himself mouthing along with the monotonous sound of the clock hanging above his office door.
The chest opened. And out stepped Lucius Malfoy.
Drawing in a sharp breath as he felt the cold liquid, the blond released it right away in a long sigh as Harry gingerly pushed one finger into him. They were gentle, so
“Can you teach me Occlumency?”
And he paused, considering what he was about to offer.
Potter made his way towards the living room once more, Draco grabbing his arm before he got there.
, he told himself, over and over until it became a mantra he couldn’t get out of his head. Even when Draco whispered
Draco looked at him, now actually incredulous.
Until Harry Potter showed up on Draco’s doorstep for the second time.
Harry paused, not quite sure how to continue. He wanted to be honest without coming across as condescending, or- god forbid- like he was trying to therapise him.
It ate him up on the inside, wanting so badly to be faithful to his name and his parents while knowing it wasn’t right. The only thing he could do was feign uncertainty of Potter’s identity when he was right there, right where Draco was stood in that moment, not two months later even though it felt like a lifetime. Because looking into Potter’s eyes had solidified what he’d been trying to suppress; that he didn’t want him to die. Not only that, he cared. He cared about Harry Potter and he wanted him to defeat the Dark Lord.
So Harry added another finger and fucked him harder. His own neglected cock twitched, but he disregarded it in favour of focusing on Draco. He brought his other hand back to Draco’s nipple, rubbing his thumb over them, trying to angle his fingers to find-
But Harry, Harry kissed like a Gryffindor, he was wild and reckless, like he couldn’t get enough of Draco. He also wasn’t stupid, and so saw right through Draco’s attempt to get on top of him. It only motivated him to place his hands on Draco’s chest and push him back into the sofa, straddling him. Draco’s eyes went wide, pupils blown.
“What, were you expecting a tux? I’m sorry to disappoint”, Draco quipped, as if he had read Harry’s mind.
No reply from Draco.
He leaned down to plant a messy kiss on Draco’s open mouth.
His obsession had grown- and been reciprocated- over the years and as he came to grow up way too quickly he learned of more nuanced feelings. He learned about crushes and found that the reason he never understood Crabbe’s interest in fit girls was because he didn’t fancy girls. And he’d come to understand that perhaps Goyle’s descriptions of his feelings regarding his female crush could be applicable to boys. And then he’d finally come to understand the reason behind his craving for Potter’s attention. And then he promptly pushed the thought aside because it made him feel nauseous.
“Draco”, Potter said, equally cautiously.
fuck me?”
In Draco’s seventh year he knew he was on the wrong side, and he found he could not switch.
“Do you want a baby?” Draco blurted. This seemed directly at Neville, not her, so Pomona just basked in the awkwardness as her favorite former student turned crimson and sweat began beading on his brow.
He took an anti-nausea potion (not for emotional distress, Potter, really), and tucked himself into bed, resolutely thinking about lesson plans for next term.
“What?” Harry hissed again. “Why didn’t you bring this up before? This might have been,” he exhaled through his nose, “helpful and relevant information.”
Harry bumped up the volume with a wand swish, tucked his wand behind one ear, and went to fucking town. He twirled around Malfoy’s chair, dropping low and rising up, making sure he stuck his ass mostly at Malfoy and not at Minerva. Only one of them had asked for it. Or kind of asked for it.
His world narrowed.
Malfoy, dressed entirely in tight black Quidditch leathers, awkwardly straddled his broom. There wasn’t enough room to turn back around and fly out the floor-to-ceiling window, but he was just standing there like a lump.
Then she bobbed her head a little bit, seemed to forget she was holding a teacup and attempted to clap, spilled tea all over herself, and started laughing. Minerva sent a drying charm her way as she sat.
Harry was still clutching Malfoy’s pale arm. He couldn’t breathe. This was so awful. His parents had died trying to protect him. Malfoy’s dad had tried to kill his own son, just because he liked men.
Did she just wink at him?
Blaise fought the urge to purr.
“Do I write ‘fucking bairns,’ do you think?” he whispered, almost without moving his mouth.
ya wot
Remus bent his head and allowed Sirius one long kiss.
Draco waved his hand. “Joke, Potter, let’s move on.”
clarke-rodriguez.j@mom.gov
“Oh, no, no, don’t grow up,” Marcus mumbled, kissing her head. “No, no, no.”
“Only you, Kreacher,” Sirius said, “would turn a compliment on your cooking into some kind of threat.”
Definitely banter, but was it flirtatious?
Lavender plopped down on the couch, spilling a bit of wine onto her jeans. “Drat.”
Five minutes later, the second-year slipped past him with a squeaky, “Professor Potter!” and rushed off down the hallway.
“You feel bad?” Hermione couldn’t keep the incredulity out of her voice. “You spoke on Malfoy’s behalf on his trial and made a huge deal out of the fact that he lied about recognizing you at the Manor, which, like, was it really a mistake because you looked fucked up, and he was an accomplice to torture, and like, Harry—”
“Oh, shit, sorry,” Harry yelped.
“The internet?”
“My costume is pertinent to my field of teaching. Unlike whatever this is,” he said, waving his hand at the glowing Malfoy next to him. Malfoy’s white-blonde hair was slicked back and glistened softly in the candlelight. His cheekbones sparkled, and his long white robe was so low cut (really, thought Harry, they were at a school), that Harry could see the delicate blue veins that spread across his chest. Even his collarbones glimmered with a gentle blue effervescence. But it wasn’t just makeup, Harry realized, as he looked down at Malfoy’s hand curled around the goblet. A few centimeters of the air all around him glowed with a soft grey light.
“Yeah,” Neville said, dog-earing the page.
“Eh,” Harry said. “It was awkward the first few times and like, it would have been nice to have a fucking warning, Nev, but—” he sighed. “He’s actually kind of funny.”
He didn’t invite Malfoy to the WAWFAN meetings. Malfoy would have to talk to him first. He’d have to show he’d changed. Harry couldn’t reach out. Malfoy had to be the one to cave.
“Oh,” Draco said.
“But an invisibility cloak?”
“Aren’t you going to Ron and Hermione’s soon? I’m sure you could borrow some of her books, and she probably wouldn’t even notice,” Malfoy would say, looking up at Harry through his lashes.
“Which is why you’re having Christmas morning with him. And why he’s sleeping over at our house. And why he’s been the subject of most of your recent letters.”
“I’m also teaching at my old college,” Harry said with a laugh. “We’re both lame; it’s fine.”
“Potter, don’t you think you should ask them first? Before inviting—” he gestured to himself, “a former Death Eater to their home?”
?????
“This isn’t, uh,” Ron said. He was holding his chocolate ice cream (well, his chocolate and Seville orange ice cream with a swirl of bittersweet fudge, and a chocolate waffle cone, because Ron was a chocoholic, God what a gross word though) with a concerned expression on his face.
He caught Neville’s eyes on his abs, and, gratified by the way his gaze had glazed over, smiled broadly.

“Ooh, rainbow, like us,” Neville said with a grin as he held his hand out.
He pulled a rack of toast towards himself and began eating steadily and voraciously, pouring copious amounts of ketchup over his scrambled eggs and fried tomato. None of the other young professors came to the Great Hall for breakfast, preferring tea sent to their rooms, but Harry loved a full English.
“It concerns both of us! And I told you what Ron said to me!”
Then they both tried to talk at the same time, then lapsed into an awkward silence.
“So—” Harry gathered their hair into a bun. Which meant that they were thinking. Which usually, in Remus’ experience, was going to mean something that at the very least, would be complicated, and at the most, would be dangerous. Often for completely righteous causes, Remus would be the first to admit, but sometimes he wished Harry would just rest on their laurels.
Draco let his head fall back against the armchair and groaned.
The owner of the magical world’s premiere gay club dashed back into their office, shut the door, and did a little dance of joy. Things were all coming together.
“I’ve definitely won this one.”
After another round of sherry, Harry said his goodnights and flooed back to Hogwarts. The remnants of the cross feeling prickled at the back of his eyes when he sat in his room, staring at the fire. He grabbed a wooly hat and his broom and kicked the big window open. A good flying session would clear his head.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose again. “It’s not that complicated, Potter. Look, the next time we’re in London, we’ll go to the British Library. I’ll show you. It’s really not that difficult. You can probably find loads of interesting muggle things for your course, too,” he said, almost as an afterthought.

It had been lovely listening to his grandfather’s wild tales of the wizarding past—magical past, he reminded himself, while handing Harry a raspberry ripple caramel cone—but as the years went by and he got closer and closer to eleven without having so much as a blip of magic, things became less sunny.
He stood and cracked his neck. “I’ll blame you when it all goes tits up, ok? Shall we get back out there?”
“You didn’t sleep sometimes! You’d just watch his dot on the map! When he was in his dormitory!”
“Me, yeah, I’m so dramatic.” He stared down at her finger.
Harry huffed. “Fine, maybe, whatever.”
“See what?”
Harry rested his head against his door for a long time before he finally went into his room.
Oh. Yes. They had talked about that. Kreacher had hobbled into the kitchen from his tiny cottage at the bottom of the garden because he staunchly refused to leave Master Black—even though he’d been Mr. Lupin for oh, six years, five months, and zero days, but it must have been more like six years and four months and some change on that day—with news that the tapestry had unraveled the silver-threaded shackles from a certain Draco Malfoy.
Thank God she’d fallen in love with someone who was good with his hands.
“No, it’s absolutely not real,” Fleur said. “It’s clearly a Weasley delusion.”
“Oh, no, not him,” Val said, “the Malfoy boy. He’s trying quite hard.”
“So, er, when I was in Auckland, I was working in the Parata lab, which primarily focuses on the magical properties of the native plants of Aotearoa. And a lot of those are ferns.”
“What are you, then?”

Draco started grinding again. The rasp of the pestle against the mortar seemed to calm him.
Draco caught him staring. He didn’t roll down his sleeves.
Susan kissed her.
“I brought scones,” she said and set the box on the table.
“If he even insinuates that my curriculum is unnecessary or if he steps one toe out of line, I’m not holding back, Minerva. Things have changed.” He slammed his hand down on the table again. The noise echoed throughout the Great Hall. A lone elf polishing the crest on the fireplace squeaked.
, he told himself over and over. Ron and Hermione hadn’t written him back. Tangled in his sheets. Sweating. His hands hadn’t stopped sweating. He ripped his pajama top off. He rested his head against the window. It fogged. The Black Lake shimmered in the moonlight.
“Hey, good morning, come in.”
“She can hardly be hiding another criminal nephew.”
It started gnawing at him when Malfoy didn’t show up to dinner. He couldn’t stop jiggling his knee. Addie summoned an unused napkin and levitated it towards him. Harry gave her a confused look and she rolled her eyes.

“Oh my God,” Sirius said, shifting from foot to foot. “Do you think they’ve kissed yet?”
Remus nodded and sipped his coffee. “We’ve heard this one before,” he said to Harry, who was busy buttering their slice of Dutch baby. “I ruined his academic career with my cheekbones, blah, blah. Didn’t stop you from figuring out the highly advanced Magic needed for the Animagus transformation, though, did it?”
“I don’t want to know what he’s done,” Talbott shook his head. “As long as he doesn’t get expelled.”
“Greg is also a baker?”
“Bit weird,” Ron said.
“I saw your face in a crowded place,” he stretched out the last word as he reached for his towel, hummed the words he forgot, “there must be an angel with a smile on her face—” he wrapped the towel around his hips, put his glasses back on, and opened the door—“when she thought up that I should be with—”
He finally saw Draco at dinner in the Great Hall on New Year’s Eve. He seemed a bit paler than usual, but maybe it was just the voluminous ink-black robes he’d drawn tightly around himself.
Astoria laughed, then went back to crying.
Malfoy shifted towards him. Harry didn’t know what that was about, but he was done with this sympathy nonsense, so he leapt out of the chair and pretended to be interested in the plaque on Malfoy’s mantle.
“I suppose.”
“I mean, if they came to Hogwarts, they’d know immediately who you fancy.”
“I’ll write them now,” he said.

“Unlike you, it doesn’t take me ages to mark things.” Malfoy shrugged. “Natural intelligence, I suppose.”
Draco huffed a little. Harry saw his breath crystallize into the night air. “Fine,” he said, and squished up against Harry. “Just hold onto me and I’ll set the pace.”
Draco didn’t sit down. He stood in the doorway with his eyes watching her every movement.
“Yes, Professor Malfoy?” Harry said sharply.

“I’ll beat his tiny snake ass, too,” she said and glared at the letter. “I don’t know if it’s tiny, technically, and the snake was metaphorical, you know, because I don’t know what a snake ass would look like on a human, because a snake has a tail, but you know, Slytherin’s symbol—”
“Just brought you some ice creams,” Florian said, ducking inside before any of the paparazzi camped out across the street could rush towards the building.
“No, I was showing my support by arriving on time.”
“So I wanted to discuss a few of the projects I’d like to complete before then, and see if there was a particular one you were interested in.”
“Merlin, you’re obtuse.”
He laughed at his reflection. Same wild hair, same thin-rimmed round glasses, same scars. Same tall, skinny frame—he was now suspecting that he’d never put on weight, despite a heavy diet of treacle tarts and steak and kidney pie since he arrived in August.
He scrambled to the door and opened it. Malfoy practically fell into the room, but didn’t pause in his irate gesticulations and verbal tirade. “Potter, we are going to be late, how can you be late, oh, Happy Christmas,” he said, holding out a small, wrapped present. “But you can’t open it now. You’ve got to wait until we’re at Andromeda’s, because I was going to give it to you before but now it’s practically nine and Teddy’s going to be absolutely exploding because I’m sure he woke up at five—”

“What, no?” Harry said. “Watch this.”
In the same modulated tone, he continued: “I was a shitty kid, I know that. I honestly thought I was better than everyone else. I teased people mercilessly. Neville, the Creevey boys, Ron, Hermione. I believed it then, that the Malfoys and purebloods were superior. But then my father started weaponizing his approval and I knew it was wrong. I knew those views were not only incoherent but also evil, but I couldn’t stop. If I would just do one more thing for the Dark Lord, if I could just—
“So,” Bill continued, stretched one arm around back behind Harry on the couch to touch Fleur’s hair, “Have you seen Malfoy lately?”
Malfoy shut his mouth, opened it again, and came back with, “That’s a singular example that disproves my second point in only one instance. You usually don’t give a shit.”
Harry stuttered, “Uh, no, maybe next time.”
“Oh, yes, of course,” she said with a shrug. “It wasn’t that hard because it’d tried to attach itself to someone who’s already got his eye on someone, and then I grabbed it before it managed to latch itself onto anything vital.”
“… two sugars?”
“Happy new year, Lavender,” Parvati whispered.
Dean shook his head, which sent his short dreads out in a fan. “Didn’t know, mate. Didn’t know until he got well pissed one night and I’d brought him back to our flat—we were roommates, remember—and then instead of going to bed, he grabbed me and insisted that he needed a cuddle, so I was like, well, alright, whatever, and then when we woke up in the morning—” he broke off and stared at Seamus, who’d just lit a trayful of shots on fire—“it was like we’d always been together. Kissing him just felt … right.” Dean tipped his head back and took a long pull from his beer. “Like all the pieces of the universe had just slotted together.”

But Draco moved a bit too fast for Harry’s leg, and the hood of the invisibility cloak caught on his neck before the rest of his body could catch up, and then he was falling, pushing Draco to the ground accidentally as they were tangled up in a cursing, yelping heap.
The judges circled his cake, making notes on clipboards. They were muttering. Not one of them smiled. The oldest lady—Edna Mortis, sixty-four, soft spot for almond flavor, marigolds, and cats—picked up the knife, cut into it, then placed the knife back down on the table.
Hermione coughed. Sirius stalked away, towards the window. Good.

“It’s true, not all of us are blessed with your lanky physique. Some of us have lifted weights occasionally in the past eight years.”
“Harry.” Hermione locked eyes with him. “I really think you should read it.”
“Luckily her curses died when she did.”
“Oh, bother,” Audrey said, handing her cup of tea to Talbott with a sigh. “The little ones have woken up.” She rose and padded out of the room.
Astoria choked. Wine spurted out of her mouth and dripped down her face.
“What? No, don’t be stupid.”
“No,” Harry said, lifting their head and then dropping it back down again.
“Tell me what Blaise told you,” Harry said, leaning over Malfoy. He could be intimidating when he wanted to be.

“It was like she was shining from within, glowing with this kind of righteous rage, and then she came and wrapped her sweater around me, and it was like this mantle of calm descended over us.” Luna paused and rested her head on one hand. “Of course, she was still infatuated with Harry.”
“Yeah, well, I am a whole bisexual wizard. That’s why I started the club in eighth year. It didn’t exist before, even though there’s been quiet meetings of gay witches and wizards for, God, centuries, probably. These kids need to know they’re not alone. Minnie used to sponsor it, but I’ve taken over now that I’m back.”
Talbott barked out a laugh. “I believe Dr. Malfoy has done more than enough to mend his previous errors. Though I’m not too sure about the several chapters on poisons in the copy of

“It’s New Year’s Eve, champers!” This was a trainwreck. “Woo! 2007!”
“‘Mione!” Ron called from the kitchen. “Do you want tea or coffee?”
“Oh, no, no, no, there’s no suspicion that they’re bringing it to Hogwarts. Probably took it off to London or something to try to sell it.”
“He’s a Lupin, technically.”
Malfoy tutted and said, “Since your sense of fashion seems to be permanently stuck in some kind of teenage grunge phase, I just thought I could offer my services.”
“Did you just—”
“Thanks.”
Neville couldn’t tell if he was joking or if they ate rats in Azkaban. Draco was still so opaque, except in moments of high emotion. He just said the weirdest shit in the most casual tone and then became really intense and earnest about things like biscuits and certain plants and that one chicken they’d seen that had a fringe that covered its eyes.
He fiddled with the collar of his sherwani—it was a bit crooked somehow, maybe he’d wrinkled it—and rolled his eyes at the reflection in his bathroom mirror.
They saw the Oliver-Winger home, dark and quiet among the snowdrifts. Creeping up on the left side, Draco stopped abruptly. Harry bumped his chin into the back of Draco’s head and cursed.
Fixing him with her bright, sharp gaze, she said, “Malfoy’s gotten better. You know, he apologized to me when we were getting the luggage out of the boot. About the Mudblood thing. About lots of things, really. Ron and I weren’t sure about this, but we wanted to give him another chance. Because you seem to like him.” She paused in fluffing a pillow.
Draco opened his mouth, tilted his head, closed his mouth, tilted his head a different direction. He took the iPod out of his pocket and then said unconvincingly, “It’s out of battery.”

Shit, Malfoy was in his armchair and Harry was wearing a towel.
Harry held up his hands. “What, what, what?” They were following the syllabus exactly, and this week they were doing Shakespeare. Were these the sixth years? No, no, there were Justin and Perry arguing quietly in the back of the classroom, and Elspeth was definitely a fifth year. She’d been coming in after classes to discuss the Muggle Studies O.W.L. since the second day of school. She was positive that since she’d been born into a wizarding family in Hong Kong, she was doubly disadvantaged regarding British Muggle life. Harry had tried hinting to her that she needn’t worry because he was the one who’d rewritten the O.W.L. for the Ministry over the summer and therefore knew the test backwards and forwards.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah, whatever, like they ought to learn French, too.”
Astoria felt Draco’s entire body stiffen. He began edging away from her. She tilted her head and squeezed his hand.
“But it turns out a lot of the magical ferns don’t necessarily follow the sporophyte/gametophyte cycle,” Neville said. “Parata’s 2004 paper demonstrated that several species of these ferns seem to have multiple genders beyond what we term male/female and also have, er, strategies of reproduction beyond what one could, in human terms, call heterosexual.”
Dear Mr. S. A. U. Lupin,
“I just—” Harry sighed. “I’m not ready.”
Oh, it was the kitchen. He gestured to one of the mismatched chairs grouped around a pitted wood table. She sat down, keeping her bag on her shoulder.
Hermione started giggling and Ron held his fist out to Malfoy, who looked confused, until Ron coached him into a fist bump.
“You should come over for cake,” Hermione said, sliding one hand down Ron’s neck and perching her chin on his other shoulder. Her hair tickled his ear. “I’ve always wanted to get to know you better.”
“I’ve been seeing someone,” he managed in a hoarse whisper.
Filius was complaining about graffiti in the Ravenclaw boys’ bathroom. Blink. Owain the Groundskeeper brought up the dangers of the escaped Flesh-Eating Slugs, to which Hagrid raised a valiant defense that had Harry questioning whether Hagrid believed in containing any kind of dangerous animal, which seemed like taking Gryffindor courage a bit too far. Patrick broke in and said he’d had several kids with facial disfigurements and a curious unwillingness to discuss the circumstances of their injuries in the Hospital Wing, which, to him, strongly suggested that the fucking bairns were throwing them at each other.
“Fine,” he said, his gaze fixed firmly on his bonds.

Draco drew his head back a bit. “I beg your pardon?”
Draco hummed.

Romilda Vane began brewing love potions while at Hogwarts, in what she now says was an “extremely misguided at best, and potentially abusive, misunderstanding of the power of chemically-induced manipulation of desire.” In our interview last month at Vane’s laboratory, she shuddered after this sentence. “It could have gone so, so badly.”
She shook her head. “I’m sure you met the others at the interview, but they’re all great. Well, they’re professors. But they try.”
According to Merriam-Webster, asexuality, as it relates to humans, is “not having sexual feelings toward others: not experiencing sexual desire or attraction.” Weasley says this captures his experiences.
“May I?” Harry said and Malfoy nodded slowly. He pushed Malfoy’s hands up onto his own shoulders and grabbed what should be Malfoy’s waist (don’t think about the abs, don’t think about the abs) on both sides.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows and smirked. “Padma seems to have left already, Potter.”
“What?”
God, he always forgot they were related until shit like this happened.
Please respond at the earliest possible date with several dates and times that you, Mr. Malfoy, and your solicitor would be able to meet.
“Just, uh, Andromeda,” Neville said, slowly moving his hands to his sides. “Just something like, he can hike in. I’ll go grab some boots from the shed.”
The next morning, Harry was hanging about the Floo waiting for Hermione and Luna when a dark-haired figure crashed through. Unfolding herself to a height of barely five three, even in a four-inch heel, Pansy Parkinson brushed ash from her pencil skirt and surveyed him through dark glasses.
Malfoy hung behind Minerva the entire time.
𝔪𝔬𝔱𝔥𝔢𝔯𝔣𝔲𝔠𝔨𝔢𝔯𝔰
“What?!”
Ah, last year still rankled, Remus thought with a smirk, remembering how he and Andy had carried the day against the three of them. Kreacher muttered in discontent, but said, “Fine,” and marched into the study.
“How could you imagine that I’d do such a horrible thing, auntie?”
“And now, the prize for best cake—”
“Messing about’s alright,” Harry said finally.
Ron didn’t have time for this kind of defeatism. It was the morning of the fête. The morning of the fête.
Ron nodded.
“You know what I was reading,” Luna said dreamily, “couches used to be a place of female sexuality, deviant, of course, but there was this theory that women who had male visitors would entertain them on the couch in more than one way, which of course led to the development of this trope of women masturbating on couches—”
They were both silent, watching the hubbub and commotion of the party swirl around them.
I reviewed the incident with Peggy, who was on desk at the time, and she said that you were extremely embarrassed, confused, and contrite about what happened at the library last Friday, indicating that what happened was clearly an accident. In the future, I would strongly recommend turning the volume off or wearing headphones before playing any video. Otherwise, books with the call numbers beginning 306.7 (sexual relations) might be a good place to start your research. As always, if you need help finding resources or have research questions, our staff is always available. The library is a safe space for all kinds of (quiet) research.
As the opening beat of Akon’s ‘Smack That’ began to thrum through the air, he smiled down at Malfoy’s platinum blond head.
Harry laughed in an attempt to cover his exhaustion. Eight hours of daily lesson planning all summer hadn’t left him much time for flying. He’d just sprinted up a whole flight of stairs. He waved his hand to the left. Malfoy set off, nodding to the portraits along the way. The oil-painted figures whispered and tittered. Harry loped along the corridor until he was shoulder-to-shoulder, well, shoulder-to-mid-upper-arm, with Malfoy.
Florian Fortescue had grown up spending summers in his grandfather’s ice cream parlor. Florean. He was a Florian. Because the nurse didn’t believe his mum.
“It’s fine,” Remus said, gulping down a mouthful. It tasted fine. He took another sip. It was definitely fine?
“Always pessimistic, Chang,” Ollie said with a quirk of his eyebrow. “Was it growing up in Ireland in the 90s?”
Draco looked up at him through his lashes.
“I could see your potential.”
“Well,” Susan said, holding her arms out until Astoria deviated from her journey towards the fireplace and hugged her, “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll fight Malfoy for your hand.”
They were so close. He could see the dark flecks in Draco’s grey eyes. He could feel his own heart beating in his head. Draco’s pink tongue peeped out and licked his lips. He was radiant in the torchlight. The brightest thing in the dark hallway. The brightest thing in Harry’s heart.
“Well, no,” Andromeda said with her mouth full of toast. “But if Neville wants it, it probably does something.”
⭒ the risk. The risk.
Harry prayed,
Harry rolled over. “Pride month is exhausting.”
◼Expand range of wedding cakes offered
The rest of the party passed with a few more beers, a few more pieces of pizza, and a few more desires to touch Draco’s hair. The latter were not indulged.

“It’s not like she can get very far,” Hermione said with a shrug. “She is wearing stilettos and we’re in a craggy grassland.” Sirius put his hand to his temples.

“Why are you here?”
Harry, suddenly feeling very hot, tried to take his sweater off but ended up with it stuck somehow on his glasses. But he didn’t really want to leave his sweater cave, so he pretended he couldn’t understand what she was implying about him and Malfoy, and said in a muffled voice, “Yeah, it’s fine, he’s a friend, I guess.”
“Oh, Ronnikins,” George said, pinching his cheek. “Our delicate little one.”
“I, er.” Ron blushed, then soldiered on. He was going to make this happen. “I just want you to feel welcome.”

Harry shook his head. “Don’t worry about it,” came out rather gruffly.
Draco started fiddling with his pocket watch. “Here,” he said slowly.
J. Clarke-Rodríguez, Department of Continuing Education
“Yeah, that wouldn't be a half-bad idea. I always thought the Ministry was like, behind the times.”
Neville was blinking determinedly at his tea.
Kreacher grinned. “It is the book of the same title, published in 1985 by Professor J. P. Miles of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Magical Division, and put out by the Oxford University Press.”
Cho snorted. “She has your genes. You’ll wish she was lazy. Imagine when she can walk.”
His heart started pounding in his ears. He was going to be eternally barred from the Ottery St. Catchpole fête. Years of Weasley triumph ruined. He shouldn’t have expected anything else.
“So he’s coming up this weekend. I tried to make the cottage a bit more … sophisticated? He was in Prague for a few years after the war, and I don’t know what he’d think of—”
“As you know, the professorship for History of Magic has not yet been announced. Since Cuthbert had been with us for over forty years before we convinced him to retire this past May, we have had some trouble finding a good match for the school.”
Draco Malfoy
Probably because that murder reminded him too much of his own goddamn life, Harry almost shot back, but he bit his lip. “Ok, well, let’s try something different.” He levitated copies of the play towards them. “Everyone take a copy and we’ll do a read through—Perry, you’re Hamlet for the first and second act, and Shuo, you’re Hamlet from the third to fifth; Justin, Ophelia; Elspeth, Gertrude; Britney, Claudius; Isla, Polonius; Oscar, Laertes; I’ll hand out the rest of the parts as they come up. I’ll do the stage directions.”
She noticed Pansy and broke off.
She moved behind him. He didn’t want to breathe. He could smell the sweet waft of her perfume and a woody, spicy smell, and then she was ripping his shirt up and putting one hand down the back of his pants and—
“‘And I haven’t been able to find a single phellodendron, even though I’ve spent hours looking and even more hours trying to train Draco to spot one’—Draco?”
Malfoy’s face shuttered.
“Don’t forget to click your heels after the feast, Helga, and it’ll take you right home,” he said with a smile and a subtle flick of his wand that would transport her back to the Slytherin dorms when she tapped her ruby slippers together. Helga’s parents had tried to get her out of Muggle Studies before the term began, but her effusive letters—and Harry’s weekly packets of her Outstanding class assignments—had apparently done their work to decrease their blood purist bigotry, at least a little.
He reached one small hand out, and one of the glowing animals bowed its head and sniffed his pudgy fingers.
“Good job, darling,” Andromeda said with another wink. “He’s been beating off the ramblers with a stick all summer.”
They all looked at the baby, who had crammed the bread lion’s head into her mouth.
“We could, you know, go shopping together,” Harry found himself saying. “So we don’t get the same things. For Teddy. We could go down to London or something and do a magical and Muggle shop—I always try to get him some of each—and God, we could get you to a Muggle bookstore so you’d shut up and stop bothering me about the Tana whatever her name is …”
Late Sunday afternoon, stuffed with Ron’s French toast and locally-sourced bacon, Harry and Malfoy stumbled out of the Floo in the staff room at Hogwarts. Padma looked up from her marking and said, “Nice romantic weekend away, boys?” to which Harry scoffed.
Neville Franklin Longbottom
“It wasn’t like he was born like that. He did evil magic, and then, poof, goodbye nose. Divine retribution for evil. Or something.”
Harry inhaled and tried to remember his meditation tactics.
No, he could see that one of them was smaller, like a doe—Harry was filled with dread. Snape’s patronus was a doe. Did Malfoy still admire him?
“Crude sexual talk always cleared Narcissa out,” Sirius said blandly. “It was worth a try.”
“Oh.” Fleur’s heart sank.
“No?”
There was a brief silence, and then Malfoy piped up again with some other nagging criticism about Harry’s red pen, and Harry gave up. He’d just sit here with Malfoy needling him all day doing absolutely nothing. That was fine. It was fine. Getting nothing done. Fine. But he didn’t have to just sit there and take it, so he went on the offensive.
A week later, a tawny owl tapped its beak on Blaise’s window. Recognizing Neville’s crabbed handwriting, his heart sped up—one day it would be pure excitement, untinged with dread. One day.
Harry wanted to crawl behind the divan and die.
1:04 pm, July 25, 2007
Malfoy made some kind of noise (disapproving, Harry assumed), and looked down at Harry’s chest again. Then he reached out and removed a prawn tail from where it had been caught by the embroidery. His mouth was attempting severity and disgust, but his eyes crinkled.
“You’re going to be a good dad,” Draco said. Ah, it was a glare of intensity, not animosity. “When it’s on the menu.”
“I believe Professor Malfoy is referring to one of my more, uh, practical lessons regarding contemporary Muggle life,” Harry said smoothly. He pushed his chair away from the table, stood, and shrugged out of his robes before stalking over to stand behind Malfoy.

“I wish I had that line,” Harry had said in a thick voice. Their green eyes shone.
I know you’re super busy with your fancy new job being the youngest badass professor and all that stuff, but I had a research question for you. Probably better discussed in person, but the basic outline is: one of my wards is locked in a sanguine marriage contract signed at age 7 but the other party doesn’t want to marry him because she’s a lesbian, one/both of them might die if the contract is broken. It’s not Harry; James and Lily weren’t that fucked up.
Harry blanched and gestured towards Draco, hoping that he’d take the heat for his terrible idea.
Malfoy straightened his sleeves. “I hardly think pre-groping is appropriate at a school dance.” He cleared his throat. God, maybe he
*~///evil drugs ////~ and their street names
One morning, when Harry was puttering around in his boxers trying to find the small jar of magical pomade Andre had gifted him (“From me and Perc and Ollie, don’t worry about it.”) in his dresser—honestly, Kreacher thought he had a better organizational system than anyone and it just didn’t mesh with Harry’s mind at all—a cold wind blasted across his shins.
Hagrid’s birthday rolled around on December 6. The celebrations were myriad—his first years all teamed up to eat an entire rock cake he’d baked, four third-year Hufflepuffs made him a stuffed version of Fang, his O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. classes pooled their money to buy him a new pink umbrella for “days out with Madame,” according to the card. The professors brought Madame Maxine in on an international Portkey. The Great Hall was bedecked with Gryffindor banners (probably the only time it would be that year, thought Harry ruefully; without Dumbledore’s annual points bonanza, they sank to a dismal fourth place). Hagrid, hand in hand with Madame Maxine, sobbed as the elves levitated a huge cake with “HAPPEE BIRTHDAY HAGRID” written in green icing (Harry had let them in on the inside joke) and Minerva had to lend him a handkerchief. He blew his nose so hard that a nearby firstie fell over. Luckily Malfoy was there and propped Helga back up, patting her on the head in a rather avuncular manner.
Teddy gave him a suspicious look before whispering something to his new stuffed dragon and handing Harry his broom. They traipsed back down the hall towards the kitchen.
Sirius Alphonse Umbertus Lupin, Esq.
Want to saturate yourself in the songs I listened to while writing and all the historically-accurate early 2000s music referenced and also look at a graphic/cover I made?
“Wait, what?” Harry whispered. He didn’t want to be rude, but this just didn’t make any sense. “Your entire family are …” he trailed off.
Was he trolling him? Was he being serious? Harry made a little tetchy noise in his throat. “I can get more the next time I pop down to Edinburgh.”
“Uh, yeah, whatever,” Sirius said. “Artichokes?”
⚬ explain research, our theory
Neville Longbottom pushed his fists deeper into the pockets of his Barbour.
“Charming.”
“Uh, ok. Then there’s the glowing bog bean seeds.” Neville paused. “So Hendercronck’s working on the compressive strength of native seeds and wanted to know if we’d be able to provide some numbers on the seeds we have.”
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” Harry hissed the minute Justin had dragged Perry away from the biscuit plate.
“Draco!” she yelled immediately, hoping her son would respond. His face appeared in the cottage window and she lurched towards him, but, her fucking feet were tied, so she fell over.
“Penultimate Christmas Eve,” Bill said.
Malfoy stood half-collapsed against the door with his blonde hair hanging down in front of his face for a few seconds, then, with a sudden flash of movement that had Neville gripping his wand, he tossed his hair back and straightened up.
Malfoy gave him an odd look, but complied, sending a patronus galloping across the room. Harry couldn’t see what it was, other than a large quadruped—Abraxan? Thestral? Unicorn? All three seemed fitting in different ways.

Potter pulled a hair tie off their wrist and pulled their hair into a messy bun. “Gotta get to work,” they said with a wink as we finished our meal. We’ll be right behind you in the fight for equality, Harry!

“The dancing’s been really fun.”
Harry groaned. “Look, first, he’s one of Teddy’s only living relations, and it’s really hard to grow up without anyone related to you, even if you’re kind of adopted by one of the best families in the world,” Molly looked mollified, “and two, I’ve been working with him for like six months and he hasn’t done one shit thing. Not one. Like, he’s still kind of an arse, but just in a normal, prickly, posh way. Not in like, an evil, fascist way.”
Eyebrows were being raised.
She grinned, squeezed it, and said, “Always lovely to meet another Slytherin.”
“Shit,” Astoria said, leaning back against the pillow. “Great.”
Totally unruffled, he turned back to glance at Draco, whose white-blonde hair glowed the long beams of light that penetrated the Great Hall.
Harry sat down on the edge of his bed, turning Draco’s present to him over and over in his hands.
Don’t even let it be a question.
Just like the ones Harry had conjured during their heated discussion of the B&E.
“I just,” Harry mumbled, “I feel bad.”
And then she opened her eyes again.
Her face went serious. “Harry.”
Over the course of several cups of tea, they poured over the bound volumes of the greenhouses’ history and specifications, reviewing the most dangerous plants (the carnivorous plot in Six that resisted all forms of magical and physical destruction) and areas (first years were under no circumstances allowed in Five, since the wild magic from the lingorous petunia massacre of 1963 still lingered).
“It’s fine,” Harry said. “How’s your sandwich?”
Harry grunted and turned his attention back to the pitch.
Blaise glanced up, then started biting his bottom lip.
Neville took refuge in his tea.
“Can I have another whiskey?”
“No, it is.”
Audrey summoned four cups of tea and settled in on the floor, leaning her cheek against her husband’s knee.
At Draco’s face, she clarified, “Remus is a GP.”
Harry struggled to sit up, but Malfoy pushed him back down with one finger.
“Ok, great, let’s go.”
“Bertie?”
Harry stuck their tongue out.
“What?” Draco whispered back, his eyes wide.
He had royally fucked up.
“Was a snake,” Astoria interrupted. “I don’t need you to Huffsplain my own house mascot.”
Malfoy hummed and tightened his thighs.
Suddenly, Harry realized that he stank, like, well and truly reeked. God, he should have taken a bath earlier. Malfoy was sure to turn his nose up at any Potter-related stench. He could try the new cologne Cho had sent him last Christmas. Come to think of it, he rather suspected that it was a re-gift from Theodore’s unwanted Christmas presents. He always sent them a nice box of Honeydukes. But the heavy cut glass chamber contained something that seemed to change scents every time he opened it. Hopefully it wouldn’t be too bad this time.
, invited to Potter clique events, speaker at Hogwarts’ graduations. So her father relented and her mother recanted.
The knight held out the pumpkin with a plaintive helmet tilt.
Harry narrowed his mind and hopped to his feet, crouching on his broom and extending his arms.
Hermione and Sirius exchanged a look.
Harry rested their head on hers. There was a nice silence, a comfortable silence. “You smell nice,” Harry said at last.
Harry found himself back at the prawn bowl. It wasn’t even a bit lower. That was a challenge. And there was a new kind of sauce.
perc said it looked like a lecture or like ….
“Right,” Harry said and put it back down on the table. Then they sprang up, cracker in hand, and said, “I’ll come sit next to you and it won’t explode.”
Ok, so he definitely wasn’t going to be dangerous about it. Though after an aborted few weeks of auror training, and with a good two hundred pounds on Malfoy, Neville knew he could handle him in any kind of a fight. But it was still a relief.
You heard it here first—Conciliatio is coming to Diagon Alley in June 2006! Potter says the location will allow them to offer more services for the organization, which fights for an end to discrimination based on gender, sexual identity, heritage, species, and/or disability in the magical world.
He shot a piercing look at Blaise, then turned and followed Neville, without a single comment. Blaise stood in the doorway. There was a warmth suffusing him that had nothing to do with the growing heat of the day.
She hung the phone up and skewered Sirius with her glare. “You have twenty-three minutes before that pizza gets here, Draco comes back downstairs, and you’ll have to present him with a very good fucking explanation.”
Fleur tossed her head. As if that didn’t just oh so casually bare the side of her neck.
“Don’t interrupt me, Malfoy.” Harry spat. “Just because you don’t think gay kids matter doesn’t mean that you can stop me or spread your blood purist homophobia at Hogwarts, because this is a safe place for all, and—”
Harry tipped their empty glass at her. “That’s a damn fact.”
“Odd!” Molly practically shrieked. “He’s a Death Eater, Harry!”

He and Ron stared at each other for a few beats longer than socially acceptable. Hermione cleared her throat.
“Ta,” Harry said again. When did he start saying ta? Aunt Petunia would shit a brick.
Malfoy’s eyes were wide with innocence and—oh shit. Too much innocence. Too much fucking innocence and he’d fucking planned this. Malfoy pressed his lips together, but he couldn’t stop the corners of his mouth quirking up in a shit-eating grin. Well, two could play at that game. Malfoy may be underhanded, but Harry had sass Malfoy could only dream of.
─────── ⎎ ───────
The Sorting passed quickly. Harry didn’t even notice who was sorted into his own house. That was Hagrid’s job, anyway; he was the Head of Gryffindor.
“Oh, is it that time already?”
Just for safety’s sake.
“Indeed,” Blaise rumbled.
“Reality was different, even then,” he said, and bit into the scone. He swallowed. “Fucking good scone. It was all a lie, you know. Lies, lies, damned lies.”
His head spun with the possibilities.
Draco sighed. “Potter, your father’s family is old wizarding blood. And rich, too, after Fleamont’s inventions.”
The client seemed quietly content with these plans. When asked how things were going, Draco said, “Well, it’s not what I imagined for my late twenties, but what I imagined doesn’t really appeal to me, anymore,” which I take as a positive sign of the extinguishing of blood supremacist views and a realignment of his internal worldview.
“I thought you were too much,” Harry managed. This conversation had veered off somewhere strange and he wasn’t really sure what these euphemisms were meant to euphemize. Was Malfoy coming onto him? “That’s what you said at the match.” Bolster that with some facts. Concrete facts.
The Black family had drama in its genes.
Harry laughed. “Pshh, Draco. Whatever.”
Hagrid, Audrey, Addie, and Padma all looked at him as though he were an idiot.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Really? Your facile distractions won’t prevent me from winning, Potter.”
She’d washed her hands of it when the revolution didn’t come, and buried herself in her books because that was where her power lay—a renewable power, that is—and she was the first, she was doing the best, she was working so hard. And Harry was doing what they did best: organizing and teaching and inspiring.
“Honestly, Potter! Do you know nothing about your heritage?”
￫ formulate contract counter ritual into article for publication (anonymized, ofc)
The deception you revealed to me via the means of this image manipulation program presents a serious threat to society, on par with the unregulated use and distribution of Polyjuice. Perhaps even worse, as this photographic deception process is far simpler than brewing Polyjuice. Are non-magical persons considering laws against this type of image tampering? The gorilla is one thing, but I can imagine far more nefarious uses.
But he couldn’t stop scratching his arm. Hermione grabbed his hand and glared up at him.
“Oh,” Draco said, his eyes round. “I suppose I ought to have explained. They’re a bit old-fashioned. And a bit …” He paused and considered his words, which made Harry apprehensive. He almost never stopped halfway through a sentence. “Posh, perhaps? Like, in my year, Blaise didn’t even have one. Pansy didn’t either. I think the Greengrass girls had them, but … they aren’t common, let’s say that.”
Since that day, Malfoy bothered him for Muggle murder mysteries. “I don’t know where to get them,” he’d insist, clinging to Harry’s latest Scandinavian blockbuster. He laid in wait for Harry to finish the books, and would pop into Harry’s classroom between lessons, or come knocking at Harry’s door in the evenings. “You’ve had it for ages,” he’d wheedle.
Harry laughed and updated her about their day.
“Merlin, no!” he gasped. He grabbed a nearby cup of tea, chugged some, and shook his head. “God, no, he’s just super affectionate with us. He can’t express much emotion at work.”
“Oh my God,” Marcus gasped, his mouth falling open. “She’s going to be a teenager.”
“My parents died when I was little,” Harry said, and then felt shitty for mentioning it. “But it’s nice knowing I look like both of them.”
“Right, right, now you can eat,” he said with a wave of his hands.
Perry hummed and shook his angelic head. “It just seems stupid to be attracted to only one gender.”
Padma smiled. “I’ll try to be kind, Audrey.”
“Did you denude its power?” Talbott said hesitantly.
The new plan regarding Malfoy was to act normal. To treat him like any other colleague. Well, not like Mervyn, who Harry actively avoided because the older wizard was a bit like Trelawney in his insistence on Harry’s current endangerment and mutterings about Fate and Star-Crossed Lovers Intertwining, whatever that meant. But like Addie. Or Padma. Well, maybe Padma was a bit too close. He and Malfoy would never be that close. But they did get to the point where sitting next to each other at meals didn’t start any disasters or spur Harry to drink more heavily than usual—God, maybe he should give up drinking—but they weren’t close.
What he did instead was cough and stand up. Pull his sleeves down over his hands. Bang his shin. Lurch over. Curse.
Andre quirked his lips and said, “I see,” in a pensive tone.
And then he saw the snitch.
He vaguely heard Starr say, “Ooh, lovely choice.”
mom employees arent gonna be like hey mate u want some gilly??!
Malfoy shifted in his chair.
“You’re an idiot,” Draco said gently. “And I am too. I couldn’t tell you to your face, not even after all these years.”
“Wait,” Narcissa said, “you translated air as blood?”
Harry shuffled through the papers. “Well, I hope you know you’re not getting this back,” he said eventually.
“You want some Goldfish?” Harry blurted, jutting his arm with the bag out towards Draco and Neville.
Malfoy hummed again, and let gravity do his work for him. God, his fucking—
“Just to be clear,” Harry said with a glance at Talbott. “You don’t want to curse Draco.”
“I’m going to get cremated, so it would save everyone a lot of time if you just incendio’d me.”
The judges exchanged glances, then started frantically scribbling.
“It’s called
Alina nodded at him and said, “I guess that is nice, then. My parents aren’t dead. Yet.”
Harry laughed and ran his hands through his hair.
“We found a suitable candidate in June, but due to his personal circumstances, he was not able to arrive until this evening with the students. The other members of the faculty and staff already know this, but I did not want to disturb you during your preparations for your first year of teaching.”
“Where are Sirius and Remus?” Fleur asked Harry, once things had settled back down and they had curled up on the couch. Harry understood that it was all a bit much. “Are they coming later? Or tomorrow?”
Ginny sighed.
Andre’s voice floated across the room, where he was clattering about with jars of pomade.
Vane has added other safeguards. “The very molecular structure of Curavi potions is destabilized by negative emotions, rendering their magical and chemical effects useless. These potions only work on what’s already there: emotional attunement and attachment are the necessary prerequisites to lead to any exploration of sexual desire.”
“I didn’t mean to make fun of you or put you in a weird position at the meeting today. I just thought you were trolling me, and wanted to give you a taste of your own medicine. I’m sorry if it was too much.”
“Well,” Minerva said slowly. “I think you might rather want to know who it is before making such assumptions.”
Flapping her hands, she continued, “We were all supposed to be mini cursebreakers. But when we entered the vault with the dragon in it—” Draco gasped—“it turns out she’d abandoned my brother inside a cursed oil painting! And then she left us to deal with this dragon, completely alone! Disappeared! Like that!” She snapped her fingers.
“I think it’s a contest?” Harry said.
Padma patted him on the head. “Great talk, Potter.”
“Will you sit down,” Draco ordered.
“Can I take this? I’ll read it later.” He was not going to read this book.
￫ plan wedding?!
Harry felt his world getting very small, closing in to just Malfoy’s tilted head and his slightly parted lips and—
“What?”
Malfoy didn’t look up at him. “That would be nice,” he said at last.
, Harry thought, the Minister of Magic himself standing outside of his door right as he was getting off work was never a good sign.
“Potter”, Draco said with a curt nod, no less surprised at Potter’s second visit than he was at his first.
“I’m sorry”, Draco finished, and Potter’s eyes flit back and forth between his own. They studied each other for a second, perhaps because they needed the familiarity.
Harry thought to follow him for a second, to try and convince him he could be open about how he had felt, to offer to talk it all out. But he realised that perhaps enough boundaries set up for self-preservation had been crossed for one day.
“Fuck,
“Harry, you’re-
“This will take a while to break”, Harry said to him.
Harry nodded.
“Be there in a second!” he yelled, turning down the heat on his stove, wiping his messy hands on the apron he’d borrowed from Molly- “for no particular reason, Molly, I just don’t want to have to wash my clothes every time I cook”.
“Potter”, he began, not quite managing eye contact, “I was afraid too, of
“Voldemort”, Harry supplemented, still catching his breath, “say his name”, he added more sternly.
It was why he’d looked into his mind.
and leave it at that, to shut Potter out of his house and mind for eternity. But he couldn’t quite do it. Too many things were left unsaid and so he looked him in the eye and replied.
“Shove off, Potter, it’s abundantly apparent that you say that purely because you don’t seem to possess taste of any kind, if your sense of clothing is anything to go by”, Malfoy sneered.
Once again silence fell over the two- well, three- of them. And for a long time, Ron didn’t hear anything. He debated opening the door, fearing Malfoy had hexed him, or vice versa, because given his childish chant, Ron honestly wouldn’t be surprised if Harry had. The silence continued, and no matter how closely Ron tried to listen, he couldn’t hear anything. Then he really did consider opening the door to check if both were still conscious. The choice was made for him, when he heard Malfoy speak up again.
A strange feeling settled in the pit of his stomach; it was a weird concoction of anticipation, excitement, and nervousness. He’d invited Draco over on an impulse, simply because he’d felt the need to keep the conversation going, not wanting it- and by extension their correspondence and interaction- to fade away.
Everything but their eye contact.
“You alright? I didn’t hurt you did I?”
“Mrs Malfoy”, Potter began, and Narcissa corrected him to use her first name with a small, wry smile.
Draco’s voice was soft and calm. It occured to Harry that this was the first time he’d ever heard Draco speak without an edge in his voice. It was surprisingly pleasant, listening to him talk.
Reluctantly, he agreed, and the pair walked into the cave, wands ready.
“I did it”. Harry grinned.
Harry suddenly realised he’d felt more euphoric at Draco’s warm, soft hands on his face than he did making progress in Occlumency.
beautiful”, Harry mumbled, and when he lapped his tongue at Malfoy’s hole experimentally, the latter whined, and an automatic “
“Why are you here”, Draco stated more than asked, being far too surprised to even comment on Potter’s use of his first name. He tried not to stare at the man before him. He wore a clean, grey t-shirt that revealed the several bandages on his arms. Although he didn’t look as awfully malnourished, Potter didn’t look well. Draco felt stupid for thinking all would be well for Potter and his friends just because their side had won. A wave of empathy overcame him and it felt strange to stand across from him once again, yet neither insulting the other. They were both too tired.
“Harry. Say my name.”
“Harry Potter is dead!”
and he was sure Draco knew his.
Draco whined again as Harry ground down his hips in emphasis, and nodded furiously.
“Malfoy”, Harry said after they’d found the main storage room and checked for any residue curses or enchantments, “thank you for what you did back there”.
And it worked. Harry felt the wall around him, he saw the room around him. His memories refused to reveal themselves, refused to manifest. He saw Draco in front of him, the look of equal parts shock and joy on his face. And he smiled. And the wall remained.
Minutes pass but time doesn’t, and they stand in each other’s arms until Draco stops shaking.
“Want you so much”, Harry mumbled against his lips as he covered his fingers generously.
“Malfoy what the hell are you doing here?”
In the two weeks following Potter’s visit Draco and Narcissa had told each other the truth, the truth about how each of them had concealed Potter, and it felt good to be honest. Their lives continued with little change.

“It’s a plant; does it have to do something?”
As if Harry ever took a break until they collapsed.
“I could demonstrate further sub-styles, rap, hip-hop, whatever. I’m no dancing fiend, but I do know a few moves.”
How did Draco always manage to do his head in? It was like no matter what Harry intended to say, or even said, Draco had his whole mind made up about the encounter and would twist Harry’s words around until he didn’t know what was happening and Draco could sink in his little fangs for the final kill. Honestly. Luckily, he was twenty-six and Draco couldn’t really ruffle him anymore.
Draco sighed. “It doesn’t concern either of us, Potter.”
Seven ginger heads whipped towards Harry. Andromeda, blissfully unaware of the commotion she’d caused, stepped into the Floo with a gentle wave. Harry tried to edge off his seat, but George had his arm in a vice-like grip.
“Ah, ye old Weasley dick. A blessing and a curse.”
One body roll, two body rolls.
“No,” Hermione said, “We’re going to fix this.”
“I used to do makeovers at school,” Andre said and chuckled. “I gave Audrey a makeover once a year, it seemed like. She was always getting into trouble and ruining something. Sweaters, shoes, hair … you know I had to make her outfit for the famous Puddifoot date?”
"Oh, yeah," Harry said, as though this hadn't occurred to him. "Cool."
There was a bit of tomato sludge on his chin.
It was Parvati.
“Ah, blaming the weather before we’ve even started.”
Harry groaned and dropped his head into his hands.
“It’s probably in your family vault.”
Have you asked Neville if he has an e-mail address? You mentioned in class that he has a computer, so he probably also uses e-mail. :D
uhhhhhhhhhhh
Harry bounced in his seat. “God, I can’t wait. Granger-Weasley babies, God, it’s gonna be dope! You’re going to be amazing parents!” He couldn’t contain his excitement and started excitedly slapping Malfoy’s arm, then realized that Malfoy would find this irritating, and stopped. But Malfoy was just smiling at him and shaking his head.
She shouldn’t have passed him the mantle.
This evening was fucked.
In Person
Draco looked up at her. His face was so flat. Not physically, she thought with a surge of irritation. His nose was pointy enough.
“Haha, yikes,” Harry laughed. “You’ve probably got a lot of time.”
“No,” Harry said firmly, “You gave it to me and I get to read it now. It’s mine.”
Harry pulled out his wallet.
Harry’s eyes widened, and then they realized Bill was joking and allowed themself a small smile.
He was looking odd again, Andromeda thought. Maybe she shouldn’t have sprung this on him before he went off to do something important.
There was some periwinkle there, anyway.
He paused, and then removed his hands from his hair only to smooth it back again. This also had no great effect. Malfoy’s light eyes followed his hands. He reached for his glasses and took them off—his last hookup had told him his eyes were more luminescent without them—and batted his eyelashes at the Malfoy-colored blob.
The rhythm of ‘Walk It Out’ had Harry bouncing around on the side of the dancefloor. Justin exchanged a glance with Britney, and they were pulling him onto the dancefloor and cheering. Harry weakly attempted to protest.
He’d rolled his sleeves up, and Harry was able to see the tattoo on his other arm. It was a bouquet of flowers—narcissus, lily of the valley, poppies, roses, lilacs, carnations, all tangled together and weaving their way up his arm. It must be a magical tattoo, Harry mused, as two tattooed bees drifted in and around the flowers.
“It is!”
“Huh,” Ginny said aloud and took the letter down the hall to the bathroom, where, sure enough, Luna had turned one of her eyebrows a shimmering green.
“Heart the size of a … thing. That’s a phrase. Isn’t that a phrase?” Susan wondered.
Talbott had one hand on the back of her neck, and he picked up the story, “Audrey spent her last two year at Hogwarts training, breaking into the cursed vaults and getting into a lot of trouble, and then she became an Unspeakable after graduation, right when I was training to be an Auror. But,” he said, with a painfully gentle look at his wife, “she doesn’t like hurting people, so after a year and a half, she went into cursed object reparation. Then Minerva approached her for the DADA position.”
They didn’t have to pay in galleons, anyway.
Cho sniggered into her bread. She considered them, and shook her head. “You’re doing good, Ol. Both of you. She’s lucky.”
“Here,” he said abruptly, dumping the pile on Harry’s desk.
“He’s just terrified her first word’s will be fuck which would be a a Sign that we are Bad Parents,” Ollie whispered back.
“HARRY AND DRACO ARE HERE, DROMMY!” Teddy yelled, wrapping his arms around both of them. “THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS!”
A minute passed. He grunted in belated response. Malfoy looked at him strangely.
Harry turned over the small silver case in his hand. He’d left Sirius’s—organizer, he thought, rolling the word around his in mind—in his dresser drawer, wrapped in a sock Dobby had given him.
“This whole tower is for the unmarried professors or, like, those who don’t want to live outside the castle, though I think Mervyn just sleeps in the Div classroom. We each get a floor. Padma’s on the top, then it’s Addie, Andre when he’s not off in Glasgow, then me, and I guess you’re on the bottom floor. Well, this floor. It’s not the ground floor. The stairs go up around the rooms. I think the castle expands if there are more profs who want to live here. Or shrinks, depending. That’s how the castle tends to work.” All this flowed out of him, unchecked. He was going to be strong and silent. That was the plan. But this was just information. Necessary to know so Malfoy wouldn’t end up in the wrong room and frighten the ladies. Though Padma and Addie probably had fiercer Bat-Bogey hexes than he did.
It was like they hadn’t taught him any kind of subtext analysis at Hogwarts.
“First, focáil leat, and second, I’m realistic.”
Three hours later, after a spirited argument with Filius regarding the relative merits of CDs versus the Frog Choir (“nothing can compare to the bass of synchronized croaking!”) and an off-key bellowing of Happy Birthday (to which Alina sat, smiling, with her fingers in her ears, before blowing out her candles), he and Draco had managed to conceal themselves in the invisibility cloak inside the Oliver-Winger’s front closet.
Draco listened—fuck, Harry had forgotten about the fingers in the mouth bit, that was a bit weird—and he closed his eyes and nodded along as the beat picked up.
“I’m holding you, though, so—”

“Harry,” Minerva called, “I was wondering if you could show Draco to the young professors’ accommodations.”
“Is there anyone else left?”
“I’ve tried to atone but know it will never be enough. If you don’t think I’d be a positive influence on the students, I accept that.”
“Marcus started last year, and now Oliver’s joining him. Because of the baby.”
And that’s when Neville got the idea. The very wonderful, maybe terrible, maybe genius idea.
“Hours?”
Incomplete 7th year from Hogwarts; client raised an eyebrow at my suggestion of vocational training but did not remove his gaze from the ocean one can see out the window of this really quite grim little office they have here.
“Fuck.” He had found his glasses.
“Parseltongue is a language.” Harry said in English. “The language of snakes.”
Maybe she should just go for a gloss?
Malfoy didn’t move, but said airily, “I’m sure you can demonstrate adequately on your own, Potter. I wouldn’t want to overshadow you.”
Florian was a squib.
Dean laughed. “Oh, god, no. It wouldn’t have been the right time. I had to get my head out of my ass and notice him properly.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
“How’s it been?” Hermione asked, prodding Ron gently with her foot. He got the message, drained his tea, removed her flats, and set to work.
“I thought this was my room!” Malfoy yelped. “The window’s all fogged and I thought I left my light on and—shouldn’t you be at breakfast?”
Draco snapped his pocket watch shut. “What?"
“You’re going to need it,” Andy said.
Kreacher glared at Remus from over Sirius’ shoulder. “You should respect the paterfamilias. He knows what is best for the House.”
Was that a—fucking cheeky bastard.
Neville was in the bath that evening before he realized they hadn’t decided what experiment to run.

Parvati was biting her bottom lip. “New beginnings.” That didn’t sound like a platitude. It was far too serious.
“Don’t ruin the table,” he groused.
Val raised their eyebrow and waited. It was best to let Harry ramble into the realization that they’d wanted the coconut back as an excuse to see Draco again. That was pretty clear. But Harry never really bothered listening. That was a bit harsh. If they had an idea, it was difficult for others to dislodge it.
“You’re right, Harry. Things have changed. We have all changed.” Her conciliatory tone only set him off further. “No one else had an objection to Professor Malfoy’s appointment. His graduate work at the Magical University in Mainz was very impressive, and he is more than qualified.”
Hermione put her hands together in a praying gesture and bowed her head for a moment. Harry watched the wide circle of her afro sway as she took several deep breaths.
“Azkaban is fucked up.”
he just gave my older daughter.”
Harry clutched his pumpkin juice. “But he’s married to Ben! They said they got together in London! I didn’t know they went here!”
Harry tapped the glass. “So, like, are you and Blaise together?”
“Excuse me?! Have you forgotten the infamous ‘you don’t have to call me sir, professor’ incident of double potions, ninety-one?”
A few minutes later, the toast popped up.
“Hey,” Neville said, walking around the table and dropping a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Don’t beat yourself up about it. It’s normal to be curious about, er, things we don’t know about.”
Harry narrowed his eyes but dutifully assembled a dry turkey sandwich. A pot of mayonnaise appeared at his elbow just as he was considering how grim it was. Then a bowl of freshly-washed lettuce. And a plate with tomato slices.
“What? No! Why?”
Pomona bit the inside of her cheek to keep from bursting out in laughter.
Val didn’t want to be critical, but that boy had no dance moves. He was more of a flailer. But it was deeply precious that he was trying to keep up with Harry, whose sinuous grace turned heads.
Harry laughed and felt magic bubbling out of him and ebbing into the night. He elbowed Draco affectionately and was only slightly surprised when Draco didn’t shove him back. Everything felt softer in the darkness. Softer, and open, and filled with love.
“She doesn’t want to come back from Paris this year.” He sounded so forlorn that Harry almost felt bad for him.
Harry tched and took another bite of tart.
“He is!” Harry insisted, glaring at Fleur’s hand.

“I don’t know,” Audrey’s melodious voice broke in. “Talbott and I went on our first date when we were fourteen. Madame Puddifoot’s, even. It was so awkward, but we’ve been together ever since.”
Harry fiddled with a bit of wrapping paper that had fallen into his lap. They’d gotten more couple-y in the last six months and he knew it was because he was at Hogwarts and they were busy and they just hadn’t spent that much time together, but Harry wanted someone to whisper things to and put his arm around on the sofa and he suddenly felt a bit cross and pouty. It wasn’t anyone’s fault he was alone. Or that his ex was happily feeding her girlfriend bits of popcorn off the Christmas tree decorations (was that hygienic?). He just felt rather cross. And that wasn’t anybody’s fault.
“Oh, yeah,” Andre said. “I forgot you knew him. Ollie’s cleaned him up a bit. But he keeps Ollie organized and like, doing something other than Quidditch, so they’re good together.”
A general grumble of approval broken by Addie’s cheers. Harry flopped into his chair and sipped his tea.
sweet dreamzzzzz
Harry wanted to close his eyes and disapparate to Ron and Hermione’s couch. Luckily, Padma and Addie had just been down in Edinburgh looking for some extracurricular aids—Harry suddenly thought,
“So, you’ve been thinking about me,” Malfoy said with a little smile.
Harry’s eyes snapped open. “How could you forget the dazzling lap dance I gave you when you tried to shoot down my DJ proposal? That was at a faculty meeting.”
She built her potions business on the back of these ethically-sourced and ethically-minded healing potions. Working with local herbalists from around the world, Vane ensures that fair compensation is paid for the ingredients she uses, whether it’s powdered Peruvian boomslang skin or virgin-harvested mushrooms. She has also been active in importing the high labor standards of non-magical “Fair Trade” practices to the magical world.
“It is!” Hermione said, and then pressed her lips together. “It’s bloody unjust what they’re doing and—”
“Thanks.”
⩥ ask draco re: eyebrow potions
Minerva began to laugh. Hagrid looked as though someone had stepped on his foot. Filius was nodding, moving his shoulders from side to side. Audrey swayed and clapped arrhythmically. Padma was wiping her tears with one long sleeve.
Harry nodded. But that didn’t mean that Draco had to like, request that file. Or make copies. Or save those copies. “Why?”
“Thank you!” Draco mumbled while staring at the crumbs in his hand.
“Right.” Neville wiped his palms.
Malfoy winked at him before turning back to his notes.
Astoria pressed her lips together so hard and held her breath otherwise she was definitely going to burst out in hysterics. Lavender had let her face drop into her hands and her shoulders were heaving. She sat back up, blinked and shook her head until the smirk dropped off her face.
Harry laughed. He wasn’t expecting that.
☠ ENSURE THAT THE BLACK FAMILY PATERFAMILIAS REMAINS CONTENT
“Septum?”
Harry wanted to hold on forever. His hands tightened on Malfoy’s waist.
