back at school, but it’s that he cares about Harry, now, that makes Harry know he’s being sincere. “Really.”
After a hole is dug, the seed must be planted. Harry borrows a book on tree care from Neville, feeling a little silly doing it, but Neville just smiles that kind smile of his and wishes Harry luck. It’s mid-August when he buries the acorn. Nothing much is meant to happen until the spring, but Harry likes the idea of the lone tree waiting to sprout amongst his garden of flowers and vegetables, so he sits next to the seed for a while and enjoys what little sun there is this time of year. He lets his hand glide over blank pages of a sketchbook he uses for drawing, capturing both the beauty of his flowers and the loneliness of the space between the beds where, one day, a strong oak will take up root and become the heart of the garden.
Hermione looks scandalised as she passes Harry his drink. “Of course not.” She peers down into her own glass of red wine, like giving it a disapproving look would make her sober up. “I was only discussing the intricacies of Auror fieldwork and the apper–
“Hey! Don’t turn my own cat against me!” Harry gathered her up into his arms, muffin forgotten, and kissed the top of her head sweetly. “Cookie doesn’t think I’m gross, isn’t that right, girl?” She purred and smooshed her face against his cheek. Harry looked at Draco with a victorious glint in his eye.
The force of it rushing back to him knocked Draco off his feet.
“Not what?” Draco asks, mischievous glint to his eye.
“Right. Okay. Er. DoyouthinkMalfoyishot?”
And Malfoy didn’t deserve any of it. “I’m just a little– well. Bothered?”
“Owl me the details, won’t you? If I still want a job at the end of the day I really do have to go now.”
“It wouldn’t feel as good if we hadn’t been to hell and back,” Harry concludes with a smile.
“Mhm, I can imagine.” She takes out a glass and opens the firewhiskey, pouring him a far too generous measure. But hey, what’s the point of New Years when you’re single if not to get shitfaced by drowning your sorrows in alcohol? “At work, we always–” Hermione gasps.
“You and Malfoy study together?” he asks somewhat incredulously.
Person ignored, Harry sits down on the small loveseat positioned next to a plant and tries not to think about what the previous users of it might have been doing. Looking up at the night sky, he muses that the stars look very pretty tonight. Maybe if he’d paid more attention to Astronomy at Hogwarts, he’d know more about them, but he knows the ones that count, and that’s what matters most to him. Sirius shines brightly and Harry smiles. He always hunts that star out when he’s feeling down or missing his godfather.
Harry snorts. “No he didn’t.”
Malfoy smirks and holds up a glass of wine. “The same as you, I imagine.”
Emboldened by that thought, Draco leaned forward and brushed his lips against Harry’s cheek. It was only a brief touch, but Harry squeaked, much to Cookie’s annoyance. Warmth spread throughout Draco’s whole body as he pulled away. Then, in a show of just how brave he was, he sprinted out of the bakery, bell ringing loudly behind him.
Draco yelps and pulls back ever so slightly — giving both of them room to breathe. “What was that for?”
“Just you,” Harry says, meeting silver eyes with his own, because it’s true, Malfoy’s mum wasn’t ever really a Death Eater, so she doesn’t count, and Harry thinks it might ruin this moment if he brings up Narcissa, and he’s not ashamed to say he wants to find out what happens next. “I think you’re a good person, Malfoy.”
The bakery was quiet again besides Cookie’s soft purrs and Harry’s humming, until he piped up and said, “I’d let you, you know.” Draco looked up from the cat on his lap to find Harry watching him intently, a sort of lopsided smile on his face.
Malfoy is staring at him oddly and Harry doesn’t know what to make of that. So, Harry stares back. And, shit, Malfoy looks– well, he looks
. Comforting. The fingers on his wrist are now stroking, slowly, back and forth and back and forth, and every cell in Harry’s body is alight. “Know so,” he says with certainty.
Harry stared at him for a moment, and some of the worry eased in his chest. “You’re surprisingly good at making me feel better.”
“So,” Malfoy says, moving across to the bannister again after placing the bottle down. Harry’s eyes move southward, and,
“Hi, mate,” he replies, but Ron’s already moved on to kissing her neck. Harry downs his drink and turns away from the, uh,
“Yeah. Yeah, perfect.”
a lot more of him than he expected, his brain supplies, and the thought of that makes him flush). Drinks with Malfoy happened on a weekly basis from then on, so much so that Harry subconsciously thought of him more as
“Yes.” Harry’s laugh is muffled and Draco smacks him lightly on the arse. “If you tell anyone, Potter, especially Granger, I swear to Merlin–”
“I’m seeing him in September, I couldn’t get an appointment for my birthday, remember?” he tells Draco, who is still smiling. “He’s so busy because of how good he is.”
In a way, Draco was right, but Harry had just put a hand on his knee and squeezed, as much to distract Draco from pitying him as to stop himself from wallowing in the bouts of sadness he sometimes gets when drinking. It’s always wine. Devil juice.
Oh fuck.” He couldn’t breathe. His heart and lungs ached. “He said he’d call, and leave a message, and, and–”
“As beautiful as you are, Harry, I really need those vials!” Draco calls, and Harry turns around just in time to see him quickly look back to his cauldron, which is close to bubbling over, a dusting of pink on his pale cheeks. Harry smiles knowingly and fishes the vials from the pond.
“There must’ve been something in the air on the balcony. Both your swarms of wrackspurts have disappeared.”
“No.”
“No!” Harry interrupts and immediately is shushed by Madam Pince. He whispers a hushed ‘
“You have one new message from today, May 10th, 6:34pm, and three old messages.”
Pulling Draco into a proper kiss, Harry smiles against his mouth and spins him around by the waist. “You’ll love it. I promise.”
“I don’t know how to say it,” he says truthfully. Malfoy appreciates honesty, he knows that. Otherwise he gets irritated and gives the cold shoulder. Like the one time Harry tried to deny he’d messed up their potion by adding too many jobberknoll feathers and he didn’t speak to him for a week. Feeling more flustered by the minute, Harry buries his face in his hands. “This is so…”
Gently, brushing his thumb across Draco’s cheek, Harry pries his arm from his chest with his other hand and strokes the sensitive inside of Draco’s wrist, right at his pulse point. It makes Draco shiver against his touch.
This’ll be fun. “It must be a Muggle thing, then.”
.” He doesn’t know why he’s telling Malfoy about this, but he’s here and he’s listening without looking like he’s going to say anything snide, so he carries on. “Everyone says I was so merciful at the trials, and that if they were in my shoes they ‘wouldn’t have been so generous’, but all I did was tell the truth! That’s all I’ve
“What, on your head?” He gets a flick on the ear for that one. “
you’re the love of my life.”
“Harry?” Draco called out. “I’m home, love.”
Draco huffs. “It was yours.”
Draco wandered over, absentmindedly loosening his tie and undoing the top button of his shirt under his cashmere jumper. There was a post-it note stuck to the table besides the player, which read;
“You big softie,” Draco says rather wetly. He runs his fingers over the tattoo again and it lights up under his touch. “You huge, massive, unbelievably endearing softie.”
Malfoy pauses mid-drink. “What, am I not good enough for you?” he sneers, and Harry is immediately transported back to his teenage years.
it’s overwhelming how much he needs Draco. His French hasn’t gotten any better despite how many trips they’ve made to the French Riviera, so when he tries to repeat back Draco’s words, Draco laughs right in his face. “Close enough.”
then lowers his voice to say, “I don’t have a problem with it. Just, uhm, does he mention me at all?”
Draco sighed. Hot mess indeed. “That sounds more appealing than you think,” he said, resting his head on his fist, savouring the pleasant smells of the baked goods and the sounds coming from the window into Japan. His escape. “I’m one more watery coffee away from packing it all in.”
“Salt and pepper,” Draco murmurs, carding his hand through Harry’s hair.
by Draco, for god knows why. Leaning over the shimmering water, he spares a look at his own reflection, and smiles. He looks good, if he does say so himself. Better than he has in years, with round cheeks and soft lines and wrinkles all over. Now, his hair is a swoop of dark grey, shot with patches of white not unlike Draco’s, short beard patchy in colour but full. He’d put on some weight in recent years, but honestly loved how good it was for him. Both in how good it looked and how good it made him
“Potter, are you insinuating,” Draco says, in a haughty tone that still comes naturally to him despite him never using it seriously, “that my 25 year old subconscious predicted the fact you’d be going grey at 40 and that I’d still be stuck with you, and made my patronus manifest as a silver fox?”
“Tell me, dear Chosen One,” Malfoy starts, watching him carefully, and something about the way he says
Slowly, Harry begins to rock the two of them side to side in a half-hearted dance. Draco pulls him closer.
The silver ring on his finger burned, and the last thought that danced in his head before he blacked out was a sorrowful tune, broken and bittersweet.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
Draco deliberates for a count, chewing on his lip.
, he said that out loud.
“Sounds perfect,” he replies quietly, leaning into the touch. Draco softly presses his lips to Harry’s palm. The kiss is a silent ‘
“Hogwarts never felt like a home to me as it did to you,” Draco begins, throat tightening already. “And after time, the Manor contorted itself from my happy childhood home into the cold, loveless shell I think of now. I had a house, a dorm, two bedrooms, and yet no home. It was lonely, in a way, like I was lost.”
“I can’t believe you actually like me.”
“Yes?” he replied, a little breathless.
“Er. Dunno.” Harry laughs awkwardly, side eyeing where Ginny herself is sitting a short way down the table, talking closely with Luna and Neville. “Uhm. Just never happened. I guess. What’s your point?”
. Of a bird. Which was just a little pathetic, really. Draco ran a hand through his hair and sighed again. He was on his lunch break, one far shorter than he deserved, in his opinion, and dreaded the thought of leaving the bakery and having to go back to the Ministry for another few hours. “There’s only so many court transcripts I can handle processing before I go mad. Some of the handwriting is
“Just me?” Malfoy’s looking at him weirdly again, and it’s as if he’s asking about something much more important than Harry’s post-war testimonies.
“I could never. Now
Draco’s fallen so deep that he can’t see a way out. Not that he’ll ever want one, when Harry looks at him the way he’s looking at him now, so kind and so tender.
“Yeah,” Harry says again.
“You have no idea,” Draco said, watching the exchange with a light smile gracing his lips. It made his whole body feel warm, how tender Harry was with his pets. It was ridiculous, but Draco felt oddly…
“Of course,” Malfoy repeats, somewhat stiffly. “That’s what the Saviour does, isn’t it?”
Reaching out an arm, Harry mumbles “
“But–”
what I’m trying to say is that you’ve always mattered to me, in some form. Before second year started, I even wanted to see you just so I knew it, magic, Hogwarts, was all real. And now, well. When I look at you, I see someone who’s intelligent, witty, caring, difficult, utterly
“Mr. Malfoy,” Auror Savage said again, gentler this time. “Perhaps it’ll be easier if we came in.”
“Yes, mum,” Harry says. Draco rolls his eyes and flaps at him noncommittally.
“I feel old,” Harry says. “We’re old, Draco.”
“Whatever it is, it can’t be any worse than anything I’ve heard before,” Malfoy supplies. It’s only somewhat helpful, if the racing of Harry’s pulse is anything to go by. “Last week, a second year Ravenclaw told me I was the worst thing to happen to this school since the Basilisk.”
“You’re a menace, Potter. If you’re going to sit around and watch me you might as well make yourself useful.” He gestures with his knife to the mortar and pestle, filled with half of the valerian root. “Crush it for me, would you?”
all the time at Hogwarts rather than fighting. It feels right, for once, kissing like this, rather than that almost regretful feeling Harry gets in the pit of his stomach when he makes out with people at Muggle clubs. It feels
“Devilishly handsome, huh? That’s a new one.” Draco smiles brightly and Harry takes a moment to admire his face. Crow’s feet have formed at the corners of his eyes from years of laughter, and his forehead is permanently creased, though much to Harry’s chagrin, less so than his own. In his irises, there’s still the same old teasing look that Harry fell in love with. Happiness looks great on him.
They do have time. Just. Harry eats quicker than he ever has in his life so that they can have time. In the grand scale of things, they have all the time in the world together, but in the Draco will beat his arse if he misses the appointment scale of things, they’ve got about half an hour.
, making orders for people at their own pace, interacting with wixen of all walks of life, and having the opportunity to help good causes. All of the profit after expenses goes to charities; Harry’s personal choice is one supporting orphans and abused and neglected children, founded after the war, whilst Draco is a regular donor to a charity set up to help purebloods whose families have disowned them get back on their feet and prosper in life. It’s good work. Pleasant work.
“Oh my god.”
“Oh, shut up. You’re the one who stalked me.”
“No,” Luna says seriously. “I have my cork necklace on, and nargles hate corks.” And, true enough, she’s wearing the same odd necklace she wore all the time in school. Harry reaches out an hand absently to toy with a dangling cork. “It must be your wrackspurts. I haven’t discovered a way of repelling them, yet. But I’ll be sure to let you know first, if I do.”
“You would say that.” Draco stood up, slinging his bag over his shoulder and picking up his hot chocolate. “I really should be going, now.”
Pulling back, Harry smiles so widely his eyes crinkle. “Draco, my god, that is the best thing to hear first thing in the morning,” he says, and buries his face in Draco’s neck.
Draco thinks of the white scars criss-crossing over his chest, and can see it vividly, but then his mind drifts to how tenderly Harry touched them the first time he saw them, mumbling his apologies, and has always pressed kisses to the deeper ones every time they’re intimate, and yes, he supposes it is a little unbelievable. To his past self, how they could end up like this, to his present self, how they were ever anything but.
Harry sucks in a whistle. “Don’t let Ron hear you say that. He’d take it as crimes against Weasley-kind.”
“I don’t know. Harry.” Malfoy’s voice is wobbly, and Harry doesn’t think it’s from the cold, but neither of them move away or retract their hands.
he’s wearing a tight-fitting dark-grey turtleneck jumper with even
“Yes.”
, he can admit that now, plant in Harry’s chest danced happily — maybe that was the wine’s fault — and he’s plucked up enough courage to shuffle his hand along to where Draco’s was on the couch, and wrap his pinky around Draco’s. It was quite possibly, and probably still is, one of the boldest things he’s ever done, War be damned. Draco’s hand had twitched slightly, and Harry remembers thinking he’d fucked everything up, with Draco looking at their barely-joined hands with parted lips. Then, he’d curled his finger around Harry’s before looking at him with surprised eyes, to which Harry smiled nervously. Without breaking eye contact, Draco had twisted his hand so that their fingers were laced together, pale tied with tan, and stroked his thumb along Harry’s finger. Harry had huffed in a laugh, a sigh of relief, and in delight, and laid his head on Draco’s shoulder.
The Aurors shared a look, and Draco’s heart sank a little in his chest. “If you insist. Mr. Malfoy,” Savage started quietly. “Auror Potter– Harry was caught by a curse while in the field. Our Aurors arrived shortly after, but I’m afraid the effects of the curse had set in by then. There was nothing anyone could do. I’m terribly sorry to say, Mr. Malfoy, but this was over three months ago. We’ve only just managed to recover his personal belongings.”
“So why don’t you just tell me what it is you came over here for?” he asks. If Harry’s not mistaken, there’s a playful lilt to his voice.
, although he preferred the term ‘loyal customer’. He’d spent a significant portion of his time and money buying baked goods from
“As if I’d be seen dead talking to Weasley,” Draco huffs out and stuffs the remainder of the cookie in his mouth.
“I think you should smile more,” and, though he hasn’t been invited to say it, “Draco.”
Harry sighs, poking at his dinner with his fork and scanning his eyes over the Great Hall. It’s as loud as ever, but something about the room doesn’t feel right. At the far-most table, there’s a significantly empty space in between Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson, that’s usually filled by a certain towhead blonde. But he isn’t here. And something in Harry’s chest goes weird at the thought.
And it’s those words being parroted back to him that have him realise there’s no question of whether he’s fallen in love with Harry or not, but rather when. He isn’t sure; maybe it was that one night a week ago, with the perfect tea and the perfect smile, or it might’ve been the first time they made love – because it was never
“Theo’s,” Draco says, beaming. He looks a sight with his hair all messed up from the bed and his lips red from Harry’s attack; Harry would spend more time admiring him if he wasn’t confused.
” Draco says, clipped.
admitted their feelings for each other after dancing about at Hogwarts for so long, but their little trio instantly went from Harry and Ron and Hermione to Harry, and Ron and Hermione. And after Harry didn’t get back together with Ginny after the War... well. Harry buried himself in work, his friends bought a house together, Ginny moved on with Luna, and he’s left having pub nights with Auror colleagues who try to flirt with him, but it’s just so not
Harry. His Harry, who is in love with him. His heart soars.
The oak behind them casts a shade over their bodies, standing tall and swaying gently in the wind. Two books lay stacked on top of eachother next to the thick roots at the base of the tree, completely forgotten about, as Harry kept distracting Draco until he put his book down next to Harry’s to give him attention.
“Okay, good. Just wanted you to know.”
“Just watch.”
“Suppose you’re right,” Draco laughs, planting a kiss on Harry’s nose. “Talking about character, no tree based picnic today?”
normal. And that brings it all back around to the question: what
“No one does,” Malfoy tells him with a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes.
The vibration of Draco’s laugh against him makes the butterflies in Harry’s stomach flutter. “I should be the one saying that. It’s madness that we’ve ended up like this, after everything.”
Another flick of his wrist sends the glasses spinning about, and from them comes a trail of
“I know,” Harry tells him, and he means it.
shorter than Muggle tattoos, so it should only take about a week to fully heal. And, of course, there’s a potion for everything.
Then, “Me too. Since Hogwarts.”
“For everything, again. For accepting my apologies. For saving my life. For– for keeping me out of Azkaban.”
Once outside, he stops in his tracks. Underneath one of the towering oak trees, sits a lithe figure, swathed in black despite the sun. They lift their head at the disruption and lock eyes with Harry, who turns promptly on the spot and goes back inside.
“Well, think about it,” Ron starts, worrying in itself. “If you liked her as much as you said you did, you two would be all over each other again, right? Not that I’m complaining that you’re not, because honestly mate, it was a little weird and all. But if you did like her you wouldn’t hold back.”
, which makes it evident how much time he’s been spending with Hermione recently. “Okay, fine, I’m saying it.”
here.” Malfoy raises a slender eyebrow. “At Ron and Hermione’s!” Harry huffs.
Malfoy accepts the firewhiskey, placing his now empty wine glass onto a side table, and takes a large drink from the bottle. Harry follows the bob of Malfoy’s Adam’s apple with his eyes as he drinks. There’s about an inch difference between them in height, Harry notes.
Malfoy hums. “I prefer to read the originals myself. I find that the wording of Muggle translated novels can be awkward at times– Potter, will you
was the first Muggle film Harry forced him to watch. Draco liked it far more than he was willing to admit at the time, and takes no offence to being compared to the unanimously-agreed-upon heartthrob. They’ve watched it at least five times since, which has nothing to do with the endless number of attractive people clad in period costume. Nothing at all.
“Andromeda shares your sentiments. Anyways, Teddy said they take Victoire there all the time, and that she loves it as well. I thought it’d be nice to try it.”
Malfoy sighs deeply, as though Harry has personally offended him. He reaches out his right hand to hold Harry’s still and away from his leg — giving Harry a heart attack in the process — while taking out his wand from his pocket with his left. That was something Harry had noticed almost immediately at the start of the year. Malfoy cast with his left hand now, not his right. Yet he always used his quill in his right hand. He’s been too afraid to ask, but his curiosity finally gets the better of him.
“Harry, I think I’ve fallen in love with you.”
Every day he spends with his husband is another reminder of that. Especially every day they spend out in their garden, drawing, reading, planting flowers, dancing, kissing, and dozing under their tree. Because it
“You think you have feelings for me or you know you do?” Malfoy expands, giving no more insight into how he’s feeling.
“Alright–”
“So you
“Well, er,” Harry stumbles, “that stuff is expensive, yeah?”
Dutifully, Harry makes his way over to the cleansing bath — affectionately named
a prick,” Harry is quick to say, not really knowing why he’s so defensive over Malfoy. “You two have seen him in Potions, he helps me. He’s probably the only reason I’m even going to get my NEWT this year.”
“I love you, Harry Potter, and I haven’t done a single thing that would make me worthy of being loved back, and yet–“ He sniffs, looking down at Harry’s thumb still on his wrist, next to the Dark Mark. “–you love me anyway.”
whisper, but Ron’s never been great at being quiet.
is, Harry?” Draco groans. It’s the most adorable thing Harry’s ever heard.
Everything was personalised with Harry; he refused to print standard messages on any of his parcels, felt it was
“Don’t be silly.”
Standing up, Draco exhales shakily, then wraps his arms, Dark Mark still on display, around Harry’s neck, and settles himself on his lap. Harry has to tilt his head back ever so slightly to keep eye contact with him, but his hands automatically drift to Draco’s hips, holding him in place. Their lips are pressed softly together, Harry couldn’t say who initiated it, but the kiss is slow and intimate and warm without heat. It swirls and pools in Harry’s chest, his abdomen, his limbs, of which his hands are digging into Draco’s side. A hand drifts into Harry’s hair, pulling, curling, scratching, and it coaxes a sigh out of his mouth which is chased by another kiss, surer, more pressing, which Harry returns with just as much enthusiasm.
Harry had said the day he bought it, and Draco had just rolled his eyes and muttered something about him and his bloody animals, to which he’d gotten a cheeky grin in response.
will only talk with the filthy Death Eater scum when in public for everyone to see, is that it?” Malfoy makes to leave, so Harry stands up to block him. “Move, Potter,” he snaps.
“Potter...” Malfoy whispers. Then, as Harry boldly links their fingers together, “What are you doing?”
“Uhm.” He laughs shakily. “Of course not.”
“Yes, well.” Draco stretches, arching his back with a small noise, and Harry’s struck by how much he reminds him of a cat. “Thank me with a pad thai,” he teases, then lowers his voice, “and by telling me about those dreams.”
“No! Malfoy–”
Draco returns it just as warmly and squeezes Harry’s hand. “I think you might be right.”
Malfoy stands up, tucking his book under his elbow, and cancelling the faint remnants of his warming charm, and the cold air seeps into Harry’s bones as he gets up to meet Malfoy. Harry pauses for a moment, contemplating, then sticks out his hand.
By the time the cassette had finished playing completely, it was well after seven. Draco plucked the headphones from his ears, and stretched his arms above his head, his back cracking satisfyingly. Just as he was about to get up, there was a knock at the door.
sketchbook,” and it flies out of the open window and into his hand. He thumbs open the book carefully so the age-worn pages don’t rip, and flicks through it until he finds a drawing he drew shortly after their wedding, on their honeymoon in the South of France. It’s one of Harry’s favourites. In it, the Côte d’Azur provides a perfect backdrop to the scene of Draco stretching out on a garden sofa, a book perfectly situated (by Harry, the real version was much nicer) to cover his modesty, wearing nothing but his wedding ring. Harry traces the peaceful look on pencil-Draco’s face with his ring finger, a fluttery feeling rising in his stomach.

Theo pushes the consent form he mentioned over to Harry and he signs it with a flourish. Draco kisses Harry on the cheek as Theo heads into the back. “Take care. Don’t scream too loud.”
“What I think Ronald is trying to ask, Harry,” Hermione begins, which is never a good thing, because that usually means that Harry is right about whatever he was thinking Ron was attempting to say. “Do you like Draco the way you liked Ginny?”
one?”
it is.
Harry has holes in him too, ones that are small, ones that are large, ones that have been filled over like a crack in a wall, and others that are crumbling. He has a hole in him for everyone he’s lost, a piece of himself that he won’t get back. Along the way, the numbers grew to so many he wonders sometimes how he hasn’t completely fallen apart. Cedric, Sirius, Dumbledore, Mad-Eye, Ted, Remus, Tonks, Fred, and the biggest, blazing hole in his life, his parents.
“...Have you really fancied me since Hogwarts?”
Harry whips his head up. “Hey, I can hear you!” he interjects. “And I am
“That’s it. I did it on the morning that I met you in the park. Didn’t really think much of it, I just kept watering it and checking on it, and it went from a tiny little sprout to what it is now.”
“How come you and Ginny never got together again?” Ron questions, which is not at all what Harry thought he was going to say.
Harry snorts, and she’s gone. He leans back in his seat and looks up at the ceiling, rubbing his face with his hands.
“I was invited,” Malfoy deadpans, as though it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
It’s raw, and the emotion in Draco’s voice surprises himself.
Harry had said, equally as drunk.
and they’d spent a lot of the summer redoing the entire shop themselves by hand, stripping it bare and building it back up to match the vision Harry had in his head. Instead of framed windows of glass, there was one big pane showcasing a miniature version of the brewing process; plants growing then being picked, chopped by a levitating knife or ground by a mortar and pestle, transferred with a splash into a pewter cauldron over blue flames, then poured into a flask and bottled. The two of them were exceedingly proud of the little show they managed to put on, even if it did require some input from Hermione about the charmwork. Inside, shelves upon shelves of ingredients took up the majority of space, leaving room for just a counter, a door to the back — where some brewing of quicker, easier potions by shop assistants takes place — and a small stone alcove, laced with protective enchantments, where children could experiment with harmless herbs and mixtures until their parents finished shopping. The face of the shop was painted a lovely forest green, that glistened faintly with flecks of gold, but never enough to blind. Finally, the cherry on top — in Harry’s opinion at least — was the sign, carved by Harry’s own hand. Wound together tightly, was a stag and a fox, painted in bright shades of silver, and another smaller sign hung below the two animals, the name of the shop swirling in the same colour as the animals.
Closing the door behind him, Draco yawned and set his keys in the bowl on the table, next to Harry’s own set with the little black dog key ring attached. He always teased Harry for it, but really it was quite cute and very
“Because I’m not that bothered about being seen,” Harry replies. He sways forward, like he’s going to go over to Malfoy, but stops.
“That’s me,” Harry laughs, his hands coming to rest on Draco’s hips, thumbs swiping back and forth in a motion that’s become second nature to him. He dips his head to catch Draco’s lips in a kiss, slow and gentle, and Draco leans into him, sighing and sliding the hand poised over Harry’s tattoo to his waist.
What is, however, is how Malfoy lights up when he talks about his potions. It’s odd. Harry never thought of Malfoy lighting up for anything, all sharp edges and cutting words. But when he talks about how he discovered some new properties of an ingredient that go right over Harry’s head, it’s like he isn’t even there, hands moving a mile a minute. It’s rather endearing.
, his friend, rather than
“Well, yes, it was. Quite annoying, actually. Though I can’t say I never wanted to do this–” Harry yelps as Draco dips him down as though they’re waltzing, kissing him fiercely. “–at the Yule Ball.” He has to clutch onto Draco’s shoulders to stop himself from falling, and their kisses soon dissolve into fits of giggles. They both end up laying on the grass, Draco’s head on Harry’s chest, arms wrapped around each other.
“It’s okay to be nervous, you know. I’m not going to just stab you with this mercilessly and watch you cry.”
“Like us,” Harry repeats, wearing a stupid grin. “Though I think we went about ten times the speed of the tree.”
At first, Harry thought it was a bit silly to build a Potions lab outside, but Draco soon, as always, proved him wrong. Working with the natural elements had been tricky to navigate to start with, but craftily used shielding and stasis charms meant that the brewing environment was the same as it was down in the basement, if not better. Brewing in the habitats the ingredients were gathered from enhanced the effects of the herbs and in turn the potions they were being used in. This meant that with Harry growing all the plant-based components in their own garden, and Draco concocting remedies only a short walk away, their potions are widely considered in a league of their own and orders fly in, from friends, family, and customers at their apothecary.
“Sorry. I’m keeping you, I know.” Harry took a deep breath in, and then rushed out, “I was just asking if maybe you would like to go with me?”
Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath in. Then goes outside.
Harry positions himself between Draco’s legs, and rests his head against his shoulder so he can press a kiss to his pulse point on his neck. Draco’s arms wind around his waist, and he nuzzles his nose into Harry’s hair.
Oh god.
Draco shakes his head and spears another bit of pancake. “Nothing.”
Harry had made a remark one time about how Cookie seemed to take to Draco quicker than she had to himself, which Draco prided himself in. He adored cats, though Father was allergic and so was never allowed one of his own. Playing with other students' pets at Hogwarts was about as good as he could get until Harry opened his bakery and adopted Cookie. Officially, her title was “Chief Mouser” — as shown by the shining gold plaque on the stump — but mainly she just slept and made noise until she got attention. There weren’t many mice about, in all honesty, so Draco would say her idleness was very much justified.
shots of Weasleys and Grangers and friends and holidays, hanging on walls and sitting on shelves and cabinets. All the furniture is deliberately picked in a way that makes it look almost random, but fits together like pieces of a jigsaw. It’s nice, and Harry can practically see Ron and Hermione cuddled up on the sofa in front of the specially-enhanced TV, watching Muggle movies. He’d been invited over to have a Christmas movie marathon on Christmas Eve before the meal at the Burrow the next day; Harry ended up sprawled on the recliner feigning sleep whilst Ron and Hermione laughed and shushed and whispered ‘Harry’s sleeping!’ at each other. Bill Weasley sits on the sofa now, Fleur Delacour-turned-Weasley cuddling up to him and holding her baby bump protectively, while she sips at orange juice, Bill drinking his own glass in solidarity.
“Hello, Just Harry,” a whimsical voice says from beside him. Harry jumps, and turns to see the face of Luna Lovegood smiling at him.
Harry nods. “I see you as an Unspeakable.”
Harry laughs, tugging Draco’s hand towards him so that he can kiss it. “Me too. Couldn’t have done it without you.”
Outside, the sapling flutters happily in the breeze.
“Malfoy!” he calls out impulsively, and Malfoy turns around, looking confused.
“Is that supposed to make me feel better about getting old?” he asks from his position with his head in Draco's lap, the rest of his body sprawled out on the grass.
“Not even Parkinson? Zabini?”
Hermione narrows her eyes at him. “Yes, I do,” she says slowly. Despite having done nothing wrong in the slightest, Harry feels as though she might be a bit irritated with him. “Draco’s in my Ancient Runes and Arithmancy classes. We study together all the time.”
“Hey, I said
, I was in a rush. And speaking of time–” Draco pulls a little firmer on Harry’s hair to bring him up to meet his eye. “You’ve got an appointment in an hour.”
There’s something about Harry telling him he’s beautiful, even when Draco knows his hair’s a mess and his face is bloated and his eyes are tired, that makes him feel warm. And isn’t it funny, how Draco thinks exactly the same of him?
“Hermione,” Harry starts one day a few weeks later, when the two of them are alone in the library. Hermione’s eyes flit between her essay and two textbooks, as she writes down some Arithmancy equations that go right over his head. He’s meant to be working on an essay for Defence Against the Dark Arts, but he’s unfocused. Jittery. And his thoughts keep straying to images of white blonde hair and grey eyes. His leg bounces under the table, quill dancing between his fingers. “Can I ask you something?”
ready to have now, during dinner, in the Great Hall. Never, for that matter. In any room at Hogwarts. Or in any place ever.
“You make me feel so safe, Draco,” Harry murmurs after a short while. “Like we’re a little family of two. Sometimes you infuriate me to no end and it takes me back to how we were at school, but when we’re like this it’s hard to believe I ever hated you.”
“Scattered brained as always, Harry,” Draco teased, bringing his eyes up to Harry’s face rather than his, well, rather distracting arms.
“Prat,” he says warmly. “No, I was thinking that after we go drop off these orders at the shop, we could try that new café on the corner of Diagon that Teddy’s been raving about. He says that it, and I quote, ‘makes carrot cake so fucking good it felt like my tongue had an orgasm.’ His exact words.”
“I’m aware.” Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him. “Now sit down.”
“Can I... Can I take you out sometime?”
. It stopped bothering Harry a long while ago, years before they’d met in the park, if Draco having it had ever bothered him at all.

“Oh,” Malfoy says, like he wasn’t expecting Harry to say anything about his fashion choices or his appearance. “Well. Thank you. It’s cashmere.”
“Sorry,” he says half-heartedly, his eyes flicking down to Malfoy’s lips.
Harry hummed and fed Hedwig a treat, before attaching the parcel to her leg. “Be happy I’m not the one taking the notes.”
Ron quirks his lip. “Yeah, in sixth year. What’s your excuse now?”
, Harry,” says Draco, voice wavering. Harry’s chest constricts painfully, and slowly he reaches out to place a hand on Draco’s cheek. Draco squeezes his eyes shut, like it pains him to see Harry looking at him like he’s his whole world. He imagines that’s how he looks, anyways, because it’s how he feels, and with Draco he tends to wear his heart on his sleeve and emotions on his face. Never has he been one for hiding what he feels in front of Draco Malfoy, be that a blessing or a curse.
“Bit early for declarations of love,” Malfoy teases, and oh
In the hall, the phone rang once, twice, then went to voicemail.
Harry opens one eye. Then the other, when he sees Theo standing there with the needle and a slightly pitiful look on his face. “Yes?” he squeaks, like the brave man who defeated Voldemort does.
Leaning back in his chair, Harry took a bite of his own. “They’re good,” he sang with his mouth full. Draco made a disgusted noise in the back of his throat.
Draco, head resting on one hand, watches Harry for a while, the slow rise and fall of his chest a comfort in far too many ways to explain, and wonders how it’s possible that he’s been so lucky as to have him,
“Of course,” Harry said, his green eyes glowing. Draco could only imagine what he’d look like in his dress robes. Handsome and pretty and the focus of every other witch and wizard in the room. And yet, he only had eyes for Draco.
“No, I’m
Harry to know. “To me, you’re home. My Harry, my home.”
; it’s not good, but Malfoy talks about it like it was the topic of what he was having for dinner. “Annoying.”
Cookie meowed again, reaching up with her paws. Draco rolled his eyes and uncrossed his legs so that she could jump up onto his lap.
“I try. Sometimes.” And Harry knows he meant every word.
“Message two, March 23rd, 11:54pm.”

of an owl pecking at the window. With a swish of his wand, it flew open, and a familiar snowy white owl did a circuit of his living room, dropping a parcel in his lap and then heading out the window again, which promptly closed behind her. He knew right away what it was going to be, so he opened the box and picked up the note, doing little to hide his excitement.
Harry grinned at him from behind the counter, a tea towel slung over one shoulder and a green apron adorned with lilies tied around his waist. Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest. How he could be so gorgeous and not even realise it, Draco didn’t know. Probably because Harry was the most oblivious, painstakingly modest bastard in the Wizarding World, despite the keen eye he had for the snitch during Quidditch at Hogwarts, which even then he was dismissive of the minute he got off his broom. “Try spending a day in my shoes,” he laughed, waving a hand over the shortbread. The motion wrapped them up in adorable mushroom printed paper, which was then tied up with string in a neat bow Draco would never be able to emulate if he tried, even using his wand. “You’d be a hot mess too.”
Harry’s snapped out of his memories by the faint buzzing noise of the wards, letting him know that Draco’s home from work — he’s a Potions consultant in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, which means he gets the wonderful job of analysing poisons and illegal potions criminals use and sell. Draco seems to love his job, which makes Harry happy, but it’s the close relations with the Auror department resulting in a tentative friendship between Draco and Ron that takes the cake. Harry was over the moon to find out they
“Er,” he starts, scrambling for something to say. His eyes land on the book in Malfoy’s hand, the cover depicting a man in a mask, and says, “what are you reading?”
“Why, er, are you in London?” Harry asks with genuine curiosity, before hurriedly adding, so he doesn’t come across as rude, “if you don’t mind me asking. I can’t imagine you’d come all this way just to read.”
Standing up from the table, Harry summons both mugs and sends them over to the sink to wash themselves, briefly thanking Molly in his head for the book of household spells she gave him. “Have you thought about what you fancy for tea?” he asks, taking a look at the several takeaway menus he has from different places nearby, all pinned on a corkboard. “I was thinking Indian, but we’ve not had Thai for a while either.” He loves to cook, but nothing beats a good takeaway. Everything on the leaflets looks appealing, and he bites his lip when his stomach releases a growl of agreement. It’s a noise too loud in the quiet kitchen. “Draco?”
“Fresh cold air seems to help, though. I’d try going outside, see if that makes you feel better.”
Harry laughs, “That long?”
“I see I wasn’t the only one busy today,” Draco comments appreciatively, snatching a chocolate chip oat cookie from the small pile on the plate in front of Harry.
Taking a steadying breath, Draco shifts himself onto his side so he can look Harry in the eyes.

Harry makes a soft sound and mouths at a spot under Draco’s ear. “That’s nice.”
“No, like,
“You’re drunk.”
“Nope!”
Harry scoffs. “I wasn’t obsessing over him. He was up to something.”
“She likes me best.” Harry made a ridiculous show of planting a kiss on Cookie’s head again, accompanied by a long drawn out ‘
The sound of a guitar filled his ears and he smiled, toying with the ring on his finger, closing his eyes and letting himself float away, lost to the melody, to Harry’s world.

Harry takes the opportunity to slide his hand around to Draco’s firm arse and give it a squeeze.
“Worried,” Hermione says with one of
“But you, you helped me realise that home doesn’t have to be a place. That it can be a person, too. And in that, you found me.” Tears prick at the corner of his eyes, but he needs to say this, and say it now, because he
, he said all that out
“Good. I’m glad,” Harry says, with that stupid grin on his face again. “Happy New Year, Draco.”
“Nice seeing you, Malfoy,” Harry says.
Harry laughs and scoops the valerian root extract into the smaller vial, before placing it onto the shelf behind alongside several other ingredients he’s grown in their garden. Raw dittany, powdered sage, fluxeed, asphodel root, dried nettles, and peppermint are some of them, stored in similar vials all labelled with Draco’s neat writing and colour coded based on what potions they’re used for. There’s a bigger store downstairs in the basement which is linked up to the one outside, automatically replacing anything that runs low. Hourglasses on the side of the shelf (idea wholly stolen from the House points system, no shame) lets them know when things are running low, so Harry knows what to grow and Draco knows what he can use. They’re both intensely proud of their little system.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Of course it is.”
“Hello, sorry for the wait!” a voice called from the doorway. From the kitchen backed up Harry Potter, opening the door with his arse since his hands were occupied trying to balance three trays of shortbread at once. There was white stuff in his hair, probably flour, although maybe the stress of managing a bakery all on his own had finally gotten to him and he’d started to go grey. Draco bit his smile back at his own thoughts. Harry’s sleeves were rolled up, showing off the tattoos he had winding down his arms. From where he was sitting, Draco could only see a hint of the beautiful sleeves Harry had, with deer and wolves decorating his tan biceps, surrounded by flowers and stars and pawprints that trailed all the way down his forearms. Suddenly feeling rather hot, Draco fidgeted in his seat. “I completely forgot I even had these on and– oh, Draco!”
“Of course, love.” The rhythm of grinding is rather soothing, so Harry doesn’t mind at all. “What is it you’re brewing, anyways?”
Huh. He wasn’t expecting anyone but Harry, and he usually flooed in after work. Draco made his way to the front door and opened it warily.
“Bloody hell, Hermione, he’s doing it again,” Ron says in a stage whisper, probably meant to be a
“That’s what you call an attractive middle aged man with grey hair. A silver fox,” says Draco.
When they finally get into the shop, just a minute or so before their appointment, Theo is waiting for them with bare arms resting on the counter and a smirk on his face. He has two full sleeves of tattoos, both magical and Muggle, twisting vines and winding snakes, shapes and faces and other pieces Harry can’t make out in a multitude of colours. They’re all brilliant, and Harry briefly wonders how many of them he’s done himself before Draco takes his hand and leads him up to the counter.
“Er.” He coughs, and his mouth catches up with his brain. “Don’t call her that.”
–” He makes a noise somewhere between a gasp and a moan as Harry sucks on a spot on his neck where Draco has a mole, and the hand in Harry’s hair tightens. “–I bought a book called ‘
“Merlin, you are such a
“Well.” Harry scratched his eyebrow. “Technically. If you count events organised by the Ministry as Ministry business.”
“Well, it’s just that I think you’re a great baker,” he stumbled, feeling his face heat up. “I like your bread.”
“No offence, mate,” Ron starts, scrunching up his face. “But you said that in sixth year.”
“Read it in a book,” Harry tells him cheekily, and gets a smack to the chest. Draco takes the valerian out of his hands, clearly biting back a smile, and starts separating out the sprigs and roots with his blade. He huffs as he works, but readily pecks Harry on the lips when he pouts at him.
it read.
That is nice, Draco muses to himself, as Harry cuddles closer into his side.
,” Draco groans, burying his head into Harry’s neck. “You’ve infected me, you heathen. I hate you.”
“Right. Of course.” A cloud of air streams from his mouth as he speaks. He clears his throat and rubs his shins together in a little dance for warmth. “There’s a lot of French books in the Black collection, but I only learned a little when I was at a Muggle primary school so, er, I have to use a translation charm or buy an English copy if it’s Muggle.”
to pay more attention to their interior design choices in the kitchen-diner, no doubt Hermione’s work. The walls are painted a rich burgundy, which gives the room a cosy feel when combined with the brick fire roaring against the feature wall at the far end, next to the oak wood dining table that adds a bit of brightness to the room. It’s completely lovely and yet makes Harry feel somewhat lonely, like his status as a third wheel is more prominent now that his friends have a sweet little house to call their home.
Harry flushes. “I don’t. But it looks good on you.”
Harry.

At the
How the hell is he meant to woo Draco Malfoy?
“Go on.”
“Yes, well, neither did I,” started Draco, dispersing the butterflies in his stomach with a deep breath in, “Father seemed to think it’d be a good stepping stone, especially since it’s a position under the Wizengamot. But I’d say it’s more of a sinking ship.”
“Er.” He blinks. “Did you hear what I said?”
done–”
“That’s cheating.”
Briefly, he glanced up at the clock.
Draco elegantly arches an eyebrow and, wow, Harry wishes he could do that. “Unfortunately,” he says. The corner of his mouth is turned up in an almost smile. Draco hasn’t said it explicitly yet, but Harry knows, and for now, that’s enough. They have all the time in the world for trivial things such as words, love, and eyebrows. There’s so many little features that make up Draco, ones that explain how he feels without needing to say anything at all, and Harry is determined to learn them all off by heart.
, of course. I’ve been in love with you for a long time.”
The light jingle of the door swinging open was music to Draco’s ears and a song he’d become very familiar with over the past year. Almost immediately, the sweet, warm scent of freshly baked bread drifted up his nose and wrapped around his brain like a comforting blanket. A happy sigh passed over his lips, which curled into a smile at the shouting of “just a minute!” from the back.
. Why do you think I brush our hands together in Potions so often?”
“Oh.” Now that he thinks about it, it isn’t that odd at all. Malfoy was always good at school, and he’s pretty sure he’s seen him around the Ministry before, and they’ve talked civilly a few times when at functions, where Malfoy always wears beautiful robes that compliment his– Hermione might have even spoken about him at one point, too. ‘Unspeakable Malfoy–“

white blonde.”
“What?” That wasn’t what he was expecting. Thrown off, Harry looks up to see Malfoy looking at him with an unsettlingly neutral expression on his face.
“Draco,” Harry tries again, still confused.
“Tell him it was Ministry business,” Harry said. Cookie meowed contently just because she could.
They had woke up like that the next morning, hands clasped tightly together, cricks in their necks. Harry made pancakes for breakfast, Draco failed to hide how excited he was for them while he drank his tea, and their first kiss tasted like golden syrup and berries.
“I love you, too,” Harry says, grinning when Draco comes up to meet his lips again. “Happy birthday to me.”
Who are you to say bird’s nests aren’t tidy?”
“A slightly more organised version of Ron,” she teases, putting down her quill and clasping her hands together, giving him her full attention. Harry really does love her, when she’s not nagging at him. “Alright, what
“Well,” Harry starts, thinking, wanting to choose the right words. Indulging himself, he flattens the bumps above the curve of Draco’s nose, and smiles when he lets him. “For starters, you were my token arch nemesis, as much as an eleven year old could understand the word
Theo unfolds the paper and looks it over for a bit, before raising an eyebrow at Harry, who flushes under his gaze. When he booked his original appointment, he told Theo that the tattoo was a surprise and Draco wasn’t to know what it was or where he was getting it, but he didn’t actually tell Theo what it was either, just that he wanted it over his heart. Theo called him a cheesy bastard, and he has to agree. He’s a bit of a sap when it comes to Draco.
Harry sits down gingerly on the bench next to Malfoy. He’s immediately enveloped in a warmth that feels like a loving hug so comforting he makes a soft noise of delight, which Malfoy snorts at. Why didn’t

“No.”

“Great.” Harry nods self assuringly. Then pauses. Malfoy gives him a
things he’s doing when reporters (Rita Skeeter) sight him in the Ministry. He never reads any of them, he learned a long time ago that all the articles are a waste of his time. Besides one, that is, printed at the start of the year about a called-off engagement which caught his eye.
Draco reread the note, then picked up the set of headphones lying on the table and slowly placed them in his ears. The cassette player was light in his hand, and he turned it over a few times before skipping to the right song and pressing the button to get the music to play.
“So are you.”
a month or so ago, and was constantly listening to the tapes that came with it through these headphone things, and would often completely drown out everything else with his music. If not for the adorable way Harry danced about in the kitchen with it playing, Draco would be irritated with how he constantly had to tap Harry when he wanted to have a conversation with him.
“Alright, loverboy. Sign these and then let’s go get you set up.”
“I don’t even know what a numerical chart is,” he admits.
It’s quiet for a moment, with Harry still pointedly avoiding Malfoy’s eyeline. Then, he asks in a soft voice, “you think or you know?”
to say the least, not just because Draco is a nosy twat when he’s not clued in on something, but because they usually get ready together in their ensuite every morning. Harry has to shut Draco out of the bathroom while he changes the dressing and feels bad about it every time, since he sits outside the door like a lost kitten and pouts at Harry for all of a minute before he lets himself be dragged onto the bed and the pout be kissed from his mouth.
In his mind, everything slots into place. And then the words just fall out, like if Draco keeps them in any longer he’ll burst with the intensity of it, and tells Harry what he’s been thinking about constantly for the last week, since he came home from a shift at St. Mungo’s and a beaming Harry was waiting in the living room with a cup of tea made just the way Draco likes it, milky, and he almost melted with how much affection he felt for the man in front of him.
“Rather bold of you to assume that I wouldn’t, just for some peace. Which you’ve now interrupted,” Malfoy answers. Harry opens his mouth then closes it right again, because Malfoy’s smirking. He looks at Harry for a moment, then continues. “House hunting, actually.”
Later on, after being yelled at by the head of Wizengamot Administration Services for an hour, Draco was recovering on his couch when he heard the distinctive
“Spying on me again, are you, Potter?” Malfoy calls, a teasing curl to his lips. “You’re not doing an awfully great job at hiding.”
Draco is falling, whether that’s in love or into insanity, he isn’t sure, but one thing he’s certain of is that it’s entirely Harry Potter’s fault.
“Show off,” he mutters, before plucking his own wand from Harry’s fingers and casting the same spell. Draco’s stunning fox patronus bursts from the wand, circling back around to jump side-to-side in front of Harry’s stag. The stag roars softly at the fox, which barks back then pads over to lie down on Harry’s stomach. The phantom touch of the patronus tickles slightly.
Harry laughs breathily, and nuzzles his nose against Draco’s neck. “I love it when you call me things like that. With your posh accent, it makes you sound like Mr Darcy.”
“I really–”
A short while later, Draco pads into the kitchen in a pair of joggers and an oversized jumper that both belong to Harry.
“Oh,” Harry breathed, a relieved smile spreading across his face that seemed to light up the whole room; Draco’s heart swelled. “Wonderful.”
“I would love to go with you. As your date.”
Fuckfuckfuck.
Harry scuffs his feet against the ground, the anxious knot in his stomach becoming more obvious. Now that he’s here, he doesn’t really know what to say. “I, er, wanted to talk to you.”
“I hate you. You’re older than me by almost two months. You’ve
Malfoy quirks an eyebrow and relaxes slightly. “Right. I didn’t know you had an eye for fashion, Potter.”
“I’m presuming treacle tart is on the menu?” Turning around in Harry’s arms, Draco lazily orders the cauldron to sink down into the storage hole in the workbench.

“What, the
“I love you most.” The look in Draco’s eyes is so intense that Harry feels it in his chest when he says, “
“Hi,” Harry says, wrapping his arms around Draco, who melts into the touch. “Busy day?”
And so the acorn is planted.
“I beg to disagree,” Harry says, smiling to himself.
“Well,” Harry says, composing himself as Draco settles into the chair opposite him and wraps his hands around the warm mug of tea, “It’s one of Molly’s recipes that I’ve been meaning to try out, so I thought I’d bake some, since
The drawing isn’t the one of the sprout, it’s one Harry had started a little while after Draco had moved in. One night, Draco had been working on analysing the properties of a poison being used by new dark wizards, and had fallen asleep at the desk in Harry’s “study” that was becoming more and more Draco’s by the day. Harry’d went in to check on him, and found him sleeping in his chair, head slumped to one side, and arms dangling beside him. He was only wearing a plain white shirt with the top button undone and his sleeves rolled up, and slim fitting black slacks, but Harry thought he was gorgeous. Rather selfishly, Harry had summoned his sketchbook and drawn out a rough sketch, before shaking Draco awake and taking him to bed.
“We need to shower anyways.”
Harry curves his other hand around Draco’s hip and draws him in closer so that their chests are pressed flush together. In return, Draco winds his arms around his waist and deepens the kiss.
’ because I thought it’d be about preparing drinks and snacks, but it was all filled with party tricks.”

“That might fall under that category.” Draco tilted his head to the side. Both cat and man stared back at him, looking oddly similar. Huh. They do say pets look like their owners. “Some elaboration would be great.”
to tell me what it means, at least,” Harry says against his mouth. Draco grins.
“End of messages.”
They stand there holding each other for what feels like hours. And it’s silly, really, that Harry enjoys it so much. Spending time with Draco Malfoy on his best friends’ balcony. It isn’t normal in the slightest, and Harry loves it. And maybe, there will be so many moments of

with Draco that those moments become normal. For Harry. For Draco. And for their friends and family. Until it’s all just normal and feels right, like it’s meant to be. And if that sounds sappy, well, hey. At least he didn’t say that bit out loud.
Standing on the path up to their house, was two of Harry’s Auror colleagues, a woman and a man, decked out in their scarlet robes, solemn and straight-backed. Draco’s eyebrows furrowed.
Draco huffs. ”Well, it’d be rather stupid of me to say no now, wouldn’t it?”
’. This man was going to kill him. Draco was actually going to die.
“Happy birthday, Harry,” he says almost shyly, and opens his mouth to say something else, but Harry tackles him into a kiss before he can get the words out. Draco’s protests last for about a second before he’s kissing Harry back from where he’s pinned underneath him, morning breath forgotten, and one of his hands winds its way into Harry’s hair, pulling every so slightly because he knows that Harry likes it. Draco’s so
Malfoy properly laughs at that one. “They’re worse than fanged geraniums, journalists.” He sighs and waves his hand over his place in the book, where a silver bookmark appears out of nowhere, then closes the cover. He turns to give Harry his full attention and something jumps in Harry’s chest. It’s probably the sight of Malfoy doing wandless magic. He’s always loved wandless magic. Yeah, that’s it. “It’s the same for me, in a way. It’s peaceful. Muggles don’t know who I am, so the only thing I get stared at for is my hair by old people who think it’s dyed.”
“Well...” Now he has her attention, he’s not sure where to start. “Do you– Have you, er, got any classes with... Malfoy? Other than like, the ones I’m in, that is.”
As Harry starts on his first pancake, Draco takes his own seat across from him, sipping on his tea quietly as Harry eats. They don’t say anything because they don’t need to. The silence is comfortable in the home they’ve spent years making, the bond they share grown from the trust they have in each other. Harry thinks he could die happy here and now, with his man and his pancakes and their dodgy mugs in their overly expensive but cosy kitchen.
“That sounds like bribery.”
“Point stands.” Harry pecks Draco on the lips, smiling, and presses their foreheads together. “Harry.”
Harry finds a seat in the corner in the upstairs living room, where the music is quieter, after being stopped by about, say,

feelings to someone before, it’s all sort of just… happened. Came out without meaning to.
After the most uncomfortable half hour of Harry’s life, Theo finishes up the tattoo and applies some kind of ointment over it, before wrapping it up and explaining to Harry what the aftercare is like. Since it’s a magical tattoo, the healing time is

“Harry, darling,” Draco says, pressing a kiss to his temple, and bringing one hand up to run through the black curls brushing against his cheek. Harry inhales deeply. “My darling Harry.”
be added in between, this time in silver.
Draco took a seat at one of the small wooden tables that sat across from the counter, just big enough for eating pastries and taking the time to admire the quaint woodsy theme, and set his bag down next to him. All of the furniture in the bakery was wooden, swirling with tree rings and beautifully imperfect in a way that made Draco feel snug, more like he was in someone’s home rather than their shop. The walls were patterned with a mixture of leaves and flowers, and the floors were a dark brown that reminded Draco of the forest near the Manor, of running through the trees as a child with the house-elves chasing behind him. A lone tortoiseshell cat was curled up asleep on a tree trunk in the corner right next to the till. She was called Cookie, of all things, which at first Draco thought quite stupid, though he’d warmed up to the name and gotten rather fond of her, too, over time. In the background, the radio played Muggle songs Draco wasn’t familiar with — he never was — too quiet for him to make out any of the words. There was a huge faux-window built onto the longest wall, charmed to display a destination from around the world. Every day, there was a new place, and Draco loved trying to guess where each one was. Today was unmistakably Tokyo, with cherry blossoms fluttering in the wind like pink butterflies and floating on the rivers as though they were boats, drifting, drifting, with everywhere to go and all the time in the world to get there.
“Nope,” Harry says, whisking them away to Theo’s tattoo shop.
Being in love with Draco Malfoy is quite possibly both the easiest and best thing Harry’s ever done. Draco is difficult and stubborn and, at times, impossible. But falling in love with him wasn’t.
Draco pushes Harry away in the direction of the backroom. “Go on. As long as it’s not a realistic portrait of my face, I’m sure I will.”
“Potter.”
“How about you go upstairs and get cleaned up,” Harry says, thumbing at the mark on Draco’s cheek for emphasis, “and I will make us tea. Then we can order takeaway for dinner.”
, and in an instant Harry knows what Draco really means, what he won’t say for fear of upsetting Harry;
tailored black trousers. His hair is cut shorter than it was at Hogwarts, parted at the side, with a wave of it curling over his forehead. All of a sudden Harry feels rather stupid about the pair of blue jeans and ash jumper he chose to wear tonight, and that he didn’t even attempt to tame his birds nest of hair before coming out.
who all had something to say about his ‘gracious work as an Auror’ or his ‘gallant contributions to wizard-kind’. It’s not like he doesn’t appreciate it, but sometimes he’d like to be
“Hot? I mean– what? What are you doing here?”
“I blame you entirely for how crass that is.” Draco spells the heat off, then disposes of the residue with another flick.
Theo laughs and notes something down. “Magical needles. Have you got your design with you, Potter?”
“Why’s that?” he asks, tilting his head.
“To fix my technique?” he offers weakly.
It’s by pure accident that Harry finds him. All around him, muggles with umbrellas rush past grumbling as he walks slowly through the streets of Islington, heading for a garden not far from a little café he sometimes visits for breakfast when he’s home alone and can’t be bothered to make anything himself. Given that most people would rather be indoors cuddled up in front of the TV than outside at a park, there’s hardly anybody there. Except for one lone figure, that is, sitting on one of the benches that both the rain and the few muggles passing by seem to be conveniently avoiding. Slender fingers turn the page of a battered novel, which rests upon one lean leg crossed over the other at the knee. He looks like something out of a painting, lit by a single streetlamp which reflects in the puddles of water near his feet, white-blonde hair stark against the greens and browns and greys of the garden. A beige muggle coat adorns his thin frame, with a hugging all-black get up underneath, and posh dress shoes. Harry briefly regrets not bringing his sketchbook with him. Subconsciously, Harry draws closer to the man and his angular features, and it’s little time at all before he’s standing next to the bench, and grey eyes are looking up at him.
, the romanticised version of him the media has made almost saint-like; Potter, sure, he cared about
If Draco hadn’t studied Harry’s face so closely, he would’ve missed the way it fell ever so slightly. “The demands of a Ministry job,” Harry said, with the slightest hint of distaste in his voice.
Draco hung up his satchel and coat, then slipped off his loafers and placed them neatly next to a muddy pair of trainers that looked as though they’d deliberately been dipped in a bucket of filth.
“Who said anything about making you feel better? I’m revelling in the fact I’ll never go grey.”
“Why are you awake?” he grumbles, voice scratchy. “I thought you liked to sleep in.”
“That’s... nice of you.” Draco swallowed, feeling more touched than he should at a free hot chocolate. Maybe because it was Harry. He cleared his throat. “Well, thank you. Work is calling, though.”
“I–” Malfoy starts. “I really am sorry, Potter. For everything. I didn’t just say it for the trial.”
hand drifts to the back of Harry’s neck. Harry swallows, his heart stuck in his throat. “Draco…”
Harry laughs against Draco’s neck. “You didn’t read it beforehand?”
“I’d hoped so, yes,” Harry said, bashful. “But not if you don’t want to, of course! I’d never force anything on you–”
. Every piece of Malfoy is carefully put together; his tie done up in an immaculate Windsor knot, pressed slacks accentuating his long, thin legs, shirt neatly tucked in and never creased, all topped off with a grey jumper and his cloak, if it’s cooler. In Potions, he often shucks the last two layers to focus intently on whatever the assignment is, guiding Harry like he’s a little lost lamb — which, to be fair, he usually is — with gentle touches to his stirring hand, playful comments about how he must be
“A silver fox,” Harry repeats. “Funny, that.”
It’s rather easy to find Malfoy. Just as Hermione said, he’s sitting in an arch in the main courtyard, one leg bent at the knee and the other hanging down lazily. He has a book open in his lap, turning the pages at regular intervals. It’s a Sunday, so he isn’t wearing his usual pristine shirt, tie, and vest combo, but a soft looking crew neck jumper in a deep blue. Blue looks good on him, Harry thinks. The afternoon sun catches his figure at an odd angle, bathing his legs and hands in a swath of light, but leaving his face in the shadow.
“Ah,” Malfoy says, and sounds sort of... relieved? “I don’t read
“What’s Weasley talking about, Po– Harry?” Draco asks.
Harry is far too drunk to understand that, so he just says, “Yeah. Normal.”
“Oh?” says Draco, raising one eyebrow infuriatingly. Harry can’t do it, no matter how hard he tries. He just ends up raising both, which makes him look surprised when he’s trying to be– well,
Draco goes even more red, if that’s actually possible. “Eat your pancakes,” he orders with no real heat behind it, turning his hand from where Harry’s still holding it so it cups his cheek. He runs his thumb across his lips, brushing off a crumb from the corner of his mouth. “Theo told me not to let you make us late.”
A little while later, when Malfoy’s warming charm begins to wane, Harry finally checks his watch to see they’ve spent almost an hour together talking in the rain, and conversation flowed as easily as it would if he were talking to Ron.
“Fuck off, Potter,” he replies, flipping him off and hiding his blush by drinking his tea.
“You drew…” Draco trails off quietly, hand retracting from the page. The twisting, scarred shape of the Dark Mark swirls on the page, standing out starkly from the lightly shaded lines of the rest of his pale complexion. It’s something that plagues Draco a lot, still. Hardly ever does he expose his arms to Harry, except at night and when they shower together, but even then he tries his best to hide it, as if Harry wouldn’t notice if he willed for him not to. Harry wishes he could just let it
Just as the fireworks go off, Harry cups Draco’s cheek with his free hand and pulls him down into a kiss. It’s awkward at first, and Harry uses too much teeth, but soon they melt into a rhythm that truly makes the magic of a New Year’s kiss feel as real as a shining bright
normal parties.
“Don’t mess it up.”
Draco hums, biting his lip, toying with the waistband of Harry’s Quidditch-patterned pyjama bottoms. A snitch darts away from his touch and straight into a tiny seeker’s hand.
To drunk Harry, that sounds like an excellent idea. One, for the prospect of a balcony ready for him to fling himself off of; and two, for fresh air to clear his head, which is spinning now that he’s stood up.
Draco gazes at him so lovingly; it’s probably the same look Harry has in his eyes. “
“Right.” Malfoy looks kind of confused, but less like he’s going to storm off. “You’ve not drank all of that yourself, have you?”
Harry winces. “Please don’t call me that.”
Malfoy makes a sort of disbelieving sound. “
He sighs and keeps drinking.
“The drawing.” Warmth returns to Harry’s cheeks and he smiles, pressing a kiss to Draco’s hairline. “I mean it, I love your art. Don’t think I say that enough. You’re talented, Harry.”
“Thank you,” he says, squeezing his arms just a bit tighter. Even after all this time, he doesn’t know how to take compliments, that nagging thought in the back of his mind insisting that it’s only because he’s Harry Potter that people praise him, no matter what he himself thinks. But Draco’s never cared about
As he shades, he thinks of how his life has changed in the months since he planted his acorn. After his meeting with Malfoy in the park and the drinks that followed, Harry has seen a lot more of him (
Draco pauses with a cookie half way into his mouth. “They’re good.”
Harry rolls out his shoulders when he stands up, sketchbook held loosely in one hand, and makes his way back inside the house to greet his boyfriend. That still makes him feel warm whenever he thinks about that. Draco Malfoy being his
In the shower, Harry savours every second of Draco in his arms, every touch of their hands against each other, every bit of skin that they can press against each other. With very little complaint, Draco responds to Harry’s ministrations with enthusiasm, leaning into him and sighing when Harry goes after the spots he’s learned off by heart that Draco likes. Draco kisses him against the tiles while rubbing shampoo into both Harry’s and his own hair, and Harry returns the favour by massaging Draco with his favourite shower gel. It smells of citrus — Harry loves it (and uses it on himself, too).
“He’ll appreciate this a lot, Potter,” Theo says to him under his breath as they go back into the front of the shop. With a wink, he adds, “in more ways than one.”
And Draco closes the gap between them again, lips moving more firmly, bodies drawing ever closer. Daringly, Harry opens his mouth, inviting, and Draco takes his offer, their tongues sliding together in a way that heats up Harry’s entire body. While Draco’s toying with Harry’s hair, Harry’s free hand searches blindly, coming to rest up Draco’s thigh, making the sweetest of sounds spill from his lips.
Harry goes over and gingerly sits next to him.
Theo sits down and places the needle next to him on a tray, then puts a pair of gloves on. “Because it’s only line work the pain shouldn’t be too bad. And the fact that we’re doing a magical tattoo makes it less intense, since your magic will react to the magic of the needle and work together to soothe the pain. Other than that, it’ll be a burning or scratching feeling for a little while. Alright?”
Harry tilts his head to the side. “You mean you don’t know?”
one, but I
“Fine.” Draco sighs, then takes on the same tone when he whines, “
“Of course that’s a yes, Harry, for Merlin’s sake,” Draco says, but smiles brightly. “Idiot,” he adds as an afterthought.
“Yes, we have a Potions essay due next week and no, I’m not going to help you write it,” she replies automatically without looking up from her parchment.
Head resting on his fist, stupid smile on his face, Harry says, “You love me, really.”
“I really like that one. S’warm.”
That sends a thrill through Harry; that he’s the first to know, to know something about Malfoy that no one else does, even if it’s nothing good. Shamefully, that only amplifies the feeling. “Er, no, I guess I’m not.”

they are, with Hermione placing a hand on Ron’s wrist to stop him completely ruining their potion, and Ron constantly moving closer to Hermione as though he can’t help it.
“Yes,” Hermione says with a sigh. “Apparently Zacharias Smith wanted to
done. People argue that you got off lightly, favouritism or something, that even though we tried to bite each other’s heads off at school, I felt sorry for you as a fellow classmate or some guff like that. But I believe what I said, Malfoy. That you’re not just your mark. It’s not like I helped any other Death Eaters–” he stops himself, before he says anything too honest about his motives.
“I thought it’d be the boring work that’d do you in if I’m honest,” Harry commented, bending over to write a note to accompany the shortbread. “Never saw Draco Malfoy becoming a clerk.”
The serene silence is broken by Draco whispering “silver fox.”
“No, he didn’t. He said something far more explicit.” Draco quirks an eyebrow. “You know Theo.”
kisser; they should’ve been doing
“That makes sense.” Harry takes a swig of what’s left of the firewhiskey. Malfoy eyes the half empty bottle, then Harry’s face.
“Of course,” he replies, without thinking.
“Er, they– it can be, I suppose,” he replies, and realises his voice sounds a little like Ron’s. He clears his throat again. “But, isn’t normal, just, nice sometimes? Like, you know what to expect. Because it’s normal and safe and all, you know,
, they hire recent Hogwarts graduates looking for experience, and some of the senior students during the holidays looking for a bit of extra potions practice and money, to work the shop. Often, Draco will run workshops out of the back room for those who might be struggling. Harry makes very little input when he joins Draco for these sessions, he only really goes to watch the easy way he explains reactions and relationships between components, how the metal of cauldron can create an entirely new potion out of the same herbs, and that mixing techniques are far more important than they’ve been taught. Harry’s heart is so full of love for him. It’s rather amusing, too, watching how intent on learning the kids are, and even more so when he watches their eyes go wide with shock as they find out there’s no fee.
“Thanks, Hermione,” he says sincerely, an awkward smile on his face. Hermione nods, and goes to leave, then hesitates. Bending down, she places a quick kiss on his cheek.
Harry feels an odd pang of anger in his chest. He didn’t fight in a war for stuff like this to still be happening, it was meant to put bigotry and hatred behind them, no matter what side someone was on. “
“Only asking.”
“I have an idea,” Harry says, moving up behind Draco and encircling his waist with his arms.
“Harry. You can’t call me Potter on my birthday.”
“There is nothing
“Will do,” Luna says cheerfully, before standing up and floating back into the crowd. Before Harry knows it, she’s gone.
“Oh,” Draco breathes out, tightening his hold on Harry.
Hermione takes the bottle from him and pouts. “You shouldn’t have, Harry. Oh, come in, gosh, it’s
“Great. Ready? Just take deep breaths and you’ll be fine.”
Draco leads Harry, still rubbing sleep out of his eyes, into their kitchen/diner and immediately he’s greeted by the smell of pancakes drifting up his nose. He almost melts. There’s a huge stack of pancakes on a plate on their kitchen island, surrounded by a little jug of syrup, a bowl of berry preserves, a sugar shaker, two empty plates with cutlery, and also two mugs. “Still hate me now?” Draco asks, rubbing his fingers against Harry’s knuckles gently.
“Yes wha–”
“Oh, indeed.” And then Harry’s kissing him again, and his lips are rough, but it doesn’t matter in the slightest because Harry is kissing him like he never wants to stop, and Draco isn’t sure that he does either. Their mouths slot together perfectly, as if they were moulded with the other’s in mind; they stay like that for a while, tongues stroking languidly and hands exploring familiar territory.
“You look dazed, Harry. I think your wrackspurts have come back.”
The plant does a backflip.
It’s clear that Malfoy notices, because he tilts his head where it’s resting against the stone. Studying him. Then he swings his other leg down from the arch and sits up, patting the space next to him. It’s permission. Harry’s never been brave enough to go up to Malfoy when his friends are around, always too scared they would tell him to piss off, or yell something else at him. They’re very protective of him, Parkinson and Zabini, hovering around him like a shield. Though Harry supposes it’s for all of the right reasons. Today, though, Malfoy’s alone; he’s set his book down, and is sitting, waiting.
Ah, the apothecary. It was a bit of an impulse purchase, on Harry’s part, for their 25th wedding anniversary. One day, he’d been walking down the newer, extended part of Diagon Alley — much easier now, as people tended to recognise him less without his ‘scruffy, boyish good looks’ (as Draco called them) and the appeal of the Chosen One losing its hold over time — when he’d spotted a
their tree, a reminder of their relationship going strong where many thought it wouldn’t. Just like the little acorn Harry had planted; no one had much hope in them, but Harry did, and look at them now. He feels oddly proud. Of the tree. Of Draco. Of himself. For letting something new into the holes of his heart, letting Draco fill up those spaces and become as much a part of himself as the tree became a part of the garden.
“I don’t have an excuse because I’m not obsessing over him, thank you very much.” Harry spears a potato with his fork, but makes no effort to eat it. “Just… don’t you think it’s a bit odd that he isn’t here?”
“Missed a spot,” Harry mumbles sleepily, voice rough from sleep, and it sends another thrill through Draco so strong he almost doesn’t register what Harry’s talking about.
“No, I saw him, this morning. He was... he was here and I kissed him and went to work and then I got home–” Draco rushed out, his breath coming in short spurts. “And he left a note. The note was written with one of his stupid muggle pens, it was all worn down–
sign hanging from the door of a surprisingly run down storefront. The wooden exterior of the shop was shoddily painted a deep navy, with holes in the wall spreading out like roots, holding a general dusty and unloved look to it. Some of the glass panes had fallen out of their frames, and others were cracked and going the same way. If he squinted, Harry could just read the text under whatever the shop had been called, stylised in gold;
can gather in a Muggle park around some random grumpy prick with a bird’s nest on his head.”
For a second, Harry thinks Malfoy’s going to turn his nose up at him. But then Malfoy’s cool hand takes his clammy one, and it feels like a moment more than a decade in the making. Oddly, he likes the fit of their hands together, Malfoy’s posh, thin fingers wrapped around his own chunky, calloused ones. A new type of warmth blooms in his chest, one that feels the same as when he watches a little flower sprout when he didn’t think anything would come of it.
“What do you mean?”
Stretching his legs out, Draco leans back again. Harry’s grinning up at him, sleep still partially clouding his features, but his eyes bright and happy, and it’s hard to believe that look is directed at him when those eyes used to look at him like he was the worst person on Earth.
