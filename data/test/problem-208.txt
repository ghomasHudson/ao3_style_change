Harry gapes at her. "I — what? Well — loads of times, of course. What sort of question is that? I mean — just this morning, she...she asked me to pick up a carton of milk on the way home...well, didn't
Harry was standing in the precise middle of all four tables. Trying to choose. Draco came in, his eyes bright, but Harry wasn’t looking at him. He was frowning, unable to decide where to sit today. Draco sat at the Hufflepuff table and decided that meant he should be helpful.
, Harry. Haven't you been trained in the art of it?"
He gets into the car and drives all the way out to Godric's Hollow, a three-hour journey. He doesn't mind. Time and distance is all relative now. He looks at some of the properties for sale. There's a cottage on the outskirts of the village, but he's not immediately drawn to it. He'll know home when he sees it, he thinks.
Still valid.
"Do you mind if I take the cartons with me?"
"You're here," Harry says slowly, testing the words just to see if they'll fall and shatter.
"What?"
“Roses,” he said, and Harry had nodded tiredly. Draco often mentioned roses. He never bothered to elaborate though, never explained.
Williamson exchanges a look with her colleagues.
He gives up waiting for Malfoy and restlessly paces the room. There's a collection of items on the dresser — a seashell, an acorn, a photograph of a sunset over a field — and a small calendar. Harry glances at it, then looks again.
They stand in silence for a long time, standing together, stars reflected above and below, and Harry feels like he's running on air.
Hermione's arm twitches slightly, as if remembering the souvenir Bellatrix's torture left behind.
Astoria regards him for a long moment. He'd expected her to be formally dressed today, as she had perhaps expected his visit this time, but apparently not. Her hair is brushed into a neat bun but there the effort ends. She wears a comfortable set of robes, designed for lounging on a sofa with a good book rather than impressing guests at dinner parties, and wears no jewellery that Harry can see besides her engagement and wedding rings.
"You should not have spoken to him like that," Narcissa says. Harry can't tell whether she's sad or angry.
somehow. Harry can picture the corridors lined with candles and restless suits of armour. The stairways worn down with centuries of footsteps. The portraits yawning and shifting. In the Great Hall, the professors would be busy hanging garlands of holly and ivy. The kitchens would be a hive of busyness as the house elves prepared the great Christmas feast.
“She’s late,” Astoria says, turning to Harry. “Just tell me, please. Have you found Draco?”
Harry's heart sinks with guilt at the anxious look on Hermione's face. "I'm...I'm all right."
It was just the three of them in the early morning. They had started off as three dark smudges in the snow, wandering round in their frozen blue and white world. Now it was lighter, the snow glowing a soft pinky-orange under the rising sun and they were sharply-defined silhouettes, walking back towards the castle.
He thanks Astoria for talking to him, telling him everything that happened. She offers tea; he declines.
"Bit trigger happy, aren't you? Look at your face! Calm down, no harm done. Try again. Go on, foot off the brake."
wait.
and then turns every ceiling into a star-filled sky as though he hasn’t spent the past few months practising that complex transfiguration just for Teddy. And Mrs Weasley’s expression will go all soft, and Andromeda will smile, and Teddy will laugh and cheer.
* * *
"It's not luck. It's precision. I know exactly when to stop, exactly how much to slow down, exactly when to turn. Don't mistake my confidence for recklessness."
"Tell them what?" Harry asks, walking slowly along the hallway as he searches for his room number.
"Well, over the course of my observations, I've decided that your impulsivity is not necessarily a negative quality."
Yes, Harry thinks. It never changes.
“You can pick it up later, or give it your address and it will fly there.” The shopkeeper gives Malfoy a scrap of paper and a quill. At that moment, another customer enters the shop and the man bustles over, leaving Malfoy to write his address and tie it to the owl’s leg. A few moments later, Malfoy opens the door, allowing the owl to fly out, and steps onto the street. In a matter of seconds, he’s gone. Harry goes to the window but since it’s the shopkeeper’s memory, the street is nothing more than a beige blur. The memory keeps refocussing on the new customer.
He was the first to finish the Panacis Potion as they headed into summer. On the last day of February, he smiled.
"I'm really sorry."
"Where are we?" Harry asks at last.
He drives around a bend in the road. Harry watches the way he grips the steering wheel, flexing the tendons in his wrist. There's a mesmerising confidence in Draco's hands, in the way he effortlessly steers, the way he drives without really thinking about it.
“There’s that noise again.”
Harry nods, feeling strangely apprehensive.
"Got stuck chatting to some people about the case." He'll tell Ginny about all of it tomorrow, he thinks. Their date. "I made a reservation at Citrus Moon, by the way."
"I must ask you to leave," Zeisel snaps, and Harry stands up.
The solicitor — Ms Zeisel, she introduces herself crisply — takes the seat behind the table and gives Harry a look over her silver spectacles. It's a look worthy of McGonagall and Harry has the absurd feeling he's about to be told off for something.
The bewitched windows offer a view of sunset over London, lighting the room in the last faint shadows of a cloudy dusk. Harry looks around the room, for a moment spotting the card sent in by Fenwick's son.
The car door opens.
"I will!"
Or maybe he'd secretly hoped the apartment was temporary. Somewhere to pause in his journey, but not the destination.
Draco covered a lot of distance, Harry's sure, but he somehow never bridged the distance between past and present.
He looks at Draco again, then reaches out.
Draco stumbled away.
But the room is empty.
Harry, nearly lulled to sleep by the fading streetlights, takes a moment to register the question.
Draco's licence.
He stocked up on toast, yawning hugely, and retreated. It occurred to Draco that Ron had woken early and come down just to tell him that.
He left.
"I thought it was a dream last time, in the car, when I saw you — "
Harry's eyes fall to Malfoy's wrist. He can see the faint curve of the serpent's tail, the beginning of the Dark Mark. The tail seems to ripple as Malfoy turns a bend in the road, flexing his wrist as he steers.
“Draco?” Hermione said sleepily, drawing her dressing gown around herself.
“Don’t be silly, Ron, you need to practise the Imperturbable Charm, and that requires a lot of wandwork,” Hermione said, and Ron groaned. As he cautiously hinted about using his time to laze around and ‘recover’ instead (much to Hermione’s firm objecting), Harry walked along silently, listening.
"The bones," Harry says.
"I didn't travel all this way to tell a story of circles. I came here to ask if you intend to find my son."
* * *
* * *
It's odd, Harry thinks, how he and Ron always thought hearing Draco apologise would be their moment of victory.
"I didn't say anything."
"This is real," he says.
“You know I’ll beat you.”
the worst thing, Harry realises. Draco could be anywhere right now, and the worst part is knowing that Draco doesn't want to be found. Harry can search all he want, but he'll never find him. Only Draco can bring himself home.
"Ever the annoying optimist," Draco says wryly.
playing games, you mean," he calls over his shoulder. "
"I didn't hate it," Draco snaps.
"Celebrating my full licence. Thought I'd go see a bit of coast somewhere."
Malfoy is staring at him.
"I put in overtime and carried out the tests this morning, just so you'd stop visiting my office every five minutes and requesting updates," Butterworth says irritably, but Harry's grateful nevertheless. "Here's the results." A piece of paper flutters through the fireplace and Harry snatches it up quickly, skimming past all the typical file information until he's reached the only part that matters.
Draco watched them again at five o’clock in the morning, circling the lake. Not talking. No need to talk. Harry skimmed rocks. Hermione drew patterns in the snow with her wand. Ron methodically melted the leaves, one by one, from a tall tree that had not managed to shed its leaves in time for winter. The icicles melted away to reveal the rich gold beneath.
"Was it stress?" Hermione asks. "I know they've offered you that promotion to Head Auror, and — oh, Harry," she adds with sudden misery. "Your supervisor has spent the last three weeks frantically trying to contact you. I...I don't think you'll get the Head Auror position now."
“Where do you think you’re going?” someone pushed him roughly.
"Watching me watching you," Harry says. "Another circle."
"Well," Butterworth says after a moment, "Magical signature available?"
"Just a quick question, that's all," Harry says. "Regarding the owl he purchased. Did it ever return to the shop?"
* * *
an insult? All I said was — "
Zeisel's face closes up; all the muscles tighten and her mouth turns into a narrow, unforgiving line. "The Malfoy family has plenty of holiday houses and overseas residences. I suggest, Mr Potter, that if you want to find Mr Malfoy, you start there. Rather than throwing around baseless accusations," she adds coldly.
He packs up the carton and goes to find Narcissa.
* * *
Narcissa takes the other chair, glancing once across the apartment. It's a surprisingly clear day for London, and she seems to pause to take in the view. Then she opens the small purse in her lap and pulls out a photograph, placing it face-up on the table.
"I don't know where you are," Harry says, his mouth dry. "I'm trying to find you."
Draco's getting better.
"Not really. It's hard to remember. But there were little lights, weren't there?"
"Thanks."
They all groan again. “You’re banned from naming things,” Draco tells him.
" — but you really need to focus on other things," Hermione says, fetching two mugs and tapping her wand against the teapot, warming the water. "Harry, I know you don't want to hear this, but..." She looks at him with a gentle expression. "Sometimes, even after we've done everything we can, things still don't work out. Sometimes we have to let go."
Harry sits at the counter, but the apartment seems too silent.
Harry drops the clasp onto the middle of Hermione and Ron's dining table. Hermione stares at it, her eyes wide.
“What, is it a letter to your dad?” somebody muttered nearby and the laughter rose like flames.
A new scene forms, and for a moment Harry is disoriented. Then he remembers Astoria said she gave him memories, plural.
looks, as he's been taught to do with any item of evidence.
Ron’s bed was empty, just like yesterday. Sure enough he was in the common room, reading by the fire (which had by now settled into dull grey-red coals).
Malfoy lifts his hands from the wheel and the car begins to coast to the right; Astoria cries out. Harry laughs before he realises what he's doing.
Harry walks towards it. As he walks closer, he can see the faint outline of someone sitting in the driver's seat. He puts a hand on the passenger-side handle and opens the door, pausing a moment before getting in and shutting the door again.
Harry, perhaps slightly meanly, doesn’t argue with that.
"I can give you the memory," she says slowly, "of our last meeting. The last time I saw him. Perhaps it may help."
“Take him for a walk.”
* * *
Just a little.
Harry has responsibilities. Things he left behind. People waiting for him. He doesn't want Hermione or Ron to worry, of course, and he wants to send them another owl, let them know he's all right. But he finds himself caring very little about everything else.
Harry gestures frantically. “See? Like
He was good at that part. Very good in the field. But, as his supervisors explained cautiously, he was not good at the investigative side of it.
Malfoy's hand.
Draco had porridge. His hands were shaking again, and Harry gently took the spoon from his hands, moved the bowl away from him. He looked at the letters engraved into Draco’s left hand.
It doesn't feel like it, he thinks.
* * *
“What happened? Didn’t the luck potion work?” Ron demands. “You look like you’ve had the day from hell.”
Autumn has well and truly arrived in Wiltshire. The fields are a pale gold; the trees seem ablaze in the afternoon sunlight, their scarlet leaves lit richly. Draco drives along a narrow country road, the same sort of road on which Harry spent hours learning to drive. An oak tree curves overhead, sending dappled shade dancing over the car for a fleeting moment, and Harry's reminded of the ancient Welsh oaks of Snowdonia. The narrow lane soon joins a wider road. A map of arteries, leading to the heart of nowhere.
But it’s not.
"I know, I know, it's stupid, I should have notified Narcissa and — "
"An ivory merchant goes to Africa for a lovely little holiday," Draco says lightly. Harry gives him a look.
"So I can't even see him?" Astoria looks like someone's hit her with a hex. "What absolute rubbish! I'm practically family, if I want to see Draco then they can't stop me."
"She told me herself that she has little choice. This could be her last chance to find her son."
Draco laughs bitterly. "I'm sure you have."
They leave Landewednack the next day. Draco drives. Harry listens to the sound of the ocean fade behind them, but he doesn't look back.
"Do you think he was depressed at all?" Hermione asks gently.
Deep down, there's another reason he learned to drive, but he's not ready to voice it just yet.
Draco said and it was a whisper, a thin murmur, but it rode across the hall as though an invisible wind had seized it and carried it like a leaf. Out of the wand burst a silver fox that turned and looked at them before it evaporated, loose smoke of silver curling away into the enchanted ceiling.
* * *
"I have to leave."
The following day, Harry receives an owl from Astoria asking him to visit that afternoon. He arrives around two o'clock, wondering if she'll give him more memories.
"The extraction worked."
Draco shifts the gear into reverse. His eyes flick to the mirror again and the movement is so familiar that Harry has to look away to hide his smile.
Harry waits. Draco touches a hand to the window, his fingers ghosting across the cold glass as if he’s trying to ground himself somehow.
"I'm sorry," Draco says.
Lucius sinks into one of the armchairs. "You were always better at dealing with his moods."
"Well, you see, Potter, there was this marvelous Muggle invention in the 1960s, called a 'bank card' — "
"Draco Malfoy contacted me a week earlier, stating that he required legal counsel."
"Again? I've never been here." Harry doesn't know how else to respond.
"I should have noticed."
Harry sat across from him.
"In a manner of speaking."
A short silence fell over the compartment; they were all too scared to ask. Except, of course, Luna.
Maybe Draco dreams of all the times he failed.
Williamson coughs. "Potter, I suggest you heed my recommendation and take a few days to think about it. Let's not make decisions we may regret later."
Harry feels like someone is slowly squeezing his heart. Suffocating him. He can't focus at work; he tries driving but even that has become meaningless now.
He's hit first with a sense of motion, like flying but not quite, and he feels nauseous for a moment before the rest of the scene rolls over him like a tide. He's sitting in the back seat of a car.
Harry was sitting at the Hufflepuff table.
Far below, in the street, someone's whistling again.
It sounds like a name that belongs in a story, Harry thinks. Some fairytale realm, or a kingdom in a faraway world. Harry gazes into the lake, watching the stars glimmer across its surface. A shooting star briefly flashes across the sky, leaving a fading trail of light.
"Well, I'm hoping to find something. Speaking of finding things — you wouldn't happen to know of a good mechanic, would you?"
"Sounds good."
Draco stands beside him, staring out across the sea.
"I can't believe you found it," she says. Ron sits opposite Harry, a mug of tea steaming in one hand.
“If Draco hid the time-turner somewhere in the past,” he says, “do you have any idea where it might be? Perhaps a favourite place in the manor, or a hidden area he sometimes used?”
There's a brief and childish tussle over the bathroom. Draco wins after clocking Harry over the head with his toothbrush.
“Everything,” Draco murmurs.
“Month?” Harry asks, wishing he could leave already, retreat back to the soothingly cool halls of the Ministry. Butterworth flicks his wand.
"Don't be daft, go and have fun," Harry says, and Ginny smiles as she kisses him again in farewell, rushing out the door again. A moment later, there's a brief pop as she Disapparates.
“Hermione? Who is it?”
"Sometimes," Draco allows.
Harry stands up and walks to the sliding door, pulling it open and stepping out onto the balcony. The apartment seems suffocating somehow, as if it's closing in on him. Outside, the air is crisp and Harry shivers, drawing his cloak closer around himself. It's chillier here than in East Devon. There'll be fog over the Thames tomorrow morning, he'll wager.
Hermione and Ron halted. “What noise?”
He steps around the corner and smiles at her. She's sitting in bed, intently reading a copy of the Quidditch magazine, and jumps when Harry clears his throat.
* * *
“I’m sorry, I - ”
Harry sits silently in the room for a long time, watching the sun slowly diminish in the sky. The sun won't set for another hour or so. Summer is slowly unfurling across the country. Distantly, he can hear the faint chimes of Big Ben, marking half-five. Someone will no doubt be along shortly to usher Harry out. Footsteps echo along the corridor and Harry exhales slowly, then looks at Draco.
She checks her watch. “Twenty minutes left.”
Maybe it's a person.
"I received a Ministry owl several days ago," she says, "stating that my son's case had been re-opened and is under your management."
"Maybe," Harry says evasively, but Ron doesn't look bothered by the lukewarm response.
important, he reminds himself irritably. Elderly people, losing their life savings to greedy criminals...of course it's important. Far more important than, for example, bringing someone home.
“Today we are learning how to concoct the Panacis Potion," Slughorn began.
* * *
"I did not!" Ron says quickly. "I said...he's been...staying
“No. You will also be given smaller tasks to complete. The Panacis has to be allowed to sit for several amounts of time; this allows for lessons to be put aside for other potions.” He paused, as if withholding a large treat, then grinned round. “I’ll be making the potion too, so you can compare your progress to mine.”
Yes. Harry remembers that quiet moment, buried in the depths of December. Draco, standing alone, illuminated by the faint glow of the Christmas lights. Harry had reached for him and he had faded like a ghost. Before their hands even had the chance to touch. Harry looks down at his own hand for a moment, at the way his wrist flexes as he picks up the kettle and pours the water.
Saturday.
He glances up hopefully. He feels like he's being watched.
"Is that what you're looking for?"
"You'd know better than me, but...I think he was searching for something. A memory, a state of mind, a new life, I don't know."
Malfoy turns again, sunlight winking off the small silver clasp. Harry studies it for a moment. It strikes him as unusual, if only because he’d expect a large and ornate clasp — something worthy of wealth and prestige. A large gold serpent, perhaps, with jewels for eyes. Not a tiny silver snitch.
She nods, coming over to sit in the armchair opposite Harry. “When did you take the Felix Felicis?”
In the beginning is the end.
He stares at the page. November 21. A date apparently selected at random.
The words are out before Harry can stop them. "You don't seem like someone Malfoy would marry."
“Yes.” Draco smiled in relief. Harry nodded and smiled, the first time he had done so directed at Draco. He stood up and left. Draco presumed Hermione had banished him to the library for missed homework.
Away, he thought. I go away, where the Shadow cannot follow.
“Yes,” he said, his voice taut with barely-masked emotion. Hermione must have seen it in his eyes, in the way he was holding himself. He hated being so readable, so predictable. He managed a tight smile, feeling his hair curling at the nape of his neck, the rain making it damp and untamed.
"Isn't it? I wish we'd been able to afford an apartment in central London."
Harry goes inside, setting his empty glass on the counter. He takes the ice-tray from the freezer, popping ice cubes into the glass and listening to the tink of glass against ice. Then he pours honey-coloured rum over the ice, pausing when he hears a knock at the door. He sets the bottle down and crosses the room, half-expecting a surprise visit from Ginny as he opens the door.
"You know," Harry says, "I have no idea what I'm doing."
about it."
Within minutes, he's asleep.
him. With tears in their eyes, they thank him as he tells them their loved one is dead.
what you took away from this conversation? God, Malfoy, you can be so..." He shakes his head.
"Want me to navigate?"
Harry says nothing, taking a leisurely sip of his drink. Ron frowns.
Harry turns around, scanning the shop.
Draco said and wondered if it had made Harry smile later on, when he was alone.
"Battery needs replacing," Harry says decisively, pleased to at least know something. He tries a Reparo spell but it doesn't work. "I'll have to research automative spells," he says, getting out of the car and shutting the door.
It's the last day of summer.
"I know."
"How much?"
When Harry was a fresh-faced Auror, twenty years old and eyes sharp with eager enthusiasm, a white-knuckled grip on his wand and a mind clear as sunlight, he thought he knew exactly what his job was. Saving lives and saving people through tangible work: footsteps racing along alleyways and hexes darting like frightened rabbits, skin-bruising tackles and flashy counter-spells.
"You noticed," Harry says slowly. Hermione and Ron had noticed too, asking Harry if something had happened. He'd told them the truth: he'd found a possible match for Draco. It'd been a relief just to tell them, and that had helped a little.
"Kind of makes me wish I'd grown up in Wiltshire," Harry comments. Draco looks at him, then glances back across the field, to that crisp horizon of gold meeting blue.
, Harry thinks. And he's getting better.
Harry turns his gaze briefly to the cloudless blue sky, and thinks the canola meadows will be harvested soon, the sunshine-yellow flowers lopped off, the plants left to wither in the last of the summer heat.
"Narcissa and Draco were both acquitted. The past doesn't matter to my parents, anyway. They just wanted to see me happy, and they adored Draco. During our courtship, he became my closest friend."
And, on the second of May — the eighth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts — Harry finds the time-turner.
," he mutters, getting rid of the owl droppings around his door, and steps over a sleepy pygmy owl. Ginny's.
try finding something to do in Birmingham," Draco retorts.
* * *
* * *
Draco's faint smile is giving way to clear amusement. "Are you always this articulate when you're tired, Potter?"
“See, it's alright for us, we've got each other. But him, he's got no-one.”
“That's not true,” Ron said quietly. “Harry would never leave this shirt behind.”
"Better," Ginny says, her eyes bright with excitement. "Harry...I've done it. I've made the English National Team."
"Back in a minute," Harry says. He just needs a moment to collect himself, without Draco observing him.
Harry parks the Renault and makes his way past the reception, up the two flights of stairs, and to his empty room.
“Not who you were expecting, eh?” Ron glanced up at Draco's expression. “Listen, I'm sorry about Hermione. She just — she gets a little impatient sometimes.” Ron watched as Draco raked a hand through wild hair, the strands catching on his silver ring. The same ring Harry had given him so many years ago, a token of love and forgiveness. “I thought I should pop in and see if you were alright. Well, obviously you're not alright, but — ”
“Well, it’s north, wherever it is,” Harry says as Draco drives, the streetlights flashing past.
"Hullo," he says cheerfully, holding out a hand. Harry shakes it. "Nice to meet you. Had much luck finding Astoria's mysterious ex-husband, then?"
"Or road atlases."
"This is amazing," Ginny says. "I'm on the reserves, of course, but it's generally a stepping stone to a full-time position. I know one of their Chasers is heading into early retirement from a bad back injury, and I've been told that if I prove myself in practice, I have a legitimate chance at filling the position."
"So have you," Harry says, disentangling his hand slightly to brush a fingertip over the faded curve of a serpent's tail.
"Would've been better if you'd been there."
This is Draco's memory. How can it exist while Draco isn't here? It doesn't make sense.
Hogwarts rises up from the Scottish wilderness like a craggy mountain of stone and turrets. It glitters in the darkness with a hundred tiny lights. There’s a glow coming from the Gryffindor common room, and a matching one in the Ravenclaw tower. Though most of the students would have gone home for Christmas, the castle still seems so
The war had been particularly hard on Molly too but she was grimly determined to fight her way out of the depression that Fred’s death brought. “Some people lost so much more,” she had said and Harry thought of Teddy Lupin crying out for parents that he would never see.
Harry looks ahead.
The Shadow was upon them but at the same time, it wasn’t.
Harry spends most of the night staring at the ceiling.
He took a Gnargle heart.
* * *
. He uses a sticking charm to attach the photograph of Malfoy to the page. He looks at it for a long time, waiting for a scowl or rude gesture, but Malfoy just gazes at some point past Harry, clearly locked in deep thought.
“But — ”
Draco doesn't move.
Harry floos to Matthew and Astoria's house late in the afternoon. He has a driving lesson, although it couldn't be further from his mind. Mr Weasley had spoken to the Magical Law Enforcement Department and explained they would be able to send along their Muggle Liaison officer to sufficiently 'negotiate' with the Muggle police officers and gain access to the DNA sample. The sample would then be sent to Butterworth, who could analyse it for a match in magical signature.
"You dreamed of Malfoy? And he told you he went to Helston?"
And now he knows it's real, and he'll come to his senses. He'll thank Harry for the cup of tea, stand up, and walk out that door like it's effortless. Like it all cost him nothing, and maybe it did.
Narcissa takes a long sip of the gin and tonic, and she seems inclined to rebuke Harry for speaking of such personal matters. However, she catches sight of the Renault keycard in Harry's hand and seems to change her mind.
"Whenever he felt like it, yes. Sometimes he'd just get in the car and drive and drive."
Harry had meant what he'd said to Draco.
"Anyone could access it."
Harry's heart quickens. "Let's go to where you are."
The Renault is recovering very well from its three-year abandonment, and the engine purrs smoothly when Harry starts the car. He pauses for a moment, then reaches for the maps kept in the glovebox. Why not take a scenic route to Wiltshire? He'll be two hours late anyway; what's another hour matter? Draco has drawn a line along the coastal roads. Draco likes the coast, Harry thinks. Liminal places. People are drawn to those sorts of areas, where lines are blurred and dualities are drawn. Land and water but not quite both, not quite either.
...but there was never anyone else. Just a brief crush on Cho, and a relationship with Ginny that quickly flattened out into a uncertain connection that was lost over time and distance.
It’s a warm September day. Summer is still fading from the earth. He’ll purchase a new owl and go home and...
Draco showed the first emotion for months, jerking away from Harry as if he’d been burnt. “I am
Draco's licence.
He nearly forgets that the memory belongs to Narcissa, but then Narcissa is stepping through the doorway and staring at Lucius. The room sharpens into view: a study, with an oak desk in one corner and two armchairs by a marble fireplace.
— somewhere between standing still and running on air — Harry started to feel something for Draco. Affection, maybe even attraction.
"I won't."
Blood spattered across his face and he woke, his wand clutched in one hand, the wand of someone long gone in the other. He was shaking and pale but he dressed with weak and trembling fingers. When he ate breakfast, his spoon clinked gently against his bowl as his hands shook.
“Draco — “
"Know, or think?"
Draco's gaze suddenly refocuses and Harry realises that Draco's staring at him in the reflection of the window. Watching Harry watching him.
The last carriage rushes through and soon the dark line of the train has disappeared around a curve of the rails. The warning bell abruptly stops its constant noise; the red light flickers and dies. Draco pulls his hand away, takes the handbrake off as the crossing gate rises, and drives over the tracks.
"Tell you what, if you found Malfoy after all this time, I reckon Williamson'll give you any assignment you want! We'll be going on fieldwork together before you know it." Ron grins. "Never thought I'd say it, but you need any help finding Malfoy — just ask, I'll see what I can do."
"Snowdonia."
Harry drives back Astoria and Matthew's home for the usual routine — a butterbeer or two in front of the roaring fire while Harry regales Matthew with stories of the wizarding world. Matthew seems to be quite fascinated with dragons.
"You — you asked about Malfoy? Why?"
his memories.”
"And?" he prompts. Astoria glances up at him.
“That one, sir?” the shopkeeper asks Malfoy. Harry glances up and watches Malfoy nod at the plain-looking barn owl.
," he whispers.
"Do what?" he asks drowsily.
Harry looks down at his empty glass, then pushes it aside and catches the bartender's eye.
"What do you think?" Harry prompts, worried, and Hermione looks at Ron, then back to Harry.
Draco wrote in them. Little notes, scribbled in the margins, from the very first
“Double potions on a Monday morning! I should have stayed with George at the shop,” moaned Ron.
Harry shoves at Draco, making him stumble slightly, but Draco just regains his balance and smiles at him. No, not smiles, Harry thinks, watching the faint curve of Draco's lips. Smirks. Harry hadn't realised how much he missed that smirk.
"Oh," Harry says.
"You all right, mate?" Ron frowns.
"See you soon," he says, and she nods and steps out the door, Disapparating a moment later.
To Harry, it's a weary journey that he must think about, and he's painfully, consciously aware of the exact measurements of the home to which he's going. A two-bedroom apartment in Westminster, polished and sleek, commanding a modest view over the skyline of south-west London. It had cost an uncomfortable amount of money but it was in an ideal location. Perfect as a home base for Ginny, who had to frequently travel across the United Kingdom for her Quidditch matches. And, as she had said when she first booked an inspection for the apartment, the perfect place for Harry, so close to the Ministry.
Harry stops there. He puts the file down and stands up, then wonders where he’s going. To Ron, to share the file? To Hermione, to ask what she thinks? He shakes his head. It won’t be news to them. Lucius Malfoy went missing in the summer of 2002 and Draco Malfoy had, as ever, imitated his father and disappeared one year later. Harry, in the midst of his Auror training and in a heady rush of his new life — engaged to Ginny, celebrating Ron and Hermione’s marriage, avoiding reporters as he breezily Apparated to casual get-togethers with Neville and Luna and all the rest — had barely registered the news. Malfoy had probably retreated to a sunny Italian villa or French château along with his supposedly missing father, Harry had thought unkindly. Well, at least karma caught up to one of the Malfoys: Lucius, unlike Draco, had still been awaiting trial at the time of his disappearance and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The Aurors caught him in the winter of 2003. Harry’s colleagues had been floating on a cloud of euphoria after tracking and capturing the elusive Lucius Malfoy, but the victory had proven bitterly short-lived — Lucius had died during the capture due to a rebounding curse.
"Can I help you?" they asked him, and he shook his head each time.
“I thought Socrates was the greatest wizard,” Ginny adds. “Apparently he’s well-known in the Muggle world too.”
"Oh." Ginny pauses and looks about the restaurant, as if searching for a conversation topic. "It's interesting, isn't it, a Muggle restaurant? I was about to tap my wand on the menu items to order them. Nearly forgot."
But Harry's becoming very adept at picking up magical signatures these days, particularly after his Investigative Division training. There's magic drifting around the front door, but it's not Hermione's nor Ron's.
," Harry says with frustration. "He said the memories were real, that they weren't dreams, and I needed to find him — "
Harry slowly walks to the still-green flames and Floos away, arriving in Astoria and Matthew's fireplace.
A week passes.
— serving as a glorified bodyguard for the Minister. Standing about in a smart uniform, twiddling my thumbs."
listen to all Ron’s rants! If I didn’t know better — ”
. Oh, Merlin. That word, framed by Draco's thin, pale lips. Something in Harry broke. Love. A new word tonight.
"I might. It will cost you, though."
Harry laughs. "We're not
But before they know it, Malfoy has finished the sale and left. Hermione gives Harry an apologetic look.

"I am
Draco took longer to wander down to the Slytherin dungeons and when Theo saw him he smiled.
Then Draco smiles. It's a crashing relief to Harry, who remembers only too well the agony on Draco's face when he last vanished.
exist, either.”
Draco drives on. Evening has long since melted into night, and the headlights flash past on the opposite lane. Harry watches the monotonous patterns of light flick across the asphalt.
, Ginny had said, and Harry had pointed out, quite calmly, that he
“What? Even
And the Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt, had told them that the days of the Fudge ministry were over (and Scrimgeour — but he had happened so quickly, people just tended to push him aside) and that this wasn’t the sort of government that went around locking up people and all that now.
London appears as nothing more than a faint orange haze on the horizon, a blur of lights illuminating the smog hanging low over the city. The city creeps up slowly, like a tide slowly encompassing them. The rows of houses soon rise and fall, crescendoing into apartment blocks and office buildings, and soon, Harry realises, he's nearly home.
"Don't tell me you've never seen a canola field? They're everywhere."
“No,” Draco said. “No, we have to look for him, he — ”
"Look," he says, reaching for Draco's hand. Draco looks startled, but doesn't pull away when Harry wraps his hand around Draco's. "When you were trapped in time, we couldn't make contact, could we? So this must be real."
“Do you feel brave?” he asked.
“Organise a study session in the library,” Hermione said brightly and they all groaned.
"I gathered as much." Harry picks up the folder and flips it open. A group of international scam artists are using love potions and romance charms to swindle elderly wizards and witches out of their savings. There are locations, dates, photographs of suspects, and pages of bank statements. Harry frowns and turns the pages, skimming over the rows of dates and locations.
Draco glanced up. Ron held it out, the material soft in his hand, Harry's scent embedded permanently in the soft cotton.
“I know it's strange, but this feels a little like first year,” Harry said. Like it was their first trip on the train all over again...
* * *
, Harry thinks, but he hasn't got the courage yet to say it aloud.
Harry stands on the balcony, watching the people hurry below. Earlier in the day, the streets were eerily empty, but now — in the last remaining hour of daylight — people are beginning to trickle home from their trips.
"You trust easily." The words are uttered more from surprise than anything else; the Narcissa Malfoy he remembers certainly wouldn't trust him with her son's precious memories or secrets.
What would Ginny say if he sold the apartment and bought a country home?
Astoria nods. "My parents...well, they might not be Voldemort supporters, but they're still old-fashioned. If I had married a Muggle, I would have broken my father's heart. My mother might be more understanding, but my father..."
They take quite a meandering route to Dover, leaving the M2 to weave around the coastline, and the relatively short trip soon becomes a lengthy journey. They reach Margate at midnight — Dover is still about an hour away, Harry calculates. He's beginning to feel tired. Draco seems to notice, for he tells Harry to pull over and they switch seats.
"Your keycard," Harry says, holding it out.
"The sample was Muggle. Complete absence of magical signature."
"It is strange," she says, every word stiff with forced composure, "to hear that noise, after all this time." She lifts her wand and waves it at the southern wall; it disappears completely and Harry frowns, not understanding until Narcissa looks at him again. "You wanted to drive it," she says, and Harry feels a jolt run through him.
Matthew frowns. "She's just putting Sophie to bed. Listen, is this about her ex-husband? She's been very upset lately. Maybe you should talk about it tomorrow."
He lifts the wand. "
"Did she? How fascinating." Draco takes the glass tumblers from Harry's hands, his fingers brushing fleetingly along Harry's.
Narcissa doesn’t cry. She stares into the heart of the fireplace, at the bright flames flickering behind the grate, and her eyes are dry. All she ever wanted was her family to be complete, together again, and Harry’s heart suddenly aches for her.
There. On the underside of the beam, carved into the wood in tiny numbers.
"Want one?" he asks instead, holding up the Double Decker with a hint of a challenge in his voice.
It's taken her this long — nearly three months — to completely search the manor, investigating every item, every room, to make sure no possible time-turner hid within. If the time-turner had gone with Draco, rather than being left behind, surely Draco would have hidden it at the manor.
The faceless shadows shifted restlessly in his mind and he stared at a dusty desktop for ten minutes, jolting suddenly as he realised this was McGonagall’s old classroom. There was a dark shadow across the wall and as he approached it he realised it was actually a long, dark smear of blood. No doubt a lone struggle had happened in here. Somebody had been injured or died (perhaps a stranger had stumbled across the body later, and carried it down to the Great Hall to join the rest), and as the wizards and witches came later to scrub the Hall clean, to restore the magnificent corridors and rooms, this one had somehow been overlooked.
Or maybe it's not funny, maybe it's just depressing and makes Harry feel like going back to the Renault Mégane and driving, driving, driving, until Draco comes back again and then everything will be all right.
"Nothing."
"Money is not an obstacle."
Holdsworth looks at him, tilting her head as she does whenever she finds something particularly interesting. "Disappearing people are our specialty," she says, then turns and leaves.
Draco sat in it to see if he’d feel any different. He looked down and saw the words carved deep into the desk.
But Draco doesn't say anything except, "Turn onto Sutton Road," and it doesn't take Harry long to realise Draco's taking them home again.
"Got all your paperwork?" he asks.
* * *
How many times has he imagined Draco coming home?
"How'd you find out about that?"
* * *
Draco glances at him, still smiling faintly. "Of course. It was my home, wasn't it? All those days I spent running through the wheat-fields and climbing trees...I used to catch frogs by the creek, and make little sailboats from old copies of the Daily Prophet...I always thought those little boats would eventually find their way to the ocean. They might leave England, but I never would."
Harry stares at the empty doorway for a long time, then slowly opens his desk drawer. All the old files are still here, including...
“Is our whole grade marked on this one potion?” Hermione asked anxiously.
Draco doesn't seem too enthusiastic, but he doesn't outright argue as Harry finds his way to the pier. The beachfront area is filled with confused tourists, irritated locals, and cafés with loud music. The beach itself is crowded with families. School holidays, Harry remembers. There's far too many children shrieking and kicking sand about.
And then, the second realisation rolls in like thunder when Ginny smiles and asks Harry what his big announcement is.
He departs with a handful of Floo powder before Matthew can retort. Hermione follows in a more dignified manner, kissing Astoria’s cheek and thanking her for dinner before stepping into the green flames. Then Ginny, giving a cheerful wave as she goes.
He did it for them. Of course.
Harry reached out and placed something on the table.
He can see the lights of South Lambeth across the river, reflected in the glittering darkness of the River Thames; a train is approaching the above-ground platforms, visible only as an even line of lights crawling along. A moment later another train leaves, picking up speed.
That's what Draco yelled about sometimes, in his little beige room with the window looking out onto a brick wall. They enchanted it each day to show different scenery, though Harry knew Draco never saw any of it. Just his demons. He'd be walking around, shouting, raising a defiant fist to some invisible foe. “Demons, the demons,” he'd say. Sometimes he shouted it, like a curse. Sometimes he murmured it, as one whispers a lover's name. Harry preferred the mindless shouting to the wretched whispers.
Going back to the apartment feels strange. Draco was only there for three nights, but somehow the apartment feels despairingly empty.
Astoria's worry is quickly turning to fury. Harry listens to her rant about the injustice of it all; he went through the exact same cycle of emotion and so he simply nods along sympathetically until Astoria has stalked away to furiously accost Healers. Harry also went through that particular phase. In fifteen or twenty minutes, he thinks, she'll reappear and collapse, defeated, into the chair again.
"Yes, fascinating," Harry says dryly, watching as Draco sets the glasses down and opens the bottle of Glenmorangie.
He jumped.
The bell chimes softly and Harry turns, half-expecting to see Draco walk into the shop and speak:
They walk into the centre and sit in the waiting area. Harry had spent the entire morning wondering if he should just call off the test. Why did he start learning to drive, anyway? He's fully qualified at Apparating and has portkeys, he can use the Floo network and the Ministry can even provide him with driverless cars.
“Five or six years.”
"Maybe I was wrong," Draco repeats, his gaze intense and searching. "Maybe we could have been friends."
“It means that Death Eaters are not welcome.”
Astoria's mouth looks like a bruised petal, Harry thinks. She shakes her head. "I can't go back in there. I can't
Everything, Harry thinks.
“I said yeah,” Ron said, allowing himself a happier smile. “It’s good, you know…for him to keep busy with things. For both of us. Thinking of the future. I told him I’ve had to come back here though for my final year, so Lee Jordan’s stepped in temporarily. Just till I’ve finished my education, as Mum puts it.”
"High chance it's a match, then."
Harry doesn't reply. He stares into the flames. He just left. Draco just left. Went back to the manor.
Then again, it seems everything reminds him of Draco these days. The nights remind him of the sea of stars in Snowdonia, and the lonely autumn winds remind him of the wave-lashed Cornish coast. The fair weather conjures the feel of butter-yellow canola flowers and pale blue skies, and the rain makes him think of falling asleep in the Renault, listening to the faint swish of the window wipers, seeing the water droplets stream across the windscreen. Watching Draco's wrists flex as he steered around the corners.
Monday morning finds Harry in his office again, watching Astoria's newest memory.
Well, he won't apologise, he thinks stubbornly. Draco hadn't been reasonable either, after all. Harry might take a little blame, but only, for example, a quarter.
Harry drinks the Felix Felicis an hour before he leaves. Twelve hours of liquid luck. He has to pause a moment to let the feeling of carefree euphoria wash over him as he downs the potion. Then he heads towards the front door, planning to Disapparate once he's outside the door, but somehow he just keeps walking.
Draco had taken a Dreamless potion.
He looks over at Draco and catches a quick flash of uncertainty crossing his face.
"Refreshments," Narcissa says, and the house-elf bows low before vanishing again. Narcissa sweeps away, leaving Harry to follow until they enter a formal sitting room. Harry looks around the room: there's plenty of places to sit, but he opts to walk over to the window. Narcissa is silent, but Harry doesn't feel the need to speak. He waits, staring out over the manor grounds until the house-elf appears again. He doesn't turn from the view, waiting as he hears the clink of glasses and the fading footsteps of the house-elf.
Harry starts, and looks around. “Yes. Somewhere around here.”
* * *
He leaves the office quickly, shutting the door a bit too loudly behind him.
He expects to be taken to a sitting room or reception hall, but Narcissa leads him straight up the stairs, into the family quarters, and to a narrow door. She unlocks it with a tap of her wand and opens the door, the smell of dust and disuse rising from the room like a wave. Harry glances at Narcissa, then walks in.
Harry had been surprised when he first disarmed Draco, seizing the wand and fleeing with it. He'd expected the wand to be resistant and somehow unfriendly (though he'd absolutely dreaded using Bellatrix's wand). But the wand had been no different than using, for example, Hermione's, and had proved itself an excellent wand in lieu of Harry's own.
On the bad days, he'd call it the whispering dark. “The whispering dark is inside my head,” he'd say. On good days, the darkness was silent, a malevolent shadow watching and waiting. Never sleeping, never dying.
“We?” Ron repeats gloomily.
"A good opportunity?" Harry says angrily.
Astoria frowns at him and Harry tries to unsuccessfully hide his smile.
The words are quickly crossed out. A draft of a letter, Harry realises, for just beneath it, Draco attempts a second approach.
“I thought Slytherins would have worshipped them.”
Or the Renault Mégane, but then Harry remembers it might not exist in whatever time era Draco is caught in. Regardless, he searches the Renault and finds nothing. The time-turner would need to be hidden extremely well to prevent it from being stolen or found by the wrong sort of person, but surely Draco would have left clues...
"Yeah," Harry says, staring at the wall opposite. There's nothing on it. Only whiteness. A blank canvas.
He wakes with a painful rush of adrenalin, a cry half-buried in his throat.
"I'll drive again."
* * *
"I heard Draco's awake," Harry says, his voice still a little curt.
"I never said that to you," he says at last.
No, he decides.
"It's about trust, Harry," Hermione says.
Their rule.
, Draco's written on one page. Harry frowns and reads the title of the spell. Tranquillo Charm, apparently used to calm people and lessen fear or anxiety.
That's what Draco had said, and Harry had promised. Draco doesn't want anyone to know, so they
"I will."
His faint irritation vanishes, however, when he sees the note scribbled on the cover of the file.
Ron lights up as if it’s Christmas, eyes brightening as he leans forward. “Mate, you wouldn’t believe it. We’ve been staking out this place for months...”
"Thanks." He steps into the kitchen; Ron's perched by the island counter, poring over a copy of
"Listen, I've got to go to work — I've got a meeting with the Head of Magical Creatures — but..." Hermione pauses. "Maybe Malfoy was telling you his location, in that dream."
"Right here?"
So there's really no reason for human contact anymore, Harry thinks dully. He pushes Draco's cup of tea across the counter, resisting the urge to let their fingers brush. Seems to be a common theme to his thoughts tonight, he thinks. Hands, reaching for each other. Wouldn't that look strange, Draco's Dark Mark next to
he said, and wished it was always that easy.
Harry arrives home at eleven o'clock that night, smiling and thinking how he'll share the news with Ginny. He can legally drive. He's got a car licence — provisional, of course, but by the end of the year he might even have a full licence. It seems important, somehow. A milestone. Ginny hasn't even noticed his driving lessons, and...
Harry looks around, but there's no lighthouse. There's nothing. Not even a window of light from a house, or distant headlights. Only the half-moon overhead illuminates the scene, casting a faint glow over the ocean.
* * *
When he finally awoke, alone in his dormitory, and stumbled to breakfast the teachers had managed to remove most of it. But the damage was done and the students were snickering amongst themselves. As he walked into the Great Hall a wave of laughter and jeers greeted him.
"Did you like the memory?" Astoria asks, measuring out a spoonful of sugar for Harry's mug. "It's one of my favourites."
He may as well work, then.
Harry jumps and swears loudly, then flushes as he realises Narcissa is standing near the driver's side.
He's not going to be Head Auror. They tell him they're considering another candidate and give him disapproving looks, parroting Ron's words: "We need someone more...reliable," they say. Williamson takes him aside and reassures him that, if the position is vacant in a few years and Harry has 'sorted himself out', he should still apply for it.
"You mean the one on the opposite side of the road?" Malfoy says dryly.
Narcissa nods. "I never understood why Draco bothered with these ridiculous Muggle contraptions." She holds out a plastic rectangle and Harry stares at it uncomprehendingly. "It's the key," she says with an air of faint irritation.
"No, I'm talking about it today," Harry says firmly, and Matthew looks at him. For a moment, Harry thinks he's about to tell Harry to leave, but then footsteps sound and a voice cuts through the tension.
It's nighttime. The stars are high and clear above him, crisply white like winter's first snow. He's standing on the edge of a cliff, staring out at waves rolling in like low thunder, breaking against the cliff face and sending sea foam whirling around the darkly gleaming rocks.
"There are no sides. Accept your defeat with honour." He takes a swig of butterbeer.
"You left because...?" Hermione prompts after a long minute.
“Are you alright?” Theo asked Draco one morning over breakfast.
"You're far too knowledgeable about me, Potter."
could refer to Malfoy feeling resentful of the way his family naturally led him to the Dark Arts, or the way Voldemort forced his hand, or it could have nothing to do with the war at all. Maybe it's his marriage, Harry thinks critically. Maybe Astoria wanted a divorce and Malfoy didn't, but either way he'd end up having to concede. It would explain the absence of Malfoy's wedding ring.
Level five.
"Oh, Harry, you didn't say you got your licence! Congratulations!" Hermione looks genuinely delighted. "Wonderful news. Let's have a toast to Muggle transport, shall we?"
He almost smiled but the Shadow stayed. He sat, silent and alone, and not a sound could be heard except for the clink-clink-clink of a spoon against a bowl.
"Nervous about the test, eh?" Matthew says, pulling into the centre car-park.
"It's all right."
“He’s been trapped in time for three years?” Astoria says, staring at Narcissa.
He’s finally lost.
"You think he's in Helston?"
Ron doesn't say anything for a long moment. Then he says quietly, "Are you sure?"
He takes off his shoes and lets the waves wash over his feet. Further out, the waves curl until they crest and crash, rushing inland until nothing more than a rippled tide reaches Harry.
Narcissa looks quite formidable, Harry thinks when he opens the door. Dressed in heavy and formal robes, a string of pearls about her neck and her hair elaborately styled. She looks at Harry with a look of undisguised anxiety, however.
Harry knocks on the guest bedroom door at some point in the afternoon, thinking Draco might want a cup of tea. However, there's no response. He runs a few errands, Disapparating to Gringott's, and returns to the apartment at five o'clock.
Maybe Harry’s just drawn to it because it’s something he’d wear himself, something he’d choose.
* * *
to make sense,” Harry says, pacing in front of the fire. “Hermione, how do we fix this?”
Astoria's eyes flicker to his, and Harry's startled by her expression. Surprise, he thinks, and...caution? Perhaps even a tinge of suspicion...
If he died alone in the cold and unforgiving tide of the Celtic Sea, the worst part is that Harry hadn't even noticed for three years.
“Draco couldn’t,” Harry says suddenly. It all makes so much sense in hindsight. “He’d try, but – “
Would he still be welcome at her house if she knew Draco had actually returned five days ago and Harry had kept it secret? Guilt blossoms in his heart as he sets the letter aside.
"You're becoming a regular visitor. I suppose you'll be wanting a cup of tea then?"
“Alright. They keep following me,” he groaned, but Harry thought he detected a note of delight in his voice. Several beady eyes appeared in the crack between the doorframe and the door. Neville shut it pointedly and they heard soft sighs from the other side.
Draco is standing beside it, the faint glow of the light dancing over his face like clouds drifting across the sky. Behind him, through the windows, Harry can see the London night illuminated. There's the lines of trains, moving slowly from station to station. High above, the crescent moon is struggling through the misty winter night.
"Used my impressive Auror skills, of course." Ron leans back in his seat. "Better get your résumé organised, the applications close tomorrow."
Harry stands up suddenly and reaches for the Renault keycard as if it's a liferaft.
“It’s all right,” Harry says quickly. “Narcissa, if you know anything about this, you need to tell me right now. I think Draco’s used a time-turner and something’s gone terribly wrong.”
Harry frowns. "You think there's something left there?"
He really doesn't feel like company tonight, but he promised Ron and Hermione. Harry removes his work robes and hangs them up, then stares blankly at his wardrobe for a long time before closing the door. He's gotten used to not wearing robes, especially during the last three weeks. He'd bought jeans and t-shirts during the impromptu road trip; Draco had purchased far more formal clothes and kept them neatly pressed regardless of what godforsaken time of the night they were driving. The observation had made Harry smile at the time.
"From — from
when he found out about it.”
"What were you thinking?" Ron adds. "Mum's going to completely lose it! She's already knitted matching Christmas jumpers!"
He lifts Draco's hand, bringing his wrist higher, and kisses the soft skin just beneath the inky tail of the Dark Mark.
"You've changed a lot," Harry says.
Harry was at breakfast the next day. He sat at the Slytherin table and Draco went to sit at the Ravenclaw table when Harry called out his name. Draco returned, sitting this time not across from Harry but next to him.
She bids him farewell politely enough, however, and he leaves.
He watches the memory again. Eleven times in total, and it's going nowhere. This is the hardest part of solving cases, Harry thinks. Getting started. Looking for something, but nobody knows what it is. It's like trying to find a book without knowing the title or author.
"If you want to protect your family, Father, I suggest investing in a time-turner and reconsidering some key choices you made twelve years ago."
friends — "
Draco looks at Harry, then glances down at their linked hands.
about what you were about to say?"
“They used it to send a message, then,” Draco said. “They were strong and healthy and clearheaded, but they knew — thought — that they would not win. They cast it while they were still able to.” In his mind, he saw it. The empty room, the dark fight. The fox racing away — someone running back with it to help, too late — too late! In the room, the fight was quickly over, the person dying or dead, their victor gone — their friend or family member unable to assist except by comforting them in their final seconds or carrying their bloodied body away.
"I've visited at a bad time, haven't I?"
"Definitely not. The team needs someone reliable, I heard them saying." Ron catches Hermione's expression. "What? Just telling the truth."
Of course it is.
Harry spends the morning walking along the coastal track. It's not the same, he thinks. He liked it better during his earlier visits. When the winter winds howled through the crumbling cliff edges, when the waves lashed across craggy rocks, when the sea sung a fierce song to a crescent moon.
“Alright,” he said heavily. “I miss Fred every day but…George will always miss him more, I think. It’s like he’s missing part of himself, too, part of his mind, like he’s forgotten who he is.”
Astoria pauses. "You think Draco was unhappy with his life?"
* * *
It's a Saturday. Summer is still hanging in the air like a familiar friend, reluctant to leave. Harry stands on the balcony and looks up at the azuline sky.
He watches the memory with Narcissa again, looking for the most insignificant detail. The way Malfoy pauses before speaking, the way he stares at the family portrait in the same way Harry stares at photographs of his parents and thinks it's the closest he'll ever get to them.
Harry stares at him, all amusement forgotten. "But — you could only see me when I was in your memories, or going through your possessions..."
All this time, and it was right here. Right in front of him.
"They're great big bloody fire-breathers, how do you hide that from Muggles for thousands of years?" he demands as Harry leans back in the comfortable armchair.
"They argued," she says at last. "Draco always adored his father, and used to listen to every word. I think it was very difficult for Lucius, to have Draco suddenly withdraw. I think Lucius expected everything to be the same after the war...but after the battle, Draco wouldn't talk to us. There was just so much distance, and it felt like Draco was so close to just leaving completely...Lucius took it badly. He told Draco to pull himself together. I'm afraid he became quite angry with Draco. But the angrier he became, the more Draco retreated..."
“Well, there’s a lot of complicated magic involved, but — it’s somewhere for you to start, yes,” Hermione says. “Find the time-turner, and we’ll do some research.”
He walks slowly up the meandering path to Astoria's door. He'd received an owl around lunchtime, just after he finished reviewing the file notes again. The letter had requested he visit and Harry had jumped at the chance to acquire something new, wasting no time in Disapparating to Astoria's home.
"I don't know, Harry," Ron says at last. "Sounds like...well, sounds like a ghost."
"I don't sulk. I reflect on my life," Draco says loftily.
Draco’s mother had a phrase for it. Fate’s Shadow, she called it. When it comes, she said — when you feel it in the air — stay in bed. Huddle down beneath warm covers, don’t go out until you feel it pass over you.
"You have the same expression as Draco did, every time he looked at that terrible waste of money," Narcissa observes.
"Call St Mungo's," he says wearily. "I'll owl Narcissa and Astoria."
"Well, they notified his mother this morning." Ron gives a sympathetic shrug. "You're not family or even a friend, you're just the case manager."
"There yet?" he murmurs, voice thick with sleep.
Harry seizes upon the excuse with great relief. "Tired. Yes. Suppose I should get some rest."
Harry studies Draco. He should have realised. Those first few conversations with Draco, he seemed somehow far too placid, far too accepting of Harry's sudden appearance in his life. It makes sense, now, to realise Draco's been there the whole time. Right from the start, perhaps. Watching Harry in the owl emporium, watching him read through the textbooks, the notebook. Watching him as he sat in the Renault Mégane. Harry wonders what Draco was thinking as he watched Harry pull apart his life.
Everything's fine.
When you were a teenager — "
* * *
"No, it's nothing to do with that. I've been assigned the case."
Draco looked at her in disbelief. Very few times had he called on Ron and Hermione, distraught after an argument with Harry. Was there still a shade of school-day dislike in those cool brown eyes, in the impatient hand drumming on the doorframe? Her hand still rested on the doorknob, a determined resistance to any welcome.
"Sir, please move away from the Ministry entrance," Harry says. "Ministry employees have the right to access the building without harassment."
"For you," Harry repeats.
"Maybe I was wrong," Draco says, and Harry looks up with surprise.
The car jerks forward violently and Harry, horrorstruck, slams the brake on and comes to an equally violent stop. Matthew starts laughing.
When Harry was walking out by the lake, Ron nudged him gently.
The driveway gravel crunches beneath the tyres of the car. It reminds Harry of snow, white and crisp and crackling underfoot. He always loved winters. And summers. One or the other, his friends would say, but Harry thinks it's perfectly fine to love two things at once.
* * *
Demons.
"And...?"
* * *
“What’s wrong with — ”
He walks out of the shop. It’s a warm September day. He could go anywhere.
"No."
He watches the trains come and go, and that night he doesn't dream.
He looks up. Draco stands across the room, facing away from Harry, looking out across the London skyline, one hand resting on the cool glass.
He can only look harder.
Now it's Harry's turn to hesitate.
classifieds.
"Would you stop saying I'm having problems? I'm not! Everything is fine! Maybe we don't talk as much as we should — "
"Your latest case is a missing horse, then?" Ginny nods at the boxes Harry had set down beside the front door. "Oh, I meant to tell you — we're playing the Stratford Skylarks on Saturday, there's going to be an International Quidditch scout there!"
Draco's still staring at Harry.
* * *
He sits on the edge of his bed and removes his glasses, listening to the familiar click of the frames as he closes the endpieces. This is a routine he's kept throughout his life, no matter what happened — whether it was falling asleep beneath the stairs at Privet Drive, or his first night at Hogwarts, or finally going to bed after the Battle of Hogwarts after they'd identified all the dead — at the end of the day, he's always removed his glasses and set them safely aside.
Harry pauses to study him. "You don't, you know. Quite surprising, really, but you don't." It's true, he thinks. Strange...in school, Draco always gave off that cold air. But now...sometimes he seems distant, but in a different way. Whether he's gazing silently at lighthouse diagrams or standing patiently in an inn's reception, he seems the sort of person who might not be a good conversationist, but certainly a good listener.
“We’re not married yet.”
Astoria smiles. "I've got another memory for you. I wasn't sure which one to pick, but I think it's the right one." She searches her pockets for a moment, then hands him a vial. "Take care of it."
“I’ll understand,” Draco says after a moment. “It’s easy to leave.”
* * *
Harry watches the train until it disappears from view, going out west, where the lights of the city will give way to dotted suburban streetlights and then, the inky darkness of the countryside.
He owls Narcissa. A date is set. She thinks he's doing a routine visit just to assure her the case is still being actively managed. Wednesday, the fourteenth of January. It's been three weeks now since Harry last saw Draco. Standing in the apartment, looking little more than a fading ghost.
“Everything alright?” Ron said cautiously.
“It is a gun,” his father said. “It is the Muggle Avada Kedavra. It will kill you.” And as if to prove it, he took it off the wall and shot at the head of a nearby sculpture, smashing it into a million pieces. Draco was expecting light, a burst of red, but there had been nothing. Just a loud noise and bits of stone around his feet.
“Breakfast!” Ron declared, leaving no room for argument, and they went down to the Great Hall, Harry and Ron still embroiled in an argument about one of Harry’s moves.
He leaned forward and their lips met.
It doesn't matter. All those dreams became little more than dust and debris, fragments crushed beneath the weight of a war. The weight of black ink on pale skin.
He saw a gun once, in his father's study. The only Muggle artefact his father owned.
"This doesn't make sense. All signs point to a forced disappearance," Harry says, frustrated. "Draco didn't just run away."
bring them to the Burrow and help me and Molly write down names.”
"Yeah," he says, "it's a bit like that."
He was in that kind of mood today, when the day felt bright and new and he thought maybe he could be better.
"Thank you, Potter," Holdsworth says briskly, reaching out and taking it. She puts it neatly to one side of her desk without looking at it. "Is that all?"
Harry laughs.
An impossibly high price, it seems, for six little words.
She stares blankly at him. There’s a glazed look on her face and Harry recognises it instantly. He slowly sets his mug of tea aside and leans forward.
“How’d you figure this all out, anyway?”
“Yes?” Harry asks impatiently. Hermione looks down at the book in her lap.
Harry stares unseeingly at the steam curling gently from the mugs of tea. "Matthew's a Muggle."
"What are you smiling at?"
Nevertheless, he arrives at the manor at the expected time. It's still protected by wards, he finds, and he has to walk up the rather long driveway. He's half-expecting a house-elf or servant to greet him at the door, but it's Narcissa herself.
And it had been five years now. Tonight, Draco had said a new word.

“You must hand homework in on time.”
, until he can’t hear anybody calling his name anymore, until he forgets everything. Until he’s lost. Until he’s gone.
"No, of course not." She hesitates. "Because you're not, are you?"
And he saw it in the dungeons when he came down to Potions early to escape the hissing. Foot-high letters slashed into the walls, the flames burning bright and unmissable.
Now, the land is bright and green, the sea sparkling beneath the light of summer. The abandoned holiday houses are filled once more with sunburned faces and laughing voices. As Harry follows the meandering track, he passes by at least three couples, a young family, and an elderly man with an equally elderly terrier.
fault — ”
“What is it?” Hermione asked more quietly.
* * *
"Why not? He's always running away from things," Ron says, and Harry shakes his head vehemently.
Harry was looking into his cauldron.
self-absorbed!"
Harry held up his own hand.
Then he turns and leaves, stepping out the door and closing it behind him. Harry listens to the quiet snick of the door, followed by fading footsteps.
“Yes.”
There's no response, only silence, but he expected that.
Within moments, he's immersed in the memory.
He appreciates her lack of questions, or perhaps she's too absorbed in her work; she soon retreats to a pile of books in the sitting room and Harry makes his way to Ron's study. The study has a slight chill to it, for the warming charms — concentrated around the busier parts of the house — are less effective here.
,” Draco says indignantly. “
He wonders where they're going. He was supposed to be navigating, but he fell asleep somewhere in Devon and Draco's clearly got a destination in mind. Harry glances at his watch: eight o'clock. Surely they'll stop for the night soon?
"You're not supposed to see me," Draco says at last. "Or hear me."
Malfoy looks in need of a good meal, but Harry had expected the thinness from the file information. He looks a little tired, Harry thinks, noting the faint shadows beneath Malfoy’s eyes. Still, nothing particularly notable; nothing more than Harry would look after a long day at the office. He spoke without his usual arrogance, affecting a politely bland tone, but Harry can’t detect anything else unusual about Malfoy. He watches as the shopkeeper makes his recommendations and Malfoy selects a very ordinary looking barn owl.
“Brilliant, so we’ll just — “
Harry nods. “I mean, imagine if she’d found out afterwards. Ink freshly drying on the birth certificate, and then someone casually lets slip that she’s named her kid in honour of Chudley Cannon’s third-worst captain.”
"He liked that silver snitch clasp. It was a gift from his father, he said."
He arrives right in the middle of an argument. He walks towards the kitchen, where delicious smells and angry voices are coming from.
He always looked so...distant, in the memories. He'd walk through a shop or drive a car or speak to Astoria, but he wasn't really there. Harry recognises something in Draco's face: the angular lines, as if his former self was being chiseled away, or the distant look in his eyes.
"These Muggles," she says, "will not be anywhere near the manor. They will be here. That's why I requested your presence. You can deal with them."
"It's not supposed to be. I have no idea what I'm doing, you have no idea what you're doing either." Harry shrugs. "Doesn't matter."
"This is an early yield," Draco says at last, nodding at the field. "We should come back in August, when most of the spring-sown crops will be harvested." He puts his hands in his pockets and leans back, looking overhead at the cloudless blue sky. "When I was a child, I knew summer was coming to an end when the canola fields turned from bright yellow to dull brown." He smiled faintly, still gazing up into the endless blue. "And the hay meadows would be cut, and overrun with wildflowers. That's when I knew summer was ending."
Reassured by their plans for Dover, Harry lets Draco sleep for the rest of the morning. He spends the time going through the boxes of Draco's possessions — he'd completely forgotten about them, but the box of clothes, for example, will no doubt prove useful. Draco probably has less use for the old textbooks and the calendar diary, but at least they're there. Something familiar.
"Travelled to Birmingham and went to Cadbury World."
Ginny and Astoria look far too amused.
The Healer assistant is right, as much as Harry hates to admit it. Draco is still asleep when he goes into the room, and the assistant returns to tell Harry that Draco will remain asleep for at least the next twelve hours.
He did not move.
Nothing happens.
“I was only kidding, I don’t think they were your fan club,” Ron said.
* * *
He's sitting in the passenger seat and gazing out the window, forehead pressed against the glass. Harry wonders if he's been there the whole time and he studies Draco's face. Is he unhappy that Harry is driving his car? Does he hate seeing someone else in the driver's seat?
Next morning, Harry went to breakfast alone.
“It was like running on air,” Harry says at last.
"Yeah."
You’ll get your chance on Christmas Day, anyway, you and Dad will ramble about Muggle and magical stuff like usual. You’re
* * *
"I like the stars," Harry affirms.
Harry smiles to hide his disbelief, but Astoria seems to catch it anyway and her face tightens. "You don't believe me."
Zeisel gives his badge another considered look, and for a moment he thinks she's about to say something sharp about client confidentiality.
The conversation idly turns to other matters, until eventually it wanders into comfortable silence. Draco settles back in his seat, looking sleepy. Harry drives. On and on and on it goes, he thinks. On and on. It’s a long way home, but distance has never bothered him.
“Malfoy, I think. Ron, don’t put your pumpkin juice on the edge like that.”
Harry frowns and turns to the road atlas, opening it up. Immediately, a plastic rectangular card falls out.
He picks up his wand and whispers a spell, rendering the door transparent only to him, like a one-way mirror.
And maybe, he realises, that's exactly why Draco chose to turn up at Harry's apartment rather than anywhere else.
"The summer storms always felt like coming home."
A few minutes later, when he reaches for the Renault keycard — always kept on the corner of the kitchen counter — he realises it's gone.
"Draco," Harry says quietly, recognising the signs. The abstract way Draco speaks, the way he stares closely at objects.
"Right."
It's a rushed letter from Narcissa. She had been visiting a friend's country estate in the Highlands and has only just returned. The letter is short and consists of little more than a brief reason for her absence and a sentence stating she will be along to St Mungo's directly.
He walks up the narrow path to the front door, ducking beneath a trellis of roses coloured a soft pink, as if summer has faded them, and knocks twice on the door.
* * *
"No," Hermione says. "But it might offer a new perspective." She taps the file. "Would you mind if I accessed the memory?"
Harry stands alone in the apartment for a long moment, then departs too.
He spends the next week going through the old files, re-reading the details of Lucius’s capture and death over and over. There was a Ministry commission into the death, of course, and that required a coroner’s report. A full list of all clothing and items found on Lucius at time of death, and there is nothing listed to suggest a transfigured artefact. Lucius only had his wand and a small bag of Galleons.
Harry stares at Zeisel for a long moment, his thoughts whirling. "Draco knew where his father was. Or was possibly even helping him."
“Talk to him.”
Draco turns away again. "We're here."
The waitress arrives with the spiced mead and a cocktail the colour of a candy-cane. Harry sips at the mead if only to have something to do.
Hermione is very cautious around Astoria and stiffly introduces herself, but Astoria's frankness soon wins Hermione over.
“When we were eleven.”
"I won't do it, I will
"Did you really? That sounds fun, you'll have to take me for a drive sometime."
They reach the car and Harry takes the passenger side, Draco the driver's side. The engine thrums to life, the tyres crunch over the gravel.
“Do you still have the wand you found?”
Harry turns the page, covering the photograph with a blank leaf of parchment. Then, he slowly taps his wand against the blank page.
Draco speaks.
"Why?"
Ron refused to come with him.
Harry opens his mouth, but Hermione beats him to it.
"Past Truro. I wanted to see where the land ended. I drove to Helston and parked at the lighthouse."
Astoria is the first to receive her owl. She arrives at St Mungo's at midday, Sophie clutching her hand, and when she sees Harry sitting in the waiting room she turns a worryingly pale colour.
“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione says firmly. “I am
"Legilimency isn't as simple as that, Harry. It depends on the caster — every Legilimens has a different approach, a different style."
He looks up. It's a half-moon tonight. The same lunar phase as when he first dreamed of the Cornish coast.
"Then you can reflect on the poor decisions you've made throughout your life."
The man offers the statement without raising his eyes from the skeleton. Harry shifts restlessly under the high sun. It’s too hot, he thinks, especially this late in the summer. His robes hang off him, heavy and damp with perspiration, unmoved by the slight breeze. The other man — small and bespectacled, with a neatly cropped salt-and-pepper beard — gives no indication of being affected by the heat. He wears the ivory-coloured robes of the post-mortem division and somehow, the pale colour gives the illusion of coolness and shade.
"It's not about reading minds! Honestly, both of you should really know better. Especially
* * *
“Absolutely,” Harry says smugly, fetching a serving spoon.
But Draco just exhales sharply, pushing the air between his teeth, and — without taking his gaze off the road ahead — says, "It was."
Harry didn’t seem scared of anything though. He was Harry. Draco could not imagine him crying or sobbing into a little mess or curling up in a ball or holding a wand to his head and screaming that he was going to end it all. He was just Harry. He played Quidditch very well and handed in all his essays on time and had two best friends and was nice to people, even the really rude ones. Draco wanted to be like that. He wanted to smile at people or hand in his essays and have teachers smile at him or just get out of his stupid little mind. Sometimes it felt like he was suffocating sometimes. Like he was walking underwater, going nowhere, frozen in an Impedimenta curse. Moving towards something that he could never reach or at least could not reach in time.
"Nothing much, really. You're quite boring. Stand around staring into space a lot."
“I won’t feel guilty, no. Come on Ron, you can eat much faster than that. I’ve seen you.”
"There's only ever been three recorded cases. I know one of them mentioned fatigue, but...I'm not a Healer. I don't know." She exchanges another look with Ron, and Ron speaks quietly.
The apartment is cold. Now that September is truly underway, the last of the summer warmth is quickly dissipating. Harry unlocks the door and pauses before he steps into the apartment. White walls, floorboards, empty counters. A room stripped bare. There's nothing here. With a pang of sadness, Harry remembers the trailing roses of Astoria's garden, the smell of sugary pastries baking in the oven, the crackling music of the Wizarding Wireless. It's been a while since he visited Astoria and Matthew.
tired.
"Oh, we just finished the last of the tests," the assistant says cheerfully. "Minchin the Marvellous reported similar effects after he was time-splinched — it's certainly very interesting, isn't it? The senior Healer says he might run some more tests tomorrow, actually, because this is a very good opportunity to write a paper on..." The assistant trails off.
"Total madness," Harry agrees. "We used to hold competitions to see who ended up the most sleep deprived, remember? Atkinson still holds the record, I think — four days straight on the job."
“The Hippodrome, can’t forget that. I’m actually quite excited about it.”
Draco starts laughing; Ron points an accusing finger at him.
“It happens every night,” she said coldly. “It needs to stop. He has to face the truth sometimes.”
No; he came to Harry.
he had said and Draco wanted to laugh and tell him that where he was sitting, the Dark Lord once sat. The Dark Lord had sat there and all sorts of insidious curses and words had snaked from his mouth, like poison…and the Minister sat in that very chair now, smiling and saying “No milk, please.” Draco had the feeling he could have gone a bit mad but Narcissa had sold the manor and its memories before Draco could edge over that line.
Astoria takes pity on him. "I understand. We all make certain assumptions, don't we?"
Like the old Draco Malfoy. He's wearing well-tailored clothes and a set of neat black robes. His hair is neatly combed, his cloak pinned with a small gold owl. All that's missing is the air of faint contempt.
"Ah, yes," Mr Weasley says, "He'll be wanting an update about the Welsh dragon incident." He stands up and looks apologetically to Harry. "Sorry to dash off. Say hullo to Ginny for me, won't you? Molly misses her something dreadful."
"I shouldn't have left," Draco says.
to me or Ron if you need to."
"Well, every family has little arguments at Christmas," Hermione says with determination, upending a small bag of sweets and pastry treats. "No reason why we can't enjoy the festivities still."
The licence doesn't hold much new information for Harry. It has Draco's name, birthdate, address. The licence was granted on the twentieth of June 2002, and expires in 2012.
He leaves the manor soon after, retracing the same route. The vial is heavy in his pocket, and it's a long drive back to Ron and Hermione's house. Hermione answers the door, a mug of tea in one hand.
All in all, brief notes. He turns the page.
you,” Matthew says with not a trace of repentance. “I
And he's not sure what he'd been expecting, but this isn't it.
Draco steps inside then, and Harry closes the door.
Harry says nothing. Draco seems to be a little slower than usual, as if he's still exhausted from the journey yesterday. They shouldn't have gone, Harry thinks.
“Nott?”
Draco tries to engage Harry in conversation a few more times, then gives up and disappears again to find lunch. He returns three hours later with a new book.
"No."
It doesn't matter, Harry thinks.
Narcissa turns away from him. "You have no right to ask these questions," she says in a low voice, but Harry can hear the tremor beneath her words and knows he's struck a nerve. "I did my best for Draco."
And it seemed his heart obeyed too, pausing in time, his lungs refusing breath.
“You’re here,” Harry says quietly.
a ghost, because he's
* * *
"Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll try to be more predictable," Harry teases, refusing to be drawn into an argument. This is what happened last time, he reminds himself. Both of them taking everything far too seriously and getting defensive over nothing. "Let me guess, now's the part where I storm off and you sulk for hours?"
"I heard you."
And later, of course, he'd place his wand beside the glasses. During the war, when he was hunting Horcruxes, he began sleeping with his wand beneath his pillow. Hermione wasn't fond of it — she said too many wizards did some serious accidental spell damage that way — but Harry wasn't willing to risk a night-time attack and a missing wand.
"Oh, he promised Molly he'd help clear out the broomshed, so — oh! That's another reason I'm here! Ginny mentioned she'd forgotten to grab her old Quidditch stuff and I said I could pick it up for her." Hermione's set her mug on the counter and is heading towards the spare room before Harry can utter a single response.
