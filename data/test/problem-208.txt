And again, he remembered Draco Malfoy actually didn't enter class for the whole day. There was no blond hair to be found in every hallway and classroom. Harry stopped for a moment, getting greeted by the Fat Lady who had her nighttime visit to the other portraits and walked away again.
Harry sighed, not truly opposed to Draco's claim. It was true, he liked Luna but not to the certain aspect of love yet. "And what does my feelings have to do with our row, pray tell?"
"Why?" was the word that came out of Malfoy's mouth after a few seconds of consideration, voice soft and full of questions he couldn't summarize in one word. "Why now, Potter?"
The Gryffindor's cheeks heated up at Malfoy's choice of words, shoving Baneberry on to the top part of the shelf and rubbed his neck where Malfoy had contact with. "I would
Harry clicked his tongue before he released Draco. Instead of letting Draco go, he trapped him between the wall, his hands on Draco's side, and for that reason, the Slytherin's cheeks created a very vibrant shade of pink. Harry wasn't sure if it was out of anger or embarrassment, and in Malfoy's case, it seemed that either was the answer. They both stared at each other with so little space to breathe, so little movements to create, a jet of thunder connecting them as their eyes darkened together.
Harry shook his head, snorting. He didn't know what amused him more: Malfoy's stand about the Gryffindors or him and Harry talking like they were
The rumors were already spreading when I got to the Hall," said Harry. He did tell the truth to some of the curious younger students, but none of them believed him. They would only stare at him, as if he was an amusing show animal and walk away.
Before he could retort, pummel Malfoy and plan of throwing him off the Astronomy Tower, Draco already vanished behind the wardrobe. With Harry still gaping and eyes wide, he followed Draco inside and shut the door furiously, darkness enveloping him. The voices from the circle had muffled, and the dim light got dimmer inside the wardrobe, the air was limited and he could clearly feel Draco’s breath behind him, warm and tense and infuriating. Harry turned around, groaned and pushed Malfoy to the other side of the wardrobe, leaving a thud.
Without warning, the surrounding swirled for a second before it settled shifting to a nice warm, wooden room, like a cottage someone would find on a country side. The lighting changed as well, turning the dizzying disco lighting to a nice dim fire flicking kind of lighting found in campsites.
Harry had urges to ask some Slytherins where could he be, where Malfoy had gone onto plunging on some danger, but that would look like he was concerned of Malfoy's being, so he didn't. Clenching his fist, he strode out of his finished class (History of Magic, which made him nod off and have an urge to create a slumber party with all the houses from Professor Binn's teaching) and looked around.
“Look, Malfoy,” Harry said when they arrived in front of the wardrobe. “I didn’t know what was Abbot's motive, but I’m just going to remind you that I don’t
"Wow," Seamus said, scanning Harry head to toe, opposite his seat. Harry looked at him with intent. "Don't you look... too cozy and formal mate?"
"Malfoy? Wake up," Harry said, softly tapping the boy's cheek, hoping to get a small response, at least, to know he's still alive. "Madam Pomfrey said you need to drink this."
agitating. And for the record, he doesn't have any blackmailing spirit in him to antagonize Draco in such a way. Sighing again, he grabbed his wand from his pocket and casted for his red-coloured curtains to cover his four-poster, followed by a Silencing Charm to make sure no one would suspect there were several people entangled on Harry Potter's bed. He saw Malfoy gasp and grabbed a handful of Harry's hair, pulling it upward. He had his murderous eyes on again. Harry shrieked inwardly.
. Harry didn't hesitate anymore and sat up, revealing his glazed eyes and tipping forward to embrace Malfoy, who was offering the space between his arms. Harry gently placed his head on the comfort of his chest and then he started sobbing.
. He never once saw Draco's good side, and if he had one at all. If he would think about it, he didn't want to hate Malfoy, if only the blond was a lot less like a prick in their first year, he would've tolerated Malfoy at some point in his life and become friends with him.
He stopped walking, and now looked at the two Slytherins poking holes behind his head. Should he ask at least one of them? Would they be honest in answering his questions?
"Hagrid, this is some fine baking," Draco said, practically mauling at the pound cake as he licked his chocolate-covered fingers. "It's better than my Grandmother Druella's recipe! I'll be honest that I prefer this."
. She needed her son's company more than ever. Malfoy, being family-oriented that he was, would obviously choose his mother over anything.
"Yes, actually, I want to say something," Harry started, breathing evenly for the first time since he entered the room. "I was suddenly ignored and avoided after those two weeks we were friends. I needed an explanation."
Harry sat on an empty bed beside where Draco laid and watched Madam Pomfrey do her healing. He was tensed the whole time, and he wanted to hear what Madam Pomfrey had to say about Malfoy's condition. He wasn't sure about that one since this was a very serious injury, their headmaster was the first one to hear of what happened to Malfoy.
"Go to the Hall, Harry. We'll be waiting for you here," Hermione drew without breaking eye contact with the book. "And
Pansy chuckled and Harry blushed, realizing what his question indirectly implied. "Well, yes, considering I snogged with him more than ten times in every overlooked corner of this castle especially in fifth year, I managed to make him bothered the first time he saw me naked. We didn't do that anymore since he regretted what we did, saying he wasn't allowed to be with a Parkinson because he had a reserved arrangement with the Greengrass family. And it wouldn't work anyway because he never liked me the way I did. I have Blaise now and I'm at the peak of my happiness because he loves me very much." She smiled with a spark Harry was suddenly envious of. He never experienced smiling that contently and peaceful before about love.
Draco groaned. "Merlin!" Draco walked forward and stole Harry's spoon. He scooched over to Harry's side and was now the one to prod the spoon to Harry's mouth, urging Harry to open his mouth. Malfoy was surprisingly gentle in doing so, and Harry remained still on his place, opening his mouth willingly when Malfoy shoves another spoonful of food.
"Your mum and dad acted stupidly heroic for you and got themselves killed. It's truly a wonder how you survived, how was that possible, you ask. Based on how your life is going now, I think all their efforts of letting you live were utterly wasted."
"You pansy, Potter!" Malfoy spluttered. He wouldn't be able to stand up when Harry was entangled with him. "The day couldn't get any worse, could it?"
"God, don't make me feel you're there and alive!" Malfoy said again, and this time, he stilled as perfectly as possible. Harry never imagined he would be in a situation like this. Not even a girl dared to roll her hips on top of him. Not that he didn't appreciate kinks and lewd behaviors but, he didn't expect a
Harry wiggled uncomfortably, face flushed. Apparently, Malfoy was observant. Harry lunged forward but only his glasses tipped, now it was slipping off his nose with his body still pinned on the wall. Malfoy smiled one last time before he slid his hand in his own robe pocket, revealing what seemed to be a green apple and showed it in front of Harry, trembling and would've slid down to the ground if Malfoy wasn't holding him in place.
Harry only nodded and did what was told, first rolling the hem of his pyjama bottoms up his shin and sleeves up his elbows to start working.
"I didn't expect you'd actually come," Harry said, sitting comfortably on his seat. "There once was a boy who asked me to have a duel with him in first year. I risked getting out of the Gryffindor tower such a late night, only to find none of the person who asked me
"Please, answer me. Did – did you?" Harry said and kept panting, then lowered his chin to catch his breath properly, still had a handful of Malfoy's front robe.
Potter?" Malfoy was smirking, his voice rugged right on the ridge of Harry's ear that must've been his attempt to sound arrogant.
theories back to their Common Room. It was all going well, when his stomach grumbled again, louder than the first sound it made from the library.
Harry sighed. He wasn't bored at all, but disconcerted that this was Malfoy he's tending to and placed the damp towel on Draco's forehead. After, he pressed the underside of his palm on the boy's neck to check his temperature, and was satisfied when he figured that Draco was less warm. That should do it, at least. The potion seemed to have taken effect already, making Malfoy more relaxed and coloured. Those were good signs.
Malfoy turned his head away. "Get back to working please, and wear some protective charm. I don't want my grades to be badly-affected by you, so cooperate."
and rough, encircling his hands on the Gryffindor's waist and gripped on it tightly. He could feel Malfoy's ring almost poking his lower back, sinking on to his skin with a cold feeling.
Ron looked at Harry, Adam's apple bobbing. And Harry understood well why he was nervous from the activity. Hermione who was in front of their table, turned around to peer at Ron. Harry was surprised Hermione didn't scold him and instead said, "I said check up on Harry, Ron.
Harry parted his lips to be able to breathe properly (which wasn't effective because he couldn't feel his lungs moving), letting Malfoy sooth his lips with a tentative, hot thumb. His lips felt dry so Harry unconsciously brushed his tongue on it that caught Malfoy's finger accidentally along. Harry shot him an apologetic glance but Malfoy remained having his half-lidded eyes.
He whimpered as Malfoy started licking his ear, nibbling on it after as if soothing the ache he brought to the reddened area. He heard Malfoy let out a sound of a small laugh, resting a sly grin on Harry's cheek.
“Sorry to burst your bubbles, Harry but I dared Draco to make out with you in a wardrobe until I say stop.”
Despite the content Harry feel for his best friends and his silly imagination, however, he was also feeling nervous as a codfish about to be hooked. He blatantly asked
"O' course lad! Em already rich ye know! Being here at Hogwarts is more worth it than any money. Yer smile was enough of a payment."
Ron chose truth, not in any way liking the idea of being dared by a Malfoy. Draco asked, “Have you, Weasley, ever made out with a bloke?"
It has been exactly three days since Harry lost himself further to his sulking. After classes, he would ignore all the greetings he was used to having to sit and eat a small portion of his bacon and sausage, all too little for Ron and Hermione's approval. Bacon and sausage used to be on his lists of favorites before, but now he couldn't make himself care for the simplest things such as taking care of his eating habits, or add new foods to his list where his tongue tingled for attention. Not just that, but he was also doing his best to avoid all the possible routes in the castle where there held a possibility he would meet
"Join me." Malfoy pursed his lips and did some sort of nervous gesture with his right foot, one violently tapping the ground. "I think it's better to have company while eating."
It was understandable. Ron has his own grades to worry about. Harry felt like a bother rather than important. "I'm just not in the mood," said Harry.
" said Blaise and Harry could feel the same disgust starting to linger in his veins, a tinge of red appearing on his cheeks. Malfoy
With no choice, Harry forced himself to blend in with the hyped circle, crossing his arms sulkily with tucked legs. Deciding there was no better to do, his eyes roamed around the circle and counted the people he knew mentally. Ron and Hermione flunked him and he saw some of their housemates scattered around: Neville Longbottom, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnegan and Collin Creevey. He also recognized some Hufflepuffs: Ernie McMillan, Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot. He barely recognized all the Ravenclaws except Luna Lovegood. Then the Slytherins: Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle and –
"I can't," Harry yelped, "you're too heavy, I barely got my strength back, and could you... stop rolling your hips?" Harry mewled helplessly. Malfoy looked confused at Harry's remark, eyebrows furrowed. Well, he couldn't phrase it in a way it wouldn't sound weird.
The boy nodded and ran away to go do what he was told. As for Harry, he braced himself for what was about to come, breathing in and entered the eerie and dark bathroom. He raised his wand, gathering and remebering all the spells he could use just in case for defense, eyes hyperaware and ready for potential intruders.
in Potions as his final grade for the first term. If he kept this up that is, dozing off in such breath-constricting class, Snape could really give him that kind of grade since he looked eager to give Harry such a mark. Silently, he watched Snape write the ingredients for today's potion-making at the board in his very small and cursive handwriting, shortly announcing after that Ron was his partner for the activity after several callings later.
Harry was out of it, he knew, holding his essential things for writing, letting the ink from the tip of his quill drop to leave blotches on the self-cleaning paper Professor Snape had lent them just minutes ago. They were given at least ten minutes to finish a quick reflection regarding the
Draco was still staring, no, looking down on him. Like the avoidant boy Harry was, he glared at Draco before turning his head back to listen to Parkinson who was shushing everyone to silence.
"You two are known role models of this school, Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy!" Professor McGonagall loomed over them, voice still trembling from shock. "A Quidditch Captain and a Slytherin Prefect fighting like children? I should’ve taken more points beyond thirty!"
He listened to his best friends bicker in a hushed, hurried, angry tone, and so was Bulstrode who was Hermione's seatmate, silently steaming, forced to listen beside her and giving dirty glances to Harry. Distracted by something else, Harry's mind decided to float somewhere. This was usually the time he would think of the nights where he would have visions of killing someone in his dream, which was beyond gore and too filthy to be called a nightmare. The ones he had felt too real that he could barely greet his mates a good morning, because it wasn't.
"You better be not thinking Malfoy!" said Ron. "Pointy git's been nothing but trouble to you lately. He wouldn't be able to Hex you now – 'cause,
He walked across Hogwarts briskly all the way to the Stone Bridge, ignoring the pain of walking with his pointy, pinching and old school shoes that binded his feet in agony, wand firmly grasped by his hand.
"We're not here to do anything complicated, Potter. We are only going to arrange potion ingredients by their strength order and not alphabetically. It's our job to collect all the ingredients around the room. Some first years hadn't had proper control with their wands yesterday and it had direly caused damage to Professor Snape's classroom."
After they finished reading, they left the library and started chatting on their way to the Transfiguration classroom. Harry was glad they insisted for him to continue talking about Malfoy's incident, the three of them making theories as to why he was on the floor in a pool of his own blood. Ron said the knife that stabbed Malfoy wasn't a form of self-harm ("I think the knife is bewitched. Knowing Malfoy having too many enemies, anyone would want to kill him!") while Hermione differed from Ron's theory, similar as to what Harry thought of originally: an attempt of suicide. She said she had seen Malfoy herself go alone in Myrtle's Bathroom several times in a foul mood, blasting the door open and barely noticing her passing by, witnessing his dilemma.
Potter, you hate me and I hate you." Draco held his forehead and chanted to himself about being in a coma or fever dream. Harry took a moment to stand up and pinch Malfoy's leg. Predictably, Malfoy yelped.
"I did say don't roll your hips." Harry scowled at him. "And everyone would get hard with that type of movement on top of your cock."
It wasn't how Harry expected the event would turn out, how relaxed Malfoy now inside the hut despite its narrow space he was worried of earlier. As what Harry expected, Hagrid talked about how annoyed he was with Malfoy at first year for being a pompous git and tried avoiding talking about his father. They then shared a laugh about an embarassing story of Harry's unfortunate trouser with a galleon embedded on it stolen by a ruddy Niffler under Harry's bed in fifth year and left it with a hole, galleon gone, with the trouser in front of Filch's office that made him deranged for days of how disrespectful students could get nowadays. Harry had to hide his whole face as Draco and Hagrid shared uncannily similar laughs, almost destroying his eardrums. Lastly, Hagrid said a fair few thoughts of how good Draco was with Potions just as Harry was with Defense. Malfoy was already full of pound cakes and Harry, not at all full, was frowning as they left Hagrid's hut with pound cakes in their pockets.
Without knocking, he opened the cupboard and found Draco Malfoy sitting primly on one of the disposed benches from the Pitch, still in his robe like Harry. His hair wasn't gelled, surprisingly, and had his blond hair all over his forehead which was a rare sight.
Malfoy, on the verge of dashing off, carefully plucked a handful of pound cake and bit on it. Harry closed his eyes for a moment, hoping to hear Malfoy's teeth clunk unpleasantly. Instead of hearing just that, there was a hum of content from Malfoy and Harry's eyes flickered open, scandalized.
After a few seconds of walking to the Hospital Wing, Harry's mind blanked, not able to move from where he was standing. His surrounding was blurring, followed by an unpleasant ring in his ears. Harry staggered and dropped down to his knees.
that it gave me sore eyes. I deduced you came here without letting food touch your lips. Suspecting your look and your wide eyebags, you lack sleep and food for days." He scanned Harry up and down, lingering at Harry's face the longest. "Then somehow at our duel, your pride kicked in and forgot you were weakened. Now you swagger here, using the remnants of your energy, then you just
Harry's laugh settled down, half-shaking to compose himself, settling at the idea of not to annoy Malfoy further. "Mind you, we are not evil-minded snakes. Also, is your shin fine now?"
He had put his wand back his pocket and entered the stall. He hunkered down, plucked Draco's wrist to check if his pulse was still beating, and when he felt beats, slow beats, he Vanished the water off Malfoy's position and laid him down carefully on the floor, elevating his legs and spelling it to stay up for a while, exactly what was taught to him back in his school days in Grogory's Primary School, as far as his memory was capable. Harry was very careful not to touch the knife. The smell of blood was overwhelming, hurting Harry's nose, but that didn't matter at all, as long as Malfoy was collected off the floor without dripping more blood off his body. Conjuring a glove, he wore it and applied pressure around the bleeding area to control the flow, then did nothing else more but to wait patiently for Madam Pomfrey's arrival.
Harry moved before his brain processed what was said. Draco followed right after, shutting the door behind them.
S-sorry I haven't cleaned up," Hagrid greeted, a little anxious of Malfoy but observably grateful. Malfoy's face was still contorted, not calming down but was convinced - forced rather (by Harry) to go inside. Harry gripped Malfoy's hand tighter, a fair warning to Malfoy not to insult Hagrid's fondness for dangerous creatures, the barn-like smell of his hut and the grease-bathed face of Hagrid's from work since Malfoy was known to never holding back an affront. Malfoy gasped in pain before Harry had let go, sulking on the dusty sofa he propped on whilst Harry sat beside him, saying his usual greetings to Hagrid ("Hagrid, great to be here. The usual tea for me"). Malfoy did the same, but a hesitant one, almost drawling but Hagrid was too happy to spot it. ("Hello, Hagrid. Fancy being here. Er - milk on my tea, no sugar"). The half-giant then prepared dessert for them, busy at his kitchen counter and in a good mood for having guests.
"The next time I'll apologize, I would... probably mean it. I would like you to spend time with me so, please."
When he heard no response from the blond, he was too quick to fill in the silence. “I… know, I was wrong to assume your stab was self-inflicted too."
Harry was supposed to be irritated by the statement but instead, he chuckled, not loud enough to startle Madam Pince busy checking labels in her place. Malfoy blinked at him slowly before he gathered himself and hissed.
Professor McGonagall looked at them for an intense second, like the cat-like focus she had before she scribbled something on a piece of parchment, handing it to Malfoy after. Harry raised his chin to peer at it, reading:
If it's not for your doe-like eyes I really wouldn't help your arse," Pansy said . "Draco's a nut-job-type of complicated, Harry. He's like a riddle you could never solve unless you read all the things people had overlooked in all of the books they've read to find him out. He's
"M-Malfoy. Your stab last week." Harry gulped a large amount of saliva. "Did you – do that to yourself?"
Harry's stomach grumbled again, and this time, he slumped down the couch from dizziness. He held his forehead to make sure his vision wouldn't have dancing stars in it. It felt like forever but Malfoy remained on his seat, staring at him rub his temple.
Malfoy's brow furrowed, his heavy-lidded eyes slowly opening. Draco looked vulnerable and weak like this, as if he was about to cry and sob his heart out. Harry never thought Draco would show such face since his whole bloodline seemed to despise that particular action as a reaction from things.
Harry didn’t expect for Malfoy to do that but his heart fluttered by it, and kissed Malfoy on the lips again, gradually losing his breath, his drunken head couldn’t think of anything but to continue kissing Malfoy until he was satisfied, until Malfoy was satisfied, harder, deeper and longer than the swift three-second kiss they shared days ago. When their mouth finally separated, Harry pushed him off and wiped his mouth with the back of his mouth. Draco's mouth tasted like champagne, and he couldn't remove it inside his mouth.
“No,” Harry insisted, remembering the quick reminders he was supposed to remember from the very start. “Leave it. We were reminded not to close the door this afternoon but we both forgot about it. Sleep it out and we’ll get out of here alive by tomorrow.”
Harry still had his eyes anywhere except Malfoy, focused on the goal of reaching the Great Hall for dinner. He wasn't keen to know whether what Malfoy said indicated he enjoyed their day together or their last moment where they stared at each other.
Basing on the cuts, Draco must've tried removing the permanent tattoo over and over again. It was all swelling and extremely scarred, little brown keloids and blotches of red patches are surrounding it already, and it looked horribly painful. Harry held Draco's hand firmly, sighing.
"Malfoy," Harry croaked, "Professor Snape requires you. He told me to bring you with me." Harry looked at his shoes fondly, and he wished he could for the whole day because this is
Harry groaned, apparently gaining his strength back when he realized he ate three plump and juicy apples in total, or was that Malfoy's saliv -.
Harry coughed to clear his throat and walked out from the Hall again. He didn't look back but he made his movements swift, not daring to peer past his shoulder to look at what reaction Malfoy made. His heart was pounding for no reason, and arriving at the dim depression-covered classroom of Snape's made his feeling worse. Snape was seated on the teacher's desk with his arms crossed, his movements telling Harry to not let his curiosity get the best of him and decide to touch all the ornaments and recipes scattered around the barely maintained and dusted classroom that smelled like spicy muggle condiments.
"Really?" Ron snorted. "That swamp of a pool? Mate, you didn't get infection or something, did you?"
Malfoy, he walked straight to the Hall. The place still had surprisingly decent amount of students, not full but remarkably more than expected, knowing the danger the students may experience under the induced fear that Voldemort and his Death Eaters brought to the whole Wizarding World. He might miss Ron and Hermione during his break but won't dwell on it. He would, as always, manage to find some happiness around the castle, break a dozen school rules (under his dad's cloak) and do good deeds after like the old times.
Harry's ears turned horribly red after he heard that and shoved mashed potatoes in his mouth without breathing. That was the most disgusting thing he heard since the spreading of rumors he and Dumbledore were fucking in secret so that he could win the whole Gryffindor the House Cup every year - and Malfoy being behind all of the damn rumor that led them both to detention with Mcgonagall for disrespecting Dumbledore.
"Did you really think I will fucking apologize, Scarhead? I'd choose everything over apologizing because I, Merlin be damned, hate you, Potter," Draco said, plucking Harry's wand off the floor and spelled the door open. After he was done, he threw the wand back along with Harry's cloak on the floor and closed the door, leaving a trail of air and a loud banging sound, leaving Harry dumbfounded.
Draco might learn to develop a soft spot for you," Pansy encouraged and Harry gave her a hesitant nod. There was something sneaky about her stare that he didn't dare ask, because she seemed willing enough to talk nonstop if she was asked.
The window behind Malfoy was covered with a dusty curtain, but there was a floating lightbulb on the ceiling, which meant Malfoy could've bewitched it to light up and float. Harry nodded curtly and closed the door behind him, sitting on the dustiest couch Harry had ever seen in his life opposite to Malfoy. He felt dizzy and feverish for a second, but he ignored it. It must've been his hunger.
." Draco attempted to find another way to help himself off Harry, but ended up rolling his hips again. "I c-can't get a moment to get off you! And my shin - "
After a few minutes, the blond was all cleaned up from his own blood, tended and all better. Madam Pomfrey then turned to Harry and showed him a small phial, outstretching her arm.
about my father that way, Potter. You know nothing of his disposition, everything you hear or see is not always the truth. He's not what you think he is."
. Malfoy smelled like damn apples. Harry was starting to sweat, and it was the softness of Malfoy's thin, girly lips that made him throw rationality out of his mind. He was bloody kissing Malfoy,
The Room of Requirement, as what it was called it by everyone who knew it existed, was filled with hyper teenagers drinking and dancing all over, which, for surely, Professor McGonagall would find horrendous. It was eight o'clock in the evening. Everyone still had their grooves on, paired Ravenclaws and Slytherins dancing together without caring, some Gryffindors at the corner snogging senselessly.
"Madness," Malfoy said raspily and Harry's face reddened, his own hands resting on the broadness of Malfoy's chest almost clenching at the cloth there. Harry didn't know why he's wobbling but it must be from dizziness, not because he was intimidated being naked
Draco snorted, then opened the wardrobe tentatively, looking back at Harry who was side-by-side with him. “I don’t know that. It seems that the last time we kissed, Potter, you eagerly moved your lips.”
"You thought my life was perfect just because I was The-Boy-Who-Lived?" Harry shook his head. "That's where you're wrong. I never figured out I was a wizard ‘til I reached my eleventh birthday. My Muggle family treated me like I was some vermin. Though I never asked for people's sympathy, that’s why as much as possible, my true life story was never written on the papers. I never shared them."
Malfoy bit him again on the same spot of his neck, and Harry swore there was already blood leaking off his skin. Harry punched him lightly and listened further, keeping Malfoy in his place as he held both of Malfoy's hands on his own lap. He gave Malfoy a
"So," Harry cleared his throat, "I wasn't exactly stalking you, I was trying to get you to talk to me about some
the Irish voice said, followed by a small muffled thud beside Harry's bed. It was Seamus on his bed, and Harry made sure he had his breathing constricted. Malfoy wasn't breathing either.
He first scanned the area of the dungeons and found he was not there. There were only Isabella Watson and Gregory Goyle in the Slytherin Common Room. Disappointed, he looked at the other parts of the map. He saw Ron near the West Wing walking with Millicent Bulstrode for their after-class activity while Hermione was well-spotted in the library with Ollie Rosevelt and Susan Bones. Harry flipped the pages of the parchment impatiently. There was Snape talking to Professor Robin near the Northern Towers... the Patil twins...
"Then act like one, Potter," Draco drawled. "You could traumatize children with that type of show. It's a rule not to display affection publicly in Hogwarts even before Dolores Umbridge existed, wizards such as ourselves should know that by now."
He buried his head on Malfoy's collarbone, and his emotions had poured out of him like waterfall. As for the blond, he remained silent and still, arms wrapped around Harry's figure. "You're right, Malfoy, I should just vanish off the Wizarding World so the world would be better to live in."
In five seconds of watching Malfoy, Harry's lungs felt a strong force of contraction, and in a flash without realizing it, Harry was dashing out of the Great Hall. He could've raised his middle fingers at Malfoy, or curse him like the usual but he didn't. Regret filled Harry's insides because now he was nothing but a damsel in distress.
Harry was happy for his two best friends' relationship development. The two of them are meant for each other, something Harry hadn't felt for Cho when he was in love with her. Could Luna make him feel such way? Heart all giddy and jumpy if he and Luna were given a chance to be together?
" said Pansy, noticing Harry's flamed ears. "But you know, Potter. Er, the rumors, Draco never clarified you two did not, by any chance, do all the implied accusation."
"Harry, I'm sorry but Draco doesn't want to talk to you right now." Pansy fed her tamed frog with a dead bug before she looked at Harry and side-glancing Draco who was fifteen feet away looking at their direction with narrowed eyes, Pansy's eyes had filled with guilt as hers found Draco's. "He told me himself that if you asked, I should decline no matter what."
"How did you find me?" Draco panted and shut his eyes again, his voice scarily fading away from him. "Of all people who'd find me, why this
“You don't seem alright,” Harry said, voice a little cracked and Malfoy swiveled his head away, coiling further to himself. He knew what it felt like to be scared from not knowing what's about to come.
had been noticeably avoiding Harry since their unfortunate situation. It was great Malfoy no longer smirked and taunted Harry like he used to, but it would've been greater for Harry's peace of mind if Malfoy did it in
Malfoy shot Harry a look that was none other than a glare, a softer version of what he usually gave Harry - which was always immensely sharp, a trademark of some sort. His face was pinking up and Harry only raised his eyebrows, still awaiting Draco's answer.
He thumbed the phial open, poured three drops of it in the glass of water then mixed it with the spoon. He picked the dry towel next, dipped it in the bowl full of water and wringed the cloth. He waded and folded it, walked beside Malfoy's bed again and sat on the edge of it, letting himself sink on the mattress.
After their classes ended, Harry, along with Ron and Hermione, plucked a good amount of food off the hall, always except for Harry who barely get a fistful of anything, then went upstairs to eat in the warmth of their Common Room. The three of them sat on the large red carpet on the floor, encircling their food, and Harry, like the usual, didn't listen to them that much, having a world of his own.
For a moment, he had completely forgotten about Luna but upon remembering, he calmed down a bit. Maybe his Saturday won’t be too bad after all.
"... don’t like scolding you, but look at you! You’re paler, your performance in classes is dropping. Look at your cheeks too, they sank!” Hermione continued.
Just as promised Harry had eaten downstairs to the hall, plenty enough to make Hermione smile at him and lend him her notes off their first period after all their classes – there arriving dinnertime. Though before he could think of crispy bacon and mashed potatoes, he made sure he returned to the library for a better understanding of
"Bloody wanker, what was that for!" Harry asked, out of words. Here he was thinking his day could get normal.
The Gryffindor was tucked in the blanket that the madam provided, then shared a fair share of conversation with Malfoy about how serious Harry's condition was. Harry heard that he might develop a Chronic Fatigue if he didn't stop his bad eating habits now (just as what Malfoy said) and it was Malfoy's job to monitor his health, in which Harry saw how much the blond was holding back to say that he wasn't in
And Draco Malfoy's case wasn't any different from the second factor he just mentioned. The need for Harry to talk to him about what he witnessed in the Wing filled his mind and couldn't stop thinking of it. It wasn't his business, somehow, but then – what was that? Why was Draco Malfoy drenched in his own blood? Was his theory right about the suicide attempt or not? Harry wanted to find out, but not exactly knowing the method to use since this is a very sensitive topic to touch – very
The Slytherin yanked Harry upwards and pushed him to the dusty couch Harry previously sat on. He raised the apple he held dearly and moved forward towards Potter who had his eyes closed. He leaned to Harry again, shaking him and the Gryffindor could only hitch his breath.
"I don't know why I agreed to this, I lost my mind," Draco said after managing his laugh by coughing.
"Erm - let's go back inside, Malfoy. We haven't had dinner yet," Harry offered, standing up in his seat and starting walking fast, face unbearably hot. Why did he think that Malfoy's bloody lips were so
"Well, Potter. I'm rich, I have an extravagant room back in the Malfoy Manor and I have everything. Galleons, sickles and every luxury I deserve. Being trapped in such a small room is highly inappropriate for my taste, isn't it?"
Draco cleared his throat, eyeing Harry suspiciously before relaxing his shoulders, making his decision with a firm look.
"None taken, Potter." Draco was gritting his teeth, face darkening. "Don't apologize to me about what you've seen. I am a perfectly capable sixteen-year old boy who needs no assistance – or pity."
"I wasn't," Harry said, eyes back up stargazing. "I just - I don't know. It feels weird for me to sit beside you feeling relaxed." Harry fiddled his fingers, attentively listening to the chirring of cicadas to calm his nerves as he rambled on, sure that Malfoy was listening to him. "The first time we met, we were in a very unfortunate circumstance. We were kids, no firm stands in life yet and you were the least type of person I needed as a friend because you reminded me so much of my abusive cousin in the muggle house I grew up in - even if you did offer friendship. You look like a bully to be exact, and I hated bullies as much as I hate my cousin. I don't get why you hated me so much first rather than me hating you first. Somehow that hatred
The brief silence meant Draco must’ve remembered it as well as soon as it was mentioned to him. “Wait… No, no, no, you don’t understand. You of all people should know being contained in a room with someone you hate is – "
Just as Harry was about to turn the dusty doorknob to get off the cupboard, Malfoy spoke. "I can't wait for that, Potty -
Harry's breath shortened, grabbing Draco's collar with his left hand. It was his turn to pin Draco on the nearby wall and pressed the top of his wand on Draco's chin.
“It – it won’t open! I tried spelling it yet it's still like this.” Draco persisted to continuously twist the knob and kick again and again.
"Since Malfoy's a new guest. Let 'im have the honor of eating the cake first!" Hagrid boomed, setting the plate directly on Malfoy's lap and Harry could only hope for the best Malfoy's teeth wouldn't break, stomach churning at the image. Malfoy looked at Harry as if asking for a silent help, but Harry urged a hand instead, reassuring him it wasn't poisonous, though not promising it was edible.
"I know you're not ignorant, Malfoy," Harry said, managing the courage he was supposed to have moments ago. "Our fourth year was full of suffering, I don't know how it went with you but you know well the return of the Dark Lord. At least your father informed you and your mum, am I right?"
." He felt Malfoy lean forward because a forehead was now bumping on his own. Harry, eyes fluttering weakly, turned away and pressed the side of his cheek on the wall.
wailed Hermione in the Great Hall that caused Harry and Ron to keep their heads down, because anytime soon, she'd be a ballooned bullfrog with a red face. They were being scolded, the both of them - Harry for not telling he was going to have detention with Malfoy by Professor McGonagall (then ended up, quite literally, stuck in a detention with Malfoy for
“So, Harry, you’ve been dozing off in class I see," he heard Hermione say that caugh a little of his attention.
Harry, not quite finished yet with his explanation, gasped when Malfoy’s hand pressed on his neck, constricting Harry from breathing. Malfoy’s eyes narrowed and the shaking of his pupils said he was extremely triggered.
Harry leaned towards Draco's ear that pulled a quick flinch out of the blond. "Thank you for considering this visit at Hagrid's. I really appreciate it. It won't be long since Hagrid would only talk about you, me then a little about Hogwarts. It won't be a waste of time," Harry whispered, ignoring Hagrid humming the Hogwarts song as he starts cutting the cake he baked. "Let loose. Hagrid won't judge you. He forgets his hatred towards people once they start showing signs of kindness."
at the moment? He was going harebrained, unfortunately. Maybe he already was. He flinched as Malfoy's presence walked beside him.
"Could you please eat?" Ron urged, nudging Harry lightly who was paying no attention to him and his surroundings. He pushed Harry's bowl and poked him one last time, hoping for his attention.
Harry could sense his own blood boil and Malfoy was shaking, unidentifiable if from anger or from being on the verge of crying from fury. "Just tell me your reason, then okay! I could leave you alone forever for all I care. Just do this one thing and we're through."
And they went silent for a while, shoulders brushing past each other as their gaze found the stars again - which are each other's eyes, staring at the deepness of it. Harry was speechless, how Draco's eyes had a hint of blue under the scrutiny of the moon's glow, how intense it looked at Harry's own that inexplicably disturbed something in Harry's chest.
The Slytherin blushed and looked away from Harry, and that was the most amusing reaction Harry has ever seen from him. Getting under Malfoy's skin had always sated his satisfaction and this was no different than the teases they shared throughout their years of studying together.
Harry drew in a deep breath. He arrived at the library and looked for the books that he needed. He walked to the familiar bookshelves and stacked heavy books in his arms until the height reached his chin – and now he was almost wobbling. When he managed to turn around to return to the table, his books had certainly hit someone on the chest since the figure groaned. The books –
Harry spelled himself dry when he felt the temperature increasing slowly on the touch of his skin. Malfoy was still quiet and vacant, but spoke after an interminable silence, moving closer to Harry.
Sighing mentally, he said his brief farewell to Snape and trudged back to the Great Hall wearing a who knows how awful face. The Great Hall was starting to be deserted and all his Gryffindor friends had dissipated. Considering it a bit of a good thing they weren't there anymore, Harry went straight ahead to the Slytherins and looked at anything except Malfoy's, Parkinson's and Zabini's eyes that were all trained on him when he arrived at their table like an interruption to their small celebration. Draco looked shocked to see him, but Harry acted like he didn't see.
Harry's fist clenched in Malfoy's palm. The answer was too clipped. "Could you elaborate that for me?"
Harry looked down, stared at Malfoy’s curious eyes before answering. "Er, yes, when I was younger, my aunt and uncle would lock me up in a cupboard when I did something that irritated them. They won’t let me eat for a whole day too. I would cry nonstop then I’d talk to my figurines until I'm fine.”
Draco huffed. "I just hate you that much, yes." He wiped his mouth with a tissue paper this time and walked away.
Harry groaned, trotting back to the castle side by side with still-in-a-laughing-fit Draco bloody Malfoy. "
Harry's face fell to a frown, sitting on the edge of the bed again and stared at Malfoy's sleeping figure. An overwhelming amount of sympathy tugged Harry's chest. He unconsciously gripped Draco's hand and squeezed it. Draco's face, as to what was observable, held mysteries and wonders that were more prominent when he's sleeping. His eyelashes were long, and his lips were parted as he breathed, like the Malfoy that he was, Purebloods with good genes. Harry was envious of how soft Draco's skin looked, while Harry was full of callouses all over him, having rough skin and original paleness replaced with fairness due to constant exposure under the sun.
Harry froze, barely stepping his right foot up the staircase. He swiveled his body around like just as how he'd turn when the Golden Snitch zoomed to a different direction when he's about to grab it.
Well, Harry was undeniably hard, and hadn't been properly one since his make-out session with a Hufflepuff before their hell week started. He particularly liked Miss Owen MacDonald's plump lips and smooth nubs of her chest. Harry shut his eyes, becoming rigid as possible because Malfoy, the slow git, noticed his growing bulge. He froze on top of Harry, lost for words, he felt the blond shudder on him, mouth flapping.
"So, Potter?" Draco arched his brow. "Of course they don't. I don't talk to them about my personal business. They're my closest friends and I don't let my mouth slip off to them. And
interaction, because now, Malfoy wouldn't meet Harry in the eye, and was quick to vanish from the scene to avoid the hoots they kept getting once spotted in a same room wherever in Hogwarts. Unfortunately, in some classes, they were paired up and needed to deal with each other, especially in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Spotting a blond head a little farther from his line of sight, he walked faster, matching the speed of his heart rate and saw Malfoy jolt from the sound of a person's feet, arms hanging in the air in front of a cabinet. Harry didn't call Malfoy out because he couldn't. Instead, he dropped his wand so it clunked noisily to the ground, reverberation occuring to the vicinity. Malfoy would see him
"You." Harry stepped a hesitant foot towards Malfoy. "You stayed?" Which meant Malfoy actually regarded Harry's offer and didn't reject him.
- not the embarrassing one they're in now where they would be too aware of close proximity and think of other things instead of their normal,
Harry's head turned left and right to make sure the whole vicinity of school didn't hear him hiss out of character. He walked around, feet walking in circles, seriously considering going mad rather than have a conversation with Malfoy. "You know what? This is a bad idea. A
where he would make Hermione disappointed of him and force him to add an extra hour to his study time. And second, when a witch or wizard is in trouble, no matter who they were, as long as Harry saw the trouble himself or whatever-it-is, he wouldn't be able to stop seeking for a long-term solution.
" Harry raised a brow, and now his glasses were slipping dangerously off his nose that Draco, reflexively, pressed it back to Harry's face with his... bloody nose. Harry almost gagged at the proximity. He was so full of Malfoy he was going to be sick. The blond's cheeks had pinked so much that Harry's disgust was overpowered with the urge to laugh at his power to embarrass the life out of the blond. The grip on his poor wrists tightened up his head that made him wince.
Harry's face was decorated with a scarlet color again. "I'll go ahead first," Harry said threateningly, conscious of his hollowed stomach that kept grumbling within him. He took a moment to point a wand at Malfoy who was watching him. "If I ever find out you're up to no good, Malfoy. I won't hesitate to break your arm."
Harry's face flamed more along with his temper and pushed Malfoy as he spun around, slamming him to a tree. "Could you not do this madness, please?"
Harry, not knowing what to react now, remained in silence as Malfoy did Madam Pomfrey's plea. He shoved Harry his water and later accompanied Potter all the way to the Gryffindor Tower inside the deserted sixth year dormitory after. And it was true, Harry felt much better than before. He no longer feel ill and his temperature was remarkably regulating. He was still dizzy and still had his limbs aching, but not as bad as before.
Harry froze at the threatening voice and he knew at that exact moment he was busted. He looked down to see his slippers visible, not covered by the cloak. He scrambled to hide his wand and map, only to find Draco near seizing him, walking furiously towards his direction. He stumbled back and his cloak flew off his head. He was making a lot of noises,
“Okay then. Will you be fine kissing me again?” Harry didn’t know why he asked that, but he felt that even though they hate each other, consent was necessary since that's how he did it with some girls who confessed their undying love for him, them being dismal it was only a one-time thing for Harry's part.
Harry's eyes widened. Why must it be him of all people? "Professor, it's Saturday and you know Potions is not my - "
"I – " Malfoy coughed and nodded nimbly at him. "Potter, are you going to read that?” then pointed at one of Harry's held books. “I need to study something related to Potions."
"I'm not," snapped Draco, crossing his arms and Harry saw in his face the uncomfortability to spill more of the words that were obviously about to burst from Malfoy's mouth. He supposed Ron was right when he said about Malfoy not wanting to feel indebted to him, and was now doing it to make himself feel better about spatting insults to Harry.
Harry was getting embarrassed but shrugged it off. He was determined to finish what he started. "Tell me the reason you were scared when you were trapped with me in the trophy room."
Not wanting to make the atmosphere awkward, Ron spoke again, softly this time in the hopes of shaking some of Harry's senses. "By all means tell what Malfoy did this time so I could at least listen to your rants and not make Hermione mad at you for fighting with Malfoy again."
He turned around, grunting. He saw a cat-eyed girl like the Cheshire cat from a muggle movie he saw one time, wearing a heavy black mascara. She looked beautiful in her fitted green robes, Harry observed. She got the firm breasts and small waist, and she smelled like strawberry candy. This girl seemed decent, and his type too but Harry was aware that she's a good friend of Malfoy's. As far as his memory could stretch, she was Pansy Parkinson, the only extroverted Slytherin he encountered.
Harry sighed in defeat, laying tense and still because if one of his mates bust in the door, they would find his and Malfoy's
If Malfoy wouldn't tell him a piece of information about the stab, maybe his friends could. If there's one thing that he was sure of, it was Zabini and Parkinson's similar love to Draco of what Hermione and Ron have for Harry.
Draco arched his brow before he settled both of his hands on the table, preparing to sit down. Harry didn't appreciate that and raised one of his books, hoping he could smack Draco's head, but the blond didn't falter nor move away. Instead, he sat in front of Harry. Before Harry could retort, he was silenced by Draco's light-speed explanation.
"You were saying, Potter?" Malfoy asked and Harry was gasping for air. They remained still for seconds and as if the light of rationality finally dawned upon Harry, he pushed Malfoy - but that didn't work since Malfoy's weight was crushing his whole body on a bed that one of them must've required while kissing. Harry breathed first, composing himself. He tried his best ignoring how numb his lips had gotten and Malfoy's abnormally reddened lips from their ravishing.
- you could barely stand up now, Potter. Letting your guard down in front of your most hated, you're the one who's attempting suicide here, Potter."
. He also heard some rumors from Slytherins about Draco associating himself with the Dark Lord, and Harry wouldn't be surprised if it was true since his father was a proclaimed Death Eater. Harry saw Lucius with his own two eyes back in the Triwizard Tournament, the day Cedric Diggory was murdered.
He could go to the Weasleys anytime for Holidays, or at Grimmauld Place if he's feeling wanting to be alone for Christmas with Kreacher as his company. But this time, he wanted to stay at Hogwarts, visit Hagrid, play chess with someone, fly his broom in someone's company, tend to Hagrid's creatures, practice his wand attacks for future purposes of becoming an Auror. He could all do that with Malfoy, and not as a replacement for his best mate, Ron.
Harry yawned. "Just sleep it out, I say. I don’t like being with you either, but nothing would change if we whine, wouldn’t it? You’re wasting time kicking."
Harry stared at his counterpart's eyes for a while after he said that. For a moment, he saw Draco didn't look like he'd hit Harry hard or knock him dead to the ground. If he was honest, Draco looked like he was taken aback and oddly lonely for a fraction of a second, eyes full of regrets and withered hope.
Harry looked up, and Malfoy was no longer smirking and instead had his hand offering to Harry. Harry, pissed and in the care of a defective Cleansweep five, accepted the offer and glided with Malfoy in the air as they rushed towards the loop, their coat fluttering by the chill of the snowy breeze. Perceptibly, Malfoy was arrogant, nose up on a Firebolt but Harry, a mere second slower, found out last minute that the Cleansweep was very rove and clumsy and that was an advantage to distract Malfoy's smooth zooming move, keep him dizzy and possibly slow him down. Harry did just that, wearing the most smug face he could don and won their race after almost losing.
"Malfoy again?" Ron said. He spoke these exact same words hundreds of times since their first-year. "Could you please eat, mate? The oat and raisins were quite well-done. I asked Winky herself to add more sugar to your portion since you liked it too sweet. Go on."
He stayed holding Malfoy's hand for he didn't know how long, but at least, even in Malfoy's sleep, Harry had offerred Malfoy the comfort he couldn't get when he's awake, letting the soft fingers get warmer and warmer in Harry's grasp. This was the type of comfort Harry wanted during those times he wanted someone to hold his hand in silence. Just holding hands, and lots of unsaid understandings.
Coughing again, he continued. "Alright, I was probably stalking you. Only because I think you're up to no good and was vanishing randomly from the map - "
"Well, what do you even want, Malfoy? You seem to not know what you're doing with everything," Harry whispered, this time it hurts to speak. Malfoy finally released Harry's wrists, resulting in Harry sliding down the floor.
He decided to ignore Draco for a few minutes since he said so, attempting to get a good sleep yet Draco won’t stop whimpering and heaving beside him. Harry groaned for the last time. Malfoy sounded like a bothersome goat.
“I haven't," he answered, and patches of red started to appear on his face. The circle gasped and so was Harry.
"You don't have your wand?" Harry asked. This was the chance for Harry to escape and call this situation goodbye, and to his joy Draco didn't reply to him, which meant he didn't have his Hawthorn. "How unfortunate, I thought you're doing your rounds well?"
Malfoy's warm tongue did wonders to his mouth and Harry held on Malfoy's shoulders for support, chewing the transferred bite of an apple slowly. For the intimacy of the situation, Harry couldn't help but moan under the larger figure as Malfoy pressed on him further, and Harry swore he heard the blond growl hungrily. He felt fainting any moment, not caused by his hunger. Malfoy said he wanted to monopolize Harry and it was pouring like a fall, all pent-up and now gushing out. It was all because of Harry's provocation that he managed to push Malfoy on edge.
Malfoy was gripping his own legs. "Call me a ruddy coward, but I can't tell you what my problem is, Potter. Even if you Hex me to death, make me drink Veritaserum or cast at me to be covered in boils, I won't tell you. You could taunt me with it, I don't care. I am keeping my troubles, just as how you should stick your nose to your own business."
"Meet me at the Greenhouses after classes," said Harry with pride in his voice despite the lack of oxygen from overexhaustion, yanking Draco's figure upward to help him.
To Harry, Snape was lecturing something in front but no words of his registered in his ears, as if the words were passing from his ear to another ear. After a while, he noticed Ron looking at him, eyebrows raised with crossed arms. Ron only looked like that when he's waiting for Harry to finish dressing up to his house garments and come down for breakfast at the Burrow. That is, Harry hadn't figured out quickly that they're already starting their task and Ron's tapping feet couldn't wait.
"Malfoy," Harry said, an attempt to raise his guard and defend his space but ended up sounding like he was just saying Malfoy's name fondly.
Thoughtfully, he shouted, striding towards Malfoy who gathered himself like Harry, "Malfoy, I want a deal!"
His voice was low and a few goosebumps had prodded out from Harry's skin. He explained to Draco how Harry found him in Myrtle's bathroom until he saw the mark on Draco's skin.
Harry glared at Malfoy for a second, and he saw nothing but amusement in Malfoy's eyes. "As if you can, Potter. You're going to faint in five minutes, trust me. With that smell? You'd better be off to the Wing and get your arse pampered by Pomfrey."
He saw Malfoy's chest stopped moving, his Adam's apple bobbing and Harry felt relieved of his own fear since he wasn't the only one feeling on edge. He kept his position and waited for Malfoy to do anything or make a movement that would confirm he wasn't a figment of Harry's imagination.
Draco drew in a deep breath. "You ask me what I want..." Harry opened his eyes and found the blond hunkering down to level his face with Harry's. He looked
Harry was surprised by this revelation. "Certainly. Ron is logical, but time-to-time irrational when mad. Neville's just soft but he's more intense than what he shows."
Harry was sure if he looks in the mirror, he would spot his neck fully red from embarrassment. He felt exposed and naked even though he was fully-clothed.
"Okay," Malfoy stopped him, his back once again propped to the wall with the lady in the painting shrieking again. "I'm... sorry."
after. He supposed this was enough, because if Malfoy found this out, who knows how far he'd fight Harry to get rid of him off the Dungeons?
As if a lightning had struck Harry, he remembered being reminded by McGonagall they shouldn’t close the door or they wouldn’t be able to get out. Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, striding back the farthest corner of the room and flopped down the floor, wading himself upon the cold wooden plank and closed his eyes, propping his head on his palm.
Harry's nose flared, cheeks warm. He stared at Draco’s hand first and stood there heaving. He didn’t know what to do. He wasn’t a coward either, but isn’t this dare too much?
He stood in the middle of the circle, clenched his fist. He clicked his tongue at Malfoy and asked Abbot, “So what do we do?”
"Oh, Malfoy – s-sorry," he said briskly. Draco had books in his arms too, and compared to Harry's, his were lesser, and it only reached his chest.
And it was Draco's turn to cringe. “Don’t act like you didn’t enjoy yourself with my kiss, Potter. No girl ever rejected it, and you’re not an exception. Saw it with my own two twenty-twenty eyes.”
back to how it used to be. Malfoy didn't look at him when Harry greeted him, nor showed fondness when Harry attempted to slip in a small talk when Malfoy walked the same direction as him to any of their classes they shared. He also attempted to join Malfoy and Pansy the other day in a casual conversation about how their classes had been but Draco only pretended Harry wasn't there and he felt so mad for it. He has the right to – Harry was betrayed.
"Don't dodge me!" Harry gritted his teeth. It hurts. "Besides, you have me in your arms, I'm weakened and I'm at your mercy, I won't be able to move if you don't allow it. What could I do about that?"
"Now, Potter," Malfoy bit on his apple, eyes fixated on Harry's green eyes, "go on, ask questions, I feel good-hearted today since you're weakened and it feels really good."
Draco said, but he sounded like he didn't mean it, which comforted something within Harry. Too soft. He took a moment to get a spare band-aid packet under his pillow and placed one of it on Malfoy's cut.
easy - what I mean by difficult is that he's a pureblood and a traditional one. He's got none of the modern touch we had. You're a kind and determined wizard, Harry, I don't see any reason why I should hinder you from conquering Draco's trust but he'd outright kill you, I think."
He halted at the empty wall and closed his eyes. He focused, breathing evenly as much as possible and said mentally, "
Pansy's grin fell gradually and held Harry's wrist, yanking him away from Draco's view and hid behind a large tree. "You know Draco is self-entitled. He wouldn't last a day feeling below and unimportant. He hates humiliation and had always needed to be the cream of the crop, the most valued and treated like a deity of some power. He's like that, Harry. Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy made sure he was spoiled with all the things he wanted. I grew up with him and he'd always been arrogant. He changed because... he's been lonely and confused."
Draco, without replying to Harry's answer, ran his hands down on the curve of Harry's spine and found the softness of Harry's arse. He ghosted a warm breath at Harry's mouth before he squeezed the mounds, kneading it with vigor and he earned him a loud gasp from Harry, still not breaking eye contact.
the book, Potter?" he asked again, splaying his palm open more impatiently. Malfoy attempted politeness right there, but failed anyway since it's Harry Potter who's in front of him – ending up making a disgusted face. Harry grimaced.
"Ten points from Gryffindor." Draco's voice cracked, breaking the silence which Harry didn't understand why Malfoy said it so suddenly. To Harry, it looked as if Malfoy was trying to distract himself from Harry's face, to not be aware of it while he stared.
Malfoy snorted at him, as if a response of letting Harry know he wouldn't believe the single lie he just said. Malfoy then cupped his own pocket, he must be attempting to feel his wand, yet basing from how his eyes widened, freezing on the spot, he seemed to have failed to find it.
Harry gulped, panicking that he hadn't thought this through. He knew Malfoy would probably go back to their manor to be with his mother for Christmas, especially now that Draco's father was in Azkaban as stated by the
that I'm talking about," Harry said. "It is about you with me through this two hell of weeks since you seemed like you'd embarrass me through it, and get off on torturing me."
and I never liked attention - in fact, I appreciate being left alone. And stop with the gay thing because I
A seemingly interminable minute had passed, Draco was more fidgety in his position, obviously desperate to be freed from Harry's grasp, but he kept his mouth firmly together, not sure of what to do next. Harry raised his eyebrows.
After a few minutes, Harry did not miss his instinct telling him that someone was staring at the back of his head this whole time he was temporarily focused on Potions. He looked around the dim room, to find who it was that was plotting to antagonize him. His eyes narrowed, realizing who it was and should've realized it sooner.
Harry let out a breathy laugh that he wasn't sure was a laugh or a cough to cover his shame, or both. "I was desperate." And it was true. He wanted Malfoy to talk to him again. He just didn't plan this thoroughly. It was weird being a man who had always been in to girls, baring his clothes off to display it to a man who happened to be his archenemy. He had gone truly mad.
"You know what Potter," he finally responded, “I don’t know what to do, really. There is a feeling of me wanting to run away as far away as possible from you. This is ridiculous – we
And with the same password as the office door, Harry pushed the trophy room open. The two of them coughed as fogs of dusts ghosted out from the inside. Harry held his breath for a moment and outstretched his hand inside to find the switch for the bulb. When he found it, light flooded the room which revealed a very dusty room full of stoppering trophies and crawling spiders. Harry's nose twitched.
Tuesday morning arrived and his face could already match the paleness of a pasty-skinned vampire, the bags under his eyes were comparable to the size of Hagrid's thumbprint. He walked down the Great Hall with tired, snail-like footsteps, looked for Ron and Hermione's usual spot and sat between them, burying his face on the table like his body was the heaviest thing he was carrying. Ron, who was first to greet him, nudged him his breakfast bowl and Hermione next, pouring him a glass of choco milk.
were." Harry's voice came out pissy than intended and watched Malfoy intently. "You were with me for two bloody weeks and very close to me, then suddenly you've fucked off after. I do have the right to feel mad here, don't I?"
. "You don't play this way with me, Potter. I'm more fucked up and a prat than what I show, and you don't want to be involved. That is a warning."
Harry nodded and didn't ask further, even though he couldn't trust Malfoy whether it was true or not since Malfoy was rather a notorious liar throughout the course of their stay at Hogwarts. Harry could only guess that Narcissa Malfoy's plan for Christmas involved visiting Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban bawling her eyes out for the rest of the break alone with him, shut out from the rest of the world.
Harry closed his eyes, leaning towards Draco's palm that may have unconsciously rose up to wipe Harry's damp face, Harry nudging the hand while holding on Draco's back with both of his hands. A moment later, he felt Malfoy's free hand caress on his other cheek, wiping off Harry's tears himself with his fingers that shook Harry's stomach a little.
Harry finally spoke, sighing. "Malfoy Hexed a couple of first-years yesterday. No, they weren't badly injured, but they were terrified to pass through the Great Hall's chambers because of the incident. Malfoy Hexed me in return and I was the one who lost house points when Professor Sprout saw me casting at Malfoy a similar Hex he did, on the shin. Ron - I couldn't - I couldn't control my temper these days. I'm really sorry," Harry explained, as Ron observed, as calm as his mate could. He gave Harry a pat on the back and carried on eating.
Harry tensed up. "No matter how much I may hate you, no one deserves to feel whatever causes a person to," Harry couldn't speak further of this particular topic but he forced himself, "commit...
The broom cupboard was the only place he could think of since it was the space where Rita Skeeters had questioned him in his fourth year: The
on the map, pitter-pattering through at the same time. Draco was complaining something about the unimportance of doing rounds in the morning as a prefect.
"I don't know if I would be of any help to this but I admit I don't have enough brain power for Potions," Harry said.
Harry's eyes narrowed, but trying not to snap Malfoy's still-stroked ego. "I don't believe you," Harry said softly, but he failed to keep the pleased Malfoy around since Malfoy suddenly frowned, unfortunately back to his normal self.
Harry's friend and the two of them would most likely to get on each other's throat once the Madam was gone.
As the door closed after a few hurried steps, Harry relaxed and exhaled in pure relief. He released Malfoy and was certainly not a good idea since he received a rather hurtful pinch on his waist.
“Malfoy, look at me,” he called, tentatively outstretching his hand and held on Draco's shoulder, who jolted upon contact. The blond looked up and Harry's eyes widened when he saw Draco's pupils, all shaky and glazed from crying. Draco pressed his palms together again to cover his face, realizing Potter had taken a good picture of his face.
They stared with wonder at each other first, confused why they did it, but Harry just knew at the moment he was curious to feel that thin and soft mouth again on him, despite Malfoy being a bloke. Harry's heart trembled at the thought, somehow guilty because why in Merlin does Malfoy's lips resembled Luna's? Very girlish and pink, very soft-looking. A few seconds later, simultaneously, they leaned forward, closed their eyes and bumped on each other's nose.
Draco's eyes shook. Harry might have said too much, but it was all he could think of. All his pain and agony were suddenly on the verge of bursting off his body and projecting it all at Malfoy.
to do the order, just being polite. The madam gave Malfoy the vial and left in an instant, scurrying off the Wing.
He suppose that was good, no student would be harmed by random Hexes that were originally meant for him. But knowing Malfoy, he never misses one of his breakfasts. He was strict with everything that he does, rules and Slytherin codes, and Harry found it odd. He really shouldn't be concerned about this, but he felt some uneasiness hanging on his stomach. Malfoy was prone to trouble, as much as Harry was he admits, and who knows if he might have been – or currently, in one again. There was a time he saved Malfoy from a couple of Ravenclaws who played with his breathing pattern to torture him in fifth year. That was too much, and so he acted about it immediately, and not because he had some serious Savior Complex. He didn't receive any thanks from Malfoy that time, but it was completely understandable since Harry was aware how much that helping affected Draco's ego.
Malfoy gathered himself again and signaled his hand for Harry to back away since Harry was near his personal space. The Gryffindor sat back down in an instant.
not Malfoy!" then carried on gaping to his chair. It wasn't a shocking news that he was easy to read by her with just a scan of her eyes. "It's… something – but – but not Draco Malfoy. Plus I'm not hungry."
Harry's heart was thumping so fast that he pushed Malfoy with all his might. He successfully unfastened Malfoy off him, but before Malfoy slipped off the bed to unveil himself from the cover of the curtain, Harry caught his hand in time, managing a killer grip and holding Malfoy between his chest. Malfoy didn't complain and listened with Harry as the conversation between Seamus and Ron continues. They were in a very awkward hugging position, and were too nervous to feel unenviable.
"Malfoy is one of my best Potions students, Mr. Potter. If you would not be enough of assistance, then you two could work together. Go straight to my classroom.
“Do not close the trophy room’s door,” she added, “or you won’t be able to go out unless someone from outside opens it. That room's been tried to be fixed for years but sadly, the Hogwarts staff failed.”
Everyone was still talking about him and Malfoy that Professor Sprout called and talked to him alone after class about safe sex between two underage wizards because she said she kept hearing the same topic from the students. Harry, who was too polite to decline the concerned old professor's brief discussion, just hoped the ground would soon
Though the blond didn’t remove his head from the crook of Harry's neck, nor slapped Harry's fingers that were caressing his hair. He stayed and remained silent. Malfoy whispered, "I'll get you tomorrow, Potter. I'll ruin your Potions quiz."
Harry was about to throw his retort when his stomach churned again. His knees felt boneless and his legs' strength was escaping him. This time he was sure he had no strength left to get out a word to talk to Malfoy or open his eyes.
Harry, losing his patience, drew out his wand and pointed it firmly on Malfoy's chin which Malfoy did as well, eyes narrowing at Harry as he held his right hand's index. Harry wasn't in a mood for stand-off, especially now the goal was to be civil and humanly informal with Malfoy. "Try me, Malfoy. Could you please," Harry closed his eyes, his patience running out, "just
The weekend had quickly passed by and Harry did his best to distract himself from all the silliest of things that happened to him last Saturday night. He did all his homework, surprisingly, without the constant blabbering of Hermione's usual orders, he brewed his failed concoction for Potion's class over and over again until Snape was satisfied and had read his test reviewers for Charms and Transfiguration until he fell asleep on his desk in the dormitory at three am.
Harry furrowed his brow, turned away and held his own neck as he walked out of the door. He really was warmer than his usual temperature. He couldn't smell anything but his own strong scent of musk even though he sniffed himself thoughtfully. Maybe Malfoy was toying with him but he might as well go to the Wing to make sure.
Draco roamed his eyes around the hut for a moment, seeing all the chicken feathers and fur Fang shed that Harry also saw. Harry sensed Malfoy's deep disgust, but suppressing it for Harry's sake. Draco's palms were glistening with sweat and kept it gripping on his inner palm as if calming himself down. Harry supposed it wasn't just for being disgusted.
A few moments later, Draco stood up from his seat, and that must be the sign of the start of Hermione and Draco's morning rounds as prefects. Harry seemed to have finally noticed him due to Malfoy's absence, brought his look down to his feet and smiled appreciatively.
"Malfoy!" Harry walked faster and felt his face hot. Hagrid shouldn't have shared a story that would give Malfoy all the reason to tease him.
Draco’s smirk dissipated, not expecting Harry's sudden compliance and swiveled around to walk out of the circle. So, he was after all as scared as Harry to do the dare. He strode away and halted in front of a dusty-looking wooden wardrobe. Harry trudged defiantly, on the verge of puking.
Harry didn’t know why he did it, but he felt his hands had gone cold. He released the book, letting Draco get it, but he persisted with what he wanted to say. He was hesitating whether he would directly ask Malfoy about his scarred and marked arm, or would he ask Draco to come to him to a much private area.
already. We could be bloody coworkers in the Ministry in ten years. Our children could be friends too. We could be in the same department. You can't expect to let yourself get eaten by your childish hatred towards me. It had to change at some point."
He trailed his fingers on the scarred arm, heart pounding. There was a lot more to the skin when he pushed the sleeve up, revealing a much worse-looking mark way up his arm. A skull with a slithering snake down to the length of his arms. Chill ran down on Harry's spine when he saw it up close. He couldn't help it. The mark was so familiar that there was no way he'd forget it. It was the same mark he saw on all the Death Eaters' arms in the day of the Triwizard Tournament, Voldemort's followers squeezing him to his near death.
said progress went straight to the abyss of misery in a blink of an eye because everything that happened between them during the break, like a fever dream, was forgotten a week after being out of their vacation, horribly flooded with second term's requirements with their
," Draco snapped, as if asking Harry to shut up and end the conversation fast. He looked hopeful that Harry would initiate to cut it, but Harry was too determined to continue.
“No,” Hermione said. “I really apologize, Harry. I can't un-spell what I’ve casted, even if I want to help you. That’s why Pansy reminded this game is dangerous. I’m really sorry. I'll write you your Divination essay later.”
Malfoy adjusted himself, a little alarmed, but his competitiveness was showing open wide for Harry to see, and he knew how much Malfoy was motivated to beat him in everything. Since they were younger, it was always Malfoy who was willing to prove himself worthy and better than Harry. "And if I win, Potter, you'd leave me the fuck alone with my business," Malfoy drawled.
More reason for Harry to feel he deserved being swallowed by the floor. He just now remembered how hungry he was.
Ron's eyes softened, remembering those moments Harry woke up sweaty all over his neck, shouting half-conscious about a murdered man and other killings he never heard of where Seamus and Ron needed to assist him order to wake Harry up fully in the middle of the night, because he usually wouldn't wake alone, have random seizures and would accidentally do wandless magic in his sleep that had a tendency to harm everyone near him. It was a lot to handle.
Malfoy's face looked like he was thrown into an icy river. Harry thought Malfoy's face couldn't get any shade paler than Malfoy's remarkable skin color, but it did. Harry took a step back, reading the tension. He was wrong, the softened Malfoy had upgraded his wards again and wore his distant facade.
And they stared at each other for a whole minute. Both of their eyes were filled with rage, questions, confusion and the need to understand things. Harry wanted to know all of it, but not in this circumstance, not as them being enemies.
"He's all better. But it would be wonderful if you could observe him for awhile, Potter. I have to speak to Professor Snape about – well... obviously – this in his office. Make him drink that by mixing it to his water, strictly three drops, my boy. The glass is on the table beside him, and make sure he has damp towel on his forehead. It's all on the table!"
Harry almost hissed like a snake when he saw Malfoy, almost doing the same the moment they saw each other, revolted they're in the same room.
Harry almost vomited all of his breakfast that consisted of porridge and hard-boiled eggs. What the fuck was Malfoy thinking? "
"Oh, little pretty boy!" A painting of a fair maiden in gown exclaimed, making Draco and Harry jump in their positions at the same time. "I think someone is here with you as of the moment, I saw a boy's head floating a while ago! He had glasses! Handsome, handsome, charming boy like you are!"
Yesterday he had told all of the story of finding Malfoy to Ron and Hermione without blinking out of panic once he got out of the Wing. They listened intently, gasping in the right moment, and just like him, they were as curious and suspicious as he was, and Harry supposed that him being not the only one thinking of it indicated he was perfectly normal to think and feel in such a way.
Hermione was too quick to pick up what Harry might be thinking and said, “If you’re worried about Malfoy, don’t be. We'd keep you away from him. Luna Lovegood would be there if that eases you up."
"I'd do it," Harry said, pursing his lips. "I don't know if this is going to work but I could try." He got ideas. Ideas definitely out of his league but Malfoy was exactly that so he could do it.
Pansy's eyes sparkled. "You can get his attention by shocking him, a one-way ticket to get him to look at you. He'll listen to you in no time."
"Potter, be coherent," Malfoy said impatiently, but waiting for Harry to finish his words with curious eyes. He looked like he had an idea what Harry would say, but gave the Gryffindor a shot to explain.
slow learners, Potter. He ensures they suffer in his hands. Now it shows who those snail-brained students are – I mean, you are included.”
Harry buried his chin on his knees to seem smaller and kept his gaze on the floor, trying his best to look uninterested. His heart was beating so fast he couldn't hear the crowd. He knew how Truth or Dare games went in some muggle parties held every after Dudley's birthday party where he was forced to listen from upstairs. It was wild, exposing truths and daring someone to do something so bold. Harry couldn't handle it.
Just as Harry was about to muster up the courage and spat another claim why Malfoy doesn't look like he regrets it, Hagrid came with a plateful of sliced pound cake, chocolate syrup drizzled on top.
He turned the knob, kicked it, spelled it, but none of his tactics worked. He saw Hermione from his peripheral stood from the circle and approached him.
Harry's hearing was almost destroyed when Malfoy laughed, hands clutching his own stomach from intense laughter. Harry was so insulted that he simply looked away. He knew what Malfoy would say next. Something about stupidity and heroism.
, your arm would be destroyed in a few minutes based on how those veins swelled beneath your skin easily, which indicates your skin was likely poisoned inside and out.
After, he stepped back to inhale and looked at Malfoy. He saw crystal clear that Malfoy's eyes were widened, as if not expecting for Harry to apologize for the second time. As for Harry, he wanted to let Malfoy see he was genuinely sorry.
Harry's throat constricted, not really processing what was happening. He looked at everyone helplessly and only Abbot who offered him explanation. She was smiling, and Harry felt something so ominous about it.
Draco held the small packet Harry had curiously. Harry expected Malfoy would say something revolting about a muggle stuff being on his skin, but he didn't. In fact, he looked amused and carefully tried to make himself comfortable around Harry.
"Thanks," Harry said, not forgetting to add sincerity to his tone. "I didn’t know it was easier to understand when it’s taught that way to me. Snape barely slows down when he teaches." Harry slipped his note between his notebook and threw it in his satchel, able to say he was prepared for tomorrow's Potions quiz. His shoulders relaxed and he took a moment to stretch his limbs.
Ron wanted to ask further questions, but chose not to press on about it, about, obviously about Draco Malfoy since Harry was so keen on stalking the blond, just to find out if he was
"I don't have any ulterior motives, Malfoy. And I've won our duel! Then after we could go back to our silly fights and childish insults with clear conscience. You should comply, because all in all you lost to me. And you're here for that."
"Could I order a bunch of these next time when I want them? I'd pay galleons," Malfoy said hesitantly, eyes sparkling as if he never ate such a good delicacy off their manor, shy but kept grabbing pound cakes anyway while mouth still full. Harry found the situation odd but didn't retort. He never thought Hagrid and Malfoy would have such a smooth conversation.
Despite himself, he reciprocated Draco's careful gaze. For an absurd reason, the atmosphere felt odd. It was an atmosphere too calm to be called a storm, but too boggling to be called peaceful. Malfoy was too unpredictable, like a ticking time bomb. His eyes were empty despite the smile he had on his face, which disconcerted Harry further.
rumor and bypassing it. He was wrong. Harry's face heated up because it has been a while since he thought of
Harry stood before a table and watched Snape give Draco a rolled paper, which he thought contained the instructions only Malfoy would probably understand better than Harry. After a few minutes, Snape then left the classroom and left the door open, which was a relief because the last time he was in a room with Malfoy, they had to survive each other's presence throughout a night.
Feeling his face flush further from his remark, Harry determinedly opened his eyes and finally gazed at the blond, holding the eye contact that felt like electricity zapping down his spine the moment he saw the gray stormy eyes. Harry trembled when he found Malfoy eyeing him with the same intensity and darkness - paralyzed like what Harry wanted him to be in the state of. Harry had spread his arms to emphasize his point, offering himself in a sacrificial manner. "I'm willing to give you anything you want, so
Harry looked down a little and greeted the little boy who seemed to be a first year student. He asked the boy what was wrong, and the answer was immediate.
"What does she have to do with this? What do you mean?" Harry listened, not taking his eyes off Malfoy's back.
Seamus broke into a laugh and Harry wished he could silence it himself. He felt Malfoy wiggle uncomfortably on him.
He hitched his breath when Malfoy removed his own hands out of his face, revealing his feverish-looking eyes. Harry's fingers unconsciously trembled, not wanting this odd situation more than Malfoy. He would sleep, alright… forget this happened, and return to their normal selves by tomorrow. Draco's heartbeats were felt by Harry's arms, and that didn't help the situation. They were
"Alright Potter," said Parkinson. "It's warm here now, thank the dear fireplace. Make yourself at home and tell us what's the matter."
Harry chuckled, surprised he did it so unrestrained. He didn't know how long since he laughed like this with someone. "He's always hyper and vulgar with his words. Wouldn't restrict his mouth but he's the kindest person."
He glared at Malfoy for his accusation and he seemed to have believed him after a few seconds of staring at Harry. "Okay then, just don't move, please," Malfoy plead and Harry nodded, causing him to rub his cheek on Malfoy's ear accidentally.
Harry didn't bother hiding his groan and found the professor halting his demonstration of how to keep the cauldron at a certain temperature since it was a complex brew (the fire couldn't be out of control). Snape looked annoyed because he lost his momentum. Snape remained in his position, staring at the both of them and said, "Mr. Malfoy, you know I do not allow changing of partners in Potions. Yours and Potter's mark is already being brewed along with your antidote,
"Madam Pomfrey, would I be able to leave later on too?" Harry asked and remembered his untouched assignments for three days that needed to be done by Monday. There was also their usual Inter-House Unity every weekend where he and Draco had to participate in as well.
?" Draco asked, head tilting in confusion and Harry's stomach churned. He didn't have the time to think this through, or what to say to Malfoy since this wasn't what he planned to do before his classes started.
Harry waited for Malfoy's footprints to appear on the paper, his back propped on the wall and watching some Slytherins pass before him.
! It's just that my mates would find this horrible if they found us like this. I just closed my curtains to be safe."
A few hours later, Harry accompanied his best friends to Hogwarts Express eight in the morning, thanking Merlin he hadn't found Draco around the express because that would've meant Malfoy not staying at Hogwarts. Though Harry did spot Parkinson and Zabini hand in hand towards the express, followed by Bulstrode and some Ravenclaw Harry barely knew.
" Harry pursed his lips and looked at the grayness of Malfoy's piercing gaze. Malfoy looked annoyed yet waited for more of his words.
Malfoy gripped on Harry's shoulders and it caused Harry nothing but butterflies to run amok in his stomach. He might be going nuts because that wasn't supposed to be his reaction. He looked up at Malfoy, bewilderedly. Sometimes he wished he knew what Malfoy had in mind.
"Of course you guessed," said Pansy. "I guess you figured too, that I am the only person Draco could talk to aside from Blaise. As Blaise said, he's
Harry could see everyone properly now without the distortion of the previous color-changing lights, all wearing their clothes again thankfully. He momentarily got confused when the full-packed crowd suddenly dissipated, leaving the room with a much fewer people. When he had thoughts of asking anyone why, a hand had yanked Harry backward that caused him to stumble back.
Harry, swallowing his dignity, enveloped his left hand around Malfoy, pulling him towards himself and rested his fingers on Malfoy's head. He waited for Malfoy to pummel him, to struggle out of his grasp, and kick him but none of those possibilities happened.
They stared intensely at each other for a while before Malfoy had snapped out of it by blinking, glaring at Harry right after, raising his nose.
"I can't talk to a person tense about having me talk," Harry sighed and had let himself completely flop on his seat despite the dust particles crawling up his robe. "Could you... relax? I don't feel okay not being casual - "
like Hermione. His method of teaching was student-friendly, and the way he spoke said well of his mastery of the area. When Harry doesn't get something, Malfoy makes sure he explains it in another way Harry would. It turned out to be a surprisingly productive day.
Harry remained deadpanned, stood in front of the locked door and looked away, feeling Malfoy's breath on his cheek. He was already in his robes, while Harry wore his ghastly pyjamas he got from Mrs. Weasley in their third year, fitting him still. He didn't know what to respond, he was cornered, he was
Draco's ears reddened in return. "I might as well throw myself to the Black Lake rather than get a full blast of your queerness."
"Potter," a soft hushed tone spoke atop his face and when he brought his blanket off his face, he saw Malfoy glaring but offering his right hand to him, like it was alright to breakdown in Malfoy's arm where he wouldn't judge him for a few minutes.
"It's you!" Draco proclaimed, holding Harry's cloak with one grip and grabbed the stunned Harry on the chest. He kicked Malfoy, fighting to get away but it didn't work, he tried headbanging the blond but it also didn't work because of their height difference. Harry whined as Draco held the front of his pyjama top, then he was suddenly being dragged somewhere.
Harry had a feeling of wanting to roll his eyes, but somehow, thankful for Malfoy being human enough to bring him to the Hospital Wing even though he didn't look like he wanted to. The madam then left after an elf popped in from the door and served Harry fish and chips with some tempting dessert on another plate. When the door had closed, where the Madam just went through, Harry was suddenly aware of the coldness of the Hospital Wing and Draco's sharp stare who had sunken down beside Harry's bed. He brought Malfoy on the exact same bed apparently long ago when Malfoy was wounded.
Harry shivered at the memories of two years ago, clenching his fist as he remembered what he felt during those times he watched Cedric get killed, his friend.
. Hermione, again, told him to go to the Hall and eat. It reminded Harry of Molly Weasley scolding them when he and Ron would talk about Quidditch for hours on end without eating. She never lets them miss complete family meals, especially him who's thin.
“I'd cut the ingredients, you go read and stir the cauldron counterclockwise. Stop dozing off," said Ron.
After a few more bickerings and death threats, the two sauntered together again and let the comfortable silence enveloped them, mostly tired from their yelling and pointless arguments. Harry supposed it wasn't bad except for the torment Draco brought him about his trouser. They rested at the Courtyard for a moment, letting their stomach digest the food and flew on their respective brooms at the Pitch to pass time.
Harry trudged down to the Great Hall after doing his morning routine. As always, he ignored the greetings. This time, the students' stares were oddly longer than usual. Was it because he has crumpled face? Stubble here and there along with the ghastly remarkable bags under his eyes? He knew his body frame was thin, but his schoolmates never minded those, so why were they looking at him weirdly? Harry pursed his lips uncomfortably, determined to ignore everyone, including Ron and Hermione to avoid their daily nags about Harry neglecting his health.
Malfoy was pink all over and Harry laughed forcedly, an attempt to cover his embarrassment of their situation. He was trying to look at the other students' table where Snape was helping some Slytherins juice a couple of lizard's flesh for distraction. In contrast to Malfoy, Harry was flaming red, and it was terrible enough that Malfoy's hand was on him, making him feel conscious despite himself.
Harry snorted. He got his Firebolt from Sirius, and cherished it dearly because it was one of the most important things to him, not because of its price but for the person who gave it to him.
He opened his eyes to see Malfoy standing there, wrestling the door open. Whatever this was, it had temporary forestalled the tension between them.
Catching Malfoy's eyes, he gritted his teeth, which was responded by a quick flinch of Malfoy's upper body after Harry caught it. But to Harry's annoyance, Malfoy easily moved on over the sudden look and was now smirking at Harry, teasing and devious and all the things that make Harry's stomach churn in fury. Harry gritted his teeth instinctively and aggressively stirred in his and Ron's base in the cauldron.
Harry hunkered down immediately and tried to find his glasses first. This never happened before except when Fred and George pranked him while he's asleep back at the Burrows.
so we ended up fighting. It's about the day Malfoy was brought to the Wing - I was the witness of his bleeding after the kid. I did think he was in trouble, but n-no I don't think so. The stab looks self-inflicted, I'm at least seventy percent certain."
It was the oddest two weeks Harry Potter had ever experienced in his life. He was happy, of course, and it was weird enough when who brought him that euphoria was Draco Malfoy.
“Hey, handsome.” She stretched her manicured fingers and trailed it on Harry's shoulders, slowly down to his torso. “Everyone really leaves when it’s Truth or Dare time. You’re one of the late comers, Harry Potter, that means you’re not allowed to leave along with the cowards.”
"... then our last lesson was about extracting remnants of moisture from dead magical creatures in rigor mortis. I believe it's on Page one hundred and ninety, chapter seventeen on the top right corner of the left page, second paragraph, below the introduction. Open the
Harry smiled. He suppose it was amusing. "We both stayed in the Wing for a couple of hours since we got warts. It was itchy."
"Oh, er, this?" Harry plucked the thinnest book off the middle of the stacked books and raised it to Draco's face. They were having a casual talk!
considering for the whole month of November and Harry was in high spirits since the chance was still there.
Hagrid guffawed, rattling half of his house's object. Draco sneaked in a taunting smile at Harry. "Oh! I forgot to tell ye! Ye gotta have
Harry did not talk nor look at Malfoy anymore since it was pointless to complain - especially Gryffindors, to the likes of Severus Snape,
Malfoy sighed and disentangled himself off Harry completely, sitting at the side of the bed. "It wasn't a big deal, Potter. All I can tell you is that
Harry flushed again, mixed with anger and humility. "I can't think of anything to do for you. I don't even know what you want! Plus, I know this conversation is pointless. We might end up killing each other right now - oh
She dislodged herself off of Harry's hand and walked to the middle of the room, clapping her hands to gather everyone’s attention. Some of them were already inebriated, and some still excited.
The blond's eyes shot open, giving Harry the look of speechlessness. The Gryffindor still looked confused and the color of his tanned face was almost as red as the color of their Gryffindor house. It took a moment for the two of them to compose themselves.
"Shut up!" Draco's hand tightened further on a handful of Harry's wrists. The Gryffindor whimpered. "You don't care about me, stop pretending to be so
"Like you with me right now," Harry said softly, "a memory to be grateful of. Irreplaceable, something galleons can't offer you and me."
“I know you hate me, Potter and I really hate you as well. If we could just… Merlin participate well and get this over with, you and I won’t have to suffer. So can you do that?”
"Almost." Harry's eyes narrowed, hand slightly burning at the direct touch of the orange powder he was shoving in the phial with hasty fingers. He hurried up, sliding his eighth phial towards the other finished ones in the hopes of not embarrassing himself in front of Malfoy.
Harry's heart skipped a thunderous beat. He wasn't wrong about his assumption with Blaise. Harry looked down and blushed. He had let the two quiet down first before he explained.
"I don't know what I want," Harry said truthfully and bit on his lower lip. Malfoy followed the movement with his darkened eyes that had been distorted by lust.
Malfoy was on the floor, sitting and bleeding all over. He seemed to have been stabbed right on the side of his stomach with a knife. Who would do this?
They exchanged turns with Harry's Firebolt and Draco, in awe, screamed in glory when he got ahold it, saying he was ready to be a Holyhead Harpies seeker and defeat all the seekers in the world. Harry however, struggled so much with a school-issued Cleansweep five that he had his knees scratched on the ground three times with broken (now mended) glasses, which earned him another set of Malfoy's insulting cackles.
that unfortunate six o'clock, with disarrayed hair and crumpled clothes that had probably made the students arrive at a conclusion they'd been -
"You four-eyed dolt! That doesn't make me gay. And it was a dare made by Abbot! Well you, you seemed to be satisfied moaning like a girl everywhere!"
"Then what is it if you desperately don't want me to be? Am I just your rival forever in your eyes? Damn it, Malfoy, we can't stay irrational for life." Harry ran a hand through his hair. "We're
Harry gulped, swallowing the remnants of his embarrassment before he called Malfoy. When Malfoy turned around, he exploded.
"Yes, Madam Pomfrey," Draco responded, and Madam Pomfrey looked like she patted the boy's head mentally. Harry knew better, because he saw Malfoy clench his fist behind his back, and Malfoy was not too
that distract him from all of his problems. He loves fighting with you! And that's his greatest distraction - I couldn't count how many times Draco mentioned you of how much he hated you - a bit tormenting, really, but
"Well," Harry released his arm off Malfoy's who had finally realized their awkward position, backing away from Harry, "yes," he closed and opened his palm repeatedly to see if it had any problems, and feeling his own skin for a moment, he found none, "thanks."
"Fine!" Harry compensated, grumbling inwardly with defeat. There was something irritating about Malfoy's stubbornness that kept him irrationally mad at him. Harry took a moment to do breathing exercises before speaking as calmly as possible. He looked Malfoy in the eye, not caring if this startled Malfoy to bits because the blond did the same, but a lot more hesitant to let his eyes settle on Harry's, but he did.
Draco glared at Harry first, as if saying he was stupid, before peering his head inside the door again. Harry flinched and instinctively stepped sideways to stay away from Malfoy's personal space.
“I am so sorry I didn’t see you!” Harry said, hands seeking still for his glasses, patting the ground. He had no idea who he bumped with. “I apologize too about my vision, being poorly-sighted is an inconvenience!"
As soon as he flickered his eyes in front of his way, he saw Malfoy's blond head at the far side of the dim room holding a book, flipping the pages with his index and middle finger. He was wearing green silk pyjamas. His posh appearance could never compare to the rugged look Harry had while wearing his baggy pyjamas he got from his cousin Dudley in first year. Draco always stood out with his blond hair.
Hermione's three hours of study time and that's not normal. I didn't think you fell asleep too. I think you passed out from hunger!"
His eyes went farther down, landing on the slightly parted thin lips of Malfoy's. He gulped, remembering
you need to talk to him anyway? Didn't you already talk to us about him? I'm certain he wouldn't appreciate you being casual with him. He hates you so much, you know?"
"What do you think of me, Malfoy?" Harry asked while being drowsy from crying. He might as well ask since Malfoy wasn't too keen of pushing him away. Harry wasn't wearing his spectacles yet he could see the confusion plastered on Draco's face, as to why Harry asked such odd question. They looked at the deepness of each other's eyes for a moment, willing to be lost.
They twisted themselves in an unnatural way, dropped to the floor and swirled their hands in a rhythm that Harry and Malfoy could only do, not caring if they bumped on other students hesitant to form even a small Stinging Hex or shield. Harry was fastly sweating, and could not admit the thrill of the way how aggressive Malfoy was of fighting him. It only took a matter of minutes for Harry and Malfoy to be the center of attraction in the room. After all, they both are
The blond wasn't doing any of Harry's assumptions so far. After a few minutes of a painfully interminable silence, a feathery-light thing had touched Harry's lower lip that made him flick his eyes wide open instantly. Draco was,
Pleased of his plans half-way going well, Harry stood up from his bed instantaneously and scurried off the dorm, not bothering to change and bring his cloak and map which he left a tangled mess on his bedside table.
Malfoy didn't retort further and obliged.  He picked the glass of water Harry was offering him and weakly drank from it, only finishing the half of the content and handed it back to Harry. His eyes immediately closed again, and Harry wiped Malfoy's mouth with the extra dry cloth he found on the table.
Harry opened his eyes for a moment to see what was happening and he saw that he was already laid upon one of the beds in the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey was too quick to maneuver around and Malfoy assisted her well. He couldn't see clearly since Malfoy removed his glasses, along with his shirt under Madam Pomfrey's orders. She wiped his face first, then bare chest, back and arms with cloth soaked in lukewarm water, dabbing him a cooling ointment on the forehead after Harry donned his hospital gown.
"No! I mean... you're still very punchable and annoying in specific moments but," Malfoy paused for seconds as Harry laughed, "like I said, it was fine. Now what I really want is to steal your Firebolt. My father could never buy me something that expensive."
It took three seconds before Draco pushed Harry hard on the chest and the Gryffindor slumped down to the floor, his back slamming to the door before he gasped for a good amount of air.
Malfoy was interested since, he too, seemed like want the fun to last longer. He crossed his arms as his eyes lit with small excitement. "Okay then, what might that be?"
It didn't make Harry feel better. In fact, he thought he was going to be sick thinking of him and Malfoy being sweet and
, and that was established a long time ago. I can’t believe you didn’t complain to her and I can’t believe I’m in this wardrobe with you right now!”
Draco furrowed his brows and Harry's eyes widened, but eventually his lips curved upwards and momentarily, Draco got confused as to why that was Harry's reaction. He flinched when he realized this had something to do with what he said last.
Being up high in his thoughts resulted in a harsh rolled paper being slapped at the back of his neck. He peered past his shoulder to see who did it, eyes twitching from the sting and saw Snape, looming over like a tall building.
Without a warning, Harry stood up from his seat. He drank his tea in one swift gulp, dropping it to the table. He looked rather fidgety.
He saw Draco's eyes glinted with joy through Harry's very awkward sideglancing. Harry swore he saw Malfoy's mouth twitch upwards for a mere second too, valid to be called a genuine smile.
Another week had passed and the flurry of rumors about Harry and Malfoy hushed down completely due to boredom, thankfully - and half of the school no longer believed and listened to it anyway because the students who wanted to catch Harry and Draco in the act had failed to find one of those assumed evidence needed to lead to a cogent title-tattle. Students of all years had been occupied, noses on their thick books and hands numb from writing summaries of their lessons for an easy retention.
The usual rambles of the Hogwarts students could be heard in the air, joyful and overlaying each other's voices as they ate their breakfast, the morning sun hot and welcoming, some owls flying around the hall to deliver their owners' mails. Almost everyone was in a good mood after waking up, rubbing unwanted gounds off their eyes and calling it a good morning. Not until they witness Harry Potter,
dead meat, Potter," were the first words Draco said to him in the Wing, and Harry fought his need to strangle him. "My weekend mornings are supposed to be relaxing, not accompanying a guy attempting to have micronutrient deficiency. And who in hell wears their school robe on weekends?"
they'd die for this either," Blaise commented, his hand did a little flick in the air, speculating his fingers and stared at Harry again. "But, Pansy. That's not what Potter came here for. Don't be
Yes, I have, I have! And it was an accidental one in a pub near Westminster." Ron pursed his lips right after, and the circle exploded to defeaning fit of laughter.
he might as well be killed right now by Voldemort. Harry would let himself be eaten by Nagini. Indecent thoughts were starting to float in his mind with Malfoy in it, and that was not good. Harry might also be staring at the blond longer than usual, furious about their last encounter. Draco was wearing his dark green sweater, eating slowly – slow enough to torture Harry to bits. There was something odd about the way Malfoy licked some food grease off his spoon and how he glance at Harry when he sucks at his bread crumb-covered fingers. He wasn't staring at Harry after anymore, but Harry knows Malfoy was aware of what was Harry thinking as of the moment.
! I was bored the other day and decided ter buy me'self lots of good cookbooks and gave it a go. It was a ruddy mess practicing but I managed. Em glad Malfoy liked me first successful cake. Might as well make the professors."
And Harry was wearing his baggy trousers and t-shirt that made him feel like an utter outcast. Some students wore little to no clothing while he was the only one overly-clothed in a muggle's fashion. All the boys he saw were all half-naked and some of the girls were shamelessly showing their bras and undergarments except Luna who wore a tacky violet and yellow mixed dress that accentuated her difference from the crowd, making Harry's heart pitter-patter.
For thirty minutes, he circulated around the classroom and plucked vials he found, showing it all to Malfoy one by one and made him check what the ingredients were. Harry thought he would do all the work but truthfully, Malfoy only made him paw all the scattered vials off the ground and the blond was the one who mostly arranged it on Snape's shelf. For an hour, they got used to maneuvering around the room.
"Potter." Draco raised two fingers, and Harry narrowed his eyes at the gesture. "How many fingers am I holding?"
Malfoy's eyes squinted in anger. "No. Do you want my help or not, Potter? Your brain couldn't even handle spelling Bubotuber Pus last Wednesday and you think this is unfair? I am doing you a favor."
"We don't think you're fine. You skipped dinner last night again, and I found you studying past bed time, that's
"If you want me to be honest, Potter, I feel baffled," Malfoy said, inclining with Harry's demeanor. He was a lot more poised this time. He was like his father because as far as Harry knew, Malfoys had their presence, a very strong one. "Speaking to you means having my ego thrown to the Black Lake, and I feel like I'm disgracing my family - especially my father."
Harry's whole being trembled as he decided to go back to the room. He was boiling to a certain degree that made him throw himself at Malfoy and punched the smug look off of the blond's face. Malfoy was shocked but he couldn't care less. He
Harry almost jumped, skin tingling from Malfoy's breath on the ridge of his ear. "I wasn't playing," he managed to say, though his voice was all drained. It was surprising that a sound still came out. "I was worried about you because I care for the people around me, even if it has to be you."
“I want to ask you something,” he said, clenching his fist and puffing his chest. He chose the first option, but there was a
Harry grinned, pleased with how he projected himself, like he had control over Draco in even such a small situation. He smiled seeing Draco suddenly quivering in anger.
Harry stretched his legs before he massaged his thumb on his heels as he sat in  McGonagall's office alongside Malfoy on a couch, aware of their close proximity but too occupied thinking about their pending punishment. His bruises hurt, and it was embarrassing to sit beside the boy he just had a row with. The professor offered both of them tea and cookies, but Harry was sure his appetite was forestalled by her intent to stare so he didn’t get one. Harry was ashamed since he was the one who provoked the row between him and Malfoy. He'd never been in her office for good reasons – it was always for detentions.
"Erm - " Harry scratched a patch behind his head. "You want to go eat first? The mashed potatoes are great."
As for Ron, the one who had always been Harry Potter's trusty companion, had his eyebrows furrowed, staring at his best friend who was frowning since they've woken up. To his frustration, Hermione wasn't in the hall with him to check up on Harry together, as she had given her morning time for studying for her extra classes such as Muggle Studies and Arithmancy. His main concern here was that Harry hadn't eaten a single edible thing since dinner last night, ignoring all of his favorite delicacies after a long day of being buried under schoolworks and showing no indications of hunger, which was bothersome. Ron pressed his palm on his face, wanting to scold his best friend who wasn't himself, for days he couldn't count that Harry was barely nibbing on biscuits and sipping on water in Quidditch practices. He was easier to explode as well, too sulky and preferred his alone time for interminably long after classes.
“Yes, the cupboard, my long-term bedroom. I don’t want to elaborate, but you can imagine what I look like there.” Oh yes, he looked really silly in there, being tall and having his feet curved just so he could fit inside.
Harry glared weakly, but he considered the offer. It took him his pride and face to make Malfoy open up like this. After all, he enjoyed tormenting Harry. This was what he wanted, wasn't it? To talk to Malfoy? He turned his head away. He didn't know if Malfoy would make fun of him for his honesty.
And Harry did because his hand was much more important than his dear life. He gasped as his hand started to form an ugly shade of gray wondering how it got that smoke-colored color. He had let Malfoy hold his palm, stroke his whole length of arm for a moment, examine it, before Malfoy murmured a spell, his wand running down the skin, poking softly on the ache of it. Harry was whimpering in pain and was thinking how daft he was for not knowing the sickly-orange powder's identity.
Harry was sure he forgot what sleep was after the constant nightmare he got about Voldemort and his strange visions. Harry was mentally exhausted but never said a word of it to his friends (and has a plan to continue). He was certain about one thing though.
We lost five points!" And Ron responded something like, “How would I handle Harry in the middle of Snape's class? It's bloody risky!"
"'Mione, I'm honestly fine," said Harry, but truth be told in his mind that he was not remotely close to being fine. His Quidditch teammates were outright being too overly-worried of him and offered him to sit down as he guides their practice at the Pitch. Harry found that insulting as their captain.
“Let me guess, Potter. You, couldn't do this," Draco said, causing the whole circle to hoot teasingly. Harry clenched his fist, flustered. He couldn’t believe that his own housemates were cheering and betraying him like this. He apologetically glanced at Luna looking at him with worry before he answered Malfoy.
Draco, deemed not listening to Harry's obvious attempt at normalcy, only gripped Harry's wrist and gently twisted it a bit to see the underside. To Harry's horror, Malfoy found another patch of gray near his elbow - and he was actually listening to Harry since he answered the Gryffindor's earlier question. "I had lessen the heat of the fire, it should slow the process but still would do our brew fine," he said.
He tilted his head further, a bit more heady now as Malfoy's mouth was properly placed on him and started moving his lips against the  soft and thin mounts parting to let Harry's intrusion of tongue. And so he did, his tongue prodding in to the warmth of Draco's pliant and wet mouth. Harry's hand felt restless, confused and almost still defiant to admit the kiss was actually fine, so later on, he snaked his arms around Draco's waist and the blond pressed on him to the wall, their bodies colliding with a soft thud. Harry shuddered when a moan escaped Draco's mouth and he unconsciously copied the sound.
anti-Gryffindor. Harry, disappointed but had more unfortunate situations in his life to be surprised by this, did the honor of casting a low-burning fire on the table and putting the pewter cauldron on top of the heat. Malfoy was doing the same, working and ignoring Harry. Malfoy grabbed the phial of what seems to be a poison off their working table and sniffed it, faintly chanting that identified and separated the ingredients of the poison after. Harry knew it was
Throughout that week, Harry realized that Draco Malfoy just had a way of smoothly forfending his Great Interrogation. As if like a radar, he would easily sense if Harry was stalking him or not and so he was quick to vanish from his sight. This made Harry's mission ten times more impossible knowing Malfoy was aware how desperate Harry wanted to talk to him and to how far could Harry stretch that desperation. It went on and on for days but Harry still had no luck with Malfoy. His desperation was slowly converting to a very concentrated anger and he might resort to binding Malfoy to a chair and shoving a vial of Veritaserum all the way down his throat anytime soon.
disappoint them. They've shown you love when no one else could bring you that affection. At least appreciate their efforts if you can't appreciate yourself."
Harry would've glared if he had the energy, but exerting an effort, he saw Malfoy's eyes momentarily, almost brimming with... no, it can't be worry can it? Harry was annoyed and hungry. It must only be his imagination, or a trick of his own eyes. Harry tried composing himself again (for his ego).
Harry jolted and spilled some of his choco milk at Ron's chest beside him who reenacted what Harry did to Seamus, but with pumpkin juice. Some Ravenclaws who passed by their table chuckled from Hermione's outburst and left comments as they went such as,
which probably meant Malfoy had plans going home a hundred percent. This also meant Malfoy had told Parkinson that Harry Potter invited him to stay at Hogwarts for their break like a dolt. Harry could vividly imagine Draco and Pansy talking about it: Draco wearing his deadpanned face and Pansy squerming for his sake, because she probably thought he and Malfoy now would reconcile and be best of friends.
Harry didn't know how it happened, but he was suddenly pinned down on a bed with both of his hands suffering the restraints of Malfoy's grip with his weight on top of Harry as they kissed passionately. Harry, pleased by how Malfoy's hair looked unkempt again, had ran his hands through the blond strands and rested it there as their tongues fought, Malfoy having the greater and stable control between them. Harry yelped indignantly when the blond withdrew himself from him, still having Harry's arms pinned to the bed.
personal. Harry wasn't exactly a complete sod to harass Malfoy for answers about that ("Malfoy, did you just attempted suicide?" he tried imagining but that would probably lead to a battle better than what happened between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald in 1945). But in any way, he knew Malfoy wouldn't tolerate him, if ever he knew Harry was creating an idea to find him out.
Harry only wanted to spell Malfoy's lips to be bigger for a couple of hours. Malfoy might've misinterpreted the meaning.
Harry groaned, arriving at a quick conclusion of: "You know we can share, right?" which was actually a horrible idea.
Harry was about to respond but chose silence, eating peacefully.  He had let Malfoy stare at him for the sake of supervision. Harry thought the food wasn't stale but he couldn't eat it well since his hands were shaking. Harry heard the blond wince at his state, and honestly, he couldn't blame Malfoy. Who would want to spend their Saturday in the presence of their enemy anyway?
. He caught a glimpse of Theodore Nott first, then Pansy Parkinson holding her wand out, conjuring her flamingo patronus, probably showing off to Millicent Bulstrode. Next he saw, Malfoy who was openly staring at him too.
Malfoy's smile up to his eyes, slowly transformed into a soft and questioning frown that Harry wasn't familiar with. His eyes' expression toned down, looking a lot more confused of Harry's reaction and of Harry's concerned expression for him. "You're serious, aren't you? You're... concerned of my being?"
He stood outside the Entrance Hall after eating, back propped on the wall and eyed everyone who went out, waiting for Parkinson or Zabini. When a group of Slytherins came out next, he saw Draco among them and craned his neck if Pansy and Blaise were too, and they weren't. After a few more students fled out, they finally popped out of the door.
Draco Malfoy was at the seventh floor across the tapestry, stopping for seconds before his name vanished along with his dots.
A couple of the hissing Scurras, green as leaves and thick as normal snakes in their leafy body slithered up to Harry's legs and encircled it. Harry giggled at the ticklish sensation as he watched Malfoy's face at the same time, who was completely dazed by the sight, who also might have forgotten the ability to breathe. "Potter, you really are a freak!" he commented a breathy sentence.
Harry clutched on Malfoy tighter, whole body feverishly hot as Draco kept playing with his arse. When he seemed to be bored of it, he slapped the two plumpy soft cheeks with both of his hands. Harry swore the ring would've created a temporary dent on his skin there. He yelped, punching Malfoy reflexively on the chest from shock. No one slapped his arse before like this. Not that it felt good.
for a while to see if you would need an extra day here or if you could be discharged in a few hours. Five points to Slytherin, Mr. Malfoy. Your knowledge in smelling sickness helped me to know what procedure I should do faster than usual. Very good!"
Admittedly, it was Harry's fault for expecting in the first place. He never knew Malfoy in a very intimate level before. He might've played Harry for a fool and Harry didn't know that. He didn't know what horror did Malfoy think in every way possible.
That included Malfoy, who was standing the opposite of him, crossing his arms and like the crowd, he was staring at him too, but too much like he was some dirt. Harry squinted, confused and had the sudden urge to coil further on his seat.
Malfoy was right, he was being dumb and irrational but it was flowing from him naturally and he had lost the control to stop himself from lashing out. "I don't know why I'm mad at you for ignoring me. It used to be better for my peace when you fucked off. Now I don't want you gone!" Harry growled. "I want you as my friend and now you don't want to let me after all that?"
Harry murmured a protective charm and finished separating the ingredients, ignoring the blond's continuous complaints who had no choice but to get back to their cauldron. Malfoy seemed like he wanted to fly off the room just to avoid Harry's questions because he was chopping and extracting extra fast, making sure Harry would have a reason to keep his mouth shut, so he did. There was no way Harry could raise a fight against Malfoy's walls.
Harry couldn't help but observe that Malfoy's eyes could be the most beautiful gray pupils Harry had seen if he wasn't so antisocial and on the run to his hidden agenda that made him look so ominous. His cheeks were flushed, and it really shows due to the paleness of his skin. His face would be much more bright if it wouldn't glare and snarl at people all the time.
"You're on the brink of dying yet you're still thinking about your deep-rooted hatred towards me?" Harry grimaced and held the urge to start another World War since Malfoy was genuinely wounded.
Harry closed his eyes again and drew in a deep breath, feeling dizzy. "Before I drift off to oblivion. I just want to say you're a fucking piece of prat, Malfoy."
Harry lent his palm as the Healer handed him the phial. She squeezed his shoulder affectionately before scurrying and vanishing behind the large door, leaving Harry alone with a peacefully-asleep Draco Malfoy. He sighed, without a choice strode towards the side of Malfoy's bed and did all what was told.
"Oh, ye don't need ter pay me. I can bake ye, Harry, Hermione and Ron lots anytime ye lot want it. I gotta try making the cupcakes soon.
Harry looked at her and the warmth spreading in his heart wasn't prevented by his obvious depression. Harry wouldn’t know what to do without them, Ron and Hermione. He was always lost without their guidance and support. Just now, he wasn't able to show it since the growing emptiness within him was overpowering his whole being.
Ron was the one who answered him. “Y'know the gathering and all that of the four houses without drinking. But knowing Gryffindors, they'd sneak a few in. It will start this Saturday." Ron sighed, not liking the idea. "God, if I'm just not allowed to go, I wouldn't."
Both of them gazed sharply at each other for a moment before nodding at the professor simultaneously.
"I think my shin bumped on something sharp." Malfoy rolled his hips uncomfortably and that created some
"Potter," Pansy croaked, "you know, he didn't tell the both of us either about his stab. We tried to seek some answers as well. He kind of... shrugged us off and we didn't want to force him to tell us if he didn't want to. Were you that worried?"
Draco's face twisted, a face that said he was either forcing himself to agree or was just having a bad day of stomachache. Harry already got his answer based from it.
Draco pinned him to the wall, gritting his teeth as he aimed his other clenched fist on Harry's chin, hands pressed tightly on Harry's chest. "Potter, first of all, what the
, it was necessary since you won't stop talking. My mates could walk in on us like this at any second, you know, they don't know privacy." Knowing his friends, especially Seamus and Dean, they won't be able to shut up about it. The words would've been around the rest of the school like some gospel before he had the chance to stop them.
All of Harry's classes were finished on that particular Thursday afternoon, having a headache and most of it was caused by the "plague". He went ahead to the Hall and saw Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson inspecting him from their table like he was some lab rat, with Malfoy beside them being the only person not looking his way, too intent to stare at his afternoon mashed potato. Harry ignored them. After all this time, he admits - despite all the monstrosity of the rumors that had gone on for the whole dreadful week, risking his face from the
"Put the separated ingredients of this poison into ten different phials," said Malfoy without looking at his partner. It was probably the first sentence Malfoy had said to Harry in two weeks aside from the cusses he throws at Harry on a daily basis. Harry obeyed his order, leaving the mixing-and-checking-the-cauldron duty to the Slytherin who was observably adept with doing his job, barely checking their brewing instructions off the book waded between the table which Harry couldn't deprive himself to do. Harry stared with faint awe, but he didn't make it obvious. He didn't want Malfoy to have a theory that Harry
Harry looked at Malfoy's face right after he said that to confirm it was fine, chewing his lower lip harshly it almost bled. And he saw it. The glint of excitement in Draco's eyes, mixed with fear, hesitation and confusion.
, closing the gap between them, dangerously looming over Harry's smaller figure. Watching Harry freeze from shock, he pressed himself on Harry's body
Pansy continued, her smile faltering at the sight of Harry's expression, "On the other hand, Potter, for those rational enough to attempt and debunk the truth, no one knows about the room that's not supposed to be closed in McGonagall's office - they'd say you made that story up to cover for the secret make-out session. Trust me."
"Potter, you won't gain anything from this, even if I told you," Malfoy said, looking at Harry's eyes thoughtfully
" he hissed at the Scurras who hugged his leg and watched them hiss simultaneously, crawling back to their hole beneath Hagrid's hut. After, Harry half-dragged, half-pulled Malfoy to the house who was deliberately making himself heavier. Hagrid, hands still shaking, still opened the door as what he originally intended to do and beamed at the two of them, a steaming pot of boiling tea in his hand.
"Potter!" said Pansy, arriving and smiling. Blaise only nodded at him and Harry returned the gesture. "Come with us to the Common Room."
“So,” Pansy continued. “I got this Truth or Dare game from a muggle friend of mine, and the rules are really simple: when the bottle lands on you, you will be the person who’d ask, “Truth or dare?” to the person who got the second spin of the bottle pointed on that person, then if you obliged diligently, then you can spin the bottle next and ask away. The cycle continues. You are to obliged to follow because you’d be punished if not. I asked dear Granger from Gryffindor myself to put a curse on someone who won’t be successful of doing their task. Dear Granger is a smart witch and deadly skilled at Charms, just a reminder. She won’t make it easier for us if we cheat or back out.”
It was nighttime, specifically two hours before their curfew. Harry was soaked in sweat beside a similarly drenched Malfoy on the edge of the fountain, took a moment to glance at Malfoy that was moments ago up above the dim star-sprinkled night sky. He wanted to say something like,
about Draco," said Blaise, and Harry's ears reddened. He had a feeling Blaise was someone good at observing others.
It was an awkward and breath-constricting session in Defense. Harry didn't know how to deal with a much more pliant and coy Malfoy that stood before him, barely managing to point his Hawthorn at Harry like a first year student in front of a boggart and Draco kept looking down at a tiny dust that was on Harry's shoe, tint of pink appearing constantly on his pale face. All that more-awkward situation made Harry's stomach lurch in anger that he declared he won't go easy with Malfoy, and gladly, Malfoy seemed to get back on his self and sneered at Harry again temporarily before going back to the avoiding-each-other thing.
