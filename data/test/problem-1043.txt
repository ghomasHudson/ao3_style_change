He cleared his voice. “Charming indeed. Is it difficult, Dean? To charm pictures I mean? Could you create an Imagic for example?”
“Alright he is,” was the answer. Pale hands with freakishly long fingers planted three glasses in front of Harry with so much force the butterbeers spilled over. “Enough said.”
Which made Harry chuckle and soon enough they were grinning at each other like madmen. This was embarrassing and fantastic at the very same time. Harry ruffled his hair and managed to say, “Well, you wanna come in for a second? Or shall we just go to the hall early?”
The House-elf appeared with the usual crack and bowed deeply. “Kreacher at your service! How can Kreacher please Master Harry Potter Sir?”
“I see your point, Ms Granger.” Flitwick gave in and Harry marvelled at Hermione’s ability to challenge Flitwick’s opinion.
Harry nodded. He felt deeply uncomfortable about Josh’s further enquiries of the interaction between tracking spell and Polyjuice Potion… Kingsley needed to know and it better be Josh who delivered the message or the young Auror might be in even more trouble.
“Good evening, Professor,” he said, “I just promised to come again soon. It’s really nice to be back.” He smiled at her and was rewarded with a miniature smile in return.
“Fuck you! Stop calling me a superhero once and for all! And about me being gay – Cass told you weeks ago, didn't she? So you better get used to it!” Harry was outraged.
They walked towards their table side by side when she added, “I’m sorry, Harry. Please don’t hold it against me that I – you know…“
For the next few days Harry’s attention was torn between school and worry. The Headmistress still insisted on Harry’s presence during lessons but kept him informed of any progress in the investigations. Not that there was much progress. Taurus Malfoy was supposedly still on the run, Laddley still unconscious. McGonagall had once again asked Harry, Blaise and Tommy to take care of the swimming lessons, which was at least something Harry enjoyed. Focusing on the needs of younger students gave Harry some hours free of worries.
“Oh Merlin, that’s horrible,” Harry said. Watching a toddler die, unable to help – the sheer idea of it seemed to put even the many deaths he had seen into perspective.
He stood in the corridor just outside of the door, clutching the railing hard and sighed heavily. The train rocked and rattled as they were making their way up north. Harry heard his friends’ animated voices from behind the door but couldn’t understand a word. So they finally knew he was gay. He felt relieved – mostly. And maybe a bit nervous. Ginny had guessed all along and Hermione also didn’t seem totally surprised. Ron would come around as well. Ron adored his gay brother Charlie and even had admitted to fancying Josh himself as a kid – his best mate wouldn’t abandon Harry for being gay, he was sure of it.
“Ms Quotation and Prince Charming, my I have your attention please?” Harry jumped in to prevent yet another Granger-Weasley bickering duel. He knew from years of experience, that his friends would go on like that for hours, if he didn’t interfere. “For whatever reason we make different progress, at least there is some progress at all. Let’s stick to our plan and write down what we have learned so far.”
“… I’d also be content,” Draco finished Harry’s sentence with a lopsided grin, “Sorry, Potter, can’t help it – I actually approve of what you say.”
Harry’s heart sank at the sight of her companion.
Snape’s Imagic raised one eye-brow and Harry knew that he wasn’t fooled for a second.
Harry gulped.
“Quiet please,” Flitwick cried, “In exactly three weeks Halloween celebration will start with an afternoon tea party for all students at five p.m. followed by a festive dinner at seven. After dinner fourth to eighth-year students are invited to stay at the great hall for the ball, younger students will spend the evening at their respective common rooms.” Disappointed sighs and much grumbling from three tables made clear, how the younger students felt about that.
“Where did you learn to do that? Did Flitwick teach that last year, while I was on the run?” Harry asked.
“Oh, well,” Draco said looking at his sleeves, “at least it doesn’t hurt. Nice colour, Hermione, although it’s rather yours than mine.” He smiled at her.
“Come off it! What’s the matter with you? You make it sound as if I were teacher’s pet!”
“But you love us none the less,” Ron said embracing his girlfriend and planting a smack on her cheek, which made everybody laugh.
Laddley resumed giving lessons, the official explanation for his short absence being, that he had been ill. And Harry continued to attend swimming classes as he had promised the Headmistress to do. He did not particularly enjoy being around Laddley of course, but he enjoyed swimming – and he also felt obliged to protect the younger students by watching Laddley’s behaviour closely.
Flitwick turned around and said, “Good thinking, Mr Potter! Your defence skills are really extraordinary!” Then he was gone.
“I’ll walk with you, if you don’t mind,” Cass said, “I’m curious about that bird, Aunt Cissy says he’s a bit of a clown?”
“What are they playing?” asked Ron before Hermione nudged him in the ribs.
.” Hermione fell in and both girls grinned at each other.
“I’m afraid I have to insist, Mr Malfoy. This is a matter of safety, I have to make sure every eighth-year is able to master the Patronus spell,” he said with finality and beckoned to Draco.
Harry wondered. Narcissa had not mentioned her son, neither in her invitation nor while walking through the grounds.
“Quiet, please!” she shouted. “I am well aware that this comes as a surprise, but I assure you, it will do you good – and us as well.” She sighed before she finally started to introduce the new members of staff.
She gave both Hermione and Ron a meaningful glance. The two of them looked mortified. Harry grinned to himself. Obviously it wasn’t easy to hide anything from the Headmistress.
Hermione looked at Harry with determination. “Right. Let’s take stock, ok? On the plus side – we have three Imagics back. We know that Taurus Malfoy is the main perpetrator, we know about his means and motive. Laddley was probably his accomplice but has been knocked off before he could own up to it.”
Ron gawped at Draco but Hermione smiled knowingly at Harry and said, “Right you are, Draco!”
Just a short while later they both stepped out of the Guest House. Harry led the way to a group of tall trees in the middle of the lawn, which seemed like an outpost of the Forbidden Forest. That’s where he stopped, pulled his wand and pointed it at the lawn in front of them.
“Why are you telling me all of this?” Harry suddenly asked with feeling, “It is a horrible story and I feel terrible about it, but none of this is my fault! I knew nothing about it! Up until today I didn’t even know Cass exists!”
“Hush, off you go,” Neville said to Blaise, “I’ve got to concentrate, if I want to win that one. Why don’t you ask our nutcase musician to play the piano for us?”
“I guess so! I’m pretty sure her Ladyship could tell because the copy was created at Hogwarts – we would just have to fetch your book and show it to her!”
Harry stared at the picture. Three girls were looking at him, obviously sisters. Two of them were dark haired, the middle child was blonde. Although their features were very much alike, their expression was not.
Following an impulse Harry opened the door to the common room, instead of going downstairs right away.
“Actually, yes… deputy Headmaster Flitwick has asked to see you after breakfast at his office… Ms Granger and Mr Weasley are also welcome.” The Imagic smirked, “I think Filius has taken an even stronger liking to Ms Granger since she has told him about her research. I got the impression that he now has a serious grudge against the Sorting Hat, for not putting her in Ravenclaw.”
face near the pool anymore– or anywhere else for that matter!” Harry shouted.
“Let’s not exaggerate,” Severus Snape corrected, ”at the first of September 4047 magical paintings were stored at the Ministry archives and with good planning and joint efforts we have managed to check them all – he’s not there. An Imagic can only visit other magic paintings at the same vicinity or…”
Harry’s stomach clenched and he gulped. “No, no… of course not. Just asking… Ginny is… she is like a sister to me. I don’t want her to get hurt, that’s all.”
When Harry and Ron gave their report of this morning’s visit at the village, their audience seemed unimpressed. Hermione of course already knew what had happened, but the members of staff did not look convinced at all, although Harry insisted on the importance of a previous conflict between Lucius Malfoy and Gregory Laddley.
Harry thought.
Their secret connection was broken.
Draco snorted and shook his head. “That is so totally not my point… quite the contrary in fact, I’ve been with plenty of guys… in a purely sexual way of course. To be honest, I’ve been a proper slut.”
“Exactly, me neither. So – as soon as Slughorn was transformed, I felt sick as hell and the tracker went baloney. When he changed back, I was okay again and so was the tracker.”
Again Harry was surprised by Aberforth’s looks of good health and openness. The end of the war and maybe his involvement in the battle against the dark side of magic had done him good apparently.
Whenever the terrible itch of his healing skin kept Harry awake at night, he could not help wondering… if Draco quite simply did not
“Yeah, I can see that, Josh being great with kids,” Harry said. “He adores Teddy and sure knows how to handle a baby, cuddling and stuff. But… how come you guys seem to know so much about him? I didn’t even know that he’s Lee Jordan’s cousin until he told me!”
to agree with our values and principles without actually sharing them, this will not do. I need to trust my staff and I cannot trust you, if I know you to be prejudiced and ignorant about essential human rights. Because this is at the core of the matter – the belief humans are equals no matter what. Whether Muggle, Witchard or Squib, whether female, male or any other gender, whether black, white or any other skin colour, whether heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual… just everyone.”
Draco couldn’t believe it. Potter had not only survived the first trial, but had done so in such a spectacular fashion that the whole school wouldn’t shut up about it. Now, as the day of the Yule Ball drew closer, all his classmates wanted to gossip about was who Potter would take as his date. Draco huffed out a sigh, his chin in his hand as he stared into the flames crackling in the grate. It was getting late, and the common room was quiet except for the murmur of small conversations in tucked away corners. Here, now, Draco could think in peace.
“So what if he’s a pouf?” Malfoy asked, and Harry was surprised to hear that he was being sincere. He heard a couple of loud groans from the other boys.
“I know, I know,” he said wearily. “But you know the court will pull this case apart, what with…”
Harry stood in the doorway, leaning against the frame with his arms crossed and a feeling of contentment spreading through his chest. Here was his family – all wearing Molly’s knitted jumpers, some more reluctantly than others, and passing around plates of homemade pies and fudge. Teddy looked up from where he and Victoire were playing Exploding Snap and squealed at the sight of his godfather. Harry kneeled down as Teddy barrelled straight through to him, jumping eagerly into Harry’s open arms.
Parkinson went white as a sheet. The others in his group looked at each other, sizing each other up. Some of them shifted their grip on their cricket bats nervously. A few took off, but most of them stayed, ready to take on the entire football team if need be. Parkinson seemed to gain some confidence back seeing this. His lip curled at Harry.
“Go to sleep, Malfoy.”
“Teddy?” Malfoy asked, brow furrowed.
Harry tried to bury himself in Draco, his arms around Draco’s back as he held onto his shoulders, his leg wrapped around Draco’s hip. Draco sighed. He was just about to give up on getting an answer from him when he heard Harry whisper,
Draco smirked. “The flower cup is the best cup,” he said, half to himself, “but this is perfect. Thank you.”
Draco reached up and gave the owl a gentle scratch on the back of its head. “How about we call you Scorpius?” he asked it with a half-smile. The owl, now realising that it was not going to get a decent rest with the two of them fawning over it, blinked at Draco with a satisfied hoot.
“No reason,” Draco mumbled. “I’m glad you like the book.”
“Overheard it from one of my patients, an Auror that had gotten into a bit of a scrape. Her visitor was another Auror, McKinley or something like that. Anyway, she asked him why Potter couldn’t take over her case, and this McKinley or whatever said that Potter’s handed in his notice. Imagine my surprise!”
Harry scrambled over to his side of the room, diving onto his bed and picking up Draco’s gift and opening it at random to hide his flaming face. He pulled his knees up in hopes that whoever it was wouldn’t notice the semi in his trousers. Draco looked frantically from his bed to his desk, decided on the latter, and sat down in his desk chair, pulling himself close to the desk and pretending to be looking at his phone. He cleared his throat and called, “Come in.”
Harry shrugged as he climbed on top of him. “I can live with that.”
Harry gave him a small smile. “It’s okay,” he said. “Just knowing you’re here is something.”
“Trust me, I’ll explain everything,” Malfoy hissed, his voice hoarse, his eyes darting about the street. “Just – not here. Where’s the bloody house?”
“Thanks, Hermione,” he whispered, voice still thick from the swallowed tears. “You’re the best.”
“You sure?” Harry asked. Draco nodded. Harry beamed up at him and proceeded to half-drag Draco up the stairs to the master bedroom.
“Not my type, but okay,” he grumbled. He sighed and stepped away from Draco to pinch the bridge of his nose, leaning against the island beside his husband. Teddy sat back, his expression a mix of triumph at proving his point and the embarrassment of even making the point in the first place. Harry rubbed his chin. He needed a shave. “Right, well, you don’t have to tell her like that. She’s probably going to ask, but still – you like her, don’t you?”
He went to the only person he knew would have all the answers – Hermione. Harry stepped through the fireplace straight into her arms. Harry held her close, breathing in the smell of her floral perfume, magnolia and jasmine. She sat him down on the threadbare couch she and Ron had found on the side of the road, brought him a cup of strong tea and a plate of biscuits, the gingersnap ones he liked. He mumbled through his thanks, not entirely trusting his voice. Hermione just smiled and sat next to him, hands folded in her lap. There was a hole in the toe of her black stockings. Harry focused on that, knowing that if he looked Hermione in the eye, he would fall apart.
“You still live at the townhouse?” Harry asked, his lips brushing Draco’s ear. Draco nodded. He turned and pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple. “Take me there,” Harry murmured. “Please.”
“And Ginny Weasley?” Draco demanded, trying to pull away. “You want her too?”
“Most of my friends are snogging each other,” he said, his words slurring together even as he tried to articulate. “And Luna just read my future… or my life… she read my palm.”
He knew then, as Harry’s rumbling chuckle filled his ears, that it didn’t matter that his body couldn’t, wouldn’t work the way he wanted it to. This was enough. Draco was enough for Harry. He wrapped his arms around Harry and settled against him with a shaky sigh. This was more than enough, because this was love.
“Oh. I didn’t realise you had guests,” said Malfoy, his voice still thick with sleep. He cleared his throat and walked over to Kellen, holding out his hand for her to shake. “Hello, I’m Draco Malfoy. Pleasure to meet you.”
Harry snorted into his coffee. “Well, I figured Teddy would be a good litmus test, you know, if he didn’t like him then that would be the final word on that.”
The king raised his head, a slightly panicked look in his distant eyes. Harry stifled a shiver, and wondered if perhaps he had overstepped. But then the king blinked, and he seemed to return to himself once more. He straightened up, lifting his chin as he turned to his attendant.
“Why not?”
“Er, Kellen? Could you leave the Pensieve here tonight? I’ll send it back in the morning.”
“I don’t want to lose you again, either,” Draco said in answer to Harry’s unspoken question. “Plus, I’m pretty sure Pansy would kill me if I said no.”
“What was that?” she asked, shouting over the din of the pub. They sidestepped a particularly rambunctious group of Hufflepuffs, edging towards the balcony with Blaise at their heels.
“Are you alright?” she asked, wavering in the doorway to the kitchen. “Do you need some air?”
magically bonded relationship’.”
When Harry didn’t respond immediately, Draco pulled back, an apology already half out of his mouth. But then Harry’s lips were crashing into his. Harry’s hand was on the back of his neck, pulling him in close as he scrambled onto Draco’s lap, letting go of Draco’s hand so that he could hold Draco’s head in his. The kiss was messy, too much teeth, all hot panting breaths as they tried to renegotiate themselves, Harry barely letting Draco pull away to adjust their positioning, so desperately did he cling to him. Draco grinned against his mouth, hoisted Harry up as he moved back on the couch so that Harry could straddle his hips properly without falling off, couldn’t stop grinning as Harry eagerly began sucking hickeys down Draco’s neck. He didn’t care what his colleagues would say at the bank tomorrow, he’d wear them proudly.
“A Harry sandwich?”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. He pressed a finger to his lips, shaking his head. Harry found himself lost for words, drowning in a wave of emotions he couldn’t process fast enough – relief, anger, confusion, fear. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm – bony, but there, real and warm in his grip.
Harry laughed. “She says that about everyone,” he reassured the boy. “Just avoid the mistletoe, apparently that attracts them.” He brushed Teddy’s hair back with his hand. Teddy had changed it to match Harry’s black curls, but as he grew older, he reminded Harry more and more of Remus. His heart squeezed at the thought of the man who should be there, of all the people who should be there with them – Sirius, Tonks, Fred… Teddy frowned and patted Harry’s cheek with a pudgy hand.
“Not dying, for starters.”
Not for the first time, Harry thought of his parents. How he would like to see them, one last time. To hear their voices, feel their arms around him, know what they smelled like – did his mother wear scented oils, did his father smell of woodsmoke and leather like Sirius or of parchment and sugar like Remus? He closed his eyes. Even Death, it seemed, waited for him to speak.
“I’m sorry,” he said as he stood over his luggage. “I didn’t know about your parents.”
“I….” Harry caught himself. It wasn’t his truth to tell, he told himself. As always, though, he needn’t have bothered.
The perfume and earrings were greatly appreciated. Narcissa had gotten Draco a pocket watch that also told the phases of the moon, which Draco marvelled over. Harry nervously plucked the tissue paper out of the bag and reached in. He let out a bark of laughter.
“To be fair, that was your father he got into a fight with, not you,” Harry pointed out. Then, choosing his words carefully, he added, “And you’re not your father, Draco. Give the Weasleys a chance to get to know you, and I’m sure they’ll like you well enough.”
“W-What?” Draco stammered. He tried to make out the dark profile of the priest through the latticed grate, had to wipe away the tears blurring his vision.
Narcissa smiled at her son, and, letting go of his sleeve, gestured for them to sit back down. As they sat, she called for Wilkins and told him to grab their gifts. The house elf disappeared with a crack, only to return a few moments later with a box and a gift bag, which he handed to Harry and Draco. With another crack, Wilkins disappeared again, returning almost instantaneously with Narcissa’s gifts.
“Is that a promise?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Ooo, so original.”
me! Go on, admit it!”
Hermione, who had just come in through the portrait hole, leaned around the stack of books she was carrying and noticed Harry and Draco standing there, holding hands and looking sheepish. “Oh! Well done, you two!” she said with a weary smile. “Took you long enough.” When Dean called her name again, she swivelled towards him, nearly sending the top few books flying.
“Harry?” They were getting closer now.
“Come, I will show you.”
“Why did you kiss me?”
Draco shifted to face Harry better. He reached out and put his hand on Harry’s knee, but unlike Harry, he kept his hand there. He took a deep breath to steady himself.
The hand holding Malfoy’s wand shook. His eyes darted from Harry’s open palms to the wand at his feet like a cornered animal, waiting for the gun to be drawn. Myrtle came in between them. She raised her arms as if to shield Malfoy from Harry’s sight.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted him, leaning forward and cupping Draco’s cheek with one hand. “I love it. Thank you.” He kissed him, sweet and chaste, before pulling away and wiping his eyes with his sleeve. “This makes my gift look stupid in comparison,” he added in a low mumble, gesturing at the bag in front of Draco for him to open it and blushing slightly. Draco pressed his lips into a fine line as if to hold back a comment.
“Leave it at home, sir, I know,” he said.
the one who gets dragged to the Headmaster’s office? Do you have any fucking idea how that sounds?”
Draco blinked again, and they were standing on the Astronomy Tower, eighteen and exhausted. Potter ran a hand through his hair, the curls growing if possible more wild than before. Draco wondered if his hair was soft and fine, like his, or thick and coarse, tangling around his fingers. He clenched his fists surreptitiously, digging his bitten nails into his palms to ground himself.
“Same. Maybe we could just stay here forever. It’d be fine.”
“Draco Malfoy? You’re dating that little fucker?” Ron bellowed. His face bypassed red and went straight to puce. “After everything’s he’s done?”
“Sir?” Harry protested, sitting up. Dumbledore gestured for him to be patient.
The balcony was screened off from the rest of the flat by a filmy curtain. Harry was so set on getting outside that he hadn’t stopped to think if there would be anyone else out there. He wrenched open the sliding glass door and froze. He’d know that white blond hair anywhere.
“Huh. Sounds posh. Mine was a Christmas gift after Eddie and I broke up last year. Ron got it because it says ‘FCUK Him.’”
The chaise lounge smelled heavily of mildew, and the wall below the window had taken severe water damage. Guilt ran through Harry like a chill as he realised it was because he hadn’t closed the window properly last time. He slung his rucksack over his shoulder again and looked around. The drawing room was empty, dust motes floating in the sunbeams sneaking through the boarded windows.
The tears pricked at Draco’s eyes again, but he blinked them away.
Fourteen years later, a familiar face stood in the doorway to his lab, holding a file aloft like an olive branch.
“Are you doing anything this evening?”
“Oh, really?” Harry grinned. “Do tell.”
Draco looked up in surprise. “Really?” he asked. His eyes lit up. “You’ll meet them?”
?” he hissed. “Your family name is
Harry laughed. “Alright, I’ll send him an owl. I should go, anyway, do adult things around the house like laundry and all that.” He stood shakily. Hermione got up and gave him one last hug. She watched him go, returned his wave as he stepped through the flames. The minute he was gone, she summoned her purse and ran off to the library. Research called.
This was not the most romantic speech Harry would ever give, but Draco still found himself falling. He closed the distance between them, grey eyes fixed on green, and, cupping Harry’s jaw in his hands, he kissed him.
“Well, at least we’ve told them. Have you told your friends?” Harry asked pointedly. Draco frowned. “Oh come on, after all that earlier and you haven’t told your friends?” Harry threw up his hands as Draco looked away. “Merlin’s tits, Draco! Seriously?”
“Wotcher, Harry.”
“You have no idea.”
“Like I said. Didn’t mean anything.”
“Fair enough,” Harry said, “but I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t hesitate to jinx Malfoy, whereas with you and me he didn’t have a choice, he had to be civil.”
“It’s… difficult,” he admitted. “I… I don’t know what to do, anymore. Where do I go from here?” He looked up at Potter, as if maybe, maybe this man who had been through so much worse than him, who had survived, would know, would understand. He looked up at Potter in desperate hope and asked, “What do I do now?”
“Harry?”
They stared at each other for too long, drinking in each other like men dying of thirst. Malfoy lifted his chin. Still proud, even after all these years.
It was over before Harry could process what happened. Draco pulled back, already trying to move out of Harry’s arms, already stammering, “I shouldn’t have done that, Merlin, I must be going mental – ” But Harry didn’t give him a chance to finish. He pulled Draco in for another kiss and didn’t let go.
Draco, surprised, nodded. Harry smiled, gave his arm another squeeze before his hand dropped away and he stepped back. Draco swayed slightly, as if Harry’s hand on his arm was the only thing keeping him upright.
“Hey. Hey, look at me.”
on the way here?”
Harry nodded. He knew the feeling. “How about we take this one step at a time? Let’s get you freshened up, and as much I hate to say it, out of my bathrobe.” Draco chuckled at this, and Harry’s heart skipped. “We can go down to breakfast if you want, or I can have one of the house elves bring something up. I have some work to do, but if you want, we can just… talk. Or sleep. Or none of the above. Whatever you want.”
Draco opened his mouth, closed it again. He wanted to say that he had. He’d had plenty of one night stands – the bartender inside could attest to that – but in reality they were drunken fumbles, scratching an itch. There hadn’t been anything real for so long. Not since…
“But?”
“Since Hallowe’en is on a Tuesday this year,” Hermione explained, her frizzy curls escaping from her bun, “the prefects thought that it would be fun for each Year Group to have a party in their common room to help build inter-House unity!”
“You know what, I don’t have a good explanation for that. Crusts off it is.”
“But…” Harry leaned forward and hissed under his breath, “This is a Muggle café.”
“I think I love you too, Draco,” he said. He sat up to lean his forehead against Draco’s, their noses brushing. “I love you so much,” he murmured. Draco’s heart sped at the words, and he grinned stupidly, even as Harry pulled him into another, deeper kiss.
“For one thing, she didn’t curse me,” Harry pointed out. Draco shrugged. Harry raised an arm in invitation, and Draco, toeing off his shoes, climbed into bed next to Harry, snuggling up against him as Harry pulled him into his side. “And I do need a new pair of socks,” Harry added thoughtfully. Draco turned into Harry’s chest to hide his smile.
“I don’t get it!” he said for the fiftieth time. He and Hermione were in a quiet corner of the library, where Hermione had built herself a nest of books and rolls of parchment. She only allowed Harry’s presence because he was meant to be proof-reading one of an endless number of essays she had to write. But this also meant she got an ear-full of Harry’s whispered tirade against Draco’s sudden cold shoulder. “I thought we were finally getting to be mates, and now he won’t even look at me! He’s so dramatic, honestly, I don’t get it.”
The attendant gasped, horrified, and Harry jumped slightly. He had forgotten about the other elf. But King Draco only scoffed and again waved his hand, silencing the attendant’s indignation.
, let’s just talk,” Ron sneered. “Let’s just talk about how you sent my brother to bloody Azkaban!”
“Of course,” Draco murmured, pressing his lips to Harry’s forehead. “I’m off in a few hours. You going to be okay?”
Harry shrugged. For a long while, they held each other, so tangled together that they were like two trees that had grown together, bodies and roots, breathing in time with the rise and fall of the other’s chest. Then,
“I’m honoured that you told me,” Draco said, smiling warmly at him. “It means a lot, you know.”
He didn’t think. He just wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and hugged him tight, his face buried against the other man’s chest. Draco froze. He held the spoon he was using to stir the pasta suspended in mid-air for a moment. Harry was just about to let go and step away, apologise, say he didn’t know what came over him, when there was the clatter of the spoon against the counter and Draco’s arms were around him, holding him close.
Draco looked down at the gifts in his hands, then smiled sheepishly at Harry. “Er, no. Not exactly.”
“I am the king, you know,” Draco sneered, looking up darkly. “I should be the one calling the shots.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco’s shoulders relax a little. Kellen said goodnight and, followed by Humphries back in human form, disappeared into the flames. The minute they were gone, Draco crumpled. Harry pulled him into his arms. The angle was awkward, and Harry doubted it was at all comfortable for Draco, but neither of them said a word. Draco pressed his forehead against the crook of Harry’s neck, his breath tickling the hollow of his throat. After a long silence, Draco whispered one word – “Arrangements.”
Draco winced and muttered under his breath, “Can we please stop using his name?” Harry couldn’t hear him over the blood roaring in his ears.
He went quiet. Harry turned his head into Draco’s chest to press a kiss against his collarbone, a gentle reassurance. Draco kissed the top of his head in kind. When he continued, his voice was barely above a whisper.
Potter groaned.
“I got my exam results!” he exclaimed. “And I got in!”
you’ve already met.”
?” he demanded. Everyone, including Harry and Draco, looked at him pityingly.
But what if Lovegood was right? the Poet insisted. Confess your feelings, and let truth win out!
Five minutes passed. Then ten. Draco began to get fidgety. More and more people filled the atrium, off to start their days. Some gave him strange looks, but most ignored him. Draco took out a Knut, flipped it with his thumb into the fountain, made a wish. A strange, panicked thought popped up in his mind – what if Harry had gone to get the other Aurors to arrest him? For what – he didn’t know, he’d been a law-abiding citizen since the war. He shook the thought off just as the lift doors opened and Harry came barrelling towards him. He all but bowled him over as Draco stood to greet him.
Harry beamed, mischief dancing in his green eyes. “Be glad I’m on your side now,” he said before leaning in for a kiss. It was meant to be a quick peck, but Draco’s hand on his neck held him there, and before they knew it, Draco was pushing him back into the bed.
Harry shook his head, grinning. “No, Humphries here is an Animagus. He just prefers being in cat form. And since he’s here mainly for guard duty, I gave him leave to make himself, well, comfortable.”
“And as I said last night, no,” Malfoy stated. This close, he towered slightly over Harry, even though there were only a couple inches of difference in their height. Harry set his jaw, his grip tightening, fingers pressing against Malfoy’s pulse point. Both their heart rates seemed to jump in the same moment. Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment as he took a deep breath. When he opened his eyes again, he continued, slowly and clearly, “I don’t want people having access to my memories.”
“I just can’t believe he led me on like that!” he said again after his second glass. Pansy refilled her cup, then emptied the rest of the bottle into Draco’s half-full glass.
“Mother...” Draco began, taking another deep breath to steel himself. “Harry’s my boyfriend. We’re dating.”
as she said, “Malfoy’s been paroled,” sunlight and confused relief. Malfoy’s expression was guarded as he met Harry’s gaze.
has pictures of him at a Muggle gay club in Soho, but that might just be a rumour.” Draco tried to take a deep breath through his nose, but when he closed his eyes, he saw Harry – not the awkward sixteen year old, nor the haggard war hero, but Harry the man from the newspaper photographs, with his strong stubbled jaw and broad shoulders – dancing with some other nameless, faceless man in the depths of a shadowy nightclub. A storm churned in his stomach, which had settled somewhere in the vicinity of his shaking knees. He wanted to vomit, to cry, to laugh – but he kept his neutral mask in place. Pansy frowned, disappointed. She’s hoped to glean more from Draco’s reaction, but the only sign that he was bothered by her gossip was a slight sheen of sweat at his temples, and even that could be a trick of the light.
Draco, realising what he was doing, shoved his wand into his robes and leaned his head into his hands, staring at the fire in the grate. Harry resisted the urge to wrap his arms around him – they weren’t quite out to the rest of the staff yet, let alone the students, and had decided that it would be best for them to figure out their relationship first before they advertised it to the rest of Hogwarts. Although, Harry did notice Draco’s toothbrush next to his this morning, which was promising.
“Humphries, can you give us a moment, please?” he asked, not looking at the cat. Humphries’s ear twitched, but he got up, stretched, and jumped from the table. Mid-air, he transformed, becoming a tall man with skin black as midnight and a regal face with full lips and features that looked carved from stone. Malfoy blinked. Humphries didn’t acknowledge him, and with a bow to Harry, said, “Five minutes, sir. I need to use the facilities anyways.”
“How have you been, Malfoy?” Potter asked to fill the silence. Draco frowned. He arranged the tea things on a tray, brought out the chocolate-covered digestives and milk in a jug, trying to decide between the truth and a lie.
Harry thanked him and, with one final indecipherable glance at Draco, moved away to look around the small space. Father Nicola raised an eyebrow at Draco, who blushed.
“That’s sweet of you, but no, you’re a guest, go enjoy yourself,” she said. She flicked her wand and one of the fires on the stove went out as the pot hoisted itself up and began pouring its contents into a serving bowl.
Harry set the book down on the bed when he saw how worked up Draco was getting. He got up and crossed the room, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders. Only then did he realise that Draco was shaking. He squeezed Draco’s shoulders.
“But he’s avoiding me!” he hissed. Hermione only shrugged, pulling her book back towards her.
They were at breakfast, chatting about the upcoming match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Harry had come from an early morning training session with the Gryffindor Quidditch team – they barely had enough players, even with the first years they let join, and most of the practice was spent running simple drills to get them comfortable on their brooms. Still, Harry had worked up an appetite, and had already polished off a plate of eggs and streaky bacon and was eyeing the toast on Draco’s plate across from him. Draco noticed this and raised an eyebrow.
“I wish I could say that I was just… parroting what my family taught me, and to an extent it was. I took their word for gospel and didn’t think for a second that they could be in the wrong. That is, until sixth year… But the thing is, I hated all three of you because you were everything I wanted to be. Harry was the centre of attention,” he chuckled when Harry scoffed and teased him for being ‘a little peacock’, “and you, Granger, were the smartest in our class even though you were everything I was taught to think of as inferior. And Weasley, well, Weasley was Harry’s best friend, a position I had wanted from the beginning and was brutally denied.”
“GET OUT,” Draco bellowed. Parkinson and Crabbe finally got the message. They turned on their heels and ran, but not before Parkinson got in one last jab.
Robards stared up at the ceiling. “I mean,” he explained, still staring at what appeared to be a burn mark on the plaster, “that it would not be considered appropriate for you to discuss your, erm, lifestyle while you remain employed in the Ministry.” Only once he had gotten his words out did he look at Harry. Harry swallowed back the nausea rising in his throat, his tawny skin pale as Robards’ words sunk in. Robards sighed. “Do you understand what I’m saying, Potter?”
“No, just us.”
“Jus’ some kid,” Harry mumbled, his words nasally and voice congested. “Called me gay, so I hit him.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m here, aren’t I? Besides, you try to put a five-year-old to bed while getting ready for a da- for drinks.”
“Narcissa’s son,” Andromeda breathed. Draco nodded. “Gods, you are the spitting image of her, except the eyes.” She frowned. “But what are you doing here?”
Harry swore.
to go,” he said, pulling Draco against him. Draco exhaled sharply as he fell forward slightly into Harry’s arms. “We could just stay in.”
Harry sighed. “Let me get this straight,” he said as he walked slowly over to Draco with a hint of his old school-boy swagger. “You think I somehow engineered it so that I would spend eight hours alone on the train with you?” Draco tried to take a step back, but ran into the luggage, the edge of which dug into the back of his thighs. “That not only did I convince McGonagall to put the seventh and eighth years in Gryffindor Tower,” Harry continued, coming closer and closer, “but that Neville would set it up so that we would both choose the short matches and get paired together?” He stopped inches away from Draco, a dangerous smile spreading across his face as he looked up at Draco with a mischievous glint in his summer-coloured eyes. Draco frowned and tried to ignore the twist of arousal that had snuck its way into his self-righteous anger, even as Harry trapped him against the luggage. “Are you really that suspicious of my intentions,
“What about with your parents?” Harry argued.
Andromeda smiled wearily at Harry as Teddy bounded up to his godfather. He hugged Harry tight, his head up to Harry’s waist now. As always when he was around Harry, his hair matched Harry’s black curls, unruly and wild. He couldn’t help but notice that Teddy was wearing Sirius’s old leather jacket Harry had given him last Christmas, even though it was a warm early July afternoon. When Andromeda finally drew level with him, she reached over and squeezed his arm. There were a few more liver spots on her bony hands, more laugh lines around her warm brown eyes, more grey in her mousy hair. Harry smiled back, his heart in a vice.
Draco took a sip of his coffee to hide the sappy look he knew threatened to spread across his face at that. It was indeed perfect – Potter had already added the sugar, which paired so well with the chocolate undertones of the coffee. Last night’s eavesdropping replayed in his mind. He bit his lip and set the coffee down as Potter took a seat. Potter pulled out the notes from their meeting yesterday, but before he could start, Draco blurted out,
The mist came again. Harry frowned, unable to process what had just happened even while the mist began to clear once more. He was back in the Manor again, in a room he’d never seen before. It looked like some sort of study, the walls lined with rich, leather-bound books and a magnificent oak desk situated beneath a large window with a sweeping view of the grounds. It was the beginning of summer, and the sun blazed into the room, turning the wood gold. In the distance, Harry could just make out a small building beyond the manicured hedges – a chapel?
“We can go slow,” Harry said as he held him. “We can figure this out. It’ll be okay.”
Draco. He saw the other Harry’s Draco. He saw all that he had been and all that he was. A sneering child with so much anger in the curl of his lip, a proud teenager with a straight back and hate-filled eyes, a broken young man with hollow cheeks and a Mark burned into the vulnerable skin of his forearm. A ghost, telling stories from his youth, trapped forever in a house with a history he could not escape.
“Hey now.” Malfoy held up a warning finger. “I was doing just fine before you came along, thank you very much.”
Draco looked perplexed at this and, frowning, said, “
“No,” he said. A sardonic smile twisted Draco’s face. “I just told him I was getting drinks with someone. Honestly, I think he was just glad I was getting out of the house, so I let him come to his own conclusions.”
Harry raised his eyebrows at that. “Fair enough. You got lucky though, you had a nice growth spurt in, what, third year? Maybe that’s why you’re such a shitty Seeker,” he added with a mischievous smile.
“Oh.” She looked down at her feet and bit her lip. Draco wished he could sink into the stone floor. But this was his fault, too.
He stood just inside the doorway, mouth opening and closing like a fish as he stared at Draco and Harry on the bed, Draco still holding the phone out of Harry’s reach.
“He trusts me with some things. Not everything.” Harry grew quiet. He remembered the way Dumbledore had brought him along to convince Slughorn to come to Hogwarts, how he had been glorified bait for Dumbledore to use as he wished. He had promised Harry he would let him in, would teach him how to defeat Voldemort. But something told him that Dumbledore was never going to tell him everything he was planning – it was the same voice in his head that had pointed out Dumbledore’s wariness around him last year, the same voice that insisted in the dark late at night that he was alone, utterly alone, and that things were better that way. If he was alone, no one else could get hurt.
A few moments later, they stepped out of the fireplace into the atrium of the Ministry. No one noticed them at first, everyone too absorbed in the extravagant winter scene that had been recreated inside the space. Draco looked around and let out a small laugh.
“I have a cousin, back in Italy,” he began. “My family lives in this old estate, just outside of Turin. It’s gorgeous there. The mountains rise up around the valley, making you feel like you’re in the lap of the gods with the blue sky stretching above you like a canopy. In the summer, the air smells of sunlight and freshly tilled earth.
“Same as you. Couldn’t sleep,” Potter replied easily. He turned away from Draco, his attention drifting over the grounds again. “I like to come up here. Check the map. Make sure everyone’s okay. I still can’t shake the feeling that something is going to happen, because when have we ever had a normal year at Hogwarts? But….” He trailed off, his fingers tapping against his crossed arms on the railing. “Maybe it’s just in my head,” he murmured, half to himself. “But that doesn’t make it any less real.”
“I know. And I will. But not right now. I have some things to think about first.” With that, he turned and walked away, leaving Draco no choice but to get up and follow him out of Dumbledore’s office.
Spring was just beginning. The daffodils had emerged but not yet bloomed, and each sunrise grew a little warmer. As much as Draco loved this time of year, he dreaded the coming of summer. Cases would increase as people flocked to London for the summer holidays, but worse than that, the heat would make wearing long sleeves unbearable.
Unfortunately, not even a good night’s sleep could have prepared them for the next day.
“I could ask Pansy if she’d invite Ginevra to her next Wine and Whinge,” he offered, glancing down at his notes to avoid Potter’s surprised look. “That would give you a night off from playing nurse to the Harpies.”
Draco pulled back in disbelief. “Surely it just proves once and for all that I’m a coward,” he argued. Harry cupped the side of his face with one hand, brushing away lingering tears with his thumb.
So Draco got up and stripped down to his pants as Harry watched, a disbelieving grin on his face as he watched like a starving man at a feast. A serpent wound its way up his right leg, its fangs digging into the top of his thigh. He turned, his cheeks pink, as Harry stared, then suck in a gasp.
Narcissa looked away. “I do,” she whispered. They stood there for a moment in silence, the weight of grief and memory heavy in the air between them. Then, Narcissa cleared her throat, and gestured towards a door down the hall. “Draco will be waiting for us,” she said, her voice thick. Sure enough, Draco leaned out of the doorway, a confused frown on his face.
“I don’t even know her!” he exclaimed. But again, Lucius waved away his son’s concerns.
“The story of where I come from.” He took a deep breath, and added, “And the story of how I died.”
“That’s the idea,” Harry said in a daze. Draco laughed. Harry grinned back and flicked his wrist. Draco yelped as his pants vanished.
Ron slouched off to his desk. Harry sighed. He knew that he had not heard the end of it, and that by this evening, he would have Ron
Draco sighed and nodded. “Forget it, it’s not important,” he said, waving his hand. “I just thought, maybe…”
“If they do,” said Ron, making both of them turn in surprise, “they’ll have to get through me first.”
Harry shrugged. “He wasn’t what I wanted, really,” he said quietly. “It’s hard to love someone when you’ve already given your heart away.”
“We don’t
Harry sighed and dropped his hands into his lap. Then he gasped. Draco knelt on the sofa, his upper body bowed over Harry’s knees, his fingers wrapped around Harry’s wrists. His face was so close to Harry’s, and Harry didn’t think anyone had ever looked at him the way Draco did in that moment, not even Ginny. His stomach did a little jig, and he wasn’t sure if he was going to throw up or pass out. Or both.
“I don’t know,” she admitted after a long silence. “Or, rather, I should say, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with you.”
A trickle of ice slipped down Harry’s spine, making the hairs on the back of his neck rise. A key that could get you in anywhere, no matter what? Made by someone who was missing an ear because of a misfired
Harry let out a laugh. Then he turned, still gripping Malfoy’s arm, and waved at where number twelve was already squeezing itself into existence. Malfoy huffed. Harry could have sworn he heard him mumble, “Of course.”
“I love you,” Harry murmured again. Draco kissed the top of his head, burying his nose in Harry’s curls.
“Dumbledore,” he said. Malfoy frowned.
“That it wasn’t working,” he said, his voice quiet. “That I found someone else.”
They both jumped when something vibrated beneath them. Draco wiggled his hand between them and pulled out Harry’s phone, which lit up with a series of texts from Ron. Harry swore. He’d forgotten about Ron. He tried to snatch the phone from Draco but he just held it out of his reach as he read Ron’s texts out loud.
Harry frowned slightly. “Why were you looking for batteries in my bedside table?” he asked. Draco’s blush turned from pink to scarlet. His skin was almost as fair as Ron’s, so there was no way for Draco to hide it. Harry swallowed hard. He liked the way Draco blushed.
They held each other close, their breaths mingling, chests pressed so close together they couldn’t tell whose heartbeat was whose. Then Harry ducked his head in for another kiss, slow and sweet at first as they explored, remembering the taste of each other on their tongues. Draco undid the buttons of Harry’s shirt, which Harry shrugged off without a thought, tossing it aside before setting on divesting Draco of his. Their kisses grew heated, their touches hungry. When Draco suggested they move to the bedroom, all Harry could do was nod.
“Potter, stop.”
“Near Australia.”
“I tried,” he said, voice so quiet Harry had to strain to make out the words, “years ago, to get rid of the Mark. At least, that’s what I told myself, at the time. Mother found me, the last time.” He pointed at one scar that, unlike the rest, ran vertically along the curve of the snake, almost hidden by the writhing serpent. There, the skin was raised, puckered pink against black and white. He let out a hollow laugh. “She heard me fall over and when she knocked and I didn’t answer, she burst into the bathroom where I was, a bloody mess on the floor. When I came to, hours later, all bandaged up and bundled away in my room, she slapped me and called me a drama queen.” He ran his finger up and down the scar with a watery smile on his trembling lips. “I hadn’t known my father had just done the same thing in Azkaban. Except he did the job properly. She had only told me that he had died, she hadn’t said anything about….” He wiped at his nose with the back of his hand, tried to rub away the tears slipping down his cheeks. “Gods, I was so stupid,” he muttered thickly, trying to smile. “I don’t know why I’m telling you this, it’s not the time nor the place, the first time you see me with my shirt off and I’m blubbering like a baby.”
“Uncle Draco,” he asked, his voice timid as he shifted in his seat. Draco raised an eyebrow, letting him know he was listening. “How did you know you were gay?”
“Oh, I see,” she murmured. “You know exactly what set him off, don’t you?”
“Then,” Draco continued, clearing his throat, “I saw the news when I went back into town for more supplies, and I saw that – that…” He swallowed and broke off, looking down at his hands. The kettle whistled, startling them both. Harry got up and got the tea things together along with a plate of biscuits. Once Malfoy had his cup of tea and had practically inhaled all the custard creams, he picked up his story.
Harry shrugged. “Of course,” he said, “if it makes you feel better.” To himself, he added,
Hermione frowned. “Evicted you? For what?”
Dawkins shook his head. “You might have been taken in by his story, Potter, but I wouldn’t put it past him to try and overpower you.”
“Draco?” he called. No answer. He went to the hallway and called again. Nothing. So he made his way up the grand staircase, past the empty rooms and the faded portraits of stern-faced men and women who watched him with pale grey eyes. He walked down the corridor to Draco’s room, where the door stood ajar. He stood outside for a moment, his pulse thrumming, unsure if he should knock or not. He pushed the door open wider. It creaked loudly on rusty hinges, and Harry winced. “Draco?” he called one more time as he stepped into the room. “You here?”
“Sweet Salazar, did I really just say that?” Draco wheezed as he tried to collect himself. Harry snickered as he took off his glasses to wipe at his eyes. He cleaned the lenses with the hem of his shirt before hooking them back on with a broad grin.
Blaise paused with a slight frown, as if uncertain how to continue. Draco, who had been hanging on Blaise’s every word, waited impatiently for him to continue. When the silence stretched on, Draco blurted out, “Well? What happened next?”
Jenkins face took on a greyish hue. “Some sort of Cutting curse?” he squeaked.
“I’m not going to let him hurt you,” Harry repeated, enunciating each word as clearly as he could. Draco sighed and shook his head. Still, he did not move from the circle of Harry’s arms, did not remove his hands from Harry’s waist.
“It was your Uncle Sirius’s,” he told Teddy, whose eyes grew to the size of dinner plates at the mention of his infamous uncle. “I had it Charmed so that it’ll fit you no matter how big you get.”
“Did Ron tell you I broke Robards’ window?” Harry asked. Hermione let out a long-suffering sigh.
He was raised by his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon, a merchant living on the edges of a bustling city. They were wealthy enough to have a small cottage and to send their son to the prestigious grammar school in the city – but Harry, their nephew and kin, lived in the cramped cellar and learned his letters from their neighbour, a spinster who everyone said was half-mad. Mistress Figg was a kind woman, but she only knew so much. Being the daughter of a merchant herself, she was literate enough to keep the books and manage the accounts when her father passed twenty years ago, but she couldn’t answer Harry’s questions about the books she lent him that he kept hidden under his bed roll. If his uncle saw him reading, he would whip him for ‘idleness’ and ‘sloth’ and order him instead to scrub the floors or set him any one of the numerous servantly tasks the family assigned him.
“Which means that we’ll be having a party just for the seventh and eighth years this Saturday, starting at eight p.m.,” added Neville. He bounced on the balls of his feet and nervously rubbed his hands together as an excited murmur spread throughout the common room. Draco, who had been leaning against the wall near the stairwell, looked over to where Potter sat in the corner by one of the narrow windows. He frowned – Potter wasn’t even paying attention. Instead, he just stared out at the rain beating against the glass, his chin in his hand. Neville and Hermione were fielding questions – would it be fancy dress, could they bring friends from other years, etc. – and didn’t seem to notice their despondent celebrity. Draco pushed off the wall, ignoring Astoria’s attempt to draw him into a conversation about matching Hallowe’en costumes, and edged around the room towards Potter.
“Oh shit,” Harry blurted out, cutting off Ron’s comparison of Fred Junior’s antics to sweet, perfect Rose. “Guys, I’m so sorry, I have to go. Actually, if you could send Kellen over for me – I’m so sorry, I’ve just had a breakthrough. Give little Rosie a kiss from me, and tell Molly I said hi and that once this is over I’ll take over babysitting duty again. But right now – ”
“Yes, but there are enough similarities between you, maybe – ”
Their first kiss was messy, mouths mashing together, teeth clicking and noses bumping as they collided. Draco pulled back, and for a horrible moment, Harry thought he was going to laugh at him. But all he did was reposition and draw him back in. This second kiss was slower, gentler as they explored the brush of lips, the hush of breath as they came up for air, only to dive back in, deeper, longer, hungrier. Harry grabbed Draco’s hips, pulling him flush against him, as Draco’s hands tangled in Harry’s wild curls. It was so different from kissing a girl, he realised distantly. The girls he had kissed – albeit only two – were all soft and pliant. Draco was not. He was the drag of stubble against Harry’s skin, the hard press of his body, the sharp pleasure of teeth nipping at his lip. God, he could kiss Draco all day long and never get bored.
“I got suspended,” he said. Draco gasped.
“I will. And Harry?” Harry knelt back down and Ron gave him a stern look. “If he does anything funny, I’ll curse the git myself.”
“Explain,” he demanded. Pansy lifted one shoulder in a shrug. She pulled her wand out and levitated a small, almost identical velvet bag out of the empty vase on the mantle piece that she had always said was purely ‘decorative’ and forbade Draco from putting flowers in it. Now he knew why.
“And you say I’m a sap.”
“Don’t – ”
“As it is,” he continued, “the fate of my people is at stake, and the only other necromancer in the land is still in training. She’s a promising young Elf, but since she is still a child, she doesn’t have the knowledge or experience necessary to find what is killing my people. You, on the other hand, do. So.” He leaned back in his chair and pressed his steepled fingertips to his pointy chin. “The privy council will be meeting tomorrow morning. I trust you will behave better then.”
“I don’t understand.”
By the time Malfoy came down, dressed and hair combed, Harry had set a peace offering of toast and eggs next to a steaming cup of black coffee for him. Malfoy eyed it suspiciously, poking the eggs as if expecting them to eat his fork. Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy took a cautious bite, then another. Kellen waited until Malfoy had polished off his eggs and half of his coffee before starting in on her questions. Harry knew this must be her last case as a Junior Auror – Robards would be an idiot not to promote her – and that he was on the case mostly as a formality, so he only half paid attention while he did the washing up.
Malfoy gave the cat a curt bow, his frown like an apostrophe in the curl of his lips. “I am… confused,” he said at last. “Humphries… is a cat? A Kneazle?”
, and a twin killed by Death Eaters? But no, it was too simple, too easy, and besides, it was George, bubbly, happy George. George, who didn’t laugh for years after Fred died. George, who, by his own wife’s admission last Christmas, had become somewhat reclusive, secretive even? George, who had designed a key that could get him in anywhere.
“You’re standing in front of my luggage,” he murmured.
They had agreed when they adopted James that Draco could operate his potions consultancy from home, so long as Harry came home on weekends during termtime. And while he missed his husband, Draco had to admit, it was better than trying to raise a family at Hogwarts. They had entertained the idea the first few years of Harry’s tenure, when Teddy was still small, Draco was finishing his apprenticeship with Professor Williams, and they were recently married – but the number of times Teddy would wander off into the castle made them realise that it was a terrible idea to bring toddlers to Hogwarts. So they found this cottage, a Grade II listed building covered in wisteria deep in the Cotswolds. Draco began to build his client base, and Harry came home as often as he could. After a couple years, they adopted James, then Albus, then Lily. But of course, Teddy would always be their first born of sorts. Teddy, who was fifteen and watching his adopted father slice up tomatoes for the salad with a worried frown on his young, acne-spotted face.
“Sweet God in Heaven,” he said, leaning his head back, “I think my life just flashed before my eyes.”
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again. He took a deep breath and leaned back, looking Draco over slowly. “How did you know?” he asked. “That you were gay?”
There was another pause. Then,
Ron frowned. He picked at a loose thread in his dress robes – a much nicer tweed set than the maroon ones he wore to the Yule Ball, if still a little worn. Harry let out a long breath through his nose and sat up, uncrossing his legs and leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. “Ron, you’re my best mate,” he said quietly. “Just do me this favour and try to not hate him? For me?”
“One minute late,” Harry corrected him. “Hardly a crime.”
Teddy lowered his hands, but remained slumped in his chair, all arms and legs and too much torso. He looked more and more like Lupin every day. “I don’t want to break up over this,” he whispered. “I do like her, I just…”
“This is going to take longer than seven minutes.” He gave Draco a quick, tight squeeze. “I’ll tell you later. Come by mine after?”
He had ultimately decided not to quit the force. Not just yet, anyway. He and Hermione had drawn up a formal complaint against the department for discrimination, but it had gone nowhere. There simply had not been enough proof to condemn Robards for his words. In the process, however, Hermione had discovered that there were no laws in place protecting individuals from discrimination in the workplace. It became all too painfully clear why the Ministry had been able to get away with targeting Muggleborns during the war. When Hermione had told him, wringing her hands as she trembled with rage and far too much caffeine, Harry had sat down at his desk, his knees giving way with shock. He looked around the bull pen, at all of his colleagues, at Julia from Accounting who was walking by holding the contents of her desk in a cardboard box – she had handed in her resignation the week Harry was suspended.
“Still,” Draco insisted, turning around to look at him. “I am sorry. Really. Especially after the way I treated you all those years.”
Father Nicola laughed. “I used to be,” he replied. “Now, I am just Nicola. Please, take your time, explore the church. There’s not much to see, but what is mine is yours.”
“Okay there, Harry?” Ron asked, drawing level with Harry and Draco.
It was not until his second year living at Hogwarts that he told his friends and new-found family about his Death-sense. He would never had said a thing, but while with his friends he had come across a ghost of a girl who looked so much like Penelope that he had cried out – but it wasn’t Penelope, and his friends couldn’t see the ghost who begged Harry to find her killer. Her name was Myrtle, and she had been murdered fifty years ago in those very halls. Several months later, he and his friends discovered that her killer had been the very same necromancer that had killed Harry’s parents – and that Myrtle was not alone. Over a hundred ghosts haunted the grounds of Hogwarts, most keeping to themselves or to abandoned hallways where they had spent happier days. Overwhelmed and lost, Harry had broken down and told Sirius and Remus, who held him in their arms as he wept.
“Your cousin and his friends,” Draco echoed, unconvinced. “They, what, tried to teach you how to dance or something?”
“What was that?” Ron asked. Harry squirmed.
“Do you have plans for the winter hols?” Harry asked, moving his pawn forward. Draco pursed his lips as he studied the board.
At one point, the priest looked up, his gaze finding Draco’s for a heartbeat. The priest did not falter, but surprise arched his brow and tilted his head to one side as he considered the boy. Then he smiled and continued on, as if Draco was simply a passing thought that amused him. Draco snuck out the moment the priest’s gaze released him, vowing as he strode back towards familiar fields and hedgerows that he would never go back, never. What would his parents think?
Ron screwed his face up in thought. “Yeah, I think so. Why?”
“Boys!” Hermione heaved herself to her feet, bracing her weight against the table. Ron reflexively reached out to support her, but she waved him away. “You both are being ridiculous. Now please stop shouting.” She rolled her shoulders back and levelled her glare first at Harry, then at Ron. “How about this, then – Harry, you bring Malfoy along to coffee next chance you get, and we’ll get to know this new Malfoy, all right?”
“Do you.” It wasn’t a question. Blaise leaned forward, both feet planted now on the stone floor as he rubbed his hands together slowly, elbows on his knees. He considered Draco from beneath furrowed brows. “Do you ever think,” he said, picking his words with care, “that maybe it’s something else?”
He pulled off the Cloak and jumped down, one hand already going to his wand but not pulling it out just yet. Surprise flickered in Malfoy’s grey eyes, but he quickly smoothed it away into his trademark sneer. He didn’t go for his wand. Harry hesitated for a moment, then relaxed, tossing the Cloak onto the seat behind him.
“That’s …alarming. Should I be concerned?”
“Take the ‘thank you’, Potter,” he said. “I’m not saying it again.”
Malfoy Manor was situated in a large plot of land bordered on all sides by tall green hedges. Perfectly manicured bushes and trees rustled their empty branches in the breeze. Although it was nearly nine in the morning, the sun was barely up in the sky, the rosy light of dawn warming the frozen landscape. As Harry and Draco approached the front door of the mansion, Harry had to admit – it was beautiful, if eerily quiet. Draco went up the stairs to the front door, but Harry stayed on the gravel path, just in case he needed to make a quick getaway. Draco, noticing, looked back at Harry with exasperation.
They laughed. Harry pulled back, but not before giving Draco a quick kiss on the forehead. “Okay then,” he murmured. “One step at a time.”
Harry didn’t stop grinning the entire way to Hogsmeade.
November 1999
They were not, in fact, late. They were fifteen minutes early to the eight thirty meeting time Kellen had set. She, of course, was already there, and had them sit in the front row of the gallery in case the Wizengamot decided to call on Draco for testimony, which, she warned, they probably would. For a long time, it was just them and a few other Aurors. Then the room began to fill up slowly. Draco got increasingly fidgety next to Harry. When he started bouncing his knee up and down, Harry reached over with one finger and pushed his knee down, holding it there until Draco let out a huff. Harry pulled his hand back with a smirk, crossing his arms over his chest. He’d forgotten how freezing cold these court rooms were.
She crossed her arms, not entirely convinced. Nonetheless, she nodded. “I’ll be in the U-bend,” she told Malfoy haughtily. Then she swept off with a huff, proceeding to dive straight into one of the toilets with a drawn-out wail that echoed in the tiled room long after she was gone. Harry shook his head with a small smile.
“I was raised speaking both,” he explained. “I just use English more often, although French does come in handy in the Foreign Office. You’d be surprised how many British witches and wizards don’t speak another language other than English, Gaelic or Welsh, although I have to admit, the latter is still pretty impressive to me.”
“Harry,” he said. “What’s yours?”
He let go of Draco’s hand to ghost up Draco’s thigh, to waver dangerously close to the bulge in his trousers. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat. He felt his heart stutter. But he also realised this was all anticipation – desire was strangely, quietly absent. Draco bit his lip. He wanted to want it, to want Harry’s hand to move closer, to want that friction, but all he felt was silence.
“What are godfathers for?” he asked innocently. Andromeda shook her head, but smiled down at Teddy, who was already pulling the jacket on and admiring it with glee.
“I just wish he would go back to where he came from.”
Harry’s jaw dropped. “I can’t believe that,” he said with a slow shake of his head. “No king would let his people die, surely.” Narcissa looked away then, worrying a silver ring on her left hand.
Harry shuffled his feet as he gestured behind him. “Are we bringing Malfoy in as well? Because if we are, I don’t think an
Harry shook his head. “Like, in books and fairy stories?”
you for you?”
“That’s a lot for one person to apologise for,” Harry said. Malfoy looked up. Something flashed in his silver-grey eyes, but it was gone before Harry could register it – was it hope? He shook his head, took another sip of beer. “Besides,” he added, dabbing his mouth with the back of his hand, “I forgave you a long time ago. We both did terrible things back then.” His gaze slipped down Malfoy’s chest, tracing scars he could not see but could never forget. “I’m sorry,” he meant to say, but could only shape the words, his voice failing. When he did manage to drag his eyes back up to Malfoy’s face, there was a new kind of tension in the air, both confusing and incredibly familiar. Malfoy raised an eyebrow. Harry looked away.
They jumped apart.
“Alright. Walk me through what happened the last time you were with him,” she said, “since you seem hell-bent on distracting me.”
“No, I promised I wouldn’t blame you if it did. It’s different, see?” Harry pointed out. He leaned back in his chair, stretching out his legs under the table. His boots nudged something – he suspected Malfoy’s foot – but he didn’t pull back. Malfoy shook his head, that faint blush blooming again over his cheekbones. “How have you been, Malfoy?” Harry asked finally. Malfoy shrugged and looked away.
As Harry came out of the shower, towel wrapped around his waist, he noticed Draco sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed, still just in his boxers from the night before. He was wringing his hands, his head bowed, his bedhead making Harry’s heart squeeze.
Draco frowned slightly. “Not entirely,” he said, “but I think I understand.” He looked down at their joined hands and his frown lightened into a precious smile. “You know, I think I’ve fancied you for a really long time. Years, even.”
He heard Draco give a dry laugh. Then, a cold breath of air fluttered against Harry’s side. He turned, and there was Draco, lying next to him with his arms behind his head. His skin was like starlight… Lord, what was Harry thinking? But still, he couldn’t look away.
“Okay.” Draco kissed the top of his head before settling back against the pillow. “Tomorrow, then.”
“I would advise you not to say anything more, sir, lest you further incriminate yourself,” she said icily. “There are enough witnesses here that would be more than happy to testify that you are threatening and verbally assaulting these two men, and I for one am not afraid to take you on in a court of law.”
That odd, indecipherable look came into Malfoy’s storm-coloured eyes. Then, a slow smile spread across his face, a smile unlike any Harry had seen from him before. It made Harry’s breath catch in his chest and send that fluttery feeling through his entire gut. But before Harry could process it, Malfoy was speaking and he had to refocus on his words.
When Draco said nothing, Harry looked up at him, his green eyes wide, vulnerable and afraid. “Draco?” he said. “Please say something. Anything.”
Malfoy nodded, not looking convinced. “Right,” he mumbled, holding the pyjamas close to his chest. He stared at them as he said, very slowly, “Could you, maybe, if it’s not too much trouble… Could you stay in my room tonight? Not – not in my bed, obviously,” he added, blushing. Harry fought back the laughter bubbling his throat at the sight of Malfoy flustered. “I just – it’s stupid, never mind.”
Draco leaned forward, his elbows braced on the countertop, staring seriously at Harry who kept fidgeting under his gaze. “Harry,” he said, his voice soft but dangerously quiet. Harry’s eyes widened and he froze, his only movement being the shallow rise and fall of his chest. “You know that’s child abuse, right? Gods, no wonder you’re so small.”
“Yes,” Draco said firmly. “Let’s.”
Malfoy leaned in so that their noses were inches apart, his crooked smile conspiratorial as he whispered back, “Yes, I know. As I said, I work here.”
Harry let out the breath he had been holding. “Okay.”
“I’m sure it will be fine,” Draco said in a rush. “It’s not like she’ll curse you or anything.”
Harry sighed and set his toast down. “Well, it’s like I said the first night,” he reminded Neville. “The war’s over. And the only way we recover from it is we forgive each other and move on. Draco’s paid his price. No use asking him to continue paying for his mistakes, or the mistakes of his parents.” He pushed his plate away with a shrug. “Besides, once you get past the prickly outside bit, he’s not bad, actually.”
Draco scoffed. “Trust me, Harry, everyone here knows how to hide their torture under niceties.”
“Draco? You okay?” he asked as he put on his glasses and stood in front of the other boy. Draco looked up with a worried frown.
Harry laughed properly this time. “No,” he said slowly. “Thank you, really, but I think that would just make things worse. Ron I can talk to. Robards….” He fell quiet. He pursed his lips as he stared distantly into the fire. Draco did not like the look in Harry’s eyes. Something died in Harry’s eyes that day. It would take a long time before they came back to life again.
Harry chuckled. “I’ve seen more of your emotions in the last twenty-four hours than I have in the past seven years. Well, your emotions beyond being an absolute twat, in any case,” he teased. Draco frowned at this, and Harry leaned in to kiss his cheek. “Still,” he added, his breath warm against Draco’s ear, sending a shiver down his spine, “if you’re worried about what those assholes are going to say, don’t be. You’ve got me now. And Ron. And most of the football team.”
After his speech, Andromeda was quiet. She studied Harry, her own gentle magic searching for any signs of coercion or deception. Harry let her. He spread his arms wide, adding, “You’re not going to find anything. I’m not under his spell. I genuinely like him. And he, amazingly, likes me, too.”
“W-what?”
But Harry knew. He knew why his aunt and uncle despised him, why his cousin Dudley bullied him, why they beat him with the books they found secreted away in the cellar. He knew it had to do with his parents, with the scar on his forehead, and with the way he could sense when someone was about to die.
Harry shrugged. A week ago, the idea would have been a nightmare, but now, in a surreal moment of clarity, he knew this was the right thing to do. Kellen blinked several times, processing everything. Malfoy was watching him with that indecipherable look on his pointed face.
Before he could answer, there was a roar and a flare of green flames in the kitchen fireplace, and they both sprang apart in time to see Ginny stepping out of the grate, brushing ash off her jumper.
September passed without much incident. The other eighth years were perfectly happy to accept Draco into their fold, although Hermione and Neville had their reservations. They weren’t openly hostile, but Draco felt their glares following him, especially if he got too close to Harry. So he kept his nose down and tried to focus on his school work. That was what he was here for, after all.
The night of the party came, and the common room was buzzing with excitement. Paper streamers had been hung up, jack lanterns were suspended above their heads, and an assortment of food and drinks had been brought up earlier by the house elves, not to mention the Firewhiskey snuck in by some of the older students. The wireless blasted The Weird Sisters, and some of the Muggleborns were teaching the others Muggle party games. Draco managed to be left alone for the most part, sipping his glass of pumpkin juice spiked with the contraband Firewhiskey while he watched the party from the same windowsill Potter had haunted earlier that week.
Malfoy looked up at him, startled. There were tears in his quicksilver eyes.
“Good to have you here, Draco,” said Molly, releasing Draco and giving him a quick pat on the cheek. He gave her a small, polite smile. He looked over at Harry, who was trying to hide his blushing face as he bent over the table, focusing entirely on filling the pies.
Ron was still laughing when Harry came into the kitchen ten minutes later.
“Bittersweet.” Draco’s expression softened, disbelief mingling with awe in the slant of his lips. Harry nodded, his own smile growing.
Fire roared in the grate behind them. Draco froze and Harry immediately turned, keeping Draco behind him and levelling his wand at the intruder. He sighed in relief when he saw Ron, and dropped his wand back into the pocket of his robes.
Now, dear reader, there are two endings to this story. The first goes like this.
“Very good. You’re doing great. What are four things you can feel?”
is a Metamophmagus, which means he’s the coolest five year old you will ever meet?”
Draco opened and closed his mouth. As much as he wanted her to be wrong, he knew Pansy was, in this instance, perfectly in the right. He swallowed. “Well, shit,” he said. Pansy let out a huff, somewhere between a laugh and a repressed curse.
“Dork,” he muttered. Harry rubbed his hand up and down Draco’s waist. Draco closed his eyes at the touch and snuggled closer. They laid like that for a good long while. Harry felt himself slipping off to sleep when he heard Draco ask, “Do we have to go to the Weasley’s tonight? Couldn’t we just stay here?”
“Nothing,” he said too quickly, “I just invited Draco over for some tea.” The kettle began to whistle just then, and Harry flicked his wand at it to move it off the hob with a sheepish, “See?” Draco wanted to bury his face in his hands in mortification, but doing so would only make it worse.
Draco sighed and set his half-eaten lunch on the desk. “There isn’t. I was just….” He hesitated, biting his lip. “This volume focuses on the counter-spells. I thought, maybe, there was a way to break the bond.”
“Yes, I think that’s everything.”
“Draco, he’ s a kid.”
“Use it well,” she whispered in the voice of the dead, a rusty guttural groan.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I’ll be fine,” he said quietly. He straightened up just enough to give Draco a quick kiss. “I love you,” he whispered against Draco’s lips.
Their mouths and hands explored, remembered, rediscovered. Harry forgot how ticklish Draco was, and Draco remembered how touch-starved Harry could be, how desperately he wanted to mould himself to Draco, skin to skin. He let Draco sit up just enough to pull off his jumper and tear off his own shirt, before immediately pressing him back into the mattress. Draco leaned his head back with a contented sigh as Harry began kissing his way down Draco’s chest, his fingertips skipping slightly over the long, thin scars scattered across the pale skin. He could feel Harry hesitate when he saw them, warm breath huffing against his chest.
“You haven’t touched it,” Harry argued. He leaned forward on his crossed arms, his eyes glinting behind his glasses. Draco gestured to the rest of his plate, the breakfast half-eaten.
“Not at all,” Harry said firmly. “You’re as brave a Gryffindor as any of them.”
Draco’s jaw dropped as he stared at Harry. Ginny blinked once, turning to look at her fiancé. If she was surprised, she didn’t show it. Instead, her shoulders slumped, an odd mixture of pain and relief rippling across her face. Harry rubbed at his eyes with the heel of his hand, pushing his glasses up with a sigh. He slid them back into place. He looked first at Draco in apology, then at Ginny for forgiveness.
“What are we playing again?” asked a seventh-year boy with a pinched face like a rat.
Ron scowled. Nonetheless he said nothing. Taking that as acceptance, Hermione turned on Harry. He immediately surrendered. He knew better than to try and fight Hermione.
“Prat,” Draco said with a laugh. Harry grinned. He liked this laugh – not the jeering one he’d heard from Draco all these years, but this one, light and relaxed and real. He tucked a strand of hair that had fallen into Draco’s eyes back behind his ear, smiling at the fondness in Draco’s eyes.
Later, as Harry lay awake in the sumptuous bed that was likely worth more than he had ever owned and then some, he pulled out the Remembrance Stone from the pouch around his neck. He closed his eyes and turned it over in his hands three times one way, then three times another, calling Narcissa’s name in his mind.
Harry raised an eyebrow. Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I promise it’s not a weapon or anything, just… Come on, I’m trying to clear my name here.”
The minute the door closed behind Malfoy, shutting out his chuckling laugh, Harry dropped his head in his hands and groaned.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Charlie, I forgot to ask, how’s your partner? Oh, that’s right, you don’t have one.”
Draco shook his head, distracted by how close Harry’s face was to his as he held up the Cloak a bit with one hand. Harry grinned and grabbed his hand, half-running and half-dragging Draco down the empty corridors. Their hushed laughter woke some of the portraits, who grumbled about new, inconsiderate ghosts. Draco didn’t care. Harry’s hand was just like he remembered back in his family’s kitchen, warm and calloused and perfect. His heart raced with their feet as they snuck out the castle doors into the grounds, the frost crunching beneath them as they ran.
Neville shook his head as he grabbed his coat. “Can’t believe I bet five Galleons on New Year’s,” he muttered to himself. “Who would have thought things would escalate so quickly?”
“Oh, no,” Malfoy replied, his voice cool and even. “I was just wondering if we could… talk.”
“How?” Harry asked, brow furrowing.
“You and your strange swears,” Harry said with a smile as he tried to step away from Draco. He winced when his weight rolled onto his sore ankle. Draco pressed his lips into a thin line, his eyes narrowing. Then he stood and tried to direct Harry towards the sheet-covered sofa. His hand kept coming up as if to grab Harry’s shoulder, but it would fall straight through like a chill mist, making Harry shiver. When Harry did finally sit down on the couch, Draco sat down next to him, a serious expression on his pale face.
Potter stared at him as if he had turned himself into a teacup. “Yes, I did,” he said in the same tone he would use to explain a rather simple truth to a rather simple child. “Your mother saved my life. She knew I was alive, but she lied to Voldemort so that she could get back to the castle and find you.”
For a long while, they sat there in silence, watching the fire die. An uncomfortable suspicion crawled up Draco’s spine. Without looking at Blaise, he asked, “Why are you telling me this?”
The door opened, creaking on its rusted hinges, into a bedroom. There was a four poster bed that took up most of the room, faded green velvet curtains pulled back to let in the light through the window, and a marble fireplace with a wrought iron cover. The room smelled of mildew and dust, tickling Harry’s throat with each breath. And there, sitting in a wing-backed olive-coloured chair near the window, was the young man.
Draco nodded. Harry grinned.
“Please don’t make me tell the whole story over again.”
“You,” Draco said, holding Harry’s head in his hands, “are too good to me.”
. He thought of sunlit smiles, sweet grey eyes, the smell of butter and garlic, shared dinners that felt like home. He thought of that first night – Draco, panicked and afraid, desperate for any semblance of safety, asking Harry to stay with him, to protect him. And he knew. He knew how it all looked. He lowered his hands with a sigh.
Harry didn’t say anything. His gaze grew heavy as he looked at Draco, the hand at his collarbone coming up to cradle Draco’s jaw, his thumb brushing his cheek. Draco leaned into his touch, their eyes saying everything they could not put to words.
.” Harry’s breath hitched in his throat, and he tried to steady himself again. It was as if the other Harry Potter was speaking through him, as if the words coming out of his mouth weren’t his but the other Harry’s, as if he was nothing more than a conduit from one world to another.
“Thank you,” he managed to say, his voice a little huskier than he intended. Something flashed across Draco’s face, but was quickly concealed by his trademark deadpan mask. Harry looked from his grey eyes, to his pink lips, then furtively down to the package in his hands. “I didn’t get you anything,” he mumbled.
“Is it true?” Malfoy asked, so quietly Harry could have imagined it. Then he added, “Are you? Gay?”
“I had the same thought,” she said. “But for the sake of anonymity, they redacted the names from the official report. There was a note, though, that they weren’t able to study the pair further because… well, one was sent to Azkaban and the other was deemed not suitable for the study because… well, because he was a werewolf.”
“What do we do now?”
With that, he stood, pushing away from the table in one sharp, fluid movement. Before Harry could begin to stammer out an apology, the king strode out of the room, flanked by his guards. Harry’s shoulders slumped. He buried his face in his hands and groaned.
“Very true. Alec was bisexual too, actually. Apparently I have a type.” They both giggled at this, but then Draco gasped and his other hand came up to gingerly cover his ribs. “Ow, okay, no more laughing,” he hissed. Harry nodded, concern in the curve of his mouth.
“That’s just it! He practically ogled Krum!”
Hermione came down from the girls’ dormitories, hair frazzled and eyes dazed. She didn’t even notice Harry and Draco in the window seat and instead made a beeline for the snacks table, piling a plate high with custard creams and chocolates before turning back towards the dorms. She was taking every N.E.W.T. subject possible and already it was starting to take its toll. When Harry had asked her over lunch if she was coming to the party, she had thrown up her hands and exclaimed in a very shrill voice, “It’s a Tuesday! No, I’m not going to a party on a bloody school night!”
Harry groaned and leaned his back against the sofa cushions. “What if I don’t want to do that, though?” he whinged. “What if I just want to have a normal life for once?”
“At least they seem happy together,” she said. Ron shrugged. She turned her shoulders towards him, since moving her entire body was too much effort. “Why can’t you just be happy for them?” she demanded. Ron crossed his arms across his chest, his expression growing sombre.
Harry snorted at this. “Sensitive doesn’t even begin to cover it,” he teased. Draco gently tugged his hair in reprimand with a playful scowl.
“I don’t know everything the guy is into.” At Harry’s disbelieving snort, he looked up, his grey eyes sharp as his lips twisted. “And for the record, I never said I was straight,” he clarified with a raised eyebrow. “Heaven forbid someone accuse me of
“You keep saying that. ‘Oh.’ Did you get hit by a
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again. Draco smirked, triumphant. Harry scrubbed his face, pushing his glasses up into his curls. Finally, he let his hands fall. He couldn’t quite make out Draco’s expression without his glasses, but he did see a faint blush of pink in his pale cheeks.
Hermione frowned as she turned on Draco. “Alright, then,” she said, her voice calculating and cold. “Let’s do this, shall we?”
“What, you don’t like my joggers?”
He was surprised, honestly, that he hadn’t seen it earlier. The boy had been curiously drawn to David Bowie at an incredibly young age, and would often blush when either Draco or Harry asked if there was anyone he fancied. They assumed it was normal teenage nerves. And when Teddy had started to date Victoire earlier that year, they thought that was the answer. But now… “I really hate to say this,” Draco said, looking up at his godson-in-law, “but you should talk to Harry. He would know more about this than me.”
“How can I help you, my boy?” he asked. “We didn’t have an appointment today, did we?”
“You didn’t know him,” she murmured. “Not at the end.” Then she smiled, a polite mask sliding over her pale face. “I’ll have a servant show you to your rooms, shall I?”
, he would hear Death murmur,
“Yes, you do,” Draco and Hermione said in unison. Harry gaped at them.
In that moment, they were happy.
Narcissa Malfoy froze. Harry straightened up and gave her a small, apologetic smile.
And so, together with his friends, he set out to find the last Prince of Death.
Draco’s jaw dropped. Blaise nodded with a conspiratorial look. Draco swallowed hard and drew both of his knees into his chest. The image of two boys, almost men, snogging in the shadowed overgrowth of the forest – he blushed and looked away, something stirring low inside him. Blaise nodded again, his lips pressed into a thin line.
That evening, Harry broke their silent truce.
“Oh.” Draco traced a lazy pattern on Harry’s chest as he mulled this over. “I mean, technically, he’s my cousin. On my mother’s side. So it’ll be good for me to meet him.”
Harry’s hands were suddenly on his hips, pulling him close to the edge of the bed, making him stumble a little. Harry steadied him, his grip firm. Draco turned his head, about to ask what he was doing. He jumped slightly as Harry pressed a kiss to the branch of the tattoo on his low back, but then Harry’s lips moved up, mouthing along the path of lightning as he carefully pulled Draco down onto his lap. He kissed up to the nape of Draco’s neck, his hands sliding down from his hips to his thighs. One hand traced the curve of the serpent’s head, while the other brushed along the inside of his left thigh. Draco leaned his head back on Harry’s shoulder with a moan as he let his legs fall open, giving into the feel of Harry’s lips on his neck, his hands on his thighs. Then Harry was palming up his thigh, up his stomach, making Draco shudder. He splayed his hand over the dragon on his chest, pushing Draco against him as he rolled his hips up under Draco, grinding against his arse. Draco cried out. He reached back to tangle his hand in Harry’s curls as Harry sucked a love bite into his shoulder, grinding his hips down against the hard line of Harry’s cock, biting his lip to hold back the keen building in his throat.
“I am sorry about my friends.”
“Draco, this is Teddy and Andromeda,” Harry explained. “Teddy, this is your cousin, Draco.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco mumbled against Harry’s chest.
By the time he had finished, Hermione had gotten to her feet and was pacing back and forth. She kept trying to smooth back her flyaway curls into her loose bun. “So you weren’t sleeping with him when the investigation started?” she said. Harry shook his head. “Well, either way, it’s good the case is under Kellen’s name, because this could look really bad for you. I know, I know,” she held up a hand to stop Harry from protesting, even though he was about to agree with her, “there’s already a conflict of interest with George. God, I still can’t believe – George, of all people.” She sat back down in her chair, covering her face with her hands. Harry nodded as he looked down at his arms squeezing himself tight. After a moment, Hermione lowered her hands, wiping away the tears that had welled up in her eyes. She turned to Harry with a weak smile. “How is Draco?” she asked. Harry smiled back.
Narcissa let out a soft chuckle. “Well,” she said, gesturing for him to follow Draco, “I hope you’re hungry. Breakfast is ready in the sunroom.”
“If you would desist disrobing me with your eyes,” he said, adding over Harry’s spluttering, “I’m not concealing anything, if that’s what you’re worried about. I’ve been perfectly law-abiding for the past five years, thank you very much.”
“Well,” Harry said, leaning back in his chair, “I will take that as a compliment.”
“You like Malfoy, don’t you?” Ron asked gently.
Without another word, Harry wrapped in his arms, they Apparated into the gathering night.
Draco’s blush darkened until his cheeks were completely crimson. He came down the stairs, stopping on the last step as Harry strode over to him, his hand trailing on the banister. He bit his lip to hold back his pleased smile and draped his arms around Harry’s neck. The robe was made of a heavy wool, and it itched slightly against Harry’s palms as he rested them on Draco’s narrow hips.
“Uncle Harry, if you’re dating my cousin, does that make him my uncle?”
“No, I mean – Dumbledore must have known. To room the two of us together.”
“Parkinson?” Harry’s hands paused in Draco’s hair.
“There’s nothing you can do,” she said with a small shake of her head. “Just make sure he doesn’t kill my grandson this weekend. Then I will hear what Teddy thinks of him, and you know Teddy.”
“And who do you think attacked Draco when he was sixteen? When, mind you, he was still at Hogwarts, and recently marked as a Death Eater?”
“I assume this was after I left the room?” Draco pointed out, raising an eyebrow. Harry shrugged.
“What? What for?” he demanded. He hesitated, then asked suspiciously, “What did you
“This is a lot to take in,” Draco said slowly. Harry hummed. “I can’t imagine what you’ve been going through,” he added, cradling Harry against his chest, burying his nose in Harry’s curls. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pressed his forehead against Draco’s collarbone. “But we’ll figure it out. Together. Okay?”
Malfoy flinched at the name. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Then Malfoy uncrossed his arms and shoved his hands into the pockets of his trousers. “Then what are you going to do?” he asked, his eyes flicking to the locked door before looking back at Harry, as if expecting someone to rip open the door and proclaim him a traitor.
“Anything, please, anything.”
Draco looked up from the book he was pretending to read when he heard the knock on the door. He frowned. Had Pansy forgotten something? She had been by earlier that night, commiserating with Draco over a bottle of wine older than both of them combined. It had been a week since the fiasco at Potter’s, and while he had insisted to Pansy that he was
“George Weasley?” he said at last, his voice hoarse. “Are you certain? George Weasley?”
“What do you suggest?” Draco asked. He scowled and poked at his paneer tikka masala with his fork. “We can’t fight everyone who sends me a death threat. I know, I dealt with this shit after my trial for almost a year.”
Draco’s eyes flicked up to it as if seeing for the first time. He reached out a finger, seemingly unaware of his own movements, and brushed the scar with his fingertip. Harry held his breath. The way Draco leaned over him slightly as Harry lay there on the bed, the lightest touch of his fingertip against his skin, made Harry’s heart thrum in his chest. Heat coiled in his belly. There again was that tug, immediate now and insistent. Here. Here was what he wanted. Here was what he could not have.
“Hey, yourself,” Draco said, his voice a little rougher than he intended. He cleared his throat and turned to face Harry just as the other man crossed the room towards him. Within seconds, Harry’s hands were in his hair, and Draco was pulling him closer, lips not yet meeting as they breathed each other in. Draco’s minty cologne mixed with Harry’s more smoky smell, like a sharp wind on a winter morning, pine trees and frozen sap under the first snowfall. They leaned their foreheads together, both trying to get their heart rates under control.
Draco bit his lip as something broke in those moon-grey eyes. Then, he murmured, “Don’t punch me,” and kissed him.
“…I wouldn’t mind that at all.”
His name had been Voldemort. In the language of the nobles, it quite literally meant “thief of Death.”
“Why not?”
Draco made a rude gesture, which she pretended not to see. “Make your own damn tea,” he mumbled. He picked up his bag and slouched off to his room, where he definitely did not write several drafts of a letter before sending a simple – ‘Next Saturday. 8pm. The Drowned Siren. Don’t be late. DM.’ He watched his grey owl fly off into the late afternoon sky with a scowl. He regretted a lot of things in his life, but this took the cake.
“Good. Now that that’s settled,” she sat back down, exhausted. “I’m going on maternity leave in a few weeks, and I would appreciate it if you two were on your best behaviours rather than going at it like a bunch of knuckle-headed teenagers. But I must warn you, Harry,” she added, pointing a warning finger at him, “if I even get the slightest hint that Malfoy is up to no good, I won’t hesitate. You understand?”
Oh. Oh no.
Draco blushed. He wore a set of sleeveless charcoal grey robes that buttoned up to his throat over his pale, cornflower blue button-down and dark, well-tailored trousers. His hair was pushed back off his forehead, the ends curling slightly. He fidgeted with the heavy silver signet ring on his right hand under Harry’s gaze as he stood on the landing.
about how many people we’re inviting to our wedding. The whole restaurant was staring at us.” He sighed, his shoulders slumping. “Every time we talk about the wedding, I become less and less sure any of it is a good idea.”
“What did I do?” he squawked. She shook her head. She watched the odd pair’s retreating backs – Harry dark with his black hair and Sirius’s old leather jacket, Draco pale, thin and elegant beside him – and let out another long sigh.
Draco sat on the ground, his back against the wall beside the open door. Where the light hit him, he almost disappeared, the summer sun shining right through him. But Harry could still make out his eyes, cold and clear like the dawn. Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
“You mean later today?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh.” Draco nuzzled into Harry’s curls, squeezed him close. “I’m sorry.”
“What happened between you and the girl Weasley?” he asked. He stared at his glass, his blush blooming across his cheeks. Harry’s heart hitched in his chest. He swallowed and set his butterbeer on the floor before drawing his knees up into his chest, the soles of his feet pressed into the edge of the window seat.
Draco looked up and met Dumbledore’s gaze. Dumbledore nodded once. Draco sighed. He reached out and caught Harry’s wrist as he passed him in his pacing, pulling him to a halt with a soft, “Harry.”
“Yes, my father may have deserved to die,” Draco continued. “But that was not for your brother to decide. He had cancer, did you know that? My mother told me last November. I hadn’t talked to him in years, not after everything, and not even that would have swayed me if Pansy hadn’t convinced me that I would regret it for the rest of my life.
“Oh?” Father Nicola turned slightly to face him. “What is it, then?”
“Kids! If I see any of you in the air, I’m taking the brooms away until Christmas!”
Ron nodded to himself. He tapped the steering wheel with his fingers. They turned onto the drive leading up to the farm in silence. Then, Harry turned to Ron and asked, “Midsummer’s this weekend, right?”
Harry stood, pulling Draco with him towards the bed, helping him out of his still wet clothes along the way until he was only wearing his pants. They tumbled onto the bed, tangled together, all kisses and searching hands. Draco sucked a love bite into the curve of Harry’s neck, and Harry threw his head back to give him better access, all the while grinding up against the other man, desperate for friction. Several more love bites later, Harry pulled Draco back up for a deep kiss, if only so that he could flip them over and pin the other man beneath him. He pulled away. Draco looked wrecked, his pupils blown wide, his hair a mess, his cheeks flushed and his lips bruised. They both tried to catch their breaths as they stared at each other, waiting for the other to move.
Harry, startled by Malfoy’s blatant honesty, let out a chuckle. “So you just fancied a cup of tea with your old school rival?” he asked.
“I’m not going to stay long,” Draco reminded Pansy, “I’m just here for – ”
His shoulders slumped.
Potter barked out a laugh. Draco’s smile grew, that awful warm feeling blooming in his chest the way it always did when he made Harry – no, Potter – laugh. Potter shook his head, still grinning.
Draco blinked, mulling this over, trying to think if he had heard anything about this in the news – but he and his mother had stopped reading
But Draco only laughed and pulled back further, tipping his head back to grin at the heavens above them. Harry’s scowl deepened, but there was a playful light in his green eyes, curling at the corners of his mouth. Draco stepped back, grinning and grabbing hold of Harry’s hands to tug him along as he walked backwards towards one of the benches set out for classes. He sat down and pulled Harry onto his lap, beaming up at him. He plucked Harry’s glasses from his head and set them down on the bench next to them with careful and delicate movements. Harry’s blooming heart grew, pushing itself against his sternum, his throat, threatening to spill out of his mouth. Instead, he cradled Draco’s head in his hands and pulled him in for another kiss.
“Oh, no, he’s still a git,” Harry reassured her. Draco scowled and kicked him in the leg. “Ow! Merlin, it was a joke,” Harry hissed at him.
lay on top of Molly’s quilt. He was almost done, and Draco had already put the second book underneath the cot for when Harry was ready. He had warned Draco that if he asked Harry what he thought about the book one more time, he’d chuck the book at him. He reached out, brushed his fingers across the well-loved cover that curled up at the corners. Draco’s gaze was heavy on his skin, but still Harry was silent, unable to get the words right in his head.
Andromeda looked from Teddy to Harry and rolled her eyes. “You are a bad influence, Harry James Potter,” she said, pointing at him with a warning finger. Harry shrugged.
Down the hall, Harry thought he could hear Ron and Hermione calling his name. He turned his head to look. There they were again, and this time he could make out his name clearly as his friends called for him.
Pansy shrugged, already bored of the topic. “Don’t know, don’t care,” she said. “Can’t imagine he’ll stay in London, seeing as there’s nothing for him here anymore.”
Potter’s nose crinkled as his shit-eating grin grew. “Yeah, you don’t seem like the running type,” he said. He stepped a little closer, plucking at Draco’s thermal jacket. “This is nice, though.”
“So teach,” said Draco, pressing a kiss to Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sure you’d be wonderful, and everyone at Hogwarts would love to have you.”
“Because it’s okay, if you are.”
spell, his arms bound to his sides by the heavy ropes, he seemed to have resigned himself to his situation. He had drawn his knees up and rested the back of his head against the wall, his features thrown into sharp relief by the exposed strip lighting above them. The two of them looked anywhere but at each other as the minutes ticked by. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much to look at. The flat, much to the Aurors’ despair, was completely bare – not the stock room of a drug lord but a random meeting place, no stacks of contraband potions but a shocked Malfoy and a back door swinging open on its hinges. They had missed the suspect by seconds.
Harry and Draco shared a glance. “About a month?” Harry suggested.
Draco walked away in a daze. What was he supposed to do now? He had no idea where Harry lived. He supposed he could go to Pansy and ask to borrow her owl – but no, her owl had passed away last Christmas. He couldn’t send a Patronus – no matter how hard he’d tried, he could never get so much as a wisp of white smoke. He couldn’t just show up at the Ministry and demand to see Harry Potter – could he? He picked up his pace, turning towards a quiet alleyway to Disapparate in. To the Ministry it was.
Harry just had enough brain power left to set the book on the bedside table before Draco crawled on top of him, straddling his hips. Harry, pulling away to gasp for air as he grabbed the other boy’s thin waist, protested weakly, “Draco, the door’s still open.”
“Really? Great! I know just the place.”
“To be fair, you didn’t miss much, it was pretty shit,” said Harry. “Anyway, they’ve had this other professor teaching Potions, an Angharad Williams? No, I haven’t heard of her either, but apparently she’s quite good. And, well, I asked if maybe you could apprentice with her, and McGonagall said she’d look into it. I should have her answer in the next couple of days.”
“I’m proud of you,” he murmured. “Have you thought of what you’re going to do next? It’s okay if you don’t have a plan just yet.”
They both collapsed on top of each other, sticky and sweaty and out of breath. Harry just had enough in him to pull off his trousers and pants and put his glasses on the bedside table before casting a quick cleaning spell and settling back against Draco. He cuddled against Draco’s chest, their legs tangled together and Draco’s arms around him. They lay there in the soft silence, listening to their breaths slow and deepen as they drifted off to sleep.
“Piers, you don’t have to do this,” Draco said, his voice surprisingly cool and level. “You can write to your father or the press all you want…”
“I wanted to thank you,” he said slowly, his gaze focused on the dirt beneath his feet. “For speaking at my trial.”
“Oh, I’m Malfoy now?”
“Dobby, prepare a chamber for Sir Potter. He is to stay on as a counsellor while I investigate the situation further. Then call a meeting of my privy council for tomorrow morning. And all of you,” he turned to the guards, “none of the information you have heard leaves this room, do you understand?”
“You overstepped the minute you came into my place of work,” Draco retaliated. “You overstepped when you had the gall to ask me here. You’ve overstepped your whole life, why should I expect you to do any different?”
“Mad? No, I’m not mad,” Narcissa said hurriedly. She paused. “Okay, maybe a little mad. How long has this been going on?”
Harry nodded sheepishly. Hermione let out a long, bereaved sigh. “Good,” she said. “Now, can we please finish our breakfast in peace?”
Without missing a beat, Draco said, his cold, quiet voice cutting through the court room,
“Huh. So, then, what’s your favourite film? Not that I’d know any, I’ve never seen one.”
“Alright. That’s fine. Now, Wilkins, could you walk me through what happened today? As much as you can.”
Harry nodded. Without another word, they Apparated, leaving the early morning commuters to go about their day as usual.
He gestured for Malfoy to stay put and cast a quick revealing spell. Nothing. He did a diagnostic spell, checking for any dark magic. Nothing. He made his way further into the flat, opening the door to a small bathroom and poking his head in, repeating the spells. Still clear.
Malfoy began to help himself to toast and jam as conversation resumed around him. Harry caught McGonagall’s eye. She nodded pointedly at Malfoy with a raised eyebrow. Harry huffed but leaned forward to get Malfoy’s attention.
Draco’s brow furrowed. “Tetsuo?” he asked. Harry shrugged. “That was ages ago. It didn’t even last that long.” Tetsuo, it turned out, was great in bed, but was even more emotionally cold than Draco – they ended up freezing each other out. He was the one who had found the mouse remains in his shoes. “Who even told – Pansy.” He shook his head with a twisted smile. He was going to kill her for letting out that titbit of information. For now, though, he pulled Harry in for a chaste kiss. “I’ve missed you every day,” he murmured against his lips, their noses brushing. Harry beamed.
Dumbledore watched the exchange with a knowing glint in his eye. When Harry reached over to interlace his fingers with Draco’s again, Dumbledore had to stifle his grin. He gestured instead for Draco to continue. He nodded along as Draco explained everything he had planned to do with the Vanishing Cabinet, all the while examining their two young faces. There was a light in Harry’s that Dumbledore had never seen before. It was like a rising sun, clear and unabashedly bright to the point that he had to look away lest he be blinded by it. Dumbledore considered his gnarled hands, his blackened left hand a constant reminder of his own mistakes. His expression grew weary and contemplative. Harry, turning to see how Dumbledore reacted to Draco’s plan for the Death Eaters to infiltrate the castle, narrowed his eyes at the look on Dumbledore’s face.
Fifteen minutes later, Hermione made her way out of the fireplace and into the kitchen, cradling a massive tome around the swell of her pregnant belly. She slammed the book down on the kitchen table where the three of them sat, Harry and Draco on one side and Ginny on the other, staring at the ring on her finger with glazed eyes. Hermione huffed in exasperation.
Before Draco could say anything else, Harry was kissing him. They rutted together, gasping into each other’s mouths, Draco slipping a hand down to the cleft of Harry’s arse. Harry pulled back with a laugh.
“So, Malfoy,” he said, trying to think of something to talk about. Malfoy looked up from spreading apricot jam across his toast in faint surprise. “Er, how was the trip up?”
“That wasn’t so bad,” he said with a hint of his old drawl. “The way you were going on, I was expecting tears.”
Harry’s brow furrowed as he moved to put his phone back in the pocket of his leather jacket. “God, I wish,” he said, the words out before he realized what he said. His eyes widened. “I mean, what? No, that was Malfoy. He’s helping me on a case.”
“We didn’t say that,” Hermione said quietly. “We’re just worried, is all.”
“Oh hush.”
“You know, don’t you?” Draco grumbled. “What, you want my signed confession?” He rocked back onto his heels, out of Harry’s arms even as Harry unconsciously reached for him. Realising what he was doing, Harry let his arms fall uselessly to his sides, his cheeks blazing under Draco’s curious gaze. Harry let out a small huff.
Harry held him tighter. He turned his head a little to press a kiss to Draco’s forehead. “We can deal with that later,” he murmured. Draco’s lips twitched, and the hand resting on Harry’s hip palmed the length of his waist.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked. Draco didn’t have to look up, he heard the smile more than he could see it.
“What, you don’t think I’m good enough for someone like that?”
“There better not be any spiders,” he grumbled, wiping the snot away with the back of his hand. Hermione, the girl, rolled her eyes, her bushy hair bouncing as she looked over her shoulder at him.
, because what it comes down to in the end is understanding that the War of the Ring is only one thread in this greater tapestry.” Draco sat back with an exhausted sigh and took a swig of butterbeer, only to make a face because it had grown warm. Harry sniggered.
was the one who got us into this situation, not you! What the hell do you mean, you wanted to give me the option? What option? I chose
Harry closed the sliding glass door behind him as he considered Malfoy. “Right,” he said. “Sorry, I just… I was surprised, is all.” Why did Malfoy have to be there, why couldn’t the balcony have been empty when all he wanted was to be alone for a moment’s peace? The balcony in question was not large, maybe about a square metre, just enough space for a small round table in one corner and two men to stand next to each other. Harry leaned over the railing, his arms crossed and shoulders hunched, trying to ignore Malfoy’s heavy gaze on him. He closed his eyes and tried to breathe.
There was a collective gasp from the gallery.
Harry jumped. Malfoy’s lips quirked into a smile, his grey eyes twinkling with laughter. Harry put his hand over his racing heart with a sharp exhale.
“Enjoying the décor?” Malfoy asked with a hint of his old sneer. Harry put his wand in his pocket as he considered his response.
“Robards wants you to look at the Greek file again,” said Potter. He gave Draco an apologetic look as he set the file down on a clean lab table. “Apparently he thinks your report isn’t hard enough proof, although Merlin knows why. Your work speaks for itself.”
Two days later, just when Harry had been notified that Narcissa had woken up from her coma, he arrived to find St. Mungo’s in an uproar. Someone had come in to Narcissa’s room, somehow unnoticed by the security outside and undetected by the wards around the room, and killed her before disappearing without a trace. Harry interrogated the staff, the security detail, everyone. He checked all the wards. No one had seen anything. The wards were still in place. And Narcissa Malfoy was dead.
“It’s fine, really. Nothing I haven’t heard before,” he said, his voice just above a whisper. He heard the rustle of bedsheets and looked up in time to meet Malfoy’s gaze over the wall as the other boy sat up in bed.
“Never knew what to say,” he mumbled. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry scoff and shake his head.
Bathilde’s jaw dropped. Harry, blinking furiously, had turned a dangerous shade of crimson. Draco grinned. Perfect.
Ron’s eyes widened and Draco chuckled. “Oh, it’s not so bad. There’s an infestation of gnomes in your hedge and he’s helping clear them out. And – God damn it, Potter!”
Harry looked up from slicing the aubergine. “He’s your cousin, you could see him at any time, you know.”
Malfoy choked on his rice.
Harry stumbled. He cursed, and half-considered pulling his trousers back on. From what he could see, however, Malfoy’s back was turned. He let out a sigh and tossed the trousers towards the closet with the rest. Just in his boxers, he made his way to his bed, not trying to be as quiet as before.
“Ron!”
Slowly, Harry’s breath began to even out. His grip on the back of Draco’s shirt relaxed. He sniffled.
“Fuck that,” Harry growled. “I didn’t come back to life to care about what other people think. I
Harry’s lips were soft and dry. Before he could even begin to appreciate this, however, something sparked through him like lightning, followed by the sudden and uncomfortable feeling of being tugged by a hook behind the navel. When they opened their eyes with a gasp, they were still in Harry’s kitchen, Draco’s head still cradled in Harry’s wonderful warm hands. But the world seemed to have shifted beneath their feet, as if they had been caught in each other’s orbits, like magnets finally finding their pole. Draco could breathe easier, a weight he never knew existed lifted from his shoulders. From Harry’s wide eyes and glowing expression, he felt the same.
“I thought you fancied Cho Chang,” he said. Harry gave a one-shoulder shrug and swallowed.
Harry’s grip tightened on his wrist, cutting him off. The tears shone in his eyes, emerald sparkling behind the glasses.
“Do you want it to be?” Malfoy asked instead of answering.
“Well, I don’t know about the ladies,” he said, “but we were betting on when you were finally going to make this shit official. Oi, Hermione!”
This time, it was Draco who rose and made his way over to Harry. He pulled the other man to his feet and angled his face just so, Harry’s arms around his waist as he buried his hands in Harry’s hair, their lips meeting and sending a spark through both of them. This time, instead of pulling apart at the shock, they let it carry them through, the kiss deepening, slow and tender even as they held each other closer. When Harry’s lips moved to Draco’s jaw, to his neck, they were both trembling as wave after wave crashed into them, their emotions, their wants and needs and desires unleashed. Draco felt everything Harry did, the thrill and the heartbreak, the relief and the joy, the loss and the discovery, all at once. And he knew, he knew Harry felt everything he did, because Harry murmured in his ear, “I’m here now.” They kissed the tears that fell down each other’s cheeks, whispered promises as hands explored skin, found each other’s lips again and again as night began to drape its pale curtain around them.
“Hello, Malfoy,” he said carefully. “Can – can I help you with something?”
“Well, maybe it was someone else then, maybe the same person who attacked Draco when he was sixteen?” Jenkins suggested in a small voice. Harry’s lips twitched into a cold, crooked smile.
“I’m fine, Neville,” Harry said, a little too loudly. A couple of the teachers and even some students looked over at him. He sighed and lowered his voice as he added, “All he said in his note was that his mother had called. I don’t know, I guess I’m just worried something’s happened.”
“2008.”
Malfoy levelled a look at Harry as if to ask, ‘seriously?’ “Which do you think?” he asked pointedly.
It was a few kilometres into town, and another mile or so beyond to the manor. By the time Harry found himself on the old towpath towards the manor, his feet were sore and the sun had climbed high into the clear blue sky. He sat down on a rotting stump to drink his water and eat one of the apples he had brought with him as he wiped the sweat from his brow. His T-shirt stuck to his back, and a bead of sweat trickled down the valley of his spine. His knobbly knees stuck out from his well-worn cargo shorts, the black hair of his legs curling in the heat. His shoes were caked in mud and dust. He put away his water bottle, tossed the apple core into the undergrowth, and shrugged on his rucksack once more. There was no turning back now.
Hermione nodded. She narrowed her eyes, tapping a finger against her cup. “Maybe you should start from the beginning,” she said. She took a sip of her tea and waited. Harry adjusted his glasses as he shook his head with a small smile. The tables had turned.
Draco hated running. His feet hurt, his knees hurt, his chest hurt, everything hurt. But it was halfway through January and the only progress he had made on his resolution to exercise more was to buy some new work out clothes. So, that morning, he’d screwed himself up and went for a run. Or, he tried to. It was more of a painful jog down the pavement at this point. He stumbled to a stop in the middle of a small park, hands on his low back as he looked up at the grey London sky, the freezing winter air burning in his lungs. Good lord, he was out of shape. He closed his eyes as he tried to catch his breath, wishing he had taken Blaise’s offer to spend a week in the Zabini villa outside of Turin, drinking wine and basking in the Italian sun. In his mind, it was always summer in Italy.
“Because you’re you,” he said. “You always get what you want.”
Draco smirked at the dawning realisation on Hermione’s face. He shifted and drew his knees up in front of him, settling in for what he knew was going to be a long conversation.
Draco groaned at the prospect. Blaise grinned, apparently sharing the sentiment, but Pansy nudged them both in the ribs and told them to grow up and have fun, which sounded like an oxymoron to Draco. Chuckling, he turned to the bartender to order his whiskey. He blushed slightly when he recognised the bartender, a burly man with a well-trimmed beard, from a one night stand he’d had about six months back. The bartender winked at him but said nothing as he poured him two fingers of whiskey.
“No, no, God, no, it’s because Harry is like my brother and I just don’t want to hear about my brother having sex, alright? Christ on a bike, I’m just going to go. Oh look, I think Ron just got home, I’ll talk to you later, alright? Unless – Harry, do you want to talk to Ron?”
“I’ll have to add ‘sneaking up on the Saviour of the Wizarding World’ to my CV,” said Draco, a proud bounce in his step. Harry snorted.
“Promises, promises,” he murmured, before kneeling down between Harry’s legs. When Harry came, Draco swallowed it all. Harry pulled him up into another sloppy, open-mouthed kiss before breaking away.
Harry shook his head. “No,” he choked out as he reminded himself to breathe. “No, it’s perfect. You’re perfect.”
Harry took off his glasses, pressing the heels of his hands to his forehead with a strangled moan. “God, fine, just, fuck!” He fell to his knees, kneeling on the threadbare rug as he tried to keep his head from splitting apart.
Harry nodded. He watched the man leave, weaving his way through the crowded café. There was a small twinge of regret in his gut – Harry had to admit, the man looked good in those tight trousers, and Hermione had been so keen for this date to go well. In the end, however, they simply had nothing to talk about. Harry shook his head and reached for his drink, only to remember that his cup was empty.
It had begun to snow. Like the night before, the flake were big and fluffy, falling petals of ice tossed about by a playful wind. Draco scowled at the heavens. Harry laughed. Startled, Draco looked down just in time to see Harry stick out his tongue and catch a snowflake.
“Normally, yes,” said Draco with a wry smile. “But I’m a special kind of ghost, I guess. Most of the time, no one can see me. But four times a year – Midsummer, Hallowe’en, the winter solstice and Beltane, as far as I can tell – people can see me. I become sort of… real, again. I mean….” He wandered over to the fireplace. He raised an eyebrow at Harry, making sure he was watching as he put a hand on the mantle. Then, he pressed down, and his whole hand went straight through. Harry gasped.
Harry fell to his knees in the empty room. He called Draco’s name, over and over again, until it became a lament, a prayer, a whisper. There was no one there to hear him. He buried his face in his hands, rocked back on his heels, and wept.
Harry let out a soft chuckle, one hand coming up to cover Draco’s, which only served to make Draco’s knees shake. “We both know that’s not true. You wouldn’t kill a fly.”
“Oh, Malfoy was really paranoid about the Floos,” he said, setting a cup of coffee in front of her on the kitchen table. “So I closed that one off for the time being.”
“That’s okay, it’s just the fireplace, there isn’t a fire in it, it’s okay. Harry, focus on my voice, alright?” He waited for Harry to nod, for his eyes to open again, their green depths swallowed by black pupils. Draco bit his lip. He reached out and took Harry’s hands in his, gripping them tight. Harry froze for a moment. Then, as Draco began to stroke the back of his hands with his thumbs, he saw Harry’s shoulders relax, his eyelids lower. “One more thing, okay?” Draco said gently. “What can you taste? Just one thing.”
“I refuse to spend even a second in the same room as the creep!”
!” Draco let out a muffled yelp as his nose snapped back into place.
“Promise me, Harry,” he said in a hushed voice. “Promise me you will never try to raise the dead.”
“It was bound to happen at some point,” he said. “Either I came here, or you would come bang down the door to Grimmauld Place. I just had the wards reset, so I decided to come to you.”
Draco, reeling, sat back in his chair as he let Pansy’s words sink in. “Wait, you said they were both in love with someone else? Who’s Har – I mean, Potter with?” He hoped she would chalk his slip up to the alcohol, but the way her eyes narrowed told him otherwise. His stomach sank, even as a small piece of him waited with bated breath for her reply. Not that he expected Harry to go and proclaim his love for him to the world – it had been years. Not just since
“Who punched you, anyway?” Draco asked. One of his hands fluttered up, as if to try and touch, to check the broken nose. There was a slight crease between his brows, a frown tugging at his mouth. Harry shrugged.
“I can’t tell you that,” Harry said softly. “But I have to ask – do you know if any of the Death Eater’s knew of or used that spell besides Snape?”
Malfoy choked on his tea. Harry laughed as Malfoy tried to mop up his mess while trying to keep a straight face. Malfoy shook his head, chuckling to himself. “What about you, Potter?” he asked after he managed to straighten himself up and Harry had gotten out his giggles. “Can’t imagine dating as a professor is particularly easy, given the small dating pool, even if you are the Chosen One.”
While Malfoy began pulling clothes out of the dresser and adjoining closet and placing them neatly into a vintage leather suitcase, Harry examined the stack of books on the nightstand. Many had spines so cracked it was hard to make out their titles, and others were thick with sticky notes and bookmarks. It was an odd mix – classic literature with gold-leaf embossing, Muggle history books, and –
“So,” Malfoy said, echoing Harry, “not enjoying being an Auror as much as you thought you would?”
Weeks passed before Harry saw Ron again. He had asked after him when Hermione showed up alone to his birthday party, but she had only shook her head with a sad smile. “Give him time,” she said. But now August was almost over, and Harry was starting to wonder if he was ever going to see his friend again.
After Kellen’s testimony, the judge, a portly woman with thick black hair and a stern face lined with wrinkles, called Draco to the witness box. A wave of hushed whispers ripped through the court room as he went. George followed Draco’s movements, a nasty curl to his lips. Harry’s heart broke in two. He dug his nails into his palms, desperate to feel anything but this.
“So you
“Did you guys see that?” he gasped. But Ron and Hermione had uncovered a piano and were playing around on the yellowed keys. Hermione plucked out bits of
There was a loud crack, and Robards’ office window shattered. Harry squeezed his eyes shut. He was definitely going to get fired.
Teddy swallowed hard, his prominent Adam’s apple bobbing. His hair turned bubble gum pink, even the pale downy moustache forming on his upper lip. Draco narrowed his eyes – when Teddy hit puberty, his ability to change his hair had started to be affected by his emotions, flaring into all sorts of colours just as unpredictably as his teenage moods. Draco knew what pink meant, though. Teddy was embarrassed about something.
Harry shrugged. He held his hand out for his receipt. “He picked it, not me. If it ends badly, as I’m sure it will, I promise I won’t blame it on you.”
Draco frowned, his shoulders hunching in as he leaned forward, bony elbows digging into bony knees. His mother hadn’t said anything about how thin he had become, only pursed her lips and pushed a plate of mince pies towards him during tea. But he couldn’t bring himself to eat much. For the task he was set, what he was meant to do – he didn’t deserve to eat, to indulge in food and drink. He was a would-be murderer, and murderers didn’t deserve to feast.
“Harry is dating – get this – Draco Malfoy,” she announced to her husband. Ron dropped his toast.
“Does Weasley know you’re here… with me?” Draco added, looking down at his whiskey. Harry bit his lip. There was a softness to Draco’s voice he had never heard before, and instinctively he wanted to protect it, covet it. He took another sip of his beer.
But, much to Harry’s confused surprise, Draco hurried off to the boys’ dormitories. Later, when Harry himself went up to bed, he found Draco curled up in a tight ball under his sheets. Judging by the shallow rise and fall of his ribs, he was only pretending to be asleep. Harry sighed. He’d figure out what was going on with him eventually.
Harry straightened up. He crossed his arms over his broad chest as he appraised Draco, his lips thin. He nodded curtly. “Right,” he said. “I see. You’re happy, are you?”
Draco waited for her to continue. She didn’t.
Scorpius’s ear twitched. Draco gave a startled chuckle. He finally managed to move, setting the tray down on the coffee table and sitting on the couch next to Harry so that he could give Scorpius a little head scritch. In the corner of his eye, he registered that Harry had taken off his leather jacket, revealing his short sleeves and golden-brown arms. Scorpius stretched and settled down to sleep. Draco shook his head in absolute astonishment.
Teddy barrelled out of the living room fireplace, squealing, “Uncle Harry! Uncle Harry!” Harry knelt down, spreading his arms wide for Teddy to collide into him. Draco stood a couple feet away, unsure and fidgety. Teddy noticed him over Harry’s shoulder almost at the same time that Andromeda unfolded herself from the fireplace.
They were quiet for a long while as they drank their tea. Malfoy finished the plate of biscuits, so Harry got more. When he sat back down, biting back a grin when Malfoy’s hand shot out to steal a digestive, he came back to the same question.
“What do you know about the Malfoys, Junior Auror Jenkins?” Harry asked in a cool, neutral tone, like a teacher asking a student to show his work.
Harry chuckled and got out of his chair so that Draco could slide in. He gave Draco a quick kiss on the top of his head before making his way over and dropping into the empty chair next to Ron.
Harry smiled and shook his head as he stood. He had to hand it to the king, he certainly had a flair for the dramatic.
“My lords.”
“Don’t worry about it. I saw this in a shop when I was visiting Mother’s family in Provence and thought of you. It’s nothing,” said Draco, rushing through the words as if he had rehearsed them. Harry focused on unwrapping the package, hoping Draco couldn’t see his blush. He let out a small gasp when the wrapping fell away.
One day, Potter came into his office where Draco was writing up his case report and deposited himself into the chair opposite Draco’s desk before promptly burying his head in his arms on top of Draco’s files. Draco looked him over before returning to his report.
