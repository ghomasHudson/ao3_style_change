you… no one´s ever…” Draco closed his eyes as Harry leaned closer to lick his lips gently, his hand running over the hard bulge between them.
“Fuck yeah, Harry, you show that Slytherin scum who´s the man!” Dean and Seamus both shouted in encouragement and Harry gave them a grin before opening Malfoy´s pants, making sure the others wouldn´t be able to see Malfoy´s disgusting prick.
“You should go; we don´t mind," Blaise encouraged. "We helped ourselves before coming here, in fact.”
Harry´s hips rose again, and again. Over and over, Harry kept fucking Goyle´s very willing mouth. He would have to think later, why any Slytherin would offer him pleasure willingly, but hey he was a teenage guy, on the verge of coming clean about being at least bisexual, so like hell he was going to turn down this kind of spectacular blowjob.
“He was surrounded by hate and traditions which were not up for discussion.He had no siblings, no friends, and no allies. Could he really have turned out any different? I am not so sure he could. I pity him in fact.”
Harry snorted. “We only wanked each other off, and he liked to blow me but I told him I didn´t want sex, not with
“Malfoy, get your tiny body up here.” The room went wild as Harry challenged the Malfoy heir. Harry met the grey orbs, and only swayed a little on the spot while trying to act not at all affected by the amount of beer he had consumed.
Harry was about to die, so he would bloody die acknowledging the truth. Even when Malfoy was as straight as they came.
Harry moaned loudly and seconds after he screamed as much as he could with a mouth full of cock pumping in and out of him. Draco met Finnegan´s eyes and nodded and Harry was flooded from behind and the front at the same time. He swallowed greedily what his friend offered, and groaned at the losses when both Seamus and Draco dropped out of him, and fell onto the bed, spent.
“Try it, before knocking it down. Give it and Potter a chance. To my knowledge he´s never dated men either,” he said.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a voice rang out, cutting off Voldemort´s; obviously. It travelled with the use of a Sonorus, making it impossible to make out from where it came. “Then how about a trade with Harry Potter?”
“Mr. Potter, you may come forth to give deliver your speech,” he heard the man instruct, and Harry did.
“Bring it, Malfoy.” Harry walked away and Malfoy waited a minute before moving toward his next class.
“Noo… you wouldn´t…” Harry´s entire body shook and he looked to the floor. He blinked away the tears he could feel dropping softly. Tears of sorrow, tears of confusion, tears of anger.
Harry nodded and she left him alone, silently shutting the door after her before returning to the others.
didn´t have to cook for your family, and god help you if you ever complained or asked a damn question…” Harry yelled, then stopped when he realized his mistake.
“No need for that, Mr. Weasley.” They both startled and swung around and found Narcissa there. “Dragon…” She walked to her son. “Go to him.”
“One can never be too careful. I have to marry someday, and nobody wants a slobby husband.” Grey eyes surveyed Greg´s body, “And like you would know anything about it anyway. Everything
“Are you okay? You look rather pale. More than usual. Maybe you should sit down,” someone said, and guided him to a chair, which he took. It would not look good should he faint. A hand on his left cheek woke him with a start from his trance. “Tell me what´s wrong, Draco.”
Draco slid a thumb across Harry´s lips and Draco could feel the unshaven skin covering the chin. “I never had a clue about being gay until seeing your arse in the damn shower, and those dreams began tormenting me every damn night afterwards.” He heard Harry laugh. “At first I tossed the idea, calling it
“A compliment. Tut. That´s so unlike you.” Harry´s free hand went through Malfoy´s locks, causing the older male to glare.
“Your first pathetic attempt cursed a fellow student, a female, to my knowledge.” He met Snape´s gaze, who nodded at the silently asked confirmation. “The second,” the Dark Lord laughed, “Was almost amusing. Having the best friend of Harry Potter on the brink of death.” He stopped walking. “Pity Potter saved him. I should have enjoyed knowing another died for their friend.” He looked up at the sky before going on. “Lastly, Severus had to finish the job for you, because you were too weak to do so, even if the Headmaster was wandless.” He ignored the angry shouts coming from the light´s side.
…” He kept thrusting harder and harder, becoming more turned on by the second hearing the way Harry was gagging violently on his stick as he fucked his mouth. Saliva dripped down Harry´s face and Draco nearly came seeing it. “Fucking hell yes… take my cock…”
War changes people, sometimes for the worse sometimes for the better. Lucius Malfoy knew getting along with Harry was his only chance to recover from the humiliation and social downfall his actions during the war had cost his family.
“Not what mate? Tell us. Help us understand, or at least try.” Ron´s hand went through his hair, and Harry smiled inwardly at his best friends´ calmness about him coming out. He had expected, well, not this.
“W-what?” Draco pulled away. “Y-you… wait… come on Harry… you´re…” He drew in a deep breath. “Harry Potter is not a virgin!”
Harry grabbed the Draco´s head forcefully and pushed his cock into his mouth again. Draco gagged, but didn´t complain, in fact, he resumed his task to suck off the most attractive man he had ever met. It wasn´t that Harry was stunningly beautiful, but his manly features, deep green eyes, thick, wild hair and
But Draco needn´t have bothered, because the only thing that happened, was Weasley´s outstretched hand waiting for Draco to grasp it. The young man that Draco had teased, cursed and ridiculed for years, was offering to help Draco up.
“Draco Malfoy first reached out the hand of friendship the day before our first year at Hogwarts, when we met at Madam Malkin´s Robes for all occasions. I was a lonely, miserable boy, who had never known friendship, and who had been bullied my entire life by my own family. And Draco seemed like just another bully to me when he went on and on about the purity of blood. So, naturally, I declined any sort of friendship he was offering to me.”
Hands cupped Draco´s handsome face. “I was attracted to you from second year, I just never wanted to admit to it, because you were such a mean git.” Draco tried to pull away just then, but Harry´s grip tightened and the other came up attempting to escape his grasp. “A gorgeous and sexy git, but still a git…”
The smile Harry offered Draco made him dizzy. So much passion had never been cast his way before; he swallowed and smiled back. He would have to get used to Harry´s reactions to him, but more importantly, he would have to work on his own reactions to Harry. He didn´t mind being honest and open when they were alone, but no Malfoy could risk it in public in fear of an enemy finding a weakness to use against him.
The two males stepped up beside Draco and led him through the large iron door in the very back of the room. As the door slammed shut, sparks let them know that the wards were up.
“Well, I learned growing up, as a pure-blood myself, that if a gay heir were to marry and refuse to wear the family name and take on his lover´s instead, then the rules can be bent slightly. He would have to still provide an heir or more with a woman, but he would not be forced to marrying her since he has submitted himself to another bloodline. That would satisfy his own bloodline´s need of continuing and, in the meantime, he could avoid marrying a woman, as his blood would still be the in heir he fathered. However, the woman would have to be a pureblood also.”
“Sooo, Harry…” She began as she turned to face her childhood friend and smiled. “Has something been bothering you lately?” she tried.
“You fucking BASTARD!” Ron grabbed Draco´s collar and pulled him up from his comfortable chair and threw him against the wall. “How dare you do that to Harry, he fucking loves you, you cold-hearted motherfucker, you stupid fucking… FUCKHOLE!”
“Come for me, Harry,” the other whispered and sucked harder. Harry´s dick exploded and every last drop of evidence was gone by the time Harry was capable of opening his eyes and meeting the brown orbs of the male who had offered him his first gay blowjob. Goyle smirked but didn´t stop licking Harry´s dick as he came down from his high, obviously prolonging his orgasm.
Harry grinned, Draco could see his face clearly this close, his eyes having gotten used to the thick darkness long ago.
The faculty was in such stunned disbelief, they had him do the exams again, which only gave him higher scores in the end.
Fred had been laid to rest three weeks ago, and a sorrow had cast its love on his beloved adoptive family, the Weasleys.
Harry rose and everyone stared as if the Savior had better things to do than to waste his time in the presence of a bawling infant. When Harry walked towards the Head table, murmurs of conversations began. Their new Muggle Studies professor rose and handed Harry the boy, who immediately nuzzled into him and fell asleep. To explain to those who were unaware, she said, “It seems convenient for an old woman to have the godfather of my grandchild in the same school, thank you, Harry.” Harry beamed and tightened his grip, not many 18-year-old males would want to be caught dead with such a small drooling pink raisin, but Harry loved his role and his godson.
She laughed. “Nah, why would he be jealous of your gorgeous self with you being gay and all?” She winked and they fell silent.
With his eyes closed and his mouth hanging slightly open, he mulled over his options. He knew he had a decision to make.
Neville was wounded, but that didn´t keep him from charging ahead when seeing Draco Malfoy lunging for the madman – and if Draco dared, well - yelling, “ATTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK.” And because Neville had been the one that had kept Hogwarts´ bravery and morale up while Hermione, Ron, and Harry had finished off almost the last of the Horcruxes, the students didn´t hesitate to draw their wands and run like a horde of crazy horses towards the astounded Death Eaters.
It was the first week of October before Harry knew it; that´s how fast the past week had gone by. The homework load had increased massively and Harry was mortified that he had to follow five NEWT level subjects: Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, and Care of Magical Creatures.
His lips and tongue seemed to know which way to go on their own and Harry sucked, not caring the others could see him kneeling. Of course, they could only see the fluffy cloud of the charm on his face while his head was bobbing up and down the divine dick.
"I don´t lie," Harry drew in a deep breath to calm himself. “People that should have loved me, but didn´t, lied to me all my life. I know what that feels like, and I wouldn´t do that to others. Not even to you, and definitely not now.” Harry turned away and ran his hand through his hair.
“I´m sure mother won´t mind – she´s always telling me how the house is too quiet. Plus, she nearly plotted with Weasley to bring me here to see you…” Harry blinked. “She was less than pleased with my behaviour.” He looked away so that Harry wouldn´t notice the small pink spots on his cheeks, but he noticed them.
Snape had also been put in the ground. Harry had paid for everything himself; it was how he had wanted it to be, after having watched those memories from his former professor many times. When he had finally shared his knowledge of the man nobody seemed to have known at all, he had been awarded the Order of Merlin, which was now resting safely on the mantelpiece beside Harry´s own here at Grimmauld Place.
Harry blinked as he stared down at the sitting blond. He looked like he owned the damn place all over again. His legs slightly apart, back straight and proud, one arm leaning against the side of the couch casually.
“Fancy seeing you here, Pretty Boy,” Harry´s head turned and he gripped his wand out of reflex seeing the two Slytherins standing in the doorway smirking at him. He stood up when Goyle and Malfoy walked into the room and Malfoy closed the door. “Lock it Dray.” Harry felt his heart jump into his throat.
Ron´s mouth fell open as he glared at Harry who simply shrugged; he shut it again and scowled. “Good choice. Now, while the answer is correct, that Aguamenti conjures water, it does not control it Mr. Longbottom, but keep trying.” She turned to Malfoy after that. “Mr. Malfoy, you seemed to have an answer to offer?”
Both Greg and Blaise were wanking silently and shared a look when they heard their friend moaning. This was not the first time they had done something like this together, they were best friends and furthermore Slytherins. They were also purebloods, and part of that, was that they would not be embarrassed in each other´s company.
Draco´s heart was pounding away inside his chest. He wondered when it would pop out from his body entirely; it
“Draco Malfoy first reached out the hand of friendship the day before our first year at Hogwarts when we met at Madam Malkin´s robes for all occasions. I was a lonely, miserable boy, who had never known friendship, and who had been bullied my entire life by my own family. And Draco seemed like just another bully to me when he went on and on about the purity of blood. So, naturally, I declined any sort of friendship he was offering to me.”
He cleared his throat nervously, keeping his eyes upon the chairman only, having used that method two days prior also to calm his nerves, to make sure that nobody could change his mind about speaking up. He could not take the looks he would receive from those who knew him.
mother, you know what I must do.” He paced the sitting area; his hands were clasped together behind his back, where they were still having tea and biscuits. Malfoys do not pace around a room like a bloody madman, not even gracefully. There were a lot of things Malfoys did not do, one of which would be refuse to take over the leadership of the bloodline.
Malfoy had been furious when his father had rewarded Hermione 20 points for her potion; and he himself had not even finished it in time. Harry had laughed so hard afterwards at that with his friends back in their common room.
Harry shivered, which did not go unnoticed by his friend, who had been silently studying him. “He seems changed, from before I mean.” Hermione wasn´t giving up just yet, it was her duty as Harry´s best friend, along with Ron, who was so not talking about Malfoy with Harry, not about
“How about a trade, Potter?” Harry blinked in confusion over the whispered words that only he could hear. “I give you my house points, if you
Murmurs began rising but Goldstein tried to silence them. “What do you mean when you say physical bravery?” The question came from Hermione Granger and everyone stilled.
Draco stood there another couple of minutes after Harry´s abrupt departure, clearing his head of immature thoughts of running after him. Draco´s chest constricted as he watched him leave. The man, Draco´s own body, mind and soul had been craving for years.
Blaise groaned when seeing Potter like this, all pretend-submissive. Judging from the Gryffindor´s wide grin when lifting himself onto the bed to join the others, he knew all about their plan to make him uncomfortable, which was clearly not working, for whatever reason. Blaise had to stop wanking so he wouldn´t come at that idea alone.
“For today´s lesson we are going to study a spell that creates and controls water. It may not seem like a Dark arts curse, but if mastered correctly and in the wrong hands, It might very well be. Does anyone know a spell that does just that?” Professor Weasley asked her class of Slytherin and Gryffindor eighth years, while she was facing them on this Monday morning. So many eighth years had chosen the class that they had to divide them in two.
Harry shivered when Draco pulled the forgotten pants all the way off from where they lay at Harry´s knees, followed by the red boxers.
Harry didn´t know for how long he had been sitting in a deserted classroom, it was in the first floor, and he had never visited it before. He stared wearily out the window at the autumn wind blow leaves around in a blur of red, yellow and brown. He
“On to Hufflepuff then. Hannah Abbott. Susan Bones. Justin Finch-Fletchley. Wayne Hopkins. Megan Jones. And Ernie Macmillan.”
The pink spots that appeared on Draco´s pale cheeks were enough to arouse Harry immediately and the way grey eyes shone made his heart beat faster. Harry made his voice husky and ran his tongue briefly over Draco´s earlobe.
Draco did, and while keeping eye contact, Harry yanked down the trousers. Without wasting another precious minute, he invited Draco´s cock into his mouth.
The Great Hall fell silent the moment the former head of Gryffindor House rose to her feet to address them after the sorting of the new first years. The students were excited to be back, to be able to return and not worry about Voldemort anymore, to meet up with friends or quarrel with foes, and to eat like kings and queens every day.  The lessons and the schoolwork that followed, they would have to live with.
Harry´s head rose as he leaned back against the wall, his two friends letting his shoulders go slowly. “Yes?”
“Weasley, what do you want!?” He roared, but his mother reminded him of the politeness a true Malfoy had to contain.
“Shit, I thought they´d never scram.” Greg stretched his legs lazily in front of him on the silver carpet by the chair he was sitting in.
“Can´t it wait, I want to bugger you,” Harry whined. He ignored Draco´s widened eyes and stiffness of body, which had nothing to do with the bulge down south. “You don´t want that?”
Draco moaned, and for the first time in his life, he didn´t care who heard him. “Yessss.” Harry had moved on to his neck, sucking and teasing as he pulled his blonde locks.
“I disliked you from the first time we met, you know, when you insulted my first friend, Ron. And it just got worse the more time I spent at school with you.” Harry played with the hem of his shirt for something to occupy his hands with. “You were so arrogant and full of yourself and your prejudice towards, well, everything and pretty well everyone, that I never wanted to know why you were like that. I guess that´s how the whole game thing began, you know?”
“You´re so sexy when you´re angry, did you know?” Harry bit his lip flirtatiously when Draco quirked his brow. “I guess that´s what got me to notice you in the first place, whenever we would fight I ended up –“
“Really, you want to top?" Harry mocked. "I´ll keep that in mind in case I ever run out of females, and my option will have to be... male.” Harry´s eyes glinted with pride over his act in front of the Slytherin, it was going better than he had expected. “Are you a virgin, Malfoy? Is your hole, nice and tight. Mm?”
Harry didn´t get a second kiss either, just like Malfoy had said. All he had received afterwards, was an awkward
“During the following years he tried many times to get my attention, and while we were both still in school I always thought it was his Malfoy pride talking. I didn´t realize that he had been embarrassed in public so he would revenge that by tormenting my friends and I. It was not until last year I realize that maybe it was because he still wanted to be my friend. Of course, I knew that he only wanted my friendship because he might get into the spotlight created by Voldemort when he first tried to murder me.”
Harry stared blankly at the curly-haired girl. “Who does?” He was not going to admit that his damn know-it-all friend knew anything. No matter what.
The Dark Lord´s voice was like ice to your ears on a winter´s day, frosty and painful, “You were given one task, Draco. To kill the headmaster.” Murmurs erupted everywhere from the light´s side. Not one single Death Eater moved. “Nine months, and not even one step closer to finishing that task.” Their Master´s fingers caressed his wand, well, it was Lucius´ really, like a lover. Draco blinked as he finally managed to stare up at the vile being.
Draco stared at the old brown door, took a deep breath, and then another breath, before finally opening the door quietly.
“If you win and you can hold on longer, what do you want?” Harry asked Malfoy like it was the most normal everyday conversation one could be having.
When his best friend finally did speak, Harry let out the breath he had been holding. “Then you fight for it mate.” And then he smiled at Harry, who smiled back.
That´s the real reason why Harry jumped up and volunteered as the Challenger for Gryffindors, and it brought a massive cheer from his housemates when their card was drawn.
“Of course they bloody well do, even Hermione told me once that - you can´t tell anyone I said that!”
Later, he cursed himself for that last act. When he felt someone placing an arm to the left side of his face his eyes flew open. “Morning Gorgeous.” Harry was about to yell something back at Goyle, but the git left before Harry could get his damn mouth to function.
get his soppy-arse happily ever after. Draco for sure would work bloody hard to achieve that, that much was for certain. Who in their right mind could say no to Harry Potter looking like that while sucking your cock. Besides, Draco Potter didn´t sound
McGonagall looked pleased with what she was about to say. “Now, onto the new staff members. I have the honor of presenting one of my own former house members and an Order member, nonetheless.” The excited voices began talking louder and louder and eyes were searching around the Hall to find that special someone. Several even glanced at Harry as if he would be the new professor. Harry shook his head at that. “Our Care of Magical Creatures professor is Charlie Weasley.” Ron`s brother entered the Hall then to cheers and howls, even some of the Slytherins clapped. Ron sent his brother a scowl, he had not told him anything about this, and judging from the identical scowl on Ginny`s face, she didn`t know either. It didn`t take long before they both grinned: their brother was a professor.
“Draco.” Harry´s voice rang loudly in his ears even though. Draco knew he had only whispered his name from close behind him.
“It is a fame I never asked for, nor liked at any time, regardless of what anyone else believes. It is to me a mere nuisance to be followed around by reporters trying to ask me how I prefer to take a dump.”
“Fuck off, Snake,” he spat, and his own house cheered him on. He offered them a small smile in return. Ron felt Goyle shifting closer, his broad chest pushing against Ron´s shoulder; he kept his breathing even. A hand landed on his knee. “WHAT THE FUCK, GOYLE?” he yelled, but the hand stayed where it was.
“I thought…” He bit his lip nervously. “I didn´t want you to think I was boring, and so, when you asked me to… I just figured you wou-“
“Of course not, I´ll help you develop one.” Harry caught the hand on a mission to hurt him and laughed. “So fucking cute.” Then he rolled them over so that he was on top of Draco, who yelped in surprise. “Wanna be my first right now?”
“Mate, I don´t like the git one bit, but I care about you and if you let this chance to speak to him for the last time slip you by, you will resent yourself for it for the rest of your life.” Ron gripped his other shoulder tightly.
Harry stared blankly at Draco for some time; he was so near him that Harry had to blink to keep his focus in place.
Malfoy thrust his wand out his sleeve within a second and pressed it against Harry´s masculine neck. “Don´t you fucking dare say that again, Potter. If I hear one word of that shit about around the hallways, I´ll hunt you down and-”
Harry didn´t answer. He couldn´t, he was too damn busy thinking over what he had possibly done wrong with Malfoy. He had been honest with him. Then why did Malfoy freak out on him? He had checked his breath too - it was minty - so that wasn´t what chased the blond away so abruptly. He had asked before kissing him, hadn´t he? So that had been the polite way to go about it. Most just kissed and paid the consequences afterwards.
Harry had to admit it had been a fantastic Friday night. Even after Seamus had lost their points when Susan allowed herself to be snogged and groped for 15 minutes. Two more couples had gone at it; Su LI had challenged Parvati Patil and lost, and Macmillan had won over Goldstein.
“Well, I hope for your sake that Harry will listen to your reason!” She crossed her arms over her chest before sitting back down.
“Draco Malfoy never had that same chance. He was taught from the time he was an infant to threaten or blackmail his way around getting the things he wanted. People became his friends because of bloodlines, money, and duty. He never knew who he could trust. And if he did decide to trust someone with things, he would be seen as a weakling, because Malfoys do not share emotions. Pure-bloods do not share emotions. The only purebloods who have been different were the Gryffindor ones, really. But even they were not raised the same way. They were raised with love, to love. The only exception I can think of was my Godfather, Sirius Black, but he had the best friends in the world at Hogwarts, so he overcame his families´ ways. When it got too much, he fled his home and was welcomed into my own father´s home. He had an escape. Draco Malfoy never did.”
Harry, being best friends of a know-it-all, had made sure to study the male anatomy for the past two days. There was no way he was making a fool out of himself in front of a bunch of Slytherins, which had clearly been their plan, or at least it was Malfoy´s.
. Walking the distance to where his mother was seated waiting for a response, he leaned over the small table and signed the parchment lying there, then sat down. “You know mother, tha-“
The two Aurors went to stand by the door. “You´re the last one Mr. Potter, so take your time,” the younger one said with a warm smile. “You´re a hero, after all, that should get you something extra.”
Draco had never been vocal during a blowjob before, not ever, which could only mean one thing; Potter was fucking good. Greg growled in the back of his throat at that idea, even though Potter was only a half-blood, he was damn good-looking, and Greg should know being gay himself. Blaise agreed, they had often talked about men together, just like he had discussed women with Draco since Blaise was a man who liked both, he didn´t have to choose one gender.
“You will give a public apology to our world for the mistakes you have made, letting them know you have learned from those mistakes, and that you will not repeat any of them.” He met Draco´s eye again. “You are free to leave this court Mr. Malfoy, but let me point out the obvious to you; you would not be out at all had it not been for Mr. Potter and the debt we all owe him.”
“He is compassionate; I saw him saving people last year and then Obliviating them so they could not remember it. That is not very Slytherin of him; any Slytherin would want to gloat. He is brave; I witnessed his refusal to do Voldemort´s biding more than once earning himself a round of torture. He is smart; who else would figure out a way to sneak in the Death Eaters, even though that act itself does speak against him. He is someone I should not have turned down any form of friendship with. During the past year, I must admit that he has grown on me. I no longer hate him, which I think I never really did in the first place.”
didn´t have to endure that kind of thing. He supposed it was easy to sit back and judge Malfoy, while not having been in his shoes.
“You´re cute while sulking…” Then he laughed even harder. Draco kissed him to shut him up. It worked and Harry placed his long fingers into blonde locks as he moaned. “I saved myself for you...”
Ron´s mouth twitched into a smile, clearly enjoying that it was not Goyle. Hermione had this look across her face that told Harry she was thinking hard. “It´s Malfoy, isn´t it?” Her words barely even heard amongst them. Ron yelped, then snorted. When Harry didn´t meet their eyes Ron went back to whining.
Harry laughed and reached forward to cup Malfoy´s balls, gently rolling them in his hand. No sense getting his teeth kicked out by Malfoy by being rough with him. Malfoy drew in a deep breath and looked away from Harry again. Harry didn´t mind, he would get a reaction sooner or later.
“Fuck,” Harry cursed. Since nobody came to his rescue, Harry thought that this was not an illegal move as part of the game - no magic had been used and Harry was not dead.
“You fucking coward. He´s unarmed,” someone from the light side yelled, causing the Dark Lord to laugh coldly, not caring. He would deal with
Goldstein was still laughing when presenting the Ace of Hearts card and Seamus practically ran to the center of the room. “Yeah, let´s do this!” the Irish lad yelled excitedly. He grinned and waved to his mates. With the Two of Spades, Seamus picked out Susan Bones, who walked slowly, yet determinedly forward.
“Right. Two of Spades: so we´ll need to see a Ravenclaw challenger this time.” Luna immediately walked to the couch and sat down. She smiled when Goldstein handed her the cards and she drew the last of the Diamonds.
Harry let his tongue caress the slit of Malfoy´s dick causing the blond´s breath to catch, much to Harry´s enjoyment. Harry hummed when he surrounded the head with the heat of his mouth and sucked. “Uuh.”
He shuddered. No Malfoy had ever divorced, could you imagine the scandal it should bring? He went into the fireplace and, shortly after, landed inside Malfoy Manor.
“Who cares, we won.” Goyle shrugged and went to join the Slytherin table once more. He high fived Blaise when the board changed scores.
All that earned him was a thrust of Malfoy´s hips forward causing the still clothed bulge of his limp dick to smack into Harry´s unprepared mouth. Harry yelped in surprise. “Suck it up, Potter.”
“Stupid Potter, stupid…” He plunged his tongue into Harry´s mouth, tasting every inch. “You can give me happiness; no one ever gave me that.”
“Professor Malfoy requested to see him tonight, he couldn´t get away without letting his father know about this,” Zabini explained.
“You may step down Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy, if you have any last words before we retire to decide on your penalty, this is it."
Harry walked to the front of the lines of chairs, no longer trusting his own legs to carry him to the back again. The empty chair seemed to swallow him whole, and he thought he would die until he met Malfoy´s eyes.
Harry could tell he meant every word. He simply nodded, bit his lip and walked closer to Draco. A magical wall came up behind him when he was five steps from Draco. That had to have been for some kind of privacy. He noticed a privacy spell being cast too.
“He left,” Harry suddenly burst out, not having known he wanted to share that with them. “He didn´t even…” Harry drew his left leg under him. “He was kissing me back and then I gave him head and he just... thanked me and left. I mean, who does that? He enjoyed the kiss, I know he did, you know?” Dean and Ron simply nodded letting Harry go on.
“Hufflepuff boys are mine then,” Michael Corner stated. “You take the Slytherin girls Li, you´re friends with Bulstrode.” She nodded.
Draco removed Harry´s shirt, with Harry lifting his arms to help in silence. Draco threw the piece of clothes somewhere behind him in the darkness.
“Maybe no male should go, just in case?” She said, biting her lip in concern. She looked around to Ron beside her on the floor, Luna and Neville sitting on the couch and Seamus and Dean on a chair each. They had been allowed to stay here by Harry until they figured out what to do about jobs or further education.
Pale hips bucked and Harry gagged on the dick but didn´t complain, instead, he moaned again, sending lovely vibrations through Malfoy´s cock. “Nhhhu.” Harry grinned and sucked the length all the way out his mouth and back in again. He released it and slipped his tongue into the slit on the head while his hand pumped the cock, up and down, up and down. “M-more… fuuck…” Malfoy was losing it and Harry enjoyed every last incoherent mumble the blond let out.
What seemed to be an easy enough spell to master turned out to be so difficult to manage that not even Hermione could do it correctly. “20 points to Slytherin for the first correctly performed spell today,” she said suddenly after 25 minutes, causing everyone to pause in their attempts and glance around to see the person she had just praised. “Excellent work, Mr. Malfoy, keep up the good work.” Malfoy didn´t even flinch when she placed her hand briefly on to his shoulder.
“Or what, Potter? Are you going to hex me? Go on then, give me your best shot. Let´s see, yet again, how everyone will support the Savior of our world, by letting him do whatever the hell he pleases, like fucking always!” Malfoy sneered angrily.
got a girlfriend he would be sure to find someone not so prone to nagging. Although, Harry was not at all certain that he would be interested in a female anytime soon. Not with that git Malfoy lurking around inside his head all the bloody time; even at night in his dreams. Surely, it was some kind of teenage identity crisis situation? Harry swallowed his bacon and automatically let his eyes wander to the Slytherin table.
Harry straightened his back and cast a refreshing charm before leaving the house to go to the courtroom, in which he knew Draco Malfoy´s trial was to be held in half an hour.
“Head of Hufflepuff House and Herbology Professor Pomona Sprout.” The plump witch smiled broadly and nodded shyly.
If possible, the watching crowd got louder. “SILENCE!” Voldemort raised his wand and searched the nearby area, as did his followers. “I´m listening, Potter,” he said at last when he found no trace of him.
Draco grinned as he continued to thrust, and then he spoke. “You heard the man, Finnegan. Why don´t you make yourself useful and suck Harry off, instead of just standing there ogling us?”
Harry watched Ron down his beer in one go and open another and shook his head. He was not going to carry his tall arse back to their dorm - Seamus was getting that task tonight.
“You followed me around a whole damn year.” He kissed a trail from the nipple towards Harry´s face and stopped when they shared the same air. “Is that when it began?” he whispered.
Seamus, Dean and Hermione needed explanations on what exactly that meant, so Luna offered her knowledge. Ron got up onto his knees and growled when she was finished.
Harry knew, of course, that Malfoy had been pressured beyond anything to comply with his orders, barely knowing what he was doing. Harry had seen flashes of images Voldemort did not know he had let slip, whenever he was excited or angry enough to not shield it from Harry.
Malfoy smirked. “Oh, Potter.” Harry did not like that tone. “You´re dirty; a half-breed.” Malfoy took a step closer, “If you were good-looking, then maybe I wouldn´t care about that, sexually, that is.
“That`s it then, let`s eat. Bon appetit.” She sat down, and the tables filled with delicious meals and drinks and the chattering began.
Harry pulled him closer and Draco let him do it. “You better think about me every time you wank, Malfoy. I have a nasty temper, you know…”
Teddy kept on screaming and someone shouted to cast a silencing spell on the boy, which made McGonagall stare so coldly the Hufflepuff 6th-year flinched. Harry met Meda´s apologetic eyes silently begging him to take the boy knowing that Harry was always the only one to calm down Teddy unless they wanted to wait half an hour for the screaming to stop. Harry nodded and the sigh Andromeda offered was barely visible, but Harry noticed.
, but he was not about to tell his friends that. That would mean he had to come clean. To confess about the thoughts he had been having. Not to mention the dream he woke up from last night. The dream that made him come in his sleep; something he had never experienced before, ever.
The fireplace flared, but no head appeared, which could only mean; that somebody who did not have permission to come through was calling. The two Malfoys shared a look, knowing it could not be the Ministry since they were to have all-time access, and the few friends that still lingered around them could simply call. Narcissa flicked her wand at the hearth. Draco coughed up most of the tea he had decided to use to clear his throat with when he stared into the face of Ronald Weasley.
“Yeah, I´m – … urgh?” Goyle was now straddling Harry and sitting straight across his dick. Goyle´s face was hovering right over Harry´s right ear.
”Draco, perhaps–...” His mother´s loving voice suggested after having listened to the facts of the entire trial.
“I will.” Someone in the way back said, loud and clearly making every head in the courtroom turn around. Even Draco, who had been sitting hunched over in the chair in the middle of the stone floor, looking even paler than usual turned to see who had spoken.
“For anything, I may have some blame in that matter. I am the one he reached out to on more than one occasion. He tried to become my friend, to find his way out, and I wouldn´t let him. All because I was too hurt myself, too angry to see the truth - and too selfish.”
about my body, Potter,” he spat as he sat down on the black couch as the onlooking crowd laughed. Some were too drunk to pay attention, and others were randomly snogging, but about half the students were at least following the game with interest.
“Fuck off, Ron,” he said and leaned back in his armchair beside Dean, who coughed in a poor attempt to cover the loud laugh he had emitted.
“Noo,” his father croaked. “Take my life instead. The mistake was mine, by not raising my heir right.”
“You looked like a scared, helpless bird for the entire first year of school, which is why you were the teacher´s pet in most classes. I bet you never knew that.”
“Like what you see, Potter?” The dark-skinned male purred when noticing Harry´s eyes widen. Zabini´s dick was thick like Goyle´s but about nine or ten inches in length.
He really had hoped that the blond was too ashamed to show his face at school again after what his family had done during the war; not to mention what Malfoy himself had done. It wasn´t that Harry was sorry that he had saved him from being burned alive; Harry was not that cruel even if it was Malfoy of all people. But, Harry simply wished that he didn´t have to look at his fucking face every single day and be reminded of every casualty from the Battle of Hogwarts.
The minute Harry´s hand clamped down on Malfoy´s prick he felt it harden. Harry snorted and twisted his hand, causing Malfoy to growl. “You like that, do you, Ferret?” The sneer Harry received in return was worth everything. Harry laughed and twisted his body around and slipped to the floor, kneeling in front of Malfoy.
“Cuthbert Binns will be teaching you History of Magic.” The male ghost didn´t react to his name being called, and most students groaned in disapproval of having him teach still.
“He clearly changed, Ron, or else Harry wouldn´t have…” She was hoping that Harry would reassure her.
“Aah.” The rough fabric was doing wonders and Malfoy was suddenly very flushed looking. His two friends had not come to his aid, they simply watched and went back to touching themselves.
“Come out to you,” Ron said, then burst out laughing at the double meaning of those words seconds after. And Hermione, bless her, lasted all but half a minute before joining Ron. Harry got up, scowled at them before leaving them behind to laugh it up. He exited the Gryffindor Tower, prepared to stay out until curfew. He wasn´t really angry, he was, sort of hurt, though not so much he would not get over it soon.
Harry´s body shook and Draco had to hold him up for a couple of minutes while he came down from his high.
“I also had the opportunity that others did not have. I could look into the mind of Voldemort himself.”
Semen spurted down Draco´s throat and he swallowed greedily. He could feel Harry´s eyes upon him, but he still couldn´t see shite.
“Never thought… that I was gay… before seeing your perfect arse… in the showers after… Quidditch fifth year… either…“
, naked men; one his friend and the other a foe. Harry lay between Malfoy´s legs sucking him off. Scratch that, he was
Draco´s mother screamed as the curse tore through her beautiful body and Harry´s instinct took over and the truth blurted out of his mouth. “Because I love him!”
“Greg,” Malfoy said. And as if practised, the tall dark-haired male stood and fetched a bottle of fire whisky and four glasses and poured four drinks. “Blaise,” Malfoy nodded and the student locked and silenced the room with his wand and a smirk. Malfoy faced Harry once more. “Scared, Potter?”
“No, Malfoy. Call your mother and tell her we´re going, now…” He placed his hands into his pockets for something to do. “You know bloody well that you can find a surrogate mother to your future heir.”
Harry brought forth his bravery from somewhere deep within. “Ready to lose every last point, Goyle?” Later though, he admitted he probably should not have asked that particular question out loud. The Slytherin sat down beside Harry, his smirk never wider than this moment. Harry knew what was coming when the larger male brought his entire weight behind his body and tilted the couch so Harry and he fell backwards and the furniture stayed upturned, hiding the two males from everybody´s view.
He knew that Malfoy had hated every single order he had been given, but he had done it anyway. Sure, it was under the threat of his parents´ lives, Harry had seen Voldemort torturing Malfoy´s mother until the blond caved and took over the torture session of innocent Muggles himself.
Harry pulled away, clearly shocked at Malfoy´s sudden confidence. He had wanted to make Malfoy pay, he didn´t know why. Well, he did, because of the war, of course. Now, seeing the blond like this, cornered and actually challenging him, yelling straight at his face, was killing the mood.
, and Pansy and Theo will most likely be spending the night in whatever room they have found like they always do.” He leaned forward
Malfoy enjoyed watching the fire burn in Potter´s eyes; as always it brought him so much satisfaction. In reality, it was what made his days at Hogwarts worth enduring. To witness Potter explode was the most intense experience Malfoy had ever had. And to be the one bringing Potter there, well, it brought him more power than he could ever describe to anyone really.
“For anything, I may have some blame in that matter. I am the one he reached out to, on more than one occasion. He tried to become my friend, to find his way out, and I wouldn´t let him. All because I was too hurt myself, to angry to see the truth - and too selfish.”
“Draco Malfoy was forced into doing things. Things nobody could ever come close to comprehending when they have never had Voldemort living under their roof. When they have never had an insane father-figure who worshiped Voldemort - a man who pushed proudly to make his only son like him. They would never know the feeling of constant fear, of pressure to perform and to wear the perfect mask covering up just how you really feel. They would never know what is it to be lonely and afraid.”
Fingers found his right nipple and began playing with it. Harry groaned, straining his ears to hear Draco´s words.
Harry grinned and nodded, “And when I win, minute-man, you get on your knees for me in the Astronomy tower at midnight tomorrow. Just the two of us, my cock in your mouth. You will enjoy it and you will swallow it all. Should you fail to do so, I get another the day after and another until you manage to complete the task.”
“Yes, you do, and it´s okay. Draco, it´s okay to feel this way.” Draco felt his chin being grabbed and he opened his eyes. “I won´t let anyone hurt you over this. I love you.”
What the hell was wrong with him? Was Malfoy´s spunk turning him into a madman, or maybe it had the power to make men appealing to him?
Harry´s reasons for doing this swirled around inside his head, and he couldn´t decide which one to answer Tom Riddle with.
“You wanted to see me…” Harry was nervous. He had spoken his deepest thoughts in front of everyone, and the truth would be all over the papers later he was sure. Malfoy had returned his feelings as well.
Malfoy stepped closer clearly mesmerized by Harry´s admission, so he kept talking. “You´re gorgeous, and smart, and sexy, who
“I DIDN`T LIE!” His breath came fast and uncontrolled for the first time in years. “I… look Weasley… he deserves better… I can´t give him what he wants… what he needs…” He closed his eyes. “Just let me go.”
The voices in the room exploded when the other students were watching Luna snog the Prince of Slytherin. His hands wanted to grab her and push her to the floor in disgust, and he didn´t return her kiss, of course, he wouldn´t, it was fucking Lovegood.
“-Doesn´t give you the right to manhandle others whenever the hell you want.” Malfoy was furious. “Why don´t you go bother somebody else, you fucking twat, or get back on your knees and swallow my cum like the good little whore you are?” Malfoy challenged.
“You would love that, wouldn´t you?” Harry moved closer so that his hip was bumping into Malfoy´s groin, “We all saw that earlier. Mm, you just,
The Dark Lord, wand in hand, circled, as Draco tried to catch his breath. The horde of Death Eaters didn´t move except for Lucius, holding his wife in his arms. Both were shaking. The torture curse hit Draco for a second time and he nearly bit his tongue to bits.
Harry placed Draco´s hand across his own heart. “I can´t explain how or when, hell I can´t even tell you why, but I do. I love you.”
Goyle muttered something and Harry felt his shirt being ripped apart causing him to yelp. Harry stood there frozen while the Slytherin ran his huge hands over his naked chest and lower
Harry closed his eyes, letting his own fears wash away, no longer caring what the rest of the world were shouting at him for speaking those words to a Death Eater. All he cared about was hearing those three words from the lips of the man he had fallen in love with over the past year.
“I was telling you, that you belong on the floor, beneath others,” Malfoy corrected but was cut off by Harry´s laugh.
“Again, he tried to befriend me when we arrived at Hogwarts, but unfortunately for him, he did so while ridiculing my first friend, whom I met on the train; Ronald Weasley.”
“So you´re… you´re…” Ron choked on the words he was trying to get out, though Harry knew what he was trying to ask him on Saturday afternoon.
Draco growled and yanked Harry on top of him, forgetting that Harry was once his rival, ignoring that Malfoys don´t bottom, and shoving aside their differences for now, because they had both agreed upon working on their flaws and learning what would be needed in order to live together. And who knows, maybe Harry
“I will not promise you anything, Weasley, but I will speak with him at the very least.” He nodded to Lovegood as she began leading him upstairs.
Draco growled with need as he shoved the second digit inside Harry´s tightness, Harry clawed his shoulders in pleasure when Draco hit his prostate.
“I saw many things through his eyes. Things and actions that changed my mind about many people during that year. I saw brave people not giving in while Voldemort tortured them, and eventually killed them because he found them useless. I saw cowards turning their own family in to survive themselves. I saw Death Eaters, who did his bidding. I felt what they felt as they did what he told them to.”
Ron studied the Ferret´s face for long moments after he had closed his eyes. What would bring Malfoy - an enemy - to trust him enough to do that?
Harry kissed down Draco´s inviting body, tasting every inch hungrily, never wanting to end it. He licked the length in front of him once he reached Draco´s groin. Draco moaned and grabbed Harry´s dark hair at once to keep him there.
“I´ll know I Obliviated you correctly,” he said. Seamus froze in the middle of pulling up his pants. “A joke Finnegan… it was a bloody joke…”
“Is all I need,” Harry finished before freeing the cock and again the room went crazy. Even though they could see nothing they knew what was happening.
“The war has ended and Voldemort is gone,” her eyes caught sight of Harry´s green ones, causing the teen to blush as everyone else began to cheer and whistle. McGonagall gestured for silence after some time had passed. Harry was glad; he didn´t think he would ever get used to the attention.
He looked out of place in a room like this, with fellow students that were all half passed out by the drinks that kept coming, rumpled clothes from snogging sessions and so on. Even Hermione had been coaxed by Seamus and Ron to drink tonight, for the fun of it, the Irish had pushed until she caved.
Harry dragged himself down Malfoy´s body, making sure to rub Malfoy´s dick on the way down between his legs. “Your friends seem to be enjoying it,” Harry said casually to the blond´s dick, and the breath tickled so Malfoy squirmed to get away. Harry placed his hand flat on his stomach to still while his tongue roved over  his balls. “Merlin,” Malfoy gasped.
“This is his room, you should just go in, he may be asleep still, but you can wake him up.” Luna offered a small smile before descending the stairs again to join her friends.
He walked closer to Malfoy and, with as much strength he could muster up, placed a hand on his shoulder, causing him to jump in surprise at the contact.
“The Aguamenti spell,” he stated confidently. That earned him a snort from Draco Malfoy, who sat behind him in class, Neville turned around to flip him the finger outside the watch of the stern eye of their professor; several students laughed at Longbottom’s confidence. So much seemed to have changed after the war, although Malfoy was acting as nothing had changed at all.
Draco opened his eyes and stared into Ron´s eyes. “Only a fool would not,” he whispered and straightened up, not really moving any further. “He deserves more than I can offer.”
… stop teasing… fuck me…” Draco grinned; he was going to make Harry weak from pleasure before the night was over.
Potter, please don´t make this harder than it is.” He cupped Harry´s face between both his hands. “Whatever I feel does not change anything. I´m a Malfoy, I have to-“
“Potter,” Malfoy drawled when meeting the Gryffindor in the corridor leading to the Slytherin dorms. “Cloak?”
The dream had seemed so vivid, so real that his heart had still been running a marathon inside his rib cage when he had awoken. His body was sweaty and bounding with the aftermath of his orgasm. An orgasm more intense than any he´d  had before, and it had been caused by no less than three bloody Slytherins.
eating, Greg had noticed, he was merely poking the food and pushing it around and then raising his fork every now and then to his mouth to chew and swallow what little he had managed to capture with it. In the end, it may have looked like he ate the same amount as always - if you weren´t paying attention, or weren´t a close friend of the blond.
Draco huffed. “Stop laughing, I don´t understand your mumbling." He was doing his best to sound annoyed, but failed.
“God damn it – STOP!” Harry sucked one last time, before releasing the cock with a pop and meeting the grey orbs.
Malfoy gave a soft moan, and Harry sucked harder. He had a game to win. That was the reason he was doing this, and not because he had a sudden craving for salty drops of-.
“Come off it, Malfoy, I heard you. You were bloody moaning when I sucked you. You stopped me because you were going to burst!”
Harry felt pleased with himself once he was done and he was about to stand down when the last question rang in his ears, the one he had dreaded and avoided.
Sometimes some points were forfeit because the last two cards were from the same houses, meaning another house could not be challenged. So, Harry had lost track of how much the scores could have been if every card was used. Well, math was never his best subject in the first place.
“You understand that a true leader needs to have order. And to have that order, punishments are sometimes required.” Draco nodded because he had to accept his fate, he didn´t want Voldemort hurting his mother instead, which he knew his Master wouldn´t hesitate to do.
With that, Lucius Malfoy in all his glory and free-of-Azkaban-because-of-Harry´s-testimony glided in between the Slytherin and Gryffindor tables, meeting two sets of eyes. One he smiled proudly at; his son who smirked and accepted the congratulations from his housemates. The other, Harry Potter, to whom he nodded curtly, and Harry nodded back. They had agreed on a truce, ever since Harry had witnessed on the elder Malfoy`s behalf and Lucius had thanked him in private and offered Harry an open invitation to the Manor, should he so wish, and any favor he could possibly want.
Harry hummed; this was heaven, being able to suck a huge cock while having the man of his dreams fucking him for the first time. The only reason he hadn´t come already was the damn agonizingly slow pace Draco set, clearly to tease him.
Greg and Blaise have shared a man on more than one occasion, just like Blaise and Draco have shared a woman once, not to mention all the times the three men had their own one-on-one going on. Greg and Blaise have snogged but never been inside each other, and they would never end up a couple. They were too good of
Hermione had, of course, twisted his arm to agreeing. Women and their damned withholding sex never failed to work! Besides, between the two of them, as a couple, they had more than enough to buy a large house and furnish it. Harry had, of course, received ten times more than the two of them combined, but he just shrugged it off and let it stay in his Gringotts vault with the rest of his fortunes from both the Black and the Potter lines.
“I think,” Lord Voldemort stated because Draco had decided that he was not his Master any longer. He would die proudly, and free from that snake. “That the best way is for the Malfoy bloodline to end with you, Lucius.”
Nothing he did could take away the pain he was feeling inside. The war had ended a month ago and people had died. His friends, his classmates, Order members, strangers, enemies; nobody had been safe from the killing curse.
They had buried Tonks and her husband Remus too, who had been one of his father´s closest friends. Their son Teddy was now to be raised by his grandmother. Harry was already playing a large role in Teddy´s life as his Godfather, a task he would forever cherish.
Much like the Golden Trio had been in Gryffindor; Weasley, Potter and Granger, the Slytherin Trio got their nickname in the second half of last year. Goyle, much to everyone´s surprise, had been feigning stupidity for the previous six years. It was a trick he had used so that his father would think him unworthy of joining Voldemort´s ranks. The Goyle patriarch had simply feared that Greg would embarrass him, or worse get the entire family killed. It was rumoured amongst certain Pure-bloods after the First Wizarding War, that the Dark Lord was not really dead and they were planning his return, encouraging their sons on to be ready to join him when he did come back.
Harry sighed, running his hands through his hair as he stopped to stare at the Orders. Not everyone had earned an Order of Merlin during the war. The Death Eaters had certainly not. In fact, they had almost all been hunted down and killed. The lucky ones who had been captured instead had now been sentenced to life in Azkaban.
Harry couldn´t hide this from Malfoy in an intimate situation. He wasn´t a pureblood practically born into an iron mask of indifference, nor was he a Slytherin taught to tame his emotions. And there was no way he could possibly let Malfoy know how he felt, the torment that would follow would be devastating. Even though he only had eight months of school left, Malfoy would broadcast it to the papers.
Malfoy´s hand almost reached out to touch him, but he managed to control his urges. He sighed and spoke. “I didn´t know.”
A pop rang almost silently and the house elf bowed when she took the orders while Narcissa guided her son towards the sitting room.
Harry grinned. "Cat got your tongue?” He stepped closer and Malfoy tensed up but Harry ignored it. Harry´s right hand rose and a single finger traced Malfoy´s jawline. Malfoy gasped. “I started to feel sorry for you instead of disliking you some time last year. That´s when Voldemort´s thoughts and actions involving you and your family became clearer to me. Voldemort´s and my minds were connected by the curse he hit me with when I was a baby.” The finger traced a cheekbone now. “Sometimes he sent images at me, that´s how… my godfather died. And other times I got glimpses, he didn´t know about. Like you, being ordered to do stuff, and I could be there and witness and sort of… feel your resentment towards it.”
Anthony Goldstein grinned at his housemates. “I´ll explain in our common room, come on.” The idea had simply walked into his mind and he was sure his friends would approve.
“It´s not!” Draco pushed Potter´s hands away and Potter stumbled and fell on his arse. Normally Draco would have laughed, but he couldn´t. Not when the git kept staring at him like
Harry kissed him one last time and pulled away, with a hand over his heart he spoke again when he reached the door. “Always…”
the bitch in this room, Malfoy,” Harry remarked, causing the blond to bolt upwards. As soon as Harry sucked half of Malfoy´s sack into his hot mouth with his hand closed around the head and his thumb swirling the pre-cum around, Malfoy collapsed onto his back with a loud thump.
“10 points to Slytherin.” Students whispered all around. Had Ron´s mother actually taken points from Ron and given them to Malfoy? “The incantation is A-kwa-ee-RUCK-too, and the wand movements are triangular like this.” She showed it a couple of times before ordering the students to get up, spread out and practice the spell.
Their tongues danced and Harry dominated the kiss, which should be unacceptable to a Malfoy, yet, the blond couldn´t control the moan that escaped. Harry deepened the kiss and tasted every part of his mouth. Harry wanted to grind against him, so he did.

was a wise move in this particular company: he made sure she stood. “Stop…” he said, before making gagging noises too inappropriate for any Malfoy. “Your tongue was in my mouth, how dare you?!”
the past two days. Ever since you… the last game night.” She flushed, Harry noticed, and he didn´t understand what she meant.
