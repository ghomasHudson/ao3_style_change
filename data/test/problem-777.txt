She smiled.  “I know, that’s why I’m not punishing you.  In fact, I’m releasing you from the rest of your detention duty.”
Harry was normally a take charge sort of bloke.  He went to muggle pubs and had his pick of attractive young men. They’d find somewhere to go--a hotel, or possibly the other fellow’s home-- and shag.  Occasionally, he’d find one of them compatible enough to see again.  Perhaps even several times.  Whatever happened, Harry was always in control.
“Are you just going to let Dean marry her and claim your kid?” Ron stood, enraged by Ginny’s deception and Harry’s apparent lack of concern.
Harry stood at the door, hesitating. Should he try to sneak out or should he suck it up and reveal himself?
Draco knew he should either reveal himself or walk away.  His insecurities got the better of him, though, and he remained where he was, watching and listening.
He shrugged.  “I suppose if it really is only the spell keeping Harry with me, I’ll be doomed to a lifetime of unrequited love and devotion.  It has also occurred to me that the bond may be a result of the game as well.  In which case, it will wither away, along with Harry’s love.”
“No, certainly not,” she defended.  “But you must realize that things will be difficult for you in public.  At least for a while.”
“Well, it would be a shame if you didn’t get a chance to be a father.  My girls are my joy.  In fact, Fleur and I are planning to have another in the next year or two.”
Harry looked in the mirror and sighed.  He wondered how he could have let Professor Flitwick talk him into the outfit he was currently wearing.  At the time, it seemed a fairly benign costume and a good choice.  Harry only wanted something easy and comfortable.  And while he was physically comfortable, he couldn’t help being self-conscious.
“Uh, I’ll go with you,” Ron said and hurried to catch up with him.  He caught the look on Hermione’s face as he abandoned her.  He knew he’d pay for it later.
“Nah.  I’m not in a party mood.  And I don’t think I want to watch Potter pick some bint’s wand and run off to fuck her too.”
“Malfoy, wait.”  Harry wasn’t sure what he wanted to say. But he wanted to say something.  He felt as though the pair had made progress toward peaceful coexistence, if not friendship. He also felt as though he may have ruined it already.
“Let ‘em waste, I say. I don’t think they’re worth your effort,” Ron said.  “But,” he continued.  “It could be useful for driving the dark magic out of objects.  Stuff that’s locked away because it’s dangerous.  Stuff that could be worth more than some  shriveled up old Death Eaters.”
Harry pulled off and back just far enough in order to watch as long streams of white, hot cum shot out of Draco’s rosy cock. He kept his mouth open, hoping to catch anything that came close enough. As it happened, Draco shot for distance and Harry was rewarded with the sweet and salty mixture.
Party goers drank and listened to music and socialized.  The closer the hour of midnight drew, the more the tension grew.  Nervous glances around the room gave away the apprehension most of the students were feeling.
Covering her mouth, Hermione tried to stifle a giggle. “Oh, I’m so sorry.  She does that sometimes.  I’ll take her now and put her down.  We really appreciate you looking after her for us.”
When they finished their meal, Hermione suggested they get back to Hogwarts.  It was almost two o’clock and McGonagall would be expecting them back soon.
“Right here,” Harry said from the sitting room.  He was standing next to a bound and stunned Death Eater. The third to enter the home. Draco ran to him and hugged him fiercely.
“My right ankle is still broken.  One Healer spent way too much time attempting to repair it before deciding it needs to be completely removed and re-grown.  I wasn’t about to sit around another eight or so hours for that.”
“You can’t go now, Draco,” Harry said, holding out his hand.  “Sit back down.  Why don’t we put in a floo call to Azkaban tomorrow and make an appointment together to see him.”
Draco turned on his heel and left in a huff.  It wasn’t much of an argument, but it was their first.  Well, their first as a couple. Afterward, Harry felt badly about it.
“You know, you’re very different than I thought you were.  Most of you Slytherins come off as . . .”  He tried to think of a way to put it that wouldn’t be insulting.  “Um, experienced and sort of demanding.”
Utterly confused, Harry and Draco sat across from them and watched as Ron gently kissed his girl.  Harry shrugged his shoulders, at a loss when Draco gave him a questioning look.
“This is the place he suggested I come for a gift for Hermione.  Told me a story about some quill he bought his mum.  Maybe I’ll get Mione a new quill and journal.”
“This is really lovely,” Hermione remarked as she popped a small piece of carrot into her mouth.  “I’m so impressed you were able to do this.”
Ron nodded in agreement. The pair walked out of the Great Hall together.  Before parting ways at the staircase, Draco turned to Ron.
“Really, you’ve never noticed the similarities?” Blaise cocked his head again.  “You both grew up in controlling households, both leaders of your little trios, both had your destinies planned for you in the war.  You’ve both borne the burden of other people’s lofty expectations. He’s the golden boy, with just a touch of evil in him.  You’re the bad boy, with enough good to redeem yourself in the end.  I’d say, no one is ever going to understand you better than him.  And vice versa.”
“Fuck.  I’m sorry,” Draco said, embarrassed for spitting in Harry’s hair.  “Maybe we should take turns in the bath.”
Ron sat up straighter and gave Harry a scowl.  “Do you think I’d be so fucking miserable if I didn’t?  I could go out and get Lav right now if I didn’t want Hermione back.  I’d go to that party tomorrow night if I didn’t want her back.  I mean, sure, the prospect of fooling around with someone new is exciting.  Don’t get me wrong.  Who
Draco stretched and threw the covers off.  “Well, wedding talk is my cue to leave.  We missed breakfast again.  I’ll see you at lunch.”  He pulled a t-shirt over his head and left in his pajamas.
“Thank you, dear.” She held out her arms to him and enveloped him in a hug.  “I’m feeling much better,” she said, once they pulled apart.
When at last Harry returned, Draco’s eyes were closed and he lay very still. For a moment, Harry was afraid he’d already succumbed to his injuries. The longer he stood and watched, though, the more signs of life he saw.
Harry awoke with a start, sweating and breathing heavily.  His heart raced as he glanced over to Ron’s bed, where the ginger peacefully lay.  Harry sat very still until he was certain he could hear his friend breathing rhythmically and he was satisfied that Ron was indeed merely sleeping.
Lucius glanced at Narcissa, who shot him a look of warning.  She had spoken to him earlier about being on his best behavior. He bowed his head respectfully. “Thank you.” He sat down in the seat Arthur had pulled out.
“Good, good,” Healer Cummins smiled.  “As it should be.  It really is an incredible experience.  Or so I’ve heard.  I’m not married myself.”
“That’s an old witch’s tale, Pans,” Draco scoffed.  “Some horridly unattractive wizard probably made it up just to get shagged.”
“Carefree,” Harry replied.  “I’ve seen you happy.  And I’ve seen you content.  But there’s always been a . . . solemnness about you. I mean, it’s still sort of there, but you’re able to really let go for a bit now.”
to open the passage.  Draco hurried to the third floor corridor–one step closer to making sure his love was safe. From Hogsmeade, he would be able to apparate to the Burrow.  Back in Hogwarts, Blaise, Pansy and Harper would cover for him, should any of the professors be looking for him.
“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten about the Quidditch match.  I’ll be heartbroken,” Draco said dramatically.  It was saying things like that which kept Harry hoping, despite knowing what a flirt the man was.
By the end of August, the first tome was ready to be sent out to local wizarding publishers and agents for consideration. Harry sent out his queries before the new school year began so he could concentrate on his curriculum, as he knew it would be weeks, if not months before he got any feedback.
He gently ran his fingers over the spot. The blond’s pale skin was ice cold, even under a shirt and jumper. Harry then suddenly remembered something else from his basic healer training using muggle methods.
Draco bit his lip and closed his eyes.  Slowly, he unbuttoned the shirt himself.  He winced at the thought of Harry looking at him. Opening one eye, then the other, Draco saw Harry frowning.  His reaction was worse than Draco thought.
“No, I didn’t say that.  But if the students are distracted, they won’t be learning what you’re trying to teach them anyway.”
“Ambergris it is.”  Draco poured a generous capful into the running water.  “Not that I need it.  Pouring you into the bath will have a much stronger affect.”
“The Unintentional Hero, by Mary Harper Tolftoy,” Draco read aloud. “What’s this?” He turned the roughly bound book over in his hand.
The corner of Draco’s mouth curled.  Harry was willing to put off a quick shag in the hopes of a more meaningful relationship.
Harry had to blink back tears for the pain in Draco’s voice.  But it also gave him hope that father and son could find some common ground.
“See?  That right there is why I told you to forget I said anything about us being friends.  You can’t help arguing with me about
“I said bugger off.” Draco glared at his roommate.  Though much more slightly built than Theo, Draco’s scowl was very effective.
“I’m going to make love to you like no one else ever has,” the blond breathed, sucking on a rigid nipple.
“Friends,” Ron said.  “Go ahead and have your fling, Harry.  But I don’t think I’ll ever be friends with him.”
Dean watched the pair as they discussed a plan to go to St. Mungo’s for an exam.  He felt as though they were leaving him out of the decision process.
Harry shrugged.  “I dunno.  Maybe.  It would be worth a shot.  Otherwise, they’ll all waste away in Azkaban.”
She thought about how so many other players were paired up that night.  Willingly.  The game hadn’t chosen well for her, though.  Neville and Michael had been nice boys, but both had their hearts set on someone else.  Justin Finch-Fletchley was all right, she supposed, but she truly couldn’t find herself interested in a Hufflepuff.  Besides, he had asked too many questions about Millicent. And getting paired with Romilda Vane did absolutely nothing for her.  Not once did she get paired with Draco.  If anyone at Hogwarts was going to be her mate, it would have been Draco.  And now Pansy found herself for the second time with Theo.  His reputation was worse than hers.
“This story behind this one doesn’t have such a happy ending,” The clerk told Harry.  She turned it over.  “It was commissioned by a young wizard about thirty years ago to give to his would-be lover.  The pattern was an original design by the artist.  See how there are actually two pins on the back?”
“Just cross out mother and write in father,” Draco suggested. “This one is easy. We won’t be using our own eggs.”
Continuing on, the former Death Eater addressed primarily Molly and Arthur. “And my apologies.  My family has provided a fair amount of torment for yours.  For most of which, there are not enough apologies.  I have matured enough to understand the qualities that make a person worthy of respect and admiration.  And I now strive for those.  I know Ron and Ginny to be loyal and compassionate friends to Harry, and more accepting of me than I probably deserve.  I have misjudged you all based on prejudice and I am humbled by your tolerance.  And I ask your forgiveness for my past behavior.”
Draco blushed for the attention but followed Molly into the kitchen where a feast was waiting.  The table had been expanded even further from the Easter before last, to accommodate two more highchairs.
Harry’s warm lips covered Draco’s cool ones, warming them instantly.  Their tongues wrestled playfully while they pushed closer up against one another.  It didn’t take long for Harry to harden in his trousers as the afternoon’s activities kept him on the verge.
“No, I just didn’t realize it was so soon.” If Draco got the okay, he would be able to go back to work, and enter the Auror training. He wouldn’t be sitting around waiting for Harry’s visits anymore.
Ron had made plans to help Anthony Goldstein work on their Defense Against the Dark Arts project. And the pair headed for the library earlier that evening.  Hermione, unable to concentrate on her own studies, decided to steal Ron away from Anthony for some much needed one on one time.
There wasn’t much for Harry to say.  He knew it was true.  Yes, someone would ask Draco and occasional question or comment to him.  But it was almost always in regard to Harry or the war.
“You’re very handsome,” Harry said, slurring the word handsome.  He dropped his head on the table abruptly, momentarily passing out, his glasses bouncing off his face.
Yawning, Hermione covered her mouth.  “It’s late.  We should go to bed.  We’ll talk more in the morning.”
“These hands can work miracles, let me tell you,” he assured her.  “I’ll make you feel beautiful.  Just give me a chance.”
Harry took the opportunity while Ron was not looking at him to make his confession.  Taking a deep breath, he finally burst out with it.
So Draco stood, a stranger in his own home, with the last person he thought would return to the mansion.  Harry glanced around nervously.
“I do.  I wouldn’t have agreed to marry you if I didn’t,” Draco said.  “But I’m still not going to trust any man that gives you a second look.  In fact, right now, I think Ron is the only man I do trust around you.”
At approximately nine forty-five, after everyone from Gryffindor who was going, was gone, Hermione sat in her room alone.  For once, her mind wasn’t on the book in front of her.  It was many floors below her, in the dungeons.
“Yes.  But I thought we decided that was simply your own fears manifesting themselves in your sleep.”
“I’m visiting Pansy on Friday night, but I’m free Saturday night.  If you can control yourself this time,” Draco teased.
Harry smiled, feeling a little better about it. “No. You two catch up. And don’t forget to take that last potion.”
“And, um, earlier, when you came to my room . . .” he blushed, having a much harder time talking about it than he anticipated.   “Draco and I . . . well, we’re . . . dating.”
“My mother’s parents were actually rather excited about it,” she told them.  “They had so many questions and wanted to know what sorts of things I could do. My grandmother still expects me to display my talents as a witch whenever I visit.”
“Much better.  Her leg is completely healed.  Rather than setting it, the healers removed the broken bone and grew a new one.  It was quite painful, but better in the long run.”
Draco frowned. “But . . . the Deathly Hallows is just a legend.  You’re saying that it was real and my father could have brought Druella back?”
“Well, he said he didn’t want to be a father because his father wasn’t . . . the most attentive.  And the stories about his grandfather weren’t any more flattering.  He figured it was genetic or something.  Malfoy men simply didn’t make good fathers.  So not only did he not want to become one, he didn’t want to pass the genes down to the next generation.”
Shaking his head, Draco assured Harry, “The healer said it could be this early, remember? It’s only a week and a half.  Everything will be fine.”
Frustrated, Harry sat on the bottom of the marble staircase, propped his elbows on his knees, and dropped his head in his hands.  Concerned students walked by, glancing at him, but none had the nerve to speak to him.
The small movements he was able to make weren’t going to get him off.  Not anytime soon.  He tried shifting without revealing himself, but Millicent glanced up at him from her book.
“Looks like that’s our cue to leave,” Bill said. “It’s time for Victoire’s nap.  If only we could get these two on the same schedule.”
“I’ll hand you Scorpius,” Harry offered.  “I don’t think Draco is ever going to give up Lily.”  He paused. “Lily.  I think my mother would be pleased.”
“Of course, Healer Potter,” she replied. “Go ahead.  Congratulations,” she called as they hurried down the corridor.
“If there are no babies to adopt, being the Chosen One won’t matter. This is going to be harder than we thought,” Harry sighed.
“Exactly,” Ms. Goshawk replied.  “I’ve gone to the Ministry trying to get some sort of system in place to report and record new spells.”
“I’m surprised she’s lasted this long,” Hermione said. “She should have eaten almost an hour ago.  Come on baby,” she cooed as she took Rose out of Draco’s arms. Hermione disappeared up the stairs for some privacy.
“Oi, Harry.  How was your date with Malfoy?” Seamus laughed.  “I hear he gives great head,” he teased.
In her high pitched, lilting voice, Luna urged her partner on, encouraging him or her to bring Luna the ultimate pleasure.
“I have a question for you,” Cummins smiled.  “Why the hell are you still here?  You should go find him.”
“I suppose the two of you will be waiting, seeing as you’ve only been together a short while,” Ron commented offhandedly.
A girl dressed as a sorceress was standing right in front of the cups for the pumpkin punch.  If Justin was to get one, he’d have to ask her to move.  He cleared his throat.
“Well, clearly you’ve interrupted.  And we need to bathe now.”  He leaned and kissed the side of Harry’s neck, never taking his eyes off Knox’s.  He wanted to make it quite clear that Harry was his, and his alone.
“Harry,” Knox turned to him. “I . . . just wanted to say that I’m sorry. I never meant to cause you any . . .” he trailed off.
“Yes.  Although, I need to disguise myself completely.  I’m going to change my hair and wear shoes that make me taller. But I won’t be able to see without my glasses.  Any ideas?”
Deciding to accept Knox’s apology, Harry said, “You didn’t. Draco and I are better than ever. We’re finally taking our honeymoon in a few weeks.”
“And you believed him.” Harry’s heart nearly broke at the hurt in Draco’s voice.  “Not that I should have to explain myself, but . . . I did hug the boy.  It was only because he was crying over a girl-- his former Potions partner.  Turns out, he got tongue-tied and nervous around her.  That’s why he was screwing up all the time.  And why he could make the potions when he was working with only me.  I know a thing or two about deep, unrequited crushes, so I was sympathetic to him.  I can’t believe you really thought I was carrying on behind your back with an underage boy.”
“Well, I for one am excited to be back,” Hermione offered.  “I can’t wait to see Hogwarts back to its familiar self.”
Tracey shrugged. “We didn’t really have anything in common, I guess.  I mean, he’s cute and all.  But we didn’t have much to talk about.”
“I was wrong.  I was wrong to make generalizations about Voldemort’s followers, the way purebloods are wrong about muggle borns.  I understand now, the fear and manipulation Tom Riddle used to control people.  And I’ve matured enough to recognize that a person’s character should be judged by his own actions, and not by those around him.”
be gay?  Harry asked himself what he wanted from Draco.  Did he simply like the way Draco looked?  Maybe he only admired him. Did he like the way other boys looked?  Could he imagine himself doing with a boy, what he did with Daphne or Pansy or Ginny?  It certainly would be easier to please another boy.  He was well acquainted with the proper parts.  Girls were still a bit of a mystery.  Knowing the general anatomy wasn’t always enough to get the job done without a little assistance on the girl’s part.
Harry hugged him tightly again.  “I feel it too.  I shouldn’t have tried to hide my feelings from you.”  They pulled apart and chuckled. “We’re a sorry lot,” Harry said.  “We could have gone on not knowing the other wanted the same thing and missed out completely.”
“I see your point.” Padma sympathized.  Although she’d gotten girls for the last two rounds, she did have an amazing night with Theo to start off.  “Holy shit, what did you do?”  Padma’s attention was diverted by her sister walking out of the boy’s dormitory.
Padma sat up on the floor in the Slytherin common room, where she had spent the night playing cards and gossiping with Millicent.
Seventh and Eighth Years gathered together in the Great Hall for the last meal before the rest of the students returned. Shepherd’s Pie was Ron’s favorite and he was happily piling more on his plate when he noticed Terry Boot, who had returned to Hogwarts a few days early, walk past Harry, bumping into him hard.  The glass of pumpkin juice Harry was holding spilled down the front of his robes and splashed a bit on Ron.  Harry gritted his teeth but otherwise remained calm.
Hermione blushed.  “No, I’m not worried about that. Although, you should definitely take care there.”  She cleared her throat and whispered, “It’s your heart that concerns me.”
Draco’s expression turned slightly dark.  “They’ve had a tough time of it, Blaise.  A lot tougher than you.  You wouldn’t even be here right now if it weren’t for some of those dorks. So leave them alone.”  Draco hadn’t meant to defend them so passionately, but the war was over thanks to many of them.  And Draco, for one, was grateful.
“Not really.  I’ve heard of binding magic, but I don’t think one person’s magic takes over.  It’s more like joining.  It’s been done at marriage ceremonies.”
“Actually, you should speak with him.”  He jerked a thumb in Harry’s direction.  “He’s the one who used it.”
She took Harry’s hands and placed them on either side of the crystal ball.  Olivia closed her eyes and began murmuring a spell.
“And even if you did have ugly scars, it wouldn’t matter to me.  I’m hardly one to judge someone else’s looks,” Harry smirked.
“You thought I cheated on you, so you cheated back? You know, if you preferred him, why not just tell me?  Why string me along?”
Harry’s mouth became a small, straight, tension-filled line. Yes, he felt guilty.  But that didn’t mean he wasn’t sincere. “Draco, I–”
If Draco had used the word girl, woman, or wife, Harry would have felt that any answer he gave would be a lie.  Because he said partner, Harry allowed himself to indulge.
At once, Draco raised his wand and called out, “Stupify!”  The blast went right next to Harry’s head, sending him to the floor.
Harry had a sense of déjà vu as Draco pulled out the bottle of firewhiskey they had drunk from the previous week.  He briefly wondered if the evening would end the same embarrassing way.  Harry would have to make certain it didn’t.
Draco grinned.  “It’s sort of fun, isn’t it?  Hiding your identity, wearing a mask?  Of course, as professors, we’ll need to be fairly easy to spot, in case a student needs us.”
“Sometimes, I can’t believe you weren’t sorted into Slytherin,” he commented.  “That was brilliant use of Auror training.”
“I’m not going to calm down.  I’m tired of everyone having to know my business.”  Harry stood up.  “But if they want to know, then I’ll tell them.”
They continued to eat without any more discussion on the subject.  But the damage had been done.  Draco was anxiously thinking about his father’s fate.
She nodded, bat added, “Surely, you realize he made those changes for you.”  She smiled at the look of surprise on Harry’s face.  “He confessed certain feelings to me when he was younger.  I never thought he would act on those feelings, or that you could possibly return them.  But if that was what motivated him to become a better man, who was I to question it?”
Pursing his lips together, Ron smiled apologetically. He knew he often gave mixed signals or made comments suggesting that he was less than thrilled to have Draco so entrenched in Harry’s life.  “Yeah, sorry about that.  It’s still sort of a bit strange for me, you know?”
Hermione placed the chopsticks in Draco’s hand and showed him how to move his hand to open and close them.  As she did, he glanced down at her hand.
Malfoy considered Hermione’s words.  Draco certainly wouldn’t have helped out of the goodness of his heart.  But to secure a position in the Ministry, he might.
Finally, the corner of Draco’s mouth raised in a sort of half smile.  He didn’t look into Harry’s eyes as he spoke, but rather into an unseen distance.
Thinking a moment longer.  “Someone who’s strong, but has a soft side,” he said quietly.  “Maybe one that only I get to see.”
Slipping his hand into his secret pocket, Harry mumbled a rather complicated spell, closing his eyes for a moment. Draco stared at his lover intently until he felt the shimmer of the glamour take effect. He’d done simple glamours on himself, but he’d never felt the buzz of power he did at the moment.
Harry could only hum in response, as his mouth was occupied. It served to help bring Draco closer to the edge.
“It appears the rumors are true. I should have bet Tracey,” she said, straightening out her own clothing.
“He’s a wonderful story teller,” Draco began, until Harry nudged him with his knee. Getting the point that Harry wasn’t quite ready to announce his aspirations, he added, “Harry has told me about his many adventures while at Hogwarts, some that most people have never heard, I reckon.”
Draco could feel the stare from across the table in the library.  He tried his best to ignore it.  Continuing to write, Draco glanced back and forth between the parchment he was working on and the notes Harry had taken earlier.
“You didn’t even ask me what I wanted,” Harry pointed out.  “How do you know I wouldn’t have said to leave the game as it was?”
She glanced at the elder Malfoy and shook her head. “No, I don’t think so.  He tried to keep his cool back at Azkaban, but he was worried for his son.  He said something about the Manor defending itself, which it would only do if there was something catastrophic going on inside.  The back door wards were created so that Draco and his parents were the only ones able to escape, should the need arise,” Hermione explained.
“Oh, yeah, Draco.  That’s good.” Harry spread his legs a little to accommodate.  “Just a bit more to the left . . . your right.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, feeling his face warm.  Whether from embarrassment or the quick consumption of wine, he wasn’t certain.
“We have time,” Harry said.  Now that he felt things would eventually fall into place, he was less anxious.  And he could afford to be patient.  “Thank you,” he whispered and squeezed Draco’s hand.
Draco continued lavishing attention while Harry grew closer to his own climax. Harry kept Draco on the edge with an occasional lick or suck.
“You think Draco is the first person to fall in love with you, Harry?” Ron laughed.  “I’ll bet there were lots of girls that thought they were in love with you while we were still in school.”
“That cake?” Harry pointed to the plate on Ron’s side table.  The rest of the cake sat behind it with a chunk missing.
“That would explain a lot,” Draco smiled, then inhaled sharply. “I’m getting close.”  He ran his hands over Harry’s sides and hips.
He leaned back to grin at her.  His face dropped when he saw a tear, then another, fall down the side of her cheek.
“I’m the Slytherin Bi that Pansy mentioned,” Draco was beginning to slur his words as well.  He tried to concentrate long enough to ask his last question.
Feeling better, Draco walked back to his own room.  By the time he got into bed that night, he was actually looking forward to their supper with Ron and Hermione.  He decided Blaise didn’t need to know about that.
Narcissa sat to Lucius’ left. Draco sighed and assumed it would be best for him to sit next to his father to spare anyone else the unpleasant task. The Weasleys filled in the other spots from the opposite end of the table, leaving a place for Harry beside Draco.
“I would love to, Mother.  But I’ve neglected some work at school this weekend.  We should really be getting back.  Another time?”
“Has anyone ever told you you have a beautiful cock? So pink and rosy. It’s just begging me to put my mouth around it.”
Though Draco didn’t consider being gay a choice, he decided to let the comment pass, for the time being.  That was an entirely different conversation. And he and his father had finally found some common ground beyond polite tolerance.
Harry looked up to see Draco walking in.  Their eyes met briefly before a very tall man with shoulder length brown hair approached Draco and held his hand out to shake. Tearing his gaze from Harry, Draco directed his attention toward the other man, smiling politely.  He took the offered hand and was gently pulled forward as the tall brunette kissed his cheek.
“Well, then it’s time to start a new tradition.”  Hermione picked up a black leather helmet.  “This one is quite stylish.”
Ollivander went behind the counter to ring up Draco’s purchase. After paying, Draco asked him how he knew about the pair of them.
The three remaining wizards glanced awkwardly at one another. In the mean time, the server brought their drinks.  Harry downed his almost immediately.  The server left, saying she would return to take their food order.
House elves cleared the supper dishes and placed small plates of raspberry sorbet along side chocolate layer cake in front of each guest. Slughorn sent the owl back on her way and sat down.
“Lucius,” Harry said, holding out his hand, diffusing the tension between father and son, and taking it upon himself.
Draco shook his head. “No, I don’t want there to be secrets.  He just explained that he looked into Dark objects as a way to cure my mother.  He’d also been searching for something called a resurrection stone, in hopes of bringing my— Druella, back to life.  He was in a desperate state.  It was simply a myth some Death Eater used to suck him back in. What?”
“People will forget, in time,” Harry tried to assure him.  He reached over and took the bottle from Draco’s grasp.  After sipping some firewhiskey, Harry asked him, “So, what
The first jet hit the back of Draco’s throat, triggering him to swallow.  He tried his best to keep up with subsequent sprays, but it was too much and jizz began to drip out of the corner of Draco’s mouth and down his chin.
“You’re not asking.  I’m offering,” Draco said.  “Actually, I’m insisting.  I’ll tell Harry, then be at your flat shortly.”
Smiling with approval, Hermione said, “Then we’ll just start with the Ministry and see what happens. I’ll get right on this.  I just need to find something to do with Rose.”
“I should have realized it was just a game,” Parvati explained.  “But Michael and I got each other’s wands twice.  I thought that meant something more than it did, I guess.”
“Your mother must have been quite extraordinary.”  He held out the tome for Harry to take.  “You should keep it.”
Dean listened at the door for a moment before cracking it open.  He glanced around the small common room.  “They’re gone.  I guess they went into his room.”
“The Manor is protecting itself.  Only a Malfoy may enter or exit, with the proper spell.” Lucius announced.  “My son will not be able to get out on his own.  I never told him the spell.”
Not wanting to take even a tiny chance at losing their opportunity, Harry swiftly agreed. “We’ll be there first thing in the morning.  Thank you!”
Harry was pleased by the vague question. “Sort of.  I’m still getting used to it. But I do like it.”
“Hurry up and lock the door,” Harry urged.  Harry made it a point to make sure the door was properly locked after Hermione walked in on him the previous week.
“Magic has a frequency, like sound waves or light waves.  And each wizard has a relatively unique one. Not nearly as unique as fingerprints, mind you.  But as long as Harry and, um,” Cummins paused.
“I look forward to it,” Draco said and walked down the stairs toward the dungeons.  He smirked to himself.  He’d go easy on the ginger, so as not to embarrass him in front of his friends too much.  How good could Weasley possibly be?
“I didn’t mean to insult you,” Draco rolled his eyes.  “Granger just seems the sort to appreciate items with history rather than something shiny and new.”  He began to walk away.  “Whatever.”
?  I don’t intend to be a father for–” Draco clamped his mouth shut, realizing what he was saying.  “Shit,” he cursed under his breath.
“We didn’t really talk about it. I just assumed that was what most people wanted, eventually.  I suppose I should have realized Draco could have a different outlook on the subject, considering his own family life.”
“Fuck it,” Draco said, pulling away.  He threw off his robe, then quickly unbuckled his arm and shin guards.
“There was nobody else down there.  Everyone slept in and I didn’t want to eat alone,” Draco replied coolly, making light of the gesture.
“Why are you acting so strangely?” Hermione pouted.  “Any other time, you’re begging me for some excitement.  And tonight you’re acting like virgin on his first date.”
“Not today Mr. Zabini,” Slughorn advised.  “Next time don’t be late. It appears that Miss Brocklehurst needs a partner.”
“I have season tickets,”  Draco said.  “It’s one of the few things to which I treat myself.  You should come with me to the Harpies/Bats match.”
“Thank you, Harry.”  She put an arm around him and pulled him a bit closer.  She whispered into his ear.  “Go easy on Draco.  He’s a young man with plans for a future.  Don’t push him into a family.  Remember, he hasn’t had the best family life.  If it’s meant to be, it will be.”
Harry stared at the brand new person with awe. He, too, thought she was perfect.  A perfect piece of both Ron and Hermione, created out of pure love. He felt a hand slip into his and turned his head to find Ginny, rather than Draco belonging to the hand.
“It’s okay.  I was surprised is all.”  She didn’t make a move, but the way she stayed close made Justin think he should try again.
Draco’s head whipped around.  Did he hear Harry correctly?  Perhaps Harry misheard him.  At that moment, the Harpies scored again and Harry cheered wildly, unaware that Draco was watching him.
“Yes, I do.  Harry, I want to hear that this is what you want.  And that Draco is treating you well.  He is, isn’t he?”
“And once you leave Hogwarts, it’ll only get more difficult to renew your relationship.  What if he meets someone else?” Pansy asked.
As Draco came, his muscles clenched tightly around Harry, bringing him along. They kept eye contact through their climaxes, feeling closer than ever before.
“Was I?” Draco smirked. “I think your standards of amazing have fallen a bit.  All I did was sit in a corner and read a children’s book.”
Pansy began to laugh along with Blaise until she saw the expression on Draco’s face.  He was glaring at her in disbelief.
“Good thing tomorrow is Sunday.  You’re going to have one hell of a hangover.  I assume I won’t see you at breakfast.  Better get some sleep.” Draco patted his shoulder.
Draco’s mouth dropped open as he watched Knox make his move.  Harry’s hand reached up and fisted Knox’s shirt.  Feeling as though he may vomit, Draco turned and walked swiftly out of the library.
“No.  She taught me everything.  I had no idea what I was doing.”  Neville paused.  “I guess I shouldn’t have told that either.”
He glanced down at the bare chest before him once more, this time noticing several faint scars. Then it dawned on him.
Harry laughed. “You don’t have to whisper. They can’t hear us.” He stopped laughing when he saw the look of pure lust in Draco’s eyes. He gasped when Draco palmed his crotch.
Instantly, Pansy pushed him back.  His eyes sprang open as he realized what he’d just said.  Though both were painfully close to orgasm, it was as if a cold shower rained reality down on them.  They stared at one another, absorbing Harry’s words, or more precisely, word.  The weight of it hanging over them.
“So, in other words, you’re open to possibilities.  Good. I’ll do some research on the pros and cons of adoption versus surrogacy and we can go from there.  Oh, this is so exciting.”
“Oh, yes, you couldn’t get rid of books. Your family must have an extensive collection,” Hermione perked up.
Continuing up Harry’s face, Draco followed the curve of his lips and the contours of his nose.  He found that he could stare all day and never tire of memorizing each and every line and shadow.
Ron and Harry left the shop with the clerk waving wildly behind them.  She’d given Ron the discount, but the boys were asked to autograph a post card for her. It was a small price to pay.
Draco shrugged.  “Why wouldn’t I be all right.  Once again, I’m the laughing stock.  My students can’t concentrate on the lessons I’m teaching.  Oh, and Professor McGonagall has offered to give me some time off.”
Draco watched as Harry unwrapped a book about dream interpretation from Hermione and a Reusable Hangman game from Ron.  Ron also gave him bruise remover paste, along with a short note about trying it for the hickeys Draco left on his neck constantly.
Sunday morning, Harry opened his eyes to a bright sunny day.  He was feeling anything but sunny, however.  How was he supposed to face Draco after practically walking in on him and Zabini?
“I won’t lie and say I’m happy about it,” Ron said honestly.  “But I guess he’s not so bad anymore.  He did give me good advice.” Ron held up the bag from the second-hand shop.  Then he remembered the Halloween dance.  “Blimey, was that you dressed up like a cowboy or something?”
“Harry,” Draco murmured.  He sucked at Harry’s neck, lost in his scent, while Harry gently rubbed circles on Draco’s back.
Laughing, rather than getting angry, Tracey agreed.  “In other words, slutty and mean? I think that’s because of Pansy and Daphne.  We’re not all like that.”
Harry kept his eye on his potion, ignoring Ron’s question, which only convinced Ron even more that he was correct.
“It’s just a day, Draco.  Made up as a holiday by someone.  Simply think of it as just February fourteenth. We can go out the next day.”
“For you?  Anything.  I’ll try to get along with the git.  But if he steps out of line, I really will punch him.”
Like before, couples wandered off to private areas leaving Harry and Draco standing uncomfortably close in the Slytherin common room.
Draco sighed. “Sorry. I know you’re trying your best. I really don’t know if it will come down. I never paid much attention to it.”
“Why don’t you go talk to them,” Harry told Draco.  “Ron and Hermione will keep me company. You can come back later.”
“I’m getting worse,” Draco said. “I guess I did this for nothing. I thought confession was supposed to be good for the soul. But it seems to be breaking the one part of me that wasn’t damaged tonight.”
“Yeah, I guess he has.  But crikey, that story you told me about his family.  No wonder he was the way he was.”
Harry wanted to speak up.  He wanted to tell Ron to stop treating him like a child who needs protection, and to stop treating Draco like a criminal.  But his best friend and his lover seemed to have come to an understanding, on their own.  And he thought it best to leave it alone for the time being.  He waved to the server, who hesitated before walking over.
Suddenly, Draco reached out to where he was still certain Harry was standing and disapparated them both.
“Pfft,” Ron waved her off.  “Come on, he tells you more than he tells me.”  Unfortunately for Ron, he was correct.  “So, is it?”
“I was a freak to them.  They knew about me, even though I didn’t. I was as much a freak in the muggle world as I was here.”
“You will dear.  You’re a fine, handsome young man.”  She patted his hand and leaned closer.  “Any wizard would be lucky to catch you.”
“You’re just jealous.  You’ve always been jealous of me.  You could have chosen to fight on the right side.  Maybe if you hadn’t been such a coward . . . Merlin, even Snape turned out to be a hero!” Harry regretted it the second it left his lips.  Draco had hit perhaps a little too close to home, and Harry lashed out.  He had come to confess the kiss and apologize, not start an argument.
“I don’t think you’re ridiculous.  I think you’re jealous, and full of self-doubt, regardless of what you’ve accomplished.  And I don’t know how to convince you that Knox, or anyone else, isn’t going to come between us.  It’s tiresome.”
They stayed a few more hours, going on rides and catching a Spiderman show.  Harry even won a very large stuffed animal for Draco at one of the carnival games.  But he swore he didn’t use magic.
“I was afraid that we were affected by the spells of the game as well.”  Draco hung his head.  “I asked Pansy to leave the charms in place.”
“Now there’s a story for you to write,” Draco said. “Harry Potter, Master of Death. All right, you’ve pulled me out of my mood.  You can stop teasing me now.”
“Some things do,” Harry replied softly.  He rested his hand on the bench next to him.  With his other hand, he picked up his glass to drink.
As he slid a finger inside, Draco gently squeezed Harry’s bollocks until his cock rose to full mast.  He playfully swatted Harry’s hand away when it tried to grip his erection.
“No clever comeback?  I’m who I always was. I never pretended to be more.  I thought you accepted that.  Ever since Knox came into the picture, you’ve acted like I was being unreasonable, like I was a paranoid, insecure prat.   And after all your protests, you were unfaithful.  Some hero.”
With a burst of energy, Harry thrust quickly, fucking Draco while Draco’s fingers fucked him. He came with a whimper and a satisfied moan, then collapsed on top of Draco.
“Because that conversation actually happened.  About an hour ago.”  Draco blinked as if physically hit by his next thought.  “Harry, are you using Legilimency on me?”
Harry chuckled.  “Sorry.  I just can’t see your parents allowing you to join in on such . . . childish fun.”
“Are you insinuating that I don’t have good taste in men? Because I assure you, I have the best taste in everything.” Draco sat up and looked down at Harry.  “You are the most striking man--
“No, I heard you,” Harry interrupted.  “I, I thought you wanted me to be the one . . . you know, who takes it,” he said in all sincerity, looking down embarrassedly at his hands.
“No,” she answered. “Nobody knows why there are squibs.  Same as no one knows why some muggle couples can have a magical child.”
“Dean, a baby is a huge responsibility.  One that I’m not certain we’re ready for.  And Harry has a right to know.”
“I think I like your compromise,” Draco smiled.  “But I don’t like this scarf thing.”  He pulled the bandana down off Harry’s face.  “That’s better.”
“I’m saying that I’ve come around to your way of thinking.  We don’t need children to be a family.  We’re already a bit unconventional,” Harry chuckled. “And apparently, I’m not good with babies.”
“Mr. Malfoy, just a few more questions.” Another Interrogator sat at a table with two other members of the Wizengamot, while the Chief Warlock presided at a large desk that loomed over the others. As it was simply a hearing, and not a trial, the full Wizengamot was not present.  Draco sat by Lucius’ side in the middle of the room. They’d been questioning Lucius for nearly an hour already.
Pressing harder against Harry’s now fully erect cock inside his trousers, Daphne found a rhythm that pleased her as well as him.  She rode up and down, pausing ever so slightly before changing direction.  Suddenly, she picked up her pace and whimpered into Harry’s mouth.  Her body jerked, then stilled as she gripped Harry’s arse tighter and forced him harder against her.
“Why aren’t you in costume?” Harry questioned.  She was wearing clothing which closely resembled what she tended to wear daily.
“You shouldn’t dismiss the Slytherin team this year, though,” Harry said to Knox.  “Their Keeper has the best record.”
Laughing, Harry told him, “At least you’re trying.  They’re coming around six o’clock.  We’ll bring supper to your room, if that’s okay.”
Draco led them down to the dungeons, near Slytherin.  He put his finger to his lips, motioning for Harry to be extra quiet as they approached Draco’s House.  Two students unexpectedly came out into the corridor, but they were too busy giggling to see Harry and Draco squashed against the wall behind a pillar.
“You don’t understand, Draco.  It was you I couldn’t handle.” Lucius’ voice cracked as it raised. “Yes, you probably would have been able to comprehend what was going on.  But I couldn’t be around you.  I couldn’t look at you.  Everything about you reminded me of what I’d lost.”
“And then I said, anyone who would be in my bedroom would already know that.” Draco laughed.  “Or something along those lines.”
“You’re not taking over my life.  I’m choosing to spend it with you,” Draco responded.  “If you’d rather not spend so much time with me--”
Fearing that he’d gone too far, Draco’s mind reverted back to self-doubt.  The awkward silence was too much for him, despite the promise he had just made to himself in the bedroom but a few moments earlier.  He was about to get up, when Harry finally spoke.
Standing up, he swayed, then plopped back down.  He wasn’t quite drunk enough not to realize he was in no shape to go out, much less apparate anywhere.
Harry disapparated back to the Ministry building. As he walked back to his office, he realized that he and Draco had spent the past hour and a half together, talking practically non-stop. And they hadn’t even shagged. He was beginning to think Draco was by far the best choice he’d ever made. He’d better not fuck it up.
Slowly, Harry walked into the room.  It was decorated in rich hunter green and silver, clearly reflecting Draco’s House colors.  Though dark, the room was anything but drab.  The shiny satin walls and bed coverings reflected the candlelight from the silver sconces lining the walls.  A sheer covered picture window and French doors leading to a balcony let in the moon light, making the room all the more inviting.
“Boy, am I glad you gave her a project to work on,” said Ron. “She’s been going stir crazy not working for the past eight months.”
“Well, Harry, I’m not getting any younger,” Flitwick answered.  “I’d like to do some traveling.  Maybe even to America.  It just seemed like a good time.”
Putting a reassuring hand on Draco’s shoulder, McGonagall told him, “I’ve arranged to have your classes covered for the next week so you may tend to your mother.  Draco, she’s expected to make a full recovery in time.”
Harry was tired.  Exhausted.  He’d stayed up all night, trying to keep Draco alive. And now, eight and a half hours after Lucius came to rescue them, Harry wanted nothing more than to go home and sleep.  Maybe he’d just rest there in his office before going to Ron’s flat.
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s arm. “Well, I don’t mind. I’ve lived with secrets far too long. Frankly, I don’t care what other people think anymore.”
The other Fourth Year, a girl sat with her eyes glued to the floor as she nibbled a crumpet.  She was blushing furiously.  Euan nudged her.
“I guess I didn’t forgive him fast enough.  I was just being jealous again.  Don’t worry about it.”  Draco turned away to end the call.
“Mm,” Draco hummed against Harry’s throat.  “February?  That’s a dreadful month to get married.  Besides, two weeks isn’t enough time.”
“Yes.  I once found an enchanted quill there.  The shop manager thought it was defective because it didn’t write what he dictated.  Instead, it told the story of the previous owner, in poetry.  My mother adored it.”
Harry was more apprehensive than he had been before his very first kiss ever. He closed his eyes and waited for Draco to make contact.  When his soft, full lips touched Harry’s, it felt to Harry as if he were shocked by an electrical outlet.  It had happened to him a few times at the Dursley’s and it sent a not altogether unpleasant buzzing throughout his body.  Kissing Draco gave him a similar sensation.
“Of course, we may need a change of plans,” Draco said casually. “Harry’s been too modest to tell you himself, but his agent has found a publisher for his book, The Philosopher’s Stone.”  As a side note, he added, “Did you know that they’ve heard of Nicolas Flamel in the muggle world?”
Ron noticed Hermione with her brow furrowed.  “What’s wrong, luv?  Don’t judge Harry.  He of all people deserves a good time once in a while.”  He glanced at Ginny who was scowling at him.  “Not that you weren’t a good time.  Ugh. I didn’t mean that.  I’m gonna shut up now.”  He shoved a bun into his mouth.
“Oh, I didn’t lie about that.  I mean, I’m not a master yet. But I’ve been apprenticing with an apothecary for two years.”
“Simply because you use elements of your real life doesn’t lessen the story,” Draco said.  “People draw on their personal lives for inspiration all the time.”
Inwardly, Draco beamed.  Harry had taken his name proudly and wasn’t letting Lucius get the better of him.  It gave Draco the strength to do the same.
“All right, I will.”  Romlida scanned the room for a lone party goer to approach.  She spotted two definitely male figures standing on the far side of the room.  She grabbed Padma’s arm.
Arching his back, Harry let out a loud groan.  He came hard and long onto his own chest.  His lover had long since released his cock and Harry had his fingernails dug into Draco’s back. He couldn’t recall ever cumming before without constant friction of some sort.  The thought was short-lived, as a wave of the pain Draco had been feeling hit Harry.  He felt as if his heart–no, not his heart, his soul, was being sucked out of him.  His eyes sprang open to see his lover grimacing as he emptied himself into Harry.
“Harry.” He faced Draco. “Are you sure you want to rehash the past, considering that we seem to have come to an understanding?”
“What makes you say that?” Harry shifted his weight from foot to foot and glanced at the mantle clock.
Harry’s gaze lowered just a bit to Draco’s lips, being licked by his wet, pink tongue.  “I, I’m not certain.”
“You just woke me from a wonderful dream,” he said.  “A handsome man was giving me the most wonderful blow job,” he smirked.
“I didn’t see that side of your hair before.  It’s coming out of the ponytail.  It’s kind of sexy,” Harry grinned.
Harry whispered a spell, then Accioed a hidden bottle of lube, readying Draco for a finger.  Then two. Pumping in and out.  In and out.  Slowly, in and out.
Harry received permission from the Headmistress for Draco and himself to leave Hogwarts briefly on September first. Though she wasn’t thrilled at having them both gone, she understood how important it was for Harry to have Draco by his side. She confided to him that she was looking forward to being the first Headmistress to welcome a family into the castle.
With great difficulty, they restrained themselves from having sex in the shower.  Though there was a bit of gratuitous touching under the guise of helping each other clean.
By then, Lucius had also calmed down a bit.  “You don’t know what it’s like to lose a child.  Or your wife.”  He glanced at Harry.  “Or your husband.”
Draco kept his movements slow and steady, wanting the lovemaking to last as long as possible.  He’d been fantasizing for years about this night.  And he would milk it for all it was worth.
“Inside, the Manor looks quite different from when the Dark Lord took over.  Mother has done some renovations.  I still wouldn’t call it cheery.  But it’s not nearly as creepy as it was.”
Ron grumbled again.  He glanced over at Malfoy sitting with his usual crowd.  “What about everybody else?”
McGonagall stood and smiled.  “Everyone, may I introduce our newest Potions professor, Draco Malfoy.”
“Shit!  Wait, I gave you the wrong piece,” Ron called out, but Hermione was already halfway down the staircase.  “Fucking Hell,” he cursed.
It wasn’t the ‘no’ Hermione was expecting.  She cleared her throat.  This was uncharted territory for her.  And although she had an open mind, she wasn’t sure what to say to her friend. His answer left room for the possibility that he was attracted to men, or at least one in particular.
“Maybe,” Draco shrugged a shoulder.  “My father isn’t the only one who behaved less than exemplary.  I wish I had known . . . I wish I could do things over differently.”
Harry’s heart sank. Through his Auror training, he knew that Draco was going into shock. There wasn’t very much Harry could do beyond basic first aid. “I’ll be right back.”
The book floated effortlessly in the air as Draco moved the wand about. Harry caught it when it nearly hit him in the head.
“What about you, Weasley?” Pansy smirked.  “Unless you’re afraid you’ll get in trouble,” she teased.
He broke the kiss and removed his glasses and put them in his shirt pocket.  “I guess I don’t need these anyway.”
They ended the call, and Draco took another potion for the pain in his head.  He dearly wished there was a potion for the pain in his heart.  But Hermione’s words gave him hope.
“When are you going to learn, Potter?  I trust you with everything, with my very life.  And my most prized possession.”
Standing awkwardly off to the side, Draco was regretting that he and his parents agreed to such a ridiculous invitation.  The families were able to pull together enough for the wedding, but it was too much to ask in such a small, intimate setting. And so out of the Malfoy element.
“Harry, you just said yourself that it’s just a day.  We can go out on Saturday.  Any place you’d like.”
Harry squeezed Narcissa’s shoulder as he stood next to her.  “I know it was a nickname for you as well. Is that all right?  If it’s not too difficult for you.”
“You should probably be resting,” Harry chided.  “Is your father staying with you?  Actually, I’m surprised he let you out of his sight.”
“You’re impossible.”  He plopped himself on the bed. “So what shall we do today?  What sorts of entertainment does this little town of Triora offer?”
“Either way, you’ll have to go back to your flat. As fit as I think you are, my pajamas aren’t your size,” Draco smirked.
“Lucky for us, they do,” Harry said.  He gave a concerned look to Hermione.  “Do you think it’s wrong, that they won’t have a mother?”
“We’re dressing up in Renaissance clothing.  Very traditional, but Ron doesn’t want to wear anything outlandish,” she laughed.  “Instead of his dress robes, he’ll wear a muggle-type suit.”
Draco shook his head.  “No.  In fact, I think he’s starting to fall for me.”  He ran a finger across his own lip.
Justin put the mask he was hiding, on his face and waited, for what seemed like forever. He was about to give up when Millicent stepped through the opening. She wasn’t sure what she was expecting, but she didn’t expect him to be wearing his mask from the dance.
“Well, I didn’t really want to wake Nikki anyway.  She can be a real bugger when she hasn’t had enough sleep.”  Bill paused. “And I hate to admit that she seemed to take to him. Nikki doesn’t warm to strangers easily.  Hell, it takes her a while just to let Mum give her a hug. I suppose he’ll make a decent father someday.”
For a while, they leisurely rocked together, kissing and touching.  A few times, Harry made a move toward his own cock, laughing lightly when Draco grabbed his hand away and held it above Harry’s head.
“And rightly so, Ron,” she said.  “Babies’ cries mean different things.  If you silence them, you won’t know what the baby needs.”
Harper sat up, indignant.  “It’s not make-up.  It’s guyliner.  And lots of boys wear it.  Some aren’t even gay.”
She smiled back, shaking her head.  “I was so stubborn about that bloody cake that I ruined the moment for myself.  He was so romantic about the whole thing.”
“You’re not bringing me down,” Harry said.  He caressed the side of Draco’s face and gave him a small kiss.
“My mother hadn’t written down all the rules or the spells necessary, but she alluded to a book somewhere in the Slytherin common room that details it all.  We just have to find it.”
Draco crossed his arms over his chest.  “So, now I’m not allowed to even talk to you in public?  Isn’t that sort of going backwards?  I thought we were working toward being out in the open.”
“You did what?” Ron questioned.  “When did you decide that? You were always going on about a family when Hermione was up the duff.  You even volunteered to babysit, which I thought was completely bonkers.”
The following Sunday, Draco knocked on Harry’s door armed with a new book he was sure Harry would find appealing.  Over a month into their relationship, it had become routine for the pair to spend Sunday afternoons in one of their chambers reading together by the fire.  The challenge was to actually get through a book, or even part of book.  They’d either end up snogging or falling asleep.
“You don’t know about the passage to Hogsmeade?  I suppose it is somewhat secret.  But the Gryffindors know about it,” he replied.
Harry sighed.  “All right, then.  Let’s go back and look at their applications.  Maybe we could list pros and cons?”
“Are you sure?  If you’re worried you’ll drop him, you could sit in a chair and I’ll hand him to you.”
Pansy called for quiet.  “Has everyone placed their wand in the cauldron?  Anybody not done so yet?”
“I was kind of hoping to visit Ron and Hermione.  Rose is already a month old and we’ve only seen her once since she was born.”
“I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to invite the other Houses.  This year breaks so many traditions already,” Draco suggested.  “But no one below seventh year.”
“I don’t know.  Maybe with all the drama of the war gone, it just sort of, fizzled out.  It was like, I started thinking of her as more of a sister, and it didn’t feel right to--”
“Well, it doesn’t matter.  We’d be married by the time the baby was born and there would be nothing Harry could do about it.  My name would be on the birth certificate.”
Swallowing hard, Ron nodded.  “Now we have to get you and Ginny back together and everything will be back to normal.”
Draco watched as his fingers fiddled nervously. “She’s stolen my heart.  I find myself thinking about her often. And wondering when we’ll get together with Ron and Hermione so I can see her again.”
been sitting in front of the fire earlier, talking pleasantly and continuing to drink butter beer for the past hour.  Being from different Houses, they knew little about one another and so they chatted about superficial things.  Michael was a rather shy boy and hadn’t made any moves on the Gryffindor girl, though her thought her quite pretty.  He had just started to stretch his arms above his head in a contrived move to put an arm around her, when they heard the banging.  He quickly withdrew his arm and glanced around for the source.  No one else was in the common room at the time, however, both the boy’s and girl’s Seventh and Eighth Year dormitories were occupied by wand party couples.
Much to Harry’s frustration, Draco insisted on hanging his new dress robes neatly in the wardrobe before beginning any sort of romantic activities.  Harry hung his as well, avoiding a lecture about wrinkling his clothes again.
“I want you all to be on time tomorrow and attentive.  I have an announcement to make that should interest all of you.”
“This is a two week long project that includes a research essay on a new potion of your choice as well as a potion challenge on the last day.  You must hand in your essay on time in order to participate in the challenge.”
“I don’t know.  I heard Malfoy plays both sides of the field, if you know what I mean,” Parvati told them.
“But Olivia said they were yours.  And they have red hair and freckles.  They sound like they could be yours and Ginny’s.”
“You know,” Blaise said, shoving a spoonful of pudding into his mouth.  “It wouldn’t be the worst thing for Potter to come out.  We could use a bit of an image boost.” Blaise looked at Harper, who was licking gravy from his fingers.  “Everyone thinks all gays are like him.”
When they got to their dormitory, Draco began taking out clothes for his usual rendezvous with Harry.
“Rita Skeeter here, speaking with the elusive Harry Potter in his first interview since Nineteen ninety-nine. So, tell me Harry, why now?  Why are you finally breaking your silence to give me this exclusive interview?”
Harry laughed.  “First of all, I had a very nice time with Althea.  But she won’t be at all surprised when you tell her about me.”
She took out a napkin filled with buns, chips and a piece of apple pie. “I didn’t take any pork, sorry.”
Draco’s eyes were large and wide while his father yelled at him.  He felt like a child being disciplined.  He snorted and took in a breath, but before he could speak a word, a hand gripped his arm.
“You’re going to put that on hold for now,” Draco instructed.  “That will keep until Ginny and Dean get back.  They’re not going to marry before the New Year.”
Draco continued to carry on polite conversation with Professor Flitwick for the remainder of supper.  Once in a while he peeked over at Harry, finding him gawking a bit.
“I didn’t mean to imply that you did.” Draco reached out to put his hand over his mother’s.  “I only meant that perhaps we could arrange to unveil a new headstone.  One with a name on it.  I know you told me you hadn’t settled on a name and that was why Father did what he did.  But perhaps . . .”
“I’m sorry,” Draco stopped smiling.  “I didn’t think you were ready to, to, you know, do what I did.  And I couldn’t help it.  You had me going so much, I had to cum.”
“He’s probably right,” Blaise agreed.  He looked at Harry and mouthed something Harry couldn’t make out.  Harry shrugged slightly.  He mouthed back
“I knew you would,” Harry said, smiling at Draco’s excitement. “I’m thirsty.  Let’s stop for lunch.”
Harry smiled.  “You’re perfect.  And you deserve to be loved perfectly.  I’m still learning.  I’ve never been in love,” he explained.
“Of course,” Wyndam said, grinning.  The thought of getting an interview with the Chosen One after all these years made him a bit giddy.  Harry had stopped giving interviews once the first couple of biographies had come out.  He felt he had said all that he planned to by then and was adamant about returning to a normal, peaceful life. Which he had managed to do until this latest fiasco.
They stood, still and panting, for as long as they dared, knowing there was a possibility someone could come by at any moment.
“Bloody hell, that was intense,” Draco panted, grabbing at his cock to squeeze out the last few drops.  “I don’t think I’ve ever cum just from being fucked.”
Draco turned away.  He didn’t appreciate being psychoanalyzed.  When he turned back, his mother was softly crying.
“Those so-called dreams you had before weren’t dreams at all, Harry.  You saw what Voldemort saw, or planned.  That wasn’t the same thing.”
Without answering, Mr. Ollivander walked to the back of the shop and stepped up onto a ladder. He pulled out a wand box, then turned around to look at Draco once more. He climbed up one more rung and retrieved a box from a higher shelf before descending. He was surprisingly agile for an old man.
She reached out for the book to examine, turning it over in her hands, running her fingers over the binding.
Leaning closer, Harry whispered, “Forget fucking my fiancé until he was nothing more than a puddle in my bed?”
“Draco, what about all those couples that really aren’t quite so in love as they think?  Is it really fair to force them to stay together?”
“Yes, I know,” Draco smirked. “I figured we could multitask. I’ll read and get us in the mood to meet our weekend goal.”
“Um, yeah, about that,” Ron began.  “I think my mum may have invited Draco’s parents to Easter brunch as well.”
“I’ve never kissed you in public before either,” Harry said, leaning in before Draco realized what he was doing.
Harry laughed. “It’s not that bad. At least everyone’s happy.” He paused. “Everyone but you, that is.”
“I’m sorry I got rid of all the beautiful decorating you did,” Draco told Harry.  He raised his wand.  “I can try to redo it.”
“No, no, we’re taking trains and a ferry boat,” Harry told him.  “We’ll apparate to London and take the Eurostar from there to Paris, then Milan, where we’ll stay overnight.  Then another train all through Italy where we’ll catch a ferry for the overnight ride to Greece.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s arm as he tried to go back into the house. “I’ve said our goodbyes already.  If you don’t mind.”
Draco raised an eyebrow.  His mother hadn’t mentioned it to him. Then he thought perhaps she was planning on springing it on his father at the last minute. It was probably better that way.
At last he found himself standing in front of Draco’s door.  Doubt crept its way into his mind and he faltered for a moment.  Then he knocked and waited.
Turning to Harry, Draco said, “I have to go.  With my father still in Azkaban, she’ll need me.  I’m sorry.”
He took her hand and placed it on his cock, guiding her to stroke it gently.  It felt fantastic, but he also wanted to prove to her that he was no slouch.  She opened her eyes to watch what she was doing.
Harry smiled.  “You know, the two of you might find you actually like each other if you give it chance.  I didn’t like the eleven-year-old you much either.”
“Mr. Potter, I believe you caused the binding.  And it was very dangerous.  You’re lucky Mr. Malfoy is as powerful as he is.  It could have turned out badly otherwise.  I’m still puzzled by the Mark’s disappearance, though.” The Healer reached out to Draco’s arm.
Draco took the towel off his head, leaving his hair just slightly damp and tousled. Harry had never seen him looking sexier. He bit his lip to remind himself not to pounce on the man.
“And we’ll have years to discover it all,” Harry smiled.  “As far as children go, I feel far too young to be a father.  Even though my own parents were only twenty when I was born.”
“You’ll have to forgive Fleur,” Bill said. “They have a different perspective on the matters of love where she’s from.”
“Here, I’ve broken it down by cost, time and rate of success.”  Hermione pulled out another parchment with a chart drawn on it.
Harry sighed heavily.  “I’m sorry.  You’re right.  Some of the other professors can be a bit intimidating.  What’s the problem?”
After Ron and Hermione said their goodbyes, Harry transfigured the single bed to accommodate both him and Draco.  They climbed in, exhausted from being mostly awake for the past twenty-seven hours.
“Do you really think so?”  Draco sniffed. He’d been trying so hard not to cry during their conversation that he was beginning to get a headache.
“I am Hermione.  I know, it doesn’t make sense.  A year ago, if you would have asked me, I would have said that I planned to get back together with Ginny and marry her someday.  I thought that would make me happy.”
Althea was a pretty girl.  Ron was right about that.  She looked to be a couple of years younger than he.  She worked at the Ministry in the Muggle Artifact department, as she was muggle born herself.  The witch wore modern muggle clothing and appeared very comfortable in this particular restaurant.  In many ways, she reminded Harry of Hermione.
But when he directed his attention to the back of the blond head across the room, he had an urge for physical contact. He wanted him to turn around.  He wanted to brush his hand against Draco’s again.  The pull was almost irresistible.
Ron shrugged. “All right, I guess. My dad told me the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts team is having a field day with all the stuff they found. They asked Dad to help catalogue it.”
“Why I didn’t Die When The Augurey Cried,” the librarian read aloud.  “Where in Merlin’s name did you get a first edition of this?  It was published in 1824.  We have a copy here in the library, but . . .”
Draco spooned Harry’s body and rubbed gentle circles around his nipples, teasing but not quite getting close enough.  He kissed the back of Harry’s neck, tasting the skin.
Harry leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on Draco’s neck.  Another sharp intake, but this time grey eyes opened.  Draco grinned at the sight of Harry poised over him.
“Buying something for your girlfriend?” Malfoy queried condescendingly.  He knew the items in question were most likely out of Ron’s price range.  Regretting the jab, he offered Ron some advice.
“His parents are muggles, very bitter about the wizard war.  They forbade their son to fight, but he didn’t listen.  The Creeveys had no use for the wand.”  The Headmistress put a hand on Harry’s shoulder.  “But it would have meant a great deal to Colin for you to have it.”
“I always fancied myself a top. Until you told me you wanted to shag me for days on end,” Draco gave a small smile. “I was afraid you wouldn’t go through with it if you knew I’d never . . . done that.”
“Not any more bonkers than I am for being with Ron,” she laughed.  It made him laugh too.  “But Harry, if anything comes of this, you’d better tell Ron yourself.  Don’t let him find out through rumor and innuendo.”
Gone were the meetings in Harry’s office.  Gone were the meals they sometimes shared afterward.  Gone was the occasional pint in the local pub.  Gone was his . . . friend.
“I enjoyed it immensely,” Draco grinned, licking leftover cum from his face where his tongue could reach.
Ms. Singleton pursed her lips. “Helping couples have children is what we do, through science and magic. However, the wizarding community is small compared to the muggle world. It’s finding a suitable surrogate that may be a problem.”
Harry apparated to Ron and Hermione’s building and stood looking up at the light in the window. He sighed. The last thing he felt like doing was being social. He’d have to tell them about Malfoy. And Hermione was sure to have many questions for him.
“I’m sorry.  I wasn’t trying to do anything. I was just . . .” Harry squeezed his eyes shut. “Just loving you.”
Draco dropped to his knees and unbuckled Harry’s belt.  The bulge in Harry trousers made them so tight, the blond had trouble popping the button.  When he freed Harry’s cock, at last, he intended to lick and suck well enough to make Harry forget all about his arse.
Harry let out a low growl of frustration.  Not only was Draco angry with him, he had missed breakfast.  He trudged up the stairs to his classroom, hoping not to take his frustrations out on the students.
Boot reached out and grabbed Draco by the collar.  He pushed him up against the wall.  “You fucking little weasel.  I’ll kill you.”
Harry smiled down at him.  “Reminds me of our first encounter.  Except that time, it was me that couldn’t hold out.”  He snickered.  “As I recall, you said I gave you one of the best blow jobs you’d received.”
Ron looked between Harry and Hermione. “Yep,” he said.  “I just wish, one time, the two of you didn’t feel like you had to keep things from me.”
When he was finally composed enough to speak, Harry pushed up on his elbows and gazed at the boy beneath him.  There was something he wanted to say.  He nearly did.  But he knew it would change the nature of their relationship, and so, instead, he said, “That was the most amazing shag, ever.  In the history of shags.”  He grinned.  “Was it good?  For you, I mean.  It was amazing for me.”
“I love how that thing points straight up.  It’s like a fucking steel rod.”  He pounced on it taking the whole length into his mouth, nearly gagging.  Lavishing attention on Harry’s dick briefly, Draco continued on his way to the intended target.  He stopped to lick his bollocks for a moment, then held Harry’s thighs and spread them wide.
Harry led Draco to the sofa and guided him to lie down.  Gazing down upon him, Harry couldn’t imagine how he could have believed his feelings for the blond were not genuine.
of their surroundings, but it was still the same surroundings.  The last time, he saw most of a white bird and a tall stone wall covered in ivy.  But mainly, he saw the two children’s happy faces.  He knew they were happy.  And loved.
Draco debated voicing his opinion, not wishing to upset Harry further.  But he’d brought it up and it was too late to backpedal.
Without waiting for an answer, Draco began to unbutton Harry’s shirt.  Harry watched his face as he concentrated on each button, then slid the shirt off his shoulders.  He was the most uniquely handsome man Harry had ever seen. He smiled, examining one of his most favorite of Draco’s features-- his long, white-blond eyelashes.  One almost had to be this close to Draco to see them.
Harry blushed at Draco’s innuendo.  “We must be going.  We don’t have much time before we leave Hogwarts for good.”
“Please, call me Harry,” he smiled and held out his hand.  When she took it loosely, she gave it one quick shake and released.
The pair made small talk about the weather and such, but Hermione couldn’t help stare at the places on her friend’s neck where she saw the love bites.
Harry and Draco watched her as she swirled the cup three times, then placed it upside down on the saucer.  Tifft turned the saucer back over and turned the handle toward herself.  She studied the leaves for a moment before speaking.
Their fried cheese and pints arrived and they each ordered a main dish from the limited menu.  They discussed the curriculums for their classes and speculated what this years crop of first years would be like.  Harry filled Draco in on new policies and gave him suggestions on when to give research assignments based on when other professors gave theirs.  Draco felt as though he should have been writing some of it down, but Harry assured him that he would be happy to help anytime.
They said their goodbyes to those who were left, and took the eggy bread, plus some sweets with them. When they got back to Hogwarts, most of the students were still on break, as well as some teachers, and the whole building seemed quiet.
Hermione nodded.  “You two seem to be on cloud nine.  Draco appeared a bit nervous but, the way he’s been looking at you all evening makes me think there’s a new development.”
“Maybe your family won’t mind.  He’s practically a girl anyway,” Draco laughed.  The remark earned him another scornful look.
“I . . . I can’t.”  Draco slowed then stopped completely.  The warm shower and steam had hastened his deflation.  “I’m sorry.”
“Maybe we could compare thoughts on the Quidditch teams this year,”  Harry suggested.  “I’ve always been a Puddlemere United fan myself.  And, of course, the Harpies as well, because of Ginny.”
Draco took a few smaller swallows and tipped his head back, indicating that he’d had enough. Before releasing Draco, Harry rolled up some of the dish towels to use as a pillow, then eased his head down.
They all raised their glasses.  Except for Draco, who refused to have anything else in his hand as long as he was holding little Cissy.
Sighing heavily, Justin sat watching Millicent as she leafed through a book she found on a small table.  She sat down on the other side of the window seat.  It was about as far away from him as she could get without getting that nauseous feeling.  Although, sitting near him made her a bit nauseous as well.  It wasn’t so much that he was unattractive, but he was a Hufflepuff for Merlin’s sake.  She wouldn’t even consider it.
On the other hand, the boys, the straight ones at least, weren’t finicky.  Most were wishing for someone easy, such as Pansy or one of the Greengrass girls.  But they were willing to take anyone.
“I found something better,” Draco told him.  “Besides, if I can give up family fortune, anyone can.”
“Hermione, I’m eighteen,” Harry rolled his eyes.  “I don’t think you were this concerned with what I was doing when I was twelve.”
After lunch was over, Harry followed Draco out.  Instead of stopping on the second floor, he continued on until he caught up with the blond.
Clearly, Harry’s efforts to keep their marriage and private life private had proven successful.  Of course, rumors were always circling about.  But Rita Skeeter did not get an exclusive interview about the wedding and all she had was speculation.  Neither Harry nor Draco’s names had appeared in print in months.  Draco suspected that the higher-ups in the Ministry didn’t pay much attention to the gossip columns anyway.
“Chump,” Blaise grinned.  “How about I take you to lunch tomorrow?  Take your mind off Potter for a while.”
“Harry, I give you this ring today as a symbol.  It’s not only a symbol of our commitment to each other, but a representation of our relationship.  We have come full circle, starting out together at Hogwarts.”  He chuckled.  “Though not exactly as friends.”
Hermione noticed that since she and Ron had officially gotten together, the potion smelled slightly different to her.  No longer did she smell mint toothpaste, but the honeysuckle from the first bouquet of flowers he brought her.  She smiled sweetly at the memory.
Harry was about to protest.  However, deep down, he knew Ron was right.  “I . . . I’m just trying to be friendly.  Draco says the same thing about Knox.  I thought he was jealous.”
Draco cocked his head to one side slightly and furrowed his brow. “I don’t think I need one. The pain really isn’t bad.”
Their ears were immediately assaulted by her high-pitched wails.  Harry picked her up and rocked her. He patted her bottom.
“Do you honestly think I don’t know what you’re doing, Ron?” Hermione plopped down at the table across from Ginny.  Ron cautiously sat down next to her.
, what if you’re paired with someone you have a secret crush on?  It’s all about getting to know each other better.  All four Houses, Seventh and Eighth Years will be invited.”
“I ate eel for the first time,” he told them.  “And they have this crumbly almond cake sort of thing, freg-a-la-tto,” he sounded out slowly.
“You have plans with Ron?” A sleepy voice came from the other side of the room.  “Did you and Harry break up too?”
“Minerva, this is unexpected,” Harry said uneasily.  He smiled, despite thinking her visit was not going to be a pleasant one.
Like Ron and Hermione, the rest of the Weasleys accepted Harry’s announcement of his homosexuality in stride. Though they enjoyed teasing him from time to time, George in particular, it was never meant to be hurtful.
“No, you’re right.  We are who we are because of the past. Still, I would change a few things if I could.”
At that moment Harry was glad Draco couldn’t see his face.  Hearing Draco call him luv took him by surprise.  Not to mention the odd feeling he got in his chest.  He squeezed Draco tightly, knowing the evening was coming to a close.
A light blush overtook Draco’s face. “Pansy signed me up for  . . .  a dating service,” he replied, rolling his eyes.
“I can’t use that as an excuse for everything I’ve done.  I acted like a prick before I even knew there was a war.” Draco turned, not realizing that Harry had made his way over.
In his mind Harry couldn’t help thinking that cleaning up and moving the Potions supplies down to the dungeons was well worth a night out alone with Draco. He mentally smacked himself for that thought. “Well, are you busy tonight?” Harry asked.
Draco nudged Harry’s legs apart with his knee. He reached down, teasing the bollocks before continuing on to Harry’s arse.  One well-lubricated finger slid easily inside.  Draco could tell that Harry was quite experienced.  A second, then third finger glided in, making Harry groan.
“Ron, wait.” Harry tugged on Ron’s sleeve and pulled him a few feet away. “As long as you’re here, I’ve got something to tell you.”
Harry told himself it was only his imagination.  Too much booze, not enough sleep.  Those things, coupled with the spell, could have easily made Harry misinterpret what happened.  Or almost happened.  No, it definitely was not going to happen.  At least, that’s what Harry told himself.
“The Healer I spoke to said we may be able to narrow down which one of us is the father before the baby is born.  There’s nothing to do until I know for sure.  The trick will be getting Ginny to agree.”
“No, not at all.  It’s just that you’ve always wanted to keep your private life as private as possible.  I’m simply surprised.”
“I’m not leaving.  I’m moving up to Flitwick’s old quarters. And you’re moving in with me,” Harry smiled.  “If you choose to, that is.  I suppose I should ask.”
Harry watched the blond, looking small and unguarded. He stepped closer and leaned over the bed. Before he could even think about what he was doing, he gently placed a hand on either side of Draco’s head and turned his face to his own, bringing their mouths together. Draco willingly leaned into the kiss, trying his best to keep from twisting his right ankle. Their lips gently caressed one another, as though they had been doing it for years. It wasn’t so much sexual, as it was filled with tender emotion.
“For this, I will.  Besides, I no longer feel the need to stick it to my father by rejecting my inheritance.”
He took a small vial out of his trouser pocket and uncorked it, downing the purple liquid in one gulp.  Slowly, his teeth returned normal.  He removed his robes and stood before Harry.  Dressed all in black, with his hair gelled back, Draco looked startlingly similar to a much younger version of himself.
“A legacy that will be impossible to live up to,” Harry said. “That’s a burden I wouldn’t want to put on anyone.”
“You receive a failure for the potion. And if your essay is late, points will be taken off for each day it is overdue.  Every essay will be handed in, regardless of how late.  More than a week and you will receive no points.  Don’t hand it in, and you will fail the class.”
“Slughorn was a bit paranoid.  Had it charmed to open only with this.  It’s been left unlocked since he left though,” Harry explained.  “Here, you may as well keep it if you decide to re-charm the lock.”
Draco regarded Harry, and the seriousness of his question.  “As difficult as it would be to do so, yes.  Will you?”
“I don’t know,” Draco rubbed the back of his neck.  “Plus, there’s Harper, Blaise’s boyfriend.  He doesn’t seem to go anywhere without him.”
Bill appeared to give it some thought, then glanced at Harry. “If you’re certain it’s not an imposition.”
“The Mark,” the former Death Eater breathed.  “It’s gone.” He frowned.  “It really hurt.  It was more painful than getting it.”
“And, when you were so obsessed with what Malfoy was doing sixth year,” Ron chuckled.  “You were always staring at him. I thought maybe you had a thing for him.   Can you imagine?” He burst out laughing and smacked Harry on the back.
Draco, certain Harry was going to hit him, stopped, tensed his shoulders, squeezed his eyes shut and braced for impact.  Harry’s embrace nearly knocked him over.
The man shrugged. “All right.  I’ve had to go in for questioning a few times, but I think that’s over now.”  He paused. “I had no idea.  I’m not a Death Eater.  I thought my parents were here fighting on the right side.”  He looked at Draco.  His reaction would have been laughable if the situation weren’t so sad.  Clearly, he hadn’t noticed Draco’s new look before as he had been focused on Harry.
Sitting down beside her, he took her hand.  “I do. You can’t possibly be upset because I turned you down.  You could get any number of boys to help you out there.”  He tried to make light of the situation, but he could see there was more to it.
Hesitating slightly and making a conscious effort not to look at Draco, Harry said.  “As a matter of fact, yes.”
“What about poor Harry?” Lavender said.  The three girls looked down the table to see Ron, Hermione and Ginny, without Harry.  “He got stuck with Malfoy, twice.”
“Well, it’s about our wedding,” she began.  “We’ve decided not to have a Christmas wedding after all.”
“It’s not all of a sudden.  I told you before that I might want to do something with them down the road,” Harry said. “But to be honest, it was watching you read to Dominique. I wondered what it would be like to listen to you read about Liam’s adventures.”
“I’ve named every girl in the bloody class, Harry.  And you haven’t even given a tiny twitch at the mention of any of them,” Ron complained.  He figured Harry would have some reaction to the name of the girl with whom he had met up with the previous night.  But he had gone through the roster of girls names and nothing.  “You’re too good at game face for me,” Ron pouted.
“I don’t understand.  I thought that was what got him threatened in the first place.  Why wouldn’t he want get on with it?”
“I think it’s a splendid idea,” Hermione agreed, pretending not to notice the way Ron was trying to shut Harry up.  Though, she couldn’t imagine how Malfoy could have helped him out.
“Fine, Potter,” he grumbled through gritted teeth.  He looked back to glare at Blaise, who did not return the look.  Harry hadn’t realized it was a real argument until that moment.
The pair leaned over the potion and watched.  The liquid began to bubble.  They held their breaths in anticipation.  Before their eyes, the potion thickened and turned light pink in color.
The room was filled with chatter about who the guest or guests could be.  Some guessed Quidditch players, others guessed famous potion makers.  Still others hoped it would members of Weird Sisters.
Draco chuckled.  “You’ve given this some thought.  What would we wear?  Unless you’re planning on wearing a dress, we’ll still appear to be two men.”
“Maybe you’re right,” Draco agreed.  “Who’d have ever thought I’d be taking advice on love from Blaise Zabini,” he laughed.
“No.  But it’s the right thing to do,” Draco told her.  “And, if it is just the game, the only hope I have of winning Harry back is to be honest.”
Harry and Draco strolled through Diagon Alley hand in hand.  They each carried a baby in a papoose strapped to his chest. Lily slept soundly against Harry’s chest, while Scorpius gazed up at Draco, occasionally glancing at a passerby.
“Still concentrating on me, aren’t you?” Draco turned his head to look at Harry.  He wiggled his hips, so his bollocks swung like a pendulum.
Harry never thought of his fans as stalkers, but now that he thought of it, some witches and wizards did show up where he was quite often. But Harry also knew that the reason he frequented some of the places he did was because he had seen Draco in them. He stuck to the same cafes and pubs hoping to run into the blond.
Knox said, “Thank you.  I think you’re right. No matter what the outcome of their trial, I’ve decided to make a fresh start.  That’s why I will be leaving Hogwarts at the end of the term.”
Draco looked up and grinned.  “That was . . . exciting.  Wondering if any minute someone would knock and catch us.”  A small shiver went through his spine.
“Nobody could help me,” Draco told him.  “Nobody except Snape.  He didn’t want to kill Dumbledore any more than I did. He was braver than me.  And he saved my life.  I deserved what you did to me.”
Knocking on the Headmistress’ door, Harry began to get nervous.  He wasn’t sure why he was there.  He only knew their last conversation didn’t sit right with him.
“My advice? Apologize straightaway.  Even if you don’t think you’re wrong.  And give her chocolates or flowers or something.”
“Well, I’ll try it.  Draco and I didn’t make it to dessert.”  Harry stood up and walked to the side table and picked up a fork.
“Oh, damn,” Harry said suddenly.  “I forgot the wine.  I bought wine for our dinner.  I’ll just go and fetch it quickly.”
Harry didn’t need to say it, as the contract bound Wyndam to print only what Harry said, word for word.  The article would be complete and accurate.
He opened his eyes to see that Draco was no longer in the room.  Not that it was unexpected.  The other man must have left before the sun rose in order to sneak back to his own quarters unnoticed.  Harry never realized how cold and lonely his bed could feel.  Now that he had a taste of real companionship in bed, as opposed to the temporary pleasure of a quick shag, Harry wanted to live that way always.  His need for Draco’s company was moving beyond a physical attraction.  Just the thought of seeing him at breakfast gave him a pleasant warmth and feeling in his chest he couldn’t quite describe.
He realized that it could compromise their positions at Hogwarts, if the Board thought it would lessen the school’s reputation.  He had to find a way to fix the situation.
“She’s already seen,” Harry shrugged.  “And you won’t tell anybody, right Madame Pomfrey?” He looked up at her hopefully.
He gently massaged it for several minutes, while Harry watched wordlessly.  No one had ever done that before, and Harry strangely found the simple gesture to be more erotic than a wank.  He didn’t realize how heavy his breathing had become until Draco whispered his name.
“This wasn’t my intention,” Harry said. “This can’t be how our child’s life begins.  Can you please forgive me?  I just wanted so badly for you to be the father.”
It was rather late by the time Harry arrived back at Hogwarts, so instead of visiting Draco in his quarters, he went to his own and got ready for bed.
The moment Harry stepped over the threshold, the door slammed shut behind him, startling him.  He was thrust up against the wall and accosted by a pair of sharp teeth scraping against his neck.
“We’ve changed, both of us, for the better.  Like it or not, Mother, Harry and I are going to be together forever.”
At first they laughed, but the thought of the old Potions professor seeing them nude made them grimace.
“No, it’s all right Harry.  No subject is off limits, remember.”  Pansy took a sip of her drink before answering.  “I suppose if you want to psychoanalyze it, you would believe I’m punishing myself for throwing away love when I had it, and now I’m having lots of sex to try and make up for it.” She took another sip.  “Or maybe I simply love shagging. It feels good, with the right lover.  And I want to do it while men still find me attractive.  I don’t see why it’s okay for Theo to bed a different girl every week, but if I do it, I’m a tart.”
Feeling more than a bit ashamed, Harry wanted to leave, but he was afraid Luna and Neville would hear their footsteps.  And admittedly, he was getting turned on.
Harry smiled and reached his hand across the table to place over Draco’s.  “I know.  But it’s still true.”
He stood a moment, and was about to knock, when a small house elf came out with a tray of half-eaten food.
She waved her wand over the parchment.  “Imitari.”  Duchess handed Harry the conjured duplicate copy.
Harry raked his fingers through her hairy patch, between her folds, moistening his fingers and spreading her juices.  Pansy groaned in anticipation. His thumb slid around, searching for the sweet spot that would bring her the most pleasure.
Narcissa reached out to him. “Please don’t take offense. This may not have been the wedding I’ve always imagined for my son, but I couldn’t be any more delighted with the way it’s turned out. Especially, his choice of spouse.”
Bit by bit, Harry rolled in his spot until he came face to face with Draco.  The small amount of friction was enough to bring his cock to life.  He planted a kiss on Draco’s neck.  When that didn’t wake the blond, he sucked on the skin, nipping just slightly.
“All the more reason for me to begin right away.  We need to get you to St. Mungo’s as soon as possible.”
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco grunted and sped up his movements on Harry’s cock, trying to get him to cum before himself.
The rest of the day, Harry insisted that nothing was wrong.  No matter how much his friends asked, he told them he was fine.  Ron was perfectly happy to accept it and went about his day as usual. Hermione, of course, wasn’t buying it for a minute.
“It’s definitely coming from there,” Michael said.  He began to ascend the steps with Parvati following closely behind, as she had no choice because of the game rules.
“Walking around, eh?” Ron repeated suspiciously.  “Did you happen to run into someone, by any chance?”
“Don’t apologize.  I love watching you cum.  It turns me on.  Even more than I was already.”  Harry lifted onto his elbows and motioned for Draco to come closer so he could kiss him.  “Are you all right . . .  to continue?”  Harry asked tentatively.  Draco’s arse around his cock felt better than any snatch ever did, and he wanted nothing more than to thrust into it over and over.
“What I think is that you’ve gone through a lot of changes in the past month and I’m lucky to be here with you at all.” Draco chuckled softly. “I’ll admit I’d like things to move a bit faster, but it’s all right. I confess that I haven’t shagged a man either, so when you’re ready, it’ll be a first for both of us.”
Terry Boot and Stephen Cornfoot stepped out from behind a large pillar.  They too, had their wands drawn.  Boot was still laughing.
“Sounds like a bit of prejudice and jealousy,” Harry said.  “People making assumptions about her without really knowing her.”
One more spoonful of pudding and Blaise was done.  The pair left the Great Hall for Slytherin to talk in private.
Draco suddenly broke the kissing and breathlessly asked, “Aren’t Granger and Weasley supposed to come over?”
Anthony put a gentle hand on her lower back and led her through the swarm of dancers.  The pair left the party and walked through the castle until they came upon a secluded spot.
A simple Scourgify, and they zipped up trying to make themselves look presentable.  Harry lay back on the settee and patted his chest for Draco to lean on.
“I thought we were just going to the Leaky,” Draco said when he saw Harry dressed in a soft button down shirt and nice trousers.  Draco wore jeans and trainers as opposed to his usual attire, which was much the way Harry was currently dressed.
“Mm. As lovely as that is,” Draco began with a moan. “Perhaps you could massage that with your arse instead.  Over to the bed.”
“He denies it, of course.  Says it’s all in my head.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest and narrowed his eyes at Zabini’s expression.  “What?”
Harry noted how his lover used Ron’s name with ease, then chuckled.  “I guess I was outed on both accounts, then.”
Harry nodded as well. “Good. Now get some rest. Get your strength back. You’ll need it,” he grinned. “I plan on shagging you senseless for days on end. And I don’t want to be interrupted by a trip back to St. Mungo’s.”
She nodded, easily reeled in. “Yes. The Healer on duty thought he was dead when he first came in. It was a miracle that he survived. And you saved him, huh?”
“Let me help you,” Hermione begged.  “Who are you going to meet at Hogwarts?  You need to be introduced to new people.”
Draco blushed.  He had momentarily forgotten Ron and Hermione were in the room when he teased Harry with his noodle eating skills.  He thought perhaps he had taken it a little too far.
“No,” Draco laughed.  “She practically pounced on me. I suppose I could have been kinder to her.  But I pushed her away, hard, and wiped my mouth rather dramatically, even though she’d barely managed to touch my lips.”
“And it wouldn’t hurt for you to try and be nicer to Draco.  I’ll try to get him to be nicer to you too.  You’re family.  You should get along better.”
“The students found it very informative,” Harry told Minerva.  “There were students who seemed to find the dark magic attractive.  After Draco’s presentation, they changed their minds.”
Draco’s brow drew together.  “The Ministry would do that?  My mother was involved with Death Eaters herself.”
“It may have turned out that way, but they planned it so that Harry and Draco could be partners.  And I lost Hermione over it.”
The following week brought a bit of peace for Harry.  The inspired favor he had asked Draco on Sunday had proved useful, as the more Harry thought about it, the more he thought it was actually a good idea.  The two planned a day for Draco to come to Harry’s DADA class and talk about the dark times when the Death Eaters took over his family’s manor.  They both seemed to forget about the uncomfortable encounter at Draco’s door, and things had gone back to the way the were before Harry’s date with Althea.  Harry decided to settle for Draco’s company in any form it came.  If they were to remain friends, Harry would just have to learn to get over his crush.
“What possible reasons could you have for throwing in with . . . you know who.”  Draco still had trouble saying the name occasionally.
“I was angry with you earlier.  And hurt that you didn’t trust in what we have.  But . . .” He lowered his voice and looked around.  “I still love you.  I think I was confusing the anger I was feeling with my feelings for you.  We’ve never really fought before.” Harry smiled.  “Scratch that.  I meant to say, we’ve haven’t fought since we got together.”
Pansy grinned at him.  “It seems your parents began hosting a series of parties, by invitation only, of course.  They called them wand parties.”
“I’m only kidding.  But you don’t know how frustrating it was for me to watch the pair of you slowly fall in love and do nothing about it.  And now you’re finally married.”  Harry smiled.
“It won’t record anything but the absolute truth. For instance, if you wrote something, say, that you arrived here tonight at midnight.  But you were really here just before ten.  The journal corrects what you’ve written.”
Harry swiftly vacated his seat to allow him to sit next to his son.  Wordlessly, Draco leaned against his shoulder. It was the first time, in a long time, that the pair shared more than a cursory handshake.
“Sorry.”  Harry loosened his hold but didn’t let go. “Do you . . . did you . . . really change your mind?”
“Well, they’re not her grandparents, are they?”  Harry snickered.  “And Lily isn’t anywhere near teething.  Go back to bed, love. I’m all right with them.  I was getting ready to warm a couple of bottles and then put them down.  I’ll come to bed as soon as I get them settled.”
He adored the way Draco lovingly caressed his skin.  The way he kissed Harry tenderly. The way they connected emotionally through the bond. The way Draco made him feel revered and cherished.
With a small smile on his lips, Harry silently pulled his foot out of his shoe.  He took a quick peek around. There were a few students in the library, but most of them were deeply focused on their own potion essays.  Harry’s foot slid leisurely across the floor, searching for its target.  It gently bumped against Draco’s shoe.
“No,” she finally answered. “I find my time with Rose to be precious.  Of course, I like to hear what’s going on over at the Ministry from time to time.  But would I rather be there? Absolutely not.”
“But I already have changed it,” Draco protested.  “I’ve come back to Hogwarts.  I’ve rejected the ways of the Death Eaters.  I’ve even tried to have the Mark removed.”
“Now, Harry, it’s a good question.” Draco patted Harry’s arm to quiet him.  “Why Harry?” he repeated. He looked at his partner for a moment.  “I don’t know.  He has many wonderful qualities I wasn’t able to acknowledge before.  And faults that I was sure were there, I struggle to find now.  I didn’t choose him.  Fate chose for me.  And . . . fate chose well.”
“The mum is ginger.  She’d been coloring her hair blonde though,” Harry explained.  “We thought it was a strong possibility that one or both of them would be a head red.  He’ll fit right in at family gatherings.”
“Twice.”  Neville seemed to be in a daydream.  “I’ve never shagged anyone before.”  He looked at Ron, then Harry.  “I guess I didn’t need to advertise that.”
“Yes, you know, we’ve been here in the same House for seven and a half years.  And I don’t know much about you.”
“You seem nervous,” Hermione observed. She took Harry by the arm and led him to a corner of the common room.
Harry’s eyes sprang open just before dawn.  He couldn’t sleep any longer.  Small snores came from the messy blond head next to him.  He considered waking Draco up, but then decided Christmas day was the one day you shouldn’t wake someone.  Harry never enjoyed Christmas as a child, with the Dursleys.  He enjoyed it more with Ron’s family.  However, he was never really excited like he was this day.  Giving gifts to Ron and Hermione gave him pleasure, but he was nearly bursting with the anticipation of presenting Draco with his gifts.
They sat down and set up their pieces.  Draco poured a shot of firewhiskey each and pushed Harry’s across the table toward him.
All in all, the Draught of Peace was a success.  Draco was pleased, with his Fifth Years, at least.  The Seventh Years were slacking, but he still had time to whip them into shape before the N.E.W.T.s.
They ended the call with Harry feeling excited about seeing his friends.  It would take his mind off Draco and his date the following evening.
“You deserve it Harry, really.  Both of you.”  Her smile dropped.  “I saw the paper.  How are you coping?”
He lifted his head slightly.  “I said I don’t want to get up.”  He lay still for only a moment longer. “Fuck.”  He sat up and looked at Hermione, bleary eyed.
“Rumors say he’s been with Pansy for years.  And a few other girls.  Besides, I think Blaise is seeing that Seventh Year in their dormitory,” Hermione pointed out.
For a moment, they simply stared at one another, realizing the implications of Harry’s actions.  They no longer had to hide.  No longer had to pretend they didn’t have feelings for each other.
“I’ll need to go to the business offices at the Ministry,” she said to no one in particular. “They’ll have a listing of agencies that deal in adoption and surrogacy.  Then I’ll try St. Mungo’s. They may also be able to help.  If we have to, we could always explore the muggle world.”
“You’re probably right.  But now that there’s a possibility that we’ll end up like those other couples, it’s looking like a pretty good option.”
On his way back up to his own chambers, Draco thought about what happened in Harry’s room.  He hoped Harry really was as out of it as he seemed.  The last thing he wanted was for his colleague to know he was harboring a secret crush on him.
Nodding against Draco’s shoulder, Harry agreed. The two lay quietly, each contemplating Draco’s plan.
Harry saw the hex coming a split second too late and wasn’t able to deflect it completely.  He was thrown back against the wall and collapsed in a pile on the floor.  As he struggled to get up, he witnessed Greyback and Malfoy cast curses and hexes at one another in rapid succession.  Each was able to fend off the other’s spells.  However, the walls had been pummeled and were steadily crumbling.  Harry had gotten in a few shots from his difficult angle.  Most of them were deflected, but Greyback had been injured by falling debris.
“Uh, he-he, I don’t know.  I didn’t think I’d get this far.” He blushed.  “Hogsmeade?  Are you doing anything this afternoon?”
Draco whirled around.  “Fine.  I was going to hit him.  But he deserved it.”  He turned back and stomped up the stairs without waiting to hear what Harry had to say.
Normally, when he’d been with Ginny, he would have kissed her and whispered sweet nothings in her ear.  But kissing seemed too intimate a thing to do with Pansy.  Their kiss earlier wasn’t necessarily something he needed to repeat.  Ironically, burying his cock to the hilt inside of her didn’t feel as personal to him.  He rested his forehead on her chest and closed his eyes while continuing to pump and stimulate her simultaneously.  He just wanted to feel, without thinking for a change.
George put in a floo call to the Ministry to come for the would-be assassin.  After two Aurors came to collect him, and the excitement had died down, Draco insisted that Harry come back to Hogwarts with him.
“Oh, heh heh,” Ron laughed, embarrassed.  “I smell cherry lipgloss, and some kind of flowery shampoo and stuff.”
Looking around, he spotted Draco with a small group of Slytherin Second years.  Draco glanced up to find Harry watching him.  He gave a small wave, to which Harry smiled.  It suddenly occurred to him that he shouldn’t be sharing flirtatious smiles and waves with the Potions professor while in the company of students and staff.  It was difficult, though to keep from stealing glimpses of his new lover.
“I can’t believe you two are even considering it,” Ginny said shaking her head.  “Why would you subject yourself to that?”
Draco bit his lip.  He really didn’t have any idea what to say to Harper.  He and his friends didn’t typically comfort one another through break ups.  Then again, he and his friends were usually the initiators of the break ups.  Draco remembered Blaise telling him that he and Harper would only last until the end of school.
“You’re going to have to drag me.  I’m afraid I won’t be much help,” Draco told Harry. He clutched his stomach and groaned.
Parvati closed her eyes as Harper made the first cut, almost at her shoulders. “My mother is going to kill me,” she muttered.
“Well, not everyone,” Theo said, crumbs flying out of his mouth.  He covered it, but not quickly enough. “Sorry. I mean, Finch-Fletchley didn’t get anywhere with anybody.  Weren’t you with him last time?”  Pansy nodded.  “And Potter and Malfoy. No fucking way,” he laughed.
Harry was jolted out of calm preoccupation and swiftly withdrew his hand.  Draco banged his hand hard on the underside of the table, trying to bring it up in a hurry.
Draco smiled.  “One of my favorites. Rudolf Nureyev.  He was a gay ballet dancer, one of the best in the world.”
They stripped, and Draco uncharacteristically left his clothing in a pile on the bathroom floor, along with Harry’s.
“I’m hurting you.” Harry immediately let go.  He led Draco to the chair.  “Sit down.  Why did the Healers release you from the hospital?  You’re still in pain.”
She turned and urged him to stand while the students and staff applauded.  Harry joined in, half-heartedly.  It all seemed very suspect to him that Filius decided to retire early, and Knox happened to be ready to fill his spot.  And it was all the more suspect by Flitwick’s remark about going to America, of all places.
Harry was happy that Draco agreed that finding their own place to live was a good idea, but he felt slightly guilty that the Malfoy heir would be giving up the home in which he had grown up.  Giving up Sirius’ sinister former home would not come as a hardship to Harry.  He had only held onto it for sentimental reasons.
“I helped with these,” he whispered.  He picked up a forkful and put it in his mouth, a slight frown of concentration on his face.  He glanced up to see that others were watching him chew very slowly. After finally swallowing his bite, he announced, “I think they do taste better when you have to work for it.”
“I was about to order lunch for later,” Narcissa said.  “Will you and Harry be staying?” she asked Draco.
Harry frowned.  He was certain that Draco was in the dungeons.  His first thought was that the connection was waning.
“No.  You can’t wish away the bad without wishing away the good,” Harry said. “Everything that happened to us, lead us here, to right now.”
“Mr. Malfoy!” McGonagall screamed.  “You will desist this instant.  Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Entwistle, please take Mr. Boot to the hospital wing.  As for you, Mr. Malfoy–”
“Harry, wait.  We’ll stop with the questions,” Hermione tried to convince him, but he walked out of the Great Hall without looking anyone in the eye and ran up to his room completely mortified.  Why did Pansy have to do that?  Why did he have to react so obviously to a simple wave?  He buried his head in his pillow.  Eventually, lack of sleep from the night before induced him into a deep slumber, during which he dreamt of walking into the Great Hall for supper, nude.
Later on, when they arrived back at Hogwarts, Draco asked why he wanted to keep his story writing a secret.
With the Dark Lord gone, loyal Death Eaters stepped forward and linked together through their Dark Marks.  Though Draco hadn’t willingly joined their collective, his Mark was still drawn to the others.  Another reason Draco wanted to become part of the Ministry was to have access to superior Healers, in the hope that one of them would be able to remove his Dark Mark.
Draco was beginning to think he wasn’t going to be able to get the information out of Harry he was looking for.
He stopped and watched as Harry and Knox walked in his direction, covered in dirt and dripping with sweat. And, oh, was Harry a sight. If Draco hadn’t been so angry about missing his practice time with Harry, he would have been moved to take him right there on the field.
Narcissa had been sipping her tea, and watching the albino peacocks meander on the lawn.  She smiled and gestured for Harry to sit.
“Come on,” he begged.  “I’m not asking for much.  Have a few more drinks and pretend I’m someone else.”
To add to his anxiety, Knox, or Ob-Knox-ious, as he’d taken to calling him behind his back, was still up to his passive aggressive games.  Harry appeared to be effectively ignoring them.  But the man grated on Draco’s nerves.
When Harry relaxed and opened his eyes, he found Draco gazing adoringly at him.  The blond smiled.  “How could we ever have had any doubts that we belong together?”
After the meal, they rushed back to the common room to search for a book with hand-written details entitled Wand Game, on the last few pages.  Little did they know it would take them two and a half weeks to find it.  And another three to perfect the charms on the cauldron they would use to hold the wands.
Harry shook his head.  “No, not that.  I meant running away and not telling anyone where you were going. I wasn’t angry about what happened in Potions.  Well, I was a little upset about you leaving me to deal with the aftermath alone.”  He leaned forward.
“Well, that was exciting!” Miranda exclaimed.  “Horace, thank you for a wonderful evening.  But I must be going.  It was enchanting to meet you boys.  I’ll be in touch about that spell, young man,” she said to Draco.
Ron chuckled.  “That sounds surprisingly mature. Especially for him.  But Harry, maybe you ought to stay away from the other bloke anyway.”
Opening his eyes, Draco thanked Harry.  “I’d offer you my mother’s, but I’m going to return it to her.  I’m sure you understand.”  He turned to leave.
“Sure thing, lover boy,” Tracey winked.  “Go down the hall a minute.  I don’t want you to hear the password.”
“Good idea.  But we need a way to recognize each other.  I was thinking of going with the strawberry blond hair.  And I’ll carry something maybe.  Like a blue rose.”
In a matter of seconds, the moment was gone.  But Blaise had gotten the message.  Draco cleared his throat.
“Have you done something?  Something you think I won’t like?” Harry questioned, the worst scenarios running through his head.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked frantically. At that point, he was powerless to stop himself from releasing.
Lucius’ lips curled and his nostrils flared.  “How am I suppose to support this lifestyle you have?  I find it disgusting.  Screwing other men.  Acting as another man’s bitch.”  He snorted.  “You’re so feminine, you may as well be a woman.”
“It’s the same person I’ve been talking about for the last week,” Harry offered. “But I’m not saying who it is yet.”
“I feel like I’m always in charge. Sometimes, I like to give up control.”  He put his lips close to Draco’s ear and whispered.  “Sometimes, I even like to submit.  I know a few tricks with magical ropes.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth rose slightly.  “No fair.”  He sighed.  “All right.  But we’re leaving as soon as it’s over.”
Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder and gazed out the window again.  His future seemed set and yet wide open at the same time.  He worried how the decisions he made now would affect that future.  How would he know which choices would lead him to the children and which would lead him further away?
“I love him very much, and I will do whatever it takes to make him happy.  That’s the only reason I’m willing to help you.  I love him enough to put aside my differences with you.”
Tracey watched as Anthony drifted into a peaceful sleep.  She herself wouldn’t fall asleep for hours, the events of the evening playing in her head over and over.
“Oh,” Harry breathed out.  He didn’t really believe Draco would have been calmly telling McGonagall about their affair.  But he was relieved to hear it.  “Well, I thought hearing about the Dark Arts from someone who--” He looked down at Draco.
. Harry snickered. He wasn’t going to fool the journal on that one.  Even he was beginning to believe they were his children. Perhaps even hoping.
“The Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes sounds fun.  Or if I really don’t want to work hard, maybe the Department of Magical Games and Sports,” Draco snickered, holding his hand out for the firewhiskey. He lowered himself to the ground and crossed his legs.
“That won’t be a problem,” Harry told him.  “I’ve got plenty.  Not as much as you, but I’m comfortable.”
“I never said that I wasn’t going to.  I just said maybe you were right about being careful.  But I was,” Harry insisted.
“No, you don’t understand,” Theo said.  “I really mean just spend time.  I’ve seen you in a new light this year and well, I think I’ve taken my studies a little more seriously after seeing how well you’ve done.  And, I remember you saying one time that it would be nice just to talk.  I swear, I won’t try to bonk you.”
“To say the least,” she agreed.  “I think I liked it better when we were all sneaking around,” she chuckled.
By nine o’clock, the party had begun and almost everyone in the school was in the Great Hall.  Harry swiftly put on his costume, along with the boots he altered to make him taller.  He placed the mask over his eyes and pulled the red bandana up over his nose.  Looking at his reflection in the mirror, Harry could barely see any of his face.  Perfect.  He waved his wand and whispered the incantation to change his hair.  He watched it slowly morph into a light strawberry blond color, which he attempted to comb down.
Glenda smirked.  “All right.” She waved her wand at the quill.  “So tell me, Mr. Potter, how are your studies coming along this year?”
Sighing heavily, Draco gave in.  “All right.”  He plucked a small box wrapped in elegant gold paper with a red ribbon from Harry’s pile and handed it to him.
“Oh, well,” Harry swallowed his pride a little. “I wasn’t sure at first.  But . . . if you were willing to put our past behind us, then I guess I should give it a go.”
Harry slowly made his way back to Gryffindor.  Only he, a Sixth Year and two Fourth Years were staying.  But he didn’t mind.  Draco had been a huge distraction and he had a lot of work to make up over the break. He was glad for the quiet time.  His plan was to get it all finished by Christmas Eve, so he could enjoy Christmas through New Year’s Eve.  Hopefully, he would be able to convince Draco to come back with him after supper at the Weasleys.
Harry turned and gasped.  He hadn’t realized that Draco wasn’t bluffing.  He stood, eyes wide as McGonagall literally grabbed a hold of Boot’s ear and dragged him to her chambers.
Harry shook the offered hand.  “Nice to meet you.  But really, I’m fine.  I only came because my friend insisted.”
not the mother of your children.  They still must have a mother though.” Draco paused. “Are you disappointed?  Even a little bit?”
“She told me that none of the boys talk to her.  They think she must be a snob or something.  Some of the girls don’t like her, because the boys all do.  But she’s really nice.”
“T’weren’t lies if you’re really fuckin’ him,” Boot smirked, unaware that Draco had been listening in.  “He’s a bigger ponce than you.  Tell me Potter, does he scream like a girl when you’re pounding into his arse?” Boot laughed.
“No, of course not,” Harry answered.  “It will be a surprise when we get to the hospital,” he smiled gently at her.
“The hospital is a difficult place for children,” Harry said to Draco.  “Remember, Hermione couldn’t bring Rose yesterday.”
They stood still a moment, then shrugged it off.  It wasn’t a big deal for them, they were only asking questions.  However, Harry had a few that were of a more personal nature this go round.
“Can’t you just accept the book and pretend this conversation never occurred?” he laughed nervously.
“No, I’m not ashamed.  I try to keep my private life private.  You of all people know that.  I simply saw no reason to announce it.  Did you have to announce that you are heterosexual to the world?”
“Fucking hell, you aren’t gay after all.  I can’t believe I totally misread you.  I thought you  . . . wanted . . . but you said he.”
Draco cleared his throat.  “As I said, I don’t know how to prove to you that I am sincere with regard to my feelings for Harry.  But I’ll answer any questions you have.  I invite you to spend time with us.  Anything that will put your mind at ease.”
Harry picked up one of Draco’s bags while he picked up the other, and they began to walk to the castle entrance.
“Excellent idea,” Draco agreed, though many of the students grumbled.  “Well, go on then.  Find a few tables and sit down together.”
“Your blood pressure is a bit higher than normal,” the Healer informed him. “And you’re dehydrated.”
“And, if it hadn’t been unexpected, would you still have chosen to start a family so soon after marrying?”
“Well, I’m not sure you boys have a choice,” Slughorn told them.  “Not unless someone else is willing to change pairs.”
While she was busy trying to convince Ron to leave, Draco was trying his best to show the proper amount of concern for Harry without appearing too familiar.
Narcissa looked around the room.  She was a little disappointed to see that the guests had formed smaller cliques throughout, rather than branching out and mingling.  She supposed she couldn’t expect people such as the Parkinsons to interact with Hermione’s muggle relatives. She sighed and weaved through the guests looking for her son.
Growing restless, Harry got up from the sofa and grabbed a water bottle from the fridge. On impulse, he picked up a yogurt and a jar of peanut butter. Hermione’s voice kept sounding in his head, telling him to eat. He had to admit, he was famished.
“I don’t know.  I’ve seen him here and there over the past few years.  Mostly in Diagon Alley, I suppose.  Why?”
As they talked, they stripped down to pants and made their way to Harry’s bedroom.  Harry asked questions about favorite foods and places to go.  He wanted to hear more stories about Draco’s childhood away from Hogwarts.
“Steady there.  You’re in no shape to apparate,” Draco said as he grabbed a hold of Harry’s arm, keeping him from falling over.  It was well past midnight and he and Harry had been drinking beer and snacking all evening at the Leaky while reminiscing about their youth at Hogwarts.
Draco raised his eyebrows at her question, surprised by the personal nature of it.  The corner of his mouth rose slightly at the memory.
“But I don’t want them to get away with what they’ve done,” Knox said.  “I was sort of hoping you’d tell me he was a dolt.”
Siting back down, Harry noticed Hermione and Ron staring at him expectedly. He picked up a bun and bit off a chunk.
“Mine too.  See you out there then.  I’ve got to set up for a lab,” Draco smiled and got up from the table to go to the Potions Room for his next class.
“That’s wonderful,” Harry said.  He tried to sound enthusiastic, but deep down he was a little sad. And jealous.
a father.  But I mean, the traditions and all.  Mum has even begun shopping around for a bride for me.  She’s trying to make the best deal, for me supposedly.”
“Oh, okay,” Harry blushed.  “You must think I’m some sort of a prudish coward,” he laughed nervously.
Cornfoot’s expression became serious. “Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Malfoy.  We just sent out a note telling what was going on around here. You know, to get your father to give you an ultimatum or something.”
“That’s the thing.  We’re not completely sure. I would love to have a child that looks like Draco. But he pointed out that Rose isn’t related to either one of us and we couldn’t love her more if she were our own.”
“I don’t show it enough,” he said.  “But that’s exactly the way I love you.  I’ve been in love with you forever, and I’d be lost without you.”  He turned to Draco.  “Sorry to put you on the spot like that,” he said, somewhat insincerely.  “Must be the Auror in me.  But I needed to know if you really meant it.”
“Really?” Draco blinked back tears.  “I thought . . . you were going to break up with me.  You were gone all weekend.  I thought you were looking for a new place to live.”
“Draco,” Harry whinged. “You know what I mean. You’re so sophisticated and I’m just going to be a tourist.”
“I haven’t told anyone else.  Not even Ron and Hermione.  I wasn’t sure what you’d think.  You seemed to notice something was going on and disapproved.”
“Well, I guess sometimes he needs me to give him a little encouragement and assurance.  But that’s normal isn’t it?  Everyone has doubts, don’t they?”
“I’ll get it later.  First I have to get you someplace more safe.”  Harry looked around and decided the corner under the catwalk was safest.  The catwalk structure appeared to be sound and would provide a little bit of shelter from any falling debris.
He smiled.  “I wouldn’t be able to become an Auror without my N.E.W.T.s.  It was either come back or choose a new career path,” he answered.
“Alohomora. Open. Difindo.”  Harry heard Draco in the other corner muttering spells and waving his wand.
He held the key out.  Draco stepped forward and reached for it, their fingers touching briefly.  Harry noted that Draco’s hands were soft, for a man.
“Harry, come to bed.  It’s our first night living together.  You don’t want to spend it in the hallway, do you?”
Draco was released from the hospital wing Sunday afternoon.  Blaise tried to celebrate with some butter beers, but Draco wisely declined.
Nails raked over his back, adding to the pleasure.  And Harry realized that he needed to put some effort into Pansy’s pleasure.  That last thing he wanted was for her to spread stories about how their supposedly selfless savior was selfish when it came to sex.
Harry met Ms. Chittock’s eyes.  He knew the subject would be broached sooner or later, and now his heart sped up just a bit.
Draco’s demeanor softened. “Yes.  I’m sorry. It’s just annoying that people have stereotypes about homosexuality.  I don’t want anyone to think badly of you because of me.  We shouldn’t have to hide it.”
Looking at the bottle, Draco chuckled.  “Hardly.  I’ve had this same bottle for over a year.  Blaise gave it to me.”  He laughed softly again.  “Actually, I’ve only ever drank it with you.  Care for some?”  He held the bottle out to Harry.
He heard the doorknob turn and odd footsteps enter his office.  Harry lifted his head only enough to see black boots and the end of a cane.
The conversation during the meal was dominated by babies, pregnancy and birth -- a subject which made more than one man at the table uncomfortable. After most of the food had been eaten, Molly began packing up some things for each of her children to take with them.  She handed Harry a small package of eggy bread for him and Draco to take back to Hogwarts.  While the women mostly stayed in the kitchen helping Molly or chatting, the men retired to the sitting room.
The end of the term came and went. Harry could scarcely believe the year was over as he and several other professors saw the students off on the Hogwarts Express.  He smiled to himself, watching Casper Montague walking shyly with Penelope Pipshaw. The girl was clearly as smitten with him as he was with her. It had been a good year for love, Harry thought. He glanced at the ring on his finger, unaware of the goofy grin on his face.
Dean and Draco walked into the hospital room with drinks and a sandwich for Ginny from the canteen.  She held her hands out and wiggled her fingers.
“Mother,” he whispered.  “Please don’t cry.  I didn’t come here to make you feel guilty.  I only wanted to understand . . .”
“We’d like a witch or wizard, but . . . it doesn’t have to be a pureblood,” Draco said, finally joining the conversation. “Or even a half blood.”
Harry literally shook his head, in an attempt to focus. He was able to copy down much of it before his thoughts wandered again.
His hair was slick with sweat, yet somehow still sticking up in places.  He had shrugged off the robe and his shirt was stuck close to his body.  A smudge or two of dirt across Harry’s face gave him a rugged look he didn’t often sport.
