Cold, indifferent. The aloofness that Pansy had found herself so attracted to is now directed at her. “Fine.” That’s just fine.
Harry coughed, his emerald eyes fluttering open. “Ow.”
“I couldn’t possibly eat it while it’s moving,” Draco lamented as the squid peeked into Harry’s glove and gurgled curiously.
Heat emanated from Draco’s body. He’d shed his outer robes, leaving the vest and dress shirt underneath. Harry tried not to stare, but he couldn’t help noticing the details.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, sincerely.
Harry, on the other hand, loved children. In sixth year, he’d allowed himself small fantasies of him and Ginny in a cottage far from London’s busy streets, with a few kids in mixtures of red hair, black hair, brown eyes, green eyes. The dream had died when they’d broken up, of course, and Harry hadn’t yet managed to rekindle it, especially with the impossibility of him and Draco bearing children. But as he watched Teddy match Draco’s platinum blond hair along with the eyes of emerald, Harry couldn’t help but wonder…
“Thought I heard you shouting, Harry,” Ginny said. “Were you about to pull your wand on Esther?”
“Nonexistent,” Joey replied. “You?”
“I did, didn’t I?” Draco smirks as he settles himself onto Harry’s lap. A pale hand reaches up, mussing his dark hair as he leans in for a kiss.

Draco kneeled in the freshly-turned earth at the epicenter of the explosion. Harry began to call to him until he saw that the dementors, dozens of their faces turned towards Draco, had descended. Draco’s wand hand hung uselessly by his side.
” He muttered and climbed down through the hole at its base.
Harry scrambled to his feet, Luna jogging to keep up with him as he skidded to the door that had appeared in the wall. Without wasting another second, Harry turned the knob and threw it open.
the Filipino word for “police” is “
Draco’s wand hand twitches towards his left forearm. “But why now? I’ve… I’ve only just begun.”
“Anyway, that’s not it. I can’t talk to snakes anymore,” Harry continued. “It’s…I…I like boys.” He looked at the ground, face warm.
Harry, in comparison, is out of breath. Draco, naturally, notices this and says with a smirk:
•    •    •
Icy winds and powdery snow kept most Hogwartians inside, but others felt the promise of hot butterbeer and a chance to get away from teachers’ prying eyes was well worth venturing through the weather. Deciding that only a full blizzard could keep them away from Honeydukes and The Three Broomsticks, Hermione, Ron, and Harry decided to press on with the visit.
Awed gasps rustled through the gathering as the final pair began to stroll down the aisle. Harry, dressed in a crisp, Muggle-style tuxedo with a lilac-colored bowtie, led Hermione as she clung to his arm. He caught Draco’s eye, smiling almost imperceptibly, but everyone else’s attention was on the bride. Hermione’s pure white gown rustled along the grass, the lacy, see-through sleeves set against her light brown skin. Her thick, dark hair had been let loose and flowing, adorned with a long, gossamer veil that had already been thrown back, revealing a face enhanced with light makeup and an excited smile. Amethyst dripped from her ears and her wrists, nearly hidden by a lavish bunch of flowers - heather, white and lavender-colored roses, lilac, ferns, and baby’s breath.
Confusion and guilt mingled through Draco’s mind as he carefully extracted his fingers. He barely remembered anything from the night before, only that he had had his usual nightmares. Draco knew he had a tendency to talk in his sleep, and his face burned as he imagined the possible things he could have said to Harry.
, but…”
At the end of their first week back, the eighth years found themselves with plenty of homework to complete; in addition to a Potions essay and a Herbology packet, the first part of their end-of-year paper was due that Monday. Without a Hogsmeade visit, Quidditch practice or match to distract them, Hermione declared that Saturday a study day, and dragged both Harry and Ron to the library.
Harry glanced up at these words, but Draco purposely avoided his gaze under the guise of checking the clock hanging on the wall. Draco knew what Harry was thinking, and he didn’t want to confront it just yet.
Joey only nodded in response. She’d warmed up to Harry and Draco well enough over the past few weeks, but their school friends were another matter. Ron, in particular, seemed to sense this and said:
“They what?” Ginny’s eyes widened. “Harry…is that true?”
Luna beamed. “You did it!” The baby thestral burbled happily, its mother bending down to nudge noses. “Thank you, Draco.”
Luna and Ginny offered him some comfort, as well. Harry discovered that Ginny had punched Pansy square in the face after dinner, earning her a two weeks’ worth of detentions from McGonagall. Tabitha Nott and Cassandra Cheung had reportedly tried to hold their friend back, though Luna remarked that they didn’t seem to be trying very hard. Harry found this news strangely heartening; perhaps he and Draco had more supporters than he’d initially thought.
“Best if you shut it,” Harry advises his mate. Hermione is bristling like an angered porcupine, but she doesn’t flounce away like she normally does when Ron makes observations about attractive girls. Harry eyes them both, quite certain that something happened between them over the summer but he’s unwilling to bring it up.
“Like it hot, scum?” Crabbe shouts, but Draco can tell by the terrified look on his face that he has no control over what he’s done. Flames pursue Weasley and Crabbe alike, licking unnaturally large and fast over the towers of junk.
The snake’s black tongue flicked forward. It was ten meters away. Seven. Five. Draco stumbled backward, putting distance between them, but he could see the beast’s eyes still. Did it have teeth? Would it strangle him? He felt himself growing faint.
“Ah-ah,” The witch tutted and curled both her fists. All three Aurors’ wands flew into her hands. “No time for resistance.”
“Who’ve you got your eyes on, then? Stockley? O’Donnell? De Rosa?” Harry follows Ron’s gaze to the opposing team, warming up, black and white ball passing between their quick feet. He can’t help but notice Ron’s accent, strongly Bristol, not yet tainted with a New York drawl.
Now able to breathe normally without feeling sick, Harry leaned over the cauldron to peer inside. Simmering within a thin, yellowish solution, small pinkish leaves floated, spinning and swimming in the heat.
“Hello.” Draco lowered the pages, which were covered in his neat, cramped cursive, along with a few sketches Harry couldn’t quite make out. “You can come in,” The Slytherin said. “Close the door behind you.”
“We’ll think of something,” She muttered, but right now, her mind was numb, empty. She had no ideas, and based on Harry’s silence, he didn’t, either.
Ron thought, but he didn’t dare badmouth Harry’s new friend. It wasn’t worth the trouble. “I want to introduce you to someone.”
England. The real me doesn’t fit in here. It’s like I’m…
“I liked watching you out there today. You played well. But,” Draco continued before Harry could thank him, “It made me realize something.” Restless, he uncrossed his arms, placing them on the sink instead, fingers gripping the edge. “The people at Hogwarts - and probably Britain - still see you as their idol. The Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived. That
“Wouldn’t
“I won’t tell Hermione you said that,” Draco remarked.
“Finished already?” Slughorn hummed in interest as he leaned over the cauldron, removing a few parchment pages from his robes. He reached for Harry’s nearby quill and began to mark notes, sniffing the potion and dipping a ladle into it. “Mhm…texture seems fine, color…” Shuffling the sheaves, he retrieved a strip of pure-white paper, colored on one side with various shades of pink, and held it over the liquid. “One shade off. Full rotations when you stir, boys, full rotations.” Harry half-expected Draco to shoot him a scolding look, but he only nodded, keeping his eyes forward. “Close enough for an Outstanding, in my book. Be reminded, however, you’ll be working on your own during an exam.”
“Who will all be in bed well before midnight,” He assured her.
Harry yelled, wand in hand, slamming a spell towards the ground, feeling the incantation rather than thinking it. An invisible force pushed him, Draco, and Joey to the forest floor, just as identical red jets shot over their heads. He rolled towards Draco, shielding him, and whipped his head around, feverishly counting the fallen -
“Ah. Then someone else must’ve put away quite a lot.”
The casual tone with which Melocotones spoke made Joey ball her fists. She remained silent along with her partners, though one glance at Harry’s clenched jaw told her he felt the same way.
“Goodness, I wonder what sort of potions those would be used in?” Hermione said breathlessly once the class had left for the safety of the outdoors. Seeing Hermione and Ron walking with Harry, Draco began to sidle off, but Harry tugged at the Slytherin’s sleeve.
“I never thought you’d ever be scared of someone,” Ron remarked, bemused.
Draco’s breathing suddenly seemed much too shallow. He slowed near a fountain of gray stone, deep green water rippling as a spray showered the pool beneath.
Draco turns, footsteps creaking the porch as he moves closer to the house, wandering around, peering in through the dusty windows; Harry follows. “This is where I agreed to be your boyfriend,” Harry remembers.
,” Harry said hastily. “But definitely not anytime soon. Unless I find out something really awful about you, I guess.”
Draco arched an eyebrow at him. "Of course. I notice things."
“I’m not stalking you,” Harry assures him, guiding the Toyota back into motion.
He tastes of sweet liquor, fingers tangling in her hair. Draco pulls Pansy up to meet him, and she straddles him, lost in his mouth and waist. Her hands rest on the waistband of his jeans. She fumbles with the zipper.
The seconds, minutes, or hours - Draco couldn’t tell - ticked by. “Okay…” He murmured to himself. “Where was I?” Right. Lists.
“I’m not afraid of using my enemy’s weapon,” Joey said softly.
“Would he?” Joey’s tone had suddenly shifted dangerously, and Harry glanced back at her. She had finished her tiramisu but was glaring at the plate as if it had insulted her.
“It’s morning,” Hermione corrected.
“Mother.” Draco thought his throat might close up when he saw her, or perhaps he’d cry. But all he felt was a rush of muted relief, that she was safe, and not yet imprisoned.
“She a seventh-year?” Ron asked as they followed her. “I think I’ve seen her with Ginny a few times.”
ed, but his cheeks darkened. He lifted the seal maker, inspecting the carving. “A dragon? How appropriate.”
“Why is that?” Joey asked curiously, leaning forward, and the gold in her hair shimmered in the firelight. “Why is everyone so secretive about magic here?”
So what if this is my imagination. It feels real enough.
“I’m pleased that you’re willing to try,” Draco said simply, clasping his pale hands in his lap. “But if you don’t mind, I wish to be alone right now.”
Alarm bells went off in Harry’s head, but he remained calm. “Yes, Professor.”
Draco’s heart sunk as he opened his eyes again. Their position hadn’t changed. Henderson seemed even more vexed, pacing in front of the portal and twisting his wand in his fingers. “Step out, all of you. I may be able to find the source of our problem.”
“Mother, please. He’ll…” Draco hesitated, wondering if his next words were an exaggeration, but it scared him that he couldn’t be sure. “He’ll kill me.”
“What kind of ice cream do you want?”
“Me, too.” Joey hesitated, then reached out, her hand finding Harry’s. She heard his breath catch in surprise, but his fingers curled around hers. They were cold.
Draco’s eyes are liquid copper in the orange light of the passing streetlamps as they meet Harry’s in the rearview mirror. “Perhaps you
“Do you know what boy she was talking about?” Joey asked.
Pansy dangled the pages tauntingly. “Thought you’d be interested in how badly your precious reputation has been dragged through the mud.” Draco didn’t answer but laced his fingers with Harry’s in defiance. Harry felt a swell of pride and squeezed his hand. Pansy’s nose wrinkled, and she opened her mouth to throw another insult.
“Wait a moment, Harry,” Professor Dahlia said, waiting for the other three to leave before continuing. She scrutinized Harry with deep brown eyes, giving him the x-ray feeling that Dumbledore’s stare often had. “You are…extraordinarily compassionate towards Draco Malfoy.”
Draco avoided looking at Harry; he could feel waves of guilt rolling off him and had no wish to see it in his eyes. “Yes. I’ll let the Healer know what Dark Magic he’s working with. You should be out of here in a couple of days - one, with luck.”
Even through his alcohol-induced haze, Draco realizes. “Harry, I…” His fingers lace through Harry’s, but Harry tugs away immediately.
“He does?” Harry said.
Harry smiled as Draco slumped against him, eyes sliding closed. He smelled of caramel and rain and teenage sweat.
The last ten gems clinked into Gryffindor’s hourglass on a Wednesday afternoon, earned by a nameless student, who saved their classmate from being struck across the face by a Whipping Willberry in Greenhouse Four. It took three more hours for the school to realize that they had reached their goal, and another two for the grand prize to be announced.
close,” Gavin mumbled, and Padma looked at him as if surprised he’d spoken.
dense. Let me make myself clear,” Draco narrowed his eyes, and a look of uncertainty flitted across Hyacinthe’s face, “I require information. Withhold such information from me, and you will have made an enemy of Draco Malfoy. Is that what you want?”
As you can probably to tell, I adore writing holiday scenes. I realize I'm spending a lot of time on the Burrow, but home is a place where characters show their true colors - so the reader can understand their motivations better. And of course, plot things!
“No, it…it can’t end!” Harry shouts in frustration, pulling at his hair.
“Wha – what is that?” he said, albeit too loud because Dumbledore looked at him alarmed.
“Well no one has tried to attack me, everyone’s pretty much ignored me,” Neville nodded, and Harry’s mood soured, “Ron had a blow up with me before breakfast,” Neville’s eyebrows shot up.
It was quiet between the two as Harry processed the information that he had been presented with. Feeling uncomfortable with the idea that Dumbledore could potentially bring harm to the Hogwarts inhabitants for a reason he still didn’t know of he was at a tipping point of what to do next.
“There’s no way that I can be Riddle’s heir, he didn’t sign my birth certificate, and I didn’t sign anything like I had for Sirius so, by all the information I’m looking through there is no way that I’m his heir,” he snapped the last bit, a feeling of exhaustion washing over him, he was so tired.
as a blast blew apart the door and sent shards of wood and stone hurling around them; Harry’s shield shimmered as it stopped the pieces from getting closer.
Draco’s eyes narrowed as his wand trembled in his hand, his anger was getting the better of him.
She nodded.
Nothing more was said to him, but their Prefect filled the silence by explaining the different hallways in the dungeons and Harry was impressed that for the most part there was always a way to find yourself at the house entrance in case a student was lost.
“Veela’s don’t bond with their mate until sex when their magical cores come together, and yes Granger, Veela’s can survive without their mates. Harry was never forced to be with me, I gave him a choice when we felt the spark,” at Draco’s comment Harry watched as if he could see Hermione correcting the various textbooks that explained Veela’s behaviors.
“I see, Misses Weasley, Missus Granger, and Missus Parkinson you are free to leave, Harry if you wouldn’t mind staying, I need to speak with you,” the girls left, and Harry looked away at Hermione’s concerned glance.
Deciding he needed to do more research on meditation he grabbed the books he was flipping through, even the few about inheritances he hadn’t read, and rushed back up to Madam Pince asking about meditation books. She looked as suspicious as she had been earlier but directed him to a different part of the library.
The bathroom was empty, and Harry went to the shower furthest in the back and stepped into the stall. Turning the knob, he was still amazed that it took wizards so long to adapt to plumbing, he couldn’t imagine the time where running water wasn’t a thing in Hogwarts.
“Oh Harry, I can’t believe that there was a resorting! I was up all night with a few other Ravenclaws and it’s so rare that the hat would decide to resort students! The last time that it had happened only a few people had been resorted! The first time it had happened almost half the school had been resorted!” Having been used to Hermione in worry mode he kept up with her rapid speech.
For the remainder of the night Harry saw memory after memory of Tom. He saw when he was sorted into Slytherin, his skill in Transfiguration, and how the boy grew and developed during his years at Hogwarts. Harry noticed that they boy came back bitter and angry after his summer holidays and at one-point Dumbledore had overheard Tom begging Headmaster Dippet if he could stay anywhere else. Harry also saw the bad memories, fights that Dumbledore and other Professor’s had to break up between him and another classmate, the occasional stealing, and one student had even claimed that Tom had put a real snake in his bag.
He would wake up in sweats, clinging to Narcissa by his side, touching and possessing her to ease himself, but it was never enough, never enough.  Everything was getting so confused.
Harry made no movement.
“If only you weren’t such a
There had been many points in his life when he had made a decision not understanding its weight.  This included how he had spoken to Harry at Madam Malkins, or joining the Death Eaters at 16.  These were choices that had changed his entirely life, and he had committed to them with little thought.  He did not want to do the same now, he did not want to act like a foolish child and get carried away.
He was not exactly happy.  Happiness seemed beyond him.  His dreams were still haunted by blood and decay.  The missing fingers of his hand ached.  He worried about his father.  And next to him, human as he might be, alive as he might feel, Harry was not quite himself.  But what they had here was safe, and precious, and
Draco raised himself up onto his knees and while his left hand bled, his right grabbed hold of his soft cock.  It was shrunken from the cold, and puny against his numb hand.  He pumped it slowly, closing his eyes.  He felt no desire.  He felt nothing but shock and weakness.  But if he could give Harry his blood, and give Harry his bones, surely then he could give him this as well.
“Who are you shopping for?” hobbling his way over the man stood arms-length from him and Harry paused at the question.
stripping down to his underwear Harry tossed the outfit to the floor and snagged another pair of jeans that were draped over his chair.
Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry then went into more detail about his dreams, how real they felt, about the discussions that he had with Merope, and he finally told them about the night that Draco appeared in the dream as well and how Merope had told them the story of how she fell pregnant and what had happened after she gave birth. Neville looked aghast while Luna was in tears all while Hermione looked torn.
In typical Harry fashion landing was as painful as ever but Harry commended himself that he managed to get to the correct location. Picking himself up off the ground he wiped the soot from his trousers and looked around. He was towards the back of the train, further down from where he’d normally enter via the Muggle entrance.
Harry didn’t even notice when Draco had walked off and sat next to Blaise, both whom were watching him with identical amused looks on their face.
“Boys this is Marlin,” said man gave them a tilt of his head in acknowledgement but didn’t say anything; he was an older gentleman, his hair was mostly graying and the wrinkles at his eyes were noticeable when he smiled. He was wearing a tailored suit and as he began to read the paper he patted at his chest, a frown suddenly appearing.
“You can’t expect that a duel will be in a controlled setting, that it’ll be you versus another person. Duels can happen anywhere and so many things can be happening around you,” picking up on the rage lacing Conner’s tone Harry could only wonder what he had seen, “A moment distraction could cost you your life or the life of another,” it was with that dark tone that the training was finished and the group walked back towards the common room.
It took Harry a few moments to process the information.
Tears were building up and before he could make it to the nearest secluded hallway he broke down. Sitting between two armored statues Harry brought up his knees to his chest and cried silent tears, his body convulsing, as his sobs racked his body.
“Better Professor; how are Esmelda and Anderson doing?” he could see Madam Pomfrey busying herself a few beds down and Harry could imagine her swooping in if he strained himself.
“That fool of a Headmaster! What an absolute disgrace that he has brought the Hogwarts name, splitting someone’s soul for personal gain, splitting my heir’s soul,” Salazar roared, and Harry felt a tremble beneath his feet.
“How’d you manage to set this up,” he teased lightly, and the sweet smile was quickly replaced with Draco’s famous smirk.
Draco raised a brow.
“What do you remember from last night Harry,” having expected the inquiry Harry recounted the events, he told Dumbledore about finding Esmelda, the spells fired, and being cornered in the abandoned classroom.
“Oh, my silver fox,” he mimicked in an obnoxiously high-pitched voice, Draco groaned.
“Of the three blood heir rituals that were done with success it was found that they were the heir but,” she hesitated, “it wasn’t the success that was expected.”
“We’ll be taking our leave, I don’t want my mate in an environment such as this,” wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulder Draco snapped his finger and the same house elf from last night appeared.
“What happened Blaise?” he asked urgently but Blaise only shook his head.
“I promised myself I would never force a bond on my mate, even if my mate chooses to not be with me,” silver eyes met Harry’s green and Harry felt uncomfortable at the blatant honesty he was receiving.
“You say that like it was a good experience,” he commented dryly and the Slytherin’s snickered, “I’ve never met a more disgruntled person,” Draco opened his mouth to retort and Harry sent him a look.
They eased into a conversation about exams and the following few weeks before winter break. Aside from his comment to Dumbledore earlier Harry hadn’t given the winter break much thought as he had always stayed at the castle but realizing that it would be the first time without Ron left a painful burn in his heart.
The afternoon of the Hogsmeade visit found Harry chatting with Hermione, Luna, and Neville as they approached the quaint town near Hogwarts, both Blaise and Draco had weekend Prefect duty and Hermione had confessed to the group that it was suspected they fought with another student but no one was confessing so the Professors were keeping a closer eye on them.
Walking past his room he realized Draco was steering him to the blonde’s own room.
“I, what?” Harry was baffled at how she was able to piece it together.
“Hermione, it’s more than that, it’s a special situation, you see he’s –” commotion from the end of the isle had both looking up; there were two Gryffindor’s rushing by cackling and Hermione immediately pushed back her shoulder’s.
Wincing as his leg throbbed and burned, he pointed his wand and cried out an
Blaise had got Harry a new broom kit despite that he wasn’t playing this year but Harry had appreciated it nonetheless, it was the latest kit and Harry was already itching to use it with his Firebolt, even Draco looked at him enviously.
Heading back to his group Harry was grateful that none of them had gone off to see what had been keeping him though as Harry sat down, he realized Neville was packing up.
“Potter started it! He tried to attack me! I was just defending myself,” Draco had placed himself between his mate and his fellow sixth year while Blaise hovered by the door keeping prying eyes at bay.
the man mused.
“Where’s Missus Weasley?”
followed by an
“So, I’m your mate?” a curt nod was the answer that he received.
Anger like nothing he’d felt before came over him. He thought of Sirius dying at the hands of his cousin, how his mate had been cursed by this woman. As he screamed a whirlwind of air whipped around him, it felt like he had walked into the heart of a thunderstorm as his magic crackled along his arms, down his body, and vibrated his fingertips.
Glancing up at Draco the Veela’s face was blank, but Harry could sense that the boy was angry, even looking towards Blaise his brown eyes were darker than they had been before.
Dumbledore had Draco.
“What about, what about the war? We’re on opposing sides,” Malfoy’s face hardened.
Ron paled commenting that there wasn’t any homework for Herbology; Hermione’s eyes narrowed as Ginny and Luna both laughed.
Bellatrix let out a screech and when it looked like she was going to turn to leave her hand snapped towards him.
Harry woke with a start as he felt beads of sweat drip down the back of his neck. He was panting as if he had been running and for a moment, he didn’t recognize that he was in his bed or in his dorm room. He was startled as he felt arms wrap around his torso, he had forgotten he had fallen asleep with Draco, too.
“What about you, ma’am? Where was your spot?”
,” finally snapping Harry grabbed Draco’s face and forced him to concentrate on what he was saying.
Blaise’s suggestion had made him blush and slam his hands over his ears as the teen cackled madly much to Draco’s confusion.
hit his bag and sent the contents flying, including his wand, Harry’s anger flared. Glaring at Ron, Harry turned to find his wand.
“If that’s the case and this usually happens after the bond is completed, how could this happen now?” Draco shrugged.
Tension flooded his body as a different set of silver eyes bypassed Draco and landed on him.
Picking her up he peered around the corner realizing that the flames that were usually lit, were starting to go out. Moving around the corner and down the hallway Harry saw the spell shot towards them before it had made contact, using his Seeker reflexes Harry moved him and Esmelda to the side and he rushed down another hallway and then turned immediately down another.
“Early on, when an heir was impossible to produce for a line, a blood heir ritual was attempted,” Harry watched her as she flipped to a different page and pointed to a small passage near the bottom.
Harry
When the silence lapped for an extended amount of time Harry shifted uncomfortably on his feet, “Hunted?” he pressed, haunted eyes flickered towards him.
“It came with a cost, the magical community wanted to destroy us, tear apart our family. We buried our secrets with us because our homes had been attacked, it was best that we didn’t bring attention to where the members of the family were laid to rest,” when it was clear Salazar wasn’t going to say anything more on the subject Harry pushed open the door with a loud
Draco shrugged.
Oooooo, so much information here! We now know who Harry’s new enemy is, thoughts?
“The Founders?” whatever the Headmaster had expected to hear Harry caught a glimpse in his expression that it wasn’t that, Harry shook his head.
“Slytherin?” nothing, the man didn’t move.
“Professor Dumbledore wants to see you tomorrow before breakfast, he has an affinity for ice mice as of late,” and with that Snape’s robes snapped behind him as the man turn and exited the common room. Huffing, Harry closed his eyes and counted to ten.
Grabbing both Blaise and Draco’s gifts Harry trekked towards the common room and nodded towards one of the seventh years that had stayed behind. Everyone had kept to themselves for the most part and it was vastly quieter than it would have been in the Gryffindor house.
Harry assumed it was just a fluke with his first spell.
It was thirty minutes later that they approached the dinning room that they had left the night before. Draco had a smug look on his face while Harry blushed each time the blonde shot him a look; he couldn’t resist his mate.
Now was the moment of truth.
“Get Snape,” not checking to see if Blaise had heard him, he rounded the next corner and in front of the familiar stone passage.
Both of Draco’s parents seemed stunned at his answer, Missus Malfoy dabbed her napkin at the corner of her mouth, “Well that’s an awful long time to know who your mate is darling,” Draco swallowed a bite of food.
“It could have been triggered from the stressful situation, I’m not too sure,” Harry groaned, and Draco looked panicked.
“Evans, Harry Evans,” she nodded and had him fill out some basic information and he breathed a sigh of relief that he had enough money to cover his stay.
“I have an idea of where to look for these Horcruxes,” Harry tried to smile, but he was still so confused.
Professor McGonagall congratulated the students on their house placements but as she went to reach for the hat when the hat did something unexpected, it sang again.
Making his way over he kept his head down in hopes Blaise wouldn’t tear into him and it was a clap on his shoulder that had him glancing up at the Prefect who had looked down at him with a sheepish smile.
“I didn’t mean for Draco to get hurt,” he repeated as if the words were to sound better a second time, and when she made no motion that she had heard him he shuffled his feet, “Draco wanted to be there, he never wanted me to go alone, he saw the curse coming towards me before I could react and he stepped in front of it, I never wanted him to get hurt,” his heart clenched at the image of his mate laying in the bed, how pale he looked.
“He hasn’t talked to me since Sirius died. I’m really worried about him,” he murmured as he tied the letter to her leg, she ruffled her wings and Harry knew that was her way of comforting him.
He had seen Draco topless before and he had seen Draco naked – though typically in lower light, but seeing him now, hair skewed and his lean body walking towards him, Harry felt as if his body was on fire.
“Merope told me about her family, how she gave birth to a son, a son she named after the father,” he let out a dark chuckle, “Tom, Tom Marvolo Riddle Junior. I’m Riddle’s heir,” he said softly.
A feeling of dread came over him and his heart began to race once more.
For the next hour Harry relived what had happened the night before, as he told Blaise about Draco stepping in front of the Cruciatus Curse that his Aunt had initially aimed at him Blaise had looked at his friend with worry.
“Mister Potter, I’d recommend that you talk with Draco, before you commit to any decision about walking away from the bond,” there was a lengthy pause as Harry was lost in thought before he stood up and headed towards the door.
So, Tuesday night as he sat at the Slytherin table during dinner he sat alone. Blaise hadn’t spoke to him since their discussion and Harry didn’t have the heart to fight for him, he readily accepted the blame for everything.
A handful of students got partial marks; Parkinson had only conjured one bird, Nott’s birds were the wrong type, Ron’s wand movement was incorrect so the birds were disfigured, and Seamus had blundered his way through the spell unable to conjure any birds.
“Well what, you’ll just do this at the manor during break since I’m so incompetent?” Harry turned away missing the astonished look from his two friends.
“Well, we weren’t able to celebrate Valentine’s together, so I wanted to make it up to you,” tugging at his arm Harry let himself be pulled into the blonde’s embrace and opened his lips willingly as Draco’s lips descended on his.
From his vantage point he could see that the building was at least four stories and there were dozens of windows lining the wall. The manor was of a deep red brick with black wooden frames outlining the clear glass. The main entrance was a thick wooden door with a hoop handle that reminded Harry of the castles that were in his History of Magic textbooks. He watched with fascination as Lady Zabini held up her hand and the door glowed before opening.
Breathing out his nose he repositioned his feet to trap Draco’s beneath him. Shooting the Slytherin a glare the blonde winked in return.
The boys exchanged a few more words before the lesson was over, and Harry was happy that between double Charms and a period of Divination that lunch was next. Walking his way down the spiraling stairs Harry felt hands on his back and lurched forward.
“Uhm, thank you for letting me stay,” he winced at how foreign his voice sounded to him.
As he finished getting ready in his room, he packed his bag with the items that he had picked up in Flagley; a new quill and ink, fresh parchment, notebooks for each of his classes, and a day planner. He realized it was the first time he didn’t have Hermione hovering over him making sure that he and Ron were properly packed.
“I can’t feel Draco,” he whimpered, a nearby flower caught fire and with a flick of his wand Snape doused it with water, Harry’s emotions were still unstable, and his magic was reacting to it.
Staring at the feather that had been placed in front of him Harry thought fondly to the first time Hermione had explained how to say the incantation correctly to Ron. Picking up his wand he thought about how Hermione’s feather had floated before anyone else’s had, it was a pleasant memory.
As Harry headed back to his own room his mind was still going over the discussion he had with Dumbledore, specifically the Horcruxes.
‘I have blood protection because of my Aunt, but,’ Harry licked his lips as his mind raced.
Harry looked towards Draco shocked as had Blaise, Draco smirked.
“Hm, boyfriend you say, well depending on his tastes I have an assortment of jewelry that may fit him,” he waved Harry towards a different part of the store.
Nothing happened.
The bank was noticeably different than the one in Diagon Alley; there were only a handful of goblins lining the walls and two were already engaged in transactions. Heading towards the furthermost goblin available Harry waited patiently to be noticed.
Harry was gentle to not disturb the dust or anything else surrounding the book.
The magic in the room sizzled and Harry felt an electric like current run through his fingertips. Nibbling on his bottom lip he looked up at Tom who was thumbing the locket ever so carefully.
“Well, yeah I can, but you see,” he was interrupted as she wrapped her arm threw his and he immediately tried pulling away.
“He said that I’m just as evil as any other Slytherin,” Harry said softly, the last bit of students were wandering in as Professor Flitwick headed to the front of the class, Neville squeezed Harry’s arm but refrained from continuing the discussion.
Crabbe was sorted into Hufflepuff as was Neville, and a second year Ravenclaw was sorted into Gryffindor. Malfoy had been called up but like it had happened first year the hat had barely touched his head before it cried out Slytherin.
He remembered Hermione explaining to him and Ron why there wasn’t a better defense when gaining entrance into that section of the library. She told them the Madam Pince kept a closer eye on that door as much as she did on the students and knew immediately if someone tried entering in. The punishment she usually dealt was worse than something Filch could come up with.
Reaching out he placed a hand on both his and Draco’s shoulder and with a crack, they were gone.
“Most, if not all, individuals in this family have been trained to channel their magic into reading and understanding the Parseltongue language. It’s not a trait that anyone can use as the magic hasn’t evolved enough until the person is of age,” Harry’s green eyes trailed the lines on the pages.
“Alright Hedwig, I’m not sure where Remus is, but I’m hoping you can find him,” he paused, as unease wormed its way into his mind.
“Like who Ginny?” he felt Hermione’s presence next to him and Luna’s comforting touch at his elbow which had reassured him that his friends were there for him.
The modified Invigoration Draught had done wonders and Harry felt himself able to balance it all. He was still cautious, because while everything was going fine, that seemed to be the problem.
The four moved slowly, Harry’s labored breathing and Esmelda’s sniffles filling the silence and after a few turns Esmelda inhaled sharply as they came up on a motionless figure. Blaise transferred Esmelda to Draco as Harry gripped her shoulders, hearing a sigh Blaise waved his wand over the boy.
For once, Harry wasn’t bothered by the notion, Esmelda’s panicked face kept appearing in his mind as with Anderson’s motionless body.
“Has Hogwarts not taught the students about who founded the school? How has the head of the Slytherin house not shown my picture, taught my ideals,” the man muttered, and Harry furrowed his brows, founders?
Dragging himself up he cast a few cleaning charms and did the best with his hair as he made his way down to Transfiguration. His stomach was still in knots and the thought of breakfast made him cringe.
“You didn’t ask to be resorted, and despite what you or others may think, Slytherin’s aren’t vicious beasts driven to attack,” Harry felt the heat rise in his cheeks, “now that’s not to say your presence in the house has made every one happy, but for the most part, I’d say we’re just observing,” the boy said factually.
“Hey girl,” he said with a smile as she flew straight towards him as he entered the owlery, Draco had gone to find his own familiar while Blaise stood off by the door, not a fan of the winged birds in the room.
“I was only child growing up and my parents doted on me every chance they had, they were never cruel or mean as some Pureblood parents were but gave me anything I needed and anything I wanted. I was definitely spoiled,” she smiled reminiscently.
Briefly he thought of Ron and Hermione and he had to control his mounting frustration tethered to his best friends. No owls from them, neither reaching out to see how he was coping after Sirius’ death, absolute silence.
So, Wednesday afternoon after leaving the Potions lecture Harry managed to catch Malfoy before the blonde did his disappearing act.
Speculating, Harry meandered his way back down to the dungeon, he was lost enough in thought that it had taken him a moment to realize that there were footsteps behind him. Panicking, flashes of the attack sent him into overdrive, and he slipped down another corridor, doubling back through a different hallway hoping to catch whomever was following him.
“Oh Harry, are you okay?” Harry could see Draco biting back a snide comment at Hermione’s question, said girl had tears in her eyes.
“This is the room Missus Malfoy told me to take you too,” Harry went to say something when the elf shook its head, ears flopping from side to side.
“After we died and our portraits were hung here at Hogwarts, we’ve been sought out by all the Headmaster’s, or mistresses, during one point or another in their time overseeing the school. Many asked us for guidance, or advice, some sought out the knowledge that we had while we were alive, but unfortunately, only one has sought out some of the darkest secrets we hold,” her face dropped as she glanced towards her unmoving co-founders.
Motioning with her head she led him down the hall and up a flight of stairs to room 213, pressing the key into the palm of his hand she prattled on about places to eat and where to shop.
“C’mon you two, it’s Christmas!” Harry chuckled at the whine from the other side of the door as Draco rolled his eyes.
“I am aware of your adventure to Flagley this summer Harry and I’m most disappointed in your choice to leave the safety of your family. Mister Spaulding is a friend of the Order and was kind enough to reach out and make me aware of your location,” Harry’s hand clenched the doorknob tight enough that his knuckles turned white, “I’ve reached out to the Dursleys and they were most upset that you left and will be happy to see you return home at the end of the school year,” his tone left no room for discussion but Harry didn’t care, he was angry, he was mad, he felt so betrayed.
“I’m not sure, we left after we played chess,” humming Harry cocked his head to the side, ears straining he could hear footsteps and Esmelda stilled in his arms.
Sensing the question, the seventh year shot him an amused grin.
“Yes dear, this caught us quite for a shock,” Missus Malfoy interjected smoothly, and Harry slowly crept to Draco’s side as the blonde tugged him forward, two sets of eyes landed on him.
“I promise I’ll tell you everything Hermione, just,” he paused, “not right now,” at her hurt look he felt a pang sting his heart and as much as he wanted to comfort her, he refrained.
“Think nothing of it Mister Potter,” the three walked to the entrance and Harry was in awe at the sheer size of the manor.
Draco had.
“Slytherin’s have a dueling club?” Neville seemed more intrigued than surprised and Harry briefly felt a longing for the DA club that they had started the previous year.
It was a large room that was empty except for a desk and a chair, one that currently being occupied.
“Harry enjoys fresh fruit, particularly strawberries. I think if he could he’d have a plate of fruit with each meal,” Draco mused, “I’m merely taking care of my mate, just like you have with mother. I vaguely remember you throwing a fit at cousin Atticus’ birthday because the seafood wasn’t the quality mother liked,” Harry watched as a smile pulled at Missus Malfoy’s lips, quickly concealed by her drink as her husband stabbed a part of his breakfast viciously so.
Neville sucked in his breath.
“Helga Hufflepuff?” he asked even though he knew who it was, she let out a tinkering laugh and nodded.
He took a step forward and the locket hummed even more, Tom stopped mid step and a look of confusion washed over his face, he could sense the magic as well.
Harry had aimed the explosive spell at the wall next to one of his attackers, while he knew they were aiming to kill, he wasn’t.
“Would you like to go on a date next weekend?” the butterflies returned, and Harry wondered if they would ever go away around the blonde.
“What were you thinking,” black eyes were furious as he hissed at him, “What were you and my ignorant godson thinking?” Harry didn’t think much of the man’s furry as he felt the last bit of energy begin to deplete, sagging forward he was grateful that despite Snape’s anger the man steadied him.
“I will always protect you Harry,” bringing Harry face up to him the Veela captured his lips in a kiss and as Harry melted into his embrace, he sighed.
Walking down the line Harry went to enter the train when a familiar blonde hair caught his eye.
“Looks like you’ve got your own fan club here,” shooting Blaise an annoyed look the Prefect laughed.
“Malfoy said it would come in time, but I can’t imagine being good enough for the first Quidditch match at the end of the month,” the other boy commented dryly.
“Will your parents be mad that it’s me? That there won’t be a future Malfoy heir?” Malfoy smirked.
Another turn and a spell hit the wall next to him causing the stone to shatter. Footsteps were getting closer and Harry hissed as a mild version of the cutting curse caught his shoulder; ignoring Esmelda’s gasp and the burning sensation as the blood trickled down his back Harry pointed his wand behind him and muttered
It was blood covering it, and Harry knew immediately whose blood it was.
“I don’t know why you are in my house, I will not tolerate misbehavior as you have shown in Gryffindor, there is an expectation of matureness that you will need to display,” Harry’s anger flared at Snape’s blatant disrespect and the light near them flickered, Snape’s dark eyes shot to it.
On the paper more words began to appear.
he tapped the knob with an uninjured finger hesitantly before he deemed it safe to open.
It was two hours later before Harry finally found himself back in the Slytherin common room sitting on one of the couches next to Draco and across from Blaise. Many of the students hovering around them didn’t approach them but kept sending them curious glances.
“I’ve watched you wander the halls here for awhile now,” springing up, Harry spun around, heart thumping, as he looked at a woman standing down the path from him.
Breakfast was quiet and if Lady Zabini suspected anything she didn’t let on; she was teary-eyed as she walked the teen’s towards the Portkey area and handed them a book that was going to activate shortly. As she pulled her only son into a hug, she muttered something to him, and he let out an undignified whine which had Harry smiling.
He knew she fancied Krum, but it hadn’t lasted once he left after the tournament. Harry rubbed at his jaw, he thought there might have been something between her and Ron though because of this year it had pushed them further apart.
“My Lord, what can I help you with,” Tom handed him a vial that Snape took peering at it with a blank face.
“I’m sorry, I should have asked….”
“Er, yes.”
A chill ran through Harry’s blood. Draco’s hand tensed, but he didn’t pull away. “Are we what?” Draco pressed.
Draco’s pale hands slip against the wheel. “Pansy…”
“Draco, we need to leave. Right now,” Harry hissed, and Draco lowered his wand, the seriousness of what he had done immediately registering within him. He nodded once, then the duo quickly moved out of the booth and headed for the door. Patrons stared as they left, their eyes burning holes into their backs.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked, pulling up two armchairs for himself and Draco with a flick of his wand.
A few minutes passed as Sprout waited for the rest of her class to arrive. A large, long box stood in the middle of the greenhouse, filled to the brim with blackish-brown loam. There weren’t any plants poking through it, though Harry could see the surface moving as if thick worms were crawling beneath it.
Then Rabbit gasped. The ropes suddenly tightened around Harry’s chest, knocking the air out of him. Woozily, he opened his eyes.
A massive explosion vibrated through the walls.
For a terrifying, fleeting moment, Draco wants to join them in whatever heroic quest they’re undertaking. But then he spots the mask of an infiltrating Death Eater, and he remembers what side he’s on in this godforsaken war. Leaving Goyle unconscious by the wall, Draco brushes off his clothes and grits his teeth. Whether he has a wand or not, he knows exactly who he serves. And Voldemort won’t hesitate to kill him lest he forgets that.
For a moment he thought he detected some understanding in her eyes, as if she had known this was the story he really wanted, but a second later her face had become guarded again, a perfect, imperious mask.  “There are so many stories to tell about him, which one did you want?”
After taking his ears, one of the Death Eaters stabbed his eye with the tip of his knife, emitting a gushing sound.  He twisted the knife hard into the socket and when he pulled it out, the eyeball came with it.  That earned him a congratulatory whoop from the Death Eater next to him.
“Far, far away, to a secret tower in the ruins of an old castle.  And there she wept and wilted.”
A second later Diri appeared again, holding a small, clear vial.  Narcissa pulled on Harry’s jaw, opening up his mouth and pouring droplets of the clear liquid within.
After that, his sense of time was even further distorted.  He knew that many prominent Death Eaters, among them his father, had taken turns cursing Harry’s body, making it spin in the air, making it convulse with cruciatus, lifting it up and then letting it fall till Draco could hear the bones inside him break.  But that was just the start.
“I’m only trying to be helpful.”
“Draco?” Harry whispered.
Narcissa wrinkled her nose in distaste.  “Draco-” she began but he was not about to let her finish.
This was magic from another realm.  This was magic that should not exist.  He understood that now, in a way he had never before.  This act would alienate him from everything in the world, everything except Harry.  And still there was nothing but certainty within him.
“What did he do then?”
She kissed his knuckles under the thin veil of the cloak, and a moment later he had slid out of her reach again in order to return to Harry.
His father was the first to appear.  “What in Merlin’s name-” he began, but he stopped when he saw Draco.  His eyes went wide, looking at the blood and then at the wild, desperate look in his eyes.
The plan had been to cut three, right at the base.  However, he brought the knife down at an awkward angle so that his middle finger was cut off right below the knuckle, so all three of them became bloody stumps.  The digits dropped into the remains and he stared at his hand, now so unfamiliar.  He waited for the pain to hit, for the deep ache of the missing fingers, but he felt nothing at all.  The knife slid from his right hand onto the grass by his bare knees, and he closed his eyes.
What would have happened if he had been caught then?  If Draco had really handed him over, like he was supposed to? How would he feel then? Would Harry’s death seem more real to him? Would he have gotten the opportunity to actually watch him die?
“You could go back to Hogwarts to finish your last year,”  Narcissa would say, as if she had not heard her husband.  “I’m sure for all you have done for him, you would be made head boy at the very least.”
The day of All Hallows’ Eve he found himself deep in the Highlands.  He was following a sort of wisp in the air, a faint sense that was guiding him forever Northward.  From high cliffs he saw the sunrise over grey waters.  Underneath the cloak he was drenched from the previous night's rain, his hair was matted, his clothes had gone many days without change.  But in that moment, as he saw the golden light over the sea, he knew that all of these were unimportant details – there was something else coming – something stronger.  He was not moving North on a whim, there was something there, something calling to him.
“I guess.”
“Avada Kedrava.”
“Devoted?” Voldemort laughed again, and this time the Death Eaters joined him.  “Devoted enough to bring my greatest adversary back from the dead?”
In consequence of this he started staying in places longer, investigating them for days at a time before moving on.  He spent most of his time under the cloak, moving between trees, putting his palm against stones and mossy rocks.  Although he knew very little about old magic, there was something familiar in it.  Maybe it was because of his bloodlines, but old magic made the air feel different.  He could sense it when they were getting close to Hogwarts, a shift in the space about them.  It wasn’t a smell, it wasn’t a taste, it was nothing he could put his finger on; it was a feeling, clinging to every particle, as if magic had a weight all its own.
This was not what was supposed to happen.  He had struggled for months and months to bring Harry back and this most certainly was not how things were supposed to go.  They were supposed to have a happy ending.  Without sickness, without Voldemort, without death.  It was supposed to be just them.
“Humans should devise a way to spend more time under water.”
The light within the tub was blinding now. He could see nothing of its interior and he had to bring his arm to his face to shield himself from its harshness. Yet despite the fact that his eyes were shut tight and that his arm was shielding his face, he could still see the light.  In fact, he could almost feel it.  The light was colder than the air.  It felt like a current, waving through them, chilling and severe.
“You have two options.” Faraday held up both her pointer fingers for emphasis. “Go home without magic and search for help in England. I don’t know if you’ll find it. Or visit my associate in Thailand. He is an expert in these malicious forms of magic. Go to him, then you can return home safely.”
Harry’s eyes went owlish. He’d never been out of the country before this mission. “That’s amazing.”
Harry, at least, made the work easier to bear. Between pages, he’d make friendly conversation, dispensed a few amusing anecdotes about his time in boarding school and working as a star, and asked Draco just enough questions to not make him feel uncomfortable. Draco finished his part of the contract as Harry was barely two-thirds through and helped him by highlighting important clauses and summing up certain sections.
They grinned like a shark, an expression that was eerie to see on Draco’s face. “Promise not to curse me if I let you go?”
“No, thanks,” Draco replied automatically.
“Nothing.” His voice trembled with the possibility of a lie.
“It hasn’t been tried in centuries. It’s a mind-reading spell, sort of - more of a mental and emotional bond that forms between two willing casters. The people who created it a long time ago used it against their enemies. It didn’t work, so it was abandoned.” As he spoke, Harry watched the milky foam in his cappuccino begin to dissolve. He waved a hand over it, and the foam appeared as good as new. Merlin, he loved this city - wandless magic came so easily to him here. “Professor Aida, Draco, and I figured out how to make it work. Apparently, only people with a strong emotional bond can do the spell successfully.”
“Sorry!” Luna steps back, silver eyes wide with apology. “I brought you this.” She holds out a mug of coffee.
Joey clenched her eyes shut and tugged the blanket firmly up to her chin, but the bed was considerably less warm and cozy without her friend. Muttering words that would earn her a slap on the hand from her aunties, Joey shuffled into some slippers and made her way outside.
Silence. Harry peered around Draco, staring at the tip of his wand, waiting for something, anything.
Draco tuts, but he returns the hug. “I love you, too, you nut. Now calm down and tell me what’s going on before I lose my bloody mind. Please.” Harry’s smile is hidden in his lover’s shoulder, noticing, not for the first time, how Draco’s accent comes out when he’s upset or worried.
minding my business, Draco.”
,” while simultaneously drawing her wand back. Owen suddenly appeared to be moving in slow motion; the whole class could see his wand raise as if going through molasses.
“Minus murder,” Joey pointed out in English.

“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Well, you gave each other things, didn’t you?” Molly beamed, “And you’re never too old for presents.”
“I’m not saying it’s
“No.” Saturday, o sweet reprieve.
“I think we’d better,” Joey replied. “Whatever it is, we can handle it.”
“A bit. The face cards are a jack, queen, and king instead of an elf, goblin, and giant.”
“In the meantime, you all can stay in the student dormitories,” Ray said. “I’ll show you.”
Harry whacked the table with his open palm, making them jump. “Broomstick! Yes, I’ve got a broomstick. For, er, Quidditch. Yeah. Seeker.” He loved Luna to bits, but she could be
“Shall we fight it?” Harry asked. He was watching the sunset, too.
Joey bristled. “I’ll share what I need to. And, as I’ve gathered, your stories,” Joey gestured to them, “Are linked.”
“How she lets people begin again.”
Harry gave an exasperated huff and opened his mouth to argue, but Hermione lay a gentle hand on his arm. “Let it go for now, will you?” She pleaded. “Give it some time. We’ll all learn to get along.” They all looked across the Slytherin common room to Draco, who studied by himself, focused on pages and pages of notes. “In the meantime, you two should focus on passing tomorrow’s test.”
Presently, a little girl, wearing a purple dress, began to traipse down the grass, her hair in buns and a basket of white rose petals in hand. A few adults on Hermione’s side cooed and encouraged her as she tossed the blossoms into the air; Draco figured she must be Hermione’s younger cousin or something. Not far behind came Ron and Ginny, side by side, her holding a small bouquet of roses and him wearing a nervous smile and dark blue dress robes. As they reached the trellis, Ginny stood opposite him, and a little farther back as tall, mustached wizard moved to the center.
Draco gritted his teeth and strode down the corridor, heading for the stairs, Andromeda close behind. “Try not to break any furniture,” she chided. “I’ll be in the garden with Teddy.” She left as they reached the living room, and Draco walked into the foyer.
Draco
“Ron?” Harry says incredulously. He’s no older than fifteen, taller than most of his peers. Then Harry looks down at himself, and realizes that he, too, is the same age. The vigor of youth is injected into his muscles; the familiar energy and adrenaline that comes before a game sends his heart pumping.
“Anyway, that’s her,” Ron says, pointing, “Black headband. Well? What do you think?”
“Have they been starving you?” Draco hissed under his breath, sparing a cautious glance at the Healer standing guard nearby.
“What?” said the others in unison.
“Deftones,” Draco continues, “It’s odd to see metal mixed in with all this, er…” He waves a hand at the Billie Holiday, Eartha Kitt, Dean Martin. “Older music.”
“I’m sorry that you didn’t feel comfortable enough to talk to me,” when Harry made a noise in the back of his throat of protest Draco shot him a look, “I’ve stuck by your side through this entire Riddle mess, and I will always be by your side,” he finished and Harry shifted to move closer into the Veela’s embrace.
“Harry, I think –“ he could hear Hermione trying to call out to him but he had wrapped his arms around Draco’s torso and held him tight.
Her upper lip curled towards him, “You’re pathetic Potter, I had caught her crying in one of the hallways, mourning her loss of her little Savior,” she said mockingly, “when we found out we had mutual hatred, it was easy to plan it,” she said snidely, and Harry’s frown deepened.
“The manor is reacting to Lucius’ anger, he wouldn’t have had time to ban you from entering but the magic here is tailored to him,” Harry licked his lips, but with his next step came a scream from further in the halls, immediately his bond was open and he felt Draco, his mate was in pain.
“I – ” Harry didn’t have time to move out of the way as a spell hit him square in the chest and knocked him backwards, as his back collided with the wall he felt himself gasping for air as the wind was knocked out of him.
Sighing, Neville shoved the last of his books in his bag and bid the group farewell. Draco was still eyeing him suspiciously while Blaise chewed on the tip of his quill as he skimmed over his completed assignment.
“Annoying, the lot of them,” Blaise sneered as a third year scuttled having been caught peeking over his text at the trio.
Harry didn’t want to watch more, he was shaking, and he felt like everything in his world was turned upside down.
Gently applying the salve, he winced as it burned then bubbled before drying, glancing upwards he shifted uncomfortably as his head of house was still waiting for a response.
“He’s a Slytherin Hermione! It’s a house filled with dark witches and wizards, he’s no better than them, he’s probably been hiding his dark magic from us all along,” Harry should have been prepared that Ron wouldn’t have handled the resorting well, memories of the Triwizard Tournament flashed before him and Harry frowned.
Harry should have known.
“Draco, it can’t be real,” his voice cracked, and it took all his control to reign in his emotions and to not let his magic lash out around them.
He made a beeline for Draco’s room, and once inside noted that nothing was out of place, everything was as neat and organized as it had been that morning down to the sock that had been left in the corner that he had tossed aside just to tease the blonde. As nothing was amiss, he headed towards his room, hand lingering on the doorknob as something felt off, nothing great, just slightly off. The wards that he had up since the beginning of the school year were still in place and not tampered with, but he felt nervous as he pushed his door open.
But he sometimes gave Harry an odd look, like there was something he wanted to say but didn’t quite know how. Harry knew though, that if it was important, Draco would come to him about it eventually. Draco always did, in the end.
‘Sorry, I came as quickly as I could. You know what it’s like trying to leave the office for lunch.’ Hermione sat down in the chair opposite Harry and took a sip of the coffee he’d ordered her. She must have sensed Harry’s panicked stare, because her calm, contented, coffee-sipping look became one of worry as she looked up at him.
‘It is not up to you to demand “why” of me, Potter, but it is for you to obey the orders you’re given. Unless, that is, you no longer wish to become a fully qualified auror?’
, Edward, Dray -
‘Shall we begin?’
‘Oh, really?’ Draco looked around at Harry, grey eyes wide in interest.
True, it had been somewhat strained in the weeks following his split with Ginny, and the family struggling to come to terms with a family unit without Fred after the war, but the Burrow would always be a home for him.
‘Well-’
But this was just how they spoke to each other, always had been. Admittedly, yes, their interactions had involved more hexes and curses whilst still at school, and they seemed to have mellowed out a great deal during the years since and their parole period together, but
date, and Harry thanked every deity he could think of that the room was dark and the near-constant blush of his cheeks wasn’t visible.
Without mentioning it to Draco at all?
They never got around to watching the film Harry had picked out, and cold pizza is sometimes better than hot.
‘Hey! I don’t have that many!’
‘Hey,’ Harry whispered back, looking over at Draco’s half-face in the darkness.
’d Potter whilst they both sat there. Draco would get the blame for that no doubt. But why was Potter telling him about his godson?
‘I look after him every Thursday evening so his grandmother can go to her book club. It’s no trouble really, he’s only three and I can put a film on and he goes straight to sleep.’ Harry was babbling now, but he couldn’t seem to stop. Maybe someone had slipped some Babbling Beverage into his tea? That must be the only explanation, ‘unless it’s
Draco ducked his head down, another fierce blush on his cheeks. Suddenly, the blushing all made sense to Harry.
He shook him off.  ‘Just took me by surprise is all.’
‘Have you- damn. Out of ink. Hang on.’ He reached across his desk for his extra bottles of ink. It made his sleeve ride up a fraction, but Harry was fairly certain his brand new tattoo would remain hidden. ‘Okay… have you taken any illegal potions?’
, of course, can’t get enough of that one y’know, makes me sing along to all the songs with him.’
at a moment's notice.
Draco raised one singular perfect eyebrow and looked highly unimpressed. Harry tried desperately not to wince again.
Before he even had time to blink, his face was full of bushy brown hair. Harry smiled and closed his eyes, breathing in the familiar scent of cinnamon of his best friend as he wrapped his arms around her.
After what felt like another three years, an impenetrable silence, and Harry feeling like he might just combust at any moment, Malfoy nodded.
Malfoy was… concerned? More than just the usual tattoo artist to tattooee that's for sure.
It was only as Potter turned to head to the door that Draco realised they had both completely forgotten he was there. He cleared his throat and Potter jumped a mile, almost jostling Edward back onto the floor.
He was well and truly fucked, and he didn’t mind one bit.
Harry, aren’t you.’
If Harry hadn’t been so confident in his ability to throw off the Imperious curse since he was fourteen, he’d start to wonder if someone had slipped him under it when he hadn’t noticed. That and the fact that he didn’t seem to be feeling the blissful happiness that always accompanied the Imperious curse, instead it was more of a confused daze and a general feeling of unease. The knot that had appeared in his stomach had just been getting worse.
-convict he was now responsible for was sitting just feet away. He felt sick. He could hear Hermione in his head, an odd combination of chastising him and spurring him on;
‘Honestly, how can this happen?’
‘Potter, for the love of Merlin, why are you telling me?’
‘Harry!’ She scolded, ‘how could you say that! What’s the poor boy ever done to you?’
‘I was never pretending!’ Draco shouted. Harry had to force himself to remember how to breathe.
was - and it worked.
‘Alright, get out of here and go to your emergency. Floo me when you’re done. I’ll most likely be here but if I head home I’ll owl you.’
‘Yeah! … isn’t that why you invited me out for a drink? Our infamous karaoke battles?’
There wasn’t a Death Eater’s chance in Hogwarts at that.
Malfoy was on the phone when Harry met him at the coffee shop he’d chosen in muggle London,
‘I guess you do.’ Draco turned to look up at Harry. ‘Lucky me.’
Only Draco's face quickly flicked between expressions, almost too quickly for Harry to catch; from shock to confusion to understanding to outrage to pure, unadulterated hatred. It had been a while since that particular expression had been directed at Harry, and he certainly did not miss it. It was as if Harry had personally insulted his firstborn child.
sodding
‘Has your living situation changed?’
Harry and Draco were walking down the hill from the bus stop towards the high street. They were finally alone, finally not stuck revising for chemistry, finally not stuck singing karaoke badly. Finally, Harry hoped, heading towards this being an actual date.
starting to get through to them all! The older years were easier as most of them fought in the battle, or their parents or siblings did, but the younger ones are finally starting to follow in their footsteps! And if keeping Draco Malfoy out of Azkaban by assigning him to Harry for his parole will help in any way, then so be it!’
It surprised no one, then, when Malfoy became Draco and Potter became Harry, and the two ex-worst enemies became friends.
coffee? Plus his new parole officer bullshit training?
It was Potter’s turn to blanch this time, his eyes widening, but that damn Gryffindor stubbornness only rose to the challenge as Potter recovered himself quickly and made a show of shuffling closer to Draco. The fire whiskey was clearly getting to them both now.
‘Chicken soup? What the hell are you talking about?’
‘Ah but scarhead, if I kill you, who will be there to report that I’ve broken my parole?’ A mock innocence took over his face, eyes wide and lips making a perfect “O”. It didn’t help that his blond hair and grey eyes made him seem positively
‘Cissa and I have actually got back in contact in recent months, I’ll have you know.’
Turning away from the cafe and out of the door, Harry followed Andi as she walked down Diagon with a wobbling Teddy holding her hand. Harry felt sick, and he had a sneaking suspicion that this afternoon’s events would be in the next edition of the
Draco could feel Potter staring at him, Merlin knows he’d got enough practise at Hogwarts to know when he was being stared at. Turning back around to smirk at the other man, his suspicions were confirmed by the small frown on his face, but it was a look that wasn’t entirely displeased, and wasn’t
Harry couldn’t quite believe that Malfoy had agreed to stay and watch
‘Oh. Well that’s useless.’ Draco gave a small laugh at that, and Harry felt his spirit soar at the sound. ‘I can help you with it later if you’d like?’
It took Draco little more than five minutes to fill out the questions that Potter always seemed to drag out into a full hour. Typical useless gryffindors. He looked over at Potter again, and
‘Er, no. No date… and no witches, anyway,’ Harry mumbled,
The sight made Draco’s teeth ache, it was so tooth-rotting-ly sweet and unbearable, Potter was definitely going to have to pay for making him feel so warm and uncomfortable.
‘Oh! No, honestly it’s fine. It seems to be a flat thing as Blaise was ill all last week and Theo went down a few days before I did, so we can all look after each other. Besides, I’m highly contagious, right?’
So, Draco felt sick.
too, which felt even more unnatural, but if “Malfoy” reminded him of his good-for-nothing-toe-rag of a father, Harry couldn’t really blame M-Draco for wanting a bit of distance. But it was going to take a lot of getting used to, even if Draco didn’t hex him for it first.
) in months, hadn’t seen his friends in person since the Battle, and had yet to consume anything other than junk food and firewhiskey. Imagine his surprise when Headmistress McGonagall was apparated directly into his kitchen by one thoroughly pissed-off Kreacher.
Draco followed Potter and a babbling Edward into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. Much like the hallway and the parts of rooms that Draco had glimpsed, the kitchen had received a much similar refresh in its decor.
Draco felt against him, how addicted he was after just one taste. How Draco had not reacted at all.
It had helped that Percy had stopped being a prat and moved back home, having quit his job at the Ministry quite spectacularly in the middle of the final battle, and that Bill and Charlie were spending more time in the week with their mother than at their own professions. Even the Gringotts goblins could understand that the wizarding world had suffered a great loss, which extended into the Weasley family, and turnover on staff at the Romanian reserve was so high anyway, that Charlie taking more extensive leave was neither here nor there for his colleagues.
‘Mother, are you quite alright? Do you need to lie down?’
But then what he’d said sank in. ‘Wait, you’re not the mysterious “P” are you?’
!’ and ‘
He stood abruptly, almost knocking his chair to the floor behind him. His eyes were wild, his hair even wilder. Harry stumbled out of the café, not unlike a new-born fawn trialling out its legs for the first time.
‘I didn’t doze off, I was just thinking about things,’
‘No.’
‘Stinging jinxes?’ Potter seemed shocked, like Draco wasn’t a dirty, evil death eater that deserved to rot in Azkaban like the rest of them, ‘who was it?’
The second the drinks were ready, Harry handed over a handful of galleons that was definitely more than required, took the drinks from the counter, and resolutely did not look at Sam again as he made his way to the table Andi had chosen.
If Malfoy hadn’t been angry before, he was absolutely furious now; Harry was almost sure he could see steam coming from his ears. However, as quickly as the rage had started, it stopped. Malfoy’s fists unclenched, his jaw slackened, the fire died behind his eyes.
‘Like I said to
Harry looked up and met a pair of bright blue eyes shining at him from beneath a mass of floppy, dirty blonde hair. He smiled.
‘No need to be a prick. Have you been in contact with anyone not permitted by the terms of your parole?’
Malfoy was looking at him with that bemused expression again, laughing at him.
‘Yeah! Did you maybe wanna go see it?’
Potter gave him a long and calculating stare. Draco almost squirmed underneath it, but Malfoy’s do not
Turning back to Harry, Ron switched his soft smile to more of a sympathetic grimace. ‘Sorry you’ve got to suffer through a Malfoy party, mate, let alone the git
‘Ugh, don’t make me think about it!’ Ron and Seamus had been poking fun at them all evening, but now that everyone was collecting coats to leave the pub, the comments had taken on a decidedly more

Taking a deep breath and smoothing down any creases that might have taken hold in his shirt, Harry walked over (un)calmly to open the door.
idea to move their weekly meetings from Potter’s office at the ministry to any place around London that took Potter’s fancy. It’d been Potter that had insisted McLaggan and Thorpe be reprimanded for those stinging hexes, and Draco was glad he hadn’t seen them since for fear of what they would retaliate with. He felt like he was hiding behind Potter’s auror skirts and he didn’t like it one bit.
who is P/Patch???????
‘Don’t think you can get out of this by ignoring me, mister. You forget who my sister is. And
They’d decided not to tell their other friends the truth, to keep the secret as close as possible. Harry didn’t look too closely into that, either.
Draco knew he’d hit the nail on the head. ‘Oh come on, sweetheart, you can tell me. I promise I won’t tease unless you beg me to.’
‘How was your parole meeting? Get anyone dangerous?
at last week’s meeting, I’m gonna have to ask you to stop. And possibly never mention them again. Yep. most definitely. Please do not mention them again.’
There was no way out of this now. Not only was Harry now the parole officer of one ex-Death Eater Draco Lucius Malfoy, it was decided by the Minister of Magic and there was absolutely
The two men walked back into the main reception. Eddie was behind the counter and looked up at them both when they came in, as if shocked that they’d both survived the appointment without one of them killing the other. Great support from his boss there.
Two weeks he’d been feeling like this, with no hope of figuring out what was causing it.
‘Oh. Erm. Habit, I guess? He’s always called me Po- erm, my surname, and I’ve always called him Malfoy. It’s just a habit at this point. It would feel weird to call him anything else.’
‘Potter, why are there tiny handprints all over the walls?’
‘Oh, you’ve got pet names for me now, have you?’
‘It’s alright, Malfoy, the fish won’t bite once they’re deep fried,’ Harry chuckled over at him.
‘I brought wine!’ He brandished the bottle again and leaned over to give Harry a one-armed hug. Harry hugged him back, but turned his face away in the hopes that Draco wouldn’t catch sight of his blush.
would definitely take some practise, but habits can be broken and new habits can be forged.
‘I beg your pardon?’ Harry almost choked on his pint.
Patch, who had reached his hand out to grasp Harry’s in a firm shake, stilled it. ‘
They stayed in silence as Draco finished the antlers, only the buzzing of the tattoo gun filling the space between them. He had to admit, this was the most comfortable he’d felt in the presence of anyone -
‘Right.’
parole officer, but his eyes now shone with mirth instead of the steel grey, as if he was only moments away from laughing at Harry’s discomfort. In another lifetime - if they had been friends - Harry knew that Malfoy would tear him to shreds over  a slip up like this, it made up 87% of his humour with Ron, Dean, Seamus, and Neville in their dorm over the years at Hogwarts.
Potter cleared his throat and Draco nearly jumped out of his skin. He’d been so far inside his own head, spiralling at the thought of
it all was. They usually sat near each other anyway, so this closeness wasn’t too odd, but it had previously been exclusively for bitching purposes only. Now, it was obvious that people thought they’d be wanting to kiss and cuddle and whisper sweet nothings into each other’s ears. Well, Harry found himself wanting to, anyway.

‘Well, of course he can. But what are you talking about?’

‘Family friend? Aren’t they all locked up in Azkaban?’ Obviously not. He cannot just
‘Bored, Potter?’
Stomach rumbling at the thought of (and lack of) a pecan plait, Harry sighed and picked up the shitty instant machine coffee, resolving to himself to make an effort to get in early tomorrow. Pastry and fancy coffee to boot.
Ron, who had taken an unfortunately timed sip of his drink, promptly spat it straight back out again over the table and Harry.
. Draco’s insides twisted. He should’ve known that this would come out eventually, there was no way it could have stayed buried deep inside him forever. It was a miracle it had stayed hidden for as long as it had, but Potter just stayed silently watching him. ‘
‘Malfoy.’ Potter sounded almost cordial. ‘How’ve you been?’
‘Yes! Er- yeah… for records.’ Harry jumped at the chance.

‘So. erm. How’s your week been?’
‘Sorry sir, I just really need to speak to you,’
‘I accept your apology, but you’re not forgiven.’ Sam went to interrupt, his face the perfect picture of the jilted ex-boyfriend, not that they’d even reached that stage, but Harry carried on over him. ‘You hurt me, Sam. I trusted you and you threw that away. I thought you might have been able to see past the lies the
coffee shop was one of Harry’s favourites. It had huge windows that let in all the light, beautiful natural wood table tops, and the best coffee this side of Beauxbatons. The coffee bar itself boasted a white granite top and a black and white checkered tile wall. The shelves were made from the same natural wood as the table tops and were stuffed full of bags of coffee, various loose leaf teas, and an abundance of cups and saucers (none of which matched). There were two espresso coffee machines, pour overs, filters, hot water boilers, all in a wonderful uniform of copper that sparkled out at you, as freshly polished as the day they all arrived. And this is all without mentioning the plants that seemed to cover every single available surface in the whole joint.
‘Erm, yeah. Sure.’
With a messy
Draco slowly turned his steely grey gaze back over to Harry, and Harry tried his best not to cringe away, but Draco just smirked at him. ‘I thought you knew about my pet names for you, sweetheart, or is this just your way of saying you prefer me to call you “sweetheart” over anything else?’
Harry felt his eyes widen into dinner plates. ‘What are you about to say?’
‘Good.’
‘Of course. Love you, mate.’ Draco hung up the phone.
, had he really been that oblivious the whole time? ‘Do you remember the first Christmas I was invited to spend it with you all at the Burrow?’
‘Together? Gods no,’ Patch chuckled. ‘Draco and I are firm friends and that’s all. I love him, but in the way you might love a brother. Besides, I don’t think Draco’s ready for that in his life just yet.’
And with that, Draco stood as quickly as he could (whilst still remaining polite, of course) and tried his very best to not run from the room, but he was certain that he couldn’t have got out of that room faster if he’d apparated. His childhood rival had almost just
just a kick to the teeth.
lots of time covered here - we're jumping forward a few months, I wanted them to have the time to get to know each other & realise they're not as different as they thought so I hope you liked it!
‘Draco Lucius Malfoy, I would love nothing more than to go on a date with you.’ Harry’s grin matched Draco’s, tooth for tooth. ‘I just have one condition.’
The tent was warm and stuffy and smelled of his expensive cologne.  He had no idea what to do now. Did he need to eat? Did Harry? Should he disinfect his wound? Should he check that Harry was really alright? There was a whole list of things he should probably do, but he had no energy for any of them.  His body felt sluggish, and his head, hazy.  The only thing that was keeping him from falling to the ground right then and there was the warmth of Harry’s hand.
Another time he asked about Harry’s childhood.  “Do you remember your parents at all?”
His right hand shaking, he plunged it into the tub.  Trying not to take account of the things that he felt as he grabbed the knife handle and secured it in his grip once more.  He had gone over this act in his head a million times.  He had always accounted for the pain; but he had never accounted for the panic.  It felt like he couldn’t think straight.  Like the bridge between his intentions and his motor functions had been severed completely.  He found it hard to grip the knife properly, to get all his fingers in the right position.  And his vision was getting blurry, distorted.
Draco gulped and inched a little closer to his mum.  He didn’t like the image of the haggard woman in his mind.  “And Cepheus couldn’t heal her?”
human.
“No,” said Harry firmly.
“He didn’t rescue her?”
He had spent his childhood orbiting around his parents and the hereditary traditions of both illustrious families.  He had spent all those years learning to be as couth as a Malfoy and as enigmatic as a Black.  He was the last of both lines, the singular heir to two great magical lineages.  But that felt like so long ago, a distant time, because for many years now Potter had been the focal point of his life.
Both stopped their chatter about the new anti-mudblood laws at once.
“No, I want to hear about Cepheus.”
Draco grabbed his wand from the nightstand and murmured lumos, sending a harsh white light over the scene.
“And were they happy? Did they get another castle?”
Picking up the wand from the grass besides him he raised it slowly, just like the knife.  He winced at the similarities of the gestures, his gaze falling upon his bloody, stumpy fingers.  Despite the cold he felt like his body was slick with sweat, and sullied from blood and cum.  Every bit of him felt dirty and tainted under the pristine light of the moon.
He stood in that hallway for a long time, thinking of his mother, and the little boy he had been when she told him all these stories about their family.  He reached out to touch the plaque.  Had Cepheus held it? Had he been the person to put it here? Had other Blacks found it through the ages? Searching for any evidence of this greatest of all ancestors?
He found that the words came back easily to him.  As if he had been secretly reciting them every day of his life.  And with them came his mother's voice, soft and even, and full of tenderness.
They were both quiet, their faces betraying no emotion, no thought.  It was startling how much they looked like each other at this time, they could be brother and sister.  “Why do you want to find it?” said Narcissa.
, thought Draco with another horrible pang.  “Of course, I suppose I may have overdone myself,” the Dark Lord mused.  “You were never strong, maybe I have performed one cruciatus too many.”
“It would be,” Draco assured him, but he knew it wasn’t safe.
The festivities went on into the night.  Draco stayed close to his mother, her arm lovingly around his shoulder, but in his heart, he was with Harry.  When at last the time came when they could slip away, he told her: “Wait for me at the Manor.”
For a full week they lived inside his room.  This was the longest Draco had ever been confined to such a small place and yet it didn’t feel like this encroached, in any way, on his freedom.  In fact, he really didn’t care.  As long Harry was with him, he was certain he could live in a box if he had to.
He took it with reverence, feeling the light material sliding through his fingers.  Did she know? Did she have some idea of what it was that he was seeking? Was that why she was handing this to him, something that for so long had belonged to the Potters?  However, if this was what she was thinking her face betrayed nothing, it was blank and beautiful like a doll’s.
“I love you so much,” Draco repeated when they broke apart.  “I always did, you know, and I’m so sorry for everything before.”
“No, he says he doesn’t feel anything.”
She pulled him into her arms and kissed each of his cheeks.  “Take care of yourself.”
He had never been in very good physical shape.  Even as a child he had been delicate, and after everything that had happened in the last two years, he was even more so.  Therefore, he moved slowly, carefully, one hand holding the stitch in his side.  When he reached the top of the hill, he stopped to catch his breath.  The mountains around were not as large or impressive as the ones that had surrounded him a few days ago, but he kind of liked that.  He liked the smaller scale of them, and the contrast between the yellowed hills and the powder blue sky above.
Sometimes in the night he even found himself talking to Harry, as if he were a ghost in the room.
When they entered the room she was in, she did not even put up a fight.  She dropped her wand to the floor and raised her hands over her head.  This was unfamiliar to her – she had never surrendered before.
Carelessly, he swished the curtains out of place with his wand so he could stare down at the gardens.  Winter was coming – there was no doubt of this – but the gardens were evergreen.  He could even spot one of the white peacocks wandering about between the shrubbery.  He stayed still, watching the morning light filter in, golden at first, then dim.
Thank you to anyone who made it to end of this very bloody tale
“Oh, he did.  At last, after single handedly defeating an entire Kingdom, he found her secret tower.  He flew up to the window, rejoicing in having found his beloved again.  But do you know what he found Draco?”
The Dark Lord laughed.  “How diplomatic.” Careless, he flicked his wand and more blood came out Harry.
He swept the invisibility cloak proudly over his shoulders and marched out of that cave, his back straight.  He had come here to do something, and it had been done.  Once again, he had been successful, and once again his instincts had been true.  Finding this book had been his destiny.
“Because you’ve filled his head with foolishness,” murmured Lucius under his breath.
It was only then that he began moving the body.   He tried not to look as each arm zoomed out of the grave and into the tub of mandrake juice, making splashing noises as they dropped.  His left leg came next, in two parts, pieces of denim still on it.  His right had fared better, it was the only limb still attached to the torso, but even so it was a mangled, disgusting thing, bits of bone showing among the rotting flesh.
The remains in the tub were no more.  The mangled clothes. The rotting fresh.  The protruding bones.  The wilted, unidentifiable organs.  The dried blood.  The crushed face.  It was all gone.  Instead there was a familiar boy, a familiar face.
The only way to do this properly would be to channel the best of his father.
“Sad?”
There was a lump of regret within him.  Why hadn’t he tried to say something? Try to reassure him?  Why hadn’t he said anything when they were being dragged away? Why hadn't he told him how much he loved him, or how sorry he was that all this had happened?
“No, just in poor spirits-” she pointed to the window.  “It’s winter, it doesn’t agree with him.  He will be quite alright by summer.  I believe he will even rejoin the Dark Lord’s service.  There is no need to worry.”
They screamed in unison, running from the scene.  Disgruntled, he turned back to the problem at hand.  Harry was lying on the floor of the library, covered in blood.  His legs had given way as they walked along the shelves, and he had tumbled down, his legs bent at unnatural angles.
“My son-” Narcissa’s voice brought him back to the room.  “Is a very foolish boy.  But now that you have seen into his heart you know that his motives were not political, they were personal.”
There was no denying that there was something wrong with Harry.
“No, I can’t feel-” his sentence was interrupted when he coughed again, a new splatter of blood coming out of his mouth.
“I am mother,” she spoke the words firmly, as if she were simply stating her title.
His mouth was dry and ached for water but he remained on the floor, determined not to move until he had quite clearly made up his mind.
What would have happened if he had confronted him?  If he had opened up to him?  What would have happened that day in the bathroom?  He turned these thoughts over and over.  Always coming up with alternatives far better than the current reality.
It felt like falling.  Like grasping at shadows.
He watched as the lid of the sarcophagus rose up into the air above.  And then he had to gather his courage again before looking down into the depth of the sarcophagus.  His wand was poorly angled and all he could see was black.  He lowered it, shining its light on the base.
The new silence felt harsh somehow.  Like the eye of the storm.  And the only thing Draco could wish for was death.  He found himself hungering for that emptiness that Harry had described, because he knew he did not want to feel anything ever again.
“Since when did you know that?”
His mother was crouching by Lucius’s body, wearing a silky night gown that reached the floor. “Now!” he yelled again.
The boy shifted, moving ever so slightly towards the sound of his voice.
She was about to make the kill, and Draco knew it.  He turned to look at them again.  “So, is it so wrong for Draco to go in search of it?”
“House elf?”
Her eyes moved to the precise spot where he stood, invisible.  “Yes.” Gently he grabbed her by the forearm.
The noises from the Death Eater grew less enthusiastic.  It was clear that there was no life in Harry anymore, and although Draco did not want to look, he imagined that whatever they had left of his body was no more than the bits he himself had buried the time before.
“I’m tired,” Harry whispered.
Piece by piece he gathered Harry’s body.  The act made him retch until his stomach was empty, and he was simply dry heaving.  Harry was not one form, he was raw ripped limbs, and guts mushy pink and red against the grass.  Even his face was nothing, all his features shattered, great chunks of his hair pulled out, nearly all his teeth knocked out, one of his eyes burst.  He would not have known him.  It looked more like a prehistoric stone carved to resemble a human than a real face.
“I take it that mother talked to you?”
“Because he is a fucking hero,” Draco said out loud, the words bitter and resentful to his own ears.  But there had to be an alteration made. Potter
At these words she paused, staring deep into Draco’s grey eyes, eliciting a question from him: “And where do you find real magic, mum?”
After that he remembered hiding, shuffling about, unsure what he was doing, and what side he was really on.  He had duelled a few people, but only because he had been trying to find his mother. After that he remembered nothing until Voldemort marched back into the castle, with a chained-up Hagrid beside him, Harry’s corpse in his arms.
Yes, this was definitely one of Harry’s favourite places.
‘Make that two.’ Harry smiles at Draco, Draco grins back.
‘Har har,’ Harry deadpanned, louder this time. ‘Bit difficult to do that when I have absolutely no interest in women whatsoever.’
Malfoy Mask back in place, Draco strode into the house, making every effort not to shove his shoulder into Potter’s on the way past.

‘Alright. Thanks for not being a total prick.’ He cleared his throat. ‘Has your employment changed?’
That didn’t stop Teddy from dancing like a loon in front of Malfoy though, and he completed a thoroughly spectacular jump onto the sofa between Harry and Malfoy at the end of the song, giggling the entire time.
But Draco just sat there smirking at him, he knew that if he stayed silent long enough that Potter might just…
was definitely not on the list.
Dazedly, Harry stood and made to follow Andi and Teddy to the door to leave, lost in his own thoughts once again. But before he could make it, he felt a hand on his arm. Turning to look, he saw that not only was it Sam, but that everyone sitting in the cafe was now watching them, unashamedly, with rapt attention.
‘Potter, I know you most likely don’t wish to speak about it, especially to me, of all people, but if there’s anything I can offer that would make you feel even the slightest bit better, then I’m here.’
Obviously seeing his confusion, Draco continued. ‘I thought they might ask you out, idiot! They winked at you? Were you not looking?’
Bloody
‘Ye-’
‘Oh yeah? And how would you possibly know how much he’s changed? You haven’t seen that ferrety face since the trials!’
, she’d said.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at that, they changed from a soft silver to a stormy grey.
Draco was frowning, why was he babbling like this? Did someone slip some Babbling Beverage into his tea? And what did he care if the Chosen One was on a date?
He should probably start cleaning now.
There had been other slight breaks in the haze on Harry’s dates with Sam - dates
‘Not at all, I trust you’re experienced enough to do me properly?’ It was Malfoy’s turn to gulp this time, his eyes widened before schooling themselves back to a neutral.
And then, all at once, they were kissing.
‘Fine, P. Just queasy. Don’t wanna be here.’ Draco tried to smile back at him as he took a sip of his drink, but he didn’t have to look into a mirror to know it was more of a grimace.
Hermione winced at that, ‘I know it wasn’t the best move, Harry, but it all moved so quickly once I’d had the initial idea and mentioned it to Kingsley. It all happened in no time at all and before I knew it Draco was out of Azkaban and on his way to your office!’ she turned to her husband, ‘and I

Although it wasn’t as though he could compare it to himself very fairly; he had, after all, just got out of wizard prison after 3 years. Sure, he’d managed to put back on most of the weight he’d lost - his mother and Mipsy had been hell-bent on feeding him all and any food they could force down his throat since his early release 6 months ago, it was enough for anyone to regain pre-megalomaniac weight. But there was still no way he could compare to the
‘I’ve got a charmed playpen full of toys from Andi set up in the kitchen so he’ll be joining us if that’s alright with you? Merlin knows I’ve had enough lectures from Andi, Molly, and most recently Mione about childcare that I’m smart enough to not just leave him alone.’ Potter chuckled, as if receiving said lectures had been an amusing affair. Draco shuddered, he couldn’t imagine anything worse.
‘Come on, Malfoy. Teddy wants you to stay, I want you to stay. So stay.’ Potter’s green eyes flickered up at him, filled with caution, longing, hope.

before the ink had time to dry.
at that - was a step too far for even a reformed death eater? But the amount of muggle things Malfoy had been getting right on board with lately had been shocking to say the least; something had changed within the blond in the three years he’d been in Azkaban, and Harry didn’t feel afraid to find out what anymore.
"quelle surprise" is generally a sarcastic "what a surprise"
As Potter reached across his desk for some more ink, his sleeve rode up a couple of inches.
‘Y’know, the point of a party isn’t to hide yourself away in a corner the entire time.’

Draco had spotted the bookshop and, like Harry had predictably known he would, dragged Harry inside to look at each and every single book currently in stock. At least that’s what it felt like as Harry followed along behind him, not that he was going to complain.
‘He saved my life a few years ago, that’s why I’m here I guess. So did Mrs Malfoy, actually.’
Grey eyes snapping back up to the figure frozen outside the shop, Draco cursed when he spotted that the figure was gone. Presumably strolling along on his merry way to whichever Merlin-forsaken establishment took his fancy.
‘Well, only when they’re pregnant but you can’t…’
He drew back and looked down at his feet. ‘Sorry, I- I just wanted- I’ve been an idiot.’
Draco had been glancing up every now and then, checking on Potter’s pain levels and topping up the pain-numbing charm on his wrist if and when it was needed after that initial pinch of pain he’d caused, but Potter’s face seemed to be fixed in a state of perpetual panic and confusion. Every so often their eyes would meet, but more often than not the green eyes were fixed solely onto Draco needling a stag into his wrist. It was much more than mildly distracting.
And it was there, watching Harry sodding Potter walk away from the parlour, left wrist wrapped up in protective film, right hand clasping the healing cream, that Draco allowed himself to acknowledge for the first time just how attractive he really was.
Stealing a glance at the blond beside him, Harry smirked at the uneasiness coming off Malfoy in waves. For as much as Malfoy was more open to Muggles and the Muggle world, it was obvious that he had yet to explore much further than the streets around his mother’s house, and the Leaky Cauldron.

Harry was about to tease him some more - or maybe kiss him? But no, that couldn’t be right; Draco was his
It had gone fairly well, they’d made it almost an hour of just walking around aimlessly, chatting about everything and nothing all at the same time, and the way that Draco occasionally bumped shoulders with Harry had set his heart racing.
No no, it was the thought of it being Draco

Unfortunately, seeing Draco is exactly what happened next.

Almost instantly, at least fifteen different ways to make Potter even more uncomfortable flitted through Draco’s mind, each not good enough and yet even more satisfying than the last. Just how far would Draco be able to push Potter before he snapped? Before he saw that familiar fire behind his eyes and those infernal glasses? The fire that had driven him throughout all his years at Hogwarts, and reminded him there was life waiting for him on the other side of Az-
‘He, erm, kissed me?’ Harry’s voice had never been so small - or high, for that matter.
‘Oi, Potter! You’re not too much of a world saviour for me to take you down a peg or two!’
‘You’d better. Alright, see you, then.’
‘Relax, Harry, we’re just teasing. Living vicariously through you is the only option for us now. Live fast and date everyone you can whilst you still can, before you’re wifed up like us two losers here.’
Potter’s cheeks pinked. ‘Erm, well, if you want to I guess? Cub, do you mind if Mister Malfoy joins us?’
With a brief hiatus in Weasley management in the direct aftermath of the fighting whilst George grieved for Fred, the shop came back stronger than ever. Even more so once Ron joined the team with his business qualifications from the Open University and the NEWTs he somehow passed from Hogwarts. It had helped them all immensely when George had stumbled upon a hidden notebook full of half-brained crazy schemes for new inventions that Fred had apparently been working on alongside his inventions with George, and with a few small amendments, the products had exploded into their very own range within the store. Even from beyond the grave, Fred was still helping them out and making sure pranks were being pulled with the utmost finesse. Harry was sure that McGonagall was rueing the tears she’d shed at the funeral with every WWW product she confiscated in the halls of Hogwarts.
