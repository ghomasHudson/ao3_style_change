“Would you mind it with me?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco said, picking up Harry’s still-full wineglass along with his own. “Mother got out the good stationary. The least you could do is listen to what she has to say.”
Harry waited until he was alone to open the book. Hermione’s letter was neatly folded and tucked beneath the cover. With it was a small folded square of parchment, with a small sprig of holly drawn on the front in green ink. Harry opened it and saw three words printed in the centre of the page.
“Nothing,” said Harry. “It’s not important.”
“Yes?”
For day two of 25 Days of Draco & Harry at
“To surviving.”
“Not in the least.” Harry grinned. “I think Kreacher made cookies.” He nodded at the small platter of cookies sitting on the table by the tree.
me. Anyway, I posted yesterday's chapter a little bit ago, so it's there if you'd like to read it tonight! Thank you for reading!
Draco spelled off the lights in the room, and Harry’s eyes drifted shut, and he let Draco’s quiet heartbeat lull him to sleep.
“Draco, we’re at your parents’ house.”
“That’s a bloody lie. You brought two mugs of cocoa.”
“I’ve never really been one for wine,” Harry said, following Draco into the living room. “I haven’t really had a chance to
He could feel his resolve breaking.
“You’re serious,” Harry said. “You actually called me up here to play a game.”
“What?”
“Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the most patient of teachers.” -Charles William Eliot
Draco took a deep breath and sat on a nearby boulder. His body ached, and he was so tired. He sighed and looked to his left. The thestral stood nearby, staring at him. It took him nearly a minute to work out what it was.
that he has done more for the Wizarding World than either of you ever will. Now piss off, and don’t you dare try this again, or I will go to McGonagall and won’t rest until the pair of you are expelled.”
“Absolutely peachy,” Malfoy snapped, grasping his stomach.
Draco looked out again.
There were few things Harry enjoyed more than he enjoyed coffee these days. The problem with being friends, or whatever they were, with Draco was that Draco seemed to run on a schedule opposite Harry’s. Whether they were going to eat or to study, it always seemed to be just minutes after Harry managed to fall asleep.
“I thought I’d go back to my warm and friendly manor and help my mother decorate for the holidays whilst we ignore the fact my father’s rotting away in Azkaban.”
The War had ended seven months ago, and Harry wasn’t sure how to move on. Nobody was sure how to move on. The trials were finished, the castle had been rebuilt, but everything still felt wrong. It was as if someone had moved everything in Harry’s life slightly to the left, and then had pushed him from a cliff.
When their classmates return, Draco resumes sleeping in his own bed. Two nights into the start of term, he feels restless, and wakes to the headache he's learned to associate with Harry. Without stopping to slip on his dressing gown, he bolts from his room. Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Ernie are standing outside of Harry's door, looking worried.
"People died because of me!"Harry said. "They died because I couldn’t just--I couldn’t--"
“This is not the life I wished for you to have,” said Lucius. “Engaged to a Half-blood, working with Muggles, living in a flat in the middle of a Muggle neighbourhood...it’s an embarrassment to our name.”
Harry awoke to the feeling of Draco’s fingers tracing over the scar on his chest. He turned his head away, trying to pretend to still be asleep, but Draco knew him better than that.
“Hm?”
He shouldn’t have come back, not after all that. Hogwarts would never be the same.
“Ah, yes,” he said. “ A sweet tooth doesn’t really fit into the Evil Slytherin stereotype, does it?”
Day twenty three of the 25 days of Draco/Harry Fest!
“How you go back and forth like that. I’ve only ever known English.” The man pushed his glasses up with the side of his hand and grinned up at Draco. “You didn’t have to hang up on your mum like that.”
"I’m sorry," he mumbled against Draco’s shoulder.
“Would you like me to be?” Malfoy leered.
Draco rolled his eyes and followed Harry through the crowd.
Harry laughed quietly. “I guess we did.”
Day Fourteen of the Slythindor100 25 Days of Draco/Harry fest!
Compared to the year before, this December was particularly calm, but Harry still felt restless. He wasn’t accustomed to normal life, and he’d not had much of a break between the end of the war, the trials, and returning to Hogwarts. There hadn’t been time to think about what had happened in that year, and Harry hadn’t wanted to.
“It’s not a problem, Mr. Malfoy,” said McGonagall. “You’re here now.”
Harry flushed, thinking about how close he and Draco had been the night before.
“You’ve never been to Muggle London before,” Harry said, locking the door and walking down his front steps.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m going to kill you,” said Draco. “Right now.”

“I thought you would’ve had enough of all that,” Malfoy said, but he didn’t protest as Harry sat down opposite him.
Harry adds a few marshmallows and drinks. They don't talk, but for the first time in a while, Harry feels kind of alright.
Last night, I was like "lol maybe i'll post earlier tomorrow." ....maybe i'll post earlier tomorrow??? Thank you for reading!

“Okay, Harry,” he murmured to himself. “You can do this.”
“I can nearly see the smoke coming from your ears,” Draco said. “What’re you thinking about?”
“Merry Christmas, Harry,” Draco whispered.
“Harry, look! Look!” Teddy wriggled in Harry’s arms, reaching out towards the large castle built entirely of snow. “A castle!”

the plots of these drabbles aren't related to each other, unless stated otherwise.
He took a deep breath to calm himself and tried again, only to be greeted by an even worse sight.
“Come on,” said Harry, “I’ll walk with you to the hospital wing.”
But phoenixes were more than fire. They were life and death, rebirth and second chances.
Thank you for reading! Two more days! This fest has really flown by!
It was cold and entirely too early to be trekking through the snow. He hadn’t even had time for coffee, thanks to Draco’s forgetting to set some sort of alarm the night before. (Of course, Draco insisted that it was Harry’s fault, which it wasn’t. They both knew not to depend on Harry to set the alarm, because he would forget. He always forgot.)
Draco’s eyes flitted over Harry’s face, his gaze too intense and too personal for such a public setting. Harry couldn’t bring himself to care. Draco knew Harry—he was probably the only one who really did anymore--and if there was anything Harry wanted people to see, it was that.

Harry lay in bed, running his fingers over Malfoy’s handwriting. There were indents in the paper, as if Malfoy had pressed his quill hard against the parchment. He felt like a lovesick girl, and he was wondering how he went from cautiously apathetic of Malfoy to practically besotted over the course of six days.
“We don’t have to do anything, Draco, especially if you don’t want to,” Harry said. “It’s just a Christmas party.”
Harry handed Draco one of the mugs and sat on the couch beside him, letting the warmth of the fire fight the chill away.
“I can’t keep my hands steady, my legs shake so badly they ache, and I just feel exhausted all the time. I can’t fly, I can’t run, I can’t do anything!” Harry gave a bitter laugh. “I guess there are only so many times you can survive the Killing Curse without any side-effects.”
Draco smiled a bit sadly and pressed a kiss to Harry’s jaw. “Would you like to write the response or shall I?”
Hermione looked startled for a moment. “Well, if that’s the case,” she said carefully, putting on a brave smile, “you might as well take the rest of this home with you. You can’t have Christmas without Molly’s baking.”
Professor McGonagall broke off as the door to her office opened and Draco walked in, dragging his trunk behind him.
“You’re getting old, Harry,” Draco teased, lifting the blanket so Harry could sit beside him on the couch. “Practically ancient.”
Harry laughed and faced Draco. “I’ve always been shit at acting,” he said. He pressed a short kiss to Draco’s lips. “Good morning.”
“We’re going to play a game.”
you, Harry.”
“Goodnight,” said Harry, stunned by the feeling of her hand on his shoulder. He heard her shoes on the hard floor and, just before she opened the door, said, “I wanted to see if I could do it.”
Harry spun around, losing his footing on the smooth tile floor and crashing onto his back. He looked up to see Malfoy standing over him, looking vaguely apologetic as he bent to help Harry up.
Thank you for reading! :D
“You’re not allowed to hex me when I step on your feet,” Harry muttered. He didn’t think Draco actually would, but just in case, Harry looked down at his feet when Draco stepped forward.
Title comes from: Carol of the Bells
Harry felt the cool wood of his cane being pressed against his palm. Draco was speaking quickly, Harry could tell by the way his lips moved, but it was as though Harry were watching through a thick pane of glass: he couldn’t hear anything. Panicked, Harry shook his head, and before he knew it, he was being led quickly from the hall.
Harry flushed, grinning.
And then Harry felt like he was choking, and all he could see was the blood and Nagini striking again and again until—
Malfoy handed him a cocoa.
Draco can hear the plea in Harry's voice.
“Harry! I didn’t expect to see you!” Ron pulled Harry into a hug. Harry stumbled slightly, but returned the hug, surprised as he realised just how much he’d missed Ron.

“You can’t know that.”
“Yes,” said Draco proudly. “I am.”
“Language, Draco!” said his mother in his ear.
“Harry didn’t mention it.”
Harry snorted and then gasped.
“A mobile?”
“You’ve never been one to do what anybody asked,” said Harry, pointedly avoiding Malfoy’s gaze as he hastily gathered his things. “I have to go. I’m going to be late to Defence. See you around, Malfoy.”
This is 110% inspired by the fact I unironically watched the Barbie Nutcracker movie the other night. Also I'm a little salty because this chapter is 100 words, but AO3 really wants it to be 103, but I checked on two other word counting sites and they both said 100. ;_; Anyway! Enjoy!!
"I’m okay," Harry murmured, forcing a smile. "I’m fine."
“I never struck you as a person.” Draco reminded Harry. “Besides, I’m doing you a favour.”
“Mind if I join you?”
“Mr. Potter, could I speak with my son for a moment?” Lucius asked, smile still very much in place. “Alone?”
“No,” said Harry, briefly resting his hand on Draco’s forearm. “Stay.”
“I’ve got to send something to Ron and Hermione,” Harry said. “If you don’t mind?”
The lights made Draco glow red and green and blue, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from crossing the room and pulling Draco into his arms. Their lips collided almost painfully, but neither of them seemed to care as they stumbled backwards towards the bed.
“I’ve never been to Muggle anywhere before,” Draco pointed out. “Hence the waiting.”
There were, apparently, only so many times a person would take “we just grew apart” as the reason for breaking up with their sister.
do, aside from helping him adjust.
“We’re going to 12 Grimmauld place,” he said, holding the jar of Floo Powder out to Draco. “I’ll meet you there.”
And through the frosted window, Draco watched the snow fall.
“Thanks,” Harry said, taking the book. “I realised once class started, but I wasn’t really expecting a hand delivery. I would have come to get it myself, if--”
They did have an owl, but Isidora was a temperamental and rather large barn owl. She was a pet, yes, but she wasn’t really a

Draco rested his head on one arm and traced his fingers over the scar that covered the left side of Harry’s chest. It started in the centre, right above his heart, where the Dark Lord’s curse had struck and spread like lightning over Harry’s skin.

“There’s an idea,” said Draco suddenly. Harry gawked at him.
“The house looks pretty decorated to me,” said Harry.
"We wouldn’t dream of missing it," Harry said.
“Besides,” Draco said, “I haven’t seen any mistletoe around yet. It could all be in this room.”
Harry sighed. "I don’t want to go back down."

Day seven of the Slythindor100 25 days of Harry/Draco fest!
“You look like someone shot your dog.”
“Not convincing," Draco reminded gently.
When Draco reaches him, Harry collapses into the other boy's arms.
I'm being melodramatic, but thank you for reading.
Draco skates. Harry watches.
Thank you for reading!
Harry shrugged. “I don’t think so, and I’m getting less and less hopeful that I will. The healers don’t know what’s going on, but they’re able to help a bit with the pain.”
"Don't call me that, Draco."
One more day to go!
"Harry," murmurs Draco, the only one brave enough to rest his hand on Harry's arm. “You’re safe.”
Draco grinned.
The boys staggered back, surprised to see Harry, but furious all the same.
“Harry, you defeated the Dark Lord, you fought off a basilisk at the age of twelve. Surely, my parents aren’t nearly as bad as all that.”
Harry shrugged. “I guess we’re alright with each other.”
“Shit! Mother, I’ll have to call you back in a moment,” Draco said quickly, remembering that he was, in fact, in the middle of a long-distance call on a payphone. “Tell father I said hello.”
Draco watches Harry mechanically open his gifts, sees  the grief cross Harry's face when he holds up a soft-looking green sweater, and sees the confusion when he opens Draco's gift to him to find a generous amount of Dreamless Sleep Potion.
“I thought I’d come by to say hello to Myrtle,” Harry said, gripping the sink with one hand and rubbing what was going to become a painful lump on the back of his head with the other.
“All the more reason to enjoy it!” Draco shot a grin over his shoulder, and Harry knew in that moment exactly what he was going to do.
And that's that! Thank you everyone for reading and commenting! I hope you all had a Merry Christmas, or a great Monday if you don't celebrate!
“It does. I’m not going to force you to stay a week at my parents’, especially for Christmas, if you don’t want to. My god, I can’t even imagine the whining.”
Harry kicked Draco gently beneath the covers. “Fine. This went much better than I thought it would.”
The Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Godric’s Hollow was something Harry had tried to attend in the past three years since the end of the War. That first Christmas had been so hard for everyone it hadn’t really felt like Christmas.

Harry and Draco spend an afternoon together in Hogsmeade.

Is it okay to call plum pudding a cake? We don't have it here. Also, I nearly forgot the prompt. I hope you enjoyed! <3
He wasn’t too keen on admitting that last bit, but the fiasco with the letter had forced his hand. (He wished he could say that Hermione had been wrong in saying that he had an obsession with Malfoy, but even he couldn’t convince himself of that anymore.)
Harry knows he's being selfish when he freezes up outside of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because that's where he'd spent the most time with Remus; when he refuses to go to the library, because all he can see is Hermione and that triumphant look she always got when studying; refuses to play quidditch or even to glance at Ginny because all he can see is Ron and Fred and Molly's pain. He's used to pain, used to having the people he loves and needs torn away from him.
It’s the swoop in Harry’s stomach, the rush he gets when he sees Draco smile at him from across the room, or up from where his head rests against Harry’s chest. It’s the joy of knowing that smile, the private smile that makes the corners of Draco’s eyes wrinkle
"What's going on?" Draco asks, even though he can feel the heat pouring from the room. In that moment, he doesn't care what's going on; getting to Harry is the only thing on his mind as he pushes open the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry took a sip and then shrugged.
that was sitting at his elbow. It seemed harmless, sitting there on the desk. He looked back at Malfoy.
Lucius Malfoy’s smooth voice cut through the room, making both Draco and Harry jump. As usual, Draco was the first to recover.
“My mother figured you wouldn’t want to be portkeyed into a place that holds so many upsetting memories. The mind can do strange things, and she probably didn’t want to risk it,” Draco said.
“We’re, uh, seeing the sights,” Harry said. “Draco’s never seen Muggle London, so I thought I’d show him.”
“I mean my mother wants us to get out the decorations.”
The next hour of Harry’s life was full of heartfelt thanks for things he hadn’t done and uncomfortable encounters with people who just wanted to say they’d met him. Uncomfortable, Harry could handle.
“Then why doesn’t he come when I invite him?” asked Harry, not caring at all if it was a little bit petulant.
He hesitates before he goes through his death. What happened at King’s Cross was kind of private, but so was the snitch.
Harry opened his eyes and tried to focus on Draco, on his grey eyes and his slightly pointed nose, but the memories pushed forth, images flashing through Harry’s mind.
Harry stays at Hogwarts for Christmas.
As he speaks, it occurs to him that he probably wouldn't have told Ron and Hermione. He wouldn't have been able to deal with their concern, their sadness. Draco has gone from hating Harry to protecting him. He's asked to hear the story. He wants to know. Ron and Hermione wouldn't have asked. They wouldn't have wanted to know.
Harry smiled across the table, taking in the way the candles on the table made Draco’s eyes glimmer.
It was so, so silent.
You melodramatic fool.
Harry is pacing when Draco finally shows up. There are scorched practice dummies scattered around the room, and Draco has to pretend he's not terrified of Harry in that moment. He just closes the door and waits quietly.
Harry nodded and desperately hoped she was right.
Draco went very quiet, and for a horrifying moment, Harry thought he might burst into tears. Instead, he picked up a cookie and bit into it, a small smile on his face.
Harry looked up from the letter Hermione had sent him to see, to no surprise, Malfoy in front of him.
“This is going to be some shit pun, isn’t it?” he asked. “Shall I read it aloud?”
“I agreed to come here, didn’t I?”
“I’m sure you’re clever enough to figure it out,” Malfoy said, pulling his hand away from Harry, who was left to wonder why the room suddenly felt so warm.
“It’s a telephone booth. What else would I be doing in here?” Draco considered this for a moment. “Other than hiding. Why
Harry’s voice cracked on the last word, and he realised then that he’d been shouting. Draco looked stricken, like he hadn’t actually expected Harry to respond to his provocations and wasn’t sure what to do next.
“I meant a real pet.” Harry paused. “Something cuddly…like a puppy.”
It took Harry a moment to catch up, but when he did, he flushed.
Draco frowned. “That’s highly impractical.”
“You’ve been working so hard all day,” Harry said, leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Take a break.”
"Want to give it a try, then?" asked Harry.
“Given the year we’ve all had, I’m not sure that’s actually possible.”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked.
Draco ran his fingers over the silver ring on his right hand. Then, he slipped it off and held it out to his father. “Not you, father; simply the ideas that have poisoned this family for generations.”
bewildered, Pot—Harry."
“I suppose it must be, if Hermione’s calling me out on it,” said Harry. “Worrying about dying from year to year didn’t really give me a lot of time to figure out my romantic interests, I guess. Is that okay?”
everyone who showed me the even slightest bit of caring."
The walk to the Astronomy Tower felt unending. Harry wasn’t sure if it was his cane, or if it was the dread of returning to the place he hadn’t been since sixth year. Regardless, he made it to the tower just as the clock struck midnight. He took a deep breath and began his ascent.
“You’ve already gone and fallen for him, haven’t you.”
“I was so afraid I was going to be like him, that I was going to hurt people because I could, because I
“You said a week!”
“You never struck me as a morning person,” Harry grumbled, pulling his cloak tighter around himself and clutching almost desperately to his coffee.
Harry closed his eyes, inhaled, and then quietly said, “I remember, during the war, Hermione and I didn’t even know it was Christmas until we got to Godric’s Hollow. They were singing in the church, and I could see the candles through the window …" Harry paused. "Looking back, I feel like I should have been sad, but I think I felt…relieved, in a way.”

travelling by Floo—before he had an armful of three year old. He hugged Teddy close to his chest and noticed his hair was incredibly similar to Harry’s own.

It started over his heart, and then, like forks of lightning, branched out to cover the skin of his chest, stopping just below his chin.
"You know what the worst part of it all is? I wasn’t even surprised when I found out Dumbledore had planned it all from the very beginning. I wasn’t surprised that I was stupid enough not to notice it. Nobody else had, after all."
Thank you, as always, for reading! These little drabbles are a very welcome break from writing my research methodology!
Draco doubts Muggle engineering.
“No, thank you. Those have never worked very well on me.” Harry picked at a loose thread hanging from the hem of his shirt. “I just walk around until I get tired enough to fall asleep…”
Harry rolled his eyes.
Keep me in your thoughts. My stats final is due tomorrow. Also, I am frequently confused by mince pies. I looked up a recipe and it called for mincemeat, but then I looked up mincemeat and it said that there’s only sometimes meat in it???
“Don’t worry, I’m sure Hermione will explain later.”
He paused, taking in the scene before him. The lights in the living room were off, and everything was bathed in the dim glow coming from the Christmas tree. There were two glasses and a small, neatly wrapped box sitting on the coffee table in front of Harry, who was smiling shyly.
Draco was silent for a long moment, then: “My mother and I once stumbled upon a herd of unicorn. It’s the happiest I’ve ever felt.”
Hi hello, I've caught a cold. My mind is not cooperating. I fear I shan't live til morning.
Draco inhales sharply when Harry tells him what his mother had done. If Harry focuses, he can remember the feel of her fingers on his face, on his chest as she'd checked his pulse. He can hear the longing in her voice as she asks of her son.
Draco stared down at the plate, then looked back at Harry. “How did you--?”
“She’s in France.” Draco pushed his hair out of his face and grimaced apologetically at Harry. “I’d love to spend Christmas with you, Harry.”
“You probably could,” Draco said, “but if not, you do always have the option to rap them with your cane. Or, an even better idea, hex them.”
It’s in the middle of Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry feels the pressure building behind his eyes. His magic bursts from him, uprooting tables and parchment like they are little more than leaves in the wind.
“Fine,” Harry said quickly. “I was going to wait until later, but I thought maybe you’d appreciate it more if we didn’t do this in front of a bunch of people, so you can feel free to refuse without feeling pressured.”
“I know you eat treacle tart like it’s bloody going out of style, so I opted for a sweeter red.” Draco poured the wine. “It’s practically fruit juice at this point.”
“To surviving,” he said. Draco gave a small smile.
“Doing some light reading, are we?”
Draco wasn’t meant to like phoenixes. He wasn’t meant to like any fire at all, because fire melted ice, turned it to water, made it unsteady. Draco’s father would call it weak.
Thank you for reading! I was in a foul mood last night, so I figured it'd be better to just post late instead of forcing myself to write something. I hope you're all doing well! And thank you for the comments! <3
“And getting older every day,” Harry responded, grinning as he pressed play.
Woo!! I forgot how to count and thought this was day 14!!! Thank you for reading!
"Do you want me to leave?"
“Your turn to ask, then,” Malfoy said.

Harry shrugged. “They invited us to their Christmas party.”

open the book. It was a very small chance, but it was there. Though, the last time Malfoy had ended up with somebody else’s mail tucked into book, Harry had nearly been expelled for smuggling a dragon.
Harry rolled his eyes at the ceiling, but followed Draco up more stairs than Harry even realised the Manor had.
(See the end of the chapter for
Freedom is moving past their roles, their Houses, their pasts. Everyone expects Harry Potter, Killer of Voldemort; Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World; Harry Potter, the Hero. Freedom is forgetting past expectations. Harry Potter is someone Harry’s never been, has never wanted to be, and never will be. But when Harry goes home, sees Draco asleep on their sofa after a long day at work, Harry knows this is freedom. Freedom is knowing Draco loves Harry more than he’s ever loved Harry Potter.
It was difficult to convince the people around them that Draco was from another country, with his distinctly English accent.
The Room of Requirement holds memories for both of them.
“I’m not allowed. You should know that, considering you’re the only reason I’m here instead of under house arrest, or in Azkaban.”
Draco tucked his hair behind his ear, hoping the flush in his cheeks wasn’t as noticeable as it felt. He opened his mouth, but didn’t have a chance to utter a word before the door to the telephone booth was yanked open. Both Draco and the stranger turned to see the woman from earlier--Hermione, Draco’s mind provided--glowering at the pair of them.
“I doubt it.”
“And this is my grandfather on my mother’s side, Cygnus Black III,” Draco said, tapping his finger against the beautifully embroidered tapestry. It was loads nicer than the Black Family Tapestry had been, but Harry wasn’t sure if that was due to care or money.
“Do you?”

“Do I have to do that twirly wafty thing?” Harry asked.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but the words wouldn’t come. He let Draco pull him into his arms and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, breathing in the smell of Draco’s cologne and the drizzle that had managed to soak them both.
"Everyone keeps calling me brave, like walking into the forest was some great adventure, like I was anything more than Dumbledore’s puppet!" Harry slumped against the stone behind him, thoroughly exhausted. "I almost didn’t come back," he murmured.
“Okay, so I think this turned out alright,” Harry said, levitating two plates onto the dining room table. “It doesn’t look too pretty, but it should taste good enough.”
"Harry."
"You were a child who was forced to face situations nobody should have to endure," he said.

But now, Draco was here, and all Harry could think about was the way he’d looked that night in the Room of Requirement, or in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. Harry couldn’t forget the fear in Draco’s eyes that night in the Astronomy Tower.
It was like he’d fallen ten years into the past. The portraits of the former Headmasters were still hanging, and Harry suspected the majority of them were simply pretending to be asleep. Unable to stop himself, Harry allowed his eyes to travel down the rows of portraits until he found the two he least wanted to see.
“I used to be,” said Harry, looking down and tracing the patterns in the wood with his finger. “In fifth year, he was--we had a connection, through my scar and--”
“The letters come in gold, actually. Invitations come in silver.”
Quick reminder that
Harry feels like he did during fifth year, like he did every time Dumbledore ignored him, or someone accused him of being a liar. He feels like he did after Sirius had fallen through the veil and Dumbledore just sat at his desk looking sadder and older than Harry had ever seen him. Draco conjures a shield as the dummies explode and the Room creates more to be destroyed.
Harry drummed his fingers on the tabletop as he waited for Hermione to return, and she did, carrying a pudding that was entirely too big for two people--assuming one of those people wasn’t Ron. She cut him a slice and set it in front of him before doing the same for herself. They ate in silence until Harry decided to speak.
"That doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to ask for help." Draco handed Harry his cane, a beautifully crafted thing made of hawthorn with a curved handle made of holly. Harry took it, finding comfort in the way the smooth handle fit in his hand, and let Draco lead the way down to the fireplace.
Draco nodded and straightened his posture as Harry plastered on a vaguely panicked smile.
“If you make us cocoa, I’ll be finished by the time you get back,” he said. “Without magic.”
Draco sighed and kissed Harry.
“You’re not afraid of becoming like the Dark Lord?”
"Yes. Sorry, mother," he said. He waited a moment before allowing his thoughts to wander again.
Draco went very, very still.
“Come on, then,” said Harry. “Let’s go to the shops. I went once with the Dursleys and saw a tree made entirely of wine bottles.”
Day three!

Draco moved to stand behind Harry and grasped his right wrist. Harry tried to pull his hand away, confused, and turned slightly to ask Draco what he was doing, but Draco just gave him a small smile.
Harry snorted and pressed his hand against Draco’s back to urge him forward.
Wow, this is
"My mother…she made her choice, she knew what would happen if the Dark Lord figured out she'd lied. None of us blame you. We all made our choices."
“I’m going to help you,” Draco said after a moment. He stood and waited until Harry did the same.
“What? Oh, yes,” Andromeda said, cheer back just as quickly as it’d gone. “It’s nearly ready. Would either of you like something to drink while we wait?”
“Don’t get mad at me if he turns you into a slug, then.”
Silence fell between them for a long moment, then Hermione placed her hand over Harry's.
“Sorry,” he said quietly. “That was...something I hadn’t considered.”

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean-- I just--”
“I’m fine,” Harry said. “Just…I probably should have had less to drink last night.”
“Not to mention it’s considered incredibly bad manners to portkey right into somebody’s house,” Draco added. “And it doesn’t matter anyway. We’re nearly there.”
," Harry mumbled as Draco straightened his robes. "I’m shit at those charms, anyway. You know that."
After the Final Battle, he’d slept nearly three days straight, eaten something, and then slept for a few more days. When he’d finally awoken, his chest burned, every step felt like a thousand, and his hands wouldn’t stop trembling. At the time, he’d chalked it up to exhaustion. A month later, he wasn’t so sure.
“What happened in the forest?”
The words turned Harry’s grief into white hot rage, because that’s what nobody understood. It wasn’t bravery. It was manipulation, betrayal in the highest sense of the word. Harry had looked up to Dumbledore, had trusted him to keep him safe the way nobody else in his life had ever bothered to do. Year after year, Harry had fought, wondering if he’d live to see the next
"I never said I wasn’t afraid," Harry said earnestly. "I thought that walk through the forest was going to be the last walk I ever took. I thought the last thing I was ever going to see was Voldemort and his Death Eaters and that green light. That was the scariest thing I ever had to do, but the idea of losing one more person I loved was so much worse than death.
“Do you want to go?”
Harry is a clingy drunk.
Twenty minutes and a lot of bickering later, Harry managed to get Draco into a pair of black trousers and a dark blue jumper.
“Is it going to be that lengthy of a conversation?” asked Harry. “Do you want to visit your parents for Christmas?”
Harry sat beside her in front of the fire and crossed his legs. He felt strangely underdressed, sitting there in his flannel pyjama bottoms and his ratty t-shirt. He had the feeling he’d feel just as underdressed in a three-piece suit, but that was neither here nor there.

He remembers Narcissa Malfoy whispering
A pillow soared across the room and hit Harry squarely in the face. “Don’t be daft. I was talking about a pygmy puff. Does Weasley still sell them?”
Draco, the lone Slytherin, identifiable by the crest on his robes and the stripes on his tie.
“Is she the bl--the girl with the hair?” Draco asked.
Harry sits atop the Astronomy Tower and just stares. He stares out over the grounds and tries not to remember. If he closes his eyes, he can see Snape pointing his wand and whispering, on Dumbledore's orders,
Lucius took the ring between two fingers, hand shaking. He laughed bitterly and he looked down at it in the palm of his hand. “I suppose you’re not your father’s son after all.”
"I’m not a child! Stop scolding me!" Harry flinched at the feeling of Draco’s hand on his shoulder, but finally found the courage to look him in the eye.

So I posted ch 11 earlier and then decided I didn't like it, so this is technically a rewrite...
I hope you enjoyed! Thank you for reading! Also, I took some ~artistic liberty~ with the prompt photo. I am aware that the plant on the card in the picture isn't holly, but mistletoe. It just didn't work with the plot.

This was going to be slightly different, but I suppose that'll have to wait until a later part, because I am bad at managing my time. Also, finals week(s). Thank you for reading! :D
Their shoes crunched quietly in the snow as Harry led the way to his parents’ graves. Neither of them spoke as Harry conjured a wreath of Christmas roses and rested it on the ground. He straightened and cleared his throat, brushing his snowy hands on his trousers. He smiled weakly.
“Get your bloody jarvey to do it!”
Day sixteen of the 25 days of H/D at Slythindor100!
The walk to the Great Hall was slow and silent, save for the quiet tapping of Harry’s cane. Though they weren’t touching, Draco was close enough that Harry could smell his cologne, something sweet and strong and grounding all at once. It wasn’t until they were at the top of the staircase leading into the entry hall that Draco grasped Harry’s hand, adjusting his hold to surreptitiously help Harry down the stairs.
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. “At this rate, we’re going to end up with either a pygmy puff or a blast-ended skrewt.”
Harry paused, wondering when speaking civilly with Malfoy twice in one week became something that felt almost
Day twenty-two of the 25 days of H/D fest!
Draco ran his hand over Harry’s chest and down the flat pane of his stomach. Harry’s breath caught, and Draco grinned.
Harry wanted to point out that it was very difficult to focus on

“I don’t think you’ve got enough sickles, Malfoy,” Harry said, sliding the letter into one of his books. “Are you following me?”
Draco shivered slightly as he slid the cool, silver ring onto his finger. He hated this ring and how it made him feel like the scared little boy who would do anything to make his father proud. His fists clenched and suddenly all he knew was the regret and the hatred and the fear that threatened every moment to swallow him whole.
The Malfoys were ice, in appearance and in manner. They’d worked for generations to be seen that way. It was clear from an early age that Draco was meant to be carved from ice, just like his parents and every person that came before them.
“I can,” Draco said with a small smile.
He focused on the curve of the wreath, and the sweet, strong scent of the roses and the sharp pine. He could feel Draco’s warmth through the fabric of his cloak, and felt Draco’s hand gripping his, guiding it smoothly and steadily through the wand movements.

Nodding tightly, Harry turned away from Snape’s glare.
As he tried to back away and turn to run at the same time in shin-deep snow, Harry stumbled, falling forward into the freezing powder. He scrambled to his feet, just in time for Draco to throw another snowball.
Harry pulls his wand and turns, pointing it at the other boy's throat before he can stop himself. The fear in Draco's eyes is anything but comforting. Slowly, Harry lowers his wand.
Draco shrugs.

"I wasn’t going to say that!"
Draco reached into the bag and pulled out a telephone booth keychain. He held it up, then frowned at Harry.

There were days Draco wasn’t okay, days where guilt and sorrow crashed into him like the tail of a dragon, coming from nowhere, but hurting all the same. They were days he’d sit quietly, wrapping himself in layers of icy steel and anything that could protect himself from the dragon threatening to burn him alive from the inside.
“She’s going to kill me.”
Draco snorted and waved his wand to light the candles on the table. He set his wand aside and picked up his utensils. Harry watched nervously as Draco cut into the fish on his plate and took a bite.
(See the end of the chapter for
Without speaking, Draco pulled Harry into his arms, fighting the urge to cry.
“You’re staring at me, Harry,” Draco said without looking away from where he was neatly cutting his dinner.
Ron’s eyebrows nearly disappeared into his hair. “Draco?”
“Please get rid of all those garish red baubles before I ever step back into that house.”
Almost every surface was covered in fairy lights, and Draco was standing in the middle of the room, looking particularly pleased with himself.

Draco hadn’t worn the ring since the end of the War. He stared down at it, heavy and cold in his palm. He hated it.
She held out the pot of Floo Powder. Harry shrunk his trunk and shoved it deep into his pocket before taking a handful of powder.
"Are you okay?" he asked.
“Harry?”
He averted his gaze, staring out over the grounds once more. He shivered. He’d completely forgotten the rain. It didn’t feel like rain.
One more day! Thank you for reading!! :D
Malfoy shrugged and took a careful sip of his own drink.
The cracker came apart with a bang and a cloud of smoke. Harry fanned it away and reached into the cylinder to find only a scrap of parchment.
“Would you like me to carry you down?” Draco asked sarcastically. “Honestly, it’d be easier than listening to you whine the entire way.”
He hated the way it looked, the way it felt, and everything it stood for. He wanted to throw it, wanted to bury it in a hole so deep it would never be found. But he couldn’t, because everything he hated about that ring, everything it stood for, had been part of him once.
“It’s been too long,” he said, and was surprised when she pulled away and slapped him hard on the shoulder.
Harry scowled up at Draco and wordlessly handed him the letter he held. Taking it, Draco read the letter quickly and then sat beside Harry on the stairs.
“If I’m perfectly honest, it scares the shit out of me. That’s why I need to learn about it.”
“Yes,” said Draco, cutting Harry off midsentence.
Harry took in the dark colour of the wardrobe and the bed frame, and the silver colour of the duvet. Then, his eyes travelled to the chandelier.

There were few things Harry hated more about the holidays than mistletoe. His knowledge of the castle’s secret passages had helped him in the past, but they were all still blocked off from the year before. This meant that Harry instead had to concentrate very hard on not walking too close to anybody, lest he find himself in a situation he would much rather avoid.
from the beginning. He’d sent Harry to his death on a guess, and he’d had the audacity to laugh about it as if sending a seventeen year old to die was as simple a decision as throwing an extra ingredient into a recipe. Dumbledore hadn’t cared about Harry any more than he’d cared about Snape. They were tools, pieces on a chessboard only Dumbledore could see.
“You’re hopeless at this, Potter,” Draco said, helping Harry to his feet.

Harry managed to huff out a laugh. He handed the ticket back to Draco.“I’m going to start dinner. I’ll call you when it’s ready.”
“No, she’s not,” Harry said calmly. “She’s not going to be in her office anyway, so you’ll be safe enough.”
He dreams he'd answered no, and wakes violently.
“I know you wouldn’t, but I’m still going to be wary. I can’t really outrun anyone.”
“Your dinner’s getting cold.”
Except...
After the Final Battle, after the anger, the fear, and the
“Draco, you know it’s impolite to speak  ill of the dead.”
“White roses,” he said. “Honestly, I don’t think this is going to help.”
Harry turned to see Ron walking towards him, frowning slightly at Draco’s presence. Beside Harry, Draco stiffened.
“It’s the Christmas spirit.” Harry grinned.
It was always the same, that swooping feeling in his stomach at the first glance of the tree. The tree was always gigantic--the Dursleys wouldn’t be seen with anything but the absolute best, after all--towering over him in a way that should have been terrifying, but just filled him with a wonderful feeling, like he’d sipped something fizzy. He’d take in the lights that somehow managed to make even the Dursleys’ house feel just a little bit magical. He’d breathe, slow and deep, letting his eyes drift closed as the scent enveloped him. And then, he’d sit, staring up at the lights and the ornaments, and for a while, everything would feel okay.
"Draco, are you listening?"
Okay, maybe snowing sideways wasn't the prompt, but I saw that pic, and my midwesterner heart was like "Oh god." Thank you to everyone who read yesterday! It was a thrill to read the comments this morning. I don't know if I'll be able to respond to all of them, but I will when I can!
Draco helps Mrs. Weasley with some baking.
Harry doesn’t respond. He stands up and goes to bed. He doesn't mean to sleep, but when he awakes screaming to the image of Hermione's werewolf mangled body, he doesn't allow himself to sleep for three days.
“Because her fire place is the only one that’s connected to the Floo Network,” said Harry.
“You’re not really selling me on this whole ‘home cooked meal’ thing.” Draco unfolded his napkin and laid it on his lap. Harry sat down and did the same.
“I’m not whining. I’m threatening,” Harry said frankly. “There’s a difference.”
He glanced around to be sure nobody was coming, and then pushed the door open and slipped inside.
“Yet this is the first time I’ve walked in on you setting fires.”
“That’s three questions, Malfoy.” Harry tapped his fingers on his knees as he thought of a question. “This isn’t fair. You had time to prepare something.”
He could still hear Neville’s promise that they would all keep fighting, could still see Ginny hugging that young girl to her chest and promising her it would all be okay soon.
He hung up and returned to scowling down at the man beside him.

“That’s not nearly as terrifying,” said Harry, releasing a breath he hadn’t even realised he’d been holding. He picked up Teddy’s gift and finished wrapping it before setting it aside.
“Whichever you want.”
“Have they?” Draco asked, crossing his arms over his chest. Harry didn’t miss the smile on his face. He snorted.
The four houses of Hogwarts have changed, for the Eighth Years. Only a few of them returned, so there was no need to separate them by house, even if there’s  too much tension between the four Gryffindors, Ernie Macmillan, and Draco for them to enjoy each other's company.
grin he always got when he knew he’d won an argument. At least it wasn’t an expression Draco had to see very often.
He had told him, but Harry wasn’t about to admit that. He hadn’t even asked for a hangover potion that morning, a decision he was beginning to regret.
“If you don’t speak, I’m going to have to start asking you questions. We have two more floors to go.”
“Yeah, sorry,” said the man, not sounding particularly sorry at all. “‘M hiding.”

“Yes,” he said. “She’s the Black girl with the hair.” He pushed his glasses up again. “Is she still there?”
“Okay?” asked Draco, turning down a long hallway.
“It helps to say it aloud.”
“You both look exhausted,” she said, stepping back and smoothing her hands down her robes. “Have you eaten? I’ll have one of the house-elves bring you something to eat.”
“We should get a pet,” said Harry, breaking the comfortable quiet of the room. Draco looked over at him from where he sat on the couch, a stack of essays in his lap, waiting to be marked.
“It’s low enough that I can hide it with a collared shirt,” said Harry. “But I’ve never liked those.”
"Professor McGonagall," Harry said in greeting, relaxing slightly when Draco rested his hand against his lower back.
Draco set two wine glasses on the coffee table and opened the bottle of wine.
He found her by accident.
Not to mention how he knew Ron and Hermione, and everyone else, were bound to react.
Harry made a frustrated sound and pushed away Draco’s fretting hands. "I’m not a child," he snapped.
"Draco, stop--we should get back--"
“When you’re the one destined to kill a maniac, people tend to turn a blind eye when you break the rules.”

Ginny had, for the first time in months, spoken to him to invite him to the Burrow. Harry hadn't looked at her, hadn't looked up until she'd sighed softly and left. Draco stays behind as well, unsure if it's because he doesn't want to go to the Manor, or if he's doing it to look after Harry.
“I’ll see you on the other side,” Harry said, stepping into the fireplace. “Grimmauld Place!”
Harry didn’t stop until Draco began to push up his shirt.
"I should’ve known you’d be up here panicking," Draco said, fastening Harry’s cufflinks with ease.

“I’d rather—“
"I hate this place," Draco said suddenly, moving to stand beside Harry. Harry looked over at him, but Draco kept his gaze forward. Harry looked away.
“Do you spend a lot of time in the girl’s lavatory?”
Thank you so much for reading this! Thank you if you followed from day one, or if you just found this in like July 2022 and thought you'd read some Christmas fic. I had a lot of fun writing this, and it was so nice to have something normal to do this year. I hope you're all doing well! Merry Christmas!
Malfoy was sat at the base of the wall, with two mugs and a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. Harry closed the door behind himself and, with some difficulty, sat beside him on the floor.
"Harry, if you apologise again, I will burn every single one of those horrible argyle socks you keep buying."
“Your parents have invited us over for Christmas.”
“You boys certainly took your time getting here!” she said, pulling away to wrap her arms around Draco. “I thought Teddy was going to lose his mind waiting for you two! I’ve already had to hide the Christmas crackers from him. Remind me to thank Ronald for teaching Teddy how to use those last year.” She rolled her eyes.
“Why? You sound relaxed enough for the both of us!” Harry’s eyes dropped back down to their feet.
Harry pressed a hand gently against Draco’s back. “We have to find you something else to wear.”
Nearly there was an understatement, thought Harry a moment later, after they turned a corner and came face to face with Malfoy Manor. He stopped, staring for a moment, before he spoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione didn’t bother responding to that. Instead, she pulled Harry away from the stalls and the crowd.
“Wait,” he said.
Harry felt his stomach drop. He knew it was coming. He hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione what had happened in the forest, and he wasn’t sure he ever would. That was his moment to keep forever.
Harry pulled a book from the shelf and added it to the stack that was levitating before him. He double checked the titles and then made his way to his favourite table by the fireplace and its warmth, only to find that it was already occupied.
"You’re lying."
Finally, Harry raised his gaze, stumbling as he did so. Draco was kind enough not to wince too obviously when Harry trod on his foot.
“That’s technically two questions, Malfoy,” Harry pointed out. At Malfoy’s scowl, he answered. “It’s not out of pity. I guess now that neither of us can be bothered to fight, we actually have some stuff in common. I know you won’t just give me worried looks about things I can’t help.”
“I know you’re awake,” Draco said quietly, still stroking.
Harry and Ron stood together at the stove, chatting quietly to each other as Harry finished preparing their meal.
Thank you for reading! I'm traveling today, so this is up a bit earlier than usual for me. Also, LOVE the prompt today. I love it when ice does this, assuming I don't have to go outside.
Draco knew he was flushing, and he knew Harry was grinning that
Most of all, for Harry, loving Draco is freedom.
“I...I guess? Am I asking or answering?”
“Oh shit,” said the man. “I didn’t realise you were on the phone.”
In my head, Draco fears Mrs. Weasley's wrath more than he loves Harry. It's close, but she's very scary. 😂 Thank you for reading!
“I think we’re a bit past you lecturing me on my manners, father.”
“Are you sure it’s alright I come?” Draco asked, anxiously twisting his scarf in his hands. “I mean, everyone’s always thrilled to see you, but there’s a reason I’m working at a Muggle school.”
“Yeah, I suppose so,” Draco responded sarcastically. “Usually, the limit is one and the side-effect is death.”
Surprisingly, Draco laughed at that and, taking his hand from Harry’s, lifted Harry’s chin. “You need to relax and you need to
“Well, we had yesterday morning to ourselves,” Draco said, a smirk playing on his lips. “It’s not my fault that you weren’t very quiet.”
Draco grimaced, but nodded, offering Harry his arm.
“Tonight’s going to go perfectly,” he said soothingly, “but we really do need to leave now if we don’t want to be late.”
Narcissa Malfoy was wearing colours and a smile, two things Harry never thought he’d see her wearing. She pulled her son into a tight hug, murmuring something into his shoulder that made Draco laugh. Harry stood beside the door, watching the scene before him.
Harry dropped onto the couch beside Draco, who scowled as his notebook was jostled.
“It’ll be good,” Harry said. “Just...not pretty.”
"I don't blame you, Harry."
“I didn’t realise you felt so strongly against me,” said Lucius, looking away.
I'm home! This is partially inspired by the fact my girlfriend's family very much likes to dress their cats up. (They also look a lot like the ones in the pic.) Happy reading!
“Good morning.”
True to his word, Draco had put away his potions work by the time Harry returned to the room. There was a fire in the fireplace— it was early November, and Harry knew he wasn’t the only one who could feel the draft in the house.
“I wouldn’t have offered if I did,” Draco murmured. "Your wine is beside the sink."
Lucius waited for the sound of the door closing before he went to stand beside his son. They stood together, neither one speaking, staring at the tapestry.
"Did I hurt anybody?"
“Honestly, I don’t understand why you’ve made me change into these clothes.” Draco pulled at his jumper.
Malfoy ignored him. “I thought we should get to know each other,” he said. “So each of us is going to take turns asking a question. The other is welcome not to answer it, but must then reach blindly into this bag of Every Flavour Beans.”
“You’ll thank me soon enough, after you have the plum pudding Hagrid made you,” Draco said. “Watch your step here, it’s icy.”
“It’s been months since any of us other than Hermione from heard from you!” Ginny said angrily. “You couldn’t even send a post card?”
Draco set his glass aside and picked up the box. He could guess what was inside—there were few things that involved being asked something in front of a crowd. Smiling slightly at Harry, he carefully tore the paper from the box and opened it.
“So what are we going to do?” he asked.
“Typically, when I see someone going to a party, I expect them to be excited…you two look like you’re preparing for battle,” Narcissa said pleasantly from where she sat on the couch before the fireplace.
Okay, so this one was really hard because I
“I’d be lying if I said it didn’t fascinate me,” Harry said with a shrug.
“Wait, Draco! I’m sorry!” Harry called as Draco stormed from the kitchen. “What about dinner?”
“Harry?”
"We were all children, Draco." Harry knocked Draco’s hand from his shoulder and took another step away, tightly gripping the wet handle of his cane to keep himself balanced.
Harry closed his eyes, forcing himself to breathe, but all he could see was Remus and Tonks. Fred. Collin. Snape.
Draco waved his wand with his free hand, and Harry groaned under his breath when quiet violin music began to play. Ignoring him, Draco put his wand away and positioned Harry’s hand on his shoulder before placing his own on Harry’s waist.
“What’s all this?” Draco asked, unwinding his scarf and draping it over the back of a chair, along with his coat.
“Come on, Harry, you haven’t even got that much to do,” Draco said. “You’ve dealt with worse.”
Thank you for reading! :D
“No, of course not,” Harry snapped, and then ran a hand through his hair. “This shouldn’t be so hard. Do we want to spend Christmas with your parents or not?”
He walked without knowing where he was going, until he ended up in a clearing in the Dark Forest, surrounded by the trees, the smell of the earth, and the
that had permeated the world around him, Draco took a walk. It was dawn, and Draco was unable to sleep, afraid of what he’d see.
They lapsed into silence once more, neither of them speaking until they approached the hospital doors. Malfoy looked up at them and sighed.
“I can think of at least six people who will kill you if I fall and break something, Draco.”
“No, but if you look closely, you’ll see the tapestry’s changed.” Draco pointed to where Harry James Potter had appeared in the space beside his own. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to finish showing Harry the house. Have a good afternoon, father.”
In the dim light coming through their bedroom window, Draco saw Harry turn to look at him. “Do you want the whole list, or did you want something specific?”
Day twenty-four of Slythindor100's 25 Days of Draco/Harry fest!
Day fifteen of the 25 Days of Draco/Harry fest!
Narcissa turned. “He’ll be down for lunch, but he’s in his study if you’d like to see him.”
I was listening to a jazz playlist and Moonlight Serenade started playing, so this happened.
Harry was slipping, even as he felt Draco’s grip tighten around his hand.
“Another night in the infirmary.” He pulled the door open and murmured, “Thank you, Potter,” before slipping inside and closing the door behind him.
Harry glanced over at the copy of
Harry can remember, after Voldemort was gone at last, seeing Draco in the Great Hall. He'd been seated beside his mother's body, alone. His father had fled when it became obvious the battle was lost. Draco had cried silently in his corner, so unlike the sobs of Molly Weasley when she'd found out she'd lost two of her sons.
Harry took a deep breath. He hadn’t slept the night before, despite how tired he’d been. It was always hard for him to sleep in Grimmauld Place.
"I’m not—he only did what he thought was best." Harry tried to pull away from Draco, but Draco’s grip stayed firm. "It was for—"
“What’s that?” Draco asked, pointing at a red telephone booth ahead of them. “I’ve seen them all over today.”
“Please, I would’ve died by the time you made it halfway down the stairs,” responded Malfoy. He pulled the strap of his bag higher onto his shoulder. “See you around, Potter.”
Harry hadn’t thought of that.
Draco looked up, finally, and smiled. “What do you think my mother meant when she invited us to spend Christmas with them at the Manor?”
He stood up and hurried out of the room. Draco watched him go, tucking the ticket back into his book without a word.
“I’m not cold,” Harry muttered. “And we’ve been meeting up here all week.”
I love figure skating, and I think figure skater Draco would be amazing! I'm obsessed with Adam Rippon's layback spin, so that's part of the reason why that's the spin Draco did. I hope you enjoyed! Thank you all for reading and commenting!

“Can I call you Harry?”
And so many more.
“So it’s got something to do with me.”
Harry knew the rumours that were buzzing around school about him: that he was a Dark wizard himself; that he’d gained Voldemort’s power after he’d died; that he was immortal, and could never truly be killed.
“Touche,” Draco said, and then pulled something from the back of his book. He held it out to Harry, who took it, realising at once what it was.
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “I didn’t think. I’m sorry. I just didn’t--I didn’t think.”
“I wasn’t aware this was going to be a heart to heart,” Draco said dryly.
Harry flushed and looked away. “What for?”
Of course, St. Mungo’s didn’t have a treatment for difficulties associated with surviving the Killing Curse. All the Healers could do was apologetically tell Harry there was nothing they
Draco silently took the ring from its box and slid it onto his ring finger. He held it in front of his face, pretending not to notice how widely Harry was grinning, or the swoop of exhilaration in his stomach at the—strange, but not unpleasant—sight of the thin silver band around his finger.
Loving Draco is like riding a hippogriff, because it’s something Harry could never describe in words.
Harry and Draco stood next to each other in the Astronomy Tower, staring out at the grounds. The sky was clearer than it’d been in ages, and Harry marveled at the way the moonlight splashed over the grounds, highlighting the freshly fallen snow. Draco’s breath clouded in front of his face, and his face was flushed from the cold wind whipping around them. Harry smiled at the redness on his lips, left behind by the candy cane he’d eaten earlier.
“If there’s anything I’ve never doubted about you, Harry, it was whether you were brave enough.” Narcissa smiled again. “Sleep well, and don’t forget to put the fire out before you go.”
Harry’s laughter took him by surprise. "They’re not horrible!" he protested. "They’re warm."
Harry & Draco talk on Christmas day.
Harry scowled. “That doesn’t help--”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked quietly.
Harry was always complaining about being too warm, mostly because Draco was always complaining about being too cold. Even though they turned the heat down at night, and even though all the extra blankets were on Draco’s side of the bed, Harry insisted on sleeping with his shirt off. Not that Draco minded, of course. Harry was quite nice to look at, and to be fair, sleeping next to him did occasionally feel like sleeping beside a furnace.
Thank you, as always, for reading!
“I haven’t been here since before I went to Hogwarts. I never thought this house could feel like this,” said Draco quietly.
“Harry, did you ever learn to dance?”

“Yes, I do understand what a cane is for, you smart-arse.” Malfoy rolled his eyes.“I meant why have you got one? You look fine to me.”
“Why didn’t you stop those boys the other day?”
Three days after Christmas, Harry wakes screaming. This time, he's not alone. Draco's sitting on the end of Harry's bed, looking more concerned than Harry feels he has any right to be.
“Fine! It’s because of the ferret thing!” he snapped, throwing up his hands and spinning to face Harry. “If you’d been turned into a bloody rodent, you wouldn’t be too fond of them either!

“You’re up to something. That’s definitely your ‘up to something’ face. I remember it from school,” Draco said, but he sat beside Harry on the couch anyway.
“Do you want to be kissed?” he asked quietly.
At last, Harry was able to wrench his arm free, and he stumbled backwards slightly. Draco reached out as if to steady him, but the look on Harry’s face stopped him.
“Can I see? Should I take you to the hospital wing?”
Nevertheless, Harry and Draco found themselves corralled through the crowd of reporters, forced to pose before camera after camera. Harry could tell the photographers were irritated by how close Draco and Harry stood; the proximity made it impossible for the photographers to get a shot of Harry without Draco. But until Harry asked, Draco would not move. Unfortunately for the photographers, Harry would never ask.
, you bloody lightweight.”
“Ah, she redid this, too,” he said, looking around.  “I quite like it.”
“Are you sure? Your face looks like it’s--”
“Finished!” Draco said proudly as he walked through the door. “Merlin, I thought that week would never end!”
“Is that dinner I smell?” he asked.
And that's all she wrote! Thank you so much for reading! This fic has been a little bit strange for me, since so much of it is done as snapshots into Draco & Harry's lives. I hope you enjoyed! I've loved reading all the comments you guys have left, and sometimes they were the thing to motivate me to write! Merry Christmas!
Every time he thought of Draco, he got this strong fluttering in his stomach, not unlike the feeling he’d had with Ginny. Along with with the fluttering came a wave of panic. He’d come to terms with his feelings towards men--he’d spent entirely far too long thinking about Cedric in the Prefects’ Bath--but there was a difference between
Harry tumbled forward out of the fireplace and was only saved from falling by Draco’s tight grip on his arm.
"I’m okay," Harry said.
Draco had schooled his expression into one of indifference, but Harry could see the light, embarrassed flush on his cheeks.
A shrill voice sounded through the room as Harry and Draco stepped out of the fireplace and into Andromeda Tonks’ living room. Harry barely had a chance to regain his balance—he still
“Mother takes her guests very seriously.”
Thank you for reading!!! I'll try to answer comments this weekend! <3
“But that’s not the only thing that brought you to this room.” When Harry didn’t respond, Narcissa went on. “I was surprised to hear you and Draco were coming,” she said. “I thought, after all the terrible things that happened in this place, neither of you would dare step through its doors...It’s the only room in the house I haven’t touched since the war. It felt too much like trying to forget the past.”
Harry rolled his eyes.
As much as Harry hated to admit it, he didn’t like this corridor. It called back too many memories of the Chamber of Secrets, and even more recently, the image of Malfoy bleeding of Myrtle’s bathroom. He stopped outside the door.
“Come on, the others are in the kitchen. Dinner’s nearly ready.”
Finally, Draco seemed to find what he was looking for. He relaxed, a brief smile gracing his lips and, for a moment, everything felt a little bit easier.
“No,” he said, smoothing his hands over the duvet. “I somehow didn’t find the time while I was roaming the British countryside for a year.”
"Here," said Draco calmly. "Let me."
“Yes, well,” said Draco. “That’s not what I came here to talk about. Here.”
"Yes," Draco agreed. "And

“Question one: why have you been talking to me this week? Is it out of pity?”
“Harry?”
"I remember that night," said Draco. "V—the Dark Lord planned the whole thing at our dining room table. He thought you’d be moved on your birthday, but Severus came in and said that was a lie." Licking his lips, Draco went on. "Everyone had their doubts about him, but I was surprised he gave you up so easily. I shouldn’t have been, not after he—"
Harry’s cane clattered to the floor and he felt several pairs of eyes turn to look at him. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t
Okay, so maybe less romantic than relaxing and slightly angsty? I dunno. I'm finished with classes on Thursday, so hopefully I'll have a minute to respond to some comments then! Until then, thank you for reading!

"You always seem to forget magic exists when you’re nervous." Draco briefly lifted his gaze to meet Harry’s.
“That’s not important,” Draco said quickly. “I just wanted to share this with you.”

“It’s a telephone booth,” Harry said. “You go in to make a phone call if you need to contact someone while you’re out and can’t afford a mobile.”
Draco paused, glared, and then resumed straightening Harry’s tie. Harry reached up and stilled Draco’s nervous hands.
“Maybe you shouldn’t have lied,” said Draco.
